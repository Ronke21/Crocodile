<text>Terns are seabirds in the family [[Laridae]], subfamily Sterninae, that have a worldwide distribution and are normally found near the sea, rivers, or wetlands. Terns are treated in eleven genera in a subgroup of the family Laridae, which also includes several genera of gulls and the skimmers (&quot;Rynchops&quot;). They are slender, lightly built birds with long, forked tails, narrow wings, long bills, and relatively short legs. Most species are pale grey above and white below with a contrasting black cap to the head, but the marsh terns, the black-bellied tern, the Inca tern, and some noddies have dark body plumage for at least part of the year. The sexes are identical in appearance, but young birds are readily distinguishable from adults. Terns have a non-breeding plumage, which usually involves a white forehead and much-reduced black cap.

Terns are long-lived birds and are relatively free from natural predators and parasites; most species are declining in numbers due directly or indirectly to human activities, including habitat loss, pollution, disturbance, and predation by introduced mammals. The Chinese crested tern is critically endangered and three other species are classed as endangered. International agreements provide a measure of protection, but adults and eggs of some species are still used for food in the tropics.

==Description==
Terns range in size from the least tern, at in length and weighing , to the Caspian tern at , . They are longer-billed, lighter-bodied, and more streamlined than gulls, and their long tails and long narrow wings give them an elegance in flight. Male and female plumages are identical, although the male can be 2–5% larger than the female and often has a relatively larger bill. Sea terns have deeply forked tails, and at least a shallow &quot;V&quot; is shown by all other species. The noddies (genus &quot;Anous&quot;) have unusual notched-wedge shaped tails, the longest tail feathers being the middle-outer, rather than the central or outermost. Although their legs are short, terns can run well. They rarely swim, despite having webbed feet, usually landing on water only to bathe.

The majority of sea terns have light grey or white body plumage as adults, with a black cap to the head. The legs and bill are various combinations of red, orange, yellow, or black depending on species. The pale plumage is conspicuous from a distance at sea, and may attract other birds to a good feeding area for these fish-eating species. When seen against the sky, the white underparts also help to hide the hunting bird from its intended prey. The Inca tern has mainly dark plumage, and three species that mainly eat insects, black tern, white-winged tern, and black-bellied tern, have black underparts in the breeding season. Three of the noddies (brown noddy, black noddy, and lesser noddy) have dark plumage with a pale head cap, while the other two noddies (blue noddy and grey noddy, both of which were formerly placed in the genus &quot;Procelsterna&quot;) have paler grey plumage. The reason for their dark plumage is unknown, but it has been suggested that in tropical areas, where food resources are scarce, the less conspicuous colouration makes it harder for other noddies to detect a feeding bird. Plumage type, especially the head pattern, is linked to the phylogeny of the terns, and the pale-capped, dark-bodied noddies are believed to have diverged earlier than the other genera from an ancestral white-headed gull, followed by the partially black-headed &quot;Onychoprion&quot; and &quot;Sternula&quot; groupings.

Juvenile terns typically have brown- or yellow-tinged upperparts, and the feathers have dark edges that give the plumage a scaly appearance. They have dark bands on the wings and short tails. In most species, the subsequent moult does not start until after migration, the plumage then becoming more like the adult, but with some retained juvenile feathers and a white forehead with only a partial dark cap. By the second summer, the appearance is very like the adult, and full mature plumage is usually attained by the third year. After breeding, terns moult into a winter plumage, typically showing a white forehead. Heavily worn or aberrant plumages such as melanism and albinism are much rarer in terns than in gulls.

=== Voice ===

Terns have a wide repertoire of vocalisations. For example, the common tern has a distinctive alarm, &quot;kee-yah&quot;, also used as a warning to intruders, and a shorter &quot;kyar&quot;, given as an individual takes flight in response to a more serious threat; this quietens the usually noisy colony while its residents assess the danger. Other calls include a down-slurred &quot;keeur&quot; given when an adult is approaching the nest with a fish, and a &quot;kip&quot; uttered during social contact. Parents and chicks can locate one another by call, and siblings also recognise each other&#x27;s vocalisations from about the twelfth day after hatching, which helps to keep the brood together.

Vocal differences reinforce species separation between closely related birds such as the least and little terns, and can help humans distinguish similar species, such as common and arctic terns, since flight calls are unique to each species.

== Taxonomy ==
The bird order Charadriiformes contains 18 coastal seabird and wader families. Within the order, the terns form a lineage with the gulls, and, less closely, with the skimmers, skuas, and auks. Early authors such as Conrad Gessner, Francis Willughby, and William Turner did not clearly separate terns from gulls, but Linnaeus recognised the distinction in his 1758 &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;, placing the gulls in the genus &quot; Larus&quot; and the terns in &quot;Sterna&quot;. He gave &quot;Sterna&quot; the description &quot;rostrum subulatum&quot;, &quot;awl-shaped bill&quot;, referring to the long, pointed bills typical of this group of birds, a feature that distinguishes them from the thicker-billed gulls. Behaviour and morphology suggest that the terns are more closely related to the gulls than to the skimmers or skuas, and although Charles Lucien Bonaparte created the family Sternidae for the terns in 1838, for many years they were considered to be a subfamily, Sterninae, of the gull family, Laridae. Relationships between various tern species, and between the terns and the other Charadriiformes, were formerly difficult to resolve because of a poor fossil record and the misidentification of some finds.

Following genetic research in the early twenty-first century, the terns were historically treated as a separate family, Sternidae. Most terns were formerly treated as belonging to one large genus, &quot;Sterna&quot;, with just a few dark species placed in other genera; in one 1959 paper, only the noddies and the Inca tern were excluded from &quot;Sterna&quot;. A recent analysis of DNA sequences supported the splitting of &quot;Sterna&quot; into several smaller genera. One study of part of the cytochrome b gene sequence found a close relationship between terns and a group of waders in the suborder Thinocori. These results are in disagreement with other molecular and morphological studies, and have been interpreted as showing either a large degree of molecular convergent evolution between the terns and these waders, or the retention of an ancient genotype.

Research in 2007 had suggested that the noddies were not terns at all, but were basal to all the other genera in Laridae, a taxonomy that was followed by the IOC World Bird List for several years up to 2023, but more comprehensive analysis has now shown that the noddies are basal to only the other terns, not the whole family; this has now been followed by the IOC World Bird List version 14.1 in 2024.

===Etymology===
The word &quot;stearn&quot; was used for these birds in Old English as early as the eighth century, and appears in the poem &quot;The Seafarer&quot;, written in the ninth century or earlier. Variants such as &quot;tearn&quot; occurred by the eleventh century, although the older form lingered on in Norfolk dialect for several centuries. As now, the term was used for the inland black tern as well as the marine species. Some authorities consider &quot;tearn&quot; and similar forms to be variants of &quot;stearn&quot;, while others derive the English words from Scandinavian equivalents such as Danish and Norwegian &quot;terne&quot; or Swedish &quot;tärna&quot;, and ultimately from Old Norse &quot;þerna&quot;. Linnaeus adopted &quot;stearn&quot; or &quot;sterna&quot; (which the naturalist William Turner had used in 1544 as a Latinisation of an English word, presumably &quot;stern&quot;, for the black tern) or a North Germanic equivalent for his genus name &quot;Sterna&quot;. All of these names are ultimately onomatopoeic, derived from the bird&#x27;s calls.

=== Species ===
The cladogram shows the relationships between the tern genera, and the currently recognised species, based on mitochondrial DNA studies, are listed below:


In addition to extant species, the fossil record includes a Miocene palaeospecies, &quot;Sterna milne-edwardsii&quot;.

The birds in the genus &quot;Anous&quot; are known as noddies, the &quot;Chlidonias&quot; species are the marsh terns, and all other species comprise the sea terns.

==Distribution and habitat==
Terns have a worldwide distribution, breeding on all continents including Antarctica. The northernmost and southernmost breeders are the Arctic tern and Antarctic tern respectively. Many terns breeding in temperate zones are long-distance migrants, and the Arctic tern sees more annual daylight than any other animal as it migrates from its northern breeding grounds to Antarctic waters, a return journey of more than . A common tern that hatched in Sweden and was found dead five months later on Stewart Island, New Zealand, must have flown at least . Actual flight distances are, of course, much greater than the shortest possible route. Arctic terns from Greenland were shown by radio geolocation to average on their annual migrations, while another from the Farne Islands in Northumberland tagged &#x27;G82&#x27; covered a staggering 96,000 km in just 10 months from the end of one breeding season to the start of the next, travelling not just the length of the Atlantic Ocean and the width of the Indian Ocean, but also half way across the South Pacific to the boundary between the Ross and Amundsen Seas before returning back west.

Most terns breed on open sandy or rocky areas on coasts and islands. The yellow-billed, large-billed, and black-fronted terns breed only on rivers, and common, least and little terns also sometimes use inland locations. The marsh terns, Trudeau&#x27;s tern and some Forster&#x27;s terns nest in inland marshes. The black noddy and the white tern nest above ground level on cliffs or in trees. Migratory terns move to the coast after breeding, and most species winter near land, although some marine species, like the Aleutian tern, may wander far from land. The sooty tern is entirely oceanic when not breeding, and healthy young birds are not seen on land for up to five years after fledging until they return to breed. They lack waterproof plumage, so they cannot rest on the sea. Where they spend the years prior to breeding is unknown.

==Behaviour==
The terns are birds of open habitats that typically breed in noisy colonies and lay their eggs on bare ground with little or no nest material. Marsh terns construct floating nests from the vegetation in their wetland habitats, and a few species build simple nests in trees, on cliffs or in crevices. The white tern, uniquely, lays its single egg on a bare tree branch. Depending on the species, one to three eggs make up the clutch. Most species feed on fish caught by diving from flight, but the marsh terns are insect-eaters, and some large terns will supplement their diet with small land vertebrates. Many terns are long-distance migrants, and the Arctic tern may see more daylight in a year than any other animal.

===Breeding===

Terns are normally monogamous, although trios or female-female pairings have been observed in at least three species. Most terns breed annually and at the same time of year, but some tropical species may nest at intervals shorter than 12 months or asynchronously. Most terns become sexually mature when aged three, although some small species may breed in their second year. Some large sea terns, including the sooty and bridled terns, are four or older when they first breed. Terns normally breed in colonies, and are site-faithful if their habitat is sufficiently stable. A few species nest in small or dispersed groups, but most breed in colonies of up to a few hundred pairs, often alongside other seabirds such as gulls or skimmers. Large tern species tend to form larger colonies, which in the case of the sooty tern can contain up to two million pairs. Large species nest very close together and sit tightly, making it difficult for aerial predators to land among them. Smaller species are less closely packed and mob intruders. Peruvian and Damara terns have small dispersed colonies and rely on the cryptic plumage of the eggs and young for protection.

The male selects a territory, which he defends against conspecifics, and re-establishes a pair bond with his mate or attracts a new female if necessary. Courtship involves ritualised flight and ground displays, and the male often presents a fish to his partner. Most species have little or no nest, laying the eggs onto bare ground, but Trudeau&#x27;s tern, Forster&#x27;s tern and the marsh terns construct floating nests from the vegetation in their wetland habitats. Black and lesser noddies build nests of twigs, feathers and excreta on tree branches, and brown, blue, and grey noddies make rough platforms of grass and seaweed on cliff ledges, in cavities or on other rocky surfaces. The Inca tern nests in crevices, caves and disused burrows, such as that of a Humboldt penguin. The white tern is unique in that it lays its single egg on a bare tree branch.

Tropical species usually lay just one egg, but two or three is typical in cooler regions if there is an adequate food supply. The time taken to complete the clutch varies, but for temperate species incubation takes 21–28 days. The eggs of most gulls and terns are brown
with dark splotches, so they are difficult for predators to spot on the beach. The precocial chicks fledge in about four weeks after hatching. Tropical species take longer because of the poorer food supply. Both parents incubate the eggs and feed the chicks, although the female does more incubating and less fishing than her partner. Young birds migrate with the adults. Terns are generally long-lived birds, with individuals typically returning for 7–10 breeding seasons. Maximum known ages include 34 for an Arctic tern and 32 for a sooty. Although several other species are known to live in captivity for up to 20 years, their greatest recorded ages are underestimates because the birds can outlive their rings. Interbreeding between tern species is rare, and involves closely related species when it occurs. Hybrids recorded include common tern with roseate, Sandwich with lesser-crested, and black with white-winged.

===Feeding===

Most terns hunt fish by diving, often hovering first, and the particular approach technique used can help to distinguish similar species at a distance. Sea terns often hunt in association with porpoises or predatory fish, such as bluefish, tuna or bonitos, since these large marine animals drive the prey to the surface. Sooty terns feed at night as the fish rise to the surface, and are believed to sleep on the wing since they become waterlogged easily. Terns of several species will feed on invertebrates, following the plough or hunting on foot on mudflats. The marsh terns normally catch insects in the air or pick them off the surface of fresh water. Other species will sometimes use these techniques if the opportunity arises. An individual tern&#x27;s foraging efficiency increases with its age.

The gull-billed tern is an opportunist predator, taking a wide variety of prey from marine, freshwater and terrestrial habitats. Depending on what is available it will eat small crabs, fish, crayfish, grasshoppers and other large insects, lizards and amphibians. Warm-blooded prey includes mice and the eggs and chicks of other beach-breeding birds; least terns, little terns and members of its own species may be victims. The greater crested tern will also occasionally catch unusual vertebrate species such as agamid lizards and green sea turtle hatchlings, and follows trawlers for discards.

The eyes of terns cannot accommodate under water, so they rely on accurate sighting from the air before they plunge-dive. Like other seabirds that feed at the surface or dive for food, terns have red oil droplets in the cones of their retinas; birds that have to look through an air/water interface have more deeply coloured carotenoid pigments in the oil drops than other species. The pigment also improves visual contrast and sharpens distance vision, especially in hazy conditions, and helps terns to locate shoals of fish, although it is uncertain whether they are sighting the phytoplankton on which the fish feed, or other feeding birds. The red colouring reduces ultraviolet sensitivity, which in any case is an adaptation more suited to terrestrial feeders like the gulls, and this protects the eye from UV damage.
==Predators and parasites==

The inaccessibility of many tern colonies gave them a measure of protection from mammalian predators, especially on islands, but introduced species brought by humans can seriously affect breeding birds. These can be predators such as foxes, raccoons, cats and rats, or animals that destroy the habitat, including rabbits, goats and pigs. Problems arise not only on formerly mammal-free islands, as in New Zealand, but also where an alien carnivore, such as the American mink in Scotland, presents an unfamiliar threat.

Adult terns may be hunted by owls and raptors, and their chicks and eggs may be taken by herons, crows or gulls. Less obvious nest predators include ruddy turnstones in the Arctic, and gull-billed terns in little tern colonies. Adults may be robbed of their catch by avian kleptoparasites such as frigatebirds, skuas, other terns or large gulls.

External parasites include chewing lice of the genus &quot;Saemundssonia&quot;, feather lice and fleas such as &quot;Ceratophyllus borealis&quot;. Lice are often host specific, and the closely related common and Arctic terns carry quite different species. Internal parasites include the crustacean &quot;Reighardia sternae&quot;, and tapeworms such as &quot;Ligula intestinalis&quot; and members of the genera &quot;Diphyllobothrium&quot; and &quot;Schistocephalus&quot;. Terns are normally free of blood parasites, unlike gulls that often carry &quot;Haemoproteus&quot; species. An exception is the brown noddy, which sometimes harbours protozoa of that genus. In 1961 the common tern was the first wild bird species identified as being infected with avian influenza, the H5N3 variant being found in an outbreak involving South African birds. Several species of terns have been implicated as carriers of West Nile virus.

==Relationships with humans==

Terns and their eggs have long been eaten by humans and island colonies were raided by sailors on long voyages since the eggs or large chicks were an easily obtained source of protein. Eggs are still illegally harvested in southern Europe, and adults of wintering birds are taken as food in West Africa and South America. The roseate tern is significantly affected by this hunting, with adult survival 10% lower than would otherwise be expected. In the West Indies, the eggs of roseate and sooty terns are believed to be aphrodisiacs, and are disproportionately targeted by egg collectors. Tern skins and feathers have long been used for making items of clothing such as capes and hats, and this became a large-scale activity in the second half of the nineteenth century when it became fashionable to use feathers in hatmaking. This trend started in Europe but soon spread to the Americas and Australia. White was the preferred colour, and sometimes wings or entire birds were used.

Terns have sometimes benefited from human activities, following the plough or fishing boats for easy food supplies, although some birds get trapped in nets or swallow plastic. Fishermen looked for feeding tern flocks, since the birds could lead them to fish shoals. Overfishing of small fish such as sand eels can lead to steep declines in the colonies relying on these prey items. More generally, the loss or disruption to tern colonies caused by human activities has caused declines in many species. Pollution has been a problem in some areas, and in the 1960s and 1970s DDT caused egg loss through thinning of the shells. In the 1980s, organochlorides caused severe declines in the Great Lakes area of the US. Because of their sensitivity to pollutants, terns are sometimes used as indicators of contamination levels.

Habitat enhancements used to increase the breeding success of terns include floating nest platforms for black, common and Caspian terns, and artificial islands created for a number of different species. More specialised interventions include providing nest boxes for roseate terns, which normally nest in the shelter of tallish vegetation, and using artificial eelgrass mats to encourage common terns to nest in areas not vulnerable to flooding.

==Conservation status==

A number of terns face serious threats, and the Chinese crested tern is classed as &quot;critically endangered&quot; by BirdLife International. It has a population of fewer than 50 birds and a breeding range of just . It is declining due to egg collection, human disturbance and the loss of coastal wetlands in China. Three other species are categorised as &quot;endangered&quot;, with declining populations of less than 10,000 birds. The South Asian black-bellied tern is threatened by habitat loss, egg collecting for food, pollution and predation. In New Zealand, the black-fronted tern is facing a rapid fall in numbers due to predation by introduced mammals and Australian magpies. Disturbance by cattle and sheep and by human activities is also a factor. The Peruvian tern was initially damaged by the collapse of anchoveta stocks in 1972, but breeding colonies have subsequently been lost due to building, disturbance and pollution in their coastal wetlands.

The Australasian fairy tern is described as &quot;vulnerable&quot;. Disturbance by humans, dogs and vehicles, predation by introduced species and inappropriate water level management in South Australia are the main reasons for its decline. Five species are &quot;near threatened&quot;, indicating less severe concerns or only potential vulnerability. The elegant tern is so categorised because 95% of the population breeds on one island, Isla Rasa in the Gulf of California, and the Kerguelen tern has a population of less than 5,000 adults breeding on small and often stormy islands in the southern Indian Ocean. Three species, the Inca, Damara, and river terns, are expected to decline in the future due to habitat loss and disturbance. Some tern subspecies are endangered, including the California least tern and the Easter Island race of the grey noddy.

Most tern species are declining in numbers due to the loss or disturbance of breeding habitat, pollution and increased predation. Gull populations have increased over the last century because of reduced persecution and the availability of food from human activities, and terns have been forced out of many traditional nesting areas by the larger birds. A few species are defying the trend and showing local increases, including the Arctic tern in Scandinavia, Forster&#x27;s tern around the Great Lakes, Cabot&#x27;s tern in eastern North America and its yellow-billed subspecies, the Cayenne tern, in the Caribbean.

Terns are protected by international legislation such as the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) and the US-Canada Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918. Parties to the AWEA agreement are required to engage in a wide range of conservation strategies described in a detailed action plan. The plan is intended to address key issues such as species and habitat conservation, management of human activities, research, education, and implementation. The North American legislation is similar, although there is a greater emphasis on protection.

<text>The 1810 Act of Succession () is one of four &quot;Fundamental Laws of the Realm&quot; () and thus forms part of the Swedish Constitution. The Act regulates the line of succession to the Swedish throne and the conditions which eligible members of the Swedish royal family must abide by in order to remain in it.

It was jointly adopted by the Riksdag of the Estates, convened in Örebro on 26 September 1810, and Charles XIII, as a logical consequence following the election on 21 August of Jean Baptiste Bernadotte as Crown Prince.

The actual contents of the Act, save the solemn preamble, has been thoroughly rewritten over the years: the most notable change occurred in 1980 when the core principle of agnatic primogeniture (male succession only) was changed in favor of absolute primogeniture (eldest child regardless of sex).

==Historical background==
The Act of Succession was adopted by the Riksdag of the Estates assembled at Örebro in 1810, upon electing Charles XIV John (Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte) as the heir to King Charles XIII. This happened at a tumultuous time for Sweden, as only one year earlier the former king, Gustav IV Adolf (and his sons) had been deposed and replaced by his childless uncle, Charles XIII. At the same time the Finnish War was coming to an end and Finland, then a part of Sweden proper, was held by Russia. The authoritarian constitution of 1772 was abolished and power was returned to parliament by the new Instrument of Government adopted on 6 June 1809. From 1814 to 1905 the Act of Succession also regulated succession to the Norwegian throne, due to the union of Sweden-Norway.

==Provisions==
The Act in the current version specifies that:
* Only children born in wedlock may inherit the Throne.
* Only the descendants of Carl XVI Gustaf may inherit the Throne.
* A prince or princess in the line of succession shall belong to and profess the &quot;pure evangelical faith&quot;, as defined in the &quot;Unaltered Augsburg Confession&quot; and the &quot;Uppsala Synod of 1593&quot;, i.e. by implication the Church of Sweden.
* The offspring of an approved marriage must be brought up within Sweden.
* A prince or princess may not marry and remain in the line of succession without having received consent, upon application of the Monarch, from the Government of Sweden.
* A prince or princess is also prevented from becoming monarch of another country, either by election or marriage, without the consent of the Monarch and the Government.
If any of these provisions are violated: all rights of succession for the person concerned and all descendants are lost.

==Changes==
In its original version, the Act mandated that a Swedish prince could only marry into families deemed to be of equal rank, or forfeit for himself and his future descendants all dynastic rights. The key wording was a prohibition of marrying a &quot;private man&#x27;s daughter&quot; (), a term which in Swedish jurisprudence was understood to exclude all non-royal persons, including the aristocracy. In 1937 the statutory provision which in effect had required a spouse of royal birth was changed and the prohibition only extended to a &quot;private Swedish man&#x27;s daughter&quot; ().

A total of five Swedish princes lost their style of HRH, title as Prince of Sweden, personal Ducal title, and all rights of succession to the throne because they violated the uncompromisable constitutional provision, regardless of whether the King-in-Council did consent or not: Oscar in 1888, Lennart in 1932, Sigvard in 1934, Carl in 1937 and Carl Johan in 1946. There is since 1980 no statutory limitation, based on either nationality or royal rank, on whom a prince or princess can marry, apart from the fact that permission must be granted.

In 1980, the rule of succession was changed from agnatic primogeniture to absolute primogeniture. This change in effect made Victoria (born 1977) heir apparent and Crown Princess, passing over her younger brother Prince Carl Philip (born 1979) who had been the heir apparent and Crown Prince for less than one year.

<doc id="210792" wikidata="Q205323" url="?curid=210792" title="Skua">
<text>The skuas are a group of predatory seabirds with seven species forming the genus Stercorarius, the only genus in the family Stercorariidae. The three smaller skuas, the Arctic skua, the long-tailed skua, and the pomarine skua, are called jaegers in North American English.

The English word &quot;skua&quot; comes from the Faroese name for the great skua, , with the island of Skúvoy renowned for its colony of that bird. The general Faroese term for skuas is . The word &quot;jaeger&quot; or is German for &quot;hunter&quot;. The genus name &quot;Stercorarius&quot; is Latin and means &quot;of dung&quot;; the food disgorged by other birds when pursued by skuas was once thought to be excrement.

Skuas nest on the ground in temperate, Antarctic, and Arctic regions, and are long-distance migrants. They have even been sighted at the South Pole.

==Biology and habits==
Outside the breeding season, skuas take fish, offal, and carrion. Many practice kleptoparasitism, which comprises up to 95% of the feeding methods of wintering skuas, by chasing gulls, terns and other seabirds to steal their catches, regardless of the size of the species attacked (up to three times heavier than the attacking skua). Larger species, such as the great skua, regularly kill and eat adult seabirds, such as puffins and gulls and have been observed killing birds as large as a grey heron. On the breeding grounds, the three, more slender northern breeding species commonly eat lemmings. Those species that breed in the southern oceans largely feed on fish that can be caught near their colonies. The eggs and chicks of other seabirds, primarily penguins, are an important food source for most skua species during the nesting season.

In the southern oceans and Antarctica region, some skua species (especially the south polar skua) will readily scavenge carcasses at breeding colonies of both penguins and pinnipeds. Skuas will also kill live penguin chicks and sick or injured adult penguins. In these areas, the skuas will often forfeit their catches to the considerably larger and very aggressive giant petrels. Skuas have also been observed to directly pilfer milk from the elephant seal&#x27;s teats.

Skuas are medium to large birds, typically with grey or brown plumage, often with white markings on the wings. The skuas range in size from the long-tailed skua, &quot;Stercorarius longicauda&quot;, at , to the brown skua, &quot;Stercorarius antarcticus&quot;, at . On average, a skua is about long, and across the wings. They have longish bills with a hooked tip, and webbed feet with sharp claws. They look like large dark gulls, but have a fleshy cere above the upper mandible.

The skuas are strong, acrobatic fliers. They are generally aggressive in disposition. Potential predators approaching their nests will be quickly attacked by the parent birds, which usually target the heads of intruders – a practice known as &#x27;&#x27;.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Stercorarius&quot; was introduced by the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson in 1760 with the parasitic jaeger (&quot;Stercorarius parasiticus&quot;) as the type species.

Skuas are related to gulls, waders, auks, and skimmers. In the three smaller species, all nesting exclusively in the Holarctic, breeding adults have the two central tail feathers obviously elongated, and at least some adults have white on the underparts and pale yellow on the neck. These characteristics are not shared by the larger species, all native to the Southern Hemisphere except for the great skua. Therefore, the skuas are often split into two genera, with only the smaller species retained in &quot;Stercorarius&quot;, and the large species placed in &quot;Catharacta&quot;. However, based on genetics, behavior, and feather lice, the overall relationship among the species is best expressed by placing all in a single genus. The pomarine and great skuas&#x27; mitochondrial DNA (inherited from the mother) is in fact more closely related to each other than it is to either Arctic or long-tailed skuas, or to the Southern Hemisphere species. Thus, hybridization must have played a considerable role in the evolution of the diversity of Northern Hemisphere skuas.

==Species==
The genus contains seven species:

<doc id="210797" wikidata="Q1017107" url="?curid=210797" title="Lake Burtnieks">
<text>Lake Burtnieks (, ) is the fourth largest lake in Latvia. It is shallow with an average depth of 2.9 m. The lake bed is mainly sandy, in places a little muddy. In the southeast part of the lake there is Devonian sandstone rock. The lake has 17 species of fish, such as minnows, salmon, chubs, eels, and pike, and there are areas for duck hunting. The banks are shallow and sandy, but along the southern coast, waves have carved sandstone cliffs. After the regulation of the Salaca river in 1929, the lake level dropped by a metre, and many of the exposed shallows grew covered with reeds and algae. The lake contains three islands with a total area of 14,000 m2. The lake lies entirely within the Northern Vidzeme Biosphere Reserve. Small streams from Latvia and Estonia; the Aunupīte, Bauņupīte, Briedes upe, Dūres upe, Ēķinupe, Rūjas upe, and Sedas upe flow into the lake. Lake Burtnieks is the source of 95 km long Salaca river, which flows out of the northwest corner into the Gulf of Riga. In ancient times, the lake was known as Astijärv or Aster, when northern Vidzeme was inhabited by the Livonian people. The lake is a major setting of the Latvian national epic Lāčplēsis, and appears in many Latvian folklore stories. A few small villages cling to the coast today, the largest of which is Burtnieki. The Zvejnieki burial ground is a major archaeological site by the northern shore.

<doc id="210798" wikidata="Q1355029" url="?curid=210798" title="Lacandon people">
<text>The Lacandon are one of the Maya peoples who live in the jungles of the Mexican state of Chiapas, near the southern border with Guatemala. Their homeland, the Lacandon Jungle, lies along the Mexican side of the Usumacinta River and its tributaries. The Lacandon are one of the most isolated and culturally conservative of Mexico&#x27;s native peoples. Almost extinct in 1943, today their population has grown significantly, yet remains small, at approximately 650 speakers of the Lacandon language.

==Culture==
The Lacandon escaped Spanish control throughout the colonial era by living in small, remote farming communities in the jungles of what is now Chiapas and the Guatemalan department of El Petén, avoiding contact with whites and Ladinos. Lacandon customs remain close to those of their pre-Columbian Mesoamerican ancestors. As recently as the late 19th century some bound the heads of infants, resulting in the distinctively shaped foreheads seen in Classic Maya art. And well into the 20th century, they continued using bows and arrows and making arrowheads from flint they quarried in the rainforest. Today they sell versions of these to tourists.

Until the mid-20th century the Lacandon had little contact with the outside world. They worshiped their own pantheon of gods and goddesses in small huts set aside for religious worship at the edge of their villages. These sacred structures contain a shelf of clay incense burners, each decorated with the face of a Lacandon deity. The Lacandon also made pilgrimages to ancient Maya cities to pray and to remove stone pebbles from the ruins for ritual purposes. They believe that the Maya sites are places where their gods once dwelled before moving to new domains they constructed in the sky and below the earth. The Maya site of Bonampak, famous for its preserved temple murals, became known to the outside world when Lacandóns led American photographer Giles Healy there in 1946.

A few Lacandon continue their traditional religious practices today, especially in the north around Lakes Naja and Mensabok. In the south, a yellow fever epidemic in the 1940s took many lives and caused a high degree of social disruption. The southern group abandoned their pantheon of gods in the 1950s and were later Christianized through the efforts of the Summer Institute of Linguistics (SIL). Southern Lacandon helped SIL missionaries translate the New Testament and parts of the Old Testament into their language. But in the north the spiritual leader Chan K&#x27;in, who lived to an advanced age and died in 1996, helped keep the ancient traditions alive. Chan K&#x27;in urged his people to maintain a respectful distance from the outside world, taking some things of value, but not allowing outside influences to overwhelm the Lacandon way of life.

==Language==
The Lacandon speak a Mayan language closely related to Yucatec Maya. In their own language they call themselves &quot;Hach Winik&quot; (&quot;Real People&quot;, ) and they call their language &quot;Hach T&#x27;ana&quot; (&quot;Real Language&quot;). The Lacandón have long been traders with other Maya in the area and have adopted some words of Ch&#x27;ol and Tzeltal into their lexicon. They have also created their own unique styles of speaking Spanish in some cases. Details of the language of the northern group of Lacandon can be found at the Lacandon Cultural Heritage website.

==Threats to cultural survival==
Lacandon interaction with the outside world has accelerated over the past 30 years. In the 1970s, the Mexican government began paying them for rights to log timber in their forests, bringing them into closer contact with the national economy. At the same time, the government built roads into the area, establishing new villages of Tzeltal and Ch&#x27;ol Indians who were far more exposed to the outside world than the Lacandon. The roads helped expand farming and logging, and severe deforestation occurred. Then, in the early 1990s, the Lacandon witnessed acts of violence during the Zapatista rebellion in Chiapas. The Zapatistas issued a series of statements of their principles, each called a &quot;Declaration of the Lacandon Jungle&quot;.

Casa Na Bolom in San Cristóbal de las Casas is devoted to helping the Lacandon cope with the changes imposed on them in recent decades. A scientific and cultural institute, it was founded in 1951 by archaeologist Frans Blom and his wife, photographer Gertrude &quot;Trudi&quot; Duby Blom. Casa Na Bolom (&quot;House of the Jaguar&quot;) does advocacy work for the Lacandón, sponsors research on their history and culture, returns to them copies of photographs and other cultural documentation done by scholars over the years, and addresses environmental threats to the Lacandon Jungle, such as deforestation. Among its many projects, Casa Na Bolom has collaborated with a group of Swedish ethnomusicology students who recorded traditional Lacandón songs. A publication of those recordings in CD form is now planned.

Several linguists and anthropologists have done extensive studies of Lacandon language and culture, including Phillip Baer, a missionary linguist with Summer Institute of Linguistics who lived among the Lacandon for more than 50 years, Roberto Bruce an American linguist who devoted his life to studying Lacandon language and culture, and Christian Rätsch who spent three years living with the Lacandon while studying their spells and incantations.

==History==
The first definite contact with the Lacandons occurred in the last decades of the 18th century. When scholars first investigated in the early 20th century, they thought that the Lacandon were the direct descendants of ancient Classic Maya people who fled into the rainforest at the time of the Spanish Conquest and remained linguistically and culturally pristine ever since. They made that assumption because the Lacandons&#x27; physical appearance and dress is so similar to the way the ancient Maya portrayed themselves in their murals and relief carvings. Scholars were also impressed by the fact that “the Lacandon resided near the remote ruins of ancient Mayan cities, had the knowledge to survive in the tropical jungle, and were neither Christian nor modernized”. They thought that these native people were pure Maya untouched by the outside world. But in recent years researchers have revealed a more complex history for the Lacandon.

Scholars have now shown that the Lacandon are the result of a coming together of various lowland Mayan refugee groups during the period of Spanish colonial rule. Their “language, clothing, and customs derive from several different Colonial Era Mayan ethnic groups”. It appears that the Lacandon possess multiple origins and that their culture arose as different lowland Mayan groups escaped Spanish rule and fled into the forest. There was a blending of cultural elements as some traits of varied origin were retained while others were lost. The Lacandon seem to have arisen as a distinct ethnic group as late as the 18th century, meaning that they “cannot be the direct descendants of the ancient Maya since their culture did not exist before it was generated through inter-indigenous interaction”.

The Lacandon seem to have originated in the Campeche and Petén regions of what is now Mexico and Guatemala and moved into the Lacandon rainforest at the end of the 18th century, a thousand years after the Classic Maya civilization collapsed. Unlike other indigenous peoples in Mesoamerica, though, they were not strongly affected by outside forces until the 19th century. While other Indians were living under the control of the Spanish, the Lacandon lived independently deep in the tropical forest. Their independence allowed them to manage their contact with the outside world in a controlled way. Preserving their ethnic identity was not as effortless, though. The Lacandon deliberately remained in small, isolated groups in order to resist change. They used their inaccessibility and dispersed settlement pattern to protect their traditions.

Outsiders avoided the Lacandon region for centuries due to frightening legends about the dense tropical forest. The Spanish—and later the Mexicans, after they gained their independence—sometimes made efforts to settle the region, but failed due to the lack of financial and political support. For generations the only connections the Lacandon had to the outside world came through trade. The Lacandon “often initiated [trade and] sought metal tools, salt, cloth, and other European goods”. Outsiders, for their part, also desired goods from the forest, such as timber, animal skins, and fruits. Although trade was slow and infrequent, it did take place and it allowed for an intermingling of culture and material goods.

In the 19th century, outsiders looked toward the forest for valuable timber and new lands for farming. As the 19th century progressed, farmers and ranchers invaded the area, and the Lacandon withdrew farther into the forest, losing more and more land on the periphery of their territory. The Lacandon survived outright conquest, though, by adopting a flexible strategy that led them to accept, resist, or retreat from the imposing foreign culture depending on the circumstances.

By the late 20th century, though, the Lacandon were in frequent contact with outsiders within the area that had been their heartland. This resulted in territorial shifts, disease, and new powerful cultural influences. As logging began on a massive scale, the Lacandon came into contact often with forest workers, which resulted in wage work for some and an overall transformation of their culture, a process that continues to the present time. As development in the area took place, the Catholic Church established mission churches which converted many Lacandon. The Lacandon were drawn into the revolt of indigenous peoples that took place in the area in the 1980s and 1990s. They endured the pressure of cultural change as never before in their history. Their strategy of many generations to withdraw into the forest to preserve their traditional way of life now failed them.

In 1971 a Mexican presidential order turned 614,000 hectares over to the Lacandon Community, thereby recognizing the land rights of this relatively small group of indigenous forest dwellers over the more numerous settlers, who had been encouraged to colonize the Lacandon Forest under previous government policies. But this did not put an end to the Lacandons&#x27; troubles. Ironically, this effort to save Lacandon culture resulted in enduring tensions between the Lacandon and their neighbors.

==Religion==
Throughout their history the ritual practices and beliefs of the Lacandon have shifted and evolved. Change has seemed more explicit as contact with the outside world has increased. Therefore, it is important to acknowledge the differences between Lacandon religious practices prior to increased contact (19th century) and those afterwards. As a culturally conservative group of Native Mesoamericans, the Lacandon have maintained characteristics unique to themselves, including certain religious customs, despite the encroachment and influence of the outside world since the early 16th century. It is also important to recognize that while the Lacandon are culturally conservative, they were never isolationist as they had continued contact and trade with other Native Mesoamericans throughout their history. However, the Lacandon have been very secretive about their religious rituals throughout ethnographic history, which has led to many mysteries about the meanings and origins of certain rituals and beliefs. Another problem to consider is that the Lacandon are not an entirely homogeneous group, which has created difficulties for ethnographers in understanding the religious practices of the Lacandon both past and present. Significant differences may be found in ritual behavior related to geographic differences of Lacandon villages. Lacandon villages are small and dispersed throughout the jungle in Chiapas. A further geographic divide is evident between the Lacandon in lowland Chiapas near the Maya ruins of Bonampak and Yaxchilán and the highland Lacandón who reside closer to Lakes Naja and Metzabok within the jungle (see map at). Lacandon who reside in the southern part of the Chiapas jungle have been more exposed to outsiders, are more aggressive than their highland counterparts, have slightly different dress, and adopted the Christian faith more quickly.

===Religious practitioners===
When contacts between Europeans and the Lacandon began being recorded it was believed that they were unchanged ancient Maya descended from those who fled initial Spanish contact and that they were complete with the ritual beliefs and physical appearance of their ancestors. The Lacandon refer to themselves as Hach Winik, or “real people” and report that they are descendants of the Maya. While the Lacandon share a history with the Maya, many of their religious practices are not found among the ancient Maya or other Maya groups. The Lacandon may identify a particular man in a village who has shown extensive ritual knowledge or ability as a healer or religious leader who then performs religious ceremonies. However, basic offerings and incense burning is performed by all male heads of household and generally theirs is an egalitarian society as far as leadership.

Ceremonies usually have only male participants and are for a myriad of reasons including; feeding a particular god, a fertility rite, to help with agriculture, and frequently in response to illness. As contact from outsiders increased so did the occurrence of disease among the Lacandón, and with that more rituals focused on healing. The prominence of particular Gods also increased with the influx of outsiders including a God the Lacandon recognize specifically for foreigners among other things.

===Gods===
Lacandon deities include K’akoch, the god responsible for the creation of earth, sun, and other gods (who came from the flower of the bak nikte&#x27; &quot;Plumeria rubra&quot;); K’akoch does not interact with humans. Sukunkyum is held to be the first god to come from the bak nikte&#x27; and is reportedly in charge of the underworld and judging people&#x27;s souls; Sukunkyum tends to the sun (when it disappears into the west) and the moon (during the day). Hachäkyum is the younger brother of Sukunkyum; he is the most important deity because he created the jungle, animals, and man and woman (with the help of his wife).

In the generation below Hachakyum, there are various mediating gods, such as his son Tuub (T&#x27;up) and his son-in-law Ah Kin (&#x27;Priest&#x27;) Chob. Mensäbäk is the god of rain and is therefore very important to the Lacandón. Mensäbäk can be traced back to the pre-Hispanic Maya god Yum Chac, who is also a god associated with rainfall. There are also gods associated with thunder and lightning (Hahanak&#x27;uh), earthquakes (Kisin), and war and disease (Ak K&#x27;ak&#x27;). Inexplicably, the Lacandon seem to have no maize deity, a deity which is present among all other Mayan groups.

More recently, Äkyantho&#x27;, the god of foreigners, has become more prominent. This god, Äkyantho&#x27;, is described as a light-skinned god that wears a hat and carries a pistol. Äkyantho&#x27; is responsible for trade, medicine, diseases, some animals (horses for example), and metal tools. He has a son named Hesuklistos (Jesus Christ) who is supposed to be the god of the foreigners. This is expressive of the Lacandón cultural conservatism and adaptability, in that they fit new gods into their world view. They recognize that Hesuklistos is a god but do not feel he is worthy of worship as he is a minor god.

===Ceremonial buildings, sacred places, and objects of ritual practice===
Most Lacandon villages have a God House where ceremonies take place. Some are located near the religious leaders abode or close to the home of a well-respected or elderly male. Some villages hide the God House away from the village in the jungle so that outsiders are unable to find them. Often these sites are also guarded and even shielded with vegetation so that the rituals performed inside cannot be seen. The God House is built very low to the ground so that it is hard to see into and it is oriented to North, South, East, and West with the entrance on the east side where it faces toward Maya ruins and the sunrise. Inside the God House are the necessities used for various ceremonies. These include drums suspended in the ceiling so they don&#x27;t touch the ground until they are needed for ritual song and dance; a fire starter traditionally consisting of a fire drill (two sticks) and more recently a lighter, matches or flint; benches to sit around; ceramic bowls for preparing and eating ritual meals or offerings; a conch shell “trumpet” to announce the beginning of a ceremony for both villagers and the gods; a large hollowed trough to make the alcohol Balché for ritual consumption; and most importantly the God House contains rubber characters, incense nodules (made of copal), and ceramic God pots used to burn the offerings for the rituals. Sacred places included caves (where the sun went to the underworld each night), Maya ruins where the Gods had once resided, next to rivers, rock outcroppings or particular places in the jungle (there would not be any cutting of vegetation in these areas). These places are often remote, secret, and not to be viewed by outsiders.

God pots are small ceramic bowls that have the head and face of the deity they represent attached to the rim of the pot, often with the head tilted back so that incense or offerings may be placed directly on it. These pots are fired in the open and coated with a mixture of clay, lime, and water and then painted with red or black dyes. The pots have specific masculine or feminine designs including whether the head had straight (male) or braided (female) hair and whether the pot was striped (male) or checked (female). In addition, pots used for rituals are considered to be alive and to have a soul. To bring life to a God pot the Lacandón would use small pebbles they found at Maya ruins that they considered sacred. They would also use cacao beans for the purpose of giving the pot a “heart”. Each God pot was made for a particular deity or ritual and if they remained in good condition they sometimes were given from father to son. When a god pot became full with incense, burnt offerings, or was broken, there would be a renewal ceremony to replace it. The old pot would be taken to a sacred place and left and then new ceramic incense burners and figurines were made (usually to be discarded later) as they created a new pot to take the place of the old.

===Offerings, rituals, and beliefs===
Offerings burnt in the God pots included incense, food, and rubber figurines. The food was often thought to sustain the Gods and keep order in the universe. The figurines were made of sap from the Castilla elastica tree, which was seen as blood from the tree and is thought to represent the blood sacrifices in some of the Lacandon ceremonies. These figurines were usually in the form of humans with specific body parts clearly represented but at times were also in the form of animals. Part of the belief of the Lacandón entailed the Gods being able to partake in the offerings in the God pot by the figurine being burned in the God pot and becoming a messenger for the particular God invoked. The smoke of the offering was seen as the essence, or soul (pixan) which is consumable by the gods. Ultimately, there is not a great understanding of the exact meaning of the anthropomorphic rubber figures though the symbolism appears to be representative of human sacrifice. It is known that the rubber figures would be splattered with red annatto dye before being burnt and that at sometime before the 19th century it was common for the Lacandón to participate in bloodletting where they would cut their earlobe or septum and smear the figurine with blood before burning it. The belief was that the God could be sustained from the smoke of the burning blood. Other beliefs, which signify a potential history of human sacrifice, include some Gods preferring human flesh and sacrificing other Gods and also that at the end of the world the Gods would sacrifice humans and would paint their houses with the blood of the humans. The behavior of the Gods being similar to that of humans may point toward cannibalism and human sacrifice among the Lacandón historically though these practices were non-existent or unknown by the 20th century.

Other practices may have included ancestor worship as god pots and incense burners have been found at burial sites. Reports of cremation burials (Baer and Baer, 1952) exist as well as ritual links to astronomy and dream interpretation. Not much is known about these practices. A specific belief regarding the god Akyantho’ is that he had first given the Lacandón tools, medicine, animals, liquor, and other trade associated items but then took them away and gave them to foreigners because they were taking better care of these items. As a punishment for their irresponsibility, the Lacandón had to interact with the foreigners in order to obtain what they needed. In addition, the Lacandón believed that their Gods had once dwelled in the ruins along with their ancestors. Many rituals were performed at these sites as evidenced by the numerous god pots found throughout. Breaking any of the rocks or damaging the buildings of the ruins was seen as disrespecting the Gods. Often these places were guarded but the increasing interruption of ceremonies along with the damaging of the sites and the god pots there forced the Lacandón back into the jungles to perform their rituals privately. Didier Boremanse, in the book &quot;South and Meso-American Native Spirituality&quot;, gives some detailed accounts of specific rituals that he witnessed (pp. 324–351).

==External influences==
While the Lacandón have recently seen an influx of outside influence with the coming of roads, logging, tourism, and other modernizations, it is important to recognize that they have had contact with outsiders throughout their history. It should also be noted that the Lacandón were often the initiators of contact with foreigners (including other Mayan groups). Outside contact was usually facilitated by trade and religious conversion. If we examine photographs and drawings of the Lacandón dating from the late 19th century, we can see that their clothing and personal adornments have changed considerably. These valuable historical images show that cultural change has been taking place among the Lacandón for a long time.

The Lacandón have sometimes gone into nearby towns to participate in Catholic mass or other rituals performed by priests. The ritual of baptism was of particular interest, possibly because they perceived a cleansing and therapeutic value for that ritual. Initially, attempts by capuchin priests and other missionaries to Christianize the Lacandón were unsuccessful. The priests repeatedly tried to emphasize the importance of monogamy in their religion, which may have led to the initial general non-acceptance of the religion. Polygyny was seen by the male Lacandón as a way to ensure labor and economic power, retain ritual knowledge in food preparation, and maintain fertility among wives at different times. The Christian religion provided somewhat of a break for Lacandón women because there was no need for the exhaustive process and knowledge base of preparing ritual foods for ceremonies. Because of this, and their exclusion from the traditional ceremonies other than cooking, many Lacandón women asked their husbands to convert to Christianity.

As mentioned earlier, the geographic differences among the Lacandón may have influenced the rate at which Christian conversion occurred. It is noted that the lowland Lacandón have all but abandoned the historical religion while those in the highlands still practice some traditional rituals. The need for privacy for the rites to be performed and outsider interruption likely has something to do with this as well. The use of music and dance has also decreased in ritual behavior inexplicably since ethnographers began studying the Lacandón. Today, it is possible to buy god pots made by the Lacandón specifically for tourists. These pots are not painted and have not been given “souls” and therefore are not alive and can be sold. Jon McGee (2002) notes that increased participation in a monetary economy because of tourists has decreased the need for subsistence agriculture and with it the religious rites associated with agriculture. Other changes include the simplification of god pot designs, the non-existence of once very important pilgrimages to particular sites (because they have been desecrated), disappearance of bloodletting, and rarity of polygyny. Besides the influence of outsiders, these changes can also be attributed to deaths of the elders and knowledgeable persons who practiced the rituals through old age and often disease. Information was not passed on to younger generations, which opened a place for Christian missionaries to convert more Lacandón. For this reason Protestantism is the dominant religion of the lowland Lacandón today. John McGee (2002) has noted that within four years of the introduction of television, traditional ritual practices among the highland Lacandón has been reduced to just two families and one individual. Many others no longer participate in any religion at this point.

==Economy==
The historic Lacandón were neither strictly hunter-gatherers nor swidden agriculturalists, but rather, they were both as they saw fit. Likewise, they were at one time either mobile or sedentary. The Lacandón would make clearings in the forest to raise crops and some livestock, but they would also hunt and fish, and gather roots and plants in the jungle. As such, they had no need for a structured economy, as they relied on their own homesteads as their source of sustenance. The more contact that the Lacandón had with other people, the more their economy morphed.

The historic Lacandón would at times trade with outsiders, but there is little to no documentation regarding this contact. What trade was documented showed that it was the most contact the Lacandón had with the outside world at the time. They traded animals, honey, beeswax, tobacco, cotton, and cacao for much-needed metal tools. As time progressed into the 19th and 20h centuries, the goods the Lacandón were given during trade became more advanced, such as firearms, kerosene, coffee, sugar, and clothing among other things. There is evidence that showed that some Lacandón kept regular trade with ranches in Chiapas, and through contact learned languages such as Spanish, Ch&#x27;ol, and Tzeltal Maya. This allowed the Lacandón to more easily understand Tzeltal Maya culture and Christianity.

To the Lacandón, trade with foreigners was the most vital, and once only way for them to come into contact with the outside world, and for them to obtain things that they themselves cannot produce. Throughout time one can see the advancement of technology reaching the Lacandón. The increased trade in the 19th century also influenced change in the Lacandón subsistence. They started raising chickens, cultivating oranges, plantains, sugar cane, and instead of hunting with bows and arrows, were hunting with rifles.

Some Lacandón would gain employment from in logging camps, and others would receive payment from logging camps for rights to log in their jungle. By the end of the 19th century and beginning of the twentieth, tourists would come to the Lacandón villages and purchase material items like gourd bowls, bows, and arrowheads.

As other indigenous people were given land in the Lacandón Jungle, the common practice of subsistence farming was replaced by semi commercial agriculture of the new people that were given land in the area. This was further influenced by the national government&#x27;s encouragement of the development of commercial farming, and not the typical slash and burn practices that were historically common in the area. In addition to that, rapid deforestation of the Lacandón Jungle due to cattle grazing led the Lacandón to move from their dispersed settlements to more centralized communities, thus shifting their economic practices. In the early 1970s, oil developments in Tabasco put money into Chiapas, and allowed for the Mexican government to set up a Rain forest reserve, preventing areas of the Lacandón Jungle from being used by logging companies. However, after gaining control of the local extension of the Florida-based logging company Weiss Fricker Mahogany Company, the Mexican government organization Nacional Financiera, S.A. (NAFINSA), which controlled the revenue generated by logging in the Lacandón Jungle. A state-controlled company, the Compañia Forestal de la Lacandon S.A., was created to contract Lacandón communities for logging rights of their land. Unfortunately, NAFINSA controlled most of the royalties made by the company, 70%, as opposed to the 30% that the Lacandón communities received.

Following the oil price crash in the early 1980s, the value of the peso dropped dramatically, which made international tourism even more attractive. Though this affected the economy of the Lacandón adversely, it presented an opportunity for them to gain. Lacandón men would dedicate a good amount of their free time towards manufacturing arts and crafts, and then selling their goods to tourists in the larger towns in Chiapas, like Palenque. In 1980, a road was built to connect Palenque with the Lacandón community of Nahá. This allowed tourist traffic to flow into Lacandón communities, and the Lacandón merchant selling material goods no longer had to travel for days, but rather set up his shop along the road, and could carry more items with the advent of vehicular travel in the area.

One of the biggest items sold to tourists are hunting kits - bows and arrows. Men making these bows and arrows transitioned from acquiring the materials from the jungle themselves, to just buying the materials and focused strictly on the production of the bows and arrows. These are usually sold at the Maya ruins at Palenque and range in sizes - from full adult sizes to child-sized toys kits.

The historical Lacandón needed to rely on only themselves. But as they came into contact with other people, and Mexico became a more unified state, their economy shifted towards a more dependent one, thriving on increased trade with other local people and eventually were introduced with international trade.

==Geography and land use==
The Lacandón became associated as being isolated from other groups, a fact which was facilitated largely by the geographical setting in which they lived. The geography led many to be discouraged from venturing into the Lacandón lands, and the result was that the Lacandón people were never completely “conquered” as was the case with other indigenous groups in Mesoamerica. The rugged terrain and thick forests which characterize the Lacandón lands in the eastern sector of the present-day Mexican state of Chiapas (see map at) acted somewhat as a barrier to social interaction outside of the small and dispersed groups in which the Lacandón lived from pre-Conquest times up to the 20th century.

The southern Maya lowlands which are home to the Lacandón are characterized by rugged karstic topography and sub-tropical rainforest, known as the Selva Lacandona, or the Lacandon Forest. Several rivers feed into the eastern Chiapas region, such as the Pasión, San Pedro Martir, Lacantún, Jataté, Usumacinta, and Chixoy. The rivers, along with many lakes, swamps and shorelines, contribute to the diversity of the Lacandón lands. The availability of various types of flora and fauna which inhabit these aquatic and terrestrial areas have allowed the Lacandón to thrive in a geographical setting which at first glance appears to be hostile to humans. In order to take full advantage of their resources, the Lacandón have used specific agricultural, hunting and gathering techniques which have been designed to be conservative of the land and ecozone as a whole, which allows for sustainable use and therefore continued yield in the future. 20% of the approximately 700 Lacandón people living today continue to use such techniques.

James Nations recognizes four zones which the Lacandón utilize to maintain a diverse food supply and healthy diet. The primary or old growth forest consists of small portions of tropical rain forest and lower mountainous rain forest, which constitutes the majority of the forest ecosystem. While the growth in this type of rainforest is not quite as tall as that seen in a tropical rainforest, the two largely share the same characteristics (see interactive map at and map at). The primary growth forest provides hunting for the Lacandón, as deer, peccary, agouti, and monkeys inhabit the area. The Lacandón also utilize the many different plant species in the rainforest for various purposes, including dietary and medicinal; the medicinal use of plants is well-developed amongst the Lacandón and is important in their culture. This zone is also very important for the maintenance of rich and stable soil, of which the Lacandón take advantage in their milpa systems, the second zone.

The milpa, or farmed field, is crucial to the survival of the Lacandón people. Here, they utilize sustainable slash and burn techniques to ensure the continued richness of the soils of the milpa and health of the region in general. The Lacandón people engage in swidden agriculture on a primary or secondary growth forest in January, February or March, and allow the remains to dry until April. During this time, fire breaks are also put into place so as to keep the coming burn from catching other parts of the forest on fire. The firing occurs in April and planting begins soon thereafter. Different crops are grown together in the milpa amongst each other, such that plants of a single crop are separated from one another and surrounded by different crops. Also, tree species (bananas, plantains, etc.) are interspersed amongst maize and vine plants such as squash and chiles, and root crops are cultivated in the ground under these. Plants are harvested in November or December after the rainy season which begins in May or June. This cycle will be repeated for 2 to 5 years, at which time the milpa will be replanted with trees and allowed to be repopulated with wild forest plant species (this zone is then referred to as an acahual). After 5 to 7 years, the land will be used as a milpa again. After this second period of time used as a milpa, however, the land will be replanted with trees and allowed to develop into a mature secondary forest (at least 20 years), at which time it will be used as a milpa again.

The third zone, as mentioned above, is the acahual. The Lacandón farmers replant the milpa in tree crops such as rubber or fruit and reap the direct benefits from the plants. The Lacandón also use the acahual as a type of hunting ground, as the animals discussed above frequent the acahaul to graze or eat.

The last major zone in the Lacandón lands is that which is near water, such as river banks, stream beds, swamps, and shorelines. The aquatic areas provide the Lacandón with additional sources of protein and a different nutrient base from that which is provided by the terrestrial zones. The people use a specific type of snail species (&quot;Pachychilus&quot; spp.) known locally as t’unu as a type of protein supplement to their diet. In addition, the shells from this organism provide great nutritional value, as they provide calcium and lime when burned. The lime is then added to maize to release amino acids such as tryptophan and lysine and the vitamin niacin, which would otherwise be unavailable from the maize (unable to be metabolized) if the lime were not added.

By utilizing the primary forest, milpas, acahuales and aquatic areas, the Lacandón have been able to provide a healthy diet for themselves which has contributed to their ongoing survival.

==Archaeology==
Three sites have been excavated and yielded artifacts that are historically Lacandón, El Caobal, Matamangos and El Magal. The location of these abandoned Lacandón sites have been passed down through generations of fathers taking their sons to the sites for hunting or exploring. The locals who had traveled there as children are the last informants who know the location of the Lacandón settlements. Since the Lacandón did not typically build “stone-and-earth” platforms it is almost impossible to find their lost settlements, making the knowledge of the elder locals crucial.

Each site yielded different artifacts, some proved evidence of a home or residences, others may have been manufacturing sites. All show strong evidence of Lacandón inhabitance. The easiest characteristic of Lacandón settlement to spot is the presence of non-native vegetation such as fruit trees. Another being traditional Lacandón pottery. The ceramic vessels found at all of the sites were dark brown and black with dark clouding on both the inside and outside and had a hemispherical shape. The hemispherical shape mimicked the familiar shape of the gourd vessels that were also very important. The gourds had a practical form and were used often for ritual food and drink. The rims of the ceramic vessels were squared off, as if they had been cut with a knife before being fired. Unlike Lacandón gourd bowls, which were typically decorated with carved designs, the ceramic vessels had no designs or adornments. This might have shown some insight as to why they were left behind, perhaps they were so simple and easily produced that they were left behind and new vessels were made after the tribe migrated to a new location.

The first site discovered near the ruins of Dos Pilas was El Caobal, located on raised terrain and surrounded by swamp. In Spanish, means “place or abundance of mahogany trees,” this refers to the large concentration of them which most likely due to planting by the Lacandón who relied on them for canoes and also because mahogany trees are not indigenous. El Caobal also has a large amount of mango and banana trees, which are also non-native, which were planted by the Lacandón as a source of food. Beneath the jungle floor laid hundreds of artifacts including pottery, stone tools, metal pots and broken glass to name a few. Some of the artifacts were brought up by root action or a metal detector located and others were found from blind digs. The abundance of artifacts suggests the location a home or possibly a discard zone. The local artifacts that were found included utilitarian ceramics and stone tools, imported items consisted of white earthenware vessels with painted designs, glass bottles and metal tools.

At Matamangos, the site approximately one kilometer from El Caobal is identified by its abundance of mango trees (again showing that non-indigenous vegetation points to settlement). Matamangos was also on slightly raised ground and was located near a small group of Maya house mounds. After deciding to dig near one of the largest mango trees large amounts of chert debris such as chert cores, arrowheads and small blades were uncovered, another object that is characteristically Lacandón. Chert was a hard stone that the Lacandón used to make arrowheads and other lithic tools. A large piece of chert (also called a core) would first be heated and then bone is struck with a round hammerstone (made of volcanic rock) against the core, using indirect percussion fragments were chipped off to make prismatic chert blades. A hammerstone (probably imported from the Guatemalan highlands) was also found nearby the chert fragments. The stone was identified as being a hammerstone because of its smooth and rounded from use and fits comfortably in the hand and has scratches and chips from use. The uncovering of these related artifacts suggests possibly a tool manufacturing area or a discard site.

Known as El Mangal or “place of many mango trees” by the locals, this site has trees that were much larger than those at Caobal or Matamangos. The area also had a lagoon that was known on regional maps as “El Mangal” (showing a knowledge of the area by people other than the locals). The water in the lagoon is not good for drinking or cooking but it useful for washing and catching fish. A current family has made residence at El Mangal and has unearthed a whole machete, they also found pieces of thick, hard, brown pottery (traditional Lacandón ceramic). While digging a trash pit the family found more pottery, although it was not the traditional smooth bowls that had been found at El Caobal, they were still ethnographically Lacandón. The vessels were identified as incense burners. The shape was hemispherical with a ring base and a hole for venting the fire and releasing smoke. Unlike the smooth ceramics used for everyday life, these vessels were adorned with the modeled head of a deity on the rim, proving this object is used for religious rites. The modeled heads “closely resemble those made by the ethnographic Lacandon.” Other decorations include incised lines and holes down the front of the bowl and protruding spikes. These vessels were used in “God houses” for religious purposes. During the Lacandón incense burner renewal ceremony men isolated themselves from the community and crafted the burners in solitude. They were placed in the god house and the old burners were deposited at a sacred place in the forest. The presence of these incense burners points possibly to a religious god house, a manufacturing site or even a sacred place of disposal.

<text>The sunbittern (Eurypyga helias) is a bittern-like bird of tropical regions of the Americas, and the sole member of the family Eurypygidae (sometimes spelled Eurypigidae) and genus Eurypyga. It is found in Central and South America, and has three subspecies. The sunbittern shows both morphological and molecular similarities with the kagu (&quot;Rhynochetos jubatus&quot;) of New Caledonia, indicating a Gondwanan origin, both species being placed in the clade Eurypygiformes.

==Taxonomy==

The sunbittern was traditionally placed in the Gruiformes, but this was always considered preliminary. Altogether, the bird is most similar to another bird that was provisionally placed in the Gruiformes, the kagu (&quot;Rhynochetos jubatus&quot;). Molecular studies seem to confirm that the kagu and sunbittern are each other&#x27;s closest living relatives and have a similar wing display. They are probably not Gruiformes (though the proposed Metaves are just as weakly supported). Altogether, the two species seem to form a minor Gondwanan lineage which could also include the extinct adzebills and/or the mesites, and is of unclear relation to the Gruiformes proper. Notably, the kagu and mesites also have powder down.

An indeterminate fossil eurypygid has been documented from the Green River Formation of Wyoming, USA. This specimen, known from a full skeleton, is the oldest and only known fossil of the group, and suggests that eurypygids had a much more northernly range in the past. This specimen has been figured in several studies, and was given the unofficial name &quot;Eoeurypyga olsoni&quot; in a 2003 dissertation, but as-of-yet remains unnamed.

===Subspecies===
The sunbittern was formerly treated as two species (&quot;E. helias&quot; and &quot;E. major&quot;), but now they are treated as a single species with considerable variation between the subspecies. The three subspecies are recognised on the basis of plumage characters and size. The three subspecies are allopatric.

* &quot;E. h. helias&quot; – Amazonian sunbittern
* &quot;E. h. major&quot; – northern sunbittern
* &quot;E. h. meridionalis&quot; – foothill sunbittern

==Description==

The bird has a generally subdued coloration, with fine linear patterns of black, grey and brown. Its remiges however have vividly colored middle webs, which with wings fully spread show bright eyespots in red, yellow, and black. These are shown to other sunbitterns in courtship and threat displays, or used to startle potential predators. Male and female adult sunbitterns can be differentiated by small differences in the feather patterns of the throat and head. Like some other birds, the sunbittern has powder down.

The sunbittern has a long and pointed bill that is black above, and a short hallux as in shorebirds and rails. In the South American subspecies found in lowlands east of the Andes, the upperparts are mainly brown, and the legs and lower mandible are orange-yellow. The two other subspecies are greyer above, and their legs and bill are sometimes redder.

==Distribution and habitat==
The sunbittern&#x27;s range extends from Guatemala to Brazil. The nominate race, &quot;E. h. helias&quot;, is found east of the Andes in lowland tropical South America, from the Orinoco basin, through the Amazon basin and Pantanal. The subspecies &quot;E. h. meridionalis&quot;, has a more restricted distribution, being found along the East Andean slope in south-central Peru, in the lower subtropical zone at altitudes of . The final subspecies, &quot;E. h. major&quot;, is found at various altitudes ranging from southern Guatemala, through Central America and the Chocó to western Ecuador. This subspecies may also be present in southern Mexico. It has been traditionally reported from the Atlantic slope of Chiapas, but no specimens are known and there have been no recent records.

The species is found in the humid Neotropical forests, generally with an open understorey and near rivers, streams, ponds or lagoons.

==Behaviour and ecology==
They are cryptic birds that display their large wings, that exhibits a pattern that resemble eyes, when they feel threatened.

===Feeding===
The sunbittern consumes a wide range of animal prey. Insects form an important part of the diet, with cockroaches, dragonfly larvae, flies, katydids, water beetles and moths being taken. Other invertebrate prey includes crabs, spiders, shrimps and earthworms. They will also take vertebrate prey including fish, tadpoles, toads and frogs, eels and lizards.

Sunbitterns are one of 12 species of birds in five families that have been described as fishing using baits or lures to attract prey to within striking distance. This type of behaviour falls within the common definition of tool use. In sunbitterns this behaviour has only been observed in captive birds so far.

===Breeding===

Sunbitterns start nesting in the early wet season and before it starts they make flight displays high in the forest canopy. They build open nests in trees, and lay two eggs with blotched markings. The young are precocial, but remain in the nest for several weeks after hatching.

<text>The Decembrist Revolt () was a failed coup d&#x27;état led by liberal military and political dissidents against the Russian Empire. It took place in Saint Petersburg on , following the death of Emperor Alexander I.

Alexander&#x27;s brother and heir-presumptive Grand Duke Konstantin Pavlovich privately renounced his claim to the throne two years prior to Alexander&#x27;s sudden death on 1 December O.S. 19 November] 1825. The next in the line of succession therefore was younger brother Nicholas, who would ascend to the throne as Emperor Nicholas I. Neither the Russian government nor the general public were initially aware of Konstantin&#x27;s renunciation, and as a result, parts of the military took a premature oath of loyalty to Konstantin. A general swearing of loyalty to the true emperor Nicholas was scheduled for in Senate Square, Saint Petersburg.

In the midst of this confusing transition into Nicholas&#x27; reign, the Northern Society, a secret society of liberal revolutionaries, nobles, and military officials, organized a conspiracy to replace the Russian Empire&#x27;s autocratic regime with a constitutional monarchy. To seize control of the government and implement a regime change, it sought to convince the military that Nicholas was usurping the throne from Konstantin. On 26 December, Northern Society members led a force of approximately 3,000 troops into Senate Square to prevent the loyalty-swearing ceremony and to rally additional soldiers and officers to their cause. This group of rebels, although disorganized due to indecision and dissension among its leaders, confronted troops loyal to Nicholas outside the Senate building in the presence of a large civilian crowd. A standoff ensued, during which Nicholas&#x27; envoy, Mikhail Miloradovich, was assassinated. The loyalists eventually opened fire with heavy artillery, scattering the rebels. In the aftermath of the coup attempt, 5 rebellion leaders were sentenced to hanging, many other participants were imprisoned, or exiled to Siberia. The individuals who participated in the conspiracy and coup attempt became known as the &quot;Decembrists&quot; ().

==Union of Salvation and Union of Prosperity==
At first, many officers were encouraged by Tsar Alexander I&#x27;s early liberal reformation of Russian society and politics. Liberalism was encouraged on an official level, creating high expectations during the period of rapprochement between Napoleon and Alexander. The major advocate for reform in Alexander&#x27;s regime was Count Mikhail Mikhailovich Speransky. During his early years in the regime, Speransky helped inspire the organization of the Ministry of the Interior, the reform of ecclesiastic education, and strengthening the government&#x27;s role in the country&#x27;s economic development. Speransky&#x27;s role increased greatly in 1808. From then until 1812, when they feared him as a liberal similar to Napoleon and his invasion, Speransky developed plans for the reorganization of Russia&#x27;s government. Because of increasing hostility, he was forced to flee into exile.

Returning from exile in 1819, Speransky was appointed as the governor of Siberia, with the task of reforming local government. In 1818, the tsar asked Count Nikolay Nikolayevich Novosiltsev to draw up a constitution. The abolition of serfdom in the Baltic provinces was instituted between 1816 and 1819. However, internal and external unrest, which the tsar believed stemmed from political liberalization, led to a series of repressions and a return to a former government of restraint and conservatism.

Meanwhile, the experiences of the Napoleonic Wars and realization of the suffering of peasant soldiers resulted in Decembrist officers and sympathizers being attracted to reform changes in society. They displayed their contempt of court by rejecting the court lifestyle, wearing their cavalry swords at balls (to indicate their unwillingness to dance), and committing themselves to academic study. These new practices captured the spirit of the times as a willingness by the Decembrists to embrace both the peasant (i.e., the fundamental Russian people) and ongoing reform movements from intellectuals abroad.

Pavel Pestel identified reasons for reform:
Historians have noted that the United States Declaration of Independence and the American Revolution may also have influenced Decembrists, as they did other nations. The constitution written by Nikita Muravyov was highly similar to the United States Constitution. But the Decembrists were against slavery in the United States. They worked to free any slaves and serfs from all countries in Russia immediately. Pestel and his followers opposed the United States&#x27; federal model in peaceful times as threatening to the would-be Russian/United Slavic federation; they only approved the US revolutionary model. While agreeing with Pestel that the American revolutionary model could be the best form for Russia, the Polish patriotic society would not agree to participate in establishing a federation. They wanted a United States-style republic or other state, with Lithuania, Belarus and Ukraine to be included in a unitary Poland (i.e., more or less the territory of the former Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth), without any Russian involvement in the affairs of these territories.

In 1816, several officers of the Imperial Russian Guard founded a society known as the Union of Salvation, or of the Faithful and True Sons of the Fatherland. The society acquired a revolutionary cast after it was joined by the idealistic Pavel Pestel. The charter was similar to charters of the organizations of &quot;carbonari.&quot; Pestel was supported by Yakushkin when there were rumors that the emperor had intended to transfer the capital from Saint Petersburg to Warsaw, and to liberate all peasants without the consent of Russian landlords. They would not be able to influence a government based in Warsaw. Yakushkin intended to kill the emperor even before the revolution. When the society consisting of Russian landlords had refused to kill the emperor based on such rumors, Yakushkin left the society. The more liberal Mikhail Muravyov-Vilensky created a new charter similar to that of Tugendbund. It did not have revolutionary plans and the society was called the Union of Prosperity. It was still considered illegal and similar to masonic lodges. (The small Order of Russian knights, excepting its prominent member Alexander von Benckendorff, also joined the Union of Prosperity, together with the members of the Union of Salvation.)

After a mutiny in the Semenovsky Regiment in 1820, the society decided to suspend activity in 1821. Two groups, however, continued to function secretly: a Southern Society, based at Tulchin, a small garrison town in Ukraine, in which Pestel was the outstanding figure, and a Northern Society, based at Saint Petersburg, led by guard officers Nikita Muraviev, Prince S. P. Trubetskoy and Prince Eugene Obolensky. The political aims of the more moderate Northern Society were a British-style constitutional monarchy with a limited franchise. They envisioned that it could be replaced with a republic in the future but only according to the will of the people. They also believed there should be a legislative assembly and did not call for the execution of the imperial family. They supported the abolition of serfdom, according to the interests of Russian landlords, i.e. with land to be retained by landlords, in a style similar to the abolition of serfdom in Baltic provinces. They also supported equality before the law. The Southern Society, under Pestel&#x27;s influence, was more radical and wanted to abolish the monarchy, establish a republic, similar to the Union of Salvation, and contrary to the Union of Salvation plans, to redistribute land, taking half into state ownership and dividing the rest among the peasants. The Society of United Slavs (also known as the Slavic Union – Pan-Slavism) was established in Novohrad-Volynsky (now Zviahel) in Ukraine in 1823. Its never-written program was similar to that of the Southern Society but the main emphasis was on the equal federation of Russia (including Ukraine), Poland, Moldavia (including Bessarabia) with the attachment of Wallachia, Transylvania, Hungary (including Slovakia, Slovenia, Vojvodina, the Carpatho-Ukraine aka Zakarpattia), Croatia, Serbia, Dalmatia, the Czech lands of Bohemia and Moravia, i.e. all Slavic &amp; Vlach countries with the exception of Bulgaria and Macedonia, in the future. This society joined the Southern Society and adopted its program in exchange for the recognition of the Slavic federation zeal by the Southern society in September 1825.

==At Senate Square==
When Emperor Alexander I died on , the royal guards swore allegiance to the presumed successor, Alexander&#x27;s brother Konstantin. When Konstantin made his renunciation public, and Nicholas stepped forward to assume the throne, the Northern Society acted. With the capital in temporary confusion, and one oath to Konstantin having already been sworn, the society scrambled in secret meetings to convince regimental leaders not to swear allegiance to Nicholas. These efforts culminated in the Decembrist Revolt. The leaders of the society elected Prince Sergei Trubetskoy as interim ruler.

On the morning of , a group of officers commanding about 3,000 men (elements of Life-Guards Moscow Regiment, Grenadier Life Guards Regiment, and Naval Equipage of the Guard) assembled in Senate Square, where they refused to swear allegiance to the new tsar, Nicholas I, proclaiming instead their loyalty to Konstantin. They expected to be joined by the rest of the troops stationed in Saint Petersburg, but they were disappointed. The revolt was hampered when it was deserted by its supposed leader Prince Trubetskoy. His second-in-command, Colonel Bulatov, also vanished from the scene. After a hurried consultation, the rebels appointed Prince Eugene Obolensky as a replacement leader.

For hours, there was a stand-off between the 3,000 rebels and the 9,000 loyal troops stationed outside the Senate building, with some desultory shooting from the rebel side. A vast crowd of civilian on-lookers began fraternizing with the rebels but did not join the action. Eventually, Nicholas (the new tsar) appeared in person at the square and sent Count Mikhail Miloradovich to parley with the rebels. Miloradovich was fatally shot in the back by Pyotr Kakhovsky while delivering a public address, then stabbed by Yevgeny Obolensky. At the same time, a rebelling squad of grenadiers, led by Lieutenant Nikolay Panov, entered the Winter Palace but failed to seize it and retreated.

After spending most of the day in fruitless attempts to parley with the rebel force, Nicholas ordered a cavalry charge by Her Sovereign Majesty Empress Maria Theodorovna&#x27;s Chevalier Guard Regiment that slipped on the icy cobbles and retired in disorder. Eventually, at the end of the day, Nicholas ordered three artillery pieces to open fire with grapeshot ammunition to devastating effect. To avoid the slaughter, the rebels broke and ran. Some attempted to regroup on the frozen surface of the river Neva to the north. However, they were targeted by the artillery and suffered many casualties. As the ice was broken by the cannon fire, many sank. The revolt in the north came to an end. There was a rumor that during the nighttime, police and loyal army units were detached to clean the city and the Neva river, as many of the dead, dying, and wounded had been cast into it.

==Arrests and trial==

While the Northern Society scrambled in the days leading up to the revolt, the Southern Society (based in Tulchin) took a serious blow. The day before (), acting on reports of treason, the police arrested Pavel Pestel. It took two weeks for the Southern Society to learn of the events in the capital. Meanwhile, other members of the leadership were arrested. The Southern Society, and a nationalistic group called the United Slavs, discussed revolt. When learning of the location of some of the arrested men, the United Slavs freed them by force. One of the freed men, Sergey Muravyov-Apostol, assumed leadership of the revolt. After converting the soldiers of Vasilkov to the cause, Muraviev-Apostol easily captured the city. The rebelling army was confronted by superior forces that were heavily armed with artillery loaded with grapeshot.

The following people were brought to trial: from the Northern Society - 61 people, from the Southern Society - 37 people, from the United Slavs - 23 people. The court sentenced: to death - five by quartering, 31 - by beheading, 17 - to cashiering, 16 - to lifelong exile with hard labor, 5 - to exile with hard labor for 10 years, 15 - to exile with hard labor for 6 years, 15 - to exile to a settlement, 3 - to deprivation of ranks, nobility and exile to Siberia, 1 to deprivation of ranks and nobility and demotion to soldier without seniority, 8 to deprivation of ranks with demotion to soldiers with seniority. Even before the verdict was pronounced, the court did not intend to apply any other punishment to the Decembrists than hanging.

About 120 members of secret societies were subjected to extrajudicial repressions (imprisonment in a fortress, demotion, transfer to the active army in the Caucasus, transfer under police supervision). The cases of the enlised soldiers who participated in the uprising were examined by Special Commissions: 178 were sentenced to run the gauntlet, 23 were sentenced to other types of corporal punishment. The rest, about four thousand men, were formed into a combined guards regiment and sent to the Caucasian theater of military operations.

==Decembrists in Siberia==
On , the first party of Decembrist convicts began its exodus to Siberia. Among this group were Prince Trubetskoi, Prince Obolensky, Peter and Andrei Borisov, Prince Volkonsky, and Artamon Muraviev, all of them bound for the mines at Nerchinsk. The journey eastward was fraught with hardship, yet for some it offered refreshing changes in scenery and peoples following imprisonment. Decembrist Nikolay Vasil&#x27;yevich Basargin was unwell when he set out from Saint Petersburg, but he recovered his strength on the move; his memoirs depict the journey to Siberia in a cheerful light, full of praise for the &quot;common people&quot; and commanding landscapes.

Not all Decembrists could identify with Basargin&#x27;s positive experience. Because of their lower social standing, &quot;soldier-Decembrists&quot; experienced the emperor&#x27;s vengeance in full. Sentenced by court-martial, many of these &quot;commoners&quot; received thousands of lashes. Those that survived went to Siberia on foot, chained alongside common criminals.

Fifteen out of 124 Decembrists were convicted of &quot;state-crimes&quot; by the Supreme Criminal Court, and sentenced to &quot;exile-to-settlement&quot;. These men were sent directly to isolated locales, such as Berezov, Narym, Surgut, Pelym, Irkutsk, Yakutsk, and Vilyuysk, among others. Few Russians inhabited these places: The populations consisted mainly of Siberian aborigines, such as Tunguses, Yakuts, Tatars, Ostyaks, Mongols, and Buryats.

Of all those exiled, the largest group of prisoners was sent to Chita, Zabaykalsky Krai, transferred three years later to Petrovsky Zavod, near Nerchinsk. This group, sentenced to hard labor, included principal leaders of the Decembrist movement as well as the members of the United Slavs. Siberian Governor-General Lavinsky argued that it was easiest to control a large, concentrated group of convicts, and Emperor Nicholas I pursued this policy in order to maximize surveillance and to limit revolutionaries&#x27; contact with local populations. Concentration facilitated the guarding of prisoners, but it also allowed the Decembrists to continue to exist as a community. This was especially true at Chita. The move to Petrovsky Zavod, however, forced Decembrists to divide into smaller groups; the new location was compartmentalized with an oppressive sense of order. Convicts could no longer congregate casually. Although nothing could destroy the Decembrists&#x27; conception of fraternity, Petrovsky Zavod forced them to live more private lives. Owing to a number of imperial sentence reductions, exiles started to complete their labor terms years ahead of schedule. The labor was of minimal travail; Stanislav Leparsky, commandant of Petrovsky Zavod, failed to enforce Decembrists&#x27; original labor sentences, and criminal convicts carried out much of the work in place of the revolutionaries. Most Decembrists left Petrovsky Zavod between 1835 and 1837, settling in or near Irkutsk, Minusinsk, Kurgan, Tobol&#x27;sk, Turinsk, and Yalutorovsk. Those Decembrists who had already lived in or visited Siberia, such as Dimitri Zavalishin, prospered upon leaving Petrovsky Zavod&#x27;s confines, but most found it physically arduous and more psychologically unnerving than prison life.

The Siberian population met the Decembrists with great hospitality. Natives played central roles in keeping lines of communication open among Decembrists, friends, and relatives. Most merchants and state employees were also sympathetic. To the masses, the Decembrist exiles were &quot;generals who had refused to take the oath to Nicholas I.&quot; They were great figures that had suffered political persecution for their loyalty to the people. On the whole, indigenous Siberian populations greatly respected the Decembrists and were extremely hospitable in their reception of them.

Upon arrival at places of settlement, exiles had to comply with extensive regulations under a strict governmental regime. Local police watched, regulated, and notated every move that Decembrists attempted to make. Dimitri Zavalishin was thrown into prison for failing to remove his hat before a lieutenant. Not only were political and social activities carefully monitored and prevented, there was interference regarding religious convictions. Local clergy accused Prince Shakhovskoi of &quot;heresy&quot;, due to his interest in natural sciences. Authorities investigated and restrained other Decembrists for not attending church. The regime thoroughly censored all correspondences, especially communication with relatives. Messages were scrupulously reviewed by both officials in Siberia and the Third Division of the political intelligence service at Saint Petersburg. This screening process necessitated dry, careful wording on the part of Decembrists. In the words of Bestuzhev, correspondence bore a &quot;lifeless ... imprint of officiality.&quot; Under the settlement regime, allowances were extremely meager. Certain Decembrists, including the Volkonskys, the Murav&#x27;yovs, and the Trubetskoys, were rich, but the majority of exiles had no money, and were forced to live off a mere 15 desyatins (about 16 hectares) of land, the allotment granted to each settler. Decembrists, with little to no knowledge of the land, attempted to eke out a living on wretched soil with next to no equipment. Financial aid from relatives and wealthier comrades saved many; others perished.

Despite extensive restrictions, limitations, and hardships, Decembrists believed that they could improve their situation through personal initiative. A constant stream of petitions came out of Petrovsky Zavod addressed to General Leparskii and Emperor Nicholas I. Most of the petitions were written by Decembrists&#x27; wives who had cast aside social privileges and comfort to follow their husbands into exile. These wives joined under the leadership of Princess Mariia Volkonskaia, and by 1832, through relentless petitions, managed to secure for their men formal cancellation of labor requirements, and several privileges, including the right of husbands to live with their wives in privacy. Decembrists managed to gain transfers and allowances through persuasive petitions as well as through the intervention of family members. This process of petitioning, and the resultant concessions made by the tsar and officials, was and would continue to be a standard practice of political exiles in Siberia. The chain of bureaucratic procedures and orders linking Saint Petersburg to Siberian administration was often circumvented or ignored. These breaks in bureaucracy afforded exiles a small capacity for betterment and activism.

Wives of many Decembrists, as well as some nieces and sisters, followed their husbands into exile. The term &quot;Dekabristka&quot; (&quot;Decembrist wife&quot;) is a Russian symbol of the devotion of a wife to her husband. Maria Volkonskaya, the wife of the Decembrist leader Sergei Volkonsky, notably followed her husband to his exile in Irkutsk. Despite the spartan conditions of this banishment, Sergei Volkonsky and his wife Maria took opportunities to celebrate the liberalising mode of their exile. Sergei took to wearing an untrimmed beard (rejecting Peter the Great&#x27;s reforms and salon fashion), wearing peasant dress and socialising with many of his peasant associates with whom he worked the land at his farm in Urik. Maria, equally, established schools, a foundling hospital and a theater for the local population. Sergei returned after 30 years of his exile had elapsed, though his titles and land remained under royal possession. Other exiles preferred to remain in Siberia after their sentences were served, preferring its relative freedom to the stifling intrigues of Moscow and Saint Petersburg, and after years of exile there was not much for them to return to. Many Decembrists thrived in exile, in time becoming landowners and farmers. In later years, they became idols of the populist movement of the 1860s and the 1870s as the Decembrists&#x27; advocacy of reform (including the abolition of serfdom) won them many admirers, including the writer Leo Tolstoy.

During their time in exile, the Decembrists fundamentally influenced Siberian life. Their presence was most definitely felt culturally and economically, political activity being so far removed from the &quot;pulse of national life&quot; so as to be negligible. While in Petrovsky Zavod, Decembrists taught each other foreign languages, arts and crafts, and musical instruments. They established &quot;academies&quot; made up of libraries, schools, and symposia. In their settlements, Decembrists were fierce advocates of education, and founded many schools for natives, the first of which opened at Nerchinsk. Schools were also founded for women, and soon exceeded capacity. Decembrists contributed greatly to the field of agriculture, introducing previously unknown crops such as vegetables, tobacco, rye, buckwheat, and barley, and advanced agricultural methods such as hothouse cultivation. Trained doctors among the political exiles promoted and organized medical aid. The homes of prominent exiles like Prince Sergei Volkonsky and Prince Sergei Trubetskoi became social centers of their locales. All throughout Siberia, the Decembrists sparked an intellectual awakening: literary writings, propaganda, newspapers, and books from European Russia began to circulate the eastern provinces, the local population developing a capacity for critical political observation. The Decembrists even held a certain influence within Siberian administration; Dimitry Zavalishin played a critical role in developing and advocating Russian Far East policy. Although the Decembrists lived in isolation, their scholarly activities encompassed Siberia at large, including its culture, economy, administration, population, geography, botany, and ecology. Despite restricted circumstances, the Decembrists accomplished an extraordinary amount, and their work was deeply appreciated by Siberians.

On 26 August 1856, with the ascent of Alexander II to the throne, the Decembrists received amnesty, and their rights, privileges were restored. Their children obtained rights, privileges and even titles of their fathers (such as princes) even if their fathers&#x27; titles were not restored. However, not all chose to return to the West. Some were financially inhibited, others had no family, and many were weak with old age. To many, Siberia had become home. Those that did return to European Russia did so with enthusiasm for the enforcement of the Emancipation Reforms of 1861. The exile of the Decembrists led to the permanent implantation of an intelligentsia in Siberia. For the first time, a cultural, intellectual, and political elite came to Siberian society as permanent residents; they integrated with the country and participated alongside natives in its development.

==Assessment==
With the failure of the Decembrists, Russia&#x27;s autocracy would continue for almost a century, although serfdom would be officially abolished in 1861 and the parliaments in Russia and Finland would be established in 1905. Finland had a parliament since Alexander I, but the number of electors was limited. The Russian Constitution of 1905 was called &quot;The basic laws&quot; as the Decembrists had called it. Though defeated, the Decembrists did effect some change on the regime. Their dissatisfaction forced Nicholas I to turn his attention inward to address the issues of the empire. He included many Decembrists who had joined his forces on the Senate Square and did not ultimately support the revolt in spite of their participation in Decembrist meetings into his government (such as Benkendorf, appointed to supervise the human rights, Muraviev-Vilensky and others). In 1826, Speransky was appointed by Nicholas I to head the &quot;Second Section&quot; of His Imperial Majesty&#x27;s Own Chancellery, a committee formed to Russian law. Under his leadership, the committee produced a publication of the complete collection of laws of the Russian Empire, containing 35,993 enactments. This codification called the &quot;Full Collection of Laws&quot; (&quot;Polnoye Sobraniye Zakonov&quot;) was presented to Nicholas I, and formed the basis for the &quot;Collection of Laws of the Russian Empire&quot; (&quot;Svod Zakonov Rossiskoy Imperii&quot;), the positive law valid for the Russian Empire. Speransky&#x27;s liberal ideas were subsequently scrutinized and elaborated by Konstantin Kavelin and Boris Chicherin.
Although the revolt was a proscribed topic during Nicholas&#x27; reign, Alexander Herzen placed the profiles of executed Decembrists on the cover of his radical periodical &quot;Polar Star&quot;. Alexander Pushkin addressed poems to his Decembrist friends; Nikolai Nekrasov, whose father served together with Decembrists in Ukraine, wrote a long poem about the Decembrist wives; and Leo Tolstoy started writing a novel on that liberal movement, which would later evolve into &quot;War and Peace&quot;. In the Soviet era Yuri Shaporin produced an opera entitled &quot;Dekabristi&quot; (The Decembrists), about the revolt, with the libretto written by Aleksey Nikolayevich Tolstoy. It premiered at the Bolshoi Theatre on 23 June 1953.

To some extent, the Decembrists were in the tradition of a long line of palace revolutionaries of 1725–1825 who wanted to place their candidate on the throne, but many Decembrists also wanted to implement either classical liberalism or a moderate conservatism contrary to the more Jacobin, centralizing program of Pavel Pestel or the pan-Slavic confederation-advocating revolutionaries of the &quot;Society of United Slavs&quot;. The majority of Decembrists were not members of illegal organizations similar to the participants of palace revolutions. Some were members of the Union of Prosperity only, sympathetic to an official, pro-governmental fairly conservative program. But their revolt, unlike previous Romanov palace revolutions, has been considered the beginning of a revolutionary movement. The uprising was the first open breach between the government and reformist elements of the Russian nobility, which would subsequently widen.

<text>Fort Oswego was an 18th-century trading post in the Great Lakes region in North America, which became the site of a battle between French and British Army forces in 1756 during the North American phase of the Seven Years&#x27; War, known in the United States as &#x27;The French and Indian War.&#x27; The fort was established in 1727, on the orders of New York governor William Burnet, adjacent to a 1722 blockhouse that had originally been a way station for French traders. The log palisade fort established a British presence on the Great Lakes.

In 1756, the fort&#x27;s garrison of British soldiers from the 50th and 51st regiments were easily defeated by a combined French and Native American force. More than one hundred British soldiers were killed, many of them after the fort had been formally surrendered. The French took a further 1,500 British prisoners, and destroyed the fort itself. The site is now included in the city of Oswego, New York.

== Oswego fortification system ==
Many historic references to Fort Oswego actually refer to other forts that existed simultaneously or later. The terrain at the site explains this. The original fort was built around the trading post on the lower ground on the north west side of the mouth of the Oswego River. This was convenient to canoe and bateaux traffic. A stone blockhouse was added in 1727, and was called Fort Burnet. A triangular stone wall, ten feet (3 m) high and three feet (1 m) wide was added in 1741, and the entire enclosure was called Fort Pepperrell (a marker can be found designating the area of Fort Oswego on the north west side of the river along a sidewalk). Besides these expansions, Fort Ontario was started in 1755 as a palisade on the high ground on the north east side of the river, and Fort George was added to the bluff located a half mile (800 m) to the southwest from Fort Oswego. Fort George was also called Fort Rascal or the West Fort. Fort Ontario was also known as the Fort of the Six Nations or the East Fort. The French knew Fort Oswego as Fort Chouaguen. Some references to Fort Oswego refer to the entire complex. Except for the marker in Oswego, nothing is left of Fort Oswego itself.

Fort Ontario has been rebuilt several times on or around the original fort and was given up by the U.S. Army in the 1940s. The fort is currently being taken care of by New York State Parks and Historic Preservation and is opened to the public.

== French and Indian War ==

During the French and Indian War, the French commander, General Montcalm, arrived in August with 3,000 men. His force included three regiments of regulars, several companies of Canadian militia, and numerous Indians. He first captured Fort Ontario, then began the assault on Fort Oswego. Oswego was the stronger fortification, but it was now downhill from 120 cannons in the abandoned Fort Ontario. Montcalm swept the fort with cannon fire, killing the British commander, Colonel Mercer, in the bombardment. British forces were forced to surrender on August 15, 1756.

Montcalm gave much of the British supplies to his Indian allies, and destroyed the fort. He returned to Quebec in triumph with 1,700 prisoners. 

== Later actions ==

The site was used for shore batteries in the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812 (when it was subjected to a British raid), but was never again fortified. Revolutionary War references to Fort Oswego are actually referring to Fort Ontario. The original site is commemorated at West First and Lake Street in Oswego, New York. Fort George was located in what is now Montcalm Park. Fort Ontario was used as a training site in World War I and World War II.

<text>Pachyptila is a genus of seabirds in the family Procellariidae and the order Procellariiformes. The members of this genus and the blue petrel form a sub-group called prions. They range throughout the southern hemisphere, often in the much cooler higher latitudes. Three species, the broad-billed prion (&quot;Pachyptila vittata&quot;), the Antarctic prion (&quot;Pachyptila desolata&quot;) and the fairy prion (&quot;Pachyptila turtur&quot;), range into the subtropics.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Pachyptila&quot; was introduced in 1811 by the German zoologist Johann Karl Wilhelm Illiger. The name combines the Ancient Greek &quot;pakhus &quot; meaning &quot;dense&quot; or &quot;thick&quot; with &quot;ptilon&quot; meaning &quot;feather&quot; or &quot;plumage&quot;. The type species was subsequently designated as the broad-billed prion by English naturalist Prideaux John Selby in 1840. The English name &quot;prion&quot; comes from the Ancient Greek (&quot;&quot;, &quot;saw&quot;), in reference to the serrated edges of its bill.

All the members of this genus, along with the rest of the Procellariiformes, share certain identifying features. First, they have nasal passages that attach to the upper bill called naricorns, although the nostrils on the albatross are on the sides of the bill. The bills of Procellariiformes are also unique in that they are split into between seven and nine horny plates. The genus produces a stomach oil made up of wax esters and triglycerides that is stored in the proventriculus. This can be sprayed out of their mouths as a defence against predators and as an energy-rich food source for chicks and for the adults during their long flights. Finally, they also have a salt gland that is situated above the nasal passage and helps free their bodies of the salt in the seawater they often imbibe. The gland excretes a concentrated saline solution from the nose.

==Species==
The genus contains the following seven species.
==Behaviour==
The members of this genus primarily eat zooplankton by filtering water through their upper bill. Some even hydroplane, a technique where they filter food out the water while flying with their bill in the ocean. They breed colonially, and do so near the ocean, usually with the same mate for life. Both sexes help incubate the egg, and care for the chick.

==Range and habitat==
They are pelagic and seldom come to land, except to breed. Also, they all stay in the Southern Hemisphere, and breed on subantarctic islands except the fairy prion which breeds on subtropical islands.

==Publications==

The transactions of the academy (&quot;Vetenskapsakademiens handlingar&quot;) were published as its main series between 1739 and 1974. In parallel, other major series have appeared and gone:
* &quot;Öfversigt af Kungl. Vetenskapsakademiens förhandlingar&quot; (1844–1903)
* &quot;Bihang till Vetenskapsakademiens Handlingar&quot; (1872–1902)
* &quot;Vetenskapsakademiens årsbok&quot; (1903–1969)

The academy started publishing annual reports in physics and chemistry (1826), technology (1827), botany (1831), and zoology (1832). These lasted into the 1860s, when they were replaced by the single &quot;Bihang&quot; series (meaning: supplement to the transactions). Starting in 1887, this series was once again split into four sections (&quot;afdelning&quot;), which in 1903, became independent scientific journals of their own, titled &quot;Arkiv för...&quot; (archive for...). These included:
* &quot;Arkiv för botanik&quot; (1903–1974)
* &quot;Arkiv för kemi, mineralogi och geologi&quot; (1903–1949)
* &quot;Arkiv för matematik, astronomi och fysik&quot; (1903–1949)
* &quot;Arkiv för Zoologi&quot; (1903–1974)

Further restructuring of their topics occurred in 1949 and 1974. Other defunct journals of the academy include:
* &quot;Electronic Transactions on Artificial Intelligence&quot; (1997–2001)

;Current publications
* &quot;Ambio&quot; (1972–)
* &quot;Acta Mathematica&quot; (1882–)
* &quot;Arkiv för Matematik&quot; (1949– with this title; 1903–1949 also including physics and astronomy)
* &quot;Acta Zoologica&quot; (1920–)
* &quot;Levnadsteckningar över Vetenskapsakademiens ledamöter&quot; (1869–), biographies of deceased members
* &quot;Porträttmatrikel&quot; (1971–), portraits of current members
* &quot;Zoologica Scripta&quot; (1972–), jointly with the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters

==History==
The academy was founded on 2 June 1739 by naturalist Carl Linnaeus, mercantilist Jonas Alströmer, mechanical engineer Mårten Triewald, civil servants Sten Carl Bielke and Carl Wilhelm Cederhielm, and statesman/author Anders Johan von Höpken.

The purpose of the academy was to focus on practically useful knowledge, and to publish in Swedish in order to widely disseminate the academy&#x27;s findings. The academy was intended to be different from the Royal Society of Sciences in Uppsala, which had been founded in 1719 and published in Latin. The location close to the commercial activities in Sweden&#x27;s capital (which unlike Uppsala did not have a university at this time) was also intentional. The academy was modeled after the Royal Society of London and Academie Royale des Sciences in Paris, France, which some of the founding members were familiar with.

<text>The Anserinae are a subfamily in the waterfowl family Anatidae. It includes the swans and the true geese. Under alternative systematical concepts (see e.g., Terres &amp; NAS, 1991), it is split into two subfamilies, the Anserinae contain the geese and the ducks, while the Cygninae contain the swans.

==Systematics==
Swans (Tribe Cygnini) 
*Genus &quot;Cygnus&quot; – true swans: The black-and-yellow-billed swans are sometimes separated in the genus &quot;Olor&quot;.
*Genus †&quot;Afrocygnus&quot; (Miocene of North Africa)
*Genus †&quot;Annakacygna –&quot; short-winged swans (Miocene of Japan)
*Genus †&quot;Megalodytes&quot; (Miocene of California)

True geese (Tribe Anserini) 
*Genus &quot;Anser&quot; – grey and white geese
*Genus &quot;Branta&quot; – black geese

Unresolved
*Genus &quot;Coscoroba&quot; – coscoroba swan

These two genera are distinct from other geese and often elevated to a subfamily of their own (Cereopsinae), or alternatively into the shelduck subfamily Tadorninae:

Tribe Cereopseini

*Genus &quot;Cereopsis&quot; – Cape Barren goose
*Genus †&quot;Cnemiornis&quot; – New Zealand geese (prehistoric)

Some enigmatic subfossils of very large goose-like birds from the Hawaiian Islands do not appear to be moa-nalos (goose-sized dabbling ducks). They cannot be assigned to any genus living today, though most, if not all, may be fairly close to &quot;Branta&quot;:
* &quot;Geochen rhuax&quot; – initially allied with &quot;Cereopsis&quot;, but this seems hardly correct for reasons of biogeography.
* Giant Hawaiʻi goose, ?&quot;Branta&quot; sp.
* Giant Oʻahu goose, Anatidae sp. et gen. indet.

<doc id="210820" wikidata="Q26375" url="?curid=210820" title="Phasianidae">
<text>Phasianidae is a family of heavy, ground-living birds, which includes pheasants, grouse, partridges, junglefowl, chickens, turkeys, Old World quail, and peafowl. The family includes many of the most popular gamebirds. The family includes 185 species divided into 54 genera. It was formerly broken up into two subfamilies, the Phasianinae and the Perdicinae. However, this treatment is now known to be paraphyletic and polyphyletic, respectively, and more recent evidence supports breaking it up into two subfamilies: Rollulinae and Phasianinae, with the latter containing multiple tribes within two clades. The New World quail (Odontophoridae) and guineafowl (Numididae) were formerly sometimes included in this family, but are now typically placed in families of their own; conversely, grouse and turkeys, formerly often treated as distinct families (Tetraonidae and Meleagrididae, respectively), are now known to be deeply nested within Phasianidae, so they are now included in the present family.

==Description==
Phasianids are terrestrial. They range in weight from in the case of the king quail to in the case of the Indian peafowl. If turkeys are included, rather than classified as a separate family, then the considerably heavier wild turkey capably reaches a maximum weight of more than . Length in this taxonomic family can vary from in the king quail up to (including the elongated train) in green peafowl, thus they beat even the true parrots in length diversity within a family of birds. Generally, sexual dimorphism is greater in larger-sized birds, with males tending to be larger than females. They are generally plump, with broad, relatively short wings and powerful legs. Many have a spur on each leg, most prominently with junglefowl (including chickens), pheasants, turkeys, and peafowl. Some, like quails, partridges, and grouse, have reduced spurs to none at all. A few have two spurs on each of their legs instead of one, including peacock-pheasants and spurfowl. The bill is short and compact, particularly in species that dig deep in the earth for food such as the Mearns quail. Males of the bigger galliform species often boast brightly-coloured plumage, as well as facial ornaments such as combs, wattles, and/or crests.

==Distribution and habitat==
The Phasianidae are mostly an Old World family, with a distribution that includes most of Europe and Asia (except the far north), all of Africa except the driest deserts, and south into much of eastern Australia and (formerly) New Zealand. The Meleagridini (turkeys) are native to the New World, while the Tetraonini (grouse) are circumpolar; both of these are members of Phasianinae. The greatest diversity of species is in Southeast Asia and Africa. The Congo peacock is specific to the African Congo.

Overall, Rollulinae is restricted to the tropics of East and Southeast Asia and the mountains of Tanzania, Phasianinae have a circumpolar range in the temperate zones of both Eurasia and North America (but also range into the tropics of east and southeast Asia), and Pavoninae have a wide range across Africa, Eurasia, and Australasia in both temperate and tropical zones.

The family is generally and resident, although some members of the group undertake long migrations, like ptarmigans and Old World quail. Several species in the family have been widely introduced around the world, particularly pheasants, which have been introduced to Europe, Australia, and the Americas, specifically for hunting purposes. Captive populations of peafowl, domestic chickens, and turkeys have also escaped or been released and became feral.

==Behaviour and ecology==
The phasianids have a varied diet, with foods taken ranging from purely vegetarian diets of seeds, leaves, fruits, tubers, and roots, to small animals including insects, insect grubs, and even small reptiles. Most species either specialise in feeding on plant matter or are predatory, although the chicks of most species are insectivorous.

In addition to the variation in diet, a considerable amount of variation exists in breeding strategies among the Phasianidae. Compared to birds in general, a large number of species do not engage in monogamy (the typical breeding system of most birds). The francolins of Africa and some partridges are reportedly monogamous, but polygamy has been reported in the pheasants and junglefowl, some quail, and the breeding displays of peacocks have been compared to those of a lek. Nesting usually occurs on the ground; only the tragopans nest higher up in trees or stumps of bushes. Nests can vary from mounds of vegetation to slight scrapes in the ground. As many as 20 eggs can be laid in the nest, although 7-12 are the more usual numbers, with smaller numbers in tropical species. Incubation times can range from 14–30 days depending on the species, and is almost always done solely by the hen, although a few involve the male partaking in caring for the eggs and chicks, like the willow ptarmigan and bobwhite quail.

==Relationship with humans==
The red junglefowl of Southeast Asia is the wild ancestor of the domesticated chicken, the most important bird in agriculture, and the wild turkey similarly is the ancestor of the domestic turkey. Several species of pheasants and partridges are extremely important to humans. Ring-necked pheasants, several partridge and quail species, and some francolins have been widely introduced and managed as game birds for hunting. Several species are threatened by human activities.

==Systematics and evolution==

The clade Phasianidae is the largest of the branch Galliformes, comprising 185 species divided into 54 genera. This group includes the pheasants and partridges, junglefowl chickens, quail, and peafowl. Turkeys and grouse have also been recognized as having their origins in the pheasant- and partridge-like birds.

Until the early 1990s, this family was broken up into two subfamilies: the Phasianinae, including pheasants, tragopans, junglefowls, and peafowls; and the Perdicinae, including partridges, Old World quails, and francolins. Molecular phylogenies have shown that these two subfamilies are not each monophyletic, but actually constitute only one lineage with one common ancestor. For example, some partridges (genus &quot;Perdix&quot;) are more closely affiliated to pheasants, whereas Old World quails and partridges from the genus &quot;Alectoris&quot; are closer to junglefowls.

The earliest fossil records of phasianids date to the late Oligocene epoch, about 30 million years ago.

===Phylogeny===
Cladogram based on a 2021 study by De Chen and collaborators that sequenced DNA flanking ultra-conserved elements. The extinct Himalayan quail (genus &quot;Ophrysia&quot;) was not included in the study. The species numbers and the inclusion of the genera &quot;Canachites&quot;, &quot;Ortygornis&quot;, &quot;Campocolinus&quot; and &quot;Synoicus&quot; follows the list maintained by Frank Gill, Pamela Rasmussen and David Donsker on behalf of the International Ornithologists&#x27; Union.

<text>Johann &quot;Hans&quot; Hölzel (; 19 February 1957 – 6 February 1998), better known by his stage name Falco (from Falko Weißpflog),&lt;ref name=&quot;u4.at/falco&quot; &gt;&lt;/ref&gt; was an Austrian singer and musician. He had several international hits, including &quot;Der Kommissar&quot; (1981), &quot;Rock Me Amadeus&quot;, &quot;Vienna Calling&quot;, &quot;Jeanny&quot;, &quot;The Sound of Musik&quot;, &quot;Coming Home (Jeanny Part II, One Year Later)&quot;, and posthumously &quot;Out of the Dark&quot;. 

&quot;Rock Me Amadeus&quot; reached No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts in 1986, making Falco the only artist in history to score a number-one hit with a German language song in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;dc/Falco&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; According to his estate, he has sold 20 million albums and 40 million singles, which makes him the best-selling Austrian singer of all time.

Also notable was his very early, first notable, creation of a successful non-English language rap music song (&quot;Der Kommissar&quot;), recorded in December 1981.

==Early life==
Johann Hölzel was born on 19 February 1957 to Maria (née Saurer), from Bad Tatzmannsdorf in Burgenland, a laundry branch manager, and Alois Hölzel, from Lower Austria, a machine factory foreman, on Ziegelofengasse in Margareten, a working class district of Vienna.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bestattung/Alois&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;falco.at/137&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Maria would later recall that she had been pregnant with triplets. As it was a dizygotic pregnancy, she miscarried the identical twins during the third month and Falco, who was conceived via a separate ovum, survived. Falco mused that &quot;three souls in one chest sounds a little over-dramatic, but I do sense them sometimes. In my moodiness. I&#x27;ll be really up and then right after I&#x27;ll be really down.&quot;

In 1963, Hölzel began his schooling at a Roman Catholic private school; four years later, at age ten, he switched to the Rainergymnasium in Margareten. He was still a child when Hölzel&#x27;s father left the family, and he was raised by his mother.

Hölzel began to show signs of unusual musical talent very early. As a toddler, he was able to keep time with the drumbeat in songs he heard on the radio. He was given a child&#x27;s grand piano for his fourth birthday; a year later, his birthday gift was a record player which he used to play music by Elvis Presley, Cliff Richard, and the Beatles.

Hölzel wanted to be a pop star from a very early age. At age 16, he attended the Vienna Conservatoire, but he became frustrated and soon left. His mother insisted he begin an apprenticeship with the . This too only lasted a short time. At seventeen, he entered military service in the Austrian army for eight months.

==Early career==

In late 1970s Vienna, he became part of the Viennese nightlife, which included not just music but also striptease, performance art and a general atmosphere of satirizing politics and celebrating chaos. He played bass guitar in a number of bands under various pseudonyms, including &quot;John Hudson&quot; and &quot;John DiFalco&quot;. 

From 1977 to early 1979, Hans Hölzel was the bassist of Austrian rock group the , during which he would adopt his stage name Falco, from Falko Weißpflog.. Despite being closely tied with the Viennese underground club scene, Falco looked uncharacteristically clean-cut. In contrast to shabbier fashions, he had short hair (due to his military service) and wore Ray-Ban sunglasses and suits. 

, having experienced some success with touring, inspired musician Stefan Weber to reorganize his Viennese Anarcho-punk band, Drahdiwaberl, an Austrian group that employed shock tactics and stage antics, and in 1979 Falco was invited to join the group. Shortly after leaving the Hallucination Company, Falco became a member of Spinning Wheel, a side project of Drahdiwaberl, where he first began to sing, transitioning from bass player to vocalist and developing his own style. 

&quot;When Falco – who&#x27;d spent some time in Berlin himself – entered a recording studio for the first time in 1979 to record two songs for the sampler &quot;Wiener Blutrausch&quot; as the bass player in the band &quot;Drahdiwaberl&quot;, he found himself in the &quot;Schmetter Sound Studio&quot; in Bisamberg, run by the rather hippiesque political folk band &quot;Schmetterlinge&quot;.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;redbullMA/falco&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1979, he recorded demos and early sketches in a recording studio, from which a single was released posthumously 28 years later.
His distinct style, coupled with his singing performance of the song &quot;Ganz Wien&quot; (literally &quot;All Vienna&quot;, tag-lined &quot;That Scene&quot;) led to manager offering to sign Falco in 1981. Ironically, it was at a concert for drug prevention and &quot;Ganz Wien&quot; has a line proclaiming &quot;All Vienna is on heroin today.&quot;

== Solo artist ==
Once Falco was signed as a solo artist, he continued composing his own music and hired songwriter Robert Ponger. In 1981, Falco brought his intended first single &quot;Helden von heute&quot; to manager Horst Bork, but received a lukewarm reception. Bork felt that the B-side &quot;Der Kommissar&quot; was much stronger. Falco was hesitant, since the track is a German-language song about drug consumption that combines rap verses with a sung chorus. Though beginning to break through in America, rap was still rare in Western Europe at the time. Bork insisted and the song became a number-one success in Germany, France, Italy, Spain and Japan, while charting high in several other nations.

Though &quot;Der Kommissar&quot; failed to break through in the UK and US, the British rock band After the Fire covered the song with new English lyrics. This version charted at number five on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in the U.S. That same year, American singer Laura Branigan recorded a non-single version of the song with new English lyrics under the title &quot;Deep in the Dark&quot; on her album &quot;Branigan 2&quot;. &quot;Einzelhaft&quot;, the album on which &quot;Der Kommissar&quot; appears, also topped the charts in Austria and the Netherlands.

Falco and Ponger returned to the studio in 1983 to record Falco&#x27;s second album &quot;Junge Roemer&quot; (&quot;Young Romans&quot;). It was a difficult project, as the two artists felt immense pressure to match their previous success and the recording process was plagued by delays. &quot;Junge Roemer&quot; was released in 1984. Even though the music video for the single &quot;Hoch wie nie&quot; (&quot;Higher Than Ever&quot;) was aired on prime time TV in Austria, it failed to ignite interest internationally.

&quot;Junge Roemer&quot; only charted in Austria where it went to number one. Outside of Austria and Spain, the title track and main single &quot;Junge Roemer&quot; failed to repeat the success of &quot;Der Kommissar&quot;. As a reaction, Falco began to experiment with English lyrics in an effort to broaden his appeal. He parted ways with Ponger and chose a new production team: the brothers Rob and Ferdi Bolland from the Netherlands.

Falco recorded &quot;Rock Me Amadeus&quot;, inspired in part by the Oscar-winning film &quot;Amadeus&quot;, and the song became a worldwide hit in 1986. It reached No. 1 in over a dozen countries, including the US, UK, and Japan, bringing the success that had eluded him in markets a few years earlier. The song remained in the top spot of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 for three weeks. His album &quot;Falco 3&quot; peaked at the number three position on the&quot; Billboard&quot; album charts. Unusually for a white act, especially one from mainland Europe, &quot;Rock Me Amadeus&quot; reached number six in the Billboard Top R&amp;B Singles Chart, and &quot;Falco 3&quot; peaked at number 18 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums charts. Follow-up single &quot;Vienna Calling&quot; was another international pop hit, peaking at No. 18 of the Billboard Charts and No. 17 on the US Cash Box Charts in 1986. A double A-side 12&quot; single featuring remixes of those two hits peaked at No. 4 on the US Dance/Disco charts.

&quot;Jeanny&quot;, the third release from the album &quot;Falco 3&quot;, brought the performer back to the top of the charts across Europe. Highly controversial when it was released in Germany and the Netherlands, the story of &quot;Jeanny&quot; was told from the point of view of a possible rapist and murderer. Several DJs and radio stations refused to play the ballad, which was ignored in the US, though it became a huge hit in many European countries, and inspired a sequel on his next album.

After the success of &quot;Rock Me Amadeus&quot;, there were talks of crossing over more permanently into the U.S. by working with American producers and collaborating with other American artists. These possibilities fell through, in part, due to Falco&#x27;s personal problems. At this point in his career, he was dangerously addicted to alcohol and other drugs.

In 1986, the album &quot;Emotional&quot; was released, produced by Rob and Ferdi Bolland (Bolland &amp; Bolland). Songs on the album included &quot;Coming Home (Jeanny Part II, One Year Later)&quot;, &quot;The Kiss of Kathleen Turner&quot;, and &quot;Kamikaze Capa&quot; which was written as a tribute to the late photojournalist Robert Capa. &quot;The Sound of Musik&quot; was another international success, and a Top 20 US dance hit, though it failed to make the US pop charts.

After 1986, there were a number of European hits, but Falco was rarely heard in the US and the UK. In 1987, Falco went on the &quot;Emotional&quot; world tour ending in Japan. In the same year he sang a duet with Brigitte Nielsen, &quot;Body Next to Body&quot;; the single was a Top 10 hit in German-speaking countries. The album &quot;Wiener Blut&quot; (&quot;Viennese Blood&quot;) was released in 1988 but it did not get much publicity outside Germany and Austria.

His 1992 comeback attempt—the album &quot;Nachtflug&quot; (&quot;Night Flight&quot;), which included the single &quot;Titanic&quot;—was successful in Austria only. Starting in the early 1990s, Falco lived in the Dominican Republic, where he worked on his last album from 1995 to 1998. &quot;Out of the Dark (Into the Light)&quot; was released posthumously on 27 February 1998 in Europe and worldwide in March. It charted at number one in Austria for 21 weeks.

==Personal life==
Falco has been described by those who knew him as having a complex personality. He has been called ambitious, eccentric, caring, egotistical and deeply insecure. Thomas Rabitsch, a keyboardist who met Falco when the aspiring pop star was only 17 years old, said he was a quiet young man and precise bass player, but also arrogant and with a &quot;very high opinion of himself&quot;. Markus Spiegel, the manager who discovered Falco, admitted that the pop star was &quot;an extremely difficult artist&quot; and known womanizer. Peter Vieweger, a guitarist who knew Falco before his success and continued to play in Falco&#x27;s touring band and on his albums, remembers Falco as being &quot;scared he would fail or be unmasked and not be as good as people thought he was&quot;.

Through the 1980s and into the &#x27;90s, he became dependent on alcohol and cocaine. When under the influence he was unreliable at best and abusive at worst. Ferdi Bolland recalls that Falco was often so severely intoxicated that the writing process revolved around his &quot;inability to be coherent, to even stand for a long time&quot;. Despite pleas from his manager and collaborators to get help, Falco stubbornly refused.

While Falco was in a relationship with Isabella Vitkovic, she gave birth to a girl, Katharina, in 1986. The couple married in 1988, but it was a &quot;love–hate&quot; relationship, as Katharina describes it, and the marriage was short-lived. He believed that Katharina was his own daughter until a paternity test proved otherwise when she was seven years old. After this, Katharina&#x27;s relationship with him became strained. Though they kept in contact, she took her mother&#x27;s surname and claimed that she was written out of his will. She was 12 years old when he died. She did not reconcile with Falco&#x27;s mother, Maria Hölzel, until a few years before Hölzel&#x27;s death at the age of 87 in April 2014. Katharina subsequently published a memoir in 2008 called &quot;Falco war mein Vater&quot; (Falco Was My Father).

Around a year before his death, he had a house in Gars am Kamp.&lt;ref name=&quot;RBMA/pfF&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death ==

Hölzel died of severe injuries received on 6 February 1998, at age 40, when his Mitsubishi Pajero collided with a bus on the road linking the towns of Villa Montellano and Puerto Plata in the Dominican Republic. At the time of his death, he was planning a comeback, which was successful with the posthumously released album &quot;Out of the Dark (Into the Light)&quot;. His body was returned to Austria and buried at the Vienna Central Cemetery.

==Legacy==
In 1998, Rob and Ferdi Bolland (Dutch producers and co-writers on about half of Falco&#x27;s albums) released the EP &quot;Tribute to Falco&quot; under the name The Bolland Project feat. Alida. The title track featured samples of Falco&#x27;s music; the other tracks were &quot;We Say Goodbye&quot; and &quot;So Lonely&quot;.

The film &quot;Falco: Damn It, We&#x27;re Still Alive!&quot; was released in Austria on 7 February 2008, ten years and one day after Hölzel&#x27;s death. Written and directed by Thomas Roth, the movie features musician Manuel Rubey as adult Falco.&lt;ref name=&quot;WELT/Film:Falco&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The end credits include the line &quot;With love, Ferdi &amp; Rob&quot;, his frequent collaborators the Bollands. This title also lends its name to a posthumously released album by Falco, &quot;Verdammt wir leben noch,&quot; which translates to &quot;Damn, we&#x27;re still alive!&quot;

Falco&#x27;s friend Niki Lauda named one of the Boeing airplanes in his Lauda Air fleet &quot;Falco&quot; after the singer.

Although &quot;Der Kommissar&quot; saw nearly contemporaneous and fairly straightforward mainstream covers—including the loose translation by After the Fire and the reinterpretation by Suzy Andrews, both in 1982 and 1983, respectively—Falco&#x27;s song &quot;Rock Me Amadeus&quot; has seen more frequent use. It has been covered by Megaherz on the album &quot;Kopfschuss&quot; and Edguy on the album &quot;Space Police: Defenders of the Crown&quot;. The track has been sampled by groups including the Bloodhound Gang, who also refer to Hölzel in their 1999 song &quot;Mope&quot;, and by German rapper Fler in &quot;NDW 2005&quot; from &quot;Neue Deutsche Welle&quot;.

The restaurant Marchfelderhof in a Vienna suburb maintains a permanent reserved table for Hölzel.

The 1999 film &quot;Sugar Town&quot; is dedicated to Hölzel.

There is a staircase in Margareten, Vienna  that is named after him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gärtner/U4-Falco&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In Vienna, Falco&#x27;s portrait hangs above the entrance to . In 1979, Falco, as Hansi Hölzl, had his debut as a bassist with the band &quot;Spinning Wheel&quot; at &quot;Copacabana&quot;, now the . The building was first planned as a subway station, then as a city wine bar, which never opened. Falco never actually performed there when it became U4.

She has acted in the Broadway revivals of the plays &quot;Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune&quot; (2002), and &quot;&#x27;night, Mother&quot; (2004).

==Early life and education==
Falco was born in the New York City borough of Brooklyn on July 5, 1963, the daughter of Judith Anderson, an actress, and Frank Falco, a jazz drummer who later worked for an advertising agency. Her father was of Italian descent and her mother had Swedish, English and Cornish (1/16th) ancestry. She has two brothers, Joseph and Paul, and a sister, Ruth. Her uncle is novelist, playwright, and poet Edward Falco. In 2012, Falco was the subject of an episode of &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot; which focused on one of her ancestors, a Cornish master mariner from Penzance who was born at sea and died in 1840.

From the age of four, Falco was raised on Long Island, moving with her family to Hicksville, then North Babylon, and finally West Islip. As a child, she acted in plays at the Arena Players Repertory Theater in East Farmingdale, where her mother also performed. Her family eventually moved to Northport, where she attended high school and played Eliza Doolittle in a production of &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; during her senior year. Falco graduated from Northport High School in 1981. She attended the acting program at State University of New York at Purchase, and graduated in 1986 with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in acting.

==Career==
===1987–1999: Early work and rise to prominence ===
Early in her career, Falco made appearances on television shows like &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; and &quot;&quot;. Tom Fontana, executive producer of &quot;Homicide&quot;, cast Falco as Eva Thormann, the wife of an injured police officer, after watching Falco&#x27;s performance in &quot;Laws of Gravity&quot;, a 1992 film directed by Nick Gomez. Fontana said of her, &quot;She&#x27;s an actress who&#x27;s unadorned by any embroidery. She does everything with such simplicity and honesty, it&#x27;s breathtaking.&quot; A struggling actress at the time, Falco said her salary from these television episodes paid for one month&#x27;s worth of rent. She debuted on the big screen in 1987&#x27;s &quot;Sweet Lorraine&quot; starring Maureen Stapleton. 

Later, she had a small speaking role in the Woody Allen comedy film &quot;Bullets Over Broadway&quot; (1994). Her friendship with former SUNY Purchase classmate Eric Mendelsohn, who was the assistant to Allen&#x27;s costume designer, Jeffrey Kurland, helped her to be cast in the role. Mendelsohn went on to direct Falco in his feature film &quot;Judy Berlin&quot;, for which he won Best Director honors at the Sundance Film Festival. Falco went on to star in Mendelsohn&#x27;s next film &quot;3 Backyards&quot;, for which he won Best Director a second time.

During this time, Falco appeared in the films &quot;Trust&quot;, &quot;Cop Land&quot;, &quot;Private Parts&quot; (nonspeaking part), and &quot;Random Hearts&quot;. On Broadway, she appeared in the Tony Award-winning &quot;Side Man&quot; and in the revivals of &quot;Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune&quot; opposite Stanley Tucci, and &quot;&#x27;night, Mother&quot; opposite Brenda Blethyn. In 1997, Falco started portraying prison officer Diane Whittlesey, in the HBO prison drama series &quot;Oz&quot;. Falco got the role after working with Fontana on &quot;Homicide&quot;.

===1999–2007: &quot;The Sopranos&quot; and acclaim ===

Falco received her breakout role in the HBO drama &quot;The Sopranos&quot; created by David Chase, which premiered in 1999 and ended in 2007. She portrayed Carmela Soprano, wife of Mafia boss Tony Soprano played by James Gandolfini. The series received wide acclaim, and is often considered to be one of the greatest television series of all time. For her performance on the series, Falco won numerous awards including three Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Actress in a Drama Series for the episodes &quot;College&quot; (1999), &quot;Second Opinion&quot; (2001), and &quot;Whitecaps&quot; (2003). She also earned two Golden Globe Awards for Best Actress – Television Series Drama and five Screen Actors Guild Awards.

As of 2008, Falco, &quot;The X-Files&quot; star Gillian Anderson, &quot;Ugly Betty&quot; star America Ferrera, and &quot;30 Rock&quot;″s Tina Fey were the only actresses to have received a Golden Globe, an Emmy, and a SAG Award in the same year. Falco won these awards in 2003 for her performance as Carmela Soprano during the fourth season of &quot;The Sopranos&quot;. In the show&#x27;s final season Alessandra Stanley of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;The series has always distinguished itself by the quality of its actors, but this season Ms. Falco depicts even more deeply than before, if that&#x27;s possible, the full range of a mother and wife&#x27;s anguish.&quot;

During her tenure on &quot;The Sopranos&quot;, Falco appeared in films such as &quot;Freedomland&quot; and John Sayles&#x27; &quot;Sunshine State&quot;, for which she received the Los Angeles Film Critics Award for Best Supporting Actress. Falco also guest starred on the television series &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot; and had a recurring role as C.C. Cunningham on the second season of the NBC sitcom &quot;30 Rock&quot; as Celeste Cunningham, the later of which earned her a nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series.

===2008–2016: &quot;Nurse Jackie&quot; and return to Broadway ===

Falco starred as the title character, Nurse Jackie Peyton in the Showtime dark comedy series &quot;Nurse Jackie&quot;, which premiered on June 8, 2009, and ended on June 28, 2015. For the first season, she won her fourth Primetime Emmy Award, this time for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series she also received nominations for four Golden Globe Awards and eight Screen Actors Guild Awards. Alessandra Stanley of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;It&#x27;s the compelling, enigmatic heroine who holds the errant pieces together. Jackie is not Carmela, but Ms. Falco brings some of Carmela’s prosaic manner and harsh certainty to the new role. Jackie has a very dry and mitigating sense of humor, but her righteous streak steers the story.&quot;

Falco returned to Broadway portraying the part of Bananas in the revival of the John Guare play &quot;The House of Blue Leaves&quot; (2011) in New York City at the Walter Kerr Theatre with Ben Stiller and Jennifer Jason Leigh. For her performance she received a nomination for the Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Play. Theatre critic Ben Brantley of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote in his review for the show, that &quot;Ms. Falco endows the anguished Bananas with such unvarnished emotional transparency — and clinical exactness — that it hurts to look at her.&quot; Marilyn Stasio of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote, &quot;Falco is kind of [a] genius...What floors us is Falco’s ability to play both comedy and tragedy in the same breath&quot;.

It was announced in January 2013 that Falco would star in Liz Flahive&#x27;s &quot;The Madrid&quot; off-Broadway. The limited engagement, directed by Leigh Silverman, began previews on February 5 with an official opening on February 26. Along with Falco, the play starred John Ellison, Christopher Evan Welch, Phoebe Strole, and Frances Sternhagen. In 2016, Falco started portraying Sylvia Wittel on the Louis C.K. series &quot;Horace and Pete&quot; acting alongside C.K., Steve Buscemi, Alan Alda and Laurie Metcalf. The first episode was released on January 30, 2016, on C.K.&#x27;s website without any prior announcements. New episodes premiered weekly until the tenth episode was released on April 2, 2016. In the series Falco portrayed Horace and Sylvia&#x27;s abused mother. James Poniewozik of &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted &quot;Louis C. K. is reportedly submitting “Horace and Pete” for the Emmys as a drama. If it gets a nomination — Mr. Alda, Mr. Buscemi, Ms. Falco and Ms. Metcalf would all be strong picks&quot;.

===2017–present ===
In September 2017, she began portraying Leslie Abramson in the first season of the NBC true crime anthology series &quot;Law &amp; Order True Crime&quot;, subtitled &quot;The Menendez Murders&quot;. The role earned her a nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie at the 70th Primetime Emmy Awards. That same year she reunited with Louis C.K. for his film &quot;I Love You, Daddy&quot; (2017) starring C.K., Chloë Grace Moretz, Charlie Day, Rose Byrne, and John Malkovich. The film premiered at the 2017 Toronto International Film Festival. In the film Falco plays C.K.&#x27;s long-suffering production manager. The film&#x27;s release was cancelled after misconduct allegations against C.K. were released by &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Falco stated of the films cancellation, &quot;I was sad. I know that he worked very hard on it. He makes his own stuff and puts it out, and I love that chutzpah&quot; she also added that C.K. deserves a second chance after owning up to his inappropriate behavior.

In 2020, she appeared as the lead character in the Paul Attanasio CBS police drama &quot;Tommy&quot;. Falco originally reprised her breakout role as Carmela Soprano for the 2021 film &quot;The Many Saints of Newark&quot;, a prequel to &quot;The Sopranos&quot;. However, her scenes were cut from the finished film. Falco also starred in the FX true crime series &quot;&quot; (2021) portraying Hillary Rodham Clinton opposite Clive Owen&#x27;s Bill Clinton and Beanie Feldstein&#x27;s Monica Lewinsky. Ines Bellina of &quot;A.V. Club&quot; wrote, &quot;Falco expertly guides us through a whole smorgasbord of human emotions. From rage to heartache to regret to shame to longing to pride to a pure, pure ache, we ride that emotional roller coaster firmly by her side&quot;. In 2023 she played Amy Davidson, a fictional version of Pete Davidson&#x27;s mother, in his semi-autobiographical series, &quot;Bupkis&quot; on Peacock. It was announced in May 2024 that the series had ended after its first season.

==Personal life==
===Relationships ===
In 2002 Stanley Tucci left his family for Falco, with whom he was appearing on Broadway in Terrence McNally’s &quot;Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune&quot;, but the affair ended, and he returned to his wife and children. She adopted a son in 2005 and a daughter in 2008. Falco is a Buddhist.

=== Activism ===
She is a vegan and has worked with PETA on projects, including a public-service message urging parents to keep their children away from the circus. She told &quot;Parade&quot; magazine, &quot;I believe this is at the base of everything bad in society—you can bring it back to cruelty to animals. If you don&#x27;t have respect for the life of any kind, it will manifest in more obvious ways.&quot;

During the 2004 U.S. presidential election, Falco appeared in a 30-second television commercial on behalf of Mothers Opposing Bush in which she said, &quot;Mothers always put their children first. Mr. Bush, can you say the same?&quot; Falco has become the spokesperson for Health Care for America Now and appeared on CNN on June 25, 2009.

=== Health issues ===
Falco has struggled with alcoholism and decided to become sober in the early 1990s after &quot;one particular night of debauchery.&quot; She said in an interview that it was difficult to be around the hard-partying cast of &quot;The Sopranos&quot;, stating, &quot;This cast, in particular, they really love to hang out and party. They make it look like fun. And it was fun for me! They spend a lot more time without me than with me, by my own choice. I&#x27;m always invited, and I&#x27;m always there for two minutes and I leave, because I can&#x27;t live in that world anymore. It&#x27;s too dangerous.&quot; She is an advocate of Alcoholics Anonymous&#x27; 12-step program.

In 2003, Falco was diagnosed with breast cancer. She chose not to make the news public until the following year.

<doc id="210841" wikidata="Q2485628" url="?curid=210841" title="Aibonito, Puerto Rico">
<text>Aibonito () is a small mountain town and municipality in Puerto Rico located in the Sierra de Cayey mountain range, north of Salinas; south of Barranquitas and Comerío; east of Coamo; and west of Cidra, and Cayey. Aibonito is spread over 8 &quot;barrios&quot; and Aibonito Pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center of the city). It is part of the San Juan-Caguas-Guaynabo Metropolitan Statistical Area.

Aibonito is located at a relatively high elevation (its main square is the highest in the island at above sea level), which makes its climate cooler than most of Puerto Rico&#x27;s towns.

== Etymology and nicknames ==
The name &quot;Aibonito&quot; is possibly a combination of Spanish and Taíno from &quot;Hatibon&quot; or &quot;Jatibon&quot;, which the native name of the Aibonito River. &quot;Jatibon&quot; most likely translates to &quot;black river&quot; or &quot;night river&quot;, the indigenous name of the river which was later turned into a diminutive in Spanish (&quot;Jatibon-ito&quot;). It is common to have native place names in Puerto Rico be historically adopted and modified into the Spanish language such as &quot;Mucarabones&quot; for example, which is a plural of &quot;Mucarabon&quot;, meaning &quot;owl river&quot; in Taíno.

There&#x27;s also a legend that tells of a Spanish soldier called Diego Alvarez who on May 17, 1615, reached one of the highest peaks in the area and upon watching the view, exclaimed &quot;¡Ay, qué bonito!&quot; (&quot;Oh, how pretty!&quot;) which eventually was turned into the name of the region. If this is the case, it would be considered folk etymology.

Some of the municipality&#x27;s nicknames include &quot;Ciudad de las Flores&quot; (&quot;City of Flowers&quot;) and &quot;Jardín de Puerto Rico&quot; (&quot;Puerto Rico&#x27;s Garden&quot;) after the region&#x27;s floral industry and annual festival, and &quot;Ciudad Fría&quot; (&quot;Cold City&quot;) and &quot;Nevera de Puerto Rico&quot; (&quot;Puerto Rico&#x27;s refrigerator&quot;) after the fact that the municipality has recorded some of the island&#x27;s lowest temperatures.

==History==
Before the Spanish colonization of the Americas, it is believed that there were Taíno settlements in the region that belonged to Cacique Orocobix domain.

After the Spanish arrived, it is believed that a ranch was established in the region by Pedro Zorascoechea in 1630, which led the development of a hamlet. However, it wasn&#x27;t until 1822 when Don Manuel Veléz presented himself before the government, representing the inhabitants of the area, to ask for Aibonito to be officially declared a town. This was authorized on March 13, 1824, by Governor Don Miguel de la Torre. The first Catholic church in Aibonito was built in 1825. The building was replaced by the current church, which was started in 1887 and completed in 1897. After the town was officially constituted, barrios started developing in the area.

On the Spanish–American War of 1898, around 800 Spanish and Puerto Rican soldiers were able to defeat the invading American troops due to their strategic placement in Asomante Mountain. This scrimmage came to an end when the Spanish government surrendered on August 12, 1898. The Spanish and Puerto Rican forces at Asomante never surrendered and would have held their position indefinitely if not for the buckling of the Spanish government in Madrid.

Puerto Rico was ceded by Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish–American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 and became a territory of the United States. In 1899, the United States conducted its first census of Puerto Rico finding that the population of Aibonito was 8,596.

Hurricane Maria on September 20, 2017, triggered numerous landslides in Aibonito with the significant amount of rainfall. Around 1,500 homes were completely or partially destroyed. The hurricane destroyed the poultry industry of Aibonito with nearly 1.8 million chickens killed. Known as &quot;The Garden of Puerto Rico&quot; Aibonito has celebrated a flower festival since 1969. Aibonito&#x27;s floriculture industry was completely decimated by Hurricane María.

<doc id="210845" wikidata="Q25439" url="?curid=210845" title="Woodpecker">
<text>Woodpeckers are part of the bird family Picidae, which also includes the piculets, wrynecks and sapsuckers. Members of this family are found worldwide, except for Australia, New Guinea, New Zealand, Madagascar and the extreme polar regions. Most species live in forests or woodland habitats, although a few species are known that live in treeless areas, such as rocky hillsides and deserts, and the Gila woodpecker specialises in exploiting cacti.

Members of this family are chiefly known for their characteristic behaviour. They mostly forage for insect prey on the trunks and branches of trees, and often communicate by drumming with their beaks, producing a reverberatory sound that can be heard at some distance. Some species vary their diet with fruits, birds&#x27; eggs, small animals, tree sap, human scraps, and carrion. They usually nest and roost in holes that they excavate in tree trunks, and their abandoned holes are of importance to other cavity-nesting birds. They sometimes come into conflict with humans when they make holes in buildings or feed on fruit crops, but perform a useful service by their removal of insect pests on trees.

The Picidae are one of nine living families in the order Piciformes, the others being barbets (comprising three families), toucans, toucan-barbets, and honeyguides, which (along with woodpeckers) comprise the clade Pici, and the jacamars and puffbirds in the clade Galbuli. DNA sequencing has confirmed the sister relationships of these two groups. The family Picidae includes about 240 species arranged in 35 genera. Almost 20 species are threatened with extinction due to loss of habitat or habitat fragmentation, with one, the Bermuda flicker, being extinct and a further two possibly being so.

==General characteristics==
Woodpeckers include the tiny piculets, the smallest of which appears to be the bar-breasted piculet at in length and a weight of . Some of the largest woodpeckers can be more than in length. The largest surviving species is the great slaty woodpecker, which weighs on average and up to , and measures , but the extinct imperial woodpecker, at , and ivory-billed woodpecker, around and , were probably both larger.

The plumage of woodpeckers varies from drab to conspicuous. The colours of many species are based on olive and brown and some are pied, suggesting a need for camouflage; others are boldly patterned in black, white, and red, and many have a crest or tufted feathers on their crowns. Woodpeckers tend to be sexually dimorphic, but differences between the sexes are generally small; exceptions to this are Williamson&#x27;s sapsucker and the orange-backed woodpecker, which differ markedly. The plumage is moulted fully once a year apart from the wrynecks, which have an additional partial moult before breeding.

Woodpeckers, piculets, and wrynecks all possess characteristic zygodactyl feet, consisting of four toes, the first (hallux) and the fourth facing backward and the second and third facing forward. This foot arrangement is good for grasping the limbs and trunks of trees. Members of this family can walk vertically up tree trunks, which is beneficial for activities such as foraging for food or nest excavation. In addition to their strong claws and feet, woodpeckers have short, strong legs. This is typical of birds that regularly forage on trunks. Exceptions are the black-backed woodpecker and the American and Eurasian three-toed woodpeckers, which have only three toes on each foot. The tails of all woodpeckers, except the piculets and wrynecks, are stiffened, and when the bird perches on a vertical surface, the tail and feet work together to support it.

Woodpeckers have strong bills that they use for drilling and drumming on trees, and long, sticky tongues for extracting food (insects and larvae). Woodpecker bills are typically longer, sharper, and stronger than the bills of piculets and wrynecks, but their morphology is very similar. The bill&#x27;s chisel-like tip is kept sharp by the pecking action in birds that regularly use it on wood. The beak consists of three layers; an outer sheath called rhamphotheca, made of scales formed from keratin proteins, an inner layer of bone which has a large cavity and mineralised collagen fibers, and a middle layer made of porous bone which connects the two other layers.

Furthermore, the tongue bone (or hyoid bone) of the woodpecker is very long, and winds around the skull through a special cavity, thereby cushioning the brain. Combined, this anatomy helps the beak absorb mechanical stress. Species of woodpecker and flicker that use their bills in soil or for probing as opposed to regular hammering tend to have longer and more decurved bills. Due to their smaller bill size, many piculets and wrynecks forage in decaying wood more often than woodpeckers. Their long, sticky tongues, which possess barbs, aid these birds in grabbing and extracting insects from deep within a hole in a tree. The tongue was reported to be used to spear grubs, but more detailed studies published in 2004 have shown that the tongue instead wraps around the prey before being pulled out.

Many of the foraging, breeding, and signaling behaviors of woodpeckers involve drumming and hammering using their bills. To prevent brain damage from the rapid and repeated powerful impacts, woodpeckers have a number of physical features that protect their brains. These include a relatively small and smooth brain, narrow subdural space, little cerebrospinal fluid surrounding it to prevent it from moving back and forth inside the skull during pecking, the orientation of the brain within the skull (which maximises the contact area between the brain and the skull) and the short duration of contact. The skull consists of strong but compressible, sponge-like bone, which is most concentrated in the forehead and the back of the skull. Another anatomical adaptation of woodpeckers is the enormously elongated hyoid bone which subdivides, passes on either side of the spinal column and wraps around the brain case, before ending in the right nostril cavity. It plays the role of safety-belt.

Computer simulations have shown that 99.7% of the energy generated in pecking is stored in the form of strain energy, which is distributed throughout the bird&#x27;s body, with only a small remaining fraction of the energy going into the brain. The pecking also causes the woodpecker&#x27;s skull to heat up, which is part of the reason why they often peck in short bursts with brief breaks in between, giving the head some time to cool. During the millisecond before contact with wood, a thickened nictitating membrane closes, protecting the eye from flying debris. These membranes also prevent the retina from tearing. Their nostrils are also protected; they are often slit-like and have special feathers to cover them. Woodpeckers are capable of repeated pecking on a tree at high decelerations on the order of (1000 g).

Some large woodpeckers such as &quot;Dryocopus&quot; have a fast, direct form of flight, but the majority of species have a typical undulating flight pattern consisting of a series of rapid flaps followed by a swooping glide. Many birds in the genus &quot;Melanerpes&quot; have distinctive, rowing wing-strokes while the piculets engage in short bursts of rapid direct flight.

==Distribution, habitat, and movements==

===Global distribution===
Woodpeckers have a mostly cosmopolitan distribution, although they are absent from Australasia, Madagascar, and Antarctica. They are also absent from some of the world&#x27;s oceanic islands, although many insular species are found on continental islands. The true woodpeckers, subfamily Picinae, are distributed across the entire range of the family. The Picumninae piculets have a pantropical distribution, with species in Southeast Asia, Africa, and the Neotropics, with the greatest diversity being in South America. The second piculet subfamily, the Sasiinae, contains the African piculet and two species in the genus &quot;Sasia&quot; that are found in Southeast Asia. The wrynecks (Jynginae) are found exclusively in the Old World, with the two species occurring in Europe, Asia, and Africa.

Most woodpeckers are sedentary, but a few examples of migratory species are known, such as the rufous-bellied woodpecker, yellow-bellied sapsucker, and Eurasian wryneck, which breeds in Europe and west Asia and migrates to the Sahel in Africa in the winter. More northerly populations of Lewis&#x27;s woodpecker, northern flicker, Williamson&#x27;s sapsucker, red-breasted sapsucker, and red-naped sapsucker all move southwards in the fall in North America. Most woodpecker movements can be described as dispersive, such as when young birds seek territories after fledging, or eruptive, to escape harsh weather conditions. Several species are altitudinal migrants, for example the grey-capped pygmy woodpecker, which moves to lowlands from hills during winter. The woodpeckers that do migrate, do so during the day.

===Habitat requirements===
Overall, woodpeckers are arboreal birds of wooded habitats. They reach their greatest diversity in tropical rainforests, but occur in almost all suitable habitats, including woodlands, savannahs, scrublands, and bamboo forests. Even grasslands and deserts have been colonised by various species. These habitats are more easily occupied where a small number of trees exist, or in the case of desert species like the Gila woodpecker, tall cacti are available for nesting. Some are specialists and are associated with coniferous or deciduous woodlands, or even, like the acorn woodpecker, with individual tree genera (oaks in this case). Other species are generalists and are able to adapt to forest clearance by exploiting secondary growth, plantations, orchards, and parks. In general, forest-dwelling species need rotting or dead wood on which to forage.

Several species are adapted to spending a portion of their time feeding on the ground, and a very small minority have abandoned trees entirely and nest in holes in the ground. The ground woodpecker is one such species, inhabiting the rocky and grassy hills of South Africa, and the Andean flicker is another.

The Swiss Ornithological Institute has set up a monitoring program to record breeding populations of woodland birds. This has shown that deadwood is an important habitat requirement for the black woodpecker, great spotted woodpecker, middle spotted woodpecker, lesser spotted woodpecker, European green woodpecker, and Eurasian three-toed woodpecker. Populations of all these species increased by varying amounts from 1990 to 2008. During this period, the amount of deadwood in the forest increased and the range of the white-backed woodpecker enlarged as it extended eastwards. With the exception of the green and middle-spotted woodpeckers, the increase in the amount of deadwood is likely to be the major factor explaining the population increase of these species.

==Behavior==

Most woodpeckers live solitary lives, but their behavior ranges from highly antisocial species that are aggressive towards their own kind, to species that live in groups. Solitary species defend such feeding resources as a termite colony or fruit-laden tree, driving away other conspecifics and returning frequently until the resource is exhausted. Aggressive behaviors include bill pointing and jabbing, head shaking, wing flicking, chasing, drumming, and vocalizations. Ritual actions do not usually result in contact, and birds may &quot;freeze&quot; for a while before they resume their dispute. The colored patches may be flouted, and in some instances, these antagonistic behaviors resemble courtship rituals.

Group-living species tend to be communal group breeders. In addition to these species, a number of species may join mixed-species foraging flocks with other insectivorous birds, although they tend to stay at the edges of these groups. Joining these flocks allows woodpeckers to decrease their anti-predator vigilance and increase their feeding rate. Woodpeckers are diurnal, roosting at night inside holes and crevices. In many species the roost will become the nest-site during the breeding season, but in some species they have separate functions; the grey-and-buff woodpecker makes several shallow holes for roosting which are quite distinct from its nesting site. Most birds roost alone and will oust intruders from their chosen site, but the Magellanic woodpecker and acorn woodpecker are cooperative roosters.

===Drumming===

Drumming is a form of nonvocal communication used by most species of woodpeckers, and involves the bill being repeatedly struck on a hard surface with great rapidity. After a pause, the drum roll is repeated, with each species having a pattern that is unique in the number of beats in the roll, the length of the roll, the length of the gap between rolls, and the cadence. The drumming is mainly a territorial call, equivalent to the song of a passerine. Woodpeckers choose a surface that resonates, such as a hollow tree, and may use man-made structures such as gutters and downpipes. Drumming serves for the mutual recognition of conspecifics and plays a part in courtship rituals. Individual birds are thought to be able to distinguish the drumming of their mates and those of their neighbors. Drumming can be reliably used to distinguish between multiple species in a region, even if those species are phenotypically similar. Cadence (or the mean number of drum beats per second) is heavily conserved within species. Comparative analyses within species between distant geographic populations have shown that cadence is heavily conserved across species&#x27; respective ranges, indicating that there likely are not &#x27;dialects&#x27; as seen in passerine song. Drumming in woodpeckers is controlled by a set of nuclei in the forebrain that closely resemble the brain regions that underlie song learning and production in many songbirds. A 2023 study revealed a strong association between extractive foraging and relative brain size across the Family &quot;Picidae,&quot; indicating that a larger brain does not necessarily result in more powerful drumming abilities, but is implicated in foraging behaviors, as the act of sensing and retrieving wood-boring larvae from woody substrates likely requires an increase in sensory and motor control capabilities.

===Calls===
Woodpeckers do not have such a wide range of songs and calls as do passerine birds, and the sounds they make tend to be simpler in structure. Calls produced include brief, high-pitched notes, trills, rattles, twittering, whistling, chattering, nasal churrs, screams, and wails. These calls are used by both sexes in communication and are related to the circumstances of the occasion; these include courtship, territorial disputes, and alarm calls. Each species has its own range of calls, which tend to be in the 1.0 to 2.5 kHz range for efficient transmission through forested environments. Mated couples may exchange muted, low-pitched calls, and nestlings often issue noisy begging calls from inside their nest cavity. The wrynecks have a more musical song, and in some areas, the song of the newly arrived Eurasian wryneck is considered to be the harbinger of spring. The piculets either have a song consisting of a long, descending trill, or a descending series of two to six (sometimes more) individual notes, and this song alerts ornithologists to the presence of the birds, as they are easily overlooked.

===Diet and feeding===
Most woodpecker species feed on insects and other invertebrates living under bark and in wood, but overall, the family is characterized by its dietary flexibility, with many species being both highly omnivorous and opportunistic. The diet includes ants, termites, beetles and their larvae, caterpillars, spiders, other arthropods, bird eggs, nestlings, small rodents, lizards, fruit, nuts, and sap. Many insects and their grubs are taken from living and dead trees by excavation. The bird may hear sounds from inside the timber indicating where creating a hole would be productive. Crustaceans, molluscs, and carrion may be eaten by some species, including the great spotted woodpecker, and bird feeders are visited for suet and domestic scraps.

Other means are also used to garner prey. Some species, such as the red-naped sapsucker, sally into the air to catch flying insects, and many species probe into crevices and under bark, or glean prey from leaves and twigs. The rufous woodpecker specialises in attacking the nests of arboreal ants, and the buff-spotted woodpecker feeds on and nests in termite mounds. Other species, such as the wrynecks and the Andean flicker, feed wholly or partly on the ground.

Ecologically, woodpeckers help to keep trees healthy by keeping them from suffering mass infestations. The family is noted for its ability to acquire wood-boring grubs from the trunks and branches, whether the timber is alive or dead. Having hammered a hole into the wood, the prey is extracted by use of a long, barbed tongue. Woodpeckers consume beetles that burrow into trees, removing as many as 85% of emerald ash borer larvae from individual ash trees.

The ability to excavate allows woodpeckers to obtain tree sap, an important source of food for some species. Most famously, the sapsuckers (genus &quot;Sphyrapicus&quot;) feed in this fashion, but the technique is not restricted to these, and others such as the acorn woodpecker and white-headed woodpecker also feed on sap. The technique was once thought to be restricted to the New World, but Old World species, such as the Arabian woodpecker and great spotted woodpecker, also feed in this way.

===Breeding===
All members of the family Picidae nest in cavities, nearly always in the trunks and branches of trees, well away from the foliage. Where possible, an area of rotten wood surrounded by sound timber is used. Where trees are in short supply, the gilded flicker and ladder-backed woodpecker excavate holes in cactus, and the Andean flicker and ground woodpecker dig holes in earth banks. The campo flicker sometimes chooses termite mounds, the rufous woodpecker prefers to use ants&#x27; nests in trees and the bamboo woodpecker specialises in bamboos. Woodpeckers also excavate nest holes in residential and commercial structures and wooden utility poles.

Woodpeckers and piculets excavate their own nests, but wrynecks do not, and need to find pre-existing cavities. A typical nest has a round entrance hole that just fits the bird, leading to an enlarged vertical chamber below. No nesting material is used, apart from some wood chips produced during the excavation; other wood chips are liberally scattered on the ground, thus providing visual evidence of the site of the nest. Many species of woodpeckers excavate one hole per breeding season, sometimes after multiple attempts. It takes around a month to finish the job and abandoned holes are used by other birds and mammals that are cavity nesters unable to excavate their own holes.

Cavities are in great demand for nesting by other cavity nesters, so woodpeckers face competition for the nesting sites they excavate from the moment the hole becomes usable. This may come from other species of woodpecker, or other cavity-nesting birds such as swallows and starlings. Woodpeckers may aggressively harass potential competitors, and also use other strategies to reduce the chance of being usurped from their nesting sites; for example, the red-crowned woodpecker digs its nest in the underside of a small branch, which reduces the chance that a larger species will take it over and expand it.

Members of Picidae are typically monogamous, with a few species breeding cooperatively and some polygamy reported in a few others. Polyandry, where a female raises two broods with two separate males, has also been reported in the West Indian woodpecker. Another unusual social system is that of the acorn woodpecker, which is a polygynandrous cooperative breeder where groups of up to 12 individuals breed and help to raise the young. Young birds from previous years may stay behind to help raise the group&#x27;s young, and studies have found reproductive success for the group goes up with group size, but individual success goes down. Birds may be forced to remain in groups due to a lack of habitat to which to disperse.
A pair works together to help build the nest, incubate the eggs, and raise their altricial young. In most species, though, the male does most of the nest excavation and takes the night shift while incubating the eggs. A clutch usually consists of two to five round, white eggs. Since these birds are cavity nesters, their eggs do not need to be camouflaged and the white color helps the parents to see them in dim light. The eggs are incubated for about 11–14 days before they hatch. About 18–30 days are then needed before the chicks are fully fledged and ready to leave the nest. In most species, soon after this, the young are left to fend for themselves, exceptions being the various social species, and the Hispaniolan woodpecker, where adults continue to feed their young for several months. In general, cavity nesting is a successful strategy and a higher proportion of young is reared than is the case with birds that nest in the open. In Africa, several species of honeyguide are brood parasites of woodpeckers.

==Systematics and evolutionary history==

The Picidae are just one of nine living families in the order Piciformes. Other members of this group, such as the jacamars, puffbirds, barbets, toucans, and honeyguides, have traditionally been thought to be closely related to the woodpecker family (true woodpeckers, piculets, wrynecks, and sapsuckers). The clade Pici (woodpeckers, barbets, toucans, and honeyguides) is well supported and shares a zygodactyl foot with the Galbuli (puffbirds and jacamars). More recently, several DNA sequence analyses have confirmed that Pici and Galbuli are sister groups.

The phylogenetic relationship between the woodpeckers and the eight other families in the order Piciformes is shown in the cladogram below. The number of species in each family is taken from the list maintained by Frank Gill, Pamela C. Rasmussen and David Donsker on behalf of the International Ornithological Committee (IOC).
The name Picidae for the family was introduced by English zoologist William Elford Leach in a guide to the contents of the British Museum published in 1819. The phylogeny has been updated according to new knowledge about convergence patterns and evolutionary history. Most notably, the relationship of the Picinae genera has been largely clarified, and the Antillean piculet was found to be a surviving offshoot of protowoodpeckers. Genetic analysis supports the monophyly of the Picidae, which seem to have originated in the Old World, but the geographic origins of the Picinae is unclear. The Picumninae are returned as paraphyletic. Morphological and behavioural characters, in addition to DNA evidence, highlights genus &quot;Hemicircus&quot; as the sister group of all remaining true woodpeckers, besides a sister-group relationship between the true woodpecker tribes Dendropicini and Malarpicini.

The evolutionary history of this group is not well documented, but the known fossils allow some preliminary conclusions; the earliest known modern picids were piculet-like forms of the Late Oligocene, about 25 million years ago (Mya). By that time, however, the group was already present in the Americas and Europe, and they actually may have evolved much earlier, maybe as early as the Early Eocene (50 Mya). The modern subfamilies appear to be rather young by comparison; until the mid-Miocene (10–15 Mya), all picids seem to have been small or mid-sized birds similar to a mixture between a piculet and a wryneck. A feather enclosed in fossil amber from the Dominican Republic, dated to about 25 Mya, however, seems to indicate that the Nesoctitinae were already a distinct lineage by then.

Stepwise adaptations for drilling, tapping, and climbing head first on vertical surfaces have been suggested. The last common ancestor of woodpeckers (Picidae) was incapable of climbing up tree trunks or excavating nest cavities by drilling with its beak. The first adaptations for drilling (including reinforced rhamphotheca, frontal overhang, and processus dorsalis pterygoidei) evolved in the ancestral lineage of piculets and true woodpeckers. Additional adaptations for drilling and tapping (enlarged condylus lateralis of the quadrate and fused lower mandible) have evolved in the ancestral lineage of true woodpeckers (&quot;Hemicircus&quot; excepting). The inner rectrix pairs became stiffened, and the pygostyle lamina was enlarged in the ancestral lineage of true woodpeckers (&quot;Hemicircus&quot; included), which facilitated climbing head first up tree limbs. Genus &quot;Hemicircus&quot; excepting, the tail feathers were further transformed for specialized support, the pygostyle disc became greatly enlarged, and the ectropodactyl toe arrangement evolved. These latter characters may have facilitated enormous increases in body size in some lineages.

Prehistoric representatives of the extant Picidae genera are treated in the genus articles. An enigmatic form based on a coracoid, found in Pliocene deposits of New Providence in the Bahamas, has been described as &quot;Bathoceleus hyphalus&quot; and probably also is a woodpecker.

The following cladogram is based on the comprehensive molecular phylogenetic study of the woodpeckers published in 2017 together with the list of bird species maintained by Frank Gill, Pamela Rasmussen and David Donsker on behalf of the International Ornithological Committee (IOC). The Cuban green woodpecker in the monotypic genus &quot;Xiphidiopicus&quot; was not included in the study. The relative positions of Picumninae, Sasiinae and Picinae in the cladogram are uncertain. In the 2017 study the results depended upon which of two different statistical procedures were used to analyse the DNA sequence data. One method found that Sasiinae was sister to Picinae (as shown below), the other method found that Sasiinae was sister to a clade containing both Picumninae and Picinae.

==Relationship with humans==
In general, humans consider woodpeckers in a favourable light; they are viewed as interesting birds and fascinating to watch as they drum or forage, but their activities are not universally appreciated. Many woodpecker species are known to excavate holes in buildings, fencing, and utility poles, creating health and/or safety issues for affected structures. Such activity is very difficult to discourage and can be costly to repair.

Woodpeckers also drum on various reverberatory structures on buildings such as gutters, downspouts, chimneys, vents, and aluminium sheeting. Drumming is a less-forceful type of pecking that serves to establish territory and attract mates. Houses with shingles or wooden boarding are also attractive as possible nesting or roosting sites, especially when close to large trees or woodland. Several exploratory holes may be made, especially at the junctions of vertical boards or at the corners of tongue-and-groove boarding. The birds may also drill holes in houses as they forage for insect larvae and pupae hidden behind the woodwork.

Woodpeckers sometimes cause problems when they raid fruit crops, but their foraging activities are mostly beneficial as they control forest insect pests such as the woodboring beetles that create galleries behind the bark and can kill trees. They also eat ants, which may be tending sap-sucking pests such as mealybugs, as is the case with the rufous woodpecker in coffee plantations in India. Woodpeckers can serve as indicator species, demonstrating the quality of the habitat. Their hole-making abilities make their presence in an area an important part of the ecosystem, because these cavities are used for breeding and roosting by many bird species that are unable to excavate their own holes, as well as being used by various mammals and invertebrates.

The spongy bones of the woodpecker&#x27;s skull and the flexibility of its beak, both of which provide protection for the brain when drumming, have provided inspiration to engineers; a black box needs to survive intact when a plane falls from the sky, and modelling the black box with regard to a woodpecker&#x27;s anatomy has increased the resistance of this device to damage 60-fold. The design of protective helmets is another field being influenced by the study of woodpeckers.

One of the accounts of the founding of Rome, preserved in the work known as &quot;Origo Gentis Romanae (unknown)&quot;, refers to a legend of a woodpecker bringing food to the boys Romulus and Remus during the time they were abandoned in the wild, thus enabling them to survive and play their part in history.

==Popular culture==

Woody Woodpecker is an animated character that appeared in theatrical short films produced between 1940 and 1972.

The Pokémon Pikipek was introduced in the seventh generation games Pokémon Sun and Moon. In addition to being a visual homage to a pileated woodpecker, entries in the game&#x27;s &quot;Pokédex&quot; encyclopedia describes the small &quot;Flying-type&quot; as analogous to its real-world counterpart. Its later forms (called &quot;evolutions&quot; in the series) Trumbeak and Toucannon resemble a honeyguide and toucan, respectively, perhaps as a tongue-in-cheek reference to the phylogenetic relationship woodpeckers share with these &quot;Piciformes&quot; families.

== Status and conservation ==
In a global survey of the risk of extinction faced by the various bird families, woodpeckers were the only bird family to have significantly fewer species at risk than would be expected. 
Nevertheless, several woodpeckers are under threat as their habitats are destroyed. Being woodland birds, deforestation and clearance of land for agriculture and other purposes can reduce populations dramatically. Some species adapt to living in plantations and secondary growth, or to open countryside with forest remnants and scattered trees, but some do not. A few species have even flourished when they have adapted to man-made habitats. There are few conservation projects directed primarily at woodpeckers, but they benefit whenever their habitat is conserved. The red-cockaded woodpecker has been the focus of much conservation effort in the southeastern United States, with artificial cavities being constructed in the longleaf pines they favour as nesting sites.

Two species of woodpeckers in the Americas, the ivory-billed woodpecker is critically endangered and the imperial woodpecker is classified as extinct in the wild, with some authorities believing them extinct, though possible but disputed ongoing sightings of ivory-billed woodpeckers have been made in the United States and a small population may survive in Cuba. A critically endangered species is the Okinawa woodpecker from Japan, with a single declining population of a few hundred birds. It is threatened by deforestation, golf course, dam, and helipad construction, road building, and agricultural development.

== Brain impact research ==

=== Anatomy ===
Woodpeckers possess many sophisticated shock-absorption mechanisms that help protect them from head injury. Micro-CT scans show that plate-like spongy bones are in the skull with an uneven distribution, highly accumulated in the forehead and occiput but not in other regions.  Along with the long hyoid bone “safety belt” the woodpecker has uneven beak lengths which drastically reduce strains when compared to equal length. Models have shown that pecking force is changed to strain energy and stored into the body at around 99% absorption while 1% is in the head. The head also has many factors that reduce strain to the brain and small portions of energy are dissipated into the form of heat; therefore the pecks are always intermittent. Others dispute shock-absorption in the head (which reduces the force of pecking) but instead point to adaptations within the brain itself.

Tau protein accumulation is associated with chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), and thus has been studied in sports where athletes suffer repeated concussions. Tau is important as it helps hold together and stabilize brain neurons. Woodpeckers&#x27; brains share similarities to humans with CTE showing most build-up in the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain. It is not yet known whether these accumulations are pathological or the result of behavioral changes. More research is being done on the subject and the woodpecker is a suitable animal model to study. The orientation of the brain within the skull increases the area of contact when pecking to reduce stress on the brain, and their small size helps, given the acceleration speeds.

=== Mechanical properties ===
Straight-line trajectory was theorized to be the reason why woodpeckers do not injure themselves, since centripetal forces were the cause of concussion, but they do not always peck in straight lines, so they produce and resist centripetal forces. Laboratory tests show that the woodpeckers&#x27; cranial bone produces a significantly higher Young&#x27;s modulus and ultimate strength scores compared to other birds its size. The cranial bone has a high bone mineral density with plate-like structures that are thick with high numbers of trabeculae that are spaced closely together which all may lead to lower deformation while pecking.

The jaw apparatus was studied, looking into its cushioning effects. When comparing the same impact to the beak and to the forehead, the forehead experiences an impact force 1.72 times that of the beak, due to the contact time being 3.25 ms in the forehead and 4.9 ms in the beak. This is impulse momentum where impulse is the integral of force over time. The quadrate bone and joints play an important role in extending impact time, which decreases impact load to brain tissue.

== Bio-inspired ideas ==

=== Beams ===
Bio-inspired honeycomb sandwich beams are inspired by the woodpecker&#x27;s skull design; this beam&#x27;s goal is to withstand continuous impacts without the need of replacement. The BHSB is composed of carbon fiber-reinforced plastic (CFRP), this is to mimic the high-strength beak. Next is a rubber layer core for the hyoid bone for absorbing and spreading impact, a second core layer of aluminum honeycomb that is porous and light like the woodpecker&#x27;s spongey bone for impact cushioning. The final layer is the same as the first a CFRP to act as the skull bone. Bio-inspired honeycomb sandwich beams when compared to conventional beams reduced area damage by 50–80% and carried 40 to 5% of the level of stresses in the bottom layer while having an impact-resistance efficiency 1.65 to 16.22 times higher.

<text>The Criollos de Caguas are a professional basketball team based in Caguas, Puerto Rico. They play in the Baloncesto Superior Nacional (BSN) League, the top division basketball league in Puerto Rico. They are the league&#x27;s defending champions, having defeated the Osos de Manatí in 7 games in the final of the 2024 Baloncesto Superior Nacional season.

==History==
The &quot;Criollos&quot; professional basketball team began to play during the 1969 season, joining their counterparts the &quot;Criollos&quot; of baseball. Unlike their baseball counterparts, however, the basketball &quot;Criollos&quot; did not enjoy a wild and steady success, instead settling for moderate success. 

The &quot;Criollos&quot;, with Cayey&#x27;s resident Willie Melendez and Bayamon-born Willie Quiñones on their side, reached the semi-finals in 1985. Melendez was traded to the &quot;Polluelos de Aibonito&quot; the following season, however, and The Criollos then went on a downward spiral, going 12–21 in 1986, 7–23 in 1987, 9–24 in 1988 and 10–20 in 1989. Quinones, although the Criollos only once posted a winning record with him as a player, always refused to be traded as he declared over and over again that he would only play for his hometown&#x27;s team. He and Melendez (Melendez with 6,123) are members of the exclusive group of basketball players that have scored 5,000 or more points in Puerto Rican basketball history, 5,000 points being a coveted number because of the relatively small number of games played each year (from 30 to 33 games per season).

In 1987, Caguas Mayor Angel O. Berrios took over as team owner. In the 1990s, a Criollos revival began, and he hired such players as Luis Allende and Gary Joe Burgos. The Criollos reached the semi-finals again in 2002, and got to the playoffs in 2003, losing in the first round.

The &quot;Criollos&quot; decided not to play during the 2005 BSN season, partly because of economical reasons, but the team returned for the 2006 season and won the tournament for the first time in their history after beating the Cangrejeros de Santurce in the finals.

The Criollos entered the league&#x27;s &quot;Super 6&quot; semifinals. They remained with possibilities of earning advancing until the final stages of the phase, gathering 20 points. On June 10, 2008, one of the team&#x27;s games against the Capitanes de Arecibo was cancelled when the league suspected that one of the Capitanes players was playing against the league&#x27;s rules.

The team reached the BSN finals during the 2024 season, where they faced the Osos de Manatí. Nearly all games were tightly contested, with the teams taking turns winning matches. In Game 2, with the Criollos down by three points, Travis Trice made a buzzer-beater, half-court shot to tie the game and send it to overtime. The Criollos eventually won the game, 109:104, with Trice making another key three-point shot during the overtime, to tie the series at one-win-apiece. As the Osos had a 3–2 series advantage following Game 5, and Game 6 went into overtime just like Game 2, the Criollos were on the brink of losing, but managed to win the game by one point. On August 30, 2024, the Criollos won Game 7 of the BSN Finals 96:81, the biggest margin victory in the series by either team, winning the series 4–3, and the championship.

<text>The British Broadcasting Company Limited (BBC) was a short-lived British commercial broadcasting company formed on 18 October 1922 by British and American electrical companies doing business in the United Kingdom. Licensed by the British General Post Office, its original office was located on the second floor of Magnet House, the GEC buildings in London and consisted of a room and a small antechamber.

On 14 December 1922, John Reith was hired to become the managing director of the company at that address. The company later moved its offices to the premises of the Marconi Company. The BBC as a commercial broadcasting company did not sell air time but it did carry a number of sponsored programmes paid for by British newspapers. On 31 December 1926, the company was dissolved and its assets were transferred to the non-commercial and crown-chartered British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC).

==Brief history==
===Post Office stations===
In Britain prior to 1922, the General Post Office (GPO) retained exclusive rights given to it by the government to manage and control all means of mass communication with the exception of the printed word. The laws which evolved into the Wireless Telegraphy Act of 1947, upon which all modern British communication laws are established, concern:
* the establishment of a for purposes of broadcasting,
* the use of a station for purposes of broadcasting,
* the installing of a transmitter or receiver, and the use of a transmitter or receiver.

All these activities require a government licence which was originally granted by the General Post Office.

===&quot;Electrical&quot; post offices===
The invention of the electrical telegraph came under the control of the Telegraph Act of 1869 which was based upon a law that forbade the encoding of electrical cables with messages without a licence. The messages were viewed as electrical forms of a letter. This invention was followed by the wireless telegraphy which was then placed under the Wireless Telegraphy Act 1904.

===Advent of wireless broadcasting===
In the US, the development of the telegraph, wireless telegraph, telephone and wireless telephony proceeded according to the dictates of entrepreneurial commercial interests concerned only with supply and demand for profit. Beginning in August 1920, commercial broadcasting stations programming to the general public had begun broadcasting in the United States, licensed by the Department of Commerce (these duties were transferred in 1934 to the Federal Communications Commission) and offering several hours of programming, usually at night. Two of the first stations were WWJ in Detroit (then known as 8MK) and KDKA in Pittsburgh (which has claimed to be the first station specifically licensed for commercial broadcasting; however commercial licences were actually not awarded until September 1921). These pioneering stations continue in daily 24-hour operation today under the ownership and management of CBS.

In the United Kingdom, all broadcasts were licensed by the GPO, who were reluctant to license any fully commercial stations and only &#x27;experimental&#x27; stations were allowed on air.

===First test broadcasts===
Beginning in 1920, a number of licences were issued to British and American subsidiary companies in Britain for the purpose of conducting experimental transmissions under terms of a licence issued by the General Post Office in accordance with the Wireless Telegraphy Act 1904. On 15 June 1920, Marconi&#x27;s Wireless Telegraph Company, Limited, in Chelmsford, Essex, was licensed to conduct an experimental broadcast from the New Street Works factory, featuring Dame Nellie Melba. The signal was received throughout Europe and as far as Newfoundland, Canada. Further transmissions were also made.

===Military intervention===
On 23 November 1920, the General Post Office halted all further transmissions due to complaints of alleged interference with military communications. As the number of wireless receiving sets increased during the early 1920s, the General Post Office came under extreme pressure from hobby listeners to allow the experimental wireless broadcasts to resume.

===Test transmissions resume===
On 14 February 1922, which was two years after ceasing their original transmissions, the Marconi Company was issued a licence for experimental transmissions under the call sign 2MT. Peter Eckersley was given charge of providing both the broadcast entertainment and the engineering. The station operated out of a hut in a field at Writtle near Chelmsford.

On 11 May 1922, the Marconi Company was issued another licence for experimental broadcasts from a station identified as 2LO which was located at Marconi House in the Strand, London. The programme consisted of a boxing commentary by W. Southey of the fight between Kid Lewis and Georges Carpentier. Further tests were also advertised as demonstrations of &quot;&quot;Wireless Telegraphy and Telephony&quot; which were &quot;subject to permission from the Postmaster General&quot;&quot;. These demonstrations were performed by the &quot;Demonstration Department (of) Marconi&#x27;s London Wireless Station 2LO&quot;.

On 16 May 1922, the Metropolitan Vickers Company Ltd. (&quot;Metrovick&quot;) commenced test broadcasting from its own station in Manchester, identified as 2ZY.

===A committee is appointed===
On 23 May a committee of representatives was appointed from the &quot;Big Six&quot; companies – the Marconi Company, Metropolitan-Vickers, Radio Communication Company, British Thomson-Houston, General Electric Company and Western Electric. The Post Office also pressed for the inclusion of a representative from the smaller firms manufacturing radio equipment in the UK – Frank Phillips of Burndept. George Campbell was one of the members on the committee.

==Incorporation and shares==
On 18 October 1922 the British Broadcasting Company Ltd. was incorporated under the Companies Acts 1908 to 1917 with a share capital of £60,006, with cumulative ordinary shares valued at £1 each. No further capital could be issued without the Postmaster-General&#x27;s consent:

The shares were equally held by six companies:
* Marconi Company
* Metropolitan-Vickers
* Radio Communication Company
* British Thomson-Houston
* General Electric Company
* Western Electric

The shareholders gave the BBC the benefit of their respective patents, and only radio sets supplied by BBC companies were permitted to be licensed to receive programmes. The ability of the shareholders to profit from the BBC was limited as part of the agreement with the Postmaster General:

===Directors===
The initial remit of the British Broadcasting Company was to establish a nationwide network of radio transmitters many of which had originally been owned by member companies, from which the BBC was to provide a national broadcasting service.

===International influences===
The British Broadcasting Company was formed using a blueprint that the United States Navy and the General Electric Company had attempted to institute in the USA. Early in World War I, all of the ship-to-shore and transatlantic radio stations controlled by a US subsidiary company of Marconi&#x27;s Wireless Telegraph Company, Limited in Chelmsford, England, were seized and handed to the US Navy for the duration of the War. After the War, the US Congress forced the US Navy to divest itself of the stations and they turned to the General Electric Company which in 1919 formed a subsidiary called the Radio Corporation of America. With the US Navy on its board, RCA then absorbed the former Marconi stations. In 1926 RCA created the National Broadcasting Company, the first network in the United States. Peaking in the 1930s, there were unsuccessful attempts to bring all radio communications in America back under single monopoly control by using the patent laws.

The Western Electric Company Ltd. in the UK was originally formed as a subsidiary of American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&amp;T) in the USA where it served as its manufacturing subsidiary to equip the AT&amp;T Bell Telephone system.

The British Thomson-Houston Company Ltd. was a controlled UK subsidiary of the General Electric Company in the USA. The Hotpoint Electric Appliance Company Ltd. was formed by British Thomson-Houston (BTH) in 1921.

The only other company later added to the original shareholders of the British Broadcasting Company Ltd. was Burndept Limited. It represented the interests of over twenty small electrical manufacturers in the UK.

===Income===
The British Broadcasting Company did not sell air time for commercials but its licence did allow for it to carry sponsored programming, and eight such sponsored broadcasts were aired in 1925. However, the main source of its income was from the sale of radio receiving sets and transmitters manufactured by its shareholding member companies as well as from a portion of the government (GPO) licence fee that had to be purchased by BBC listeners.

<text>Super Mario Bros. (also known as Super Mario Bros.: The Movie) is a 1993 science fantasy adventure comedy film based on Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;Mario&quot; franchise. The first American feature-length live-action film based on a video game, it was directed by the husband-and-wife team of Rocky Morton and Annabel Jankel, with a screenplay by Parker Bennett, Terry Runté and Ed Solomon and distributed by Buena Vista Pictures through Hollywood Pictures. It follows brothers Mario (Bob Hoskins) and Luigi (John Leguizamo) in their quest to rescue Princess Daisy (Samantha Mathis) from a dystopian parallel universe ruled by the ruthless President Koopa (Dennis Hopper).

Development began after producer Roland Joffé obtained the rights to the &quot;Mario&quot; franchise from Nintendo. Given free creative license by Nintendo, which believed the &quot;Mario&quot; brand was strong enough for experimentation, the screenwriters envisioned &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; as a subversive comedy influenced by &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; (1984) and &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; (1939). Its dinosaur-centric theme was inspired by the franchise&#x27;s most recent game, &quot;Super Mario World&quot; (1990), with elements drawn from fairy tales and contemporary American culture. The production introduced several filmmaking techniques considered innovative in the transition from practical to digital visual effects, including the use of Autodesk Flame. Filming took place from May to July 1992.

Released on May 28, 1993, &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; was a financial failure, grossing worldwide against a budget of . Although the film received generally unfavorable reviews from critics at release and appeared on several lists of the worst films ever made, it has developed a cult following over the years. In 2013, a webcomic sequel was produced in collaboration with Bennett.

After &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot;, Nintendo would not license another film based on the &quot;Super Mario&quot; game series until an animated reboot titled &quot;The Super Mario Bros. Movie&quot;, released in 2023.

==Plot==

Following the impact of a meteorite into Earth sixty-five million years ago, the universe is split into a pair of parallel dimensions. Surviving dinosaurs escape into the new dimension, evolving into a humanoid race and founding a city known as Dinohattan. In 1973, a mysterious woman leaves a large egg and a fragment of some sort at a Catholic orphanage in Brooklyn, New York City and the egg hatches into a baby girl.

Twenty years later, Italian-American brothers Mario and Luigi working as plumbers in Brooklyn are close to being driven out of business by mafioso Anthony Scapelli&#x27;s construction company. Luigi meets Daisy, a New York University archaeology student who shows him she has been excavating for dinosaur bones under the Brooklyn Bridge. There, they witness Scapelli&#x27;s cronies sabotaging it by leaving the water pipes open. Mario and Luigi fix it, but Iggy and Spike — henchmen and cousins of President &quot;King&quot; Koopa, the illegitimate leader of the other dimension — kidnap Daisy after mistakenly kidnapping other girls, including Mario&#x27;s girlfriend, Daniella. The duo pursue them through an interdimensional portal to Dinohattan, where they lose track of Daisy and her necklace, which is stolen by Big Bertha, the bouncer of a local nightclub.

Daisy learns she is descended from dinosaurs and the long-lost princess of the other dimension. Her father, the king, was devolved by Koopa, then a general in the king&#x27;s army, into a fungus that has since spread across Dinohattan; her mother, the queen, took her to Brooklyn, only to be crushed to death when the portal was sealed. Iggy and Spike realize that they lost Daisy&#x27;s necklace, which contains a fragment of the meteorite that will allow it to merge the dimensions. They believe only Daisy can do so because of her royal heritage. Mario and Luigi break out of the city&#x27;s local prison and go to rescue Daisy, aided by the fungus as well as Toad, a good-natured guitarist who was devolved into a Goomba, a semi-humanoid dinosaur, as punishment for his protests against Koopa. Daisy&#x27;s own escape attempt is aided by Yoshi, a pet of the royal family, and Iggy and Spike, who decide to turn on Koopa following their cousin&#x27;s attempt to enhance their intelligence. While Luigi rescues Daisy, Mario saves Daniella and the other girls mistaken for the princess.

Koopa&#x27;s jealous girlfriend, Lena, tries unsuccessfully to murder Daisy, then obtains the fragment with plans to overthrow him, but is killed when she merges the dimensions. In Brooklyn, Koopa attempts his takeover by turning Scapelli into an ape, but Luigi and Daisy remove the fragment from the meteorite and the dimensions separate. Mario and Luigi obtain handheld devolution devices from Toad and use them to defeat Koopa by devolving him into a Tyrannosaurus rex, then primeval slime. Daisy&#x27;s father is evolved back to normal and regains his position and the citizens celebrate and immediately destroy anything involving Koopa. Daisy decides to stay in Dinohattan and kisses Luigi goodbye as she opens the portal for him and Mario to return home.

Three weeks later, the Mario brothers are heralded as heroes. Daisy arrives at Mario and Luigi&#x27;s apartment in Brooklyn and asks them to help her on a new mission.

==Production==
===Development===
Beginning in the 1980s, numerous producers attempted to purchase the rights to make a Super Mario Bros. film. In 1989, Nintendo gave DIC Entertainment the right to make a film out of &quot;The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!&quot;, but it was never produced. In 1990, Dustin Hoffman attempted to purchase the rights to produce a film with himself as Mario, Danny DeVito as Luigi, and Barry Levinson directing. However, this was not made because of scheduling conflicts for DeVito. Jake Eberts then purchased the film rights and started developing an adaptation to be directed by Penny Marshall.

Producer Roland Joffé first came up with the idea of making a live-action adaptation of the video games himself during a script meeting at Eberts&#x27; production company Lightmotive. Joffé met Nintendo of America president and Hiroshi Yamauchi&#x27;s son-in law, Minoru Arakawa. He presented Arakawa with an initial draft of the script. One month after their meeting, Joffé went to Nintendo&#x27;s headquarters in Kyoto to meet Hiroshi Yamauchi. He pitched to Yamauchi the storyline which led to Nintendo receiving interest in the project. Joffé left with a $2 million contract giving the temporary control of the character of Mario over to Joffé. Nintendo retained merchandising rights for the film through a &quot;creative partnership&quot; with Lightmotive.

When Yamauchi asked Joffé why Nintendo should sell the rights to Lightmotive over a major company, Joffé assured them that Nintendo would have more control over the film. However, Nintendo had no interest in creative control and believed the Mario brand was strong enough to allow an experiment with an outside industry. Joffé said, &quot;I think they looked at the movie as some sort of strange creature that was kind of rather intriguing to see if we could walk or not&quot;.

=== Writing ===
The first screenplay was written by Oscar-winning screenwriter Barry Morrow. His story followed brothers Mario and Luigi on an existential road trip so similar to Morrow&#x27;s prior &quot;Rain Man&quot; that production titled the script &quot;Drain Man&quot;. Morrow described his screenplay as &quot;a study in contrast, like Laurel and Hardy or Abbott and Costello&quot;, that would have &quot;an odyssey and a quest&quot; like the game itself. Co-producer Fred Caruso later said that Morrow&#x27;s story was &quot;more of a serious drama piece as opposed to a fun comedy&quot;. One of the earliest scripts involved being closer to the video game and Arnold Schwarzenegger as King Koopa.

Screenwriters Jim Jennewein and Tom S. Parker were brought on next to write a more traditional adaptation. Jennewein said, &quot;So right away we knew that the best way to do this is to essentially have a journey into this world, not unlike &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;.&quot; His and Parker&#x27;s take on the story was to subvert and satirize fairy tale clichés, and to focus on the relationship between Mario and Luigi. Jennewein said, &quot;Essentially what we did was what &quot;Shrek&quot; did [...] And we knew the story had to be about the brothers and that the emotional through-line would be about the brothers.&quot; Greg Beeman of &quot;License to Drive&quot; was attached to direct and development had already moved into pre-production, but the failure of Beeman&#x27;s recent &quot;Mom and Dad Save the World&quot; led to his dismissal by nervous producers. Joffé then offered Harold Ramis the director position, but though he was a fan of the video game, Ramis declined the opportunity, which he later said he was &quot;glad&quot; about and which the Associated Press would observe was his &quot;smartest career decision&quot;.

Joffé said, &quot;We tried some various avenues that didn&#x27;t work, that came up too medieval or somehow wasn&#x27;t the right thing. I felt the project was taking a wrong turn [...] And that&#x27;s when I began thinking of &quot;Max Headroom&quot;.&quot; Joffé traveled to Rome to meet with creators Rocky Morton and Annabel Jankel. Morton said, &quot;We come from the Tim Burton school of filmmaking, because our background is in animation and comic books [...] So we started off basing everything in reality, and then tried to have fun and exaggerate it as much as possible.&quot; Joffé, Morton, and Jankel agreed their approach to adapting the video games should follow the darker tone popularized by the 1989 &quot;Batman&quot; and 1990 &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot;. Joffé said, &quot;This wasn&#x27;t Snow White and the Seven Dinosaurs [...] The dino world was dark. We didn&#x27;t want to hold back.&quot; Morton described the film as a prequel to the video games that tells the &quot;true story&quot; behind Nintendo&#x27;s inspiration. Joffé viewed the games as a &quot;mixture of Japanese fairy tales and bits of modern America&quot;, and wanted to create a &quot;slightly mythic vision of New York&quot;. Screenwriter Parker Bennett elaborated: &quot;Our take on it was that Nintendo interpreted the events from our story and came up with the video game. We basically worked backwards.&quot; The film also took inspiration from &quot;Die Hard&quot;, &quot;Mad Max&quot;, and &quot;Blade Runner&quot;.

The concept of a parallel universe inhabited by dinosaurs was inspired by Dinosaur Land from the recently released &quot;Super Mario World&quot;. Jankel envisioned the parallel dimension as &quot;a whole world with a reptile point-of-view, dominated by aggressive, primordial behavior and basic instincts&quot;, while Morton considered the ecological and technological consequences of a dinosaur society that holds fossil fuels sacred. Joffé noted, &quot;It&#x27;s a wonderful parody of New York and heavy industry [...] We call it the New Brutalism.&quot; Screenwriters Parker Bennett and Terry Runté were tasked with balancing comedy with a darker tone: Bennett said, &quot;&quot;Ghostbusters&quot; was the model [...] We were aiming towards funny, but kind of weird and dark.&quot;

Though working well with the directors, Bennett and Runté were dismissed by the producers for being too comedic and the British writing team of Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais were brought on to deliver a more adult and feminist tone. Princess Daisy and Lena&#x27;s roles were expanded and Bertha was introduced as a black woman. With this script, the main cast signed, and Bob Hoskins was finally convinced to take the role of Mario. The film officially moved into pre-production. However, producers Joffé and Eberts feared the project had both skewed too far from the intended young adult and family audiences, and had become too effects-heavy to film within budget, so without informing directors Morton and Jankel or the signed cast they hired screenwriters Ed Solomon and Ryan Rowe to provide a more family-friendly script with more restrained effects requirements. The script doctoring was partially motivated by a studio purchasing the film&#x27;s distribution rights. The cast only discovered the new screenplay upon arriving in Wilmington, North Carolina.

Directors Morton and Jankel considered leaving the project but decided to stay after discussing together and realizing that no other director could at that point understand the material enough to properly adapt it. Morton and Jankel also said they owed it to the cast and crew and believed they could reclaim their vision during production. Rowe returned home to work on another project, but Solomon remained for several weeks to provide additional rewrites. Without invitation, Bennett and Runté took a road trip to Wilmington whereupon they were immediately re-hired. They would remain through production to provide final rewrites, dialogue for ADR, and the dialogue for the expository animated dinosaur opening. The intelligent fungus was inspired by both the Mushroom Kingdom from the games and tabloid reports of a discovered gigantic fungus. Production Designer David Snyder recalled: &quot;As each script developed the fungus was sort of a metaphor for the mushroom element in a Nintendo game.&quot; Joffé reflected, &quot;For me a screenplay is never finished [...] You work a screenplay all the time. When you bring actors in a screenplay goes through another evolution. So you can say that rather like the fungus in the movie the screenplay constantly evolves.&quot;

===Casting===
After securing the rights to the film, Lightmotive began the casting for the characters. Hoffman continued to express interest in portraying Mario. However, Arakawa did not believe that he was right for the role. DeVito was offered both the role of Mario and director. Arnold Schwarzenegger and Michael Keaton were approached to play Koopa, but both turned down the role. The studio considered Tom Hanks for the role of Luigi, but a string of recent box-office failures dropped him from consideration. Actors Bob Hoskins and John Leguizamo were ultimately cast as Mario and Luigi.

Initially, Hoskins disliked the script and did not want to do another children&#x27;s film: &quot;I&#x27;d done &quot;Roger Rabbit&quot;. I&#x27;d done &quot;Hook&quot;. I didn&#x27;t want to become like Dick Van Dyke.&quot; Hoskins wondered how he would prepare for the role, saying, &quot;I&#x27;m the right shape. I&#x27;ve got a mustache. I worked as a plumber&#x27;s apprentice for about three weeks and set the plumber&#x27;s boots on fire with a blowtorch.&quot; Producer Roland Joffé kept sending Hoskins new script revisions until finally, the actor agreed. Co-director Jankel said, &quot;Bob was a no brainer [...] Unabashed shameless physical type casting. Bob was brilliant at assuming the character, in a slightly amplified way that would be in keeping with his supposed subsequent game iteration.&quot;

Leguizamo said, &quot;What I liked about the script was the adventure and the action that was involved&quot;. He joked that &quot;You always see a lot of Italians playing Latin people, like Al Pacino did in &quot;Scarface&quot;. Now it&#x27;s our turn!&quot; Jankel said, &quot;John was a brilliant up and coming stand-up comic and actor [...] We went to see him at Second City, and we were 100% sold. He had a wonderful combination of empathy and irreverence but was entirely without guile. It was not specifically scripted to be cast with a Hispanic or Latino actor, but it made perfect sense that the Mario Bros. themselves should be this contemporary unconventional family, so the small unit of just two, couldn&#x27;t be pegged as one thing or another.&quot; Mojo Nixon said he was cast as Toad because the production wanted an actual musician for the character, but their first choice Tom Waits was unavailable. Nixon&#x27;s agent pitched him to casting as a &quot;third-rate Tom Waits—for half-price&quot;.

===Filming===
Several weeks before shooting was to begin, Disney purchased the distribution rights to the film and demanded significant rewrites. Morton said the final result was a script that was not at all like the script that he, Jankel, and the cast had signed on to film, and that the tone of the new script was not at all compatible with the sets, which had already been built. Solomon recalled that he &quot;felt like [his draft of the screenplay] was at least coherent,&quot; but upon visiting the set, [Morton] had cut it up with a bunch of other stuff he liked from other drafts and a bunch of new stuff. […] There was no through line.&quot; Leguizamo said, &quot;It&#x27;s eight-year-olds who play the game and that&#x27;s where the movie needed to be aimed. [...] But [the directors] kept trying to insert new material. They shot scenes with strippers and with other sexually-explicit content, which all got edited out anyway.&quot; Richard Edson claimed that he and co-star Fisher Stevens were permitted to contribute their own dialogue at the writers’ approval: &quot;If we could improve the script, they were more than happy. So we did our own [dialogue] and they loved it […] that made it a lot more fun for us.&quot;

Principal photography of the film began on May 6, 1992, and wrapped on July 27, 1992. It was filmed at Carolco Studios in Wilmington, North Carolina. Contrary to many reports, directors Morton and Jankel did complete the contracted shooting of the film, though director of photography Dean Semler and several second unit directors provided additional reshoots. Morton and Jankel would even provide such instructions as the camera aperture settings, to which Semler responded by questioning his employment on the production. Morton said, &quot;I was locked out of the editing room [...] I had to get the DGA to come and help me get back into the editing room. I tried to get the editor to cut it digitally, but they refused. They wanted to edit on Moviola and Steenbeck machines, so the process was laboriously slow, which didn&#x27;t help us get the special effect cut in on time.&quot;

====Production design====
Production Designer David Snyder approached turning the Mushroom Kingdom into the live-action setting of Dinohattan (also known as DinoYawk or Koopaville) by &quot;[taking] all the elements that are in the video game&quot; and &quot;[turning] them into a metaphor and [combining] them with 3-D and real characters&quot;. Art Director Walter P. Martishius said, &quot;Koopa gets a single glimpse of Manhattan at the beginning of the movie&quot;. This inspires Koopa to recreate Dinohattan, but &quot;he didn&#x27;t get it quite right. The place is twisted, off balance, different. And he doesn&#x27;t even know it.&quot;

Co-producer Fred Caruso located the deserted Ideal Cement Co. plant in Wilmington, North Carolina. Snyder found the location a unique opportunity: &quot;In this building, with all the existing concrete structure, we could hang the scenery from the structure, and not have to build scaffolding, and could integrate the concrete structure into the film&#x27;s design.&quot; Snyder said: &quot;In &quot;Blade Runner&quot; (a film he was the Art Director on), the street was one level. Here I have a street level, a pedestrian walkway and above that Koopa&#x27;s Room, plus six or seven stories in height. I have more flexibility in layering of levels. It&#x27;s a major, major opportunity. You&#x27;d never be able to do this on a sound stage. There isn&#x27;t a sound stage big enough.&quot; &quot;We&#x27;ve designed this film with the idea of looking at New York while on some mind-altering drugs.&quot; The intelligent fungus was created from a fishing lure base and hot glue by prop designer Simon Murton.

====Creature effects====
Lead creatures designer and supervisor Patrick Tatopoulos was aware of the concurrent &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; production, so he consciously designed the dinosaurs for &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; to be more cute and cartoon-like with inspiration from &quot;Beetlejuice&quot;. Tatopoulos described Yoshi as &quot;an abstract, fantasy &quot;T. rex&quot;&quot;, and designed the baby dinosaur with large eyes to evoke a softer and less menacing quality. Lead SFX sculptor Mark Maitre compared Yoshi to a cross between &quot;a Tyrannosaurus rex and an iguana&quot;. Four versions of the Yoshi puppet were built: a stand-in, a wireless model, a half-puppet for the tongue, and a fully functional model. The fully functional puppet utilized 70 cables and nine operators, costing . Producers from &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; visited the set and were so impressed with the Yoshi puppet they briefly considered hiring its engineers for a second &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; creatures shop. Originally, the Goombas were only background characters, but their final designs were so impressive that directors Morton and Jankel promoted them to main characters with major stunts.

====Visual effects====
&quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; introduced several techniques considered innovative in the transition from practical to digital visual effects. It is the first film to have used the compositing software Flame before it was acquired by Autodesk, now an industry standard. The film was also the first to be scanned with the Kodak Cineon film scanner to create a digital intermediate, allowing for the compositing of more than 700 visual effects shots. The team consisted of both traditional rotoscope artists and digital artists, comprising approximately 30 people in total.

Visual effects supervisor Chris Woods directed all of the live-action plate shots required for effects work. Woods explained that &quot;it was much too expensive in those days to put a whole film through [the scanner],&quot; so only those shots were scanned by Kodak, which animator and compositor Sheena Duggal stated was the first time the company had ever done so. Technicolor provided visual effects dailies for the team, scanning the shots back onto film with the effects integrated. The disintegration effect for the inter-dimensional merge was inspired by the transporter from &quot;Star Trek&quot;. The film was shortlisted at the 66th Academy Awards for Best Visual Effects, but it was ultimately not nominated.

==Reception==
===Box office===
In the United States and Canada, &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; only collected during its opening weekend, ranking in fourth place at the box office below &quot;Cliffhanger&quot;, &quot;Made in America&quot; and &quot;Dave&quot;. It grossed , with approximately tickets sold in the United States. In Asia, the film earned () from distribution rentals in Japan, and sold 106,083 tickets in the South Korean capital of Seoul. In Europe, the film grossed () in the United Kingdom, sold 391,800 tickets in France, and sold 290,098 tickets in Germany. In total, the film grossed $17,997,000 internationally for a worldwide total of $38,912,465.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; has an approval rating of based on reviews, with an average rating of . The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;Despite flashy sets and special effects, &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; is too light on story and substance to be anything more than a novelty.&quot; Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 35 out of 100 based on 23 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade of &quot;B+&quot; on scale of A+ to F.

Michael Wilmington of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; said &quot;It&#x27;s a movie split in two: wildly accomplished on one level, wildly deficient on another.&quot; He gave the film high marks for its effects and the &quot;sheer density and bravura of the production design&quot;, but ultimately provided a low final score for poor writing. Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; also commended the film&#x27;s visual effects, and suggested Bob Hoskins could &quot;handle any role with grace and good humor&quot;, but concluded &quot;it doesn&#x27;t have the jaunty hop-and-zap spirit of the Nintendo video game from which it takes – ahem – its inspiration&quot;. Mark Caro of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; said &quot;The movie&#x27;s no stinker&quot;, lauded Hoskins and Leguizamo for their brotherly dynamic, and called the Goombas &quot;wonderfully daffy supporting characters&quot;. Hal Hinson of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; likewise praised the film for its performances and creature effects, and proclaimed &quot;In short, it&#x27;s a blast.&quot;

Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; and Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film two thumbs down on the television program &quot;Siskel &amp; Ebert at the Movies&quot;, citing tonal inconsistency and lack of narrative, and the film was on their list for one of the worst films of 1993. Stephen Hunter of &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; thought Yoshi had &quot;more personality than all the human actors put together&quot;.

Woods on a 4K resolution transfer and restoration. In 2024, Umbrella released the film on 4K Blu-ray to commemorate its 30th anniversary.

==Legacy==
In a 2007 interview, Hoskins was asked what he considered the worst choice in his acting career. He responded: &quot;&quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; It was a fuckin&#x27; nightmare. The whole experience was a nightmare. It had a husband-and-wife team directing, whose arrogance had been mistaken for talent. After so many weeks their own agent told them to get off the set! Fuckin&#x27; nightmare. Fuckin&#x27; idiots.&quot; He and Leguizamo got drunk before each day of filming and continued to drink between takes. In a 2011 interview, he was asked, &quot;What is the worst job you&#x27;ve done?&quot;, &quot;What has been your biggest disappointment?&quot;, and &quot;If you could edit your past, what would you change?&quot; His answer to all three was &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; His son, Jack Hoskins, is a fan of the &quot;Mario&quot; series as well as the film and praised his performance.

Though Leguizamo wrote in his autobiography that he hated the film and regretted acting in it, it was widely considered his breakout role in film acting. He prepared a video message for the film&#x27;s 20th anniversary in 2013, saying &quot;I&#x27;m glad people appreciate the movie [...] it was the first, nobody had ever done it before [...] I&#x27;m proud of the movie in retrospect.&quot;

Hopper disparaged the production, recounting in 2008: &quot;It was a nightmare, very honestly, that movie. It was a husband-and-wife directing team who were both control freaks and wouldn&#x27;t talk before they made decisions. Anyway, I was supposed to go down there for five weeks, and I was there for 17. It was so over budget.&quot; He added, &quot;My six-year-old son at the time – he&#x27;s now 18 – he said, &#x27;Dad I think you&#x27;re probably a pretty good actor, but why did you play that terrible guy King Koopa in &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot;?&#x27; And I said, &#x27;Well Henry, I did that so you could have shoes,&#x27; and he said, &#x27;Dad, I don&#x27;t need shoes that badly.

By her part, Mathis in 2018 referred to the film as &quot;not [my] proudest moment as an actor&quot;, but added: &quot;[I]t&#x27;s maybe [the one] that I get asked the most about [...] There are a lot of people who are really excited to meet me because I was [Princess] Daisy. That&#x27;s all you can ask for as an actor — that your work, and something you were part of, left an impression on people and makes them feel good.&quot;

Co-director Morton reflected on the film in 2014 as a &quot;harrowing&quot; experience. Morton felt &quot;very uneasy&quot; being put in the position of having to defend the new script. In addition, working with Dennis Hopper was &quot;really, really hard. Really hard. I don&#x27;t think [Hopper] had a clue what was going on&quot;. He described the experience as humiliating, but was proud of the film&#x27;s originality. For the film&#x27;s 20th anniversary, Morton said: &quot;I wanted parents to really get into it. At that time, there was a very hardcore movement against video games, and a lot of anti-video games sentiment. I wanted to make a film that would open it up and get parents interested in video games.&quot;

Co-director Jankel said, &quot;I do feel in my heart, it was a hell of an achievement to have made it, under those circumstances, and it has in time, happily, achieved cult status [...] I am often hearing how many people loved it growing up, watch it repeatedly, and are genuine fans.&quot;

Producer Joffé remains proud: &quot;It&#x27;s not that I defend the movie, it&#x27;s just that, in its own extraordinary way, it was an interesting and rich artefact and has earned its place. It has strange cult status.&quot; He never heard what Yamauchi or Nintendo thought of the finished product. He said, &quot;They never phoned up to complain [...] They were very polite,&quot; though Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils-Aimé said in 2017 that the film &quot;left a really bad taste in the mouth of our developers&quot; and that he had heard &quot;horror stories&quot; about its production from Nintendo employees.

In 2018, Phil Harnage, writer of &quot;The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!&quot;, revealed that the film&#x27;s box office failure was considered a relief to the crew of the animated series stating, &quot;[We] were all very happy because everybody hated it! It was such a waste of time and talent&quot;. He further added that they were never contacted about the film.

&quot;Mario&quot; creator Shigeru Miyamoto said: &quot;[In] the end, it was a very fun project that they put a lot of effort into [...] The one thing that I still have some regrets about is that the movie may have tried to get a little too close to what the &quot;Mario Bros.&quot; video games were. And in that sense, it became a movie that was about a video game, rather than being an entertaining movie in and of itself.&quot; Aaron Horvath, co-director of 2023’s &quot;The Super Mario Bros. Movie&quot;, felt the film differentiated from what he had hoped for in an adaptation of the games growing up, although he conceded to retrospectively enjoying it.

===Cultural impact===
Ryan Hoss, a longtime fan of the film, launched the fansite &quot;Super Mario Bros.: The Movie Archive&quot;, explaining to &quot;Playboy&quot; for the film&#x27;s 25th anniversary, &quot;I had this collection, and the Internet was growing in terms of fansites during that era, the late &#x27;90s, and I always knew the &quot;Mario Bros.&quot; movie was misunderstood and a sore spot in people&#x27;s minds—at least, the way it was being portrayed on the Internet, the &#x27;worst movie ever&#x27; kind of deal.&quot; He characterized the site: &quot;It&#x27;s a way to celebrate the film itself and showcase the work of all the people who had a part in it—warts and all, good and bad.&quot;

In 2010 Steven Applebaum joined the site as editor-in-chief to help collect production materials and organize interviews. He said, &quot;Most of the [cast and crew] were very happy about it because, at the time, it was a very revolutionary movie [...] They were introducing a lot of great special effects that hadn&#x27;t been done before, and they had these really talented actors, and it was a project they were proud to work on. [...] Giving them a chance to talk about everything they did, it really helped them to share what they contributed and what they felt was important to the industry.&quot; The film returned to theaters through fan efforts in 2012, and in 2013 for the 20th anniversary. The &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; 20th anniversary retrospective issue states that the fact that the film was maderegardless of qualityshows how much the game series had impacted popular culture.

===Themes===
Thomas Leitch has written that &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; is an example of post-literary adaptation and that it &quot;drops facetious references&quot; to &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, &quot;Star Wars&quot;, and &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot;. Stephen Hunter of &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; compared the Goombas to the winged monkeys of &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, suggesting they similarly evoke a &quot;mix of pity and terror&quot;. The phrase &quot;Trust the Fungus&quot; has been compared to &quot;May the Force be with you&quot; from &quot;Star Wars&quot;.

===Sequel webcomic===
In 2013, fansite editors Steven Applebaum and Ryan Hoss teamed with one of the film&#x27;s original screenwriters, Parker Bennett, on a fanfiction webcomic sequel. Development on the sequel began after a 2010 interview in which Bennett admitted the sequel hook was more an homage to the ending of the original &quot;Back to the Future&quot; and was not a serious indication of a potential continuation. However, Applebaum and Hoss later asked Bennett what he would have done if given the opportunity and Bennett provided broad points about the consequences of the first film and the themes that they would have explored.

The adventure picks up with Mario and Luigi returning to Dinohattan to aid Daisy in defeating mad scientist Wart, the final boss from &quot;Super Mario Bros. 2&quot;. &quot;We did heavily discuss the world of the film, from its backstory to the character&#x27;s motivations&quot;, says Applebaum. Bennett provided general direction before &quot;[passing] the torch&quot; to Applebaum and Hoss.

===Extended cut===
On June 1, 2021, editor and film restorationist Garrett Gilchrist and members of &quot;The Super Mario Bros. (Movie) Archive&quot; released a &quot;semi-official&quot; restoration of the extended cut of &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; The restorationists named it &quot;The Morton-Jankel Cut&quot; because it was based on an earlier VHS workprint of the film which had been discovered. Gilchrist was hired to get the most out of the low-quality VHS. The film is extended by twenty minutes in this cut, with additional scenes including Koopa devolving a technician into slime for the crime of sneezing, Mario&#x27;s rivalry with the mafia-affiliated Scapelli plumbing company, and an anti-Koopa rap by Spike and Iggy at the Boom Boom Bar, backed up with scantily clad lizard dancers. Though the &quot;Morton-Jankel Cut&quot; was theoretically intended as an official Blu-ray extra, there are no plans for this to happen, and it was leaked to Internet Archive instead. The Australian Blu-ray by Umbrella (released October 2021) used a raw edit of the VHS workprint rather than Gilchrist&#x27;s restoration.

The &quot;Trust the Fungus – Super Mario Bros. 30th Anniversary Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot; was released on Blu-ray by Umbrella Entertainment in 2023. This featured deleted scenes and the &quot;Lasagna Workprint&quot; from the same VHS source used previously for the &quot;Morton-Jankel Cut&quot;, but restored differently for this edition.

==Soundtrack==
The soundtrack, released on May 10, 1993, by Capitol Records, features two songs from Roxette: &quot;Almost Unreal&quot;, which was released as a single, and &quot;2 Cinnamon Street&quot;, which is an alternate version of the song &quot;Cinnamon Street&quot; from Roxette&#x27;s album &quot;Tourism&quot;. The music video for &quot;Almost Unreal&quot; was inspired by the film, featuring scenes from the film and a de-evolution theme. &quot;Almost Unreal&quot; was originally written for the film &quot;Hocus Pocus&quot;, but was switched out to an En Vogue song instead. Roxette subsequently gave the song to the &quot;Mario&quot; film. Roxette co-founder Per Gessle said &quot;the film turned out to be ridiculous (so thought Dennis Hopper by the way ... I met him at a Formula 1 race many years ago discussing this...) but the song isn&#x27;t that bad&quot;.

* These tracks were not included in the U.S. and Canada releases, only on the international versions of the album.

==2023 animated film reboot==

Rumors of a more source-accurate theatrical animated &quot;Mario&quot; film began in late 2014, with leaked emails between film producer Avi Arad and Sony Pictures head Tom Rothman suggesting that Sony would be producing the film. On November 14, 2017, Universal Pictures and Illumination announced a computer-animated &quot;Mario&quot; film. On January 31, 2018, Nintendo of America announced its partnership with Illumination, stating that the film would be co-produced by Shigeru Miyamoto and Chris Meledandri. On November 6, 2018, Meledandri stated that the film would be a &quot;priority&quot; for the studio, with a tentative 2022 release date, while reaffirming that Miyamoto would be involved &quot;front and center&quot; in the film&#x27;s creation. Speaking of the challenge of adapting the series into an animated film, Meledandri stated the film would be &quot;an ambitious task...taking things that are so thin in their original form and finding depth that doesn&#x27;t compromise what generations of fans love about Mario, but also feels organic to the iconography and can support a three-act structure&quot;.

&quot;The Super Mario Bros. Movie&quot; was released in the United States on April 5, 2023. It received mixed reviews from critics, and was a major commercial success, grossing $1.363 billion worldwide and setting multiple box-office records including the biggest worldwide opening weekend for an animated film and the highest-grossing film based on a video game. It became the second-highest-grossing film of 2023, the third-highest-grossing animated film of all time, and the highest-grossing film produced by Illumination.

<doc id="210868" wikidata="Q207784" url="?curid=210868" title="Square Enix">
<text>is a Japanese multinational holding company, video game publisher and entertainment conglomerate. It releases role-playing game franchises, such as &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;, &quot;Dragon Quest, and Kingdom Hearts&quot;, among numerous others. Outside of video game publishing and development, it is also in the business of merchandise, arcade facilities, and manga publication under its Gangan Comics brand. 

The original Square Enix Co., Ltd. was formed in April 2003 from a merger between Square and Enix, with the latter as the surviving company. Each share of Square&#x27;s common stock was exchanged for 0.85 shares of Enix&#x27;s common stock. At the time, 80% of Square Enix staff were made up of former Square employees. As part of the merger, former Square president Yoichi Wada was appointed the president of the new corporation, while former Enix president Keiji Honda was named vice president. Yasuhiro Fukushima, the largest shareholder of the combined corporation and founder of Enix, became chairman. In October 2008, Square Enix conducted a company split between its corporate business and video game operations, reorganizing itself as the holding company Square Enix Holdings Co., Ltd., while its internally domestic video game operations were formed under the subsidiary Square Enix Co., Ltd. The group operates American, Chinese and European branches, based in Los Angeles, Beijing, Paris, Hamburg and London respectively.

Several of Square Enix&#x27;s franchises have sold over 10 million copies worldwide after 2020, with &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; selling 173 million, &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; selling 85 million, and &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; shipping 36 million. In 2005, Square Enix acquired arcade corporation Taito. In 2009, Square Enix acquired Eidos plc, the parent company of British game publisher Eidos Interactive, which was then absorbed into its European branch. Square Enix is headquartered at the Shinjuku Eastside Square Building in Shinjuku, Tokyo, along with a second office at Osaka. It has over 5,000 employees worldwide through its base operations and subsidiaries.

==Corporate history==
===Origins and pre-merger (1975–2003)===
====Enix (1975–2003)====
Enix was founded on September 22, 1975, as Eidansha Boshu Service Center by Japanese architect-turned-entrepreneur Yasuhiro Fukushima. Enix focused on publishing games, often by companies who exclusively partnered with the company. In the 1980s, in a partnership with developers Chunsoft, the company began publishing the &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; series of console games.

Key members of the developer&#x27;s staff consisted of director Koichi Nakamura, writer Yuji Horii, artist Akira Toriyama, and composer Koichi Sugiyama, among others. The first game, &quot;Dragon Warrior&quot;, in the Famicom-based RPG series, was released in 1986 and would eventually sell 1.5 million copies in Japan, establishing &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; as the company&#x27;s most profitable franchise. Despite the announcement that Enix&#x27;s long-time competitor Square would develop exclusively for PlayStation, Enix announced in January 1997 that it would release games for both Nintendo and Sony consoles. This caused a significant rise in stock for both Enix and Sony. By November 1999, Enix was listed in the Tokyo Stock Exchange&#x27;s first section, indicating it as a &quot;large company&quot;.

====Square (1983–2003)====

Square was started in October 1983 by Masafumi Miyamoto as a computer game software division of Den-Yu-Sha, a power line construction company owned by his father. While at the time, game development was usually conducted —by only one programmer, Miyamoto believed that it would be more efficient to have graphic designers, programmers and professional story writers working together.

In September 1986, the division was spun off into an independent company led by Miyamoto, officially named Square Co., Ltd. After releasing several unsuccessful games for the Famicom, Square relocated to Ueno, Tokyo in 1987 and developed a role-playing video game titled &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;, which was inspired by Enix&#x27;s success in the genre with the 1986 &quot;Dragon Quest&quot;. &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; was a success with over 400,000 copies sold, and it became Square&#x27;s leading franchise, spawning dozens of games in a series that continues to the present.

Buoyed by the success of their &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; franchise, Square developed notable games and franchises such as &quot;Chrono,&quot; &quot;Mana&quot;, &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; (in collaboration with The Walt Disney Company), and &quot;Super Mario RPG&quot; (under the guidance of Super Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto). By late 1994 they had developed a reputation as a producer of high-quality role-playing video games. Square was one of the many companies that had planned to develop and publish their games for the Nintendo 64, but with the cheaper costs associated with developing games on CD-based consoles such as the Sega Saturn and the Sony PlayStation, Square decided to develop titles for the latter system. &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; was one of these games, and it sold 9.8 million copies, making it the second-best-selling game for the PlayStation.

===Merger (2003)===
A merger between Square and Enix was considered since at least 2000; the financial failure in 2001 of Square&#x27;s first movie, &quot;Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within&quot;, made Enix reluctant to proceed while Square was losing money. With the company facing its second year of financial losses, Square approached Sony for a capital injection, and on October 8, 2001, Sony purchased an 18.6% stake in Square. Following the success of both &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot; and &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot;, the company&#x27;s finances stabilized, and it recorded the highest operating margin in its history in the fiscal year 2002. It was announced on November 25, 2002, that Square and Enix&#x27;s previous plans to merge were to officially proceed, intending to decrease development costs and to compete with foreign developers. As described by Square&#x27;s president and CEO Yoichi Wada: &quot;Square has also fully recovered, meaning this merger is occurring at a time when both companies are at their height.&quot;

Some shareholders expressed concerns about the merger, notably Miyamoto (the founder and largest shareholder of Square), who would find himself holding a significantly smaller percentage of the combined companies. Other criticism came from Takashi Oya of Deutsche Securities, who expressed doubts about the benefits of such a merger: &quot;Enix outsources game development and has few in-house creators, while Square does everything by itself. The combination of the two provides no negative factors but would bring little in the way of operational synergies.&quot; Miyamoto&#x27;s concerns were eventually resolved by altering the exchange ratio of the merger so that each Square share would be exchanged for 0.85 Enix shares rather than 0.81 shares, and the merger was greenlit. The merger was set for April 1, 2003, on which date the newly merged entity Square Enix came into being. At the time of the merger, 80% of Square Enix staff were made up of former Square employees. As part of the merger, former Square president Yoichi Wada was appointed the president of the new corporation, while former Enix president Keiji Honda became its vice president. The founder of Enix and the largest shareholder of the newly combined corporation, Yasuhiro Fukushima, was made its honorary chairman.

As a result of the merger, Enix was the surviving company and Square Co., Ltd. was dissolved. In July of that year, the Square Enix headquarters were moved to Yoyogi, Shibuya, Tokyo, to help combine the two companies.

===Post-merger and acquisitions (2003–2013)===
To strengthen its wireless market, Square Enix acquired mobile application developer UIEvolution in March 2004, which was sold in December 2007, and the company instead founded its own Square Enix MobileStudio in January 2008 to focus on mobile products. In January 2005, Square Enix founded Square Enix China, expanding their interests in the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

In September 2005, Square Enix bought the gaming developer and publisher Taito, renowned for their arcade hits such as &quot;Space Invaders&quot; and the &quot;Bubble Bobble&quot; series; Taito&#x27;s home and portable console games divisions were merged into Square Enix itself by March 2010. In August 2008, Square Enix made plans for a similar expansion by way of a friendly takeover of video game developer Tecmo by purchasing shares at a 30 percent premium, but Tecmo rejected the proposed takeover. Tecmo would later merge with Koei in April 2009 to form Koei Tecmo. In April 2007, Square Enix Ltd. CEO John Yamamoto also became CEO of Square Enix, Inc. In 2008–2009, Square Enix was reportedly working with Grin on a &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; spin-off codenamed &quot;Fortress&quot;. The project was allegedly canceled by Square Enix after introducing seemingly impossible milestones and without payments made, resulting in Grin declaring bankruptcy and its co-founders blaming Square Enix for being &quot;betrayed&quot;.

In February 2009, Square Enix announced a takeover deal for Eidos (formerly SCi Entertainment), the holding company for Eidos Interactive. The UK-based publisher&#x27;s assets include &quot;Tomb Raider&quot;, &quot;Hitman&quot;, &quot;Deus Ex&quot;, &quot;Thief&quot;, and &quot;Legacy of Kain&quot; franchises, along with subsidiary development studios Crystal Dynamics, Eidos-Montréal and IO Interactive that developed the games. The acquisition of Eidos was completed in April 2009, and in November it was merged with Square Enix&#x27;s European publishing organization, business unit Square Enix Europe. Eidos&#x27; US operations were merged with Square Enix Incorporated. In April 2010, a new Japanese label for Western games bearing CERO restrictions called &quot;Square Enix Extreme Edges&quot; was announced. In July 2010, Mike Fischer was appointed CEO of Square Enix, Inc. Square Enix founded the mobile development studio Hippos Lab in March 2011 and Square Enix Montréal in 2012. In June 2011, Stainless Games had purchased the rights to &quot;Carmageddon&quot; from Square Enix. In July 2011, it was reported that Square Enix closed their Los Angeles Studio. In January 2012, Square Enix North American office could pursue smaller niche, mobile and social media games due to its existing revenue streams. In October 2012, Square Enix was perceived as a &quot;force in mobile&quot; games by &quot;Kotaku&quot;. The price of Final Fantasy Dimensions and Demons&#x27; Score, $30 and $44 respectively, was criticized.

===Restructuring (2013)===
On March 26, 2013, citing sluggish sales of major Western games, Square Enix announced major restructuring, expected loss of ¥10 billion and resignation of President Yoichi Wada, whom Yosuke Matsuda replaced. Phil Rogers was elected as a new Director, among others. With the restructuring, Square Enix of America CEO Mike Fischer left the company in May, with former Square Enix Europe CEO Phil Rogers becoming CEO of Americas and Europe. Further executive changes at Square Enix Western studios were mentioned in a statement. Square Enix Europe was hit with layoffs and Life President Ian Livingstone departed from the company in September 2013.

It said with the fiscal year report in March 2013, sales of &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; (2013) and &quot;Hitman: Absolution&quot; were weak, despite critical acclaim. The North American sales force was said to be ineffective and price pressure was intense. Matsuda noted the long development time of their important games and said they need to shift to a business model with frequent customer interactions, noting Kickstarter as an example.

===Post-restructuring and RPG development (2013–2021)===
In March 2013, Square Enix India opened in Mumbai; however the office was closed in April 2014 and reopened five years later. As well as Square Enix Latin America in Mexico, which was closed in 2015. A mobile studio called Smileworks was founded in Indonesia in June 2013; however it was closed in January 2015. In 2014, Square Enix Collective launched, an indie developer service provider headed by Phil Elliot. Also in 2014, Square Enix signed a strategic alliance and cooperation with Japanese and French video game companies, Bandai Namco Entertainment and Ubisoft; it has served as the Japanese publisher of video games and crossover productions since 2009. 

In March 2014, following the success of &quot;Bravely Default&quot;, Square Enix said it will &quot;go back to their roots&quot; and focus on creating content that will appeal to their core audience. Karl Stewart, vice president of strategic marketing at Square Enix for North America and Europe, left the company that month. In 2015, Square created a new studio known as Tokyo RPG Factory to develop what was then dubbed &quot;Project Setsuna.&quot; Around 2015, Square Enix&#x27;s Western divisions began &quot;officially working across LA and London&quot;.

In January 2017, Norwegian studio Artplant purchased former Eidos franchise Project I.G.I. On February 21, 2017, the formation of a new studio Studio Istolia was announced. The studio, headed by Hideo Baba, would be working on the new RPG &quot;Project Prelude Rune&quot;. In November 2017, IO Interactive conducted a management buyout from Square Enix and the Hitman IP was transferred to the studio. In September 2018, COO Mike Sherlock died, with Square Enix&#x27;s executive team assuming his immediate responsibilities. In 2018, Square Enix branded their third party publishing division Square Enix External Studios, which is headed by Jon Brooke and Lee Singleton. John Heinecke was appointed as CMO for Americas and Europe in October 2018. 

Baba departed the studio in early 2019, and shortly after this, Studio Istolia was closed, and &quot;Project Prelude Rune&quot; cancelled following an assessment of the project, with its staff being reassigned to different projects within the company. In 2019, Square Enix opened an Indian office again, now in Bangalore, which expanded into publishing mobile games for the Indian market in 2021. In June 2020, Square Enix donated $2.4 million to charities around their Western studios and offices for the Black Lives Matter cause and COVID-19, which were partially raised from sales of its discounted Square Enix Eidos Anthology bundle. In March 2021, Forever Entertainment, a Polish studio, was reported to be working to bring several of Square Enix&#x27;s properties to modern systems. A new mobile studio called Square Enix London Mobile, working on &quot;Tomb Raider Reloaded&quot; and an unannounced title based on with Navigator Games, was announced on 20 October 2021.

===Divestment of Western studios and business changes (2022–present)===

In March 2022, Square Enix announced that they would donated $500,000 to the United Nations fund for Ukrainian refugees in the 2022 Russian-Ukrainian conflict.

On May 1, 2022, Square Enix announced that it would sell several assets of subsidiary Square Enix Limited to Swedish games holding company Embracer Group for $300 million. This included studios Crystal Dynamics, Eidos-Montréal, and Square Enix Montreal, IPs &quot;Deus Ex&quot;, &quot;Legacy of Kain&quot;, &quot;Thief&quot;, and &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; and rights to &quot;over 50 games&quot;. Square Enix stated that the sale will further help it in investment into blockchain and other technologies, and to &quot;assist the company in adapting to the changes underway in the global business environment by establishing a more efficient allocation of resources&quot;. Square Enix also stated that it would retain the &quot;Life Is Strange&quot;, &quot;Outriders&quot;, and &quot;Just Cause&quot; franchises. However, during the Japanese publisher&#x27;s full-year financial results briefing on May 13, president Yosuke Matsuda clarified the past statement and said the money from the sale will be used to strengthen the company&#x27;s core games business. On July 25, 2022, Square Enix launched the English version of &quot;Manga Up!.&quot; The acquisition was closed by August 26, 2022, with the assets being held under CDE Entertainment which is headed from London by Phil Rogers, former CEO of Square Enix Americas and Europe. 

In the company&#x27;s financial statement for the following quarter, released in September 2022, Matsuda said they were moving away from outright owning studios due to rising costs of development, but were looking at means to invest in studios such as joint ventures or investment opportunities. In 2022, Square Enix invested in seven business strategic cooperations in the blockchain and cloud services such as Zebedee (United States), Blocklords (Estonia), Cross The Ages (France), Blacknut (France), Animoca Brands-owned The Sandbox (Australia and Hong Kong), and Ubitus (Japan).

On February 28, 2023, Square Enix Holdings announced that on May 1, Luminous Productions would reorganize and merge with Square Enix internally, citing the merging of the two would &quot;enhanced the group&#x27;s abilities to develop HD games&quot; for the 20th anniversary. On March 3, Square Enix issued a statement announcing a proposed change to the position of its president and representative director that, if implemented, would result in Yosuke Matsuda stepping down and being succeeded by Takashi Kiryu, who is presently the company&#x27;s director. The change will become effective upon approval at the company&#x27;s 43rd annual shareholders&#x27; meeting, which is planned for June 2023, and the board meeting which will follow ahead on the 20th anniversary of the merger. Kiryu succeeded on May 18 and was seen as part of the &quot;Final Fantasy XVI&quot; launch event as one of his first appearances in public.

In March 2024, Square Enix announced it would be more selective with the games it develops, resulting in numerous unannounced titles being cancelled. The company lost ¥22.1 billion (approximately $140 million) due to &quot;content abandonment&quot;, they are now making the third installment of the Final Fantasy VII Remake their full focus after the release of Rebirth.

==Corporate structure==
On October 1, 2008, Square Enix transformed into a holding company and was renamed Square Enix Holdings. At the same time, the development and publishing businesses were transferred to a spin-off company named Square Enix, sharing the same corporate leadership and offices with the holding company. The primary offices for Square Enix and Square Enix Holdings are in the Shinjuku Eastside Square Building in Shinjuku, Tokyo.

Currently, focusing in different industries, the company is divided as the following: Five Creative Business Units for game development and production in Square Enix Co., Ltd; a dedicated publishing business unit for manga and books publishing; a digital storefront business division for their e-Store and merchandise production; their media and arts business unit for music production, concert and live performance coordination, and visual contents production (live action, animation, and CG for TV, movies, and games); and a blockchain business division.

===Development organization===
After the merger in 2003, Square Enix&#x27;s development department was organized into eight Square and two Enix , each focused on different groupings of games. The divisions were spread around different offices; for example, Product Development Division 5 had offices both in Osaka and Tokyo.

According to Yoichi Wada, the development department was reorganized away from the Product Development Division System by March 2007 into a project-based system. Until 2013, the teams in charge of the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; and &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; series were still collectively referred to as the . The 1st Production Department was formed from the fall 2010 combination of Square Enix&#x27;s Tokyo and Osaka development studios, with Shinji Hashimoto as its corporate executive.

In December 2013, Square Enix&#x27;s development was restructured into 12 Business Divisions. In 2017, Business Division 9 was merged into Business Division 8, while Business Divisions 11 and 12 merged to become the new Business Division 9, while a new Business Division 11 was created with some staff from Business Division 6.

In 2019, Square Enix announced that their eleven Business Divisions would be consolidated into four units by 2020 with a new title, Creative Business Unit. Naoki Yoshida, who was previously the head of Business Division 5, became the head of Creative Business Unit III. Creative Business Unit III was renamed Creative Studio III in May 2024. The current structure for the development and production division called Creative Business Unit is as follows:
* Creative Business Unit I is led by Yoshinori Kitase, who was the head of Business Division 1 and focuses on &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; single-player titles and some of its spin-offs, &quot;SaGa&quot; and &quot;Kingdom Hearts series&quot;. The department comprises the former Business Division 1 (Mainline single-player &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; such as &quot;Final Fantasy XIII&quot; and &quot;Final Fantasy VII Remake&quot;), Business Division 3 (&quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot;, &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; spin-offs, &quot;The World Ends with You&quot;, &quot;SaGa&quot; series), and Business Division 4 (&quot;Final Fantasy&quot; spin-offs produced with external companies, e.g., &quot;Dissidia Final Fantasy NT&quot;, &quot;Theatrhythm Final Fantasy&quot;, &quot;Final Fantasy Record Keeper&quot;). Currently, the titles developed internally by the group are &quot;&quot; and &quot;Kingdom Hearts IV&quot;, outside of titles overseen and produced by the division and developed by contracted studios.
* Creative Business Unit II is led by Yuu Miyake, who was the head of Business Division 6 and focuses on the &quot;Dragon Quest&quot;, &quot;Nier&quot;, &quot;Octopath Traveler&quot; and &quot;Bravely&quot; series, as well as arcade games. The department comprises the former Business Division 6 (&quot;Dragon Quest&quot; series, &quot;Nier&quot; series), Business Division 7 (&quot;Lord of Vermilion&quot;, &quot;Gunslinger Stratos&quot;) and Business Division 11 aka &quot;Team Asano&quot; (&quot;Bravely&quot; series, &quot;Octopath Traveler&quot; series); since 2023, it also comprises employees from the defunct Luminous Productions (&quot;Forspoken&quot;), a Square Enix subsidiary made of employees from the former Business Division 2 (&quot;Final Fantasy XV&quot;). Currently, the known title developed internally by the group is &quot;Dragon Quest XII&quot;, outside of titles overseen and produced by the division and developed by contracted studios.
* Creative Studio III is led by Naoki Yoshida, who was the head of Business Division 5 and focused primarily on MMORPGs. It expanded into single-player titles in 2023 with &quot;Final Fantasy XVI&quot;. It mainly comprises the former Business Division 5 (&quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot;, &quot;Final Fantasy XIV&quot;, &quot;Dragon Quest Builders&quot; series).
* Creative Business Unit IV is led by Kei Hirono and focuses primarily in the &quot;Mana&quot; series along with co-development and production of remasters, ports and mobile titles such as &quot;Final Fantasy Brave Exvius&quot;. It comprises the former Business Division 8 (&quot;Mana&quot; series, along with remasters and ports of different franchises). 
* Creative Business Unit V is led by Kei Hirono and focuses on Million Arthur, Schoolgirl Strikers and Grimms Notes series, alongside mobile titles. It comprises the former Business Division 9 (&quot;Schoolgirl Strikers&quot;, &quot;Grimms Notes&quot;), and Business Division 10 (&quot;Million Arthur&quot; series, &quot;Chaos Rings&quot; series).

In those five divisions, most of the development is done outside of Square Enix under contracted development companies, while Creative Business Unit produces and oversee the title done by those developers. All of the internal development done by Creative Business Units are for titles such as mainline Dragon Quest, Final Fantasy and Kingdom Hearts, while their mid-size and smaller titles have the development outsourced to other companies for most of the cases such as &quot;Team Asano&quot; led by Tomoya Asano, a team of producers from Creative Business II who had Artdink and Netchubiyori developing &quot;Triangle Strategy&quot; or Historia developing the remake of &quot;Live A Live&quot;, while the team was mainly present to oversee, produce, concept, while the studios do the bulk of the project under their direction.

===Business model===

The business model of post-merger Square Enix is centered on the idea of &quot;polymorphic content&quot;, which consists of developing franchises on multiple potential media rather than being restricted by a single gaming platform. An early example of this strategy is Enix&#x27;s &quot;Fullmetal Alchemist&quot; manga series, which has been adapted into two anime television series, five movies (two animated, three live-action), and several novels and video games. Other polymorphic projects include the &quot;Compilation of Final Fantasy VII&quot;, &quot;Code Age&quot;, &quot;World of Mana&quot;, &quot;Ivalice Alliance&quot;, and &quot;Fabula Nova Crystallis Final Fantasy&quot; subseries. According to Yoichi Wada, &quot;It&#x27;s very difficult to hit the jackpot, as it were. Once we&#x27;ve hit it, we have to get all the juice possible out of it&quot;. Similar to Sony&#x27;s Greatest Hits program, Square Enix also re-releases their best-selling games at a reduced price under a label designated &quot;Ultimate Hits&quot;.

The standard game design model Square Enix employs is to establish the plot, characters, and art of the game first. Battle systems, field maps, and cutscenes are created next. According to Taku Murata, this process became the company&#x27;s model for development after the success of Square&#x27;s &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; in 1997. The team size for &quot;Final Fantasy XIII&quot; peaked at 180 artists, 30 programmers, and 36 game designers, but analysis and restructuring were done to outsource large-scale development in the future.

==Business==

===Video games and franchises===
Square Enix&#x27;s primary concentration is on video gaming, and it is primarily known for its role-playing video game franchises. Of its properties, the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; franchise, begun in 1987, is the best-selling, with a total worldwide sales of over 173 million units as of March 2022. The &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; franchise, begun in 1986, is also the best-selling; it is considered one of the most popular game series in Japan and new installments regularly outsell other games at the times of their release, with a total worldwide sale of over 85 million units. More recently, the &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; series (developed in collaboration with Disney beginning in 2002) has become popular, with 36 million units shipped as of March 2022. Other popular series developed by Square Enix include the &quot;SaGa&quot; series with nearly 10 million copies sold since 1989, the &quot;Mana&quot; series with over 6 million sales since 1991, and the &quot;Chrono&quot; series with over 5 million sold since 1995. In addition to their sales numbers, many Square Enix games have been highly reviewed; 27 Square Enix games were included in &quot;Famitsu&quot; magazine&#x27;s 2006 &quot;Top 100 Games Ever&quot;, with 7 in the top 10 and &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot; claiming the number 1 position. The company also won IGN&#x27;s award for Best Developer of 2006 for the PlayStation 2.

Square and Enix initially targeted Nintendo home consoles with their games, but Square Enix currently develops games for a wide variety of systems. In the seventh generation of video game consoles, Square Enix released new installments from its major series across all three major systems, including &quot;Final Fantasy XIII&quot; on both the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 and &quot;Dragon Quest X&quot; on the Wii. Square Enix has also developed titles for handheld game consoles, including the Game Boy Advance, Nintendo DS, PlayStation Portable, Nintendo 3DS, and PlayStation Vita. Also, they have published games for Microsoft Windows-based personal computers and various models of mobile phones and modern smartphones. Square Enix mobile phone games became available in 2004 on the Vodafone network in some European countries, including Germany, the United Kingdom, Spain, and Italy.

Before its launch, Michihiro Sasaki, senior vice president of Square Enix, spoke about the PlayStation 3, saying, &quot;We don&#x27;t want the PlayStation 3 to be the overwhelming loser, so we want to support them, but we don&#x27;t want them to be the overwhelming winner either, so we can&#x27;t support them too much.&quot; Square Enix continued to reiterate their devotion to multi-platform publishing in 2007, promising more support for the North American and European gaming markets where console pluralism is generally more prevalent than in Japan. Their interest in multi-platform development was made evident in 2008 when the previously PlayStation 3-exclusive game &quot;Final Fantasy XIII&quot; was announced for release on the Xbox 360.

In 2008, Square Enix released their first game for the iPod, &quot;Song Summoner: The Unsung Heroes&quot;. Square Enix made a new brand for younger children gaming that same year, known as Pure Dreams. Pure Dreams&#x27; first two games, &quot;Snoopy DS: Let&#x27;s Go Meet Snoopy and His Friends!&quot; and &quot;Pingu&#x27;s Wonderful Carnival&quot;, were released that year. After acquiring Eidos in 2009, Square Enix combined it with its European publishing wing to create Square Enix Europe, which continues to publish Eidos franchises such as &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; (88 million sales), &quot;Deus Ex&quot; (4 million), &quot;Thief&quot; and &quot;Legacy of Kain&quot; (3.5 million). Square Enix has also served as the Japanese publisher for Activision Blizzard and Ubisoft games since 2009. In May 2022, Square Enix sold several assets of Square Enix Europe to Embracer Group, including former Eidos Interactive franchises such as &quot;Tomb Raider,&quot; &quot;Deus Ex,&quot; &quot;Thief,&quot; &quot;Legacy of Kain&quot; and more than 50 others.

Square Enix owned franchises and games include:
* former Square franchises, such as &quot;Mana&quot;;
* former Enix franchises, such as &quot;Star Ocean&quot;;
* Square Enix created franchises, such as &quot;Drakengard&quot;;
* Taito franchises, such as &quot;Space Invaders&quot;;
* Quest franchises, such as &quot;Ogre&quot;;
* Retained former Eidos Interactive franchise &quot;Just Cause&quot;;
* Square Enix America created games, such as &quot;Quantum Conundrum&quot;, &quot;Motley Blocks&quot;;
* Square Enix Europe created franchises, such as &quot;Life Is Strange&quot;.

===Game engines===
In 2004, Square Enix began to work on a &quot;common 3D format&quot; that would allow the entire company to develop titles without being restricted to a specific platform: this led to the creation of a game engine named Crystal Tools, which is compatible with the PlayStation 3, the Xbox 360, Windows-based PCs, and to some extent the Wii. It was first shown off at a tech demo shown off at E3 2005 and was later used for &quot;Final Fantasy XIII&quot; based on the demo&#x27;s reception. Crystal Tools was also used for &quot;Final Fantasy Versus XIII&quot; before its re-branding as &quot;Final Fantasy XV&quot; and its shift onto next-gen platforms. Refinement of the engine continued through the development of &quot;Final Fantasy XIII-2&quot;, and it underwent a major overhaul for &quot;Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII&quot;. Since that release, no new titles have been announced using Crystal Tools, and it is believed that the development of the engine has halted permanently.

Luminous Engine was originally intended for eighth-generation consoles and unveiled at E3 2012 through a tech demo titled &quot;Agni&#x27;s Philosophy&quot;. The first major console title to be developed with Luminous Engine was &quot;Final Fantasy XV&quot;; the engine&#x27;s development was done in tandem with the game, and the game&#x27;s development helped the programming team optimize the engine.

In addition to Luminous Engine and custom engines made for individual games and platforms before and since Square Enix often uses other companies&#x27; engines and programming languages for their video game properties. Epic Games&#x27; Unreal Engine 3 was used for games such as &quot;The Last Remnant&quot;, and more recently, Unreal Engine 4 has been used for projects including &quot;Dragon Quest XI&quot;, &quot;Kingdom Hearts III&quot;, and the most recent &quot;Final Fantasy VII Remake&quot;. Unity has also been used internally for titles including &quot;I Am Setsuna&quot;, &quot;Lost Sphear&quot;, and &quot;&quot;. The Squirrel language had also been used for the WiiWare title &quot;Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: My Life as a King&quot;.

===Online gaming===
Before the merger, Enix published its first online game &quot;Cross Gate&quot; in Japan, mainland China, and Taiwan in 2001, and Square released &quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot; in Japan in 2002 for the PlayStation 2 and later the personal computer. With the huge success of &quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot;, the game was ported to the Xbox 360 two years later and was the first MMORPG on the console. All versions of the game used PlayOnline, a cross-platform internet gaming platform and internet service developed by Square Enix. The platform was used as the online service for many games Square Enix developed and published throughout the decade. Due to the success of their MMORPG, Square Enix began a new project called &quot;Fantasy Earth: The Ring of Dominion&quot;. GamePot, a Japanese game portal, received the license to publish &quot;Fantasy Earth&quot; in Japan, and it was released in Japan as &quot;Fantasy Earth ZERO&quot;. In 2006, however, Square Enix dropped the &quot;Fantasy Earth Zero&quot; project and sold it to GamePot. Square Enix released &quot;Concerto Gate&quot;, the sequel to &quot;Cross Gate&quot;, in 2007.

A next-gen MMORPG code named &quot;Rapture&quot; was developed by the &quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot; team using the company&#x27;s Crystal Tools engine. It was unveiled at E3 2009 as &quot;Final Fantasy XIV&quot; for PlayStation 3 and Microsoft Windows and would be released on September 30, 2010. &quot;Dragon Quest X&quot; was announced in September 2011 as an MMORPG being developed for Nintendo&#x27;s Wii and Wii U consoles, which released on August 2, 2012, and March 30, 2013, respectively. Like &quot;XIV&quot;, it used Crystal Tools.

Square Enix also made browser games and Facebook games, like &quot;Legend World&quot;, &quot;Chocobo&#x27;s Crystal Tower&quot; and &quot;Knights of the Crystals&quot;, and online games for Yahoo! Japan, such as &quot;Monster x Dragon&quot;, &quot;Sengoku Ixa&quot;, &quot;Bravely Default: Praying Brage&quot;, &quot;Star Galaxy&quot;, and &quot;Crystal Conquest&quot;.

=== Cloud gaming ===
In 2013, &quot;Dragon Quest X&quot; was brought to iOS and Android in Japan using NTT DoCoMo as the release platform and Ubitus for the streaming technology. In 2014, it was also brought to 3DS in Japan using Ubitus.

On May 8, 2012, Square Enix announced a collaboration with Bigpoint Games to create a free-to-play Cloud gaming platform that &quot;throws players into &#x27;limitless game worlds&#x27; directly through their web browser&quot;. The service was launched under the name &quot;CoreOnline&quot; in August 2012. Stating &quot;limited commercial take-up&quot;, the service was cancelled on November 29, 2013.

In September 2014, a cloud gaming company called Shinra Technologies (previously Project Flare) was created; however, it was closed in January 2016. On October 9, 2014, Square Enix launched another online game service in Japan called &quot;Dive In&quot;, which allowed players to stream console games to their iOS or Android devices. The service was monetized by the amount of time the players spent playing, with each game offered for free for thirty minutes. The service was cancelled on September 13, 2015. Some Square Enix games are available in Japan on the G-cluster streaming service.

=== Arcade facilities ===
With the merger of Taito businesses into Square Enix, the company gained possession of Taito&#x27;s arcade infrastructure and facilities and entered the arcade market in 2005. In 2010 Taito revealed NESiCAxLive, a cloud-based system of storing games and changing them through the internet instead of acquiring physical copies. This system was added to its many arcade gaming locations. The company continues to cater to the arcade audience in Japan with arcade-only titles, with game producers in 2015 stating that Square Enix has a loyal fan base that values the arcade gaming experience. In November 2019, Square Enix announced a &quot;Ninja Tower Tokyo&quot; theme park by its newly established &quot;Live Interactive Works&quot; division.

===Film===
The company has made three forays into the film industry. The first, &quot;Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within&quot; (2001), was produced by Square subsidiary Square Pictures before the Enix merger; Square Pictures is now a consolidated subsidiary of Square Enix. Its box-office failure caused Enix to delay the merger, which was already under consideration before the creation of the film until Square became profitable once again. In 2005, Square Enix released &quot;Final Fantasy VII Advent Children&quot;, a CGI-animation film based on the PlayStation game &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;, set two years after the events of the game. A &quot;Deus Ex&quot; film was in pre-production in 2012 and, as of 2014, was undergoing rewrites. In 2016 Square Enix revealed a film called &quot;&quot; based in the world of &quot;Final Fantasy XV&quot; and a new web series released on YouTube and Crunchyroll entitled &quot;&quot;.

===Publishing===

The company has a manga publishing division in Japan (originally from Enix) called Gangan Comics, which publishes content for the Japanese market only. In 2010, however, Square Enix launched a digital manga store for North American audiences via its Members services, which contains several notable series published in Gangan anthologies. Titles published by Gangan Comics include &quot;Fullmetal Alchemist&quot;, &quot;Soul Eater&quot;, and many others. Other titles include manga adaptations of various Square Enix games, like &quot;Dragon Quest&quot;, &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; and &quot;Star Ocean&quot;. Some of these titles have also been adapted into anime series. &quot;Fullmetal Alchemist&quot; is the most successful title of Square Enix&#x27;s manga branch, with more than 64 million volumes sold worldwide. It is licensed in North America by Viz Media, while its two anime adaptations were licensed by Funimation (now known as Crunchyroll) in North America. Starting in Q4 2019, Square Enix began publishing some of its manga series in English.

===Merchandise===
Square Enix has created merchandise for virtually all of their video game franchises, many items are available only in Japan. Starting in 2000, Square Enix&#x27;s former online gaming portal PlayOnline sold merchandise from game franchises including &quot;Parasite Eve&quot;, &quot;Vagrant Story&quot;, &quot;Chocobo Racing&quot;, &quot;Front Mission&quot;, &quot;Chrono Cross&quot;, and &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;. Mascots from game franchises are a popular focus for merchandise, such as the Chocobo from &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;, which has been seen as a rubber duck, a plush baby Chocobo, and on coffee mugs. Square Enix also designed a Chocobo character costume for the release of &quot;Chocobo Tales&quot;. The Slime character from &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; has also been frequently used in Square Enix merchandise, especially in Japan. On the Japanese Square Enix shopping website, there is also a Slime-focused section called &quot;Smile Slime&quot;. Slime merchandise includes plush toys, game controllers, figurines, and several board games, including one titled &quot;Dragon Quest Slime Racing&quot;. In Japan, pork-filled steam buns shaped like slimes have been sold in 2010. For &quot;Dragon Quest&#x27;s&quot; 25th anniversary, special items were sold, including business cards, tote bags, and crystal figurines. Rabites from the &quot;Mana&quot; series have appeared in several pieces of Square Enix merchandise, including plush dolls, cushions, lighters, mousepads, straps, telephone cards, and T-shirts. Square Enix has also made merchandise for third party series, including figures &quot;Mass Effect&quot; and &quot;Halo&quot; in 2012. Beginning in 2012, it operates shops called &quot;Square Enix Cafe&quot; in Tokyo, Osaka and Shanghai, which display and sell merchandise, as well as serve café food.

<text>Richard Lester Liebman (born January 19, 1932) is a retired American film director based in the United Kingdom, famous for his comedic style of shooting movies and for his work in both US and UK cinema.

He is best known for directing the Beatles&#x27; films &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; (1964) and &quot;Help!&quot; (1965), and the superhero films &quot;Superman II&quot; (1980) and &quot;Superman III&quot; (1983). His other notable films as director include &quot;The Running Jumping &amp; Standing Still Film&quot; (1959), &quot;The Knack ...and How to Get It&quot; (1965), &quot;A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum&quot; (1966), &quot;Petulia&quot; (1968), &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; (1973) and its two sequels, as well as &quot;Robin and Marian&quot; (1976), and &quot;Butch and Sundance: The Early Days&quot; (1979). He is an Honorary Associate of London Film School.

According to the British Film Institute, &quot;if any single director can encapsulate the popular image of Britain in the Swinging Sixties, then it is probably Richard Lester. With his use of flamboyant cinematic devices and liking for zany humour, he captured the vitality, and sometimes the triviality, of the period more vividly than any other director.&quot;

==Early years and career==
Richard Lester Liebman was born to a Jewish family in Philadelphia. A child prodigy, he graduated from the William Penn Charter School, a Quaker school in Philadelphia, and began studies at the University of Pennsylvania at the age of 15, graduating with a degree in clinical psychology in 1951.

===American television===
Lester started in television in 1950, working as a stage hand, floor manager, assistant director, and eventually a director in less than a year, because no one else was around who knew how to do the work.

Lester was the music director on &quot;Action in the Afternoon&quot;, an American western television series that aired live on CBS from February 2, 1953, to January 29, 1954. The series originated from the studios and back lot of CBS&#x27; WCAU-TV, which was then in Philadelphia; it was broadcast Monday through Friday regardless of the weather. The half-hour series aired variously at 3:30 pm or 4:00 pm, throughout its run.

===British television===
In May 1955, after a period spent busking around continental Europe, Lester moved to London and began work as a director in television, working for the low-budget producers the Danziger Brothers on episodes of &quot;Mark Saber&quot;, a half-hour detective series.

He worked as a writer on &quot;Curtains for Harry&quot; (1955) and for a few weeks, &quot;The Barris Beat&quot; (1956).

A variety show he produced caught the eye of Peter Sellers, who enlisted Lester&#x27;s help in translating &quot;The Goon Show&quot; to television as &quot;The Idiot Weekly, Price 2d&quot; (1956). It was a hit as were two follow-up shows: &quot;A Show Called Fred&quot; (1956) and &quot;Son of Fred&quot; (1956).

Lester recalled that &quot;A Show Called Fred&quot; was &quot;broadcast live and that&#x27;s why I went into film directing where you can do a second take!&quot;

He wrote and directed episodes of the TV series &quot;After Hours&quot; (1958).

===Early films===
Lester received acclaim with &quot;The Running Jumping &amp; Standing Still Film&quot; (1959), a short film he made with Spike Milligan and Peter Sellers. He did another short titled &quot;The Sound of Jazz&quot; (1959).

His first feature as director was &quot;It&#x27;s Trad, Dad!&quot; (1962), a low-budget musical. His second was &quot;The Mouse on the Moon&quot; (1963), produced by Walter Shenson for United Artists starring Margaret Rutherford, a sequel to &quot;The Mouse That Roared&quot; (1959). He returned to TV, directing episodes of &quot;Room at the Bottom&quot; (1964).

==The Beatles==
&quot;The Running Jumping &amp; Standing Still Film&quot; was a favourite of the Beatles, particularly John Lennon. When the band members were contracted to make a feature film, they chose Lester from a list of possible directors. &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; (1964) showed an exaggerated and simplified version of the Beatles&#x27; characters and proved to be an effective marketing tool. Many of its stylistic innovations survive as the forerunner of music videos; in particular, the multi-angle filming of a live performance. Lester was sent an award from MTV as &quot;Father of the Music Video&quot;.

&quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; was a huge critical and commercial success. Lester then directed the first of several quintessential &quot;swinging&quot; films, the sex comedy &quot;The Knack... and How to Get It&quot; (1965). It was the first of three of his films with actor Michael Crawford, and the first out of four credited collaborations with screenwriter Charles Wood. The film won the Palme d&#x27;Or at the Cannes Film Festival.

Lester followed &quot;The Knack... and How to Get It&quot; with the Beatles film &quot;Help!&quot; (1965). A spoof of the popular James Bond spy thrillers, it was the second collaboration with screenwriter Charles Wood and another huge commercial success. Lester received a Hollywood offer to direct the film adaptation of &quot;A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum&quot; (1966).

He then made the darkly surreal anti-war movie &quot;How I Won the War&quot; (1967) co-starring Crawford and Lennon, which Lester referred to as an &quot;anti-anti-war movie&quot;. He explained that anti-war movies still took the concept of war seriously, contrasting &quot;bad&quot; war crimes with wars fought for &quot;good&quot; causes like the liberation from Nazism or, at that time, Communism, whereas with screenwriter Charles Wood, Lester set out to show war as fundamentally opposed to humanity. Although set in World War II, the film serves as an oblique reference to the Vietnam War, and at one point, breaking the fourth wall, references this directly. 
He made &quot;Petulia&quot; (1968) with Julie Christie and George C. Scott, and a score by John Barry (who had also scored &quot;The Knack&quot;). He returned to his anti-war theme with the post-apocalyptic black comedy &quot;The Bed Sitting Room&quot; (1969), based on a play by Spike Milligan and John Antrobus. The screenplay was the fourth credited collaboration between Lester and Charles Wood, but Wood provided uncredited production rewrites for more films of Lester.

&quot;How I Won the War&quot; and &quot;Bed Sitting Room&quot; performed poorly at the box office; Lester found himself unable to raise funds for a series of projects, including an adaptation of the &quot;Flashman&quot; novels.

==Swashbucklers and Adventurers==
Lester&#x27;s career revived when he was hired by Alexander and Ilya Salkind to do a version of &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; (1973), based on a script by George MacDonald Fraser. The producers decided to split the first film into two after principal photography was completed, the second titled &quot;The Four Musketeers&quot; (1974). Many of the cast principals complained to the Salkinds, stating that they were only contracted to make one film, and they arrived at an agreement to avoid attorneys&#x27; fees. Both movies were critically and commercially successful.

He was called in at the last minute as a replacement director on &quot;Juggernaut&quot; (1974), a thriller set on a cruise liner. The success of the &quot;Musketeers&quot; films enabled Lester to raise the finances for &quot;Royal Flash&quot; (1975), based on the second of the &quot;Flashman&quot; novels by George MacDonald Fraser. Lester followed &quot;Royal Flash&quot; with &quot;Robin and Marian&quot; (1976) which was adapted from a script by James Goldman and starred Sean Connery and Audrey Hepburn. He then made &quot;The Ritz&quot; (1976) which was based on a play by Terrence McNally.

Lester also directed &quot;Butch and Sundance: The Early Days&quot; (1979) and &quot;Cuba&quot; (1979) with Connery; neither film was successful commercially.

===&quot;Superman&quot;===
Lester&#x27;s next film, &quot;Superman II&quot;, was a huge success. Production on &quot;Superman II&quot; began before &quot;Superman&quot; was completed, and had to be halted to concentrate on getting the first movie completed. After the first film was released in late 1978, the Salkinds went back into production on &quot;Superman II&quot; without informing &quot;Superman&quot; director Richard Donner and placed Lester behind the camera to complete the remaining 25 percent of the film. Although Donner had shot 75 percent, a majority of what was planned for the film, much of his footage was jettisoned or reshot during Lester&#x27;s time on the project.

Gene Hackman, who played Lex Luthor, refused to return for the reshoots, so Lester instead used a body double to insert the character into new scenes, as well as a voice impersonator to record additional dialogues and occasionally loop Luthor&#x27;s lines onto footage of Hackman shot by Donner. Some of Donner&#x27;s original footage was integrated into television versions of the film. In November 2006, Donner&#x27;s footage was re-edited into &quot;Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut&quot;, consisting primarily of his footage with Lester&#x27;s footage used only for scenes not shot during Donner&#x27;s principal photography of the movie.

Richard Lester directed &quot;Superman III&quot; (1983), but this third installment was not as well received as its predecessors. Nonetheless, it was considered a box office success, ranking 14th in that year&#x27;s worldwide box office.

== Later films and retirement ==
In 1984, Lester directed the comedy &quot;Finders Keepers&quot;, starring Michael O&#x27;Keefe, Louis Gossett Jr., and Beverly D&#x27;Angelo. It had a domestic total gross of $1,467,396. The film generally received good reviews. Richard Freedman in his review published in &quot;The Montana Standard&quot; found the film to be &quot;wonderfully wacky&quot; and concluded that &quot;a movie consisting almost entirely of pratfalls and sight gags can wear you down after a while, but everybody involved in &quot;Finders Keepers&quot; ensures, that this is one comedy that makes nobody in the audience a loser or a weeper.&quot;

In 1988, he reunited most of the &quot;Three Musketeers&quot; cast to film &quot;The Return of the Musketeers&quot;, released the following year. During filming in Spain, actor Roy Kinnear, a close friend of Lester, died after falling from a horse. Lester finished the film, then retired from directing. He returned only once more to direct Paul McCartney&#x27;s concert film &quot;Get Back&quot; (1991).

In 1993, he presented &quot;Hollywood U.K.&quot;, a five-part series on British cinema in the 1960s for the BBC.

Director Steven Soderbergh is among many who have called for a reappraisal of Lester&#x27;s work and influence. He wrote &quot;Getting Away with It&quot;, published in 1999 about Lester&#x27;s career; the book consists of interviews with Lester.

In 2012, the British Film Institute awarded Lester a Fellowship, the British film industry&#x27;s highest honour, in recognition of his work. The award was presented in a public ceremony on March 22 at the National Film Theatre, and was followed by a screening of Lester&#x27;s &quot;Robin and Marian&quot;. The citation for his fellowship recognises that &quot;Richard Lester has created a unique body of work which has enriched the lives of millions with his brilliantly surreal humour and innovative style. Although born in the US, he has lived in Britain for 60 years and created some of the most enduring and influential creations of British cinema.&quot;

==Personal life==
In Soderbergh&#x27;s book &quot;Getting Away with It&quot;, Lester reveals that he is a committed atheist and debates with Soderbergh (who was then an agnostic), largely based on the arguments of Richard Dawkins. While Lester studied at the University of Pennsylvania, he was a member of the Beta Rho Chapter of the Sigma Nu fraternity.

<doc id="210873" wikidata="Q225912" url="?curid=210873" title="Kingdom Hearts (video game)">
<text>is a 2002 action role-playing video game developed by Square for the PlayStation 2 video game console. It is the first game in the &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; series and is the result of a collaboration between Square and The Walt Disney Company. An expanded re-release of the game featuring new and additional content, Kingdom Hearts Final Mix, was released exclusively in Japan in December 2002. The &quot;Final Mix&quot; version of the game was later remastered in high definition and released globally as part of the &quot;Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 Remix&quot; collection for the PlayStation 3. The game was later ported and released as part of the bundled &quot;Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 + 2.5 Remix&quot; collection for PlayStation 4 in March 2017, Xbox One in February 2020, Windows in March 2021 and Nintendo Switch in February 2022.

The game combines characters and settings from Disney animated features with those from Square&#x27;s &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series, in addition to original characters and worlds created for the game. It follows the adventures of Sora, a cheerful teenager who fights against the forces of darkness alongside his allies, including Donald Duck, Goofy and other Disney characters. The game was a departure from Square&#x27;s standard role-playing games, introducing a substantial action and hack and slash element to the gameplay. The score was composed by Yoko Shimomura. &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; has an all-star voice cast and includes many of the Disney characters&#x27; official voice actors. It was longtime Square character designer Tetsuya Nomura&#x27;s first time in a directorial position.

&quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; was a critical and commercial success and received praise for its unusual combination of action and role-playing elements, its unexpectedly harmonious mix of Square and Disney elements and Shimomura&#x27;s music. It is considered to be one of the greatest video games of all time, and was a large presence in the 2002 holiday season, receiving numerous year-end game awards, and went on to achieve Sony &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; status. The game&#x27;s success spawned a franchise and numerous sequels, with the &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; series going on to ship over 36 million copies worldwide and becoming one of Square&#x27;s most popular franchises. &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; is the tenth best-selling PlayStation 2 game of all time.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; is influenced by its parent franchise, &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;, and carries gameplay elements over into its own action-based, hack and slash system. The main battle party consists of three characters: Sora, Donald Duck, and Goofy. Sora is directly controlled by the player from a third-person camera angle. All other party members are computer-controlled, though the player can customize their behavior to an extent through the pause menu. Donald and Goofy comprise the party in most areas, but many levels feature a character who may replace them. For instance, Jack Skellington can join Sora&#x27;s party in Halloween Town, but can&#x27;t accompany the player elsewhere. In some worlds, the party changes its appearance, has abilities unique to that world, or both; the characters can fly in Neverland, gain aquatic forms in Atlantica which enable them to survive underwater, and wear Halloween costumes in Halloween Town to blend in with the locals.

Like traditional role-playing games, &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; features an experience point system that determines character development. As enemies are defeated, the player characters gain experience and grow stronger, gaining access to new abilities. Unlike other games of its genre, &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; allows a degree of character development customization through a short tutorial found at the beginning of the game. The tutorial allows the player to select from one of three main attributes―strength, defense, or magic―for Sora to excel in and one to lack in. By choosing certain options, the player may manipulate how Sora learns abilities, grows statistically, and gains levels. Donald, Goofy, and additional party members are assigned specific areas of strength from the outset. Donald excels in magic, while Goofy excels in defense and special attacks.

The game progresses linearly from one story event to the next, usually presented in cutscenes, though there are numerous side quests available that provide benefits to the characters. Players may also choose the order in which they tackle some areas. Most of the gameplay occurs on interconnected field maps where battles take place. Combat in &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; occurs in real time and involves pressing buttons to initiate attacks by the on-screen character. An action menu, similar to those found in &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; games, found at the bottom left of the screen provides other combat options such as using magic and items, although players can also assign selected magic spells that can be instantly used whilst holding the shoulder button. As players progress through the game, they can receive certain Disney characters as summons, such as Dumbo and Tinker Bell, each with their own unique abilities. There is also a context-sensitive option at the bottom of the menu, usually used for interacting with the environment or performing special attacks. This menu is manipulated by using the right analog stick or digital pad, while movement is controlled by the left analog stick, allowing the player to navigate the menu while avoiding or approaching enemies.

Sora, along with his allies, possesses a Hit Point (HP) meter and a Magic Point (MP) meter, which increase as they gain experience and level up. The MP meter is divided into various segments that are used up whenever that character performs magic, with more powerful magic consuming more MP. MP can be replenished by performing melee attacks or using items. The HP meter determines the character&#x27;s health and reducing whenever they take damage, although it can be replenished by using healing items or spells. If one of Sora&#x27;s allies runs out of health, they will be knocked out temporarily until healed. However, if Sora loses all of his health, the game ends and the player must resume play from the beginning of an area or boss. Defeating enemies causes various orbs to fall: green orbs which replenish health, blue orbs which restore MP, and yellow orbs which represent Munny, the game&#x27;s currency, and can be used to purchase new items.

===Gummi Ship===
The Gummi Ship is the mode of travel between the various worlds in the game. The gameplay for piloting the vessel is different from the rest of the game, as it switches to a rail shooter format in which the player controls the Gummi Ship from a rear third-person perspective as it travels in an outer space setting. While traveling, the player must avoid obstacles and defend against enemy ships that attempt to destroy the vessel by firing missiles or ramming it. Surviving the route allows access to the next world. Once the player&#x27;s Gummi Ship is destroyed, it will have the option to either return to the world selection menu or retry the level. At the beginning of the game, there are few options available to customize the vessel, but as the game progresses, new weapons, engines, and armor become available. Different pre-designed blueprints can be found throughout the game that can be used to quickly construct Gummi Ships. Geppetto also gives the player different Gummi Ship designs based on the number of Heartless defeated. From the start, the player can travel between worlds by using &quot;Normal Drive&quot;, which initiates the rail shooter-like minigame. Later in the game, Sora can acquire a &quot;Warp Drive&quot;, which allows instant travel between previously visited worlds without having to play the minigame. However, worlds that have not been visited cannot be accessed with Warp Drive and must be discovered normally first.

==Plot==
===Setting===
The universe of &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; is a collection of various levels, referred to as &quot;worlds&quot;, through which the player must progress. Fourteen worlds are featured, out of which thirteen can be accessed; one, Disney Castle, is shown in cutscenes. Additional worlds are mentioned by various characters, but are inaccessible due to being destroyed by the Heartless. Ten Disney worlds are based on fiction, primarily from the Disney animated features canon, and the other four were created by Square specifically for the game.

The graphics and characters of each world were designed to resemble the artwork and style of the Disney film they are based on. Each Disney world is inhabited by characters from the film: including Hercules and Philoctetes in Olympus Coliseum, and Aladdin, Jasmine, and Jafar in Agrabah. Each world is disconnected from the others and exists separately, and with few exceptions, most characters in the world are unaware of other ones. Players travel from one world to another via the Gummi Ship.

The worlds created specifically for the game mirror the overall appearance of the other worlds and feature either new characters or ones from several &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; games. The new worlds include: the Destiny Islands, where the story opens; Traverse Town, which serves as a launching point for most of the game; Hollow Bastion, which many of the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; characters call home; and the End of the World, a large, dark world created from the remnants of various worlds consumed by the Heartless. The main characters travel from world to world to seal each &quot;Keyhole&quot;, which protects the world from the Heartless and from destruction. They also try to minimize their interaction with characters of other worlds to maintain a balance of separation. This sometimes requires Sora, Donald and Goofy to blend in with the world inhabitants by changing their physical appearance.

===Characters===

The collaboration between Disney and Square resulted in a mixture of familiar Disney and Square characters, as well as several new characters created and designed by Tetsuya Nomura. The primary protagonist of the game is Sora, a 14-year-old boy chosen to wield the Keyblade—a weapon which is a cross between a key and a sword—to battle darkness. The game also features two friends from his home world, Riku and Kairi. For most of the game, Sora is joined by Donald Duck and Goofy, who are a court wizard and captain of the royal guard respectively, and were sent from Disney Castle to find the Keyblade. The three join forces to search for King Mickey Mouse, Kairi, and Riku. The primary antagonist is Ansem, who seeks power and knowledge by using dark beings called the Heartless, which are hearts corrupted by darkness that act as enemies and come in various forms. Maleficent, from the 1959 film &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot;, leads a group of Disney villains that seeks to use the Heartless for their own gain.

As a game meant to explore the fictional universes of various Disney films, over one hundred Disney characters are featured in various capacities. While many serve as major characters in the story, others appear in cameo roles, such as the One Hundred and One Dalmatians playing a part in a side-quest. Most worlds also feature a Disney villain whom the player must defeat. The player can summon various Disney characters to fight alongside Sora in battle, causing Donald and Goofy to withdraw from the battlefield for the duration of the summon. Available summoned characters include the Genie from &quot;Aladdin&quot;, Tinker Bell from &quot;Peter Pan&quot; and Simba from &quot;The Lion King&quot;, among others.

Square also incorporated several characters from the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series into the game, though they were slightly altered to fit the game&#x27;s back-story. On the Destiny Islands, the player meets younger versions of Tidus and Wakka from &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot; (2001) as well as Selphie from &quot;Final Fantasy VIII&quot; (1999). In Traverse Town, the player encounters Squall Leonhart (also known as &quot;Leon&quot;) from &quot;Final Fantasy VIII&quot;, as well as Aerith, Cid and Yuffie from &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; (1997). Rikku from &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot; was originally set to appear, but was replaced by Yuffie. Cloud and Sephiroth, both from &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;, make appearances in Olympus Coliseum, where the player can fight them in tournaments. The emphasis on characters from later &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; installments stems from Nomura&#x27;s hesitation to use characters he did not design. The game also uses other &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; icons, such as the Moogles, who mediate item synthesis.

===Story===
Sora, Riku, and Kairi build a raft with the intent to leave their home world of Destiny Islands to explore new worlds. On the night before the planned voyage, the Heartless attack the islands and Riku and Kairi disappear. Before the Heartless consume the islands, Sora mysteriously obtains the Keyblade, a weapon effective against the Heartless. Meanwhile, King Mickey has left his own world to deal with the increasing number of Heartless, leaving instructions for Donald and Goofy to find the &quot;key&quot; that will protect the worlds from encroaching darkness. Donald and Goofy use the Gummi Ship to travel to Traverse Town, where they find Sora after he wound up there following the destruction of his world. The three decide to travel together – Donald and Goofy to find Mickey, and Sora to find Kairi and Riku – traveling to various worlds and sealing their &quot;Keyholes&quot; to prevent their &quot;heart&quot; from being consumed by the Heartless. Meanwhile, a group of Disney villains led by Maleficent seek out the seven Princesses of Heart to unlock the final keyhole that leads to Kingdom Hearts, a repository of knowledge and power and the source of all hearts. Maleficent also finds Riku and recruits him into her services, manipulating him into believing that Sora abandoned him.

Sora and his friends eventually arrive at Hollow Bastion, Maleficent&#x27;s headquarters, where Riku takes the Keyblade from Sora and reveals himself to be its intended wielder, with Sora only receiving it in his absence; Donald and Goofy reluctantly leave Sora as per their orders. Sora later challenges Riku, stating that his heart derives strength from his friends, inspiring Donald and Goofy to return to him and allowing him to regain control of the Keyblade. After the three defeat Maleficent, Sora finds Kairi&#x27;s comatose body and confronts Riku, who has been possessed by Ansem, a figure who manipulated Maleficent to open the way to Kingdom Hearts. Ansem reveals Kairi as the seventh Princess of Heart, her heart having transferred into Sora&#x27;s body when the Destiny Islands were destroyed. After defeating the possessed Riku, Sora impales himself with Ansem&#x27;s Keyblade, which is designed to unlock hearts, and releases both his and Kairi&#x27;s hearts. Kairi&#x27;s heart returns to her body, in turn completing the final Keyhole, while Sora becomes a Heartless. However, Kairi recognizes Sora&#x27;s Heartless, and the light in her heart restores him to human form.

Sora and his group venture to the End of the World, the remnants of the worlds destroyed by the Heartless, to confront Ansem as he reaches the door to Kingdom Hearts. Believing a wellspring of darkness lies within the door, Ansem calls upon it to aid him after a battle with Sora. However, the door opens to reveal light, which destroys Ansem. Also beyond the door are Mickey and Riku, who help Sora and his friends close the door before Sora and Mickey lock it with their Keyblades from both sides. The worlds lost to the Heartless reconstruct themselves; as the Destiny Islands reform, Kairi returns there while Sora is forced to part with her. Sora, Donald, and Goofy resolve to find Riku and Mickey.

==Development==
The initial idea for &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; began with a discussion between Shinji Hashimoto and Hironobu Sakaguchi about &quot;Super Mario 64&quot;. They were planning to make a game with freedom of movement in three dimensions like &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; but lamented that only characters as popular as Disney&#x27;s could rival a Mario game. Tetsuya Nomura, overhearing their conversation, volunteered to lead the project and the two producers agreed to let him direct. A chance meeting between Hashimoto and a Disney executive in an elevator—Square and Disney having previously worked in the same building in Japan—allowed Hashimoto to pitch the idea directly to Disney. Nomura struck down a number of proposals from Disney in order to pursue his own concept featuring an original character not based on a Disney property. The production team consisted of over one hundred members from both Square and Disney Interactive. The game began development in February 2000 and originally focused more on the gameplay with a simple story to appeal to Disney&#x27;s target age range. After executive producer Hironobu Sakaguchi told director Tetsuya Nomura the game would be a failure if it did not aim for the same level as the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series, Nomura began to develop the story further. When choosing the Disney worlds to include in the game, Nomura and his team tried to pick worlds that had distinctively different looks. They also tried to take into account worlds with Disney characters that would be interesting. Thanks to support from Disney&#x27;s then-president and current chairman and chief executive Bob Iger, the team had few restrictions on which worlds they could use from the Disney franchises. However, they tried to remain within each character&#x27;s boundaries set by their respective Disney films. In a June 2013 interview, Nomura stated the name of the game was inspired by Disney Theme Parks, particularly Animal Kingdom, which had recently opened when development on the game began. However, Nomura could not secure the IP as just &quot;Kingdom&quot;. Later on, when the development team began to think about &quot;hearts&quot; as a core part of the story, it was decided to combine the two to form the title &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot;. Outside contractors Telecom Animation Film Company, and Kazuhide Tomonaga helped animate the game by being the animation supervisors.

Additional content was added to the North American release that was absent in the initial Japanese release: new optional bosses, one of which, Kurt Zisa, was named after the winner of the official website&#x27;s &quot;Name-In-Game&quot; sweepstakes, an extra difficulty level, and a teaser of &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot; accessible by meeting certain criteria. Nomura included the teaser in order to gauge fan reaction to the possibility of a sequel; he felt that if the idea was unpopular, then it would be best to leave certain events in the game unexplained. The new content was later added to the Japanese re-release &quot;Kingdom Hearts Final Mix&quot;. &quot;Final Mix&quot; included further additional content such as new items, cutscenes, and enemies, such as a new secret boss that sets up the sequel. The new content further hinted at plotlines that would be explained in sequels. Some content omitted from &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; was later added into &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot;. A world based on &quot;The Lion King&quot;, for instance, was unfeasible because an additional program was required to process movement on four legs—a necessity since Sora would become a lion in that world. Due to time constraints, the developers left out an optional boss battle, similar to the Sephiroth battle, against Tifa Lockhart. She was later included in &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot; as a more developed character.

===Audio===
====Music====

Yoko Shimomura composed and produced the music of &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot;. While there are arranged melodies derived from previous Disney films, most of the soundtrack consists of original themes written specifically for the game by Shimomura. The opening orchestration and ending credits theme were arranged and orchestrated by Kaoru Wada and performed by the New Japan Philharmonic Orchestra. The main vocal theme for the original Japanese release is titled . The English version of &quot;Hikari,&quot; &quot;Simple and Clean,&quot; was used in the Western releases and the Japanese re-release, &quot;Final Mix&quot;. Both versions were composed and performed by Hikaru Utada. Her involvement, along with the Japanese song title, was announced in January 2002. Utada was the only singer Nomura had in mind for the &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; theme song. This marked the first time Utada had produced a song for a video game. The single, &quot;Hikari,&quot; was released in Japan on March 20, 2002 and proved to be very popular; by August 2002, it had sold over 860,000 copies in Japan. The &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; soundtrack was released on a two CD set on March 27, 2002, in Japan and a year later in the United States. The soundtrack was later included in the &quot;Kingdom Hearts Original Soundtrack Complete&quot;, which was released in Japan on March 28, 2007. Music from &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; was also included in Shimomura&#x27;s best works compilation album &quot;Drammatica&quot;.

====Voice cast====
&quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; featured well-known voice actors for both the Japanese and English versions. The Japanese version featured Miyu Irino as Sora, Risa Uchida as Kairi, and Mamoru Miyano as Riku. Other voice actors included Kōichi Yamadera, Hideo Ishikawa, and Maaya Sakamoto. A special effort was made to preserve the official voice actors of characters from the Disney movies used in &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot;, including Tony Anselmo, Bill Farmer, &amp; Wayne Allwine as Donald Duck, Goofy, and Mickey Mouse, respectively. Other actors who reprised their roles included Tony Goldwyn as Tarzan, James Woods as Hades, Jodi Benson as Ariel, Kathryn Beaumont as Alice and Wendy Darling, Scott Weinger as Aladdin, Linda Larkin as Princess Jasmine, Gilbert Gottfried as Iago, Pat Carroll as Ursula, John Fiedler as Piglet, Chris Sarandon as Jack Skellington, and Kenneth Mars as King Triton. Some of the voice actors from the related television series or direct-to-video sequels were chosen over the original voice actors from films, where applicable (e.g. Dan Castellaneta as Genie, rather than Robin Williams). The English version featured Haley Joel Osment as Sora, David Gallagher as Riku, and Hayden Panettiere as Kairi. Other voice actors included Billy Zane as Ansem, Christy Carlson Romano as Yuffie, David Boreanaz as Leon, Sean Astin as Hercules, Lance Bass as Sephiroth, and Mandy Moore as Aerith.

===Promotion===
&quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; was announced at the Electronic Entertainment Expo in May 2001. Initial details were that it would be a collaboration between Square and Disney Interactive and would feature worlds developed by both companies and Disney characters. New characters were designed by Nomura and included Sora, Riku, Kairi, and the Heartless. A playable demo was available at the Tokyo Game Show in 2001. The gameplay of the demo showcased many action role-playing game elements that would be included in the final product. To help market the English release of the game, Square launched the official website in April 2002, which featured trailers, a &quot;Name-In-Game&quot; sweepstakes, and other Internet content. On May 14, 2002, a press release announced a list of the English voice actors. The list included Haley Joel Osment, David Gallagher, and Hayden Panettiere as the three new characters introduced in the game. It also announced that many of the Disney characters would be voiced by the official voice actors from their respective Disney films. Other marketing efforts included auctions of the game and related items before the North American release and a Consumer Demo Day in San Francisco, California.

==Re-releases==

Multiple versions of &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; have been released. The first was the original Japanese release, followed by the North American and PAL releases, which includes additional content. The game was later re-released in Japan as &quot;Kingdom Hearts Final Mix&quot;, which features the content of the North American/PAL release, as well as more new content.

===&quot;Final Mix&quot;===
Originally released only in Japan on December 26, 2002, &quot;Kingdom Hearts Final Mix&quot; has several events and a number of gameplay tweaks that are not in previous releases. Spoken dialogue is in English, with Japanese subtitles. New scenes, clarifying certain plot points, such as Riku&#x27;s journey and foreshadowing of &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot;, were included, but no new dialogue was recorded. A gameplay option allows the player to skip cutscenes after seeing them once. The optional bosses first included in the English version were introduced to Japanese players for the first time, along with a new fight against &quot;Unknown Man,&quot; in an attempt to raise interest for the sequel.

In another attempt at foreshadowing, a video titled &quot;Another Side, Another Story 【 deep dive 】&quot; plays at the ending if the player accomplishes certain tasks. New music tracks incorporated were &quot;Disappeared&quot; and &quot;Another Side.&quot; The &quot;Night on Bald Mountain&quot; and &quot;One-Winged Angel&quot; tracks from the English version were included as well. Other changes include new abilities, new weapons, new items, additional and recolored enemies, and gameplay tweaks to make the game easier for the player, along with two new levels of difficulty. When first released, &quot;Final Mix&quot; included either a deck of &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; cards or special music CD. A limited &quot;Platinum Edition&quot; version of &quot;Kingdom Hearts Final Mix&quot; was later released with an action figure of Sora, a sticker set, and sketches of some of the main characters.

It was released for the first time in North America, Europe, and Australia as part of &quot;Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 Remix&quot;.

===&quot;HD 1.5 Remix&quot;===

During August 2011, Nomura expressed desire to release a high definition rerelease of the game though he had yet to confirm such plans. In September 2012, Square Enix announced &quot;Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 Remix&quot;, a compilation for the PlayStation 3, that includes both &quot;Kingdom Hearts Final Mix&quot; and &quot;Kingdom Hearts Re:Chain of Memories&quot; in HD and trophy support. The character models from &quot;Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance&quot; were used as a base for the game&#x27;s characters. The gameplay of the original &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; was modified to play more like &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot;. Additionally, the collection includes HD cinematic scenes from &quot;Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days&quot;. It was released in Japan on March 14, 2013, in North America on September 10, 2013, on September 12, 2013, for Australia, and September 13, 2013, for Europe.

In June 2013, Nomura stated that the original game assets for &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; had been lost some time ago. He explained, &quot;[The game data] was lost, so we had to research, and we had to dig out from the actual game what was available and recreate everything for HD. We had to recreate all the graphics and it was actually not that easy.&quot;

In October 2016, Square Enix announced a single-disc compilation release of &quot;Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 Remix&quot; and &quot;Kingdom Hearts HD 2.5 Remix&quot; for the PlayStation 4. It was released on March 9, 2017, in Japan, and was released on March 28, 2017, in North America, and March 31, 2017, in Europe and Australia. A piece of free downloadable content for the PS4 version released in June 2017 added a Theater mode for &quot;Kingdom Hearts Final Mix&quot;; this was included by default in later ports of the compilation.

On November 14, 2019, Square Enix announced that both &quot;Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 Remix&quot; and &quot;Kingdom Hearts HD 2.5 Remix&quot; were coming to Xbox One, marking the Xbox debut of the first two &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; games and spinoffs. The two games are combined into a collection titled &quot;Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 + 2.5 Remix&quot;, and released on February 18, 2020.

==Related media==
Both Square and Disney also released numerous types of merchandise before and after the release of the game. Merchandise ranged from toys and figurines to clothing items and books. Like the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; games, Square released an &quot;Ultimania&quot; book on &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; in Japan following the release of the game and a revised edition following the release of &quot;Final Mix&quot;. In North America, a strategy guide was released by Brady Games. It featured a comprehensive walkthrough and a sticker activity journal. A manga series based on the game was released in Japan and the United States. A novel series also based on the game was released in Japan. It was authored by Tomoco Kanemaki and illustrated by Shiro Amano. The novel series consists of two volumes and was released in North America on March 25, 2008.

The game was adapted into a manga by Shiro Amano. The story follows the events that took place in the game with a few minor differences to account for the loss of interactivity a video game provides. Some events that took place in the &quot;Final Mix&quot; version were also included. The manga was originally serialized in Japan by Enterbrain&#x27;s &quot;Famitsū PS2&quot;, but has since been released worldwide in four volumes. The volumes have been published in English in the United States by Tokyopop. The first volume was released on October 11, 2005, and the fourth volume was released on July 10, 2006. The entire series was later released in a boxed set on October 10, 2006. The manga series has had moderate success. The first volume was ranked 95th in &quot;USA Today&quot;″s &quot;Top 150 best sellers&quot; during the week of its release. IGN praised Amano&#x27;s artwork and commented on wanting to replay the game after reading. They criticized the lack of new content and stated the transition from game to print lost most of the story&#x27;s appeal. The series was followed by others based on the game&#x27;s sequels: &quot;Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories&quot; and &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot;.

==Reception==
&quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; sold very well. During the first two months of its North American release it was one of the top three highest-selling video games and was among the top selling titles during the 2002 Christmas and holiday season. In November 2002, UBS Warburg listed it as the 6th highest console game in terms of sales during the week of November 5. At the end of April 2003, Square announced that &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; had sold its millionth copy in the United States, which made it eligible for PlayStation&#x27;s &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; status, and over 3.0 million worldwide. Sales reached 1.2 million in Japan in the first quarter of 2004, and broke 4.0 million worldwide. In December 2005, the NPD Group listed it as &quot;one of the top ten best-selling PlayStation 2 titles of all time in North America.&quot; By July 2006, &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; had sold through 2.6 million copies and earned $100 million in the United States alone. &quot;Next Generation&quot; ranked it as the seventh highest-selling game launched for the PlayStation 2, Xbox or GameCube between January 2000 and July 2006 in that country. As of December 2006, &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; had shipped over 5.6 million copies worldwide with 1.1 million in PAL regions, 1.5 million in Japan, and 3.0 million in North America. As of 2006, the original game and the &quot;Final Mix&quot; version had sold 6 million copies on PS2. As of March 2022, the &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; series has shipped more than 36 million copies worldwide.

===Critical response===

The game received generally positive reviews. In IGN&#x27;s Best of 2002 awards, it was nominated for &quot;PS2&#x27;s Best Game of 2002 Editor&#x27;s Choice Award&quot; and was a runner up for &quot;PS2&#x27;s Best Game of 2002 Reader&#x27;s Choice Award.&quot; In 2007, the website listed &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; as the 22nd best PlayStation 2 game of all time. Critics commended the visuals and hybrid action-adventure and role-playing feel to the game. IGN named it &quot;Best Art Style/Direction,&quot; runner-up for &quot;Best CG Graphics,&quot; and honorable mention for &quot;Best Animation&quot; in IGN&#x27;s 2003 list of &quot;Best Looking Games on PS2.&quot; GameSpy listed &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; twice in its &quot;Top 25 Video Game Cinematic Moments.&quot; &quot;GamePro&quot; stated that the graphics were &quot;gorgeous,&quot; giving them high marks. The audio was also praised, particularly the quality of the voice-overs and musical score. &quot;GamePro&quot; had positive comments on the overall audio and gave that aspect a perfect score.

Reception for the gameplay was mixed. Many reviews complained that the camera was at times frustrating and the Gummi Ship portions were out of place. GameSpot cited &quot;tedious&quot; gameplay and Gummi Ship sections as &quot;pale imitations of the &quot;Star Fox&quot; series,&quot; but stated that the combat was fun, particularly the boss fights. Dengeki Online commented on the camera controls, saying that the camera would often run into objects while being rotated by the player. &quot;GamePro&quot; compared the battle system to &quot;old N64 &quot;Zelda&quot; games&quot; and had positive comments about Donald and Goofy&#x27;s artificial intelligence.

The mix of Square and Disney elements also attracted acclaim. GameSpot commented that the concept of mixing the serious elements of &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; with the lighter elements of Disney seemed impossible, but was pulled off quite well. Because of that they awarded &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; &quot;Best Crossover Since &quot;Capcom vs. SNK&quot;&quot; in their 2002 Best and Worst of the Year awards. GameSpy noted that the periodic departure from the main plot into the Disney side stories was disappointing, and when the original plot builds to a climax, &quot;the story fails to gel thanks to a confusing mish-mash of vague terms and symbolism that probably made more sense in the director&#x27;s head than in this final product.&quot; Aside from the plot, they stated that the overall package was worth playing through to the end. G4TV awarded it &quot;Best Story&quot; at their 2003 G-Phoria awards show. Fan response was also positive; &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; was voted as the 19th best game of all-time by readers of the Japanese magazine &quot;Famitsu&quot;, 16th by the users of website GameFAQs, and 92nd by IGN users. &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; ranked ninth on IGN&#x27;s most recent &quot;Top 25 PS2 Games of All Time&quot; list. It ranked first on GamesRadar&#x27;s &quot;Top 7 Disney Games&quot; list in 2009. It was also a nominee for the Best Game Award from the for 2001–2002. In the making of the 2004 video game &quot;Fullmetal Alchemist and the Broken Angel&quot; the developers, Racjin, looked at other titles for inspiration, particularly &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; when making the game.

During the 6th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences nominated &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; for &quot;Console Role-Playing Game of the Year&quot; and outstanding achievement in &quot;Animation&quot;, &quot;Art Direction&quot;, and &quot;Character or Story Development&quot;.

==Sequels==

&quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; was followed by several sequels, becoming the first game in the &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; series. It was followed by a direct sequel, &quot;Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories&quot;, on the Game Boy Advance, which was released in Japan on November 11, 2004. &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot; is the third game in the series, set one year after &quot;Chain of Memories&quot;, and was released in Japan on December 22, 2005, for PlayStation 2. Like the first game it was re-released as &quot;Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix&quot; alongside a PS2 remake of &quot;Chain of Memories&quot;. A &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; game was developed exclusively for V CAST, Verizon Wireless&#x27;s broadband service, and was released on October 1, 2004, in Japan and on February 4, 2005, in the United States. In November 2008, &quot;Kingdom Hearts coded&quot; was released for mobile phones in Japan, the game takes place after the events of &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot;. A follow-up, &quot;Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days&quot;, was developed for the Nintendo DS and released in Japan on May 30, 2009, and in North America on September 29, 2009. A prequel was released in Japan on January 9, 2010, entitled &quot;Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep&quot;, for the PlayStation Portable, which takes place 10 years before the events of &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot;. The following title in the series was &quot;Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance&quot; for the Nintendo 3DS, released in 2012. At E3 2013, &quot;Kingdom Hearts III&quot; was announced to be in development for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, before being released in January 2019, followed by a downloadable content expansion titled &quot;Kingdom Hearts III Re Mind&quot; in early 2020. The following title, &quot;Kingdom Hearts: Melody of Memory&quot;, set after the &quot;Re Mind&quot; scenario, was then released in Japan on November 11, 2020, and worldwide two days later.

During Square Enix&#x27;s 20th anniversary event for the franchise in April 2022, a mobile title, &quot;Kingdom Hearts Missing-Link&quot;, was announced for iOS and Android devices, with a closed beta arriving in August, while the next mainline installment, &quot;Kingdom Hearts IV&quot;, was also revealed to be in development.

<doc id="210876" wikidata="Q2089970" url="?curid=210876" title="Sora (Kingdom Hearts)">
<text>is a character and the main protagonist of Disney and Square Enix&#x27;s &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; video game series. Introduced in the first &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; game in 2002, Sora is portrayed as a cheerful teenager who lives on the Destiny Islands and has been best friends with Riku and Kairi since childhood. When they plan to go on a journey to see other worlds, they are separated by creatures known as the Heartless, with Sora obtaining a weapon called the Keyblade. Donald Duck and Goofy then recruit him in their journey across various worlds to aid their king, Mickey Mouse, while Sora searches for his friends. Along the way, the trio protects the worlds they visit from the Heartless and other villains.

Sora was initially designed by the &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; series director and character designer Tetsuya Nomura during a discussion between Disney and Square about who the series&#x27;s protagonist should be. Wanting an original character, Nomura made various sketches of Sora until the design met the approval of Disney. Throughout the series, Sora has been voiced by Haley Joel Osment in the English version and Miyu Irino in the Japanese version. For his depiction as a child in the prequel &quot;Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep&quot;, Sora was voiced by Luke Manriquez and Takuto Yoshinaga in English and Japanese, respectively. Sora has made supporting appearances in other games from the series and reprised his role in manga and light novel adaptations of the games.

Sora&#x27;s character has received a generally positive critical response due to his warm personality and adventurous spirit. His personal and martial growth in the series also received praise, especially in his appearance in &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot;. Since his debut in &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot;, he has become popular among the video game community, with high rankings among character popularity polls. Due to its popularity, he was added to Nintendo&#x27;s fighting video game &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot; as a downloadable fighter and revealed to be the most requested fighter to appear in the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series.

==Concept and creation==
===Original concept and design===
Sora was designed by Tetsuya Nomura as the protagonist of &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot;. He was not originally slated to be the protagonist, as Disney wanted Donald Duck to fill the role, while Square wanted Mickey Mouse. Nomura designed Sora with the concepts of the Disney characters in mind, basing his outfit on Mickey Mouse&#x27;s trademark white gloves, red shorts and giant yellow shoes. Sora originally wielded a weapon resembling a chainsaw; however, the weapon was not well received by Disney, which led Nomura to redesign the weapon into a Keyblade. He was also designed with lion-like features, which were removed as the staff found them to be similar to those of &quot;Final Fantasy IX&quot; protagonist Zidane Tribal. The design was further reworked after a talk with the Disney staff, and Nomura finished it after a night&#x27;s work. Because Sora was a new character in the first &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot;, Square added &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; characters who support the protagonist.
One of the main concepts of Sora&#x27;s character in the series is that, according to Nomura, he is a normal boy instead of a supernatural being, even though he is deeply connected with other characters from the series. With Sora, Nomura wants to give players the message that even though they are not &quot;important people&quot;, they have the opportunity to accomplish great things. This was emphasized in &quot;Birth by Sleep&quot;″s secret ending, which Nomura hoped players would find because it showed Sora&#x27;s potential to influence everyone&#x27;s lives. In early versions of development of &quot;Birth by Sleep&quot;, Nomura thought that Ventus would actually be Sora before being reborn, but due to negative feedback from overseas, that plot line was discarded. Nomura has stated that Sora&#x27;s name can be interpreted as &quot;sky&quot;, since the Japanese word means sky. This name was also chosen to symbolize Sora&#x27;s role and his personality, as well as his close relationship with Riku and Kairi, making their three names together &quot;sky, land, and sea.&quot; He was also described by Nomura as having an outgoing personality, which allows him to make friends throughout the series. Of all of the characters he has designed, Nomura called Sora his favorite, describing him as &quot;special&quot; after having worked to develop the character over many games. The name of Noctis Lucis Caelum from &quot;Final Fantasy XV&quot; is also a reference to Sora; Sora and Caelum both mean &quot;sky&quot; in their respective languages, and Nomura considered Noctis to be his latest &quot;son&quot;. When &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot; included a note using Sora&#x27;s handwriting, Nomura wrote it himself.

===Development===
Following the first &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot;, Nomura was worried that players would be unhappy that Sora would start &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot; as a weak character with few powers who once again had to be leveled up like the first title. Therefore, Nomura developed the plot of &quot;Chain of Memories&quot; to explain how Sora loses his abilities in Castle Oblivion and then starts anew. Additionally, a new mystery regarding Sora&#x27;s memories of Twilight Town was added in &quot;Chain of Memories&quot;, which would be explained in &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot;. Sora was given a new outfit to reflect the time spent between &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; and &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot;. The team in charge of &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot; expressed difficulties in animating Sora&#x27;s &quot;Valor&quot; Drive Form for having a completely different motion except in Sora&#x27;s walking animation, which is shared with his regular motion. The Anti-Form was also made to focus on Sora&#x27;s dark side from the first &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot;, where he is temporarily transformed into a Heartless. Gameplaywise, the form was created to be both powerful and troublesome. The fights Sora has with Roxas and Xemnas were meant to surprise gamers, especially in the latter when the player loses control of Sora and Riku has to save him.

After finishing &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot;, Nomura wanted to give Sora a rest from the series in order to focus the following games on other characters from the series. Moreover, the events from the endings of &quot;Coded&quot; and &quot;Birth by Sleep&quot; hinted at a new mystery regarding Sora&#x27;s character, which would be revealed in &quot;Kingdom Hearts III&quot;. Although Nomura stated in March 2010 that Sora would once again be the focus of the next title, &quot;Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance&quot;, he stated that Sora would share it with another character with great importance. The switches between player characters Sora and Riku across the game are meant to contrast the style from &quot;Kingdom Hearts Birth By Sleep&quot;, which allowed the player to use three characters in their own campaigns, as well as to explain the word &quot;Distance&quot; in the title, because the two characters never interact across their stories. Nomura has stated that the themes of the game are trust and friendship, and that like &quot;Birth by Sleep&quot;, the story is on par with that of a numbered title. As a result of the game&#x27;s plot, both Sora and Riku appear in their younger forms from the first &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; game. To avoid misconceptions that &quot;Dream Drop Distance&quot; was a remake of the original game, Nomura decided to change Sora&#x27;s and Riku&#x27;s outfits for most of the game.

In response to rumors saying that Sora&#x27;s story would end in &quot;Kingdom Hearts III&quot;, Nomura answered that Sora is the protagonist of the series and that his role will end once the series ends. For this game, Nomura was interested in giving Sora a new costume, but was worried about doing so because of the popularity of the character&#x27;s &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot; outfit. In the end, he decided to create a new one as &quot;Kingdom Hearts III&quot; was a new numbered title. Nomura also revealed that Sora is the same proportions as in previous games; however, they &quot;muted the volume on his hair—it&#x27;s not wild.&quot; Regarding updating Sora&#x27;s look from his &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot; design, Nomura noted that the basis for the resulting design is a mix between Sora&#x27;s costumes for &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot; and &quot;Dream Drop Distance&quot;, one that is &quot;a lot more sleek and sporty&quot; since &quot;Sora does a lot more... acrobatic [and]... action-oriented movements&quot;. Sora&#x27;s new skills in &quot;Kingdom Hearts III&quot; were inspired by those of Terra from &quot;Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix&quot; and &quot;Birth by Sleep&quot; in order to surprise gamers with new powers related to the Keyblade, with other skills that were influenced by Sora&#x27;s and Riku&#x27;s powers from &quot;Dream Drop Distance&quot;. For the &quot;Monsters Inc.&quot; world, Nomura considered giving Sora a monster costume similar to the one Boo wears in the movie, but Pixar gave the idea to actually change Sora into a monster. Sora&#x27;s final stage in &quot;Kingdom Hearts III&quot; was left ambiguous though Nomura suggested it might be related to the Square Enix game &quot;The World Ends With You&quot;.
According to &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series director Masahiro Sakurai, Sora had been the winner of the &quot;Super Smash Bros. for 3DS and Wii U&quot; Fighter Ballot in 2015, and Sakurai was well aware of the various fan campaigns advocating for Sora&#x27;s inclusion in the series. Sakurai described Sora&#x27;s inclusion as a &quot;huge undertaking&quot; and &quot;perfect&quot; as the concluding fighter for &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot;. Sakurai also felt that it was &quot;impossible&quot; for Sora to appear in the series, but after Sakurai met a Disney executive at an awards show, Nintendo, Disney, and Square Enix began negotiations to include him. According to Luigi Priore, Vice President of Disney and Pixar Games, the company recognized that having Sora in &quot;Smash Bros.&quot; was something that fans had been asking for a long time, and the team was delighted to make it happen. &quot;Knowing the passion of &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; fans, we were not surprised [by the reaction], but we were thrilled,&quot; Priore added. &quot;It&#x27;s been incredible watching all the videos and commentary online.&quot; Nomura was actually more hesitant than Disney about Sora&#x27;s inclusion because of potential conflicts with the lore established in the &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; series at first, but seeing the positive reception by the public led him to conclude that &quot;the end result was really great.&quot; Sora was designed as a floaty, light, and aerial fighter. The majority of his moves are inspired by his appearance in the original &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot;, but per the limitations of the licensing agreement, Disney characters were not included as spirits or cameos.

In April 2022, during the interview with Nomura at &quot;Famitsu&quot;, he said that &quot;&quot;Kingdom Hearts 4&quot; will explore the contrast between the real world known as Quadratum and the fictional worlds of &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot;&quot;. He further said that &quot;Sora also looks more realistic due to him being in that world. However, if he were to return to his own world, his appearance would look similar to [how he would look with] the shaders used for Donald and Goofy.&quot;

===Casting===

Sora is voiced in Japanese by Miyu Irino, who used his normal voice for the beginning; Irino was filmed with cameras during voice recording to provide a reference for Sora&#x27;s mouth movements. As Irino grew older, he struggled with sounding as young as Sora, who remained the same in &quot;Re:coded&quot; as his data form. By &quot;Kingdom Hearts III&quot;, Irino faced more issues during recordings of the game. After finishing the game, Irino wondered if he might properly portray Sora in sequels due to his age gap.

In English, the character is voiced by Haley Joel Osment. Due to Sora&#x27;s lack of growth across the franchise, Osment faced the challenge of properly giving him the tone of a teenager; &quot;I think he&#x27;s a little bit older now [in &quot;Kingdom Hearts 3&quot;] than he was in &quot;Kingdom Hearts 1&quot; and &quot;2&quot;. But early on, you know, I started this when I was 12, and my voice had started to change and everything. So learning how to manipulate that and keep the voice sounding young while still preserving the range of emotions that Sora had; that was a unique challenge.&quot; In retrospect, Osment found the idea of ending &quot;Kingdom Hearts III&quot; as an emotional moment as, while the series is not ending with this installment, the narrative is giving a proper closure to the story started by the antagonist Xehanort. There have also been comments also with Osment and being praised by the media. &quot;Gaming Target&quot;″s Matt Swidder, who mentioned Osment &quot;makes a perfect fit for Sora&quot;. On the other hand, Osment&#x27;s work in &quot;Re:Chain of Memories&quot; was noted to have made a poor impact in his portrayal as the young lead, as he no longer sounds like in the original &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; game. Louis Bedigian from &quot;GameZone&quot; remarked on Osment&#x27;s continuous work in the sequel &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot;. &quot;RPGamer&quot; still praised Osment&#x27;s performance in the game, still finding him suitable for the protagonist. Koinya lamented the fact Miyu Irino&#x27;s work was never made available for the Western audience, considering him talented alongside Mamoru Miyano (Riku).

==Characteristics==
Sora appears as a boy with spiky brown-hair who, when first introduced, wears a red shirt, red pants, and a white and blue jacket covered by keychains. Upon traveling to certain worlds, Sora&#x27;s appearance is altered by Donald Duck&#x27;s magic to adapt to different environments and keep his origin from another world a secret; for example, he turns into a merman in underwater environments. After undergoing significant growth in &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot;, Sora is provided with a new, black outfit by Flora, Fauna and Merryweather. When battling, Sora&#x27;s outfit can change into other designs depending on the player&#x27;s choices. The primary form of Sora&#x27;s Keyblade is the , but through the use of in-game keychains, the Keyblade can assume a variety of unique forms. During &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot;, Sora dual-wields Keyblades, their forms depending on the player&#x27;s use of keychains.

Across the series, Sora is depicted as a cheerful teenager who cherishes his friendships and relies on them for his strength. As a result, several of Sora&#x27;s enemies use his friends as bait to use the Keyblade for their purposes. During the first game, it is discovered that Sora was not meant to wield the Keyblade, which only chooses him in the absence of its intended owner, Riku. However, Sora&#x27;s greater strength of heart causes the Keyblade to reject Riku in favor of Sora.

==Appearances==

In &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot;, Sora, Riku, and Kairi plan to leave their home on the Destiny Islands to explore new worlds. They are separated when the island is attacked by the Heartless; in the process, Sora obtains a Keyblade that he uses to eliminate the Heartless. Arriving in Traverse Town, Sora allies with Donald Duck and Goofy, who are under instruction from their missing king, Mickey Mouse, to follow the &quot;key&quot;. The three travel across worlds in their Gummi Ship in search of their missing friends, sealing the worlds&#x27; &quot;Keyholes&quot; along the way to protect them from being consumed by the Heartless. They are opposed by an alliance of Disney villains led by Maleficent, who seeks out the seven Princesses of Heart to unlock the Keyhole that leads to &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot;, a repository of knowledge and power, and the source of all hearts. Riku, who has come under Maleficent&#x27;s watch, fights with Sora on several occasions under the belief that Sora has replaced him with new friends. As the group travels to Hollow Bastion and defeat Maleficent, Riku becomes possessed by Ansem, who reveals that Kairi&#x27;s heart is in Sora&#x27;s body. To save Kairi, Sora impales himself with Ansem&#x27;s Keyblade, briefly transforming him into a Heartless before Kairi restores Sora to human form. After taking Kairi to safety, Sora, Donald, and Goofy defeat Ansem at the open door to Kingdom Hearts. From inside the door, Mickey and Riku help Sora and his friends close it to prevent the Heartless within from escaping, with Mickey and Sora using their Keyblades to lock the door. Separated from their friends again, Sora, Donald and Goofy continue their quest to reunite with Riku and Mickey.
In &quot;Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories&quot;, Sora&#x27;s group stumbles upon a fortress known as Castle Oblivion, where Naminé is forced by the group Organization XIII to manipulate their memories in order to turn Sora into their slave. After Sora and friends defeat the Organization members controlling the castle, Naminé helps restore the trio&#x27;s memories to their state prior to entering Castle Oblivion, at the cost of their memories of the events in the castle. This requires them to sleep in the castle for the restoration of memories to be completed.
In &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot;, Sora reawakens along with Donald and Goofy in Twilight Town once his Nobody, Roxas, merges within him. They visit Mickey&#x27;s master, Yen Sid, from whom they are reacquainted with Organization XIII. Sora embarks with Donald and Goofy to find Riku and King Mickey, traversing new and unfamiliar worlds to eliminate the threat of the remaining Heartless, Nobodies, and local villains. Learning that the Organization has abducted Kairi to force Sora to gather more hearts for them, Sora&#x27;s group rejoins Mickey and arrives at the Organization&#x27;s fortress in the World That Never Was, where they reunite with Kairi and Riku. After being separated from the others, Sora and Riku defeat Xemnas, after which a doorway appears that allows them to reunite with their friends on the Destiny Islands.
Sora makes a minor appearance in &quot;Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days&quot;, the majority of which is set as he sleeps to recover his lost memories from the events of &quot;Chain of Memories&quot;; it is also established that Xion, an experimental replica of Roxas created by the Organization, inadvertently hinders the restoration process until she joins with him. In &quot;Kingdom Hearts Coded&quot;, a computer program based on Sora&#x27;s likeness serves as the primary protagonist of the game, finding out the truth behind a mysterious message found inside Jiminy&#x27;s journal. A four-year-old Sora appears in the prequel, &quot;Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep&quot;; after Ventus, one of the protagonists, has his heart damaged following a confrontation with his dark side, Vanitas, his heart finds its way into Sora, who accepts it into his own heart. In the game&#x27;s secret ending, set after the events of &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot;, Ansem the Wise tells Aqua about Sora&#x27;s adventures, and how he may help all the people connected to him. In the final scene, Sora decides to save them after reading Mickey&#x27;s letter.
In &quot;Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance&quot;, Sora and Riku undertake a Mark of Mastery exam in response to Xehanort&#x27;s return. The two are sent to awaken several worlds submerged in sleep after the defeat of Ansem. Sora is lured into a deep slumber by Xehanort&#x27;s incarnations, who plan to turn him into a vessel for Xehanort&#x27;s heart. Riku and his friends save Sora and bring him back to Yen Sid&#x27;s tower, where Riku dives into Sora&#x27;s heart and awakens him. Because of Sora&#x27;s failure, he does not achieve the rank of Keyblade Master. In the ending of &quot;Kingdom Hearts 0.2 Birth by Sleep – A Fragmentary Passage&quot;, Yen Sid reveals that Sora has lost most of his powers as a consequence of Xehanort&#x27;s attempted possession, and advises Sora to seek out Hercules, who has gone through a similar experience.
In &quot;Kingdom Hearts III&quot;, Sora goes on a journey to regain his strength, particularly the required to restore the hearts of Ventus, Aqua, and Terra while also looking for a chance to restore Roxas. Sora engages prepares with Master Xehanort and the thirteen seekers from the new Organization XIII. Although Sora&#x27;s missions end in failures, upon finding Vanitas&#x27; body, Sora manages to properly use his strength and restore Ventus. Sora and the other Keyblade wielders go to Graveyard of their predecessors to fight Xehanort but are nearly killed by the amount of Heartless. After being restored by Namine, Sora uses his Power of Waking to give his friends another chance with Kairi&#x27;s help. After their return to the graveyard, Sora manages to restore Terra and defeat the Organization with the group. However, the original Xehanort kills Kairi, causing him to track him to his hometown where Xehanort accepts defeat after as he goes to the afterlife, giving Sora his χ-blade. Sora uses his power of waking to restore Kairi despite learning the risks of its overuse, which causes him to fade from existence.

Towards the end of her dream, Kairi confronts an illusion of Xehanort, who nearly overpowers her until Sora remotely takes control of her body and defeats him.
A 2D cartoonish avatar version of Sora wearing his original outfit in &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; is also present in the online community-based social gaming networking service, &quot;Kingdom Hearts Mobile&quot;.

In the &quot;Kingdom Hearts IV&quot; trailer, Sora is seen fighting a giant Heartless in the world of Quadratum.

===Other appearances===
Outside &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot;, Sora appeared as free limited-time downloadable content in the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; crossover game &quot;World of Final Fantasy&quot; in January 2017. In 2019, Sora appeared in the mobile game &quot;Disney Emoji Blitz&quot; to commemorate the release of &quot;Kingdom Hearts III&quot;. Sora appears as a playable fighter in the Nintendo Switch crossover fighting game &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot; via downloadable content, which was released on 18 October 2021.

Sora also appears in various &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; media adaptations, including a manga series written by Shiro Amano and a series of novels by Tomoko Kanemaki, which adapt his role in the video games. In a collaboration between Square Enix and Japanese fashion brand SuperGroupies, Sora&#x27;s image was used to create clothing based on his design from &quot;Kingdom Hearts III&quot;.

==Reception==
===Popularity===
Sora&#x27;s character was very well received by gaming media. Magazines have called him as one of the best and iconic character in video games. In an &quot;ASCII Media Works&quot; poll in which fans voted selected whose video game or manga character would like to name their children after, Sora&#x27;s name was second in the male category. Chris Penwell of &quot;PlayStation LifeStyle&quot; named Sora as his favorite character for having &quot;A relatable personality.&quot; Sora has the most appearances as hero in Square Enix RPGs, according to &quot;Guinness World Records&quot;″s &quot;The records held by Gamer&#x27;s Edition 2020 cover characters&quot;.

Various types of merchandising have been released based on Sora&#x27;s character. There are several types of action figures which show Sora with a different appearance such as his original form, the &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot; design and others variants. Other accessories has also been released. In October 2021, during the reveal of the 20th Anniversary of the &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; trailer, an Ichiban Kuji-based Sora merchandise was made, and is set to be released in 2022. In that same year, Square Enix also made a tote bag and tamagotchi, depicting Sora.

===Critical response===
Critics and fans have generally praised Sora. When Sora was first revealed in 2002, &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s Giancarlo Varanini regarded him as &quot;an appropriate amalgamation of the Square and Disney universes.&quot; He also comically noted that Sora &quot;doesn&#x27;t look like much, but you know how it goes.&quot; A &quot;1UP.com&quot; writer called Sora &quot;one of my all-time favorite Square characters&quot;, praising his cheerful personality. &quot;Gamasutra&quot; commented on Sora&#x27;s journey along the series in their feature &quot;The Birth of Collecting: The Osiris Archetype In Games&quot; by Jason Johnson; while comparing Sora with Isis, Johnson found Sora&#x27;s adventure appealing. &quot;IGN&quot; praised Sora&#x27;s resilient character, noting how such an ordinary &quot;youngster&quot; could face up to his challenges during his adventures for the sake of friendship, while &quot;RPGFan&quot;″s Nicole Monet Kirk labelled him as an &quot;extremely likable hero&quot;. Furthermore, in the book &quot;Interactive Storytelling for Video Games: A Player-Centered Approach to Creating Memorable Characters and Stories&quot;, it is noted that while Sora follows a &quot;standard hero archetype&quot;, his character becomes more believable and strong when worrying about his friends&#x27; fates. Louis Bedigian from &quot;GameZone&quot; mentioned that &quot;Sora had something rarely found in video-game characters: depth&quot; also praising his role in &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot;. &quot;Game Informer&quot;″s Bryan Vore found that in &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot;, Osment has improved in voicing the character, praising his work. He was third in &quot;1UP.com&quot;″s &quot;Top 5 Most Irritating RPG Protagonists&quot; with writer Bob Mackey commenting he is &quot;a human version of Mickey Mouse&quot;, criticizing his original outfit and relationship with Riku and Kairi, and finding him to be less popular than the Disney characters featured in the series.

Sora&#x27;s transformations in the various Disney worlds in &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot; were commented to be entertaining by Julia Reges from &quot;AllGame&quot; due to how varied they are. Also reviewing &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot;, Greg Bemis from &quot;G4TV&quot; praised Sora&#x27;s development in the game, including his growth and the fact each of his attacks from the title are entertaining. Although &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; also found an improvement in Sora&#x27;s movements due to sequences made with the Reaction Commands, they found them &quot;fairly straightforward.&quot; &quot;RPGamer&quot;″s Cortney Stone stated that Sora now moved &quot;like an acrobatic honed fighter&quot; in contrast to his &quot;adolescent awkwardness&quot; seen in the first &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot;, and remarked on Sora&#x27;s transformation into a lion seen in the sequel as enjoyable. His new outfit was also well received by &quot;GameSpy&quot;, who found it to be an improvement from the original one that looked like a &quot;wardrobe from Mickey Mouse&#x27;s closet&quot;. &quot;GamesRadar&quot; had similar opinions and particularly focused on Sora&#x27;s transformation and his new abilities. &quot;Game Informer&quot; viewed Sora&#x27;s Drive Forms as well as his combined techniques with other characters as one of the best additions to the gameplay. Sora also received negative comments regarding his characterization. In January 2007, Sora was listed the fourth &quot;biggest dork&quot; of 2006 by &quot;Game Informer&quot;, citing the Atlantica singing portions of the second main game.

Although &quot;IGN&quot; also praised Sora&#x27;s growth in &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot; in their article &quot;Kingdom Hearts III: The &quot;IGN&quot; Concept&quot;, they stated that in order to make his role in a future sequel more entertaining, he would need more development making him &quot;be confident, collected and committed to the tasks at hand&quot;. Both &quot;IGN&quot; and &quot;Anime News Network&quot; said Sora and Riku&#x27;s stories in &quot;Dream Drop Distance&quot; were just a preparation for their growth in &quot;Kingdom Hearts III&quot;, revealing that they are in a romantic relationship. Also commenting on his role in a future sequel, &quot;GamesRadar&quot; stated that having Sora&#x27;s character older would be necessary to make the story more mature, but Allegra Frank of &quot;Polygon&quot; felt that Sora&#x27;s characterization in &quot;Kingdom Hearts III&quot; was &quot;off&quot;. In retrospect, &quot;Paste Magazine&quot; found Sora&#x27;s story and links with his two similar other selves to be confusing. Wired regarded Sora as a hero who can make anything possible and wanted this to be done again in &quot;Kingdom Hearts III&quot;, hoping him to remain his likable traits. Critics panned the relationship between Sora and Kairi, criticizing the latter&#x27;s continued role as a damsel in distress to be rescued by the former, rather than an ally. &quot;RPGamer&quot; criticized Sora&#x27;s hero&#x27;s journey for being downplayed in contrast to the final worlds. Sora&#x27;s fate in the ending was the subject of analysis due to his apparent death after saving Kairi to the point &quot;GameRevolution&quot; stated that &quot;Kingdom Hearts III&quot; did not give the audience the happy ending they expected despite ending Xehanort&#x27;s arc. With the end of &quot;Re Mind&quot;, &quot;GameInformer&quot; said Sora&#x27;s characterization has been poor as he does not really go through a character arc despite appearing in several games to the point he is still a comic relief comparable to Ash Ketchum from &quot;Pokémon&quot; and Riku instead comes across more developed protagonist but as a result of tragedy which he does not want Sora to undergo.

Sora was a popular choice for inclusion in the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; roster among fans and numerous websites, including &quot;Screen Rant&quot;, &quot;GamingBolt&quot;, &quot;Shacknews&quot;, &quot;IGN&quot;, and &quot;Siliconera&quot;; although Jeremy Winslow of &quot;Kotaku&quot; opposed him because the roster already included too many sword-wielding characters, he later admitted that Sora was &quot;kinda cool&quot;. Kyle Campbell of &quot;USA Today&quot; and Wesley Leblanc of &quot;Game Informer&quot; both praised the character&#x27;s inclusion, stating that Sora&#x27;s addition &quot;is a big deal&quot; and &quot;perfect&quot;.

Upon the reveal of the first &quot;Kingdom Hearts IV&quot; trailer during April 2022, Polygon noted that there were several fans of the character wanting to know the true location of Sora&#x27;s apartment from the world of Quadratum which is heavily based on Shibuya, Japan. This led to the discovery that it was in the Regno Raffine building of Aoyama, Tokyo which Polygon found wealthy for the idea of Sora living there. Sora&#x27;s new shoes were also shown, and fans had mixed reactions to it and the loss of his clown shoes.

<text>The Royal Swedish Academy of Letters, History and Antiquities also called simply the Royal Academy of Letters or Vitterhetsakademien abbreviated KVHAA ( or or ) is the Swedish royal academy for the Humanities. Its many publications include the archaeological and art historical journal &quot;Fornvännen&quot;, published since 1906.

==History==

Now located in Rettigska house at Villa Street 3 in Stockholm, the Academy had origins in the early 1700s Uppsala. It was founded in 1753 by Queen Louisa Ulrica, Queen of Sweden and the mother of King Gustav III and originally dedicated to literature. In 1786 when the Swedish Academy was founded it was reconstituted under its present name with new objectives, mainly dedicated to historical and antiquarian preservation. This included a close cooperation with the Swedish National Heritage Board (Swedish: &quot;Riksantikvarieämbetet&quot;) whose director was, ex officio, the Academy&#x27;s secretary.

==Objectives==

The Academy&#x27;s purpose is &quot;to promote research and other activities in the humanities, religious studies, jurisprudence and social science disciplines and cultural heritage&quot;. This is done primarily through financial support and through vibrant publishing. Among the academy&#x27;s writings are Fornvännen. The Academy&#x27;s responsibilities have grown to encompass the entire activity of the humanities field in the broad sense, including religion, law and social studies. At the request of the government or public authority, or on its own initiative, the Academy gives opinions on matters that affect its activity.

==Cultural Heritage properties==

The Academy owns and operates the Stjernsund Castle in Närke, Skånelaholm Castle in Uppland, Stensjö hamlet in Småland and Borg hamlet on the island of Öland. Vitterhetsakademi&#x27;s library is included in the Swedish National Heritage Board and operates public scientific special interest libraries. It is open to the public.

==Organization==

Academy is composed of up to 30 executive members in each historical, antiquarian, philosophical, philological class and up to ten honorary members. Swedish and foreign &quot;corresponding members&quot; are not limited in number. When a working member reaches 70 years they can choose a new member, while 70-year-olds remain in the Academy as emeritus or emerita. Therefore, the Academy currently has around 130 members.

==Prizes==

Diploma, prizes, medals and awards distributed by the Academy at a formal gathering which takes place annually on 20 March. Academy awards several prizes such as the Gad Rausing&#x27;s prize for outstanding humanistic research, Ann-Kersti and Carl-Hakon Swenson&#x27;s Swenson prize and Rettigska price. The Academy also awards several medals such as the Gustaf Adolf Medal by the King&#x27;s consent, the Academy&#x27;s Medal of Merit in gold, Academy token in gold, Antiquarian medal and silver medal inscriptions in silver.

<doc id="210879" wikidata="Q5163211" url="?curid=210879" title="Consilience (book)">
<text>Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge is a 1998 book by the biologist E. O. Wilson, in which the author discusses methods that have been used to unite the sciences and might in the future unite them with the humanities.
Wilson uses the term &quot;consilience&quot; to describe the synthesis of knowledge from different specialized fields of human endeavor.

==Definition of &quot;consilience&quot;==
This book defines consilience as &quot;Literally a &#x27;jumping together&#x27; of knowledge by the linking of facts and fact-based theory across disciplines to create a common groundwork of explanation.&quot; The word is borrowed from Whewell&#x27;s phrase &quot;the consilience of inductions&quot; in his book &quot;Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences&quot;. Whewell posited that this consilience of inductions occurs when an induction obtained from one class of facts coincides with an induction obtained from a different class. In this way a consilience is a test of the truth of a theory.

==Examples of consilience discussed by Wilson==
===Chapter 1 The Ionian enchantment===
* The New Synthesis of Darwin&#x27;s theory of evolution with genetics is an example of unification. 
* The conviction that the world has a unified order and can be explained by natural laws, was dubbed by Gerald Holton the &quot;Ionian Enchantment&quot;.
* Thales of Miletus proposed that water is the unifying basis for all material things. This theory that water is fundamental is often cited as the first materialistic theory of a unified view of nature.
* Unification of forces in the Grand Unified Theory of modern physics.
* Albert Einstein&#x27;s work provides several examples of unification within the field of physics, for example, unification of Brownian motion with atomic theory.
* Science and religion have a unity of purpose: both want to explain the universe and understand our role in the universe.

===Chapter 2 The great branches of learning===
* Environmental protection requires the combining of knowledge from government regulators such as the United States Environmental Protection Agency, ethics, social science, biology, and physical sciences like chemistry.
* There is a unity of purpose for philosophy and science. Philosophers and scientists can work together at the borders between biology, social science and the humanities.
* Liberal arts education can be revitalized by the recognition of the unity of knowledge in higher education.
* Government policy requires unified knowledge from across specialized disciplines in the natural sciences, social sciences and humanities.

===Chapter 3 The Enlightenment ===
* The Enlightenment is discussed in the context of scientific knowledge applied to human rights and social progress.
* Marquis de Condorcet&#x27;s systematic application of mathematics in the social sciences.
* Francis Bacon was an early advocate of data collection and its analysis as the basis of sound knowledge (Baconian method) in fields that include social science and the humanities.
* René Descartes believed that the universe is rational and united and that interconnected truths run from physics to biology to moral reasoning. Descartes unified geometry and algebra (see: Cartesian coordinate system).
* Isaac Newton unified the Galilei&#x27;s laws of falling bodies with the laws of Copernicus&#x27; planetary motion (see: law of universal gravitation).
* Social science was pioneered by Adolphe Quetelet and Auguste Comte who developed the idea of studying behavior with scientific methods.
* Unity of purpose for Postmodernism and Science. Wilson argues that humanity is driven forward by the tension between those who upon viewing order create disorder and those who upon viewing disorder create order.

===Chapter 4 The natural sciences===
* The Greek Atomists such as Leucippus and Democritus are credited with the reductionistic idea that matter has fundamental components. Scientific investigation of this idea has resulted in unification across the natural sciences. An example is that the molecular structure of DNA accounts for genetic storage in living cells.
* Experimental Epistemology. Wilson provides a modern attempt to unify neuroscience and epistemology. He proposes it as a method for clarifying the Evolutionary basis of mismatches between physical reality and our mental models of reality.
* Positivism is a method for comparing and unifying knowledge from different disciplines. Priority is given to facts which are generated by experiment and objective observation rather than subjective speculations.
* Pragmatism is a method for comparing and unifying knowledge from different disciplines. Priority is given to methods and techniques that can be demonstrated to work and have pragmatic value.

===Chapter 5 Ariadne&#x27;s thread===
* Reduction versus synthesis. Many examples are given comparing consilience by reduction (dissection of a phenomenon into its components) and consilience by synthesis (predicting higher-order phenomena from more basic physical principles). One specific example is Wilson&#x27;s own work on the chemical signals that regulate insect social behavior.
* An example of consilience by reduction is Wilson&#x27;s attempt to account for the prevalence of serpent symbols in human cultures. He incorporates the activation-synthesis model of dreaming.
* Consilience between biology disciplines. Wilson discusses the successes (cells explained in terms of their chemical components, embryo development in terms of interactions between the cells of an embryo) but also points to the remaining problem of dealing with complex systems as in neuroscience and ecology.
* Statistical mechanics. A classical example in which the behavior of volumes of gas is explained in terms of the molecules of the gas (kinetic theory).
* Quantum chemistry, the reduction of chemical properties by quantum mechanical calculations.

===Chapter 6 The mind===
* Explaining consciousness and emotion in terms of brain activity. Wilson describes the neurobiological approach to accounting for consciousness and emotion in terms of brain physiology and how this effort is guided by collaboration between biologists, psychologists and philosophers. 
* Neurobiology of aesthetics. Wilson proposes that it will be possible to construct a neurobiological understanding of subjective experiences that are shared and explored by art. Common neural patterns of activity will be found to correspond to fundamental aesthetic experiences. 
* Artificial emotion. Wilson proposes that human-like artificial intelligence will require the engineering of a computational apparatus for processing an array of rich sensory inputs and the capacity to learn from those inputs in the way that children can learn. Requires consilience between biology, psychology and computer science.

===Chapter 7 From genes to culture===
* The relationship between genes and culture. Wilson posits that the basic element of culture is the meme. When a meme exists in a brain it has the form of a neuronal network that allows the meme to function within semantic memory. The link from genes to culture is that our genes shape our brains (in cooperation with the environment) and our brains allow us to work with memes as the basic units of culture.

===Chapter 8 - 12 ===
The remaining chapters are titled Chapter 8 The fitness of human nature, Chapter 9 The social sciences, Chapter 10 The arts and their interpretation, Chapter 11 Ethics and religion, Chapter 12 To what end?

<text>Crater is a small constellation in the southern celestial hemisphere. Its name is the latinization of the Greek &quot;krater&quot;, a type of cup used to water down wine. One of the 48 constellations listed by the second-century astronomer Ptolemy, it depicts a cup that has been associated with the god Apollo and is perched on the back of Hydra the water snake.

There is no star brighter than third magnitude in the constellation. Its two brightest stars, Delta Crateris of magnitude 3.56 and Alpha Crateris of magnitude 4.07, are ageing orange giant stars that are cooler and larger than the Sun. Beta Crateris is a binary star system composed of a white giant star and a white dwarf. Seven star systems have been found to host planets. A few notable galaxies, including Crater 2 and NGC 3981, and a famous quasar lie within the borders of the constellation.

==Mythology==

In the Babylonian star catalogues dating from at least 1100 BC, the stars of Crater were possibly incorporated with those of the crow Corvus in the Babylonian Raven (MUL.UGA.MUSHEN). British scientist John H. Rogers observed that the adjoining constellation Hydra signified Ningishzida, the god of the underworld in the Babylonian compendium MUL.APIN. He proposed that Corvus and Crater (along with the water snake Hydra) were death symbols and marked the gate to the underworld. Corvus and Crater also featured in the iconography of Mithraism, which is thought to have been of middle-eastern origin before spreading into Ancient Greece and Rome.

Crater is identified with a story from Greek mythology in which a crow or raven serves Apollo, and is sent to fetch water, but it delays its journey as it finds some figs and waits for them to ripen before eating them. Finally, it retrieves the water in a cup and takes back a water snake, blaming it for drinking the water. According to the myth, Apollo saw through the fraud, and angrily cast the crow, cup, and snake into the sky. The three constellations were arranged in such a way that the crow was prevented from drinking from the cup, and hence seen as a warning against sinning against the gods.

Phylarchus wrote of a different origin for Crater. He told how the city of Eleusa near Troy was beset by plague. Its ruler Demiphon consulted an oracle which decreed that a maiden should be sacrificed each year. Demiphon declared that he would choose a maiden by lottery, but he did not include his own daughters. One nobleman, Mastusius, objected, forcing Demiphon to sacrify his daughter. Later, Mastusius killed Demiphon&#x27;s daughters and tricked the ruler in drinking a cup containing a mixture of their blood and wine. Upon finding out the deed, the king ordered Mastusius and the cup to be thrown into the sea. Crater signifies the cup.

===In other cultures===

In Chinese astronomy, the stars of Crater are located within the constellation of the Vermillion Bird of the South (南方朱雀, &quot;Nán Fāng Zhū Què&quot;). They depict, along with some stars from Hydra, &quot;Yi&quot;, the Red Bird&#x27;s wings. &quot;Yi&quot; also denotes the 27th lunar mansion. Alternatively, &quot;Yi&quot; depicts a heroic bowman; his bow composed of other stars in Hydra. In the Society Islands, Crater was recognized as a constellation called &quot;Moana-&#x27;ohu-noa-&#x27;ei-ha&#x27;a-moe-hara&quot; (&quot;vortex-ocean-in-which-to-lose-crime&quot;).

== Characteristics ==
Covering 282.4 square degrees and hence 0.685% of the sky, Crater ranks 53rd of the 88 constellations in area. It is bordered by Leo and Virgo to the north, Corvus to the east, Hydra to the south and west, and Sextans to the northwest. The three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the International Astronomical Union in 1922, is &quot;Crt&quot;. The official constellation boundaries, as set by Belgian astronomer Eugène Delporte in 1930, are defined by a polygon of six segments (&quot;illustrated in infobox&quot;). In the equatorial coordinate system, the right ascension coordinates of these borders lie between and , while the declination coordinates are between −6.66° and −25.20°. Its position in the southern celestial hemisphere means that the whole constellation is visible to observers south of 65°N.

==Features==
===Stars===

The German cartographer Johann Bayer used the Greek letters alpha through lambda to label the most prominent stars in the constellation. Bode added more, though only Psi Crateris remains in use. John Flamsteed gave 31 stars in Crater and the segment of Hydra immediately below Crater Flamsteed designations, naming the resulting constellation Hydra et Crater. Most of these stars lie in Hydra. The three brightest stars—Delta, Alpha, and Gamma Crateris—form a triangle located near the brighter star Nu Hydrae in Hydra. Within the constellation&#x27;s borders, there are 33 stars brighter than or equal to apparent magnitude 6.5.

Delta Crateris is the brightest star in Crater at magnitude 3.6. Located 163 ± 4 light-years away, it is an orange giant star of spectral type K0III that is 1.0–1.4 times as massive as the Sun. An ageing star, it has cooled and expanded to times the Sun&#x27;s radius. It is radiating as much power as the Sun from its outer envelope at an effective temperature of . Traditionally called Alkes &quot;the cup&quot;, and marking the base of the cup is Alpha Crateris, an orange-hued star of magnitude 4.1, that is 141 ± 2 light-years from the Sun. With an estimated mass 1.75 ± 0.24 times that of the Sun, it has exhausted its core hydrogen and expanded to 13.2 ± 0.55 times the Sun&#x27;s diameter, shining with 69 times its luminosity and an effective temperature of around 4600 K.

With a magnitude of 4.5, Beta Crateris is a binary star system, consisting of a white-hued giant star of spectral type A1III and a white dwarf of spectral type DA1.4, 296 ± 8 light-years from the Sun. Much smaller than the primary, the white dwarf cannot be seen as a separate object, even by the Hubble Space Telescope. Gamma Crateris is a double star, resolvable in small amateur telescopes. The primary is a white main sequence star of spectral type A7V, that is an estimated 1.81 times as massive as the Sun, while the secondary—of magnitude 9.6—has 75% the Sun&#x27;s mass, and is likely an orange dwarf. The two stars take at least 1150 years to orbit each other. The system is 85.6 ± 0.8 light-years away from the Sun.

Epsilon and Zeta Crateris mark the Cup&#x27;s rim. The largest naked eye star in the constellation, Epsilon Crateris is an evolved K-type giant star with a stellar classification of K5 III. It has about the same mass as the Sun, but has expanded to 44.7 times the Sun&#x27;s radius. The star is radiating 391 times the solar luminosity. It is 366 ± 8 light-years distant from the Sun. Zeta Crateris is a binary star system. The primary, component A, is a magnitude 4.95 evolved giant star with a stellar classification of G8 III. It is a red clump star that is generating energy through the fusion of helium at its core. Zeta Crateris has expanded to 13 times the radius of the Sun, and shines with 157 times the luminosity of the Sun. The secondary, component B, is a magnitude 7.84 star. Zeta Crateris is a confirmed member of the Sirius supercluster and is a candidate member of the Ursa Major Moving Group, a collection of stars that share a similar motion through space and may have at one time been members of the same open cluster. The system is located 326 ± 9 light-years from the Sun.

Variable stars are popular targets for amateur astronomers. Their observations provide valuable contributions to understanding star behaviour. Located near Alkes is the red-hued R Crateris, a semiregular variable star of type SRb and a spectral classification of M7. It ranges from magnitude 9.8 to 11.2 over an optical period of 160 days. It is 770 ± 40 light-years distant from the Sun. TT Crateris is a cataclysmic variable; a binary system composed of a white dwarf around as massive as the Sun in close orbit with an orange dwarf of spectral type K5V. The two orbit each other every 6 hours 26 minutes. The white dwarf strips matter off its companion, forming an accretion disk which periodically ignites and erupts. The star system has a magnitude of 15.9 when quiescent, brightening to 12.7 in outburst. SZ Crateris is a magnitude 8.5 BY Draconis type variable star. It is a nearby star system located about 42.9 ± 1.0 light-years from the Sun, and is a member of the Ursa Major Moving Group.
HD 98800, also known as TV Crateris, is a quadruple star system around 7–10 million years old, made up of two pairs of stars in close orbit. One pair has a debris disk that contains dust and gas orbiting them both. Spanning the distance between 3 and 5 astronomical units from the stars, it is thought to be a protoplanetary disk. DENIS-P J1058.7-1548 is a brown dwarf less than 5.5% as massive as the Sun. With a surface temperature of between 1700 and 2000 K, it is cool enough for clouds to form. Variations in its brightness in visible and infrared spectra suggest it has some form of atmospheric cloud cover.

HD 96167 is a star 1.31 ± 0.09 times as massive as the Sun, that has most likely exhausted its core hydrogen and begun expanding and cooling into a yellow subgiant with a diameter 1.86 ± 0.07 times that of the Sun, and 3.4 ± 0.2 times its luminosity. Analysis of its radial velocity revealed it has a planet with a minimum mass 68% that of Jupiter, which takes 498.9 ± 1.0 days to complete an orbit. With the orbital separation varying between 0.38 and 2.22 astronomical units, the orbit is highly eccentric. The stellar system is 279 ± 1 light-years away from the Sun. HD 98649 is a yellow main sequence star, classified as a G4V, that has the same mass and diameter as the Sun, but has only 86% of its luminosity. In 2012, a long-period ( 4951 days) planet companion, at least 6.8 times as massive as Jupiter, was discovered by radial velocity method. Its orbit was calculated to be highly eccentric, swinging out to 10.6 astronomical units away from its star, and hence a candidate for direct imaging. BD-10°3166 is a metallic orange main sequence star of spectral type K3.0V, 268 ± 10 light-years distant from the Sun. It was found to have a hot Jupiter-type planet that has a minimum mass of 48% of Jupiter&#x27;s, and takes only 3.49 days to complete an orbit. WASP-34 is a sun-like star of spectral type G5V that has 1.01 ± 0.07 times the mass and 0.93 ± 0.12 times the diameter of the Sun. It has a planet 0.59 ± 0.01 times as massive as Jupiter that takes 4.317 days to complete an orbit. The system is 432 ± 3 light-years distant from the Sun.

===Deep-sky objects===
The Crater 2 dwarf is a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way, located approximately 380,000 light-years from the Sun. NGC 3511 is a spiral galaxy seen nearly edge-on, of magnitude 11.0, located 2° west of Beta Crateris. Located 11&#x27; away is NGC 3513, a barred spiral galaxy. NGC 3981 is a spiral galaxy with two wide and perturbed spiral arms. It is a member of the NGC 4038 Group, which, along with NGC 3672 and NGC 3887, are part of a group of 45 galaxies known as the Crater Cloud within the Virgo Supercluster.

RX J1131 is a quasar located 6 billion light-years away from the Sun. The black hole in the center of the quasar was the first black hole whose spin has ever been directly measured. GRB 011211 was a gamma-ray burst (GRB) detected on December 11, 2001. The burst lasted 270 seconds, making it the longest burst that had ever been detected by X-ray astronomy satellite BeppoSAX up to that point. GRB 030323 lasted 26 seconds and was detected on 23 March 2003.

===Meteor showers===
The Eta Craterids are a faint meteor shower that takes place between 11 and 22 January, peaking around January 16 and 17, near Eta Crateris.

<text>The Royal Swedish Academy of Fine Arts (), commonly called the Royal Academy, is located in Stockholm, Sweden. An independent organization that promotes the development of painting, sculpture, architecture, and other fine arts, it is one of several Swedish Royal Academies. The Royal Institute of Art, an art school that was once an integral part of the academy, was broken out in 1978 as an independent entity directly under the supervision of the Ministry of Education.

==History==

In 1735, Carl Gustaf Tessin set up a drawing school at Stockholm Castle, naming it the Royal Drawing Academy. It was modeled after French academies of the day as a gathering place for established artists and art connoisseurs. The painters Guillaume Taraval, Johan Henrik Scheffel, and Olof Arenius and the architect Carl Hårleman taught there, and the first group of students included Johan Pasch.

In 1766, the academy expanded its activities following a parliamentary decree. In 1768, its name was changed to the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture. In 1773, King Gustav III wrote the first statutes for the academy&#x27;s organization. At the time, the curriculum spanned architecture, graphics, anatomy, theory of perspective, and cultural history. The late 18th century is considered the first golden age of the Royal Academy, when great artists of the time such as Johan Tobias Sergel were elected as members and also taught there. In 1810, it was renamed again to Royal Swedish Academy of Fine Arts (Swedish: ), the name it still bears today.

By the 1830s, there was beginning to be opposition to the Royal Academy&#x27;s commitment to traditional academic art. In addition, while both men and women could be elected as members of the academy, at the time women could only study art by special permission before 1864, when women students were accepted. The Stockholm Art Association was formed to offer exhibition alternatives, and an Impressionist artists&#x27; group known as Opponenterna (&#x27;the Opponents&#x27;) arose as well.

==Location==
In 1780, the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture moved from Stockholm Palace into a 17th-century palace designed by the architect Nicodemus Tessin the Elder on Fredsgatan street in the city center. In the years 1842–1846 it was redesigned by the architect Fredrik Blom and an extension was added in 1893–1896.

<doc id="210892" wikidata="Q698" url="?curid=210892" title="Firefox">
<text>Mozilla Firefox, or simply Firefox, is a free and open source web browser developed by the Mozilla Foundation and its subsidiary, the Mozilla Corporation. It uses the Gecko rendering engine to display web pages, which implements current and anticipated web standards. Firefox is available for Windows 10 or later versions of Windows, macOS, and Linux. Its unofficial ports are available for various Unix and Unix-like operating systems, including FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, and other operating systems, such as reactOS. Firefox is also available for Android and iOS. However, as with all other iOS web browsers, the iOS version uses the WebKit layout engine instead of Gecko due to platform requirements. An optimized version is also available on the Amazon Fire TV as one of the two main browsers available with Amazon&#x27;s Silk Browser.

Firefox is the spiritual successor of Netscape Navigator, as the Mozilla community was created by Netscape in 1998, before its acquisition by AOL. Firefox was created in 2002 under the codename &quot;Phoenix&quot; by members of the Mozilla community who desired a standalone browser rather than the Mozilla Application Suite bundle. During its beta phase, it proved to be popular with its testers and was praised for its speed, security, and add-ons compared to Microsoft&#x27;s then-dominant Internet Explorer 6. It was released on November 9, 2004, and challenged Internet Explorer&#x27;s dominance with 60 million downloads within nine months. In November 2017, Firefox began incorporating new technology under the code name &quot;Quantum&quot; to promote parallelism and a more intuitive user interface.

Firefox usage share grew to a peak of 32.21% in November 2009, with Firefox 3.5 overtaking Internet Explorer 7, although not all versions of Internet Explorer as a whole; its usage then declined in competition with Google Chrome. , according to StatCounter, it had a 6.26% usage share on traditional PCs (i.e. as a desktop browser), making it the fourth-most popular PC web browser after Google Chrome (65%), Microsoft Edge (13%), and Safari (9.0%).

== History ==

The project began as an experimental branch of the Mozilla project by Dave Hyatt, Joe Hewitt, and Blake Ross. They believed the commercial requirements of Netscape&#x27;s sponsorship and developer-driven feature creep compromised the utility of the Mozilla browser. To combat what they saw as the Mozilla Suite&#x27;s software bloat, they created a standalone browser, with which they intended to replace the Mozilla Suite. Version 0.1 was released on September 23, 2002. On April 3, 2003, the Mozilla Organization announced that it planned to change its focus from the Mozilla Suite to Firefox and Thunderbird.
The Firefox project has undergone several name changes. The nascent browser was originally named Phoenix, after the mythical bird that rose triumphantly from the ashes of its dead predecessor (in this case, from the &quot;ashes&quot; of Netscape Navigator, after it was sidelined by Microsoft Internet Explorer in the &quot;First Browser War&quot;). Phoenix was renamed in 2003 due to a trademark claim from Phoenix Technologies. The replacement name, Firebird, provoked an intense response from the Firebird database software project. The Mozilla Foundation reassured them that the browser would always bear the name Mozilla Firebird to avoid confusion. After further pressure, Mozilla Firebird became Mozilla Firefox on February 9, 2004. The name Firefox was said to be derived from a nickname of the red panda, which became the mascot for the newly named project. For the abbreviation of Firefox, Mozilla prefers &quot;Fx&quot; or &quot;fx,&quot; although it is often abbreviated as &quot;FF&quot; or Ff.

The Firefox project went through many versions before version 1.0 and had already gained a great deal of acclaim from numerous media outlets, such as &quot;Forbes&quot; and &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;. Among Firefox&#x27;s popular features were the integrated pop-up blocker, tabbed browsing, and an extension mechanism for adding functionality. Although these features have already been available for some time in other browsers such as the Mozilla Suite and Opera, Firefox was the first of these browsers to have achieved large-scale adoption so quickly. Firefox attracted attention as an alternative to Internet Explorer, which had come under fire for its alleged poor program design and insecurity—detractors cite IE&#x27;s lack of support for certain Web standards, use of the potentially dangerous ActiveX component, and vulnerability to spyware and malware installation. Microsoft responded by releasing Windows XP Service Pack 2, which added several important security features to Internet Explorer 6.

Version 1.0 of Firefox was released on November 9, 2004. This was followed by version 1.5 in November 2005, version 2.0 in October 2006, version 3.0 in June 2008, version 3.5 in June 2009, version 3.6 in January 2010, and version 4.0 in March 2011. From version 5 onwards, the development and release model changed into a &quot;rapid&quot; one; by the end of 2011 the stable release was version 9, and by the end of 2012 it reached version 17.

Major redesigns of its graphical user interface occurred on versions 4.0 (&quot;Strata&quot;) in March 2011, 29.0 (&quot;Australis&quot;) in April 2014, 57.0 (&quot;Photon&quot;) in November 2017, and 89.0 (&quot;Proton&quot;) in June 2021.

In 2016, Mozilla announced a project known as Quantum, which sought to improve Firefox&#x27;s Gecko engine and other components to improve the browser&#x27;s performance, modernize its architecture, and transition the browser to a multi-process model. These improvements came in the wake of decreasing market share to Google Chrome, as well as concerns that its performance was lapsing in comparison. Despite its improvements, these changes required existing add-ons for Firefox to be made incompatible with newer versions, in favor of a new extension system that is designed to be similar to Chrome and other recent browsers. Firefox 57, which was released in November 2017, was the first version to contain enhancements from Quantum, and has thus been named &quot;Firefox Quantum&quot;. A Mozilla executive stated that Quantum was the &quot;biggest update&quot; to the browser since version 1.0. Unresponsive and crashing pages only affect other pages loaded within the same process. While Chrome uses separate processes for each loaded tab, Firefox distributes tabs over four processes by default (since Quantum), in order to balance memory consumption and performance. The process count can be adjusted, where more processes increase performance at the cost of memory, therefore suitable for computers with larger RAM capacity.

On May 3, 2019, the expiry of an intermediate signing certificate on Mozilla servers caused Firefox to automatically disable and lock all browser extensions (add-ons). Mozilla began the roll-out of a fix shortly thereafter, using their Mozilla Studies component.

Support for Adobe Flash was dropped on January 6, 2021, with the release of Firefox 85.

On June 1, 2021, Firefox&#x27;s &#x27;Proton&#x27; redesign was offered through its stable release channel after being made available in the beta builds. While users were initially allowed to revert to the old design through about:config, the corresponding key-value pairs reportedly stopped working in later builds, resulting in criticism. These included accessibility concerns despite Mozilla&#x27;s claim to &quot;continue to work with the accessibility community&quot; and had not been resolved .

On January 13, 2022, an issue with Firefox&#x27;s HTTP/3 implementation resulted in a widespread outage for several hours.

On September 26, 2023, Firefox 118.0 introduced on-device translation of web page content.

On January 23, 2024, along with the release of Firefox 122.0, Mozilla introduced an official APT repository for Debian-based Linux distributions.

== Features ==

Features of the desktop edition include tabbed browsing, full-screen mode, spell checking, incremental search, smart bookmarks, bookmarking and downloading through drag and drop, a download manager, user profile management, private browsing, bookmark tags, bookmark exporting, offline mode, a screenshot tool, web development tools, a &quot;page info&quot; feature which shows a list of page metadata and multimedia items, a configuration menu at codice_1 for power users, and location-aware browsing (also known as &quot;geolocation&quot;) based on a Google service. Firefox has an integrated search system which uses Google by default in most markets. DNS over HTTPS is another feature whose default behaviour is determined geographically.

Firefox provides an environment for web developers in which they can use built-in tools, such as the Error Console or the DOM Inspector, and extensions, such as Firebug and more recently there has been an integration feature with Pocket. Firefox Hello was an implementation of WebRTC, added in October 2014, which allows users of Firefox and other compatible systems to have a video call, with the extra feature of screen and file sharing by sending a link to each other. Firefox Hello was scheduled to be removed in September 2016.

Former features include a File Transfer Protocol (FTP) client for browsing file servers, the ability to block images from individual domains (until version 72), a 3D page inspector (versions 11 to 46), tab grouping (until version 44), and the ability to add customized extra toolbars (until version 28).

=== Browser extensions ===
Functions can be added through add-ons created by third-party developers. Add-ons are primarily coded using an HTML, CSS, JavaScript, with API known as WebExtensions, which is designed to be compatible with Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge extension systems. Firefox previously supported add-ons using the XUL and XPCOM APIs, which allowed them to directly access and manipulate much of the browser&#x27;s internal functionality. As compatibility was not included in the multi-process architecture, XUL add-ons have been deemed &quot;Legacy add-ons&quot; and are no longer supported on Firefox 57 &quot;Quantum&quot; and newer.

Mozilla has occasionally installed extensions for users without their permission. This happened in 2017 when an extension designed to promote the show &quot;Mr. Robot&quot; was silently added in an update to Firefox.

=== Themes ===
Firefox can have themes added to it, which users can create or download from third parties to change the appearance of the browser. Firefox also provides dark, light, and system themes.

=== Guest session ===
In 2013, Firefox for Android added a &quot;guest session&quot; mode, which wiped browsing data such as tabs, cookies, and history at the end of each guest session. Guest session data was kept even when restarting the browser or device, and deleted only upon a manual exit. The feature was removed in 2019, purportedly to &quot;streamline the experience&quot;.

=== Standards ===
Firefox implements many web standards, including HTML4 (almost full HTML5), XML, XHTML, MathML, SVG 1.1 (full), SVG 2 (partial), CSS (with extensions), ECMAScript (JavaScript), DOM, XSLT, XPath, and APNG (Animated PNG) images with alpha transparency. Firefox also implements standards proposals created by the WHATWG such as client-side storage, and the canvas element. These standards are implemented through the Gecko layout engine, and SpiderMonkey JavaScript engine. Firefox 4 was the first release to introduce significant HTML5 and CSS3 support.

Firefox has passed the Acid2 standards-compliance test since version 3.0. Mozilla had originally stated that they did not intend for Firefox to pass the Acid3 test fully because they believed that the SVG fonts part of the test had become outdated and irrelevant, due to WOFF being agreed upon as a standard by all major browser makers. Because the SVG font tests were removed from the Acid3 test in September 2011, Firefox 4 and greater scored 100/100.

Firefox also implements &quot;Safe Browsing,&quot; a proprietary protocol from Google used to exchange data related with phishing and malware protection.

Firefox supports the playback of video content protected by HTML5 Encrypted Media Extensions (EME), since version 38. For security and privacy reasons, EME is implemented within a wrapper of open-source code that allows execution of a proprietary DRM module by Adobe Systems—Adobe Primetime Content Decryption Module (CDM). CDM runs within a &quot;sandbox&quot; environment to limit its access to the system and provide it a randomized device ID to prevent services from uniquely identifying the device for tracking purposes. The DRM module, once it has been downloaded, is enabled, and disabled in the same manner as other plug-ins. Since version 47, &quot;Google&#x27;s Widevine CDM on Windows and Mac OS X so streaming services like Amazon Video can switch from Silverlight to encrypted HTML5 video&quot; is also supported. Mozilla justified its partnership with Adobe and Google by stating:

and that it is &quot;an important step on Mozilla&#x27;s roadmap to remove NPAPI plugin support.&quot; Upon the introduction of EME support, builds of Firefox on Windows were also introduced that exclude support for EME. The Free Software Foundation and Cory Doctorow condemned Mozilla&#x27;s decision to support EME.

Firefox has been criticized by web developers for adopting web standard and fixing bugs which are decades old. No support for view transition, gradient and CSS features lack is also criticized. Firefox scores less on both HTML5 Test and JetStream2 compared to rival browsers.

Other issues include high battery usage, being highly resource intensive, removal of tab group, use of telemetry, ads in search bar, dated download system, lack of PWA, and lack of ability to share text fragment.

== Security ==
From its inception, Firefox was positioned as a security-focused browser. At the time, Internet Explorer, the dominant browser, was facing a security crisis. Multiple vulnerabilities had been found, and malware like Download.Ject could be installed simply by visiting a compromised website. The situation was so bad that the US Government issued a warning against using Internet Explorer. Firefox, being less integrated with the operating system, was considered a safer alternative since it was less likely to have issues that could completely compromise a computer. This led to a significant increase in Firefox&#x27;s popularity during the early 2000s as a more secure alternative. Moreover, Firefox was considered to have fewer actively exploitable security vulnerabilities compared to its competitors. In 2006, The Washington Post reported that exploit code for known security vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer were available for 284 days compared to only nine days for Firefox before the problem was fixed. A Symantec study around the same period showed that even though Firefox had a higher number of vulnerabilities, on average vulnerabilities were fixed faster in Firefox than in other browsers during that period.

During this period, Firefox used a monolithic architecture, like most browsers at the time. This meant all browser components ran in a single process with access to all system resources. This setup had multiple security issues. If a web page used too many resources, the entire Firefox process would hang or crash, affecting all tabs. Additionally, any exploit could easily access system resources, including user files. Between 2008 and 2012, most browsers shifted to a multiprocess architecture, isolating high-risk processes like rendering, media, GPU, and networking. However, Firefox was slower to adopt this change. It wasn&#x27;t until 2015 that Firefox started its Electrolysis (e10s) project to implement sandboxing across multiple components. This rewrite relied on interprocess communication using Chromium&#x27;s interprocess communication library and placed various component including the rendering component in its own sandbox. Firefox released this rewrite in to beta in August 2016, noting a 10–20% increase in memory usage, which was lower than Chrome&#x27;s at the time. However, the rewrite caused issues with their legacy extension API, which was not designed to work cross-process and required shim code to function correctly. After over a year in beta, the rewrite was enabled by default all users of Firefox in November 2017.

In 2012, Mozilla launched a new project called Servo to write a completely new and experimental browser engine utilizing memory safe techniques written in Rust. In 2018, Mozilla opted to integrate parts of the Servo project into the Gecko engine in a project codenamed the Quantum project. The project completely overhauled Firefox&#x27;s page rendering code resulting in performance and stability gains while also improving the security of existing components. Additionally, the older incompatible extension API was removed in favour of a WebExtension API that more closely resembled Google Chrome&#x27;s extension system. This broke compatibility with older extensions but resulted in fewer vulnerabilities and a much more maintainable extension system. While the Servo project was intended to replace more parts of the Gecko Engine, this plan never came to fruition. In 2020, Mozilla laid off all developers on the Servo team transferring ownership of the project to the Linux Foundation.

== Privacy ==
When Firefox initially released, it used a custom script permission policy where scripts that were signed by the page could gain access to higher privilege actions such as the ability to set a user&#x27;s preferences. However, this model was not widely used and was later discontinued by Firefox. Modern day Firefox instead follows the standard same-origin policy permission model that is followed by most modern browsers which disallows scripts from accessing any privileged data including data about other websites.

It uses TLS to protect communications with web servers using strong cryptography when using the HTTPS protocol. The freely available HTTPS Everywhere add-on enforces HTTPS, even if a regular HTTP URL is entered. Firefox now supports HTTP/2.

In February 2013, plans were announced for Firefox 22 to disable third-party cookies by default. However, the introduction of the feature was then delayed so Mozilla developers could &quot;collect and analyze data on the effect of blocking some third-party cookies.&quot; Mozilla also collaborated with Stanford University&#x27;s &quot;Cookie Clearinghouse&quot; project to develop a blacklist and whitelist of sites that will be used in the filter.

Version 23, released in August 2013, followed the lead of its competitors by blocking iframe, stylesheet, and script resources served from non-HTTPS servers embedded on HTTPS pages by default. Additionally, JavaScript could also no longer be disabled through Firefox&#x27;s preferences, and JavaScript was automatically re-enabled for users who upgraded to 23 or higher with it disabled. The change was made due to the fact the JavaScript was being used across a majority of websites on the web and disabling JavaScript could potentially have untoward repercussions on inexperienced users who are unaware of its impact. Firefox also cited the fact that extensions like NoScript, that can disable JavaScript in a more controlled fashion, were widely available. The following release added the ability to disable JavaScript through the developer tools for testing purposes.

Beginning with Firefox 48, all extensions must be signed by Mozilla to be used in release and beta versions of Firefox. Firefox 43 blocked unsigned extensions but allowed enforcement of extension signing to be disabled. All extensions must be submitted to Mozilla Add-ons and be subject to code analysis in order to be signed, although extensions do not have to be listed on the service to be signed. On May 2, 2019, Mozilla announced that it would be strengthening the signature enforcement with methods that included the retroactive disabling of old extensions now deemed to be insecure.
Since version 60 Firefox includes the option to use DNS over HTTPS (DoH), which causes DNS lookup requests to be sent encrypted over the HTTPS protocol. To use this feature the user must set certain preferences beginning with &quot;network.trr&quot; (Trusted Recursive Resolver) in : if network.trr.mode is 0, DoH is disabled; 1 activates DoH in addition to unencrypted DNS; 2 causes DoH to be used before unencrypted DNS; to use only DoH, the value must be 3. By setting network.trr.uri to the URL, special Cloudflare servers will be activated. Mozilla has a privacy agreement with this server host that restricts their collection of information about incoming DNS requests.

On May 21, 2019, Firefox was updated to include the ability to block scripts that used a computer&#x27;s CPU to mine cryptocurrency without a user&#x27;s permission, in Firefox version 67.0. The update also allowed users to block known fingerprinting scripts that track their activity across the web, however it does not resist fingerprinting on its own.

In March 2021, Firefox launched SmartBlock in version 87 to offer protection against cross-site tracking, without breaking the websites users visit. Also known as state partitioning or &quot;total cookie protection&quot;, SmartBlock works via a feature in the browser that isolates data from each site visited by the user to ensure that cross-site scripting is very difficult if not impossible. The feature also isolates local storage, service workers and other common ways for sites to store data.

In 2025, Mozilla received criticism after changes to the Firefox Terms of Use. The new wording was perceived to reduce privacy, and was seen to be connected to AI, while Mozilla denied that these were the motives. Criticism centered on fears that the license grant covered all data inputted, while Mozilla responded saying that the change &quot;does NOT give us ownership of your data&quot;. In an attempt to respond to the fallout, Mozilla said that many modified words were to ease readability, increase transparency, formalize existing implicit agreements, and describe the circumstances of a free browser, adding that the AI features are covered by a separate agreement. Days later, Mozilla changed the wording again, denying allegations that it sold user data, while saying that it already gathers some information from hideable advertisements as well as chatbot metadata when interacted with. While the pledge to never &quot;sell your personal data&quot; disappeared, this is amidst vague definitions of &quot;sell&quot; in law.

== Localizations ==
Firefox is a widely localized web browser. Mozilla uses the in-house Pontoon localization platform. The first official release in November 2004 was available in 24 different languages and for 28 locales. In 2019, Mozilla released Project Fluent a localization system that allows translators to be more flexible with their translation than to be constrained in one-to-one translation of strings. the supported versions of Firefox are available in 97 locales (88 languages).

== Platform availability ==
There are desktop versions of Firefox for Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux, while Firefox for Android is available for Android (formerly Firefox for mobile, it also ran on Maemo, MeeGo and Firefox OS) and Firefox for iOS is available for iOS. Smartphones that support Linux but not Android, or iOS apps can also run Firefox in its desktop version, for example using postmarketOS, Mobian or Ubuntu Touch.

Firefox source code may be compiled for various operating systems; however, officially distributed binaries are provided for the following:

=== Microsoft Windows ===

Firefox 1.0 was released for Windows 95, as well as Windows NT 4.0 or later. Some users reported the 1.x builds were operable (but not installable) on Windows NT 3.51.

The version 42.0 release includes the first x64 build. It required Windows 7 or Server 2008 R2. Starting from version 49.0, Firefox for Windows requires and uses the SSE2 instruction set.

In September 2013, Mozilla released a Metro-style version of Firefox, optimized for touchscreen use, on the &quot;Aurora&quot; release channel. However, on March 14, 2014, Mozilla cancelled the project because of a lack of user adoption.

In March 2017, Firefox 52 ESR, the last version of the browser for Windows XP and Windows Vista, was released. Support for Firefox 52 ESR ended in June 2018.

Traditionally, installing the Windows version of Firefox entails visiting the Firefox website and downloading an installer package, depending on the desired localization and system architecture. In November 2021, Mozilla made Firefox available on Microsoft Store. The Store-distributed package does not interfere with the traditional installation.

The last version of Firefox for Windows 7 and 8 is Firefox 115 ESR, which was released in July 2023. Its end-of-life was initially planned to be in October 2024, however in July 2024, a Mozilla employee announced in a comment on Reddit that the company consider extending the support beyond the initial date, the duration of that extension being yet to be defined. In September 2024, the extension was announced for an initial period of six months. In another Reddit comment, another Mozilla employee said that despite the extension &quot;isn&#x27;t going to be free [for Mozilla]&quot;, there was enough users to justify extending the support. In the release calendar page, a note states that Mozilla will re-evaluate the situation in early 2025 to see if another extension will be needed or not and statute about 115 ESR end-of-life then. This extension has been renewed one more time, on February 18, 2025, for 6 additional months, which lead the end-of-life date on par with the 128 ESR branch, in September 2025.

=== macOS ===

The first official release (Firefox version 1.0) supported macOS (then called Mac OS X) on the PowerPC architecture. Mac OS X builds for the IA-32 architecture became available via a universal binary which debuted with Firefox 1.5.0.2 in 2006.

Starting with version 4.0, Firefox was released for the x64 architecture to which macOS had migrated. Version 4.0 also dropped support for PowerPC architecture, although other projects continued development of a PowerPC version of Firefox.

Firefox was originally released for Mac OS X 10.0 and higher. The minimum OS then increased to Mac OS X 10.2 in Firefox 1.5 and 10.4 in Firefox 3. Firefox 4 dropped support for Mac OS X 10.4 and PowerPC Macs, and Firefox 17 dropped support for Mac OS X 10.5 entirely. The system requirements were left unchanged until 2016, when Firefox 49 dropped support for Mac OS X 10.6–10.8. Mozilla ended support for OS X 10.9–10.11 in Firefox 79, with those users being supported on the Firefox 78 ESR branch until November 2021. Most recently, Mozilla ended support for macOS 10.12–10.14 in Firefox 116, with those users being supported on the Firefox 115 ESR branch until late 2024. In September 2024 however, an extension was announced for the 115 ESR branch for an initial period of six months. This extension has been renewed one more time, leading the end-of-life date to September 2025

=== Linux ===
Since its inception, Firefox for Linux supported the 32-bit memory architecture of the IA-32 instruction set. 64-bit builds were introduced in the 4.0 release. The 46.0 release replaced GTK 2.18 with 3.4 as a system requirement on Linux and other systems running X.Org. Starting with 53.0, the 32-bit builds require the SSE2 instruction set.

=== Firefox for Android ===
Firefox for mobile, code-named &quot;Fennec&quot;, was first released for Maemo in January 2010 with version 1.0 and for Android in March 2011 with version 4.0. Support for Maemo was discontinued after version 7, released in September 2011. Fennec had a user interface optimized for phones and tablets. It included the Awesome Bar, tabbed browsing, add-on support, a password manager, location-aware browsing, and the ability to synchronize with the user&#x27;s other devices with Mozilla Firefox using Firefox Sync. At the end of its existence, it had a market share of 0.5% on Android.

In August 2020, Mozilla launched a new version of its Firefox for Android app, named Firefox Daylight to the public and codenamed Fenix, after a little over a year of testing. It boasted higher speeds with its new GeckoView engine, which is described as being &quot;the only independent web engine browser available on Android&quot;. It also added Enhanced Tracking Protection 2.0, a feature that blocks many known trackers on the Internet. It also added the ability to place the address bar on the bottom, and a new Collections feature. However, it was criticized for only having nine Add-ons at launch, and missing certain features. In response, Mozilla stated that they will allow more Add-ons with time.

=== Firefox for iOS ===
Mozilla initially refused to port Firefox to iOS, due to the restrictions Apple imposed on third-party iOS browsers. Instead of releasing a full version of the Firefox browser, Mozilla released Firefox Home, a companion app for the iPhone and iPod Touch based on the Firefox Sync technology, which allowed users to access their Firefox browsing history, bookmarks, and recent tabs. It also included Firefox&#x27;s &quot;Awesomebar&quot; location bar. Firefox Home was not a web browser, the application launched web pages in either an embedded viewer for that one page, or by opening the page in the Safari app. Mozilla pulled Firefox Home from the App Store in September 2012, stating it would focus its resources on other projects. The company subsequently released the source code of Firefox Home&#x27;s underlying synchronization software.

In April 2013, then-Mozilla CEO Gary Kovacs said that Firefox would not come to iOS if Apple required the use of the WebKit layout engine to do so. One reason given by Mozilla was that prior to iOS 8, Apple had supplied third-party browsers with an inferior version of their JavaScript engine which hobbled their performance, making it impossible to match Safari&#x27;s JavaScript performance on the iOS platform. Apple later opened their &quot;Nitro&quot; JavaScript engine to third-party browsers. In 2015, Mozilla announced it was moving forward with Firefox for iOS, with a preview release made available in New Zealand in September of that year. It was fully released in November later that year. It is the first Firefox-branded browser not to use the Gecko layout engine as is used in Firefox for desktop and mobile. Apple&#x27;s policies require all iOS apps that browse the web to use the built-in WebKit rendering framework and WebKit JavaScript, so using Gecko is not possible. Unlike Firefox on Android, Firefox for iOS does not support browser add-ons.

In November 2016, Firefox released a new iOS app titled Firefox Focus, a private web browser.

=== Firefox Reality (AR/VR) ===
Firefox Reality was released for Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality headsets in September 2018. It supports traditional web-browsing through 2D windows and immersive VR pages through Web VR. Firefox Reality is available on HTC Vive, Oculus, Google Daydream and Microsoft Hololens headsets. In February 2022 Mozilla announced that Igalia took over stewardship of this project under the new name of Wolvic.

=== Third-party ports ===
Firefox has also been ported to FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, OpenIndiana, OS/2, ArcaOS, SkyOS, RISC OS and BeOS/Haiku, and an unofficial rebranded version called Timberwolf has been available for AmigaOS 4. An unofficial continuation of the Mac OS X PowerPC release was actively developed as TenFourFox until October 5, 2021. In 2024 a fork of TenFourFox called Aquafox was released which is getting new updates

A Port of Newer Firefox for Windows 7/8 And later Vista named Redfox Came out in 2024

The Firefox port for OpenBSD is maintained by Landry Breuil since 2010. Firefox is regularly built for the current branch of the operating system, the latest versions are packaged for each release and remain frozen until the next release. In 2017, Landry began hosting packages of newer Firefox versions for OpenBSD releases from 6.0 onwards, making them available to installations without the ports system.

The Solaris 10 port of Firefox (including OpenSolaris) was maintained by the Oracle Solaris Desktop Beijing Team, until March 2018 when the team was disbanded A new team Has been porting firefox to Solaris 11 Since 2011 . There was also an unofficial port of Firefox 3.6.x to IBM AIX and of v1.7.x to UnixWare.

== Channels and release schedule ==
In March 2011, Mozilla presented plans to switch to the rapid release model, a faster 16-week development cycle, similar to Google Chrome. &quot;Ars Technica&quot; noted that this new cycle entailed &quot;significant technical and operational challenges&quot; for Mozilla (notably preserving third-party add-on compatibility), but that it would help accelerate Firefox&#x27;s adoption of new web standards, feature, and performance improvements. This plan was implemented in April 2011. The release process was split into four &quot;channels&quot;, with major releases trickling down to the next channel every six to eight weeks. For example, the Nightly channel would feature a preliminary unstable version of Firefox 6, which would move to the experimental &quot;Aurora&quot; channel after preliminary testing, then to the more stable &quot;beta&quot; channel, before finally reaching the public release channel, with each stage taking around six weeks. For corporations, Mozilla introduced an Extended Support Release (ESR) channel, with new versions released every 30 weeks (and supported for 12 more weeks after a new ESR version is released), though Mozilla warned that it would be less secure than the release channel, since security patches would only be backported for high-impact vulnerabilities.

In 2017, Mozilla abandoned the Aurora channel, which saw low uptake, and rebased Firefox Developer Edition onto the beta channel. Mozilla uses A/B testing and a staged rollout mechanism for the release channel, where updates are first presented to a small fraction of users, with Mozilla monitoring its telemetry for increased crashes or other issues before the update is made available to all users. In 2020, Firefox moved to a four-week release cycle, to catch up with Chrome in support for new web features. Chrome switched to a four-week cycle a year later.

== Licensing ==
Firefox source code is free software, with most of it being released under the Mozilla Public License (MPL) version 2.0. This license permits anyone to view, modify, or redistribute the source code. As a result, several publicly released applications have been built from it, including Firefox&#x27;s predecessor Netscape, the customizable Pale Moon, and the privacy focused Tor Browser.

In the past, Firefox was licensed solely under the MPL, then version 1.1, which the Free Software Foundation criticized for being weak copyleft, as the license permitted, in limited ways, proprietary derivative works. Additionally, code only licensed under MPL 1.1 could not legally be linked with code under the GPL. To address these concerns, Mozilla re-licensed most of Firefox under the tri-license scheme of MPL 1.1, GPL 2.0, or LGPL 2.1. Since the re-licensing, developers were free to choose the license under which they received most of the code, to suit their intended use: GPL or LGPL linking and derivative works when one of those licenses is chosen, or MPL use (including the possibility of proprietary derivative works) if they chose the MPL. However, on January 3, 2012, Mozilla released the GPL-compatible MPL 2.0, and with the release of Firefox 13 on June 5, 2012, Mozilla used it to replace the tri-licensing scheme.

== Trademark and logo ==
The name &quot;Mozilla Firefox&quot; is a registered trademark of Mozilla; along with the official Firefox logo, it may only be used under certain terms and conditions. Anyone may redistribute the official binaries in unmodified form and use the Firefox name and branding for such distribution, but restrictions are placed on distributions which modify the underlying source code. The name &quot;Firefox&quot; derives from a nickname of the red panda. Mozilla celebrated Red Pandas.

Mozilla has placed the Firefox logo files under open-source licenses, but its trademark guidelines do not allow displaying altered or similar logos in contexts where trademark law applies.
There has been some controversy over the Mozilla Foundation&#x27;s intentions in stopping certain open-source distributions from using the &quot;Firefox&quot; trademark. Open-source browsers &quot;enable greater choice and innovation in the market rather than aiming for mass-market domination.&quot; Mozilla Foundation Chairperson Mitchell Baker explained in an interview in 2007 that distributions could freely use the Firefox trademark if they did not modify source code, and that the Mozilla Foundation&#x27;s only concern was with users getting a consistent experience when they used &quot;Firefox&quot;.

To allow distributions of the code &quot;without&quot; using the official branding, the Firefox build system contains a &quot;branding switch&quot;. This switch, often used for alphas (&quot;Auroras&quot;) of future Firefox versions, allows the code to be compiled without the official logo and name and can allow a derivative work unencumbered by restrictions on the Firefox trademark to be produced. In the unbranded build, the trademarked logo and name are replaced with a freely distributable generic globe logo and the name of the release series from which the modified version was derived.

Distributing modified versions of Firefox under the &quot;Firefox&quot; name required explicit approval from Mozilla for the changes made to the underlying code, and required the use of &quot;all&quot; of the official branding. For example, it was not permissible to use the name &quot;Firefox&quot; without also using the official logo. When the Debian project decided to stop using the official Firefox logo in 2006 (because Mozilla&#x27;s copyright restrictions at the time were incompatible with Debian&#x27;s guidelines), they were told by a representative of the Mozilla Foundation that this was not acceptable and was asked either to comply with the published trademark guidelines or cease using the &quot;Firefox&quot; name in their distribution. Debian switched to branding their modified version of Firefox &quot;Iceweasel&quot; (but in 2016 switched back to Firefox), along with other Mozilla software. GNU IceCat is another derived version of Firefox distributed by the GNU Project, which maintains its separate branding.

=== Branding and visual identity ===

The Firefox icon is a trademark used to designate the official Mozilla build of the Firefox software and builds of official distribution partners. For this reason, software distributors who distribute modified versions of Firefox do not use the icon.

Early Firebird and Phoenix releases of Firefox were considered to have reasonable visual designs but fell short when compared to many other professional software packages. In October 2003, professional interface designer Steven Garrity authored an article covering everything he considered to be wrong with Mozilla&#x27;s visual identity.

Shortly afterwards, the Mozilla Foundation invited Garrity to head up the new visual identity team. The release of Firefox 0.8 in February 2004 saw the introduction of the new branding efforts. Included were new icon designs by silverorange, a group of web developers with a long-standing relationship with Mozilla. The final renderings are by Jon Hicks, who had worked on Camino. The logo was later revised and updated, fixing several flaws found when it was enlarged. The animal shown in the logo is a stylized fox, although &quot;firefox&quot; is usually a common name for the red panda. The panda, according to Hicks, &quot;didn&#x27;t really conjure up the right imagery&quot; and was not widely known.

In June 2019, Mozilla unveiled a revised Firefox logo, which was officially implemented on version 70. The new logo is part of an effort to build a brand system around Firefox and its complementary apps and services, which are now being promoted as a suite under the Firefox brand.

== Promotion ==
Firefox was adopted rapidly, with 100 million downloads in its first year of availability. This was followed by a series of aggressive marketing campaigns starting in 2004 with a series of events Blake Ross and Asa Dotzler called &quot;marketing weeks&quot;.

Firefox continued to heavily market itself by releasing a marketing portal dubbed &quot;Spread Firefox&quot; (SFX) on September 12, 2004. It debuted along with the Firefox Preview Release, creating a centralized space for the discussion of various marketing techniques. The release of their manifesto stated that &quot;the Mozilla project is a global community of people who believe that openness, innovation and opportunity are key to the continued health of the Internet.&quot; A two-page ad in the edition of December 16 of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, placed by Mozilla Foundation in coordination with Spread Firefox, featured the names of the thousands of people worldwide who contributed to the Mozilla Foundation&#x27;s fundraising campaign to support the launch of the Firefox 1.0 web browser. SFX portal enhanced the &quot;Get Firefox&quot; button program, giving users &quot;referrer points&quot; as an incentive. The site lists the top 250 referrers. From time to time, the SFX team or SFX members launch marketing events organized at the Spread Firefox website. As a part of the Spread Firefox campaign, there was an attempt to break the world download record with the release of Firefox 3. This resulted in an official certified Guinness world record, with over eight million downloads. In February 2011, Mozilla announced that it would be retiring Spread Firefox (SFX). Three months later, in May 2011, Mozilla officially closed Spread Firefox. Mozilla wrote that &quot;there are currently plans to create a new iteration of this website [Spread Firefox] at a later date.&quot;

In celebration of the third anniversary of the founding of the Mozilla Foundation, the &quot;World Firefox Day&quot; campaign was established on July 15, 2006, and ran until September 15, 2006. Participants registered themselves and a friend on the website for nomination to have their names displayed on the Firefox Friends Wall, a digital wall that was displayed at the headquarters of the Mozilla Foundation.

The Firefox community has also engaged in the promotion of their web browser. In 2006, some of Firefox&#x27;s contributors from Oregon State University made a crop circle of the Firefox logo in an oat field near Amity, Oregon, near the intersection of Lafayette Highway and Walnut Hill Road. After Firefox reached 500 million downloads on February 21, 2008, the Firefox community celebrated by visiting Freerice to earn 500 million grains of rice.

Other initiatives included Live Chat – a service Mozilla launched in 2007 that allowed users to seek technical support from volunteers. The service was later retired.

To promote the launch of Firefox Quantum in November 2017, Mozilla partnered with Reggie Watts to produce a series of TV ads and social media content.

== Performance ==
=== 2000s ===
In December 2005, &quot;Internet Week&quot; ran an article in which many readers reported high memory usage in Firefox 1.5. Mozilla developers said that the higher memory use of Firefox 1.5 was at least partially due to the new fast backwards-and-forwards (FastBack) feature. Other known causes of memory problems were malfunctioning extensions such as Google Toolbar and some older versions of AdBlock, or plug-ins, such as older versions of Adobe Acrobat Reader. When &quot;PC Magazine&quot; in 2006 compared memory usage of Firefox 2, Opera 9, and Internet Explorer 7, they found that Firefox used approximately as much memory as each of the other two browsers.

In 2006, Softpedia noted that Firefox 1.5 took longer to start up than other browsers, which was confirmed by further speed tests.

Internet Explorer 6 launched more swiftly than Firefox 1.5 on Windows XP since many of its components were built into the OS and loaded during system startup. As a workaround for the issue, a preloader application was created that loaded components of Firefox on startup, similar to Internet Explorer. A Windows Vista feature called SuperFetch performs a similar task of preloading Firefox if it is used often enough.

Tests performed by &quot;PC World&quot; and Zimbra in 2006 indicated that Firefox 2 used less memory than Internet Explorer 7. Firefox 3 used less memory than Internet Explorer 7, Opera 9.50 Beta, Safari 3.1 Beta, and Firefox 2 in tests performed by Mozilla, CyberNet, and The Browser World. In mid-2009, BetaNews benchmarked Firefox 3.5 and declared that it performed &quot;nearly ten times better on XP than Microsoft Internet Explorer 7&quot;.

=== 2010s ===
In January 2010, Lifehacker compared the performance of Firefox 3.5, Firefox 3.6, Google Chrome 4 (stable and Dev versions), Safari 4, and Opera (10.1 stable and 10.5 pre-alpha versions). Lifehacker timed how long browsers took to start and reach a page (both right after boot-up and after running at least once already), timed how long browsers took to load nine tabs at once, tested JavaScript speeds using Mozilla&#x27;s Dromaeo online suite (which implements Apple&#x27;s SunSpider and Google&#x27;s V8 tests) and measured memory usage using Windows 7&#x27;s process manager. They concluded that Firefox 3.5 and 3.6 were the fifth- and sixth-fastest browsers, respectively, on startup, 3.5 was third- and 3.6 was sixth-fastest to load nine tabs at once, 3.5 was sixth- and 3.6 was fifth-fastest on the JavaScript tests. They also concluded that Firefox 3.6 was the most efficient with memory usage followed by Firefox 3.5.

In February 2012, &quot;Tom&#x27;s Hardware&quot; performance tested Chrome 17, Firefox 10, Internet Explorer 9, Opera 11.61, and Safari 5.1.2 on Windows 7. &quot;Tom&#x27;s Hardware&quot; summarized their tests into four categories: Performance, Efficiency, Reliability, and Conformance. In the performance category they tested HTML5, Java, JavaScript, DOM, CSS 3, Flash, Silverlight, and WebGL (WebGL 2 is current as of version 51; and Java and Silverlight stop working as of version 52)—they also tested startup time and page load time. The performance tests showed that Firefox was either &quot;acceptable&quot; or &quot;strong&quot; in most categories, winning three categories (HTML5, HTML5 hardware acceleration, and Java) only finishing &quot;weak&quot; in CSS performance. In the efficiency tests, &quot;Tom&#x27;s Hardware&quot; tested memory usage and management. With this category, it determined that Firefox was only &quot;acceptable&quot; at performing light memory usage, while it was &quot;strong&quot; at performing heavy memory usage. In the reliability category, Firefox performed a &quot;strong&quot; amount of proper page loads. For the final category, conformance, it was determined that Firefox had &quot;strong&quot; conformance for JavaScript and HTML5. So in conclusion, &quot;Tom&#x27;s Hardware&quot; determined that Firefox was the best browser for Windows 7 OS, but that it only narrowly beat Google Chrome.

In June 2013, &quot;Tom&#x27;s Hardware&quot; again performance tested Firefox 22, Chrome 27, Opera 12, and Internet Explorer 10. They found that Firefox slightly edged out the other browsers in their &quot;performance&quot; index, which examined wait times, JavaScript execution speed, HTML5/CSS3 rendering, and hardware acceleration performance. Firefox also scored the highest on the &quot;non-performance&quot; index, which measured memory efficiency, reliability, security, and standards conformance, finishing ahead of Chrome, the runner-up. &quot;Tom&#x27;s Hardware&quot; concluded by declaring Firefox the &quot;sound&quot; winner of the performance benchmarks.

In January 2014, a benchmark testing the memory usage of Firefox 29, Google Chrome 34, and Internet Explorer 11 indicated that Firefox used the least memory when a substantial number of tabs were open.

In benchmark testing in early 2015 on a &quot;high-end&quot; Windows machine, comparing Microsoft Edge [Legacy], Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, and Opera, Firefox achieved the highest score on three of the seven tests. Four different JavaScript performance tests gave conflicting results. Firefox surpassed all other browsers on the Peacekeeper benchmark, but was behind the Microsoft products when tested with SunSpider. Measured with Mozilla&#x27;s Kraken, it came second place to Chrome, while on Google&#x27;s Octane challenge it took third behind Chrome and Opera. Firefox took the lead with WebXPRT, which runs several typical HTML5 and JavaScript tasks. Firefox, Chrome, and Opera all achieved the highest possible score on the Oort Online test, measuring WebGL rendering speed (WebGL 2 is now current). In terms of HTML5 compatibility testing, Firefox was ranked in the middle of the group.

A similar set of benchmark tests in 2016 showed Firefox&#x27;s JavaScript performance on Kraken and the newer Jetstream tests trailing slightly behind all other tested browsers except Internet Explorer (IE), which performed relatively poorly. On Octane, Firefox came ahead of IE and Safari, but again slightly behind the rest, including Vivaldi and Microsoft Edge [Legacy]. Edge [Legacy] took overall first place on the Jetstream and Octane benchmarks.

=== Firefox Quantum ===
As of the adoption of Firefox 57 and Mozilla&#x27;s Quantum project entering production browsers in November 2017, Firefox was tested to be faster than Chrome in independent JavaScript tests, and demonstrated to use less memory with many browser tabs opened. &quot;TechRadar&quot; rated it as the fastest web browser in a May 2019 report.

== Usage share ==

Downloads have continued at an increasing rate since Firefox 1.0 was released, and Firefox had already been downloaded over one billion times. This number does not include downloads using software updates or those from third-party websites. They do not represent a user count, as one download may be installed on many machines, one person may download the software multiple times, or the software may be obtained from a third-party.

In July 2010, IBM asked all employees (about 400,000) to use Firefox as their default browser.

Firefox was the second-most used web browser until November 2011, when Google Chrome surpassed it. According to Mozilla, Firefox had more than 450 million users .

In October 2024, Firefox was the fourth-most widely used desktop browser, and it was the fourth-most popular with 2.95% of worldwide usage share of web browsers across all platforms. 

According to the Firefox Public Data report by Mozilla, the active monthly count of Desktop clients has decreased from around 310 million in 2017 to 200 million in 2023.
From Oct 2020, the desktop market share of Firefox started to decline in countries where it used to be the most popular.
In Eritrea, it dropped from 50% in Oct 2020 to 9.32% in Sept 2021.
In Cuba, it dropped from 54.36% in Sept 2020 to 38.42% in Sept 2021.

The UK and US governments both follow the 2% rule. This states that only browsers with more than 2% market share among visitors of their websites will be supported. There are concerns that support for Firefox will be dropped because as of December 29, 2023, the browser market share among US government website visitors is 2.2%.

<text>Maggie Reilly (born 15 September 1956) is a Scottish singer best known for her collaborations with the composer and instrumentalist Mike Oldfield. Most notably, she performed lead vocals on the Oldfield songs &quot;Family Man&quot;, &quot;Moonlight Shadow&quot;, &quot;To France&quot;, and &quot;Foreign Affair&quot;, all of which were international hits in the early 1980s.

== Career ==

Reilly first came to prominence as a member of the 1970s soul outfit Cado Belle (previously named Joe Cool) and released one album with them in 1976.

She is best known for her collaborations with the composer Mike Oldfield between 1980 and 1984, especially by co-writing and performing the vocals on &quot;Family Man&quot; (from the album &quot;Five Miles Out&quot;), &quot;Moonlight Shadow&quot;, &quot;Foreign Affair&quot; (from the album Crises) and &quot;To France&quot; (from the album &quot;Discovery&quot;).

In 1992 Reilly released her debut solo album &quot;Echoes&quot;, from which the singles &quot;Everytime We Touch&quot;, &quot;Tears in the Rain&quot; and &quot;Wait&quot; were the most successful. A series of solo albums were released over the next 27 years.

She has also worked with many other artists, including Mike Batt (on his &quot;Hunting of the Snark&quot; album), Jack Bruce, Dave Greenfield &amp; Jean-Jacques Burnel, Nick Mason &amp; Rick Fenn, Michael Cretu, Lesiëm, Ralph McTell, Simon Nicol of Fairport Convention, Stefan Zauner of Münchener Freiheit, Runrig, Taco Ockerse, The Sisters of Mercy, and Smokie. &quot;Moonlight Shadow 2k14&quot; (Michael Fall remix) was released on 23 May 2014 on the German label ZYX Music.

<doc id="210897" wikidata="Q2078515" url="?curid=210897" title="Appeal of 18 June">
<text>The Appeal of 18 June () was the first speech made by Charles de Gaulle after his arrival in London in 1940 following the Battle of France. Broadcast to France by the radio services of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), it is often considered to have marked the beginning of the French Resistance in World War II. It is regarded as one of the most important speeches in French history. In spite of its significance in French collective memory, historians have shown that the appeal was heard only by a minority of French people. De Gaulle&#x27;s 22 June 1940 speech was more widely heard. The historic importance of these radio broadcasts and de Gaulle&#x27;s future status as the emblem of the French resistance gave de Gaulle the nickname &quot;&quot; (&quot;The Man of 18 June&quot;).

==Context==
De Gaulle had recently been promoted to the rank of brigadier general and named as under-secretary of state for national defence and war by Prime Minister Paul Reynaud during the German invasion of France. Reynaud resigned after his proposal for a Franco-British Union was rejected by his cabinet and Marshal Philippe Pétain, a hero of World War I, became the new prime minister, pledging to sign an armistice with Nazi Germany. De Gaulle opposed any such action and, facing imminent arrest, fled France on 17 June. Other leading politicians, including Georges Mandel, Léon Blum, Pierre Mendès France, Jean Zay and Édouard Daladier (and separately Reynaud), were arrested while travelling to continue the war from North Africa.

De Gaulle arrived in London on the afternoon of 17 June and met with Winston Churchill. The British prime minister had a good opinion of de Gaulle from their three previous meetings, and gave permission to make a speech to France. De Gaulle finished his speech on the morning of 18 June, but did not know that the British government almost revoked permission. London hoped to persuade the Pétain government in Bordeaux to send the French Navy away from German use, and individual French politicians to leave France, so worried about a speech criticizing the French government. Having sent three separate simultaneous delegations to Bordeaux, it decided that the speech would not confuse things further.

Ignorant of the British debate over his speech, de Gaulle arrived at the BBC at 6 pm BST to record the four-minute speech. After final permission arrived at 8 pm, the speech was broadcast at 10 pm BST (8 pm in Paris) on BBC Radio from Broadcasting House over France. BBC repeated the broadcast four more times the next day.

De Gaulle&#x27;s speech stated that superior German arms and tactics had defeated the French military. The defeat was not complete because France still had its colonies, the British Empire as its ally, and help from the United States; this was a world war in which the Battle of France was one part. De Gaulle invited French soldiers and civilians to contact him.

==Translation of the speech==

==Reception and influence==

After the war, de Gaulle&#x27;s 18 June broadcast was often identified as the beginning of the French Resistance, and the beginning of the process of liberating France from the yoke of German occupation. The speech began de Gaulle&#x27;s entire future career, what he later described as his &quot;legitimacy&quot;. He was the first French public figure to oppose an armistice with Germany, and the speech gave reasons why continuing to fight the war was not hopeless.

Although the 18 June speech is among the most famous in French history, few French listeners heard it; most accounts of having heard it are false memories. It was broadcast on the BBC, a British radio station, which did not retain the unimportant recording. The broadcast, practically unannounced, was by an obscure brigadier general who had only recently been appointed as a junior minister. Consequently, of the 10,000 French citizens in Britain, only 300 volunteered. Of the more than 100,000 soldiers temporarily on British soil, most of them recently evacuated from Norway or Dunkirk, only 7,000 stayed on to join de Gaulle. The rest returned to France and were quickly made prisoners of war. However, de Gaulle&#x27;s speech was undeniably influential and provided motivation for the people of France and for the oppressed people of the rest of Europe.

The French and Swiss governments recorded the speech as broadcast in written form. The Swiss published the text for their own uses on 19 June. The manuscript of the speech, as well as the recording of the 22 June speech, were nominated on 18 June 2005 for inclusion in UNESCO&#x27;s Memory of the World Register by the BBC, which called it &quot;one of the most remarkable pieces in the history of radio broadcasting&quot;.

The themes of the speech would be reused throughout the war to inspire the French people to resist German occupation. Four days later, de Gaulle delivered a speech that largely reiterated the points made in his 18 June speech, and the second speech was heard by a larger audience in France. The content of the 22 June speech is often confused for that of 18 June. In addition, in early August a poster written by de Gaulle would be distributed widely in London and would become known as &quot;&quot; (The London Poster). Variations of this poster would be produced and displayed in Africa, South America and France itself over the course of the war.

The 70th anniversary of the speech was marked in 2010 by the issuing of a postage stamp (designed by Georges Mathieu) and a €2 commemorative coin.

In 2023, &quot;&quot; commissioned a recreation of the speech using artificial intelligence to replicate de Gaulle&#x27;s voice, using a German-language transcription of the speech in Swiss military archives to find the French record of the speech closest to the original and recording a reading of the speech by François Morel as &quot;base audio&quot; to be modified by vocal synthesis to be closer to de Gaulle&#x27;s voice.

==&quot;France has lost a battle, but has not lost the war&quot;==

De Gaulle&#x27;s famous quote: &quot;&quot; (&quot;France has lost a battle, but France has not lost the war&quot;) is often associated with the Appeal of 18 June. While the Appeal&#x27;s themes are consistent with the quote, it is from a motivational poster featuring de Gaulle, &quot;&quot;, which was distributed all over London on 3 August 1940.

<text>The solar luminosity () is a unit of radiant flux (power emitted in the form of photons) conventionally used by astronomers to measure the luminosity of stars, galaxies and other celestial objects in terms of the output of the Sun.

One nominal solar luminosity is defined by the International Astronomical Union to be . The Sun is a weakly variable star, and its actual luminosity therefore fluctuates. The major fluctuation is the eleven-year solar cycle (sunspot cycle) that causes a quasi-periodic variation of about ±0.1%. Other variations over the last 200–300 years are thought to be much smaller than this.

== Determination ==
Solar luminosity is related to solar irradiance (the solar constant). Slow changes in the axial tilt of the planet and the shape of its orbit cause cyclical changes to the solar irradiance. The result is orbital forcing that causes the Milankovitch cycles, which determine Earthly glacial cycles. The mean irradiance at the top of the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere is sometimes known as the solar constant, . Irradiance is defined as power per unit area, so the solar luminosity (total power emitted by the Sun) is the irradiance received at the Earth (solar constant) multiplied by the area of the sphere whose radius is the mean distance between the Earth and the Sun:
formula_1
where is the unit distance (the value of the astronomical unit in metres) and is a constant (whose value is very close to one) that reflects the fact that the mean distance from the Earth to the Sun is not exactly one astronomical unit.
