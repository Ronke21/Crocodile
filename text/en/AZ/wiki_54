<text>Toyah Ann Willcox (born 18 May 1958) is an English singer-songwriter, actress, and television presenter. In a career spanning more than 40 years, she has had eight top 40 singles, released over 20 albums, written two books, appeared in over 40 stage plays and 10 feature films, and voiced and presented numerous television shows.

Between 1977 and 1983, Willcox fronted the eponymous band Toyah, before embarking on a solo career in the mid-1980s. At the Brit Awards 1982, Willcox was nominated for British Breakthrough Act, and Best Female Solo Artist. She was nominated a further two times in this category in 1983, and in 1984. Her hit singles, which she co-wrote, include &quot;It&#x27;s a Mystery&quot;, &quot;Thunder in the Mountains&quot; and &quot;I Want to Be Free&quot;.

Willcox is married to English guitarist Robert Fripp.

==Early life==
Willcox was born on 18 May 1958 in Kings Heath, Birmingham. Her father Beric Willcox ran a successful joinery business and owned three factories. Her mother Barbara Joy, née Rollinson, was a professional dancer, with whom he had fallen in love after seeing her on stage in Weston-super-Mare with singing and comedy double act Flanagan and Allen, and married in 1949. Her mother gave up her career after giving birth to Willcox&#x27;s elder sister and brother. Willcox has suggested her first name could be in reference to Toyah in the US or to a Native American word &quot;toyah&quot; meaning &quot;water,&quot; although she notes her parents deny both origins.

Willcox enjoyed a financially comfortable childhood, attending a private girls&#x27; school, but was bullied. Requiring physiotherapy for a spinal condition, she behaved violently towards her mother, to whom she was close. An absentee pupil and frequently rebellious, she sat O-levels a year late, owing to corrective surgery on her feet. She achieved one O-level pass, in music. Alienated by her background and surroundings, her rebellious behaviour led to her shunning male company and adopting an aggressive and flamboyant identity.

Her early interest in music, dance and acting, combined with her alienation, and her uncertainty regarding her sexuality, led Willcox to seek an outlet, initially in acting and then in music. She attended the Old Rep Drama School in Birmingham, paying privately because she was denied a grant, the assessor noting: &quot;She has a lisp and isn&#x27;t attractive.&quot; She began working as a dresser in local theatres, including The Alexandra, Birmingham, and the Birmingham Hippodrome. Because of her distinctive appearance and gaudily dyed hair, repertory actors referred to her as &quot;The Bird of Paradise.&quot; A friend&#x27;s suggestion that she should see the Sex Pistols led to her being attracted to the punk movement, but she resolved to do better, travelling to London to take up a career in acting and music.

==Career==
===1976–1979: Career beginnings===
After appearing as an extra in a drama being made at the BBC Pebble Mill Studios in Birmingham, an opening came to take a role in &quot;Glitter&quot; (1976), a play in the BBC &quot;Second City Firsts&quot; series, alongside Noel Edmonds and Phil Daniels. Recommended to the play&#x27;s director by a member of the wardrobe department because of her distinctive appearance and oddball character, Willcox was given the role of Sue, a girl who sang with the band Bilbo and who dreamed of appearing on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. In the course of the 30-minute play, Willcox performed two songs she had co-written: &quot;Floating Free&quot; (an acoustic ballad, with Phil Daniels accompanying her on guitar) and &quot;Dream Maker&quot;. The play was seen by Kate Nelligan and Maximilian Schell, who offered her work with the National Theatre in London, where she got the part of Emma in &quot;Tales from the Vienna Woods&quot;, directed by Schell. The opening led to her relocating to London.

In 1977, while playing Emma in &quot;Tales from the Vienna Woods&quot; at the National Theatre, Willcox, inspired by her role as a musician in &quot;Glitter&quot;, fronted a band called Toyah which featured Joel Bogen on guitar, Mark Henry on bass, Steve Bray on drums, Peter Bush on keyboards, and herself on vocals. Having never considered herself a musician, she found herself lead singer of a successful band, although still uncertain about her own sexuality and repelled by her bandmates&#x27; antics with groupies.

Introduced by actor Ian Charleson to director Derek Jarman, Willcox was offered &#x27;any part you want&#x27; in &quot;Jubilee&quot; (called &quot;Down with the Queen&quot; at the time). Plagued by budgetary issues, the film featured Willcox as the murderous &#x27;Mad&#x27;, as well as a number of other prominent figures from the punk scene, including Siouxsie Sioux, Adam Ant and Richard O’Brien. She went on to play &#x27;Monkey&#x27; in the 1979 film of The Who&#x27;s &quot;Quadrophenia,&quot; having been introduced to director Franc Roddam through an association with John Lydon. Willcox demanded the part of Monkey from Roddam. She completed filming despite requiring medical attention for pneumonia.

The possibility of a role in the Sex Pistols&#x27; film, &quot;The Great Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Swindle&quot; under director Russ Meyer having fallen through, Willcox went on to play Miranda in Jarman&#x27;s film &quot;The Tempest&quot; which won her a nomination as Best Newcomer at the 1980 &quot;Evening Standard&quot; Awards. Continuing a stage career alongside film work, in 1979, on London&#x27;s Royal Court Theatre stage, Willcox played Sharon in Nigel Williams&#x27; &quot;Sugar and Spice&quot;, Tallulah in Stephen Poliakoff&#x27;s &quot;American Days&quot; at the ICA, playing alongside Mel Smith, Antony Sher and Phil Daniels and taking a film role opposite Katharine Hepburn in the made-for-television film &quot;The Corn Is Green&quot;, directed by George Cukor.

Willcox found her dual careers as a musician and actress frequently in conflict, leading to confusion as to which role constituted a &#x27;compartment&#x27; to put her into. Feeling her musical career was not taken as seriously as her acting, she nevertheless viewed her acting role as &#x27;highbrow&#x27; and her musical career as &#x27;lowbrow&#x27;.

===1980–1983: Toyah and gaining punk status===

In London, Willcox lived in a place called &quot;Mayhem&quot;, a converted British Rail warehouse serving as a studio. It was here the band Toyah recorded their first demos. For the lack of proper bed she slept for a while in a &quot;second-hand&quot; coffin, reportedly used by the French Red Cross to transport victims of fatal accidents. Citing her role in &quot;Quadrophenia&quot; as a boost to her musical career, with growing audiences Toyah signed to Safari Records, releasing a debut single &quot;Victims of the Riddle&quot;, which topped the UK Indie Chart. This was followed by the &quot;Sheep Farming in Barnet&quot; EP, produced by Steve James and Keith Hale. Initially released in Germany, in 1979 it was re-released as an LP, comprising the original six tracks, &quot;Victims of the Riddle&quot; A and B sides and three tracks that were previously unavailable on vinyl. Willcox&#x27;s second album, &quot;The Blue Meaning&quot;, went to no. 40 in the UK Albums Chart in June 1980. By this time, she is reported as announcing she had severed all ties with punk aesthetics.

In January 1981, the live album &quot;Toyah! Toyah! Toyah!&quot;, recorded at the Lafayette Club in Wolverhampton the previous June, made it to the Top 30, backed up by a TV documentary &quot;Toyah&quot;. By now the original band had broken up and a new lineup was in place, consisting of Phil Spalding, Nigel Glockler and Adrian Lee, only Joel Bogen and Willcox remaining. 1981 saw Willcox&#x27;s strengthened presence in the UK chart with hits such as &quot;Four from Toyah&quot; EP (no. 4, February 1981, including &quot;It&#x27;s a Mystery&quot;), the third studio album &quot;Anthem&quot; that went to no. 2 in May 1981, to be later certified platinum, &quot;I Want to Be Free&quot; (no. 8, June 1981), &quot;Thunder in the Mountains&quot; (no. 4, October 1981) and &quot;Four More from Toyah&quot; EP (no. 14, November 1981). She became one of the first acts to score regularly in the UK Singles Chart with EPs, which were also successful on an international level. At the end of the year Willcox won the &quot;Smash Hits&quot;&#x27; reader&#x27;s poll in two categories: Best Female Singer and Most Fanciable Female (beating Kim Wilde to the second place). In 1981 she alone, according to Safari, sold in the UK more units than the whole of the Warner Bros. put together.

In 1982, &quot;The Changeling&quot; album was released, produced by Steve Lillywhite, marking a turn for a more goth-tinged sound, it went up to no. 6 in the UK. &quot;The Changeling&quot; was followed in the same year by a double live album &quot;Warrior Rock: Toyah on Tour&quot;. Also in 1982, Willcox appeared in &quot;Urgh! A Music War&quot;, a British film released in 1982 featuring performances by punk rock, new wave, and post-punk acts, filmed in 1980, in which she performed &quot;Danced&quot;. Three more of her singles, &quot;Brave New World&quot;, &quot;Ieya&quot; and &quot;Be Proud Be Loud (Be Heard)&quot; charted in the Top 50 of the UK Singles Chart. At the Brit Awards 1982, Willcox was nominated for British Breakthrough Act, and Best Female Solo Artist.

The making of &quot;Love Is the Law&quot; (1983) was the happiest period of her life, according to Willcox, combining work in the critically acclaimed stage play &quot;Trafford Tanzi&quot; and the film &quot;The Ebony Tower&quot; with Laurence Olivier with work on the album. By this time, though, her popularity started to decline: the album reached no. 28 (with singles &quot;Rebel Run&quot; and &quot;The Vow&quot; peaking at no. 24 and no. 50 respectively), and with a 1984 greatest hits compilation, released by K-tel and called confusingly &quot;Toyah! Toyah! Toyah! All the Hits&quot;, failing to chart.

===1984–1990: Solo career and acting work===
Willcox disbanded her group in 1983, and signed a recording contract with Portrait Records, and, in 1985, released the solo studio album &quot;Minx&quot;, which contained several cover versions including Alice Cooper&#x27;s &quot;School&#x27;s Out&quot;, as well as her own hit, &quot;Don&#x27;t Fall in Love (I Said)&quot;.
Willcox secretly married British guitarist Robert Fripp, founding member of King Crimson, in Witchampton, Dorset on his 40th birthday (16 May 1986). Together they formed a new band, called Fripp Fripp on the initial tours, later changing its name to Sunday All Over the World, which released the critically acclaimed album &quot;Kneeling at the Shrine&quot; (1991). She referred to Fripp as her &#x27;soulmate&#x27;. That same year, she also sang lead vocals on the track &quot;Lion of Symmetry&quot; by Tony Banks of Genesis.

Her next solo studio album &quot;Desire&quot; (1987) was less successful although the single with her version of &quot;Echo Beach&quot; made it to the Top 50. Then in 1988 &quot;Prostitute&quot; came out, an album through which Willcox vented her frustrations which started to accumulate as a result of having made the transformation &quot;from all-powerful artist to invisible woman&quot; in the course of just one year of marriage. This experimental concept album, marking a considerable divergence from previous works, was released on E.G. Records. The attitude to &quot;Prostitute&quot;, according to Willcox, in the UK and the US was radically different: &quot;In the UK, when my management tried to sell it to the music reps, an awful lot got up and walked out of meetings; all male I hasten to add. In America, &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine said it was the dawning of a new era for me as a producer and that it was an antidote to Madonna. I started to receive mail from professors at eminent universities telling me they played the album at their lectures as an example of the new way of thinking coming from contemporary women.&quot; She had many television roles, including series such as &quot;Quatermass&quot; (1979), &quot;Minder&quot; (1980), and the movie &quot;Quadrophenia&quot;. She starred opposite Laurence Olivier in &quot;The Ebony Tower&quot; (1984), and opposite the Who&#x27;s Roger Daltrey in &quot;&quot; (1984). She also appeared on &quot;Kavanagh QC&quot;. During the late 1980s and 1990s, Willcox forged ahead with a career as a stage performer. Notable credits include &quot;Trafford Tanzi&quot; (at the Mermaid Theatre, leading role), &quot;Cabaret&quot; (Sally Bowles), &quot;Three Men on a Horse&quot; (winner of an Laurence Olivier Awards for Best New Comedy), and the UK tour of Arthur Smith&#x27;s &quot;Live Bed Show&quot;. In 1990, she played Costanza in the national tour of Amadeus.

===1991–1999: Presenting work and further albums===
Although she had presented the magazine series &quot;Look! Hear!&quot; for BBC Birmingham between 1979 and 1981, it was in the 1990s that Willcox&#x27;s career as a TV presenter took off. She began by presenting arts programmes &quot;First Night&quot; and &quot;Time Off&quot; in 1993. By the mid to late 1990s, she could be seen presenting items on shows such as &quot;Watchdog:healthcheck&quot;, &quot;This Morning&quot; and &quot;The Heaven and Earth Show.&quot; She also worked on VH1 for three years, presenting &quot;Toyah and Toyah&quot; and &quot;Chase&quot; for the cable music station. Viewers could accompany Willcox to various locations worldwide during her tenure as a reporter on BBC travel shows such as &quot;Holiday&quot; and &quot;Holiday- Fasten Your Seatbelts.&quot; Willcox&#x27;s husband Robert Fripp joined her on her studio album &quot;Ophelia&#x27;s Shadow&quot; (1991), which received good reviews. She released three more albums, &quot;Take the Leap!&quot; (1993), &quot;Dreamchild&quot; (1994), and &quot;Looking Back&quot; (1995). In 1996, she had the unique honour of simultaneously hosting both &quot;Songs of Praise&quot; on the BBC and &quot;Good Sex Guide Late&quot; on ITV. IThe same year, Willcox released &quot;The Acoustic Album&quot; on Aardvark Records, featuring strings from Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and produced by Oliver Davis. In 1999, she took the lead in the children&#x27;s television series &quot;Barmy Aunt Boomerang&quot;. She also provided the voices for the children&#x27;s television programmes &quot;Teletubbies&quot; and &quot;Brum&quot;.

===2000–2010: Television appearances and touring===

At the turn of the millennium, she continued to work on &quot;The Heaven and Earth Show&quot; as a newspaper reviewer and also presented a series of &quot;Whose Recipe Is It Anyway&quot; on the Carlton Food Network and 40 episodes of &quot;Beyond Medicine&quot; on the Discovery Health Channel. As the noughties progressed, she had stints presenting &quot;Head2Head&quot; and &quot;Destination Lunch&quot; on the Overseas Property TV channel, was a newspaper reviewer on Sky News, and hosted various music programmes for Vintage TV.

In 2001, Willcox was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Central England in recognition of her achievements in performing arts, media and broadcasting. The 2001 May issue of &quot;Q&quot; magazine named Willcox number 48 in their top 100 Greatest Women in Music poll, as voted for by readers of the magazine. She returned to music in 2002 with new material for a limited edition &quot;Little Tears of Love&quot; EP and a one-off preview concert at Ronnie Scott&#x27;s Jazz Club. The same year she sold out eleven stadium gigs for the Here and Now tour. She continued to perform with her band, releasing a mini-album &quot;Velvet Lined Shell&quot; in 2003 on her own record label, Vertical Species Records, showcasing a darker, edgier direction. Willcox also appeared on the BBC Radio 4 series &quot;The Further Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot;. In May 2003, Willcox was a contestant on the second series of the ITV survival reality show &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot;, and she was fourth to be eliminated. In June 2003, Willcox appeared on stage in London&#x27;s West End performing the title role of &quot;Calamity Jane&quot;, which was subsequently nominated for an &quot;Evening Standard&quot; Award for Best Musical at the Shaftesbury Theatre. In 2004, she performed as part of The Best of the 80s tour in the UK alongside Nick Heyward, Curiosity Killed the Cat and Altered Images. A live DVD followed in 2005, the year that also saw two parts of &quot;The Safari Records Singles Collection&quot; being issued. In February 2005, Willcox appeared on the fourth and final series of the Living TV programme, &quot;I&#x27;m Famous and Frightened!&quot;. Willcox was a guest vocalist in the anniversary concert of &quot;The Rocky Horror Show&quot; at the Royal Court Theatre in May 2006. In December 2006, she joined the radio drama series &quot;Silver Street&quot; on the BBC Asian Network as Siobhan Brady.

Between 2007 and 2008, Willcox had a recurring role as Gail Baxter in &quot;Secret Diary of a Call Girl&quot;, the mother of the title character played by Billie Piper. In May 2007, she collaborated with Bill Rieflin as the Humans for live dates in Estonia, having been invited by the Estonian president. According to &quot;The Northern Echo&quot;, that resulted &quot;from reading one of her husband&#x27;s emails&quot;. The invitation was for him to go but he was not keen, so Willcox accepted. The same year, Willcox was a guest presenter on &quot;Loose Women&quot;. Also in 2007, Willcox signed a new worldwide publishing deal with Zomba Music Group. She continued to write and record solo material with long-term collaborator Simon Darlow. On 29 October 2007, a new single &quot;Latex Messiah (Viva la Rebel in You)&quot;, came out, followed by the &quot;In the Court of the Crimson Queen&quot; album, written and produced in collaboration with Darlow and released by Willow Recordings Ltd on 15 September 2008. As part of Liverpool&#x27;s European Capital of Culture year, she performed for the first time ever at the newly opened Liverpool Echo Arena and Conference Centre.

In June 2008, Willcox appeared on &quot;Living with the Dead&quot; on Living TV to share her experiences of living in her haunted home. In July 2008, Willcox appeared on UK ITV1&#x27;s &quot;This Morning&quot; to discuss her role as a vampire in the rock musical &quot;Vampires Rock&quot;. She has also appeared in shows looking back on popular culture, including the &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity&quot; series, and various &#x27;Top 100 favourite&#x27; shows. Willcox played Queen Ivannah in &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; at the Lyceum in Sheffield for the 2009 Christmas season. In October 2009, she made a guest appearance in the BBC drama series &quot;Casualty&quot;. She also played the widow Fantine in Focus on the Family radio theatre&#x27;s version of &quot;Les Misérables&quot;. In 2009, a new version of &quot;Vampires Rock&quot; was created, called &quot;Vampires Rock Christmas&quot;, and Willcox was back in her role as the Killer Queen, alongside the writer and one of the stars of the show, Steve Steinman. Willcox continued to perform with The Humans, featuring Bill Reiflin, Chris Wong and occasionally husband Robert Fripp. Described as &quot;European experimental meets West Coast American grunge&quot;, the Humans recorded their debut studio album &quot;We Are the Humans&quot; in Seattle in 2008, released in Estonia in May 2009 to coincide with the band&#x27;s return to play in front of the country&#x27;s president. The album received a UK digital release in September 2009, along with a single &quot;These Boots Are Made for Walkin&#x27;&quot;. At the end of the year Willcox came seventh in a BBC series naming the &quot;Queens of British Pop&quot;, as voted for by the British public. In 2010 Willcox with the Humans performed at the London&#x27;s Roundhouse Haiti earthquake fundraiser concert.

===2011–present: Anniversary tours, &quot;Posh Pop&quot;, and later work===

On 17 June 2011, Willcox commenced on a special from Sheep Farming to Anthem tour, celebrating the 30th anniversary of her breakthrough hit &quot;It&#x27;s a Mystery&quot; and the platinum-selling album &quot;Anthem&quot;, starting at the London&#x27;s Leicester Square Theatre. The set included selections drawn exclusively from Toyah&#x27;s first three albums, &quot;Sheep Farming in Barnet&quot; (1979), &quot;The Blue Meaning&quot; (1980) and &quot;Anthem&quot; (1981). Andi Fraggs, a British electronic musician, supported her on chosen dates.

On 14 April 2012, Willcox launched the Changeling Resurrection 2012 tour at the Concorde 2 in Brighton to celebrate the 30th anniversary of her album &quot;The Changeling&quot; (1982). On 16 July 2012, Willcox performed a concert in her birthplace of Kings Heath, Birmingham, to celebrate being the first artist with a star on the King&#x27;s Heath Walk of Fame. Andi Fraggs made a surprise appearance, duetting Willcox&#x27;s 1981 hit single &quot;Thunder in the Mountains&quot;. In 2013, Willcox took part in the second series of the ITV diving competition &quot;Splash!&quot;. She competed in the second heat, and lost the splash-off to Anna Williamson, ultimately becoming the sixth contestant to be eliminated. Willcox released a deluxe edition of her 2008 album &quot;In the Court of the Crimson Queen&quot; and embarked on the tour revisiting the &quot;Love Is the Law&quot; (1983)-era material.

Willcox continued to tour both with her full band and also with an acoustic line-up for her &quot;Up Close and Personal&quot; shows. Willcox went on to appear in a number of films, including &quot;Aaaaaaaah!&quot;, &quot;In Extremis&quot;, &quot;Lies We Tell&quot;, &quot;Swiperight&quot;, &quot;Heckle&quot; and &quot;Invasion Planet Earth&quot;.

She appeared in Celebrity Money for Nothing (2017), she won her heat of &quot;Celebrity Mastermind&quot; (2018), and appeared on &quot;Pointless Celebrities&quot; in 2019.

In 2019, Willcox charted at no. 74 in the UK Albums Chart with a re-issue of her 2008 album &quot;In the Court of the Crimson Queen&quot;. It also peaked at no. 22 on the Official Charts Company&#x27;s sales chart and no. 7 in the independent chart. This was Willcox&#x27; first appearance in the UK Albums Chart since &quot;Minx&quot; in 1985.

In 2020, the box set &quot;Toyah Solo&quot; was released, containing six solo albums with bonus material, one &quot;Rare, Remixed and Revisited&quot; CD, and a DVD with promo videos and interviews. Also in 2020, following their acquisition of the Toyah Safari catalogue, Cherry Red Records began reissuing Willcox&#x27;s early albums in deluxe 2CD/DVD and vinyl formats. Both &quot;Sheep Farming in Barnet&quot; and &quot;Blue Meaning&quot; have been reissued, both appearing in the UK Albums Chart.

During the first UK lockdown of 2020, Willcox began broadcasting from her home across social media and YouTube. On Saturdays she answers fan questions and shares archive performances in &quot;Toyah at Home&quot; and co-hosts &quot;Agony Aunts&quot; alongside her husband Robert Fripp. However, it is her &quot;Sunday Lunch&quot; series with Fripp that has garnered the most fame, frequently going viral and racking up millions of hits on YouTube. She and Fripp started publishing weekly videos in 2021, covering songs such as Slipknot&#x27;s &quot;Psychosocial&quot;, Billy Idol&#x27;s &quot;Rebel Yell&quot;, Rammstein&#x27;s &quot;Keine Lust&quot;, Foo Fighters&#x27; &quot;All My Life&quot;, Grace Jones&#x27; &quot;Slave to the Rhythm&quot; and Rage Against the Machine&#x27;s &quot;Killing in the Name&quot;.

In December 2023 Willcox was a celebrity presenter on the BBC One property auction series &quot;Homes Under the Hammer&quot;.

From September 2024 she was a contestant on the twenty-second series of the BBC competition &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot; and was partnered with professional dancer Neil Jones. She described the show as &quot;the best experience of her life&quot;. Willcox and Jones were placed at the bottom of the leader board in the first week, with 12 points. They scored 18 points in week two, yet were placed at the bottom of the leaderboard when the scores from both weeks were combined. The audience vote landed the couple in the bottom two, but they beat Tom Dean and partner Nadiya Bychkova in the dance-off. They scored 15 points in week three and were again at the bottom of the leaderboard. Placed by the audience in the bottom two, they lost the dance-off to Paul Merson and Karen Hauer.

==Personal life==

Willcox has been married since 1986 to musician Robert Fripp, founder and guitarist of the progressive rock group King Crimson. The couple have no children; their wills leave their estates to the establishment of a musical educational trust for children.

In 1987 Willcox was invited to make a speech at the Women of the Year ceremony in the presence of Diana, Princess of Wales, expressing her views on the subject of how being disabled (in her case, dyslexia) can be a goad to creativity and inspire a craving for a fuller life experience.

In 2002 she became a prominent opponent of planned accommodation centres for asylum seekers near the Worcestershire village of Throckmorton, protesting together with more than one thousand villagers.

In November 2007 Willcox took on the role of sponsoring the Black Country Urban Park for the People&#x27;s £50 million Big Lottery Fund. In April 2008, she took part in the Great Walk to Beijing alongside other celebrities, to raise money for Olivia Newton-John&#x27;s cancer charity.

In 2009 she had corrective surgery when she had a hip replacement and one of her legs shortened.

<text>Milman Parry (June 23, 1902 – December 3, 1935) was an American Classicist whose theories on the origin of Homer&#x27;s works have revolutionized Homeric studies to such a fundamental degree that he has been described as the &quot;Darwin of Homeric studies&quot;. In addition, he was a pioneer in the discipline of oral tradition.

==Early life and education==

Parry was born in 1902 in Oakland, California. He grew up in a house full of books, with a father who was self-taught and widely read. He and his siblings often recited poems from memory as a game. 

He graduated from Oakland Technical High School in 1919, and studied at the University of California, Berkeley (B.A. and M.A.) where he became proficient in ancient Greek and the Classics. He then studied for a PhD at the Sorbonne in Paris and was a student of the linguist Antoine Meillet. 

In his dissertations, which were published in French in 1928, Parry demonstrated that the Homeric style is characterized by the extensive use of fixed expressions, or &quot;formulas&quot;, adapted for expressing a given idea under the same metrical conditions. For example, &quot;divine Odysseus&quot;, &quot;many-counseled Odysseus&quot;, or &quot;much-enduring divine Odysseus&quot; had less to do with moving the story forward than with being in accordance with the amount of material to be fitted into the remainder of the hexameter verse. The oral nature of the poem was evident in the dependence on these devices, both as memory aids and to allow for easier improvisation. They were clues suggesting that the two Homeric epics were not the inventions of a single poet but had been gradually evolved in a long-standing tradition. As one scholar put it, &quot;Parry never solved the Homeric Question [who was Homer]; he demonstrated that it was irrelevant&quot;.

Meillet introduced Parry to Matija Murko, who had worked on oral epic traditions in Yugoslavia and had made phonograph recordings of some performances.

==Academic career==
In 1928–1929, Parry began his academic career as a Professor of Latin and Greek at Drake University. Between 1933 and 1935 Parry, at the time an assistant professor at Harvard University, made two visits to Yugoslavia, where he studied and recorded oral traditional poetry in Serbo-Croat with the help on his second visit of his assistant Albert Lord, and a native singer and fixer named Nikola Vujnović, who became essential to finding and communicating with other singers, known as the &quot;guslar&quot;. They worked in Bosnia, where literacy was lowest and the oral tradition was, in the term used by Parry and Lord, &quot;purest&quot;. They made thousands of hours of recordings in remote mountain villages of illiterate farmers who sang epic songs of prodigious length from memory. Parry and Lord recorded on newly invented equipment, flat aluminum records instead of vinyl, custom made for the expedition, with only a five minute recording time. Discs were continually swapped with a special two-disc machine to create a single long recording, later transcribed. They also recorded conversations between &quot;guslari&quot; after it became apparent this was also part of the creative process that fertilized improvisation. 

The &quot;jewel of the collection&quot; is &quot;The Wedding Song of Smailagić Meho&quot;, by a poet named Avdo Međedović, &quot;by far the most skillful and versatile performer whom Milman encountered&quot;. One of the songs, running to some 13,000 lines and performed over five days, was the closest analogue to Homer in quality and quantity; Parry said one &quot;has the overwhelming sense that, in some way, he is hearing Homer&quot;. Međedović boasted he knew longer songs.

In his American publications of the 1930s, Parry introduced the hypothesis that the formulaic structure of Homeric epic is to be explained as a characteristic feature of oral composition, the so-called Oral Formulaic Hypothesis. After Parry&#x27;s death, the idea was championed by Albert Lord, most notably in &quot;The Singer of Tales&quot; (1960). 

The musical part of his recordings made in Jugoslavia was later notated and published postumum in the fifties by Béla Bartók, commissioned by the Columbia University in 1942. This publication is provided with a long Introduction by Bartók. 

==Death and commemoration==
When Parry returned to the United States in 1935, he learned that his wealthy mother-in-law had fallen in with some people who were exploiting her without her knowledge. During his field excursions in the Balkans, Parry carried a gun with him, and he packed one in his luggage for a visit to California with his wife for the purpose of aiding his mother-in-law. In the late afternoon of December 3, at the Palms Hotel in Los Angeles, Parry was dressing for a dinner with friends, while his wife was in another room. Accounts differ, but she either heard a muffled shot or Parry groaning, and found him shot in the heart. He died soon afterwards. Police detectives determined that the gun was fired accidentally as he was removing clothing from his luggage. The safety had not been set and the trigger had become entangled in a shirt, which bore gunpowder burns.

Various rumors circulated, including the ideas that Parry committed suicide because he was despondent over Harvard&#x27;s failure to give him a permanent appointment, or that his wife killed him. Parry&#x27;s daughter, Marian, believed for the rest of her life that her mother killed him, and pointed to her mother&#x27;s insane fits and accusations of infidelity. Detailed examination of the evidence by classicist Steve Reece concurs with the contemporary official conclusion that Parry&#x27;s death was accidental. 

Parry&#x27;s collected papers were published posthumously in &quot;The Making of Homeric Verse: The Collected Papers of Milman Parry&quot;, edited by his son Adam Parry (Oxford University Press, 1971). The Milman Parry collection of records and transcriptions of South Slavic heroic poetry is now in the Widener Library of Harvard University. The journal &quot;Oral Tradition&quot; is devoted to advancing Parry&#x27;s work.

==Influence==
According to Steve Reece, there is &quot;an enormous body of literature on Parry’s intellectual legacy&quot;. His influence is evident in the work of later scholars who have argued that there was a fundamental break in institutional structure between Homeric Greece and Platonic Greece, a break characterized by the transition from an oral culture to a written culture. This line of thought holds that in Homeric society, oral poetry served as a record of institutional and cultural practices. This thesis is associated with Eric Havelock, who cites Parry. Havelock argues that the fixed expressions that Parry identified can be understood as mnemonic aids, which were vital to the well-being of society, given the importance of the information carried by the poetry.

== Personal life ==
Parry was married to Marian Thanhouser, who came from a German Jewish family, and endured antisemitic comments from some of her husband&#x27;s colleagues. They had two children, Marian and Adam Parry (1928–1971). The latter was the chairman of Yale University&#x27;s Classics Department, until his untimely death, together with his wife Anne Amory, in a motorbike accident.

<text>Hjalmar &quot;Hjallis&quot; Johan Andersen (12 March 1923 – 27 March 2013) was a speed skater from Norway who won three gold medals at the 1952 Winter Olympic Games of Oslo, Norway. He was the only triple gold medalist at the 1952 Winter Olympics, and as such, became the most successful athlete there.

Nicknamed &quot;King Glad&quot; for his famous cheerful mood, he was one of Norway&#x27;s most popular sportsmen ever. Four statues of him were raised during his lifetime; in Trondheim, Hamar, Rødøy and outside Bislett Stadium in Oslo. He was honored with a funeral at the state’s expense.

== Early life ==
Andersen was born on Rødøya, an island off the coast of Nordland in Norway, where his mother hailed from. His father, who originally was from Hammerfest, was a boatswain. While Andersen was still a toddler, the family moved to Lademoen, a working-class neighborhood in Trondheim, where sport and friendship was an important part of life.

He began speed skating at the age of 10, and became a member of the sports club Falken. The club was part of the Workers&#x27; Sports Federation (AIF), and the first competitions he participated in were small, local competitions organized by the AIF. Other members of the club were Sverre Farstad and Henry Wahl; later Andersen, Farstad and Wahl would be known by the nickname The Falken Trio.

After the German occupation of Norway in 1940, when Andersen was 17 years old, all organized sports competitions were halted as a result of the sports boycott against the Nazi regime. Like others of his generation, he had to wait until the winter of 1946 to take up his sports career again.

Professionally, he began working as a delivery boy in a sports store after having completed the folkeskole at about 14. He later worked as a lorry driver for several years. In 1950, when he was at the height of his speed skating career, he opened his own sports store in Trondheim, which he ran until 1960.

== Career ==
He made his international debut at the 1948 Winter Olympic Games of St. Moritz, Switzerland, winning the qualifying race for 1500 m, but he was still not selected for the Norwegian team for this distance. He was selected for the 10000 m team, but because of the terrible ice conditions he did not finish the race.

During the European Championship in Davos he noted a personal best at 2:16.4 at 1,500 m and set a new world record in the 10,000 m with 16:57.4. He placed second overall in the championship.

Andersen was the best skater of the world in the period of 1950 to 1952. In each of those three years, he became World Allround Champion, making him one of only five male skaters to have won this title in three consecutive years – the other four being Oscar Mathisen (1912–1914), Ard Schenk (1970–1972), Eric Heiden (1977–1979), and Sven Kramer (2007–2010). In those same years, 1950–1952, he was also European Allround Champion and Norwegian Allround Champion, thus winning the &quot;triple&quot; (World, European, and National Allround Championships) for three consecutive years. In addition, he also set three world records in those three years.

A notable event in his career was the European Championship in 1951 at Bislett Stadium. Speed skating was immensely popular in Norway at the time and 25,000 people cheered the skaters during the two-day event. King Haakon VII was present at the event.

During the event, Andersen won the three first distances and was a clear favourite to become allround champion before the 10,000 metres. After 11 laps, however, Andersen fell. He tried to continue on, but one of his skates had been damaged and he was taken off the rink. Andersen’s fall was soon linked to a flash used by photographer Johan Brun from Dagbladet at the moment of the fall. It was decided to let Andersen run the 10,000 metres for a second time, while a jury was to consider whether the second run should actually count. In the meantime, Brun rushed to Dagbladet to get his film developed. He returned with the photo he had taken when the fall happened. It showed that Andersen had his eyes shut at the time. The jury concluded that the flash had blinded Andersen.

The result from his second 10,000 metres run became official and he won both the 10,000 metres and the overall championship. Brun and Andersen had friendly contact later in life. Brun has stated that the electronic flash he had used couldn&#x27;t possibly have blinded Andersen, and he believes the jury made a mistake due to lack of knowledge of photography equipment.

In a speed skating international between Norway and the rest of the world at Hamar on 10 February 1952, Hjalmar Andersen set a world record in the 10,000 meters with the time 16:32.6. It was the first time a speed skater took less than 40 seconds to complete every lap in the 10,000 meters, and it was regarded as an amazing world record. In Norway, the record achieved legendary status, and is often referred to as the best known sports record ever. The record stood for eight years, until Kjell Bäckman broke it.

The record created enormous interest in Andersen in the 1952 Winter Olympics that started in Oslo one week later. On 17 February, Andersen won his first Olympic gold medal in the 5,000 meters with a new Olympic record. The next day, he won gold in the 1,500 meters, and he ended the competition by setting a new Olympic record in winning the 10,000 meters on 19 February. The three days of skating competitions were attended by 75,000 enthusiastic spectators.

Andersen quit skating after the 1952 Olympics, but he was talked into giving it a new try in 1954. He became Norwegian champion for the fourth time and won both the 5,000 m and 10000 m at the European Championships in Davos, Switzerland that year, winning silver in the overall standings. He qualified for the 1956 Olympics and earned sixth place on the 10,000 m.

During his career, he set four world records. His 10,000 m world record in 1949 (16:57.4) was the first official world record below 17 minutes for the distance. As it was skated outside of Norway, it did not count as a Norwegian national record, of which Andersen set eight during his skating career. Andersen represented &quot;Sportsklubben Falken&quot; (Sports Club Falcon) in Trondheim.

== Later years ==
After he ended his skating career, Andersen moved to Tønsberg. In addition to his skating triumphs, Andersen was also a great cyclist on a national level, and he was awarded the Egebergs Ærespris in 1951 for his achievements in speed skating and cycling.

He started a long and joyful career in &quot;the welfare service for merchant shipping&quot;, which he worked with until he reached retirement age in 1990.

Earning the nickname &quot;Kong Glad&quot; (English: King Happy&quot;) and known for his sense of humour, he was a popular speaker. He also published several books, partly memories from his sports career and partly humoristic stories.

He received the King&#x27;s Medal of Merit in gold in 1998 and The Honor Prize at Idrettsgallaen together with Knut Johannesen in 2013, just two months before his death.

== Personal life ==

Andersen married his teenage sweetheart, Gerd, and they lived together until she died in 2004. They had three children.

== Death and funeral==
On 25 March 2013, Andersen suffered a serious fall in his home in Tønsberg, Norway, was rushed to the hospital and never regained consciousness. He died two days later on 27 March, two weeks after his 90th birthday. His survivors include three children and grandson Fredrik van der Horst, a speedskater who represented Norway at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, British Columbia.

The Norwegian government decided that Hjalmar Andersen should be honored with a funeral at the state’s expense. The third athlete to be given this honor since 1998.

Prime minister Jens Stoltenberg stated that “Hjalmar Andersen became a sport legend at a time when speed skating was part of the Norwegian identity, and got involved in the work for sailors at time when ship transport was interwoven with the nation’s soul. In this way, &#x27;Hjallis&#x27; contributed to forming post-war Norway in an important way and won a huge place in the hearts of several generations of Norwegians.”

The funeral ceremony in Tønsberg Cathedral on 4 April 2013 was attended by King Harald V and by Norway&#x27;s Prime minister Jens Stoltenberg who gave a speech.

==Medals and Records==
An overview of medals won by Andersen at important championships he participated in, listing the years in which he won each:

Over the course of his career, Andersen skated four world records:

Norwegian records

Note that in the days Hjalmar skated a Norwegian record could only be skated in Norway itself, so his Davos world record could not become a Norwegian record as well.

Personal records

To put these personal records in perspective, the &quot;WR&quot; column lists the official world records on the dates that Andersen skated his personal records.

==Ranking as speed skater==
Andersen had a final Adelskalender score of 187.446 points. He held first place on the Adelskalender for 708 days between 1952 and 1954.

<text>Wagh El Birket ( ) was, through the first half of the 20th century, the entertainment district (or red-light district) of Cairo, Egypt. The lake was where Azbakeya is now.

==Events==
In the 19th century, as Cairo expanded, Wagh El Birket developed as a contact zone between the wealthy area around the Azbakeya Lake and the expanding central Cairo. The street ran from the Hotel Bristol to Clot Bey Square.

In 1911, the street was described as &quot;the most unblushing in Cairo&quot;. On one side was an arcade with cafes underneath. On the other were houses with balconies on the upper floors. &quot;Ladies of the night&quot; dressed in flimsy gowns would display themselves on the balconies. Towards the Clot Bey end was the Fishmarket, a particularly squalid area.

===WWI===
In World War I, there were violent incidents in the Wagh El Birket, including the major incident known as the Battle of the Wazzir.

===WWII===
During the Second World War, the street was known as &quot;the Berka&quot; by troops. The military set up brothels on the street, which Medical Corps controlled. Medical centres, officially known as PA centres (&quot;preventative ablution&quot;), to try and prevent servicemen catching STI were set up in the area, and the army medical services oversaw the regular check-ups of prostitutes which were carried out by civilian authorities. The street had warning signs of a cross on a white background at both ends.

After two Australian soldiers were killed on the street, the authorities closed the Berka down in May 1942. Some of the troops blamed General Bernard Montgomery for the closure as he had a reputation as a Puritan.

==Fiction==
The Wagh El Birket features prominently in several novels by Egyptian author Naguib Mahfouz, particularly the &quot;Cairo Trilogy&quot;.

<text>A red-light district or pleasure district is a part of an urban area where a concentration of prostitution and sex-oriented businesses, such as sex shops, strip clubs, and adult theaters, are found. In most cases, red-light districts are particularly associated with female street prostitution, though in some cities, these areas may coincide with spaces of male prostitution and gay venues. Areas in many big cities around the world have acquired an international reputation as red-light districts.

==Origins of the term==

Red-light districts are mentioned in the 1882 minutes of a Woman&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union meeting in the United States. The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; records the earliest known appearance of the term &quot;red light district&quot; in print as an 1894 article from the &quot;Sandusky Register&quot;, a newspaper in Sandusky, Ohio.

Author Paul Wellman suggests that this and other terms associated with the American Old West originated in Dodge City, Kansas, home to a well-known prostitution district during the 19th century, which included the Red Light House saloon. This has not been proven, but the Dodge City use was likely responsible for the term&#x27;s pervasiveness. A widespread folk etymology claims that early railroad workers took red lanterns with them when they visited brothels so their crew could find them in the event of an emergency. However, folklorist Barbara Mikkelson regards this as unfounded.

A commonly repeated, though likely spurious, folk etymology stems from sailors coming back from sea to Amsterdam (): Women working as prostitutes, deprived of proper hygiene and running fresh water, carrying red lanterns — with their color camouflaging boils, zits, inequalities in the face and on the skin — made clear they were available as women of pleasure.

One of the many terms used for a red-light district in Japanese is , literally meaning &quot;red-line&quot;. Japanese police drew a red line on maps to indicate the boundaries of legal red-light districts. In Japanese, the term , literally meaning &quot;blue-line&quot;, also exists, indicating an illegal district.

In the United States during the 19th and early 20th centuries, the term &quot;sporting district&quot; became popular for legal red-light districts. Municipal governments typically defined such districts explicitly to contain and regulate prostitution.

==Other uses==

In WWI (circa 1915), &quot;Brothels displayed blue lamps if they were for officers and red lamps for other ranks.&quot;

==Legal issues==
Some red-light districts (such as De Wallen, Netherlands, or Reeperbahn, Germany) are places that are officially designated by authorities for legal and regulated prostitution. Often, these red-light districts were formed by authorities to help regulate prostitution and other related activities, such that they were confined to a single area.

Some red-light districts (such as those in The Hague) are under video surveillance. This can help counter illegal forms of prostitution (such as child prostitution), in these areas that do allow regular prostitution to occur.

<doc id="205999" wikidata="Q1790889" url="?curid=205999" title="The Weekly Standard">
<text>The Weekly Standard was an American neoconservative political magazine of news, analysis, and commentary that was published 48 times per year. Originally edited by founders Bill Kristol and Fred Barnes, the &quot;Standard&quot; was described as a &quot;redoubt of neoconservatism&quot; and as &quot;the neocon bible.&quot; Its founding publisher, News Corporation, debuted the title on September 18, 1995. In 2009, News Corporation sold the magazine to a subsidiary of the Anschutz Corporation. On December 14, 2018, its owners announced that the magazine would cease publication, with the last issue to be published on December 17. Sources have attributed its demise to an increasing divergence between Kristol and other editors&#x27; shift towards anti-Trump positions on the one hand, and the magazine&#x27;s audience&#x27;s shift towards Trumpism on the other.

Many of the magazine&#x27;s articles were written by members of conservative think tanks located in Washington, including the American Enterprise Institute, the Ethics and Public Policy Center, the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, the Hudson Institute, and the Foreign Policy Initiative. Individuals who wrote for the magazine included Elliott Abrams, Peter Berkowitz, John Bolton, Ellen Bork, David Brooks, Gertrude Himmelfarb, Christopher Hitchens, Harvey Mansfield, Cynthia Ozick, Joe Queenan, and John Yoo. The magazine&#x27;s website also produced regular online-only commentaries and news articles. The site&#x27;s editorial stance was described as neoconservative.

==History==

The &quot;Standard&quot; was viewed as heavily influential during the administration of President George W. Bush (2001–2009), being called the in-flight magazine of Air Force One. In 2003, although the magazine&#x27;s circulation was only 55,000, Kristol said that &quot;We have a funny relationship with the top tier of the administration. They very much keep us at arm&#x27;s length, but Vice President Dick Cheney does send over someone to pick up 30 copies of the magazine every Monday.&quot;

In 2006, though the publication had never been profitable and reputedly lost more than a million dollars a year, News Corporation head Rupert Murdoch initially dismissed the idea of selling it. Subsequently, in June 2009, a report circulated that a sale of the publication to Philip Anschutz was imminent, with Murdoch&#x27;s position being that, having since purchased &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; in 2007, his interest in the smaller publication had diminished. &quot;The Washington Examiner&quot; reported that month that the &quot;Examiner&quot;″s parent company, the Anschutz-owned Clarity Media Group, had purchased the &quot;Standard&quot;; the price was about $1 million.

The &quot;Standard&quot; increased its paid circulation by 39 percent between its June 2009 and June 2010 BPA statements. Its print circulation of about 100,000 in 2013 had decreased to 72,000 by 2017, according to the BPA, with circulation dropping about 10 percent between 2016 and 2017.

In late 2016, Kristol ended his time as editor-in-chief. He was replaced by Stephen Hayes, the magazine&#x27;s senior writer. Under Hayes&#x27; leadership, the &quot;Standard&quot; continued to be as critical of Donald Trump as it had been under Kristol; Trump&#x27;s supporters in turn criticized the &quot;Standard&quot;, and the magazine&#x27;s influence as Republican circles dwindled.

In December 2017, &quot;The Weekly Standard&quot; became an official fact-checking partner for Facebook.

On December 14, 2018, Clarity Media Group announced that it would cease publication of the magazine after 23 years. While some speculated that the closure of &quot;The Weekly Standard&quot; was so Clarity Media&#x27;s other magazine, the &quot;Washington Examiner&quot;, could absorb the &quot;Standard&quot;″s subscribers, a statement from Clarity Media Group chairman Ryan McKibben said that such speculation was incorrect. Kristol attributed the magazine&#x27;s demise to the hostility of supporters of the Donald Trump administration.

===Support of the invasion of Iraq===
The &quot;Standard&quot; promoted and supported the invasion of Iraq to remove Saddam Hussein. In November 1997 Bill Kristol and Robert Kagan wrote an editorial titled &quot;Saddam Must Go&quot;, in which they stated &quot;We know it seems unthinkable to propose another ground attack to take Baghdad. But it&#x27;s time to start thinking the unthinkable.&quot;

In the first issue the magazine published after 9/11, according to Scott McConnell of &quot;The American Conservative&quot;, &quot;Gary Schmitt and Tom Donnelly, two employees of Kristol’s PNAC, clarified what ought to be the country’s war aims. Their rhetoric was to link Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden in virtually every paragraph, to join them at the hip in the minds of readers, and then to lay out a strategy that actually gave attacking Saddam priority over eliminating al-Qaeda.&quot;

On December 16, 2018, co-founder and contributing editor John Podhoretz defended the coverage answering the question by Lulu Garcia-Navarro on NPR: &quot;Do you regret the coverage of Iraq War?&quot; saying &quot;I think, basically, what—all a magazine—editors, writers—can promise is that they will be honest and say what they mean and think and argue the best way that they can. And with the facts available at the time, that is what The &quot;Standard&quot; did.&quot;

===Libel case===
In 1997, nearly a year after a cover story that included allegations of hiring a prostitute and plagiarism against best-selling author Deepak Chopra, the editors of &quot;The Weekly Standard&quot; accepted full responsibility for the errors in the story, and apologized.&quot; Chopra claimed that the magazine settled for $1.6 million.

<doc id="206001" wikidata="Q39991" url="?curid=206001" title="Ptolemy XII Auletes">
<text>Ptolemy XII Neos Dionysus ( – 51 BC) was a king of the Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt who ruled from 80 to 58 BC and then again from 55 BC until his death in 51 BC. He was commonly known as Auletes (, &quot;the Flautist&quot;), referring to his love of playing the flute in Dionysian festivals. A member of the Ptolemaic dynasty, he was a descendant of its founder Ptolemy I, a Macedonian Greek general and companion of Alexander the Great.

Ptolemy XII was an illegitimate son of Ptolemy IX by an uncertain mother. In 116 BC, Ptolemy IX became co-regent with his mother, Cleopatra III. However, he was forced into a civil war against his mother and his brother, Ptolemy X, leading to his exile in 107 BC. Cleopatra III sent her grandsons to Kos in 103 BC. They were captured by Mithridates VI of Pontus probably in 88 BC. After the killing of his cousin Ptolemy XI, Ptolemy XII was recalled from Pontus and proclaimed pharaoh, while his brother, also named Ptolemy, was installed as king of Cyprus.

Ptolemy XII married his relative Cleopatra V, who was likely one of his sisters or cousins; they had at least one child together, Berenice IV, and Cleopatra V was likely also the mother of his second daughter, Cleopatra VII. The king&#x27;s three youngest children – Arsinoe IV, Ptolemy XIII, and Ptolemy XIV – were born to an unknown mother. Ptolemy XII&#x27;s uncle Ptolemy X had left Egypt to Rome in the event there were no surviving heirs, making Roman annexation of Egypt a possibility. In an effort to prevent this, Ptolemy XII established an alliance with Rome late into his first reign. Rome annexed Cyprus in 58 BC, causing Ptolemy of Cyprus to commit suicide.

Shortly afterwards, Ptolemy XII was deposed by the Egyptian people and fled to Rome, and his eldest daughter, Berenice IV, took the throne. With Roman funding and military assistance, Ptolemy XII recaptured Egypt and had Berenice IV killed in 55 BC. He named his daughter Cleopatra VII as his co-regent in 52 BC. He died the next year and was succeeded by Cleopatra VII and her brother Ptolemy XIII as joint rulers.

==Background and early life==

Ptolemy XII was the oldest son of Ptolemy IX. The identity of his mother is uncertain. Ptolemy IX was married twice, to his sister Cleopatra IV from around 119 BC until he was forced to divorce her in 115 BC, and secondly to another sister, Cleopatra Selene, from 115 BC until he abandoned her during his flight from Alexandria in 107 BC. However, Cicero and other ancient sources refer to Ptolemy XII as an illegitimate son; Pompeius Trogus called him a &quot;nothos&quot; (bastard), while Pausanias wrote that Ptolemy IX had no legitimate sons at all. Some scholars have therefore proposed that his mother was a concubine – if so, probably an Alexandrian Greek. It had been speculated by Werner Huß that Ptolemy XII&#x27;s mother was an unknown woman belonging to the Egyptian elite, based upon a speculated earlier marriage between Psenptais II, high priest of Ptah, and a certain &quot;Berenice&quot;, once argued to possibly be a daughter of Ptolemy VIII. However, the speculation of this marriage was refuted by Egyptologist Wendy Cheshire. Chris Bennett argues that Ptolemy XII&#x27;s mother was Cleopatra IV and that he was considered illegitimate simply because she had never been co-regent. This theory is endorsed by the historian Adrian Goldsworthy.

The date of Ptolemy XII&#x27;s birth is thus uncertain. If he was the son of Cleopatra IV, he was probably born around 117 BC and followed around a year later by a brother, known as Ptolemy of Cyprus. In 117 BC, Ptolemy IX was governor of Cyprus, but in 116 BC he returned to Alexandria upon the death of his father, Ptolemy VIII. At this point, Ptolemy IX became the junior co-regent of his grandmother Cleopatra II and his mother, Cleopatra III. In 115 BC, his mother forced him to divorce Cleopatra IV, who fled into exile. The former Egyptian queen married the Seleucid king Antiochus IX, but she was murdered by his half-brother and rival Antiochus VIII in 112 BC. Ptolemy IX meanwhile had been remarried to Cleopatra Selene, with whom he had a daughter, Berenice III. By 109 BC, Ptolemy IX had begun the process of introducing Ptolemy XII to public life. In that year, Ptolemy XII served as the Priest of Alexander and Ptolemaic kings (an office which Ptolemy IX otherwise held himself throughout his reign) and had a festival established in his honour in Cyrene. Relations between Ptolemy IX and his mother deteriorated. In 107 BC she forced him to flee Alexandria for Cyprus and replaced him as co-regent with his younger brother, Ptolemy X. Justin mentions that Ptolemy IX left two sons behind when he fled Alexandria. Chris Bennett argues that these sons should be identified as Ptolemy XII and Ptolemy of Cyprus.
Ptolemy IX made an attempt to reclaim the Ptolemaic throne in 103 BC by invading Judaea. At the start of this war, Cleopatra III sent her grandsons to the island of Kos along with her treasure in order to protect them. There, Ptolemy XII and Ptolemy of Cyprus seem to have been captured by Mithridates VI of Pontus in 88 BC, at the outbreak of the First Mithridatic War. Ironically, their father had reclaimed the Egyptian throne around the same time. They were held by Mithridates as hostages until 80 BC. At some point during this period, probably in 81 or 80 BC, they were engaged to two of Mithridates&#x27; daughters, Mithridatis and Nyssa. Meanwhile, Ptolemy IX died in December 81 BC and was succeeded by Berenice III. In April 80 BC, Ptolemy X&#x27;s son Ptolemy XI was installed as Berenice III&#x27;s husband and co-regent. He promptly murdered her and was himself killed by an angry Alexandrian mob. The Alexandrians then summoned Ptolemy XII to Egypt to assume the kingship; his brother, also named Ptolemy, became king of Cyprus, where he would reign until 58 BC.

==First reign (80–58 BC)==
On his arrival in Alexandria, in April 80 BC, Ptolemy XII was proclaimed king. His reign was officially dated as having begun on the death of his father in 81 BC, thereby eliding the reigns of Berenice III and Ptolemy XI. Shortly after his accession, Ptolemy XII married one of his relatives, Cleopatra V. Her parentage is uncertain – modern scholarship often interprets her as a sister, but Christopher Bennett argues that she was a daughter of Ptolemy X. The couple became co-regents and they were incorporated into the Ptolemaic dynastic cult together as the &quot;Theoi Philopatores kai Philadelphoi&quot; (Father-loving and Sibling-loving Gods). This title was probably meant to reinforce Ptolemy XII&#x27;s claim to the throne in the face of claims that his parentage meant that he was an illegitimate son of Ptolemy IX and therefore not entitled to rule.
In 76 BC, the High Priest of Ptah in Memphis died and Ptolemy XII travelled to Memphis to appoint his fourteen-year-old son, Pasherienptah III, as the new High Priest. In turn, Pasherienptah III crowned Ptolemy as Pharaoh and then went to Alexandria, where he was appointed as Ptolemy XII&#x27;s &#x27;prophet&#x27;. These encounters are described in detail on Pasherienptah&#x27;s funerary stela, &quot;Stele BM 866&quot;, and they demonstrate the extremely close and mutually reinforcing relationship that had developed between the Ptolemaic kings and the Memphite priesthood by this date.

In August 69 BC, Cleopatra V ceases to be mentioned as co-regent. The images of her that had been carved on the main pylon of the Temple of Horus at Edfu were covered over at this time. The reason for this sudden shift is unknown, but presumably she was divorced at this time. Ptolemy adopted a new royal epithet &quot;Neos Dionysos&quot; (New Dionysus) at some time after this; Chris Bennett proposes that the epithet was linked to the break with Cleopatra.

===Relations with Rome===

When Ptolemy X had died in 88 BC, his will had left Egypt to Rome in the event that he had no surviving heirs. Although the Romans had not acted on this, the possibility that they might forced the following Ptolemies to adopt a careful and respectful policy towards Rome. Ptolemy XII continued this pro-Roman policy in order to protect himself and secure his dynasty&#x27;s fate. Egypt came under increasing Roman pressure nevertheless. In 65 BC, the Roman censor, Marcus Licinius Crassus proposed that Rome annex Egypt. This proposal failed in the face of opposition from Quintus Lutatius Catulus and Cicero. In light of this crisis, however, Ptolemy XII began to expend significant resources on bribing Roman politicians to support his interests. In 63 BC, when Pompey was reorganising Syria and Anatolia following his victory in the Third Mithridatic War, Ptolemy sought to form a relationship with Pompey by sending him a golden crown. Ptolemy also provided pay and maintenance for 8,000 cavalry to Pompey for his war with Judaea. He also asked Pompey to come to Alexandria and help to put down a revolt which had apparently broken out in Egypt; Pompey refused. 

The money required for these bribes was enormous. Initially, Ptolemy XII funded them by raising taxes. A strike by farmers of royal land in Herakleopolis which is attested in a papyrus document from 61/60 BC has been interpreted as a sign of widespread discontent with this taxation. Increasingly, Ptolemy XII also had recourse to loans from Roman bankers, such as Gaius Rabirius Postumus. This gave the Romans even more leverage over his regime and meant that the fate of Egypt became an increasingly immediate issue in Roman politics.

Finally, in 60 BC, Ptolemy XII travelled to Rome, where the First Triumvirate, composed of Pompey, Crassus, and Julius Caesar, had just taken power, in order to negotiate official recognition of his kingship. Ptolemy paid Pompey and Caesar six thousand talents – an enormous sum, equivalent to the total annual revenue of Egypt. In return, a formal alliance or &quot;foedus&quot; was formed. The Roman Senate recognised Ptolemy as king and Caesar passed a law that added Ptolemy to the list of friends and allies of the people of Rome (&quot;amici et socii populi Romani&quot;) in 59 BC. 
In 58 BC, the Romans took control of Cyprus, causing its ruler, Ptolemy XII&#x27;s brother, to commit suicide. Ptolemy XII took no action in response to his brother&#x27;s death and Cyprus remained a Roman province until returned to Ptolemaic control by Julius Caesar in 48 BC.

==Exile in Rome (58–55 BC)==

The bribery policy had been unpopular in Egypt for a long time, both because of its obsequiousness and because of the heavy tax burden that it entailed, but the annexation of Cyprus demonstrated its failure and enraged the people of Alexandria. The courtiers in Alexandria forced Ptolemy to step down from the throne and leave Egypt. He was replaced by his daughter Berenice IV, who ruled jointly with Cleopatra Tryphaena (known to modern historians as Cleopatra VI), who was probably Ptolemy XII&#x27;s former wife but may be an otherwise unattested daughter. Following Cleopatra Tryphaena&#x27;s death a year later, Berenice ruled alone from 57 to 56 BC.
Probably taking his daughter Cleopatra VII with him, Ptolemy fled for the safety of Rome. On the way, he stopped in Rhodes where the exiled Cato the Younger offered him advice on how to approach the Roman aristocracy, but no tangible support. In Rome, Ptolemy XII prosecuted his restitution but met opposition from certain members of the Senate. His old ally Pompey housed the exiled king and his daughter and argued on behalf of Ptolemy&#x27;s restoration in the Senate. During this time, Roman creditors realized that they would not get the return on their loans to the king without his restoration. In 57 BC, pressure from the Roman public forced the Senate&#x27;s decision to restore Ptolemy. However, Rome did not wish to invade Egypt to restore the king, since the Sibylline books stated that if an Egyptian king asked for help and Rome proceeded with military intervention, great dangers and difficulties would occur.

Egyptians heard rumours of Rome&#x27;s possible intervention and disliked the idea of their exiled king&#x27;s return. The Roman historian Cassius Dio wrote that a group of one hundred men were sent as envoys from Egypt to make their case to the Romans against Ptolemy XII&#x27;s restoration. Ptolemy seemingly had their leader Dio of Alexandria poisoned and most of the other protesters killed before they reached Rome.

==Restoration and second reign (55–51 BC)==

In 55 BC, Ptolemy paid Aulus Gabinius 10,000 talents to invade Egypt and so recovered his throne. Gabinius defeated the Egyptian frontier forces, marched to Alexandria, and attacked the palace, where the palace guards surrendered without fighting. The exact date of Ptolemy XII&#x27;s restoration is unknown; the earliest possible date of restoration was 4 January 55 BC and the latest possible date was 24 June the same year. Upon regaining power, Ptolemy acted against Berenice, and along with her supporters, she was executed. Ptolemy XII maintained his grip on power in Alexandria with the assistance of around two thousand Roman soldiers and mercenaries, known as the Gabiniani. This arrangement enabled Rome to exert power over Ptolemy, who ruled until he fell ill in 51 BC. On 31 May 52 BC his daughter Cleopatra VII was named as his coregent.

At the moment of Ptolemy XII&#x27;s restoration, Roman creditors demanded the repayment of their loans, but the Alexandrian treasury could not repay the king&#x27;s debt. Learning from previous mistakes, Ptolemy XII shifted popular resentment of tax increases from himself to a Roman, his main creditor Gaius Rabirius Postumus, whom he appointed &quot;dioiketes&quot; (minister of finance), and so in charge of debt repayment. Perhaps Gabinius had also put pressure on Ptolemy XII to appoint Rabirius, who now had direct access to the financial resources of Egypt but exploited the land too much. The king had to imprison Rabirius to protect his life from the angry people, then allowed him to escape. Rabirius immediately left Egypt and went back to Rome at the end of 54 BC. There he was accused &quot;de repetundis&quot;, but defended by Cicero and probably acquitted. Ptolemy also permitted a debasing of the coinage as an attempt to repay the loans. Near the end of Ptolemy&#x27;s reign, the value of Egyptian coinage dropped to about fifty per cent of its value at the beginning of his first reign.

Ptolemy XII died sometime before 22 March 51 BC. His will stipulated that Cleopatra VII and her brother Ptolemy XIII should rule Egypt together. To safeguard his interests, he made the people of Rome executors of his will. Since the Senate was busy with its own affairs, his ally Pompey approved the will.

==Legacy and assessments==
Generally, descriptions of Ptolemy XII portray him as weak and self-indulgent, drunk, or a lover of music. According to Strabo, his practice of playing the flute earned him the ridiculing sobriquet &quot;Auletes&quot; (&#x27;flute player&#x27;):

According to the author Mary Siani-Davies:

==Marriage and issue==
Ptolemy married his sister Cleopatra V, who was with certainty the mother of his eldest known child, Berenice IV. Cleopatra V disappears from court records a few months after the birth of Ptolemy XII&#x27;s second known child, and probably hers, Cleopatra VII in 69 BC. The identity of the mother of the last three of Ptolemy XII&#x27;s children, in birth order Arsinoe IV, Ptolemy XIII, and Ptolemy XIV, is also uncertain. One hypothesis contends that possibly they (and perhaps Cleopatra VII) were Ptolemy XII&#x27;s children with a theoretical half Macedonian Greek, half Egyptian woman belonging to a priestly family from Memphis in northern Egypt, but this is only speculation.

The philosopher Porphyry (c. 234 – c. 305 AD) wrote of Ptolemy XII&#x27;s daughter Cleopatra VI, who reigned alongside her sister Berenice IV. The Greek historian Strabo (c. 63 BC – c. AD 24) stated that the king had only three daughters of whom the eldest has been referred to as Berenice IV. This suggests that the Cleopatra Tryphaena mentioned by Porphyry may not have been Ptolemy XII&#x27;s daughter, but his wife. Many experts now identify Cleopatra VI with Cleopatra V.

<text>Egypt was a major battlefield in the North African campaign during the Second World War, being the location of the First and Second Battles of El Alamein. Legally an independent kingdom since 1922, and an equal sovereign power in the condominium of Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, in reality Egypt was heavily under the coercive influence of the United Kingdom, a state of affairs that had persisted since the United Kingdom intervened militarily in the Orabi Revolt in favour of Egypt&#x27;s Khedive, Tawfik Pasha, in 1882, subsequently occupying the country.

The continuing British dominance of Egyptian affairs, including British efforts to exclude Egypt from the governance of Sudan, provoked fierce Egyptian nationalist opposition to the United Kingdom. Consequently, despite playing host to thousands of British troops following the outbreak of the conflict, as it was treaty-bound to do, Egypt remained formally neutral during the war, only declaring war on the Axis powers in the spring of 1945. Though escaping the fate of Iraq, and Iran, both of whose governments were toppled by the United Kingdom during the war (the latter in conjunction with the Soviet Union), Egypt experienced the Abdeen Palace Incident, a confrontation between Egypt&#x27;s King Farouk and the British military in 1942, the results of which would contribute directly to the Egyptian revolution of 1952 a decade later.

For most of the 19th century, though nominally a self-governing vassal state of the Ottoman Empire, Egypt under the Muhammad Ali dynasty was a virtually independent state, with ever-increasing territorial possessions in East Africa, chiefly Sudan and a political elite class of pashas. Ultimately the United Kingdom would become the dominant foreign power in Egypt and Sudan. In 1875, facing an economic emergency caused in large measure by his grand modernisation plans, Egypt&#x27;s Khedive, Isma&#x27;il the Magnificent, sold to the British government Egypt&#x27;s shares in the Universal Company of the Maritime Canal of Suez, the company established by Egypt to hold the 99-year lease to manage the Suez Canal. Seen by the United Kingdom as a vital connection to its maritime empire, particularly in India, British control of the Canal was the foundation for British control over Egypt as a whole. Four years later in 1879, the United Kingdom along with the other Great Powers deposed and exiled Isma&#x27;il, replacing him with his pliant son Tewfik. After a nationalist revolt led by officer Ahmed Urabi, Britain invaded under the guise of stability. After the revolt was defeated, Britain became the de facto colonial overlord of Egypt, with Evelyn Baring managing the finances of Egypt. British involvement in politics pressured Egypt to join World War One against the Ottoman Empire, who were at war with the British.

After the war, a delegation of Egyptian nationalists led by Sa&#x27;ad Zaghoul requested for Egyptian independence at the 1919 Paris Peace Conference. Britain tried to prevent independence by arresting the leaders of the delegation, triggering mass protests culminating in the Egyptian revolution of 1919. In 1922, the United Kingdom formally recognised Egypt as an independent state. The delegation (&quot;Wafd&quot; in Arabic) formed the Wafd party, which was Egypt&#x27;s most popular and influential political party under the 1923 Egyptian constitution. While the constitution created a democratically elected parliament, the king still had significant political power, being able to appoint the prime minister and dissolve parliament. However, the United Kingdom was able to reserve for itself specific powers in Egypt regarding foreign policy, the deployment of British military personnel in the defense of Egypt and the Suez Canal, and the administration of Sudan. This became a point of contention among Egyptian nationalists who kept negotiating for a more independent Egypt.Politically, Egyptian politics was divided into three main power brokers: the conservative palace, the liberal Wafd Party, and the imperialist British. Each would wrestle for control over one another during this time. While anti-Wafdist parties existed, they did not have the prestige or popularity that the Wafd enjoyed. The British wanted to prevent another revolution while still preserving its influence, while the King and his conservative allies sought to preserve a strong Islamic monarchy against the modern secular liberal forces.

==== 1936 Anglo-Egyptian Treaty ====
After the Italian invasion of Ethiopia, the British position was threatened, as the Kingdom of Egypt was the only country separating Italian Libya and Italian East Africa. According to the 1936 Anglo-Egyptian Treaty, British troops in Egypt were limited to the Suez Canal until 1956 and Alexandria until 1944, except in the case of a war, where instead Britain could increase their troop count. Egypt would also be obligated to materially assist Britain in the case of a war, though Egypt was not obligated to fight for Britain. This treaty gave Britain the legal right to fight World War II on Egyptian soil, while it gave Egypt the right to remain technically neutral in the conflict.

=== The Egyptian government ===

==== Ali Maher&#x27;s premiership ====
By the start of the war, native power in Egypt was split in between King Farouk, and parliament, led by the conservative anti-Wafdist prime minister Ali Maher Pasha. Initially Maher obliged by the treaty; the Egyptian government broke off relations with Germany, confiscated German property, and interned German subjects. However, the government was not willing to declare war on Germany. The war was seen as a European conflict, disconnected from Egypt. King Farouk was keen for Egypt to remain neutral in the conflict, opposing the United Kingdom&#x27;s continued dominance of Egyptian affairs. The return of British soldiers to Egyptian streets merely a handful of years after they had been removed or relocated to the Suez Canal Zone, increased the already powerful opposition in Egypt to the United Kingdom. Maher&#x27;s continued unwillingness to declare war on Italy after the Italian invasion of Egypt further frustrated Britain. During an argument with Sir Miles Lampson, the British ambassador, Maher explained that:

&quot;if Egypt had sufficient troops to affect the course of the war, he would not have hesitated to declare war against Italy and Germany, but unfortunately Egypt had on her frontier only 5,000 men inadequately provided with transport. A declaration of war would, therefore, only be a spectacular gesture, causing ruin to 16 million inhabitants.&quot;

While Italian-Egyptian relations were broken off, the Egyptian government refused to declare war on Italy. Another focus of grievance between the Egyptian government and the United Kingdom was the insistence that Farouk expel or intern Italians in Egypt, including those Italians in the service of the King. An unconfirmed story assets that Farouk told Lampson: &quot;I&#x27;ll get rid of my Italians when you get rid of yours&quot;. This remark was a reference to the ambassador&#x27;s Italian wife.The Egyptian government did not do its best to stay neutral because of pro-fascist sympathies, but because of the game of political tug-of-war between Egyptian nationalists and British influence. Egypt was under no obligation to declare war on the enemies of Britain under the 1936 treaty. The front with Italy was seen as border incidents that would only weaken the British, and many Egyptians didn&#x27;t feel like fighting for the British colonial empire. Lampson was furious at this, demanding in 1940 the withdrawal of Egyptian troops from the Western Desert, Egypt paying for the assumption of its defense by British forces; and the removal of Egyptian chief of staff Aziz Ali al-Misri for pro-Axis sympathies. These demands led to a compromise; General Henry Maitland Wilson would command Egyptian forces in the Western Desert, and al-Misri was dismissed from his post.

==== Hassan Sabry&#x27;s premiership ====
After Maher was forced to resign due to British influence, Hassan Sabry was appointed prime minister, leading a coalition of anti-Wafdist parties. His government accomplished two concessions from Britain, the abolition of the Caisse de la Dette Publique (the Public Debt Commission, where Egypt paid its debts to European creditors) and the British purchase of Egyptian cotton to support the industry while trade with mainland Europe was cut off. In return, Egypt would cooperate with the British forces, supplying their troops and subsidizing their army with millions of dollars every year. Despite not declaring war, Britain found a compromise, where Britain would be supported by the Egyptian government without direct Egyptian military involvement. This cooperation would have continued, if not for Sabry dying in November 1940.

==== Hussein Sirri Pasha&#x27;s premiership ====

With the suggestion of Lampson, Hussein Sirri Pasha was quickly appointed prime minister. Sirri promised to continue pro-British politics in parliament, but the state of Egyptian politics at the time was against him. Too deep in conservative politics to ally with the Wafd, and too pro-British to ally with the Italophile King Farouk, his fate was left with a shaky coalition of parties, a coalition of Ittihadists, Liberal-Constitutionalists, the Sa&#x27;adists led by Ahmad Maher Pasha, and Independents. During his time, vital problems such as an increased cost of living and food insecurity struck Egypt. The Wafd, led by veteran politician Mostafa el-Nahhas Pasha, saw this as their chance for regaining power, arguing for an end to the Egypt-British condominium in Sudan and the complete evacuation of British forces after the war. The Wafd blamed these problems on the British presence in the country, as the Egyptian people, spurred on by Ali Maher, protested their declining living conditions.

After the fall of Greece, the Greek government of exile was stationed in Egypt. On January 6, 1942, Egypt broke off relations with Vichy France, the fascist rump puppet state of Nazi Germany. This angered King Farouk, who was not considered in this decision. A constitutional crisis emerged over whether or not the king needed to be consulted regarding severing relations with foreign countries. Sirri agreed to resign on February 1, but the crisis soon spiraled out of control.

==== The Abdeen Palace Incident ====
On February 2, Lampson demanded Farouk worked with the Wafdist leader Nahhas to form a coalition government to continue the British presence in Egypt. Lampson was convinced that the Wafd&#x27;s anti-British rhetoric was only opposition politics, and at their heart, their liberal democratic values and popularity in Egypt would make them a strongest possible ally. However, Nahhas rejected a coalition government, knowing that an alliance with the conservatives would greatly limit his power.On February 4, Lampson threatened Farouk, saying &#x27;Unless I hear by 6 p.m. today that Nahas has been asked to form a Government His Majesty King Farouk must accept the consequences.&quot; The Egyptian response was a condemnation against British involvement in Egypt&#x27;s internal affairs. At 9 p.m., Lampson arrived at Abdeen Palace with British soldiers and tanks and threatened the King with the bombardment of his palace, his abdication and exile from Egypt unless he conceded to the British demands. This was not an empty threat; Britain invaded Iraq and overthrew the government of Iran to secure pro-Allied governments. After Lampson ordered Farouk to sign his abdication statement, Farouk offered to call Nahhas to form a cabinet. Though Lampson could have sacked the king right then and there, he agreed to a Nahhas-led Wafd government in Egypt.

Mohamed Naguib, a distinguished military officer and one of the future leaders of the Egyptian revolution of 1952, appealed to Farouk to resist the British, and pledged loyal officers to defend the palace. The incident was seen as a personal humiliation for Farouk, and a national humiliation for Egypt. Gamal Abdel Nasser, then a young military officer who would later lead the Revolution of 1952 with Mohamed Naguib, declared the incident a blatant violation of Egyptian sovereignty, and wrote: &quot;I am ashamed of our army&#x27;s powerlessness&quot;.

==== Mostafa El-Nahas&#x27; premiership ====
Elections were held in March, with the Wafd winning 203 out of 264 seats, because of a boycott by the opposition. Ali Maher was arrested in April. Finance minister Makram Ebied Pasha broke with the Wafd Part after calling the agreement between Nahhas and Lampson a &quot;second treaty&quot; and objecting to corruption within the government. After his ouster, he spent the next year writing the &quot;Black Book&quot;, a book which exposed extreme corruption within the government, especially implicating Nahhas and his wife. Not only was this a major blow to the government, it destroyed relations between Nahhas and Ebied, who were founders of the Wafd party and veterans of the 1919 revolution. Nahhas&#x27; legacy as the successor to the revolution after Sa&#x27;ad Zaghoul was in serious ruin by this time, especially after Ebied and 26 Wafdist politicians loyal to him formed a rival party. For his journalism, Ebied was arrested on May 9, 1944, until the end of Nahhas&#x27; premiership.

During his premiership, Egypt hosted two Allied World War II conferences in its capital, Cairo. The First Cairo Conference planned for the counterattack on Japan, and announced the Cairo Declaration, stating the Allied objective to be unconditional surrender of Japan. The Second Cairo Conference discussed the possible involvement of Turkey in the war against Germany, though it was agreed Turkey would remain neutral. Egypt also hosted the Alexandria Protocol, an agreement between five Arab countries (Egypt, Iraq, Lebanon, Yemen and Syria) agreeing to the formation of a joint Arab Organization, which led to the formation of the League of Arab States in the following year.

By 1944, World War II in North Africa had ended. King Farouk saw this as his chance to strike at Nahhas and the Wafd. The Wafd&#x27;s message as the nationalist opposition to the British had been tarnished. Though Lampson saw the Wafd as an ally against the young King, he knew that the government had exhausted its mandate. After Nahhas&#x27; tour of Egypt, Farouk claimed that he had acted in a semi-royal fashion, saying that &quot;there could not be two kings of Egypt&quot;. Lampson remarked, &#x27;God forbid. We have found that one is quite enough.&#x27; Relations between the king and Nahhas were beyond repair. On October 6, 1944, Nahhas was dismissed and Ali Maher and Ebeid were released from prison.

==== Ahmed Maher&#x27;s premiership ====

Ahmed Maher, the leaders of the Sa&#x27;adists – a party of ex-Wafdists – formed a government with the now-freed Ebeid returning as Minister of Finance. The 1945 elections, which were boycotted by the Wafd, were a victory for anti-Wafdist parties. In Europe, it was clear the Germany would lose the war, so politicians looked at a post-war future. The countries that fought the Axis formed the United Nations, a massive inter-governmental organization. It was clear that Egypt would be excluded from the UN if it did not join the war. On February 24, 1945, Egypt declared war on Germany and Japan. Afterwards, as Maher walked down the halls of parliament, he was assassinated by an Egyptian nationalist furious at this &#x27;capitulation&#x27; to British influence. Egypt joined the United Nations on October 24, 1945.

=== Egypt after the war ===
The war was a major moment in Egyptian history. An Egyptian prime minister had not been assassinated since Boutros Ghali in 1910, starting a wave of post-war assassinations including ex-finance minister Amin Osman, prime minister Norashy Pasha, and Hasan al-Banna, leader of the Muslim Brotherhood. Egypt&#x27;s contributions to the war effort re-opened points of contentions like the status of the Sudan, British troop presence in the country, and the Suez Canal. Meanwhile, American interests and involvement in Egypt were growing, signifying the end of the British &quot;old order&quot;. The war, more specifically the 1942 Abdeen Palace incident, demonstrated to Egyptians that neither the king or the Wafd could challenge British influence. After the war, riots in 1945 and students protests in 1946 rocked the nation. Egyptian nationalism continued to grower more potent; the 1936 treaty would be annulled in 1951. The extreme divide between rich and poor led to increasing resentment towards the government. The Egyptian &quot;ancien régime&quot; would collapse during the 1952 revolution, just seven years after the war.

== Domestic opinion in Egypt ==

=== Newspapers ===
Newspapers in Egypt regularly commented on the world affairs at the time, and consistently criticized both fascist Italy and Nazi Germany. The Second Italo-Ethiopian War alarmed Egyptians, as Italy&#x27;s naked aggression was denounced as imperialism. The Egyptian newspaper al-Ahram denounced Italy&#x27;s invasion of Ethiopia, criticizing not just the brutal Italian conquest, but the world for allowing a League of Nations member to be invaded. The newspapers al-Muqattam called it &quot;white imperialism&quot;, while al-Ahram &quot;called on the civilized world to join together to oppose Fascist imperialism&quot;. An al-Ahram editorial in April 1937 entitled &quot;Italy and the Arabs: A New Orientation in Fascist Policy&quot;, stated that Mussolini&#x27;s attempt at outreach to the Arab world was nothing but hypocrisy. The paper also denounced Germany&#x27;s aggressive expansion before the war. The Egyptian journalist Muhammad Zaki Abd al-Qadir criticized appeasement, saying &quot;If the world comes under the influence of Hitler, Mussolini, Franco, and their ilk, it will suffer a ghastly regression into the Dark Ages when the military knighthood was the law and war was the symbol of glory&quot;. al-Qadir argued that the West should abandon appeasement and should instead confront Germany.

The weekly Ar-risala contained articles in which Hitler was denounced, one of them was an editorial which was published in 1939 and it contained the following quote: &quot;Nazism by its very nature is contradictory to freedom of expression and freedom of opinion; it is based on the rule of force&quot; and &quot;The competition between fascism and Hitlerism is for the enslavement of people&quot;. Ahmad Hasan al-Zayyat was an influential Egyptian political writer and intellectual. While he worked as an editor for Ar-risala, he wrote scathing articles on Hitler and fascism. While he attacked Nazi racism and Italy&#x27;s invasion of Ethiopia before, his magnum opus was a 1939 editorial &quot;The Crime of Nazism against Humanity.&quot; Zayyat viewed Nazism as a demonic power in contradiction to the Abrahamic religions and rejected the racist anti-Semitic ideology of Hitler. The newspaper Al Muqattam contained articles which criticized Nazi racial ideology and its anti-semitism.

Nazi Germany&#x27;s expansion in Austria and Czechoslovakia further worried the press. Al-Muqattam also criticized the racial laws in Nazi Germany, going on to say:

&quot;&quot;Who are these Aryans who boast of Aryan origin? After all, the Arab and Persian peoples—Egyptians, Iraqis, Syrians, Palestinians, Iranians—who are assumed not be Aryan are the ones who brought civilization as we know it to the world. These peoples lighted the human path to life, and from them the three monotheistic religions emerged, religions that the so-called Aryans accept and believe. So what is the advantage of these Aryan nations over them?&quot;&quot;

Taha Hussein, the famous Egyptian academic and twenty-one time Nobel Prize in Literature nominee, criticized the lack of freedom of thought in Nazi Germany, writing &quot;They live like a society of insects. They must behave like ants in an anthill or like bees in a hive.&quot; He criticized Egypt&#x27;s pro-Allied neutrality stance and called for direct participation in the war against Germany. In a 1940 review of Hermann Rauschning&#x27;s &quot;Hitler Speaks&quot;, Hussein wrote:&quot;Hitler is an intellectually limited man who does not like to delve deeply into problems or to reflect in any depth. He hates books and culture, he is superbly ignorant about what science and experience could offer him, and he resorts only to wild fantasies that have no precise aim. He has only contempt for philosophers, politicians, and thinkers ... It is for that reason that he wants to give it the means to crush all resistance, wherever it may come from. The individual exists only insofar as he places himself in the service of the German people. What does it matter if he suffers from hunger, thirst, woes of every kind? What does it matter if he is sacrificed, if he dies or is subjected to a thousand atrocities, provided the Hitlerian regime takes root in Germany? What does it matter if millions of others are also sacrificed so that German domination of the world can be established? ... I give thanks to God that I did not wait until the declaration of war to hate Hitler and his regime. In fact, I have hated them both since they made their appearance; I have resisted them with all my strength. I have always envisioned Hitler as a man whose conscience drips with blood, who considers nothing respectable or sacred, an enemy of the spirit, of humanity, of all the ideals of civilization. And now his acts and words confirm in everyone’s eyes what I had understood from the beginning of his fateful rise. It is therefore a duty more than a right for anyone who believes in spiritual, moral, and religious values, and in liberty, to stand up as the adversary of that man and that regime, and to mobilize every resource against both so that humanity may one day recover its civilization intact and its conscience in integrity.Political cartoons of Mussolini and Hitler &quot;combined an overall message of menace and threat with one of ridicule and clownishness&quot;.

=== Egyptian Socialists ===
The Egyptian left were motivated and encouraged by the Soviet Union&#x27;s fight against Nazi Germany. The Democratic Movement for National Liberation, founded by Henri Curiel and Iskra, founded by Hillel Schwartz used the economic and political condition of Egypt to spread Marxism.

== Material support ==
Despite not supplying troops on the frontlines, the Egyptian government were a key supporter of the British government during the war. The Egyptian government constructed the military barracks for the British troops, at the cost of 12 million Egyptian Pounds (EP), and fortifications and defense lines at 45,000,000 EP.

The Egyptian military played a supportive role for the British during the war. It was Egyptian soldiers who received the first attack when Italy invaded in September 1940. Egyptian anti-air support helped defend Egypt from Axis air raids on the Suez Canal. The German air force dropped anti-naval mines on the canal to sink British ships. Egyptian troops were posted along the Canal every 200 meters in order to keep watch, remove and destroy anti-naval mines dropped by the Axis planes. The army was also involved in training British forces in joint exercises, with some British officers remarking that the Egyptian army saved them two divisions. The Egyptian army suffered 1,125 fatalities and 1,308 injuries in the war.

The Egyptian navy was involved in transporting troops, ammunition and other supplies, wounded and prisoners of war. In addition, they participated in rescue missions to the Allied naval fleets. Egyptian military intelligence collected intel on the Axis from nomadic tribes across the Egyptian-Libyan border for the Allies. Responsibility for guarding prisoners of war was transferred to the Egyptian army, who collected, deported and guarded the prisoners.

Despite only having been created in 1937, the Egyptian Royal Air Force took part in defending the country. When the British Air Force encountered a shortage of pilots, Egyptian pilots took their place. A report published by the military delegation to Egypt in 1945, mentioned that in taking over the administration of the air power, the Egyptian army had saved Britain a thousand men that were deployed elsewhere in other areas. All engineers and pilots of Egypt Air, the commercial Egyptian Airline, joined the ranks of the British Forces. When British planes would crash in desert areas or other uninhabited locations, the responsibility of finding the aircraft and missing pilots fell on the Egyptian Camel Corps. Egyptian engineers were involved in de-mining fields, establishing and maintaining water pipelines between Sidi Abdel Qader and Mersa Matruh, so clean water was available to the Allied Forces, and also laying railroads tracks across the Western desert.

Egypt supplied over 65,000 tons of wheat and maize, 6,000 tons of corn, 4,000 tons of barley, 800 tons of wheat bran, 68,003 tons of sugar and 107,679 tons of rice. The Egyptian Agency for Land Survey also provided a vital role in mapping out the land for the British. The agency undertook geological and topographical studies of terrain and climate conditions, and valuable projects for water resources in the desert such as digging wells and testing the water for soldiers to be deployed to these areas. In total, the government prepared 2,739,678 maps for the entire British army. The government also printed 669,060 banknotes for the National Bank of Egypt, which were used to purchase supplies for the British but were never paid back, eventually leading to a financial crisis. It also printed millions of stamps for the governments of Iraq, Syria and eastern Jordan; and around a million and a half consular stamps for the Greek government in exile in Egypt, as well as 17 million Syrian banknotes of various denominations that were needed for the Allies. The Egyptian medical industry was utilized by the Allies to treat injured Allied soldiers and fight diseases.

== Italian invasion ==

The Italian invasion of Egypt began as a limited tactical operation towards Mersa Matruh, rather than for the strategic objectives sketched in Rome, due to the chronic lack of transport, fuel and wireless equipment, even with transfers from the 5th Army. Musaid was subjected to a &quot;spectacular&quot; artillery bombardment at dawn and occupied. The British withdrew past Buq Buq on 14 September but continued to harass the Italian advance. The British continued to fall back, going to Alam Hamid on the 15th and Alam el Dab on the 16th. An Italian force of fifty tanks attempted a flanking move, which led the British rearguard to retire east of Sidi Barrani. Graziani halted the advance.

Despite prodding from Mussolini, the Italians dug in around Sidi Barrani and Sofafi, about west of the British defences at Mersa Matruh. The British anticipated that the Italian advance would stop at Sidi Barrani and Sofafi and began to observe the positions. British naval and air operations continued to harass the Italian army as the 7th Armoured Division prepared to confront an advance on Matruh.

=== Italian defeat ===

Selby Force guarded the eastern approaches to Sidi Barrani, as the rest of the WDF attacked the fortified camps further inland. On 10 December, the 4th Armoured Brigade, which had been screening the attackers from a possible Italian counter-attack from the west, advanced northwards, cut the coast road between Sidi Barrani and Buq Buq, and sent armoured car patrols westwards. The 7th Armoured Brigade remained in reserve, and the 7th Support Group blocked an approach from Rabia and Sofafi to the south.

The 16th Brigade, supported by a squadron of Matilda II tanks, RAF aircraft, Royal Navy ships, and artillery fire, started its advance at . The fighting continued for many hours, without substantial gains, until when the Blackshirts holding two strongholds on the western side suddenly surrendered. The brigade continued advancing with the last of the Infantry tanks, an extra infantry battalion, and support from the 2nd Royal Tank Regiment.

The second attack began just after . Italian artillery opened fire on the infantry as they were dismounting. The last ten Matildas drove into the western face of the Sidi Barrani defences, and although they were met by Italian artillery, it was ineffective. At 6:00 p.m., approximately surrendered. In two hours, the first objectives had been captured; only a sector east of the harbour, held by a Blackshirt legion and the remains of the 1st Libyan Division, was still resisting. The British continued advancing until they reached Mersa Brega by February, 1941.

== German intervention ==

Adolf Hitler sent his army to North Africa starting in February 1941 (see Operation Sonnenblume). Nazi Germany&#x27;s General Erwin Rommel&#x27;s Deutsches Afrikakorps coming from victories at Tobruk in Libya, and in a classic &quot;blitzkrieg&quot;, comprehensively outfought British forces. Within weeks the British had been pushed back into Egypt. It was during this time that Einsatzgruppe Egypt, a Nazi SS unit, was founded with the purpose of genociding the Jews of Egypt and Palestine, though it never left for Egypt.

===German defeat===
Rommel&#x27;s offensive was eventually stopped at the small railway halt of El Alamein, 150 miles from Cairo. In July 1942 Rommel lost the First Battle of El Alamein, largely due to the problem of an extended supply line which troubled both sides throughout the war in Egypt. The British were now very close to their supplies and had fresh troops on hand. In early September 1942 Rommel tried again to break through the British lines during the Battle of Alam el Halfa. He was decisively stopped by the newly arrived British commander, Lieutenant General Bernard Montgomery.

With British forces from Malta interdicting his supplies at sea, and the massive distances they had to cover in the desert, Rommel could not hold the El Alamein position forever. Still, it took a large set piece battle from late October to early November 1942, the Second Battle of El Alamein, to defeat the Germans forcing them to retreat westwards towards Libya and Tunisia.

===Egyptian participation===
Although Egypt remained formally neutral, its forces formed part of the British Military Operations Zone and some British forces were stationed there, many Egyptian Army units also fought alongside them. Some units like 9th, 10th, 11th and 12th Infantry Regiments, 16th and 12th Cavalry Regiments, 17th Horse Artillery Regiment, and 22nd King&#x27;s Own Artillery Regiment. Some other units also fought but its names are unknown. Beside these units, the Anti-Aircraft Artillery Regiments all over Egypt played a vital role in destroying Luftwaffe attacks on Alexandria, Cairo, Suez, and Northern Delta.

== Allied victory ==

The leadership of the United Kingdom&#x27;s General Bernard Montgomery at the Second Battle of El Alamein, or the &quot;Battle of Alamein&quot;, marked a significant turning point of World War II and was the first major victory by British Commonwealth forces over the German Army. The battle lasted from 23 October to 3 November 1942. Following the First Battle of El Alamein, which had stalled the Axis advance, British general Bernard Montgomery took command of the Eighth Army from Claude Auchinleck in August 1942. Success in the battle turned the tide in the North African Campaign. Some historians believe that the battle, along with the Battle of Stalingrad, were the two major Allied victories that contributed to the eventual defeat of Nazi Germany.

By July 1942, the German Afrika Korps under General Rommel had struck deep into Egypt, threatening the vital Allied supply line across the Suez Canal. Faced with overextended supply lines and lack of reinforcements and yet well aware of massive Allied reinforcements arriving, Rommel decided to strike at the Allies while their build-up was still not complete. This attack on 30 August 1942 at Alam Halfa failed, and expecting a counterattack by Montgomery&#x27;s Eighth Army, the Afrika Korps dug in. After six more weeks of building up forces, the Eighth Army was ready to strike. 200,000 men and 1,000 tanks under Montgomery made their move against the 100,000 men and 500 tanks of the Afrika Korps.

=== The Allied plan ===
With Operation Lightfoot, Montgomery hoped to cut two corridors through the Axis minefields in the north. Armour would then pass through and defeat the German armour. Diversionary attacks in the south would keep the rest of the Axis forces from moving northwards. Montgomery expected a twelve-day battle in three stages — &quot;The break-in, the dog-fight and the final break of the enemy.&quot;

The Commonwealth forces practised a number of deceptions in the months prior to the battle to wrong-foot the Axis command, not only as to the exact whereabouts of the forthcoming battle, but as to when the battle was likely to occur. This operation was codenamed, Operation Bertram. A dummy pipeline was built, stage by stage, the construction of which would lead the Axis to believe the attack would occur much later than it in fact did, and much further south. To further the illusion, dummy tanks made of plywood frames placed over jeeps were constructed and deployed in the south. In a reverse feint, the tanks for battle in the north were disguised as supply lorries by placing a removable plywood superstructure over them.

The Axis were dug-in along two lines, called by the Allies the &quot;Oxalic Line&quot; and the &quot;Pierson Line&quot;. They had laid around half a million mines, mainly anti-tank, in what was called the Devil&#x27;s gardens.

=== The battle ===

The battle opened at 2140 hours on 23 October with a sustained artillery barrage. The initial objective was the Oxalic Line with the armour intending to advance over this and on to the Pierson Line. However, the minefields were not yet fully cleared when the assault began.

On the first night, the assault to create the northern corridor fell three miles short of the Pierson line. Further south, they had made better progress but were stalled at Miteirya Ridge.

On 24 October, the Axis commander, General Stumme (Rommel was on sick leave in Austria), died of a heart attack while under fire. After a period of confusion, while Stumme&#x27;s body was missing, General Ritter von Thoma took command of the Axis forces. Hitler initially instructed Rommel to remain at home and continue his convalescence but then became alarmed at the deteriorating situation and asked Rommel to return to Africa if he felt able. Rommel left at once and arrived on 25 October.

For the Allies in the south, after another abortive assault on the Miteirya Ridge, the attack was abandoned. Montgomery switched the focus of the attack to the north. There was a successful night attack over the 25–26th. Rommel&#x27;s immediate counter-attack was without success. The Allies had lost 6,200 men against Axis losses of 2,500, but while Rommel had only 370 tanks fit for action, Montgomery still had over 900.

Montgomery felt that the offensive was losing momentum and decided to regroup. There were a number of small actions but, by 29 October, the Axis line was still intact. Montgomery was still confident and prepared his forces for &quot;Operation Supercharge&quot;. The endless small operations and the attrition by the Allied airforce had by then reduced Rommel&#x27;s effective tank strength to only 102.

The second major Allied offensive of the battle was along the coast, initially to capture the Rahman Track and then take the high ground at Tel el Aqqaqir. The attack began on 2 November 1942. By the 3rd, Rommel had only 35 tanks fit for action. Despite containing the Allied advance, the pressure on his forces made a retreat necessary. However, the same day Rommel received a &quot;victory or death&quot; message from Hitler, halting the withdrawal. But the Allied pressure was too great, and the German forces had to withdraw on the night of 3–4 November. By 6 November, the Axis forces were in full retreat and over 30,000 soldiers had surrendered.

=== Aftermath ===

==== Churchill&#x27;s summation ====
Winston Churchill famously summed up the battle on 10 November 1942 with the words, &quot;now this is not the end, it is not even the beginning of the end. But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning&quot;.

The battle was Montgomery&#x27;s greatest triumph. He took the title &quot;Viscount Montgomery of Alamein&quot; when he was raised to the peerage.

The Torch landings in Morocco later that month marked the effective end of the Axis threat in North Africa.

== Egyptian fleet damages ==

<text>The Leonardo da Vinci Art Institute was an Italian art institute located in Cairo, Egypt during World War II.

==History==

The institute was founded in the 1930s to provide evening classes in painting, drawing and sculpture under the auspices of the Italian consulate in Cairo as well as the Italian cultural centre in Cairo are keeping quiet about the Institute&#x27;s nature and history of existence.

Most students there did not know the value of its certification nationally or internationally. It was transformed from an Italian technical high school to a higher education institute offering graduate certification in each of its two sections, Architecture and Painting/Decoration.

The institute became a school for Egyptian society&#x27;s elites primarily Cairo&#x27;s elite. Upper and upper middle class students with unique and independent approaches to their education who did not find an answer to their educational needs in the Egyptian high school system entered a special, individual, and nurturing environment in the institute.

The institute had teachers and instructors, some of whom were from the old Italian traditional fascist era. Teachers escaping the turmoil in their homeland and others were purposely placed at this location by a hierarchy to protect and conserve their traditional treasures during turbulent times in Europe.

==Relationship with Dante Alighieri Institute==
It was also speculated not documented that it was created under the auspices of the Dante Alighieri Society, which was established in Rome in 1889 to &quot;preserve and spread the Italian language and culture in the world&quot;. In Egypt, its first committees were born in Alexandria and in Cairo in 1896.

During the first postwar period, the head office in Cairo started to promote and to teach Italian arts and literature to hundreds of students in Cairo, Alexandria and Suez. In the aftermath of World War II, the Dante Alighieri Institute restarted its activities and opened the Claudio Monteverdi Conservatoire.

<text>Thomas Nicholas Scortia (August 29, 1926 – April 29, 1986) was an American science fiction author. He collaborated on several works with fellow author Frank M. Robinson. He sometimes used the pseudonyms &quot;Scott Nichols&quot;, &quot;Gerald MacDow&quot;, and &quot;Arthur R. Kurtz&quot;.

==Biography==
Scortia was born in Alton, Illinois. He attended Washington University in St. Louis, where he earned a degree in chemistry in 1949. He worked for a number of aerospace companies during the 1950s and 1960s/early 1970s, and held a patent for the fuel used by one of the Jupiter fly-by missions.

Scortia had been writing in his spare time while still working in the aerospace field. When the industry began to see increased unemployment in the early 1970s, Scortia decided to try his hand at full-time writing. His novel, &quot;The Glass Inferno&quot; (in collaboration with Frank M. Robinson) was, in combination with the novel &quot;The Tower&quot; by Richard Martin Stern, the basis for the 1974 film &quot;The Towering Inferno&quot;. Scortia also collaborated with Dalton Trumbo on the novel &quot;The Endangered Species.&quot;

Scortia died in La Verne, California on April 29, 1986 while being treated for leukemia.

Harlan Ellison credited Scortia with having &quot;literally saved [Ellison] from being courtmartialed back in 1958&quot;.

<doc id="206009" wikidata="Q380412" url="?curid=206009" title="Jewish Institute for National Security of America">
<text>The Jewish Institute for National Security of America (JINSA), formerly named the Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs, is a Washington, D.C.–based, non-profit and think tank. 

==History==
JINSA was founded in 1976, three years after the Yom Kippur War. JINSA&#x27;s founding, according to Jason Vest, writing in &quot;The Nation&quot;, was prompted by &quot;neoconservatives concerned that the United States might not be able to provide Israel with adequate military supplies in the event of another Arab-Israeli war.&quot;

JINSA since expanded its portfolio to cover not only Israel-U.S. relations, but general American national security policy as well.

In the late 1980s, JINSA underwent a profound repurposing of mission which, although retaining the interest in maintaining and strengthening the U.S.–Israeli defense relationship, widened its focus to general U.S. defense and foreign policy, with missions and meetings with national leaders and officials Ethiopia, Belgium, South Korea, India, Bulgaria, Italy, the Republic of China, Uzbekistan, Costa Rica, Spain, Eritrea, Jordan, the People&#x27;s Republic of China, Hungary, United Kingdom and Germany.

Shoshana Bryen was JINSA&#x27;s executive director from 1989 to 1991. She was credited with transforming JINSA from a small think tank into a major player in the conservative scene in Washington, D.C. Tom Neumann became executive director in 1991, serving until 2012. Larry Greenfield was named executive director in 2012. Scholar Michael Makovsky joined as CEO and executive director in 2023 from the Bipartisan Policy Center, where he was director of foreign policy from 2006 to 2013.

In 2012, JINSA launched the Latino-Jewish Alliance to engage the U.S. Latino community on Israeli defense and security topics.

===Policy positions===
One of JINSA&#x27;s main goals is to cement strong military cooperation between Israel and the United States by working with the American defense establishment. It emphasizes strong U.S. military capabilities and close military cooperation between Israel and the United States.

JINSA is considered one of the most prominent and leading conservative think tanks, known for its hawkish foreign policy views. The group is non-partisan and includes Republicans and Democrats on its advisory board.

Since 2018, JINSA has advocated for a U.S.-Israel mutual defense pact. In July 2019, JINSA created a draft treaty, which was discussed during a December 2019 meeting between U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu discussed a draft of such an agreement that was originally proposed by JINSA. In September 2023, JINA renewed its campaign to a defense pact.

On March 20, 2023, JINSA issued an open letter, first appearing in &quot;The Hill&quot;, signed by 44 retired U.S. generals and admirals calling on the White House and Congress to &quot;immediately provide Israel with the advanced weapons it needs to deter and prevent a nuclear Iran.&quot;

JINSA supported President George W. Bush&#x27;s policies in two regards, advocating the need for regime change in Iraq, cultivating close ties with Ahmed Chalabi. and supporting American funding for opposition groups in Iran.

JINSA has supported Azerbaijan in its war against Armenia as a means to weaken Iran, regardless of accusations of ethnic cleansing of Armenians by Azerbaijan (see Flight of Nagorno-Karabakh Armenians), nor their genocidal rhetoric towards Armenia. JINSA president Michael Makovsky has stated in a conversation with the Azerbaijani ambassador to the United States: &quot;Whatever it&#x27;s worth, at JINSA, we believe that America has stronger strategic ties with Azerbaijan.&quot;

==Programs==
JINSA organizes trips of U.S. military officers, retired U.S. military flag and general officers, and students at U.S. military academies to Israel. In February 2023, a JINSA-organized delegation of 30 U.S. military officers visited Israel Aerospace Industries, one of Israel&#x27;s largest technology employers. According to &quot;The Nation&quot;, &quot;JINSA facilitates meetings between Israeli officials and the still-influential US flag officers, who, upon their return to the States, happily write op-eds and sign letters and advertisements championing the Likudnik line.&quot;

More than 200 retired admirals and generals, including shock and awe theorist Adm. Leon &quot;Bud&quot; Edney, USN, Lt. Gen. Jay Garner, USA, Maj. Gen. David L. Grange, USA, Maj. Gen. Jarvis Lynch, USMC, Maj. Gen. Sidney Shachnow, USA, Adm. Leighton &quot;Snuffy&quot; Smith, USN, Adm. Carlisle Trost, USN and Brig. Gen. Thomas E. White, USA, have participated in the trips over the last 21 years. Participation in the program makes no requirements of the invitees to make statements, form opinions or maintain any further relationship with JINSA, yet many trip alums have participated more than once, and 50 past participants co-authored a statement on violence in the Palestinian-controlled territories that appeared in &quot;The New York Times&quot; in October 2000.

The program also includes activities designed to introduce the cadets and midshipmen to the many cultures that make up Israeli society, and organize visits to historic and religious sites.

===Homeland Security Program===
In 2002 JINSA initiated a program called LEEP (Law Enforcement Exchange Program) aimed at exchanging counter-terrorism experience and tactics between U.S. law enforcement agencies and their counterparts in the Israeli National Police. The primary focus of the program is to bring U.S. law enforcement executives (police chiefs, sheriffs, etc.) to Israel for an intensive program aimed at educating U.S. officials on techniques for countering domestic terrorism in the United States. From 2002 to 2020 over 200 U.S. federal, state, county and municipal law enforcement executives have been enrolled in the program, involving visits to Israel, together with thousands of US security personnel attending conferences where visiting Israeli experts have spoken. According to Max Blumenthal in his book &quot;The Management of Savagery&quot;, JINSA has claimed that it has overseen the training of over 9,000 US police officials by Israeli-led experts. Blumenthal cited one US enforcement superintendent in 2004 these exchanges changed the way Homeland Security was being organized in New Jersey. The US-Israeli anthropologist, Jeff Halper co-founder of ICAHD and supporter of the BDS movement, in an article for &quot;Mondoweiss&quot; criticized these programmes, as based on military techniques developed to control the Palestinians in the Israeli occupied territories, as threatening to lead to an &#x27;Israelization&#x27; of American police forces and a concomitant &#x27;Palestinization&#x27; of the American people.

===Publications===

JINSA publishes semi-annual &quot;Journal of International Security Affairs&quot;. From 2016 the magazine became a free publication. For 22 years, JINSA published &quot;Security Affairs&quot; – a monthly newsletter. Apart from magazines and newsletters, the institute also publishes conference proceedings and monographs. In 2004, JINSA published a reference book: &quot;Profiles in Terror: A Guide to Middle East Terrorist Organizations&quot; by Aaron Mannes.

===Awards===
Each fall, JINSA presents an annual &quot;Henry M. &quot;Scoop&quot; Jackson Distinguished Service Award&quot;, named in honor of the late-Senator Henry M. &quot;Scoop&quot; Jackson to U.S. government leaders (generally a senior U.S. Government or Armed Forces official, a Senator or two Members of the United States House of Representatives) for their career dedication to U.S. national security.

<text>Project management software are computer programs that help plan, organize, and manage resources. 

Depending on the sophistication of the software, it can manage estimation and planning, scheduling, cost control, budget management, resource allocation, collaboration software, communication, decision-making, quality management, time management and documentation or administration systems. 

Numerous PC and browser-based project management software and contract management software products and services are available.

==History==

===Predecessors===
The first historically relevant year for the development of project management software was 1896, marked by the introduction of the Harmonogram. Polish economist Karol Adamiecki attempted to display task development in a floating chart and laid the foundation for project management software as it is today. In 1912, Henry Gantt replaced the Harmonogram with the more advanced Gantt chart, a scheduling diagram that broke ship design tasks down for the purposes of Hoover Dam in early 1931. Today&#x27;s Gantt charts are almost the same as their original counterparts and are a part of many project management systems.

===Emergence of the term &quot;project management&quot; and modernized techniques===
The term &quot;project management&quot; was not used prior to 1954 when US Air Force General Bernard Adolph Schriever introduced it for military purposes. In the years to follow, project management gained relevance in the business world — a trend that had a lot to do with the formation of the American Association of Engineers AACE (1956), and Rang and DuPont&#x27;s Critical Path Method, which has been used to calculate project duration ever since 1957.

The trend is also related to the appearance of the Program Evaluation Review Technique (PERT) in 1958. PERT advanced project monitoring, enabling users to simultaneously monitor tasks, evaluate their quality, and estimate the time needed to accomplish each of them. Like Gantt charts and CPM, PERT was invented for military purposes, this time for the US Navy Polaris missile submarine program.

In 1965, there was a new improvement in project management technology. The US Department of Defense presented the work breakdown structure (WBS) to dissolve projects into even smaller visual units, organizing them in a hierarchical tree structure. WBS was an inspiration for Winston Royce’s Waterfall Method (1970) where management phases are organized in a way that doesn’t allow a new task to begin before the previous ones are completed. 

===The first project management products and associations===
In the period between 1965 and 1969, two of the leading project management associations were formed: the International Project Management Association (IPMA) in Europe, and the Project Management Institute (PMI) which trains project management professionals and issues certificates. With businesses shifting towards technology-based and paperless methods, the first project management systems started to emerge. Oracle and Artemis launched their project managers in 1977, while Scitor Corporation did the same in 1979. Many improvements followed in the upcoming decades. In 1986, Carnegie Mellon University’s Software Engineering Institute introduced capability maturity software, a five-level project management method for rapidly maturing processes, while in 1988, users were introduced to earned value management which added processes’ scope and cost to the schedule. The trend continued with PRINCE2 (1996) which increased the number of processes to seven, because of which developers considered designing products for managing complex projects. In 2001, they adopted the Agile project management concept and focused on adaptive planning and flexible response to changes. In 2006, users were already able to trigger total cost management, a framework that helps control and reduce costs in project management.

==Tasks and activities==

===Scheduling===
One of the most common project management software tool types is scheduling tools. Scheduling tools are used to sequence project activities and assign dates and resources to them. The detail and sophistication of a schedule produced by a scheduling tool can vary considerably with the project management methodology used, the features provided and the scheduling methods supported. Scheduling tools may include support for:
* Multiple dependency relationship types between activities.
* Resource assignment and leveling
* Critical path 
* Activity duration estimation and probability-based simulation
* Activity cost accounting.

===Providing information===

Project planning software can be expected to provide information to various people or stakeholders, and can be used to measure and justify the level of effort required to complete the project(s). Typical requirements might include:
* Overview information on how long tasks will take to complete.
* Early warning of any risks to the project.
* Information on workload, for planning holidays.
* Evidence.
* Historical information on how projects have progressed, and in particular, how actual and planned performance are related.
* Optimum utilization of available resources.
* Cost maintenance.
* Collaboration with each teammate and customer.
* Instant communication with collaborators and customers.

==Types==

===Collaborative===

A collaborative system is designed to support multiple users modifying different sections of the plan at once; for example, updating the areas they personally are responsible for such that those estimates get integrated into the overall plan. Web-based tools, including extranets, generally fall into this category, but have the limitation that they can only be used when the user has live Internet access. To address this limitation, some software tools using client–server architecture provide a rich client that runs on users&#x27; desktop computer and replicates project and task information to other project team members through a central server when users connect periodically to the network. Some tools allow team members to check out their schedules (and others&#x27; as read only) to work on them while not on the network. When reconnecting to the database, all changes are synchronized with the other schedules.

=== Visual ===
A common problem in project management is a difficulty with both viewing and understanding large amounts of fluctuating project data. To tackle this, some project management software utilize information visualization, so that users can more easily find, analyze and make changes to their data. To avoid information overload, the visualization mantra of “overview first, zoom and filter, then details on demand” is often followed.

However, for legal or cultural reasons, establishments often describe themselves as massage parlors, bars, strip clubs, body rub parlours, studios, or by some other description. Sex work in a brothel is considered safer than street prostitution.

== Legal status==

On 2 December 1949, the United Nations General Assembly approved the Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others. The convention came into effect on 25 July 1951 and by December 2013, had been ratified by 82 states. The convention seeks to combat prostitution, which it regards as &quot;incompatible with the dignity and worth of the human person.&quot; Parties to the convention agreed to abolish regulation of individual prostitutes, and to ban brothels and procuring. Some countries not parties to the convention also ban prostitution or the operation of brothels. Various United Nations commissions, however, have differing positions on the issue. For example, in 2012, a Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) convened by Ban Ki-moon and backed by United Nations Development Programme and UNAIDS, recommended decriminalization of brothels and procuring.
In the European Union, there is no uniform policy and no consensus on the issue; and laws vary widely from country to country. Germany and the Netherlands have the most liberal policies; in Sweden (and in Norway and Iceland outside the EU) the buying, but not selling, of sex, is illegal; in most former Communist countries the laws target the prostitutes; while in countries such as the UK (except Northern Ireland), Italy, and Spain the act of prostitution is not itself illegal, but soliciting, pimping and brothels are, making it difficult to engage in prostitution without breaking any law. The European Women&#x27;s Lobby condemns prostitution as &quot;an intolerable form of male violence&quot; and supports the &quot;Swedish model&quot;.

In February 2014, the members of the European Parliament voted in a non-binding resolution, (adopted by 343 votes to 139; with 105 abstentions), in favor of the &quot;Swedish Model&quot; of criminalizing the buying, but not the selling, of sex.

Prostitution and the operation of brothels is illegal in many countries, though known illegal brothels may be tolerated or laws not strictly enforced. Such situations exist in many parts of the world, but the region most often associated with these policies is Asia. When brothels are illegal they may nevertheless operate in the guise of a legitimate business, such as massage parlors, saunas or spas.

In a few countries, prostitution and operating a brothel is legal and regulated. The degree of regulation varies widely by country. Most of these countries allow brothels, at least in theory, as they are considered to be less problematic than street prostitution. In parts of Australia, brothels are legal and regulated. Regulation includes planning controls and licensing and registration requirements, and there may be other restrictions. However, the existence of licensed brothels does not stop illegal brothels from operating. According to a report in the Australian &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;, illegal brothels in Sydney in 2009 outnumbered licensed operations by four to one; while in Queensland only 10% of prostitution happens in licensed brothels, with the rest being either independent sex workers (which is legal) or illegal operations.

The introduction of legal brothels in Queensland was to help improve the safety of sex workers, punters (customers of prostitution), and the community at large and reduce crime. This may have been successful in many ways in Queensland, with The Viper Room being one of the most well known, clean, safe and most highly regarded brothels in Brisbane and Queensland. The Netherlands has one of the most liberal prostitution policies in the world, and attracts sex tourists from many other countries. Amsterdam is well known for its red-light district and is a destination for sex tourism. Germany also has very liberal prostitution laws. The largest brothel in Europe is the Pascha in Cologne. Although the Dumas Hotel in Butte, Montana operated legally from 1890 until 1982, brothels are currently illegal throughout the United States, except in 10 rural counties in Nevada. Prostitution outside of the 19 licensed brothels operating in 6 of those 10 counties is illegal throughout the state. All forms of prostitution are illegal in Clark County, which contains the Las Vegas–Paradise metropolitan area.

==History==
The earliest recorded mention of prostitution as an occupation appears in Sumerian records from and describes a temple-bordello operated by Sumerian priests in the city of Uruk. The &#x27;kakum&#x27; or temple was dedicated to the goddess Ishtar and housed three classes of women. The first group performed only in the temple sex-rites; the second group had the run of the grounds and catered to its visitors as well, and the third and lowest class lived on the temple grounds but were free to seek out customers in the streets. In later years, sacred prostitution and similar classifications of women existed in Greece, Rome, India, China, and Japan.

===Europe===
State brothels/bordellos with regulated prices existed in ancient Athens, created by the legendary lawmaker Solon. These brothels catered to a predominantly male clientele, with women of all ages and young men providing sexual services (see Prostitution in ancient Greece). In ancient Rome female slaves were forced to provide sexual services for soldiers, with brothels being located close to barracks and city walls. Brothels existed everywhere. The custom was to display lit candles to signal that they were open.

Before the appearance of effective contraception, infanticide was common in brothels. Unlike usual infanticide—where girls were more likely to be killed at birth— a brothel site at Ashkelon in Israel revealed that nearly all of the babies were boys.
Cities first began setting up municipal brothels between 1350 and 1450 CE. Municipalities often owned, operated, and regulated the legal brothels. Governments would designate certain streets where a keeper could open a brothel. These sections of town were the precursors to so-called &quot;red light districts&quot;. Not only did the towns restrict where a keeper could open a brothel, but they also put constraints on when the brothel could be open. For example, most brothels were forbidden to be open on Sundays and religious holidays. Some scholars believe these restrictions were enforced to make the prostitutes go to church but others argue that it was to keep parishioners in church and out of the brothels. Either way, it was a day providing no revenue for the keeper.

Although brothels were set up as a sexual outlet for men, not all men were allowed to enter them. Clerics, married men, and Jews were prohibited. Often, foreigners such as sailors and traders were the main source of revenue. Local men who frequented the brothels were mainly single; laws restricting the patrons were not always enforced. Government officials or police would periodically search the brothels to reduce the number of prohibited customers. However, since the government was so closely related to the church, common punishments were minor. These restrictions were put in place to protect the wives of married men from infections.
Multiple restrictions were placed on the residents of brothels. One limitation prohibited prostitutes from borrowing money from their brothel keeper. Prostitutes paid high prices to the brothel keeper for the basic necessities of room and board, clothes, and toiletries. Room and board pricing was often set by the local government but the price for everything else could add up to a common woman&#x27;s entire earnings. Prostitutes were sometimes prohibited from having a special lover. Some regulations put on prostitutes were made to protect their clients. A woman was kicked out if she was found to have a sexually transmitted disease. The prostitutes were not allowed to pull men into the brothel by their clothing, harass them in the street, or detain them over unpaid debts. Clothing worn by prostitutes was regulated and had to be distinguishable from that of respectable women. In some places, a prostitute had to have a yellow stripe on her clothing while in others red was the differentiating color. Other towns required harlots to don special headdresses or restricted the wardrobe of proper women. The restrictions placed on prostitutes were put in place not only to protect them but also nearby citizens.

Because of a syphilis epidemic throughout Europe, many brothels were shut down during the end of the Middle Ages. This epidemic had been brought on by Spanish and French military pillages after the return of Christopher Columbus from the newly discovered Americas. The church and citizens alike feared that men who frequented brothels would bring the disease home and infect morally upright people.

From the 12th century, brothels in London were located in a district known as the Liberty of the Clink. This area was traditionally under the authority of the Bishop of Winchester, not the civil authorities. From 1161, the bishop was granted the power to license prostitutes and brothels in the district. This gave rise to the slang term &quot;Winchester Goose&quot; for a prostitute. Women who worked in these brothels were denied Christian burial and buried in the unconsecrated graveyard known as Cross Bones.


By the 16th century, the area was also home to many theatres, (including the Globe Theatre, associated with William Shakespeare), but brothels continued to thrive. A famous London brothel of the time was &quot;Holland&#x27;s Leaguer&quot;. Patrons supposedly included James I of England and his favourite, George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham. It was located in a street that still bears its name and also inspired the 1631 play, &quot;Holland&#x27;s Leaguer&quot;. Charles I of England licensed a number of brothels including the Silver Cross Tavern in London, which retains its license to the modern day because it was never revoked.

The authorities of Medieval Paris followed the same path as those in London and attempted to confine prostitution to a particular district. Louis IX (1226–1270) designated nine streets in the Beaubourg Quartier where it would be permitted. In the early part of the 19th century, state-controlled legal brothels (then known as &quot;&quot;maisons de tolérance&quot; or &quot;maisons closes&quot;&quot;) started to appear in several French cities. By law, they had to be run by a woman (typically a former prostitute) and their external appearance had to be discreet. The &quot;maisons&quot; were required to light a red lantern when they were open (from which is derived the term red-light district) and the prostitutes were only permitted to leave the &quot;maisons&quot; on certain days and only if accompanied by its head. By 1810, Paris alone had 180 officially approved brothels.

During the first half of the 20th century, some Paris brothels, such as le Chabanais and le Sphinx, were internationally known for the luxury they provided. The French government sometimes included a visit to the &quot;Chabanais&quot; as part of the program for foreign guests of state, disguising it as a &quot;visit with the President of the Senate&quot; in the official program. The &quot;Hotel Marigny&quot;, established in 1917 in the 2nd arrondissement of Paris, was one of several that were well known for catering to gay male clients. Premises suspected of being gay brothels, including the Hotel Marigny were, however, subject to frequent police raids, perhaps indicating less tolerance for them from the authorities.
In most European countries, brothels were made illegal after World War II. France outlawed brothels in 1946, after a campaign by Marthe Richard. The backlash against them was in part due to their wartime collaboration with the Germans during the occupation of France. Twenty-two Paris brothels had been commandeered by the Germans for their exclusive use; some had made a great deal of money by catering for German officers and soldiers. One brothel in the Montmartre District of the French capital was part of an escape network for POWs and downed airmen.

Italy made brothels illegal in 1959. The 2010s decade has seen the introduction of sex dolls and sexbots on the premises of some brothels.

===East Asia===
Prostitution has existed in ancient China, but it was the politician Guan Zhong (管仲) who planned the brothel system. During the Spring and Autumn period in 645 BC, Qi politician Guan Zhong proposed to set up brothels in the city, and the operation of brothels was officially approved. As many as 700 women were entered into the brothels to work as prostitutes. Guan Zhong named this kind of brothel &quot;Nvlv (女闾)&quot;. Most prostitutes in ancient China came from very poor families and were sold to brothels by their families to work as prostitution. Prostitutes may also be asked by their families to prostitution secretly outside brothels. Some girls are brought to brothels as children begging. There are also women who are resold to brothels by their husbands or lured to brothels by traffickers. The living conditions of prostitutes are not good, but the living conditions of prostitutes in high-end brothels are better than those in low-end brothels. Prostitutes in high-end brothels sell sex to wealthy and educated clients, so some prostitutes will learn some art-related content. However, high-end brothels are still places of prostitution, and prostitutes also take prostitution as their main job. Their performances have a lot of pornographic content, and performances are not a professional field. In ancient China, brothels had different names, and each dynasty may have different names. There were also singing and dancing places in ancient China. These singing and dancing places also had different names, and the names also changed in different dynasties. Song and dance venues in ancient China were not brothels. Gējì were professional female song and dance performers, they were not prostitutes, most Geji did not engage in prostitution. Geji in ancient China catered to famous poets and nobles. In addition to performing songs and dances, they would also have these men talk about poetry and have pleasant conversations. Prostitution was rarely found, but they would also develop romantic relationships with these men. This Geji culture in ancient China died out systematically during the late Qing dynasty and the Republic of China. Male prostitution also existed in ancient China; open male brothels generally appeared in the Ming and Qing dynasties, and such male brothels were officially similar to semi-open in ancient times. Male prostitutes in male brothels will also learn some arts, but like prostitutes, they are not professional performers. Male prostitutes learn arts to increase the price of prostitution, and their job content is to engage in prostitution. Male performers who are not involved in prostitution are often reluctant to associate with such male prostitutes and openly distance themselves from them. The number of male brothels and male prostitutes is far less than that of female ones, but male brothels only sell sex to wealthy male clients. During the Republic of China, due to social unrest and other problems, there were a large number of brothels and prostitutes in China. After the founding of New China, brothels were closed and prostitution and whoring were made illegal. New China treated prostitutes for sexually transmitted diseases, provided psychological counseling, taught them work skills, and arranged legitimate jobs for them to change careers.

 were legal red-light districts in Japanese history, where both brothels and prostitutes, known collectively as yūjo(遊女), the higher ranks of which were known as oiran recognised by the Japanese government operated. Though prostitution was, officially, legal to engage in and pay for only in these areas, there were a number of places where prostitutes and brothels operated illegally. Yoshiwara was home to some 1,750 women in the 18th century, with records of some 3,000 women from all over Japan at one time. Many were typically indentured to their brothel; if indentured by their parents, a larger advance payment would often be received. Though contracts of indenture often did not last more than five to ten years, the debt sometimes accrued by these women could keep them working there for much longer. Many women also died of sexually transmitted diseases, or following failed abortions, before completing their contracts.

The Yinjian teahouse (阴间茶室) refers to a male brothel that provided same-sex sexual services to men during the Edo period in Japan. Male prostitutes in brothels mainly serve male customers, but occasionally there are a few female customers. Male prostitutes in male brothels are generally between 13 and 20 years old. In Japanese history, many geishas were not prostitutes, and geisha houses were different from brothels. The geisha of Japan emphasized good table manners, artistic skills, elegant styling, and sophisticated, tactical conversational skills.

In Korean history, there were brothels where prostitutes worked as prostitution. There are also kisaeng performing arts venues that provide performances.

===India===
The governments of many Indian princely states had regulated prostitution in India prior to the 1860s. The British Raj enacted the Cantonment Act of 1864 to regulate prostitution in colonial India as a matter of accepting a necessary evil so that the British soldiers could seek sexual gratification when away from their homes. The Cantonment Acts regulated and structured prostitution in the British military bases which provided for about twelve to fifteen Indian women kept in brothels called &quot;chaklas&quot; for each regiment of thousand British soldiers. They were licensed by military officials and were allowed to consort with soldiers only.

Brothels in India came into life in the early 1920s, when dance styles in states like Maharashtra, such as &quot;Lavani&quot;, and dance-drama performance artists, &quot;called Tamasha&quot; artists, starting working as prostitutes. Such professions were strongly connected to caste and income levels.

===United States===

From 1911 to 1913, the United States Department of Justice counted the numbers of prostitutes in brothels to use the data against the much-feared &quot;White Slave Traffic&quot;. This effort collected information from 318 cities of 26 Eastern states. It estimated about 100,000 women to be working in brothels, yet some estimated the total number of prostitutes to be as high as 500,000.

During the late nineteenth century, brothels in the United States were no secret. George Kneeland articulated his growing concern about the organized sex business in America well, saying that prostitution had grown into a &quot;highly commercialized and profitable business that penetrated the deepest recesses of the political, cultural and economic life of the city.&quot; Brothels were commonly referred to as &quot;disorderly houses&quot;, and their residents were called by many names, some euphemistic—e.g., &quot;abandoned woman&quot;, &quot;bawd good-time daisy&quot;, &quot;fallen angel&quot;, &quot;fille de joie&quot;, &quot;jeweled bird&quot;, &quot;lady of the evening&quot;, &quot;shady lady&quot;, &quot;soiled dove&quot;, &quot;wanton woman&quot;, and &quot;woman of the town&quot;—and some less kind—e.g., &quot;hooker&quot;, &quot;slut&quot;, and &quot;whore&quot;. As the 19th century went on, prostitution as a profession became more common, rather than just occasionally necessitated soliciting. As a result of these changes, the way prostitution was practiced changed. Many prostitutes still practiced their trade independently, but the new class of professional prostitutes created a demand for a location to do their regular business, and the brothel served this purpose.
Visitors could easily find disorderly houses by opening up the local or statewide directories, such as the 1895 &quot;Travelers&#x27; Guide of Colorado&quot;. This 66-page manual helped the interested client decide which brothel was right for him. These manuals did not attract by using euphemistic language, and though bold by standards of the time, were not crude. Some examples read: &quot;Twenty young ladies engaged nightly to entertain guest&quot;, and &quot;Strangers cordially welcome&quot;. In some areas, brothels simply could not be ignored. A nineteenth-century authority describes the city of New Orleans as such: &quot;The extent of licentiousness and prostitution here is truly appalling and doubtless without a parallel in the whole civilized world. The indulgence and practice are so general and common that men seldom seek to cover up their acts or go in disguise.&quot;

The average house held five to twenty working girls; some higher-end brothels also employed staff servants, musicians, and a bouncer. The typical brothel contained several bedrooms, all furnished. Some upscale brothels were much larger; such is the case with that owned by Mary Ann Hall of Arlington, Virginia. It is described as &quot;a rather grand house with twenty-five rooms and was enclosed by a brick wall. The interior was elegantly furnished. The principal rooms on the first floor contained large oil paintings, Brussels carpets, red plush &#x27;parlor furniture&#x27;, étagères (a shelf for small ornaments), and numerous items of silver plate.&quot; An archeological dig of the area outside of Mary Ann Hall&#x27;s estate revealed refuse of a quality superior to that in surrounding working-class areas. This included many champagne bottles and corks, wire cages from such bottles, perfume bottles, high-quality porcelain with gilt edging, along with remnants of exotic foods—coconut shells and berry seeds, bones from beef, fish, and pork indicating that elegant meals were being eaten at this high-class brothel. These &quot;five and ten-dollar parlor houses&quot; attracted wealthy men, who used the facilities much as a gentlemen&#x27;s social club, where they made business and political connections, met with associates and had exquisite dinners with wine, champagne, and women. Brothels were not only for the wealthy. &quot;One-dollar houses&quot; were visited by those of the working class. A 1910 Kansas vice report compares the two: &quot;A few brothels were equipped with expensive furniture and furnishings including the finest of upholstered chairs, well-done paintings, and costly rugs, while others were hovels of repulsive squalor.&quot;

Women joined brothels from all walks of life. The average prostitute was approximately 21, but many were as young as 13 or as old as 50. Typically thought of as an escape for young, poor, troubled women, brothels sometimes attracted those less expected. Trained musicians and singers sometimes were lured into it by their interest in easy money and fun times. Some others turned to brothels to get out of boring, abusive, or otherwise unfulfilling marriages. Although they might be from varied classes, ethnicities, and ages, most women who began or joined brothels had a shared goal: quick money. Many found themselves always indebted to their mistresses. Lack of credit made a prostitute unable to buy items necessary for her trade (powder, cosmetics, perfumes, and evening wear), and she was forced to buy them through her madam.

Some madams, often former prostitutes themselves, rose to become independently wealthy. One was Mary Ann Hall of Arlington, Virginia. Clearly attractive and a good businesswoman, Mary Ann purchased a lot and built a brick house. That would be the location of an upscale brothel for another 40 years, sitting right at the foot of Capitol Hill. Her brothel was very lucrative, and Mary Ann was able to buy multiple enslaved people and a summer home. She was responsible for the behavior of her prostitutes, which could prove challenging since drug abuse was common. A large focus for madams was keeping their business transactions discreet and staying on the good side of the law, which they did by contributing money to charitable organizations, schools, and churches.

Despite those efforts, much of the profit still went to legal fines and fees, since prostitution was largely illegal. Timely payment of these fines could guarantee a madam that her business could continue without fear of being shut down, usually. Brothels were expected to pay significantly higher rent than other tenants. Another upscale bordello was the Big Brick in Charleston, South Carolina, built and operated by Grace Peixotto, the daughter of the Rev. Solomon Cohen Peixotto, and the madam of the most infamous brothel in the history of the city.

A madam stayed involved in her business. Running a house with so many in it required skill. A brothel required the purchase of regular food and food preparation. A madam had to monitor the cleanliness of the brothel, including the sheets, which had to be changed several times in an evening, and a stock of wines and liquors for clientele. She was the boss of the brothel and so a madam fired and hired servants, maids, and prostitutes. New faces in the brothel were desired by patrons and so madams had to find new women to recruit. Sometimes, that meant taking in a less-than-desired woman but one with youth and good looks. The &quot;new&quot; prostitute received training, cosmetics, and clothes from the madam. A prostitute from Kansas City is recorded as saying that she is no match for the &quot;proper&quot; behavior and dress required for the famous Ice Palace in Chicago.

Disorderly houses or any other dwelling used for purposes of selling sex or other lewd acts in the early 20th century were illegal with a few exceptions: the states of Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, New Mexico, and South Carolina. Penalties could range from $1,000 and time in jail to much smaller fines.

===Military brothels===

Until recently, in several armies around the world, mobile brothels were attached to the army as auxiliary units, especially attached to combat units on long-term deployments abroad. Because it is a controversial subject, military brothels and the women who provided sex services in them were often designated with creative euphemisms. Examples of such jargon are (&quot;the sweet box&quot;), replacing the term &quot;&quot;. France used mobile brothels during the First World War, the Second World War and the First Indochina War to supply sex services to French soldiers who were facing combat in areas where brothels were unusual, such as at the front line or in isolated garrisons. Brothels were outlawed in France in 1946; but the French Foreign Legion continued to use mobile brothels until the late 1990s.

During the Second World War, women drawn from throughout the Far East were forced into sexual slavery by the occupation armies of Imperial Japan in brothels known as Ianjo. These women were referred to as &quot;comfort women&quot; (kanji=慰安婦; hiragana=いあんふ; Korean=위안부). During the Second World War in Europe, Nazi Germany created military brothels where an estimated 34,140 enslaved women from Nazi-occupied Europe, particularly Poland, were forced to work as prostitutes in brothels.

After the Japanese surrender following the Second World War, the Japanese government formed the Recreation and Amusement Association and recruited 55,000 of its &quot;patriotic women&quot; to &quot;sacrifice themselves&quot; to the G.I. occupation, to protect the chastity of pure Japanese womenfolk.

In South Korea, women who worked as prostitutes for UN forces were called Western princesses. Between the 1950s and 1960s, 60% of South Korean prostitutes worked near the US military bases. Since the mid-1990s, Filipina women have worked as prostitutes for U.S. servicemen in South Korea. In 2010, the Philippine government stopped approving contracts that promoters use to bring Filipinas to South Korea to work near U.S. military bases.
==Sex doll brothel==
A number of brothels offering only sex dolls exist in Japan. There is also one in Barcelona. There was one named Bordoll in Germany too, but it closed in 2023. Another was set to open on 8 September 2018 in Toronto, Canada though it was deemed to be contrary to a by-law in the city, forcing its shutdown. Australia has recently seen its first sex doll available for use in a brothel as well. In February 2018, another opened in Aarhus, Denmark. In 2018, xDolls in Paris raised controversy in that the French government deemed it did not violate the prohibition of brothels.

<doc id="206017" wikidata="Q152225" url="?curid=206017" title="Bikini Atoll">
<text>Bikini Atoll ( or ; Marshallese: , , ), known as Eschscholtz Atoll between the 19th century and 1946, is a coral reef in the Marshall Islands consisting of 23 islands surrounding a central lagoon. The atoll is at the northern end of the Ralik Chain, approximately northwest of the capital Majuro.

After the Second World War, the atoll was chosen by the United States as a nuclear weapon testing site. It would be the site of the fourth nuclear bomb detonation and would go on to be the site of many more tests. The people that lived on Bikini—all 167 of the atoll&#x27;s inhabitants—agreed to relocate after being informed of the plan to test then-new nuclear weapons, of great importance to humankind, though it is sometimes considered a forced relocation. In 1946 they moved to Rongerik, a small island east of Bikini Atoll, but it turned out to have inadequate resources to support the population. The islanders began experiencing starvation by early 1948, and they were moved again, this time to Kwajalein Atoll. The United States used the islands and lagoon as the site of 23 nuclear tests until 1958, when it was discovered that the fallout from nuclear testing was much more dangerous than was previously thought. To this day, the Bikini islanders have not been able to return home due to nuclear contamination. There are some signs of recovery as the amount of radiation slowly decreases. 

In 1972, about 100 residents were voluntarily returned to their home island. But scientists found dangerously high levels of strontium-90 in well water in May 1978, and the residents&#x27; bodies were carrying abnormally high concentrations of caesium-137. They were evacuated again in September 1978. The atoll is occasionally visited today by divers and a few scientists, and it is occupied by a handful of caretakers. The people of the atoll, which now number in the thousands, have spread out to other Marshallese islands and the United States. A multi-million dollar trust fund, which had been supporting services for many Bikini since the 1980s, was drained in the late 2010s.

In the 21st century, the atoll is a World Heritage Site, remembered for its role in the Cold War and the post-nuclear age. It is noted as an enclave of nature, and the radiation has decreased enough that tourism is possible. However, the lingering radioactive contamination makes it unfit to return from what was expected to be short-term evacuation, especially as it is not recommended to eat plants or wildlife.

== Etymology ==

The island&#x27;s English name is derived from the German colonial name &quot;Bikini&quot; given to the atoll when it was part of German New Guinea. The German name is transliterated from the Marshallese name for the island, , () &quot;Pik&quot; meaning &quot;plane surface&quot; and &quot;Ni&quot; meaning &quot;coconut tree&quot;, or &quot;surface of coconuts&quot;.

== Culture ==

Bikini islanders&#x27; traditional lifestyle was based on cultivating plants and eating shellfish and fish. They were skilled boatbuilders and navigators, sailing the two-hulled proa to and from islets around Bikini and other atolls in the Marshall Islands. They were relatively isolated and had developed a society bound by extended family association and tradition. Every lagoon was led by a king and queen, with a following of chieftains and chief women who constituted a ruling caste.

Japan occupied the islands starting in 1914. The islanders worked the copra plantations under the watchful eye of the Japanese, who took a portion of the sales. Chiefs could retain as much as $20,000 per year, and the remainder was distributed to the workers. The Marshall islanders took pride in extending hospitality to one another, even distant relatives.

=== Clothing and dress ===

Men traditionally wore a fringed skirt about long. Women wore two mats about a yard square each, made by weaving pandanus and hibiscus leaves together and belted around the waist. Children were usually naked. Christian missionaries from Oahu arrived in the late 19th century and influenced the islanders&#x27; notions of modesty. They introduced a dress for women which was a long, wide, loose-fitting gown with long sleeves and a high neck, intended to cover as much skin as possible. The dress is called (), from the name of the Hawaiian island of Oahu.

It is customary to remove one&#x27;s shoes or sandals when taking a seat at someone&#x27;s home. Marshallese women traditionally cover their thighs as well. Women generally wear cotton muumuus or similar clothing that covers most of the body. Personal health is not often discussed except within the family, and women are especially private about female-related health issues, although they are willing to talk about their breasts.

Marshall island women swim in muumuus that are made of a fine polyester that quickly dries. In the capital of Majuro, revealing cocktail dresses are not considered appropriate for both islanders and guests. With the increasing influence of Western media, the younger generation wears shorts, though the older generation equates shorts with loose morals. T-shirts, jeans, skirts, and makeup are making their way to the islands via the media.

=== Land-based wealth ===

The Bikini islanders continue to maintain land rights as the primary measure of wealth.

Each family is part of a clan (&quot;Bwij&quot;), which owns all land. The clan owes allegiance to a chief (&quot;Iroij&quot;). The chiefs oversee the clan heads (&quot;Alap&quot;), who are supported by laborers (&quot;Dri-jerbal&quot;). The Iroij control land tenure, resource use and distribution, and settle disputes. The Alap supervise land maintenance and daily activities. The Dri-jerbal work the land including farming, cleaning, and construction.

The Marshallese society is matrilineal and land is passed down from generation to generation through the mother. Land ownership ties families together into clans. Grandparents, parents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, and cousins form extended, close-knit family groups. Gatherings tend to become big events. One of the most significant family events is the first birthday of a child (&quot;kemem&quot;), which relatives and friends celebrate with feasts and song.

Payments made in the 20th century as reparations for damage to the Bikini Atoll and the islanders&#x27; way of life have elevated their income relative to other Marshall Island residents. It has caused some Bikini islanders to become economically dependent on the payments from the trust fund. This dependency has eroded individuals&#x27; interest in traditional economic pursuits like taro and copra production. The move also altered traditional patterns of social alliance and political organization. On Bikini, rights to land and land ownership were the major factor in social and political organization and leadership. After relocation and settlement on Kili, a dual system of land tenure evolved. Disbursements from the trust fund were based in part to land ownership on Bikini and based on current land tenure on Kili.

Before the residents were relocated, they were led by a local chief and under the nominal control of the Paramount Chief of the Marshall Islands. Afterward, they had greater interaction with representatives of the trust fund and the U.S. government and began to look to them for support.

In the late 2010s, the islanders pushed for complete control of the trust fund, which was tens of millions of dollars. The same leaders which had pushed for increased control, rang up huge bills in travel expenses, buying real estate, aircraft, and boats. In 2016, the Bikini trust fund stood at $71 million in its last audit, with $4 million have been withdrawn. After leasing control, the account was drained leaving only $4 million by 2020, and $100,000 in 2023. Then with funds depleted, the power and deliveries to Kili were stopped, and salaries were not paid, this led to declaration of emergency, and the Marshallese government had to step in to try to help.

=== Language ===

Most Marshallese speak both the Marshallese language and another language. Some of the languages reflect the nation’s history with Germany, Japan, and the United States. Government agencies use Marshallese, though English is very popular also.

== Environment ==
Bikini Atoll is part of the Ralik Chain (for &quot;sunset chain&quot;) within the Marshall Islands.

=== Nuclear test site ===
The United States detonated 23 nuclear devices between 1946 and 1958 at seven test sites on the reef, inside the atoll, in the air, and underwater. They had a combined yield of about 77 Mt. The testing began with the Operation Crossroads series in July 1946. The residents initially accepted resettlement voluntarily to Rongerik Atoll, believing that they would be able to return home within a short time. However, Rongerik could not produce enough food, and the islanders starved. They could not return home, so they were relocated to Kwajalein Atoll for six months before choosing to live on Kili Island, a small island one-sixth the size of their home island. Some were able to return to Bikini Island in 1972; however, further testing revealed dangerous levels of strontium-90. They eventually moved to other atolls in the Marshall Islands and the United States, due to problems with this plan. 

In 1954, the Castle Bravo nuclear test took place on Bikini Atoll, with a yield of 15 Mt. This nuclear test was only one out of 67 total nuclear tests launched on the surrounding Marshall Islands and reefs. The nuclear radiation and fallout that followed the Castle Bravo test alone was substantial enough to discourage future habitation of the islands. Consequently, Bikini Atoll was subject to initial radioactive testing of soil composition and well water. Nuclear fallout deposits were tested in order to estimate how much area of the island was impacted by radionuclides and caesium-137 specifically. The technology used to measure the estimated amount of nuclear fallout deposit was known as HYSPLIT. This technology used meteorological sciences to model and map out nuclear fallout depositions of caesium-137 on the Marshall Islands. Initial fallout cloud debris, radionuclide particles, and actual caesium-137 particles were all estimated during nuclear testing. This data was then compared with past radiological testing results collected by HYSPLIT to predict total nuclear fallout deposition of caesium-137 on island soil.

The United States government established several trust funds which covered medical treatment and other costs and paid about $550 annually to each individual.

=== Geography ===

Some northwest of the atoll is Wōdejebato, a probable shield volcano that is connected to it through a submarine ridge.

There are 23 islands in the Bikini Atoll; the islands of Bokonijien, Aerokojlol and part of Namu were destroyed during the nuclear tests. The islands are composed of low coral limestone and sand. The average elevation is only about above low tide level. The total lagoon area is . The primary home of the islanders was the most northeast and largest islet, Bikini Island, totaling and long.

=== Flora and fauna ===

The islanders cultivated native foods including coconut, pandanus, papaya, banana, arrowroot, taro, limes, breadfruit, and pumpkin. A wide variety of other trees and plants are also present on the islands. After the completion of nuclear tests, the islands of Bikini and Enyu were replanted with coconut trees in a square grid pattern, each apart.

The islanders were skilled fishermen. They used fishing line made from coconut husk and hooks from sharpened sea shells. They used more than 25 methods of fishing. The islanders raised ducks, pigs, and chickens for food and kept dogs and cats as pets. Animal life in the atoll was severely affected by the atomic bomb testing. Existing land species include small lizards, hermit crabs, and coconut crabs. The islands are frequented by a wide variety of birds.

To allow vessels with a larger draft to enter the lagoon and to prepare for the atomic bomb testing, the United States used explosives to cut a channel through the reef and to blow up large coral heads in the lagoon. The underwater nuclear explosions carved large holes in the bottom of the lagoon that were partially refilled by blast debris. The explosions distributed vast amounts of irradiated, pulverized coral and mud across wide expanses of the lagoon and surrounding islands. , the atoll had recovered nearly 65% of the biodiversity that existed prior to radioactive contamination, but 28 species of coral appear to be locally extinct.

The radioactive contamination has prevented humans from fishing these grounds, and for that reason, there is an abundance of marine wildlife in the waters around the atoll, much larger than in other parts of the ocean. Coconut crabs are particularly abundant on the island.

=== Climate ===

The islands are hot and humid. The temperature on Bikini Atoll is year-round. The water temperature is also all year. The islands border the Pacific typhoon belt. The wet season is from May to December while the trade winds from January through May produce higher wave action.

== Resident and non-resident population ==
During WWII, the atoll had been occupied by Japanese troops, and American naval ships, ground artillery, and B-24 Liberator bombers attacked the island, killing many of the 8,000 soldiers.

When the United States helped the islanders to relocate in 1946, 19 islanders lived elsewhere. The 167 residents, comprising about 40 families who lived on the atoll, moved to Rongerik Atoll. The islands were able to produce much less food than they had on Bikini, and there were far fewer fish in the waters. By early 1948, the people were close to starvation. U.S. investigators concluded they must be moved, and they were relocated to Kwajalein Atoll. They were first evacuated to Kwaj, where the islanders lived in tents adjacent to the concrete runway in use by the U.S. Navy for six months while a new and better location was selected. Finally, Kili Island was chosen.

They were moved once again in November 1948 to Kili Island, when the population numbered 184. They were later given public lands on Ejit and a few families initially moved there to grow copra. In 1972, about 100 Bikini islanders returned to live on the atoll after they were reassured that it was safe. They remained for about 6 years until scientists found an 11-fold increase in the caesium-137 body burdens and determined that the island was not safe after all. The 178 residents were evacuated in September 1978 once again. In the late 1960s it was thought that, finally it would be safe to return to Bikini as originally planned, and they did in 1972, but it turned out there was still too much contamination and the plan was aborted and the islanders moved to other locations. 

Since then a number of descendants have moved to Majuro (the Marshall Islands&#x27; capital), other Marshall Islands, and the United States. In 1999, there were 2,600 total individuals; 1,000 islanders living on Kiji, 700 in Majuro, 275 on Ejit, 175 on other Marshall Islands or atolls, and 450 in the United States. Of those, 81 were among those who left the atoll in 1946. In 2001, the population of the dispersed islanders was 2,800. By 2013, there were about 4,880 Bikini islanders descended from the original Bikinis, with 1,250 living on Kili Island, 2,150 on Majuro (and 280 on Ejit, an island in Majuro Atoll), 350 on the other Marshall Islands, and 850 in the United States. 

As of March 2016, there were 5,400 living Bikini islanders: 800 islanders living on Kili, 2,550 on Majuro, 300 on Ejit, 350 on other Marshall Islands, and 1,400 in the United States and other countries. Of that number, 25 lived on Bikini in 1946. The resident population of the atoll is currently 4–6 caretakers, including Edward Maddison, who lived on Bikini Island from 1985 to 2020. His grandfather was one of the original residents relocated in 1946. He helped the U.S. Department of Energy with soil monitoring, testing cleanup methods, mapping the wrecks in the lagoon, and accompanying visitors on dives. He was also the divemaster of Bikini Atoll Divers. Maddison died in Majuro, Marshall Islands, on March 29, 2020.

== History ==
Humans have inhabited Bikini Atoll for about 3,600 years. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers archaeologist Charles F. Streck, Jr., found bits of charcoal, fish bones, shells and other artifacts under of sand. Carbon-dating placed the age of the artifacts at between 1960 and 1650 BC. Other discoveries on Bikini and Eneu island were carbon-dated to between 1000 BC and 1 BC, and others between AD 400 and 1400 though samples may not have been collected from secure stratigraphic contexts and older driftwood samples may have affected results.

On October 1, 1529, the Spanish ship &quot;La Florida&quot;, under the command of Álvaro de Saavedra, stopped at a lush atoll, which Saavedra called Los Jardines (). The atoll may have been Bikini or Enewetak Atoll. The Spaniards went ashore and ate with the islanders. According to an account of the voyage, the feast ended abruptly when the island&#x27;s chief inquired about the purpose of Saavedra&#x27;s musket. When Saavedra fired it into the air, the islanders fled.

Russian explorer Otto von Kotzebue was the first westerner to have undisputedly seen the atoll during his 1816 and 1817 voyages. He named it &quot;Eschscholtz Atoll&quot; after Johann Friedrich von Eschscholtz, the ship&#x27;s naturalist.

In 1834, the captain of a trading schooner and two of his crew members were killed at Bikini Atoll. Three vessels were sent to search for the captain, and when the Hawaiian brig &quot;Waverly&quot; discovered evidence of his death, the crew killed 30 Marshallese hostages in retaliation. Bikini and the other northern Marshall Islands had less European contact and settlement than the southern islands, but in the 1870s, several blackbirding ships kidnapped women from the northern islands to sell into sexual slavery in Fiji.

The German Empire annexed the Marshall Islands in 1885. The Germans used the atoll to produce copra oil from coconuts, although contact with the native population was infrequent. The atoll&#x27;s climate is drier than the more fertile southern Marshall Islands which produced more copra. Bikini islanders were recruited into developing the copra trade during the German colonial period.

=== Japanese occupation ===
Bikini was captured along with the rest of the Marshall Islands by the Imperial Japanese Navy in 1914 during World War I and mandated to the Empire of Japan by the League of Nations in 1920. The Japanese administered the island under the South Seas Mandate, but mostly left local affairs in the hands of traditional local leaders until the start of World War II. At the outset of the war, the Marshall Islands suddenly became a strategic outpost for the Japanese. They built and manned a watchtower on the island, an outpost for the Japanese headquarters on Kwajalein Atoll, to guard against an American invasion of the islands.

=== World War II ===
The islands remained relatively unscathed by the war until February 1944, when in a bloody battle, the American forces captured Kwajalein Atoll. At the battle&#x27;s conclusion, there were only five surviving Japanese soldiers left on Bikini, and they chose to die by suicide rather than allow themselves to be captured. This was followed by another difficult fight in the Battle of Eniwetok.

For the U.S., the battle represented both the next step in its island-hopping march to Japan and a significant moral victory, as it was the first time the Americans had penetrated the &quot;outer ring&quot; of the Japanese Pacific sphere. For the Japanese, the battle represented the failure of the beach-line defense. Japanese defenses became prepared in depth, and the battles of Peleliu, Guam, and the Marianas proved far more costly to the U.S. The base became part of the vast US Naval Base Marshall Islands.

=== Residents relocated ===

After World War II, the United States was engaged in a Cold War nuclear arms race with the Soviet Union to build bigger and more destructive bombs.

The nuclear weapons testing at Bikini Atoll program was a series of 23 nuclear devices detonated by the United States between 1946 and 1958 at seven test sites. The test weapons were detonated on the reef itself, on the sea, in the air and underwater with a combined explosive yield of about 77 Mt. Shortly after World War II ended, President Harry S. Truman directed Army and Navy officials to secure a site for testing nuclear weapons on American warships. While the Army had seen the results of a land-based explosion, the Navy wanted to know the effect of a nuclear weapon on ships. They wanted to determine whether ships could be spaced at sea and in ports in a way that would make nuclear weapons ineffective against vessels.

Bikini was distant from both regular sea and air traffic, making it an ideal location. In February 1946, Navy Commodore Ben H. Wyatt, the military governor of the Marshall Islands, asked the 167 Micronesian inhabitants of the atoll to voluntarily and temporarily relocate so the United States government could begin testing atomic bombs for &quot;the good of mankind and to end all world wars.&quot; After &quot;confused and sorrowful deliberation&quot; among the Bikinians, their leader, King Juda, agreed to the U.S. relocation request, announcing , which translates as &quot;Everything is in God&#x27;s hands.&quot; Nine of the eleven family heads, or &quot;alaps&quot;, chose Rongerik as their new home.

In February, Navy Seabees helped them to disassemble their church and community house and prepare to relocate them to their new home. On 7 March 1946, the residents gathered their personal belongings and saved building supplies. They were transported eastward on U.S. Navy landing ship 1108 to the uninhabited Rongerik Atoll, which was one-sixth the size of Bikini Atoll. No one lived on Rongerik because it had an inadequate water and food supply and due to deep-rooted traditional beliefs that the island was haunted by the &quot;Demon Girls of Ujae&quot;. The Navy left them with a few weeks of food and water which soon proved to be inadequate.

==== Nuclear testing program ====


The weapons testing began with the Operation Crossroads series in July 1946. The &quot;Baker&quot; test&#x27;s radioactive contamination of all the target ships was the first case of immediate, concentrated radioactive fallout from a nuclear explosion. Chemist Glenn T. Seaborg, the longest-serving chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, called &quot;Baker&quot; &quot;the world&#x27;s first nuclear disaster.&quot; This was followed by a series of later tests that left the islands of the atoll contaminated with enough radioactivity, particularly caesium-137, to contaminate food grown in the soil.

A third nuclear test called Charlie was called off after the first two. These were the last tests in Bikini Atoll until 1954, when it was chosen as the location for Operation Castle series. The first shot Bravo, had a higher yield then expected to due an unexpected Lithium-7 reaction. This along with freak weather occurences caused the fallout to spread much further than anticipated, affecting neighbouring atolls and the Japanese fishing boat Daigo Fukuryū Maru.

Four more detonations occurred as part of the Castle series, with a combined yield of 46.5 megatons.

In 1956, Operation Redwing was conducted at the Atoll, with six total detonations and a combined yield of 18.2 megatons

The final round of tests occurred in 1958 as part of the larger Operation Hardtack I. Eleven detonations occurred with a combined yield of 21 megatons

==== Strategic Trust Territory ====
In 1947, the United States convinced the United Nations to designate the islands of Micronesia a United Nations Strategic Trust Territory. This was the only trust ever granted by the U.N. The United States Navy controlled the Trust from a headquarters in Guam until 1951, when the United States Department of the Interior took over control, administering the territory from a base in Saipan. The directive stated that the United States should &quot;promote the economic advancement and self-sufficiency of the inhabitants, and to this end shall... protect the inhabitants against the loss of their lands and resources...&quot;

Despite the promise to &quot;protect the inhabitants&quot;, from July 1946 through July 1947, the residents of Bikini Atoll were left alone on Rongerik Atoll and were starving for lack of food. A team of U.S. investigators concluded in late 1947 that the islanders must be moved immediately. Press from around the world harshly criticized the U.S. Navy for ignoring the people. Harold Ickes, a syndicated columnist, wrote &quot;The natives are actually and literally starving to death.&quot; The islanders were moved again, this time to Kwajalein Atoll. 

==== Move to Kili Island ====
In January 1948, Leonard Mason, an anthropologist from the University of Hawaii, visited Rongerik Atoll and was horrified at what he found. One resident of Rongerik commented,

Mason requested that food be brought to the islanders on Rongerik immediately along with a medical officer. The Navy then selected Ujelang Atoll for their temporary home, and some young men from the Bikini Atoll population went ahead to begin constructing living accommodations. But U.S. Trust Authorities changed their mind. They decided to use Enewetak Atoll as a second nuclear weapons test site and relocated the residents to Ujelang Atoll instead and to the homes built for the Bikini Islanders.

In March 1948, 184 malnourished Bikini islanders were relocated again to Kwajalein Atoll. They were given tents on a strip of grass alongside the airport runway to live in. In June 1948, the Bikini residents chose Kili Island as a long-term home. The extremely small, () island was uninhabited and wasn&#x27;t ruled by a paramount &quot;iroij&quot;, or king due to its size. It also lacks a coral reef. In June, the Bikini community chose two dozen men to accompany eight Seabees to Kili to begin construction of a village. In November 1948, the residents, now totaling 184 individuals, moved to Kili Island, at , one of the smallest islands in the Marshall Island chain. They soon learned they could no longer fish the way they had on Bikini Atoll. Kili lacked the calm, protected lagoon. Living on Kili Island effectively destroyed their culture that had been based on fishing and island-hopping canoe voyages to various islets around Bikini Atoll. Kili did not provide enough food for the transplanted residents.

==== Failed resettlement ====

After their relocation to Kili, the Bikini residents continued to suffer from inadequate food supplies. Kili is a small island without a lagoon, and most of the year it is exposed to waves that make fishing and putting canoes out difficult. Starvation ensued. In 1949, the Trust Territory administration donated a ship for transporting copra between Kili and Jaluit Atoll, but the ship was wrecked in heavy surf while delivering copra and other fruit.
The U.S. Trust Authorities airdropped food onto Kili. The residents had to rely on imported USDA rice and canned goods and had to buy food with their supplemental income.

During 1955 and 1956, ships dispatched by the U.S. Trust Territory continually experienced problems unloading food because of the rough seas around the island, leading to additional food shortages. The people once again suffered from starvation and the shortages increased in 1956. The U.S. suggested that some of the Bikini Islanders move to Jaluit where food was more readily available. A few people moved.

The United States opened a satellite community for the families on public land on Jaluit Atoll, north. Three families moved there to produce copra for sale and other families rotated living there later on. Their homes on both Kili and Jaluit were struck by typhoons during 1957 and 1958, sinking their supply ship and damaging crops.

==== Return to Bikini Atoll ====

In June 1968, based on scientific advice that the radiation levels were sufficiently reduced, President Lyndon B. Johnson promised the 540 Bikini Atoll family members living on Kili and other islands that they would be able to return to their home. The Atomic Energy Commission cleared radioactive debris from the island, and the U.S. Trust Territory was in charge of rebuilding structures and replanting crops on the atoll. But shortly afterward, the Trust Territory ended regular air flights between Kwajalein Atoll and Bikini Atoll, which seriously impeded progress. Coconut trees were finally replanted in 1972, but the AEC learned that the coconut crabs retained high levels of radioactivity and could not be eaten. The Bikini Council voted to delay a return to the island as a result.

Three extended families, eventually totaling about 100 people, moved back to their home island in 1972 despite the risk. But 3 years later, a team of scientists performed additional tests on the island and its inhabitants. They found some wells were too radioactive for use and determined that the pandanus and breadfruit were also dangerous for human consumption. Urine samples from the islanders on Bikini Atoll showed low levels of plutonium-239 and plutonium-240. As a result, the Bikini community filed a federal lawsuit seeking a complete scientific survey of Bikini and the northern Marshall Islands. Inter-departmental squabbling over responsibility for the costs delayed the work for three years. Then in May 1977 scientists found dangerously high levels of strontium-90 in the well water exceeding the U.S. maximum allowed limits. In June, the Department of Energy stated that &quot;All living patterns involving Bikini Island exceed Federal [radiation] guidelines for thirty-year population doses.&quot; Later that year scientists discovered an 11-fold increase in the caesium-137 body burdens in all of the people living on the atoll. In May 1978 officials from the U.S. Department of the Interior described the 75% increase in radioactive caesium-137 found as &quot;incredible&quot;.

Women were experiencing miscarriages, stillbirths, and genetic abnormalities in their children. Researchers learned that the coral soil behaved differently from mainland soil because it contains very little potassium. Plants and trees readily absorb potassium as part of the normal biological process, but since caesium is part of the same group on the periodic table, it is absorbed by plants in a very similar chemical process. The islanders who unknowingly consumed contaminated coconut milk were found to have abnormally high concentrations of caesium in their bodies. The Trust Territory decided that the islanders had to be evacuated from the atoll a second time.

The islanders received US$75 million in damages in 1986 as part of a new Compact of Free Association with the U.S. and in 1988, another $90 million to be used specifically for radiological cleanup. In 1987, a few Bikini elders traveled to Eneu Island to reestablish old property lines. Construction crews began building a hotel, docks, and roads on Bikini, and installed generators, desalinators, and power lines. A packed coral and sand runway still exists on Eneu Island. The Bikini Atoll Divers was established to provide income. But in 1995, the council learned that the US Environmental Protection Agency standard required reducing radiation levels to 15 millirems, substantially less than the US Department of Energy standard of 100 millirems. This discovery significantly increased the potential cost of cleanup and stalled the effort.

=== Relocation to Kili Island ===

As a result of the military use of the island and the failed resettlement, the islands are littered with abandoned concrete bunkers and tons of heavy equipment, vehicles, supplies, machines, and buildings. In September 1978, Trust Territory officials finally arrived to relocate the residents. The radiological survey of the northern Marshalls, compelled by the 1975 lawsuit, began only after the residents were removed and returned to Kili Island.

, the tiny Kili Island supported about 600 residents who live in cinderblock houses. They must rely on contributions from a settlement trust fund to supplement what they produce locally. Each family receives one to two boxes of frozen chicken, two to four 51-lb (23 kilogram) bags of flour, and two to four bags of rice 2 to 3 times per year. The islanders operate several small stores out of their homes to supply nonperishable food items like salt, Tabasco, candy, and canned items. A generator provides electricity.

Children attend elementary school on Kili through eighth grade. Toward the end of the eighth grade, students must pass a standardized test to gain admission to attend public high school in Jaluit or Majuro.

Beginning in 2011 the resettled residents of Kili Island began to experience periods of ocean flooding during king tide. The highest point of Kili Island is only above sea level. Ocean waves have covered portions of the island at least five times from 2011 to 2015, contaminating the wells on the island. The runway servicing the island is unusable during and after rains and ocean flooding because it becomes extremely muddy. In August 2015, the Bikini Council passed a resolution requesting assistance from US government to modify terms of the Resettlement Trust Fund for the People of Bikini to be used to relocate the population once again, this time outside of the Marshall Islands.

The Trust fund had been fairly stable, but after 2017 increased withdrawals drained it down and in the 2020s a crisis erupted to provide services on Kili.

== Trust funds and failed claims ==

In 1975, when the islanders who had returned to Bikini Atoll learned that it wasn&#x27;t safe, they sued the United States for $900 billion in USD, demanding a radiological study of the northern islands.

In 1975, the United States set up &quot;The Hawaiian Trust Fund for the People of Bikini&quot;, totaling $3 million. When the islanders were removed from the island in 1978, the U.S. added $3 million to the fund. The U.S. created a second trust fund, &quot;The Resettlement Trust Fund for the People of Bikini&quot;, containing $20 million in 1982. The U.S. added another $90 million to that fund to pay to clean up, reconstruct homes and facilities, and resettle the islanders on Bikini and Eneu islands.

In 1983, the U.S. and the Marshall islanders signed the Compact of Free Association, which gave the Marshall Islands independence. The Compact became effective in 1986 and was subsequently modified by the Amended Compact that became effective in 2004. It also established the Nuclear Claims Tribunal, which was given the task of adjudicating compensation for victims and families affected by the nuclear testing program. Section 177 of the compact provided for reparations to the Bikini islanders and other northern atolls for damages. It included $75 million to be paid over 15 years.

The payments began in 1987 with $2.4 million paid annually to the entire Bikini population, while the remaining $2.6 million is paid into &quot;The Bikini Claims Trust Fund&quot;. This trust is intended to exist in perpetuity and to provide the islanders a 5% payment from the trust annually.

The United States provided $150 million in compensation for damage caused by the nuclear testing program and their displacement from their home island.

On 5 March 2001 after years of deliberations, the Nuclear Claims Tribunal ruled against the United States for damages done to the islands and its people. The NCT awarded Bikini $278 million for loss of land use, finding the actions of the U.S. amounted to a &quot;temporary taking&quot; and made its award based on fair rental value for the period of denied use. The NCT made a further award of $251,500,000 for atoll rehabilitation to restore Bikini &quot;to a safe and productive state.&quot;

However, the U.S. Congress has failed to fund the settlement. The only recourse is for the Bikini people to petition the U.S. Congress to fund the payment and fulfill this award. The United States Supreme Court turned down the islanders&#x27; appeal of the United States Court of Appeals decision that refused to compel the government to fund their claim. By 2001, of the original 167 residents who were relocated, 70 were still alive, and the entire population has grown to 2,800. Most of the islanders and their descendants lived on Kili, in Majuro, and in the United States.

&quot;The Hawaiian Trust Fund for the People of Bikini&quot; was liquidated as required by law in December 2006. The value of &quot;The Resettlement Trust Fund for the People of Bikini&quot; as of 31 March 2013 was approximately $82 million and &quot;The Bikini Claims Trust Fund&quot; was worth approximately $60 million. In 2006, each member of the trust received about $500 a year. In 2012, the trusts produced about US$6 to $8 million annually in investment income, and the trusts paid out less than US$15,000 per family each year in benefits, with little money left available for cleanup.

Representatives for the Bikini people expect this process to take many years and do not know whether the United States will honor the terms of the Compact of Free Association.

In 2017, after lobbying by the leaders of Bikini, the Trump administration stated that there would be no limits on withdrawals from the main fund and no further audits of the main fund. The mayor of the council that is responsible for the Bikini people, Anderson Jibas, used the fund&#x27;s assets to buy a plane, construction equipment and two cargo ships. In addition, an apartment complex in Majuro, the capital of the Marshall Islands, and 283 acres of land in Hawaii were purchased. By March 2023, only $100,041 was left in the fund that held $59 million in 2017. The council stopped paying its approximately 350 employees and stopped paying $150 monthly subsistence payments to the 6,800 members of the Bikini community.

By 2023 a state of emergency on Kili was declared, and the Marshallese government had to step in try to remedy the situation. Aid helped restore electricity to the island, which had been shut off after the funds were depleted. Many of the purchases that were made including, real estate, aircraft, and boats have not yielded a return for the Bikini.

The depletion of the bikini islander&#x27;s trust fund made news across the Pacific region, including New Zealand, and in major US newspapers such as the New York Times and Wall Street Journal.

== World Heritage Site ==

Because the site bears direct tangible evidence of the nuclear tests conducted there amid the paradoxical tropical location, UNESCO determined that the atoll symbolizes the dawn of the nuclear age and named it a World Heritage Site on 3 August 2010.

== Visitor access ==

Bikini Atoll is open to visitors aboard vessels that are completely self-sufficient if they obtain prior approval. They must also pay for a diver and two local government council representatives to accompany them. The local representation is required to verify that visitors don&#x27;t remove artifacts from the wrecks in the lagoon. Extensive research has been conducted to ensure the safety of visitors to the area and to demonstrate the now low levels of radiation in and around Bikini Atoll.

=== Bikini Lagoon diving ===

In June 1996, the Bikini Council authorized diving operations as a means to generate income for Bikini islanders currently and upon their eventual return. The Bikini Council hired dive guide Edward Maddison who had lived on Bikini Island since 1985 and Fabio Amaral, a Brazilian citizen at the time, as head divemaster and resort manager. The tours are limited to fewer than a dozen experienced divers a week, cost more than US$5,000, and include detailed histories of the nuclear tests. The operation brought in more than $500,000 during the season from May to October 2001.

=== On-shore facilities ===

To accommodate the dive program and anglers, the Bikini Council built new air-conditioned rooms with private bathrooms and showers. They included verandas overlooking the lagoon. There was a dining facility that served American-style meals and Marshallese dishes featuring fresh seafood. Only 12 visitors were hosted at one time. Because of the lingering contamination, all fruits and vegetables used for the Bikini Atoll dive and sport fishing operation were imported. In September 2007, the last of Air Marshall Islands&#x27; commuter aircraft ceased operations when spare parts could not be located and the aircraft were no longer airworthy. A half dozen divers and a journalist were stranded for a week on Bikini Island. The Bikini islanders suspended land-based dive operations beginning in August 2008. , Air Marshall Islands operates one Bombardier DHC-8-100 aircraft and two 19-seat Dornier 228.

=== Liveaboard diving program ===

In October 2010, a live-aboard, self-contained vessel successfully conducted dive operations. In 2011, the local government licensed the liveaboard operator as a provider of dive expeditions on the nuclear ghost fleet on Bikini Atoll. The dive season runs from May through October. Visitors are still able to land on the island for brief stays.

In early 2017, Master Liveaboards announced they would add Bikini Atoll to their list of destinations for technical divers using their vessel Truk Master, with trips to the site commencing in May 2018 having been granted a license by the Bikini Council. In May 2021, as a result of ongoing business evaluation and pent up demand created by the COVID-19 pandemic, Master Liveaboards announced they would be adding an additional vessel alongside Truk Master to operate at Bikini Atoll from 2022 onwards.

Because the lagoon has remained undisturbed for so long, it contains a larger amount of sea life than usual, including sharks, which increases divers&#x27; interest in the area. Visibility depth is over . The lagoon is immensely popular with divers and is regarded as among the top 10 diving locations in the world.

Dive visitors receive a history lesson along with the dive experience, including movies and complete briefings about each of the ships, their respective histories, and a tour of the island and the atoll. Divers are able to visit the USS Saratoga (CV-3), the second largest of only three aircraft carriers in the world that are accessible to scuba or closed circuit rebreather divers.

=== Sportfishing ===

Bikini Island authorities opened sport fishing to visitors along with diving. Although the atomic blasts obliterated three islands and contaminated much of the atoll, after 50 years the coral reefs have largely recovered. The reefs attract reef fish and their predators: dogtooth tuna, barracuda, and giant trevally as big as . Given the long-term absence of humans, the Bikini lagoon offers sportsmen one of the most pristine fishing environments in the world.

=== Shipwrecks ===
Shipwrecks in the lagoon include the following:
* – aircraft carrier
* – battleship
* – attack transport
* – attack transport
* – destroyer
* – destroyer
* – submarine
* – submarine
* – battleship
* – light cruiser

== Current habitable state ==

Due to the nuclear weapon testing, the island was subject to environmental testing in 1998 by the International Atomic Energy Agency. To validate previous surveys data collected, the agency tested air absorption rates and soil and food radionuclide concentrations.

In 1998, an IAEA advisory group, formed in response to a request by the Government of the Marshall Islands for an independent international review of the radiological conditions on Bikini Atoll, recommended that Bikini Island should not be permanently resettled under the present radiological conditions.

The potential to make the island habitable has substantially improved since then. A 2012 assessment from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory found that caesium-137 levels are dropping considerably faster than expected. Terry Hamilton, scientific director of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory&#x27;s Marshall Islands Dose Assessment and Radioecology Program, reported that &quot;Conditions have really changed on Bikini. They are improving at an accelerated rate. By using the combined option of removing soil and adding potassium, we can get very close to the 15 millirem standard. That has been true for roughly the past 10 years. So now is the time when the Bikinians, if they desired, could go back.&quot;

, about 4,880 descendants of the original Bikini people live on Kili and other Marshall Islands and some have emigrated to the United States. Bikini Island is currently visited by a few scientists and inhabited by 4–6 caretakers.

The islanders want the topsoil removed, but lack the necessary funding. The opportunity for some Bikini islanders to potentially relocate back to their home island creates a dilemma. While the island may be habitable in the near term, virtually all of the islanders alive today have never lived there. , unemployment in the Marshall Islands was at about 40 percent. The population is growing at a four-percent growth rate, so increasing numbers are taking advantage of terms in the Marshall Islands&#x27; Compact of Free Association that allow them to live in and work in the United States.

After the islanders were relocated in 1946, while the Bikini islanders were experiencing starvation on Rongerik Atoll, Lore Kessibuki wrote an anthem for the island:

: &quot;No longer can I stay, it&#x27;s true&quot;
: &quot;No longer can I live in peace and harmony&quot;
: &quot;No longer can I rest on my sleeping mat and pillow&quot;
: &quot;Because of my island and the life I once knew there&quot;
: &quot;The thought is overwhelming&quot;
: &quot;Rendering me helpless and in great despair.&quot;

== In popular culture ==

=== Cinema ===
*The documentary &quot;Bikini – mon amour&quot; by Oliver Herbrich shows the effects of long-term low-level radiation on the population.
*The 1962 Italian mondo documentary film &quot;Mondo Cane&quot; shows the effects of long-term low-level radiation on the wildlife.
*The nuclear tests at Bikini, along with the Hiroshima &amp; Nagasaki bombings, inspired the 1954 Japanese movie &quot;Godzilla&quot;.

=== Television shows ===
The Nickelodeon animated series &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot; primarily takes place in Bikini Bottom, which is supposedly situated underneath the atoll named after Bikini Atoll.

During a 2015 interview with Tom Kenny, the voice actor for SpongeBob, he was asked about the popular theory that SpongeBob is the result of nuclear testing. He replied, 

In 2024, Rodger Bumpass (voice actor for Squidward) said he also believed the theory was false, but Mr. Lawrence (voice actor for Plankton) said the theory was &quot;absolutely true&quot;:

=== Swimsuit design ===

On 5 July 1946, four days after the first nuclear device (nicknamed &quot;Able&quot;) was detonated over Bikini Atoll during Operation Crossroads, Louis Réard introduced a new swimsuit design named the &quot;bikini&quot; after the atoll. Réard was a French mechanical engineer by training and manager of his mother&#x27;s lingerie shop in Paris. He introduced the new garment to the media and public on 5 July 1946 at Piscine Molitor, a public pool in Paris.

He hired Micheline Bernardini, an 18-year-old nude dancer from the Casino de Paris, to demonstrate his design. It featured string briefs of of cloth with newspaper-type print and was an immediate sensation. Bernardini received 50,000 fan letters, many of them from men. Réard hoped that his swimsuit&#x27;s revealing style would create an &quot;explosive commercial and cultural reaction&quot; similar in intensity to the social reaction to 1946 nuclear explosion on Bikini Atoll. Fashion writer Diana Vreeland described the bikini as the &quot;atom bomb of fashion&quot;.

Because the bikini exposes a woman&#x27;s thighs, it violates the Marshall Islanders&#x27; modern customs of modesty, whereas cultural taboos regarding women&#x27;s breasts are less strict on the islands. Marshall Island women swim in their muumuus, which are made of a fine polyester that dries quickly. Wearing a bikini in the Marshall Islands is mainly limited to restricted-access beaches and pools like those at private resorts or on United States government facilities on Kwajalein Atoll within the Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test Site.

<text>A weather station is a facility, either on land or sea, with instruments and equipment for measuring atmospheric conditions to provide information for weather forecasts and to study the weather and climate. The measurements taken include temperature, atmospheric pressure, humidity, wind speed, wind direction, and precipitation amounts. Wind measurements are taken with as few other obstructions as possible, while temperature and humidity measurements are kept free from direct solar radiation, or insolation. Manual observations are taken at least once daily, while automated measurements are taken at least once an hour. Weather conditions out at sea are taken by ships and buoys, which measure slightly different meteorological quantities such as sea surface temperature (SST), wave height, and wave period. Drifting weather buoys outnumber their moored versions by a significant amount.

==Weather instruments==

A weather instrument is any device that measures weather related conditions. Since there are a variety of different weather conditions, there are a variety of different weather instruments. 

Typical weather stations have the following instruments and sensors:

* Thermometer for measuring air and sea surface temperature
* Barometer for measuring atmospheric pressure
* Hygrometer for measuring humidity
* Anemometer for measuring wind speed
* Pyranometer for measuring solar radiation
* Rain gauge for measuring liquid precipitation over a set period of time.
* Wind sock for measuring general wind speed and wind direction
* Wind vane, also called a weather vane or a weathercock: it shows which way the wind is blowing.
* Evaporation pan for measuring evaporation.

In addition, at certain automated airport weather stations, additional instruments may be employed, including:

* Present weather sensor for identifying falling precipitation
* Disdrometer for measuring drop size distribution
* Transmissometer for measuring visibility
* Ceilometer for measuring cloud ceiling

More sophisticated stations may also measure the ultraviolet index, leaf wetness, soil moisture, soil temperature, water temperature in ponds, lakes, creeks, or rivers, and occasionally other data.

===Exposure===

Except for those instruments requiring direct exposure to the elements (anemometer, rain gauge), the instruments should be sheltered in a vented box, usually a Stevenson screen, to keep direct sunlight off the thermometer and wind off the hygrometer. The instrumentation may be specialized to allow for periodic recording, otherwise significant manual labour is required for record keeping. Automatic transmission of data, in a format such as METAR, is also desirable as many weather station&#x27;s data is required for weather forecasting.

==Personal weather station==
A personal weather station is a set of weather measuring instruments operated by a private individual, club, association, or business (where obtaining and distributing weather data is not a part of the entity&#x27;s business operation). Personal weather stations have become more advanced and can include many different sensors to measure weather conditions. These sensors can vary between models but most measure wind speed, wind direction, outdoor and indoor temperatures, outdoor and indoor humidity, barometric pressure, rainfall, and UV or solar radiation. Other available sensors can measure soil moisture, soil temperature, and leaf wetness. The quality, number of instruments, and placement of personal weather stations can vary widely, making the determination of which stations collect accurate, meaningful, and comparable data difficult. There are a comprehensive number of retail weather stations available.

Personal weather stations typically involve a digital console that provides readouts of the data being collected. These consoles may interface to a personal computer where data can be displayed, stored, and uploaded to websites or data ingestion/distribution systems. Open-source weather stations are available that are designed to be fully customizable by users.

Personal weather stations may be operated solely for the enjoyment and education of the owner, while some owners share their results with others. They do this by manually compiling data and distributing it, distributing data over the Internet, or sharing data via amateur radio. The Citizen Weather Observer Program (CWOP) is a service which facilitates the sharing of information from personal weather stations. This data is submitted through use of software, a personal computer, and internet connection (or amateur radio) and are utilized by groups such as the National Weather Service (NWS) when generating forecast models. Each weather station submitting data to CWOP will also have an individual Web page that depicts the data submitted by that station. The Weather Underground Internet site is another popular destination for the submittal and sharing of data with others around the world. As with CWOP, each station submitting data to Weather Underground has a unique Web page displaying their submitted data. The UK Met Office&#x27;s Weather Observations Website (WOW) also allows such data to be shared and displayed.

== Dedicated ships ==


A weather ship was a ship stationed in the ocean as a platform for surface and upper air meteorological measurements for use in weather forecasting. It was also meant to aid in search and rescue operations and to support transatlantic flights. The establishment of weather ships proved to be so useful during World War II that the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) established a global network of 13 weather ships in 1948. Of the 12 left in operation in 1996, nine were located in the northern Atlantic Ocean while three were located in the northern Pacific Ocean. The agreement of the weather ships ended in 1990. Weather ship observations proved to be helpful in wind and wave studies, as they did not avoid weather systems like merchant ships tended to and were considered a valuable resource. The last weather ship was , known as weather station M (&quot;jilindras&quot;) at 66°N, 02°E, run by the Norwegian Meteorological Institute. MS &quot;Polarfront&quot; was removed from service January 1, 2010. Since the 1960s this role has been largely superseded by satellites, long range aircraft and weather buoys. Weather observations from ships continue from thousands of voluntary merchant vessels in routine commercial operation; the Old Weather crowdsourcing project transcribes naval logs from before the era of dedicated ships.

==Dedicated buoys==
Weather buoys are instruments which collect weather and oceanography data within the world&#x27;s oceans and lakes. Moored buoys have been in use since 1951, while drifting buoys have been used since the late 1970s. Moored buoys are connected with the seabed using either chains, nylon, or buoyant polypropylene. With the decline of the weather ship, they have taken a more primary role in measuring conditions over the open seas since the 1970s. During the 1980s and 1990s, a network of buoys in the central and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean helped study the El Niño-Southern Oscillation. Moored weather buoys range from in diameter, while drifting buoys are smaller, with diameters of . Drifting buoys are the dominant form of weather buoy in sheer number, with 1250 located worldwide. Wind data from buoys has smaller error than that from ships. There are differences in the values of sea surface temperature measurements between the two platforms as well, relating to the depth of the measurement and whether or not the water is heated by the ship which measures the quantity.

==Synoptic weather station==
Synoptic weather stations are instruments which collect meteorological information at synoptic time 00h00, 06h00, 12h00, 18h00 (UTC) and at intermediate synoptic hours 03h00, 09h00, 15h00, 21h00 (UTC). Every weather station has assigned station unique code by WMO for identification.

The common instruments of measure are anemometer, wind vane, pressure sensor, thermometer, hygrometer, and rain gauge.

The weather measures are formatted in special format and transmit to WMO to help the weather forecast model.

==Networks==
A variety of land-based weather station networks have been set up globally. Some of these are basic to analyzing weather fronts and pressure systems, such as the synoptic observation network, while others are more regional in nature, known as mesonets.

<doc id="206019" wikidata="Q333246" url="?curid=206019" title="Robert Sheckley">
<text>Robert Sheckley (July 16, 1928 – December 9, 2005) was an American writer. First published in the science-fiction magazines of the 1950s, his many quick-witted stories and novels were famously unpredictable, absurdist, and broadly comical.

Nominated for Hugo and Nebula Awards, Sheckley was named Author Emeritus by the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America in 2001.

==Biography==

Sheckley was born to a Jewish family in Brooklyn, New York City. In 1931, the family moved to Maplewood, New Jersey. Sheckley attended Columbia High School, where he discovered science fiction. He graduated in 1946 and hitchhiked to California the same year, where he tried numerous jobs: landscape gardener, pretzel salesman, barman, milkman, warehouseman, and general laborer &quot;board man&quot; in a hand-painted necktie studio. Still in 1946, he joined the U.S. Army and was sent to Korea. During his time in the army, he served as a guard, an army newspaper editor, a payroll clerk, and as a guitarist in the Army Band. He left the service in 1948.

Sheckley graduated with an arts degree from New York University in 1951. The same year he married, for the first time, to Barbara Scadron. The couple had one son, Jason. Sheckley worked in an aircraft factory and as an assistant metallurgist for a short time, but his breakthrough came quickly: in late 1951, he sold his first story, &quot;Final Examination,&quot; to &quot;Imagination&quot; magazine. He quickly gained prominence as a writer, publishing stories in &quot;Imagination&quot;, &quot;Galaxy&quot;, and other science fiction magazines. The 1950s saw the publication of Sheckley&#x27;s first four books: short story collections &quot;Untouched by Human Hands&quot; (Ballantine, 1954), &quot;Citizen in Space&quot; (1955), and &quot;Pilgrimage to Earth&quot; (Bantam, 1957), and a novel, &quot;Immortality, Inc.&quot; (first published as a serial in &quot;Galaxy&quot;, 1958).

Sheckley and Scadron divorced in 1956. The writer married journalist Ziva Kwitney in 1957. The newly married couple lived in Greenwich Village. Their daughter, Alisa Kwitney, born in 1964, would herself become a successful writer. Applauded by critic Kingsley Amis, Sheckley was now selling many of his deft, satiric stories to mainstream magazines such as &quot;Playboy&quot;. In addition to his science fiction stories, in the 1960s Sheckley started writing suspense fiction. More short story collections and novels appeared in the 1960s, and a film adaptation of an early story by Sheckley, &quot;The 10th Victim&quot;, was released in 1965.

Sheckley spent much of 1970s living on Ibiza. He and Kwitney divorced in 1972 and the same year Sheckley married Abby Schulman, whom he had met in Ibiza. The couple had two children, Anya and Jed. The couple separated while living in London. In 1980, the writer returned to the United States and became fiction editor of the newly established &quot;OMNI&quot; magazine. Sheckley left &quot;OMNI&quot; in 1981 with his fourth wife, writer Jay Rothbell: they subsequently traveled widely in Europe, finally ending up in Portland, Oregon, where they separated. He married Gail Dana of Portland in 1990. Sheckley continued publishing further science fiction and espionage or mystery stories, and collaborated with other writers such as Roger Zelazny and Harry Harrison.

During an April 2005 visit to Ukraine for the Ukrainian Sci-Fi Computer Week, an international event for science fiction writers, Sheckley fell ill and had to be hospitalized in Kyiv. His condition was very serious for a week, but he appeared to be slowly recovering. Sheckley&#x27;s official website ran a fundraising campaign to help cover his treatment and his return to the United States. He settled in Red Hook, in northern Dutchess County, New York, to be near his daughters Anya and Alisa. On November 20 he had surgery for a brain aneurysm; he died in a Poughkeepsie hospital on December 9, 2005.

==Works==

Sheckley was a prolific and versatile writer. His works include not only original short stories and novels, but also TV series episodes (&quot;Captain Video and His Video Rangers&quot;), novelizations of works by others (&quot;Babylon 5: A Call to Arms&quot;, after the film), stories in shared universes such as &quot;Heroes in Hell&quot;, and collaborations with other writers. He was best known for his several hundred short stories, which he published in book form as well as individually. Typical Sheckley stories include &quot;Bad Medicine&quot; (in which a man is mistakenly treated by a psychotherapy machine intended for Martians), &quot;Protection&quot; (whose protagonist is warned of deadly danger unless he avoids the common activity of &quot;lesnerizing&quot;, a word whose meaning is not explained), and &quot;The Accountant&quot; (in which a family of wizards learns that their son has been taken from them by a more sinister trade—accountancy). In many stories Sheckley speculates about alternative (and usually sinister) social orders, of which a good example is the story &quot;&quot; (which tells of a sort of Utopia designed for human nature as it actually is, which turns out to have terrible drawbacks).

Sheckley&#x27;s early stories include the far future AAA Ace detective agency series. In these tales, the two partners face unusual problems often related to human incompetence or laziness.

In the 1990s, Sheckley wrote a series of three mystery novels featuring detective Hob Draconian, as well as novels set in the worlds of &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; and &quot;Alien&quot;. Before his death Sheckley had been commissioned to write an original novel based on the TV series &quot;The Prisoner&quot; for Powys Media, but died before completing the manuscript.

His novel &quot;Dimension of Miracles&quot; is often cited as an influence on Douglas Adams&#x27;s &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot;, although in an interview for Neil Gaiman&#x27;s book &quot;Don&#x27;t Panic: The Official Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy Companion&quot;, Adams said he had not read it until after writing the Guide.

==Film, TV and radio adaptations==
One of Sheckley&#x27;s early works, the April 1953 &quot;Galaxy&quot; short story &quot;Seventh Victim&quot;, was the basis for the film &quot;The 10th Victim&quot;, also known by the original Italian title &quot;La decima vittima&quot;. The film starred Marcello Mastroianni and Ursula Andress. A novelization of the film, also written by Sheckley, was published in 1966. The satirical premise is that in the future killings are legal and televised, and that potential victims or hunters can get corporate sponsors and extra perks to assist them in succeeding as a professional, corporate-sponsored, celebrity killer.

His 1953 short story &quot;Watchbird&quot; was adapted for the short-lived TV series &quot;Masters of Science Fiction&quot;. It did not initially air in the US, but on February 12, 2012, the Science Channel began airing the episodes, under the title &quot;Stephen Hawking&#x27;s Sci-Fi Masters&quot;, beginning with the first domestic airing of the episode &quot;Watchbird&quot;. It was included on the DVD set for the series.

The 1954 story &quot;Ghost V&quot; and the 1955 story &quot;The Lifeboat Mutiny&quot; were adapted into two episodes of the USSR science fiction TV series &quot;This Fantastic World&quot;. &quot;Ghost V&quot; was staged also by Estonian TV channel ETV in 1997.

The 1958 short story &quot;The Prize of Peril&quot; was adapted in 1970 as the West German TV movie &quot;Das Millionenspiel&quot;, and again in 1983 as the French movie &quot;Le Prix du Danger&quot;. Written about a man who goes on a TV show in which he must evade people out to kill him for a week in order to win a large cash prize, it is perhaps the first-ever published work predicting the advent of reality television. There are many similarities between Sheckley&#x27;s story and Stephen King&#x27;s novel &quot;The Running Man&quot;, published later in 1982, of which a film adaptation was later made.

The 1958 short story &quot;The Store of the Worlds&quot; from the collection &quot;Store of Infinity&quot; was adapted twice as a short film, first in Hungary in 1975 with its original title translated to Hungarian (&quot;Világok boltja&quot;). The second was titled &quot;The Escape&quot; by the filmmaker Paul Franklin, starring Julian Sands, Art Malik, Olivia Williams and Ben Miller. This film had its premiere at the 2017 Tribeca Film Festival in New York.

Sheckley&#x27;s 1959 novel &quot;Immortality, Inc.&quot;—about a world in which the afterlife could be obtained via a scientific process—was very loosely adapted into a film, the 1992 &quot;Freejack&quot;, starring Mick Jagger, Emilio Estevez, Rene Russo, and Anthony Hopkins. It was also adapted into the first episode of the third season of the British BBC series &quot;Out of the Unknown&quot;. This episode is lost due to the then common practice of wiping the shows after broadcast.

His 1962 novel, &quot;The Man in the Water&quot; was filmed under that title and was also released as &quot;Escape from Hell Island&quot;.

&quot;The Game of X&quot; (1965) was loosely adapted as the 1981 Disney film, &quot;Condorman&quot;.

The 2023 film titled &quot;Robots&quot;, starring Shailene Woodley is based on the short story &quot;The Robot That Looked Like Me&quot;.

A number of Sheckley&#x27;s works, some of which under the pseudonym &quot;Finn O&#x27;Donnevan&quot;, were also adapted for the radio show &quot;X Minus One&quot; in the late 1950s, including the above-mentioned &quot;Seventh Victim,&quot; &quot;Bad Medicine,&quot; &quot;Protection,&quot; and &quot;The Native Problem,&quot; the last of which was an exploration of Zimmer&#x27;s Law, or the waiting time paradox. The radio show &quot;Tales of Tomorrow&quot; also in the late 1950s did a version of &quot;Watchbird&quot; and South Africa radio did their version of &quot;Watchbird&quot; on the series &quot;SF68&quot;.

In 2007, Chris Larner and David Gilbert created the radio show &quot;The Laxian Key&quot; based on Sheckley&#x27;s short stories. It was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 Extra.

<doc id="206020" wikidata="Q332470" url="?curid=206020" title="Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke">
<text>Henry St. John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke (; 16 September 1678 – 12 December 1751) was an English politician, government official and political philosopher. He was a leader of the Tories, and supported the Church of England politically despite his antireligious views and opposition to theology.

Bolingbroke supported the Jacobite rebellion of 1715, which sought to overthrow the new king George I. Escaping to France, he became foreign minister for James Francis Edward Stuart. He was attainted for treason but reversed course and was allowed to return to England in 1723. According to Ruth Mack, &quot;Bolingbroke is best known for his party politics, including the ideological history he disseminated in &quot;The Craftsman&quot; (1726–1735) by adopting the formerly Whig theory of the Ancient Constitution and giving it new life as an anti-Walpole Tory principle.&quot;

== Early life ==

Henry St John was most probably born at Lydiard Tregoze, the family seat in Wiltshire, and christened in Battersea. St John was the son of Sir Henry St John, 4th Baronet later 1st Viscount St John, and Lady Mary Rich, daughter of the 3rd Earl of Warwick. Although it has been asserted that St John was educated at Eton College and Christ Church, Oxford, his name does not appear on registers for either institution and there is no evidence to support either claim. It is possible he was educated at a Dissenting academy.

He travelled to France, Switzerland and Italy during 1698 and 1699 and acquired an exceptional knowledge of French. St John made friends with the Whigs James Stanhope and Edward Hopkins and corresponded with the Tory Sir William Trumball, who advised him: &quot;There appears indeed amongst us [in England] a strong disposition to liberty, but neither honesty nor virtue enough to support it&quot;.

Oliver Goldsmith reported that he had been seen to &quot;run naked through the park in a state of intoxication&quot;. Jonathan Swift, his intimate friend, said that he wanted to be thought the Alcibiades or Petronius of his age, and to mix licentious orgies with the highest political responsibilities. In 1700, he married Frances, daughter of Sir Henry Winchcombe of Bucklebury, Berkshire, but this made little difference to his lifestyle.

== Early career ==

He became a Member of Parliament in 1701, representing the family borough of Wootton Bassett in Wiltshire, as a Tory. His seat was Lydiard Park at Lydiard Tregoze, now in the Borough of Swindon. He attached himself to Robert Harley (afterwards Lord Oxford), then Speaker of the House of Commons, and distinguished himself by his eloquence in debate, eclipsing his schoolfellow, Robert Walpole, and gaining an extraordinary ascendancy over the House of Commons. In May, he had charge of the bill for securing the Protestant succession; he took part in the impeachment of the Whig lords for their conduct concerning the Partition treaties, and opposed the oath of loyalty against the &quot;Old Pretender&quot;. In March 1702, he was chosen commissioner for taking the public accounts.

After Queen Anne&#x27;s accession, St John supported the bills in 1702 and 1704 against occasional conformity, and took a leading part in the disputes which arose between the two Houses. In 1704, St John took office with Harley as secretary at war, thus being brought into intimate relations with John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough, by whom he was treated with favour. In 1708, he left office with Harley on the failure of the latter&#x27;s intrigue, and retired to the country till 1710, when he became a privy counsellor and secretary of state in Harley&#x27;s new ministry, representing Berkshire in parliament. He supported the bill for requiring a real property qualification for a seat in parliament. In 1711 he founded the Brothers&#x27; Club, a society of Tory politicians and men of letters, and the same year witnessed the failure of the two expeditions to the West Indies and to Canada promoted by him. In 1712, he was the author of the bill taxing newspapers.

The refusal of the Whigs to make peace with France in 1706, and again in 1709 when Louis XIV offered to yield every point for which the allies professed to be fighting, showed that the war was not being continued in the national interest, and the queen, Parliament and the people supported the ministry in its wish to terminate hostilities. Because of the diversity of aims among the allies, St John was induced to enter into separate and secret negotiations with France for the security of English interests. In May 1712, he ordered the Duke of Ormonde, who had succeeded Marlborough in command, to refrain from any further engagement. These instructions were communicated to the French, though not to the allies, Louis putting Dunkirk as security into possession of England, and the English troops deserted their allies almost on the battlefield. Subsequently, St John received the congratulations of the French foreign minister, de Torcy, on the French victory over Prince Eugene at Denain (24 July 1712).

In June 1712, St John&#x27;s commercial treaty with France, establishing free trade with that country, was rejected by the House of Commons. The treaty was presented in the Commons by Arthur Moore as St John had been created Viscount Bolingbroke earlier that year. A major campaign was waged against its approval under the slogan &quot;No Peace Without Spain&quot;. At least 40 from the Tories voted to reject the treaty. In August 1712, Bolingbroke went to France and signed an armistice between England and France for four months. Finally, the Treaty of Utrecht was signed in March 1713 by all the allies except the emperor. The first production of Addison&#x27;s &quot;Cato&quot; was made by the Whigs the occasion of a great demonstration of indignation against the peace, and by Bolingbroke for presenting the actor Barton Booth with a purse of fifty guineas for &quot;defending the cause of liberty against a perpetual dictator&quot;.

Meanwhile, the friendship between Bolingbroke and Harley, the basis of the whole Tory administration, had been gradually dissolved. In March 1711, when the Marquis de Guiscard made an attempt on Harley&#x27;s life, Bolingbroke assumed temporary leadership of the ministry&#x27;s affairs. His difficulty in controlling the Tory back-benchers, however, only made Harley&#x27;s absence the more noticeable. In May, Harley obtained the earldom of Oxford and became lord treasurer, while in July, St John was greatly disappointed at receiving only his viscountcy instead of the earldom lately extinct in his family, and at being passed over for the Order of the Garter.

In September 1713 Jonathan Swift came to London and made a final vain attempt to reconcile his two friends. But now a further cause of difference had arisen. The queen&#x27;s health was visibly breaking, and the Tory ministers anticipated their downfall on the accession of the Elector of Hanover. During Bolingbroke&#x27;s diplomatic mission to France he had incurred blame for remaining at the opera while the Pretender was present, and according to the Mackintosh transcripts he had several secret interviews with him. Regular communications were kept up subsequently.

In March 1714, Herville, the French envoy in London, sent to de Torcy, the French foreign minister, the substance of two long conversations with Bolingbroke in which the latter advised patience till after the accession of George I, when a great reaction was to be expected in favour of the Pretender. At the same time, he spoke of the treachery of Marlborough and Berwick, and of one Other (presumably Oxford) whom he refused to name, all of whom were in communication with Hanover. Both Oxford and Bolingbroke warned James Stuart that he could have little chance of success unless he changed his religion, but the latter&#x27;s refusal does not appear to have stopped the communications.

Bolingbroke gradually superseded Oxford in the leadership. Lady Masham, the queen&#x27;s favourite, quarrelled with Oxford and identified herself with Bolingbroke&#x27;s interests. The harsh treatment of the Hanoverian demands was inspired by him, and won favour with the queen, while Oxford&#x27;s influence declined; and by his support of the Schism Bill in May 1714, an aggressive Tory measure forbidding all education by dissenters by making an episcopal licence obligatory for schoolmasters, he probably intended to compel Oxford to give up the game. Finally, a charge of corruption brought by Oxford in July against Bolingbroke and Lady Masham, in connexion with the commercial treaty with Spain, failed, and the lord treasurer was dismissed or retired on 27 July 1714. The Queen died four days later, after appointing Shrewsbury to the lord treasurership.

== Exile ==

On the accession of George I the illuminations and bonfire at Lord Bolingbroke&#x27;s house in Golden Square were &quot;particularly fine and remarkable&quot;, but he was immediately dismissed from office. The new king had been close to the Whigs but he was willing to bring in Tories. The Tories however refused to serve and gambled everything on an election, which they lost. The triumphant Whigs systematically removed the Tories from most of the posts nationally and regionally.

Bolingbroke followed an erratic course that baffled his contemporaries and historians. He retired to Bucklebury and is said to have now written the answer to the &quot;Secret History of the White Staff&quot; accusing him of being a Jacobite. In March 1715, he in vain attempted to defend the late ministry in the new parliament; and on the announcement of Walpole&#x27;s intended attack upon the authors of the Treaty of Utrecht he gave up.
Bolingbroke fled in disguise to Paris—a major blunder. In an even greater blunder he joined the Pretender, was made Earl of Bolingbroke in the Jacobite Peerage, and took charge of foreign affairs in the Stuart court. The uprising of 1715 was badly botched and the death of Louis XIV meant the Pretender had lost his major sponsor; King Louis XV wanted peace with Britain and refused to endorse any further schemes. In March 1716, Bolingbroke switched sides again. He had lost his titles and property when Parliament voted a bill of attainder for treason, the (1 Geo. 1. St. 2. c. 16). He hoped to recover the good graces of King George, and indeed managed to do so in a few years.

He wrote his &quot;Reflexions upon Exile&quot;, and in 1717, his letter to Sir William Wyndham in explanation of his position, generally considered one of his finest compositions, but not published till 1753 after his death. The same year, he formed a liaison with a widow Marie Claire Deschamps de Marcilly, whom he married in 1720, two years after his first wife&#x27;s death. He bought and resided at the estate of La Source near Orléans, studied philosophy, criticized the chronology of the Bible, and was visited amongst others by Voltaire, who expressed unbounded admiration for his learning and politeness.

== Pardon and return ==

In 1723, through the medium of the king&#x27;s mistress, Ehrengard Melusine von der Schulenburg, Duchess of Kendal and Munster, he received a pardon and returned to London. Walpole reluctantly accepted his return. In 1725, Parliament passed the (11 Geo. 1. c. &quot;40&quot; ), which enabled him to hold real estate but without power of alienating it. But this had been effected in consequence of a peremptory order of the king, against Walpole&#x27;s wishes, who succeeded in maintaining his exclusion from the House of Lords. He now bought an estate at Dawley, near Uxbridge, where he renewed his intimacy with Pope, Swift and Voltaire, took part in Pope&#x27;s literary squabbles, and wrote the philosophy for Pope&#x27;s &quot;An Essay on Man&quot; (1734), which, at Epistle I, begins: &quot;To Henry St. John, Lord Bolingbroke:
On the first occasion which offered itself, that of Pulteney&#x27;s rupture with Walpole in 1726, he endeavoured to organize an opposition in conjunction with the former and Wyndham; and in 1727, began his celebrated series of letters to &quot;The Craftsman&quot;, attacking the Walpoles, signed &quot;an Occasional Writer&quot;. He won over the Duchess of Kendal with a bribe of £11,000 from his wife&#x27;s estates, and with Walpole&#x27;s approval obtained an audience with the king. His success was imminent, and it was thought his appointment as chief minister was assured. In Walpole&#x27;s own words, &quot;as St John had the duchess entirely on his side I need not add what must or might in time have been the consequence&quot;, and he prepared for his dismissal. But once more Bolingbroke&#x27;s &quot;fortune turned rotten at the very moment it grew ripe&quot;, and his projects and hopes were ruined by the king&#x27;s death in June.

He wrote additional essays signed &quot;John Trot&quot; that appeared in the &quot;Craftsman&quot; in 1728, and in 1730 followed &quot;Remarks on the History of England&quot; by Humphrey Oldcastle, attacking Walpole&#x27;s policy. Comment prompted by Bolingbroke was continued in the House of Commons by Wyndham, and great efforts were made to establish the alliance between the Tories and the Opposition Whigs. The Excise Bill in 1733 and the Septennial Bill in 1734 offered opportunities for further attacks on the government, which Bolingbroke supported by a new series of papers in the &quot;Craftsman&quot; styled &quot;A Dissertation on Parties&quot;; but the whole movement collapsed after the new elections, which returned Walpole to power in 1735 with a large majority.

Bolingbroke retired baffled and disappointed from the fray to France in June, residing principally at the château of Argeville near Fontainebleau. He now wrote his &quot;Letters on the Study of History&quot; (printed privately before his death and published in 1752), and the &quot;True Use of Retirement&quot;. In 1738, he visited England, became one of the leading friends and advisers of Frederick, Prince of Wales, who now headed the opposition, and wrote for the occasion &quot;The Patriot King&quot;, which together with a previous essay, &quot;The Spirit of Patriotism&quot;, and &quot;The State of Parties at the Accession of George I&quot;, were entrusted to Pope and not published. Having failed, however, to obtain any share in politics, he returned to France in 1739, and subsequently sold Dawley. In 1742 and 1743, he again visited England and quarrelled with Warburton. In 1744, he settled finally at Battersea with his friend Hugh Hume, 3rd Earl of Marchmont, and was present at Pope&#x27;s death in May. The discovery that the poet had printed secretly 1,500 copies of &quot;The Patriot King&quot;, caused him to publish a correct version in 1749, and stirred up a further altercation with Warburton, who defended his friend against Bolingbroke&#x27;s bitter aspersions, the latter, whose conduct was generally reprehended, publishing a &quot;Familiar Epistle to the most Impudent Man Living&quot;.

== Death ==

In 1744, he had been very busy assisting in the negotiations for the establishment of the new &quot;broad bottom&quot; administration, and showed no sympathy for the Jacobite expedition in 1745. He recommended the tutor for Prince George, afterwards George III. About 1749, he wrote the &quot;Present State of the Nation&quot;, an unfinished pamphlet. Philip Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield records the last words heard from him: &quot;God who placed me here will do what He pleases with me hereafter and He knows best what to do&quot;. He died on 12 December 1751, aged 73, his second wife having predeceased him by one year. They were both buried in St Mary&#x27;s, the parish church at Battersea, where a monument with medallions and inscriptions composed by Bolingbroke was erected to their memory. The monument was sculpted by Roubiliac.

He was succeeded in the title as 2nd Viscount Bolingbroke, according to the special remainder, by his half-nephew Frederick St John, 3rd Viscount St John (a title granted to Bolingbroke&#x27;s father in 1716), from whom the title has descended. Frederick was the son of the 1st Viscount&#x27;s half-brother John St John, by his father&#x27;s second wife Angelica Magdalena Pelissary.

== Impact ==

===Influence in the United Kingdom===
Bute and George III derived their political ideas from &quot;The Patriot King&quot;. Edmund Burke wrote his &quot;Vindication of Natural Society&quot; in imitation of Bolingbroke&#x27;s style, but in refutation of his principles; and in the &quot;Reflections on the French Revolution&quot; he exclaims, &quot;Who now reads Bolingbroke, who ever read him through?&quot; Burke denied that Bolingbroke&#x27;s words left &quot;any permanent impression on his mind&quot;. Benjamin Disraeli lionized Bolingbroke as the &quot;Founder of Modern Toryism&quot;, eradicating its &quot;absurd and odious doctrines&quot;, and establishing its mission to subvert &quot;Whig attempts to transform the English Constitution into an oligarchy&quot;.

The loss of Bolingbroke&#x27;s great speeches was regretted by William Pitt more than that of the missing books of Livy and Tacitus. By the early 20th century, the writings and career of Bolingbroke would make a weaker impression than they made on contemporaries. He was thought by the author in his biography in &quot;A Short Biographical Dictionary of English&quot; (1910) to be a man of brilliant and versatile talents, but selfish, insincere and intriguing, defects of character which arguably led to his political ruin; and his writings were described as glittering, artificial and lacking philosophical merit. Philip Chesney Yorke, his biographer in the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; 11th Edition, commented that his abilities were exercised upon ephemeral objects, and not inspired by lasting or universal ideas.

===Enlightenment philosophy===
Bolingbroke held certain views of opposition to church and theological teachings, which may have had influence during the Age of Enlightenment. The atheist antireligious French-German philosopher Baron d&#x27;Holbach quotes Bolingbroke in his political work &quot;Good Sense&quot;, in reference to Bolingbroke&#x27;s statements against religion.

===Republicanism in the United States===
In the late 20th century, Bolingbroke was rediscovered by historians as a major influence on Voltaire, and on the American patriots John Adams, Thomas Jefferson and James Madison. Adams said that he had read all of Bolingbroke&#x27;s works at least five times; Bolingbroke&#x27;s works were widely read in the American colonies, where they helped provide the foundation for the emerging nation&#x27;s devotion to republicanism. His vision of history as cycles of birth, growth, decline and death of a republic was influential in the colonies, as was his contention on liberty: that one is &quot;free not from the law, but by the law&quot;. Bolingbroke, Georgia, was named after him.

== Country Party ==

Bolingbroke was especially influential in stating the need and outlining the machinery of a systematic parliamentary opposition. Such an opposition he called a &quot;country party&quot; which he opposed to the court party. Country parties had been formed before, for instance after the king&#x27;s speech to Parliament in November 1685, but Bolingbroke was the first to state the need for a continual opposition to the government. To his mind the spirit of liberty was threatened by the court party&#x27;s lust for power.

Liberty could only be safeguarded by an opposition party that used &quot;constitutional methods and a legal course of opposition to the excesses of legal and ministerial power&quot;. He instructed the opposition party to &quot;Wrest the power of government, if you can, out of the hands that employed it weakly and wickedly&quot;. This work could be done only by a homogeneous party &quot;because such a party alone will submit to a drudgery of this kind&quot;. It was not enough to be eager to speak, keen to act. &quot;They who affect to head an opposition ... must be equal, at least, to those whom they oppose&quot;. The opposition had to be of a permanent nature to make sure that it would be looked at as a part of daily politics. It had on every occasion to confront the government. He considered a party that systematically opposed the government to be more appealing than a party that did so occasionally. This opposition had to prepare itself to control government.

* &quot;The Works of the Late Right Honorable Henry St. John, Lord Viscount Bolingbroke&quot; was first published in March 1754 in five quarto volumes, and it was made popular by its controversial outlooks on religion. A decade later, the highly successful London bookseller Andrew Millar was still selling the &quot;Works&quot; for a considerable fortune, setting the price at three guineas (three pounds and three shillings), a clear indication of the importance and value of the text. In a letter to Dr. Cadell in July 1765, Millar wrote &quot;I never sold a Bolingbroke in quarto under 3 guineas ... Wren paid so and I can&#x27;t now alter the price&quot;.

<doc id="206027" wikidata="Q441448" url="?curid=206027" title="Carpocrates">
<text>Carpocrates of Alexandria (Greek: Καρποκράτης) was the founder of an early Gnostic sect from the first half of the 2nd century, known as Carpocratians. As with many Gnostic sects, the Carpocratians are known only through the writings of the Church Fathers, principally Irenaeus of Lyons and Clement of Alexandria. As these writers strongly opposed Gnostic doctrine, there is a question of negative bias when using this source. While the various references to the Carpocratians differ in some details, they agree as to the libertinism of the sect, a charge commonly levied by pagans against Christians and conversely by Christians against pagans and heretics.

==Irenaeus==
The earliest and most vivid account of Carpocrates and his followers comes from Irenaeus (died 202) in his &quot;Against Heresies&quot; including an account of the theology and practice of the sect.

Irenaeus wrote that the Carpocratians believed that Jesus was not divine; but because his soul was &quot;steadfast and pure&quot;, he &quot;remembered those things which he had witnessed within the sphere of the unbegotten God&quot; (similar to Plato&#x27;s concept of Anamnesis). Because of this, Jesus was able to free himself from the material powers (what other Gnostics call Archons, the Demiurge, etc.). Carpocratians believed they themselves could transcend the material realm, and therefore were no longer bound by Mosaic law, which was based on the material powers, or by any other morality, which they held was mere human opinion. Irenaeus offers this belief as an explanation of their licentious behaviour.

Irenaeus then goes on to provide his further, slightly different, explanation. The followers of Carpocrates, he says, believed that in order to leave this world, one&#x27;s imprisoned eternal soul must pass through every possible condition of earthly life. Moreover, it is possible to do this within one lifetime. As a result, the Carpocratians did &quot;all those things which we dare not either speak or hear of&quot; so that when they died, they would not be compelled to incarnate again but would return to God. (Borges depicts a fictional sect with this belief in his short story &quot;The Theologians&quot;.)

Irenaeus says that they practised various magical arts as well as leading a licentious life. He also says that they possessed a portrait of Christ, a painting they claimed had been made by Pontius Pilate during his lifetime, which they honoured along with images of Plato, Pythagoras and Aristotle &quot;in the manner of the Gentiles&quot;.

Some early Christian authors opposed representational art, and statues and portraits and sculptures are crude and stylised. According to Robin Lane Fox: &quot;Only one group of early Christians, the heretical Carpocratians, are known to have owned portraits of Christ&quot;. However, early Christian art from the early third century depicting Jesus is widespread and cannot be limited only to the Carpocratians. Furthermore, the fact that depictions of Jesus are mentioned by multiple early Christian authors, whether in a positive or negative manner, is an indication that these depictions were popular enough to be noticed and must have received the acceptance of some Christian authorities. Moreover, Christianity is rooted in Judaism, which generally forbids religious depictions, and the reluctance of some authors to accept depictions of Jesus could be ascribed to the Jewish roots of Christianity rather than to any non-Jewish Christian doctrine.

Carpocrates is also mentioned by Clement of Alexandria in his &quot;Stromateis&quot;. Clement quotes extensively from &quot;On Righteousness&quot; which he says was written by Epiphanes, Carpocrates&#x27; son. No copy outside of Clement&#x27;s citation exists, but the writing is of a strongly antinomian bent. It claims that differences in class and the ownership of property are unnatural, and argues for property and women to be held in common. Clement insists on the alleged licentiousness of the Carpocratians, claiming that at their Agape (meaning an early Christian gathering) they &quot;have intercourse where they will and with whom they will&quot;.

According to Clement, Carpocrates was from Alexandria although his sect was primarily located in Cephallenia.

Carpocrates is again mentioned in the controversial &quot;Mar Saba letter&quot; (also called &quot;To Theodore)&quot;, purportedly also by Clement of Alexandria, which was discovered by Morton Smith while cataloging books at the Monastery of Mar Saba in 1958. This document was examined by several other scholars in the preceding decades, including Quentin Quesnell. The letter details how Carpocrates obtained the copy of &quot;Secret Gospel of Mark&quot;:But since the foul demons are always devising destruction for the race of men, Carpocrates, instructed by them and using deceitful arts, so enslaved a certain presbyter of the church in Alexandria that he got from him a copy of the secret Gospel, which he both interpreted according to his blasphemous and carnal doctrine and, moreover, polluted, mixing with the spotless and holy words utterly shameless lies. From this mixture is drawn off the teaching of the Carpocratians. The letter mentions and quotes from the previously unknown &quot;Secret Mark,&quot; focusing on the episode where Jesus brings a youth back from the dead. The letter&#x27;s writer (perhaps Clement) tells Theodore that the secret version of Mark does not contain references to &quot;the many other [things about] which you wrote&quot; including the specific phrase &quot;naked with naked.&quot;

==Miscellaneous references==
Other references to Carpocrates exist but are likely to be based on the two already cited.

Epiphanius of Salamis writes that
Carpocrates is also mentioned by Tertullian and Hippolytus, both of whom seem to rely on Irenaeus; and also perhaps by Origen and Hegesippus.

Søren Kierkegaard mentioned them in his 1844 book, &quot;The Concept of Anxiety&quot;:

<doc id="206029" wikidata="Q468160" url="?curid=206029" title="Paul Rand">
<text>Paul Rand (born Peretz Rosenbaum; August 15, 1914 – November 26, 1996) was an American art director and graphic designer. He was best known for his corporate logo designs, including the logos for IBM, UPS, Enron, Morningstar, Inc., Westinghouse, ABC, and NeXT. He developed an American Modernistic style from European influences and was one of the first American commercial artists to embrace and practice the Swiss Style of graphic design.

Rand was a professor emeritus of graphic design at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut where he taught from 1956 to 1969, and from 1974 to 1985. He was inducted into the New York Art Directors Club Hall of Fame in 1972.

== Early life and education ==
Paul Rand was born Peretz Rosenbaum on August 15, 1914, in Brooklyn, New York. He embraced design at a very young age, painting signs for his father&#x27;s grocery store as well as for school events at P.S. 109. Rand&#x27;s father did not believe art could provide his son with a sufficient livelihood, and so he required Paul to attend Manhattan&#x27;s Haaren High School while taking night classes at the Pratt Institute. Rand was largely &quot;self-taught&quot; as a designer, learning about the works of Cassandre and Moholy-Nagy from European magazines such as &quot;Gebrauchsgraphik&quot;.&quot; Rand also attended Parsons School of Design and the Art Students League of New York.

== Early career ==
His career began with humble assignments, starting with a part-time position creating stock images for a syndicate that supplied graphics to various newspapers and magazines. Between his class assignments and his work, Rand was able to amass a fairly large portfolio, largely influenced by the German advertising style Sachplakat (object poster) as well as the works of Gustav Jensen. It was around this time that he decided to camouflage the overtly Jewish identity conveyed by his name, Peretz Rosenbaum, shortening his forename to &#x27;Paul&#x27; and taking &#x27;Rand&#x27; from an uncle to form a Madison Avenue-friendly surname. Morris Wyszogrod, a friend and associate of Rand, noted that &quot;he figured that &#x27;Paul Rand,&#x27; four letters here, four letters there, would create a nice symbol. So he became Paul Rand.&quot; Roy R. Behrens notes the importance of this new title: &quot;Rand&#x27;s new persona, which served as the brand name for his many accomplishments, was the first corporate identity he created, and it may also eventually prove to be the most enduring.&quot; Indeed, Rand was rapidly moving into the forefront of his profession.
In his early twenties, he was producing work that began to garner international acclaim, notably his designs on the covers of &quot;Direction&quot; magazine, which Rand produced for no fee in exchange for full artistic freedom. Among the accolades Rand received were those of László Moholy-Nagy:

The reputation Rand so rapidly amassed in his prodigious twenties never dissipated; rather, it only managed to increase through the years as his influential works and writings firmly established him as the &quot;éminence grise&quot; of his profession.

Although Rand was most famous for the corporate logos he created in the 1950s and 1960s, his early work in page design was the initial source of his reputation. In 1936, Rand was given the job of setting the page layout for an &quot;Apparel Arts&quot; (now &quot;GQ)&quot; magazine anniversary issue. &quot;His remarkable talent for transforming mundane photographs into dynamic compositions, which ... gave editorial weight to the page&quot; earned Rand a full-time job, as well as an offer to take over as art director for the Esquire-Coronet magazines. Initially, Rand refused this offer, claiming that he was not yet at the level the job required, but a year later he decided to go ahead with it, taking over responsibility for Esquire&#x27;s fashion pages at the young age of twenty-three.

The cover art for &quot;Direction&quot; magazine proved to be an important step in the development of the &quot;Paul Rand look&quot; that was not as yet fully developed. The December 1940 cover, which uses barbed wire to present the magazine as both a war-torn gift and a crucifix, is indicative of the artistic freedom Rand enjoyed at &quot;Direction&quot;; in &quot;Thoughts on Design&quot; Rand notes that it &quot;is significant that the crucifix, aside from its religious implications, is a demonstration of pure plastic form as well ... a perfect union of the aggressive vertical (male) and the passive horizontal (female).&quot;

== Corporate identities ==

Rand&#x27;s most widely known contributions to design are his corporate identities, many of which are still in use. IBM, ABC, Cummins Engine, UPS, and Enron, among many others, owe Rand their graphical heritage. One of his strengths, as Moholy-Nagy pointed out, was his ability as a salesman to explain the needs his identities would address for the corporation. According to graphic designer Louis Danziger:

Rand&#x27;s defining corporate identity was his IBM logo in 1956, which as Mark Favermann notes &quot;was not just an identity but a basic design philosophy which permeated corporate consciousness and public awareness.&quot; The logo was modified by Rand in 1960. The striped logo was created in 1972. The stripes were introduced as a half-toning technique to make the IBM mark slightly less heavy and more dynamic. Two variations of the &quot;striped&quot; logo were designed; one with eight stripes, one with thirteen stripes. The bolder mark with eight stripes was intended as the company&#x27;s default logo, while the more delicate thirteen stripe version was used for situations where a more refined look was required, such as IBM executive stationery and business cards. Rand also designed packaging, marketing materials and assorted communications for IBM from the late 1950s until the late 1990s, including the well known Eye-Bee-M poster. Although Ford appointed Rand in the 1960s to redesign their corporate logo, it refused to use his modernized design.

Although the logos may be interpreted as simplistic, Rand was quick to point out in &quot;A Designer&#x27;s Art&quot; that &quot;ideas do not need to be esoteric to be original or exciting.&quot; His Westinghouse trademark, created in 1960, epitomizes that ideal of minimalism while proving Rand&#x27;s point that a logo &quot;cannot survive unless it is designed with the utmost simplicity and restraint.&quot; Rand remained vital as he aged, continuing to produce important corporate identities into the eighties and nineties with a rumored $100,000 price per single design. The most notable of his later works was his collaboration with Steve Jobs for the NeXT Computer corporate identity; Rand&#x27;s simple black box breaks the company name into two lines, producing a visual harmony that endeared the logogram to Jobs. Jobs was pleased; just prior to Rand&#x27;s death in 1996, his former client labeled him &quot;the greatest living graphic designer.&quot;

== Later years ==
Rand devoted his final years to design work and the writing of his memoirs. In 1996, he died of cancer at age 82 in Norwalk, Connecticut.

Prior to his death, Rand asked his friend and fellow graphic designer Fred Troller to design his headstone. Graphic design author Steven Heller, known for his insightful commentary on design principles, offered praise for Rand&#x27;s memorial. Heller stated “The memorial stands out among rows of traditional tombstones in the Connecticut cemetery for its economical beauty, subtle ingenuity, and elegant typography.&quot;

==Influences and other works==

===Development of theory===
Though Rand was a recluse in his creative process, doing the vast majority of the design load despite having a large staff at varying points in his career, he was very interested in producing books of theory to illuminate his philosophies. László Moholy-Nagy may have incited Rand&#x27;s zeal for knowledge when he asked his colleague, at their first meeting, if he read art criticism. Rand said no, prompting Moholy-Nagy to reply &quot;Pity.&quot; Steven Heller elaborates on this meeting&#x27;s impact, noting; &quot;from that moment on, Rand devoured books by the leading philosophers on art, including Roger Fry, Alfred North Whitehead, and John Dewey.&quot; These theoreticians would have a lasting impression on Rand&#x27;s work; in a 1995 interview with Michael Kroeger discussing, among other topics, the importance of Dewey&#x27;s &quot;Art as Experience&quot;, Rand elaborates on Dewey&#x27;s appeal:

Dewey is an important source for Rand&#x27;s underlying sentiment in graphic design; on page one of Rand&#x27;s groundbreaking &quot;Thoughts on Design&quot;, the author begins drawing lines from Dewey&#x27;s philosophy to the need for &quot;functional-aesthetic perfection&quot; in modern art. Among the ideas Rand pushed in &quot;Thoughts on Design&quot; was the practice of creating graphic works capable of retaining recognizable quality even after being blurred or mutilated, a test Rand routinely performed on his corporate identities.

====Criticism====

During Rand&#x27;s later career, he became increasingly agitated about the rise of postmodernist theory and aesthetic in design. In 1992, Rand resigned his position at Yale in protest of the appointment of postmodern designer Sheila Levrant de Bretteville, and convinced his colleague Armin Hofmann to do the same. In justification of his resignation, Rand penned the article &quot;Confusion and Chaos: The Seduction of Contemporary Graphic Design&quot;, in which he denounced the postmodern movement as &quot;faddish and frivolous&quot; and &quot;harbor[ing] its own built-in boredom&quot;.

Despite the importance graphic designers place on his book &quot;Thoughts on Design&quot;, subsequent works such as &quot;From Lascaux to Brooklyn&quot; (1996), compounded accusations of Rand being &quot;reactionary and hostile to new ideas about design.&quot; Steven Heller defends Rand&#x27;s later ideas, calling the designer &quot;an enemy of mediocrity, a radical modernist&quot; while Favermann considers the period one of &quot;a reactionary, angry old man.&quot; Regardless of this dispute, Rand&#x27;s contribution to modern graphic design theory in total is widely considered intrinsic to the profession&#x27;s development.

===Modernist influences===
The core ideology that drove Rand&#x27;s career, and hence his lasting influence, was the modernist philosophy he so revered. He celebrated the works of artists from Paul Cézanne to Jan Tschichold, and constantly attempted to draw the connections between their creative output and significant applications in graphic design. In &quot;A Designer&#x27;s Art&quot; Rand clearly demonstrates his appreciation for the underlying connections:

<text>is a scrolling shooter developed and released by Sega as an arcade video game in 1982. The player pilots a ship through heavily defended space fortresses. Japanese electronics company Ikegami Tsushinki was also involved in the game&#x27;s development.

&quot;Zaxxon&quot; was the first game to employ axonometric projection, which lent its name to the game (&quot;AXXON&quot; from &quot;AXON&quot;ometric projection). The type of axonometric projection is isometric projection: this effect simulates three dimensions from a third-person viewpoint. It was also the first arcade game to be advertised on television, with a commercial produced by Paramount Pictures for $150,000. The game was a critical and commercial success upon release, becoming one of the top five highest-grossing arcade games of 1982 in the United States. 

Sega released a modified version as, &quot;Super Zaxxon&quot; the same year and the &quot;Zaxxon&quot;-like shooter &quot;Future Spy&quot; in 1984.

== Gameplay ==
The objective of the game is to hit as many targets as possible without being shot down or running out of fuel—which can be replenished by blowing up fuel drums (300 points). There are two fortresses to fly through, with an outer space segment between them. At the end of the second fortress is a boss in the form of the Zaxxon robot.

The player&#x27;s ship casts a shadow to indicate its height. An altimeter is also displayed; in space there is nothing for the ship to cast a shadow on. The walls at the entrance and exit of each fortress have openings that the ship must be at the right altitude to pass through. Within each fortress are additional walls that the ship&#x27;s shadow and altimeter aid in flying over successfully.

The game is controlled by a four-directional joystick. On arcade cabinets this is an aircraft-type stick with a molded hand grip. Pushing forward makes the player&#x27;s aircraft lower in altitude and pulling back makes it rise. The aircraft cannot move forward or backward; it flies at constant speed. As this sort of control and movement was not common in video games, the arcade cabinets have illustrations around the joystick to indicate the effect of each position on the aircraft.

== Ports ==
Between 1982 and 1985, &quot;Zaxxon&quot; was ported to the Apple II, Atari 8-bit computers, Atari 2600, Atari 5200, MSX, ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, Dragon 32, ColecoVision, Intellivision, IBM PC compatibles, SG-1000, TRS-80 Color Computer, and TRS-80. The Atari 2600 and Intellivision ports use a third-person, behind-the-ship perspective instead of the isometric graphics of the other versions.

In 1984 a clone was released for the Acorn BBC Micro series, under the title Fortress.

== Reception ==
=== Commercial ===
The arcade game was a major commercial success in North America. &quot;Zaxxon&quot; reached the top of the monthly US &quot;RePlay&quot; arcade charts in June 1982. The Amusement &amp; Music Operators Association (AMOA) later listed it among the top six highest-grossing arcade games of 1982 in the United States.

The game did not appear on the annual &quot;&quot; lists of top twenty highest-grossing arcade games 1982. &quot;Game Machine&quot; later listed &quot;Zaxxon&quot; in their June 1, 1983 issue as the eighth top-grossing table arcade cabinet of the month.

The ColecoVision version was also commercially successful. &quot;Zaxxon&quot; was Coleco&#x27;s best-selling non-bundled cartridge for the ColecoVision up until 1983.

The home computer ports were commercially successful in North America and Europe. &quot;II Computing&quot; listed &quot;Zaxxon&quot; fourth on its list of top Apple II games as of late 1985, based on sales and market-share data. On home computers in the United States, &quot;Zaxxon&quot; received a &quot;Gold Award&quot; from the Software Publishers Association (SPA) in December 1987 for software sales above 100,000 units. U.S. Gold&#x27;s home computer version of &quot;Zaxxon&quot; was ranked number-two on the UK software sales chart in early 1985.

=== Reviews ===
The arcade game was well received upon release. David Cohen in his book &quot;Video Games&quot; praised the &quot;incredible three-dimensional realism&quot; in the graphics, which he considered the best in a video game to date, while describing the gameplay as &quot;a mixture of driving and zap game.&quot; &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; praised the game for being &quot;at the frontier of a third dimension in arcade games&quot; and for its &quot;realistic&quot; altitude-based gameplay for the time.

&quot;Video Games&quot; in 1983 called the ColecoVision version of &quot;Zaxxon&quot; a &quot;coup for this new system&quot;. &quot;Video&quot; magazine also praised the ColecoVision version in its &quot;Arcade Alley&quot; column, describing it as &quot;one of the most thrilling games available&quot;, and noting in passing that the only &quot;serious criticism&quot; of the arcade original was that &quot;many players felt they needed flying lessons to have even a ghost of a chance of performing well&quot;. &quot;K-Power&quot; rated the Color Computer version with 8 points out of 10. The magazine praised its &quot;excellent three-dimensional graphics&quot;, and concluded that &quot;&quot;Zaxxon&quot; is a game that can&#x27;t be praised enough&quot;.

&quot;Softline&quot; in 1983 called the Atari 8-bit version &quot;a superb three-dimensional computer game ... Not since &quot;Choplifter&quot; has a game looked so impressive&quot;. The magazine also liked the graphics of the Apple II and TRS-80 versions despite those computers&#x27; hardware limitations, and predicted that &quot;Zaxxon&quot; would be a &quot;long-lived bestseller&quot;. In 1984 the magazine&#x27;s readers named the game the fifth most-popular Apple program, the worst Apple program, and third-worst Atari program of 1983. &quot;InfoWorld&#x27;s Essential Guide to Atari Computers&quot; cited it as a good Atari arcade game, citing &quot;its distinctive three-dimensional graphics&quot;.

=== Awards ===
At the 1982 Arkie Awards, the arcade game received a Certificate of Merit as runner-up for Best Science Fiction/Fantasy Coin-Op Game. At the 1983 Arcade Awards, the console cartridge conversion received a Certificate of Merit as runner-up for Videogame of the Year. At the 1984 Arkie Awards, the dedicated console version was awarded Stand-Alone Game of the Year, while the home computer conversion received a Certificate of Merit as runner-up for Computer Game of the Year. In January 1985, &quot;Electronic Games&quot; magazine included &quot;Zaxxon&quot; in its Hall of Fame. In 1995, Flux magazine ranked the arcade version 51st on their &quot;Top 100 Video Games.&quot;

== Legacy ==
=== Re-releases ===
&quot;Zaxxon&quot; is a bonus game in the &quot;Sega Genesis Collection&quot; for the PlayStation 2. It is also an unlockable arcade game in &quot;Sonic&#x27;s Ultimate Genesis Collection&quot; for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. The arcade version was released on the Wii Virtual Console in Japan on December 15, 2009, the PAL region on March 5, 2010, and North America on April 12, 2010. In 2022, the original arcade version will be included as part of the Sega Astro City Mini V, a vertically oriented variant of the Sega Astro City mini console.

=== Sequels ===
&quot;Zaxxon&quot; was followed by an arcade sequel in November 1982: &quot;Super Zaxxon&quot;. It has a different color scheme, the player&#x27;s ship flies faster (making the game more difficult), the space segment is replaced with a tunnel, and the enemy at the end of the second fortress is a dragon. It did not do as well as the original. &quot;Super Zaxxon&quot; topped the US &quot;RePlay&quot; arcade chart for software conversion kits in July 1983. In 1984, Sega released &quot;Future Spy&quot; with a similar style.

In 1987 &quot;Zaxxon 3-D&quot; was released for the Master System. This console variation makes use of the 3-D glasses add-on. As with the Atari 2600 and Intellivision ports, it is forward-scrolling rather than isometric.

&quot;Zaxxon&#x27;s Motherbase 2000&quot; was released for the Sega 32X in 1995. It is the first &quot;Zaxxon&quot; game to incorporate polygon graphics. The game bore the &quot;Zaxxon&quot; brand only in the United States, as the Japanese version was named &quot;Parasquad&quot; and the European version was named &quot;Motherbase&quot;. U.S. gaming critics generally remarked that the game was not similar enough to &quot;Zaxxon&quot; to justify the use of the brand.

&quot;Zaxxon Escape&quot; was released on October 4, 2012, for iOS and Android devices. The game was criticized for having little resemblance to the original.

=== Popular culture ===
In 1982 Milton Bradley released a &quot;Zaxxon&quot; board game.
In 2012, &quot;Zaxxon&quot; was shown at &quot;The Art of Video Games&quot; exhibition at the Smithsonian.

<text>Nicholas Drain Lowe (born 24 March 1949) is an English singer-songwriter, musician and producer. A noted figure in pub rock, power pop and new wave, Lowe has recorded a string of well-reviewed solo albums. Along with being a vocalist, Lowe plays guitar, bass guitar, piano and harmonica.

He is best known for the songs &quot;Cruel to Be Kind&quot; (a US top 40 single) and &quot;I Love the Sound of Breaking Glass&quot; (a top 10 UK hit), as well as his production work with Elvis Costello, Graham Parker, and others. Lowe also wrote &quot;(What&#x27;s So Funny &#x27;Bout) Peace, Love, and Understanding&quot;, a hit for Costello and &quot;I Knew the Bride (When She Used to Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll)&quot;, a hit for Rockpile bandmate Dave Edmunds.

==Biography==
Lowe attended the independent Woodbridge School in Suffolk. He began his musical career in 1967, when he joined the band Kippington Lodge, along with his school friend Brinsley Schwarz. They released a few singles on the Parlophone record label as Kippington Lodge before they renamed the band Brinsley Schwarz in late 1969 and began performing country and blues-rock. The band were launched by their management company Famepushers Ltd with an appearance at New York&#x27;s Fillmore East; a planeload of British journalists were flown over by Famepushers to witness the event, but the stunt backfired and Brinsley Schwarz became a laughing stock until they established credibility on the London pub rock circuit. Lowe wrote some of his best-known compositions while a member of the band, including &quot;(What&#x27;s So Funny &#x27;Bout) Peace, Love, and Understanding&quot;, a hit for Elvis Costello in 1979; and &quot;Cruel to Be Kind&quot;, also in 1979, Lowe&#x27;s single and biggest worldwide hit, co-written with bandmate Ian Gomm.

After leaving Brinsley Schwarz in 1975 Lowe began playing bass in Rockpile with Dave Edmunds. In August 1976, Lowe released &quot;So It Goes&quot; b/w &quot;Heart of the City&quot;, the first single on the Stiff Records label, where he was an in-house producer. The single and the label were initially funded by a loan of £400 from Dr. Feelgood&#x27;s Lee Brilleaux. The label&#x27;s first EP was Lowe&#x27;s 1977 four-track release &quot;Bowi&quot;, apparently named in response to David Bowie&#x27;s contemporaneous LP &quot;Low&quot;. The joke was repeated when Lowe produced the Rumour&#x27;s album &quot;Max&quot; as an &#x27;answer&#x27; to Fleetwood Mac&#x27;s &quot;Rumours&quot;. Lowe continued producing albums on Stiff and other labels, including The Damned’s first album. In 1977 he produced Dr. Feelgood&#x27;s album, &quot;Be Seeing You&quot;, which included &quot;That&#x27;s It, I Quit&quot;, written by Lowe. &quot;Private Practice&quot;, issued the next year, included &quot;Milk and Alcohol&quot;, written by Lowe and Gypie Mayo. This song and &quot;I Love the Sound of Breaking Glass&quot; are the only Lowe compositions to reach the Top 10 of the UK Singles Chart.

Because the two main singers in Rockpile had recording contracts with different record labels and managers, albums were always credited to either Lowe or Edmunds, so there is only one official Rockpile album, 1980&#x27;s &quot;Seconds of Pleasure&quot;, which was not released until the waning days of the collaboration. &quot;Seconds of Pleasure&quot; featured the Lowe songs &quot;When I Write the Book&quot; and &quot;Heart&quot;. However, two of the pair&#x27;s most significant solo albums from the period, Lowe&#x27;s &quot;Labour of Lust&quot; and Edmunds&#x27; &quot;Repeat When Necessary&quot;, were effectively Rockpile albums, as was Carlene Carter&#x27;s Lowe-produced &quot;Musical Shapes&quot; album. Lowe&#x27;s album &quot;Labour of Lust&quot; received a gold certification in Canada in November 1979. &quot;Cruel to Be Kind&quot;, drawn from that album, was Lowe&#x27;s only international Top 40 hit, coincidentally reaching No. 12 in four separate territories: the UK, Canada, Australia, and the US (on &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart) in 1979. &quot;Cruel To Be Kind&quot;, which was a new Rockpile re-recording of a previously issued Brinsley Schwarz outtake, also charted in the top 40 in Ireland and New Zealand.

In 1979, Lowe married country singer Carlene Carter, daughter of fellow country singers Carl Smith and June Carter Cash and stepdaughter of Johnny Cash. He adopted her daughter, Tiffany Anastasia Lowe. The marriage ended in 1990, but they remained friends, and Lowe remained close to the Carter/Cash family. He played and recorded with Johnny Cash, and Cash recorded several of Lowe&#x27;s songs. Lowe and Carter&#x27;s 1979 wedding was filmed and the footage became the basis for the promotional video clip for &quot;Cruel to Be Kind&quot;.

After the demise of Rockpile, Lowe toured for a period with his band Noise to Go and later with the Cowboy Outfit, which also included the noted keyboard player Paul Carrack. Lowe was also a member of the short-lived mainly studio project Little Village with John Hiatt, Ry Cooder and Jim Keltner, who originally got together to record Hiatt&#x27;s 1987 album &quot;Bring the Family&quot;.

In 1990 he wrote a song, &quot;Who Was That Man?&quot; about a man who died in the King&#x27;s Cross fire. In 1992 &quot;(What&#x27;s So Funny &#x27;Bout) Peace, Love, and Understanding&quot; was covered by Curtis Stigers on the soundtrack album to &quot;The Bodyguard&quot;, an album that sold about 44 million copies worldwide.

A New York &quot;Daily News&quot; article quoted Lowe as saying his greatest fear in recent years was &quot;sticking with what you did when you were famous.&quot; &quot;I didn&#x27;t want to become one of those thinning-haired, jowly old geezers who still does the same shtick they did when they were young, slim and beautiful,&quot; he said. &quot;That&#x27;s revolting and rather tragic.&quot; Rock critic Jim Farber observed, &quot;Lowe&#x27;s recent albums, epitomised by the new &quot;At My Age&quot;, moved him out of the realms of ironic pop and animated rock and into the role of a worldly balladeer, specialising in grave vocals and graceful tunes. Lowe&#x27;s four most recent solo albums mine the wealth of American roots music, drawing on vintage country, soul and R&amp;B to create an elegant mix of his own.&quot;

Lowe was quoted as saying that he had &quot;escaped from the tyranny of the snare drum&quot; in &quot;No Depression&quot;, (September–October 2001) when explaining his move away from regular pop music that would get played on mainstream radio.

In 2008, Yep Roc and Proper Records released a thirtieth anniversary edition of Lowe&#x27;s first solo album, &quot;Jesus of Cool&quot; (entitled &quot;Pure Pop for Now People&quot; in the US, with a slightly different track listing). The re-issue includes tracks from the British and American releases in addition to several bonus tracks. In March 2009, he released a 49-track CD/DVD compilation of songs spanning his entire career. Proper Records released it in the UK and Europe, entitled &quot;Quiet Please... The New Best of Nick Lowe&quot;.

In September 2010 Yep Roc issued &quot;The Impossible Bird&quot;, &quot;Dig My Mood&quot; and &quot;The Convincer&quot; on vinyl for the first time, and after a one-night reunion concert with Elvis Costello in October in San Francisco, Lowe embarked on his first non-solo United States tour &quot;this millennium.&quot; His backing band consisted of Geraint Watkins (keyboards), Robert Treherne (drums), Johnny Scott (guitar) and Matt Radford (bass). In March 2011, Yep Roc reissued Lowe&#x27;s 1979 solo album &quot;Labour of Lust&quot;.

Lowe played Glastonbury 2011, performing a short solo set of Brinsley Schwarz tracks on The Spirit of 71 stage, where they played back in 1971, before heading to the Acoustic Stage for a full band show. On 29 October 2013, he released his first Christmas album, &quot;Quality Street&quot;, on Yep Roc Records. He performed two songs from this album on 7 December taping of NPR&#x27;s &quot;Wait Wait... Don&#x27;t Tell Me!&quot;

In spring 2019 he embarked on tours, in both the US and UK, with American instrumental rock band Los Straitjackets. In June 2019 Lowe played at the Glastonbury Festival.

==Personal life==
Lowe has been married twice. His first marriage to country singer Carlene Carter lasted from 1979 to 1990. He married designer Peta Waddington in 2010. The couple have a son.

Lowe lives in Brentford, London, England.

==Career history==

===Songwriter===
Lowe&#x27;s best-known songs include his own hits:
* &quot;So It Goes&quot; – first song on the Stiff Records label
* &quot;I Love the Sound of Breaking Glass&quot; – his biggest UK hit
* &quot;Cruel to Be Kind&quot; – his biggest US hit

He also wrote songs most famous for their cover versions:
* &quot;(What&#x27;s So Funny &#x27;Bout) Peace, Love, and Understanding&quot; – famously covered by Elvis Costello
* &quot;I Knew the Bride (When She Used to Rock ’n’ Roll)&quot; – a hit for Rockpile bandmate Dave Edmunds
* &quot;The Beast in Me&quot; – covered by stepfather-in-law Johnny Cash

Some songs were written or co-written for albums he produced:
* &quot;Milk and Alcohol&quot; and &quot;That’s It, I Quit&quot; – Dr. Feelgood
* &quot;(I Live on a) Battlefield&quot; and &quot;I Need You&quot; – Paul Carrack

Lowe also wrote a number of songs with clever wordplay that qualify as &quot;novelties&quot;, among them:
* &quot;Bay City Rollers We Love You&quot; – recorded as &quot;Terry Modern&quot; of &quot;The Tartan Horde&quot;
* &quot;I Love My Label&quot; – paean to the United Artists label, released on Stiff Records
* &quot;Time Wounds All Heels&quot; — co-written with Carlene Carter and Simon Climie
* &quot;All Men Are Liars&quot;
* &quot;Half a Boy and Half a Man&quot; - covered by George Thorogood &amp; The Destroyers

===Producer===

Lowe&#x27;s work as a producer is at least as notable as his work as a performer and songwriter. His early &#x27;rough and ready&#x27; production style earned him the nickname &quot;Basher&quot;, inspired by his supposed instructions to bands to &#x27;bash it out—we&#x27;ll tart it up later&#x27;. Beginning with his tenure at Stiff Records as an in-house producer in 1976, Lowe was responsible for producing some of the benchmark releases of punk and new wave, including the Damned&#x27;s first single, &quot;New Rose&quot;, considered the first English punk single, as well as the group&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Damned Damned Damned&quot;.

Lowe also produced Elvis Costello&#x27;s first five albums, from 1977 to 1981, including &quot;My Aim Is True&quot;, &quot;This Year&#x27;s Model&quot;, and &quot;Armed Forces&quot;, which spun off numerous UK hit singles. Other Stiff acts produced by Lowe included punk parody group Alberto y Lost Trios Paranoias, new wave singer Wreckless Eric and roots rocker Mickey Jupp.

Other clients (both before and after Lowe left Stiff in 1978) included the Pretenders (the 1978 debut single &quot;Stop Your Sobbing&quot;, which was a modest UK and U.S. hit); Graham Parker (his well-received first and third albums); Dr. Feelgood (several LPs, and their biggest hit single, 1979&#x27;s &quot;Milk and Alcohol&quot;); Johnny Cash (his 1980 single &quot;Without Love&quot;, a minor hit on the U.S. and Canadian country charts); and his then-wife Carlene Carter (2 albums in 1980 and 1981).

From 1982 to 1985, he produced material for Paul Carrack, John Hiatt, the Fabulous Thunderbirds and the Men They Couldn&#x27;t Hang. Beginning in the mid-1980s, Lowe became more selective in his choice of outside production tasks, helming the 1986 LP &quot;Blood &amp; Chocolate&quot; for Elvis Costello, a 1988 single (&quot;Windows of the World&quot; b/w &quot;1969&quot;) for the Pretenders, and the Katydids&#x27; self-titled debut album of 1990. After that, Lowe essentially retired from producing recordings for other acts, although the country-rock band the Mavericks persuaded him to produce one track for the &quot;Apollo 13&quot; soundtrack in 1995.

===Bands===
==Influence==
In 2011, &quot;The New York Times&quot; claimed: &quot;The 40-year career of the English singer-songwriter Nick Lowe constitutes a paradox: the songs he has written are better known than he is.&quot; Alex Turner, of the Arctic Monkeys, described Lowe as one of his favourite lyricists. In another interview, he said that he was &quot;blown away&quot; and sent &quot;back to square one&quot; by Lowe&#x27;s songwriting.

Wilco covered the Nick Lowe song &quot;I Love My Label&quot; as the B-side to &quot;I Might&quot; (2011) on their own dBpm label. Nick Lowe toured with Wilco for their album &quot;The Whole Love&quot; and would make guest appearances on his &quot;Cruel to Be Kind&quot; and (along with Mavis Staples) appeared onstage for a cover of the Band&#x27;s song &quot;The Weight&quot;.

<text>Luis Armando Lozada Cruz (born September 8, 1971), known by his stage name Vico C, is an American rapper, singer and record producer. Regarded as the founding father of reggaeton, Vico C has played an influential role in the development of Latin American hip hop and urban music.

== Early life and influence ==
He was born in New York and raised in Puerto Rico. Nicknamed &quot;El Filósofo del Rap&quot;, (&quot;The Philosopher of Rap&quot;), Luis Armando Lozada Cruz adopted the professional name Vico C. Vico C describes reggaeton as &quot;essentially hip-hop but with a flavor more compatible to the Caribbean.&quot;

As one of the founders of hip hop in Spanish, Vico C was able to show that it was possible for one to be able to rap entirely and compellingly in Spanish using just occasional English phrases or slang terms. He can be seen in the rap movement as far back as its &quot;underground&quot; days ghostwriting and producing music for other young performers in the Puerto Rican rap scene.

Vico C grew up in the &quot;Puerta de Tierra&quot; barrio in San Juan. He got enrolled in acting classes by the age of nine and began his professional rapping career in 1985. At first, he used to go to bodegas (grocery stores) or pharmacies, buy home recording tapes, record himself singing his songs and then sell the tapes to friends or family. Vico C was discovered by DJ Negro in 1985 whom immediately saw the great potential of hip hop in Spanish and chose to record Vico&#x27;s earliest demos. Upon the positive reaction from the barrio, DJ Negro brought Vico to the most successful hip hop promoter in Puerto Rico, Jorge Oquendo (also known as &#x27;El Sexy Boy&#x27;). Jorge Oquendo formed the record label &#x27;Prime Records&#x27; with Vico C as the lead artist of the label. Prime Records eventually received a distribution deal via Sony BMG Latin. Prime Records is one of the most successful and influential record labels in the history of Spanish rap and reggaeton known for being the home to legendary acts such as DJ Negro, Vico C, El General, Lisa M, Falo, Brewley MC and more.

In May 2019 he suffered seizures resulting from an allergic reaction to medication and was hospitalized but recovered.

== Career ==
In 1988, Spanish rap in Puerto Rico was not at a popular high, and Vico C was the first one to rap in Spanish in Puerto Rico, considered the Godfather of Spanish Hip Hop and the pioneer of this genre, there were others who followed in his footsteps, rapping in the ghettos. Brewley MC, Piro JM, Jimmy MC, Bimbo, (Lisa M, Jelly Dee Franceska, came afterward) Ruben DJ was the first rapper to sound on the radio by releasing &quot;La Escuela&quot; after Vico C fame was already known on the whole island for his underground lyrics. Brewley MC also recorded &quot;El Sida Rap with Green Records&quot;. Vico C entered the charts with his song &quot;La Recta Final&quot; which he personally designed the album cover for, with his artistic talents. Vico C was signed to Prime Records and started touring to venues in New York, Chicago, Miami, Mexico, Venezuela, El Salvador, Panama, the Dominican Republic.

Vico C, in 1992 released his singles &quot;Saborealo&quot; and &quot;María&quot; which became hits. In 1994, he established his own record company VC Records, released albums for Taino and Lissy Estrella. Also helping promote such spanish rap singers as Francheska, and Lisa M who were originally his back up dancers. In 1990, Vico C was involved in a near-fatal motorcycle accident. His injuries led to his abuse of heroin, cocaine, and alcohol.

Soon after, he became an evangelical Christian and went into a voluntary semi-retirement. In 1998, he resurfaced, with the &quot;rambunctious&quot;, Christian rap CD &quot;Aquel Que Había Muerto&quot;. The new CD went gold and in 1999, he returned to the touring scene with his concert &quot;Antes y después&quot;. Soon after, he released a sequel to &quot;Aquel Que Había Muerto&quot;. With that, he earned the Latino Rap of the year award by &quot;Billboard&quot;.

In 2003, Vico C released an album titled &quot;En Honor a la Verdad&quot;. While it was not a major hit it still sold well and one of the album&#x27;s singles &quot;El Bueno, El Malo y El Feo&quot;, referring to Eddie Dee, himself and Tego Calderón respectively. The single was widely heard. The single was a great combination of the best &quot;Conscience&quot; subgenre of rap artists.

Vico C&#x27;s recent albums include &quot;Desahogo&quot;, in early 2005. The album was a success and born June 3, 2006, he came back with another concert, &quot;El Encuentro&quot;.

The film portrays Vico C&#x27;s journey, including his rise to international fame, his Grammy Latino awards, struggles with drug addiction, imprisonment, and the death of his mother. Vico C&#x27;s son, Luis Armando &quot;Loupz&quot; Lozada Jr., portrays him in the movie, while Vico C himself contributed to the screenplay and provided coaching to the actors.

<doc id="206053" wikidata="Q7141983" url="?curid=206053" title="Pashley Cycles">
<text>Pashley Cycles is a British bicycle, tricycle and workbike manufacturer based in Stratford-upon-Avon in Warwickshire, England. The company was started in 1926 and still manufactures bikes in the UK.

==Formation and early years==
In 1926, William Rathbone &#x27;Rath&#x27; Pashley founded Pashley and Barber in New John Street West, Birmingham. Pashley and Barber declared that they were &#x27;Manufacturers of every type of cycle&#x27; and that &#x27;Birmingham produces the finest cycles, these are Birmingham&#x27;s best&#x27;. The model range included everyday roadsters, clubman racing machines, tradesmen&#x27;s carrier cycles and tandems. Rath had been apprenticed to the Austin Motor Company before the First World War and saw military service as a despatch rider. These occupations in his early years gave him engineering knowledge and skill and also a lifelong interest in two wheel transport.

Competition in the cycle trade was very fierce and after a short while &#x27;Rath&#x27; Pashley realised that success would come through identifying a market niche. A new company, Pashley Carrier Cycles, was formed to concentrate on building carrier cycles designed to withstand the abuse thrown at them by errand boys.

In 1936, the company was incorporated as W.R. Pashley Ltd and moved to a larger new factory (over 30,000 square feet) in Chester Street, Aston. As prosperity returned after the depression, the company increasingly focused on delivery and vending tricycles - for dairy products, ice cream and general deliveries.

In the 1930s, Pashley made almost every component of their cycles in their own factory - for the frames, only the tubing and lugs were bought in. Frame building, brakes, wheels, sheet metal work, polishing and enamelling were all carried out in the works.

==War years==
During the Second World War, Pashley, like many other engineering firms, turned some of its production capacity over to the war effort. Pashley&#x27;s manufacturing capability proved to be of considerable value and the company produced Browning machine gun mounts among other equipment.

==Post war==
In the years following the war, carrier cycles were still in high demand but it was the continuation of the supply of larger tricycles, and the infant development of the motor car for the mass market, that received most of Pashley&#x27;s attention. Having made motor rickshaws in the late 1940s, Pashley started the manufacture of Brockhouse Indian Motor Tricycles in 1950 - J. Brockhouse and Co. of Birmingham having acquired the Indian Motorcycle Company of Massachusetts and sub-contracted the manufacture to Pashley. These had a conventional delta tricycle layout (two wheels at the back), similar to the Pashley Pelican motorised rickshaw - with seats for up to four passengers - and the driver. Pashley were the first company to fit hydraulic brakes to what was, technically, a motorcycle. This innovation may have been influenced by Rath&#x27;s younger son, John Pashley, who worked at Girling. The prototype Pelican Rickshaw has been returned to the company and awaits restoration.

Pashley also moved briefly into car manufacture in 1953, again with a conventional tricycle layout. Perhaps the most successful of the motorised Pashley tricycles was the &#x27;3cwt Light Delivery Truck&#x27; with a Kendrick wheel layout. This meant a tadpole tricycle configuration with two wheels at the front, giving the driver a view of both the loadspace and the overall vehicle width, useful for manoeuvering in tight spaces.

As more conventional motorised transport became available to most businesses in the early 1960s, Pashley&#x27;s focus moved away from motorised vehicles and, together with the carrier cycles, trolleys, carts and street barrows, a large number of road trailers were manufactured, both as simple chassis and fully bodied.

==The 1960s and a production move==
The 1960s was a pivotal era for Pashley. Rath&#x27;s son, Dick, took control of the company on his father&#x27;s retirement. Dick had recently moved to Stratford-upon-Avon, and took the bold decision to move the company from Aston to brand new premises on Masons Road, Stratford. Production Manager John Kerby began working for the company in 1968 and remains with Pashley to this day.

With the advent of small wheel bicycles, pioneered by Alex Moulton in 1962, Dick Pashley developed a simple &#x27;shopping&#x27; tricycle, now known as the Pashley Picador. Many thousands of these have been sold since, users benefiting from the stability and low step-through frame. Its all welded construction was very unusual for the cycle industry at the time, and many years passed before other manufacturers adopted it. A similar two-wheeled shopping bicycle, the Piccolo, was also manufactured.

As traditional roadster bicycles began being removed from the ranges of other British manufacturers, Pashley decided to focus on classic roadsters. Some companies sold rebadged Pashley Roadsters in the 1980s and 1990s. These were built to the original 1920s design. For many years, versions of these saw service in large numbers under the patronage of UNICEF. Pashley still make a traditional roadster bicycle and it is still in demand in UK and export markets.

==Pashley carrier cycles and the Royal Mail==

Since inception Pashley has provided carrier cycles to industry and commerce. One of the early, equal-wheel carrier cycles Pashley sold in the 1930s (the &#x27;Model L&#x27; for £7.10.0) had a front metal tubular carrier and nameplate in a similar manner to the &#x27;Courier&#x27; that the company sells currently. This led on to motorised delivery tricycles and the manufacture of ice-cream carts, railway station platform refreshment trolleys and specialist units for the dairy and catering trades. The company continues to make ice cream vending tricycles (Classic No. 33) alongside its other workbike products.

In 1974, Pashley acquired Gundle, the only other surviving manufacturer of carrier cycles. This cemented their position in the market for this type of bike. For many years Gundle models were built alongside the Pashley range, before being absorbed into the Pashley RH range. The RH range was named after Rath&#x27;s local public house - &#x27;The Robin Hood&#x27; in Hall Green. Pashley also made &#x27;SW&#x27; (Small Wheel) bikes and does so today under the name &#x27;Delibike&#x27; (see above image).

By the late 1970s, Pashley was supplying bikes to the Royal Mail. The original Royal Mail designed mail delivery cycle was single speed and equipped with rod operated brakes. Pashley was one of a small number of UK manufacturers (including Townsends Cycles) to produce this bike and in the 1990s became the sole supplier. During the mid-1990s. Pashley proposed interim upgrades to the 1992 Royal Mail design which resulted in the &#x27;Millenium&#x27; model. This had wider tyres, reliable drum brakes and for the first time provided postal delivery staff with 3 gears.

Entering the 21st century, Pashley was faced with international competition for the supply of Royal Mail bicycles. For the first time, Royal Mail required the supplier to design the bicycle as well as manufacture it. Pashley had been developing a new load carrying bicycle called the &#x27;Pronto&#x27; which by employing a step-through frame design would allow mail and goods to be safely carried both at the front and the rear of the cycle. This was put forward to the Royal Mail. Three suppliers from the original eight European tendering companies were shortlisted and a year-long test programme started. This involved 180 bicycles from the three manufacturers. Eventually the Pronto was chosen. The Royal Mail named it the &#x27;Mailstar&#x27; and deliveries began in 2001. Pashley continues to supply the Royal Mail although vans and trolleys are replacing much of the bike fleet. Under its original name of Pronto, the bikes are still used for all types of deliveries by other companies in the UK and abroad.

In 2010, Royal Mail announced it would be retiring its fleet of bicycles, with the CEO at the time, Adam Crozier, making the decision due to safety concerns. In response, cycling charity CTC launched its &quot;Keep Posties Cycling&quot; campaign, hoping to convince the new CEO at the time, Moya Greene, to reverse the decision. The use of bicycles by Royal Mail was phased out completely by 2014.

Many refurbished Pashley Mailstars were sent to Africa by charities such as Re-Cycle and Krizevac Project. Krizevac Project refurbished 5,000 bikes in the UK, which were then sold as &quot;Elephant Bikes&quot;, with every Elephant Bike sold paying for another to be sent to Malawi.

==Product development, acquisitions and mergers==
Pashley launched the &#x27;Pickle&#x27; children&#x27;s tricycle in 1981. It was closely modelled on children&#x27;s tricycles of the 1950s and featured proper ball bearing hubs, headset, bottom bracket and pedals. This made it better to ride and more resilient than cheaper competitors. Pashley tandems made a re-appearance in the late 1970s with the introduction of the &#x27;Tourmaster&#x27;. These were constructed along simpler lines than conventional tandems, and, like the Picador, used a lugless construction. As a result, they were inexpensive and popular.

In 1984, Pashley launched what was to be its last &#x27;all British&#x27; bike - the &#x27;Patriot&#x27;. This was a conventional sports light roadster design with all the components sourced from the UK. Some components became unavailable and the Patriot name was later used on a 24-inch wheel hire bike.

For much of the 1990s, Pashley were producing one, two and three-wheeled cycles. Unicycles were an interesting side-line for the company and as well as standard and tall (&#x27;Giraffe&#x27;) models Pashley created the UMX (BMX type) and the &#x27;Muni&#x27; (Mountain Unicycle). This particular model was successful at off-road cycling events and the term Muni became a generic term for off-road unicycles thereafter.

In late 1994, the Pashley family relinquished control to the employees in a management buyout led by Adrian Williams, an aeronautical engineer.

Pashley Special Products was set up to develop and market new models. The first of these was the &#x27;Tube Rider&#x27;. It was modelled on the war-time Paratrooper&#x27;s bicycle with twin curved tubed frame. It was acclaimed by leading cycling and style magazines. The &#x27;Paramount&#x27; followed, using the same frame but fitted out with racks, mudguard and chainguard for city and commuting use. Pashley also worked with Land Rover to make an off-road model called &#x27;XCB&#x27; with hydraulic disk brakes and suspension forks.

At the end of 1997, Pashley absorbed Cresswell Cycles, a manufacturer of folding bikes and specialist trailer trikes. Production of these was transferred to Stratford-upon Avon.

During 1998, the &#x27;TV Series&#x27; range of bikes was introduced. Pashley had a number of talented Trial and Trails riders in its employ: Matt and Eddie Tongue, Tim Stedman, Kye and Toby Forte and Dylan Clayton. A range of frames were made from Reynolds tubing to tackle this specialist form of extreme riding.

In the late 1990s and 2000s (decade), the popularity of mountain biking saw a boom in the British bicycle industry. During this time, bicycle and component manufacturers in the UK began to close production facilities and specify and order their products from producers in the Far East. Sturmey-Archer and its subsidiary Brooks Saddles were sold and briefly fell into the hands of receivers. Sturmey-Archer was acquired by Sun-Race of Taiwan. Pashley shareholders acquired Brooks at this difficult time and working with Brooks employees, updated the branding and set a new course in the production of &quot;fine leather saddles and accessories&quot;.

==Pashley and Moulton==
In 1991, Pashley agreed to manufacture the new small-wheeled, full suspension Moulton &#x27;All Purpose Bicycle&#x27; or &#x27;APB&#x27; as it was more commonly known. This brought all the features of the &#x27;AM&#x27; series to the mass market. The &#x27;APB 12&#x27; and &#x27;APB &#x27;5&#x27; were launched in the spring of 1992. In 1995, a licensing deal with Land Rover resulted in the launch of a versatile, durable variant of the Moulton APB called the &#x27;Land Rover APB&#x27;, which sold in large numbers to both Land Rover owners and Moulton enthusiasts. See Moulton Bicycle for further information on the collaboration and business connection between Pashley and Moulton, which continued through the TSR range until 2008, when a new Moulton company was established.

==Pashley to the present day==

In recent years, Pashley has seen strong demand for its &#x27;Classic&#x27; models, in particular the women&#x27;s &#x27;Princess&#x27; traditional loop framed bicycle with front wicker basket and Brooks leather saddle. The men&#x27;s &#x27;Roadster&#x27; is also prominent in the range. The bike is notable for its large 28-inch wheels with its 635mm Westwood rims and &#x27;sit up and beg&#x27; riding position. Pashley has continued to evolve and improve these designs where appropriate. In 2007, the company launched the &#x27;Guv&#x27;nor&#x27; which was inspired by an original Pashley catalogue from the 1930s. They persuaded Reynolds to re-introduce 531 tubing. More recently Pashley has launched its &#x27;Clubman&#x27; range, and again the frames are made with 531 and inspired by archives of the company&#x27;s old brochures.

Pashley still manufacture a range of carrier cycles and tricycles that are used commercially by many companies in the UK and abroad.

In November 2023, Pashley opened a crowdfunding campaign, inviting its customers to join its forward journey for the first time in its 97-year history. The company said the funding would support existing product development in e-cargo delivery cycles, electric assist leisure cycles, and bike share products for public and private hire schemes.

<doc id="206060" wikidata="Q1668239" url="?curid=206060" title="Coat of arms of Nunavut">
<text>The coat of arms of Nunavut was granted by a warrant of Roméo LeBlanc, Governor General of Canada, dated 31 March 1999, one day before the territory of Nunavut, Canada, was created. The same document specified the flag of Nunavut.

== Overview ==
The symbol was designed in collaboration with Inuit elders, leaders, artists, groups, and the general population of the territory. Each symbol was chosen individually from the 800 submissions for the flag and coat of arms that were received. Five draft designs were created in collaboration between the heraldic artist at the Canadian Heraldic Authority and Andrew Qappik, an Inuit artist from Pangnirtung.

The shield is blue and gold, symbolizing the riches of the land. According to the blazon, the shield should be presented on a roundel shaped shield, rather than the traditional escutcheon shape in European heraldry. In chief is a representation of the midnight sun and of the North Star, or &quot;Niqirtsuituk&quot;. Below are a &quot;qulliq&quot;, a stone lamp representing the warmth of home and community, and an inukshuk (&quot;inukhuk&quot;, &quot;inuksuk&quot;), a stone monument serving as a guidepost and a symbol of the territory.

The crest, an igloo (&quot;iglu&quot;), represents traditional life, survival, and the Nunavut government assembled in the legislature. It is ensigned with a crown representing royal sovereignty.

The supporters, a caribou and narwhal, represent sustenance and natural resources of the land and sea. They stand on a compartment with Arctic poppies, dwarf fireweed, and Arctic heather, alongside an iceberg at sea.

The motto, written in Inuktitut syllabary, is &quot;Nunavut Sannginivut&quot; (ᓄᓇᕗᑦ ᓴᙱᓂᕗᑦ, or, Our Land, Our Strength).

The letters patent are quite unique, having been presented in English, French, Inuktitut, and Inuinnaqtun.

== Blazon ==
Heraldic blazon describes the coat of arms of Nunavut as:

:&quot;On a circular shield: Or Dexter a qulliq Sable inflamed Gules sinister an inuksuk Azure on a chief also Azure above five bezants in arc reversed issuant from the lower chief a mullet Niqirtsuituq Or;&quot;
:&quot;And for a Crest: On a wreath Argent and Azure an &quot;iglu&quot; affronty Argent windowed Or and ensigned by the Royal Crown proper;&quot;
:&quot;and for a Motto: &quot;ᓄᓇᕗᑦ ᓴᙱᓂᕗᑦ&quot;, meaning &quot;Nunavut Our Strength&quot;;&quot;
:&quot;and for Supporters: On a compartment dexter of Land set with Arctic poppies, dwarf fireweed and Arctic heather proper sinister ice floes Argent set on barry wavy Azure and Argent dexter a caribou sinister a narwhal both proper.&quot;

<doc id="206064" wikidata="Q254329" url="?curid=206064" title="Van der Waals equation">
<text>The van der Waals equation is a mathematical formula that describes the behavior of real gases. It is an equation of state that relates the pressure, temperature, and molar volume in a fluid. The equation modifies the ideal gas law in two ways: first, it considers particles to have a finite diameter (whereas an ideal gas consists of point particles); second, its particles interact with each other (unlike an ideal gas, whose particles move as though alone in the volume).

The equation is named after Dutch physicist Johannes Diderik van der Waals, who first derived it in 1873 as part of his doctoral thesis. Van der Waals based the equation on the idea that fluids are composed of discrete particles, which few scientists believed existed. However, the equation accurately predicted the behavior of a fluid around its critical point, which had been discovered a few years earlier. Its qualitative and quantitative agreement with experiments ultimately cemented its acceptance in the scientific community. These accomplishments won van der Waals the 1910 Nobel Prize in Physics. Today the equation is recognized as an important model of phase change processes. Van der Waals also adapted his equation so that it applied to a binary mixture of fluids. He, and others, then used the modified equation to discover a host of important facts about the phase equilibria of such fluids. This application, expanded to treat multi-component mixtures, has extended the predictive ability of the equation to fluids of industrial and commercial importance. In this arena it has spawned many similar equations in a continuing attempt by engineers to improve their ability to understand and manage these fluids; it remains relevant to the present.

== Behavior of the equation ==

One way to write the van der Waals equation is:
formula_1
where formula_2 is pressure, formula_3 is the universal gas constant, formula_4 is temperature, formula_5 is molar volume, and formula_6 and formula_7 are experimentally determinable, substance-specific constants. Molar volume is given by , where formula_8 is the Avogadro constant, formula_9 is the volume, and formula_10 is the number of molecules (the ratio formula_11 is the amount of substance, a physical quantity with the base unit mole).

When van der Waals created his equation, few scientists believed that fluids were composed of rapidly moving particles. Moreover, those who thought so had no knowledge of the atomic/molecular structure. The simplest conception of a particle, and the easiest to model mathematically, was a hard sphere; this is what van der Waals used. In that case, two particles of diameter formula_12 would come into contact when their centers were a distance formula_12 apart; hence the center of the one was excluded from a spherical volume equal to formula_14 about the other. That is 8 times , the volume of each particle of radius , but there are 2 particles which gives 4 times the volume per particle. The total excluded volume is then ; that is, 4 times the volume of all the particles. Van der Waals and his contemporaries used an alternative, but equivalent, analysis based on the mean free path between molecular collisions that gave this result. From the fact that the volume fraction of particles, formula_15 must be positive, van der Waals noted that as formula_10 becomes larger the factor 4 must decrease (for spheres there is a known minimum ), but he was never able to determine the nature of the decrease. 

The constant , and has dimension of molar volume, [v]. The constant formula_6 expresses the strength of the hypothesized interparticle attraction. Van der Waals only had as a model Newton&#x27;s law of gravitation, in which two particles are attracted in proportion to the product of their masses. Thus he argued that in his case the attractive pressure was proportional to the square of the density. The proportionality constant, , when written in the form used above, has the dimension [pv2] (pressure times molar volume squared), which is also molar energy times molar volume. 

The intermolecular force was later conveniently described by the negative derivative of a pair potential function. For spherically symmetric particles, this is most simply a function of separation distance with a single characteristic length, , and a minimum energy, formula_18 (with ). Two of the many such functions that have been suggested are shown in the accompanying plot. 

A modern theory based on statistical mechanics produces the same result for formula_19 obtained by van der Waals and his contemporaries. This result is valid for any pair potential for which the increase in formula_20 is sufficiently rapid. This includes the hard sphere model for which the increase is infinitely rapid and the result is exact. Indeed, the Sutherland potential most accurately models van der Waals&#x27; conception of a molecule. It also includes potentials that do not represent hard sphere force interactions provided that the increase in formula_21 for formula_22 is fast enough, but then it is approximate; increasingly better the faster the increase. In that case formula_12 is only an &quot;effective diameter&quot; of the molecule. This theory also produces formula_24 where formula_25 is a number that depends on the shape of the potential function, . However, this result is only valid when the potential is weak, namely, when the minimum potential energy is very much smaller than the thermal energy, formula_26.

Ludwig Boltzmann wrote equations using formula_27 (specific volume) rather than formula_28 (molar volume, used here); Josiah Willard Gibbs did as well, as do most engineers. Physicists use the property formula_29 (the reciprocal of number density), but there is no essential difference between equations written with any of these properties. Equations of state written using molar volume contain formula_3, those using specific volume contain formula_31 (the substance specific formula_32 is the molar mass with formula_33 the mass of a single particle), and those written with number density contain .

Once the constants formula_6 and formula_7 are experimentally determined for a given substance, the van der Waals equation can be used to predict attributes like the boiling point at any given pressure, and the critical point (defined by pressure formula_36 and temperature formula_37 such that the substance cannot be liquefied either when formula_38 no matter how low the temperature, or when formula_39 no matter how high the pressure; formula_40 uniquely define ). These predictions are accurate for only a few substances. For most simple fluids they are only a valuable approximation. The equation also explains why superheated liquids can exist above their boiling point and subcooled vapors can exist below their condensation point.

=== Example ===

The graph on the right plots the intersection of the surface shown in Figures A and C and four planes of constant pressure. Each intersection produces a curve in the formula_41 plane corresponding to the value of the pressure chosen. These curves are isobars, since they represent all the points with the same pressure. 

On the red isobar, , the slope is positive over the entire range, formula_42 (although the plot only shows a finite region). This describes a fluid as homogeneous for all formula_4—that is, it does not undergo a phase transition at any temperature—which is a characteristic of all supercritical isobars .

The orange isobar, , is the critical one that marks the boundary between homogeneity and heterogeneity. The critical point lies on this isobar. 

The green isobar, formula_44, has a region of negative slope. This region consists of states that are unstable and therefore never observed (for this reason this region is shown dotted gray). The green curve thus consists of two disconnected branches, indicated two phase states: a vapor on the right, and a denser liquid on the left. For this pressure, at a temperature formula_45 (specified by mechanical, thermal, and material equilibrium), the boiling (saturated) liquid formula_46 and condensing (saturated) vapor formula_47 coexist, shown on the curve as the left and right green circles, respectively. The locus of these coexistent saturation points across all subcritical isobars forms the &quot;saturation curve&quot; on the formula_48 surface. In this situation, the denser liquid will separate and collect below the vapor due to gravity, and a meniscus will form between them. This heterogeneous combination of coexisting liquid and vapor is the phase transition. Heating the liquid in this state increases the fraction of vapor in the mixture—its , an average of formula_46 and formula_47 weighted by this fraction, increases while formula_45 remains the same. This is shown as the horizontal dotted gray line, which represents not a solution of the equation but the observed behavior. The points above , superheated liquid, and those below it, subcooled vapor, are metastable; a sufficiently strong disturbance causes them to transform to the stable alternative. These metastable regions are shown with green dashed lines. In summary, this isobar describes a fluid as a stable vapor for , a stable liquid for , and a mixture of liquid and vapor at , that also supports metastable states of subcooled vapor and superheated liquid. This behavior is characteristic of all subcritical isobars , where formula_45 is a function of . 

The black isobar, , is the limit of positive pressures. None of its points represent stable solutions: they are either metastable (positive or zero slope) or unstable (negative slope). Interestingly, states of negative pressure (tension) exist. Their isobars lie below the black isobar, and form those parts of the surfaces seen in Figures A and C that lie below the zero-pressure plane. In this formula_53 plane they have a parabola-like shape, and, like the zero-pressure isobar, their states are all either metastable (positive or zero slope) or unstable (negative slope).

=== Surface plots ===

Figure B shows the surface calculated from the ideal gas equation of state. This surface is universal, meaning it represents all ideal gases. Here, the surface is normalized so that the coordinate formula_54 is at formula_55 in the 3-dimensional plot space (the black dot). This normalization makes it easier to compare this surface with the surface generated by the van der Waals equation in Figure C.

Figures A and C show the surface calculated from the van der Waals equation. Note that whereas the ideal gas surface is relatively uniform, the van der Waals surface has a distinctive &quot;fold&quot;. This fold develops from a critical point defined by specific values of pressure, temperature, and molar volume. Because the surface is plotted using dimensionless variables (formed by the ratio of each property to its respective critical value), the critical point is located at the coordinates . When drawn using these dimensionless axes, this surface is, like that of the ideal gas, also universal. Moreover, it represents all real substances to a remarkably high degree of accuracy. This principle of corresponding states, developed by van der Waals from his equation, has become one of the fundamental ideas in the thermodynamics of fluids.

The fold&#x27;s boundary on the surface is marked, on each side of the critical point, by the &quot;spinodal curve&quot; (identified in Fig. A, and seen in Figs. A and C). This curve delimits an unstable region wherein no observable homogeneous states exist; elsewhere on the surface, states of liquid, vapor, and gas exist. The fold in the surface is what enables the equation to predict the phenomenon of liquid–vapor phase change. This phenomenon is described by the &quot;saturation curve&quot; (or &quot;coexistence curve&quot;): the locus of saturated liquid and vapor states which, being in equilibrium with each other, can coexist. The saturation curve is &quot;not&quot; specified by the properties of the surface alone—it is substance-dependent. The saturated liquid curve and saturated vapor curve (both identified in Fig. A) together comprise the saturation curve. The inset in Figure A shows the &quot;mixture states&quot;, which are a combination of the saturated liquid and vapor states that correspond to each end of the horizontal mixture line (that is, the points of intersection between the mixture line and its isotherm). However, these mixture states are not part of the surface generated by the van der Waals equation; they are not solutions of the equation.

== Relationship to the ideal gas law ==

The ideal gas law follows from the van der Waals equation whenever the molar volume formula_5 is sufficiently large (when , so ), or correspondingly whenever the molar density, , is sufficiently small (when , so ).

When formula_5 is large enough that both inequalities are satisfied, these two approximations reduce the van der Waals equation to ; rearranging in terms of formula_9 and formula_10 gives , which is the ideal gas law. This is not surprising since the van der Waals equation was constructed from the ideal gas equation in order to obtain an equation valid beyond the limit of ideal gas behavior. 

What is truly remarkable is the extent to which van der Waals succeeded. Indeed, Epstein in his classic thermodynamics textbook began his discussion of the van der Waals equation by writing, &quot;In spite of its simplicity, it comprehends both the gaseous and the liquid state and brings out, in a most remarkable way, all the phenomena pertaining to the continuity of these two states&quot;. Also, in Volume 5 of his &quot;Lectures on Theoretical Physics&quot;, Sommerfeld, in addition to noting that &quot;Boltzmann described van der Waals as the Newton of real gases&quot;, also wrote &quot;It is very remarkable that the theory due to van der Waals is in a position to predict, at least qualitatively, the unstable [referring to superheated liquid, and subcooled vapor, now called &quot;metastable&quot;] states&quot; that are associated with the phase change process.

== Utility of the equation ==

The van der Waals equation has been, and remains, useful because:
* It yields simple analytic expressions for thermodynamic properties: internal energy, entropy, enthalpy, Helmholtz free energy, Gibbs free energy, and specific heat at constant pressure .
* It yields an analytic expression of its coefficient of thermal expansion and its isothermal compressibility.
* It yields an analytic analysis of the Joule–Thomson coefficient and associated inversion curve, which were instrumental in the development of the commercial liquefaction of gases.
* It shows that the specific heat at constant volume formula_60 is a function of formula_4 only.
* It explains the existence of the critical point and the liquid–vapor phase transition, including the observed metastable states.
* It establishes the theorem of corresponding states.
* It is an intermediate mathematical model, useful as a pedagogical tool when teaching physics, chemistry, and engineering.

In addition, its saturation curve has an analytic solution, which can depict the liquid metals (mercury and cesium) quantitatively, and describes most real fluids qualitatively. As such, this solution can be regarded as one member of a family of equations of state (known as &quot;extended corresponding states&quot;). Consequently, the equation plays an important role in the modern theory of phase transitions.

== History ==

In 1857 Rudolf Clausius published &quot;The Nature of the Motion which We Call Heat&quot;. In it he derived the relation formula_62 for the pressure formula_2 in a gas, composed of particles in motion, with number density , mass , and mean square speed . He then noted that using the classical laws of Boyle and Charles, one could write formula_64 with a constant of proportionality . Hence temperature was proportional to the average kinetic energy of the particles. This article inspired further work based on the twin ideas that substances are composed of indivisible particles, and that heat is a consequence of the particle motion; movement that evolves in accordance with Newton&#x27;s laws. The work, known as the kinetic theory of gases, was done principally by Clausius, James Clerk Maxwell, and Ludwig Boltzmann. At about the same time, Josiah Willard Gibbs advanced the work by converting it into statistical mechanics.

This environment influenced Johannes Diderik van der Waals. After initially pursuing a teaching credential, he was accepted for doctoral studies at the University of Leiden under Pieter Rijke. This led, in 1873, to a dissertation that provided a simple, particle-based equation that described the gas–liquid change of state, the origin of a critical temperature, and the concept of corresponding states. The equation is based on two premises: first, that fluids are composed of particles with non-zero volumes, and second, that at a large enough distance each particle exerts an attractive force on all other particles in its vicinity. Boltzmann called these forces van der Waals cohesive forces.

In 1869 Irish professor of chemistry Thomas Andrews at Queen&#x27;s University Belfast, in a paper entitled &quot;On the Continuity of the Gaseous and Liquid States of Matter&quot;, displayed an experimentally obtained set of isotherms of carbonic acid, , that showed at low temperatures a jump in density at a certain pressure, while at higher temperatures there was no abrupt change (the figure can be seen here). Andrews called the isotherm at which the jump just disappears the &quot;critical point&quot;. Given the similarity of the titles of this paper and van der Waals&#x27; subsequent thesis, one might think that van der Waals set out to develop a theoretical explanation of Andrews&#x27; experiments; however, this is not what happened. Van der Waals began work by trying to determine a molecular attraction that appeared in Laplace&#x27;s theory of capillarity, and only after establishing his equation he tested it using Andrews&#x27; results.

By 1877 sprays of both liquid oxygen and liquid nitrogen had been produced, and a new field of research, low temperature physics, had been opened. The van der Waals equation played a part in all this, especially with respect to the liquefaction of hydrogen and helium which was finally achieved in 1908. From measurements of formula_65 and formula_66 in two states with the same density, the van der Waals equation produces the values 
formula_67 

Thus from two such measurements of pressure and temperature one could determine formula_6 and , and from these values calculate the expected critical pressure, temperature, and molar volume. Goodstein summarized this contribution of the van der Waals equation as follows:All this labor required considerable faith in the belief that gas–liquid systems were all basically the same, even if no one had ever seen the liquid phase. This faith arose out of the repeated success of the van der Waals theory, which is essentially a universal equation of state, independent of the details of any particular substance once it has been properly scaled. [...] As a result, not only was it possible to believe that hydrogen could be liquefied, but it was even possible to predict the necessary temperature and pressure.Van der Waals was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1910, in recognition of the contribution of his formulation of this &quot;equation of state for gases and liquids&quot;.

As noted previously, modern-day studies of first-order phase changes make use of the van der Waals equation together with the Gibbs criterion, equal chemical potential of each phase, as a model of the phenomenon. This model has an analytic coexistence (saturation) curve expressed parametrically, formula_69 (the parameter formula_70 is related to the entropy difference between the two phases), that was first obtained by Plank, was known to Gibbs and others, and was later derived by Lekner. A summary of Lekner&#x27;s solution is presented in a subsequent section, and a more complete discussion in the Maxwell construction.

== Critical point and corresponding states ==
Figure 1 shows four isotherms of the van der Waals equation (abbreviated as vdW) on a formula_71 (pressure, molar volume) plane. The essential character of these curves is that they come in three forms: 

# At some critical temperature formula_37 (orange isotherm), the slope is negative everywhere except at a single inflection point: the critical point , where both the slope and curvature are zero, .
# At higher temperatures (red isotherm), the isotherm&#x27;s slope is negative everywhere. (This corresponds to values of formula_73 for which the vdW equation has one real root for ).
# At lower temperatures (green and blue isotherms), all isotherms have two points where the slope is zero. (This corresponds to values of , formula_4 for which the vdW equation has three real roots for ).

The critical point can be analytically determined by evaluating the two partial derivatives of the vdW equation in (1) and equating them to zero. This produces the critical values formula_75 and ; plugging these back into the vdW equation gives .

Above the critical temperature formula_37, van der Waals isotherms satisfy the stability criterion that formula_77. Below the critical temperature, each isotherm contains an interval where this condition is violated. This unstable region is the genesis of the phase change; there is a range formula_78, for which no observable states exist. The states for formula_79 are liquid, and those for formula_80 are vapor; the denser liquid separates and lies below the vapor due to gravity. The transition points, states with zero slope, are called &quot;spinodal points&quot;. Their locus is the &quot;spinodal curve&quot;, a boundary that separates the regions of the plane for which liquid, vapor, and gas exist from a region where no observable homogeneous states exist. This spinodal curve is obtained here from the vdW equation by differentiation (or equivalently from formula_81) as
formula_82

A projection of the spinodal curve is plotted in Figure 1 as the black dash-dot curve. It passes through the critical point, which is also a spinodal point.

Using these critical values to define reduced (dimensionless) variables , , and formula_83 renders the vdW equation in the dimensionless form (used to construct Fig. 1):
formula_84

This dimensionless form is a similarity relation; it indicates that all vdW fluids at the same formula_85 will plot on the same curve. It expresses the &quot;law of corresponding states&quot; which Boltzmann described as follows:
All the constants characterizing the gas have dropped out of this equation. If one bases measurements on the van der Waals units [Boltzmann&#x27;s name for the reduced quantities here], then he obtains the same equation of state for all gases. [...] Only the values of the critical volume, pressure, and temperature depend on the nature of the particular substance; the numbers that express the actual volume, pressure, and temperature as multiples of the critical values satisfy the same equation for all substances. In other words, the same equation relates the reduced volume, reduced pressure, and reduced temperature for all substances.

Obviously such a broad general relation is unlikely to be correct; nevertheless, the fact that one can obtain from it an essentially correct description of actual phenomena is very remarkable.
This &quot;law&quot; is just a special case of dimensional analysis in which an equation containing 6 dimensional quantities, , and 3 independent dimensions, [p], [v], [T] (independent means that &quot;none of the dimensions of these quantities can be represented as a product of powers of the dimensions of the remaining quantities&quot;, and ), must be expressible in terms of 6 − 3 = 3 dimensionless groups. Here formula_86 is a characteristic molar volume, formula_87 a characteristic pressure, and formula_88 a characteristic temperature, and the 3 dimensionless groups are . According to dimensional analysis the equation must then have the form , a general similarity relation. In his discussion of the vdW equation, Sommerfeld also mentioned this point. The reduced properties defined previously are , , and . Recent research has suggested that there is a family of equations of state that depend on an additional dimensionless group, and this provides a more exact correlation of properties. Nevertheless, as Boltzmann observed, the van der Waals equation provides an essentially correct description.

The vdW equation produces the critical compressibility factor , while for most real fluids . Thus most real fluids do not satisfy this condition, and consequently their behavior is only described qualitatively by the vdW equation. However, the vdW equation of state is a member of a family of state equations based on the Pitzer (acentric) factor, , and the liquid metals (mercury and cesium) are well approximated by it.

== Thermodynamic properties ==

The properties of molar internal energy formula_89 and entropy formula_90—defined by the first and second laws of thermodynamics, hence all thermodynamic properties of a simple compressible substance—can be specified, up to a constant of integration, by two measurable functions: a mechanical equation of state , and a constant volume specific heat .

=== Internal energy and specific heat at constant volume ===

The internal energy is given by the energetic equation of state,
formula_91
where formula_92 is an arbitrary constant of integration.

Now in order for formula_93 to be an exact differential—namely that formula_94 be continuous with continuous partial derivatives—its second mixed partial derivatives must also be equal, formula_95. Then with formula_96 this condition can be written as formula_97. Differentiating formula_98 for the vdW equation gives formula_99, so formula_100. Consequently formula_101 for a vdW fluid exactly as it is for an ideal gas. For simplicity, it is regarded as a constant here, formula_102 for some constant number formula_103. Then both integrals can be evaluated, resulting in

This is the energetic equation of state for a perfect vdW fluid.

=== Enthalpy ===

The enthalpy of a system is given by formula_104. Substituting with and formula_105 (the vdW equation multiplied by formula_5) gives 
formula_107 

This is the enthalpic equation of state for a perfect vdW fluid.

=== Entropy and free energies ===

The entropy formula_90 is given by the entropic equation of state:
formula_109

Using formula_102 as before, and integrating the second term using formula_111 we obtain
formula_112

This is the entropic equation of state for a perfect vdW fluid.

The Helmholtz free energy is formula_113, so combining the previous results gives
formula_114

This is the Helmholtz free energy for a perfect vdW fluid.

Likewise, the Gibbs free energy is formula_115, which evaluates to

This is the Gibbs free energy for a perfect vdW fluid.

=== Isothermal compressibility, thermal expansion and specific heat ===

The two first partial derivatives of the vdW equation are
formula_116
where formula_117 is the isothermal compressibility (a measure of the relative increase of volume from an increase of pressure, at constant temperature), and formula_118 is the coefficient of thermal expansion (a measure of the relative increase of volume from an increase of temperature, at constant pressure). Therefore,

In the limit formula_119, the vdW equation becomes formula_120, and formula_121, and formula_122. Both these limits of formula_123 and formula_124 are the ideal gas values, which is consistent because, as noted earlier, a vdW fluid behaves like an ideal gas in this limit.

The specific heat at constant pressure formula_125 is defined as the partial derivative formula_126. However, it is not independent of formula_60, as they are related by the Mayer equation, formula_128. Then the two partials of the vdW equation can be used to express formula_125 as
formula_130

Here in the limit formula_119, formula_132, which is also the ideal gas result as expected; however the limit formula_133 gives the same result, which does not agree with experiments on liquids.

In this liquid limit we also find formula_134, namely that the vdW liquid is incompressible. Moreover, since formula_135, it is also mechanically incompressible, that is, formula_124 approaches 0 faster than formula_123 does.

Finally, formula_125, formula_123, and formula_124 are all infinite on the curve formula_141. This curve, called the spinodal curve, is defined by formula_142.

== Saturation ==

Although the gap in formula_5 delimited by the two spinodal points on an isotherm (e.g. formula_144 in Fig. 1) is the origin of the phase change, the change occurs as some intermediate value. This can be seen by considering that both saturated liquid and saturated vapor can coexist in equilibrium, at which they have the same pressure and temperature. However, the minimum and maximum spinodal points are not at the same pressure. Therefore, at a temperature formula_45, the phase change is characterized by the pressure formula_146, which lies within the range of formula_2 set by the spinodal points (formula_148), and by the molar volume of liquid formula_149 and vapor formula_150, which lie outside the range of formula_5 set by the spinodal points (formula_152 and formula_153).

Applying the vdW equation to the saturated liquid (fluid) and saturated vapor (gas) states gives:

{v_\text{f}-b}-\frac{a}^2}\quad\text{and}\quad p_\text{s}=\frac{RT_\text{s}}{v_\text{g}-b}-\frac{a}^2}.
&lt;/math&gt;|}}

These two equations contain four variables (formula_154), so a third equation is required in order to uniquely specify three of these variables in terms of the fourth. The following is a derivation of this third equation (the result is ).

Now, the energy required to vaporize a mole at constant pressure is formula_155 (from the first law of thermodynamics) and at constant temperature is formula_156 (from the second law). Thus,
formula_157

That is, in this case, the Gibbs free energy in the saturated liquid state equals that in the saturated vapor state. The Gibbs free energy is one of the four thermodynamic potentials whose partial derivatives produce all other thermodynamics state properties; its differential is formula_158. Integrating this over an isotherm from formula_159 to formula_160, noting that the pressure is the same at each endpoint, and setting the result to zero yields
formula_161

Here because formula_5 is a multivalued function, the formula_2 integral must be divided into 3 parts corresponding to the 3 real roots of the vdW equation in the form, formula_164 (this can be visualized most easily by imagining Fig. 1 rotated formula_165); the result is a special case of material equilibrium. The last equality, which follows from integrating formula_166, is the Maxwell equal area rule, which requires that the upper area between the vdW curve and the horizontal through formula_146 be equal to the lower area. This form means that the thermodynamic restriction that fixes formula_146 is specified by the equation of state itself, formula_169. Using the equation for the Gibbs free energy for the vdW equation (), the difference formula_170 can be evaluated as

{v_\text{g}-b}-\frac{v_\text{f}}{v_\text{f}-b}-\ln\left(\frac{v_\text{g}-b}{v_\text{f}-b}\right)\right] -2a\left(\frac{1}{v_\text{g}}-\frac{1}{v_\text{f}}\right)=0&lt;/math&gt;|}}

This is a third equation that along with the two vdW equations of can be solved numerically. This has been done given a value for either formula_45 or formula_146, and tabular results presented; however, the equations also admit an analytic parametric solution obtained by Lekner. Details of this solution may be found in the Maxwell construction; the results are:
formula_173
formula_174
where
formula_175
and the parameter formula_176 is given physically by formula_177. The values of all other property discontinuities across the saturation curve also follow from this solution. These functions define the &quot;coexistence curve&quot; (or &quot;saturation curve&quot;), which is the locus of the saturated liquid and saturated vapor states of the vdW fluid. Various projections of this saturation curve are plotted in Figures 1, 2a, and 2b.

Referring back to Figure 1, the isotherms for formula_178 are discontinuous. For example, the formula_144 (green) isotherm consists of two separate segments. The solid green lines represent stable states, and terminate at dots that represent the saturated liquid and vapor states that comprise the phase change. The dashed green lines represent metastable states (superheated liquid and subcooled vapor) that are created in the process of phase transition, have a short lifetime, and then devolve into their lower energy stable alternative.

At every point in the region between the two curves in Figure 2b, there are two states: one stable and one metastable. The coexistence of these states can be seen in Figure 1—for discontinuous isotherms, there are values of formula_180 which correspond to two points on the isotherm: one on a solid line (the stable state) and one on a dashed region (the metastable state).

In his treatise of 1898, in which he described the van der Waals equation in great detail, Boltzmann discussed these metastable states in a section titled &quot;Undercooling, Delayed evaporation&quot;. (Today, these states are now denoted &quot;subcooled vapor&quot; and &quot;superheated liquid&quot;.) Moreover, it has now become clear that these metastable states occur regularly in the phase transition process. In particular, processes that involve very high heat fluxes create large numbers of these states, and transition to their stable alternative with a corresponding release of energy that can be dangerous. Consequently, there is a pressing need to study their thermal properties.

In the same section, Boltzmann also addressed and explained the negative pressures which some liquid metastable states exhibit (for example, the blue isotherm formula_181 in Fig. 1). He concluded that such liquid states of tensile stresses were real, as did Tien and Lienhard many years later who wrote &quot;The van der Waals equation predicts that at low temperatures liquids sustain enormous tension [...] In recent years measurements have been made that reveal this to be entirely correct.&quot;

Even though the phase change produces a mathematical discontinuity in the homogeneous fluid properties (for example formula_5), there is no physical discontinuity. As the liquid begins to vaporize, the fluid becomes a heterogeneous mixture of liquid and vapor whose molar volume varies continuously from formula_149 to formula_150 according to the equation of state formula_185 where formula_186 and formula_187 is the mole fraction of the vapor. This equation is called the lever rule and applies to other properties as well. The states it represents form a horizontal line bridging the discontinuous region of an isotherm (not shown in Fig. 1 because it is a different equation from the vdW equation).

=== Extended corresponding states ===
The idea of corresponding states originated when van der Waals cast his equation in the dimensionless form, formula_188. However, as Boltzmann noted, such a simple representation could not correctly describe all substances. Indeed, the saturation analysis of this form produces formula_189; namely, that all substances have the same dimensionless coexistence curve, which is not true. To avoid this paradox, an extended principle of corresponding states has been suggested in which formula_190 where formula_191 is a substance-dependent dimensionless parameter related to the only physical feature associated with an individual substance: its critical point.
One candidate for formula_191 is the critical compressibility factor formula_193; however, because formula_194 is difficult to measure accurately, the acentric factor developed by Kenneth Pitzer, formula_195, is more useful. The saturation pressure in this situation is represented by a one-parameter family of curves: formula_196. Several investigators have produced correlations of saturation data for a number of substances; Dong and Lienhard give
formula_197
which has an RMS error of formula_198 over the range formula_199.

Figure 3 is a plot of formula_200 vs. formula_201 for various values of the Pitzer factor formula_202 as given by this equation. The vertical axis is logarithmic in order to show the behavior at pressures closer to zero, where differences among the various substances (indicated by varying values of formula_202) are more pronounced.

Figure 4 is another plot of the same equation showing formula_201 as a function of formula_202 for various values of formula_200. It includes data from 51 substances, including the vdW fluid, over the range formula_207. This plot shows that the vdW fluid (formula_208) is a member of the class of real fluids; indeed, the vdW fluid can quantitatively approximate the behavior of the liquid metals cesium (formula_209) and mercury (formula_210), which share similar values of formula_202. However, in general it can describe the behavior of fluids of various formula_202 only qualitatively.

== Joule–Thomson coefficient ==

The Joule–Thomson coefficient, formula_213, is of practical importance because the two end states of a throttling process (formula_214) lie on a constant enthalpy curve. Although ideal gases, for which formula_215, do not change temperature in such a process, real gases do, and it is important in applications to know whether they heat up or cool down.

This coefficient can be found in terms of the previously derived formula_123 and formula_125 as
formula_218

When formula_219 is positive, the gas temperature decreases as it passes through a throttling process, and when it is negative, the temperature increases. Therefore, the condition formula_220 defines a curve that separates the region of the formula_221 plane where formula_222 from the region where formula_223. This curve is called the &quot;inversion curve&quot;, and its equation is formula_224. Evaluating this using the expression for formula_123 derived in produces
formula_226

Note that for formula_227 there will be cooling for formula_228 (or, in terms of the critical temperature, formula_229). As Sommerfeld noted, &quot;This is the case with air and with most other gases. &quot;Air can be cooled at will by repeated expansion and can finally be liquified.&quot;&quot;
In terms of formula_230, the equation has a simple positive solution formula_231, which for formula_232 produces formula_233. Using this to eliminate formula_5 from the vdW equation then gives the inversion curve as 
formula_235 
where, for simplicity, formula_236 have been replaced by formula_237.

The maximum of this quadratic curve occurs with formula_238, for
formula_239
which gives formula_240, or formula_241, and the corresponding formula_242. By the quadratic formula, the zeros of the curve formula_243 are formula_244 and formula_245 (formula_246 and formula_247). In terms of the dimensionless variables formula_248, the zeros are at formula_249 and formula_250, while the maximum is formula_251, and occurs at formula_252. A plot of the curve is shown in green in Figure 5. Sommerfeld also displays this plot, together with a curve drawn using experimental data from H2. The two curves agree qualitatively, but not quantitatively. For example the maximum on these two curves differ by about 40% in both magnitude and location.

Figure 5 shows an overlap between the saturation curve and the inversion curve plotted in the same region. This crossover means a van der Waals gas can be liquified by passing it through a throttling process under the proper conditions; real gases are liquified in this way.

== Compressibility factor ==
Real gases are characterized by their difference from ideal gases by writing formula_253. Here formula_254, called the compressibility factor, is expressed either as formula_255 or formula_256. In either case, the limit as formula_2 or formula_258 approaches zero is 1, and formula_254 takes the ideal gas value. In the second case formula_260, so for a van der Waals fluid the compressibility factor is 

or in terms of reduced variables 
formula_261
where formula_262. At the critical point, formula_263 and formula_264.

In the limit formula_265, formula_266; the fluid behaves like an ideal gas, as mentioned before. The derivative formula_267 is never negative when formula_268; that is, when formula_269 (which corresponds to formula_270). Alternatively, the initial slope is negative when formula_271, is zero at formula_272, and is positive for larger formula_273 (see Fig. 6). In this case, the value of formula_254 passes through formula_245 when formula_276. Here formula_277 is called the Boyle temperature. It ranges between formula_278, and denotes a point in formula_279 space where the equation of state reduces to the ideal gas law. However, the fluid does not behave like an ideal gas there, because neither its derivatives formula_280 nor formula_281 reduce to their ideal gas values, other than where formula_282 the actual ideal gas region.

Figure 6 plots various isotherms of formula_283 vs formula_284. Also shown are the spinodal and coexistence curves described previously. The subcritical isotherm consists of stable, metastable, and unstable segments (identified in the same way as in Fig. 1). Also included are the zero initial slope isotherm and the one corresponding to infinite temperature. 

Figure 7 shows a generalized compressibility chart for a vdW gas. Like all other vdW properties, this is not quantitatively correct for most gases, but it has the correct qualitative features. Note the caustic generated by the crossing isotherms.

=== Virial expansion ===
Statistical mechanics suggests that the compressibility factor formula_254 can be expressed by a power series, called a virial expansion:
formula_286
where the functions formula_287 are the virial coefficients; the formula_288th term represents a formula_288-particle interaction.

Expanding the term formula_290 in the definition of formula_254 () into an infinite series, convergent for formula_292, produces 
formula_293 

The corresponding expression for formula_294 when formula_295 is
formula_296

These are the virial expansions, one dimensional and one dimensionless, for the van der Waals fluid. The second virial coefficient is the slope of formula_297 at formula_298. Notice that it can be positive when formula_299 or negative when formula_300, which agrees with the result found previously by differentiation.

For molecules modeled as non-attracting hard spheres, formula_301, and the vdW virial expansion becomes 
formula_302 
which illustrates the effect of the excluded volume alone. It was recognized early on that this was in error beginning with the term formula_303. Boltzmann calculated its correct value as formula_304, and used the result to propose an enhanced version of the vdW equation:
formula_305

On expanding formula_306, this produced the correct coefficients through formula_307 and also gave infinite pressure at formula_308, which is approximately the close-packing distance for hard spheres. This was one of the first of many equations of state proposed over the years that attempted to make quantitative improvements to the remarkably accurate explanations of real gas behavior produced by the vdW equation.

== Mixtures ==

In 1890 van der Waals published an article that initiated the study of fluid mixtures. It was subsequently included as Part III of a later published version of his thesis. His essential idea was that in a binary mixture of vdW fluids described by the equations
formula_309
the mixture is also a vdW fluid given by
formula_310
where
formula_311

Here formula_312 and formula_313, with formula_314 (so that formula_315), are the mole fractions of the two fluid substances. Adding the equations for the two fluids shows that formula_316, although for formula_5 sufficiently large formula_318 with equality holding in the ideal gas limit. The quadratic forms for formula_319 and formula_320 are a consequence of the forces between molecules. This was first shown by Lorentz, and was credited to him by van der Waals. The quantities formula_321 and formula_322 in these expressions characterize collisions between two molecules of the same fluid component, while formula_323 and formula_324 represent collisions between one molecule of each of the two different fluid components. This idea of van der Waals&#x27; was later called a &quot;one fluid model of mixture behavior&quot;.

Assuming that formula_325 is the arithmetic mean of formula_326 and formula_327, formula_328, substituting into the quadratic form and noting that formula_315 produces
formula_330

Van der Waals wrote this relation, but did not make use of it initially. However, it has been used frequently in subsequent studies, and its use is said to produce good agreement with experimental results at high pressure.

=== Common tangent construction ===

In this article, van der Waals used the Helmholtz potential minimum principle to establish the conditions of stability. This principle states that in a system in diathermal contact with a heat reservoir formula_331, formula_332, and formula_333, namely at equilibrium, the Helmholtz potential is a minimum. Since, like formula_334, the molar Helmholtz function formula_335 is also a potential function whose differential is
formula_336 
this minimum principle leads to the stability condition formula_337. This condition means that the function, formula_338, is convex at all stable states of the system. Moreover, for those states the previous stability condition for the pressure is necessarily satisfied as well. 

==== Single fluid ====
For a single substance, the definition of the molar Gibbs free energy can be written in the form formula_339. Thus when formula_2 and formula_341 are constant along with temperature, the function formula_342 represents a straight line with slope formula_343, and intercept formula_341. Since the curve formula_342 has positive curvature everywhere when formula_346, the curve and the straight line will have a single tangent. However, for a subcritical formula_347 is not everywhere convex. With formula_348 and a suitable value of formula_341, the line will be tangent to formula_350 at the molar volume of each coexisting phase: saturated liquid formula_351 and saturated vapor formula_352; there will be a double tangent. Furthermore, each of these points is characterized by the same values of formula_341, formula_2, and formula_355 These are the same three specifications for coexistence that were used previously. 
Figure 8 depicts an evaluation of formula_350 as a green curve, with formula_46 and formula_47 marked by the left and right green circles, respectively. The region on the green curve for formula_359 corresponds to the liquid state. As formula_5 increases past formula_46, the curvature of formula_338 (proportional to formula_363) continually decreases. The inflection point, characterized by zero curvature, is a spinodal point; between formula_46 and this point is the metastable superheated liquid. For further increases in formula_5 the curvature decreases to a minimum then increases to another (zero curvature) spinodal point; between these two spinodal points is the unstable region in which the fluid cannot exist in a homogeneous equilibrium state (represented by the dotted grey curve). With a further increase in formula_5 the curvature increases to a maximum at formula_47, where the slope is formula_146; the region between this point and the second spinodal point is the metastable subcooled vapor. Finally, the region formula_369 is the vapor. In this region the curvature continually decreases until it is zero at infinitely large formula_5. The double tangent line (solid black) that runs between formula_46 and formula_47 represents states that are stable but heterogeneous, not homogeneous solutions of the vdW equation. The states above this line (with larger Helmholtz free energy) are either metastable or unstable. The combined solid green-black curve in Figure 8 is the convex envelope of formula_350, which is defined as the largest convex curve that is less than or equal to the function.

For a vdW fluid, the molar Helmholtz potential is
formula_374
where formula_375. Its derivative is
formula_376 
which is the vdW equation, as expected. A plot of this function formula_377, whose slope at each point is specified by the vdW equation, for the subcritical isotherm formula_144 is shown in Figure 8 along with the line tangent to it at its two coexisting saturation points. The data illustrated in Figure 8 is exactly the same as that shown in Figure 1 for this isotherm. This double tangent construction thus provides a graphical alternative to the Maxwell construction to establish the saturated liquid and vapor points on an isotherm.

==== Binary fluid ====
Van der Waals used the Helmholtz function because its properties could be easily extended to the binary fluid situation. In a binary mixture of vdW fluids, the Helmholtz potential is a function of two variables, formula_379, where formula_380 is a composition variable (for example formula_381 so formula_382). In this case, there are three stability conditions:
formula_383
and the Helmholtz potential is a surface (of physical interest in the region formula_187). The first two stability conditions show that the curvature in each of the directions formula_5 and formula_380 are both non-negative for stable states, while the third condition indicates that stable states correspond to elliptic points on this surface. Moreover, its limit 
formula_387
specifies the spinodal curves on the surface.

For a binary mixture, the Euler equation can be written in the form 
formula_388
where formula_389 are the molar chemical potentials of each substance, formula_390. For constant values of formula_2, formula_392, and formula_393, this equation is a plane with slopes formula_343 in the formula_5 direction, formula_396 in the formula_380 direction, and intercept formula_392. As in the case of a single substance, here the plane and the surface can have a double tangent, and the locus of the coexisting phase points forms a curve on each surface. The coexistence conditions are that the two phases have the same formula_4, formula_2, formula_396, and formula_392; the last two are equivalent to having the same formula_392 and formula_393 individually, which are just the Gibbs conditions for material equilibrium in this situation. The two methods of producing the coexistence surface are equivalent. 

Although this case is similar to that of a single fluid, here the geometry can be much more complex. The surface can develop a wave (called a plait or fold) in the formula_380 direction as well as the one in the formula_5 direction. Therefore, there can be two liquid phases that can be either miscible, or wholly or partially immiscible, as well as a vapor phase. Despite a great deal of both theoretical and experimental work on this problem by van der Waals and his successors—work which produced much useful knowledge about the various types of phase equilibria that are possible in fluid mixtures—complete solutions to the problem were only obtained after 1967, when the availability of modern computers made calculations of mathematical problems of this complexity feasible for the first time. The results obtained were, in Rowlinson&#x27;s words,
a spectacular vindication of the essential physical correctness of the ideas behind the van der Waals equation, for almost every kind of critical behavior found in practice can be reproduced by the calculations, and the range of parameters that correlate with the different kinds of behavior are intelligible in terms of the expected effects of size and energy.

=== Mixing rules ===

In order to obtain these numerical results, the values of the constants of the individual component fluids formula_407 must be known. In addition, the effect of collisions between molecules of the different components, given by formula_408 and formula_325, must also be specified. In the absence of experimental data, or computer modeling results to estimate their value the empirical combining rules, geometric and algebraic means can be used, respectively: 
formula_410

These relations correspond to the empirical combining rules for the intermolecular force constants,
formula_411
the first of which follows from a simple interpretation of the dispersion forces in terms of polarizabilities of the individual molecules, while the second is exact for rigid molecules. Using these empirical combining rules to generalize for formula_412 fluid components, the quadradic mixing rules for the material constants are:
formula_413
formula_414

These expressions come into use when mixing gases in proportion, such as when producing tanks of air for diving and managing the behavior of fluid mixtures in engineering applications. However, more sophisticated mixing rules are often necessary, in order to obtain satisfactory agreement with reality over the wide variety of mixtures encountered in practice.

Another method of specifying the vdW constants, pioneered by W.B. Kay and known as &quot;Kay&#x27;s rule&quot;, specifies the effective critical temperature and pressure of the fluid mixture by
formula_415

In terms of these quantities, the vdW mixture constants are 
formula_416
which Kay used as the basis for calculations of the thermodynamic properties of mixtures. Kay&#x27;s idea was adopted by T. W. Leland, who applied it to the molecular parameters formula_417, which are related to formula_418 through formula_419 by formula_420 and formula_421. Using these together with the quadratic mixing rules for formula_418 produces
formula_423 
which is the van der Waals approximation expressed in terms of the intermolecular constants. This approximation, when compared with computer simulations for mixtures, are in good agreement over the range formula_424, namely for molecules of similar diameters. In fact, Rowlinson said of this approximation, &quot;It was, and indeed still is, hard to improve on the original van der Waals recipe when expressed in [this] form&quot;.

== Mathematical and empirical validity ==

Since van der Waals presented his thesis, &quot;[m]any derivations, pseudo-derivations, and plausibility arguments have been given&quot; for it. However, no mathematically rigorous derivation of the equation over its entire range of molar volume that begins from a statistical mechanical principle exists. Indeed, such a proof is not possible, even for hard spheres. Goodstein writes, &quot;Obviously the value of the van der Waals equation rests principally on its empirical behavior rather than its theoretical foundation.&quot;

=== History of derivations ===

The classical canonical partition function, formula_425, of statistical mechanics for a three dimensional formula_10 particle macroscopic system is

\,\exp[-\Phi({\bf r^N})/kT]\,d{\bf r^N} &lt;/math&gt;|}}

where formula_427, formula_428 is the de Broglie wavelength (alternatively formula_429 is the quantum concentration), formula_430 is the formula_10 particle configuration integral, and formula_432 is the intermolecular potential energy, which is a function of the formula_10 particle position vectors formula_434. Lastly formula_435 is the volume element of formula_436, which is a formula_437-dimensional space. 

The connection of formula_438 with thermodynamics is made through the Helmholtz free energy, formula_439, from which all other properties can be found; in particular formula_440. For point particles that have no force interactions (formula_441), all formula_437 integrals of formula_443 can be evaluated producing formula_444. In the thermodynamic limit, formula_445 with formula_446 finite, the Helmholtz free energy per particle (or per mole, or per unit mass) is finite; for example, per mole it is formula_447. The thermodynamic state equations in this case are those of a monatomic ideal gas, specifically
formula_448 

Early derivations of the vdW equation were criticized mainly on two grounds. First, a rigorous derivation from the partition function should produce an equation that does not include unstable states for which, formula_449. Second, the constant formula_450 in the vdW equation (here formula_451 is the volume of a single molecule) gives the maximum possible number of molecules as formula_452, or a close packing density of 1/4=0.25, whereas the known close-packing density of spheres is formula_453. Thus a single value of formula_7 cannot describe both gas and liquid states.

The second criticism is an indication that the vdW equation cannot be valid over the entire range of molar volume. Van der Waals was well aware of this problem; he devoted about 30% of his Nobel lecture to it, and also said that it is
... the weak point in the study of the equation of state. I still wonder whether there is a better way. In fact this question continually obsesses me, I can never free myself from it, it is with me even in my dreams.
In 1949 the first criticism was confirmed by van Hove when he showed that in the thermodynamic limit, hard spheres with finite-range attractive forces have a finite Helmholtz free energy per particle. Furthermore, this free energy is a continuously decreasing function of the volume per particle (see Fig. 8 where formula_455 are molar quantities). In addition, its derivative exists and defines the pressure, which is a non-increasing function of the volume per particle. Since the vdW equation has states for which the pressure increases with increasing volume per particle, this proof means it cannot be derived from the partition function, without an additional constraint that precludes those states.

In 1891 Korteweg used kinetic theory ideas to show that a system of formula_10 hard rods of length formula_457, constrained to move along a straight line of length formula_458 and exerting only direct contact forces on one another, satisfy a vdW equation with formula_301; Rayleigh also knew this. Tonks, by evaluating the configuration integral, later showed that the force exerted on a wall by this system is given by formula_460 with formula_461. This can be put in a more recognizable, molar, form by dividing by the rod cross sectional area formula_462, and defining formula_463. This produces formula_464; there is no condensation, as formula_465 for all formula_42. This result is obtained because in one dimension, particles cannot pass by one another as they can in higher dimensions; their mass center coordinates formula_467 satisfy the relations formula_468. As a result, the configuration integral is formula_469. 

In 1959 this one-dimensional gas model was extended by Kac to include particle pair interactions through an attractive potential, 
formula_470. This specific form allowed evaluation of the grand partition function,

{{Numblk|:|formula_471|{{EquationRef|9}}}}

in the thermodynamic limit, in terms of the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of a homogeneous integral equation.{{sfn|ps=|Kac|1958}} Although an explicit equation of state was not obtained, it was proved that the pressure was a strictly decreasing function of the volume per particle, hence condensation did not occur. 
Four years later, in 1963, Kac together with Uhlenbeck and Hemmer modified the pair potential of Kac&#x27;s previous work as formula_472, so that
formula_473 
was independent of formula_474.{{sfn|ps=|Kac|Uhlenbeck|Hemmer|1963|pp=216-217}} They found that a second limiting process they called the &quot;van der Waals limit&quot;, formula_475 (in which the pair potential becomes both infinitely long range and infinitely weak) and performed after the thermodynamic limit, produced the one-dimensional vdW equation (here rendered in molar form)
formula_476
as well as the Gibbs criterion, formula_477 (equivalently the Maxwell construction). As a result, all isotherms satisfy the condition formula_478 as shown in Figure 9, and hence the first criticism of the vdW equation is not as serious as originally thought.{{sfn|ps=|Kac|Uhlenbeck|Hemmer|1963|p=224}}

Then, in 1966, Lebowitz and Penrose generalized what they called the &quot;Kac potential&quot;, formula_21, to apply to a nonspecific function of formula_480 dimensions:
formula_481

For formula_482 and formula_483 this reduces to the specific one-dimensional function considered by Kac, et al., and for formula_484 it is an arbitrary function (although subject to specific requirements) in physical three-dimensional space. In fact, the function formula_485 must be bounded, non-negative, and one whose integral
formula_486 
is finite, independent of formula_474.{{sfn|ps=|Lebowitz|Penrose|1966|p=98}}{{sfn|ps=|Lebowitz|1974|pp=50-52}} By obtaining upper and lower bounds on formula_488 and hence on formula_489, taking the thermodynamic limit (formula_490 with formula_491 finite) to obtain upper and lower bounds on the function formula_492, then subsequently taking the van der Waals limit, they found that the two bounds coalesced and thereby produced a unique limit (here written in terms of the free energy per mole and the molar volume):
formula_493

The abbreviation formula_494 stands for &quot;convex envelope&quot;; this is a function which is the largest convex function that is less than or equal to the original function. The function formula_495 is the limit function when formula_496; also here formula_497. This result is illustrated in Figure 8 by the solid green curves and black line, which is the convex envelope of formula_350. 

The corresponding limit for the pressure is a generalized form of the vdW equation
formula_499
together with the Gibbs criterion, formula_477 (equivalently the Maxwell construction). Here formula_501 is the pressure when attractive molecular forces are absent. 

The conclusion from all this work is that a rigorous mathematical derivation from the partition function produces a generalization of the vdW equation together with the Gibbs criterion if the attractive force is infinitely weak with an infinitely long range. In that case, formula_502, the pressure that results from direct particle collisions (or more accurately the core repulsive forces), replaces formula_503. This is consistent with the second criticism, which can be stated as formula_504. Consequently, the vdW equation cannot be rigorously derived from the configuration integral over the entire range of formula_5. 

Nevertheless, it is possible to derive the vdW equation using the virial expansion in the limits formula_506. Consequently the equation produces an accurate approximation in a region defined by formula_507 (on a molecular basis formula_508), which corresponds to a dilute gas. But as the density increases, the behavior of the vdW approximation and the two-term virial expansion differ markedly. Whereas the virial approximation in this instance either increases or decreases continuously, the vdW approximation together with the Maxwell construction expresses physical reality in the form of a phase change, while also indicating the existence of metastable states. This difference in behaviors was pointed out by Korteweg{{sfn|ps=|Korteweg|1891a|p=}} and Rayleigh (see Rowlinson{{sfn|ps=|van der Waals|1984|p=20}}) in the course of their dispute with Tait about the vdW equation. 

===Empirical justification===
In this extended region, use of the vdW equation is not justified mathematically; however, it has empirical validity. Its various applications in this region that attest to this, both qualitative and quantitative, have been described previously in this article. This point was also made by Alder, et al. who, at a conference marking the 100th anniversary of van der Waals&#x27; thesis, noted that:{{sfn|ps=|Alder|Alley|Rigby|1974|p=143}} 
It is doubtful whether we would celebrate the centennial of the Van der Waals equation if it were applicable only under circumstances where it has been proven to be rigorously valid. It is empirically well established that many systems whose molecules have attractive potentials that are neither long-range nor weak conform nearly quantatively to the Van der Waals model. An example is the theoretically much studied system of Argon, where the attractive potential has only a range half as large as the repulsive core. They continued by saying that this model has &quot;validity down to temperatures below the critical temperature, where the attractive potential is not weak at all but, in fact, comparable to the thermal energy.&quot; They also described its application to mixtures &quot;where the Van der Waals model has also been applied with great success. In fact, its success has been so great that not a single other model of the many proposed since, has equalled its quantitative predictions, let alone its simplicity.&quot;{{sfn|ps=|Alder|Alley|Rigby|1974|p=144}}

Engineers have made extensive use of this empirical validity, modifying the equation in numerous ways (by one account there have been some 400 cubic equations of state produced){{sfn|ps=|Valderrama|2003|p=1606}} in order to manage the liquids,{{sfn|ps=|Vera|Prausnitz|1972|p=7-10}} and gases of pure substances and mixtures,{{sfn|ps=|Kontogeorgis|Privat|Jaubert|2019|pp=4626-4629}} that they encounter in practice. 

This situation has been aptly described by Boltzmann:{{sfn|ps=|Boltzmann|1995|p=356}}
... van der Waals has given us such a valuable tool that it would cost us much trouble to obtain by the subtlest deliberations a formula that would really be more useful than the one that van der Waals found by inspiration, as it were.

<text>Miles Wedderburn Lampson, 1st Baron Killearn, (24 August 1880 – 18 September 1964) was a British diplomat.

== Background and education ==

Miles Lampson was the son of Norman Lampson, and grandson of Sir Curtis Lampson, 1st Baronet. His mother was Helen, daughter of Peter Blackburn, MP for Stirlingshire. 
He was educated at Eton.

== Diplomatic career ==

Lampson entered the Foreign Office in 1903. He served as Secretary to Garter Mission, Japan, in 1906, as 2nd Secretary at Tokyo, Japan, between 1908 and 1910, as 2nd Secretary at Sofia, Bulgaria in 1911, as 1st Secretary at Peking in 1916, as Acting British High Commissioner in Siberia in 1920 and as British Minister to China between 1926 and 1933.

In 1934 he was appointed High Commissioner for Egypt and the Sudan. In 1935 following demands from the Egyptian prime minister Mostafa el-Nahas for a new Anglo-Egyptian treaty, Lampson embarked on the talks. The increasing aggressive claims by Italy that the entire Mediterranean and Red Sea areas were in the Italian sphere of influence led to Lampson being instructed that because of &quot;the rise of Italy as a Mediterranean and North African Power that &quot;that the retention of a British garrison on the Suez Canal and at or in the vicinity of Alexandria is essential&quot;. Despite the apparent weaker hand of el-Nahas, the two were about equal as the Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden advised Lampson: &quot;Failure to negotiate a treaty with Egypt, followed by disturbances in that country, their suppression by British forces and the government of Egypt by His Majesty&#x27;s Government by force and against the will of the Egyptian people, would be represented throughout the Arab Near East possibly as a sign of British bad faith, certainly as a proof of British imperialism pursued at the expense of a weaker Mohametan country&quot;. 

As a result of the Anglo-Egyptian treaty of 1936, to which Lampson was a signatory, Britain loosened its grip on Egypt and the post title was changed to Ambassador to Egypt and High Commissioner for the Sudan in 1936. Under the terms of the treaty signed on 26 August 1936, the British retained the Suez canal base; the right to use Alexandria as a naval base for the next 8 years along with the right to station air and ground forces to defend the Alexandria base; the right to defend the Egyptian border with the Italian colony of Libya; and the right to use all facilities in Egypt to support British forces in the event of war. Lampson made the concessions, but all the essential points, the Anglo-Egyptian treaty was a triumph for British interests. Lampson was helped by the fact that el-Nahas and the rest of the Wafd were also concerned about Italian imperialism. Lampson continued in this office until 1946. As ambassador to Egypt he forced King Farouk I to change the cabinet to a Wafdist one through surrounding the king&#x27;s palace with tanks in the Abdeen Palace incident of 1942.

He was then Special Commissioner in Southeast Asia between 1946 and 1948. He was admitted to the Privy Council in 1941 and raised to the peerage as &quot;Baron Killearn&quot;, of Killearn in the County of Stirling, on 17 May 1943. He was also awarded the Order of the Rising Sun, Gold Rays with Neck Ribbon of Japan and the Order of the Sacred Treasure, Gold Rays with Neck Ribbon of Japan.

== Family ==

Lord Killearn married firstly Rachel, daughter of William Wilton Phipps, in 1912. They had one son and two daughters:
* Graham Curtis Lampson, 2nd Baron Killearn (1919–1996). He died leaving daughters only, the youngest Hon. Nadine Marisa Lampson being married to Sir Nicholas Bonsor, Bt.
* Hon. Mary Lampson
* Hon. Margaret Lampson

After Rachel&#x27;s death in 1930 he married secondly Jacqueline Aldine Leslie Castellani (1910–2015), daughter of Aldo Castellani,  (Hon.), in 1934. They had one son and two daughters:
* Victor Miles George Aldous Lampson, 3rd Baron Killearn. He has issue, including a son and heir apparent.
* Hon. Jacquetta Jean Frederica Lampson; she married Peregrine Eliot, 10th Earl of St Germans, and had issue, three sons.
* Hon. Roxana Rose Catherine Naila Lampson. She married Ian Ross, mother of six children, including the musicians Atticus Ross, Leopold Ross and the model Liberty Ross.

Lampson was a close personal friend of Sir Edward Peel.

== Succession ==

Lord Killearn died in September 1964, aged 84, and was succeeded in the barony by his son by his first marriage, Graham. As Graham died without male heirs, the title subsequently passed to Lord Killearn&#x27;s son from his second marriage, Victor.

The 3rd Lord Killearn took legal action in 2011 to prevent his mother selling off the family home, Haremere Hall.

<text>Brigadier General Bonner Frank Fellers (February 7, 1896 – October 7, 1973) was a United States Army officer who served during World War II as a military attaché and director of psychological warfare. He is notable as the military attaché in Egypt whose extensive transmissions of detailed British tactical information were unknowingly intercepted by Axis agents and passed to Nazi German &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; Erwin Rommel for over six months, which contributed to disastrous British defeats at Gazala and Tobruk in June 1942.

==Early military career==

Fellers studied at Earlham College until he was appointed to the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, by Speaker of the House Joe Cannon. He entered the Military Academy in June 1916, ten months before the American entry into World War I. The increased need for junior officers during World War I caused Fellers&#x27;s class to be accelerated and to graduate on November 1, 1918, ten days before the armistice with the German &quot;Reich&quot; which ended the war. Upon his graduation, Fellers was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the United States Army Coast Artillery Corps.

Fellers was promoted to first lieutenant in October 1919 and graduated from the Coast Artillery School Basic Course in 1920. The drastic reduction in the size of the army after the war created limited opportunities for promotion and so Fellers was not promoted to captain until December 3, 1934. In 1935, he graduated from the Command and General Staff School and the Chemical Warfare Service Field Officers Course, when he completed his soon-to-be-influential thesis &quot;The Psychology of the Japanese Soldier.&quot;

Fellers served three tours of duty in the Philippines in the 1920s and the 1930s, including assignment to the Office of the Military Advisor to the Commonwealth Government of the Philippines, under General Douglas MacArthur; while there, Captain Fellers interacted with Major (later Lieutenant Colonel) Dwight D. Eisenhower, a senior member of MacArthur&#x27;s staff. His assignments included helping to open the Philippine Military Academy, the Philippines&#x27; &quot;West Point,&quot; and liaisoning with Philippine President Manuel Quezon. The Philippines awarded him its Distinguished Service Star for his contributions to its defenses.

Fellers graduated from the Army War College in June 1939. He then served as an assistant professor of English at West Point from July 1939 to August 1940 and was promoted to major on July 1, 1940. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel in the war-footing Army of the United States (as compared to his rank of major in the Regular Army) on September 15, 1941, and to colonel the following month.

==World War II==
=== Italians and Germans access to Fellers&#x27;s reports ===
In October 1940, Major Fellers was assigned as military attaché to the U.S. embassy in Egypt. He was assigned the duty of monitoring and reporting on British military operations in the Mediterranean and Middle East Theatre. The British granted Fellers access to their activities and information. He dutifully reported everything he learned to his superiors in the United States. His reports were read by President Franklin Roosevelt, the head of American intelligence, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

Fellers was concerned about the security of the &quot;Black Code&quot; of the U.S. State Department, used when he sent his reports by radiogram. His concerns were overridden. Fellers was right to be concerned, as the details of the code had been stolen from the U.S. embassy in Italy in September 1941 in a covert night raid into the embassy by Italian spies from the Servizio Informazioni Militare (SIM), the Italian military intelligence service. This enabled the Italians to read the reports, and within eight hours, the most secret data on British &quot;strengths, positions, losses, reinforcements, supply, situation, plans, morale etc&quot; would be in the hands of the German and the Italian militaries.

Around the same time, the Black Code was also broken by Nazi Germany&#x27;s cryptanalysts. The Germans could identify Fellers&#x27;s report, starting just before the U.S. entered into WWII until June 29, 1942, when Fellers switched to a newly adopted U.S. code system.

Fellers&#x27;s deciphered radiograms provided the Axis with detailed, extensive, and timely information about troop movements and equipment. Information from his messages alerted the Axis to British convoy operations in the Battle of the Mediterranean, including efforts to resupply the garrison of Malta. In January 1942 information about numbers and the condition of British forces was provided to &quot;Generalleutnant&quot; Erwin Rommel (&quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; from May onwards), the German commander in Africa, who could thus plan his operations with reliable knowledge of what the opposing forces were. The Germans referred to Fellers as &quot;die gute Quelle&quot; (&quot;the good source&quot;). Rommel referred to him as &quot;the little fellow.&quot;

The deciphered code cost the Allies many lives. For example, in June 1942, the British attempted to resupply Malta, which was under constant air attack and was being starved. The British determined to sail two supply convoys simultaneously in the hopes that if one were to become discovered, attacks upon it would distract the Axis from the other. Codenamed Operation Vigorous and Harpoon and sailing from Alexandria in the east and Gibraltar in the west, respectively, their sailing was timed with an effort by special forces teams to neutralize Axis ships and aircraft. Fellers efficiently reported all of that in his cable, No. 11119 dated June 11, which was intercepted in both Rome and by the German Military High Command Cipher Branch (&quot;OKW Chiffrierabteilung&quot;). It read, in part:

NIGHTS OF JUNE 12TH JUNE 13TH BRITISH SABOTAGE UNITS PLAN SIMULTANEOUS STICKER BOMB ATTACKS AGAINST AIRCRAFT ON 9 AXIS AIRDROMES. PLANS TO REACH OBJECTIVES BY PARACHUTES AND LONG RANGE DESERT PATROL.

British and Free French raiders went into action behind the lines in Libya and on the island of Crete. In most of the attacks, the raiders were met with accurate fire from the alerted garrisons and suffered heavy losses, but failed to inflict any damage upon the Luftwaffe. Their only success came when Fellers&#x27;s unwitting early warnings were not received or were ignored or ineptly handled. Meanwhile, both convoys were located and came under attack. A day after leaving Gibraltar, Convoy Harpoon&#x27;s six merchant ships and their escorts came under continuous air and surface attack. Only two of the merchant ships survived to reach Malta. Convoy Vigorous was the larger effort. Made up of 11 merchant ships, it suffered such serious losses that it was forced to turn back to Egypt.

Debates continue on how the breaking of the code Fellers was assigned had impacted the overall battle for North Africa. For example, John Ferris argues that because Fellers sometimes reported imperfect information and assessments, the leaks also contributed to Rommel&#x27;s ultimate defeat: &quot;In its last days of life, after Tobruk fell, the &#x27;Good Source&#x27; bolstered Rommel&#x27;s decision to drive all-out on Alexandria, his native over-optimism reinforced by Bonner Fellers&#x27;s belief that the British would crack under one last blow. Both men were wrong; this time the intelligence failure led to German defeat.&quot; Other authors, like Robin Lewin, write that breaking Fellers&#x27;s code was &quot;immensely fruitfull&quot;, though at tactical level Lewin also pointed to Rommel&#x27;s Wireless Interception Center for the Axis successes on the ground in the summer of 1942, at least until this unit lost its commander and several operatives in action at Tel El Eisa on July 10, 1942.

===British discover leak from Egypt===
Ultra intercepts seen only by the British indicated the Germans were gaining information from a source in Egypt, and British intelligence had considered Fellers as a possible source. On June 10, 1942, the British became convinced Fellers&#x27;s reports were compromised because an intercept had compared British tactics negatively to American tactics. The British informed the Americans on June 12, who, on June 14, confirmed the finding that Fellers&#x27;s reports were the source. Fellers switched codes on June 29, which ended the leaks.

Fellers was not found at fault for the interception of his reports, but he was transferred from Egypt on July 7, 1942. His successor as attaché used the US military cipher, which the Germans could not read. Upon returning to the United States, Fellers was decorated with the Distinguished Service Medal for his analysis and reporting of the North African situation. He was also promoted to brigadier general, the first in the West Point Class of 1918, on December 4, 1942.

While assigned to the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) in Washington, he was, as recalled by a colleague, &quot;the most violent anglophobe I have encountered.&quot; However, that comment may be colored by the context of the American-British intelligence situation of the time. Fellers&#x27;s North African reports, which his Distinguished Service Medal citation characterized as &quot;models of clarity and accuracy,&quot; were bluntly critical of British weapons, operations, and leadership: &quot;The Eighth Army has failed to maintain the morale of its troops; its tactical conceptions were always wrong, it neglected completely cooperation between the various arms; its reactions to the lightning changes in the battlefield were always slow.&quot; Such assessments, meant for American officials, were deciphered by the Germans, then intercepted from the Germans by the British Ultra signals intelligence.

Despite his anti-British attitude, Fellers and his reports influenced decisions to bring American supplies and troops to aid the British in North Africa. Throughout his tenure in North Africa, Fellers advocated for increased American support for the British in North Africa, which included both weapons and a commitment of American troops. This was at odds with the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the U.S. European Command as to the level of weapons support and an American troop landing. The military policy then was that saving the British in North Africa was not strategically required, especially not through a North Africa invasion (Operation Torch), which would divert focus from Operation Bolero, a plan for an early European invasion.

President Roosevelt admired Fellers&#x27;s reports and was influenced by them enough so that on June 29, General George C. Marshall wrote to Roosevelt, &quot;Fellers is a very valuable observer but his responsibilities are not those of a strategist and his views are in opposition to mine and those of the entire Operations Division.&quot; The President invited Fellers to the White House upon his return from Cairo, and they met on July 30, 1942. &quot;Consistent with his previous reporting through 1942, Fellers argued for robust and expeditious reinforcement of British forces in the Middle East.&quot; Thus, Fellers&#x27;s blunt criticism and his analysis of the Middle East&#x27;s strategic importance may well have influenced Roosevelt&#x27;s decisions to reinforce the Eighth Army and to support Operation Torch.

===Transfer to Pacific===
In the summer of 1943, Fellers left his job in the OSS, where he had played a role in planning psychological warfare, and he returned to the Southwest Pacific and resumed working under General Douglas MacArthur, who was then Commander of United States Army Forces in the Far East. Fellers served as military secretary and the Chief of Psychological Operations under MacArthur.

During the liberation of the Philippines from the Japanese, Fellers had several assignments, including Director of Civil Affairs for the Philippines. For his efforts, Fellers received a second Philippine Distinguished Service Star.

General Dwight D. Eisenhower had been at odds with Fellers since they served together in the 1930s under General MacArthur in the Philippines. In a recollection in her personal diary, the Countess of Ranfurly wrote of a comment made by Eisenhower when she expressed admiration for Fellers. Eisenhower reportedly replied, &quot;Any friend of Bonner Fellers is no friend of mine!&quot; Eisenhower apologized the next day for his rudeness. Eisenhower may have developed such a view because he was aware of the North Africa leaks that had strained British relations and because Fellers had been instrumental in getting presidential approval of increased support for the British in North Africa including Operation Torch, which was not supported by the U.S. military command, including Eisenhower.

==Post-war Japan==

After the war, Fellers remained on the staff of MacArthur, who was Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers in the occupation of Japan. Among his duties was liaison between HQ and the Imperial Household. Soon after occupation began, Fellers wrote several influential memoranda concerning why it would be advantageous for the occupation, reconstruction of Japan, and long-term US interests to keep Emperor Hirohito in place if he was not clearly responsible for war crimes.

Fellers met with the major defendants of the Tokyo tribunal. Under an assignment with the codename &quot;Operation Blacklist&quot;, Fellers allowed them to co-ordinate their stories to exonerate Hirohito and all members of his family of war crimes. This was done at the behest of MacArthur, who had decided that there was to be no criminal prosecution of the Emperor or his family.

General Fellers, who came from a Religious Society of Friends family (commonly known as Quakers) and attended the Quaker-affiliated Earlham College, was instrumental in the selection of Elizabeth Vining, an American Quaker educator, as tutor to the Emperor&#x27;s children.

In 1971, Hirohito conferred on Fellers the Second Order of the Sacred Treasure &quot;in recognition of your long-standing contribution to promoting friendship between Japan and the United States.&quot;

Fellers&#x27;s role in exonerating Hirohito is the main subject of the 2012 film &quot;Emperor&quot;. Fellers was also featured as a protagonist in the 2022 alternative history novel &quot;Atomic Sunrise&quot; by R.M. Christianson.

Fellers was also familiar with the writings of Lafcadio Hearn and became a friend of Hearn&#x27;s descendants in Japan, the Koizumi family.

==Army retirement and later life==
In February 1946, Fellers reverted to the rank of colonel as part of a reduction in rank of 212 generals. He retired from the army on November 30, 1946. In 1948, his retirement rank was reinstated as brigadier general.

After retiring from the Army, he worked for the Republican National Committee in Washington, D.C. In 1952 Fellers was actively involved in promoting Robert A. Taft as a presidential candidate. On July 24, 1953, Fellers met with a number of former U.S. military officers, including Pedro del Valle and Claire Chennault, to form the Defenders of the American Constitution (DAC). The DAC believed in a &quot;one-worldist conspiracy&quot; led by New York Jewish financiers who controlled international communism, and described their goal as the defense of &quot;the US constitution against enemies and encroachments, both foreign and domestic.&quot;

Fellers was a member of the John Birch Society, which is named after a military intelligence officer, who was considered by its founding members to be the first casualty of the Cold War. In 1953 Fellers, wrote a book: &quot;Wings for Peace: A Primer for a New Defense&quot; (Chicago: Henry Regnery Co., 1953). In 1964, Fellers was actively involved in promoting Barry Goldwater for the presidency.

He died at Georgetown University Hospital in Washington, D.C., on October 7, 1973, after suffering a heart attack, and was buried at Arlington National Cemetery.

<text>Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol version 3 is an IETF standard related to L2TP that can be used as an alternative protocol to Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) for encapsulation of multiprotocol Layer 2 communications traffic over IP networks. Like L2TP, L2TPv3 provides a pseudo-wire service, but scaled to fit carrier requirements.

L2TPv3 can be regarded as being to MPLS what IP is to ATM: a simplified version of the same concept, with much of the same benefit achieved at a fraction of the effort, at the cost of losing some technical features considered less important in the market. In the case of L2TPv3, the features lost are teletraffic engineering features considered important in MPLS. However, there is no reason these features could not be re-engineered in or on top of L2TPv3 in later products. The protocol overhead of L2TPv3 is also significantly bigger than MPLS.

<doc id="206082" wikidata="Q1322455" url="?curid=206082" title="USS West Virginia (BB-48)">
<text>USS &quot;West Virginia&quot; (BB-48) was the fourth dreadnought battleship of the , though because was cancelled, she was the third and final member of the class to be completed. The &quot;Colorado&quot; class proved to be the culmination of the standard-type battleship series built for the United States Navy in the 1910s and 1920s; the ships were essentially repeats of the earlier design, but with a significantly more powerful main battery of eight guns in twin-gun turrets. &quot;West Virginia&quot; was built between her keel laying in 1920 and her commissioning into the Navy in 1923. The ship spent the 1920s and 1930s conducting routine training exercises, including the typically annual Fleet Problems, which provided invaluable experience for the coming war in the Pacific.

&quot;West Virginia&quot; was moored on Battleship Row on the morning of 7 December 1941 when Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, bringing the United States into World War II. Badly damaged by torpedoes, the ship sank in the shallow water but was later refloated and extensively rebuilt over the course of 1943 and into mid-1944. She returned to service in time for the Philippines Campaign, where she led the American line of battle at the Battle of Surigao Strait on the night of 24–25 October. There, she was one of the few American battleships to use her radar to acquire a target in the darkness, allowing her to engage a Japanese squadron in what was the final action between battleships in naval history.

After Surigao Strait, the ship remained in the Philippines to support troops fighting during the Battle of Leyte in 1944 and then supported the invasion of Lingayen Gulf in early 1945. The ship also took part in the Battles of Iwo Jima and Okinawa later that year, providing extensive fire support to the ground forces invading those islands. During the latter operation, she was hit by a &quot;kamikaze&quot; that did little damage. Following the surrender of Japan, &quot;West Virginia&quot; took part in the initial occupation and thereafter participated in Operation Magic Carpet, carrying soldiers and sailors from Hawaii to the mainland United States before being deactivated in 1946. She was decommissioned in 1947 and assigned to the Pacific Reserve Fleet, where she remained until 1959 when she was sold to ship breakers and dismantled.

==Design==

In 1916, design work was completed on the next class of battleships to be built for the United States Navy beginning in 1917. These ships were nearly direct copies of the preceding , with the exception of the main battery, which increased from twelve guns to eight guns. The &quot;Colorado&quot; class proved to be the last class of battleships completed of the standard type.

&quot;West Virginia&quot; was long overall and she had a beam of and a draft of . She displaced as designed and up to at full load. The ship was powered by four General Electric turbo-electric drives with steam provided by eight oil-fired Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers. The ship&#x27;s propulsion system was rated at for a top speed of , though on speed trials she reached and a speed of . She had a normal cruising range of at , but additional fuel space could be used in wartime to increase her range to at that speed. Her crew numbered 64 officers and 1,241 enlisted men.

She was armed with a main battery of eight 16 in /45 caliber Mark 1 guns in four twin-gun turrets on the centerline, two forward and two aft in superfiring pairs. The secondary battery consisted of sixteen /51 caliber guns, mounted individually in casemates clustered in the superstructure amidships. She carried an anti-aircraft battery of eight /50 caliber guns in individual high-angle mounts. As was customary for capital ships of the period, she had a torpedo tube mounted in her hull below the waterline on each broadside. &quot;West Virginia&quot;″s main armored belt was thick, while the main armored deck was up to thick. The main battery gun turrets had thick faces on barbettes. Her conning tower had thick sides.

==Service history==
===Prewar career===
The keel for &quot;West Virginia&quot; was laid down at the Newport News Shipbuilding Company of Newport News, Virginia on 12 April 1920. While under construction, she received the hull number BB-48 on 17 July. Her completed hull was launched on 17 November 1921 and she was commissioned on 1 December 1923. &quot;West Virginia&quot; was to have been the fourth member of the class, but her sister ship was cancelled due to the Washington Naval Treaty that was signed in 1922. Captain Thomas J. Senn was the ship&#x27;s first commander. On entering service, she began sea trials and a shakedown cruise, followed by repairs at Newport News. She then sailed north to the New York Navy Yard for further alterations. She then steamed south to Hampton Roads, and while en route her steering gear malfunctioned. She underwent an overhaul there to correct the problem and she got underway again on 16 June 1924; while cruising through Lynnhaven Channel at 10:10, the telegraphs for the engine room and steering compartment lost power, rendering the ship unmaneuverable. Senn had to use voice tubes to communicate with the engine room, ordering the port engines to full power and the starboard to stop in an attempt to steer the ship away from the shore. But &quot;West Virginia&quot; drifted in the channel and ran aground, though she was not damaged in the accident. A subsequent inquiry into the incident faulted incorrect navigational data that exaggerated the size of the navigable part of the channel, exonerating Senn and the ship&#x27;s navigator.

On 30 October, &quot;West Virginia&quot; became the flagship for the Commander, Battleship Divisions, Battle Fleet. The ship spent the 1920s conducting routine training exercises and maneuvers with the fleet, punctuated by periodic overhauls; each year&#x27;s training schedule culminated in the major Fleet Problems that tested operational and strategic doctrine that proved to be critical in the operations conducted against Japan during World War II. These operations took place in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, as far north as Alaska and as far south as Panama. In 1925, while Captain Arthur Japy Hepburn commanded the ship, her gunners scored first place during a competition for short range shooting. &quot;West Virginia&quot; won the Battle Efficiency ribbon that year as well. Later in 1925, the fleet conducted joint Army-Navy maneuvers in Hawaii to test the defenses of the islands before embarking on a major cruise to visit Australia and New Zealand. &quot;West Virginia&quot; won Battle Efficiency ribbons in 1927, 1932, and 1933. During Fleet Problem X in March 1930, &quot;West Virginia&quot; was &quot;bombed&quot; by aircraft from the aircraft carrier . In Fleet Problem XI, held the following month, she and the battleship accidentally engaged the carrier , a fellow member of the &quot;black&quot; fleet, mistaking her for the &quot;blue&quot; fleet carrier &quot;Lexington&quot;. The simulated friendly fire cost &quot;black&quot; fleet their carrier and led to calls for improved communication between ships and better ship identification training.
In the early 1930s, the ship underwent a minor modification. Her battery of 3-inch anti-aircraft guns were replaced with 5-inch /25 cal. guns and .50-caliber machine guns were installed on her fore and main masts. She also received aircraft catapults on her quarterdeck and atop the rear superfiring turret. During Fleet Problem XIV in February 1933, &quot;West Virginia&quot; and the battleship were &quot;damaged&quot; in a surprise attack by &quot;black&quot; fleet submarines. Plans to modernize &quot;West Virginia&quot; dated to the mid-1930s, when the navy considered modifying the ship extensively; the Bureau of Construction and Repair planned to add anti-torpedo bulges that would have restored a considerable amount of buoyancy to the hull, raising her at the cost of an additional displacement. The work was not carried out, and in 1937 further plans to modernize &quot;West Virginia&quot;, her sister ships, and the two &quot;Tennessee&quot;-class ships, were considered. The proposed modifications included new boilers and fire control equipment and the previously suggested bulges. Further development of the modernization program in 1938 was rejected due to its cost and the fact that, even as modernized, the vessels would be inferior to the new and s being built.

Following the outbreak of World War II in 1939, Admiral Ernest King led a board to evaluate anti-aircraft defenses of the fleet&#x27;s ships, and it recommended adding blisters to restore freeboard, the adoption of 5 in /38 cal. dual-purpose guns, and a strengthening of the ships&#x27; decks. The Chief of Naval Operations decided that, as a result of the likelihood of war, only the bulges would be fitted, and &quot;West Virginia&quot; was slated to undergo the work from 10 May to 8 August 1941, though the modification was not carried out. The Navy conducted the final iteration of the series, Fleet Problem XXI, in April 1940, by which time tensions with Japan over the latter&#x27;s initiation of the Second Sino-Japanese War had led the United States to transfer the fleet from California to Pearl Harbor in Hawaii as a deterrent to further aggression by Japan. The fleet spent 1941 occupied with extensive training to prepare for the anticipated war with Japan, even after the diplomatic situation increasingly worsened in the final months of the year. During this period, the Navy sought to improve the anti-aircraft batteries of the fleet&#x27;s battleships, but production of the new guns was slow, so old 3 in guns were reinstalled as a temporary measure. The ship also had eleven .50-cal. machine guns by this time. In June, men aboard &quot;West Virginia&quot; fabricated an experimental gun shield for the 5 in guns, which were to be applied to other ships. &quot;West Virginia&quot; was to have had her 1.1 in guns installed in February 1942.

=== World War II ===
==== Pearl Harbor ====
On the morning of 7 December 1941, &quot;West Virginia&quot; and the rest of the fleet were moored at Battleship Row in Pearl Harbor; &quot;West Virginia&quot; was tied alongside &quot;Tennessee&quot;. Japanese aircraft appeared over the harbor shortly before 08:00, beginning the surprise attack on the base. Torpedo bombers hit the ship with seven Type 91 torpedoes on her port side, while bombers hit her with a pair of armor-piercing shells that had been converted into bombs. The first bomb hit the port side and penetrated the superstructure deck, causing extensive damage to the casemates below. Secondary explosions of the ammunition stored in the casemates caused serious fires there and in the galley deck below them. The second bomb struck the rear superfiring turret roof; it penetrated but failed to explode. It nevertheless destroyed one of the guns, the OS2U Kingfisher floatplane on the catapult atop the turret, and knocked a second aircraft down to the main deck. That Kingfisher spilled gasoline on the deck that then caught on fire.

One of the torpedoes hit aft, disabling the rudder, at least three hit below the belt armor, and at least one hit the belt, damaging seven armor plates. These torpedoes opened two large holes in the hull, from frames 43 to 52 and from 62 to 97; at least one torpedo passed through the holes after the ship began to list and exploded on the second armor deck. The torpedo hits caused extensive damage and the ship avoided capsizing only through prompt damage control efforts initiated by Lieutenant Claude V. Ricketts, then the ship&#x27;s assistant fire control officer. Captain Mervyn S. Bennion was mortally wounded by bomb fragments from a hit on &quot;Tennessee&quot;; for remaining aboard the ship and assisting in its defense until he died, he was awarded the Medal of Honor. After receiving his wounds, Bennion was carried from the bridge by crew members including mess attendant second-class Doris Miller. Shortly afterwards, Miller was ordered to man an anti-aircraft gun on the conning tower despite no training in the operation of the weapon, Miller was awarded a Navy Cross for his actions. As the ship filled with water and slowly sank on an even keel, the crew was evacuated, though a group volunteered to return to fight the fires that had broken out. Fuel oil leaking from the destroyed &quot;Arizona&quot; caught fire and engulfed &quot;West Virginia&quot; in flames, which was also fed by her own leaking fuel oil. The fires were eventually put out the next day. A total of 106 men were killed in the attack. Among them were three sailors (Ronald Endicott, Clifford Olds and Louis Costin), who survived in an airtight storeroom until 23 December, according to a calendar found by salvage crews on which sixteen days had been crossed off in red pencil. On 6 December 2019, the Department of Defense announced that eight of the thirty-five unknown remains from &quot;West Virginia&quot; had been identified.

==== Repairs and modernization ====
Workers fixed patches over the two torpedo holes and pumped &quot;West Virginia&quot; dry, refloating her on 17 May 1942. She was then taken into Dry Dock No. 1 in Pearl Harbor on 9 June for an inspection; it had been initially believed that she had been hit by five torpedoes, but a sixth impact had been discovered during the patching, and this inspection revealed the seventh hit. The shipyard workers then began temporary repairs to make the ship seaworthy, and during this period they discovered the remains of 66 or 70 men who had been trapped below decks when she sank. Some of these had survived for several days in air bubbles with emergency rations and fresh water, but their oxygen and supplies ran out long before the ship was refloated. After completing repairs, &quot;West Virginia&quot; got underway for the Puget Sound Navy Yard in Bremerton, Washington for a thorough reconstruction.

Almost immediately after the attack, the navy began considering the extent to which the old battleships should be modernized, with proposals to replace the lattice masts with other structures that could accommodate the heavier radar equipment being fitted to the fleet&#x27;s ships. Since &quot;West Virginia&quot; and had been badly damaged in the Pearl Harbor attack and thus could not be quickly returned to service like the other battleships, they would have the bulges that had been planned before the war installed, which would offset the loss of freeboard incurred by the addition of of deck armor. Plans were also made to install a battery of the dual-purpose 5-inch guns, but the work was deferred as a result of the length of time necessary to reconstruct the ship. In addition, the limited number of drydocks on the west coast slowed the pace of reconstruction, and &quot;West Virginia&quot; had to wait until &quot;Tennessee&quot; and &quot;California&quot; were rebuilt; work on &quot;West Virginia&quot; was not completed until September 1944.

Work on &quot;West Virginia&quot; saw the ship radically altered. In addition to the torpedo bulges, her superstructure was completely revised, with the old heavily armored conning tower being removed and a smaller tower erected in its place to reduce interference with the anti-aircraft guns&#x27; fields of fire. The new tower had been removed from one of the s that had recently been rebuilt. The foremast was replaced with a tower mast that housed the bridge and the main battery director, and her second funnel was removed, with those boilers being trunked into an enlarged forward funnel. The ship&#x27;s weapons suite was also overhauled. She received air-search radar and fire-control radars for her main and secondary batteries, the latter being replaced by a uniform battery of sixteen 5-inch/38 cal. guns in eight twin mounts. These were controlled by four Mk 37 directors. The light anti-aircraft battery was again revised, now consisting of ten quadruple Bofors guns and forty-three 20 mm Oerlikons.

By early July 1944, the ship was ready to begin sea trials in her post-refit condition. She loaded ammunition on 2 July and departed for trials off Port Townsend, Washington, with the evaluations continuing until 12 July, at which point she returned to Puget Sound for repairs. She then steamed south to San Pedro, Los Angeles for a shakedown cruise before departing for Hawaii on 14 September in company with a pair of escorting destroyers. After arriving there on 23 September, she joined Battleship Division 4 (BatDiv 4) and the carrier , all of which sailed on to Manus in the Admiralty Islands to begin preparations for the upcoming operations in the Philippines. The ships arrived in Seeadler Harbor on 5 October and the following day, &quot;West Virginia&quot; became the flagship of Rear Admiral Theodore D. Ruddock, the commander of BatDiv 4.

==== Operations in the Philippines ====
===== Leyte =====
On 12 October 1944, &quot;West Virginia&quot; and the rest of the fleet sortied to begin the invasion of the Philippines, starting with the island of Leyte. &quot;West Virginia&quot; was assigned to Task Group (TG) 77.2, the shore bombardment force for the operation that was commanded by Rear Admiral Jesse B. Oldendorf. While en route later that day, &quot;West Virginia&quot; steamed astern of &quot;California&quot; and the latter vessel&#x27;s paravanes cut the anchor chain for a naval mine, forcing &quot;West Virginia&quot; to steer around it; gunfire from a nearby destroyer detonated the mine safely. The invasion fleet arrived in San Pedro Bay early on 19 October and at 07:00, &quot;West Virginia&quot; and the rest of TG 77.2 moved into their bombardment positions. They opened fire on targets around Tacloban, shelling Japanese positions and providing covering fire for the Underwater Demolition Teams that were preparing the invasion beaches for much of the day before withdrawing that evening. In the course of the day&#x27;s bombardment, she fired a total of 278 shells from her main battery and 1,586 rounds from her secondary guns.

The next morning, ground forces from Sixth Army went ashore and &quot;West Virginia&quot; remained on station throughout the day to provide naval gunfire support. The fleet came under Japanese air attack, though the ship&#x27;s anti-aircraft gunners were not able to shoot any aircraft down. On 21 October, while moving into her bombardment station, she lightly grounded, damaging three of her propellers. The damaged blades caused vibration that limited her speed to (or in emergencies). She nevertheless remained on station for the next two days to support the invasion as the soldiers fought their way inland, providing fire support and anti-aircraft defense as the fleet continued to be attacked by Japanese aircraft. Each night she and the rest of TG 77.2 withdrew from the beaches.

=====Battle of Leyte Gulf =====

The landing on Leyte led to the activation of Operation Shō-Gō 1, the Japanese navy&#x27;s planned riposte to an Allied landing in the Philippines. The plan was a complicated operation with three separate fleets: the Northern Force under Vice Admiral Jisaburō Ozawa, the Center Force under Vice Admiral Takeo Kurita, and the Southern Force under Vice Admiral Shōji Nishimura. Ozawa&#x27;s carriers, by now depleted of most of their aircraft, were to serve as a decoy for Kurita&#x27;s and Nishimura&#x27;s battleships, which were to use the distraction to attack the invasion fleet directly. Kurita&#x27;s ships were detected in the San Bernardino Strait on 24 October 1944, and in the ensuing Battle of the Sibuyan Sea, American carrier aircraft sank the powerful battleship , causing Kurita to temporarily reverse course. This convinced Admiral William F. Halsey, the commander of Third Fleet, to send the fast carrier task force to destroy the Northern Force, which had by then been detected. While these maneuvers were occurring, Nishumura&#x27;s force approached the Surigao Strait to attack the invasion fleet from the south. His fleet consisted of the battleships and , the heavy cruiser , and four destroyers, supplemented by Vice Admiral Kiyohide Shima&#x27;s Second Striking Force, consisting of the heavy cruisers and , the light cruiser , and four more destroyers.

As Nishimura&#x27;s flotilla passed through the strait on the night of 24 October, they came under attack from American PT boats, followed by destroyers, initiating the Battle of Surigao Strait. One of these US destroyers torpedoed &quot;Fusō&quot; and disabled her, though Nishimura continued on toward his objective. &quot;West Virginia&quot; steamed at the head of the American line. Observers aboard &quot;Tennessee&quot; spotted the flashes in the distance as the light American craft attacked Nishimura&#x27;s force, and at 03:02, her search radar picked up the enemy ships at a range of . &quot;West Virginia&quot;″s radar picked them up fourteen minutes later, by which time the range had fallen to . Oldendorf gave the order to open fire at 03:51, and &quot;West Virginia&quot; opened fire first a minute later, followed by &quot;Tennessee&quot; and &quot;California&quot;, concentrating their fire on &quot;Yamashiro&quot;; the other American battleships had trouble locating a target with their older, less-effective radars and held their fire. &quot;West Virginia&quot; probably hit &quot;Yamashiro&quot; on her bridge with her first salvo, though Nishimura and his staff were not injured at that time. &quot;Yamashiro&quot; was quickly hit several times by several American vessels that concentrated their fire on her. With &quot;Yamashiro&quot; badly damaged and burning furiously, the Americans then shifted fire to &quot;Mogami&quot;, which was also hit several times, suffering severe damage.

At about 04:00, &quot;Mogami&quot; and then &quot;Yamashiro&quot; turned to retreat, both burning; the destroyer fled with them, though she had not suffered any serious damage. Shortly thereafter, Oldendorf ordered his battleships to make a 150-degree turn, and &quot;West Virginia&quot; complied at 04:02, leading the other battleships on the new course, which ran parallel to &quot;Yamashiro&quot;″s line of retreat. Confusion aboard &quot;California&quot; led her to fall out of position, and in so doing, mask the rest of the battleships and force them to cease firing to avoid hitting her. Shortly thereafter, reports of Japanese torpedoes in the water prompted the American battleships to turn to the north at 04:18 to avoid them. This marked the end of the action, as the remaining Japanese ships retreated in the darkness. In the course of the action, &quot;West Virginia&quot; fired sixteen salvos at the Japanese ships; this proved to be the last ever battle between battleships.

=====Later operations=====

On 29 October 1944, &quot;West Virginia&quot;, &quot;Tennessee&quot;, and the battleship got underway, headed to the navy&#x27;s advance base at Ulithi. From there, &quot;West Virginia&quot; proceeded on to Espiritu Santo for repairs to her damaged propellers; Ruddock shifted his flag to &quot;Maryland&quot; during this period. On arriving, she entered the floating drydock for maintenance before returning to the Philippines in November. Steaming first to Manus and then to Leyte Gulf, she arrived on 25 November and resumed patrols in the area to defend the fleet from air attacks. On 27 November, the fleet came under another attack and at 11:39, her gunners shot down a kamikaze suicide aircraft. During further attacks the next day, she assisted in the destruction of several other kamikazes. Ruddock returned to the ship on 30 November, and the battleship remained in the area until 2 December, when she departed for the Palau Islands for replenishment. There, she became the flagship of TG 77.12, the bombardment group for the next landing in the Philippines.

The fleet passed through Leyte Gulf on 12 December, turning south through Surigao Strait the next day and entering the Sulu Sea for the assault on Mindoro in company with TG 78.3, the invasion transport force. After landing ground forces, the transports withdrew on 15 December and &quot;West Virginia&quot; was tasked with covering their departure. &quot;West Virginia&quot; refueled in Leyte Gulf and then continued on to the Kossol Roads in the Palaus, arriving on 19 December. She remained there for the rest of the year, and on 1 January 1945, Rear Admiral Ingram C. Sowell replaced Ruddock as the commander of BatDiv 4. That same day, she sortied as part of TG 77.2. After entering Leyte Gulf on 3 January, the ships steamed into the Sulu Sea, where they came under heavy Japanese air attack the next day; the escort carrier was badly damaged by kamikazes and was then scuttled; nearby destroyers took off the crew, some of whom were then transferred to &quot;West Virginia&quot;.

On 5 January, the fleet entered the South China Sea and then turned north toward Lingayen Gulf; further Japanese air attacks took place throughout the day and &quot;West Virginia&quot; contributed her guns to the fleet&#x27;s defense. While on the way, the ship closed with San Fernando Point and bombarded Japanese positions in the area. Waves of kamikazes struck the fleet and hit several ships but &quot;West Virginia&quot; avoided them. The next day, the minesweeper was sunk by a Japanese torpedo and &quot;West Virginia&quot; took on survivors from the vessel. Over the course of 8–9 January, the ship bombarded the town of San Fabian in Lingayen Gulf to prepare for the invasion that took place later on the 9th. That evening, the survivors from &quot;Ommaney Bay&quot; and &quot;Hovey&quot; departed &quot;West Virginia&quot;.

The ship continued her fire support mission on 10 January and then spent the next week patrolling Lingayen Gulf to protect the beachhead. During this period, she was called on to neutralize defensive positions, destroy ammunition dumps, and shell rail and road junctions to disrupt the Japanese ability to reinforce their positions. Heavy bombardment from &quot;West Virginia&quot; and the other ships flattened San Fabian. Over the course of the bombardment, she fired 395 main battery shells and more than 2,800 secondary shells. On 21 January, the ship departed at 07:07 to support ground forces fighting in the towns of Rosario and Santo Tomas to the north of Lingayen Gulf, opening fire at 08:15. She remained there for several days, providing fire support, before returning to Lingayen Gulf on 1 February. The ships of TG 77.2 thereafter covered transports carrying supplies for the Army as they arrived to unload their cargo at the beachhead. On 10 February, &quot;West Virginia&quot; departed for Leyte Gulf.

==== Battle of Iwo Jima ====

&quot;West Virginia&quot; passed through San Pedro Bay in Leyte Gulf before proceeding on to Ulithi, which she reached on 16 February 1945. There she joined Fifth Fleet and she immediately began preparations for the attack on Iwo Jima. She refueled and replenished supplies for the upcoming operation and was ready to depart at 04:00 the next morning; the ship got underway three and a half hours later, escorted by the destroyers and . On arriving off the island on 19 February, she joined Task Force (TF) 51, and at 11:25 she received orders to join the bombardment already underway as ground forces landed on the beach. She moved to her assigned station at 11:45 and opened fire an hour later; the marines fighting ashore directed her fire to target blockhouses, machine gun positions, tanks, and other Japanese positions.

The ship withdrew for the evening and returned two days later on 21 February, opening fire at 08:00 and remaining on station all day. During the bombardment, she hit an ammunition or fuel dump, setting off large, repeated explosions for the next two hours. She was hit by a small artillery shell the next day that struck near the forward superfiring turret and wounded one sailor. The ship remained off the island for the rest of the month as the marines fought to secure Iwo Jima from the tenacious Japanese defenders. On 27 February, she neutralized an artillery battery that had been firing on the destroyer . The battleship left the following day to replenish ammunition before returning later that day to resume the bombardment. She shelled targets throughout the night to harass the Japanese troops and interdict their movements. &quot;West Virginia&quot; continued to shell the island for the next three days before departing for Ulithi on 4 March; she arrived there two days later.

==== Battle of Okinawa ====
&quot;West Virginia&quot; then joined Task Force 54 (TF 54) for the next major amphibious assault in the Ryukyu Islands; the ships departed on 21 March 1945 and arrived off the island of Okinawa on 25 March. &quot;West Virginia&quot; moved to her assigned bombardment station and began to shell the planned landing zones. At 10:29 on 26 March, a single Japanese shell fell some off &quot;West Virginia&quot;″s port bow; she fired twenty-eight 16-inch shells in response. Intense Japanese air counterattacks began the next morning, and she shot down a Yokosuka P1Y twin-engined bomber that day. The ship remained off the island for the next few days, bombarding the landing beaches to prepare for the assault that was scheduled for 1 April. Before the attack began, the ship withdrew to replenish ammunition at Kerama Retto, which had been seized at the start of the campaign to provide an advance base for the invasion fleet.

The ship returned to the island early on 1 April to support the landings; while approaching Okinawa at 04:45, she had to reverse her engines to avoid colliding with a destroyer that inadvertently crossed her bow in the darkness. As she continued to steam to her assigned station, her anti-aircraft gunners spotted an enemy aircraft, which they shot down; shortly thereafter, a group of four more hostile aircraft appeared, one of which &quot;West Virginia&quot;″s guns destroyed. By 06:30, the ship had reached her station just from shore and began shelling the beach as the landing craft slowly made their way to the landing zone. The ship remained off the island throughout the day, though ground forces initially encountered little resistance and &quot;West Virginia&quot;″s guns were not immediately needed. That evening, however, a wave of kamikazes arrived and at 19:03, one of them crashed into &quot;West Virginia&quot;. The plane struck the ship&#x27;s superstructure just forward of the No. 2 director for the secondary battery. The resulting explosion killed four and wounded seven in one of the 20 mm gun batteries. The aircraft had been carrying a bomb that penetrated to the second deck, though it failed to detonate; it was later defused by the ship&#x27;s bomb disposal officer.

&quot;West Virginia&quot; nevertheless remained off the island through the night, firing star shells to illuminate marine positions to help repel Japanese infiltration attacks. The next day, the dead were buried at sea and the ship returned to bombardment duty shortly thereafter. On 6 April, her gunners shot down an Aichi D3A dive bomber. The next day, the Japanese Navy launched a last strike with a small squadron centered on the battleship , and &quot;West Virginia&quot; was sent to patrol to the west of the island to intercept any Japanese vessels that broke through heavy American air attacks. On 8 April, the ship received word that most of the Japanese vessels had been sunk or fled. &quot;West Virginia&quot; resumed bombardment operations and air defense of the fleet. She remained on station until 20 April, when she got underway for Ulithi; she did not reach her destination, however, as she was quickly recalled to replace her sister after the latter suffered an accidental explosion while replenishing ammunition. &quot;West Virginia&quot; briefly returned to Okinawa, operating off Hagushi Beach in support of XXIV Corps. She was then relieved and sailed to Ulithi with the heavy cruiser and the destroyer , arriving there on 28 April.

The ship then returned to Okinawa to resume fire support duties, which she carried out through June. During this period, on 1 and 2 June, she destroyed a Japanese blockhouse that had held up the American advance during a series of bombardments. On 16 June, having moved south to support the 1st Marine Regiment, one of the ship&#x27;s Kingfishers was shot down by Japanese fire. The pilot and observer both bailed out from the aircraft, but they fell behind Japanese lines and were pinned down. &quot;West Virginia&quot;, the destroyer , and a Landing Craft, Infantry attempted to suppress the Japanese defenses in the area so ground forces could break through and rescue the downed air crew, but the effort failed and the men were killed. The ship received another Kingfisher from &quot;Tennessee&quot;, allowing her to continue to support the forces ashore through the end of the month.

====End of the war====
At the end of June 1945, the ship left Okinawan waters for San Pedro Bay in company with the destroyer escort , arriving there on 1 July. Four days later, she received a group of replacement crewmen, and after loading ammunition there, began training in preparation for the expected invasion of Kyushu, the invasion of the Japanese mainland. These operations continued through July, and on 3 August she got underway for Okinawa, arriving in Buckner Bay on 6 August. That day, the first atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, and a second was dropped on Nagasaki three days later. After these two attacks, rumors spread on 10 August that the Japanese would surrender, prompting celebrations among the crews of the ships in Okinawa, though two days later the battleship was torpedoed by a Japanese submarine. &quot;West Virginia&quot; sent a whaleboat with pumps to assist the damaged battleship.

On 15 August, the Japanese surrendered, and &quot;West Virginia&quot;″s contingent of marines began preparations for the occupation of Japan. The ship departed on 24 August, headed for Tokyo Bay, assigned to TG 35.90, arriving there on 31 August. She was present during the formal surrender ceremonies aboard the battleship on 2 September, and &quot;West Virginia&quot; loaned five musicians from the ship&#x27;s band to play during the ceremony. &quot;West Virginia&quot; remained in Tokyo for the next two weeks to assist with the initial occupation effort, and on 14 September she took on a group of 270 passengers to be carried back to the United States. The ship got underway on 20 September with TG 30.4 for Okinawa; after a stop in Buckner Bay on 23 September, she continued on to Pearl Harbor, arriving there on 4 October. There, her crew repainted the ship before departing on 9 October for San Diego, California, which she reached on 22 October. Sowell left the ship two days later.

In the course of the war, &quot;West Virginia&quot; was awarded five battle stars, despite having missed much of the war due to the severe damage suffered at Pearl Harbor.

===Postwar===
During the Navy Day celebrations on 27 October 1945, some 25,554 people visited the ship. Three days later, she departed for Pearl Harbor to begin her role in Operation Magic Carpet, the repatriation effort to return American servicemen from the Pacific. She took on passengers in Pearl Harbor and carried them back to San Diego, making three runs through the end of the year, the last arriving in San Diego on 17 December. She remained in port until 4 January 1946, when she departed for Bremerton, arriving there on 12 January, where she was taken to be deactivated. She was moved to Seattle, Washington, four days later and tied up alongside &quot;Colorado&quot;. Further work to prepare her for the reserve fleet continued into February and she was formally decommissioned on 9 January 1947, assigned to the Pacific Reserve Fleet. &quot;West Virginia&quot; remained in the navy&#x27;s inventory until 1 March 1959, when she was struck from the Naval Vessel Register and placed for sale; she was sold on 24 August to the Union Minerals &amp; Alloys Corp. and towed to Todd-Pacific Shipyard in Seattle on 3 January 1961 to be broken up.

Several parts of the ship are preserved in locations throughout the United States, primarily in West Virginia. One of her anti-aircraft guns is on display in City Park in Parkersburg, West Virginia, and the ship&#x27;s wheel and binnacle are on display at the Hampton Roads Naval Museum. When the ship was sold for scrap, students at West Virginia University helped raise funds to preserve the ship&#x27;s mast, which is housed on the campus. The ship&#x27;s bell is on display at the West Virginia State Museum in Charleston. In 2000, governor Cecil Underwood issued a proclamation on the 59th anniversary of the Pearl Harbor attack naming Interstate 470 in West Virginia the USS &quot;West Virginia&quot; Memorial Highway.

<doc id="206084" wikidata="Q325740" url="?curid=206084" title="Terry Atkinson">
<text>Terry Atkinson (born 1939) is an English artist.
==Career==
Atkinson was born in Thurnscoe, near Barnsley, Yorkshire. He lives in Leamington Spa, England with his wife, artist Sue Atkinson, with whom he has frequently collaborated. In 1967, he began to teach art at the Coventry School of Art while producing conceptual works, sometimes in collaboration with Michael Baldwin. In 1968 they, together with Harold Hurrell and David Bainbridge who also taught at Coventry, formed Art &amp; Language, a group whose influence on other artists both in the UK and in the United States is widely acknowledged. Atkinson was founder-member (with colleagues John Bowstead, Roger Jeffs and Bernard Jennings) of the group Fine-Artz (1963), and (with David Bainbridge, Michael Baldwin and Harold Hurrell) of the group Art &amp; Language (1968–74), two of the most influential collectives in contemporary Western art.

Atkinson stopped teaching at Coventry in 1973 and the following year left Art &amp; Language. He has since exhibited under his own name, including at the 1984 Venice Biennale.

==Recognition and representation in collections==
In 1985 he was nominated for the Turner Prize and exhibited a series of paintings, including The Stone Touchers I.
Atkinson&#x27;s work is held in many collections, including the Tate Gallery.

<doc id="206087" wikidata="Q1524089" url="?curid=206087" title="Thomas Arundel">
<text>Thomas Arundel (1353 – 19 February 1414) was an English clergyman who served as Lord Chancellor and Archbishop of York during the reign of Richard II, as well as Archbishop of Canterbury in 1397 and from 1399 until his death, an outspoken opponent of the Lollards. He was instrumental in the usurpation of Richard by his cousin Henry Bolingbroke, who became Henry IV.

==Life==

===Early life and career===
Arundel was born, probably in Etchingham, Sussex, England, a younger son of Richard Fitzalan, 3rd Earl of Arundel and Eleanor of Lancaster. His elder brothers were Richard Fitzalan, 4th Earl of Arundel, who was executed for his opposition to Richard II, and John FitzAlan, 1st Baron Arundel, who drowned at sea in an expedition to aid the Duke of Brittany.

Arundel studied at Oriel College, Oxford, until papally provided as Bishop of Ely on 13 August 1373 entirely by reason of his father&#x27;s status and financial leverage with the Crown during the dotage of Edward III, and happily abandoning his student days at Oxford, from which he gained little pleasure. A hugely wealthy near-sinecure, Ely seems to have captured the young bishop&#x27;s genuine interest until his brother Richard&#x27;s political opposition to Richard II&#x27;s policies both at home and towards France grew rancorous and dragged him in. In an extremely grave crisis, teetering towards civil war during the years from 1386 through 1388, the bishop found himself, at least in formal terms, right at the front of the dangerous attempts by five leading temporal lords to purge the king&#x27;s advisors and control future policy.

On 3 April 1388, Arundel was elevated to the position of Archbishop of York at a time when Richard II was, in effect, suspended from rule. Given Ely&#x27;s wealth and ease, this promotion was clearly as much to do with status and consolidating the conspirators&#x27; control in the north as with remuneration.

Arundel served twice as Lord Chancellor during the reign of King Richard II, first from 1386 to 1389, and again from 1391 to 1396. Throughout his life Arundel was more trustful than was good for him, as shown by the king&#x27;s ability, after working his way astutely back into real authority, to assure Arundel of his confidence right until the &quot;counter-coup&quot; of 1397, when the archbishop was deceived into bringing his brother Richard out of hiding under a royal safe conduct—to his death. 

Despite his political preoccupations, which certainly led to him being largely absent from York, he has been credited with sponsoring a lively revival of personal religious piety in the northern province. Besides, as was to prove the case at Canterbury too, he was also a very good spotter of administrative talent.

===Archbishop of Canterbury===
On 25 September 1396, Arundel was made Archbishop of Canterbury. The king&#x27;s nomination seemed to wish him nothing but success. Yet, within a year, he was exiled by the king during Richard&#x27;s fierce counter-attack against his enemies of ten years earlier, and was replaced by Roger Walden.

Arundel spent his exile in Florence, where in 1398, at Richard II&#x27;s request, the Roman Pope Boniface IX translated him to become Bishop of St. Andrews, a cruel, empty fate because Scotland during the Western Schism recognised the pope in Avignon, already had a bishop in place and would probably never have accepted him anyway, even in peaceful times.

However, shortly afterwards, he joined up with his fellow exile Henry Bolingbroke. They invaded England together and forced Richard to yield the crown to Henry.
Arundel played a prominent part in the usurpation and may have been the most hawkishly determined of all that the king should be removed entirely: whether he actually lied under oath to Richard II to lure him out of Conwy Castle remains open to debate. The new regime secured the reversal of several of Richard&#x27;s acts, including the pope&#x27;s installation of Walden at Canterbury. Arundel returned to his primacy, while Walden—with the support of Arundel—was eventually translated to the important see of London.

As Henry IV collapsed into ill health from 1405, Arundel returned to the forefront of government. At one point, he even took the sick king into Lambeth Palace itself for care.

In 1405–06 he had to deal with the crisis with the papacy provoked by the king&#x27;s decision to execute the archbishop of York, Richard Scrope, who had participated in the Percy rebellion.
Formally, under Henry IV, Arundel served twice as Lord Chancellor, first in 1399 and again from 1407 to 1410. Following the accession of Henry V, Arundel&#x27;s influence at court decreased.

===Lollardy===
Arundel was a vehement opponent of the Lollards, the followers of John Wycliffe, who in his 1379 treatise &quot;De Eucharistia&quot; had opposed the dogma of Transubstantiation and whose theology of &quot;&quot; denied the legitimacy of any secular and clerical authorities concluded to be in mortal sin.

King Henry IV passed the &quot;De heretico comburendo&quot; statute in 1401, which recited in its preamble that it was directed against a certain new sect &quot;who thought damnably of the sacraments and usurped the office of preaching.&quot; It empowered the bishops to arrest, imprison, and examine offenders and to hand over to the secular authorities such as had relapsed or refused to abjure. The condemned were to be burnt &quot;in a high place&quot; before the people. 

This act was probably pushed through by the authoritative Arundel. Its passing was immediately followed by the burning of William Sawtrey, curate of St Margaret&#x27;s, Lynn. He had previously abjured but had relapsed, and he now refused to declare his belief in transubstantiation or to recognise the authority of the Church.

In 1407, Arundel presided at a synod at Oxford, which passed a number of constitutions to regulate preaching, the translation and use of the Scriptures, and the theological education at schools and the university. In 1410, a body of Oxford censors condemned 267 propositions collected out of Wycliffe&#x27;s writings. These different measures seem to have been successful at least as far as the clergy were concerned, and Lollardy came to be more and more a lay movement, often connected with political discontent.

The death penalty was seldom carried out. Until 1410, no further Lollards were executed. The 1414 Oldcastle Revolt saw a minority of the seventy or so who were hanged also burned. Thereafter, executions were again few until the Tudor period. 

Arundel had a stroke which left him unable to speak shortly afterwards. Henry V (his sister Joan&#x27;s grandson), who had had uneasy relations with Arundel, installed Henry Chichele in his place.

===Death and burial===
Arundel died on 19 February 1414, and was buried in Canterbury Cathedral. It has been suggested that the tomb originally designated for him during his lifetime had been given up to King Henry IV of England in the previous year, and that his own tomb was hastily built and was destroyed during the 17th century. Its remnants were discovered under the nave during archaeological excavations in the 1990s.

==Legacy==
In 2005/2006, &quot;BBC History Magazine&quot; chose Thomas Arundel as the 15th century&#x27;s entry for their Ten Worst Britons poll, in which he tied in ninth place with Hugh le Despenser. In &quot;Who Killed Chaucer?&quot; Terry Jones argued that Arundel was responsible for the death of Geoffrey Chaucer. Arundel appears as the antagonist in the 2014 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; audio drama &quot;The Doctor&#x27;s Tale&quot; played by John Banks.

<text>United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS) is an American multinational shipping &amp; receiving and supply chain management company founded in 1907 and headquartered in Sandy Springs, Georgia. Originally known as the American Messenger Company specializing in telegraphs, UPS has expanded to become a &quot;Fortune&quot; 500 company and one of the world&#x27;s largest shipping couriers. UPS today is primarily known for its ground shipping services as well as the UPS Store, a retail chain which assists UPS shipments and provides tools for small businesses. UPS offers air shipping on an overnight or two-day basis and delivers to post office boxes through UPS Mail Innovations and UPS SurePost.

UPS is the largest courier company in the world by revenue, with annual revenues around US$85 billion in 2020, ahead of competitors DHL and FedEx. UPS&#x27;s main international hub, UPS Worldport in Louisville, Kentucky, is the fifth busiest airport in the world by cargo traffic based on preliminary statistics from ACI, and the third busiest in the U.S. The company is one of the largest private employers in the United States.

==History==
===Foundation===
On August 28, 1907, James E. Casey founded the American Messenger Company with Claude Ryan in Seattle, Washington, capitalized with $100 in debt. Most deliveries at this time were made on foot and bicycles were used for longer trips.

The American Messenger Company focused primarily on package delivery to retail stores with special delivery mail delivered for its largest client, the United States Post Office Department -- the predecessor of today&#x27;s United States Postal Service. In 1913, the company acquired a Ford Model T as its first delivery vehicle. Casey and Ryan merged with a competitor, Evert McCabe, and formed Merchants Parcel Delivery. Consolidated delivery was also introduced, combining packages addressed to a certain neighborhood onto one delivery vehicle.

In 1916, Charlie Soderstrom joined Merchants Parcel Delivery bringing in more vehicles for the growing delivery business. In 1919, the company expanded for the first time outside of Seattle to Oakland, California, and changed its name to United Parcel Service.

The common carrier service was acquired in 1922 from a company in Los Angeles, California. UPS became one of the only companies in the United States to offer common carrier service. At first, common carrier was only limited to a small area around Los Angeles but by 1927 expanded to areas up to 125 miles outside the city. In 1924, a conveyor belt system was debuted for the handling of packages for UPS operations.

In 1930, a consolidated carrier service began in New York City; soon after, the company expanded its services to include other major cities in the East and the Midwest. The use of a common carrier for delivery between all customers placed UPS in direct competition with USPS, and delivering parcels beyond the California border brought it under the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission. The first city for UPS to use common carrier status outside California was Chicago, Illinois, in 1953.

Air service through UPS was first used in 1929 through private airlines. However, the Great Depression and a lack of volume ended the service. In 1953, UPS resumed air service called UPS Blue Label Air with two-day service to major cities along the East Coast and West Coast.

===Bomb explosion===
Shortly before 3:00 a.m, on the morning of December 5, 1974, a package bomb exploded at UPS&#x27;s Northside center on Beaver Avenue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, killing one man and injuring 10 others. The murder case was initially investigated by Robert Coll, Assistant Superintendent of City Detectives, and later the FBI. The package originated in Erie, Pennsylvania and its destination was the Spectrum Cycle Shop, Forks Church, Armstrong Co. UPS claimed no liability in the incident, and the case has yet to be solved. 

===Expansion and diversification===
In 1975, UPS moved its headquarters to Greenwich, Connecticut, and began serving all of the 48 contiguous states of the United States. This expansion of operations made UPS the first package delivery company to serve every address in the contiguous United States. Additionally in 1975, UPS went international by establishing operations in Canada. In 1976, UPS established a domestic operation in West Germany.

UPS Next Day Air Service was launched in 1985 for all 48 contiguous states plus Puerto Rico. In 1988, UPS Airlines was launched with authorization from the Federal Aviation Administration and became the fastest-growing airline in FAA history – currently the 10th largest airline in the United States. Domestic air service was added to Germany in 1989. In 1991, UPS relocated its headquarters to Sandy Springs, Georgia, a suburb of Atlanta. Following this in 1992, UPS acquired both Haulfast and Carryfast and rebranded them into UPS Supply Chain Solutions. Haulfast provided the pallet haulage and trucking network for the CarryFast group of companies. By 1993, UPS was delivering up to 11.5 million packages and documents per day.

In order for the company to service the large volume of customers in 1991, UPS developed technologies to improve efficiency. A handheld device named the &quot;Delivery Information Acquisition Device&quot; (DIAD) was created to record and upload delivery information to the UPS network immediately upon pickup by every UPS driver. In 1992, UPS began tracking all ground shipments electronically. In 1994, UPS.com debuted, and provided an interface to make what was primarily internal operational information available for customer access. After 27 years of providing this information, UPS chose to hide it again for most packages in 2021 and this information is no longer available on their consumer facing website.

In 1995, UPS acquired SonicAir to offer service parts logistics and compete with Choice Logistics. In the same year, UPS launched the UPS Logistics Group to facilitate global supply chain management services and consulting for customer needs. In 1997, a walkout by the 185,000 members of the Teamsters shut down UPS for 16 days. In 1998, UPS Capital was established to enable companies to grow their business through a comprehensive menu of integrated financial services through UPS. UPS acquired Challenge Air in 1999 to expand its operations in Latin America.

On November 10, 1999, UPS became a public company in the largest initial public offering of the 20th century.

===21st century===
In 2001, UPS acquired Mail Boxes Etc., Inc., a franchised network of packing and shipping retail centers across the United States and Canada. In 2003, the company rebranded the Mail Boxes, Etc. network as The UPS Store.

In 2004, UPS entered the heavy freight business with the purchase of Menlo Worldwide Forwarding, a former subsidiary of Menlo Worldwide; UPS rebranded it as UPS Supply Chain Solutions. The purchase price was US$150 million and the assumption of US$110 million in long-term debt.

On August 5, 2005, UPS announced that it has completed its acquisition of less-than-truckload (LTL) trucking company Overnite Transportation for US$1.25 billion. This was approved by the FTC and Overnite shareholders on August 4, 2005. On April 28, 2006, Overnite officially became UPS Freight.

In 2005, UPS offered non-stop delivery service between Guangzhou and the United States. On October 3, 2005, UPS completed the purchase of Lynx Express, one of the largest independent parcel carriers in the United Kingdom, for £55.5 million (US$97.1 million) after receiving approval for the transaction from the European Commission. The first joint package car center operation in Dartford, Kent, was opened in 2006.

On August 28, 2007, United Parcel Service celebrated its 100th anniversary. All Nippon Airways, a Star Alliance member, and UPS formed a cargo alliance and codeshare agreement to transport member cargo in 2008, similarly to an airline alliance.

On March 19, 2012, UPS announced that it intended to acquire TNT Express for $6.8 billion, in a move to help expand its presence in European and Asian markets. However, the deal fell through in January 2013, after it was announced that UPS had failed to obtain permission from the European Commission and as such had been blocked on competition grounds.

In February 2012, UPS acquired Brussels-based company Kiala that provides e-commerce retailers the option to have goods delivered to a conventional retail location.

In 2018, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported that UPS&#x27;s operations were hampered by its outdated 20th-century technology, lagging behind its competitors.

In May 2019, UPS launched a partnership with autonomous trucking startup TuSimple to carry cargo across Phoenix, Arizona, and Tucson, Arizona.

In October 2019, UPS won the approval of the Federal Aviation Administration to fly drones. The certification will allow UPS to deliver health care supplies using a fleet of drones.

On January 29, 2020, UPS announced it was investing in UK start-up Arrival and ordering 10,000 Generation 2 electric vehicles as a step towards a cleaner, more high-tech fleet. The deal runs from 2020 until 2024 and was reported to be worth more than $400 million.

In March 2020, the company has appointed Carol Tomé to succeed David Abney as its chief executive officer. It was viewed as a move to steer the parcel delivery company through the turbulence of trade wars, technological disruption and the risk of a pandemic-induced recession.

In March 2020, UPS expands its autonomous trips with TuSimple by adding an extra route between Phoenix and El Paso, Texas.

In January 2021, UPS announced it had agreed to sell UPS Freight, its less-than-truckload freight business, to TFI International, a Canadian transport and logistics company, for $800 million. UPS said the move would allow it to focus on small-package delivery. At the time of the sale, UPS Freight had about 14,500 employees, approximately 11,000 of them represented by the Teamsters union, and generated an estimated $3.15 billion in revenue in 2020 offering services across the US, Canada, and Mexico. TFI had reported $4.1 billion in revenue in 2019 and already operated truckload and LTL services in Canada. The acquisition was completed in April and UPS Freight was renamed TForce Freight.

In 2021, following the company&#x27;s shift to target smaller customers to boost profits during the COVID-19 pandemic, UPS reported a 21% jump in their fourth quarter sales to $24.9 billion. CEO Carol Tomé reported that Amazon paid UPS $11.3 billion in shipping in 2020, accounting for 13.3% of the company&#x27;s revenue.

In September 2021, UPS entered into an agreement to acquire Roadie for an undisclosed amount with the transaction expected to be closed in the fourth quarter.

In May 2022, UPS acquired logistics company Delivery Solutions, a key partner for Walmart&#x27;s GoLocal network.

In November 2022, it was announced UPS had acquired the healthcare focused, Europe-based warehousing and temperature-controlled transport company, Bomi Group.

In September 2023, it was announced UPS had acquired the Long Beach, California-headquartered time-critical, health care logistics company, MNX for an undisclosed amount.

In October 2023, it was announced UPS had acquired the Los Angeles-headquartered reverse logistics company, Happy Returns from PayPal for an undisclosed amount.

In January 2024, UPS announced that it planned to cut 12,000 jobs and mandate that staff return to the office five days a week. Chief Executive Carol Tomé blamed the move on a &quot;difficult and disappointing year&quot; in 2023.

In July 2024, UPS announced that it had entered in to an agreement to acquire Mexican logistics company Estafeta Mexicana. It is expected to be finalized by the end of the year.

==Operations==
UPS&#x27;s primary business is the time-definite delivery of packages and documents worldwide. In recent years, UPS extended its service portfolio to include UPS Healthcare.

UPS reports its operations in three segments:

* U.S. Domestic Package operations,

* Supply Chain &amp; Freight operations.

===United States domestic shipping===
UPS services for consumers include:

* UPS Ground for day-definite delivery. Can take up to 5 days.

===Personnel structure===
In 2016, UPS employed approximately 444,000 staff: 362,000 in the U.S. and 82,000 internationally. In 2023, approximately 330,000 UPS drivers, package handlers, and clerks are represented by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters with more than 50% of those being part-time workers. In 2023, the average UPS full-time package delivery worker with more than four years experience was paid $95,000 per year.

During the United Parcel Service strike of 1997, the company&#x27;s only nationwide strike in its history, which lasted 16 days, Teamster President Ron Carey negotiated a new contract for workers. In July 2023, before their contract was set to expire, a strike was threatened over union demands of increases in wages, benefits, and air conditioning in delivery vans. A 10-day strike would have been the largest single-employer strike in US history and would have cost the US economy more than $7 billion. The strike was called off after UPS agreed to increase starting pay for part-time workers to $21 per hour, in addition to other concessions.
UPS had previously announced the non-economic portions of the agreement had been settled, including to equip new delivery vans with air conditioning starting January 2024 combined with retrofitting existing vehicles with 2 fans, additional ventilation of the cargo area and shielding to reduce heat from the exhaust being transmitted to the cargo area of delivery vehicles. All tractor trailers are already equipped with AC.

==Competitors==
Major competitors in the United States include the United States Postal Service (USPS) and FedEx, along with regional carriers such as OnTrac, and LSO (formerly Lonestar Overnight). In addition to these domestic carriers, UPS competes with a variety of international operators, including SF Express, Canada Post (and its subsidiary Purolator), TransForce, Deutsche Post (and its subsidiary DHL), Royal Mail, Japan Post Service, and many other regional carriers, national postal services and air cargo handlers (see Package delivery and Mail pages).

Historically, the bulk of competition for UPS came from inexpensive ground-based delivery services, such as Parcel Post (USPS) or Choice Logistics. In 1998, FedEx expanded into ground parcel delivery through its acquisition of RPS (formerly Roadway Package System), rebranding it as FedEx Ground in 2000. In 2003, DHL acquired Airborne Express, expanding its operations in the United States.

In response to the expansion of FedEx and DHL, UPS partnered with the US Postal Service to offer UPS Mail Innovations, a program that allows UPS to pick up mail and packages weighing under one pound separately from the main ground network and transfer them to a USPS center, or destination delivery unit (DDU), for final distribution. This process is also known as zone skipping, long used by parcel consolidators. UPS also has a separate product called &quot;SurePost&quot; which uses the UPS Ground network to deliver packages weighing under 10 pounds to the nearest UPS Package Center, which transfers them to the USPS DDU for &quot;final mile&quot; delivery.

More recently, the continued growth of online shopping, combined with increasing awareness of the role of transportation (including package delivery) on the environment, has contributed to the rise of emerging competition from niche carriers or rebranded incumbents. For instance, the US Postal Service claims &quot;greener delivery&quot; of parcels on the assumption that USPS letter carriers deliver to each US address, six days a week anyway, and therefore offer the industry&#x27;s lowest fuel consumption per delivery. Other carriers, like ParcelPool.com, which specializes in residential package delivery to APO/FPO addresses, Hawaii, Alaska, Puerto Rico, and other US Territories, arose in response to increased demand from catalog retailers and online e-tailers for low-cost residential delivery services closely matching service standards normally associated with more expensive expedited parcel delivery.

In 2019, UPS sued in an attempt to force USPS to raise their prices, but was rejected by the Supreme Court.

==Transportation==
UPS operates over 119,000 delivery vehicles worldwide, ranging from bicycles to tractor-trailer trucks. In a long-running company policy to avoid advertisement or endorsement of a vehicle manufacturer, all external manufacturer emblems and badging are removed when a vehicle enters service (whenever possible).

The typical lifespan of a UPS ground vehicle is 20–25 years (or more), lasting until the structural integrity is compromised. The company does not re-sell any of its ground vehicles. As such, retired vehicles are almost always stripped of reusable parts before being sent to be crushed/broken up. Prior to scrapping, UPS trucks and trailers have all company branding painted over and are assigned an ADA (Automotive Destruction Authorization) number and must be crushed under the supervision of UPS Automotive personnel, which records the vehicle&#x27;s destruction. The only exception to this policy are vehicles taken off the road for internal company use; package cars (repainted white) are used for various purposes (typically at large hubs); older semi tractors sometimes see use as terminal tractors.

===Delivery vans===
UPS refers to its delivery van as a &quot;package car&quot;. Several designs and sizes are used by the company, dependent on routes and package volume; the distinct design of the rounded &quot;bubble-nose&quot; front hood and upper roofline was introduced in 1965. The bodies of the package cars are manufactured by Morgan Olson (Grumman Olson), Union City Body, and Utilimaster; while older vehicles were based on Ford or General Motors P-chassis, vehicles manufactured in the 21st century use Freightliner or Workhorse chassis.

Until the end of the 20th century, UPS delivery vehicles were equipped with manual transmissions and steering, with automatic transmissions and power steering adopted by newer vehicles.

For lower-volume delivery routes, UPS utilizes production-based vehicles, including minivans (including the Ford Transit Connect or the Ford Transit, and Dodge Grand Caravan C/V) and Mercedes-Benz (Dodge/Freightliner) Sprinter box vans. UPS has ordered Modec electric vans for its UK and German fleets. Energy costs play a huge part in the potential profitability of package delivery companies.
Most UPS Ground vehicles have no air conditioning, with the exception of tractor-trailers. This has been considered to be a contributing factor to heatstroke and other heat-related health problems in drivers who work in these vehicles for the entire shift. Modern vehicles have improved ventilation systems.

On January 29, 2020, UPS invested in Arrival and ordered 10,000 Generation 2 Electric Vehicles.

===Bicycles===
In 2008, UPS started hiring bicycle delivery personnel in Vancouver, Washington, and in several cities in Oregon (Portland, Salem, Corvallis, Eugene, and Medford). In fall of 2018, UPS announced a new program in Seattle, Washington using pedal-assist electric cargo bikes (made by Portland-based Truck Trike) around Pike Place and other congested downtown areas. In Amsterdam UPS also uses Urban Arrow delivery bicycles for delivery via a granted concession.
=== Cargo airline ===

The fourth-largest cargo airline worldwide, UPS Airlines flies to over 800 destinations worldwide (the most of any airline, cargo or passenger). Formed in 1988, the airline is headquartered in Louisville, Kentucky (home to Worldport, its worldwide air hub) with additional hubs in the United States located in Ontario, California, Dallas, Texas, Rockford, Illinois and Philadelphia. Outside of North America, a hub in Cologne, Germany services Europe; in Asia, UPS Airlines operates a facility in Hong Kong and two hubs in mainland China.

Consisting of a fleet of over 260 aircraft, the airline competes directly against FedEx Express, facilitating air shipments by the company in over 200 countries and territories worldwide.

=== Cargo drone airline ===

UPS Flight Forward is a subsidiary which was formed in July 2019 and approved by FAA for Part 135 Standard certification, first ever to receive this specific type of certification. The FAA&#x27;s Part 135 Standard certification allows company to operate an unlimited number of drones of any size (even allowing the cargo to exceed 55 pounds) even with an unlimited number of remote operators in command.

==Company brand==
===Brown===
The brown color that UPS uses on its vehicles and uniforms is called &quot;Pullman brown&quot;. Company founder James E. Casey originally wanted company vehicles to use a yellow paint scheme, but one of his partners, Charlie Soderstrom, stated that a yellow vehicle would be hard to keep clean and that Pullman railroad cars were brown for just that reason.

During the 2000s, the company used the familiarity of its color scheme in an advertising slogan: &quot;What can Brown do for you?&quot;

===Font===
UPS commissioned brand consultancy FutureBrand to develop its own font, &quot;UPS Sans&quot;, for use in marketing and communication material. &quot;UPS Sans&quot; was created by slightly altering certain parts of FSI FontShop International&#x27;s font &quot;FF Dax&quot; without permission. This has resulted in an agreement between FSI FontShop International and FutureBrand to avoid litigation.

===Reputation===

UPS has been criticized for its treatment of its workforce, including providing inadequate protections and sick leave during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The company has also been subject to perennial criticism for damaged, late, or otherwise mishandled packages.

Safe streets activists have attacked UPS, along with other parcel delivery services, for frequently illegally parking their vehicles in bike lanes while making deliveries, a practice that endangers cyclists. They were sued over it in New York in 2015, and criticized alongside peers in a letter from Washington, D.C.&#x27;s transportation agency in 2018.

==Environmental record==
As of 2013, UPS has over 104,900 vehicles in operation worldwide including nearly 7,000 alternative fuel vehicles. In May 2008, UPS placed an order for 200 hybrid electric vehicles (adding to the 50 it had at that point) and 300 compressed natural gas (which are 20% more fuel efficient, and add to the 800 it already has) vehicles from Daimler Trucks North America. The company added 200 hybrid electric vehicles to its fleet in 2016.

UPS received a &quot;striding&quot; rating of 80 points out of 100 totals on the environmental scorecard by the Climate Counts Group for its efforts to lessen the company&#x27;s impact on the environment. UPS has also been awarded the Clean Air Excellence Award by the United States Environmental Protection Agency because of the alternative fuel program it has developed. A few years later, the Environmental Protection Agency fined the UPS for not following environmental laws.

In October 2009, UPS became the first small-package carrier to offer customers the chance to buy carbon offsets to neutralize the greenhouse gas emissions generated by the transport of their packages. Although initially only available on ups.com and to high-volume shippers, they are now widely available through UPS shipping systems and UPS Ready third-party shipping systems.

===Carbon footprint===
UPS reported Total CO2e emissions (Direct + Indirect) for the twelve months ending December 31, 2020, at 16,500 Kt (+1,546/+10% y-o-y). UPS aims to reach net zero emissions by 2050.

<text>In fluid dynamics, Stokes&#x27; law gives the frictional force – also called drag force – exerted on spherical objects moving at very small Reynolds numbers in a viscous fluid. It was derived by George Gabriel Stokes in 1851 by solving the Stokes flow limit for small Reynolds numbers of the Navier–Stokes equations.

==Statement of the law==
The force of viscosity on a small sphere moving through a viscous fluid is given by:
:formula_1

where (in SI units):
* formula_2 is the frictional force – known as Stokes&#x27; drag – acting on the interface between the fluid and the particle (newtons, kg m s−2);
* (some authors use the symbol ) is the dynamic viscosity (Pascal-seconds, kg m−1 s−1);
* is the radius of the spherical object (meters);
* formula_3 is the flow velocity relative to the object (meters per second). Note the minus sign in the equation, the drag force points in the opposite direction to the relative velocity: drag opposes the motion.

Stokes&#x27; law makes the following assumptions for the behavior of a particle in a fluid:
*Laminar flow
*No inertial effects (zero Reynolds number)
*Spherical particles
*Homogeneous (uniform in composition) material
*Smooth surfaces
*Particles do not interfere with each other.

Depending on desired accuracy, the failure to meet these assumptions may or may not require the use of a more complicated model. To 10% error, for instance, velocities need be limited to those giving Re &lt; 1.

For molecules Stokes&#x27; law is used to define their Stokes radius and diameter.

The CGS unit of kinematic viscosity was named &quot;stokes&quot; after his work.

==Applications==

Stokes&#x27; law is the basis of the falling-sphere viscometer, in which the fluid is stationary in a vertical glass tube. A sphere of known size and density is allowed to descend through the liquid. If correctly selected, it reaches terminal velocity, which can be measured by the time it takes to pass two marks on the tube. Electronic sensing can be used for opaque fluids. Knowing the terminal velocity, the size and density of the sphere, and the density of the liquid, Stokes&#x27; law can be used to calculate the viscosity of the fluid. A series of steel ball bearings of different diameters are normally used in the classic experiment to improve the accuracy of the calculation. The school experiment uses glycerine or golden syrup as the fluid, and the technique is used industrially to check the viscosity of fluids used in processes. Several school experiments often involve varying the temperature and/or concentration of the substances used in order to demonstrate the effects this has on the viscosity. Industrial methods include many different oils, and polymer liquids such as solutions.

The importance of Stokes&#x27; law is illustrated by the fact that it played a critical role in the research leading to at least three Nobel Prizes.

Stokes&#x27; law is important for understanding the swimming of microorganisms and sperm; also, the sedimentation of small particles and organisms in water, under the force of gravity.

In air, the same theory can be used to explain why small water droplets (or ice crystals) can remain suspended in air (as clouds) until they grow to a critical size and start falling as rain (or snow and hail). Similar use of the equation can be made in the settling of fine particles in water or other fluids.

=== Terminal velocity of sphere falling in a fluid ===
At terminal (or settling) velocity, the excess force due to the difference between the weight and buoyancy of the sphere (both caused by gravity) is given by:

:formula_4

where (in SI units):
* is the mass density of the sphere [kg/m3]
* is the mass density of the fluid [kg/m3]
* is the gravitational acceleration [m/s]
Requiring the force balance and solving for the velocity gives the terminal velocity . Note that since the excess force increases as and Stokes&#x27; drag increases as , the terminal velocity increases as and thus varies greatly with particle size as shown below. If a particle only experiences its own weight while falling in a viscous fluid, then a terminal velocity is reached when the sum of the frictional and the buoyant forces on the particle due to the fluid exactly balances the gravitational force. This velocity [m/s] is given by:

:formula_5

where (in SI units):
* is the gravitational field strength [m/s2]
* is the radius of the spherical particle [m]
* is the mass density of the particle [kg/m3]
* is the mass density of the fluid [kg/m3]
* is the dynamic viscosity [kg/(m•s)].

==Derivation ==
===Steady Stokes flow===

In Stokes flow, at very low Reynolds number, the convective acceleration terms in the Navier–Stokes equations are neglected. Then the flow equations become, for an incompressible steady flow:

:formula_6
where:
* is the fluid pressure (in Pa),
* is the flow velocity (in m/s), and
* is the vorticity (in s−1), defined as  formula_7

By using some vector calculus identities, these equations can be shown to result in Laplace&#x27;s equations for the pressure and each of the components of the vorticity vector:

:formula_8   and   formula_9

Additional forces like those by gravity and buoyancy have not been taken into account, but can easily be added since the above equations are linear, so linear superposition of solutions and associated forces can be applied.

===Transversal flow around a sphere===

For the case of a sphere in a uniform far field flow, it is advantageous to use a cylindrical coordinate system . The –axis is through the centre of the sphere and aligned with the mean flow direction, while is the radius as measured perpendicular to the –axis. The origin is at the sphere centre. Because the flow is axisymmetric around the –axis, it is independent of the azimuth .

In this cylindrical coordinate system, the incompressible flow can be described with a Stokes stream function , depending on and :

:formula_10

with and the flow velocity components in the and direction, respectively. The azimuthal velocity component in the –direction is equal to zero, in this axisymmetric case. The volume flux, through a tube bounded by a surface of some constant value , is equal to and is constant.

For this case of an axisymmetric flow, the only non-zero component of the vorticity vector is the azimuthal –component 

:formula_11

The Laplace operator, applied to the vorticity , becomes in this cylindrical coordinate system with axisymmetry:

:formula_12

From the previous two equations, and with the appropriate boundary conditions, for a far-field uniform-flow velocity in the –direction and a sphere of radius , the solution is found to be

:formula_13

The solution of velocity in cylindrical coordinates and components follows as:

:formula_14


The solution of vorticity in cylindrical coordinates follows as:

:formula_15

The solution of pressure in cylindrical coordinates follows as: 

:formula_16

The solution of pressure in spherical coordinates follows as: 

:formula_17

The formula of pressure is also called &quot;dipole potential&quot; analogous to the concept in electrostatics. 

A more general formulation, with arbitrary far-field velocity-vector formula_18, in cartesian coordinates formula_19 follows with:
formula_20

:formula_21

:formula_22

In this formulation the non-conservative term represents a kind of so-called Stokeslet. The Stokeslet is the Green&#x27;s function of the Stokes-Flow-Equations. The conservative term is equal to the dipole gradient field. The formula of vorticity is analogous to the Biot–Savart law in electromagnetism.

Alternatively, in a more compact way, one can formulate the velocity field as follows: 

:formula_23, 

where formula_24 is the Hessian matrix differential operator and formula_25 is a differential operator composed as the difference of the Laplacian and the Hessian. In this way it becomes explicitly clear, that the solution is composed from derivatives of a Coulomb-type potential (formula_26) and a Biharmonic-type potential (formula_27). The differential operator formula_28 applied to the vector norm formula_27 generates the Stokeslet. 

The following formula describes the viscous stress tensor for the special case of Stokes flow. It is needed in the calculation of the force acting on the particle. In Cartesian coordinates the vector-gradient formula_30 is identical to the Jacobian matrix. The matrix represents the identity-matrix. 

:formula_31

The force acting on the sphere can be calculated via the integral of the stress tensor over the surface of the sphere, where represents the radial unit-vector of spherical-coordinates:

:formula_32

=== Rotational flow around a sphere ===
:formula_33

==Other types of Stokes flow==

Although the liquid is static and the sphere is moving with a certain velocity, with respect to the frame of sphere, the sphere is at rest and liquid is flowing in the opposite direction to the motion of the sphere.

<text>Package delivery, or parcel delivery, is the delivery of shipping containers, parcels, or high-value mail as single shipments. The service is provided by most postal systems, express mail, private courier companies, and less-than-truckload shipping carriers. Package delivery differs by country due to cost and population. In 2019, for example, China, the United States, and Japan were the top countries in terms of package delivery volume while Latvia, Macau, and Iceland ranked at the bottom. This can be explained in part by the population of the bottom three nations totaling 2 million while the top three represent a population of almost 2 billion.

==Mail order and next-day delivery in the United Kingdom==
Welsh entrepreneur Pryce Pryce-Jones formed the first mail order company in 1861. He distributed catalogues of Welsh flannel across the United Kingdom, with customers able to order by mail for the first time—this following the Uniform Penny Post in 1840 and the invention of the postage stamp (Penny Black) where there was a charge of one penny for carriage and delivery between any two places in the United Kingdom irrespective of distance—and the goods were delivered throughout the UK via the newly created railway system. Pryce-Jones promised next-day delivery throughout much of the country.

==Package delivery in the United States==
In 1852, Wells Fargo, the first of such services, was formed to provide both banking and express services. These went hand-in-hand, as the handling of California gold and other financial matters required a secure method for transporting them across the country. This put Wells Fargo securely in the stagecoach business and prompted them to participate in the Pony Express venture. They were preceded, among others, by the Butterfield Overland Stage, but the failure of the latter put the business in Wells Fargo&#x27;s hands and led to a monopoly on overland traffic that lasted until 1869 when the transcontinental rail line was completed. During this period they carried regular mail in addition to the package business, defying the post office monopoly; eventually, a compromise was worked out wherein Wells Fargo charged its own fee on top of federal postage, in recognition of the limitations of the post office reaching all areas easily.

From 1869 on, package services rapidly moved to the rail, which was faster and cheaper. The express office was a universal feature of the staffed railroad station. Packages travelled as &quot;head-end&quot; traffic in passenger trains. In 1918 the formation of the United States Railroad Administration resulted in a consolidation of all such services into a single agency, which after the war continued as the Railway Express Agency (REA).
On 1 January 1913, parcel post service began, providing rural postal customers with package service along with their regular mail and obviating a trip to a town substantial enough to support an express office. This, along with Rural Free Delivery, fueled a huge rise in catalogue sales. By this time the post office monopoly on mail was effectively enforced, and Wells Fargo had exited the business in favour of its banking enterprises.

Motor freight services arose quickly with the advent of gasoline and diesel-powered trucks. United Parcel Service had its origins in this era, initially as a private courier service. The general improvement of the highway system following World War II prompted its expansion into a nationwide service, and other similar services arose. At the same time, the contraction of rail passenger service hurt rail-based package shipping; these contractions led to the cancellation of the mail contracts with the railroads, which in turn caused further passenger cuts. Eventually, REA was dissolved in bankruptcy in 1975.

Air mail was conceived early, and scheduled service began in 1918. Scheduled airlines carried high valued and perishable goods from early on. The most important advance, however, came with the &quot;hub and spoke&quot; system pioneered by Federal Express (now known as FedEx) in 1973. With deregulation in 1977, they were able to establish an air-based system capable of delivering small packages—including mail—overnight throughout most of the country. In response, the postal service initiated a comparable Express Mail service. In the same period, they also began contracting with Amtrak to carry mail by rail. Thus at the beginning of the 21st century, the U.S. consumer can choose from a variety of public and private services offering deliveries at various combinations of speed and cost.

By 2018, parcel carriers are hauling 14% of U.S. goods, up from 10% 25 years ago, and FedEx’s US domestic volume increased 4.9% in 2018, while UPS reported a 3.3% increase and a 5.6% increase in domestic next-day air package.

===Same-day delivery===
Same-day delivery for local parcels (such as documents) has long been available by local courier. Rail and air transport made same-day delivery feasible over longer distances; for example, packages shipped in the early morning can be delivered (at relatively high cost) anywhere in the mainland United States. Retail goods were seldom sold with shipping any faster than overnight.

Some online grocers such as AmazonFresh and Webvan, and delivery services operated by grocery stores like Peapod and Safeway have had same-day or next-day delivery windows. Many restaurants have long delivered takeout locally on-demand, and online food ordering services have expanded this to many restaurants that would otherwise not deliver.

In the 2010s, various experimental services launched, using online shopping and retail warehouses or chain stores local to the ordering consumer for fulfillment at relatively low cost. The United States Postal Service &quot;Metro Post&quot; started in 2012, which by 2014 was shipping Amazon orders to 15 cities. In 2013, Walmart was delivering same-day packages from its own stores in test cities via UPS.

Kozmo.com started a general one-hour local delivery service for small items in 1998, but failed in 2001. Same-day retail service Postmates began in 2011, and Google Express began in 2013 with a limited number of vendors and cities. By September 2015, Amazon Prime Now (which includes selected goods including some groceries) offered 1-hour delivery in 13 cities,
and the company launched Amazon Flex, which is a service similar to Postmates using part-time workers to deliver Amazon Prime Now packages.

Some vehicle for hire companies offer courier service and delivery of items ordered online from local vendors. Startups with similar services include Doorman in San Francisco, Chicago, and New York City, Deliv in San Francisco, WeDeliver in Chicago, and Shutl in Manhattan and Chicago.

An alternative to same-day delivery is in-store pickup, which has been adopted even by previously online-only retailers like Amazon.

===Regional parcel carriers===

In addition, a number of regional parcel delivery companies have sprung up since the 1990s. They combine the track and trace capability of the national carriers with the ability to guarantee next day delivery at ground rates over a larger delivery footprint. Because they are regionally based, they are able to improve shipment time in transit and increase shippers productivity with later pick up times. The regional parcel carriers can be a cost-effective enhancement to UPS and FedEx because they do not charge the full array of accessorial charges mentioned in the section above.

===Heavy goods delivery===
Delivery of heavy goods, such as furniture or large appliances, requires a different logistical process than most small parcel couriers. For example, the supply chain of shipping large household goods from their manufacturers, to residential or business locations throughout the country and world is more complex and carries with it a higher potential for damage and error than with smaller packages.

Specialized less than truckload shipping carriers handle shipping furniture and other heavy goods from the manufacturer to a last mile hub. The last mile problem can also include the challenge of making deliveries in urban areas. Deliveries to retail stores, restaurants, and other merchants in a central business district often contribute to congestion and safety problems. Once the goods arrive at the last mile hub, which is typically located less than 200 miles from the final delivery location, a dedicated last-mile carrier, also known as a white glove delivery company, will handle the final leg of the delivery.

White glove refers to the highest service level for last-mile delivery of heavy goods. It involves the delivery team bringing the item to the room of choice, unpacking and assembling it, and removing all packaging and debris from the customer&#x27;s home. There are over 4,000 white glove delivery companies in the United States, most of which only perform local deliveries. Some large less-than-truckload shipping carriers also offer white glove delivery service, and in recent years start-ups have emerged that offer nationwide networks of white glove delivery coverage. With the growth of E-commerce websites that sell heavy goods throughout the country and world the white glove delivery marketplace is shifting from mostly regional carriers working with local brick and mortar stores to E-commerce websites working with national delivery networks.

==Package design for distribution==

The individual sorting and handling systems of small parcel carriers can put severe stress on the packages and contents. Packaging needs to be designed for the potential hazards which may be encountered in parcel delivery systems. The major carriers have a packaging engineering staff which provides packaging guidelines and sometimes package design and package testing services. Many e-retailers have specific packaging requirements for their suppliers and also offer assistance in package design.

When shopping retail order from a warehouse, such as for online shopping, multiple items are often placed in a single box (secondary packaging) for cheaper and easier transportation and tracking. This creates waste when there is only a single item that could be transported without an outer box (for example something that already has durable retail primary packaging). To avoid this problem, some items are designated in the industry as &quot;ships in own container (SIOC)&quot; and will receive only a shipping label. Some products are specifically designed as SIOC for environmental or cost reasons.

Package testing procedures include:
*ASTM International D7386- Standard Practice for Performance Testing of Packages for Single Parcel Delivery Systems.

*International Safe Transit Association
::Project 3K: Fast Moving Consumer Goods for the European Retail Supply Chain
::6-FEDEX-A: FedEx Procedures for Testing Packaged Products Weighing Up to 150 lbs
::6-FEDEX-B: FedEx Procedures for Testing Packaged Products Weighing Over 150 lbs
::6-SAMSCLUB, Packaged-Products for Sam’s Club® Distribution System Shipment
::Procedure 7D: Thermal Controlled Transport Packaging for Parcel Delivery System Shipment

==Recipients==
Recipients, if they are to receive packages in a timely and appropriate manner, must accommodate carriers. With the rise of the sharing economy multiple family dwelling with restricted access face difficulties due to increasing volume of deliveries, some of which, such as food, may be time-sensitive. Some have built storage rooms for packages and installed refrigerators.

Recipients often choose to use a high capacity &quot;parcel box&quot; which will store large numbers of items and mail at the same time. Deposited items are securely stored with the use of internal security baffles which allow parcels to drop down into the lower portions of the box whilst restricting the theft of items through the aperture opening.

==Temperature considerations==

Prolonged extreme temperature exposure is an important consideration for delivery of some types of products. Many delivery vans are not controlled for temperature: Delivered items may sit unattended for hours on porches, on driveways, or in mail boxes. 

Potential heat exposure may cause degradation to some pharmaceuticals, live plants, foods, paint, cut flowers, chemicals, etc. Packages sitting on hot pavement or in the direct sun can become very hot. Sunlight on enclosed mail boxes can amplify the ambient temperature. For example, the USFDA found that the temperature in a steel mailbox painted black could reach 136 °F (58 °C) in full sun while the ambient air temperature was 101 °F (38 °C).

Similarly, extreme cold temperature can damage or degrade other types of products. 

Several options may help. Insulated shipping containers, thermal bags, or special mailing envelopes are sometimes used. Some carriers offer express delivery or &quot;special handling&quot;. Consignees may be required to personally accept delivery to prevent unattended drop-offs. Temperature data loggers, analog devices, and thermochromic inks are available to help identify temperature abuse.

<doc id="206115" wikidata="Q72755" url="?curid=206115" title="Schwarzschild radius">
<text>The Schwarzschild radius or the gravitational radius is a physical parameter in the Schwarzschild solution to Einstein&#x27;s field equations that corresponds to the radius defining the event horizon of a Schwarzschild black hole. It is a characteristic radius associated with any quantity of mass. The Schwarzschild radius was named after the German astronomer Karl Schwarzschild, who calculated this exact solution for the theory of general relativity in 1916.

The Schwarzschild radius is given as
formula_1
where &quot;G&quot; is the gravitational constant, &quot;M&quot; is the object mass, and &quot;c&quot; is the speed of light.

==History==
In 1916, Karl Schwarzschild obtained the exact solution to Einstein&#x27;s field equations for the gravitational field outside a non-rotating, spherically symmetric body with mass formula_2 (see Schwarzschild metric). The solution contained terms of the form formula_3 and formula_4, which become singular at formula_5 and formula_6 respectively. The formula_7 has come to be known as the &quot;Schwarzschild radius&quot;. The physical significance of these singularities was debated for decades. It was found that the one at formula_8 is a coordinate singularity, meaning that it is an artifact of the particular system of coordinates that was used; while the one at formula_9 is a spacetime singularity and cannot be removed. The Schwarzschild radius is nonetheless a physically relevant quantity, as noted above and below.

This expression had previously been calculated, using Newtonian mechanics, as the radius of a spherically symmetric body at which the escape velocity was equal to the speed of light. It had been identified in the 18th century by John Michell and Pierre-Simon Laplace.

==Parameters==
The Schwarzschild radius of an object is proportional to its mass. Accordingly, the Sun has a Schwarzschild radius of approximately , whereas Earth&#x27;s is approximately and the Moon&#x27;s is approximately .

==Derivation==
The simplest way of deriving the Schwarzschild radius comes from the equality of the modulus of a spherical solid mass&#x27; rest energy with its gravitational energy: 

:formula_10

So, the Schwarzschild radius reads as 

:formula_11

==Black hole classification by Schwarzschild radius==

Any object whose radius is smaller than its Schwarzschild radius is called a black hole. The surface at the Schwarzschild radius acts as an event horizon in a non-rotating body (a rotating black hole operates slightly differently). Neither light nor particles can escape through this surface from the region inside, hence the name &quot;black hole&quot;.

Black holes can be classified based on their Schwarzschild radius, or equivalently, by their density, where density is defined as mass of a black hole divided by the volume of its Schwarzschild sphere. As the Schwarzschild radius is linearly related to mass, while the enclosed volume corresponds to the third power of the radius, small black holes are therefore much more dense than large ones. The volume enclosed in the event horizon of the most massive black holes has an average density lower than main sequence stars.

===Supermassive black hole===

A supermassive black hole (SMBH) is the largest type of black hole, though there are few official criteria on how such an object is considered so, on the order of hundreds of thousands to billions of solar masses. (Supermassive black holes up to 21 billion have been detected, such as NGC 4889.) Unlike stellar mass black holes, supermassive black holes have comparatively low average densities. (Note that a (non-rotating) black hole is a spherical region in space that surrounds the singularity at its center; it is not the singularity itself.) With that in mind, the average density of a supermassive black hole can be less than the density of water.

The Schwarzschild radius of a body is proportional to its mass and therefore to its volume, assuming that the body has a constant mass-density. In contrast, the physical radius of the body is proportional to the cube root of its volume. Therefore, as the body accumulates matter at a given fixed density (in this example, 997 kg/m3, the density of water), its Schwarzschild radius will increase more quickly than its physical radius. When a body of this density has grown to around 136 million solar masses (), its physical radius would be overtaken by its Schwarzschild radius, and thus it would form a supermassive black hole.

It is thought that supermassive black holes like these do not form immediately from the singular collapse of a cluster of stars. Instead they may begin life as smaller, stellar-sized black holes and grow larger by the accretion of matter, or even of other black holes.

The Schwarzschild radius of the supermassive black hole at the Galactic Center of the Milky Way is approximately 12 million kilometres. Its mass is about .

===Stellar black hole===

Stellar black holes have much greater average densities than supermassive black holes. If one accumulates matter at nuclear density (the density of the nucleus of an atom, about 1018 kg/m3; neutron stars also reach this density), such an accumulation would fall within its own Schwarzschild radius at about and thus would be a stellar black hole.

===Micro black hole===
A small mass has an extremely small Schwarzschild radius. A black hole of mass similar to that of Mount Everest, , would have a Schwarzschild radius much smaller than a nanometre. The Schwarzschild radius would be 2 × × / ()2 . Its average density at that size would be so high that no known mechanism could form such extremely compact objects. Such black holes might possibly be formed in an early stage of the evolution of the universe, just after the Big Bang, when densities of matter were extremely high. Therefore, these hypothetical miniature black holes are called primordial black holes.

When moving to the Planck scale , it is convenient to write the gravitational radius in the form formula_12, (see also virtual black hole).

== Other uses ==

=== In gravitational time dilation ===

Gravitational time dilation near a large, slowly rotating, nearly spherical body, such as the Earth or Sun can be reasonably approximated as follows:
formula_13
where:
* is the elapsed time for an observer at radial coordinate &quot;r&quot; within the gravitational field;
* is the elapsed time for an observer distant from the massive object (and therefore outside of the gravitational field);
* is the radial coordinate of the observer (which is analogous to the classical distance from the center of the object);
* is the Schwarzschild radius.

=== Compton wavelength intersection ===
The Schwarzschild radius (formula_14) and the Compton wavelength (formula_15) corresponding to a given mass are similar when the mass is around one Planck mass (formula_16), when both are of the same order as the Planck length (formula_17).

=== Gravitational radius and the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle === 
:formula_18

Thus, formula_19 or formula_20, which is another form of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle on the Planck scale. (See also Virtual black hole).

=== Calculating the maximum volume and radius possible given a density before a black hole forms ===
The Schwarzschild radius equation can be manipulated to yield an expression that gives the largest possible radius from an input density that doesn&#x27;t form a black hole. Taking the input density as ,

:formula_21

For example, the density of water is . This means the largest amount of water you can have without forming a black hole would have a radius of 400 920 754 km (about 2.67 AU).

<text>Night, or nighttime, is the period of darkness when the Sun is below the horizon. The opposite of nighttime is daytime. Sunlight illuminates one side of the Earth, leaving the other in darkness. Earth&#x27;s rotation causes the appearance of sunrise and sunset. Moonlight, airglow, starlight, and light pollution dimly illuminate night. The duration of day, night, and twilight varies depending on the time of year and the latitude. Night on other celestial bodies is affected by their rotation and orbital periods. The planets Mercury and Venus have much longer nights than Earth. On Venus, night lasts 120 Earth days. The Moon&#x27;s rotation is tidally locked, rotating so that one of the sides of the Moon always faces Earth. Nightfall across portions of the near side of the Moon results in lunar phases visible from Earth.

Organisms respond to the changes brought by nightfall: darkness, increased humidity, and lower temperatures. Their responses include direct reactions and adjustments to circadian rhythms governed by an internal biological clock. These circadian rhythms, regulated by exposure to light and darkness, affect an organism&#x27;s behavior and physiology. Animals more active at night are called nocturnal and have adaptations for low light, including different forms of night vision and the heightening of other senses. Diurnal animals are active during the day and sleep at night; mammals, birds, and some others dream while asleep. Fungi respond directly to nightfall and increase their biomass. With some exceptions, fungi do not rely on a biological clock. Plants store energy produced through photosynthesis as starch granules to consume at night. Algae engage in a similar process, and cyanobacteria transition from photosynthesis to nitrogen fixation after sunset. In arid environments like deserts, plants evolved to be more active at night, with many gathering carbon dioxide overnight for daytime photosynthesis. Night-blooming cacti rely on nocturnal pollinators such as bats and moths for reproduction. Light pollution disrupts the patterns in ecosystems and is especially harmful to night-flying insects.

Historically, night has been a time of increased danger and insecurity. Many daytime social controls dissipated after sunset. Theft, fights, murders, taboo sexual activities, and accidental deaths all became more frequent due in part to reduced visibility. Cultures have personified night through deities associated with some or all of these aspects of nighttime. The folklore of many cultures contains &quot;creatures of the night&quot;, including werewolves, witches, ghosts, and goblins, reflecting societal fears and anxieties. The introduction of artificial lighting extended daytime activities. Major European cities hung lanterns housing candles and oil lamps in the 1600s. Nineteenth-century gas and electric lights created unprecedented illumination. The range of socially acceptable leisure activities expanded, and various industries introduced a night shift. Nightlife, encompassing bars, nightclubs, and cultural venues, has become a significant part of urban culture, contributing to social and political movements.

==Astronomy==
A planet&#x27;s rotation causes nighttime and daytime. When a place on Earth is pointed away from the Sun, that location experiences night. The Sun appears to set in the West and rise in the East due to Earth&#x27;s rotation. Many celestial bodies, including the other planets in the solar system, have a form of night.

===Earth===
The length of night on Earth varies depending on the time of year. Longer nights occur in winter, with the winter solstice being the longest. Nights are shorter in the summer, with the summer solstice being the shortest. Earth orbits the Sun on an axis tilted 23.44 degrees. Nights are longer when a hemisphere is tilted away from the Sun and shorter when a hemisphere is tilted toward the Sun. As a result, the longest night of the year for the Northern Hemisphere will be the shortest night of the year for the Southern Hemisphere.

Night&#x27;s duration varies least near the equator. The difference between the shortest and longest night increases approaching the poles. At the equator, night lasts roughly 12 hours throughout the year. The tropics have little difference in the length of day and night. At the 45th parallel, the longest winter night is roughly twice as long as the shortest summer night. Within the polar circles, night will last the full 24 hours of the winter solstice. The length of this polar night increases closer to the poles. Utqiagvik, Alaska, the northernmost point in the United States, experiences 65 days of polar night. At the pole itself, polar night lasts 179 days from September to March.

Over a year, there is more daytime than nighttime because of the Sun&#x27;s size and atmospheric refraction. The Sun is not a single point. Viewed from Earth, the Sun ranges in angular diameter from 31 to 33 arcminutes. When the center of the Sun falls to the western horizon, half of the Sun will still be visible during sunset. Likewise, by the time the center of the Sun rises to the eastern horizon, half of the Sun will already be visible during sunrise. This shortens night by about three minutes in temperate zones. Atmospheric refraction is a larger factor. Refraction bends sunlight over the horizon. On Earth, the Sun remains briefly visible after it has geometrically fallen below the horizon. This shortens night by about six minutes. Scattered, diffuse sunlight remains in the sky after sunset and into twilight.

There are multiple ways to define twilight, the gradual transition to and from darkness when the Sun is below the horizon. &quot;Civil&quot; twilight occurs when the Sun is between 0° and 6° below the horizon. Nearby planets like Venus and bright stars like Sirius are visible during this period. &quot;Nautical&quot; twilight continues until the Sun is 12° below the horizon. During nautical twilight, the horizon is visible enough for navigation. &quot;Astronomical&quot; twilight continues until the Sun has sunk 18° below the horizon. Beyond 18°, refracted sunlight is no longer visible. The period when the sun is 18° or more below either horizon is called astronomical night.

Similar to the duration of night itself, the duration of twilight varies according to latitude. At the equator, day quickly transitions to night, while the transition can take weeks near the poles. The duration of twilight is longest at the summer solstice and shortest near the equinoxes. Moonlight, starlight, airglow, and light pollution can dimly illuminate the nighttime, with their diffuse aspects being termed skyglow. The amount of skyglow increases each year due to artificial lighting.

===Other celestial bodies===
Night exists on the other planets and moons in the solar system. The length of night is affected by the rotation period and orbital period of the celestial object. The lunar phases visible from Earth result from nightfall on the Moon. The Moon has longer nights than Earth, lasting about two weeks. This is half of the synodic lunar month, the time it takes the Moon to cycle through its phases. The Moon is tidally locked to Earth; it rotates so that one side of the Moon always faces the Earth. The side of the Moon facing away from Earth is called the far side of the Moon, and the side facing Earth is called the near side of the Moon. During lunar night on the near side, Earth is 50 times brighter than a full moon. Because the Moon has no atmosphere, there is an abrupt transition from day to night without twilight.

Night varies from planet to planet within the Solar System. Mars&#x27;s dusty atmosphere causes a lengthy twilight period. The refracted light ranges from purple to blue, often resulting in glowing noctilucent clouds. Venus and Mercury have long nights because of their slow rotational periods. The planet Venus rotates once every 243 Earth days. Because of its unusual retrograde rotation, nights last 116.75 Earth days. The dense greenhouse atmosphere on Venus keeps its surface hot enough to melt lead throughout the night. Its planetary wind system, driven by solar heat, reverses direction from day to night. Venus&#x27;s winds flow from the equator to the poles on the day side and from the poles to the equator on the night side. On Mercury, the planet closest to the Sun, the temperature drops by over after nightfall.

The day-night cycle is one consideration for planetary habitability or the possibility of extraterrestrial life on distant exoplanets. In general, shorter nights result in a higher equilibrium temperature for the planet. On an Earth-like planet, longer day-night cycles may increase habitability up to a point. Computer models show that longer nights would affect Hadley circulation, resulting in a cooler, less cloudy planet. Once the rotation speed of a planet slows beyond 1/16 that of Earth, the difference in day-to-night temperature shifts increases dramatically. Some exoplanets, like those of TRAPPIST-1, are tidally locked. Tidally locked planets have equal rotation and orbital periods, so one side experiences constant day, and the other side constant night. In these situations, astrophysicists believe that life would most likely develop in the twilight zone between the day and night hemispheres.

==Biology==
Living organisms react directly to the darkness of night. Light and darkness also affect circadian rhythms, the physical and mental changes that occur in a 24-hour cycle. This daily cycle is regulated by an internal &quot;biological clock&quot; that is adjusted by exposure to light. The length and timing of nighttime depend on location and time of year. Organisms that are more active at night possess adaptations to the night&#x27;s dimmer light, increased humidity, and lower temperatures.

===Animals===
Animals that are active primarily at night are called nocturnal and usually possess adaptations for night vision. In vertebrates&#x27; eyes, two types of photoreceptor cells sense light. Cone cells sense color but are ineffective in low light; rod cells sense only brightness but remain effective in very dim light. The eyes of nocturnal animals have a greater percentage of rod cells. In most mammals, rod cells contain densely packed DNA near the edge of the nucleus. For nocturnal mammals, this is reversed with the densely packed DNA in the center of the nucleus, which reduces the scattering of light. Some nocturnal animals have a mirror, the tapetum lucidum, behind the retina. This doubles the amount of light their eyes can process.

The compound eyes of insects can see at even lower levels of light. For example, the elephant hawk moth can see in color, including ultraviolet, with only starlight. Nocturnal insects navigate using moonlight, lunar phases, infrared vision, the position of the stars, and the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field. Artificial lighting disrupts the biorhythms of many animals. Night-flying insects that use the moon for navigation are especially vulnerable to disorientation from increasing levels of artificial lighting. Artificial lights attract many night-flying insects that die from exhaustion and nocturnal predators. Decreases in insect populations disrupt the overall ecosystem because their larvae are a key food source for smaller fish. Dark-sky advocate Paul Bogard described the unnatural migration of night-flying insects from the unlit Nevada desert into Las Vegas as &quot;like sparkling confetti floating in the beam&#x27;s white column&quot;.

Some nocturnal animals have developed other senses to compensate for limited light. Many snakes have a pit organ that senses infrared light and enables them to detect heat. Nocturnal mice possess a vomeronasal organ that enhances their sense of smell. Bats heavily depend on echolocation. Echolocation allows an animal to navigate with their sense of hearing by emitting sounds and listening for the time it takes them to bounce back. Bats emit a steady stream of clicks while hunting insects and home in on prey as thin as human hair.
People and other diurnal animals sleep primarily at night. Humans, other mammals, and birds experience multiple stages of sleep visible via electroencephalography. The stages of sleep are wakefulness, three stages of non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREM), including deep sleep, and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. During REM sleep, dreams are more frequent and complex. Studies show that some reptiles may also experience REM sleep. During deep sleep, memories are consolidated into long-term memory. Invertebrates most likely experience a form of sleep as well. Studies on bees, which have complex but unrelated brain structures, have shown improvements in memory after sleep, similar to mammals.

Compared to waking life, dreams are sparse with limited sensory detail. Dreams are hallucinatory or bizarre, and they often have a narrative structure. Many hypotheses exist to explain the function of dreams without a definitive answer. Nightmares are dreams that cause distress. The word &quot;night-mare&quot; originally referred to nocturnal demons that were believed to assail sleeping dreamers, like the incubus (male) or succubus (female). It was believed that the demons could sit upon a dreamer&#x27;s chest to suffocate a victim, as depicted in John Henry Fuseli&#x27;s &quot;The Nightmare&quot;.

===Fungi===
Fungi can sense the presence and absence of light, and the nightly changes of most fungi growth and biological processes are direct responses to either darkness or falling temperatures. By night, fungi are more engaged in synthesizing cellular components and increasing their biomass. For example, fungi that prey on insects will infect the central nervous system of their prey, allowing the fungi to control the actions of the dying insect. During the late afternoon, the fungi will pilot their prey to higher elevations where wind currents can carry its spores further. The fungi will kill and digest the insect as night falls, extending fruiting bodies from the host&#x27;s exoskeleton. Few species of fungi have true circadian rhythms. A notable exception is &quot;Neurospora crassa&quot;, a bread mold, widely used to study biorhythms.

===Plants===
During the day, plants engage in photosynthesis and release oxygen. By night, plants engage in respiration, consuming oxygen and releasing carbon dioxide. Plants can draw up more water after sunset, which facilitates new leaf growth. As plants cannot create energy through photosynthesis after sunset, they use energy stored in the plant, typically as starch granules. Plants use this stored energy at a steady rate, depleting their reserves almost right at dawn. Plants will adjust their rate of consumption to match the expected time until sunrise. This avoids prematurely running out of starch reserves, and it allows the plant to adjust for longer nights in the winter. If a plant is subjected to artificially early darkness, it will ration its energy consumption to last until dawn.

Succulent plants, including cacti, have adapted to the limited water availability in arid environments like deserts. The stomata of cacti do not open until night. When the temperature drops, the pores open to allow the cacti to store carbon dioxide for photosynthesis the next day, a process known as crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM). Cacti and most night-blooming plants use CAM to store up to 99% of the carbon dioxide they use in daily photosynthesis. Ceroid cacti often have flowers that bloom at night and fade before sunrise. As few bees are nocturnal, night-flowering plants rely on other pollinators, including moths, beetles, and bats. These flowers rely more on the pollinators&#x27; sense of smell, with strong perfumes to attract moths and foul-smelling odors to attract bats.

Eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms that engage in photosynthesis are also affected by nightfall. Like plants, algae will switch to taking in oxygen and processing energy stored as starch. Cyanobacteria, also known as blue algae, switch from photosynthesis to nitrogen fixation after sunset, and they absorb DNA at a much higher rate.

==Culture==
===History and technology===

Before the industrial era, night was a time of heightened insecurity. Fear of the night was common but varied in intensity across cultures. Dangers increased due to lower visibility. Injuries and deaths were caused by drowning and falling into pits, ditches, and shafts. People were less able to evaluate others after dark. Due to nocturnal alcohol consumption and the anonymity of darkness, quarrels were more likely to escalate to violence. For example, in medieval Stockholm, the majority of murders were committed while intoxicated. Crime and fear of crime increased at night. In pre-industrial Europe, criminals disguised themselves with hats, face paint, or cloaks. Thieves would trip pedestrians with ropes laid across streets and dismount horse riders using long poles extended from the roadside shadows. They used &quot;dark lanterns&quot; where light could be shined through a single side. Gangs were uncommon except for housebreaking. The increased humidity of night was deemed the result of vapors and fumes. The annual movements of stars and constellations across the night sky were used to track the passage of time, but other changes in the night sky were interpreted as significant omens.

Many daytime religious, governmental, and local social controls dissipated after nightfall. Fortified Christian communities announced the coming darkness with horns, church bells, or drums. This alerted residents—like peasants working the fields—to return home before the city gates shut. The English engaged in a daily process of &quot;shutting in&quot;, where valuables were brought into homes before they were bolted, barred, locked, and shuttered. Many English and European towns attempted to impose curfews during the medieval period and gradually loosened the restrictions via exceptions. Prayer and folk magic were more common by night. Amulets were hung to ward off nightmares, spells were cast against thievery, and pig hearts were hung in chimneys to block demons from traveling down them. The common phrase &quot;good night&quot; has been shortened from &quot;God give you a good night.&quot; In Ottoman Istanbul, the royal palaces shifted to projecting nocturnal power through large parties lit by lanterns, candles, and fireworks. Though alcohol was forbidden for Muslims, after dark, Turkish Muslims went to the bars and taverns beyond the Muslim areas.

The night has long been a time of increased sexual activity, especially in taboo forms such as premarital, extramarital, gay, and lesbian sex. In colonial New England courtship, young unmarried couples practiced bundling before marriage. The couples would lie down in the woman&#x27;s bed, her family would wrap them tightly with blankets, and they would spend the night together this way. Some families took precautions to prevent unintended pregnancies, like sleeping in the same room, laying a large wooden board between the couple, or pulling a single stocking over both of their daughter&#x27;s legs. Historian Roger Ekirch described pre-industrial night as a &quot;sanctuary from ordinary existence.&quot;

Artificial lighting expanded the scope of acceptable work and leisure after dark. In the 1600s, the major European cities introduced streetlights. These were lit by lamplighters each evening outside of the summer months. Early streetlights were metal and glass enclosures housing candles or oil lamps. They were suspended above streets or mounted on posts. The use of artificial lighting led to an increase in acceptable nightlife. In more rural areas, night remained a period of rest and nocturnal labor. Young adults, the urban poor, prostitutes, and thieves benefited from the anonymity of darkness and frequently smashed the new lanterns. Gas lighting was invented in the 1800s. A gas mantle was over ten times brighter than an oil lamp. Gas lighting was associated with the creation of regular police forces. In England, police departments were tasked with maintaining the gas lights, which became known as &quot;police lamps&quot;. Daytime routines were further pushed back into the night by the electric light bulb—invented in the late 19th century—and the widespread usage of newer timekeeping devices like watches. Electric lights created night shifts for traditionally daytime fields, like India&#x27;s cotton industry, and created opportunities for working adults to attend night school.

Before the widespread usage of artificial lighting, sleep was typically split into two major segments separated by about an hour of wakefulness. During this midnight period, people engaged in prayer, crimes, urination, sex, and, most commonly, reflection. Without exposure to artificial light, studies show that people revert to sleeping in two separate intervals.

===Folklore and religion===
Diverse cultures have made connections between the night sky and the afterlife. Many Native American peoples have described the Milky Way as a path where the deceased travel as stars. The Lakota term for the Milky Way is &quot;Wanáǧi Thacháŋku&quot;, or &quot;Spirit&#x27;s Road&quot;. In Mayan mythology, the Milky Way&#x27;s dark band is the Road of Xibalba, the path to the underworld. Unrelated cultures share a myth of a star-covered sky goddess who arches over the planet after sunset, like Citlālicue, the Aztec personification of the Milky Way. The elongated Egyptian goddess Nut and &quot;N!adima&quot; from Botswana are said to consume the Sun at dusk. In the Ancient Egyptian religion, the Sun then travels through the netherworld inside Nut&#x27;s body, where it is reborn at dawn.

Many cultures have personified the night. Ratri is the star-covered Hindu goddess of the night. In the Icelandic &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, night is embodied by Nótt. Ratri and Nött are goddesses of sleep and rest, but it&#x27;s common for personifications to be associated with misfortune. In Aztec mythology, Black Tezcatlipoca, the &quot;Night Wind&quot;, was associated with obsidian and the nocturnal jaguar. In his &quot;Precious Owl&quot; manifestation, the Aztecs regarded Tezcatlipoca as the bringer of death and destruction. The Aztecs anticipated an unending night when the Tzitzimīmeh, skeletal female star deities, would descend to consume all humans. In classical mythology, the night goddess Nyx is the mother of Sleep, Death, Disease, Strife, and Doom. In Jewish culture and mysticism, the demon Lilith embodies the emotional reactions to darkness, including terror, lust, and liberation.

Nighttime in the pre-industrial period, often called the &quot;night season&quot;, was associated with darkness and uncertainty. Various cultures have regarded the night as a time when ghosts and other spirits are active on Earth. When Protestant theologians abandoned the concept of purgatory, many came to view reported ghost sightings as the result of demonic activity. In the sixteenth century, Swiss theologian Ludwig Lavater began attempting to explain reported spirits as mistakes, deceit, or the work of demons. The idea of night as a dangerous, dark, or haunted time persists in modern urban legends like the vanishing hitchhiker.

In folklore, nocturnal preternatural beings like goblins, fairies, werewolves, pucks, brownies, banshees, and boggarts have overlapping but non-synonymous definitions. The werewolf—and its francophone variations, the &quot;loup-garou&quot; and rougarou—were believed to be people who transformed into beasts at night. In West Africa and among the African diaspora, there is a widespread tradition of a type of vampire who removes their human skin at night and travels as a blood-sucking ball of light. Variation includes the feu-follet, the Surinamese &quot;asema&quot;, the Caribbean &quot;sukuyan&quot;, the Ashanti &quot;obayifo&quot;, and the Ghanaian &quot;asanbosam&quot;. The medieval fear of night-flying European witches was influenced by the Roman &quot;strix&quot;. The Romans described the &quot;strix&quot; as capable of changing between a beautiful woman and an owl-shaped monster. Common themes among these mythical nocturnal entities include hypersexuality, predation, shapeshifting, deception, mischief, and malice.

===Nightlife===


Nightlife, sometimes referred to as &quot;the night-time economy&quot;, is a range of entertainment available and generally more popular from the late evening into the early morning. It has traditionally included venues such as pubs, bars, nightclubs, live music, concerts, cabarets, theaters, hookah lounges, cinemas, and shows. Nightlife entertainment is often more adult-oriented than daytime entertainment. It also includes informal gatherings like parties, &quot;botellón&quot;, gymkhanas, bingo, and amateur sports. In many cities, there has been an increasing focus on nightlife catering to tourists. Nightlife has become a major part of the economy and urban planning in modern cities. People who prefer to be active at night are called night owls.

Social movements in the 20th century, including feminism, black activism, the gay rights movement, and community action, blurred the lines between political action and broader cultural activities, making political movements a part of the nightlife. Sociologists have argued that vibrant city nightlife scenes contribute to the development of culture and political movements. David Grazian cites as examples the development of beat poetry, musical styles including bebop, urban blues, and early rock, and the importance of nightlife for the development of the gay rights movement in the United States kicked off by the riots at the Stonewall Inn nightclub in Greenwich Village, Lower Manhattan, New York City. Modern cities treat nightlife as necessary to the city&#x27;s marketability but also something to be managed in order to reduce activities viewed as disorderly, risky, or otherwise problematic. Urban renewal policies have increased the available possibilities for nighttime consumers and decreased the non-commercial nocturnal activities outside of sanctioned festivals and concerts.

==Art==

===Literature===

In literature, night is often associated with mysterious, hidden, dangerous, and clandestine activities. &quot;Rhesus&quot; is the only extant Greek tragedy where night is explicitly invoked and made an element of the story. In the play, night is a time of disorder and confusion that allows Odysseus to sneak into the Trojan camp and kill King Rhesus of Thrace. The handful of surviving Classical Greek texts that describe the nocturnal activities of women portray female freedom, especially to speak openly, male anxieties about that freedom, and magic that functions as a metaphor for nocturnal danger. Roman poets like Marcus Manilius and Aratus worked late into the night and incorporated darkness and the night sky into their writing.

Since the Age of Enlightenment, nocturnal settings have been a frequent place for passionate chaos as a counterbalance to the rationality present during the day. In Gothic fiction, this absence of rationality offered a space for lust and terror. Ottoman literature portrayed night as a time for forbidden or unrequited love. Night and day were long depicted as opposite conditions. The electric light, the industrial revolution, and shift work brought many aspects of daily life into the night. The author Charles Dickens lived in London during the time of gas lighting and compared the unstable separation between the waking and sleeping city to the unstable separation he perceived between dream and delusion. Night in contemporary literature offers liminal settings, such as hospitals and gas stations, that contain some aspects of daily life.

===Film and photography===
Directly filming at night is rarely done. Film stocks and video cameras are much less sensitive to low-light environments than the human eye. During the silent film era, night scenes were filmed during the day in black and white. The sections of the monochrome film reel with exterior night scenes were soaked in an acidic dye that tinted the whole scene blue. &quot;Day for night&quot; is a set of cinematic techniques that simulate a night scene while filming in daylight. They include underexposing to soften the scene, using a graduated neutral-density filter to mute lighting, and setting up the artificial lighting to amplify shadows in the background. Lower-budget films are more likely to use day for night shooting; larger-budget films are more likely to film at night with artificial lighting. Cinematographers have used tinting, filters, color balance settings, and physical lights to color night scenes blue. In low light, people experience the Purkinje effect, which causes reds to dim so that more blue is perceived. As light decreases towards total darkness, the human eye has more scotopic vision, relying more on rod cells and being less able to perceive color.

Night photography can capture the natural colors of night by increasing the exposure time, or length of time captured in the photography. Longer exposures open the possibility for photographers to use light painting to selectively illuminate a scene. Digital photography can also make use of high-ISO settings, which increase the sensitivity to light, to take shorter exposure shots. This makes it possible to capture moving subjects without turning their movements into a blur.

===Painting===
Dating back to prehistoric cave paintings, artists have used a range of symbols to denote and depict the night sky. Researchers at the Universities of Edinburgh and Kent have proposed that some of the animals painted at prehistoric sites across Europe and Asia Minor, like Çatalhöyük, Lascaux, and the Cave of Altamira, represent not actual animals but prehistoric zodiac signs. The first widely accepted portrayal of the night sky is the Nebra sky disc created . In medieval art, astrological signs gave meaning to paintings of night scenes. Adam Elsheimer&#x27;s paintings on copper plates were some of the earliest realistic depictions of the night sky.

Baroque paintings typically used a darker color scheme than previous painting styles in Europe. From the 17th century, darkness took up larger areas of paintings on average. Changes in the chemical composition of the paint itself and the development of new techniques for representing light led to the tenebrism style of painting. Tenebrism used stark, realistic depictions of light contrasted with darkness to create realistic depictions of night and darkness illuminated by moonlight, candles, and lamps. The work of Baroque painters, like Caravaggio, who painted an entire studio black, was influenced by the alchemical concept of &quot;nigredo&quot;, or blackness as connected to death and decomposition. Dutch Golden Age painter Rembrandt recreated the dim light cast by early street lighting by layering translucent brown glazes.

Impressionists represented darkness with shades of brown and blue based on the ideas that true black was not present in nature and that black had a deadening effect on the art. Claude Monet notably avoided black paints. Vincent van Gogh used heavy outlines between panes of color in his paintings, inspired by woodblock printing in Japan. This style, called &quot;cloisonné&quot; after the metalworking technique that embedded glass between dark lines of wire, was adopted by other painters like Paul Gauguin. As night in Europe became more artificially lit, former railway worker John Atkinson Grimshaw became known for his vibrantly lit urban paintings. In the modern era, painters have variously returned to archetypal symbols to capture the awe of night or painted scenes that emphasize how the modern city separates the viewer from the night sky.

Near Eastern artists initially rejected these techniques to depict shadow as hiding aspects of creation in shadows. Mughal painters quickly incorporated techniques to depict night, twilight, and mists. Under Emperor Akbar I, European materials and techniques were imported. Rajasthani paintings combined these with traditional styles and symbolism. &quot;Nayikas&quot;, depictions of women seeking romantic love, were a common subject and often included night as the setting for romance and peril. Jesuit painter Giuseppe Castiglione brought Renaissance techniques for painting light and shadow to 17th-century China. In pieces like &quot;One Hundred Famous Views of Edo&quot;, Hiroshige developed techniques to represent shadow and nocturnal light that became widespread in Japanese Meiji-era art. Known for his crowd scenes lit by fireworks, Hiroshige had a strong influence on European painters.

<doc id="206120" wikidata="Q505285" url="?curid=206120" title="Richie Havens">
<text>Richard Pierce Havens (January 21, 1941 – April 22, 2013) was an American singer-songwriter and guitarist. His music encompassed elements of folk, soul (both of which he frequently covered), and rhythm and blues. He had a rhythmic guitar style (often in open tunings). He was the opening act at Woodstock, sang many jingles for television commercials, and was also the voice of the GeoSafari toys.

==Early life==
Born in Bedford–Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, New York City, New York, Havens was the oldest of nine children. He was of Native American (Blackfoot) descent on his father&#x27;s side and of the British West Indies on his mother&#x27;s. His grandfather was Blackfoot of the Montana/South Dakota area.

Havens&#x27;s grandfather and great-uncle joined Buffalo Bill&#x27;s Wild West Show, moved to New York City thereafter, and settled on the Shinnecock Reservation on Long Island. Havens&#x27;s grandfather married, then moved to Brooklyn.

As a youth, Havens began organizing his neighborhood friends into a street corner doo-wop group. At age 16, he was performing with the McCrea Gospel Singers.

==Career==
===Early career===
At age 20, Havens left his hometown of Brooklyn, seeking artistic stimulation in Greenwich Village in Manhattan. &quot;I saw the Village as a place to escape to, in order to express yourself,&quot; he recalled. &quot;I had first gone there during the beatnik days of the 1950s to perform poetry, then I drew portraits for two years and stayed up all night listening to folk music in the clubs. It took a while before I thought of picking up a guitar.&quot; 

Havens&#x27;s solo performances quickly spread beyond the Village folk music circles. After cutting two records for Douglas Records, he signed on with Bob Dylan&#x27;s manager, Albert Grossman, and landed a record deal with the Verve Folkways (later Verve Forecast) label. Verve released &quot;Mixed Bag&quot; in late 1966, which featured tracks such as &quot;Handsome Johnny&quot; (co-written by Havens and actor Louis Gossett Jr.), &quot;Follow,&quot; and a cover of Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Just Like a Woman&quot;. Havens released his first single, &quot;No Opportunity Necessary&quot;, in 1967.

&quot;Something Else Again&quot; (1968) became his first album to hit the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, and it pulled &quot;Mixed Bag&quot; back onto the charts. By 1969, he had released five albums. Two of those albums were unauthorized and were released by Douglas Records (or Douglas International): &quot;Electric Havens&quot; (released June 1, 1968) and &quot;Richie Havens Record&quot; (1969).

===Woodstock and rise in fame===

Havens&#x27;s live performances earned widespread notice. His opening 1969 appearance at Woodstock in a trio with Paul &quot;Deano&quot; Williams on guitar and singing backing vocals and Daniel Ben Zebulon on percussion catapulted him into stardom and was a major turning point in his career. Despite Havens&#x27;s recollection that he performed for nearly three hours, the actual recording and setlist reflect that he played about fifty minutes. Havens continued playing because the musicians after him were delayed by traffic, including the originally scheduled opening act, Sweetwater. Havens concluded his set by riffing off the old spiritual &quot;Motherless Child&quot;. In an interview with Cliff Smith, for Music-Room, Havens explained:

I&#x27;d already played every song I knew and I was stalling, asking for more guitar and mic, trying to think of something else to play – and then it just came to me ... The establishment was foolish enough to give us all this freedom and we used it in every way we could.

The subsequent Woodstock movie release helped Havens reach a worldwide audience. He also appeared two weeks later at the Isle of Wight Festival, in late August 1969.
Havens also began acting during the 1970s. He was featured in the original 1972 stage presentation of The Who&#x27;s &quot;Tommy&quot;, as Othello in the 1974 film &quot;Catch My Soul&quot;, in &quot;Greased Lightning&quot; alongside Richard Pryor, and in Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Hearts of Fire&quot;.

In July 1978, he was a featured performer at the Benefit Concert for The Longest Walk, an American Indian spiritual walk from Alcatraz to Washington, D.C. affirming treaty rights, as a result of legislation that had been introduced to abrogate Indian treaties.

===Branching into other media===
Havens continued to release music and tour during the 1980s and 90s. He made advertisements for NBC, CBS and ABC, and commercials for Amtrak and for Coca-Cola. Havens also did corporate commercial work for Maxwell House Coffee and Folgers as well as sang &quot;The Fabric of Our Lives&quot; theme for the cotton industry. In 1982, he appeared at the UK&#x27;s Glastonbury Festival, closing the show on the Sunday night. He has also made guest appearances on &quot;Sesame Street&quot; from 1974 to 1975.

On June 22, 1990, Richie Havens played at a packed Yankee Stadium concert in honor of Nelson Mandela who had come to New York for three days after Mandela’s release from the South African prison, Robben Island. Other performers at the concert were Judy Collins, Tracy Chapman and Mighty Sparrow.

In 1993, Havens performed at the inauguration of President Bill Clinton. Among the selections was the &quot;Cotton&quot; song, made famous by a series of television commercials from the early 1990s. In 1999, Havens played at the Tibetan Freedom Concert for an audience of more than 100,000.

The release of 1993&#x27;s &quot;Resume, The Best of Richie Havens&quot;, on Rhino Records, collected his late 1960s and early 1970s recordings. 

Havens played a small role, as a character named Daze, in the film &quot;Street Hunter&quot; (1990), starring John Leguizamo. He played himself in &quot;Rock of Ages&quot;, an episode of the TV sitcom &quot;Married... with Children&quot; (Season 7, Episode 9).

Havens was the 20th living recipient of the Peace Abbey Courage of Conscience Award, presented in Sherborn, Massachusetts, on April 12, 1991.

===Final years===
In 2000, Havens teamed with the electronic music duo Groove Armada for the retro 1970s-style song &quot;Hands of Time&quot;. The song was featured on the soundtrack of the film &quot;Collateral&quot;; that song was also used in the films &quot;Domino&quot;, &quot;A Lot Like Love&quot;, &quot;Tell No One&quot; and in the Cold Case episodes The Badlands &amp; Street Money. Havens was also featured on &quot;Little By Little&quot; and &quot;Healing&quot; on the band&#x27;s third album, &quot;Goodbye Country&quot;.

In 2000, he published &quot;They Can&#x27;t Hide Us Anymore,&quot; an autobiography co-written with Steve Davidowitz. Havens maintained his status as a folk icon and continued to tour. In 2002 he sang, uncredited, Dylan&#x27;s &quot;The Times They Are a Changin&#x27;&quot; in the TV series &quot;The West Wing&quot; (Season 4, Episode 7). Also in 2002, he released &quot;Wishing Well&quot;, followed by the 2004 album &quot;Grace of the Sun.&quot;

On February 15, 2003, Havens opened the unprecedented &quot;The World Says No To War&quot; in Iraq demonstration in New York City with his iconic &quot;Freedom.&quot; As the U.S. stood on the precipice of a &quot;Shock &amp; Awe&quot; attack on Iraq, tens of millions in more than 800 cities around the world marched against war, leading the New York Times to call these millions the &quot;world&#x27;s new superpower.&quot;

On October 15, 2006, Havens was inducted into the Long Island Music Hall of Fame.

In 2007, Havens appeared as Old Man Arvin in the Todd Haynes film &quot;I&#x27;m Not There&quot;. In a front-porch jam scene, he is shown singing the Bob Dylan song &quot;Tombstone Blues&quot; with Marcus Carl Franklin and Tyrone Benskin. Havens&#x27;s version of the song also appears on the &quot;I&#x27;m Not There&quot; soundtrack. On August 17, 2007, Richie Havens played Bethel Woods Center for the Arts, returning on the 38th Anniversary of Woodstock with Arlo Guthrie.Times Herald-Record - http://www.recordonline.com In February 2008, Havens performed at The Jazz Café in London.

Havens was invited to perform at the 2008 Cannes Film Festival opening ceremony. He played &quot;Freedom&quot; at the request of the jury president Sean Penn. Havens also performed at the London, Ontario, Blues Festival in July 2008.

In March 2008, Havens released a new studio album, &quot;Nobody Left To Crown&quot;. The first single release was the country-tinged &quot;The Key&quot;. On August 14, 2009, Richie returned for the 40th Anniversary of Woodstock to play the Bethel Woods Festival. Times Herald-Record - http://www.recordonline.com

Havens appeared in the acclaimed 2009 film &quot;Soundtrack for a Revolution&quot;, which provided a general history of the modern Civil Rights Movement and featured modern artists performing many of the era&#x27;s musical classics. In the film, Havens performed a haunting rendition of &quot;Will the Circle Be Unbroken?&quot;
On May 3, 2009, Havens performed at the fundraising concert in honor of Pete Seeger&#x27;s 90th birthday. In June 2009, he performed at the fifth annual Mountain Jam Festival.

===Health issues ===
In 2010, Havens underwent kidney surgery but did not recover fully enough to perform as he had before. In March 2012, he announced on his Facebook page that he would retire from touring after 45 years, due to health concerns.

===Death===
On April 22, 2013, Havens died of a heart attack at the age of 72. The BBC referred to him as a &quot;Woodstock icon&quot;, while Stephen Stills of Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young said Havens &quot;could never be replicated&quot;. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; stated Havens &quot;made an indelible mark on contemporary music&quot;, while Douglas Martin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Havens had &quot;riveted Woodstock&quot;.

Pursuant to Havens&#x27;s request, he was cremated, and his ashes were scattered from the air over the original site of the Woodstock Festival, in a ceremony held on August 18, 2013, the 44th anniversary of the festival&#x27;s last day.

<doc id="206122" wikidata="Q221037" url="?curid=206122" title="Big Crunch">
<text>The Big Crunch is a hypothetical scenario for the ultimate fate of the universe, in which the expansion of the universe eventually reverses and the universe recollapses, ultimately causing the cosmic scale factor to reach absolute zero, an event potentially followed by a reformation of the universe starting with another Big Bang. The vast majority of evidence, however, indicates that this hypothesis is not correct. Instead, astronomical observations show that the expansion of the universe is accelerating rather than being slowed by gravity, suggesting that a Big Freeze is much more likely to occur. Nonetheless, some physicists have proposed that a &quot;Big Crunch-style&quot; event could result from a dark energy fluctuation.

The hypothesis dates back to 1922, with Russian physicist Alexander Friedmann creating a set of equations showing that the end of the universe depends on its density. It could either expand or contract rather than stay stable. With enough matter, gravity could stop the universe&#x27;s expansion and eventually reverse it. This reversal would result in the universe collapsing on itself, not too dissimilar to a black hole.

The ending of the Big Crunch would get filled with radiation from stars and high-energy particles; when this is condensed and blueshifted to higher energy, it would be intense enough to ignite the surface of stars before they collide. In the final moments, the universe would be one large fireball with a near-infinite temperature, and at the absolute end, neither time, nor space would remain.

== Overview ==

The Big Crunch scenario hypothesized that the density of matter throughout the universe is sufficiently high that gravitational attraction will overcome the expansion that began with the Big Bang. The FLRW cosmology can predict whether the expansion will eventually stop based on the average energy density, Hubble parameter, and cosmological constant. If the expansion stopped, then contraction will inevitably follow, accelerating as time passes and finishing the universe in a kind of gravitational collapse,
turning the universe into a black hole.

Experimental evidence in the late 1990s and early 2000s (namely the observation of distant supernovas as standard candles; and the well-resolved mapping of the cosmic microwave background) led to the conclusion that the expansion of the universe is not getting slowed by gravity but is instead accelerating. The 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to researchers who contributed to this discovery.

The Big Crunch hypothesis also leads into another hypothesis known as the Big Bounce, in which after the big crunch destroys the universe, it does a sort of bounce, causing another big bang. This could potentially repeat forever in a phenomenon known as a cyclic universe.

Richard Bentley, a churchman and scholar, sent a letter to Isaac Newton in preparation for a lecture on Newton&#x27;s theories and the rejection of atheism:

If we&#x27;re in a finite universe and all stars attract each other together, would they not all collapse to a singular point, and if we&#x27;re in an infinite universe with infinite stars, would infinite forces in every direction not affect all of those stars?

This question is known as Bentley&#x27;s paradox, an early predecessor of the Big Crunch. It is now known, however, that stars move around and are not static.

=== Einstein&#x27;s cosmological constant ===
Albert Einstein favored an unchanging model of the universe. He collaborated in 1917 with Dutch astronomer Willem de Sitter to help demonstrate that the theory of general relativity would work with a static model; Willem demonstrated that his equations could describe a very simple universe. Finding no problems initially, scientists adapted the model to describe the universe. They ran into a different form of Bentley&#x27;s paradox.

The theory of general relativity also described the universe as restless. Einstein realized that for a static universe to exist—which was observed at the time—an anti-gravity would be needed to counter the gravity contracting the universe together, adding an extra force that would ruin the equations in the theory of relativity. In the end, the cosmological constant, the name for the anti-gravity force, was added to the theory of relativity.

==== Discovery of Hubble&#x27;s law ====
Edwin Hubble working in the Mount Wilson Observatory took measurements of the distances of galaxies and paired them with Vesto Silpher and Milton Humason&#x27;s measurements of red shifts associated with those galaxies. He discovered a rough proportionality between the red shift of an object and its distance. Hubble plotted a trend line from 46 galaxies, studying and obtaining the Hubble Constant, which he deduced to be 500 km/s/Mpc, nearly seven times than what it is considered today, but still giving the proof that the universe was expanding and was not a static object.

==== Abandonment of the cosmological constant ====
After Hubble&#x27;s discovery was published, Einstein abandoned the cosmological constant. In their simplest form, the equations generated a model of the universe that expanded or contracted. Contradicting what was observed, hence the creation of the cosmological constant. After the confirmation that the universe was expanding, Einstein called his assumption that the universe was static his &quot;biggest mistake&quot;. In 1931, Einstein visited Hubble to thank him for &quot;providing the basis of modern cosmology&quot;. After this discovery, Einstein&#x27;s and Newton&#x27;s models of a contracting, yet static universe were dropped for the expanding universe model.

== Cyclic universes ==
A hypothesis called &quot;Big Bounce&quot; proposes that the universe could collapse to the state where it began and then initiate another Big Bang, so in this way, the universe would last forever but would pass through phases of expansion (Big Bang) and contraction (Big Crunch). This means that there may be a universe in a state of constant Big Bangs and Big Crunches.

Cyclic universes were briefly considered by Albert Einstein in 1931. He hypothesized that there was a universe before the Big Bang, which ended in a Big Crunch, which could create a Big Bang as a reaction. Our universe could be in a cycle of expansion and contraction, a cycle possibly going on infinitely.

=== Ekpyrotic model ===

There are more modern models of Cyclic universes as well. The Ekpyrotic model, formed by Paul Steinhardt, states that the Big Bang could have been caused by two parallel orbifold planes, referred to as branes colliding in a higher-dimensional space. The four-dimension universe lies on one of the branes. The collision corresponds to the Big Crunch, then a Big Bang. The matter and radiation around us today are quantum fluctuations from before the branes. After several billion years, the universe has reached its modern state, and it will start contracting in another several billion years. Dark energy corresponds to the force between the branes, allowing for problems, like the flatness and monopole in the previous models to be fixed. The cycles can also go infinitely into the past and the future, and an attractor allows for a complete history of the universe.

This fixes the problem of the earlier model of the universe going into heat death from entropy buildup. The new model avoids this with a net expansion after every cycle, stopping entropy buildup. There are still some flaws in this model, however. The basis of the model, branes, are still not understood completely by string theorists, and the possibility that the scale invariant spectrum could be destroyed from the big crunch. While cosmic inflation and the general character of the forces—or the collision of the branes in the Ekpyrotic model—required to make vacuum fluctuations is known. A candidate from particle physics is missing.

=== Conformal Cyclic Cosmology (CCC) model ===

Physicist Roger Penrose advanced a general relativity-based theory called the conformal cyclic cosmology in which the universe expands until all the matter decays and is turned to light. Since nothing in the universe would have any time or distance scale associated with it, it becomes identical with the Big Bang (resulting in a type of Big Crunch that becomes the next Big Bang, thus starting the next cycle). Penrose and Gurzadyan suggested that signatures of conformal cyclic cosmology could potentially be found in the cosmic microwave background; as of 2020, these have not been detected.

There are also some flaws with this model as well: skeptics pointed out that in order to match up an infinitely large universe to an infinitely small universe, that all particles must lose their mass when the universe gets old. Penrose presented evidence of CCC in the form of rings that had uniform temperature in the CMB, the idea being that these rings would be the signature in our aeon—An aeon being the current cycle of the universe that we&#x27;re in—was caused by spherical gravitational waves caused by colliding black holes from our previous aeon.

=== Loop quantum cosmology (LQC) ===
Loop quantum cosmology is a model of the universe that proposes a &quot;quantum-bridge&quot; between expanding and contracting universes. In this model quantum geometry creates a brand-new force that is negligible at low spacetime curvature, but that rises very rapidly in the Planck regime, overwhelming classical gravity and resolving singularities of general relativity. Once the singularities are resolved the conceptual paradigm of cosmology changes, forcing one to revisit the standard issues—such as the horizon problem—from a new perspective.

Under this model, due to quantum geometry, the Big Bang is replaced by the Big Bounce with no assumptions or any fine tuning. The approach of effective dynamics has been used extensively in loop quantum cosmology to describe physics at the Planck scale, and also the beginning of the universe. Numerical simulations have confirmed the validity of effective dynamics, which provides a good approximation of the full loop quantum dynamics. It has been shown when states have very large quantum fluctuations at late times, meaning they do not lead to macroscopic universes as described by general relativity, but the effective dynamics departs from quantum dynamics near bounce and the later universe. In this case, the effective dynamics will overestimate the density at bounce, but it will still capture qualitative aspects extremely well.

== Empirical scenarios from physical theories ==
If a form of quintessence driven by a scalar field evolving down a monotonically decreasing potential that passes sufficiently below zero is the (main) explanation of dark energy and current data (in particular observational constraints on dark energy) is true as well, the accelerating expansion of the Universe would inverse to contraction within the cosmic near-future of the next 100 million years. According to an Andrei-Ijjas-Steinhardt study, the scenario fits &quot;naturally with cyclic cosmologies and recent conjectures about quantum gravity&quot;. The study suggests that the slow contraction phase would &quot;endure for a period of order 1 billion y before the universe transitions to a new phase of expansion&quot;.

==Effects==
Paul Davies considered a scenario in which the Big Crunch happens about 100 billion years from the present. In his model, the contracting universe would evolve roughly like the expanding phase in reverse. First, galaxy clusters, and then galaxies, would merge, and the temperature of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) would begin to rise as CMB photons get blueshifted. Stars would eventually become so close together that they begin to collide with each other. Once the CMB becomes hotter than M-type stars (about 500,000 years before the Big Crunch in Davies&#x27; model), they would no longer be able to radiate away their heat and would cook themselves until they evaporate; this continues for successively hotter stars until O-type stars boil away about 100,000 years before the Big Crunch. In the last minutes, the temperature of the universe would be so great that atoms and atomic nuclei would break up and get sucked up into already coalescing black holes. At the time of the Big Crunch, all the matter in the universe would be crushed into an infinitely hot, infinitely dense singularity similar to the Big Bang. The Big Crunch may be followed by another Big Bang, creating a new universe.

==In culture==
In &quot;The Restaurant at the End of the Universe&quot;, a novel by Douglas Adams, the concept is that a restaurant, Milliways, is set up to allow patrons to observe the end of the Universe, or &quot;Gnab Gib&quot;, as it is referred to, as they dine. The term is sometimes used in the mainstream, for example (as &quot;gnaB giB&quot;) in &quot;Physics I For Dummies&quot; and in a posting discussing the Big Crunch.

<doc id="206124" wikidata="Q357176" url="?curid=206124" title="John Scofield">
<text>John Scofield (born December 26, 1951) is an American guitarist and composer. His music over a long career has blended jazz, jazz fusion, funk, blues, soul and rock. He first came to mainstream attention as part of the band of Miles Davis; he has toured and recorded with many prominent jazz artists including saxophonists Eddie Harris, Dave Liebman, Joe Henderson, and Joe Lovano; keyboardists George Duke, Joey DeFrancesco, Herbie Hancock, Larry Goldings, and Robert Glasper; fellow guitarists Pat Metheny, John Abercrombie, Pat Martino, and Bill Frisell; bassists Marc Johnson and Jaco Pastorius; and drummers Billy Cobham and Dennis Chambers. Outside the world of jazz, he has collaborated with Phil Lesh, Mavis Staples, John Mayer, Medeski Martin &amp; Wood, and Gov&#x27;t Mule.

==Biography==
John Scofield was born in Dayton, Ohio; his family moved to Wilton, Connecticut, where he discovered his interest in music. Educated at the Berklee College of Music, Scofield left school to record with Chet Baker and Gerry Mulligan. He joined the Billy Cobham/George Duke Band soon afterwards and played, recorded, and toured with them for two years. He recorded with Charles Mingus in 1976 and replaced Pat Metheny in Gary Burton&#x27;s quartet.

In 1976, Scofield signed with Enja, which released his first album, &quot;John Scofield&quot;, in 1977. He recorded with pianist Hal Galper on &quot;Rough House&quot; in 1978 and then on Galper&#x27;s album &quot;Ivory Forest&quot; (1980), where he played a solo rendition of &quot;Monk&#x27;s Mood&quot; by Thelonious Monk. In 1979 he formed a trio with his mentor Steve Swallow and Adam Nussbaum which, with drummer Bill Stewart replacing Nussbaum, became the signature group of Scofield&#x27;s career.

In 1982, he joined Miles Davis, with whom he remained for three and a half years. He contributed tunes and guitar to three of Davis&#x27;s albums, &quot;Star People&quot;, &quot;Decoy&quot;, and &quot;You&#x27;re Under Arrest&quot;. After he left Davis, he released &quot;Electric Outlet&quot; (1984) and &quot;Still Warm&quot; (1985)

He began what is referred to as his Blue Matter Band, with Dennis Chambers on drums, Gary Grainger on bass, and Mitchel Forman, Robert Aries, or Jim Beard on keyboards. The band released the albums &quot;Blue Matter&quot;, &quot;Loud Jazz&quot; and &quot;Pick Hits Live&quot;. Marc Johnson formed Bass Desires with Peter Erskine, Bill Frisell, and Scofield. This &quot;most auspicious [pairing] since John McLaughlin and Carlos Santana&quot; recorded two albums, &quot;Bass Desires&quot; (1986) and &quot;Second Sight&quot; (1987).

At the beginning of the 1990s, Scofield formed a quartet which included Joe Lovano with whom he recorded several albums for Blue Note. &quot;Time on My Hands&quot; (1990), with Joe Lovano, Charlie Haden, and Jack DeJohnette, showcased Scofield&#x27;s guitar and Mingus-influenced (Charles Mingus) writing. Bill Stewart became the group&#x27;s drummer and played on &quot;Meant to Be&quot; (1991) and &quot;What We Do&quot; (1993). In 1992, Scofield released &quot;Grace Under Pressure&quot;, featuring guitarist Bill Frisell, with Charlie Haden on bass and Joey Baron on drums. Stewart rejoined Scofield and Steve Swallow for &quot;I Can See Your House from Here&quot;, a collaboration with Pat Metheny.

Near the end of the time he played with Blue Note, Scofield returned to a sound which included more funk and soul jazz. In 1994 and 1995, he formed a group with organist/pianist Larry Goldings, bassist Dennis Irwin, and alternating drummers, Bill Stewart and Idris Muhammad. The group toured extensively, and the albums &quot;Hand Jive&quot; and &quot;Groove Elation&quot; feature this funk/groove/soul-jazz dimension in Scofield&#x27;s music with tenor saxophonist Eddie Harris, percussionist Don Alias, and trumpeter Randy Brecker. He recorded the 1997 album &quot;A Go Go&quot; with avant-garde jazz trio Medeski, Martin &amp; Wood.

Also during that time he began to work with British composer Mark-Anthony Turnage. He appeared as a soloist on Turnage&#x27;s &quot;Blood on the Floor: Elegy for Andy&quot;. They collaborated on &quot;Scorched&quot;, an album of Turnage&#x27;s orchestrations of Scofield&#x27;s compositions, largely from the &quot;Blue Matter&quot; period. John Patitucci and Peter Erskine performed at the live premiere of &quot;Scorched&quot; at the Alte Oper in Frankfurt in September 2002 with the Radio-Symphony-Orchestra Frankfurt and the hr-Bigband. The performance was recorded and released by Deutsche Grammophon.

Scofield released &quot;Überjam&quot; in 2002 and &quot;Up All Night&quot; in 2003, two albums on which he experimented with drum and bass. He recorded in Europe with the Bugge Wesseltoft New Conception of Jazz in 2001–2002 and 2006. In 2004 &quot;&quot; was released with Steve Swallow on bass and Bill Stewart on drums. It was recorded live at the Blue Note Jazz Club in New York City in December 2003. That was followed the next year by &quot;That&#x27;s What I Say: John Scofield Plays the Music of Ray Charles&quot; which led to performances with Mavis Staples, Gary Versace on organ, John Benitez on bass, and Steve Hass on drums. After sitting in for two engagements in December 2005 with Phil Lesh and Friends, Scofield has played numerous shows with the band.
On September 26, 2006, he released &quot;Out Louder&quot;, his second collaboration with Medeski, Martin &amp; Wood. The group, known collectively as MSMW, toured worldwide in 2006 and 2007. Scofield performed in a duo with John Medeski named The Johns and in a trio with Medeski and drummer Adam Deitch (Deitch is also a producer). He recorded music inspired by gospel on the 2009 album &quot;Piety Street&quot; with Jon Cleary and George Porter Jr.

On September 18, 2007, EmArcy released &quot;This Meets That&quot;, an album recorded with Steve Swallow, Bill Stewart, and a horn trio. In 2011 EmArcy released &quot;A Moment&#x27;s Peace&quot;, recorded with pianist Larry Goldings, bassist Scott Colley, and drummer Brian Blade. Scofield&#x27;s 2010 album &quot;54&quot; had its origin in the 1990s when Vince Mendoza asked him to play on Mendoza&#x27;s first album. As director of the Metropole Orchestra, Mendoza collaborated with Scofield on arrangements of Scofield&#x27;s compositions that were performed by the orchestra.

Scofield has been an adjunct faculty member in the Jazz Department in the Steinhardt School of Education at New York University. &quot;Inside Scofield&quot;, a film by Joerg Steineck, a feature-length documentary about Scofield, was released in 2022.

==Guitars==
Scofield&#x27;s first electric guitar was a Hagstrom; his &quot;workhorse&quot; is an Ibanez AS200 from 1982. He endorses Ibanez and the company has a line of semi-hollow bodied guitars named for him. Steve Vai uses one on the road, for one of the songs from &quot;Inviolate&quot;.
