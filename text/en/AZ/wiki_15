<text>William O. Darby (February 8, 1911 – April 30, 1945) was a career United States Army officer who fought in World War II, where he was killed in action at age 34 in Italy. He was posthumously promoted to brigadier general. Darby was the founding commander of the First Ranger Battalion, which evolved into the United States Army Rangers. He was subsequently portrayed by James Garner in the 1958 theatrical film about Darby&#x27;s career titled &quot;Darby&#x27;s Rangers&quot;, which was also the title of his memoir, the source for many of his exploits.

==Early military career==

William O. Darby graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1933. where he was the cadet captain of &quot;I&quot; Company. His fellow classmate, William H Baumer, would later co-author the book &quot;Darby&#x27;s Rangers, We Led the Way&quot; with Darby.

Darby&#x27;s first assignment was as assistant executive and supply officer with the 82nd Field Artillery at Fort Bliss, Texas. In July 1934, he transferred to Cloudcroft, New Mexico, where he commanded the 1st Cavalry Division detachment. He received intensive artillery training from September 1937 to June 1938 while attending Field Artillery School at Fort Sill, Oklahoma.

On September 9, 1940, Darby was promoted to captain and subsequently served with the 80th Division at Camp Jackson, South Carolina; Fort Benning, Georgia; Camp Beauregard, Louisiana; and Fort Des Moines, Iowa.

==World War II==
===Army Rangers===
As World War II progressed, Darby saw rapid promotion to the grade of lieutenant colonel. He was with the first United States combat troops sent to Europe after the United States entry into World War II, the 34th Infantry Division, a National Guard unit known as the Red Bull. During its stay in Northern Ireland Darby became interested in the British Commandos. On June 19, 1942, the 1st Ranger Battalion was sanctioned, and Darby was put in charge of their recruitment and training under the Commandos in Achnacarry. Many of these original Rangers were volunteers from the 34th. In November 1942, the 1st Ranger Battalion made its first assault at Arzew, Algeria.

Darby was awarded the Silver Star for his actions in Tunisia on February 12, 1943:

Darby was subsequently awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for his actions on March 21–25. The citation stated:

&quot;Darby&#x27;s Rangers&quot; saw further action during the Allied invasion of Sicily kicking off the Italian Campaign. Darby received an oak leaf cluster to his Distinguished Service Cross for extraordinary heroism in July 1943 in Sicily:

Darby took part in the Allied invasion of the Italian mainland in September 1943, and was promoted to full colonel on December 11. The three existing Ranger battalions were effectively wiped out - killed or captured - in the disastrous Battle of Cisterna during the Anzio campaign in early February 1944, after which they were disbanded.

===179th Infantry command===
Darby was then put in command of the 179th Infantry Regiment, still fighting the battle of Anzio. He served with it from February 18 to April 2, 1944, before being called back to the US ahead of the Allied breakthrough in the Italian Campaign.

===Reassignment stateside===
Darby was ordered to Washington, D.C. for duty with the Army Ground Forces and later with the War Department General Staff at The Pentagon.

===Return to Europe===
In March 1945, Darby returned to Italy for an observation tour with five-star General of the Army Henry H. Arnold. On April 23, 1945, Brigadier General Robinson E. Duff, Assistant Division Commander of the 10th Mountain Division, was wounded; Darby took over for Duff. &quot;Task Force Darby&quot; spearheaded the breakout of the Fifth United States Army from the Po River valley bridgehead during the Spring 1945 offensive in Italy and reached Torbole at the head of Lake Garda.

== Death ==

On April 30, 1945, while Darby was issuing orders for the attack on Trento to cut off a German retreat, an artillery shell burst in the middle of the assembled officers and NCOs, killing Darby and a regimental Sergeant Major, John &quot;Tim&quot; Evans, and wounding several others. &quot;Task Force Darby&quot; continued with their mission. Two days later, on May 2, 1945, all German forces in Italy surrendered.

Darby, aged 34 at the time of his death, was posthumously promoted to brigadier general on May 15, 1945. He was buried in Cisterna, Italy. He was reinterred at Fort Smith National Cemetery in Fort Smith, Arkansas on March 11, 1949.

<text>Rimae Sirsalis is a lunar rille. It is located at and is 426 km long. It was formed by extension of the surface, possibly due to dike propagation in the subsurface.

Rimae Sirsalis cuts across highlands almost exclusively. It starts at the edge of Oceanus Procellarum near the modest crater Sirsalis from which it gets its name and proceeds directly away from the mare, eventually ending up among the cracks in the floor of the crater Darwin. Along the way it passes through craters, ranges of hills, and other small rilles.

<text>The Theosophical Society (Pasadena) is a branch of Theosophy based in Pasadena, California. It claims to be the successor organization to the original Theosophical Society founded by Helena Petrovna Blavatsky and others in 1875 in New York City. It is the second largest Theosophical group in members and international reach after the Theosophical Society Adyar.

It traces its roots to the line of William Quan Judge established Leader in 1895 was recognized by a portion of The Society after Blavatsky&#x27;s death due to a dispute surrounding Annie Besant regarding the existence of The Masters. The juxtaposed positions are put as this: he was either &quot;faithful to the teachings of the Mahatmas&quot; (the stance of the modern Pasadena organization) or as Besant claimed, had forged the letters claiming them to be from the Mahatmas (the stance of the modern Adyar organization). The corresponding faction led by Henry Steel Olcott and Annie Besant, whose organization, based in India, is known today as the Theosophical Society - Adyar.

Judge led the American group for nearly a year prior to his sudden death in 1896 while traveling across India, at which time Katherine Tingley became Leader. Although initially supported by Ernest Temple Hargorve, he and a group of roughly 200 members disputed Tingley&#x27;s leadership chose to secede and formed a new faction of the Brotherhood, dubbed the Theosophical Society in America (Hargrove). In 1900 Tingley moved the Theosophical Society&#x27;s headquarters from New York City to Lomaland at Point Loma, San Diego located in Southern California. It later moved to Covina in Los Angeles County in 1942, and finally found a home in Altadena, California in 1945.

Max Heindel was vice president during 1904 and 1905. Leaders of The Theosophical Society Pasadena have included Gottfried de Purucker, 1929–42; Arthur L. Conger, 1945-51; James A. Long (1951-1971); Grace Knoche (1971-2006); and Randell Grubb (since 2006).

The Theosophical Society of Pasadena devotes the majority of their time in the furthering of the realization of the Divine Wisdom. Making available the majority of Theosophical texts available online via their online location 

In January 2025, the Theosophical Library Center in Pasadena was destroyed in the Eaton Fire.

<text>The United Lodge of Theosophists or ULT is an informal and wholly voluntary association of students of Theosophy. It was founded in 1909, mainly through the efforts of Robert Crosbie. The first parent lodge of the ULT was started in Los Angeles by Robert Crosbie and seven other associates through the adoption of its Declaration on February 18, 1909. Owing largely to the revival efforts of B.P. Wadia after Crosbie&#x27;s death, there are currently about twenty active lodges spread all over the world. The ULT is considered to be part of the second generation or the third section of the Theosophical Movement started in 1875 by H.P. Blavatsky in New York. Presently, it is also one of the existing four main &quot;branches&quot; of the original Theosophical Movement. The following founding principles when taken as a whole, sets apart the ULT from the other Theosophical Organizations:
ULT Los Angeles publishes the &quot;Theosophy Magazine&quot; which was started by Robert Crosbie in 1912. It was the revival of an earlier periodical called &quot;The Path&quot; that was edited by W.Q. Judge. ULT India publishes the &quot;Theosophical Movement Magazine&quot;, founded under B.P. Wadia in 1930 in Mumbai. ULT Santa Barbara publishes a quarterly periodical called Vidya, and uses Concord Grove Press to publish theosophical texts including a pamphlet series on themes from &quot;The Secret Doctrine&quot;. The Theosophy Company was registered in 1925 on behalf of ULT as a fiduciary agent and an eleemosynary, non-profit corporation to publish photographic facsimile of the Original Editions of books by H.P. Blavatsky and W.Q. Judge.

== History ==

The history of ULT began with Robert Crosbie coming in contact with H.P. Blavatsky in 1887 and his subsequent association with the Theosophical Society or TS in Boston. Based on H.P. Blavatsky&#x27;s instructions, he placed himself under the direct guidance of W.Q. Judge. Following the death of the original founders of the movement, Robert Crosbie was witness to the ensuing rivalries around &quot;leadership&quot;, &quot;authority&quot; and &quot;succession&quot; surrounding Katherine Tingley, who headed the American section and Annie Besant, who headed the international section from India. Initially, Robert Crosbie gave his support to Katherine Tingley and went to Point Loma in 1900 to be of assistance there. However, by 1904, he felt the original teachings of Theosophy were almost completely eclipsed by Katherine Tingley&#x27;s sensational programs. Convinced that further effort was futile, he quietly left Point Loma and moved to Los Angeles. By February 1909, he had gathered around him seven individuals as part of a study group, four of whom were new to Theosophy. This nucleus, under Robert Crosbie&#x27;s guidance, set to the task of restoring Theosophy along the original lines of its founders without organizational distractions. In the meantime, the original 1888 version of The Secret Doctrine was out of print and replaced by Annie Besant&#x27;s &quot;Third and Revised Edition&quot;. This edition was found to contain tens of thousands of alterations and major distortions. This and other material that diverged significantly from H.P. Blavatsky&#x27;s original presentation was denominated Neo-Theosophy. Robert Crosbie denounced Neo-Theosophy and considered it along with other leadership claims and rivalries in the Theosophical Society to be the result of the accentuation of &quot;personality&quot;, in the Theosophical sense of the lower or illusionary self. Hence the Declaration of the ULT was drawn to emphasize an &quot;impersonal&quot;, self-reliant, non-hierarchical, non-organizational spirit and loyalty to the original founders and their &quot;unaltered&quot; message.

In November 1919, five months after Robert Crosbie&#x27;s death, B.P Wadia, a predominant member of the Theosophical Society Adyar visited America and happened to come across ULT Los Angeles. There he discovered the works of W.Q. Judge who was considered a renegade by the Theosophical Society under Annie Besant and Col. Olcott. Furthermore, he found the reformation he was seeking of the Theosophical Society in ULT&#x27;s Declaration of purpose and its mission of &quot;pure Theosophy&quot; without organizational distractions. He then went back to India with the hope of changing the attitude of the leaders of the Theosophical Society, to return to the original teachings, set right the wrong that was done to W.Q. Judge and mend the schism in the Theosophical Movement. Finding that his efforts were unsuccessful, he resigned from the Theosophical Society on 18 July 1922 and joined the ULT. Between 1922 and 1928, he stayed in America and founded ULT lodges in New York, Washington D.C., and Philadelphia. And on his return trip to India via Europe, he established ULT lodges in Antwerp, Amsterdam, London, and Paris. Back in India, he started ULT lodges in Mumbai and Bengaluru.

<text>The hen harrier (Circus cyaneus) is a bird of prey. It breeds in Eurasia. The term &quot;hen harrier&quot; refers to its former habit of preying on free-ranging fowl.

It migrates to more southerly areas in winter. Eurasian birds move to southern Europe and southern temperate Asia. In the mildest regions, such as France and Great Britain, hen harriers may be present all year, but the higher ground is largely deserted in winter.

The northern harrier was formerly considered to be a subspecies of the hen harrier.

==Taxonomy==
In 1758 the English naturalist George Edwards included an illustration and a description of the hen harrier in the first volume of his &quot;Gleanings of Natural History&quot;. He used the English name &quot;The blue hawk&quot;. Edwards based his hand-coloured etching on a bird that had been shot near London. When in 1766 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; for the twelfth edition, he placed the hen harrier with the falcons and eagles in the genus &quot;Falco&quot;. Linnaeus included a brief description, coined the binomial name &quot;Falco cyaneus&quot; and cited Edwards&#x27; work. The hen harrier is now placed in the genus &quot;Circus&quot; that was introduced by the French naturalist Bernard Germain de Lacépède in 1799. The genus name &quot;Circus&quot; is derived from the Ancient Greek &quot;kirkos&quot;, referring to a bird of prey named for its circling flight (&quot;kirkos&quot;, &quot;circle&quot;). The specific epithet &quot;cyaneus&quot; is from Latin and means &quot;dark blue&quot;. The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.

The hen harrier was formerly considered to be conspecific with the northern harrier.

==Description==

The hen harrier is long with a wingspan. It resembles other harriers in having distinct male and female plumages. The sexes also differ in weight, with males weighing , with an average of , and females weighing , with an average of . Among standard measurements, the wing chord is , the tail is and the tarsus is . It is relatively long winged and long tailed.

The male is mainly grey above and white below except for the upper breast, which is grey like the upperparts, and the rump, which is white; the wings are grey with black wingtips. The female is brown above with white upper tail coverts, hence females, and the similar juveniles, are often called &quot;ringtails&quot;. Their underparts are buff streaked with brown. Immatures look like females but with less distinct barring, dark brown secondaries dark brown and less-streaked belly.

The female gives a whistled &quot;piih-eh&quot; when receiving food from the male, and her alarm call is &quot;chit-it-it-it-it-et-it&quot;. The male calls &quot;chek-chek-chek&quot;, with a more bouncing &quot;chuk-uk-uk-uk&quot; during his display flight.

==Behaviour==
This medium-sized raptor breeds on moorland, bogs, prairies, farmland coastal prairies, marshes, grasslands, swamps and other assorted open areas. A male will maintain a territory averaging , though male territories have ranged from .

These are one of the few raptorial birds known to practice polygyny – one male mates with several females. Up to five females have been known to mate with one male in a season. A supplementary feeding experiment on the Orkney islands showed that rates of polygyny were influenced by food levels; males provided with extra food had more breeding females than &#x27;control&#x27; males that received no extra food.

The nest is built on the ground or on a mound of dirt or vegetation. Nests are made of sticks and are lined inside with grass and leaves. Four to eight (exceptionally 2 to 10) whitish eggs are laid. The eggs measure approximately . The eggs are incubated mostly by the female for 31 to 32 days. When incubating eggs, the female sits on the nest while the male hunts and brings food to her and the chicks. The male will help feed chicks after they hatch, but does not usually watch them for a greater period of time than around 5 minutes. The male usually passes off food to the female, which she then feeds to the young, although later the female will capture food and simply drop into the nest for her nestlings to eat. The chicks fledge at around 36 days old, though breeding maturity is not reached until 2 years in females and 3 years in males.

In winter, the hen harrier is a bird of open country, and will then roost communally, often with merlins and marsh harriers. There is now an accepted record of transatlantic vagrancy by the northern harrier, with a juvenile being recorded in Scilly, Great Britain from October 1982 to June 1983.

===Hunting behaviour===
This is a typical harrier, which hunts on long wings held in a shallow V in its low flight during which the bird closely hugs the contours of the land below it. Northern or hen harriers hunt primarily small mammals, as do most harriers. Up to 95% of the diet comprises small mammals. However, birds are hunted with some regularity as well, especially by males. Preferred avian prey include passerines of open country (i.e. sparrows, larks, pipits), small shorebirds and the young of waterfowl and galliforms. Supplementing the diet occasionally are amphibians (especially frogs), reptiles and insects (especially orthopterans). The species has been observed to hunt bats if these are available. Larger prey, such as rabbits and adult ducks are taken sometimes and harriers have been known to subdue these by drowning them in water. Harriers hunt by surprising prey while flying low to the ground in open areas, as they drift low over fields and moors. The harriers circle an area several times listening and looking for prey. Harriers use hearing regularly to find prey, as they have exceptionally good hearing for diurnal raptors, this being the function of their owl-like facial disc. This harrier tends to be a very vocal bird while it glides over its hunting ground.

===Mortality and competition===
Little information is available on longevity in hen harriers. The longest-lived known bird is 16 years and 5 months. However, adults rarely live more than 8 years. Early mortality mainly results from predation. Predators of eggs and nestlings include raccoons, skunks, badgers, foxes, crows and ravens, dogs and owls. Both parents attack potential predators with alarm calls and striking with talons. Short-eared owls are natural competitors of this species that favor the same prey and habitat, as well as having a similarly broad distribution. Occasionally, both harriers and short-eared owls will harass each other until the victim drops its prey and it can be stolen, a practice known as kleptoparasitism. Most commonly, the harriers are the aggressors pirating prey from owls.

==Status==
This species has a large range. There is evidence of a population decline, but the species is not believed to be approaching the thresholds for the population decline criterion of the IUCN Red List (i.e., declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations). It is therefore classified as &quot;least concern&quot;. In Britain and Ireland, however, hen harrier populations are in a critical condition, due to habitat loss and illegal killing on grouse moors. In England alone there is enough suitable habitat for over 300 pairs of breeding Hen Harriers but in 2022 there were only 34 successful nests. Furthermore, many of the young birds don’t even make it through their first year, let alone survive until the age of two, when they can first breed. Most UK Hen Harriers are in Scotland but even there its population declined by 27% between 2004 and 2016.

==Relationship with humans==
In some parts of Europe people believed that seeing a harrier perched on a house was a sign that three people would die. Unlike many raptors, hen harriers have historically been seen favorably by farmers because they eat predators of quail eggs and mice that damage crops. Harriers are sometimes called &quot;good hawks&quot; because they pose no threat to poultry as some hawks do.

==Forestry and hen harriers==

The hen harrier is a bird of open habitats such as heather moorland and extensive agriculture. However, much of its range, particularly in Ireland and parts of western Britain, has been (and continues to be) afforested, predominantly with non-native conifers such as Sitka spruce (&quot;Picea sitchensis&quot;) from North America. Hen harriers nest and forage in commercial forestry when it is young, before the canopy closes (typically at between 9 and 12 years old), but do not make much use of thicket and subsequent growth stages, which typically comprise between and of the commercial growth cycle. Where forests replace habitats that were used by hen harriers they will therefore tend to reduce overall habitat availability. However, where afforestation takes place in areas that were previously underutilised by hen harriers, it may increase the value of such areas to this species in the long-term. Areas dominated by forestry may remain suitable to hen harriers provided that a mosaic of age classes is maintained within the forest, such that areas of young, pre-thicket forest are always available.

<doc id="200732" wikidata="Q829348" url="?curid=200732" title="Spiritualism (movement)">
<text>Spiritualism is a social religious movement popular in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, according to which an individual&#x27;s awareness persists after death and may be contacted by the living. The afterlife, or the &quot;spirit world&quot;, is seen by spiritualists not as a static place, but as one in which spirits continue to interact and evolve. These two beliefs—that contact with spirits is possible, and that spirits are more advanced than humans—lead spiritualists to the belief that spirits are capable of advising the living on moral and ethical issues and the nature of God. Some spiritualists follow &quot;spirit guides&quot;—specific spirits relied upon for spiritual direction.

Emanuel Swedenborg has some claim to be the father of spiritualism. The movement developed and reached its largest following from the 1840s to the 1920s, especially in English-speaking countries. It flourished for a half century without canonical texts or formal organization, attaining cohesion through periodicals, tours by trance lecturers, camp meetings, and the missionary activities of accomplished mediums. Many prominent spiritualists were women, and like most spiritualists, supported causes such as the abolition of slavery and women&#x27;s suffrage. By the late 1880s the credibility of the informal movement had weakened due to accusations of fraud perpetrated by mediums, and formal spiritualist organizations began to appear. Spiritualism is currently practiced primarily through various denominational spiritualist churches in the U.S., Canada and the United Kingdom.

==Beliefs==
===Mediumship and spirits===
Spiritualists believe in the possibility of communication with the spirits of dead people, whom they regard as &quot;discarnate humans&quot;. They believe that spirit mediums are gifted to carry on such communication, but that anyone may become a medium through study and practice. They believe that spirits are capable of growth and perfection, progressing through higher spheres or planes, and that the afterlife is not a static state, but one in which spirits evolve. The two beliefs—that contact with spirits is possible, and that spirits may dwell on a higher plane—lead to a third belief, that spirits can provide knowledge about moral and ethical issues, as well as about God and the afterlife. Many believers therefore speak of &quot;spirit guides&quot;—specific spirits, often contacted, and relied upon for worldly and spiritual guidance.

According to spiritualists, anyone may receive spirit messages, but formal communication sessions (séances) are held by mediums, who claim thereby to receive information about the afterlife.

===Declaration of Principles===
As an informal movement, spiritualism does not have a defined set of rules, but various spiritualist organizations within the United States have adopted variations on some or all of a &quot;Declaration of Principles&quot; developed between 1899 and 1944. In October 1899, a six article &quot;Declaration of Principles&quot; was adopted by the National Spiritualist Association (NSA) at a convention in Chicago, Illinois. An additional two principles were added by the NSA in October 1909, at a convention in Rochester, New York. Then, in October 1944, a ninth principle was adopted by the National Spiritualist Association of Churches, at a convention in St. Louis, Missouri.

In the UK, the main organization representing spiritualism is the Spiritualists&#x27; National Union (SNU), whose teachings are based on the Seven Principles.

==Origins==
Spiritualism first appeared in the 1840s in the &quot;Burned-over District&quot; of upstate New York, where earlier religious movements such as Millerism and Mormonism had emerged during the Second Great Awakening, although Millerism and Mormonism did not associate themselves with spiritualism.

This region of New York State was an environment in which many thought direct communication with God or angels was possible, and that God would not behave harshly—for example, that God would not condemn unbaptised infants to an eternity in Hell.

===Swedenborg and Mesmer===
In this environment, the writings of Emanuel Swedenborg (1688–1772) and the teachings of Franz Mesmer (1734–1815) provided an example for those seeking direct personal knowledge of the afterlife. Swedenborg, who claimed to communicate with spirits while awake, described the structure of the spirit world. Two features of his view particularly resonated with the early spiritualists: first, that there is not a single Hell and a single Heaven, but rather a series of higher and lower heavens and hells; second, that spirits are intermediates between God and humans, so that the divine sometimes uses them as a means of communication. Although Swedenborg warned against seeking out spirit contact, his works seem to have inspired in others the desire to do so.

Swedenborg was formerly a highly regarded inventor and scientist, achieving several engineering innovations and studying physiology and anatomy. Then, &quot;in 1741, he also began to have a series of intense mystical experiences, dreams, and visions, claiming that he had been called by God to reform Christianity and introduce a new church.&quot;

Mesmer did not contribute religious beliefs, but he brought a technique, later known as hypnotism, that it was claimed could induce trances and cause subjects to report contact with supernatural beings. There was a great deal of professional showmanship inherent to demonstrations of Mesmerism, and the practitioners who lectured in mid-19th-century North America sought to entertain their audiences as well as to demonstrate methods for personal contact with the divine.

Perhaps the best known of those who combined Swedenborg and Mesmer in a peculiarly North American synthesis was Andrew Jackson Davis, who called his system the &quot;harmonial philosophy&quot;. Davis was a practising Mesmerist, faith healer and clairvoyant from Blooming Grove, New York. He was also strongly influenced by the socialist theories of Fourierism. His 1847 book, &quot;The Principles of Nature, Her Divine Revelations, and a Voice to Mankind&quot;, dictated to a friend while in a trance state, eventually became the nearest thing to a canonical work in a spiritualist movement whose extreme individualism precluded the development of a single coherent worldview.

===Reform-movement links===
Spiritualists often set March 31, 1848, as the beginning of their movement. On that date, Kate and Margaret Fox, of Hydesville, New York, reported that they had made contact with a spirit that was later claimed to be the spirit of a murdered peddler whose body was found in the house, though no record of such a person was ever found. The spirit was said to have communicated through rapping noises, audible to onlookers. The evidence of the senses appealed to practically minded Americans, and the Fox sisters became a sensation. As the first celebrity mediums, the sisters quickly became famous for their public séances in New York. However, in 1888 the Fox sisters admitted that this contact with the spirit was a hoax, though shortly afterward they recanted that admission.

Amy and Isaac Post, Hicksite Quakers from Rochester, New York, had long been acquainted with the Fox family, and took the two girls into their home in the late spring of 1848. Immediately convinced of the veracity of the sisters&#x27; communications, they became early converts and introduced the young mediums to their circle of radical Quaker friends.


Consequently, many early participants in spiritualism were radical Quakers and others involved in the mid-nineteenth-century reforming movement. These reformers were uncomfortable with the more mainstream churches because those churches did little to fight slavery and even less to advance the cause of women&#x27;s rights.

Such links with reform movements, often radically socialist, had already been prepared in the 1840s, as the example of Andrew Jackson Davis shows. After 1848, many socialists became ardent spiritualists or occultists.

The most popular trance lecturer prior to the American Civil War was Cora L. V. Scott (1840–1923). Young and beautiful, her appearance on stage fascinated men. Her audiences were struck by the contrast between her physical girlishness and the eloquence with which she spoke of spiritual matters, and found in that contrast support for the notion that spirits were speaking through her. Cora married four times, and on each occasion adopted her husband&#x27;s last name. During her period of greatest activity, she was known as Cora Hatch.

Another spiritualist was Achsa W. Sprague, who was born November 17, 1827, in Plymouth Notch, Vermont. At the age of 20, she became ill with rheumatic fever and credited her eventual recovery to intercession by spirits. An extremely popular trance lecturer, she traveled about the United States until her death in 1861. Sprague was an abolitionist and an advocate of women&#x27;s rights.

Another spiritualist and trance medium prior to the Civil War was Paschal Beverly Randolph (1825–1875), a man of mixed race, who also played a part in the abolitionist movement. Nevertheless, many abolitionists and reformers held themselves aloof from the spiritualist movement; among the skeptics was abolitionist Frederick Douglass.

Another social reform movement with significant spiritualist involvement was the effort to improve conditions of Native Americans. Kathryn Troy writes in a study of Indian ghosts in seances:

Undoubtedly, on some level spiritualists recognized the Indian spectres that appeared at seances as a symbol of the sins and subsequent guilt of the United States in its dealings with Native Americans. Spiritualists were literally haunted by the presence of Indians. But for many that guilt was not assuaged: rather, in order to confront the haunting and rectify it, they were galvanized into action. The political activism of spiritualists on behalf of Indians was thus the result of combining white guilt and fear of divine judgment with a new sense of purpose and responsibility.

===Believers and skeptics===
In the years following the sensation that greeted the Fox sisters, demonstrations of mediumship (séances and automatic writing, for example) proved to be a profitable venture, and soon became popular forms of entertainment and spiritual catharsis. The Fox sisters earned a living this way and others followed their lead. Showmanship became an increasingly important part of spiritualism, and the visible, audible, and tangible evidence of spirits escalated as mediums competed for paying audiences. As independent investigating commissions repeatedly established, most notably the 1887 report of the Seybert Commission, fraud was widespread, and some of these cases were prosecuted in the courts.

Despite numerous instances of chicanery, the appeal of spiritualism was strong. Prominent in the ranks of its adherents were those grieving the death of a loved one. Many families during the time of the American Civil War had seen their men go off and never return, and images of the battlefield, produced through the new medium of photography, demonstrated that their loved ones had not only died in overwhelmingly huge numbers, but horribly as well. One well known case is that of Mary Todd Lincoln who, grieving the loss of her son, organized séances in the White House which were attended by her husband, President Abraham Lincoln. The surge of Spiritualism during this time, and later during World War I, was a direct response to those massive battlefield casualties.

In addition, the movement appealed to reformers, who fortuitously found that the spirits favoured such causes &quot;du jour&quot; as abolition of slavery, and equal rights for women. It also appealed to some who had a materialist orientation and rejected organized religion. In 1854 the utopian socialist Robert Owen was converted to spiritualism after &quot;sittings&quot; with the American medium Maria B. Hayden (credited with introducing spiritualism to England); Owen made a public profession of his new faith in his publication &quot;The Rational Quarterly Review&quot; and later wrote a pamphlet, &quot;The future of the Human race; or great glorious and future revolution to be effected through the agency of departed spirits of good and superior men and women&quot;.

A number of scientists who investigated the phenomenon also became converts. They included chemist and physicist William Crookes (1832–1919), evolutionary biologist Alfred Russel Wallace (1823–1913) and physicist Sir Oliver Lodge. Nobel laureate Pierre Curie was impressed by the mediumistic performances of Eusapia Palladino and advocated their scientific study. Other prominent adherents included journalist and pacifist William T. Stead (1849–1912) and physician and author Arthur Conan Doyle (1859–1930).

Doyle, who lost his son Kingsley in World War I, was also a member of the Ghost Club. Founded in London in 1862, its focus was the scientific study of alleged paranormal activities in order to prove (or refute) the existence of paranormal phenomena. Members of the club included Charles Dickens, Sir William Crookes, Sir William F. Barrett, and Harry Price. The Paris séances of Eusapia Palladino were attended by an enthusiastic Pierre Curie and a dubious Marie Curie. Thomas Edison wanted to develop a &quot;spirit phone&quot;, an ethereal device that would summon to the living the voices of the dead and record them for posterity.

The claims of spiritualists and others as to the reality of spirits were investigated by the Society for Psychical Research, founded in London in 1882. The society set up a Committee on Haunted Houses.

Prominent investigators who exposed cases of fraud came from a variety of backgrounds, including professional researchers such as Frank Podmore of the Society for Psychical Research and Harry Price of the National Laboratory of Psychical Research, and professional conjurers such as John Nevil Maskelyne. Maskelyne exposed the Davenport brothers by appearing in the audience during their shows and explaining how the trick was done.

The psychical researcher Hereward Carrington exposed fraudulent mediums&#x27; tricks, such as those used in slate-writing, table-turning, trumpet mediumship, materializations, sealed-letter reading, and spirit photography. The skeptic Joseph McCabe, in his book &quot;Is Spiritualism Based on Fraud?&quot; (1920), documented many fraudulent mediums and their tricks.

Magicians and writers on magic have a long history of exposing the fraudulent methods of mediumship. During the 1920s, professional magician Harry Houdini undertook a well-publicised campaign to expose fraudulent mediums; he was adamant that &quot;Up to the present time everything that I have investigated has been the result of deluded brains.&quot; Other magician or magic-author debunkers of spiritualist mediumship have included Chung Ling Soo, Henry Evans, Julien Proskauer, Fulton Oursler, Joseph Dunninger, and Joseph Rinn.

In February 1921 Thomas Lynn Bradford, in an experiment designed to ascertain the existence of an afterlife, committed suicide in his apartment by blowing out the pilot light on his heater and turning on the gas. After that date, no further communication from him was received by an associate whom he had recruited for the purpose.

===Unorganized movement===

The movement quickly spread throughout the world; though only in the United Kingdom did it become as widespread as in the United States. Spiritualist organizations were formed in America and Europe, such as the London Spiritualist Alliance, which published a newspaper called &quot;The Light&quot;, featuring articles such as &quot;Evenings at Home in Spiritual Séance&quot;, &quot;Ghosts in Africa&quot; and &quot;Chronicles of Spirit Photography&quot;, advertisements for &quot;mesmerists&quot; and patent medicines, and letters from readers about personal contact with ghosts. In Britain, by 1853, invitations to tea among the prosperous and fashionable often included table-turning, a type of séance in which spirits were said to communicate with people seated around a table by tilting and rotating the table. By 1897, spiritualism was said to have more than eight million followers in the United States and Europe, mostly drawn from the middle and upper classes.

Spiritualism was mainly a middle- and upper-class movement, and especially popular with women. American spiritualists would meet in private homes for séances, at lecture halls for trance lectures, at state or national conventions, and at summer camps attended by thousands. Among the most significant of the camp meetings were Camp Etna, in Etna, Maine; Onset Bay Grove, in Onset, Massachusetts; Lily Dale, in western New York State; Camp Chesterfield, in Indiana; the Wonewoc Spiritualist Camp, in Wonewoc, Wisconsin; and Lake Pleasant, in Montague, Massachusetts. In founding camp meetings, the spiritualists appropriated a form developed by U.S. Protestant denominations in the early nineteenth century. Spiritualist camp meetings were located most densely in New England, but were also established across the upper Midwest. Cassadaga, Florida, is the most notable spiritualist camp meeting in the southern states.

A number of spiritualist periodicals appeared in the nineteenth century, and these did much to hold the movement together. Among the most important were the weeklies the &quot;Banner of Light&quot; (Boston), the &quot;Religio-Philosophical Journal&quot; (Chicago), &quot;Mind and Matter&quot; (Philadelphia), the &quot;Spiritualist&quot; (London), and the &quot;Medium&quot; (London). Other influential periodicals were the &quot;Revue Spirite&quot; (France), &quot;Le Messager&quot; (Belgium), &quot;Annali dello Spiritismo&quot; (Italy), &quot;El Criterio Espiritista&quot; (Spain), and the &quot;Harbinger of Light&quot; (Australia). By 1880, there were about three dozen monthly spiritualist periodicals published around the world. These periodicals differed a great deal from one another, reflecting the great differences among spiritualists. Some, such as the British &quot;Spiritual Magazine&quot; were Christian and conservative, openly rejecting the reform currents so strong within spiritualism. Others, such as &quot;Human Nature&quot;, were pointedly non-Christian and supportive of socialism and reform efforts. Still others, such as the &quot;Spiritualist&quot;, attempted to view spiritualist phenomena from a scientific perspective, eschewing discussion on both theological and reform issues.

Books on the supernatural were published for the growing middle class, such as 1852&#x27;s &quot;Mysteries&quot;, by Charles Elliott, which contains &quot;sketches of spirits and spiritual things&quot;, including accounts of the Salem witch trials, the Lane ghost, and the Rochester rappings. &quot;The Night Side of Nature&quot;, by Catherine Crowe, published in 1853, provided definitions and accounts of wraiths, doppelgängers, apparitions and haunted houses.

Mainstream newspapers treated stories of ghosts and haunting as they would any other news story. An account in the &quot;Chicago Daily Tribune&quot; in 1891, &quot;sufficiently bloody to suit the most fastidious taste&quot;, tells of a house believed to be haunted by the ghosts of three murder victims seeking revenge against their killer&#x27;s son, who was eventually driven insane.

Many families, &quot;having no faith in ghosts&quot;, thereafter moved into the house, but all soon moved out again.

In the 1920s many &quot;psychic&quot; books were published of varied quality. Such books were often based on excursions initiated by the use of Ouija boards. A few of these popular books displayed unorganized spiritualism, though most were less insightful.

The movement was extremely individualistic, with each person relying on his or her own experiences and reading to discern the nature of the afterlife. Organisation was therefore slow to appear, and when it did it was resisted by mediums and trance lecturers. Most members were content to attend Christian churches, and particularly universalist churches harboured many spiritualists.

As the spiritualism movement began to fade, partly through the publicity of fraud accusations and partly through the appeal of religious movements such as Christian science, the Spiritualist Church was organised. This church can claim to be the main vestige of the movement left today in the United States.

===Other mediums===
London-born Emma Hardinge Britten (1823–99) moved to the United States in 1855 and was active in spiritualist circles as a trance lecturer and organiser. She is best known as a chronicler of the movement&#x27;s spread, especially in her 1884 &quot;Nineteenth Century Miracles: Spirits and Their Work in Every Country of the Earth&quot;, and her 1870 &quot;Modern American Spiritualism&quot;, a detailed account of claims and investigations of mediumship beginning with the earliest days of the movement.

William Stainton Moses (1839–92) was an Anglican clergyman who, in the period from 1872 to 1883, filled 24 notebooks with automatic writing, much of which was said to describe conditions in the spirit world. However, Frank Podmore was skeptical of his alleged ability to communicate with spirits and Joseph McCabe described Moses as a &quot;deliberate impostor&quot;, suggesting his apports and all of his feats were the result of trickery.

Eusapia Palladino (1854–1918) was an Italian spiritualist medium from the slums of Naples who made a career touring Italy, France, Germany, Britain, the United States, Russia and Poland. Palladino was said by believers to perform spiritualist phenomena in the dark: levitating tables, producing apports, and materializing spirits. On investigation, all these things were found to be products of trickery.

The British medium William Eglinton (1857–1933) claimed to perform spiritualist phenomena such as movement of objects and materializations. All of his feats were exposed as tricks.

The Bangs Sisters, Mary &quot;May&quot; E. Bangs (1862–1917) and Elizabeth &quot;Lizzie&quot; Snow Bangs (1859–1920), were two spiritualist mediums based in Chicago, who made a career out of painting the dead or &quot;spirit portraits&quot;.

Mina Crandon (1888–1941), a spiritualist medium in the 1920s, was known for producing an ectoplasm hand during her séances. The hand was later exposed as a trick when biologists found it to be made from a piece of carved animal liver. In 1934, the psychical researcher Walter Franklin Prince described the Crandon case as &quot;the most ingenious, persistent, and fantastic complex of fraud in the history of psychic research.&quot;

The American voice medium Etta Wriedt (1859–1942) was exposed as a fraud by the physicist Kristian Birkeland when he discovered that the noises produced by her trumpet were caused by chemical explosions induced by potassium and water and in other cases by lycopodium powder.

Another well-known medium was the Scottish materialization medium Helen Duncan (1897–1956). In 1928 photographer Harvey Metcalfe attended a series of séances at Duncan&#x27;s house and took flash photographs of Duncan and her alleged &quot;materialization&quot; spirits, including her spirit guide &quot;Peggy&quot;. The photographs revealed the &quot;spirits&quot; to have been fraudulently produced, using dolls made from painted papier-mâché masks, draped in old sheets. Duncan was later tested by Harry Price at the National Laboratory of Psychical Research; photographs revealed Duncan&#x27;s ectoplasm to be made from cheesecloth, rubber gloves, and cut-out heads from magazine covers.

==Evolution==
Spiritualists reacted with an uncertainty to the theories of evolution in the late 19th and early 20th century. Broadly speaking the concept of evolution fitted the spiritualist thought of the progressive development of humanity. At the same time, however, the belief in the animal origins of humanity threatened the foundation of the immortality of the spirit, for if humans had not been created by God, it was scarcely plausible that they would be specially endowed with spirits. This led to spiritualists embracing spiritual evolution.

The spiritualists&#x27; view of evolution did not stop at death. Spiritualism taught that after death spirits progressed to spiritual states in new spheres of existence. According to spiritualists, evolution occurred in the spirit world &quot;at a rate more rapid and under conditions more favourable to growth&quot; than encountered on earth.

In a talk at the London Spiritualist Alliance, John Page Hopps (1834–1911) supported both evolution and spiritualism. Hopps claimed humanity had started off imperfect &quot;out of the animal&#x27;s darkness&quot; but would rise into the &quot;angel&#x27;s marvellous light&quot;. Hopps claimed humans were not fallen but rising creatures and that after death they would evolve on a number of spheres of existence to perfection.

Theosophy is in opposition to the spiritualist interpretation of evolution. Theosophy teaches a metaphysical theory of evolution mixed with human devolution. Spiritualists do not accept the devolution of the theosophists. To theosophy, humanity starts in a state of perfection (see Golden age) and falls into a process of progressive materialization (devolution), developing the mind and losing the spiritual consciousness. After the gathering of experience and growth through repeated reincarnations humanity will regain the original spiritual state, which is now one of self-conscious perfection.

Theosophy and spiritualism were both very popular metaphysical schools of thought especially in the early 20th century and thus were always clashing in their different beliefs. Madame Blavatsky was critical of spiritualism; she distanced theosophy from spiritualism as far as she could and allied herself with eastern occultism.

One medium who rejected evolution was Cora L. V. Scott; she dismissed evolution in her lectures and instead supported a type of pantheistic spiritualism. The spiritualist Gerald Massey wrote that Darwin&#x27;s theory of evolution was incomplete.

Alfred Russel Wallace believed qualitative novelties could arise through the process of spiritual evolution, in particular the phenomena of life and mind. Wallace attributed these novelties to a supernatural agency. Later in his life, Wallace was an advocate of spiritualism and believed in an immaterial origin for the higher mental faculties of humans; he believed that evolution suggested that the universe had a purpose, and that certain aspects of living organisms are not explainable in terms of purely materialistic processes, in a 1909 magazine article entitled &quot;The World of Life&quot;, which he later expanded into a book of the same name. Wallace argued in his 1911 book &quot;World of Life&quot; for a spiritual approach to evolution and described evolution as &quot;creative power, directive mind and ultimate purpose&quot;. Wallace believed natural selection could not explain intelligence or morality in the human being so suggested that non-material spiritual forces accounted for these. Wallace believed the spiritual nature of humanity could not have come about by natural selection alone, the origins of the spiritual nature must originate &quot;in the unseen universe of spirit&quot;.

Oliver Lodge also promoted a version of spiritual evolution in his books &quot;Man and the Universe&quot; (1908), &quot;Making of Man&quot; (1924) and &quot;Evolution and Creation&quot; (1926). The spiritualist element in the synthesis was most prominent in Lodge&#x27;s 1916 book &quot;Raymond, or Life and Death&quot; which revived a large interest for the public in the paranormal.

Allan Kardec promoted a version of spiritualism, Spiritism, which combined spiritual evolution with reincarnation, popularized by French romantic socialists. Spiritism also established a peculiar relationship with the philosophy of Positivism. While Positivism rejected theological and metaphysical explanations, valuing only empirical and scientific knowledge, Kardec sought to integrate this vision with the belief in the existence of the spirit and in communication with the dead. Thus, Spiritism presented itself as a &quot;Positive Faith&quot;, attempting to reconcile the rational and investigative method of Positivism with the belief in the immortality of the soul and in reincarnation. Kardec appropriated the scientific language of the time to give legitimacy to his doctrine, structuring it as a kind of &quot;spiritual science&quot; that offered evidence of life after death and promoted a reforming morality in a context of social and religious crisis in the 19th century.

==After the 1920s==
After the 1920s, spiritualism evolved in three different directions, all of which exist today.

===Syncretism===
The first of these continued the tradition of individual practitioners, organised in circles centered on a medium and clients, without any hierarchy or dogma. Already by the late 19th century spiritualism had become increasingly syncretic, a natural development in a movement without central authority or dogma. Today, among these unorganised circles, spiritualism is similar to the new age movement. However, theosophy, with its inclusion of Eastern religion, astrology, ritual magic and reincarnation, is an example of a closer precursor of the 20th-century new age movement. Today&#x27;s syncretic spiritualists are quite heterogeneous in their beliefs regarding issues such as reincarnation or the existence of God. Some appropriate new age and neo-pagan beliefs, while others call themselves &quot;Christian spiritualists&quot;, continuing with the tradition of cautiously incorporating spiritualist experiences into their Christian faith.

===Spiritualist art===
Spiritualism also influenced art, having a pervasive influence on artistic consciousness, with spiritualist art having a huge impact on what became modernism and therefore art today.

Spiritualism also inspired the pioneering abstract art of Vasily Kandinsky, Piet Mondrian, Kasimir Malevich, Hilma af Klint, Georgiana Houghton, and František Kupka.

===Spiritualist church===

The second direction taken has been to adopt formal organization, patterned after Christian denominations, with established liturgies and a set of seven principles, and training requirements for mediums. In the United States the spiritualist churches are primarily affiliated either with the National Spiritualist Association of Churches or the loosely allied group of denominations known as the spiritual church movement; in the U.K. the predominant organization is the Spiritualists&#x27; National Union, founded in 1890.

Formal education in spiritualist practice emerged in 1920s, with organizations like the William T. Stead Center in Chicago, Illinois, and continue today with the Arthur Findlay College at Stansted Hall in England, and the Morris Pratt Institute in Wisconsin, United States.

Diversity of belief among organized spiritualists has led to a few schisms, the most notable occurring in the U.K. in 1957 between those who held the movement to be a religion &quot;sui generis&quot; (of its own with unique characteristics), and a minority who held it to be a denomination within Christianity. In the United States, this distinction can be seen between the less Christian organization, the National Spiritualist Association of Churches, and the more Christian spiritual church movement.

The practice of organized spiritualism today resembles that of any other religion, having discarded most showmanship, particularly those elements resembling the conjurer&#x27;s art. There is thus a much greater emphasis on &quot;mental&quot; mediumship and an almost complete avoidance of the apparently miraculous &quot;materializing&quot; mediumship that so fascinated early believers such as Arthur Conan Doyle.

===Psychical research===
Already as early as 1882, with the founding of the Society for Psychical Research (SPR), parapsychologists emerged to investigate spiritualist claims. The SPR&#x27;s investigations into spiritualism exposed many fraudulent mediums which contributed to the decline of interest in physical mediumship.

==Recognition==
Spiritualism and its belief system were affirmed as covered by the Employment Equality Regulations 2003 at the United Kingdom Employment Appeal Tribunal in 2009.

<text>Gloria Jean Watkins (September 25, 1952 – December 15, 2021), better known by her pen name bell hooks (stylized in lowercase), was an American author, theorist, educator, and social critic who was a Distinguished Professor in Residence at Berea College. She was best known for her writings on race, feminism, and class. She used the lower-case spelling of her name to decenter herself and draw attention to her work instead. The focus of hooks&#x27; writing was to explore the intersectionality of race, capitalism, and gender, and what she described as their ability to produce and perpetuate systems of oppression and class domination. She published around 40 books, including works that ranged from essays, poetry, and children&#x27;s books. She published numerous scholarly articles, appeared in documentary films, and participated in public lectures. Her work addressed love, race, social class, gender, art, history, sexuality, mass media, and feminism.

She began her academic career in 1976 teaching English and ethnic studies at the University of Southern California. She later taught at several institutions including Stanford University, Yale University, New College of Florida, and The City College of New York, before joining Berea College in Berea, Kentucky, in 2004. In 2014, hooks also founded the bell hooks Institute at Berea College. Her pen name was borrowed from her maternal great-grandmother, Bell Blair Hooks.

==Early life==
Gloria Jean Watkins was born on September 25, 1952, to a working-class African-American family, in Hopkinsville, a small, segregated town in Kentucky. Watkins was one of six children born to Rosa Bell Watkins (&quot;née&quot; Oldham) and Veodis Watkins. Her father worked as a janitor and her mother worked as a maid in the homes of white families. In her memoir &quot;Bone Black: Memories of Girlhood&quot; (1996), Watkins would write of her &quot;struggle to create self and identity&quot; while growing up in &quot;a rich magical world of southern black culture that was sometimes paradisiacal and at other times terrifying.&quot;

An avid reader (with poets William Wordsworth, Langston Hughes, Elizabeth Barrett Browning and Gwendolyn Brooks among her favorites), Watkins was educated in racially segregated public schools, later moving to an integrated school in the late 1960s. This experience greatly influenced her perspective as an educator, and it inspired scholarship on education practices as seen in her book, &quot;Teaching to Transgress: Education as the Practice of Freedom&quot;. She graduated from Hopkinsville High School before obtaining her BA in English from Stanford University in 1973, and her MA in English from the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1976. During this time, Watkins was writing her book &quot;Ain&#x27;t I a Woman: Black Women and Feminism&quot;, which she began writing at the age of 19 ( 1971) and then published (as bell hooks) in 1981.

In 1983, after several years of teaching and writing, hooks completed her doctorate in English at the University of California, Santa Cruz, with a dissertation on author Toni Morrison entitled &quot;Keeping a Hold on Life: Reading Toni Morrison&#x27;s Fiction.&quot;

==Influences==
Included among hooks&#x27; influences is the American abolitionist and feminist Sojourner Truth. Truth&#x27;s &quot;Ain&#x27;t I a Woman?&quot; inspired hooks&#x27; first major book. Also, the Brazilian educator Paulo Freire is mentioned in hooks&#x27; book &quot;Teaching to Transgress&quot;. His perspectives on education are present in the first chapter, &quot;engaged pedagogy.&quot; Other influences include Peruvian theologian Gustavo Gutiérrez, psychologist Erich Fromm, playwright Lorraine Hansberry, Buddhist monk Thích Nhất Hạnh, and African American writer James Baldwin.

==Teaching and writing==
She began her academic career in 1976 as an English professor and senior lecturer in ethnic studies at the University of Southern California. During her three years there, Golemics, a Los Angeles publisher, released her first published work, a chapbook of poems titled &quot;And There We Wept&quot; (1978), written under the name &quot;bell hooks.&quot; She had adopted her maternal great-grandmother&#x27;s name as her pen name because, as she later put it, her great-grandmother &quot;was known for her snappy and bold tongue, which [she] greatly admired.&quot; She also said she put the name in lowercase letters to convey that what is most important to focus upon is her works, not her personal qualities: the &quot;substance of books, not who [she is].&quot; On the unconventional lowercasing of her pen name, hooks added that, &quot;When the feminist movement was at its zenith in the late &#x27;60s and early &#x27;70s, there was a lot of moving away from the idea of the person. It was: Let&#x27;s talk about the ideas behind the work, and the people matter less... It was kind of a gimmicky thing, but lots of feminist women were doing it.&quot;

In the early 1980s and 1990s, hooks taught at several post-secondary institutions, including the University of California, Santa Cruz, San Francisco State University, Yale (1985 to 1988, as assistant professor of African and Afro-American studies and English), Oberlin College (1988 to 1994, as associate professor of American literature and women&#x27;s studies), and, beginning in 1994, as distinguished professor of English at City College of New York.

South End Press published her first major work, &quot;Ain&#x27;t I a Woman? Black Women and Feminism&quot;, in 1981, though she had started writing it years earlier at the age of 19, while still an undergraduate. In the decades since its publication, &quot;Ain&#x27;t I a Woman?&quot; has been recognized for its contribution to feminist thought, with &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; in 1992 naming it &quot;One of the twenty most influential women&#x27;s books in the last 20 years.&quot; Writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 2019, Min Jin Lee said that &quot;Ain&#x27;t I a Woman&quot; &quot;remains a radical and relevant work of political theory. She lays the groundwork of her feminist theory by giving historical evidence of the specific sexism that black female slaves endured and how that legacy affects black womanhood today.&quot; &quot;Ain&#x27;t I a Woman?&quot; examines themes including the historical impact of sexism and racism on black women, devaluation of black womanhood, media roles and portrayal, the education system, the idea of a white-supremacist-capitalist-patriarchy and the marginalization of black women.

At the same time, hooks became significant as a leftist and postmodern political thinker and cultural critic. She published more than 30 books, ranging in topics from black men, patriarchy, and masculinity to self-help; engaged pedagogy to personal memoirs; and sexuality (in regards to feminism and politics of aesthetics and visual culture). &quot;Reel to Real: race, sex, and class at the movies&quot; (1996) collects film essays, reviews, and interviews with film directors. In &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, Hua Hsu said these interviews displayed the facet of hooks&#x27; work that was &quot;curious, empathetic, searching for comrades.&quot;

In &quot;Feminist Theory: From Margin to Center&quot; (1984), hooks develops a critique of white feminist racism in second-wave feminism, which she argued undermined the possibility of feminist solidarity across racial lines.

As hooks argued, communication and literacy (the ability to read, write, and think critically) are necessary for the feminist movement because without them people may not grow to recognize gender inequalities in society.

In &quot;Teaching to Transgress&quot; (1994), hooks&#x27; attempts a new approach to education for minority students. Particularly, hooks&#x27; strives to make scholarship on theory accessible to &quot;be read and understood across different class boundaries.&quot;

In 2002, hooks gave a commencement speech at Southwestern University. Eschewing the congratulatory mode of traditional commencement speeches, she spoke against what she saw as government-sanctioned violence and oppression, and admonished students who she believed went along with such practices. &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot; reported that many in the audience booed the speech, though &quot;several graduates passed over the provost to shake her hand or give her a hug.&quot;

In 2004, she joined Berea College as Distinguished Professor in Residence. Her 2008 book, &quot;belonging: a culture of place&quot;, includes an interview with author Wendell Berry as well as a discussion of her move back to Kentucky. She was a scholar in residence at The New School on three occasions, the last time in 2014. Also in 2014, the bell hooks Institute was founded at Berea College, where she donated her papers in 2017.

During her time at Berea College, hooks also founded the bell hooks center along with professor Dr. M. Shadee Malaklou. The center was established to provide underrepresented students, especially black and brown, femme, queer, and Appalachian individuals at Berea College, a safe space where they can develop their activist expression, education, and work. The center cites hooks&#x27; work and her emphasis on the importance of feminism and love as the inspiration and guiding principles of the education it offers. The center offers events and programming with an emphasis on radical feminist and anti-racist thought.

She was inducted into the Kentucky Writers Hall of Fame in 2018.

In 2020, during the George Floyd protests, there was a resurgence of interest in hooks&#x27; work on racism, feminism, and capitalism.

==Personal life and death==
Regarding her sexual identity, hooks described herself as &quot;queer-pas-gay.&quot; She used the term &quot;pas&quot; from the French language, translating to &quot;not&quot; in the English language. She describes being queer in her own words as &quot;not who you&#x27;re having sex with, but about being at odds with everything around it.&quot;  She stated, &quot;As the essence of queer, I think of Tim Dean&#x27;s work on being queer, and queer not as being about who you&#x27;re having sex with—that can be a dimension of it—but queer as being about the self that is at odds with everything around it, and it has to invent and create and find a place to speak and to thrive and to live.&quot; During an interview with Abigail Bereola in 2017, hooks revealed to Bereola that she was single while they discussed her love life. During the interview, hooks told Bereola, &quot;I don&#x27;t have a partner. I&#x27;ve been celibate for 17 years. I would love to have a partner, but I don&#x27;t think my life is less meaningful.&quot;

On December 15, 2021, bell hooks died from kidney failure at her home in Berea, Kentucky, aged 69.

===Buddhism===
Through her interest in Beat poetry and after an encounter with the poet and Buddhist Gary Snyder, hooks was first introduced to Buddhism in her early college years. She described herself as finding Buddhism as part of a personal journey in her youth, centered on seeking to recenter love and spirituality in her life and configure these concepts into her focus on activism and justice. After her initial exposures to Buddhism, hooks incorporated it into her Christian upbringing and this combined Christian-Buddhist thought influenced her identity, activism, and writing for the remainder of her life.

She was drawn to Buddhism because of the personal and academic framework it offered her to understand and respond to suffering and discrimination as well as love and connection. She describes the Christian-Buddhist focus on everyday practice as fulfilling the centering and grounding needs of her everyday life.

Buddhist thought, especially the work of Thích Nhất Hạnh, appears in multiple of hooks&#x27; essays, books, and poetry. Buddhist spirituality also played a significant role in the creation of love ethic which became a major focus in both her written work and her activism.

== Legacy and impact ==
Bell hooks was included in Utne Reader&#x27;s 1995 &quot;100 Visionaries Who Could Change Your Life&quot; and included in TIME magazine&#x27;s &quot;100 Women of the Year&quot; in 2020, where she was described as &quot;that rare rock star of a public intellectual who reaches wide by being accessible&quot;.

With a literary repertoire comprising over 30 books and contributions to prominent magazines such as Ms., Essence, and , hooks commands attention with her blend of social commentary, autobiography, and feminist critique. Regardless of the subject matter, her writings consistently display scholarly rigor conveyed through accessible prose.

Prior to her tenure at Berea College, hooks held teaching positions at esteemed institutions like Stanford, Yale, and The City College of New York. Her influence transcends academia, as evidenced by her residencies both in the United States and abroad. In 2014, St. Norbert College dedicated an entire year to celebrating her contributions with &quot;A Year of bell hooks.&quot;

The popularity of hooks&#x27; writing surged amidst the racial justice movements ignited by the deaths of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor in 2020, with her book &quot;All About Love: New Visions&quot; entering the New York Times bestseller list over 20 years after its publication.

<text>Braintree () is a municipality in Norfolk County, Massachusetts, United States. It is officially known as a town, but Braintree is a city with a mayor-council form of government, and it is considered a city under Massachusetts law. The population was 39,143 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Greater Boston area with access to the MBTA Red Line and is a member of the Metropolitan Area Planning Council&#x27;s South Shore Coalition. The first mayor of Braintree was Joe Sullivan, who served until January 2020. The current mayor of Braintree is Erin Joyce who was elected in 2023, defeating incumbent Charles Kokoros.

== History ==
Braintree was colonized in 1635 and incorporated in 1640. The town is named after the Essex town of Braintree. Its boundaries initially were larger, but some portions were split into the municipalities of Quincy (incorporated in 1792), Randolph (1793), and Holbrook (1872). Braintree was part of Suffolk County until the formation of Norfolk County in 1793.

In 1888, the villages of Braintree and South Braintree were separate communities within the town of Braintree. 

In 1920, Braintree was the site of the murders that led to the trial of Sacco and Vanzetti. During that same decade, the town&#x27;s population grew by more than 50%.

==Geography==
Braintree shares borders with Quincy to the north, Randolph to the west (separated by the Cochato River), Holbrook to the south, and Weymouth to the east.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 14.5 square miles (37.6 km2), of which 13.9 square miles (36.0 km2) is land and 0.6 sq mi (1.6 km2) is water. The total area is 4.34% water

Park and recreation locations in Braintree include Pond Meadow Park, Sunset Lake, and Blue Hills Reservation.

=== Climate ===

Braintree has a humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dfa)&quot; with some maritime influence. Summers are typically warm to hot, rainy, and humid, while winters oscillate between periods of cold rain and snow, with cold temperatures. Spring and fall are usually mild, with varying conditions dependent on wind direction and jet stream positioning. Prevailing wind patterns that blow offshore minimize the influence of the Atlantic Ocean.

The hottest month is July, with a mean temperature of . The coldest month is January, with a mean of . Periods exceeding in summer and below freezing in winter are not uncommon but are rarely extended, with about 13 and 25 days per year seeing each, respectively. The city&#x27;s average window for freezing temperatures is November 9 through April 5. Official temperature records have ranged from in February 1934, up to in August 1949 and 1974.

Braintree&#x27;s coastal location on the North Atlantic moderates its temperature, but makes the city very prone to nor&#x27;easter weather systems that can produce much snow and rain. The city averages of precipitation a year, with of snowfall per season. Snowfall increases dramatically as one goes inland away from the city (especially north and west of the city)—away from the moderating influence of the ocean.

Most snowfall occurs from December through March, as most years see no measurable snow in April and November, and snow is rare in May and October. There is also high year-to-year variability in snowfall; for instance, the winter of 2011−2012 saw only of accumulating snow, but in the winter of 2014–2015, the figure was .

Fog is fairly common, particularly in spring and early summer, and the occasional tropical storm or hurricane can threaten the region, especially in late summer and early autumn. The last such storm to impact the city was Hurricane Sandy in October 2012. Due to its situation along the North Atlantic, the city is often subjected to sea breezes, especially in the late spring, when water temperatures are still quite cold and temperatures at the coast can be more than colder than locations a few miles inland, sometimes dropping by that amount near midday.

Thunderstorms occur from May to September and are occasionally severe, with large hail, damaging winds and heavy downpours. Although Braintree has never been struck by a violent tornado, the city has experienced many tornado warnings. Damaging storms are more common in areas north, west, and northwest of the city.

Braintree is situated in the Greater Boston Area, which has rail, air, and highway facilities. State Route 128 and Interstate 95 divide the region into inner and outer zones, which are connected by numerous &quot;spokes&quot; providing direct access to the airport, port, and intermodal facilities of Boston.
Principal highways in Braintree are Interstate 93 (which runs concurrently with U.S. 1) and Route 3, as well as 37, and 53. Entering Braintree from the north, I-93, Route 1, and Route 3 all run concurrently as the Southeast Expressway from Boston; in Braintree they diverge, with Route 3 heading south toward Cape Cod as the Pilgrims Highway, and I-93 and Route 1 heading west toward Route 128.

Commuter rail service to South Station, Boston, is available on the Middleboro &amp; Plymouth lines from the Braintree Red Line/Commuter Rail Station located on Union Street. The CapeFLYER rail service from Boston to Hyannis as well as Buzzards Bay stations also stops at Braintree Station. The MBTA Red Line is accessible at the same location. Weekday rail service on the Greenbush Line started in late 2007 and is accessible from the Weymouth Landing/East Braintree station on Quincy Avenue. In July 2017, Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker and other Baker administration transportation officials visited a construction project in the city to highlight $2.8 billion spent during Baker&#x27;s administration on highway construction projects and improvements to bridges, intersections, and sidewalks. Freight Rail service is provided by Fore River Transportation Corporation, and CSX Transportation. 

From 1948 to 1968, the town was the home of Braintree Airport, a general aviation airport located near Great Pond that was used by civil defense officials and private pilots. The airport featured a dirt runway and offered flight training. Residential development, proximity to the town&#x27;s water supply, and a number of accidents led to its closure in 1968.

<text>USS &quot;Dace&quot; (SS-247), a &quot;Gato&quot;-class submarine, was the first submarine of the United States Navy to be named for any of several small North American fresh-water fishes of the carp family.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Dace&quot;′s keel was laid down by the Electric Boat Company of Groton, Connecticut, 22 July 1942. She was launched on 25 April 1943, sponsored by Mrs O. P. Robertson, and commissioned on 23 July 1943, Lieutenant Commander Joseph F. Enright in command.

==Service history==

===United States Navy===

====World War II====

=====1943=====
Departing New London, Connecticut on 7 September 1943, &quot;Dace&quot; arrived at Pearl Harbor on 3 October, and 17 days later sailed on her first war patrol, bound for the southeast coast of Honshū and the approaches to Nagoya. On 7 November, she made her first contact with the enemy, damaging a freighter with torpedoes. Alert action by patrol craft prevented &quot;Dace&quot; from continuing her attack. She returned to Midway Island to refit from 11 December – 7 January 1944.

=====1944=====
On her second war patrol, &quot;Dace&quot; cruised the shipping lanes south of Truk. On the night of 26 January, she contacted a large tanker, guarded by two escorts. She fired a spread of torpedoes, heard five explosions, and broke off the contact to avoid the pursuit of the escort. The cause of the explosion is unknown as Japanese records show no ship damaged in that area on that date. After refueling at Tulagi on 2–3 February, &quot;Dace&quot; continued her patrol close to Truk during carrier air raids there on 16–17 February. On 25 February, she arrived at Milne Bay, New Guinea, for refit.

&quot;Dace&quot; put to sea on her third war patrol on 18 March, and two days later embarked a group of commandos at Langemak Bay. For the next week, she scouted the coast around Hollandia (currently known as Jayapura), New Guinea, landing the commando parties and taking them back on board at night. She refueled at Manus Island on 27–28 March, and sailed on for her assigned patrol area. This patrol was interrupted from 10 to 16 April, when &quot;Dace&quot; made at sea with and escorted her into Manus. On 13 May, &quot;Dace&quot; put into Brisbane, Australia, for refit.

&quot;Dace&quot;″s fourth war patrol – from 13 June – 12 August – found her refueling at Manus on 20–21 June, and sailing on to patrol the Mindanao coast in Davao Gulf. Enemy contacts were made, but were too small to be worthwhile targets. On 9 July, &quot;Dace&quot; scored at least three hits on a large transport whose two escorts dropped a total of 43 depth charges, badly shaking the submarine but causing little physical damage. A reconnaissance mission took her into Sarangani Bay on 16 July, and ten days later, she pursued a smoke contact visible on the horizon for a full day, eight times being forced down to avoid detection by patrolling aircraft. That night, she reestablished contact and just after midnight on 27 July, &quot;Dace&quot; launched an attack, firing ten torpedoes into a convoy of three merchantmen, sinking the tanker &quot;Kyoei Maru No. 2&quot; (1,157 tons) before being forced to dive when one of the escorts tried to ram and began a depth charge attack. On 31 July, &quot;Dace&quot; sank a small freighter and the next day received another depth charging after an attack on a well escorted freighter. With all torpedoes expended, &quot;Dace&quot; put in at Manus on 6 August, and sailed on to Brisbane, arriving on 12 August.

&quot;Dace&quot; cleared Brisbane on 1 September on her fifth and most successful war patrol. She topped up her fuel tanks at Darwin, Australia on 10 September, and sailed for the exacting task of sweeping mines in Palawan Passage and Balabac Strait. From 27 September – 3 October, she put in at Mios Woendi to repair her gyrocompass, returning to her patrol area on 10 October. Four days later, she attacked a convoy of seven ships, sinking two and heavily damaging a third.

She now joined in an action which brought both submarines the Navy Unit Commendation. On 23 October, they contacted the Japanese Center Force approaching the Palawan Passage for the attack on the Leyte landings. Since the location of this Japanese force had been unknown for several days, the contact report reported by &quot;Dace&quot; and &quot;Darter&quot; was significant. The two submarines closed the task force, and &quot;Darter&quot; attacked first, sinking and damaging . &quot;Dace&quot; followed with a torpedo attack that sank , then went deep to avoid counterattacking destroyers. Continuing to track their target, hoping for a chance to finish off &quot;Takao&quot;, the two submarines worked through the Palawan Passage. &quot;Darter&quot; ran aground. With the area full of searching enemy ships, &quot;Dace&quot; took &quot;Darter&quot;″s men off, then fired torpedoes at her to destroy her. She dove to avoid a patrolling Japanese aircraft, which had bombed &quot;Darter&quot;. &quot;Dace&quot; sailed on for Fremantle, Western Australia, arriving on 6 November.

&quot;Dace&quot; cleared Fremantle on 2 December on her sixth war patrol. She scouted along the Singapore-Hong Kong shipping lane, then sailed on to mine the channel between Palau Gambir and the mainland. Finishing that task on 16 December, &quot;Dace&quot; heard loud explosions from the mined area late in the afternoon. Three days later, while preparing to attack an eight-ship convoy, &quot;Dace&quot; was violently shaken by four depth charges or bombs. She went deep, hitting bottom, and while waiting there for the escorts to break off their attack, she was bumped, turned, scraped, and clanked along the bottom by the strong current. Somehow the enemy did not detect her and the sub was able to surface later, repair minor damage, and sail on to patrol farther north. On 28 December, she sank &quot;Nosaki&quot; and damaged a freighter in the same convoy. She put in at Saipan for fuel on 17 January 1945, and reached Pearl Harbor on 28 January.

=====1945=====
After a West Coast , &quot;Dace&quot; sailed from Pearl Harbor on 25 May 1945 on her seventh war patrol. She fueled at Midway on 29 May, and entered her patrol area in the Kurile Islands on 7 June. Battle Stations Surfaced on two Japanese ships both sunk through gun action. 1 Luger and 1 Sea truck on 8 June. Again, the next day two Japanese ships were taken out, a freighter and a destroyer. Here, she sank two sailing ships by gunfire, then headed into the Sea of Okhotsk. On 10 June, she detected a large freighter and a small tanker sailing through the fog. Coming into attacking position, &quot;Dace&quot; saw the convoy also included three escorts, but continued to close the freighter, firing her first spread at only . She swung to fire at the tanker as the freighter, &quot;Hakuyo Maru&quot; (1,391 GRT), exploded and sank, then was confronted by an escort apparently planning to ram. &quot;Dace&quot; launched a torpedo &quot;down the throat&quot; of the escort, and plunged deep. A severe depth charging followed, after which &quot;Dace&quot; fired again at the escort. She returned to Midway on 25 July, and sailed on to Saipan on 13 August, preparing for her eighth war patrol. She was there when the war ended.

====Post-war====
With the end of hostilities, &quot;Dace&quot; was ordered back to Pearl Harbor, and on 5 October 1945 arrived at New London. She was placed in commission in reserve at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard on 15 January 1946, and was towed to New London, where she was placed out of commission in reserve on 12 February 1947.

Recommissioned on 8 August 1951, &quot;Dace&quot; operated from New London along the Eastern Seaboard and in the Caribbean Sea until placed in commission in reserve at New London on 31 December 1953. She was placed out of commission in reserve at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard on 15 January 1954 for extensive modernization, then was recommissioned on 22 October 1954. After training men of the Marina Militare, she was decommissioned at New London on 31 January 1955, and transferred the same day to Italy under the Military Assistance Program.

==&quot;Leonardo da Vinci&quot; (S 510)==
Ex-&quot;Dace&quot; was commissioned in the &quot;Marina Militare Italiana&quot; (Italian Navy) as &quot;Leonardo da Vinci&quot; (S 510). Originally to be lent to Italy for five years, this arrangement was extended by five years in 1959 and extended for yet another five years, twice. Together with (ex-USS &quot;Barb&quot;), &quot;Leonardo da Vinci&quot; formed the backbone of Italian submarine strength in the late 1950s and 1960s. &quot;Dace&quot; was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 15 October 1972 and returned to the United States Navy; &quot;Leonardo da Vinci&quot; was deleted from the Italian Navy the following year.

===Fate===

Ex-&quot;Dace&quot; was sold for scrapping on 1 April 1975.

==Awards==
In addition to the Navy Unit Commendation, &quot;Dace&quot; received seven battle stars during her seven war patrols, the last five of which were designated as &quot;successful.&quot; She is credited with having sunk 28,689 tons of Japanese shipping.

<text>USS &quot;Dace&quot; (SSN-607), a submarine, was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for the dace, any of several small North American fresh-water fishes of the carp family. The contract to build her was awarded to Ingalls Shipbuilding in Pascagoula, Mississippi on 3 March 1959 and her keel was laid down on 6 June 1960. She was launched on 18 August 1962, sponsored by Betty Ford, wife of future President of the United States Gerald Ford, and commissioned on 4 April 1964.

<doc id="200742" wikidata="Q60940" url="?curid=200742" title="Rudolf Diels">
<text>Rudolf Diels (16 December 1900 – 18 November 1957) was a German civil servant and head of the Gestapo in 1933–34. He obtained the rank of SS-&quot;Oberführer&quot; and was a protégé of Hermann Göring.

==Early life==
Diels was born in Berghausen in the Taunus, the son of a farmer. He went to school in Wiesbaden. He served in the army towards the end of World War I and was posted in Haguenau, Alsace in an intelligence role. After the war, he studied law at the University of Marburg from 1919. At university he had a reputation as a drinker and philanderer. While there he also received a number of dueling scars resulting from the academic fencing once practised by young upper-class Austrians and Germans.

==Gestapo chief==
He joined the Prussian interior ministry in 1930 and was promoted to an advisory position in the Prussian police in 1932, targeting political radicals, both Communists and Nazis. He was head of the Prussian Political Police when Adolf Hitler came to power on 30 January 1933. Göring was made minister president for Prussia in April of that year, replacing Carl Severing, and was impressed with Diels&#x27; work and new-found commitment to the Nazi Party. Diels became a protégé of Göring. In April 1933, Göring appointed him as chief of the new Prussian state police department 1A, concerned with political crimes. Department 1A was soon renamed the &quot;Geheime Staatspolizei&quot; (Secret State Police), or Gestapo. During this time, he had a romantic relationship with Martha Dodd, the daughter of the US ambassador to Germany.

On 27 February 1933 the Reichstag fire occurred and Diels was the main interrogator of the principal accused, Marinus van der Lubbe. He told Hitler he thought that the fire was set by this single man. However, Hitler was convinced it was the Communists. Diels attracted the attention of political rivals, including SS chief Heinrich Himmler and his deputy, Reinhard Heydrich. In 1933 and 1934, Himmler and Heydrich took over the political police of state after state. Soon only Prussia was left outside their control. Concerned that Diels was not ruthless enough to effectively counteract the power of the &quot;Sturmabteilung&quot; (SA), Göring handed over control of the Gestapo to Himmler on 20 April 1934. Also on that date, Hitler appointed Himmler chief of all German police outside Prussia. Heydrich, named chief of the Gestapo by Himmler on 22 April 1934, also continued as head of the SS Security Service, the &quot;Sicherheitsdienst&quot; (SD). Effectively smeared, but with Göring&#x27;s aid, Diels narrowly avoided execution during the Night of the Long Knives at the end of June 1934, fleeing his post for five weeks. Thereafter, he was briefly Deputy Police President of Berlin before being appointed &quot;Regierungspräsident&quot; (administrative president) of the local government of Cologne in 1934. Diels was then appointed administrative president of Hannover in 1936.

He maintained his association with Göring, marrying his cousin, Ilse Göring. Göring saved him from prison notably in 1940 when Diels declined to order the arrest of Jews. He was later arrested by the Gestapo in 1944 after the 20 July Plot to assassinate Hitler and imprisoned, but survived.

==Post-war==
Diels presented an affidavit for the prosecution at the Nuremberg trials, but was also summoned to testify by Göring&#x27;s defense lawyer. He was interned until 1948. After 1950 he served in the post-war government of Lower Saxony and then in the Ministry of the Interior, until his retirement in 1953.

==Published works==
Diels&#x27; memoirs, &quot;Lucifer Ante Portas: Von Severing bis Heydrich&quot;, were published in 1950. It was pre-released in the German weekly Der Spiegel between May and July 1949 in nine episodes. A less cautious work was published after his retirement, &quot;Der Fall Otto John&quot; (&quot;The Case of Otto John&quot;) (1954).

==Death==
Diels died on 18 November 1957 when his rifle accidentally discharged while he was hunting.

<text>Barbara Lillias Romaine Anderson, Lady Anderson (, 14 April 1926 – 24 March 2013) was a New Zealand fiction writer who became internationally recognised and a best-selling author after her first book was published in her sixties.

==Career==
Born Barbara Lillias Romaine Wright in Hastings, she was educated at the University of Otago where she graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in 1947. In 1951, she married Neil Anderson, a Royal New Zealand Navy officer later to become Chief of New Zealand Defence Staff. They had two sons. After a career as a medical technologist and as a teacher, she went back to university in Wellington, New Zealand, where she graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree from the Victoria University of Wellington in 1984. 

Anderson took Bill Manhire&#x27;s creative writing course at Victoria University in 1983, after which she began her writing career. Her short stories were published in journals and magazines such as &quot;Landfall&quot;, &quot;Sport&quot; and the &quot;New Zealand Listener&quot;. Her first book was a collection of short stories, &quot;I Think We Should Go Into the Jungle&quot;. Her third book, the novel &quot;Portrait of the Artist&#x27;s Wife&quot; (1992), received first prize at the Goodman Fielder Wattie Book Awards in 1992. It was a bestseller and received critical acclaim in New Zealand and overseas.

Her husband was knighted in 1982, and she was subsequently styled Lady Anderson. In 2009 she was awarded an honorary Doctor of Literature from the University of Otago, and in 2011 she received the prestigious Arts Foundation Icon Award.

She died in Auckland on 24 March 2013.

<doc id="200749" wikidata="Q1196069" url="?curid=200749" title="Declaration of Breda">
<text>The Declaration of Breda (dated 4 April 1660) was a proclamation by Charles II of England in which he promised a general pardon for crimes committed during the English Civil War and the Interregnum for all those who recognised Charles as the lawful king; the retention by the current owners of property purchased during the same period; religious toleration; and the payment of arrears to members of the army, and that the army would be recommissioned into service under the crown. Further, regarding the two latter points, the parliament was given the authority to judge property disputes and responsibility for the payment of the army. The first three pledges were all subject to amendment by acts of Parliament.

==Background==

The declaration was written in response to a secret message sent by General George Monck, who was then in effective control of England. On 1 May 1660, the contents of the declaration and accompanying letters were made public. The next day Parliament passed a resolution that &quot;government ought to be by King, Lords and Commons&quot; and Charles was invited to England to receive his crown. On 8 May Charles was proclaimed King. On the advice of Monck, the Commons rejected a resolution put forward by jurist Matthew Hale (a member for Gloucestershire) for a committee to be formed to look into the concessions offered by Charles and to negotiate conditions with the King such as those put forward to his father in the treaty of Newport.

The declaration was named after the city of Breda in the Netherlands. It was actually written in the Spanish Netherlands, where Charles had been residing since March 1656; however, at the time of writing, England had been at war with Spain since 1655. To overcome the difficulties, both practical and in terms of public relations, of a prospective King of England addressing his subjects from enemy territory, Monck advised Charles to relocate himself to the United Netherlands, and to date his letters as if they were posted from Breda. Charles left Brussels, his last residence in the Spanish Netherlands, and passing through Antwerp arrived in Breda on 4 April, and resided there until 14 May. Then he travelled to The Hague, where he was received by the States General of the Netherlands as a ruling King of England and grandiosely entertained, and departed for England on 2 June from Scheveningen on , the former &quot;Naseby&quot; which was renamed on arrival at the Dutch coast. The declaration, however (actually several letters, addressed to Monck, the Houses of Parliament, and the City of London), was despatched as soon as Charles had crossed the border of the Dutch Republic, and was dated 4 April (OS)/14 April (NS).

== Contents ==
The declaration was drawn up by Charles and his three chief advisors, Edward Hyde, James Butler, and Nicholas Monck, in order to state the terms by which Charles hoped to take up &quot;the possession of that right which God and Nature hath made our due&quot;.

The declaration promised a &quot;free and general pardon&quot; to any old enemies of Charles and of his father who recognised Charles II as their lawful monarch, &quot;excepting only such persons as shall hereafter be excepted by parliament&quot;. However it had always been Charles&#x27;s expectation, or at least that of his chancellor, Edward Hyde (later Earl of Clarendon), that all who had been immediately concerned in his father&#x27;s death should be punished, and even while at a disadvantage, while professing pardon and favour to many, he had constantly excepted the regicides. Once Charles was restored to the throne, on his behalf Hyde steered the Indemnity and Oblivion Act through Parliament. The act pardoned most who had sided with Parliament during the Civil War, but excepted the regicides, two prominent unrepentant republicans (John Lambert and Henry Vane the Younger), and around another twenty; all of whom were forbidden to take any public office or sit in Parliament.

In the declaration Charles promised religious toleration in areas where it did not disturb the peace of the kingdom, and an act of Parliament for the &quot;granting of that indulgence&quot;. However Parliament chose to interpret the threat of peace to the kingdom to include the holding of public office by non-Anglicans. Between 1660 and 1665 the Cavalier Parliament passed four statutes that became known as the Clarendon Code. These severely limited the rights of Roman Catholics and nonconformists, such as the Puritans who had reached the zenith of their influence under the Commonwealth, effectively excluding them from national and local politics.

The declaration undertook to settle the back-pay of General Monck&#x27;s soldiers. The landed classes were reassured that establishing the justice of contested grants and purchases of estates that had been made &quot;in the continued distractions of so many years and so many and great revolutions&quot; was to be determined in Parliament. Charles II appeared to have &quot;offered something to everyone in his terms for resuming government&quot;.

Copies of the Declaration were delivered to both houses of the Convention Parliament by John Grenville. Other copies with separate covering letters were delivered to Lord General George Monck to be communicated to the Lord President of the Council of State and to the Officers of the Army under his command, and to the Generals of the &quot;Navy at Sea&quot; and to the Lord Mayor of London.

=== Commemoration ===
Several warships of the Royal Navy would later be named HMS &quot;Breda&quot; after the declaration.

<text>Adrien Nicholas Brody (born April 14, 1973) is an American actor. He is known for his portrayal of Władysław Szpilman in Roman Polanski&#x27;s war drama &quot;The Pianist&quot; (2002), for which he won the Academy Award for Best Actor at age 29, becoming the youngest winner in the category. He also became the second American male actor to win the César Award for Best Actor for the same film. For his role as a Holocaust survivor who immigrates to the United States in &quot;The Brutalist&quot; (2024), he won a Golden Globe and BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role, and received his second nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor.

Brody has also starred in &quot;King of the Hill&quot; (1993), &quot;The Thin Red Line&quot; (1998), &quot;The Village&quot; (2004), &quot;King Kong&quot; (2005), &quot;Hollywoodland&quot; (2006), &quot;Cadillac Records&quot; (2008), &quot;Predators&quot; (2010), and &quot;See How They Run&quot; (2022). He has frequently collaborated with filmmaker Wes Anderson, appearing in his films &quot;The Darjeeling Limited&quot; (2007), &quot;Fantastic Mr. Fox&quot; (2009), &quot;The Grand Budapest Hotel&quot; (2014), &quot;The French Dispatch&quot; (2021), and &quot;Asteroid City&quot; (2023). He portrayed Salvador Dalí in Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;Midnight in Paris&quot; (2011) and Arthur Miller in Andrew Dominik&#x27;s &quot;Blonde&quot; (2022).

On television, he has played Luca Changretta in the fourth season of the BBC series &quot;Peaky Blinders&quot; (2017), and Pat Riley in the HBO sports drama series &quot;Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty&quot; (2022–2023). He earned Primetime Emmy Award nominations for his roles as Harry Houdini in the History Channel miniseries &quot;Houdini&quot; (2014), and investor Josh Aaronson in the HBO series &quot;Succession&quot; (2021). Brody made his London stage debut as death row inmate Nick Yarris in &quot;The Fear of 13&quot; (2024).

==Early life and education ==
Adrien Nicholas Brody was born on April 14, 1973 in Jackson Heights, Queens, New York City, the son of Sylvia Plachy, a photographer, and Elliot Brody, a retired history professor and painter. Brody&#x27;s father is of Polish Jewish descent. Brody&#x27;s mother was born in Budapest, Hungary, and came to the U.S. after the Hungarian Revolution of 1956; she was raised Catholic, and is the daughter of a Catholic Hungarian aristocrat father and a Czech Jewish mother. Brody has said he was raised &quot;without a strong connection&quot; to either Judaism or Christianity.

As a child, Brody performed magic shows at children&#x27;s birthday parties as &quot;The Amazing Adrien&quot;. He attended I.S. 145 Joseph Pulitzer Middle School and Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music &amp; Art and Performing Arts in New York. His parents enrolled him in acting classes to distance him from the dangerous children with whom he associated. He attended summer camp at Long Lake Camp for the Arts in the Adirondacks in upstate New York. 

Brody attended Stony Brook University before transferring to Queens College for a semester.

==Career==
===Beginnings and breakthrough (19892002)===
Taking acting classes as a child, by age thirteen, Brody appeared in an Off-Broadway play and a PBS television film. After appearing in &quot;Bullet&quot; in 1996 with Tupac Shakur and Mickey Rourke, Brody hovered on the brink of stardom, receiving an Independent Spirit Award nomination for his role in the 1998 film &quot;Restaurant&quot;, and later praise for his roles in Spike Lee&#x27;s &quot;Summer of Sam&quot; and Terrence Malick&#x27;s &quot;The Thin Red Line&quot;. Director Roman Polanski had seen Brody&#x27;s performance in &quot;Harrison&#x27;s Flowers&quot; (2000), and decided to offer him the leading role in &quot;The Pianist&quot; (2002). To prepare for the role, Brody withdrew for months, gave up his apartment and his car, and took piano lessons for four hours a day until he could master passages from some of Chopin&#x27;s finest works. At tall, he lost , dropping him to . The role won him an Academy Award for Best Actor, making him, at age twenty-nine, the youngest actor ever to win the award, and, to date, the only winner under the age of thirty. He also won a César Award for his performance. The role also earned him Best Actor nominations at the BAFTA, Golden Globes, and SAG Awards; Brody did not win any of these prizes, making him one of few actors to win an Oscar and no major precursor awards for a performance.

===After &quot;The Pianist&quot; (20032013)===
After &quot;The Pianist&quot;, Brody appeared in four distinctively different films. In &quot;Dummy&quot; (released in 2003, but originally shot in 2000, just prior to his work in &quot;The Pianist&quot;), he portrayed Steven Schoichet, a socially awkward aspiring ventriloquist in pursuit of a love interest (his employment counsellor, played by Vera Farmiga). He learned ventriloquism and puppetry for the role (under the tutelage of actor/ventriloquist Alan Semok) convincingly enough to perform all of the voice stunts and puppet manipulation live on set in real time, with no subsequent post dubbing. He played Noah Percy, a mentally disabled young man, in the film &quot;The Village&quot;, by M. Night Shyamalan, shell-shocked war veteran Jack Starks in &quot;The Jacket&quot;, writer Jack Driscoll in the 2005 &quot;King Kong&quot; remake, and father-to-be Peter Whitman in &quot;The Darjeeling Limited&quot; by Wes Anderson. &quot;King Kong&quot; was both a critical and box office success—it grossed $550 million worldwide, and is Brody&#x27;s most successful film to date, financially. He reprised his role voicing Driscoll in the video game adaptation of the film. Additionally, Brody played a detective in &quot;Hollywoodland&quot;. He has also appeared in Diet Coke and Schweppes commercials, as well as Tori Amos&#x27; music video for &quot;A Sorta Fairytale&quot;.

On January 5, 2006, Brody confirmed speculation that he was interested in playing the role of The Joker in 2008&#x27;s &quot;The Dark Knight&quot;, and also met with director Christopher Nolan. However, Nolan and Warner Bros. decided instead to cast Heath Ledger in the role. He was also in talks with Paramount to play Spock in J. J. Abrams&#x27; &quot;Star Trek&quot;, but it ultimately went to Zachary Quinto. In 2009, he starred in &quot;Splice&quot;, a science-fiction film written and directed by Vincenzo Natali. Originally a Sundance film, &quot;Splice&quot; was adopted by Dark Castle Entertainment and distributed by Warner Bros. In 2010, he played the star role of Royce in &quot;Predators&quot; (a sequel to the original &quot;Predator&quot;), directed by Nimród Antal and produced by Robert Rodriguez.

In 2011, Brody starred in a Stella Artois beer ad called &quot;Crying Jean&quot; that premiered right after half-time of Super Bowl XLV as part of Stella&#x27;s &quot;She Is a Thing of Beauty&quot; campaign. He appeared in Woody Allen&#x27;s 2011 Academy Award-winning comedy, &quot;Midnight in Paris&quot; as Salvador Dalí. On January 16, 2012, Brody made his debut as a runway model for Prada Men Fall/Winter 2012 show.

===Film resurgence, television roles, and &quot;The Brutalist&quot; (2014present)===
In 2014, Brody collaborated again with Wes Anderson in the Academy Award-winning &quot;The Grand Budapest Hotel&quot;, where he played Dmitri. He received an Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Miniseries or in a Movie for portraying the title character in &quot;Houdini&quot;, a History Channel miniseries. The same year, Brody was cast as the title role of Lee Tamahori&#x27;s action epic &quot;Emperor,&quot; about a young woman seeking revenge for the execution of her father by Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, opposite Sophie Cookson. The movie was finished and screened at Cannes in 2017 but its release has been by legal challenges.

In 2015, he starred as Tiberius in the Chinese film &quot;Dragon Blade&quot;, which grossed $54.8 million in its opening week in China. He also received the Cinema Vanguard award at the San Diego Film Festival the same year.

In 2017, it was announced that he would join the cast of the fourth season of the BBC crime drama &quot;Peaky Blinders&quot;. On August 4, 2017, he received the Leopard Club Award at the Locarno Festival. The Leopard Club Award pays homage to a major film personality whose work has made a lasting impact on the collective imagination.

In 2019, Brody left Paradigm to sign with CAA Creative Artists Agency. In 2021, he received the Vanguard Award at SCAD&#x27;s Savannah Film Festival.

In 2024, Brody starred in Brady Corbet&#x27;s &quot;The Brutalist&quot;, replacing Joel Edgerton in the lead role and joining an ensemble cast consisting of Felicity Jones, Guy Pearce, Joe Alwyn, Jonathan Hyde, Emma Laird, and Peter Polycarpou. Brody&#x27;s performance in the film as the Hungarian-Jewish Holocaust survivor László Tóth was critically acclaimed, with critics praising his subtlety and stating that it was one of his finest performances since &quot;The Pianist&quot;. For his performance, he won the Golden Globe and Critics Choice Award.

Brody starred in a stage play, &quot;The Fear of 13&quot;, written by Lindsey Ferrentino, at the Donmar Warehouse in London in October–November 2024. The play is based on the true story of Nick Yarris, an exonerated death-row inmate from Pennsylvania.

==Personal life==
In 1992, Brody was seriously hurt in a motorcycle collision in which he was thrown over a car and crashed head-first into a crosswalk. He spent months recuperating. He has broken his nose three times doing stunts, including during the filming of &quot;Summer of Sam&quot;.

It was reported in 2024 that Brody suffers from PTSD from the extreme weight loss he endured for &quot;The Pianist&quot; in 2002.

In 2010, Brody sued makers of the film &quot;Giallo&quot;, alleging they failed to pay his full salary. In January 2011 it was reported that Brody had reached a settlement with the producers. Brody stated, &quot;I very much enjoyed the process of making &quot;Giallo&quot; and am happy that things have been resolved and that people can now enjoy seeing the film.&quot;
=== Relationships ===
Brody began dating Spanish actress and model Elsa Pataky in 2006. For Pataky&#x27;s 31st birthday in July 2007, Brody purchased for her a 19th-century farm in Central New York state that was remodeled to look like a castle. Brody and Pataky were featured at their New York home in a 35-page spread for &quot;HELLO!&quot; magazine in October 2008. The pair broke up in 2009. 

In February 2020, it was reported that he was in a relationship with English fashion designer and actress Georgina Chapman, whom he began dating while she was still married to but in a formal separation from Harvey Weinstein.

===Oscar kiss===
At the 75th Academy Awards in 2003, Brody became the subject of controversy while receiving his Best Actor Oscar for &quot;The Pianist&quot;, when he passionately kissed the presenter, actress Halle Berry. Although Berry herself minimized the incident a week later, she has stated that this action was taken with no advance warning given.

After being widely viewed as the 2003 Oscars&#x27; signature moment, Brody&#x27;s behavior inspired a number of televised parodies that year.

In January 2025, Halle Berry congratulated Adrien on his Instagram profile, for winning the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor for his performance in &quot;The Brutalist&quot;. &quot;Congratulations my friend. You are truly one of one!&quot;

<doc id="200760" wikidata="Q1687804" url="?curid=200760" title="Jerry Colangelo">
<text>Jerry Colangelo (born November 20, 1939) is an American businessman and sports executive. He formerly owned the Phoenix Suns of the NBA, the Phoenix Mercury of the WNBA, the Arizona Sandsharks of the Continental Indoor Soccer League, the Arizona Rattlers of the Arena Football League, and the Arizona Diamondbacks of Major League Baseball. He was also instrumental in the relocation of the original Winnipeg Jets team in the NHL to Phoenix to become the Phoenix Coyotes (later renamed to the Arizona Coyotes, now the Utah Hockey Club). In 2014, Grand Canyon University renamed its Christian based school of business after Jerry Colangelo, replacing Ken Blanchard&#x27;s namesake. From December 2015 to April 2016, Colangelo served as chairman of basketball operations for the Philadelphia 76ers, before serving as a special advisor to the team until December 2018.

He became the youngest general manager in professional sports in 1968 after being hired to that position by the Phoenix Suns. He holds the distinction of the second-longest tenure running an NBA franchise, exceeded only by that of Red Auerbach of the Boston Celtics.

In the summer of 2005, Colangelo was named director of USA Basketball whose team represented the United States in the 2008 Beijing Olympics and 2010 FIBA World Championship. Since 2009, he has served as Chairman of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. Colangelo also serves as Chairman of the National Italian American Foundation (NIAF), a nonprofit nonpartisan educational foundation that promotes Italian-American culture and heritage.

==Early life==
Colangelo was born and raised in Chicago Heights, Illinois, to an Italian-American working class family. He played basketball and baseball for Bloom Township High School. Colangelo enrolled at the University of Kansas, but transferred to the University of Illinois after prospective teammate Wilt Chamberlain left. He played basketball for the Illinois Fighting Illini, earned All-Big Ten honors, and captained the Illini as a senior. He was later inducted into the Illinois Basketball Hall of Fame. Colangelo also played two years of baseball at Illinois. In 1962, he graduated from the University of Illinois with a degree in physical education.

In his autobiography, &quot;How You Play the Game&quot;, Colangelo tells of working at the House of Charles, a tuxedo rental shop in Chicago Heights, after graduating from college.

== Basketball ==

Colangelo began his sports career in 1966 in professional basketball with the Chicago Bulls. He worked as a marketing director, scout, and assistant to the president of the team. In 1968, he left the Bulls and was hired as the first general manager of the expansion team, the Phoenix Suns. He was the youngest general manager in professional sports. When he and his family left for Arizona, he had $200 in his wallet.

Colangelo got off to an unlucky start, losing a 1969 coin flip to the Milwaukee Bucks for the rights to UCLA phenom Lew Alcindor (who became Kareem Abdul-Jabbar). The Suns were competitive during most of the 1970s, making it to the NBA Finals in 1976, but losing to the Boston Celtics in six games. Colangelo had two stints as head coach during that decade, compiling a record of 59 wins and 60 losses.

Throughout most of the 1980s, Colangelo&#x27;s Suns faced difficulties. Some players, including 1976 NBA Finals player Garfield Heard, were involved in an infamous drug scandal, young center Nick Vanos died in a 1987 plane crash, and, from 1985 through 1988, the Suns failed to qualify for the playoffs. Colangelo assembled a group of investors that bought the Suns in late 1987, in the wake of the drug scandal. He subsequently made a trade for Kevin Johnson in 1987.

The Suns made one of the biggest turnarounds in NBA history in 1988–89, nearly doubling their win total (from 28 wins to 55) and making the first of 13 straight playoff appearances. In 1989, Colangelo was an essential part of the group that provided financial backing to build America West Arena (renamed Talking Stick Resort Arena). In 1992, Colangelo traded Jeff Hornacek, Tim Perry, and Andrew Lang to the Philadelphia 76ers for Charles Barkley. The trade proved to be productive for the Suns, and they reached the NBA Finals for the second time in 1993, this time losing to the Chicago Bulls starring Michael Jordan in six games. Barkley&#x27;s relationship with Colangelo, however, grew sour over the years, and in 1996, he was traded to the Houston Rockets.

Throughout his time with the Suns, Colangelo would win four different NBA Executive of the Year honors with the team. It would stand to be the most honors for an executive of one team in the NBA. He eventually turned over the Suns&#x27; presidency to his son Bryan, who later left the organization to become general manager of the Toronto Raptors. Bryan ended up winning two NBA Executive of the Year honors: one with Phoenix, and one with Toronto only two seasons later.

On December 7, 2015, Colangelo decided to return to the NBA to become the new chairman of basketball operations for the Philadelphia 76ers, as well as special adviser to the team&#x27;s managing partner. On April 7, 2016, Colangelo&#x27;s son, Bryan, took on the role of general manager and president of basketball operations for the 76ers after their former president and general manager, Sam Hinkie, resigned from his position before end of the 2015–16 season due to irreconcilable differences with Jerry. The move reunited the Colangelos for the first time since 2004 with the Phoenix Suns. Colangelo stepped down as chairman of basketball operations following the hiring of his son, but he retained his role as special adviser to the managing partner. Just before his son&#x27;s later resignation from the position of general manager, Colangelo attempted to save Bryan&#x27;s job by threatening to damage the team&#x27;s NBA relationships. On July 30, 2018, it was revealed that he would retire as of 2019.

==Additional sports activities==
Colangelo has been involved in many professional sports teams in Arizona.

===Baseball===
While in Chicago for a Suns game, Colangelo attended a Chicago Cubs baseball game at Wrigley Field. Soon thereafter he decided to inquire to Major League Baseball about bringing an expansion team to Arizona. He assembled a group of investors in 1994 to buy a franchise, a year ahead of MLB&#x27;s proposed expansion selection meetings. In 1995, Colangelo&#x27;s group was granted an expansion team, the Arizona Diamondbacks.

The Diamondbacks began playing in 1998. For his new baseball club, Colangelo hired Joe Garagiola, Jr. as general manager. He next brought in Buck Showalter coming off a successful stint as manager of the New York Yankees. Showalter and Yankees owner George Steinbrenner did not agree to a contract extension, so Colangelo quickly hired Showalter as future manager of the Diamondbacks. These hirings proved to be instrumental to the expansion franchise&#x27;s quick success. Key acquisitions made by Garagiola included the signing of Randy Johnson in 1999 and a trade for Curt Schilling in 2000 from the Philadelphia Phillies. They were co-MVPs of the 2001 World Series when the Diamondbacks beat the Yankees in seven games. This is, , the only major professional sports championship for the Phoenix area.

The Diamondbacks had gone into significant debt to build the 2001 champions. For example, he asked 12 of the highest-paid players to defer their salaries for four years and repay them over eight years. The ensuing debt came back to haunt the Diamondbacks in 2004. Only three years after winning the World Series and two years after winning a third division title in four years, the Diamondbacks never recovered from a slow start. They ultimately finished 51–111, the worst record in baseball and still the worst in franchise history.

By then, Colangelo was gone. He was forced to resign as Managing General Partner in the summer of 2004, and subsequently sold his interest. Ken Kendrick succeeded him as managing general partner, while Jeff Moorad became CEO and operating head of the franchise.

In an interview with &quot;USA Today,&quot; Colangelo defended his approach to building the Diamondbacks, saying that he was only trying to build a winning team. He contrasted his approach with that of the Diamondbacks&#x27; expansion brethren, the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, who at the time had finished in either last or next-to-last every season (and would not have a winning season until 2008). He claimed that the plan only backfired when the economy went sour and he didn&#x27;t get as much from baseball&#x27;s central fund as anticipated.

===Women&#x27;s basketball===
In 1997, Colangelo&#x27;s team in the Women&#x27;s National Basketball Association, the Phoenix Mercury, began playing. The following year, the Mercury reached the WNBA Finals but lost to the Houston Comets.

===Arena football===
In 1992, Colangelo founded the Arena Football League&#x27;s Arizona Rattlers and owned them until 2005. Under Colangelo&#x27;s guidance, the Rattlers won Arena Bowl championships in 1994 and 1997. They were also one of the AFL&#x27;s model franchises and were a perennial playoff team. According to published reports, the Rattlers struggled to stay afloat as a franchise after Colangelo sold the team.

===Hockey===
Following the demise of the proposed move of the Winnipeg Jets to Minneapolis, Colangelo was involved in bringing the National Hockey League (NHL) to Arizona, successfully convincing the team&#x27;s ownership to relocate the franchise to the area as the Phoenix Coyotes in 1996. At the time, the move made Phoenix one of 13 metropolitan areas with franchises in all four major North American professional sports leagues. The Coyotes played in the Phoenix suburb of Tempe at Arizona State University facilities prior to the team&#x27;s sale and relocation to Salt Lake City in 2024.

==Exit from sports==
In April 2004, Colangelo sold the Suns, Mercury and Rattlers to an investment group headed by San Diego, California businessman, Tucson, Arizona native Robert Sarver for $401 million.

Late in the 2004 baseball season, Colangelo sold his controlling interest in the Arizona Diamondbacks to a group of investors led by Jeff Moorad.

==Other interests==

 Jerry Colangelo was part of an investment group planning development in Buckeye, Arizona. They planned a 300,000+ residence development called Douglas Ranch and a smaller development called Trillium.

Colangelo purchased the bankrupt Wigwam Resort in Litchfield Park, Arizona.

In 2011, Jerry Colangelo assisted in creating Grand Canyon University&#x27;s Colangelo School of Sports Business and served as an advisor. On September 25, 2014, Grand Canyon University announced their college of business would be renamed Colangelo College of Business.

== Awards ==
Colangelo has been named the NBA&#x27;s Executive of the Year four times (1976, 1981, 1989, 1993). He is an honorary member of the Marchegiana Society of his hometown, Chicago Heights, Illinois. A street in that city bears his name.

In 1994, Colangelo received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.

On May 9, 2002, Colangelo was awarded an honorary degree from Arizona State University.

==Personal life==
Colangelo is a Christian and has spoken about his faith saying, &quot;The first priority in life is to have that relationship with Jesus Christ. So your faith is number one. ... God [has] a plan for my life. You know, the way I&#x27;ve tried to live my life is I have this platform, it was given to me by the Lord. And He&#x27;s blessed me with a lot of things. And someday I&#x27;m going to be held accountable with what I did with those things.&quot;

Colangelo is married to Joan, whom he met on a blind date while at college. They have four children: Kathy Holcombe, Kristen Young, Mandie Colangelo, and Bryan Colangelo. Bryan had been president of the Phoenix Suns when his father was part of the ownership group, and rejoined his father with the Philadelphia 76ers from 2016 to 2018.

<text>Montagu&#x27;s harrier(Circus pygargus) is a migratory bird of prey of the harrier family. Its common name commemorates the British naturalist George Montagu.

==Taxonomy==
The first formal description of Montagu&#x27;s harrier was by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758, in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;, under the binomial name &quot;Falco pygargus&quot;. The genus &quot;Circus&quot; was introduced by the French naturalist Bernard Germain de Lacépède in 1799. The genus name is derived from Ancient Greek. &quot;Circus&quot; is from &quot;kirkos&quot;, meaning &quot;circle&quot;, referring to a bird of prey named for its circling flight (probably the hen harrier), and &quot;pygargus&quot; is Modern Latin derived from the Greek &quot;pugargos&quot;, from &quot;puge&quot;, meaning &quot;rump&quot;, and &quot;argos&quot;, meaning &quot;shining white&quot;. The species name was formerly used for the hen harrier before Montagu&#x27;s was identified as a different species.
==Identification==
===Plumage===
Sexual dimorphism is particularly apparent in the plumage of this species. Adult males are characterized by their overall pale grey plumage contrasting with black wingtips. Compared with other harriers this species has characteristic black bands along the secondaries, both above and below the wing and rusty streaks on belly and flanks. Adult females have a broadly similar plumage to that of pallid and hen harriers. The underparts are mostly pale yellow-brown, the belly with longitudinal stripes and the wing coverts spotted. The upper parts are uniform dark brown except for the white upper tail coverts (&quot;rump&quot;), and the sightly paler central wing coverts.

The juvenile plumage resembles that of the female, but differs by the belly and under wing coverts which are not spotted, but uniformly red brown in colour.

A melanistic form occurs regularly in this species. In this form the male is much darker than usual, with a black head, brownish black above and grey underparts. The melanistic female is entirely chocolate brown except for grey flight feathers. Partially melanistic morphs can also be found.

===Flight===
The Montagu&#x27;s harrier has a particularly graceful flight, with powerful and elegant wingbeats which give an impression of buoyancy and ease. In true harrier fashion it searches the countryside, flying low, and generally holds its wings with a marked positive dihedral.

===Dimensions===
The Montagu&#x27;s harrier is a deceptively small raptor, though it appears larger because of its large wing surface compared to small body weight, which gives it a typically buoyant flight. The female is larger than the male because the female needs to produce eggs, however this is not apparent in the field.

===Risk of confusion===
The Montagu&#x27;s harrier can be confused with several species that exist within the same range. The most similar are the hen harrier and the pallid harrier. The male is easily distinguished from other species as its plumage is distinctly darker and more mottled than in the males of hen or pallid harriers. However, distinguishing females and juveniles is more difficult. Usually the Montagu&#x27;s harrier appears more slender in flight than the hen harrier with a longer tail, longer and narrower wings and more pointed &quot;hands&quot;. Also its flight is more elegant than the hen harrier, with more elastic, almost tern-like wingbeats. The distinction between female pallid and Montagu&#x27;s harriers is the most delicate and can only be made in good conditions as the proportions are similar. The best recognition character is the pale collar around the neck of female and juvenile pallid harriers which is not present in the Montagu&#x27;s.

==Habitat==
This species can be found in a middle-latitude band of predominantly temperate climates, but also in Mediterranean, and boreal zones. Although it has been found nesting up to , it is essentially a lowland species, and nests mostly in broad river valleys, plains, and levels bordering lakes and the sea. It can breed in wetlands, though these are often smaller and drier than those used by the marsh harrier. It also utilizes heaths, dunes, moors, and can be found in the steppe. It adapts to shrublands in gorse or heather and to areas planted with young conifers.
When no other suitable habitat is available this harrier will nest in agricultural farmlands where it is vulnerable to early harvesting. Amongst these it chooses especially grasslands and cereal crops such as wheat, barley, oats and colza. In western Europe, up to 70% of the population breeds in artificial habitats.

In short, for breeding the Montagu&#x27;s harrier requires a large open area, with sufficiently tall ground vegetation to afford cover without being overgrown. It favours posts on which both male and female can rest and survey the breeding area: these can be fenceposts, small trees, or rocky outcrops. When hunting, in any season, it prefers areas of low or sparse vegetation where prey is more visible. Densely settled areas are generally avoided and it is highly susceptible to disturbance.

==Food and foraging methods==
The diet consists mainly of small rodents, small birds, bird eggs, reptiles (including snakes) and large insects (mainly Orthoptera, which are numerically the most common).

As this bird has a wide distribution, it will take whatever prey is available in the area where it nests; in the northern range it will mainly take ground squirrels and rabbits, whereas in southern Europe, it mostly takes small reptiles and large insects. In areas where the food supply is composed almost exclusively of rodents, the breeding success depends greatly on the cyclic fluctuations of vole populations. At times they regurgitate.

Prey is caught while flying along fixed routes at low heights and constant low speeds (c. ), as is typical of harriers. The flight is considered lighter and more dexterous than other harriers enabling it to take more agile prey. When possible it often follows the edges of various vegetation to catch its prey by surprise. This is taken after a short stoop, though fast running animals and flying birds can be chased over a short distance. 
During the breeding season, the male will provision the female and later the young with food. The rate of provisioning increases from 5 to 6 times per day during incubation to 7 to 10 times per day when young have hatched, though the male can be handicapped by wet, foggy or windy weather. In a manner typical of harriers, prey is passed between partners in the air: The female flies underneath the male, who drops the prey for her to catch. The male hunts over a large area up to away from the nest. The female hunts closer to the nest, up to away, and only after the young have hatched.

==Status and distribution==
This species can still be found throughout most of the Western Palearctic. In most European countries there is at least a small population, except in Norway where it is not present. The breeding range extends as far east as the Urals, whereas the most western population is that of Portugal. Breeding also occurs in northern Africa, mostly in Morocco. In Great Britain, the species is limited to southern England. In Ireland the species is rarely seen, and mainly in the South, although there are a number of breeding records, the most recent from 1971. Despite having a wide distribution, this bird is not common in many areas and has strong populations only in France, Spain, Russia, Belarus and Poland where the greater part of the European population can be found. Breeding sites frequently change, with some sporadic nesting occurring outside known breeding areas, however clear signs of reduced range are apparent and are associated with population decline.

===Status in Britain===
Montagu&#x27;s harrier is a rare breeding bird in Britain. There are two breeding areas: the area surrounding The Wash, and downland areas of southern England, from Dorset and Hampshire north to Oxfordshire. Away from these areas it occurs only as a scarce migrant. One site, Estuary Farm, near North Wootton in west Norfolk, a special observation area was negotiated with local landowners, so that pressure could be taken off other nesting pairs. In 2005, a pair bred on the Holkham estate. In 2015, it was reported that some Montagu&#x27;s harrier were nesting at Blacktoft Sands, East Riding of Yorkshire.

==Population trends==
The population for the western Palearctic is estimated at 35,000–50,000 pairs. The global population is unknown and could be anything between 150,000 and 200,000 individuals(Birdlife International, 2004). This uncertainty is due to the fact that most of the world&#x27;s population is situated in Russia and former Soviet republics where it is not quantified.

The evolution has been paradoxical throughout the 20th century. In the beginning of the century up to the 1940s, during a period when other raptors greatly decreased because of human persecution, the Montagu&#x27;s harrier actually increased its population and breeding range, breeding for the first time in Denmark in the 1900s, and greatly increasing elsewhere. However, from the 1940s onwards it has decreased rapidly. This is due to several negative factors: first, the massive use of agricultural pesticides such as DDT and other environmental poisons was extremely detrimental to the harriers themselves, as well as rarefying their prey, in particular large insects. The modification of agricultural practises, with an evolution towards more intensive farming also puts pressure on harriers, with faster growing crops preventing those birds that nest in farmlands from finishing their nidification before their clutches are destroyed by harvesting machines. Despite a generally negative trend there are local cases when the population has increased, such as in Sweden or in Germany in the 1990s. These local trends show that while they have access to suitable habitats and food supply there can still be positive developments.

==Social behaviour and breeding==
It can be both solitary and gregarious at times, both during the breeding season and in winter quarters. A breeding pair may associate with others to form loose colonies, with as many as 30 nests in the same area, sometimes as close as apart. Semi-colonial nesting is not due to a shortage of nesting sites, but arises rather from the need to provide a better defence against predators. The actual area defended by both partners covers only around the nest, and in case of colonial nesting the response to predators may be communal. Other species attacked and mobbed include large raptors, corvids, and foxes.

Reproduction begins with the return of both partners to the nesting site, at which point both male and female will start displaying. The display consists of various sky-dances and aerobatic figures that vary according to each individual. Both sexes will display, crying loudly, though the males&#x27; displays are more frequent and spectacular. Montagu&#x27;s harriers breed for the first time when two or three years old, but occasionally one-year-old females may attempt to nest. Pairs form on the territory, when returning from migration. As the birds are tied to their former nesting sites, they probably mate with the same partner every year. The nest is built by the female, always in tall vegetation. It is a simple construction made of grass, used only for one season. The female lays 3 to 5 eggs which are incubated for 27–40 days. The young leave the nest after 28–42 days and are independent two weeks later.

The males may be polygamous, then having to feed two females and later two broods, either simultaneously or consecutively.

==Migration==
The Montagu&#x27;s harrier is a long distance migrant. Birds from Eurasia spend the winter in sub-Saharan Africa, while those from the eastern part of the range migrate to the Indian subcontinent. In Europe, the first birds start to move at the beginning of August and most have left by mid-October. They travel over a broad front, crossing the Mediterranean at various points, and only a small number are observed at migration choke points. Western birds do not go further south than the Gulf of Guinea, but some eastern birds travel as far as South Africa. In Africa, their diet is composed mostly of insects and birds, and it is possible that they follow locust swarms. 

Spring return peaks in April, and most birds have arrived by May though there is evidence that first-year juveniles spend their first summer in the winter quarters

==Conservation issues==
In western Europe, an estimated 70% of breeding pairs nest in agricultural farmlands, especially cereal crops. This makes the Montagu&#x27;s harrier a very vulnerable species, and very dependent on nest protection. Bird protection non-governmental organizations participate in their protection, in collaboration with concerned landowners. Once a nest is spotted in a field, it can be safeguarded either by relocating it to a safer area or by creating a protected space which will not be harvested. In France and in the Iberian Peninsula, an average 60% of nestlings are saved by these kinds of measures.

<text>Real Club Deportivo de La Coruña (), commonly known as Deportivo La Coruña () or simply Depor, is a Spanish professional football club based in the city of A Coruña, Galicia, that competes in the Segunda División, the second tier of Spanish football league system.

Founded in 1906 as &quot;Club Deportivo de la Sala Calvet&quot; by Federico Fernández-Amor Calvet, Deportivo have won the La Liga title once, in the 1999–2000 season, and finished as runner-up on five occasions. The club have also won the Spanish Cup twice (1994–95 and 2001–02), three Spanish Super Cups (1995, 2000 and 2002), and the now defunct Concurso España (1912). The &quot;Blue and Whites&quot; were a regular fixture in the top positions of La Liga for the best part of 20 years, from 1992 to 2010, finishing in the top half of the table in 16 out of 19 seasons, and are ranked 12th in the all-time La Liga table. As a result, the club was a regular participant in European competitions, playing in the UEFA Champions League for five consecutive seasons between 2000–01 and 2004–05, reaching the quarter-finals twice and reaching the semi-finals in the 2003–04 season.

Deportivo have played their home games at the 32,490-capacity Riazor since 1944, when the stadium was built. Their traditional home kit consists of blue and white striped shirts with blue shorts and socks. The club has a long-standing rivalry with Celta Vigo, and matches between the two sides are known as the Galician derby.

==History==
===Foundation and first steps===

Unlike what happened in most of the Iberian Peninsula, football did not reach the city of A Coruña through the English, instead, it was introduced by José María Ábalo, a youngster who had returned to his hometown after studying in England. The game gained rapid popularity and several teams were formed on an informal basis.

In December 1906, members of Sala Calvet gymnasium formed Deportivo de La Coruña, naming Luis Cornide as the first president. In May 1907, Alfonso XIII of Spain granted the club the &quot;Real&quot; (&quot;royal&quot;) denomination. Dépor started playing at Corral de la Gaiteira (&quot;Piper&#x27;s Yard&quot;), but soon moved to Old Riazor, a new ground near the Riazor beach.

The team played friendly matches regularly and competed in local leagues, but failed to achieve success in the Copa del Rey in its early years. However, in 1912 Deportivo won their first official title, the short-lived Concurso España.

In 1920, the Spanish national team made its debut at the Summer Olympics in Antwerp. A good run for Spain increased the popularity of football, and as a result, many teams gained professional status, and a league competition was established and scheduled for the 1928–29 season.

===1928–1947: Segunda División and the top flight===
In 1928, Dépor failed to qualify for the first ever Primera División, instead competing in the Segunda División, where it finished eighth out of ten. The team kept battling over the next few years in a division that was soon to undergo many structural and geographical changes. In 1932, in the Cup, Dépor defeated Real Madrid, which had gone unbeaten through the entire season in the league.

In 1936, the Spanish Civil War broke out, forcing the abandonment of all official competitions until the 1939–40 season. That year, &quot;The Herculeans&quot; qualified for the promotion stage. The final game was against archrivals Celta de Vigo, who were fighting to avoid relegation. Celta won 1–0 and remained in the top flight as Depor&#x27;s hopes of promotion were denied. The following season, however, the club reached the promotion play-offs again, this time beating Murcia 2–1 to earn promotion to La Liga for the first time in the team&#x27;s history.

The first season in the top flight saw the club finish fourth. However, the club declined in the next few seasons, finishing ninth, 12th and, in 1944–45, 14th, resulting in relegation. Instant promotion was achieved the following year, but Dépor were relegated again at the end of the 1946–47 season. Nonetheless, the team gained instant promotion in 1947–48.

This decade saw Depor&#x27;s entrance to the top flight, so the club decided to build a new ground, Riazor, which remains their home today. It was opened on 28 October 1944 with a league game against Valencia. In this era, the key player of the team was Juan Acuña, the club&#x27;s goalkeeper. &quot;Xanetas&quot;, as he was known by locals, earned four Zamora Trophies between 1942 and 1951, making him the second-most decorated keeper in the Spanish league.

===1948–1957: The &quot;Golden Decade&quot;===
The club ended the 1948–49 season in tenth place. The next season would see their first major achievement in the league; Dépor finished as runners-up, just one point behind Atlético Madrid under the management of Argentinian Alejandro Scopelli, who brought to the club a group of South American players such as Julio Corcuera, Oswaldo García, Rafael Franco and Dagoberto Moll, a group that made the team more competitive and able to remain top flight status for nine consecutive seasons until 1957. During that period, managers like Helenio Herrera and renowned players like Pahiño and Luis Suárez played at the Riazor.

===1958–1973: &quot;Elevator Team&quot;===

After nine seasons of first-tier football in Spain, the team was relegated to the Segunda División in 1957 and stayed there for five seasons until 1962, when they were promoted into the top flight. This started a yo-yo era that led the club to be known as the &quot;elevator team&quot;; promotions were achieved in 1962, 1964, 1966, 1968 and 1971, yet subsequent relegations occurred during 1963, 1965, 1967, 1970 and 1973.

Dépor had one of the best youth systems at the time in Spain, as youngsters including Amancio Amaro, Severino Reija, José Luis Veloso and Jaime Blanco began their careers at the Riazor, in the future to become regular fixtures on the Spanish national team. Still more, including Luis Suárez, went on to play for larger clubs in Spain and Europe. However, the difficult financial situation of the club led to the forced sales of these players, and the team could not consolidate themselves in the top flight. This &quot;yo-yo era&quot; ended with relegation from the Primera División in 1973.

===1974–1988: Dark times===
After being relegated in 1973, the team struggled in the Second Division, failing to avoid another relegation and falling to the third tier (Tercera División) for the first time in their history. However, Dépor gained instant promotion and established themselves in the second tier for the rest of the decade. In 1980, Dépor were again relegated to the newly created Segunda División B, the third tier, again for the second time in their history. Again, however, the drop was short-lived as the team gained promotion the following season. Notably, Dépor were relegated and promoted along with arch-rivals Celta de Vigo, who played during the 1980–81 season the most attended games ever in Spain&#x27;s third tier.

The club continued to play in the Second Division, showing little chance of being promoted back to the top flight. In the 1987–88 season, Dépor struggled and only avoided relegation after Vicente Celeiro scored a goal during added time against Racing Santander in the last game of the season. This is often regarded as the end of the club&#x27;s dark times and the beginning of a new era.

During this period, the club was heavily affected by financial difficulties and internal troubles with managers being sacked almost every year. In the summer of 1988, an open and popular club assembly chose a new board of directors headed by Augusto César Lendoiro. Deportivo had a debt estimated at 600 million pesetas, had been out of the top flight for 15 years and lacked established structures at economic and sporting level.

===1989–1998: Resurgence and &quot;Súper Dépor&quot;===
Arsenio Iglesias, a former Deportivo player and manager, was again appointed as manager in the 1988–89 season. Dépor had a lengthy run in the Copa del Rey, though ultimately falling in the semi-finals to Real Valladolid. The next year, the team competed well in the league and qualified for the promotion play-offs, but expectations were denied again, this time by Tenerife. The 1990–91 season saw Dépor finishing as runners-up, finally achieving promotion to La Liga after an 18-year absence. Additionally, the club&#x27;s finances began to improve and social support increased, especially amongst youth groups.

The 1991–92 season, the team&#x27;s first back in the top flight, saw Dépor struggle, and they were forced to take part in the relegation play-off, beating Real Betis in a two-legged round. In 1992, Arsenio Iglesias began his fourth spell as Dépor manager; experienced players were also added to the team during that period, including López Rekarte, Paco Liaño, Claudio Barragán, José Luis Ribera, Adolfo Aldana and Donato, along with promising youngsters such as local player Fran and Brazilians Bebeto and Mauro Silva.

The 1992–93 Deportivo squad experienced a resurgent season, placing in top positions all season and ultimately finishing third after champions Barcelona and runners-up Real Madrid, respectively, thus qualifying for European competition for the first time in their history. That year, the club also provided La Liga&#x27;s Pichichi Trophy winner, Bebeto, and its Zamora Trophy winner, Paco Liaño. Additionally, Dépor made a historic comeback against Real Madrid at Riazor, trailing 2–0 at half-time but winning the game 3–2 and starting a run of 18 seasons to &quot;Los Blancos&quot; without a win at A Coruña.

In 1993–94, Dépor had another fantastic season, leading the table for the majority of the year and coming to the last matchday in first to face mid-table Valencia, knowing a win would ensure the first league title in club history. The game was very close, but near its end, Valencia&#x27;s Serer conceded a penalty on Nando. Regular penalty-taker Donato had been substituted, so Serbian defender Miroslav Đukić took it, but Valencia keeper González caught the ball; Deportivo saw their possible league title denied. After the frustration passed, the fans nonetheless recognised the impressive season the club had: Paco Liaño earned his second Zamora Trophy after conceding just 18 goals in 38 games, and Dépor made its debut in European competitions with the UEFA Cup, beating Aalborg and Aston Villa but losing to Eintracht Frankfurt in the round of 16.

The 1994–95 season began with manager Arsenio Iglesias stating he would leave the club after the end of the year, though Dépor made another great campaign finishing again as runners-up, this time to Real Madrid. In that season&#x27;s UEFA Cup, Deportivo were beaten again in the round of 16 by a German club, this time by Borussia Dortmund 3–2 on aggregate. Depor had won the first leg at home 1–0, and Dortmund equalized in the second leg to send the match into extra time. Now in extra time, Depor scored a second goal to put the match at 2–1, but with five minutes remaining, Dortmund scored two goals in two minutes to win the series. Despite this tough defeat, the season still hid a great surprise for the club, as Dépor made a fantastic run in Copa del Rey and reached the final for the first time in club history, against Valencia. On 24 June 1995, at the Santiago Bernabéu, the final was levelled at 1–1 when referee García-Aranda suspended the game in the 80th minute due to heavy rain and a hailstorm. It was decided that the game would resume three days later. Two minutes after the match resumed, Alfredo Santaelena scored a header, which proved to be the winning goal that handed Depor their first major title (notwithstanding the 1912 Concurso España).

The 1995–96 season was an average one for Depor; they finished ninth in the league table, but reached the semi-finals of the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, losing to eventual champions PSG. The 1997–98 season was very disappointing; the team only finished twelfth in the league table, failed to qualify for European competitions, were eliminated in the first round of the UEFA Cup by French club Auxerre, and were eliminated by second-tier side Deportivo Alaves in the Copa del Rey. José Manuel Corral was replaced in the offseason by Javier Irureta. Under Irureta, the 1998–99 season was better and Deportivo finished sixth in the league, qualifying for the following season&#x27;s UEFA Cup first round.

=== 1999–2006: La Liga title, &quot;El Centenariazo&quot;, and European Glory days ===

In 1999–2000, Deportivo, managed by Irureta and with players like Noureddine Naybet, Diego Tristán, Djalminha, Fran, Roy Makaay and Mauro Silva, finally won their first La Liga title, five points ahead of Barcelona and Valencia. With this title, La Coruña became the second-smallest Spanish city with a population of approximately 250,000, behind San Sebastián (home of Real Sociedad), to have ever won La Liga. In the UEFA Cup, the club reached the quarter-finals, being eliminated by eventual finalists Arsenal.

As league champions, Deportivo qualified for the UEFA Champions League for the first time in its history. Their first match was a 1–1 draw against Panathinaikos in Athens. They went on to top their group unbeaten with two wins and four draws. In the second group stage, they also topped their group, and Deportivo were now looking to be one of the strongest teams in the competition. However, in the quarter finals, they lost the first leg 3–0 to Leeds United, and although Depor won the second leg at Riazor 2–0, it was not enough and they were eliminated. The following campaign, they were unbeaten in the first group stage again, including two wins against Manchester United. They progressed out of the second group stage into the quarter-finals, where they were eliminated by the team they beat twice in the group stage, Manchester United. On 8 September 2001, Deportivo played its 1,000th game in La Liga.

In the 2001–02 season, Depor finished league runner-up to Valencia and won the Copa del Rey for a second time with a 2–1 win against Real Madrid on 6 March 2002. This match is commonly known in Spain as the &quot;Centenariazo&quot;. Deportivo&#x27;s opponents were expected to win the final comfortably as they were nicknamed the &quot;Galácticos&quot; and were among the strongest teams in Europe at the time. Additionally, the final was being played at their home ground, the Santiago Bernabéu. Everything was prepared so that after the expected victory, Real Madrid could celebrate their 100th anniversary by lifting the trophy in front of their own fans. However, Deportivo spoiled the party with a 2–1 win with goals from Sergio and Tristán.

Depor&#x27;s best Champions League campaign was in the 2003–04 season, where they lost to eventual winners Porto by a narrow 1–0 aggregate scoreline in the semi-finals. Although this was their best Champions League campaign, the club also had its biggest defeat in European competitions, losing 8–3 to Monaco in the group stage. However, this campaign is also remembered for their stunning comeback against Milan in the quarter-finals. Milan won the first leg 4–1 at San Siro, but in the second leg at Riazor, Deportivo won 4–0 and eliminated the defending champions 5–4 on aggregate.

Deportivo had a mediocre 2004–05 season. The team finished eighth in La Liga, only good enough to qualify for the Intertoto Cup. In the Champions League, the club had their worst campaign ever, finishing bottom of their group without winning a single match, and without scoring a single goal. This season ended the club&#x27;s spell of five consecutive years playing Champions League football.

In the summer of 2005, manager Javier Irureta was replaced by Joaquín Caparrós, ending his seven-year spell at the club.

=== 2007–2015: Transition and decline ===

In the 2006–07 season, Deportivo finished 13th in the league, their worst finish since 1992, and Caparros resigned at the end of the season. The 2007–08 season was a slight improvement, with the club finishing in 9th under new manager Miguel Ángel Lotina, but were eliminated in the Copa del Rey by Espanyol at the first hurdle. Deportivo&#x27;s 2008–09 season was better, with the club beating Bnei Sakhnin in the 2008 Intertoto Cup to progress to the UEFA Cup, where the club was eliminated 6–1 by Danish club AaB in the round of 32. Deportivo&#x27;s period in the top flight came to an end as they were relegated after finishing 18th in 2010–11. In July 2015, however, it was suspected that in the final round of matches for that season, Levante and Real Zaragoza were involved in a match-fixing scandal which ensured that the latter won 2–1 at the Estadi Ciutat de València and remained in the division at the expense of Deportivo, who lost 2–0 at home to Valencia. The case was in Courts until December 2020, when the match fixing was discarded by the Provincial Court.

In the 2011–12 season, Deportivo made an immediate return to the top flight, winning the title with a Segunda Division record of 91 points. Lassad Nouioui was the top scorer with 14 goals, Andrés Guardado the top assistant and Álex Bergantiños the only player to participate in all league matches.

In the 2012–13 season, Deportivo finished 19th after a turbulent campaign under three managers, and once again were relegated to the Segunda División. Deportivo, however, finished second in the 2013–14 season, guaranteeing promotion to the top-flight for the second time in three years. A 2014–15 campaign back in the top division with a disjointed squad featured some poor performances on the pitch under new manager Víctor Fernández, including a 8–2 defeat at home to Real Madrid. This was especially disappointing considering the 18-match unbeaten home run between 1992–93 and 2010–11 at the Riazor against Real Madrid, a feat which no other team has managed to achieve in the history of Spanish football. Deportivo ultimately finished the season in 16th place and avoided relegation after appointing former player Víctor Sánchez as manager on 9 April 2015, for the remaining eight matches of the season.

===2015–present: &quot;New Dépor&quot; and relegation to third division===

With Víctor Sánchez as their new manager, Deportivo made changes for the new season. With the addition of new players Alejandro Arribas, Fernando Navarro, Pedro Mosquera and Fayçal Fajr, Deportivo began the season with a 0–0 draw against Real Sociedad. On 28 November 2015, with a 2–0 victory against Las Palmas, Deportivo were in fifth place after an impressive start. However, after a disastrous second half of the season, which was precipitated by a 3–0 home defeat to Mirandés in the Copa del Rey, Deportivo won only two matches out of the next 22, including an 8–0 humiliation at the hands of Barcelona, and only secured their safety in La Liga in the penultimate game of the season with a victory over Villarreal. Victor Sánchez was sacked on 29 May 2016 after several incidents of player unrest within the squad.

The team continued in a negative spiral in the following seasons. At the end of the 2017–18 season, Deportivo was relegated following a 4–2 home defeat to Barcelona, which also secured Barcelona the La Liga title. The following season, the club played in Segunda División and finished sixth. In the promotion play-offs, Deportivo lost to Mallorca 3–2 on aggregate and remained in Segunda División. In the following campaign Deportivo was relegated once again, falling down into Segunda División B for the first time in 39 years. In 2020–21, the league system in Spain was reorganized and Deportivo was almost relegated to the newly formed fourth division, Segunda Federación, escaping relegation by just one point. Thus, they remained in the third division, in the newly formed Primera División RFEF, for the 2021–22 season.

After spending four seasons in the third tier, Deportivo finally won promotion back to the second division and thus professional football by finishing in first place in Group 1 of the 2023–24 Primera Federación. The deciding match against Barcelona Atlètic in the 36th round was attended by 31,833 spectators, a new Primera Federación attendance record, as Deportivo won 1–0 thanks to a goal from Lucas Pérez.

==Identity==
===Crest===

Deportivo&#x27;s crest contains cues to predecessor Sala Calvet&#x27;s crest, with a gentlemen&#x27;s belt encircling the purple and white banner of the gymnasium. The banner itself features a sky blue diagonal strip which represents the maritime flag of A Coruña and the Galician flag. In addition, it features a crown which represents its royal patronage (granted in 1909 by Alfonso XIII). During the Spanish Republic, the honorific &quot;real&quot; (royal) and the crown were removed from the club crest; this was to return under Francoist Spain.

===Kit===
Deportivo have always played in their famous blue and white stripes, but it was not until 1912 that the club made these colours official for matches. Deportivo continues to wear blue and white striped shirts with blue shorts and socks, yet their second and third kits change annually according to commercial interests. Their current shirt sponsors are local brewery Hijos de Rivera, with Kappa manufacturing the kits. In 2015, Deportivo and Estrella Galicia extended their sponsorship deal throughout the 2015–16 La Liga season with an option of a further year.

=== Supporters ===
Deportivo&#x27;s supporters are known as &quot;deportivistas.&quot; According to a 2007 survey by the Centro de Investigaciones Sociológicas, Deportivo was the ninth team in Spain in terms of number of fans, with a total of 2.2%. Fans organise themselves into around 200 fan groups known as &quot;peñas&quot;, with the most well-known being the &quot;Riazor Blues&quot;. The interests of the supporters are represented by the Federación de Peñas RC Deportivo.

In the 2022–23 season, despite playing in the third tier, the club had 25,001 season ticket holders. In March 2023, a match against Real Madrid Castilla attracted a total of 26,745 fans, the fifth largest attendance of any football match played in Spain that weekend, bettered by only four teams from the top flight. However, in the promotion play-offs, Deportivo fans broke the record again, reaching a total of 28,828 for the match against Castellón. That match was the fourth most attended match in Spain that weekend.

<text>The pallid harrier (Circus macrourus) is a migratory bird of prey of the harrier subfamily. The scientific name is derived from the Ancient Greek. &quot;Circus&quot; is from &quot;kirkos&quot; (circle), referring to a bird of prey named for its circling flight (&#x27;probably the hen harrier), and &quot;macrourus&quot; is &quot;long-tailed&quot;, from &quot;makros&quot; (long) and &quot;-ouros&quot; (-tailed).

It breeds in southern parts of eastern Europe and central Asia and Iran and winters mainly in India and southeast Asia. It is a rare but increasing vagrant to Great Britain and western Europe. In 2017 a pair of pallid harriers nested in a barley field in the Netherlands; they raised four chicks, the first recording breeding of the species in the country. In 2019, a pair bred in Spain for the first time.

This medium-sized raptor breeds on open plains, bogs and heathland. In winter it is a bird of open country.

== Description ==

This is a typical harrier, with long wings held in a shallow V in its low flight. It also resembles other harriers in having distinct male and female plumages. Adults measure long with a wingspan of . Males weigh while the slightly larger females weigh . The male is whitish grey above and white below, with narrow black wingtips. It differs from the hen harrier in its smaller size, narrower wings, paler colour, and different wing tip pattern. The female is brown above with white upper tail coverts, hence females and the similar juveniles are often called &quot;ringtails&quot;. Her underparts are buff streaked with brown. It is best distinguished from the female hen harrier on structure. It is very similar to the female Montagu&#x27;s harrier, but has a paler belly and a well defined facial pattern.

== Behaviour and ecology==

Pallid harriers primarily hunt small mammals and birds, surprising them as they drift low over fields and moors. Other food sources include large insects (typically grasshoppers and locusts), lizards and frogs.
The nest of this species is on the ground. Three to six, but typically four to five whitish eggs are laid.

<text>The marsh harriers are birds of prey of the harrier subfamily. They are medium-sized raptors and the largest and broadest-winged harriers. Most of them are associated with marshland and dense reedbeds. They are found almost worldwide, excluding only the Americas.

Until recently two species were generally recognized: the marsh harrier (&quot;Circus aeruginosus&quot;) and the African marsh harrier (&quot;C. ranivorus&quot;). The marsh harrier is now usually split into several species, sometimes as many as six. These are the western marsh harrier (&quot;C. aeruginosus&quot;), eastern marsh harrier (&quot;C. spilonotus&quot;), Papuan harrier (&quot;C. spilonotus spilothorax&quot; or &quot;C. spilothorax&quot;), swamp harrier (&quot;C. approximans&quot;), Réunion harrier (&quot;C. maillardi maillardi&quot; or &quot;C. maillardi&quot;) and Madagascar marsh harrier (&quot;C. maillardi macrosceles&quot; or &quot;C. macrosceles&quot;).

At the beginning of the 20th century, the marsh harrier was hunted to extinction in the United Kingdom. After being reintroduced from other regions, its population steadily increased until DDT threatened it, along with other raptors, in the 1950s and 1960s. Since, the population has slowly and steadily increased.

==Species==

The western marsh harrier (&quot;Circus aeruginosus&quot;), often simply called the marsh harrier, breeds widely across Europe and Asia. It is migratory except in the mildest regions, and winters mainly in Africa. It hunts small mammals, frogs, fish, insects and birds, surprising them as it drifts low over fields and reedbeds. Its long legs allow it to pluck frogs and fish from the water mid-swoop.
The western marsh harrier is a typical harrier, with long wings held in a shallow V in its low flight. It also resembles other harriers in having distinct male and female plumages, but its plumages are quite different from those of its relatives. The male has wings with grey and brown sections and black wingtips. Its head, tail and underparts are greyish, except for the chestnut belly. The female is mainly brown with a cream crown and cream leading edge to her wings. It is 19–22 inches long and weighs 1–2 lbs.

The eastern marsh harrier (&quot;C. spilonotus&quot;) breeds in the grasslands and wetlands of southern Siberia, northern Mongolia, north-east China, Manchuria and Japan, and migrates for the northern winter to South-east Asia, the Philippines and northern Borneo.

Like all marsh harriers, it favours open, wet environments, and is frequently seen drifting low over rice fields, interspersing long, watchful circling glides with two or three slow, powerful wingbeats. Two subspecies are recognised: &quot;C. s. spilonotus&quot; of east Asia, and &quot;C. s. spilothorax&quot;, of New Guinea and the islands nearby, which is sometimes thought to be a separate species and is often called the Papuan harrier.

The swamp harrier (&quot;C. approximans&quot;) at about 50 to 58 cm is slightly larger than &quot;C. spilonotus&quot;, often a little darker, and has less heavily barred wings and tail. It is commonly found in suitable habitat anywhere in Australasia, particularly in the higher rainfall areas to the east, south-east, and south-west, of Australia and throughout New Zealand, but also in the tropical north of Australia and the island groups of New Caledonia, Vanuatu, Fiji, Tonga and the Society Islands. It is also known as the Australasian harrier or Pacific marsh harrier.

The Madagascar marsh harrier or Madagascar harrier (&quot;C. maillardi&quot;) is found on the Indian Ocean islands of Madagascar, Réunion and the Comoros. It is sometimes split into two species: Madagascar harrier (&quot;Circus macrosceles&quot;) and Réunion harrier (&quot;C. maillardi&quot;).

The African marsh harrier (&quot;C. ranivorus&quot;) is a distinct non-migratory species that has not usually been included as a subspecies of &quot;C. aeruginosus&quot;. It inhabits southern and eastern Africa.

<text>Şehzade Mustafa (; 1516/1517 – 6 October 1553) was an Ottoman prince, son of sultan Suleiman the Magnificent and his concubine Mahidevran Hatun. He was Suleiman&#x27;s oldest survived son, the governor of Manisa from 1533 to 1541 and of Amasya from 1541 to 1553, when he was executed by his father&#x27;s order on charges of sedition and treason. 

== Early life ==
Mustafa was born around 1516 or 1517 in Manisa to Suleiman, when he was a prince, and his concubine Mahidevran Hatun. After Suleiman&#x27;s accession to the throne in 1520, after the death of his father Selim I, Mustafa and his mother came to reside in the Old Palace in Constantinople. With the deaths of his older half-brothers, Mahmud and Murad in 1520, Mustafa became his father&#x27;s only heir until the birth of the children of the new favorite Hürrem Sultan starting from 1521. Pietro Bragadin, ambassador in the early years of Suleiman&#x27;s reign, reported that Mustafa was his mother’s &quot;whole joy&quot;. In June–July 1530, a three week celebration was organised in Constantinople that centered around the circumcision of Mustafa, and his younger half-brothers Mehmed, and Selim. The princes were circumcised on 27 June 1530. The festivities ranged from displays of captured enemy items to simulated battles, featuring performances by jugglers and strongmen, as well as reenactments of recent conflicts. Suleiman played a crucial role, observing everything from a loggia in the Hippodrome, while Pargalı Ibrahim Pasha actively oversaw the proceedings and presented extravagant gifts to the sultan and the princes. He received instruction in religious fundamentals and literature, coupled with training in martial arts and horsemanship. He wrote poems under the pen name &quot;Muhlisi&quot;.

==Governorship==
Mustafa was recognised for his intelligence and courage, earning significant favour among the janissaries. It was anticipated that he would develop into a formidable warrior. On 3 May 1533, he was appointed as the governor of Manisa. Mustafa was placed in charge of Anatolia in 1534 and 1538, when Suleiman and the grand vizier were occupied with the Persian and then Moldavian campaigns. In 1534, Ibrahim Pasha wrote to Mustafa, confirming the receipt of a letter from the prince discussing matters in the Aegean and updating him on his father&#x27;s successes in the Baghdad campaign. In the letter, he identifies himself as Mustafa&#x27;s &quot;faithful friend&quot; and expresses the desire to meet soon, hoping to benefit from and be uplifted by the prince&#x27;s noble and blessed presence. In around 1540, Bassano described Mustafa&#x27;s court at Diyarbakır near the Safavid border, stating that the prince possessed a remarkable and splendid court, comparable to that of his father.

On 16 June 1541, he was transferred to Amasya, where his son, Şehzade Mehmed was born in 1546. Mustafa likely perceived the clear preference given to his half-brothers as evident in his removal from the governorship in Manisa, a favoured position for Ottoman princes. His relocation to Amasya in 1541, despite a considerable increase in his annual stipend, was a move he resented. Though he might not have openly expressed his displeasure, his tutor Sürurî mentioned it in a poem. To exacerbate matters, Saruhan was later bestowed upon Mehmed, Suleiman and Hürrem’s eldest son, after a year&#x27;s vacancy. Following Mehmed&#x27;s sudden death in November 1543, the district governorship passed to their second son, Selim, in the spring of 1544. Mustafa found himself excluded from this inner circle, despite having numerous sympathisers within the military elite.

As Suleiman crossed Anatolia in 1548 to take up arms once more against the Safavids, his eleventh campaign, he met with Mustafa, whom he had summoned from Amasya to accompany him for several days. A unique firsthand account details a meeting between the two of them in May, shedding light on their complex relationship. As Suleiman advanced east with the army, he encountered Mustafa near Sivas, revealing previous strains in their connection. During this encounter, the sultan, acknowledging recent discord, expressed affection toward the prince. Mustafa received a grand welcome from high-ranking officials, and the entire army camp paid homage as he proceeded to his father&#x27;s tent, reminiscent of the reunion of Jacob and Joseph after a prolonged separation. Their conversation, marked by Mustafa&#x27;s &quot;loyalty&quot; and &quot;good manners,&quot; left the contemporary observer noting the palpable &quot;relief and joy&quot; experienced by the prince. The &quot;Süleymanname&quot;, a history commissioned by Suleiman, further emphasised Mustafa&#x27;s exceptional treatment during this encounter, avoiding explicit mention of any prior issues between father and son.

While serving as the district governor in Amasya, he effectively established a reputation as a supporter of poetry and scholarship, a guardian of the populace, a dispenser of justice, and a congenial companion to the members of the military elite. In 1549, the governor of Erzurum was killed by Georgians, after which Mustafa sought Istanbul&#x27;s help to retaliate. However, Rüstem Pasha, the husband of Mustafa&#x27;s half-sister Mihrimah Sultan, anticipating that Mustafa would gain more prestige by defeating the Georgians, opted not to send support to the prince. In 1550, Iranian highway robbers crossed Ottoman borders, pillaging villages in eastern Anatolia. Once more, Mustafa requested aid, but Rüstem turned him down. Frustrated by Mustafa&#x27;s persistent appeals, Rüstem recalled Mustafa&#x27;s vizier, Lala Cafer Pasha, to Istanbul and appointed Bosnian Ahmed Pasha as a replacement and potential spy. However, the plan failed when Ahmed Pasha gained Mustafa&#x27;s trust and married his daughter Fatma Sultan in 1552.

==Succession question==

Mustafa was widely regarded as a strong contender for the throne. As early as the late 1540s, a Venetian ambassador observed his esteemed martial prowess and the janissaries&#x27; fondness for him, presenting him as the universally preferred candidate for the next sultan. This assessment was reiterated by another Venetian ambassador in the early 1550s, just before Mustafa&#x27;s demise. In two letters dispatched to Henry II of France in the autumn and winter of 1549, a French diplomat conveyed information about the sultan&#x27;s illness in the summer of 1549. The diplomat discussed the possibility of the sultan&#x27;s death and Mustafa ascending to the throne. Rumors suggested that due to the sultan&#x27;s ailment, Mustafa was summoned to the army camp near Diyarbakır as a potential successor. However, the diplomat expressed skepticism, noting that Suleiman had deep affection for his other sons, and Mustafa&#x27;s rise to power might jeopardise their lives, as they would be at his mercy and could face execution.

The elderly sultan, grappling with health issues, opted for rest, delegating military campaigns to his viziers, possibly due to reluctance to leave the capital and a fear of succession wars even before his demise. The Habsburg ambassador Gerhard Veltwyck, toward the end of 1545, reported that Rüstem and other viziers were inclined towards a peace agreement due to the discord among Suleiman&#x27;s sons. Both Veltwyck in February 1547 and the Habsburg ambassador in Istanbul, Malvezzi, in February 1550 reported Rüstem&#x27;s intention to eliminate Mustafa, seeking to secure the throne for Selim. Hürrem, Mihrimah, and Rüstem collaborated to facilitate the accession of either Selim or Bayezid to the throne. Rüstem plotted against Mustafa, attempting to portray him as a Safavid ally. He forged Mustafa&#x27;s seal, sending a deceptive letter to the Safavid ruler Tahmasp I, who unknowingly responded positively. Rüstem&#x27;s men discovered the letter and delivered it to him.

Mustafa went beyond merely establishing a reputation, as an undated letter attributed to him, likely from the late 1540s, reveals. The letter, addressed to Ayas Pasha, governor of Erzurum, and a promising bureaucrat, primarily seeks the discreet support of a high-ranking member of the military elite in anticipation of the inevitable succession wars. Mustafa carefully emphasizes his intention to await his father&#x27;s death, avoiding an outright rebellion. Simultaneously, he draws attention to his grandfather Selim&#x27;s ascension to the throne, suggesting that, like Selim, he intends to reward supporters and punish those who do not after becoming sultan. In the intricacies of the early modern empire&#x27;s political landscape, where explicit declarations are rare, the allusion to Selim serves as a clear and powerful message. The letter also offers insights into Mustafa&#x27;s self-perception and his beliefs about his brothers, indicating that he considered himself the only prince embodying the true qualities of a sultan. He asserted his Sharia-based right to the throne, challenging Ottoman custom. Ayas Pasha gave a positive response, assuring the prince that he was more deserving of the throne than his brothers. Mustafa&#x27;s pursuit of support extended to diplomatic channels, as evidenced by his envoy Nebi Bey&#x27;s mission to Venice shortly before his execution, aiming to secure political and logistical backing for his potential ascent to the throne.

== Safavid campaign ==
In late September 1552, Rüstem led the janissaries and palace troops to Anatolia for a campaign against the resurgent Safavids. Internal tensions arose among Ottoman forces due to persistent rumors about Mustafa&#x27;s imminent ascension to the throne, leading Rüstem to camp near Konya as control over his men waned. Janissaries, breaking ranks, went to Amasya to express allegiance to Mustafa, perceived as their next sultan, before returning to the army camp. Simultaneously, rumors circulated about Suleiman&#x27;s severe illness, intensifying the precarious situation for Rüstem. With skilled Ottoman forces favoring Mustafa, Rüstem faced the risk of condemnation if Suleiman&#x27;s death or Mustafa&#x27;s bold move to command the army occurred. This prompted the grand vizier to likely persuade Suleiman to take decisive action against Mustafa.

From the army camp near Konya, Rüstem sent messengers to Suleiman, informing him that Mustafa was poised to take decisive action. To substantiate the claim, Rüstem allegedly had a replica of Mustafa’s seal crafted and orchestrated a fabricated letter to the Safavid ruler Tahmasp, proposing an alliance. Tahmasp&#x27;s unwitting response was intercepted by Rüstem&#x27;s men, who forwarded it, along with news of the rebellious atmosphere in the army camp, to Suleiman as evidence of Mustafa&#x27;s treason. Ultimately, Rüstem succeeded, leading to his recall to Constantinople. Suleiman assumed command of the Ottoman forces. The delay, likely influenced by Suleiman&#x27;s health and the logistical challenges of eastern campaigns, might have been strategic, planning a winter stay in Aleppo before engaging the Safavids in the ensuing spring and summer. Discussions between Suleiman and Rüstem on handling Mustafa could have contributed to the departure delay.

Suleiman departed from his capital with Rüstem on 28 August 1553 with a splendid display, unfurling seven banners symbolising his authority over seven climes to counter rumours of his eldest son&#x27;s potential ascension. Suleiman, marching east with a significant Ottoman force set camp near Ereğli, close to Konya. Seeking reassurance amid plots against him, Mustafa arrived near the army camp on 5 October for an audience with his father. Greeted warmly by officials and presented with gifts, Mustafa, aware of the delicate situation, hoped for a reconciliation during the audience. The positive reception to Mustafa indicated the cautious dynamics within the Ottoman family, recognising that refusal to attend the audience could be perceived as an act of rebellion.

== Execution ==

On 6 October 1553, around midday, Mustafa rode to the army camp and then to his father&#x27;s tent, situated at its center. Following tradition, Mustafa dismounted, leaving his weapons outside the tent. Accompanied men stayed outside, and upon entering the tent&#x27;s inner chamber, Mustafa was attacked by executioners and strangled after a struggle. Mustafa&#x27;s lifeless body was promptly displayed in front of the sultan&#x27;s tent as a message to his supporters. Some of his closest associates were killed, and others were dispersed across the realm through tımar grants. His property, including the gifts received the day before, was seized. Following a somber funeral prayer in the nearby town of Ereğli, Mustafa&#x27;s corpse was hastily transported to Bursa, the former Ottoman capital and a burial ground for many dynasty members. His mother accompanied his body. His son Mehmed, who had been relocated there with female family members, was also executed by strangulation in May 1554, and was buried beside his father.

Mustafa&#x27;s execution stirred widespread grief and dissent, prompting Suleiman to swiftly dismiss Rüstem from the grand vizierate. Public outrage found expression in poems, notably one by Taşlıcalı Yahya, and a popular chronogram implicated &quot;Rüstem&#x27;s conspiracy and deceit&quot; (&quot;mekr-i Rüstem&quot;). The poets lamented Mustafa as a &quot;martyr&quot; (&quot;şehid&quot;), refuting allegations of his supposed collaboration with Tahmasp. Criticism extended to Rüstem, Hürrem, and even Chief Jurist Ebussuud Efendi. A Safavid source also conveyed discontent, using a chronogram to term the execution of Mustafa&#x27;s son Mehmed as an &quot;injustice repeated&quot; (&quot;sitam-e mukarrar&quot;).

==Family==
===Sons===
Mustafa had at least three sons. All his sons alive at the time of his death were executed shortly after by their grandfather Suleiman the Magnificent. 
*Şehzade Mehmed (1546, Amasya – May 1554, Bursa).
*Şehzade Ahmed (dead in 1553?).
* Şehzade Orhan (died in 1552/1553)

===Daughters===
Mustafa had at least three daughters: 
*Fatma Sultan. She married Boşnak Ahmed Pasha in 1552.

<text>Louis II de Bourbon, Prince of Condé (8 September 1621 – 11 December 1686), known as  (), was a French military commander. A tactician and strategist, he is regarded as one of France&#x27;s greatest generals, particularly celebrated for his triumphs in the Thirty Years&#x27; War and his campaigns during the Franco-Dutch War.

A member of a senior cadet branch of the House of Bourbon, Condé demonstrated exceptional military prowess from a young age and distinguished himself during the Thirty Years&#x27; War, in particular at the Battle of Rocroi against Spain in 1643. He became a powerful and influential figure in France, which made him a threat to Anne of Austria, regent for the young Louis XIV, and her prime minister Mazarin. During the Fronde revolt, Condé initially supported the crown but was later imprisoned on Mazarin&#x27;s orders. After his release, he launched an open rebellion and fought the royal forces until his defeat by Turenne, after which he defected to Spain. He commanded Spanish forces during the final phase of the Franco-Spanish War.

Following the Treaty of the Pyrenees in 1659, Condé was pardoned by Louis XIV and returned to France. He became a loyal supporter of the king, living a quiet life at the Château de Chantilly and associating with literary figures such as Molière and Racine. Despite his renewed contributions to France&#x27;s military success in the War of Devolution against Spain and the Franco-Dutch War, his personal life was marred by his unhappy marriage and estrangement from his wife, Claire-Clémence de Maillé-Brézé, a niece of Richelieu. Condé died in 1686 at the age of 65. His descendants include the present-day pretenders to the thrones of France and Italy, and the kings of Spain and Belgium.

==Biography==
Born in Paris as the son of Henri II de Bourbon, Prince of Condé and Charlotte Marguerite de Montmorency, he was immediately endowed with the title of Duke of Enghien. His father was a first cousin-once-removed of Henry IV, the King of France, and his mother was an heiress of one of France&#x27;s leading ducal families.

His father saw to it that he received a thorough education, studying history, law, and mathematics during six years at the Jesuits&#x27; school at Bourges. After that, he entered the Royal Academy at Paris. At seventeen, in the absence of his father, he governed Burgundy.

His father betrothed him to Claire-Clémence de Maillé-Brézé, niece of Cardinal Richelieu, before he joined the army in 1640. Despite being in love with Marthe du Vigean, daughter of the king&#x27;s gentleman of the bedchamber, François Poussard, he was compelled by his father to marry his fiancée, who was thirteen. Although she bore her husband three children, Enghien later claimed she committed adultery with different men in order to justify locking her away at Châteauroux, but the charge was widely disbelieved. Saint-Simon, while admitting that she was homely and dull, praised her virtue, piety, and gentleness in the face of relentless abuse.

Enghien took part with distinction in the siege of Arras. He also won Richelieu&#x27;s favor when he was present with the Cardinal during the plot of &quot;Cinq Mars&quot; and afterwards fought in the Siege of Perpignan (1642).

==Thirty Years&#x27; War==


In 1643, Enghien was appointed to command against the Spanish in northern France. He was opposed by Francisco de Melo, and the &quot;tercios&quot; of the Spanish army who were held to be the toughest soldiers in Europe. At the Battle of Rocroi, Enghien himself conceived and directed the decisive victory.

After a campaign of uninterrupted success, Enghien returned to Paris in triumph, and tried to forget his enforced and hateful marriage with a series of affairs (after Richelieu&#x27;s death in 1642, he would unsuccessfully seek annulment of his marriage in hopes of marrying Mlle du Vigean, until she joined the order of the Carmelites in 1647). In 1644 he was sent with reinforcements into Germany to the assistance of Turenne, who was hard pressed, and took command of the whole army.

The Battle of Freiburg was desperately fought, but after Rocroi, numerous fortresses opened their gates to the Duke.

Enghien spent the next winter, as every winter during the war, amid the gaieties of Paris. The summer campaign of 1645 opened with the defeat of Turenne by Franz von Mercy at Mergentheim, but this was retrieved in the victory of Nördlingen, in which Mercy was killed, and Enghien himself received several serious wounds. The capture of Philippsburg was the most important of his other achievements during this campaign. In 1646 Enghien served under Gaston, Duke of Orléans in Flanders, and when, after the capture of Mardyck, Orléans returned to Paris, Enghien, left in command, captured Dunkirk (11 October).

==The Fronde==
When he succeeded in 1646 as &#x27;Prince of Condé,&#x27; his combination of military ability, noble status, and enormous wealth inspired considerable apprehension in Anne of Austria, regent for the young Louis XIV, and her prime minister, Mazarin. Condé&#x27;s vast domains included Burgundy and Berry, while the Prince de Conti, his brother, held Champagne, and his brother-in-law, Longueville, controlled Normandy. In 1641, Louis XIII had granted him Clermont-en-Argonne, ceded to France by the Duchy of Lorraine; in 1648, this was converted to an appanage, effectively making it independent of royal authority.

To remove Condé from Paris, Mazarin arranged for him to lead anti-Habsburg forces in the Catalan revolt known as the Reapers&#x27; War. By 1648, this had become an increasingly bitter, multi-sided conflict between the Spanish, the Catalan nobility supported by France, and the Catalan peasantry. As Mazarin had intended, Condé could achieve little; however, a Spanish revival in the Low Countries led to his recall and victory at Lens in August 1648.

When the aristocracy took up arms against new taxes in the Fronde rebellion, Condé was recalled to Court by Anne of Austria. He quickly subdued the Parlement of Paris, and the Parliamentary Fronde ended with the March 1649 Peace of Rueil. The resulting uncertain balance of power between crown and nobility inspired Condé to himself rebel, starting the far more serious &quot;Fronde des nobles&quot;. In January 1650, he was arrested, along with Conti and Longueville; imprisoned at Vincennes, and when asked if he needed reading material, he allegedly replied &#x27;The Memoirs of M de Beaufort,&#x27; who had made a dramatic escape from the same prison two years earlier.

Turenne and his brother, the Duke of Bouillon, were among those who had escaped arrest; they now demanded the prisoners&#x27; freedom, leading to a short-lived alliance between the &quot;Fronde des nobles&quot; and the &quot;Fronde des parlements.&quot; Shortly after their release in February 1651, the diverging interests of the two rebellious parties led to a shift of alliances, with the crown and Parlements against Condé&#x27;s party of the high nobility. The royal forces under Turenne defeated Condé at the Battle of the Faubourg St Antoine in July 1652, ending the Fronde as a serious military threat.

Condé only escaped when the Duchess of Montpensier persuaded the Parisians to open the gates; in September, he and a few loyalists defected to Spain. Despite victory over Turenne at Valenciennes in 1656, defeat at the Battle of the Dunes in June 1658 led to the Treaty of the Pyrenees in 1659. Bending his knee to the rising Sun King, Condé was pardoned and restored to his previous titles, but his power as an independent prince was broken.

==Rehabilitation==
Condé became a loyal supporter of Louis XIV, living quietly at the Château de Chantilly, an estate inherited from his uncle, Henri II de Montmorency. Here he assembled a brilliant circle of literary men, including Molière, Racine, Boileau, La Fontaine, Nicole, Bourdaloue, and Bossuet.

About this time, convoluted negotiations between the Poles were carried on with a view to the royal elections in Poland, at first by Condé&#x27;s son, Henri Jules de Bourbon, and afterwards by Condé himself. These were finally closed later in 1674 by the veto of King Louis XIV and the election of John Sobieski. The Prince&#x27;s retirement, which was only broken by the Polish question and by his personal intercession on behalf of Fouquet in 1664, ended in 1668.

During the 1666 to 1667 War of Devolution, Condé proposed to the Marquis de Louvois, the Minister of War, a plan for seizing Franche-Comté, the execution of which was entrusted to him and successfully carried out. He was now completely re-established in the favour of King Louis XIV, and with Turenne, was appointed the principal French commander in the celebrated campaign of 1672 against the Dutch. At the forcing of the Rhine passage at the Battle of Tolhuis (12 June), he received a severe wound, after which he commanded in Alsace against the Imperials.

In 1673, he was again engaged in the Low Countries, and in 1674, he fought his last great battle, the Battle of Seneffe, against William III of Orange. This battle, fought on 11 August, was one of the hardest of the century, and Condé, who displayed the reckless bravery of his youth, had three horses killed under him. His last campaign was that of 1675 on the Rhine, where the army had been deprived of its general by the death of Turenne; and where, by his careful and methodical strategy, he repelled the invasion of the Imperial army of Raimondo Montecuccoli.

After this campaign, prematurely worn out by toils and excesses, and tortured by gout, Condé returned to the Château de Chantilly, where he spent his last eleven years in quiet retirement. At the end of his life, Condé sought the companionship of Bourdaloue, Pierre Nicole, and Bossuet, and devoted himself to religious exercises.

In 1685, his only surviving grandson, Louis de Bourbon, married Louise Françoise, eldest surviving daughter of Louis and his mistress Madame de Montespan. In mid-1686, Louise Françoise, later known as &#x27;Madame la Duchesse&#x27;, contracted smallpox while at Fontainebleau; Condé helped nurse her back to health, and prevented Louis from seeing her for his own safety. Although Louise Françoise survived, Condé became ill, allegedly from worry over her health. He died at Fontainebleau on 11 November 1686 at the age of sixty-five and was buried at Vallery, the traditional resting place of the Princes of Condé. Bourdaloue attended him at his death-bed, and Bossuet pronounced his elegy.

Although his youthful marriage to Claire Clémence de Maillé had brought him a dowry of 600,000 livres and many lands, Condé&#x27;s lifelong resentment of his forced marriage to a social inferior persisted. In his last letter to Louis, he asked that his estranged wife never be released from her exile to the countryside. She survived until 1694.

==Issue==

Louis married Claire Clémence de Maillé, daughter of Urbain de Maillé, Marquis of Brézé and Nicole du Plessis de Richelieu, at the Palais Royal in Paris, in February 1641, in the presence of King Louis XIII of France, Anne of Austria, and Gaston of France. Their children were:

# Henri Jules de Bourbon, Duke of Enghien (29 July 1643, Paris – 1 April 1709, Paris), who later succeeded as Prince of Condé, married Princess Anne of the Palatinate &quot;Princess Palatine&quot; and had children.
# Louis de Bourbon, Duke of Bourbon (20 September 1652, Bordeaux – 11 April 1653, Bordeaux), died in infancy.
# X de Bourbon, Mademoiselle de Bourbon (1657, Breda – 28 September 1660, Paris), died in childhood.

==Legacy==
That he was capable of waging a methodical war of positions may be assumed from his campaigns against Turenne and Montecucculi, the greatest generals opposing him. But it was in his eagerness for battle, his quick decision in action, and the stern will which sent his regiments to face the heaviest losses, that Condé earned the right to be compared to the great generals of his time. Upon the &quot;Grand Condé&quot;’s death, Louis XIV pronounced that he had lost &quot;the greatest man in my kingdom.&quot; &quot;&quot;

In 1643 his success at the Battle of Rocroi, in which he led the French army to an unexpected and decisive victory over the Spanish, established him as a great general and popular hero in France. Together with the Marshal de Turenne he led the French to a favorable peace in the Thirty Years&#x27; War.

During the Fronde, he was courted by both sides, initially supporting Mazarin; he later became a leader of the princely opposition. After the defeat of the Fronde, he entered Spanish service and led their armies against France, notably at Arras, Valenciennes, and Dunkirk. He returned to France only after the Treaty of the Pyrenees in 1659 but soon received military commands again.

Condé conquered the Franche-Comté during the War of Devolution and led the French armies in the Franco-Dutch War together with Turenne. His last campaign was in 1675, taking command after Turenne had been killed, repelling an invasion of an imperial army.

Conde is regarded as an excellent tactician, a fine strategist, and one of the greatest French generals. His masterpiece, the Battle of Rocroi, is still studied by students of military strategy.

His descendants include the present-day pretenders to the throne of France and Italy and the kings of Spain and Belgium.

He was portrayed in the film &quot;Vatel&quot; by Julian Glover.

<text>The Most Serene House of Bourbon-Condé (), named after Condé-en-Brie (now in the Aisne ), was a French princely house and a cadet branch of the House of Bourbon. The name of the house was derived from the title of Prince of Condé (French: &quot;prince de Condé&quot;) that was originally assumed around 1557 by the French Protestant leader Louis de Bourbon (1530–1569), uncle of King Henry IV of France, and borne by his male-line descendants.

This line became extinct in 1830 when his eighth-generation descendant, Louis Henri Joseph de Bourbon, died without surviving male issue. The princely title was held for one last time by Louis d&#x27;Orléans, Prince of Condé, who died in 1866.

==History==
The Princes of Condé descend from the Vendôme family – the progenitors of the modern House of Bourbon. There was never a principality, sovereign or vassal, of Condé. The name merely served as the territorial source of a title adopted by Louis, who inherited from his father, Charles IV de Bourbon, duc de Vendôme (1489–1537), the lordship of Condé-en-Brie in Champagne, consisting of the Château of Condé and a dozen villages some fifty miles east of Paris.

It had passed from the sires of Avesnes, to the Counts of St. Pol. When Marie de Luxembourg-St. Pol wed François, Count of Vendôme (1470–1495) in 1487, Condé-en-Brie became part of the Bourbon-Vendôme patrimony.

===&quot;Duc de Bourbon&quot;===
After the extinction in 1527 of the Dukes of Bourbon, François&#x27;s son Charles (1489–1537) became head of the House of Bourbon, which traces its male-line descent from Robert, Count of Clermont (1256–1318), a younger son of France&#x27;s Saint-King Louis IX. Of the sons of Charles of Vendôme, the eldest, Antoine, became jure uxoris King of Navarre and fathered Henry IV.

The youngest son, Louis, inherited the lordships of Meaux, Nogent, Condé, and Soissons as his appanage. Louis was titled Prince of Condé in a parliamentary document on 15 January 1557 and, without any legal authority beyond their dignity as princes of the Blood Royal, they continued to bear it for the next three centuries. He was succeeded by his son Henri I de Bourbon, prince de Condé.

Louis, the first Prince, actually gave the Condé property to his youngest son, Charles (1566–1612), Count of Soissons. Charles&#x27; only son Louis (1604–1641) left Condé and Soissons to female heirs in 1624, who married into the Savoy and Orléans-Longueville dynasties.

===&quot;Monsieur le Prince&quot;===
Upon the accession to France&#x27;s throne of Henry IV of Bourbon in 1589, his first cousin-once-removed Henry, Prince of Condé (1588–1646), was heir presumptive to the crown until 1601. Although Henry&#x27;s own descendants thereafter held the senior positions within the royal family of dauphin, Fils de France, and petits-fils de France, from 1589 to 1709 the Princes of Condé coincidentally held the rank at court of &quot;premier prince du sang royal&quot; (First Prince of the Blood Royal), to which was attached income, precedence, and ceremonial privilege (such as the exclusive right to be addressed as &quot;Monsieur le prince&quot; at court).

However, the position of &quot;premier prince&quot; devolved upon the &quot;ducs d&#x27;Orléans&quot; in 1710, so the seventh Prince, Louis III (1668–1710) declined to make use of the title, preferring instead to be known by his hereditary peerage of Duke of Bourbon, which still afforded him the right to be known as &quot;Monsieur le Duc&quot;. Subsequent heirs likewise preferred the ducal to the princely title.

===Later===
After the death of Henry III Jules de Bourbon, prince de Condé in 1709, the family were in regular attendance at court. Louis de Bourbon-Condé (at that point known as the &quot;Duke of Bourbon&quot;) had in 1685 married Louise-Françoise de Bourbon, the legitimated daughter of Louis XIV of France and Françoise-Athénaïs, marquise de Montespan.

The couple had many children and produced an heir to the Condé titles and lands. Their son was Louis Henri de Bourbon-Condé, &quot;duc de Bourbon&quot;.
He led a quiet life and was known at court as Monsieur le Duc after the loss of the rank of &quot;premier prince du sang&quot; in 1723. After his death the family retreated from court life but Louis Joseph de Bourbon, prince de Condé was vital in the forming of the Army of Condé - formed to support his cousin Louis XVI during his imprisonment during the revolution. He was the longest holder of the title, being known as the prince de Condé for seventy-eight years.

His son married the sister of Louis Philippe II d&#x27;Orléans better known as Philippe Égalité. She was called Louise Marie Thérèse Bathilde d&#x27;Orléans. She was the last princesse de Condé and mother of Louis-Antoine-Henri de Bourbon-Condé - titled &quot;duc d&#x27;Enghien&quot;. He was executed by Napoleon I of France at the Château de Vincennes. With the death of the duc d&#x27;Enghien, the heir to the Condé name, his father was the last holder of the title.

After his death in 1830 the Condé lands passed to the last prince&#x27;s cousin Henri Eugène Philippe Louis d&#x27;Orléans, duc d&#x27;Aumale whose eldest son Louis was later a &quot;prince de Condé&quot; after gaining the title from his father.

== Simplified Bourbon family tree ==
==Cadet branches==
===House of Bourbon-Conti===

The &quot;House of Bourbon-Conti&quot; was formed in 1581 by François de Bourbon, prince de Conti. He was the son of Louis I de Bourbon, prince de Condé. The house became extinct in 1814 upon the death of Louis François II de Bourbon, prince de Conti.

The Princes of Conti were as follows:
* 1558–1614: marquis, then from 1581 onwards 1st prince François de Bourbon.

&quot;At his death, the title became extinct because the prince died without issue. The title was assumed in 1629 by:&quot;

* 1629–1666: 2nd prince Armand de Bourbon-Conti
* 1666–1685: 3rd prince Louis Armand I de Bourbon-Conti
* 1685–1709: 4th prince Francis Louis de Bourbon-Conti
* 1709–1727: 5th prince Louis Armand II de Bourbon-Conti
* 1727–1776: 6th prince Louis Francis I de Bourbon-Conti
* 1776–1814: 7th prince Louis Francis II de Bourbon-Conti

===House of Bourbon-Soissons===

The first prince de Conti was also the brother of the founder of the &quot;House of Bourbon-Soissons&quot;, Charles de Bourbon-Soissons. The comtes de Soissons were addressed at court as &quot;Monsieur le Comte&quot; and their wives as &quot;Madame la Comtesse&quot;. The members of the house were:

* 1487–1495: François de Bourbon-Vendôme (1470–1495);
* 1495–1537: Charles de Bourbon-Vendôme (1489–1537), comte (&quot;jure matris&quot;), son of the preceding;
* 1547–1557: Jean de Bourbon-Soissons (1528–1557), son of the preceding;
* 1557–1569: Louis I de Bourbon, prince de Condé (1535–1569), brother of the preceding;
* 1569–1612: Charles de Bourbon, comte de Soissons (1566–1612), son of the preceding;
* 1612–1641: Louis de Bourbon, comte de Soissons (1604–1641), son of the preceding;
* 1641–1656: Marie de Bourbon-Soissons (1606–1692), sister of the preceding.

The line started in 1566 when the title of Count of Soissons was given to Charles de Bourbon-Condé, the second son of Louis I de Bourbon, prince de Condé, the first Prince of Condé. The Soissons title had been acquired by the first Prince of Condé in 1557 and was held by his descendants for two more generations with Charles de Bourbon-Condé, 1st comte de Soissons, and Louis de Bourbon-Condé, 2nd comte de Soissons.

The 2nd comte de Soissons died without an heir, so the Soissons estates passed to his younger sister, Marie de Bourbon-Condé, the wife of Thomas Francis, Prince of Carignano, a younger brother of the sovereign Duke of Savoy. Although she received 400,000 livres in annual revenues from the Soissons estates, lived in the Hôtel de Soissons where, according to Saint-Simon, she &quot;maintained the traditions of the Soissons&quot;, she continued to be known as the princesse de Carignan. On her death, the Soissons countship passed first to her second son, Prince Joseph-Emmanuel of Savoy-Carignano (1631–1656), and then to her third son, Prince Eugène-Maurice of Savoy-Carignano. He married Olympia Mancini, niece of Cardinal Mazarin. She was known as &quot;Madame la Comtesse de Soissons&quot;. On his death, the title went to his eldest son, Prince Louis Thomas of Savoy-Carignano, who was the older brother of the famous Austrian general, Prince Eugene of Savoy. The Soissons countship became extinct upon the death of Prince Eugène-Jean-François of Savoy-Carignano in 1734.

==Princes of Condé==
===First creation: 1546–1830 – House of Bourbon===
===Second creation: 1845 –1866 – House of Orléans===
==Styles of address==
The eldest sons of the Princes of Condé used the title of Duke of Enghien and were addressed as &quot;Monsieur le Duc&quot; until that style came to be pre-empted by their fathers, as Dukes of Bourbon, after 1709. The Princes of Condé were also the male-line ancestors of the branches of the Princes of Conti (which flourished 1629–1814) and the Counts of Soissons (1566–1641).

Although both the sons and daughters of these branches of the House of Bourbon held the rank of &quot;princes et princesses du sang&quot;, it never became the custom in France for them to use prince or princess as a prefix to their Christian names. Rather, sons took a title of French nobility (count or duke), suffixed with their appanage (e.g. Count of Charolais), while unmarried daughters used one of their fathers&#x27; subsidiary properties to form a courtesy style (e.g. Mademoiselle de Clermont).

==Family residences==

The Hôtel de Condé became the Parisian base of the Condé family in 1610, in what is now the 6th district of Paris. In 1722, Louise-Françoise de Bourbon, wife of Louis III, Prince of Condé, started building the Palais Bourbon, which in 1764 became the Condé family&#x27;s main Parisian residence. They sold the Hôtel de Condé to the King in 1770, and it was demolished around 1780 to be replaced by a new neighborhood around the theater that later became known as the Odéon. Another Parisian property, still known as the Hôtel de Bourbon-Condé (12 rue Monsieur), was built and inhabited between 1780 and 1789 by Louise Adélaïde de Bourbon-Condé. 

The family had several residences outside Paris – the Château de Condé in Condé-en-Brie, Picardy, which they ceased to own by 1624; the Château de Vallery, built from 1548 for the Marshal of Saint André, acquired by Louis I de Bourbon-Condé in 1564 and kept by the family until 1747; and the Château de Chantilly, previously a Montmorency property from 1484 to 1632 and a Condé estate afterward. The latter was the home of the Grand Condé during his exile from court, and the host château of a party given in honour of King Louis XIV of France in 1671. It was confiscated during the French Revolution and eventually came into the possession of King Louis Philippe of France, who gave it to his youngest son, Henri d&#x27;Orléans, duc d&#x27;Aumale.

<text>Johan Nygaardsvold (; 6 September 1879 – 13 March 1952) was a Norwegian politician from the Labour Party who served as the prime minister of Norway from 1935 to 1945. From June 1940 until May 1945, he oversaw the Norwegian Government-in-exile from London as head of the Nygaardsvold cabinet during the occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany.

==Background==
Nygaardsvold was born in Hommelvik, the administrative centre of Malvik Municipality in the county of Sør-Trøndelag, Norway. His parents were Anders Nygaardsvold (1839–1897) and Andrea Ratvold (1845–1929). His father was a tenant farmer and a founding member of the first labour union in the area. Johan took his first job as a lumber mill worker when he was 12 years old. On 6 June 1901, he married Albine Regine Brandslet (1878–1961).

Nygaardsvold and his wife emigrated to Canada in 1902 where he took jobs in British Columbia, and in the US in Kalispell, Montana, and Spokane, Washington. He and his wife returned to Norway in 1907 after he had followed a career including as an Industrial Workers of the World agitator. In 1909 he found a job at Hommelvik Sawmill.

==Political career==
In 1910, Nygaardsvold was elected to the board of education for the Labour Party, and rose quickly through the ranks in local politics. In 1916, he was elected to the Norwegian parliament for the first time, serving continuously until 1949. He worked as a labourer in the Swedish lumber industry during the summers in the first few years. From 1920 to 1922 he served as the mayor for his home town of Malvik.

In 1928, Nygaardsvold was appointed minister of agriculture in the short-lived Christopher Hornsrud cabinet. From 11 January 1934 to 20 March 1935 he served as President of the Storting. In 1935, Nygaardsvold was asked to form a government as Prime Minister of Norway.
He was serving as Prime Minister when Nazi Germany attacked on Norway 9 April 1940. Following the German occupation of Norway, German officials demanded that the Government headed by Nygaardsvold capitulate and that the King appoint a government headed by Nazi sympathiser Vidkun Quisling. King Haakon VII stated that he could not comply with the German ultimatum and would rather abdicate than appoint Quisling prime minister. On 7 June 1940, the Norwegian Government-in-exile relocated to London. Nygaardsvold continued as prime minister in exile until the government returned to Norway on 31 May 1945. He resigned on 25 June 1945 when King Haakon appointed Einar Gerhardsen to head an interim government composed of all political parties.

A number of progressive reforms were instituted during Nygaardsvold&#x27;s time as prime minister. Reforms included the introduction of national pension insurance, compulsory unemployment insurance for many employees and workers outside the primary sector. Another piece of legislation, the Worker Protection Act, regulated working hours in industry and mining, including granting public holidays, mandated health inspections for workers in &quot;unhealthy&quot; industries, and granted maternity leave. The same Act raised the age for admission to employment in industry, commerce, offices, and land transport from 14 to 15 years. Legislation was also enacted mandating inspections of electrical equipment in some industries. An old-age pension was introduced for Norwegian citizens over 70 years old. A disability pension was also introduced. Another set of reforms involved stabilising pay rates, setting payment intervals, and regulating dismissal and providing certain rights to dismissed workers, and businesses with more than ten employees were required to have &quot;rules of employment&quot;.

An Act on 18 June 1938 empowered &quot;the Government to issue regulations dealing with the length of working hours and with medical inspection of workers exposed to X-rays, radium and the radio-active substances. In addition, under an Order of the 18th of November 1938, the enforcement of the Workers&#x27; Protection Act on the State railways has been brought within the competence of the ordinary labour inspectorate&quot;. An Act of the 8th of April 1938 provides that &quot;any company or private undertaking with a share capital or net assets amounting to 100,000 crowns must make appropriations to a Labour Fund. Certain types of undertakings, particularly in agriculture, forestry and fishing, are however exempt from this obligation. Contributions are compulsory only when the net profits of the undertaking exceed a certain percentage of its invested capital; the rate varies with the financial results of each business year. The moneys of the Labour Fund are to be used for payment of old-age and invalidity pensions or for relief of unemployment due to the suspension, transformation or restriction of the work of the undertaking&quot;.

Detailed regulations concerning all kinds of electrical installations were issued on 29 December 1939, and regulations concerning cinemas and films were promulgated on the 20 February 1939. Instructions issued on 31 March 1938 for officials of the State Labour Inspectorate prescribed &quot;in considerable detail the duties and powers of the Chief Labour Inspector, the general and special Labour Inspectors, the Assistant Labour Inspectors and the Labour Boards with respect to the enforcement of the Workers&#x27; Protection Act. The instructions specify that the inspector is to be impartial and is to try to convince both employers and workers of the value of the provisions of the Act. He is to act as an adviser to both parties in all matters connected with the Act&quot;. An Act of 10 March and a decree of 24 March 1939 &quot;regulate inspection on board ship&quot;. An Act of 20 May 1939 amended the compulsory sickness insurance scheme &quot;by permitting sickness funds which do not enter into a contract with doctors to pay directly to the practitioners the amounts due for medical treatment given to insured persons. This new rule dispenses the insured persons from the need for advancing the doctors&#x27; fees and enables the funds to exercise more effective supervision than in the past over the treatment given by the doctors&quot;. Also, in &quot;the event of an accident due to the war and involving permanent incapacity or death seamen are now entitled to pensions and allowances in accordance with the provisions laid down by the Act of 12 March 1937 and the Royal Order of 21 May 1937. This means that the maximum rates of wages taken as a basis for calculating pensions and allowances are doubled. In addition, any seaman who is totally incapacitated as a result of a war injury receives a lump sum of 10,000 Kr. In the event of death his dependants (widow and children under 15 years) receive, in addition to their pensions, a lump sum of the same amount as for permanent incapacity&quot;.

Under a Royal Order of 22 December 1939 issued in pursuance of a decision of the Storting of the 15 September 1939, the State made &quot;itself responsible for the risks of persons engaged in sea fishing, including seal hunting and also, to some extent, whaling. In case of an accident due to an act of war the protection resulting from this provision is similar to that granted to seamen. If the ship is lost the fishermen concerned also receive allowances at specified rates for the resulting unemployment and for the loss of their belongings&quot;. A State Holiday Council (&quot;Statens Ferierad&quot;) was set up, and an Act of 15 February 1918 “was amended by an Act of 20 May 1939 to secure better supervision of home work. The Act provides for this purpose that the records kept by employers or sub-contractors must henceforward contain, as well as the workers&#x27; names and addresses, information on the nature of the work performed and the minimum wages paid. The powers of the labour inspectorate in particular have also been increased as regards home work&quot;.

Nygaardsvold was elected to the Storting for the last time in the autumn of 1945. At the end of the Storting term in 1949, he retired from politics. That year, he was awarded the Medal for Outstanding Civic Service (&quot;Borgerdådsmedaljen&quot;). He returned to Hommelvik and died of cancer in Trondheim in 1952. He was buried at Hommelvik Church in Malvik Municipality.
==Historical legacy==
During his time in office, Nygaardsvold had immense popular appeal and was given credit for the Labour Party&#x27;s election results in 1933. Nygaardsvold was the prime minister in the second Labour Party cabinet in Norway, after he helped formulate the so-called &quot;crisis accord&quot; with the Farmers&#x27; Party. His government&#x27;s domestic policy was largely dedicated to recovering from the Great Depression but is most noted for its foreign and military policy in the years leading up to the occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany and his administration in exile from 1940 to 1945. The investigative commission that issued a report after the liberation of Norway found that he could not be absolved from responsibility for the lack of operational readiness for the German invasion but gave him credit for his management of a unity government in exile. He was awarded an honorary salary for his service in exile but refused to accept it.

<text>Frederick Walter Stephen West (29 September 1941 – 1 January 1995) was an English serial killer, who committed at least twelve murders between 1967 and 1987 in Gloucestershire, the majority with his second wife, Rose West.

All the victims were young women. At least eight of the murders involved the Wests&#x27; sexual gratification and included rape, bondage, torture, and mutilation; the victims&#x27; dismembered bodies were typically buried in the cellar or garden of the West residence in Gloucester, which became known as the &quot;House of Horrors&quot;. Fred is known to have committed at least two murders on his own; Rose is known to have murdered Fred&#x27;s stepdaughter, Charmaine. The couple were arrested and charged in 1994.

Fred fatally asphyxiated himself while detained on remand at HM Prison Birmingham on 1 January 1995, at which time he and Rose were jointly charged with nine murders, and he with three further murders. In November 1995, Rose was convicted of ten murders and sentenced to ten life terms with a whole life order.
==Early life==
===Childhood===
Frederick Walter Stephen West was born on 29 September 1941, at Bickerton Cottage, Much Marcle, Herefordshire, the first surviving child of Walter Stephen West (1914–1992) and Daisy Hannah Hill (1922–1968). Fred was from a poor family of farm workers, close-knit and mutually protective; his father was a disciplinarian and his mother overprotective.
In 1946 the family moved to Moorcourt Cottage, a semi-detached building adjacent to Moorcourt Farm, on the outskirts of Much Marcle, where Fred&#x27;s father worked as a milking herdsman and harvest hand. The cottage had no electricity and was heated by a log fire. By 1951 Fred&#x27;s mother had given birth to eight children, six of whom survived; Fred was always his mother&#x27;s favourite. He was seen as a mother&#x27;s boy and relied mostly on his siblings for companionship.

The West children were expected to perform assigned chores and all six did seasonal work, the three girls picking hops and strawberries, the three boys harvesting wheat and hunting rabbits. The necessity of working to earn a living and to survive instilled a strong work ethic in Fred, who also developed a lifelong habit of petty theft.

Classmates later recalled Fred as scruffy, dim, lethargic, and regularly in trouble. Throughout his life he remained barely literate, yet displayed an aptitude for woodwork and artwork. He left school in December 1956 at the age of 15, first working as a labourer at Moorcourt Farm.

Fred later claimed that he had been sexually abused by his mother at age 12, that he had engaged in acts of bestiality in his early teens, and that his belief that incest was normal stemmed from his father&#x27;s incest with Fred&#x27;s sisters. Fred&#x27;s youngest brother, Doug, dismissed these claims as fantasy.

===Adolescence===
By 1957, Fred and his brother John frequently socialised at a youth club in nearby Ledbury, where his distinct and guttural Herefordshire accent marked him as a &quot;country bumpkin&quot;. He aggressively pestered women and girls, whom he objectified as sources of pleasure to be used as he saw fit, and would abruptly approach and fondle them. When a girl accepted his advances, she would find his sexual performance unsatisfying, as his primary objective was his own gratification.

At age 17, Fred suffered a fractured skull, a broken arm, and a broken leg in a motorcycle accident. He was unconscious for seven days and walked with braces for several months; because of this incident, he developed an extreme fear of hospitals and became prone to fits of rage. Two years later, Fred suffered a further head injury when a girl he groped on a fire escape outside the Ledbury Youth Club punched him, sending him falling two floors.

In June 1961, Fred&#x27;s 13-year-old sister, Kitty, told her mother that Fred had been raping her since the previous December, and had impregnated her. Fred was arrested, and freely admitted to police he had been molesting young girls since his early teens and asked: &quot;Doesn&#x27;t everybody do it?&quot; He was tried on 9 November at Herefordshire Assizes. Although disgusted by her son&#x27;s actions, Fred&#x27;s mother had been prepared to testify in his defence. Immediately prior to her scheduled testimony, Kitty changed her mind and refused to testify, and the case collapsed. Much of Fred&#x27;s family effectively disowned him, his mother banished him from the household, and he moved into the Much Marcle house of his aunt Violet. By mid-1962, he had reconciled with his parents, but not with most of his family.

==Catherine &quot;Rena&quot; Costello==

===Marriage===
Fred became re-acquainted with Catherine (Rena) Bernadette Costello in September 1962, when he was 21. He had first met Costello, who came from Coatbridge, Lanarkshire, at a Much Marcle dance hall in 1960, and dated her for several months before she returned to Scotland. Costello was pregnant by a Pakistani bus driver at the time of her marriage to Fred, and may have relocated from Glasgow to England due to members of her family expressing their displeasure at her being pregnant with a mixed-race child. She married Fred in Ledbury on 17 November, the sole guest being Fred&#x27;s younger brother John. The couple initially lived in Fred&#x27;s aunt&#x27;s home, then moved to Coatbridge, where Fred worked as an ice cream van driver. Rena&#x27;s daughter, Charmaine, was born in March 1963; to explain the child&#x27;s mixed ancestry, Rena and Fred claimed that she had suffered a miscarriage and that Charmaine was adopted. Shortly thereafter, the couple relocated to Savoy Street, in the Bridgeton district of Glasgow.

In July 1964, Rena and Fred had a daughter, Anna Marie. The child was born at the couple&#x27;s Savoy Street home. The family nanny, Isa McNeill, and neighbours of the Wests, recall Rena as a considerate mother &quot;struggling to bring up two children&quot;; Fred treated the children harshly. He kept the girls in the bottom of a bunk bed with bars fitted to the space between the bunks, effectively caging them; they were allowed out only when he was at work.

Via McNeill, the Wests became acquainted with her friend, 16-year-old Anne McFall, who was despondent over the death of her boyfriend in a workplace accident. McFall spent a great deal of time at the Wests&#x27; flat.

Fred later admitted to having engaged in numerous affairs in the early years of his marriage, and fathered one illegitimate child with a woman from the Gorbals. When Rena discovered her husband&#x27;s infidelity, she began an affair with a man named John McLachlan. On one occasion, Fred discovered the pair in an embrace. He punched Rena, making her scream. In response, McLachlan punched Fred, who drew a knife and grazed McLachlan&#x27;s abdomen. When punched by McLachlan a second time, Fred stopped defending himself. Years later, McLachlan recollected this incident: &quot;He couldn&#x27;t tackle a man, but he wasn&#x27;t so slow in attacking women.&quot; He and Rena continued their affair, and McLachlan became increasingly aghast at Rena&#x27;s bruises and black eyes. On each occasion it became apparent Fred had beaten his wife, McLachlan extensively beat Fred. In another instance, McLachlan witnessed Charmaine—little older than a toddler—ask Fred for an ice cream from his van; in response, Fred struck her across the head, triggering another beating from McLachlan.

On 4 November 1965, Fred accidentally ran over and killed a small boy in Glasgow with his van. He was cleared of any wrongdoing by police, but feared the hostile reaction and potential reprisals for the accident from the locals, upon whom he relied to make his living. In December, he returned to Gloucester with Charmaine and Anna Marie, renting a caravan at the Timberland Caravan Park in Bishop&#x27;s Cleeve. Rena joined him in February 1966, accompanied by McNeill and McFall, who also moved into Fred&#x27;s caravan (McNeill and McFall both came from impoverished backgrounds; both hoped to find work in England). Shortly after the move south, Fred found employment driving a lorry for a local abattoir.

By early 1966, Fred had begun to exhibit dominance and control over all three women. He was also prone to violent mood swings, and Rena and McNeill typically bore the brunt of his fury; Fred also physically attacked his stepdaughter more than once. He is also reported to have begun sexually abusing Charmaine, and to have encouraged Rena to turn to prostitution to supplement his meagre income.

To escape Fred&#x27;s domestic abuse and increasingly sadistic sexual demands, Rena phoned McLachlan, begging him to rescue her, McNeill and her children. Together, McLachlan, Rena, and McNeill devised a plan; he and McNeill&#x27;s boyfriend, John Trotter, would secretly drive to Bishop&#x27;s Cleeve in McLachlan&#x27;s Mini and discreetly take Rena, her children and McNeill back to Scotland. McFall had by this stage become infatuated with Fred, who had promised to marry her. It is likely she informed Fred of the plan, as he arrived at the meeting time, and McFall was &quot;oddly calm&quot; as she informed McNeill she intended to remain with Fred to work as the children&#x27;s nanny. An altercation ensued between Fred and McLachlan, resulting in Fred being struck several times as he clutched onto Charmaine and Anna Marie. Police were called and McLachlan, Trotter, McNeill, and Rena left, with Fred threatening to kill Rena should he ever see her again.

To ensure her daughters&#x27; well-being, Rena frequently travelled to England to visit Charmaine and Anna Marie while they lived with Fred at Bishop&#x27;s Cleeve. Despite initially maintaining her friendship with McFall, Rena soon began to resent her matriarchal presence around her daughters. On 11 October, in an act of resentment, Rena stole some belongings from Fred&#x27;s caravan and returned to Glasgow. She was arrested the following month and returned to Gloucester to face trial. On 29 November, Rena was sentenced to three years&#x27; probation. Fred testified at the hearing, admitting he and McFall were living together, but falsely claiming McFall intended to return to Scotland imminently.

After the trial, McFall moved into a caravan at the Timberland Caravan Park; Rena alternated between living with Fred and returning to Glasgow. Letters McFall posted to her family and McNeill in Glasgow between 1966 and 1967 indicate she believed a relationship with Fred could offer her a better life than that she had experienced in Scotland, and she tried to persuade Fred to divorce his wife and marry her.

===Murder of Anne McFall===
In July 1967, McFall, aged 18 and eight months pregnant with Fred&#x27;s child, vanished. She was never reported missing, but her dismembered remains were found buried at the edge of a cornfield between Much Marcle and Kempley in June 1994. Her limbs had been carefully disarticulated, and many phalanges (finger bones) were missing from her body—likely to have been retained as keepsakes; her unborn child may also have been cut from her womb. Fred initially denied he had killed McFall, but confided to one visitor following his arrest that he had stabbed her to death following an argument. This explanation is inconsistent with the fact that her wrists were found with sections of dressing gown cord wrapped around them, suggesting she had been restrained prior to her murder.

The following month, Rena returned to live with Fred, and the couple relocated to the Lake House Caravan Park. Their relationship initially improved, but Rena left the following year, again leaving the children in his care. On these occasions when Fred had no one to supervise and care for the girls, he temporarily placed them in the care of Gloucestershire social services.

==Rosemary Letts==

Fred first encountered Rosemary Letts in early 1969, shortly after her 15th birthday. The pair first met while waiting for the same bus in Cheltenham. Initially, Rose was repulsed by the then-27-year-old Fred&#x27;s unkempt appearance and deduced he was a tramp, but she quickly became flattered by the attention Fred continued to lavish on her over the following days as he invariably sat alongside her at the same bus stop. Rose twice refused to go on a date with Fred, but allowed him to accompany her home. In their initial conversations, Fred quickly discovered that although Rose had never had a boyfriend, she was overtly promiscuous. He also extracted a degree of sympathy from her by claiming he and his two daughters had been abandoned by his wife, and that he wished for more children.

Having discovered Rose worked in a nearby bread shop, a few days after their first encounter, Fred persuaded an unknown woman to enter the premises and present her with a gift accompanied by the explanation that a &quot;man outside&quot; had asked her to present this gift to her. Minutes later, Fred entered the premises and asked Rose to accompany him on a date that evening; she accepted the offer. Shortly thereafter, Rose began a relationship with Fred, becoming a frequent visitor at the Lake House Caravan Park and a willing childminder to Charmaine and Anna Marie, who she noted were neglected and whom she initially treated with care and affection. On several occasions in the early days of their courtship, Rose insisted she and Fred take the girls on excursions to gather wild flowers.

Within weeks of her first meeting Fred, Rose left her job at the bread shop in order to become the nanny to Charmaine and Anna Marie; this decision was made with the agreement that Fred would provide her with sufficient money to give to her parents on Fridays to convince them she was still obtaining a salary at the bread shop. Several months later, Rose introduced Fred to her family, who were aghast at their daughter&#x27;s choice of partner. Rose&#x27;s mother, Daisy Letts, was unimpressed with Fred&#x27;s braggadocio, and correctly concluded he was a pathological liar; her father, Bill Letts—a diagnosed schizophrenic who is believed to have molested his daughter—vehemently disapproved of the relationship, threatening Fred directly and promising to call social services if he continued to date Rose.

===Relationship===
Rose&#x27;s parents forbade their daughter from continuing to date Fred, but she defied their wishes, prompting them to visit Gloucestershire social services to explain that their 15-year-old daughter was dating an older man, and that they had heard rumours that she had begun to engage in prostitution at his caravan. In response, Rose was placed in a home for troubled teenagers in Cheltenham in August 1969, and only allowed to leave under controlled conditions. When allowed to return home to visit her parents at weekends, Rose almost invariably took the opportunity to visit Fred.

On her 16th birthday, Rose left the home for troubled teenagers to return to her parents (Fred at the time serving a 30-day sentence for theft and unpaid fines). Upon Fred&#x27;s release, Rose left her parents&#x27; home to move into the Cheltenham flat Fred then lived in. Shortly thereafter, Fred collected Charmaine and Anna Marie from social services. Bill Letts made one final effort to prevent his daughter from seeing Fred, and Rose was examined by a police surgeon in February 1970, who confirmed she was pregnant. In response, Rose was again placed into care, but was discharged on 6 March on the understanding she would terminate her pregnancy and return to her family. Instead, Rose opted to live with Fred, resulting in her father forbidding his daughter from ever again setting foot in his household.

Three months later, the couple vacated the Cheltenham flat and relocated to the ground floor flat of a two-storey house in Midland Road, Gloucester. On 17 October 1970, Rose gave birth to their first child: a daughter they named Heather Ann (speculation remains that Heather may have been sired by Rose&#x27;s own father). Two months later, Fred was imprisoned for the theft of car tyres and a vehicle tax disc. He remained imprisoned until 24 June 1971. As he served this six-and-a-half-month sentence, Rose, having just turned 17, looked after the three girls, with Charmaine and Anna Marie being told to refer to Rose as their mother.

According to Anna Marie, she and Charmaine were frequently subjected to criticism, beatings, and other forms of punishment throughout the time they lived under Rose&#x27;s care at Midland Road. Although Anna Marie was generally submissive and prone to display emotion in response to the physical and mental hardships she and her sister endured, Charmaine repeatedly infuriated Rose by her stoic refusal to either cry or display any sign of grief or servitude no matter how severely she was physically abused. Despite the years of neglect and abuse, Charmaine&#x27;s spirit had not been broken, and she talked wistfully to Anna Marie of the belief she held that her &quot;mummy will come and save me&quot;. Anna Marie later recollected her sister repeatedly antagonised Rose by making statements such as: &quot;My real mummy wouldn&#x27;t swear or shout at us&quot; in response to Rose&#x27;s scathing language. A childhood friend of Charmaine&#x27;s named Tracey Giles, who had lived in the upper flat of 25 Midland Road, would later recollect an incident in which she had entered the Wests&#x27; flat, unannounced, only to see Charmaine, naked and standing upon a chair, gagged and with her hands bound behind her back with a belt, as Rose stood alongside the child with a large wooden spoon in her hand. According to Giles, Charmaine had been &quot;calm and unconcerned&quot;, while Anna Marie had been standing by the door with a blank expression on her face.

Hospital records reveal Charmaine had received treatment for a severe puncture wound to her left ankle in the casualty unit of the Gloucester Royal Hospital on 28 March 1971. This incident was explained by Rose to have resulted from a household accident.

===Murder of Charmaine West===
Rose is believed to have killed Charmaine shortly before Fred&#x27;s prison release date of 24 June 1971. She is known to have taken Charmaine, Anna Marie and Heather to visit Fred on 15 June. It is believed to be on or very shortly after this date that Charmaine was murdered. As well as forensic odontology confirmation that Charmaine had died while Fred was still incarcerated, further testimony from Tracey Giles&#x27; mother, Shirley, corroborated the fact that Charmaine had been murdered before Fred had been released on 24 June. In her later testimony at Rose&#x27;s trial, Shirley stated she and her family had lived in the upper flat of Midland Road in 1971 and that her two daughters had been playmates of Charmaine and Anna Marie. She stated that after her family had vacated the upper flat of Midland Road in April 1971, on one day in June, she had brought Tracey to visit Charmaine, only for Tracey to be told by Rose: &quot;She&#x27;s gone to live with her mother, and bloody good riddance!&quot; before Tracey began to weep. Giles was adamant Fred was still in prison on this occasion.

As with the Giles family, Rose explained Charmaine&#x27;s disappearance to others who enquired about her whereabouts by claiming that Rena had called and taken her eldest daughter to live with her in Bristol; she informed staff at Charmaine&#x27;s primary school that the child had moved with her mother to London. When Fred was released from prison on 24 June, he allayed Anna Marie&#x27;s concerns for her sister&#x27;s whereabouts by claiming her mother had collected Charmaine and returned to Scotland. In her autobiography, &quot;Out of the Shadows&quot;, Anna Marie recollected that when she asked why her mother had collected Charmaine but not her, Fred callously replied: &quot;She wouldn&#x27;t want you, love. You&#x27;re the wrong colour.&quot;

Charmaine&#x27;s body was initially stowed in the coal cellar of Midland Road until Fred was released from prison. He later buried her naked body in the yard close to the back door of the flat, and remained adamant he had not dismembered her. A subsequent autopsy suggested the body had been severed at the hip; this damage may have been caused by building work Fred conducted at the property in 1976. Several bones—particularly patellae, finger, wrist, toe and ankle bones—were missing from her skeleton, leading to the speculation the missing parts had been retained as keepsakes (this proved to be a distinctive discovery in all the autopsies of the victims exhumed in 1994).

===Murder of Catherine &quot;Rena&quot; West===
Rena maintained sporadic contact with her children on each occasion she and Fred separated. She is also known to have visited Moorcourt Cottage to enquire as to her children&#x27;s whereabouts and welfare in the latter half of August 1971. Fred&#x27;s sister-in-law, Christine, later recollected Rena was depressed and extremely anxious about her children&#x27;s welfare. Being provided with Fred&#x27;s Midland Road address, Rena sought to confront him—likely to discuss or demand custody of her daughters. This was the final time Rena was seen alive. She is believed to have been murdered by strangulation, possibly in the back seat of Fred&#x27;s Ford Popular and likely while intoxicated. When her body was discovered, a short length of metal tubing was found with her remains, leaving an equal possibility she had been restrained and subjected to a sexual assault prior to her murder. Rena&#x27;s body was extensively dismembered, placed into plastic bags, and buried close to a cluster of trees known as Yewtree Coppice at Letterbox Field, about from Much Marcle.

==Marriage to Letts==
On 29 January 1972, Fred and Rosemary married. The ceremony took place at Gloucester Register Office, with Fred incorrectly describing himself upon the marriage certificate as a bachelor. No family or friends were invited apart from Fred&#x27;s brother John, who acted as best man. Several months later, with Rose pregnant with her second child, the couple moved from Midland Road to an address nearby: 25 Cromwell Street. Initially, the three-storey home was rented from the council; Fred later purchased the property from the council for £7,000. To facilitate the Wests&#x27; purchasing the property from the council, many of the upper floor rooms were initially converted into bedsits to supplement the household income. To maintain a degree of privacy for his own family, Fred installed a cooker and a washbasin on the first-floor landing in order that their lodgers need not enter the ground floor where the West family lived, and only he and his family were permitted access to the garden of the property. On 1 June, Rose gave birth to a second daughter. The date of her birth led Fred and Rose to name the child Mae June.

===Prostitution===
Shortly after giving birth to her second child, Rose began to work as a prostitute, operating from an upstairs room at their residence and advertising her services in a local contact magazine. Fred encouraged Rose to seek clients in Gloucester&#x27;s West Indian community through these advertisements. In addition to her prostitution, Rose engaged in casual sex with both male and female lodgers within their household, and individuals Fred encountered via his work; she also bragged to several people that no man or woman could completely satisfy her. When engaging in sexual relations with women, Rose would gradually increase the level of brutality to which she subjected her partner with acts such as partially suffocating her partner, or inserting increasingly large dildos into her partner&#x27;s body. If the woman resisted or expressed any pain or fear, this would greatly excite Rose, who would typically ask: &quot;Aren&#x27;t you woman enough to take it?&quot;

To many of these women, it became apparent Rose and her husband (who regularly participated in threesomes with his wife and her lovers) took a particular pleasure from seeking to take women beyond their sexual limits—typically via sessions involving bondage, as the Wests openly admitted to taking a particular pleasure from any form of sex involving a strong measure of dominance, pain and violence. To cater to these fetishes, they amassed a large collection of bondage and restraining devices, magazines and photographs—later expanding this collection to include videos depicting bestiality and graphic child sexual abuse.

Rose controlled the West family finances, Fred giving her his pay packets. The room Rose used for prostitution was known throughout the West household as &quot;Rose&#x27;s Room&quot;, and had several hidden peepholes allowing Fred—a longtime voyeur—to watch her entertain her clients. He also installed a baby monitor in the room, allowing him to listen from elsewhere in the house. The room included a private bar, and a red light outside the door warned when Rose was not to be disturbed. Rose carried the sole key to this room around her neck, and Fred installed a separate doorbell to the household which Rose&#x27;s clients were instructed to ring whenever they visited the household. Much of the money earned from Rose&#x27;s prostitution was spent on home improvements.

By 1977, Rose&#x27;s father had come to tolerate his daughter&#x27;s marriage, and to develop a grudging respect for Fred. Together, he and Fred opened a café they named The Green Lantern, which was soon insolvent. When Bill Letts discovered Rose&#x27;s prostitution, he would also visit to have sex with his daughter. By 1983, she had given birth to eight children, at least three of whom were conceived by clients. Fred willingly accepted these children as his own, and falsely informed them the reason their skin was darker than that of their siblings was because his great-grandmother was a black woman.

===Domestic violence===
When each of the West children reached the age of seven, they were assigned numerous daily chores to perform in the house; they were rarely allowed to socialise outside the household perimeters unless either of their parents were present, and had to follow strict guidelines imposed by their parents, with severe punishment—almost always physical—being the penalty for not conforming to the household rules. The children feared being the recipients of violence from their parents, the vast majority inflicted by Rose, occasionally by Fred. The violence was sometimes irrational, indiscreet or just inflicted for Rose&#x27;s gratification; she always took great care not to mark the children&#x27;s faces or hands in these assaults. Firstly Heather, and subsequently her younger brother Stephen (born 1973), ran away from home; both returned to Cromwell Street after several weeks of alternately sleeping rough or staying with friends, and both were beaten when they returned home. Between 1972 and 1992, the West children were admitted to the Accident and Emergency department of local hospitals 31 times; the injuries were explained as accidents and never reported to social services.

On one occasion, as Stephen was mopping the kitchen floor with a cloth, Rose accidentally stepped into the bowl of water he had been using. In response, Rose hit the boy over the head with the bowl, then repeatedly kicked him in the head and chest as she shouted: &quot;You did that on purpose, you little swine!&quot; On another occasion, Rose became furious about a missing kitchen utensil, then grabbed a knife she had been using to cut a slab of meat, repeatedly inflicting light scour marks to Mae&#x27;s chest until her rib cage was covered with light knife wounds. All the while, Mae screamed, &quot;No, Mum! No, Mum!&quot; as Stephen and Heather stood by, helplessly sobbing.

Even Fred occasionally became the recipient of his wife&#x27;s violence. On one occasion in August 1974, Rose chased after Fred with a carving knife in her hand; Fred was able to slam shut the door of the room into which he had run as Rose lunged at him with the knife, resulting in the knife embedding itself in the door, and three of Rose&#x27;s fingers sliding down the blade, almost severing them from her hand. In response, Rose calmly wrapped her hand in a towel and said: &quot;Look what you done, fella. You&#x27;ve got to take me to the hospital now.&quot;

==Initial sexual assaults==

===Anna Marie West===
In September 1972, the Wests led eight-year-old Anna Marie to the cellar at 25 Cromwell Street, where the child was forced to undress, with Rose tearing her dress from her body upon noting the child&#x27;s hesitation. She was restrained before Fred raped her with Rose&#x27;s active encouragement. After the rape, Rose followed Anna Marie to the bathroom and handed her a sanitary towel, explaining to the child: &quot;I&#x27;m sorry. Everybody does it to every girl. It&#x27;s a father&#x27;s job. Don&#x27;t worry, and don&#x27;t say anything to anybody.&quot; Making clear these sexual assaults would continue, Fred and Rose then threatened the child with severe beatings if they ever received word she had divulged the sexual abuse she endured at their hands.

Rose occasionally sexually abused Anna Marie herself, and later took extreme gratification in degrading her with acts such as binding Anna Marie to various items of furniture before encouraging Fred to rape her, and forcing her to perform household chores while wearing sexual devices and a mini-skirt. From the age of 13, Fred and Rose forced Anna Marie to prostitute herself within the household, with her clients being informed Anna Marie was 16. Rose was always present in the room when these acts occurred, to ensure Anna Marie did not reveal her true age. On one occasion when Anna Marie was aged 13 or 14, Rose took her to a local pub, insisting she drink several glasses of barley wine. Several hours later, Fred arrived at the pub to collect Rose and Anna Marie. Once they had left the premises, Anna Marie was bundled into her father&#x27;s van and beaten by Rose, who asked her: &quot;Do you think you could be my friend?&quot; before she was sexually abused by her father and stepmother.

===Caroline Owens===
In October 1972, the Wests hired 17-year-old Caroline Owens as their children&#x27;s nanny. They had picked her up one night on a secluded country road as she hitchhiked from Tewkesbury to her Cinderford home, having visited her boyfriend. Learning that Owens disliked her stepfather and was looking for a job, the Wests offered her part-time employment as a nanny to the three children then in their household, with a promise she would be driven home each Tuesday. Several days later, Owens moved into 25 Cromwell Street, sharing a room with Anna Marie, who Owens noted was &quot;very withdrawn&quot;.

Rose, who had begun to engage in prostitution by this time, explained to Owens that she worked as a masseuse when the younger woman enquired about the steady stream of men visiting her. According to Owens, Fred also claimed to be skilled in performing abortions, should she ever need such a service. Owens also noted Fred talked about sex almost incessantly; her suspicions as to his sexual overtones were further heightened when Fred boasted that many of the women he claimed to have performed abortions upon were so overjoyed that they would offer him their sexual services as a reward. When Owens herself became the recipient of the Wests&#x27; overt sexual advances, she announced her intentions to leave Cromwell Street and return home.

Knowing Owens&#x27; habits of hitchhiking along the A40 between Cinderford and Tewkesbury, the Wests formulated a plan to abduct her for their shared gratification. Fred later admitted that the specific intent of this abduction was the rape and likely murder of Owens, but that his initial incentive was to determine whether his wife would be willing to at least assist him in an abduction. On 6 December 1972, the couple lured Owens into their vehicle with an apology for their conduct and the offer of a lift home. Initially, Owens believed the Wests had been sincere in their apologies to her and obliged, believing she had simply mistaken their earlier intentions. Rose joined her in the back seat, with the explanation she wanted a &quot;girls&#x27; chat&quot; as Fred drove.

Shortly thereafter, Rose began to fondle her, as Fred questioned whether she had had sex with her boyfriend that evening. When Owens began to protest, Fred stopped the car, referred to Owens as a &quot;bitch&quot;, and punched her into unconsciousness before he and Rose bound and gagged her with a scarf and duct tape. In her subsequent statement to police, Owens stated that, at Cromwell Street, she was given a drugged cup of tea to drink, then again gagged and subjected to a prolonged sexual assault from Fred and Rose. At one stage, Fred remarked that Owens&#x27; clitoris was unusual, then lashed her genitals with a leather belt. When Owens screamed, Rose again smothered her with a pillow and further restrained her about the neck before performing cunnilingus on her. Quickly realising the gravity of her situation, Owens ceased resisting their sexual assaults.

The following morning, having noted Owens&#x27; screaming when one of his children had knocked on the door of the room in which she was restrained, Fred threatened that he and his wife would keep her locked up in the cellar and allow his &quot;black friends&quot; to abuse her, and that when they had finished, he would bury her body beneath &quot;the paving stones of Gloucester&quot;. Fred then claimed he had killed hundreds of young girls, adding that Owens had primarily been brought to the house for &quot;Rose&#x27;s pleasure&quot;. He and Rose then calmly asked Owens whether she would consider returning to work as their nanny. Seeing her escape avenue, Owens agreed, and vacuumed the house to indicate her belief in becoming an extended member of the family. Later that day, Owens escaped from a launderette she and Rose had entered and returned home. Although initially too ashamed to divulge to her mother what had happened, when her mother noted the welts, bruises and exposed subcutaneous tissues on her daughter&#x27;s body, Owens burst into tears and confided what had happened.

Owens&#x27; mother immediately reported her daughter&#x27;s ordeal to the police, and the Wests were arrested and charged with assault, indecent assault, actual bodily harm, and rape. The case was tried at Gloucester Magistrates&#x27; Court on 12 January 1973, but by this date, Owens had decided she could not face the ordeal of testifying in court. All charges pertaining to her sexual abuse were dropped, and the Wests agreed to plead guilty to the reduced charges of indecent assault and causing actual bodily harm; each was fined £50, and the couple were allowed to walk free from court. When Owens heard this news, she attempted suicide.

==Murders==
Three months after the Wests&#x27; assault trial, the couple committed their first known murder. The victim was a 19-year-old named Lynda Gough, with whom Fred and Rose became acquainted through a male lodger in early 1973. Gough regularly visited Cromwell Street, and engaged in affairs with two male lodgers. On 19 April, she moved into their home on Cromwell Street. On or about 20 April, other tenants were told that she had been told to leave the household after she had hit one of their children. This story was later repeated to Gough&#x27;s mother when she contacted the Wests to enquire about her daughter&#x27;s whereabouts.

When Gough&#x27;s dismembered body was found, the jaw was completely wrapped in adhesive and surgical tape to silence her screams, and two small tubes had likely been inserted into her nasal cavities to allow breathing. Long sections of string and sections of knotted fabric were also discovered with her remains. Gough had likely been suspended from holes carved into the wooden beams supporting the ceiling of the cellar Fred later admitted he had devised for the purpose of suspending his victims&#x27; bodies, and likely died of either strangulation or suffocation. Her dismembered body, missing five cervical vertebrae, the patellae and numerous finger bones, was buried in an inspection pit beneath the garage.

From their later investigations, police and forensic experts concluded all the victims found in the cellar at 25 Cromwell Street had been murdered in this location, and that, like Gough, each had been dismembered in this location. Five victims were murdered and buried in the cellar at Cromwell Street between November 1973 and April 1975. The first of these victims, 15-year-old Carol Ann Cooper, was abducted on 10 November 1973. Cooper lived in the Pines Children&#x27;s Home in Worcester, and was abducted after spending the evening at a cinema with her boyfriend. She had been waiting for a bus in Warndon when she vanished, and was likely dragged into Fred&#x27;s car, where her face was bound with surgical tape and her arms bound with braiding cloth before she was driven to Cromwell Street. At the Wests&#x27; address, Cooper was suspended from the wooden beams of the cellar ceiling before her abuse and murder. As had been the case with Lynda, Cooper died from strangulation or asphyxiation, before her body was dismembered and buried in a shallow, cubic grave in the cellar.

Over the following 17 months, four further victims between the ages of 15 and 21 suffered a similar fate to that endured by Gough and Cooper, although the disarticulation conducted upon each successive victim, plus the paraphernalia discovered in each shallow grave, suggests each victim was likely subjected to greater abuse and torture than those previously murdered.

Following the murder of 18-year-old Juanita Mott in April 1975, Fred concreted over the floor of the entire cellar. He later converted this section of the household into a bedroom for his oldest children, and he and his wife are not known to have committed any further murders until May 1978, when Fred—either with or without Rose&#x27;s participation but certainly with her knowledge—murdered an 18-year-old lodger named Shirley Robinson. Robinson had first met Fred at The Green Lantern café in April 1977, and had taken lodgings with the Wests the same month. She was heavily pregnant at the time of her murder. Although Rose—herself pregnant at the time—initially boasted to neighbours the child Robinson was carrying was her husband&#x27;s, she soon developed a deep resentment of Robinson, and the motive for her murder is likely to have been the removal of a threat to the stability of the Wests&#x27; relationship. Her body was buried in the garden of 25 Cromwell Street. It was extensively dismembered, but no restraining devices were found with these remains, making a sexual motive for this murder unlikely. The unborn baby had been removed and had several bones missing. Shortly thereafter, Rose unsuccessfully submitted a claim for maternity benefit in Robinson&#x27;s name with Gloucester social services. As had earlier been the case with Charmaine and Lynda, Fred and Rose allayed the suspicions of anyone who asked about Robinson&#x27;s whereabouts by claiming she had relocated to live with her father in West Germany.

The final murder Fred and Rose are known to have committed with a definite sexual motive occurred on 5 August 1979. The victim was a 16-year-old named Alison Chambers, who had run away from a local children&#x27;s home to become the Wests&#x27; live-in nanny in the middle of 1979. Chambers is believed to have lived within their household for several weeks before her murder, and Rose promised Chambers she could live at a rural &quot;peaceful farm&quot; she claimed she and her husband owned. Her body was also buried in the garden of Cromwell Street, close to the bathroom wall, and although Chambers was likely dismembered, her skeleton was not marked by striations as the earlier victims&#x27; bodies had been. In an effort to allay any concerns from Chambers&#x27; family (with whom she maintained regular correspondence), Fred and Rose later posted a letter, written by Chambers to her mother prior to her murder, from a Northamptonshire post box.

===Abuse===

Heather and Mae West became the focus of Fred&#x27;s incestuous sexual attentions after Anna Marie ran away from home in 1979 after enduring a particularly severe beating from Rose to her stomach just days after being discharged from hospital for treatment of an ectopic pregnancy. The frequency of the abuse endured by Heather and Mae increased when both girls reached puberty. Fred was overt and unapologetic in his conduct, and would justify his actions with the simple explanation: &quot;I made you; I can do what I like with you.&quot; He further referred to his intentions to impregnate both his daughters on at least one occasion, and would occasionally force all his children to watch pornography with him. As Heather, Mae and their younger brother Stephen were very close in age, the trio resolved that if their father asked either of the two girls to be alone in a room with him, they would only do so if at least one other member of the trio were present to avoid either girl being raped. Both girls also developed a regime whereby they would only shower or undress when their father was either out of the house, or as her sister stood guard at the door. Stephen was also informed by his father that he would have to have sex with his mother by the age of 17 (in the event, his parents evicted him from their home when he was 16).

Although the girls were repulsed by their father&#x27;s behaviour, Mae—having once endured Fred&#x27;s throwing a vacuum cleaner at her when she remonstrated against his fondling her—developed a mechanism whereby she would tolerate Fred&#x27;s sexually fondling her, then jokingly brush aside any efforts he made to take the molestation further, whereas in her autobiography, Mae recollected that Heather &quot;was affected quite badly by all of this. Even more than me.&quot; A strong suspicion remains that, by 1985 or 1986, Heather had been forced to engage in intercourse with her father, as by the mid-1980s, she developed classic symptoms of the distress felt by victims of child abuse: these included habits of her biting her nails until they bled; drinking alcohol; of warily watching her father through the corner of her eye wherever she was sitting or standing; expressing nervous fragility whenever in the presence of males; her sleep being repeatedly broken by nightmares; and her repeatedly bouncing back and forth as she sat on any chair. This distressful behaviour led to Fred and Rose suspecting Heather had lesbian inclinations, and also resulted in her becoming the increasing recipient of taunts from her father (who had never particularly liked Heather) that she was &quot;ugly&quot; and a &quot;bitch&quot;. On the occasions Heather remonstrated about the abuse to her mother, Rose would simply laugh at her distress.

Heather also expressed to Mae and Stephen her desire to run away from home and live a nomadic lifestyle in the Forest of Dean, and to never again see any human beings.

==Murder of Heather West==
Heather did complain to friends about the abuse she and her siblings endured, and her external signs of psychological distress were noted by several of them. Staff at the Hucclecote Secondary School, which Heather and her siblings attended, are also known to have expressed concern as to why Heather—a studious and obedient pupil—refused to obey orders either to change her clothing for, or shower after, sporting activities. On one occasion, she was forced to take a shower, resulting in her peers and staff noting her arms, legs and torso were covered in welts and bruises in various stages of healing. Heather attempted to excuse these injuries as having been obtained in fights with her siblings, but confided in one close friend that they had been inflicted by her parents, adding that her mother considered her a &quot;little bitch&quot; who deserved her beatings.

By the mid-1980s, rumours of Rose&#x27;s sex life had reached several of the children&#x27;s classmates, and although the West children had been instructed never to divulge details of their home lives to their peers, Heather confided to her friends that many of these rumours were true. The father of one of these classmates was a friend of the Wests; as such, word soon reached Fred and Rose that Heather had divulged details of her home life—including details of her mother&#x27;s promiscuity—to her classmates. Fred was so concerned by these revelations that he began to escort Heather to and from school.

After Heather left school in the summer of 1986, she applied for numerous jobs in an effort to leave Cromwell Street. By June of the following year, she had pinned her hopes on escaping the household via obtaining a job as a chalet cleaner at a holiday camp in the seaside town of Torquay; she received notification that this application had been unsuccessful on 18 June 1987. In response, she crumpled into tears before her siblings Mae and Stephen. That same evening, her whole family heard Heather sobbing aloud as she attempted to sleep, and according to Mae, she &quot;cried all the way through the night.&quot; The following morning, on 19 June, Heather was &quot;back to her usual self, looking miserable, biting her nails and sitting on the couch bouncing back and forth as she sat&quot; as her siblings left the house to go to school.

When Heather&#x27;s siblings returned home, they were informed Heather had left to accept the job she had previously been refused in Torquay (a story the Wests also relayed to other family members); however, Rose told an enquiring neighbour that she and Heather had had a &quot;hell of a row&quot;, and that Heather had run away from home. Later, to answer their children&#x27;s questions about why Heather failed to contact or visit her siblings, the parents claimed that Heather had eloped with a lesbian lover. When Mae and Stephen suggested they report Heather&#x27;s disappearance to police, Fred changed his story yet again, saying it would be unwise to initiate a search for Heather as she was involved in credit card fraud. On more than one occasion, Fred and Rose persuaded an unknown acquaintance to fake a phone call from Heather to her parents.

In the years following Heather&#x27;s disappearance, Fred occasionally jokingly threatened the children that they would &quot;end up under the patio like Heather&quot; if they either misbehaved or divulged the mistreatment they endured to anyone outside the household. With Rose&#x27;s approval, he later constructed a barbecue pit immediately opposite where Heather had been buried, and placed a pine table on her grave for the children of the family to sit upon whenever the Wests held family gatherings in their garden.

Heather&#x27;s disappearance, Fred and Rose&#x27;s constantly changing stories about their daughter&#x27;s whereabouts, plus their allusions to foul play, ultimately led to police enquiries as to Heather&#x27;s whereabouts. These enquiries culminated in a search warrant being issued to excavate the Wests&#x27; garden in February 1994.

==Arrest==
In May 1992, Fred asked his 13-year-old daughter, Louise, to bring some bottles to a room on the first floor of their home. Rose was not present in the home at the time. Shortly thereafter, the girl&#x27;s siblings heard her scream, &quot;No, don&#x27;t!&quot; Later, Fred returned downstairs. Louise was found by her siblings writhing in pain, sobbing that her father had raped and sodomised her, at one stage partially strangling her. When Rose returned home, Louise confided in her mother that she had been raped by Fred; Rose replied, &quot;Oh well. You were asking for it.&quot; Over the following weeks, Louise was raped on three further occasions, with Rose personally witnessing one of these rapes before following her distressed and bleeding daughter into the bathroom and asking the child, &quot;Well, what did you expect?&quot; Fred also filmed one of these rapes. Several weeks later, Louise garnered the courage to confide in a close friend what her father had done; this friend told her own mother what had happened on 4 August. In response, the friend&#x27;s mother anonymously informed the police.

On 6 August 1992, the police searched the West household on the pretext of searching for stolen property. Although numerous objects of sexual paraphernalia—including 99 pornographic videos of both home-made and commercial nature—were discovered, police did not find the video depicting the rape of Fred&#x27;s daughter. The 13-year-old made a full statement through a specially-trained solicitor, describing her father&#x27;s actions, the fact the sexual abuse had begun when she was 11, and that her mother had been casually indifferent to her plight. All the children in the household were placed in foster care the following day. Medical examinations revealed evidence of physical and sexual abuse.

The West children also divulged their mother had inflicted most of the physical abuse and that their father frequently said that if they told anyone about the goings-on in the household they would be &quot;buried under the patio&quot; like their sister Heather.

===Investigation===
Police began a full-scale investigation, eventually leading to Fred being charged with three counts of rape, and one of buggery, with Rose as an accomplice. She was also charged with child cruelty, inciting her husband to engage in sex with their daughter, and obstructing the police. The Wests were questioned as to the whereabouts of their eldest daughter, and although Fred claimed Heather was &quot;alive and well&quot; and supporting herself via prostitution, Rose initially claimed to have no knowledge of Heather&#x27;s whereabouts, or why she had left home. She claimed on 11 August that she could &quot;remember now&quot; that her daughter had left home at her own persuasion due to Rose&#x27;s concerns her other children may discover Heather&#x27;s supposed lesbian inclinations. Rose then added she had also given her daughter £600 to incentivise her to leave the household, before further claiming to have maintained sporadic telephone contact with her daughter over the years. The following day, Rose was granted bail on the condition she did not maintain contact with her children, her stepdaughter, or her husband prior to her upcoming trial.

As Fred awaited trial, he was held on remand in Birmingham. Learning that her father had denied any wrongdoing, Anna Marie also contacted police to offer a full statement detailing her experiences as a child. In a statement given to Detective Constable Hazel Savage, Anna Marie recounted the extensive physical, mental and sexual abuse she had endured as a child at the hands of her father and stepmother, before agreeing to testify against both parents at their upcoming trial. Anna Marie also added she had, for several years, been unsuccessfully attempting to trace her mother Rena and half-sisters Charmaine and Heather. Further enquiries conducted with Anna Marie&#x27;s husband, Chris Davis, revealed that Heather had confided in him just how unhappy she was shortly before her disappearance, and of her desire to leave home. Davis elaborated that although Heather had not divulged any details about her enduring any sexual abuse, he had been so concerned for her welfare he had offered to confront her parents, and Heather had dissuaded him from doing so, blurting: &quot;For Christ&#x27;s sake don&#x27;t, because they&#x27;ll kill us both!&quot; Davis then suggested they might wish to speak with Heather to garner further details of her abuse.

In their efforts to gather further evidence, police and social services also spoke with Mae, who, having spoken with her 13-year-old sister and learned Louise did not wish to see her father charged, initially denied she had endured any molestation as an adolescent. Police then focused their attentions on tracing Heather in efforts to corroborate Anna Marie&#x27;s claims of sexual abuse, but enquiries to the Inland Revenue and the Social Security department held no records attesting to her being alive. Two months later, Gloucester social services also contacted police to stress their concern over the whereabouts of Heather.

This case against the Wests collapsed when Anna Marie and her 13-year-old half-sister Louise declined to testify at the court case on 7 June 1993, with the child rape victim expressing her desire to return to her family, and Anna Marie choosing to withdraw her statement because of her noting the misery of her younger siblings, and her fear of Rose&#x27;s vindictiveness. Shortly thereafter, Anna Marie spoke further with DC Savage, further emphasising that her mother Rena and half-sister Charmaine were also missing.

===Search warrant===
Although the Wests were acquitted of all charges, all their younger children remained in foster care, albeit with permitted supervised visitations to Cromwell Street. Despite the Wests claiming to the few relatives from whom they were not already estranged by 1993 that the charges had been fabricated by police, almost all of their remaining family members severed contact with them. Meanwhile, police continued investigating the disappearance of Heather, noting no records existed indicating she was still alive. When Anna Marie was questioned as to the colloquial &quot;family joke&quot; regarding Heather being buried beneath the patio, she confirmed that the sole time she had heard her father recite this claim, he had immediately burst into laughter, leading to her refusing to take this claim seriously.

In retracing Fred&#x27;s history, police also discovered that although Rena and Charmaine had disappeared in 1971, no missing person report had ever been filed on either of them. DC Savage and her colleagues were convinced Heather was dead, and that Fred&#x27;s repeated statement to his children that her body lay beneath the family patio might be true. On 23 February 1994, Gloucester police successfully applied for a search warrant authorising the search of 25 Cromwell Street to locate Heather&#x27;s remains.

When police visited the address on 24 February and showed the warrant to Rose, she turned pale, before becoming hysterical and shouting over her shoulder to her eldest son, Stephen, &quot;Get Fred!&quot; Rose became contradictory in her informal questioning as to the circumstances surrounding Heather&#x27;s disappearance. When reminded of these contradictions, she became distraught and abusive, shouting at the officers: &quot;I can&#x27;t fucking remember! It&#x27;s a bloody long time ago! What do you think I am? A bloody computer?&quot;

Fred had been working in Stroud at the time; upon hearing of the police&#x27;s intentions, he assured Stephen he would be home immediately. When Fred arrived three hours later, he informed his family of his intention to voluntarily offer a witness statement to police regarding his daughter&#x27;s whereabouts. Despite Fred&#x27;s insistence in this statement that Heather had been &quot;alive and well&quot;, albeit involved in a drugs cartel, and that the claims he and his wife had made as to Heather being buried beneath the family patio were simply &quot;rubbish&quot;, police were unassuaged. In response, Fred abruptly changed tactics, claiming they simply held a grudge against him due to his 1993 acquittal of the rape of his daughter.

That evening, with the search team having left their premises and a uniformed officer remaining at Cromwell Street to guard the excavation site, Mae and Stephen observed their parents talking in hushed tones as they repeatedly glanced towards the garden from their kitchen window.

In the early hours of the following morning, as his son Stephen was about to leave for work, Fred informed him: &quot;Look son, look after mum and sell the house [...] I&#x27;ve done something really bad. I want you to go to the papers and make as much money as you can.&quot; Shortly thereafter, police returned to Cromwell Street to continue their search for Heather&#x27;s body. Upon their arrival, Fred indicated his wish to be arrested for Heather&#x27;s murder and to be taken to Bearland police station to provide a full confession; he was then arrested and formally cautioned.

==Discoveries==
At 11:15 that morning, Fred formally admitted to police he had indeed killed his daughter, albeit in an act of manslaughter. He confessed to strangling Heather in a fit of rage, then dismembering her body in the ground floor bathroom with a heavy serrated knife he normally used for cutting slabs of frozen meat. Her remains had been stored in a dustbin as he waited for an opportunity to dig her grave. Fred was insistent his wife had no knowledge of her daughter&#x27;s murder, claiming he had committed this murder as Rose was preoccupied with one of her clients, adding the fact the search team had not yet unearthed Heather&#x27;s remains was because they had been excavating the wrong section of his garden. He then volunteered to accompany police to the house to pinpoint the precise location of Heather&#x27;s body. Upon receipt of this confession, Fred&#x27;s solicitor, Howard Ogden, and Janet Leach, his appointed appropriate adult, informed Mae and Stephen their father had confessed to their sister&#x27;s murder. In response, Stephen slumped against a wall and began sobbing; Mae entered a state of shock, before stammering that her father had not killed her sister.

The following day (26 February), police began excavating the section of the garden at Cromwell Street where Fred indicated he had buried his daughter&#x27;s body. Shortly after 4 p.m., police found a human thigh bone protruding from a section of the garden Fred had insisted police need not look in. Excavating the section of the garden where Fred had indicated he had buried his daughter&#x27;s body, investigators discovered a mass of jumbled human remains encased in the remnants of a bin bag and intertwined with two lengths of rope. These dismembered remains were taken to the police headquarters for further examination, where they were determined to be those of a young woman, with one kneecap and several phalanges missing. The decedent&#x27;s fingernails were discovered in a pile, suggesting they may have been torn from her fingers as a means of torture. Several hours later, the body was identified via dental records as being that of Heather West.

That evening, having been formally charged with his daughter&#x27;s murder and questioned as to why police had also discovered a third thigh bone, Fred confessed there were two further sets of human remains in his garden, and agreed to return to Cromwell Street to reveal the locations of both graves; one of whom he named as Shirley Robinson, whom he described as being a former tenant and a lesbian who had been heavily pregnant with his child at the time of her 1978 murder; the other victim he described (incorrectly) as being &quot;Shirley&#x27;s mate&quot;, but either could not or would not elaborate as to her identity. Both sets of remains were discovered on 28 February, and Fred was charged with both murders two days later.

Having discovered three sets of human remains in the garden, a decision was made to thoroughly search the entire property. Rose was placed into a safe house in the nearby town of Dursley as police commenced their search inside 25 Cromwell Street. Informed of this fact, and with the formal interviews conducted by the investigative team lasting up to 16 hours each day and including persistent questioning as to the whereabouts of his first wife Rena and stepdaughter Charmaine, Fred authorised his solicitor to pass a note he had written to the leader of the murder investigation: Superintendent John Bennett of the Gloucestershire Police. This note—dated 4 March—read: &quot;I, Frederick West, authorise my solicitor, Howard Ogden, to advise Superintendent Bennett that I wish to admit a further (approx) nine killings, expressly Charmaine, Rena, Lynda Gough and others to be identified. F. West.&quot;

Questioned further as to his claims, Fred calmly explained there were a further five bodies buried in his cellar, and a sixth body beneath the ground-floor bathroom. Most of these victims, Fred claimed, had been hitchhikers or girls he had murdered in the 1970s after picking them up at bus stops. Initially, Fred claimed these six victims had been killed when they had threatened to inform Rose of his infidelity with women, and that he had transported their bodies to Cromwell Street to abuse, dismember, and then bury in shallow graves. The dismemberment, Fred claimed, had made it easier to bury the remains in shallow, cubical graves, and he agreed to return to Cromwell Street to indicate precisely where he had buried each victim.

Between 5 and 8 March, police found six further bodies of young females at 25 Cromwell Street. Each victim had been extensively mutilated, and each body bore evidence of having been subjected to extreme sexual abuse prior to the act of murder. For example, the third set of remains discovered in the cellar was found with a length of cloth wrapped around the skull, and an oval of adhesive tape in circumference found with the remains had likely been used to gag this victim, whose ankles and wrists were also bound with a large section of rope. Also found in this grave was a large, serrated knife. The second set of remains was found with a section of tubing twisted into a U-shape alongside her severed limbs, and her skull was found encased in adhesive tape which had been wrapped around the section where her face had been 11 or 12 times, with a narrow plastic tube inserted where the nasal cavities had been in an effort to allow her to breathe prior to her murder. Each set of remains was missing numerous bones, particularly phalanges; when questioned, Fred refused to divulge the whereabouts of the bones missing from each set of remains, or the reason for their absence.

===Arrest of Rose West===
Despite Fred&#x27;s insistence that his wife held no knowledge of any of the murders, investigators suspected otherwise. Rose was arrested on 20 April 1994, initially on offences relating to the rape of an 11-year-old girl, and the physical assault of an eight-year-old boy—both charges dating from the mid-1970s. The following day, she was refused bail, and transferred to Pucklechurch Prison to be held in the maximum security wing. Here, she was questioned more closely about the murders, in particular those of her daughter Heather and Lynda Gough, and on 25 April she was formally charged with Gough&#x27;s murder.

By 6 May, Fred and Rose were jointly charged with five counts of murder, with Rose simply replying, &quot;I&#x27;m innocent&quot; upon hearing each formal charge—a response that proved to be a theme throughout each of the 46 interviews investigators held with Rose prior to her trial.

As well as the murders of the victims exhumed from Cromwell Street, Fred had confessed to the murders of his first wife and stepdaughter, and to knowing the location of Anne McFall&#x27;s remains (although he always denied killing her). Fred agreed to identify each burial location, and the remains were unearthed between 10 April and 7 June. He was then transferred to Birmingham&#x27;s HM Prison Birmingham, where a strict suicide watch called for his cell to be checked every 15 minutes.

==Formal charges==
Fred and Rose West were brought before a magistrates&#x27; court in Gloucester on 30 June 1994; he was charged with 12 murders and she with nine. This was the first time the couple had seen each other since Fred&#x27;s February arrest. Prior to hearing the formal charges against them, Fred leaned toward his wife and gently placed his hand upon her shoulder; in response, Rose—having ignored her husband&#x27;s presence—visibly winced in discomfort. Both were ordered held on remand.

As police attempted to lead Fred from the hearing, he resisted their efforts, and again attempted to move towards Rose, who again winced and attempted to writhe away from his grasp.

Immediately after this court appearance, Fred was re-arrested on suspicion of murdering Anne McFall, whose body had been found on 7 June but had not been officially identified until this date; he was formally charged with McFall&#x27;s murder on 3 July, appearing in court the following morning.

===Diversion of culpability===
As he was held on remand at HM Prison Birmingham in the months following his arrest, Fred became increasingly depressed. This became worse after Rose&#x27;s public rejection of him at Gloucester Magistrates&#x27; Court on 30 June, her refusal to reply to letters he sent her, and reports leaked to the press in which she (Rose) had assumed the role of a grieving mother who had lost a daughter and stepdaughter to her husband and in which she declared both her innocence of murder, and her hatred of him.

Fred pleaded with Stephen and Anna Marie (the only children to visit their father while on remand) to convey to Rose that he loved her, but Rose never acknowledged these overtures. In response, Fred withdrew his earlier confessions to having acted alone in the murders, and instead accused his wife of almost total culpability in all the murders to which he had been charged, excluding that of Anne McFall, which he claimed had been committed by his first wife.

==Death==
The initially strict suicide watch having been relaxed, on 1 January 1995 Fred West asphyxiated himself in his cell by wrapping an improvised rope he had constructed from a blanket and tags he had stolen from prison laundry bags around his neck, then binding this device to a door handle and window catchment, and sinking to his knees.

At the bottom of the suicide note found in his cell was a drawing of a gravestone, within which was written: &quot;In loving memory. Fred West. Rose West. Rest in peace where no shadow falls. In perfect peace he waits for Rose, his wife.&quot;

==Trial of Rose West==
At pretrial proceedings in February, Rose pleaded not guilty to ten charges of murder (the murder of Charmaine West having been added to the original nine after Fred&#x27;s suicide, and two counts of rape and indecent assault of young girls having been dropped with a view for later resubmission), though her counsel conceded that circumstantial evidence indicated Rose&#x27;s willingness to subject young girls to sadistic physical and sexual abuse.
Her trial at Winchester Crown Court began on 3 October 1995. She was tried before Mr Justice Mantell.

An important early decision by the judge was to admit testimony related to the sexual mistreatment of three women by Fred and Rose, accepting the prosecution&#x27;s argument that it established a pattern of behaviour repeated in the murders.

===Prosecution===
In his opening statement, prosecutor Brian Leveson portrayed the Wests as sex-obsessed sadistic murderers, terming the bodies discovered at Cromwell Street and Midland Road &quot;secrets more terrible than words can express... [The victims&#x27;] last moments on Earth were as objects of the depravity of this woman and her husband&quot;.
He pointed out that Fred was incarcerated when Charmaine West was killed; claimed that the Wests had each learned from their mistake in allowing Caroline Owens to live (they &quot;would never be so trusting again&quot;); and said that the gag on victim Thérèse Siegenthaler had a &quot;feminine&quot; toucha scarf tied in a bow. He promised to demonstrate Rose&#x27;s controlling and sexually sadistic character and her efforts to deflect suspicion about the disappearance of their victims.

Prosecution witnesses included Cromwell Street lodgers; victims&#x27; relatives; Rose&#x27;s mother Daisy and sister Glenys; and surviving victims including Anna Marie West, Kathryn Halliday (a former lover of the Wests), Caroline Owens, and a &quot;Miss A&quot; (who had been sexually assaulted at 14 by Fred and Rose in 1977, and who described Rose as the more aggressive perpetrator of the two). Neighbours described Charmaine&#x27;s 1971 disappearance while Fred was imprisoned, and Rose&#x27;s casual indifference to Heather&#x27;s disappearance.

Rosemary&#x27;s counsel, Richard Ferguson, tried to discredit prosecution witnesses as either having financially exploited their connection to the case, or motivated by grudges. Owens, though admitting to receiving £20,000 for her story, described her extreme survivor&#x27;s guilt: &quot;I only want to get justice for the girls who didn&#x27;t make it. I feel like it was my fault.&quot;

===Defence testimony===
Ferguson emphasised that Fred, before meeting Rose, had committed at least one murder strikingly similar to those at issue in the present trial, and that the prosecution&#x27;s case was largely circumstantial. He contended that Rose was unaware of the extent of Fred&#x27;s sadism, and urged the jury to not be prejudiced by her promiscuity and domineering manner.

Against the advice of her counsel, Rose herself testified; her manner sometimes morose and tearful, sometimes upbeat and humorous. She wept while describing herself as a victim of child abuse and rape who naively married a violent and domineering man, but joked about issues such as her &quot;always being pregnant&quot;, and laughed while describing one victim&#x27;s &quot;grandfather glasses&quot;. She also claimed never to have met six of the victims buried at Cromwell Street, and to recall very little of her assault on Caroline Owens. When shown photographs of the victims buried in the cellar and victim Alison Chambers and asked by Brian Leveson whether she recognised any of their faces, Rose&#x27;s face turned bright red, and she repeatedly stuttered as she replied, &quot;No, sir.&quot;

When questioned as to life at Cromwell Street, Rose claimed she and Fred had lived separate lives, which was inconsistent with the earlier testimony of witnesses who had visited or lodged at their address. In reference to her relationship with her eldest child, Rose admitted her relations with Heather were strained, before claiming to the court that her daughter was a lesbian who had physically and psychologically abused her siblings. Despite these allegations, Rose stated she had loved her daughter, and held no knowledge of her murder. Further questioned as to the contradictory explanations she and her husband had given as to Heather&#x27;s disappearance, Rose claimed these discrepancies had stemmed from telephone conversations she had had with Heather after she had left home.

The defence next called a succession of women who claimed to have been attacked or assaulted by a lone male whose physical description matched that of Fred West between 1966 and 1975. These seven women each testified they had recognised their attacker as Fred West when his photograph appeared in the media in 1994. The intention of this testimony was to illustrate to the jury that Fred was capable of abducting, assaulting or attempting to attack women without Rose, which the prosecution had never disputed. The physical recollections of several of these women varied greatly.

The final witness to testify at Rose&#x27;s trial was Fred&#x27;s appointed appropriate adult, Janet Leach, whom the prosecution had called to testify on 7 November in rebuttal to the tape recordings of Fred&#x27;s confession which had been played to the court on 3 November and in which he had stressed Rose had &quot;known nothing at all&quot; about any of the murders. Leach testified that through this role, Fred had gradually begun to view her as a confidante, and had confided in her that on the evening prior to his 25 February arrest, he and Rose had formed a pact whereby he would take full responsibility for all the murders, many of which he had privately described to her as being &quot;some of Rose&#x27;s mistakes&quot;. He had further divulged that Rose had indeed murdered Charmaine while he had been incarcerated, and had also murdered Shirley Robinson. Fred had also confided that he had dismembered the victims, and Rose had participated in the mutilation and dismemberment of Shirley Robinson, having personally removed Robinson&#x27;s unborn child from her womb after her death. In reference to the remaining eight murders for which Rose was charged, Leach testified that Fred had confided Rose had &quot;played a major part&quot; in these murders.

Upon cross examination, Leach did concede to Richard Ferguson she had earlier lied under oath about having sold her story to a national newspaper for £100,000, although she was adamant as to the sincerity of her testimony. While delivering this testimony, Leach collapsed, and the trial was adjourned for six days. She returned to complete her cross examination on 13 November.

===Conviction===
After seven weeks of evidence the judge instructed the jury, emphasising that circumstantial evidence can be sufficient for a finding of guilt, and that if two people take part in a murder, the law considers them equally guilty regardless of which of them did the deed.
On 21 and 22 November, the jury returned unanimous guilty verdicts for all ten murders. Terming her crimes &quot;appalling and depraved&quot;, Mr Justice Mantell sentenced Rosemary to life in prison, emphasising that she should never be paroled.
Initially, Rose was incarcerated at HMP Bronzefield as a Category A prisoner; she was later transferred to HM Prison Low Newton before, in 2019, being transferred to HM Prison New Hall, where she continues to protest her innocence.

==Victims==
Fred and Rose West are known to have committed at least 12 murders between 1967 and 1987; many investigators, authors, and journalists who have studied the case believe there are other victims whose bodies have never been found. Prior to his suicide, police had recorded over 108 hours of tape-recorded interviews with Fred, both when he had claimed to have acted alone in the commission of the murders, and when he had attempted to portray Rose as being the more culpable participant. On several occasions, Fred made cryptic hints he had murdered several other girls, but refused to divulge any further information beyond that he had murdered 15-year-old Mary Bastholm in 1968 and buried the body on farmland near Bishop&#x27;s Cleeve. He also claimed to have killed one victim while working on a construction project in Birmingham, and that other bodies had been buried in Scotland and Herefordshire.

To his appropriate adult, Fred claimed there were up to 20 further victims he and his wife had killed, &quot;not in one place but spread around&quot;, and that he intended to reveal the location of one body per year to investigators.

While on remand, Fred made several admissions as to the fate of the victims buried at Cromwell Street to his son Stephen. Much of this information was disjointed or told in a third party manner; Fred claimed that he had extensively tortured the victims prior to their murder, but had not raped them, instead engaging in acts of necrophilia with their bodies at or shortly after the point of death. He also claimed the reason many phalange bones had been missing from the victims&#x27; bodies was because the removal of their fingers and toes had been one of the forms of torture the victims had endured, with other torture methods including the extraction of their nails, acts of mutilation, and cigarettes being stubbed out on their bodies. Furthermore, the locations of almost all the burial sites of victims—both discovered and undiscovered—was symbolic to Fred, as each had been buried at or very close to the location he had lived in or worked at the time of the victim&#x27;s murder.

===1967===
* July: Anne McFall, (18). McFall&#x27;s remains were found on 7 June 1994 in Fingerpost Field, Much Marcle. Her body had been placed in a rectangular pit and covered with loose topsoil. She had been pregnant with a daughter, and her pregnancy had been in its eighth month.

===1968===
* 6 January: Mary Bastholm, (15). A teenage waitress at a café Fred frequented. Bastholm was abducted from a bus stop on Bristol Road, Gloucester. Fred confessed to police he had killed Bastholm after raping her in his car. She is believed to have been buried in Bishop&#x27;s Cleeve. Police were unable to charge Fred with this crime as they had no evidence. Her body has never been found.

===1971===
* c. 20 June: Charmaine West, (8). Fred&#x27;s stepdaughter. Charmaine was killed by Rose shortly before Fred&#x27;s release from Leyhill Prison on 24 June, likely in a fit of domestic violence. Her remains were initially stored in the cellar at Midland Road before Fred buried the child&#x27;s body in the rear garden of the flat.
* August: Catherine &quot;Rena&quot; Costello, (27). Rena is believed to have travelled to the Wests at 25 Midland Road to either enquire about or obtain custody of her two daughters in mid- to late-August 1971. It is believed Fred killed Rena to avoid any investigation into Charmaine&#x27;s whereabouts. She is believed to have been strangled to death by Fred before her extensively mutilated body was buried in Letterbox Field.

===1973===
* c. 20 April: Lynda Gough, (19). The first sexually motivated killing the Wests are known to have committed together. Gough was a lodger at 25 Cromwell Street, and shared sex partners with Rose. Following her disappearance, Gough&#x27;s mother travelled to Cromwell Street to enquire as to her daughter&#x27;s whereabouts, and saw Rose wearing her daughter&#x27;s clothes and slippers. She was informed that Lynda had moved to find work in Weston-super-Mare. Lynda Gough&#x27;s remains were buried in an inspection pit beneath the garage, which was later converted into a bathroom.
* 10 November: Carol Ann Cooper, (15). Cooper had been placed into care following her mother&#x27;s death in 1966. She was last seen alive by her boyfriend in the suburb of Warndon boarding a bus to her grandmother&#x27;s home. Fred referred to Cooper as &quot;Scar Hand&quot; in reference to a recent firework burn she had sustained. Cooper was the final victim unearthed from the cellar. Her skull was bound with surgical tape and her dismembered limbs bound with cord and braiding cloth.
* 27 December: Lucy Partington, (21). Partington was an Exeter University student and the cousin of novelist Martin Amis. She was abducted from a bus stop along the A435. Her precise date of death may have been one week after her disappearance, as Fred admitted himself into the casualty unit of the Gloucester Royal Hospital with a serious laceration of his right hand on 3 January, possibly sustained as he dismembered Partington&#x27;s body. Her body was discovered in the Cromwell Street cellar on 6 March 1994.

===1974===
* 16 April: Thérèse Siegenthaler, (21). A sociology student at Greenwich Community College. Siegenthaler was abducted by the Wests as she hitchhiked from South London to Holyhead. Fred mistook her Swiss accent to be a Dutch one, and always referred to her as either &quot;the Dutch girl&quot; or &quot;Tulip&quot;. She was reported missing to Scotland Yard by her family in Switzerland when communication from their daughter ceased. Fred later further concealed Siegenthaler&#x27;s remains by building a false chimney breast on her grave.
* 15 November: Shirley Hubbard, (15). A foster child abducted from a Droitwich bus stop close to the River Severn as she travelled home from a date. Aged 15 when murdered, Hubbard had been attending work experience in Worcester, and was last seen by her boyfriend, having promised to meet him the next day. Hubbard&#x27;s dismembered remains were found in a section of the cellar known to the family as the &quot;Marilyn Monroe area&quot;. Her head had been completely covered in tape, with a diameter rubber tube inserted into her nasal cavity to enable her to breathe.

===1975===
* 12 April: Juanita Mott, (18). Mott had been a former lodger at 25 Cromwell Street, but was living with a family friend in Newent when she disappeared. Mott is believed to have been abducted by the Wests as she hitchhiked along the B4215. In his subsequent confessions to police, Fred would refer to Mott as &quot;the girl from Newent&quot;.

===1978===
* 10 May: Shirley Robinson, (18). Another former lodger at 25 Cromwell Street, Robinson was bisexual and engaged in casual sex with Fred and Rose. At the time of her disappearance, she had been eight months pregnant with Fred&#x27;s child, and her baby boy had been due to be born on 11 June. No sexual motive existed for this murder, and the prosecution contended at Rose&#x27;s trial that Robinson had been murdered as her pregnancy threatened the stability of the Wests&#x27; relationship. Fred had originally planned to sell their baby to a childless couple and had professional photographs taken with Robinson for this purpose.

===1979===
* 5 August: Alison Chambers, (16). Chambers had been placed into foster care at the age of 14, and had repeatedly absconded from Jordan&#x27;s Brook House. She became acquainted with the Wests in mid-1979, and Fred later claimed to his solicitor that Chambers had died as a result of Rose becoming &quot;too bloody vicious&quot; with her. Her dismembered body, missing several bones and with a leather belt looped beneath her jaw and tied at the top of her head, was buried in the garden of Cromwell Street. This was the final murder where a definite sexual motive was established.

===1987===
* 19 June: Heather West, (16). Heather was likely to have been murdered because Fred and Rose considered her efforts to leave the household as a threat, as she divulged to her classmates the extensive physical and sexual abuse which occurred at Cromwell Street. Fred claimed he had not intended to kill his daughter, but carpet fibres found on two lengths of rope, discovered with her remains, suggested that she had been restrained and subjected to a sexual assault prior to her murder. Her body was dismembered with a heavy serrated knife and later buried in a hole in the garden which Fred had his son dig, under the pretence of installing a fish pond. The 1994 police investigation into Heather&#x27;s disappearance led to the discovery of her body, and the arrest of both her parents.

Footnotes
* As well as the 12 confirmed victims, police firmly believe Fred is also responsible for the 1968 disappearance of 15-year-old Mary Bastholm, but to date no body has been found. West&#x27;s son, Stephen, has said he firmly believes the missing teenager was an early victim of his father, as Fred had openly boasted of having committed Bastholm&#x27;s murder while on remand.
* In May 2021, police announced their intentions to excavate the grounds of a café in Gloucester after receiving information that the body of Mary Bastholm may have been buried at this location. This search yielded no human remains. At the time of her disappearance, Bastholm worked at this café and Fred is known to have frequented the premises. Furthermore, he is known to have conducted repair work on the drains of this café in late 1967.
* No forensic evidence linked Fred to the murder of Anne McFall, and he always denied killing her. However, her body had been extensively dismembered, and was missing several phalanges. Furthermore, the cubic dimensions of the grave in which her body was buried match the &quot;modus operandi&quot; of Fred&#x27;s later murders.

==Possible additional victims==
Police firmly believe the Wests were responsible for further unsolved murders and disappearances. They believed they committed ten murders between 1971 and 1979, at least seven of which were for sexual purposes. Following the rash of murders between 1973 and 1975, Fred and Rose are not known to have committed any murders until 1978. They committed one further murder in 1979, followed by an eight-year lull until they murdered their daughter in 1987. Police do not know of any further murders they committed before their 1994 arrest although Fred confessed to murdering up to 30 people, indicating up to 18 other undiscovered victims.

Fred&#x27;s remarkably relaxed, emotionally sterile attitude towards all aspects of his crimes startled many members of the enquiry team. This prompted Superintendent John Bennett to seek the assistance of a criminal psychologist for an expert opinion on Fred&#x27;s state of mind. After analysing Fred&#x27;s behaviour throughout the extensive 1994 interviews, psychologist Paul Britton advised Superintendent Bennett that Fred&#x27;s blasé manner indicated he had committed so many offences over such a long period that he was now indifferent to the acts of torture, mutilation and murder. Britton added that although an offender of this nature may come to offend less frequently, he would be unlikely to cease killing altogether.

One theory which may explain the sudden lull in the frequency of their murders is the fact that by the mid-1970s, the Wests had begun a practice of befriending teenage girls from nearby care homes, many of whom they sexually abused, with others encouraged to engage in prostitution within their home. The Wests established acquaintances—including several of their lodgers—willing to partake in their shared fetishes, which may have satiated the couple to a degree.

Caroline Owens, Anna Marie West, and several other survivors of sexual assaults at the Wests&#x27; hands each testified at Rose&#x27;s trial that she had been by far the more calculating, aggressive and controlling of the two. Owens stated that, at one stage in her ordeal, Fred said that they had abducted Owens primarily for Rose&#x27;s gratification. It is possible Rose&#x27;s increasing family size, plus the fact she and her husband had, by the mid-1970s, begun seeking avenues to exploit girls from care homes in addition to acquiring contacts—willing or unwilling—to submit to their fetishes, may have led Fred and Rose to decide that these avenues of control and domination were sufficient for their satisfaction.

Four young women similar in age and physical characteristics to those Fred was later charged with murdering in Gloucestershire are known to have disappeared during the time Fred lived in Glasgow—one of whom, Margaret McAvoy, Fred had been acquainted with via his employment as an ice cream van driver. He had also rented a garden allotment adjacent to his house and which he frequently visited, although only a small section of this plot was ever cultivated. To one neighbour, Fred remarked that he used the remainder for &quot;something special&quot;, about which he refused to elaborate. Much of the supposed cultivation of this allotment occurred in the early hours of the morning. Police were unable to investigate whether any further bodies were buried at this location, as these allotments were built over in the 1970s as a section of the M8 motorway.

==Aftermath==
Fred&#x27;s body was cremated in Coventry on 29 March 1995 in a funeral that was attended by just four of his children. In a five-minute service, in which no hymns were sung, the Reverend Robert Simpson quoted sections of Psalm 23, then added a solemn reminder to those present that they must &quot;also remember everyone else who has also suffered because of these tragic events&quot;. His ashes are believed to have been scattered at the Welsh seaside resort of Barry Island, a location he had regularly visited both as a child and as an adult with his family.

After the 1994 arrest of their parents, the four youngest West children (born between 1978 and 1983), were given new identities to protect them from the notoriety of their family. Each child remained in foster care.

The remains of Charmaine and Rena were cremated in Kettering. At the insistence of Anna Marie West, mother and daughter shared the same coffin, and no roses were to be brought to the service by any mourners.

Two weeks after Anna Marie West delivered her testimony against her stepmother in 1995, she attempted suicide. She again attempted suicide in 1999 by throwing herself from a bridge into the River Severn.

When asked at trial why she had not spoken against the ongoing physical, emotional, and sexual abuse she had endured for seven years before running away from home when she was 15, Anna Marie emphasised that, as a child and adolescent, she had not known any other normality, adding, &quot;[My father and stepmother] were all I had.&quot;

Stephen West is also known to have made a suicide attempt in 2002, by attempting to hang himself. In 2004, he was jailed for nine months for having unlawful sex with a 14-year-old girl on multiple occasions. 

As a direct result of her tenacity in investigating the Wests, DC Hazel Savage was placed upon the annual New Year&#x27;s honours list. The following year, she was awarded an MBE.
The Wests&#x27; house in Cromwell Street was demolished in October 1996, with every piece of debris destroyed to discourage potential souvenir hunters. It had been referred to in the press as the &quot;House of Horrors&quot;. The site was later redeveloped into a public pathway.

Fred&#x27;s younger brother, John, hanged himself in the garage of his Gloucester home in November 1996. At the time of his suicide, he had been awaiting the jury verdict in his trial for the alleged multiple rapes of his niece, Anna Marie, and another underage girl at Cromwell Street in the 1970s.

In March 1996, Rose announced her intentions to appeal against her sentence, contending extensive press coverage had rendered witness testimony unreliable, that no physical evidence existed to attest she had participated in any of the murders, that the final instructions delivered by the judge to the jury had been biased in favour of the prosecution, and that undue weight had been given to the similar fact evidence introduced at her trial. This appeal was rejected by the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Taylor of Gosforth, who contended Rose had received a fair trial and efficient legal representation. In July 1997, then-Home Secretary Jack Straw subjected Rose to a whole life tariff, effectively denying her any possibility of parole. Rose again announced that she would appeal against her sentence via her solicitor Leo Goatley in October 2000; in September 2001, she announced her intentions to abandon her appeals, stating she would never feel free even if released. She maintains her innocence in any of the murders.

Both of Rose&#x27;s oldest biological children and her stepdaughter, Anna Marie, initially visited her in prison on a regular basis, although by 2006, she had ceased contact with them after Mae began asking questions about her culpability in the murders. Rose justified her decision with the explanation: &quot;I was never a parent [then] and could never be now.&quot; The sole visitor Rose continues to receive in prison is Anna Marie, who later changed her name to Anne Marie.

The body of the Wests&#x27; former friend and housemate, Terrence Crick, was found in his car in the Scarborough district of Hackness in January 1996. He was 48 years old. Crick had become acquainted with Fred while he had lived at the Lake House Caravan Park in 1969; he had reported Fred to the authorities on several occasions after having been shown surgical instruments Fred claimed to have used to perform illegal abortions, and Polaroid images of the subjects&#x27; genitals he claimed to have taken immediately after the procedures. Crick had further informed authorities Fred had asked him to assist in finding pregnant girls to perform abortions upon.

Crick had believed the information he had provided to police was ignored as Fred was a known police informant. The stress and guilt Crick had felt over the fact the information he had provided had not resulted in charges being brought apparently led him to take his own life. An inquest later recorded a verdict of suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning.

In 2004, one of the Wests&#x27; youngest children, Barry, claimed to have witnessed the murder of his sister Heather. According to Barry (who was seven at the time), Fred and Rose had restrained, then sexually and physically abused Heather, before Rose had repeatedly stamped upon her head until she ceased to move.

Barry West took his own life via a suspected drug overdose in October 2020 at the age of 40. For several years prior to his death, he is known to have battled a drug addiction and psychiatric problems as a result of the abuse he witnessed and endured as a child.

<doc id="200823" wikidata="Q1068411" url="?curid=200823" title="Collision domain">
<text>A collision domain is a network segment (connected by a shared medium or through repeaters) where simultaneous data transmissions collide with one another as a result of more than one device attempting to send a packet on the network segment at the same time. The collision domain applies particularly in wireless networks, but also affected early versions of Ethernet. Members of a collision domain may be involved in collisions with one another. Devices outside the collision domain do not have collisions with those inside.

A channel access method dictates that only one device in the collision domain may transmit at any one time, and the other devices in the domain listen to the network and refrain from transmitting while others are already transmitting in order to avoid collisions. Because only one device may be transmitting at any one time, total network bandwidth is shared among all devices on the collision domain. Collisions also decrease network efficiency in a collision domain as collisions require devices to abort transmission and retransmit at a later time.

Since data bits are propagated at a finite speed, &quot;simultaneously&quot; is to be defined in terms of the size of the collision domain and the minimum packet size allowed. A smaller packet size or a larger dimension would make it possible for a sender to finish sending the packet without the first bits of the message being able to reach the most remote node. So, that node could start sending as well, without a clue to the transmission already taking place and destroying the first packet. Unless the size of the collision domain allows the initial sender to receive the second transmission attempt – the collision – within the time it takes to send the packet, they would neither be able to detect the collision nor to repeat the transmission – this is called a late collision.

==Ethernet==
On Ethernet using shared media, collisions are resolved using carrier-sense multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD) in which the competing packets are discarded and re-sent one at a time. This becomes a source of inefficiency in the network.

Early Ethernet variants (10BASE5, 10BASE2) were based on a shared wire and inherently half-duplex, representing a single, potentially large collision domain. Collision domains are also found in an Ethernet hub or repeater environment where each host segment connects to a hub, and all segments represent only one collision domain within one broadcast domain. Collision domains are also found in other shared medium networks, e. g. wireless networks such as Wi-Fi.

Modern wired networks use a network switch to reduce or eliminate collisions. By connecting each device directly to a port on the switch, either each port on a switch becomes its own collision domain (in the case of half-duplex links), or the possibility of collisions is eliminated in the case of full-duplex links. For Gigabit Ethernet and faster, no hubs or repeaters exist and all devices require full-duplex links.

== Wireless networks ==

Most wireless LAN networks use the carrier-sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) method. In addition to the requirements of a shared wire medium, wireless networks add the hidden node problem where two senders can&#x27;t hear each other&#x27;s transmissions, but they cause a collision at the receiver between them. Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance for Wireless is one such approach used, specifically in 802.11 RTS/CTS. Central coordination is another means of solving this problem for a collision domain. This technique is employed by Wireless Multimedia Extensions. Point coordination function and distributed coordination function are specific implementations.

<text>BHP Group Limited, also known as Broken Hill Proprietary Company and formerly as BHP Billiton is an Australian multinational mining and metals public company that was founded in August 1885 and is headquartered in Melbourne.

As of 2024, BHP was the world’s largest mining company by market capitalisation and the world’s third-largest by revenue. The company specializes in mining and selling iron ore, copper and coal.

BHP Billiton was formed in 2001 through the merger of the Australian Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited (BHP) and the Anglo–Dutch Billiton plc trading on both the Australian and London Stock Exchanges as a dual-listed company.

In 2015, some BHP Billiton assets were demerged and rebranded as South32, while a scaled-down BHP Billiton became BHP. In 2018, BHP Billiton Limited and BHP Billiton plc became BHP Group Limited and BHP Group plc, respectively. In January 2022, BHP relinquished its London Stock Exchange listing, becoming a solely Australian Securities Exchange-listed company. As of 2022, BHP is the largest company in Australia, and the largest mining company in the world, both as measured by market capitalization. In 2023, the company&#x27;s position in the Forbes Global 2000 was 90th.

==History==
===Billiton===

Billiton Maatschappij was founded 29 September 1860, when its articles of association were approved by a meeting of shareholders in the &quot;Groot Keizershof&quot; hotel in The Hague, Netherlands. Two months later, the company acquired mineral rights to the Billiton (&quot;Belitung&quot;) and Bangka Islands in the Netherlands Indies archipelago off the eastern coast of Sumatra.

Billiton&#x27;s initial ventures included tin and lead smelting in the Netherlands, followed in the 1940s by bauxite mining in Indonesia and Suriname. In 1970, Shell acquired Billiton. Billiton opened a tin smelting and refining plant in Phuket, Thailand, named Thaisarco (for Thailand Smelting And Refining Company, Limited).

In 1994, South Africa&#x27;s Gencor acquired the mining division of Billiton excluding the downstream metal division. Billiton was divested from Gencor in 1997, and was amalgamated with Gold Fields in 1998. In 1997, Billiton plc became a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index and in 2001 Billiton plc merged with the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited (BHP) to form BHP Billiton.

=== Broken Hill Proprietary Company ===

The Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited (BHP), also known by the nickname &quot;the Big Australian&quot;, was incorporated on 13 August 1885, operating the silver and lead mine at Broken Hill, in western New South Wales, Australia. The Broken Hill group floated on 10 August 1885. The first consignment of Broken Hill ore (48 tons, 5 cwt, 3grs) was smelted at the Intercolonial Smelting and Refining Company&#x27;s works at Spotswood, Victoria, a suburb of Melbourne. Historian Christopher Jay notes:

The resulting 35,605 ounces of silver raised a lot of interest when exhibited at the City of Melbourne Bank in Collins Street. Some sceptics asserted the promoters were merely using silver from somewhere else, to ramp up the shares... Another shareholder, the dominating W. R. Wilson had had to lend William Jamieson, General Manager, a new suit so he could take the first prospectus, printed at Silverton near Broken Hill on 20 June 1885, to Adelaide to start the float process.

The geographic Broken Hill, for which the town was named, was discovered and named by Captain Charles Sturt, stirring great interest among prospectors. Nothing of note was discovered until 5 November 1883, when Charles Rasp, boundary rider for the surrounding Mount Gipps Station, pegged out a 40-acre claim with contractors David James and James Poole.

Together with a half-dozen backers, including station manager George McCulloch (a young cousin of Victorian Premier Sir James McCulloch), Rasp formed the Broken Hill Company staking out the entire Hill. As costs mounted during the ensuing months of fruitless search, three of the original seven (now remembered as the Syndicate of Seven) sold their shares, so that, on the eve of the company&#x27;s great success, there were nine shareholders, including Rasp, McCulloch, Philip Charly (aka Charley), David James, James Poole (five of the original syndicate of seven, which had previously included George Urquhart and G.A.M. Lind), Bowes Kelly, W. R. Wilson, and William Jamieson (who had bought shares from several of the founders).

John Darling, Jr. became a director of the company in 1892 and was chairman of directors from 1907 to 1914.

Strongly encouraged by the New South Wales Minister for Public Works, Arthur Hill Griffith, in 1915, the company ventured into steel manufacturing, with its operations based primarily at the Newcastle Steelworks. The decision to move from mining ore at Broken Hill to opening a steelworks at Newcastle was due to the technical limitations in recovering value from mining the lower-lying sulphide ores. The discovery of Iron Knob and Iron Monarch near the western shore of the Spencer Gulf in South Australia, combined with the refinement, by BHP metallurgists A. D. Carmichael and Leslie Bradford, of the froth flotation technique for separating zinc sulphides from the accompanying gangue and subsequent conversion (Carmichael–Bradford process) to oxides of the metal, allowed BHP to economically extract valuable metals from the heaps of tailings up to high at the mine site. In 1942, the Imperial Japanese Navy targeted the BHP steelworks during the largely unsuccessful shelling of Newcastle.

Newcastle operations were closed in 1999, and a 70-ton commemorative sculpture, &quot;The Muster Point&quot;, was installed on Industrial Drive, in the suburb of Mayfield, New South Wales. The long products side of the steel business was spun off to form OneSteel in 2000.

In the 1950s, BHP began petroleum exploration, which became an increasing focus following oil and natural gas discoveries in Bass Strait in the 1960s.

BHP began to diversify into a variety of mining projects overseas. Those included the Ok Tedi copper mine in Papua New Guinea, where the company was successfully sued by the indigenous inhabitants because of the environmental degradation caused by mining operations. BHP had better success with the giant Escondida copper mine in Chile, of which it owns 57.5%, and at the Ekati Diamond Mine in northern Canada, which BHP contracted for in 1996, began mining in 1998, and sold its 80% stake in to Dominion Diamond Corporation in 2013 as production declined.

=== BHP Billiton ===
In 2001, BHP merged with the Billiton mining company to form BHP Billiton. In 2002, flat steel products were demerged to form the publicly traded company BHP Steel which, in 2003, became BlueScope.

In March 2005, BHP Billiton announced a US$7.3 billion agreed bid for WMC Resources, owners of the Olympic Dam copper, gold and uranium mine in South Australia, nickel operations in Western Australia and Queensland, and a Queensland fertiliser plant. The takeover achieved 90 per cent acceptance on 17 June 2005, and 100 per cent ownership was announced on 2 August 2005, achieved through compulsory acquisition of the remaining 10 per cent of the shares.

On 8 November 2007, BHP Billiton announced it was seeking to purchase rival mining group Rio Tinto Group in an all-share deal. The initial offer of 3.4 shares of BHP Billiton stock for each share of Rio Tinto was rejected by the board of Rio Tinto for &quot;significantly undervaluing&quot; the company. It was unknown at the time whether BHP Billiton would attempt to purchase Rio Tinto through some form of hostile takeover. A formal hostile bid of 3.4 BHP Billiton shares for each Rio Tinto share was announced on 6 February 2008; The bid was withdrawn 25 November 2008 due to global recession.

On 14 May 2008, BHP Billiton shares rose to a record high of A$48.90 following speculation that Chinese mining firm Chinalco was considering purchasing a large stake.

As global nickel prices fell, on 25 November 2008, Billiton announced that it would drop its A$66 billion takeover of rival Rio Tinto Group, stating that the &quot;risks to shareholder value&quot; would &quot;increase&quot; to &quot;an unacceptable level&quot; due to the 2007–2008 financial crisis.

On 21 January 2009, BHP Billiton then announced that Ravensthorpe Nickel Mine in Western Australia would cease operations, ending shipments of ore from Ravensthorpe to the Yabulu nickel plant in Queensland Australia. Yabulu refinery was subsequently sold to Queensland billionaire Clive Palmer, becoming the Palmer Nickel and Cobalt Refinery. Pinto Valley mine in the United States was also closed. Mine closures and general scaling back during the 2007–2008 financial crisis accounted for 6,000 employee lay offs.

As the nickel market became saturated by both spiraling economics and cheaper extraction methods; on 9 December 2009, BHP Billiton sold its Ravensthorpe Nickel Mine, which had cost A$2.4 billion to build, to Vancouver-based First Quantum Minerals for US$340 million. First Quantum, a Canadian company, was one of three bidders for the mine, tendering the lowest offer, and returned the mine to production in 2011. Ravensthorpe cost BHP US$3.6 billion in write-downs when it was shut in January 2009 after less than a year of production.

In January 2010, following the BHP Billiton purchase of Athabasca Potash for US$320m, &quot;The Economist&quot; reported that, by 2020, BHP Billiton could produce approximately 15 per cent of the world demand for potash.

In August 2010, BHP Billiton made a hostile takeover bid worth US$40 billion for PotashCorp. The bid came after BHP&#x27;s first bid, made on 17 August, was rejected as being undervalued. This acquisition marked a major strategic move by BHP outside hard commodities and commenced the diversification of its business away from resources with high exposure to carbon price risk, like coal, petroleum and iron ore. The takeover bid was opposed by the Government of Saskatchewan under Premier Brad Wall. On 3 November, Canadian Industry Minister Tony Clement announced the preliminary rejection of the deal under the &quot;Investment Canada Act&quot;, giving BHP Billiton 30 days to refine their deal before a final decision was made; BHP withdrew its offer on 14 November 2010. Canada&#x27;s decision to block the deal was generally viewed as surprising by the global investment community.

On 22 February 2011, BHP Billiton announced that it had paid $4.75 billion in cash to Chesapeake Energy for its Fayetteville shale assets, which include of mineral rights leases and of pipeline located in north central Arkansas. The wells on the mineral leases are currently producing about 415 million cubic feet of natural gas per day. BHP Billiton planned to spend $800 million to $1 billion a year over 10 years to develop the field and triple production.

On 14 July 2011, BHP Billiton announced that it would acquire Petrohawk Energy of the United States for approximately $12.1 billion in cash, considerably expanding its shale natural gas resources in an offer of $US38.75 per share.

On 22 August 2012, BHP Billiton announced that it was delaying its US$20 billion (£12 billion) Olympic Dam copper mine expansion project in South Australia to study less capital intensive options, deferring its dual harbour strategy at West Australian Iron Ore and slowing down its Potash growth option in Canada. The company simultaneously announced a freeze on approving any major new expansion projects.

Days after announcing the Olympic Dam pull-out, BHP Billiton announced that it was selling its Yeelirrie Uranium Project to Canadian Cameco for a fee of around $430 million. The sale was part of a broader move to step away from resource expansion in Australia.

On 19 August 2014, BHP Billiton announced it would create an independent global metals and mining company based on a selection of its aluminium, coal, manganese, nickel, and silver assets. The newly formed entity, named South32, was subsequently demerged with listings on the Australian Securities Exchange the JSE and the London Stock Exchange.

In 2015, BHP Billiton spun off a number of its subsidiaries in South Africa and Southern Africa to form a new company known as South32.

BHP Billiton agreed to pay a fine of $25 million to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission in 2015 in connection with violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act related to its &quot;hospitality program&quot; at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. BHP Billiton invited 176 government and state-owned-enterprise officials to attend the Games on an all-expenses-paid package. While BHP Billiton claimed to have compliance processes in place to avoid conflicts of interest, the SEC found that BHP Billiton had invited officials from at least four countries where BHP Billiton had interests in influencing the officials&#x27; decisions (Congo, Guinea, Philippines and Burundi).

In August 2016, BHP Billiton recorded its worst annual loss in history, $6.4 billion.

Towards the end of 2016 BHP Billiton indicated it would expand its petroleum business and make new investments in the sector.

In February 2017, BHP Billiton announced a $2.2 billion investment in the new BP platform in the Gulf of Mexico. During the same year, as part of their plan to increase productivity at the Escondida mine in Chile, which is the world&#x27;s biggest copper mine, BHP Billiton attempted to get workers to accept a 4-year pay freeze, a 66% reduction in the end-of-conflict bonus offering, and increased shift flexibility. This resulted in a major workers&#x27; strike and forced the company to declare &quot;force majeure&quot; on two shipments, which drove copper prices up by 4%.

In April 2017 activist hedge fund manager Elliott Advisors proposed a plan for BHP Billiton to spin off its American petroleum assets and significantly restructure the business, including the scrapping of its dual Sydney-London listing, suggesting shares be offered only in the United Kingdom, while leaving its headquarters and tax residences in Australia where shares would trade as depository instruments. At the time of the correspondence Elliott held about 4.1 per cent of the issued shares in London-listed BHP Billiton plc, worth $3.81 billion. Australia&#x27;s government warned it would block moves to shift BHP Billiton&#x27;s stock listing from Australia to the United Kingdom. Australian Treasurer Scott Morrison said the move would be contrary to the country&#x27;s national interest and would breach government orders mandating a listing on the Australian Securities Exchange. BHP Billiton dismissed the plan saying the costs and risks of Elliott&#x27;s proposal outweighed any potential benefits.

=== BHP ===
In May 2017, with much of the former Billiton assets having been disposed of, BHP Billiton began to rebrand itself as BHP, at first in Australia and then globally. It replaced the slogan &quot;The Big Australian&quot; with &quot;Think Big&quot;, with an advertising campaign rolling out in mid May 2017. Work on the change began in late 2015 according to BHP&#x27;s chief external affairs officer.

In August 2017, BHP announced that it would sell off its US shale oil and gas business. In July 2018, the company agreed to sell its shale assets to BP for $10.5 billion. BHP indicated its intention to return funds to investors. On 29 September 2018, BHP completed the sale of its Fayetteville Onshore US gas assets to a wholly owned subsidiary of Merit Energy Company.

In August 2021, BHP announced plans to exit the oil and gas industry by merging its hydrocarbon business with Woodside Energy, Australia&#x27;s largest independent gas producer. It also announced its intention to delist from the London Stock Exchange and consolidate on the Australian Securities Exchange. This occurred in January 2022. In April 2023, BHP took over Oz Minerals in a $9.6 billion deal.

In fiscal year 2021-2022, BHP&#x27;s annual profit amounted to more than $34 billion (an increase of 34%) of $65 billion (an increase of 14%). The coal division&#x27;s profits reached almost $9 billion (a loss of $577 million in 2022), with the BHP&#x27;s iron ore division making $21.7 billion (a decrease of $4.6 billion since 2022). Profit growth allowed the company to pay a record dividend of $7.6 billion for the half-year ending December 31.

BHP made an offer to acquire Anglo American for £31 billion in April 2024; however, the offer was rejected by the Anglo American as &quot;highly unattractive&quot;. A revised offer was also rejected in May 2024.

In July 2024, BHP and Lundin Mining agreed to jointly acquire 100% of Filo Corp. through a Canadian plan of arrangement. BHP and Lundin Mining also agreed to form a 50/50 joint venture to hold the Filo del Sol (FDS) and Josemaria projects.

==Corporation==
Until January 2022, BHP was a dual-listed company; the Australian &quot;BHP Billiton Limited&quot; and the British &quot;BHP Billiton plc&quot; were separately listed with separate shareholder bodies, while conducting business as one operation with identical boards of directors and a single management structure. The headquarters of BHP Billiton Limited and the global headquarters of the combined group were located in Melbourne, Australia. The headquarters of BHP Billiton plc were located in London, England. Its main office locations were in Australia, the U.S., Canada, the UK, Chile, Malaysia, and Singapore.

The company&#x27;s shares traded on the following exchanges:

BHP Billiton Limited and BHP Billiton plc were renamed BHP Group Limited and BHP Group plc, respectively, on 19 November 2018.
===Senior management===
In 1998, BHP hired American Paul Anderson to restructure the company. Anderson successfully completed the four-year project with a merger between BHP and London-based Billiton. In July 2002, Brian Gilbertson of Billiton was appointed CEO, but resigned after just six months, citing irreconcilable differences with the board.

Upon Gilbertson&#x27;s departure in early 2003, Chip Goodyear was appointed the new CEO, increasing sales by 47 per cent and profits by 78 per cent during his tenure. Goodyear retired on 30 September 2007. Marius Kloppers was Goodyear&#x27;s successor. Following Kloppers&#x27; tenure, Andrew Mackenzie, chief executive of Non-Ferrous, assumed the role of CEO in 2013. Australia mining head Mike Henry succeeded Mackenzie on 1 January 2020.

== Controversies ==

=== Responsibility for climate damage ===


BHP is listed as one of the 90 fossil fuel extraction and marketing companies responsible for two-thirds of global greenhouse gas emissions since the beginning of the industrial age. Its cumulative emissions as of 2010 have been estimated at 7,606 Mte, representing 0.52% of global industrial emissions between 1751 and 2010, ranking it the 19th-largest corporate polluter. According to BHP management 10% of these emissions are from direct operations, while 90% come from products sold by the company. BHP has been voluntarily reporting its direct GHG emissions since 1996. In 2013, it was criticised for lobbying against carbon pricing in Australia. In June 2024, BHP announced that the company was on track to meet its 30% emissions reduction target by 2030 from 2020 baseline levels and did not rule out using carbon offsets as part of its $4 billion plan to meet the target.

BHP reported total CO2e emissions (Direct + Indirect) for the twelve months ending 30 June 2020 at 15,800 Kt.

=== Ok Tedi environmental disaster ===

The Ok Tedi environmental disaster caused severe harm to the environment along the Ok Tedi River and the Fly River in the Western Province of Papua New Guinea between around 1984 and 2013. In 1999, BHP reported that 90 million tons of mine waste was annually discharged into the river for more than ten years and destroyed downstream villages, agriculture and fisheries. Mine wastes were deposited along of the Ok Tedi and the Fly River below its confluence with the Ok Tedi, and over an area of . BHP&#x27;s CEO, Paul Anderson, said that the Ok Tedi Mine was &quot;not compatible with our environmental values and the company should never have become involved.&quot; , mine operators continued to discharge 80 million tons of tailings, overburden, and mine-induced erosion into the river system each year. About of forest has died or is under stress. As many as may eventually be harmed.

In the 1990s the communities of the lower Fly Region, including the Yonggom people, sued BHP and received US$28.6 million in an out-of-court settlement, which was the culmination of an enormous public-relations campaign against the company by environmental groups. As part of the settlement, a (limited) dredging operation was put in place and efforts were made to rehabilitate the site around the mine. However, the mine is still in operation and waste continues to flow into the river system. BHP was granted legal indemnity from future mine related damages. Experts predict that it will take 300 years to clean up the toxic contamination.

=== Bento Rodrigues dam collapse ===

In 2015, the company was involved in the Bento Rodrigues tailings dam collapse, the worst environmental disaster in the history of the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. On 5 November 2015, an iron ore mine tailings dam near Mariana, south-eastern Brazil, owned and operated by Samarco, a subsidiary of BHP and Vale, suffered a catastrophic failure, devastating the nearby town of Bento Rodrigues with the mudflow, killing 19 people, injuring more than 50 and causing enormous ecological damage, and threatening life along the Rio Doce and the Atlantic Ocean near the mouth of the Rio Doce. The accident was one of the biggest environmental disasters in Brazil&#x27;s history.

An investigation into the disaster commissioned by BHP, Vale and Samarco found the collapse was due to a variety of construction and design flaws. In June 2018, Samarco, Vale and BHP signed an agreement for the Brazilian government to drop a $7 billion civil lawsuit against the mining companies and allow two years for the companies to address the greater US$55 billion civil lawsuit brought by Brazil&#x27;s federal prosecutors seeking social, environmental and economic compensation.

=== Escondida and Cerro Colorado water usage issue ===
BHP has been accused of perpetrating irregularities with respect to drawing waters above the granted limit from the aquifers. Due to which the water table has dropped significantly, making land-based livelihoods less viable for people of the community, many of whom have been forced to relocate to urban areas. In January 2021, the Supreme Court of Chile validated the objections of local indigenous tribes about BHP&#x27;s water usage and impacts on wetland areas. Later in July, the same court ordered BHP to begin the application process for Cerro Colorado operating permits from scratch.

=== Sexual harassment ===
From 2019 to 2021, BHP registered six cases of sexual assault and 73 cases of sexual harassment. A survey of 425 workers conducted by The Western Mine Workers&#x27; Alliance, showed that two-thirds of female respondents had experienced verbal sexual harassment while working in the FIFO mining industry, with 36% of women and 10% of men having experienced some form of harassment in the last 12 months. In response, BHP terminated or otherwise permanently removed forty eight workers from its sites.

==Other significant accidents==
Bad weather caused a BHP Billiton helicopter to crash in Angola on 16 November 2007, killing the helicopter&#x27;s five occupants. The deceased were: BHP Billiton Angola Chief Operating Officer David Hopgood (Australian), Angola Technical Services Operations Manager Kevin Ayre (British), Wild Dog Helicopters pilot Kottie Breedt (South African), Guy Sommerfield (British) of MMC and Louwrens Prinsloo (Namibian) of Prinsloo Drilling. The helicopter crashed approximately from the Alto Cuilo diamond exploration camp in Lunda Norte, northeastern Angola. BHP Billiton responded by suspending operations in the country.

<text>Bernice Rubens (26 July 1923 – 13 October 2004) was a Welsh novelist. She became the first woman to win the Booker Prize in 1970, for &quot;The Elected Member&quot;.

==Personal life==
Bernice Ruth Reuben was born in Splott, Cardiff, Wales, on 26 July 1923, the third of four children of Eli Reuben and his wife Dorothy, . (Her obituary in &quot;The Independent&quot; says &quot;though she later said 1928&quot;, and several sources report her birth date as 26 July 1928.) Her father was a Lithuanian Jew who, at the age of 16, left mainland Europe in 1900 in the hope of starting a new life in New York City. Due to being swindled by a ticket tout, he never reached the United States, his passage taking him no further than Cardiff. He decided to stay in Wales, and there he met and married Dorothy Cohen, whose Polish family had also emigrated to Cardiff.

Bernice was one of four children and came from a musical family, both her brothers, Harold and Cyril, becoming well-known classical musicians. Her sister Beryl was a prestigious viola and violin teacher. Harold was forced to quit playing through illness, but Cyril (1926-1996) became a violinist in the London Symphony Orchestra. Bernice failed to follow in her family&#x27;s musical tradition, though she would later learn the cello. She was educated at Cardiff High School for Girls and later read English at the University of Wales, Cardiff, where she was awarded her BA in 1947.

She married Rudolf Nassauer, a wine merchant who also wrote poetry and fiction. They had two daughters, Rebecca and Sharon. From 1950 to 1955, Rubens taught at a grammar school in Birmingham, before moving onto the film industry where she made documentaries. In the 1960s the poet Jon Silkin rented the attic storey of their London house and sublet rooms to David Mercer, later a prolific West End and TV playwright, and Malcolm Ross-Macdonald, later an equally prolific writer of historical novels.

A chain smoker all her life, Rubens became to suffer from her health from the late 1990s. She died in the Royal Free Hospital, London, from stroke combined with chronic bronchitis, &quot;a classic illness of smokers&quot;, on 13 October 2004, aged 81 (generally reported as 76).

==Professional career as a writer==
Rubens&#x27; first novel, &quot;Set On Edge&quot;, was published in 1960. In 1970, she became the first woman to win the Booker Prize (the second year of the prize&#x27;s existence), for her novel &quot;The Elected Member&quot;. As of 2024, Rubens is still the only Welsh author to have won the Booker Prize.

Throughout her life, Rubens ensured that she wrote every single day. 

In June 2024 a Purple Plaque was installed on the house that was her family&#x27;s home in Roath.

==Adaptations==
Her 1962 novel, &quot;Madame Sousatzka&quot;, was made into a film in 1988, with Shabana Azmi and Shirley MacLaine. This book was based on the experiences of her brother Harold Rubens, a child prodigy pianist, and his teacher Madame Maria Levinskaya (died 1960) who inspired the character of Madame Sousatzka. Harold Rubens was born in Cardiff in 1918, and studied with Levinskaya from the age of seven. The musical &quot;Sousatzka&quot; was produced in Toronto in 2017. It was intended to be a pre-Broadway tryout for controversial producer Garth Drabinsky. Victoria Clark portrayed the title role. 

Her 1975 novel, &quot;I Sent a Letter To My Love&quot;, was made into a film (&quot;Chère inconnue&quot;) in 1980 by Moshe Mizraki, starring Simone Signoret and Jean Rochefort.

Her 1985 novel, &quot;Mr Wakefield&#x27;s Crusade&quot;, was adapted for television by the BBC in 1992, starring Peter Capaldi and Michael Maloney.

<doc id="200836" wikidata="Q303216" url="?curid=200836" title="Henri de La Tour d'Auvergne, Viscount of Turenne">
<text>Henri de La Tour d&#x27;Auvergne, vicomte de Turenne (11 September 161127 July 1675), commonly known as Turenne (), was a French general and one of only six marshals to have been promoted Marshal General of France. The most illustrious member of the La Tour d&#x27;Auvergne family, his military exploits over his five-decade career earned him a reputation as one of the greatest military commanders in history.

Born to a Huguenot family, the son of a Marshal of France, he was introduced to the art of war at a young age. He first served as a volunteer in the Dutch States Army under the orders of his maternal uncles Maurice of Nassau and Frederick Henry before pursuing his career in the service of France, where his noble origins and proven qualities soon saw him rise to the top of the military hierarchy. He rose to prominence during the Thirty Years&#x27; War by capturing the fortress of Breisach in 1638. Promoted Marshal of France in 1643, he struck against Bavaria the following year, defeating the Bavarian army in three years of campaigning and forcing the Elector of Bavaria to make peace. The Elector soon broke the treaty and in 1648 Turenne invaded again with Swedish support, subduing the Imperial army at Zusmarshausen and pacifying Bavaria.

Turenne initially supported the Fronde but returned to royal service in 1651, emerging as France&#x27;s foremost general by defeating the rebellious army of the Prince of Condé on the outskirts of Paris and re-occupying the city. 
His triumphs against Spanish armies at Arras (1654) and at Dunkirk (1658) led to the overrunning of much of the Spanish Netherlands and brought the war against Spain to a victorious conclusion. Two years later, Louis XIV appointed him Marshal General of France. Although a supporter of absolute monarchy, he only converted to Catholicism in 1668, refusing to do so earlier despite political incentives.

During the War of Devolution in 1667 Turenne captured the Spanish Netherlands practically without resistance. In 1672 the French invaded the Dutch Republic and the Marshal General conquered the country up to Amsterdam. Checked by the Dutch flooding of the land, he invaded the Holy Roman Empire the next year, reaching the Elbe and compelling Brandenburg to abandon the anti-French coalition. Faced with the loss of Alsace to superior Allied forces, he crowned his career with a series of battlefield victories, most notably at Turckheim (1675) and a masterful strategic turning movement around the Vosges in mid-winter that drove the Imperials from Alsace. He was killed by an Imperial cannonball at the battle of Salzbach in 1675.

==Background and early career==

The second son of Henri de La Tour d&#x27;Auvergne, Duke of Bouillon, sovereign Prince of Sedan, by his second wife Elizabeth, daughter of William the Silent, Prince of Orange, he was born at Sedan. It is said that much of his money found its way to the poor during his early life. He received a Huguenot education and the usual training of a young noble of the time, but physical infirmity hampered his progress, though he showed a marked skill at history and geography, and was greatly impressed by the exploits of Alexander the Great and Caesar. At first he was a lazy student but after his father started saying his intellectual laziness was as great a barrier to joining the army as his physical weakness, he began to study on his own accord. After his father&#x27;s death in 1623, he devoted himself to bodily exercises and in a great measure overcame his natural weakness. Turenne and his mother were devout Calvinists and were suspicious of Cardinal Richelieu, so when Turenne began his military career at the age of fourteen, he did so in the camp of his uncle, Maurice of Nassau, the Stadtholder of Holland and Prince of Orange. He started as a private in Maurice&#x27;s bodyguard during the Eighty Years&#x27; War.

Frederick Henry of Nassau, who succeeded his brother Maurice as Stadtholder and Prince of Orange in 1625, granted Turenne a captaincy in 1626. Turenne personally drilled his troops, as was the custom at the time, and won their respect with his charity and simple lifestyle. His company was alleged to be the best drilled and most disciplined one in the army, he required of his soldiers not only discipline but also high moral standards. His kindness made him well-liked among the entire army. The young officer took his part in the sieges of the period, learning much about fortifications and siege warfare. In 1629, Turenne served in the siege of Bois-le-Duc as commander of a artillery and reconnaissance. He won special commendation for his skill at this battle, but was reprimanded for recklessness. He also learned much about the details of leading an army, like posting guards and reconnaissance. In 1630 Turenne left the Netherlands and entered the service of France, motivated both by the prospect of military advancement but also because of his mother&#x27;s desire to display loyalty to the French crown.

Cardinal Richelieu immediately made him colonel of an infantry regiment. Yet he continued to serve with the prince of Orange at short intervals, who at the time had an alliance with France. He took part in successful fighting near Antwerp and fought against Hendrik van den Bergh. He took part in an uneventful campaign under Schomberg in 1630 but his first serious service under the French flag occurred at the siege of La Mothe in Lorraine by Marshal de la Force (1634), where his brilliant courage at the assault won him immediate promotion to the rank of &quot;maréchal de camp&quot; (equivalent to the modern grade of major-general). In 1635 Turenne served under Louis de Nogaret de La Valette in Lorraine and on the Rhine. The French and their allies raised the Imperial siege of Mainz (8 August 1635), but the French army had to fall back on Metz for want of provisions. In the retreat he measured swords with the famous imperial General Gallas, and distinguished himself greatly. He managed to defeat his pursuers in battle but the Imperials were too numerous to be turned around. The reorganised army took the field again in 1636 and captured Saverne (Zabern), at the storming of which he was seriously wounded. In 1637 he took part in the campaign of Flanders, including the capture of Landrecies (26 July). In the latter part of 1638, serving under Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar (1608–1639), he directed the assault on Breisach (reputedly the strongest fortress on the upper Rhine), which surrendered on 17 December. In led the assault on the powerful fortress of Vieux-Brisach in 1638 and obtained its capitulation on December 17 

Turenne had now gained a reputation as one of the foremost of the younger generals of France, and Richelieu next employed him in the Italian campaign of 1639–1640 under Henri de Lorraine, count of Harcourt. On 19 November 1639 Turenne fought in the famous rearguard action called the battle of the &quot;Route de Quiers&quot;, for which he received a lot of credit though he only gave himself a small role in his own description of events. At the battle of Casal 10.000 Frenchmen defeated 20.000 Spanish. The French commander Harcourt was almost encircled but Turenne used deception to scare off the enemy and the battle was won. In 1640 Harcourt saved Casale Monferrato and besieged Prince Thomas&#x27; forces in Turin, which meanwhile besieged in their turn another French force in the citadel. That winter he re-victualled the citadel of Turin, held by the French against the forces of Prince Thomas of Savoy. The French in the citadel held out, while Prince Thomas had to surrender on 17 September 1640, a fourth army which had invested Harcourt&#x27;s lines being at the same time forced to retire. Turenne, by now lieutenant-general, played a major role in the victory. He himself commanded during the campaign of 1641 and took Coni, Ceva and Mondovì.

In 1642 he served as second-in-command of the French troops which conquered Roussillon. At this time Richelieu discovered the conspiracy of Cinq Mars in which Turenne&#x27;s elder brother, the Duke of Bouillon, had become implicated.

==Marshal of France==

The relations of the principality of Sedan to the French crown markedly influenced the earlier career of Turenne; sometimes it proved necessary to advance the soldier to conciliate the ducal family, at other times the machinations of the ducal family against Richelieu or Mazarin prevented the king&#x27;s advisers from giving their full confidence to their general in the field. Moreover, his steady adherence to the Protestant religion provided a further element of difficulty in Turenne&#x27;s relations with the ministers. Cardinal Richelieu nevertheless entrusted him with the command in Italy in 1643 under prince Thomas, who had changed sides in the quarrel, and who was not trusted by Richelieu. Thomas, while in theory in command himself, quickly put Turenne in control of the campaign. Using deception to fool the Spanish into weakening the Trino Turenne took the town in a few weeks. He was promoted to Marshal of France (16 May 1643).

Turenne was recalled due to the intrigues of Cardinal Mazarin, who was sabotaging Turenne&#x27;s career. This meant that he was available in case of sudden need for a good commander. After the French suffered a devastating defeat at Tuttlingen, Turenne was thrown back into action. The following campaign would greatly advance his career.

While molding the army back into fighting condition Turenne bought mounts for 5,000 cavalrymen and clothes for 4,000 infantrymen with his own money. The reorganization finished, Turenne began campaigning in June 1644, crossing the river Rhine at Breisach. He defeated Gaspard von Mercy in the Black Forest before retreating to the Rhine. Unable to relieve the besieged Freiburg with inferior numbers, he was quickly joined by a force under the Duke of Enghien, later to be known as the Grand &quot;Condé&quot;. The Duke, as a prince of the royal house, took the chief command of the united armies of &quot;France&quot; and &quot;Weimar&quot;. The desperately fought battle of Freiburg against Franz von Mercy&#x27;s Bavarians (3, 5 and 9 August 1644) proved the chief event of the first campaign. In this battle Turenne distinguished himself with a well executed strike at the enemy flank. The French continued on by successfully besieging Philippsburg. Before the capitulation Enghien withdrew and left Turenne in command. At the same time the Duke of Lorraine moved to besiege nearby Bacharach. Turenne took 500 men and built a huge camp near Bacharach, believing Turenne had a large force Lorraine retreated. Turenne continued on by taking the important fortress of Kreuznach and blocking the route between the two armies.

Turenne began the 1645 campaign with a successful forward movement, but Mercy managed to deceive him into thinking the Bavarians were scattered and far away and he was taken by surprise and defeated at Mergentheim. While Turenne had quickly ordered his forces to unite one of his subordinates, general Rosen, was not informed on the situation, defied the order, leading to defeat while Turenne&#x27;s main force was winning. Turenne&#x27;s army lost all of its artillery and baggage and five-sixths of its infantry. Turenne retreated to Hesse, which caused its forces to join the French as well as a Swedish force and reinforcements under Condé, who took command once again. The Swedes soon departed, but Enghien commanded still 17,000 men. The French marched into Bavaria with facing little opposition until they caught up with Mercy&#x27;s retreating army. Mercy inflicted casualties on the French in an artillery duel and outmanoeuvred them in the march on Allerheim, buying time to fortify his position. Turenne advised not to fight but this was rejected by Condé. Turenne&#x27;s plan of attack was accepted by Condé. The following battle was a French victory and Mercy was killed but the French had suffered heavily. Ill health forced Enghien to retire soon afterwards, leaving Turenne for the third time in command of the French army. He was met by superior imperial forces and forced to retreat. At Philippsburg, Turenne crossed the Rhine using a bridge made of boats.

A month after his retreat Turenne marched 120 miles to Trier which he recaptured for its elector Philipp Christoph von Sötern after over a decade of imperialist occupation. Having taken control of the Moselle for France by this move he set upon improving the defence of that river. Turenne now returned to France where he was offered the Duchy of Château-Thierry, which had also been promised to his brother, by Mazarin, who was trying to drive a wedge between Turenne and his rebellious brother, but Turenne saw what the cardinal was doing and accepted only if the transaction to his brother was completed. 

In 1646 Turenne obtained more military successes. He decided to unite his forces with the Swedish under Carl Gustaf Wrangel. Mazarin however had made a deal with the Duke of Bavaria not to unite French and Swedish forces and not to cross the Rhine. In return, the Bavarians would not join the Imperial army. He ordered Turenne to besiege Luxembourg but Turenne correctly suspected the Duke of Bavaria of foul play and procrastinated. Soon the Bavarian army linked up with the imperials and Turenne tried to the same to assist Wrangel. He was successful by using a detour via Wesel because there was no other bridge south of there he could use. In conjunction with Wrangel, Turenne marched unhindered up until the area between Memmingen and Landsberg am Lech. Their combined army invaded Bavaria by crossing the Danube and advanced as far as Munich and Bregenz, plundering their way through the country. This convinced the Elector of Bavaria to conclude a truce in March 1647. With these manoeuvres Napoleon said he displayed &quot;great boldness, sagacity and genius; they are fertile in grand results, and ought to be studied by all military men&quot;. In 1647 he proposed to attack the weakened army of the emperor, but he was ordered into Flanders instead. Not only did France thus lose an opportunity, but a serious mutiny broke out amongst the Weimar troops, who had not received their pay for six months. Rosen, who had been recently promoted to high office on Turenne&#x27;s insistence, convinced the Weimarian cavalry to revolt, pretending to be held prisoner by them. Turenne had already left for Flanders with his main force but rode back with a small contingent, surprising the mutineers. Instead of destroying them with a surprise attack, he marched with them as if he was still in command and managed to secretly have Rosen arrested after which the mutiny died down. He then marched into Luxembourg but soon received orders to switch to the Rhine. As Turenne predicted Bavaria again joined the Imperial cause in 1647. He compelled the imperials to lift Siege of Worms and formally declared war on Bavaria. After joining with the Swedes, once again led by Wrangel, they moved together against the imperials. Scouts detected the imperials, and during the following night Turenne secretly moved his troops close to the imperials. The following day, 17 May, the imperials marched off unaware of the danger resulting in their rearguard being caught isolated and defeated in a vicious battle at Zusmarshausen. Troops subsequently wasted Bavaria with fire and sword until a more secure pacification was obtained. This devastation, for which many modern writers have blamed Turenne, appeared no more harsh a measure than the spirit of the times and the circumstances of the case permitted. Turenne planned on moving into Austria and taking Vienna, but as the Peace of Westphalia had been signed this campaign never materialized.

==The Fronde and the early reign of Louis XIV==
The Peace of Westphalia (1648) brought little peace to France, which soon became involved in the civil war of the Fronde (1648–1653). During the first war, he refused to join either side. Mazarin had him removed as commander of the army of Weimar causing Turenne to flee to the Netherlands, where he remained until the treaty of Rueil (March 1649) put an end to the first war of the Fronde. Louis, Grand Condé had made many enemies at court, especially Mazarin, which would eventually lead to conflict. While Condé had expected to be rewarded greatly for his military service, which had turned the Fronde in Mazarin&#x27;s favour, Mazarin did not have a high opinion of Condé&#x27;s accomplishment. Condé had recently inherited the princely title of Condé, won great fame and influence through his military actions, was made prince of the blood and had built strong connections among the members of the first Fronde. Now he and Mazarin were busy plotting each other&#x27;s destruction. The second war erupted when Condé and some of his allies were arrested. Turenne, intended for arrest with them, escaped in time, and with the duchess de Longueville held Stenay for the cause of the &quot;Princes&quot;—Condé, his brother Conti, and his brother-in-law the Duc de Longueville. Love for the duchess seems to have ruled Turenne&#x27;s action, both in the first war and, now, in seeking Spanish aid for the Princes. In this war Turenne sustained one of his few reverses at Rethel (15 December 1650), but the second conflict ended in the early months of the following year with the collapse of the court party and the release of the Princes.

Turenne reconciled and returned to Paris in May 1651, but the trouble soon revived and Condé again raised the standard of revolt in the south of France. In this, the third war of the Fronde, Turenne and Condé stood opposed to each other, the marshal commanding the royal armies, the prince that of the Frondeurs and their Spanish allies. Turenne displayed the personal bravery of a young soldier at Jargeau (28 March 1652), the skill and wariness of a veteran general at Gien (7 April), and he practically crushed the civil war in the Battle of the Faubourg St Antoine (2 July) and in the re-occupation of Paris (21 October).

== Against Spain ==

Turenne still needed to deal with Condé, who was fighting alongside the Spaniards. The long-drawn-out campaigns of the &quot;Spanish Fronde&quot; gave ample scope for the display of military skill by both the famous captains. In June 1653 Turenne and La Ferté marched against the Frondeurs. They had 7,000 infantry and 5,000 cavalry (or 6,000 infantry and 10,000 cavalry, according to a different source). Condé controlled 30,000 troops. Hearing that the Spanish army camped in two positions 120 miles apart, he rapidly marched on and captured Rethel, which lay between them. Now a Spanish force, the one not commanded by Condé, of 16,000 infantry and 11,000 cavalry arrived in the area. Turenne decided to shadow this force to prevent it from taking Paris with Condé, and limit their freedom of action until winter. The Spanish intended only to take a few forts so Turenne was successful. At one point Condé was in a position to defeat Turenne but the Spanish commander did not allow Condé to attack. Eventually the Spanish managed to evade Turenne and captured Rocroi, but while they were doing this Turenne took Mouzon. He also took Sainte-Menehould.

Turenne started the 1654 campaign by moving on Stenay, one of the centres of the Fronde and personal property of Condé. Turenne had received reinforcement for the campaign and prepared vigorously to defend against a relief attempt. Instead Condé and Archduke Leopold Wilhelm outmanoeuvred him by besieging the crucial fortress of Arras. As Condé and the Archduke had 25,000 troops, and Turenne could call on only 14,000-15,000, Turenne decided to wait until Stenay fell before moving against the Frondeurs in force. Turenne was not in sole command: the Duke of York, La Ferté, Broglie, and Hocquincourt all had authority as well. However he overcame opposition to his plan to deal aggressively with the more numerous Spanish army. Turenne had tirelessly prepared for the attack. He scouted the enemy positions in person and realized the Spanish would take too long to decide whether to attack him or not. He provided religious services to his troops and explained to his officers the techniques to use against the elaborate Spanish defences. The Spanish were routed, losing 6,000 men and 63 cannons, while the French lost just 400 men. This victory was a turning point: from then on, the French had a marked advantage in the region.

Before the campaign of 1655 another important matter required Turenne&#x27;s energies. Riots had broken out in Paris, combined with political disputes between the king and parliament; civil conflict threatened again. The king forbade parliament from the meeting while parliament for their part ignored this demand. At the invitation of the increasingly despotic Mazarin Turenne was invited to negotiate, which he did successfully.

Turenne started the 1655 campaign by taking Landrecies. Soon after, Turenne almost captured Condé but the failure of a subordinate led to the latter&#x27;s escape. Turenne then took the fortresses of Condé and St. Guislain before being recalled to the court at Compiègne. Hocquincourt had been robbed of his important position by Mazarin and was now approached by Condé. If Hocquincourt surrendered Ham and Peronne, which he was in charge of, the French position would be much weaker. Turenne could not move forces to the place due to the Spanish dispositions, but convinced Mazarin to negotiate with Hocquincourt, which succeeded.

At this point Cromwell&#x27;s England as well as Lorraine, up until now Spain&#x27;s ally, joined the French side. Philip IV of Spain replaced the commanders who had been so unsuccessful in the last campaigns with the veteran commanders Marshal Caracena and Don Juan of Austria. In June troops under Turenne and La Ferté surrounded Valenciennes, beginning the siege of that place. The Spanish broke the nearby dikes to flood Turenne&#x27;s position but Turenne had the water diverted to flood part of the city. When Turenne observed the Spaniards preparing for an attack, he gave orders to prepare for an afternoon or nighttime attack. But La Ferté did not carry out the order, so when the Spanish attacked, his position was overrun in no more than 15 minutes. La Ferté and 4,400 troops were captured. Despite the confusion and darkness, Turenne managed to collect his forces and made an ordered retreat, though losing half his artillery. After twelve miles, Turenne ordered a halt. Seeing the French in battle array the Spanish suspected a trap and as a result failed to attack. Despite this, Turenne was unable to save Condé and Quesnoy, but he did take La Chapelle, which Condé failed to relieve, and prevented the fall of St. Guislain.

In his later commentary, Napoleon criticized Turenne for the defeat at Valenciennes. He wrote that Turenne should have marched against the Spanish because the river split his army, and so he could not support La Ferté if the latter needed help.

The war eventually concluded soon after Turenne&#x27;s crushing victory at the Battle of the Dunes near Dunkirk in 1658, in which a corps of English veterans sent by Cromwell played a notable part (3–14 June); a victory which, followed by another successful campaign in 1658, led to the Treaty of the Pyrenees in 1659.

On the death of Mazarin in 1661, Louis XIV took the reins of government into his own hands, and as one of his first acts appointed Turenne &quot;marshal-general of the camps and armies of the king&quot;. He had offered to revive the office of Constable of France (suppressed in 1627) in Turenne&#x27;s favour if the marshal would become a Roman Catholic. Turenne declined. Born of Calvinist parents and educated a Protestant, he had refused to marry one of Richelieu&#x27;s nieces in 1639 and subsequently rejected a similar proposal from Mazarin.

In 1652, Turenne married Charlotte de Caumont, a daughter of the Protestant Marshal de la Force, to whom he remained deeply attached. But he sincerely deplored the division of Christianity into two hostile camps. He had always distrusted the influence of many dissident and uncontrolled sects; the history of independence in the English army and people made a deep impression on his mind, and the same fear of indiscipline which drove the English Presbyterians into royalism drew Turenne more and more towards the Roman Catholic Church. The letters between him and his wife show how closely both studied available evidence on the matter, and in the end, two years after her death, the eloquence of Bossuet and the persuasions of his nephew, the Cardinal de Bouillon, persuaded him to become Catholic in October 1668.

In 1667 he had returned to the more congenial air of the &quot;Camps and Armies of the King&quot;, directing (nominally under Louis XIV) the famous &quot;Promenade Militaire&quot; in which the French overran the Spanish Netherlands. Soon afterwards Condé, now reconciled with the king, rivalled Turenne&#x27;s success by the rapid conquest of the Franche-Comté, shortly before the end of the War of Devolution in February 1668.

==The Dutch War==

In Louis XIV&#x27;s Dutch War of 1672, Turenne accompanied the army commanded by the king which overran the Dutch United Provinces up to the gates of Amsterdam. The terms offered by Louis to the Prince of Orange only aroused a more bitter resistance.

The Dutch opened the dikes and flooded the countryside around Amsterdam. This measure completely checked Turenne, whom the king had left in command. News of this event roused Europe to action, and the conflict spread to Germany. Turenne fought a successful war of manoeuvre on the middle Rhine while Condé covered Alsace.

In January 1673 Turenne assumed the offensive, penetrated far into Germany, and forced the Great Elector of Brandenburg to make peace; later in the year, however, the famous imperial general Montecuccoli completely outmanoeuvred Turenne: Montecuccoli evaded his opponent, joined the Dutch and took the important place of Bonn.

In June 1674, Turenne won the battle of Sinzheim, which made him master of the Electorate of the Palatinate. Under orders from Paris, the French wasted the country far and wide. In the autumn, the anti-French allies again advanced, and though they again outmanoeuvred Turenne, the action of the neutral city of Strasbourg occasioned his failure by permitting the enemy to cross the Rhine by the bridge at that place. The battle of Enzheim followed; this proved a strategic victory for Turenne but hardly affected the situation, and, at the beginning of December, the allies remained in Alsace. The old marshal now made the most daring campaign of his career. A swift and secret march in mid-winter from one end of the Vosges to the other took the allies by surprise. Sharply following up his first successes, Turenne drove the enemy to Turkheim, and there inflicted upon them a heavy defeat (5 January 1675). As revenge for the active resistance the inhabitants of the city had shown, Turenne let his troops loot it and massacre the remaining population for two weeks. In a few weeks he had completely recovered Alsace.

In the summer campaign he once more faced Montecuccoli, and after the highest display of &quot;strategic chess moves&quot; by both commanders, Turenne finally compelled his opponent to offer battle at a disadvantage at Salzbach. There, on 27 July 1675, he was struck by an imperial cannonball while scouting enemy positions and killed instantly. Thomas de Longueville writes: &quot;Twice he opened his eyes, and then he closed them forever.&quot; The news of his death produced universal sorrow.

==Legacy==

Turenne&#x27;s most eloquent countrymen wrote his &quot;éloges&quot;, and Montecuccoli himself exclaimed, &quot;Il est mort aujourd&#x27;hui un homme qui faisait honneur à l&#x27;homme&quot; (A man is dead today who did honour to Man). His body, taken to St Denis, was buried with the Kings of France. Even the revolutionaries of 1793 respected it, and, while they reburied the bodies of the monarchs in a mass grave, they preserved the remains of Turenne at the Jardin des Plantes until 22 September 1800, when Napoleon had them removed to the church of the Invalides at Paris, where they still rest.

Napoleon recommended all soldiers to &quot;read and re-read&quot; the campaigns of Turenne as one of the great captains of history, placing him among Alexander the Great, Hannibal, Frederick the Great, Prince Eugene of Savoy, Gustavus Adolphus, and Julius Caesar. His fame as a general rivalled that of any other in Europe at a period when the populace studied war more critically than ever before, for his military character epitomized the art of war of his time (Prince de Ligne). Strategic caution and logistic accuracy, combined with a brilliant dash in small combats and constancy under all circumstances—of success or failure—perhaps emerge as the salient points of Turenne&#x27;s genius for war. Great battles he avoided. &quot;Few sieges and many combats&quot; he used as his maxim. And, unlike his great rival Condé, who appeared as brilliant in his first battle as in his last, Turenne improved day by day. Napoleon said of him that, his genius grew bolder as it grew older, and a later author, the Duke of Aumale (&quot;Histoire des princes de la maison de Condé&quot;), took the same view when he wrote: &quot;To know him, you must follow him up to Salzbach. In his case, every day signalled some progress”.

In his character Turenne showed little more than the nature of a simple and honourable soldier, endowed with much tact; but in the world of politics he seemed disinterested and out of place, the glittering court of Versailles held no sway in the mind of the great commander. His morals, if not beyond reproach, were at least more austere than those prevalent in the age in which he lived. He operated essentially as a commander of regular armies. He spent his life with the troops; he knew how to win their affection; he tempered a severe discipline with rare generosity, and his men loved him as a comrade no less than they admired him as a commander. Thus, though Condé&#x27;s genius appeared far more versatile, Turenne&#x27;s genius best represents the art of war in the 17th century. For the small, costly, and highly trained regular armies, and the dynastic warfare of the age of Louis XIV, Turenne functioned as the ideal army leader.

During the French Revolution his reputation as a man of the people made his tomb one of the few nobles’ tombs not destroyed by the Revolutionaries. Napoleon rated him the greatest modern commander. Eugene of Savoy when praised above Turenne called the flattery ingratiating at the expense of Turenne. Turenne is one of the subjects of Morris’ work “Great commanders of modern times”. According to him the “powerful genius” of Turenne greatly contributed to shaping modern warfare.

==In fiction==
Marshal of France Turenne is depicted in several alternative history novels written by Eric Flint and David Weber. These include &quot;1633&quot; and &quot;1634: The Baltic War&quot;. Turenne also appears in a historical novel by G.A. Henty called &quot;Won by the Sword&quot;.

<doc id="200842" wikidata="Q1247858" url="?curid=200842" title="Only Fools and Horses">
<text>Only Fools and Horses... is a British television sitcom created and written by John Sullivan. Seven series were originally broadcast on BBC One in the United Kingdom from 1981 to 1991, with sixteen sporadic Christmas specials aired until the end of the show in 2003. Set in working-class Peckham in south-east London, it stars David Jason as ambitious market trader Derek &quot;Del Boy&quot; Trotter and Nicholas Lyndhurst as his younger half-brother Rodney Trotter, alongside a supporting cast. The series follows the Trotters&#x27; highs and lows in life, in particular their attempts to get rich. Critically and popularly acclaimed, the series received numerous awards, including recognition from BAFTA, the National Television Awards, and the Royal Television Society, as well as winning individual accolades for both Sullivan and Jason. It was voted Britain&#x27;s Best Sitcom in a 2004 BBC poll.

Lennard Pearce appeared in the first three series as Del and Rodney&#x27;s elderly grandfather. After Pearce&#x27;s death in 1984, a new character was introduced—Uncle Albert, the boys&#x27; great-uncle, played by Buster Merryfield—to replace Grandad. From 1988, the show featured regular characters in Del Boy&#x27;s and Rodney&#x27;s love interests: Raquel (Tessa Peake-Jones) and Cassandra (Gwyneth Strong), respectively. Other recurring characters included car dealer Boycie (John Challis), road sweeper Trigger (Roger Lloyd-Pack), lorry driver Denzil (Paul Barber), spiv Mickey Pearce (Patrick Murray), Boycie&#x27;s wife Marlene (Sue Holderness), and pub landlord Mike (Kenneth MacDonald).

The show was not an immediate hit with viewers and received little promotion early on, but later achieved consistently high ratings, and the 1996 episode &quot;Time on Our Hands&quot; (originally billed as the last episode) holds the record for the biggest UK audience for a sitcom episode, attracting 24.3 million viewers. The series influenced British culture, contributing several words and phrases to the English language. It spawned an extensive range of merchandise, including books, videos, DVDs, toys and board games. Episodes are frequently repeated on UKTV comedy channel Gold.

A spin-off series, &quot;The Green Green Grass&quot;, ran for four series in the UK from 2005 to 2009. A prequel, &quot;Rock &amp; Chips&quot;, ran for three specials in 2010 and 2011. A special Sport Relief episode aired in March 2014, guest starring David Beckham. In February 2019, a musical adaptation of the show, written by John Sullivan&#x27;s son Jim Sullivan and Paul Whitehouse, was launched at the Theatre Royal Haymarket, London.

== Plot ==
Derek &quot;Del Boy&quot; Trotter (David Jason), a South London &quot;fly&quot; trader, lives in a council flat in Nelson Mandela House, a high-rise tower block in Peckham, South London, with his much younger brother, Rodney (Nicholas Lyndhurst), and their elderly grandfather, Grandad (Lennard Pearce). Their mother, Joan, died when Rodney was young, and their father Reg absconded soon afterwards, so Del became Rodney&#x27;s surrogate father and the family leader. Despite their differences in age, personality and outlook, the brothers share a constant bond throughout.
The Trotters attempt to become millionaires through questionable get-rich-quick schemes and by buying and selling poor-quality and illegal goods. They have a three-wheeled Reliant Regal van and trade under the name of &quot;Trotters Independent Traders&quot;, mainly on the black market.

Initially, Del Boy, Rodney and Grandad were the only regulars, along with the occasional appearances of road sweeper Trigger (Roger Lloyd-Pack) and pretentious used car salesman Boycie (John Challis). Over time, the cast expanded, mostly in the form of regulars at the local pub &quot;The Nag&#x27;s Head&quot;. These included pub landlord Mike Fisher (Kenneth MacDonald), lorry driver Denzil (Paul Barber), youthful spiv Mickey Pearce (Patrick Murray) and Boycie&#x27;s flirtatious wife Marlene (Sue Holderness). After Grandad died following the death of actor Lennard Pearce, his younger brother Uncle Albert (Buster Merryfield) was introduced and moved in with Del and Rodney, becoming a main character.

The plots of many early episodes were primarily self-contained, with few plot-lines mentioned again, but the show developed a story arc and an ongoing episodic dimension in later series. Del and Rodney&#x27;s quest for love is a recurring theme, which eventually resulted in them finding long-term love in the form of Raquel (Tessa Peake-Jones) and Cassandra (Gwyneth Strong), respectively; Del also has a son with Raquel, Damien (played by five actors, most recently Ben Smith), while Rodney has a daughter with Cassandra, Joan (named after his and Del&#x27;s mother), born in the final episode. The Trotters finally become millionaires, lose their fortune, and then regain some of it.

== Cast and characters ==
=== Main cast and characters ===
* Derek Edward &quot;Del Boy&quot; Trotter (David Jason) – Del is a smooth-talking South London market trader, willing to sell anything to anyone to make money. Possessing a quick wit and confidence that his younger brother mostly lacks, Del is devoted to his family, taking care of Rodney and Grandad on his own from the age of 16. Del is also known for his penchant for cultural faux pas, in particular his misuse of French phrases. Del never settled down with a woman until he met Raquel, with whom he had a son, Damien.
:Sullivan recalled that he had always been fascinated by the unlicensed traders who sold goods from suitcases in markets, and he based Del Boy on them. David Jason added other elements to the part, including Del&#x27;s cheap gold jewellery and his camel coat. The inspiration was taken from a similar man he had known when working as an electrician. Jason was a relatively late candidate for the part: Jim Broadbent (who would later appear in a minor recurring role as DCI Roy Slater) and Enn Reitel were earlier preferences. At the time, Broadbent was appearing in Mike Leigh&#x27;s play, &quot;Goose-Pimples&quot;, at the Hampstead Theatre in north London. The play was due to transfer to the West End, and, consequently, Broadbent thought he would be unable to fit in with the filming schedule and turned down the part. It was only when producer Ray Butt saw a repeat of &quot;Open All Hours&quot; that Jason was considered and, despite concerns that Jason had not previously had a leading television role and that he and Lyndhurst did not look like brothers, he was cast.

* Rodney Charlton Trotter (Nicholas Lyndhurst) – Rodney is Del&#x27;s idealistic but socially awkward younger half-brother. Despite being more academically gifted than Del Boy (although only to the extent of two GCEs), Rodney lacks Del&#x27;s charisma as well as the latter&#x27;s duplicitous persona, and as such is confined to being Del&#x27;s dogsbody and sidekick. Orphaned at a young age, Rodney was raised by Del, and much of the friction between the two comes from Rodney&#x27;s annoyance about his dependency on his brother and his sometimes immoral schemes, usually resulting in unsuccessful attempts to gain greater independence through girlfriends or through setting up his own businesses; he was only partially successful after marrying Cassandra and briefly going to work for her father. In contrast to Del, the part of Rodney was cast early, with Lyndhurst settled on quickly. Sullivan partly based Rodney on his own experiences: he, too, had a much older sibling and, like Rodney, claims to have been a dreamer and an idealist in his youth.
* Edward Kitchener &quot;Grandad&quot; Trotter (Lennard Pearce) – Sullivan was fascinated by the idea of having a big age gap between Del Boy and his younger brother Rodney; the elderly character of Grandad, and later, Uncle Albert, gave the situation the voice of an &quot;old man who had seen it all&quot;. In casting the role of Grandad, Sullivan had in mind an actor similar to Wilfrid Brambell, who had played Albert Steptoe in &quot;Steptoe and Son&quot;, but chose not to cast Brambell himself, thinking him too closely associated with &quot;Steptoe&quot;. After seeing Pearce&#x27;s audition, Sullivan chose him immediately. Unkempt and absent-minded, although sometimes displaying a high intelligence, Grandad rarely left the flat or even moved from his armchair in front of two television sets. He was often assigned the job of cooking meals, despite his notoriously poor cooking skills, which Del describes as his &quot;role in the family circle&quot; to ensure he still &quot;feels needed&quot;. Pearce died in 1984 during the filming of the fourth series and Sullivan wrote a new episode, &quot;Strained Relations&quot;, to write Grandad&#x27;s death into the series.
* Albert Gladstone Trotter (Buster Merryfield) – Shortly after the death of Lennard Pearce, it was decided that a new older family member should be brought in, which eventually led to &quot;Uncle Albert&quot;, Grandad&#x27;s estranged younger brother. Merryfield was an inexperienced amateur actor at the time, but was selected because he appeared to fit the description of an old sailor, especially with his distinctive white &quot;Captain Birdseye&quot; beard. Albert first appeared at Grandad&#x27;s funeral and soon moved in with Del and Rodney. His wartime experiences with the Royal Navy became one of the show&#x27;s running gags, usually beginning with the words &quot;During the war...&quot;. Merryfield died in 1999 and Albert&#x27;s death was written into the next episode.
* Raquel Turner (Tessa Peake-Jones) – Raquel was introduced because Sullivan wanted more female characters and for Del to start meeting more mature women. Her first appearance, in &quot;Dates&quot;, was intended to be a one-off, but she was written in again a year later and thereafter became a permanent cast member. A trained singer and actress whose career never took off, she met Del through a dating agency, but they fell out over her part-time job as a stripper, before getting together again. This time, she moved in with Del, helping to calm him, and they had a son together named Damien. As the character developed, it was revealed that she was previously married to Del&#x27;s nemesis, Roy Slater.
* Cassandra Trotter (née Parry) (Gwyneth Strong) – Cassandra first met Rodney in &quot;Yuppy Love&quot;. Their relationship blossomed, and by the end of series six, the two had married. Cassandra&#x27;s career-driven lifestyle caused fights with Rodney, and their marriage problems formed one of the main storylines in the seventh series.

=== Supporting cast and characters ===
* Trigger (Roger Lloyd-Pack) – A dopey and slow-witted but good friend of Del, Trigger was initially portrayed as a small-time thief, supplying Del with dubious goods. In later episodes, he came to adopt the &quot;village idiot&quot; role and constantly calls Rodney &quot;Dave&quot;, much to Rodney&#x27;s annoyance. Trigger, apparently so called because he looks like a horse, was the principal supporting character earlier in the show&#x27;s run, although his importance lessened as the series progressed. Lloyd-Pack was cast by pure chance: Ray Butt, who hired him to portray Trigger after seeing him in a stage play, had only attended that play to observe potential Del Boy actor Billy Murray.
* Boycie (John Challis) – An untrustworthy used car salesman and a cultural elitist. Boycie, a freemason, was very selfish and prone to boasting about his wealth. Challis had played a similar character in an episode of &quot;Citizen Smith&quot;. Sullivan liked him, and promised to cast him in a future series, which led to Boycie. Boycie later featured in a spin-off series, &quot;The Green Green Grass&quot;, starting in 2005, in which he and his wife Marlene along with their son Tyler escaped from a criminal gang.
* Denzil Tulser (Paul Barber) – An affable Liverpudlian lorry driver, Denzil was often the victim of Del&#x27;s scams. His inability to say no to Del&#x27;s business deals frequently led to arguments with his controlling wife, Corinne (Eva Mottley). Corinne eventually walked out on him, leaving Denzil depressed but with more time to go along with Del&#x27;s antics.
* Sid (Roy Heather) – Sid made sparse appearances throughout the show&#x27;s run, mainly as the proprietor of the dirty and unhygienic local cafe. In the episode &quot;The Jolly Boys&#x27; Outing&quot;, it is revealed that Sid fought in the Second World War. He was captured and imprisoned but escaped, only for the boat he was using to be hit and sunk by a Greek fishing trawler being steered by Uncle Albert. After &quot;Nag&#x27;s Head&quot; landlord Mike was imprisoned, Sid took over and kept that role for the remainder of the series.
* Mickey Pearce (Patrick Murray) – Mickey was a young, arrogant spiv and friend of Rodney&#x27;s, known for his exaggerated boasts about his success in business or with women. Despite their friendship, Mickey often took advantage of Rodney&#x27;s inexperience by stealing his girlfriends or making off with all the money from their business partnership.
* Marlene Boyce (Sue Holderness) – Boycie&#x27;s wife. Initially just an unseen character, Marlene was popular among the men and extremely flirtatious, having had implied sexual relations with all of Boycie&#x27;s friends. She and Del have a noticeably close friendship, dating back to when Marlene worked in a betting shop in Lewisham Grove. Despite their constant arguments and insults, she and Boycie are in love and eventually have a child, Tyler, after several years of trying although there are light-hearted rumours that Del may be the father.
* Mike Fisher (Kenneth MacDonald) – The landlord of the &quot;Nag&#x27;s Head&quot;, although not from the very beginning; his predecessor was never seen, with just a succession of barmaids providing service. Friendly and gormless, he was often targeted by Del as a potential customer for any goods he was selling. When Kenneth MacDonald died in 2001, a storyline involving Mike&#x27;s imprisonment for attempting to embezzle the brewery was written, and cafe owner Sid took over as the interim pub landlord.
* Damien Trotter (various) – Damien was Del and Raquel&#x27;s son. It was Rodney&#x27;s mocking suggestion that he be named Damien. Uncle Albert raised concern that Damien&#x27;s initials would read &quot;DDT&quot;, as his full name is &quot;Damien Derek Trotter&quot;, &quot;DDT&quot; being short for the chemical compound Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane DDT. Six actors played Damien: Patrick McManus (1991), Grant Stevens (1991), Robert Liddement (1992), Jamie Smith (1993–96), Douglas Hodge (1996, as adult) and Ben Smith (2001–03).

=== Minor cast and characters ===

The most frequent roles for guest actors in &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot; were as Del or Rodney&#x27;s one-time girlfriends, barmaids at the &quot;Nag&#x27;s Head&quot;, or individuals the Trotters were doing business with. Del and Rodney&#x27;s deceased mother, Joan, though never seen, was frequently mentioned in Del&#x27;s embellished accounts of her final words or in his attempts to emotionally blackmail Rodney. Her grave, a flamboyant monument, was seen occasionally. Their absent father, Reg, appeared once in &quot;Thicker Than Water&quot; (played by Peter Woodthorpe), before leaving under a cloud, never to be seen again. Other members of the Trotter family were rarely sighted, the exceptions being cousins Stan (Mike Kemp) and Jean (Maureen Sweeney), who attended Grandad&#x27;s funeral. In &quot;The Second Time Around&quot;, the woman they believed to be Auntie Rose (Beryl Cooke) turned out to be no relation at all but the woman who had moved into Rose&#x27;s house some years earlier. After Rodney met Cassandra, her parents Alan (Denis Lill) and Pam (Wanda Ventham) became recurring characters. Raquel&#x27;s parents, James and Audrey (Michael Jayston and Ann Lynn), appeared in &quot;Time On Our Hands&quot;, and it was James who discovered the antique watch which made the Trotters millionaires.

In some episodes, a guest character was essential to the plot. Del&#x27;s ex-fiancée Pauline (Jill Baker) dominated Del&#x27;s libido in &quot;The Second Time Around&quot;, prompting Rodney and Grandad to leave. In &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire&quot;, Del&#x27;s old business partner Jumbo Mills (Nick Stringer) wanted Del to return to Australia with him and restore their partnership, forcing Del to make a decision. In &quot;Happy Returns&quot;, Del stops a young boy from running into the road and takes him home to his mother to discover she is an old flame from nineteen years ago, June Snell (Diane Langton) and the episode revolves around whether her daughter Debby (Oona Kirsch) is actually Del&#x27;s child, complicated by the fact that Rodney is dating her. June also appears in &quot;A Royal Flush&quot;, attending an opera. An attempt by Lennox (Vas Blackwood) to rob a local supermarket set up the &quot;hostage&quot; situation in &quot;The Longest Night&quot;. Del and Rodney spent the whole of &quot;Tea for Three&quot; battling each other for the affections of Trigger&#x27;s niece Lisa (Gerry Cowper), who briefly reappeared in &quot;The Frog&#x27;s Legacy&quot;. Abdul (Tony Anholt) in &quot;To Hull and Back&quot; and Arnie (Philip McGough) in &quot;Chain Gang&quot; were responsible for setting up dubious enterprises involving the Trotters in their respective episodes. Tony Angelino (Philip Pope), the &quot;singing dustman&quot; with a speech impediment, was the key to the humour and the storyline of &quot;Stage Fright&quot; and &quot;EastEnders&quot; actor Derek Martin guest starred in &quot;Fatal Extraction&quot;.

Del&#x27;s nemesis from his school days, corrupt policeman Roy Slater (played by Jim Broadbent), made three appearances, in &quot;May The Force Be With You&quot;, &quot;To Hull and Back&quot; and &quot;Class of &#x27;62&quot;. Feared local villains, Danny and Tony Driscoll (Roy Marsden and Christopher Ryan, respectively) featured once, in &quot;Little Problems&quot;, but were mentioned in two previous episodes (&quot;Video Nasty&quot; and &quot;The Frog&#x27;s Legacy&quot;), and are important in the story of &quot;The Green Green Grass&quot;. An adult Damien (Douglas Hodge) appeared in &quot;Heroes and Villains&quot;. Rodney and Mickey&#x27;s friends, the smooth-talking Jevon (Steven Woodcock) and then, briefly, Chris (Tony Marshall), a ladies&#x27; hairdresser, featured sporadically during the sixth and seventh series and the intervening Christmas specials. The two-part 1991 Christmas special, &quot;Miami Twice&quot;, saw Richard Branson and Barry Gibb make cameo appearances. Mike Read appeared as himself, hosting an episode of &quot;Top Of The Pops&quot;, in &quot;It&#x27;s Only Rock and Roll&quot; and Jonathan Ross appeared as himself in &quot;If They Could See Us Now&quot;.

While their characters were less significant, well-known actors who played cameos in the programme included Joan Sims, best known for her numerous roles in the &quot;Carry On&quot; films, who guest-starred in the feature-length episode &quot;The Frog&#x27;s Legacy&quot; as Reenie Turpin, an aunt of Trigger and old friend of Del&#x27;s late mother; successful film actor David Thewlis, who played a young wannabe musician in &quot;It&#x27;s Only Rock and Roll&quot;; John Bardon, who played the role of Jim Branning in the soap opera &quot;EastEnders&quot;, appeared as the supermarket security officer Tom Clark in &quot;The Longest Night&quot;. Walter Sparrow, who appeared as Dirty Barry in &quot;Danger UXD&quot;, went on to appear in several Hollywood films.

== Production ==
=== Development ===

In 1980, John Sullivan, a scriptwriter under contract at the BBC, was already well known as the writer of the sitcom &quot;Citizen Smith&quot;. It came to an end that year and Sullivan was searching for a new project. An initial idea for a comedy set in the world of football was rejected by the BBC, as was his alternative idea, a sitcom centring on a cockney market trader in working class, modern-day London. The latter idea persisted. Through Ray Butt, a BBC producer and director whom Sullivan had met and become friends with when they were working on &quot;Citizen Smith&quot;, a draft script was shown to the BBC&#x27;s Head of Comedy, John Howard Davies. Davies commissioned Sullivan to write a full series. Sullivan believed the key factor in its being accepted was the success of ITV&#x27;s new drama, &quot;Minder&quot;, a series with a similar premise and also set in modern-day London.

Sullivan had initially given the show the working title &quot;Readies&quot;. For the actual title he intended to use, as a reference to the protagonist&#x27;s tax- and work-evading lifestyle, &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot;. That name was based on a genuine, though very obscure, saying, &quot; for a living&quot;, which had its origins in 19th-century American vaudeville. &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot; had also been the title of an episode of &quot;Citizen Smith&quot;, and Sullivan liked the expression and thought it was suited to the new sitcom. He also thought longer titles would attract attention. He was first overruled on the grounds that the audience would not understand the title, but he eventually got his way.

=== Filming and transmission ===

Filming of the first series began in May 1981, and the first episode, &quot;Big Brother&quot;, was transmitted on BBC1 at 8:30 pm on 8 September that year. It attracted 9.2 million viewers and generally received a lukewarm response from critics. The viewing figures for the whole first series averaged at around 7 million viewers. According to an interview with John Challis in 2015, the viewing figure &quot;today would be very good but in those days wasn&#x27;t considered great at all, so it was sort of put on the back burner for a bit—no particular plans for a second series&quot;. The costumes for the first series were designed by Phoebe De Gaye. Del&#x27;s attire was inspired by her going to car boot sales. She took Jason shopping in Oxford Street and had him try a variety of suits. De Gaye purchased some gaily coloured Gabicci shirts, which were fashionable at the time and she thought &quot;horrible&quot;. Del&#x27;s rings and bracelet were made of fake gold and came from Chapel Market. Rodney&#x27;s combat jacket came from the BBC&#x27;s Costume Department, and De Gaye added a Yasser Arafat scarf purchased from Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Market. De Gaye used Vaseline, make-up and food to make Grandad&#x27;s costume look dirty. The idea was that he never had his hat off, never dressed properly and usually wore dirty pyjamas underneath his clothes.

A second series was commissioned for 1982. This fared a bit better, and the first and second series had a collective repeat run in June 1983 in a more low-key time slot, but attracted a high enough viewing figure for Davies to commission a third series. From there, the show began to top the television ratings. Viewing figures for the fourth series were double those of the first. In early December 1984, during the filming of Series 4, Lennard Pearce suffered a heart attack and was taken to hospital. He died on 15 December, the day before he was due to return. Sullivan wrote Grandad&#x27;s death into the series with the episode &quot;Strained Relations&quot; which featured Del and Rodney&#x27;s goodbye to Grandad. According to Sullivan, recasting Grandad was considered disrespectful to Pearce by the team, so it was decided that another older family member was to be cast. Buster Merryfield was then cast as Grandad&#x27;s brother Albert. The scenes from &quot;Hole in One&quot; that featured Pearce were re-filmed with Merryfield.

Midway through the filming of the fifth series, Jason told Sullivan that he wished to leave the show in order to further his career elsewhere. Sullivan thus wrote &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot;, which was intended to be the final episode and would see Del accepting a friend&#x27;s offer to set up business in Australia, leaving Rodney and Albert behind. Plans were made for a spin-off entitled &quot;Hot-Rod&quot;, which would have followed Rodney&#x27;s attempts to survive on his own with help from Mickey Pearce but leaving open the prospect of Del&#x27;s return. Jason then changed his mind, and the ending of the episode was changed to show Del rejecting the offer.

Sullivan had a tendency to write scripts that were too long, leading to material being cut. Shortly before filming of the sixth series began, he and Jason requested that the show&#x27;s time slot be extended and it was agreed to extend its running time to 50 minutes. This required a 40 per cent increase in the show&#x27;s budget, and coincided with the show becoming one of the BBC&#x27;s most popular programmes. Robin Stubbs became the costume designer for the sixth series and was responsible for getting Del&#x27;s attire to match his new yuppy image. His new suits cost around £200 each and were purchased from Austin Reed in Regent Street. The rest came from stores such as Tie-Rack and Dickins &amp; Jones. His jewellery was replaced in each series because it was very cheap (the &quot;D&quot; rings cost 50p each).

The seventh series aired in early 1991. Jason and Sullivan were involved with other projects, and it was confirmed that there were no plans for a new series. Despite this, the show continued in Christmas specials until 1993. Sullivan nonetheless wanted a final episode to tie up the show. In late 1996, three more one-hour episodes were filmed, to be broadcast over Christmas 1996. All three were well received and, due to the ending, were assumed to be the last. The show made a return in Christmas 2001 with the first of three new episodes which were shot together but ultimately broadcast over three consecutive Christmases from 2001 until 2003. Despite rumours of further episodes, in a 2008 interview, Sullivan was quoted as saying: &quot;There will not be another series of &quot;Only Fools And Horses&quot;. I can say that. We had our day, it was wonderful but it is best to leave it now&quot;. Though Sullivan died in 2011, it returned for a special Sport Relief episode in 2014.

=== Theme music and titles ===

From the second series, &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot; has separate theme songs for the opening and closing credits: &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot; and &quot;Hooky Street&quot;, respectively. The series 1 theme tune was produced by Ronnie Hazlehurst and recorded on 6 August 1981 at Lime Grove Studios. Alf Bigden, Paul Westwood, Don Hunt, John Dean, Judd Proctor, Eddie Mordue and Rex Morris were hired to play the music. The tune was changed after the first series, and the new one was written by John Sullivan (he disliked the tune for the first series, and his new one explained the show&#x27;s title), and Hazlehurst conducted it. It was recorded at Lime Grove on 11 May 1982, with musicians John Horler, Dave Richmond, Bigden and Proctor. Sullivan had intended Chas &amp; Dave to sing it because they had enjoyed success with the &quot;Rockney&quot; style, a mixture of rock n&#x27; roll and traditional Cockney music. Sullivan was persuaded to do it himself by Ray Butt. Despite the creation of a new theme tune, the original one remained in occasional use. Chas &amp; Dave did later contribute to the show, performing the closing credits song for the 1989 episode &quot;The Jolly Boys&#x27; Outing&quot;. Both songs are performed by Sullivan himself, and not—as is sometimes thought—by Nicholas Lyndhurst.

The opening credits see images of the three principal actors peel on and off the screen sequentially. These appear over a background of still photographs of everyday life in London. The sequence was conceived by graphic designer Peter Clayton as a &quot;metaphor for the vagaries of the Trotters&#x27; lifestyle&quot;, whereby money was earned and quickly lost again. Clayton had also considered using five-pound notes bearing Del&#x27;s face. The action was shot manually frame by frame and took around six weeks to complete. Clayton knew that it was important to have the characters established in the titles and prepared a storyboard depicting his ideas using drawings. He photographed various locations with a photographer, and the titles were shot using a rostrum camera and not edited. Brian Stephens, a professional animator, was hired to create the labels&#x27; movement.

Clayton returned to the show when the closing credits were changed for &quot;Christmas Crackers&quot;. He re-cut the entire sequence and added Christmas items. Another change was made necessary by Lennard Pearce&#x27;s death and Buster Merryfield joining the cast, so the pictures of David Jason and Nicholas Lyndhurst were updated too. The sequence was shot on motor drive.

The closing credits for the programme varied series by series. The first series used peeling labels featuring the names of the cast and crew, mirroring the opening sequence, but these had to be updated with every new episode, making the process very time-consuming; from the second series, the credits switched to a standard rolling format. The third series featured additional symbols. For the fourth series, these designs were replaced with white lettering on a black background. The fifth series had a black and white background, but the sixth series reverted to the black one. For the seventh series, the credits scrolled against a freeze frame of the final scene.

=== Filming locations ===
The original &quot;Nelson Mandela House&quot; in the titles was Harlech Tower, Park Road East, Acton, London. From 1988 onwards, Whitemead House, Duckmoor Road, Ashton in Bristol was used. The tower block is located behind Ashton Gate, the home ground of both Bristol City Football Club and the Bristol Bears, with some scenes filmed in the stadium&#x27;s car park.

== Episodes ==

Sixty-four episodes of &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot;, all written by John Sullivan, were broadcast on BBC1 from 8 September 1981 until 25 December 2003. The show was aired in seven series (1981–1983, 1985–1986, 1989 and 1990–1991), and thereafter in sporadic Christmas special editions (1991–1993, 1996, 2001–2003). The episodes from the first five series (excluding Christmas specials) had a running time of 30 minutes, but from series 6 (1989), the running time of the series episodes was extended to 50 minutes.

Several mini-episodes were produced. An eight-minute episode aired on 27 December 1982 as part of a show hosted by Frank Muir, &quot;The Funny Side of Christmas&quot;, and attracted 7.2 million viewers. A five-minute spoof BBC documentary was shown on &quot;Breakfast Time&quot; on 24 December 1985, with Del being investigated by a BBC consumer expert. An educational episode named &quot;Licensed to Drill&quot;, in which Del, Rodney and Grandad discuss oil drilling, was recorded in 1984 but only shown in schools. A five-minute 1990–91 Persian Gulf War special (dated 1 December 1990) has Del, Rodney and Albert convey a message to British troops serving in the conflict. It has never been broadcast commercially, but a copy exists at the Imperial War Museum, London. A Comic Relief special showing Del, Rodney and Albert making an appeal for donations was shown on 14 March 1997, with 10.6 million viewers. A Sport Relief special was aired on 21 March 2014 which featured retired footballer David Beckham.

&quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot; had two producers: Ray Butt from 1981 to 1987, and Gareth Gwenlan thereafter. Seven directors were used: Martin Shardlow directed all episodes in series one, Bernard Thompson directed the 1981 Christmas special, Susan Belbin series four, and Mandie Fletcher series five. Butt directed series three and five, as well as the 1985, 1986 and 1987 Christmas specials. Tony Dow became the established director after 1988, directing all subsequent episodes, bar the first part of Miami Twice, which was directed by Gareth Gwenlan. John Sullivan was executive producer on seven of the final eight episodes.

=== Documentaries ===
A BBC documentary titled &quot;The Story of Only Fools and Horses&quot; aired in December 2002. A six-part documentary series also titled &quot;The Story of Only Fools and Horses&quot;, began on 29 August 2017 on Gold and finished on 3 October 2017. The series features rare and unseen footage from the archives and specially re-created moments from Del Boy&#x27;s family and friends. On 27 December 2020, a special called &quot;We Love Only Fools and Horses&quot; was broadcast on Channel 5 in which various fans, actors and crew recalled the story of the series and why the show is still popular.
First broadcast on 24 December 2023 and repeated on 11 December 2024, Channel 5 aired the 2023 Studio Crook Production &quot;Only Fools and Horses: Greatest Christmas Moments&quot; in which the cast and fans share their favourite scenes from the Christmas specials.

== Spin-offs ==
=== &quot;The Green Green Grass&quot; ===
A spin-off of &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot; entitled&quot; The Green Green Grass&quot;, also written by John Sullivan and directed by Tony Dow, was first aired in the UK in September 2005. Sullivan had considered writing a sitcom around the popular characters of Boycie and Marlene (John Challis and Sue Holderness) since the mid-1980s, but it was not until &quot;Only Fools And Horses&quot; ended that the idea came to fruition. &quot;The Green Green Grass&quot; saw Boycie and Marlene forced to leave Peckham by one-time &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot; villains, the Driscoll Brothers, and included guest appearances by Denzil (Paul Barber) and Sid (Roy Heather). A second series of &quot;The Green Green Grass&quot; was broadcast in the UK in October 2006, a third in November 2007 and a fourth in January 2009.

=== &quot;Rock &amp; Chips&quot; ===
In 2003, it was reported that Sullivan was developing a prequel to the original series, &quot;Once Upon a Time in Peckham&quot;, which would feature Del as a youngster in the 1960s and have a prominent role for his parents. In 2009, it was again reported that the BBC were considering commissioning the show, although nothing was confirmed. On 5 April 2009, Sullivan said that he was planning a prequel to &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot; which would star Nicholas Lyndhurst as Freddie &quot;The Frog&quot; Robdal, a local criminal and Rodney&#x27;s biological father; Robdal was the focus of the episode &quot;The Frog&#x27;s Legacy&quot;.

On 3 July 2009, the BBC revealed that the title of the spin-off would be &quot;Sex, Drugs &amp; Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Chips&quot;, and would be a 90-minute comedy drama. The title was subsequently changed to &quot;Rock &amp; Chips&quot;. Filming began in August 2009, and it was shown on BBC One at 9pm on 24 January 2010. In October 2009 it was confirmed that Lyndhurst would star as Robdal. &quot;The Inbetweeners&quot; and &quot;Off The Hook&quot; actor James Buckley played the role of the young Del Boy.

== Home media ==
The show has been released on VHS, DVD and audio CD in several guises. A DVD collection containing every episode was issued, along with various other special-edition box sets, such as a tin based on their Reliant Regal. Videos and DVDs of &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot; continue to be among the BBC&#x27;s biggest-selling items, having sold over 1 million VHS copies and 6 million DVD copies in the UK.

The series made its debut on Blu-ray on 6 December 2021, with a three-disc set entitled &quot;Only Fools and Horses: The 80s Specials.&quot; It featured the five feature-length Christmas specials broadcast from 1985 to 1989, restored and remastered in high-definition. For the restoration process, the original 16 mm film elements were cleaned and rescanned, while the standard-definition videotape elements were &quot;digitally reprocessed&quot; and upscaled to HD. On the set, the episode &quot;A Royal Flush&quot; is featured both in its original and &quot;writer&#x27;s cut&quot; versions; &quot;The Jolly Boys&#x27; Outing&quot; is fully uncut; and various photo galleries, a booklet and artcards are also included.
It entered and peaked at #10 on the UK Official Blu-ray Chart the week ending 18 December 2021.

All seven series and the Christmas specials have been released on DVD in both individual and complete sets. The first three series each contained their Christmas specials from 1981, 1982 and 1983. The specials were omitted from all subsequent series sets but were instead released separately and not in chronological order. In addition, the documentary &quot;The Story of Only Fools and Horses&quot; was released in 2003.

== In other media ==
=== Audio releases ===
A number of episodes were re-edited for audio purposes and released on either audio cassette or CD. In total, there were five CDs released, with the first one being released on both CD and cassette.

An album was released in 2002. &quot;Only Fools and Horses: The Album&quot; featured songs used in the show, as well as John Sullivan performing the theme tune and Hookie Street. Apart from the physical CD release, the album has never been available digitally, meaning that the theme tune has never appeared on streaming or download services as of 2023. A single was released to support the album, which sampled the show&#x27;s theme tune, titled &quot;Delboy&#x27;s Tune&quot;. The music video features John Challis as Boycie and Patrick Murray as Mickey Pearce.

Before Euro 2004, an unofficial England song was released by Undercover. The track, titled &quot;Viva England!&quot;, sampled both the opening theme from Only Fools and Horses and Hookie Street—used with John Sullivan&#x27;s blessing—and reached number 49 in the charts.

=== Theatre ===
A four-minute show named &quot;Royal Variety Performance&quot; was shown on 27 November 1988 (viewed by 18.14 million people) and had Del, Rodney, and Albert appear on the Royal Variety Show. It was staged on 24 November 1986, and the plot saw David Jason, Nicholas Lyndhurst and Buster Merryfield appear on stage in character, thinking that they are delivering boxes of alcohol to an associate of Del&#x27;s, only later realising where they actually are. They also mistake the Duchess of York for Del&#x27;s associate.

An idea of an &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot; stage show was mooted by Ray Butt, following the success of other sitcom crossovers such as &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot; and &quot;Are You Being Served?&quot;. Sullivan was not keen, owing to his work on &quot;Just Good Friends&quot; as well as &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot;, and inexperience with the theatre, so nothing came of it.

==== Stage musical ====
In July 2018, John Sullivan&#x27;s son, Jim Sullivan, announced that an &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot; musical was nearing completion, with a script by Jim Sullivan and Paul Whitehouse. Jim Sullivan said, &quot;Back in 2010 my Dad had been toying with the possibility of a stage show but sadly didn&#x27;t get the chance to commit to it. In 2015 we met with the producer, Phil McIntyre, and agreed to develop the idea. Soon after that, Paul Whitehouse came on board and things have been bubbling away ever since. I am very pleased and excited to say that the show will be launching early next year.&quot; The musical launched on 9 February 2019 at the Theatre Royal Haymarket, London.

=== Books ===
&quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot; spawned many merchandising spin-offs. Several books have been published, such as &quot;The Only Fools and Horses Story&quot; by Steve Clark and &quot;The Complete A-Z of Only Fools and Horses&quot; by Richard Webber, both of which detail the history of the series. The scripts have been published in a three-volume compendium, &quot;The Bible of Peckham&quot;.

In October 2015, &quot;He Who Dares...&quot;, a fictional autobiography, was published by Ebury Press. The book was written by John Sullivan&#x27;s son, Jim Sullivan.

In August 2017, &quot;Only Fools and Horses: The Peckham Archives&quot;, was published by Ebury Press. The book was written by Rod Green, with the help of Jim Sullivan.

In November 2018, &quot;You Know It Makes Sense, Lessons From The Derek Trotter School of Business (And Life)&quot;, was published by Ebury Press. The book was written by John Sullivan&#x27;s son, Jim Sullivan.

=== Board games ===
Two board games based on the show were released: a Monopoly-style game, the &quot;Trotters Trading Game&quot;, in which participants attempt to emulate the Trotters and become millionaires, and another game set in their local pub, entitled the &quot;Nag&#x27;s Head Board Game&quot;.

=== Games/apps ===
A CD-ROM was released in August 2000 by BBC Multimedia. It featured a calendar, a calculator, a pub quiz, numerous clips from the show and a driving game.

An app was released for mobile phones in 2010. &quot;The Only Fools &amp; Horses Plonker Test&quot; app included a quiz, mini-games and audio clips from the show. It has since been discontinued.

== Reception ==

&quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot; is one of the UK&#x27;s most popular sitcoms. It was among the ten most-watched television shows of the year in the UK in 1986, 1989, 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1996, 2001, 2002 and 2003. The 1996 Christmas trilogy of &quot;Heroes and Villains&quot;, &quot;Modern Men&quot; and &quot;Time on Our Hands&quot; saw the show&#x27;s peak. Twenty-one-point-three million viewers watched the first two installments while the third (said to be the show&#x27;s final episode at the time of broadcast) attracted 24.3 million, a record audience for a British sitcom. Repeat episodes also attract millions of viewers, and the BBC has received criticism for repeating the show too often.

&quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot; won the BAFTA award for best comedy series in 1985, 1988 and 1996, was nominated in 1983, 1986, 1989, 1990 and 1991, and won the audience award in 2004. David Jason received individual BAFTAs for his portrayal of Del Boy in 1990 and 1996. The series won a National Television Award in 1997 for most popular comedy series; Jason won two individual awards, in 1997 and 2002. At the British Comedy Awards, the show was named best BBC sitcom for 1990, and received the People&#x27;s Choice award in 1997. It also won the Royal Television Society best comedy award in 1997 and two Television and Radio Industries Club Awards for comedy programme of the year, in 1984 and 1997. John Sullivan received the Writers&#x27; Guild of Great Britain comedy award in 1997.

The show regularly features in polls to find the most popular comedy series, moments and characters. It was voted Britain&#x27;s best sitcom in a 2004 BBC poll, and came 45th in the British Film Institute&#x27;s list of the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes. It was third on a subsequent viewers&#x27; poll on the BFI website. &quot;Empire&quot; magazine ranked &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot; #42 on their list of the 50 greatest television shows of all time. It was also named the funniest British sitcom of all time through a scientific formula, in a study by Gold. Scenes such as Del Boy&#x27;s fall through a bar flap in &quot;Yuppy Love&quot; and the Trotters accidentally smashing a priceless chandelier in &quot;A Touch of Glass&quot; are recognisable comedy moments, invariably topping polls of comedy viewers. Del Boy was voted the most popular British TV character of all time in a survey by Open... and in a 2001 Channel 4 poll he ranked fourth on their list of the 100 Greatest TV Characters. A Onepoll survey found that &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot; was the television series Britons would most like to see return.

=== Ratings ===
== Cultural impact ==
In addition to its mainstream popularity, &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot; has developed a cult following. The Only Fools and Horses Appreciation Society, established in 1993, has a membership of around 7,000, published 45 issues of a quarterly newsletter, &quot;Hookie Street&quot;, and organises annual conventions of fans, often attended by cast members. The Society has also organised an &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot; museum, containing props from the series, including Del&#x27;s camel coat and the Trotters&#x27; Ford Capri. It was named one of the top 20 cult television programmes of all time by TV critic Jeff Evans. Evans spoke of:

&quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot;—and consequently John Sullivan—is credited with the popularisation in Britain of several words and phrases used by Del Boy, particularly &quot;Plonker&quot;, meaning a fool or an idiot, and two expressions of delight or approval: &quot;Cushty&quot; (from the Roma word for &quot;good&quot;) and &quot;Lovely jubbly&quot;. The latter was borrowed from an advertising slogan for a popular 1960s orange juice drink, called &quot;Jubbly&quot;, which was packaged in a pyramid-shaped, waxed-paper carton. Sullivan remembered it and thought it was an expression Del Boy would use; in 2003, the phrase was incorporated into the new Oxford English Dictionary.

Owing to its exposure on &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot;, the Reliant Regal van is often linked with the show in the British media. The one used by the Trotters has attained cult status and is currently on display at the Cars of the Stars exhibition at the National Motor Museum, alongside many other vehicles from British and American television and movies, such as the Batmobile and the DeLorean from &quot;Back to the Future&quot;. Boxer Ricky Hatton, a fan of the show, purchased one of the original vans in 2004. Another of the vans used in the series was sold at auction in the UK for £44,000 in February 2007.

During the media frenzy surrounding &quot;The Independent&quot;″s revelations that the new bottled water Dasani, marketed by Coca-Cola, was in fact just purified tap water from Sidcup, mocking parallels were made with the &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot; episode, &quot;Mother Nature&#x27;s Son&quot;, in which Del sells tap water as &quot;Peckham Spring&quot;.

Rose Tyler&#x27;s father Pete Tyler is referred to as &quot;a bit of a Del Boy&quot; in the 2005 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episode &quot;Father&#x27;s Day&quot;.

In the closing ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics, the Trotters&#x27; yellow Reliant van appeared on stage, along with Del Boy and Rodney body doubles dressed as Batman and Robin, a reference to the &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot; episode &quot;Heroes and Villains&quot;.

== International remakes ==
&quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot; was sold to countries throughout the world. Australia, Belgium, Cyprus, Greece, Ireland, Israel, Malta, New Zealand, Pakistan, Portugal, South Africa, Spain and Yugoslavia are among those who purchased it. In all former Yugoslav countries in which Serbian or Croatian is spoken the title was &quot;Mućke&quot; (or Мућке in Cyrillic script), which can roughly be translated as &quot;shady deals&quot;. This translation was also used in Macedonia, where the show was titled &quot;Spletki&quot; (Сплетки in Cyrillic). In Slovenia, however, the show was titled &quot;Samo bedaki in konji&quot;, which is a literal Slovenian translation of the original English title. The show has enjoyed particular popularity in Serbia and Croatia where it has achieved cult status. In Hungary, the first three series were on air on Danube TV channel with title: Csak kötözött bolondoknak.

A number of overseas re-makes have also been produced. A Dutch version aired for one series in 1995, entitled &quot;Wat schuift &#x27;t?&quot; (&quot;What&#x27;s it good for?&quot;). The Trotters were renamed the Aarsmans and it starred Johnny Kraaykamp jnr. as Stef (Del), Sacco Van der Made as Grandad and Kasper van Kooten as Robbie (Rodney), and was shown on RTL 4. A Portuguese re-make, &quot;O Fura-Vidas&quot;, a local expression for someone who lives outside the law, ran for three series from 1999 to 2001. It was a literal translation of the British version, with all episodes based on the originals. It centred on the Fintas family, who live in Sapadores, a neighbourhood in Lisbon, and starred Miguel Guilherme as Quim (Del), Canto e Castro as Grandad, and Ivo Canelas as Joca (Rodney). In this Portuguese version the Reliant&#x27;s equivalent was a 1988 Suzuki Super Carry. A Slovenian re-make, called &quot;Brat bratu&quot; (Brother to Brother), was broadcast from 2008 to 2009. All episodes were based on the original British storylines, and it was made in co-operation with John Sullivan. It featured brothers Brane (Brane Šturbej) and Bine (Jure Drevenšek), who moved from Maribor to Ljubljana. The series also stars Peter Ternovšek as Grandad. It was directed by Branko Đurić. The series was cancelled after thirteen episodes due to poor ratings.

There have been several plans to produce an American version. One was to be a star vehicle for former &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; actor Harry Morgan, with Grandad rather than Del becoming the lead character. The other, entitled &quot;This Time Next Year...&quot;, would have seen the Trotters renamed the Flannagans. A draft script was written for the latter, but neither show materialised. In 2010, Steve Carell, star of the American version of &quot;The Office&quot;, expressed an interest in making an American version of the series, with him to star as Del Boy. In January 2012 US network ABC commissioned a pilot of an &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot; remake titled &quot;King of Van Nuys&quot;, written by &quot;Scrubs&quot; writers Steven Cragg and Brian Bradley. It was developed, rejected and then redeveloped, only to be rejected again later in the year. The pilot starred John Leguizamo as Del, Dustin Ybarra as his brother Rodney and Christopher Lloyd as Grandad. The unreleased pilot was released onto YouTube in August 2023.

A parody of American adaptations of British shows called &quot;Only Jerks and Horses&quot; was written by David Walliams and Matt Lucas and directed by Edgar Wright in 1997.

<doc id="200852" wikidata="Q6691428" url="?curid=200852" title="Love Thy Neighbour (1972 TV series)">
<text>Love Thy Neighbour is a British television sitcom that was broadcast from 13 April 1972 until 22 January 1976. The show spanned eight series, lasted for 53 episodes (plus an unaired pilot) and was produced by Thames Television for the ITV network.

The principal cast consists of Jack Smethurst, Rudolph Walker, Nina Baden-Semper, and Kate Williams. In 1973, the series was adapted into a film of the same name, and a later sequel series was set in Australia.

==Synopsis==
The series was created and largely written by Vince Powell and Harry Driver; it was based around a white working class couple (Eddie and Joan Booth) living in Twickenham, in the outer London suburbs, and a black couple (Bill and Barbie Reynolds) as their next-door neighbours. One of the leads, Rudolph Walker, who played Bill Reynolds, wrote in an article for &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2001 that the show is about &quot;a black guy and a white guy being damned stupid&quot;.

==Cast and characters==
* Eddie Booth (Jack Smethurst) is a white socialist. His world is turned upside down when Bill and Barbie Reynolds, who are black, move in next door. Eddie is even more annoyed when Bill gets a job at the same factory as him, and refers to him as a &quot;nig-nog&quot;, &quot;Sambo&quot;, &quot;choc-ice&quot; and &quot;King Kong&quot; among other things. He also has a tendency to call Chinese, Pakistanis or Indians names like &quot;Fu Manchu&quot;, &quot;Gunga Din&quot; and &quot;Ali Baba&quot;. He repeatedly insinuates that all blacks (and Bill in particular) are cannibals, and claims that &quot;white always takes precedence over black&quot;. He is temporarily promoted to foreman in the episode &quot;Clarky Leaves&quot;, but ends up being demoted after Bill complains he is running the factory like a forced labour camp; afterward, Bill gets the foreman&#x27;s job. Eddie is a supporter of Manchester United. Notwithstanding his seeming contempt for Bill, the reality is that they drink together and are friends. Eddie&#x27;s catchphrases include &quot;Bloody Nora!&quot;, &quot;Knickers!&quot;, &quot;The subject is closed&quot;, &quot;You bloody nig-nog!&quot; and &quot;Get knotted!&quot;
* Joan Booth (Kate Williams) is Eddie&#x27;s wife. She does not share her bigoted husband&#x27;s opinion of their black neighbours and is good friends with Barbie. She often responds to Eddie&#x27;s complaints with a sarcastic remark. Her catchphrases include &quot;Don&#x27;t be ridiculous!&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t talk rubbish!&quot;, and &quot;May God forgive ya&quot;, which she normally says in response to Eddie denying his bigoted ways. She and Barbie both become pregnant at the end of Series 3; Joan later gives birth to a son, Mark.
* Bill Reynolds (Rudolph Walker) is a West Indian and a Conservative. He is a supporter of West Ham United. Whenever Eddie tries to outdo him, Bill usually ends up having the last laugh and rarely gets his comeuppance. He tends to have a very short temper, especially where Eddie is concerned, and has threatened him with a clenched fist several times. Although sophisticated and educated compared to Eddie, Bill is also stubborn and more than capable of using insulting phrases; he occasionally refers to Eddie as a &quot;white honky&quot; and &quot;snowflake&quot;, and does not like catching Eddie staring at his wife. He also has a very high-pitched laugh. Bill is promoted to foreman at the end of the episode &quot;Clarky Leaves&quot;. His catchphrases include &quot;Hey, honky!&quot;, &quot;Cobblers!&quot; and &quot;You talking to me, snowflake?&quot;.
* Barbie Reynolds (Nina Baden-Semper) is Bill&#x27;s wife. Barbie and her next-door neighbour, Joan Booth, instantly strike up a friendship that carries on throughout the series, and the two women are often seen drinking tea or eating or getting caught up in their antagonistic husbands&#x27; latest row. Eddie is sometimes fascinated by her, as in the pilot episode when she bends over while wearing hotpants. She and Joan both become pregnant at the end of Series 3; Barbie gives birth to a son, Terry. Unlike other characters, she does not have any catchphrases.
* Jacko Robinson (Keith Marsh) is a socialist who works with Bill and Eddie. His catchphrase is &quot;I&#x27;ll have (a) half&quot; (referring to a half-pint of bitter). He is not very bright, and often deviates from discussions between Eddie, Bill and Arthur.
* Arthur Thomas (Tommy Godfrey) is another of Eddie and Bill&#x27;s socialist co-workers at the factory, and is often seen in the local pub playing cards and talking about trade union issues. Arthur, like Joan, is also more tolerant of Bill than Eddie is. He is a supporter of Arsenal
* Nobby Garside (Paul Luty) is the barman of the social club from series 4 onwards. Initially hostile towards Eddie, they gradually sort out their differences as the series goes on. He is a supporter of Leeds United.

==Production==
===Filming locations===
Exterior shots of the Reynolds and Booth residences for the unaired pilot episode were filmed at 90 and 92 The Alders, Hanworth, TW13 6NY. Series exteriors were filmed at 102 and 104 Bushy Park Road, Teddington, TW11 9DL. Interiors were filmed at the nearby Thames Television studios at Teddington.

===Theme music===
The theme song, &quot;Love Thy Neighbour&quot;, was composed by Mack Gordon and Harry Revel and sung by Stuart Gillies. It was first published and recorded in 1934 (using the American spelling, &quot;Love Thy Neighbor&quot;), when Bing Crosby performed it in the musical comedy film &quot;We&#x27;re Not Dressing&quot;.

==Reception==
Ever since &quot;Love Thy Neighbour&quot; was first transmitted in 1972, it has been criticised for its poor handling of issues of racism. It was made in an era when Britain was struggling to come to terms with mass immigration, and &quot;Love Thy Neighbour&quot; was said to exemplify those difficulties. According to writer Sarita Malik, this meant &quot;comedies about race&quot; were really about &quot;blacks signifying &quot;trouble&quot;&quot; so that consequently &quot;if the White characters did display prejudice, this was deemed funny or understandable given the &#x27;difficulty of the situation&#x27;.&quot;

Its writers stated that each episode included both anti-white and anti-black sentiment. In Malik&#x27;s opinion, in this &quot;mutual racism&quot;, racist attitudes were &quot;shown as a reciprocal, inevitable and petty process&quot; rather than being faced with any challenge. As a result, academic Nora Plesske maintains that the premise continued without any change in attitudes or permanent resolution of the conflict.

The views of the main white male character (Eddie Booth, played by Jack Smethurst) were presented so as to make him appear ignorant and bigoted and were contrasted with the more tolerant attitude of his wife. &quot;In nearly every show, the white neighbour was shown to be wrong&quot;, Rudolph Walker wrote in 2001. A contemporary reviewer in the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;, Mary Malone, believed &quot;the only characters who leave the screen with their dignity intact are the blacks. Now that&#x27;s what I call prejudice.&quot;

The main male black character (Bill Reynolds, played by Walker) was better educated, although also stubborn and capable of using insulting phrases, such as the terms &quot;Honky&quot;, &quot;Snowflake&quot;, &quot;Paleface&quot; or &quot;Big White Chief&quot; to describe his white neighbour (often in response to being called &quot;nig-nog&quot; or &quot;Sambo&quot;). The comedy invariably fixated on the &quot;Blackness&quot; of Bill and Barbie or rather, as Malik expressed it, &quot;television&#x27;s interpretation of Blackness (limbo-dancing, voodoo/Black magic).&quot; Other black stereotypes, such as regular references to cannibalism from the first episode onwards, became a running joke.

It has sometimes been considered that &quot;Love Thy Neighbour&quot; was an attempt by ITV (with inferior writing) to capitalise on the success of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Till Death Us Do Part&quot; (by Johnny Speight), also the source of great controversy for many of the same reasons. Repeats of &quot;Love Thy Neighbour&quot; have not been seen on British terrestrial television for many years. Rudolph Walker, who defends the series, regrets the programme&#x27;s reputation in a &quot;very politically correct climate&quot; and asked in 2003 why &quot;We can&#x27;t take the piss out of each other and laugh&quot;. While &quot;Love Thy Neighbour&quot; was hugely popular at the time of its broadcast, its commissioner at Thames Television, head of light entertainment Philip Jones, acknowledged in 1972 that it received poor reviews.

The series has since been repeated on satellite television stations in the UK, although each episode begins with a warning about content. In 2003, DVDs of the series were reported to be selling well in Nigeria, parts of the Caribbean and Australia.

==Remakes==
An Australian spin-off series, also called &quot;Love Thy Neighbour&quot;, was made in 1979, three years after the British series ended. Consisting of seven episodes, the series saw the character Eddie Booth transplanted to the Sydney suburb of Blacktown. The explanation given for the absence of Eddie&#x27;s wife and child is Eddie has emigrated first and the family will join him after he has established himself. In this series, Eddie is a boarder with a married couple, Joyce (played by Sue Jones) and Bernard (Robert Hughes). Eddie&#x27;s supervisor in his new job, Jim (Russell Newman), is also his neighbour. While the two men are initially hostile to each other, by episode three (&#x27;A Night to Remember&#x27;) they are, essentially, friends. The series does not depict any racial tension, although Eddie remains typically pigheaded and prone to tirades about the racial superiority of the British.

An American version of the show, set in the suburbs of Los Angeles and titled &quot;Love Thy Neighbor&quot;, ran during the summer of 1973 on the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) television network. This toned-down version of the British original ran for one series of 12 episodes.

==Other appearance==
Smethurst and Walker appeared as relaxing actors having a drink together in the studio bar when George Roper (Brian Murphy) walks in while searching the Thames Television TV studios in the 1974 film &quot;Man About the House&quot;.

==DVD releases==
Until 2016, the series&#x27; DVD releases had been somewhat muddled. The earlier releases were superseded by the &quot;Love Thy Neighbour: The Complete Series&quot; nine-DVD box set from the Network imprint. It includes the unscreened pilot episode, all eight series in their intended running order, the Christmas 1972 short sketch for &quot;All Star Comedy Carnival&quot;, the 1973 New Year Special, and a new transfer of the 1973 feature film in its theatrical aspect ratio. It coincided with a standalone release of the feature film on Blu-ray.

Series 1–4 were originally released by Pegasus Entertainment, and Series 5–8 were released by FremantleMedia. Once Fremantle realised the issues with the DVD, it decided to completely release all the series in the correct order. The film has been released by Studiocanal. The following list shows the previous two sets of DVD releases:

===Pegasus DVDs (no longer available)===
* Unbroadcast pilot episode and all 7 episodes from Series 1
* All 6 episodes from Series 2 and first 4 episodes from Series 3
* Final 2 episodes from Series 3 and all episodes from Series 4
===Fremantle===
* Unbroadcast pilot episode – Series 1
* Episodes 1–7 – Series 1
* Episodes 8–13 – Series 2
* Episodes 14–19 – Series 3
* Episodes 20–27 – Series 4
* Episodes 28–33 – Series 5
* Episodes 34–40 – Series 6
* Episodes 41–46 – Series 7
* Episodes 47–53 – Series 8
* Episodes 1–53 – complete series
The often quoted missing &#x27;April Fool&#x27; episode does not actually exist. During the 1974 run of the show it was postponed one week which led to it running longer than intended and receiving billing in &quot;TV Times&quot; for more weeks than it should. The episode &quot;Bananas&quot; was delayed, and &quot;Eddie&#x27;s Birthday&quot;, scheduled to be broadcast on 25 February, was not actually broadcast until 4 March. &quot;Bananas&quot; was then added onto the end of the series on 1 April, for which &quot;TV Times&quot; added an April Fool reference to the description that appeared for the earlier screening. So the April Fools episode is actually &quot;Bananas&quot; which is included in the DVD set. &quot;The Coach Trip&quot; was due to be aired with series 7, but for unknown reasons was not broadcast. It later appeared as part of series 8, with the new title &quot;The Coach Outing to Bournemouth&quot;.

The DVDs list eight series, which is now known to be accurate when Network checked through the original scripts whilst compiling the complete series DVD set. Series 4 is the pregnancy story arc, and contains the final episodes written together by creators Vince Powell and Harry Driver. Series 5 continued to be broadcast straight after series 4, following the illness and subsequent death of co-creator Harry Driver, and as such was solely written by Powell.

After the initial broadcast of &quot;The Big Day&quot; (Series 4), in which Jack Smethurst plays the new baby as well as himself, there was an extra film of Nina Baden-Semper and Kate Williams with their real newborn babies (the reason for the pregnancy theme of the series). This extra bit was not on the Pegasus DVD, but is on the Network DVD of Series 4.

<doc id="200853" wikidata="Q1706272" url="?curid=200853" title="Keith Green">
<text>Keith Gordon Green (October 21, 1953 – July 28, 1982) was an American pianist, singer, songwriter and contemporary Christian music recording artist. Originally from Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, New York, Green is known as a pioneer in the Christian and Jesus Music genre. His most notable songs are &quot;There Is a Redeemer&quot;, which was written by his wife Melody, &quot;Oh Lord You&#x27;re Beautiful&quot;, &quot;I Want To Be More Like Jesus&quot;, &quot;To Obey Is Better Than Sacrifice&quot;, and &quot;(Until) Your Love Broke Through&quot;.

==Early life==
Green was born in Sheepshead Bay, a neighborhood in Brooklyn, New York. In 1957, his family moved to Canoga Park, Los Angeles, where he grew up. Green&#x27;s parents were Jewish and eventually became Christian Scientists. The family had a history of musical performance, with Green&#x27;s father, Harvey, working in the music production industry in Los Angeles. According to his wife Melody, Green grew up &quot;in an atmosphere of moral purity, free of alcohol and drugs&quot; and said his family&#x27;s way of life &quot;had a wonderfully preserving effect on Keith during his early years.&quot;

Green took to music at a young age, as he &quot;began with the ukulele at three, the guitar at five, and the piano at seven.&quot; His talents were noted by a major newspaper when he was eight, following a performance of Arthur Laurents&#x27; &quot;The Time of the Cuckoo&quot;. A local review by the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote, &quot;roguish-looking, eight-year-old Keith Green gave a winning portrayal&quot; of &quot;the little Italian street urchin, Mauro&quot;; another review commented that he &quot;stole the show&quot;. The show was Green&#x27;s first appearance in live theater, which was held in Chatsworth, Los Angeles in September 1962. According to the &quot;LA Times&quot;, he had already done a number of television commercials and made a TV pilot.

Green played the role of Kurt von Trapp in &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; starring Janet Blair in the opening production at the Valley Music Theater, a modern 2865-seat theatre in the round in Woodland Hills, Los Angeles when he was 10.

Green and his father Harvey signed a five-year contract with Decca Records in February 1965, with Harvey as business manager, having written 40 original songs already. The first song released on disc was &quot;A Go-Go Getter&quot; in May 1965, produced by Gary Usher, which he had composed and published before signing with Decca. He became the youngest person ever to sign with the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers (ASCAP) upon publication of this song at age 11.

Decca Records planned to make Green a teen idol, regularly getting him featured in fan magazines such as &quot;Teen Scene&quot; and on television shows such as &quot;The Jack Benny Program&quot; and &quot;The Steve Allen Show&quot;. He was a guest on the television game show &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Secret&quot; on May 3, 1965. His secret was &quot;I just signed a five-year contract as a rock-&#x27;n&#x27;-roll singer.&quot; The segment included a live performance of &quot;We&#x27;ll Do a Lot of Things Together&quot;.

Green had written 10 more songs by the time that he was 12. &quot;Time&quot; ran an article about aspiring young rock-&#x27;n&#x27;-roll singers and referred to him as Decca Records&#x27; &quot;prepubescent dreamboat&quot;. The national attention that had been envisioned by Decca Records failed to materialize for Green, however, as Donny Osmond captured the attention of preteens and teenagers, eclipsing Green&#x27;s newfound stardom; and he was quickly forgotten by the public.

He grew up reading the New Testament and called the mixture of being Jewish and learning about Jesus &quot;an odd combination&quot; that left him open-minded but confused and deeply unsatisfied. As a teen perceiving his music career had failed, he ran away from home, began smoking marijuana, and used some psychedelics in hopes of finding spiritual truth. He became interested in Eastern mysticism and the &quot;free love&quot; culture. His five year spiritual quest eventually led him back to the Bible, writing his diary in December 1972, &quot;Jesus, you are hereby officially welcomed into me.&quot;

==Christian conversion==
By age 19, Green had stopped using drugs, lost interest in Eastern mysticism, and started seriously looking into the Biblical teachings of Jesus Christ. In early 1973 he met Melody Steiner, who was also Jewish as well as a songwriter. Becoming inseparable, the couple married at The Little Brown Church in Studio City, California, on Christmas Day, 1973. The newlywed couple sought more knowledge of Jesus together when, in May 1975, they visited a home bible study in Beverly Hills, California called &quot;Vineyard Christian Fellowship&quot;. Led by Vineyard founder Kenn Gulliksen, the Greens later said it was during the study that they felt the presence of God through the teaching and guitar-led worship. Hearing the Gospel for the first time and learning about Jesus as a Jewish rabbi, Green and his wife became born-again followers of Christ.

==Ministry==
In 1975, the Greens, new believers in Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior, began taking people who needed help into their small home in the suburbs of Los Angeles, in the San Fernando Valley. Both were staff songwriters for CBS Records in Hollywood and used their income to support all who came. Early on, their close friend and Christian recording artist, Randy Stonehill, who was struggling at the time, stayed for a while. Their home was later dubbed &quot;The Greenhouse&quot; – a place where people grow. The Greens continued to open their home but mostly to strangers in need. They eventually ran out of space and, purchasing the home next door to their own and renting an additional five in the same neighborhood, they provided a safe environment of Bible studies and practical discipleship to young and old alike. The majority were teenagers and those of college age. Much to the consternation of neighbors, there came to be 75 people living in the Greens&#x27; homes and traipsing down the suburban streets—including recovering drug addicts and prostitutes, bikers, the homeless, and many single pregnant girls needing shelter and safety. Some were referred to the Greens by other ministries and shelters, but most just crossed their path during their normal life at home and on the road. In 1977, the Greens&#x27; personal outreach became a nonprofit ministry they called Last Days Ministries. Green also became an ordained minister, seeing his music as a tool of his ministry.

Green&#x27;s initial tone of ministry was influenced by the words of Jesus in the Bible. Later, he was also influenced by his friends Winkie Pratney, and Leonard Ravenhill, who pointed him to Charles Finney, a nineteenth-century revivalist preacher who preached the holiness of God to provoke conviction in his hearers. During his concerts he would often exhort his listeners to repent and commit themselves more wholly to following Christ. Through relationships with Loren Cunningham, the founder of Youth with a Mission (YWAM), missions leader John Dawson, and a trip with his wife to overseas missions projects, Green saw the worldwide need for missionaries. He realized he was often too hard on growing believers and believed that all Christians needed to have at least a brief stint on the mission field. His assurance of God&#x27;s unconditional love for him grew as well. This transition is evident in his music beginning with &quot;So You Wanna Go Back to Egypt&quot; in 1980. He described the changes he went through in his next-to-last article for the &quot;Last Days Magazine&quot;.

===Recording===
Green was signed to contemporary Christian music label Sparrow Records in 1976 and worked on the album &quot;Firewind&quot; (1976) with Christian artists 2nd Chapter of Acts, Terry and John Michael Talbot, and Barry McGuire. Prior to Green&#x27;s signing with Sparrow Records, and two years before the release of &quot;No Compromise&quot;, Tommy James, of Tommy James and the Shondells, recorded &quot;Don&#x27;t Wanna Fall Away from You,&quot; composed by Green, for his 1976 Fantasy album &quot;In Touch&quot;.

His first solo project, &quot;For Him Who Has Ears to Hear&quot;, was released in 1977 and topped the charts. His second solo release, &quot;No Compromise&quot;, followed in 1978. His wife Melody wrote that the title &quot;seemed to capture the heart of what Keith wanted to say to other Christians—that they needed to quit compromising, stop listening to the voice of the world, and start living committed lives.&quot; In 1979, after negotiating a release from his contract with Sparrow, Green initiated a new policy of refusing to charge money for concerts or albums. Keith and Melody mortgaged their home to privately finance Green&#x27;s next album, &quot;So You Wanna Go Back to Egypt&quot;. The album, which featured a guest appearance by Bob Dylan, was offered through mail order and at concerts for a price determined by the purchaser. By May 1982, Green had shipped out more than 200,000 units of his album – 61,000 for free. Subsequent albums included &quot;The Keith Green Collection&quot; (1981) and &quot;Songs for the Shepherd&quot; (1982). Some in the gospel industry labeled Green a &quot;kook&quot; for his unorthodox methods, but Green believed he had to practice what he preached, and he felt he could not charge $8.98 for a record when the gospel and salvation were free.

When his music was carried by Christian bookstores, a second cassette was included free of charge for every cassette purchased to give away to a friend to help spread the Gospel.

===Last Days Ministries===
In 1978, Last Days Ministries (LDM) began publishing the &quot;Last Days Newsletter&quot; from the Greens&#x27; garage. Originally printed on a few pages of loose paper, the newsletter grew in content to eventually become a &quot;small, colorful magazine&quot; and was renamed in mid-1985 as the &quot;Last Days Magazine.&quot; After Keith&#x27;s 1982 death Melody was appointed to lead the ministry. By the mid-1980s, the Last Days Magazine was sent out to over 500,000 people worldwide.

In 1979, the ministry relocated from the San Fernando Valley to a plot of land in Garden Valley, Texas, a crossroads community about west of Lindale, Texas. Within a few years, Last Days purchased additional land, bringing the total to .

==Death in plane crash==
Along with 11 others, Green died on July 28, 1982, when the Robertson STOL-modified Cessna 414 leased by Last Days Ministries crashed after takeoff from the private airstrip located on the LDM property. The small twin-engined plane was carrying 11 passengers and the pilot, Don Burmeister, for an aerial tour of the LDM property and the surrounding area. Green and two of his children, three-year-old Josiah and two-year-old Bethany, were on board the plane, along with visiting church planters, John and Dede Smalley and their six children. Green&#x27;s wife Melody was at home with one-year-old Rebekah and six weeks pregnant with their fourth child, Rachel, born in March 1983.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) determined that the crash was caused by the pilot in command (PIC) allowing the aircraft to be loaded beyond its operating limitations. The required preflight weight and balance computations responsibility of civilian pilots would have shown it was dangerously overloaded and also outside its weight and balance operating envelope. This responsibility with military pilots is the responsibility of the military loadmaster, and thus he may have, by force of habit, overlooked this responsibility. Don Alan Burmeister was a former United States Marine Corps aviator, but FAA records show he had very limited experience / training in flying conventional (vs. centerline thrust) twin-engine aircraft. Records show it was only a short time prior to the accident (6/9/82) that he completed a check-ride to remove the &quot;centerline thrust&quot; restriction from his pilot&#x27;s certificate. This check-ride should have fully evaluated his ability to fly a conventional multi-engine aircraft throughout its designed range of operations, but the flight examiner was decertified the next month (7/10/82) by the FAA due to a &quot;history of incomplete or substandard check-rides&quot;. Additionally, the insurance carrier (Ideal Mutual Insurance Co.) required Burmeister to log 1,045 hrs of flying time, attend a Cessna ground and flight training course, as well as log 15 hours in a Cessna 414 (C-414) prior to acting as the PIC of the leased aircraft. The NTSB record shows he failed to accomplish all of these requirements. With pilot and eleven passengers, the aircraft was overloaded by an estimated , and the location of the center of gravity was found to be beyond the maximum aft limit. Combined with an air temperature of , creating a condition known as &quot;hot and high&quot; (high density altitude, producing a lower climb rate on takeoff and greater danger of stalling), the C-414 could do little but struggle into the air within ground effect, and once airborne was left virtually uncontrollable. These factors prevented the aircraft from ever attaining sufficient altitude, and it crashed into trees less than a mile from the airport.

Keith Gordon Green, Josiah David Green (September 18, 1978 – July 28, 1982), and Bethany Grace Green (February 5, 1980 – July 28, 1982) are interred in the same coffin at Garden Valley Cemetery behind the Garden Valley Baptist Church, less than a half-mile from the LDM property.

===Last Days Ministries continues===
Melody Green continued to lead Last Days Ministries from Texas until 1996, when she moved to California and launched Last Days Ministries Online where all of Green&#x27;s writings are free and his music can be found. The free monthly Last Days Ministries Newsletter is also sent out by request.

Melody maintains the Keith Green Facebook page to honor Keith and also shares her opinions on the Melody Green Facebook Page where she interacts with Green&#x27;s fans and Last Days Ministries fans.

==Legacy==
Two full albums of original Green songs were released posthumously: &quot;The Prodigal Son&quot; (1983) and &quot;Jesus Commands Us to Go!&quot; (1984). Another release, &quot;I Only Want to See You There&quot; (1983) contained mostly previously released material. A compilation of his recorded work, &quot;The Ministry Years&quot;, was released as a two-volume set in 1987 and 1988 and included five previously unreleased songs.

Another unreleased Christian song &quot;Born Again&quot; by Keith and Melody was finally released in 1999, 17 years after his death, on the &quot;First Love&quot; compilation video and CD. Both feature a two-song tribute to Green by other Christian artists.

In 2008, Melody with her grown daughters Rebekah Joy and Rachel Hope partnered with Sparrow Records and released &quot;The Live Experience – Special Edition&quot;, a CD/DVD combination of 16 live recordings and 4 hours of DVD footage including video of live performances as well as details regarding Green&#x27;s life and his passing. A greatest hits album was also released at the same time, including 17 of Green&#x27;s most popular songs and one more previously unreleased Christian song, &quot;Your Love Came Over Me&quot;.

On November 23, 2009, the EP &quot;Happy Birthday to You Jesus&quot; was released, containing a talk by Green about Christmas and another previously unreleased song, &quot;Happy Birthday to You Jesus&quot;.

A prolific personal journalist, Green&#x27;s writings were published as excerpts in the books &quot;A Cry in the Wilderness&quot; (Sparrow, 1993), &quot;If You Love the Lord&quot; (Harvest House, 2000), and &quot;Make My Life a Prayer&quot; (Harvest House, 2001).

===Tribute recordings===
In 1992, several artists joined together to re-record many of the Greens&#x27; best-known songs for a tribute album called &quot;No Compromise: Remembering the Music of Keith Green&quot; under the Sparrow Records label. Artists contributing to the recording include Petra, Charlie Peacock, Susan Ashton, Margaret Becker, Michael Card, GLAD, Rich Mullins, Steven Curtis Chapman, Steve Green, and Russ Taff.

In 2001, BEC Recordings released a second tribute record &quot;Start Right Here: Remembering the Life of Keith Green&quot;. Produced by Derri Daugherty, the album included performances by new contemporary Christian artists MxPx, Joy Electric, and Starflyer 59, among others.

At the 20th anniversary of Green&#x27;s death, Sparrow Records released another tribute album, &quot;Your Love Broke Through: The Worship Songs of Keith Green&quot;. The 2002 album contains re-recordings by Rebecca St. James, Michelle Tumes, Chris Tomlin, Twila Paris, Darlene Zschech, Jason Upton, Martin Smith, Charlie Hall, Joanne Hogg, Matt Redman, Paul Oakley, and Sarah Sadler. The album contains contemporary Christian and mainstream artist Michael W. Smith&#x27;s version of the song &quot;There Is One&quot;, an unfinished work by Green. Composition of the song was completed by Smith, along with British songwriter and Christian music artist Martin Smith.

===Honors===
On November 27, 2001, Green was inducted into the Gospel Music Hall of Fame. Melody Green and their daughters Rebekah and Rachel attended to receive the honor for Keith.

On April 3, 2006, Green was honored with the ASCAP Crescendo Award at the 28th annual ASCAP Christian Music Awards presentation dinner. His widow, Melody Green, and their daughter Rachel were present to receive the award for Keith.

===Documentary===
&quot;The Keith Green Story - Your Love Broke Through&quot;, a 2002 documentary DVD about Green&#x27;s life, was directed by Daren Thomas with Melody Green as executive producer. Narrated by Toby Mac, it was distributed by Sparrow Records.

===Film===
In 2011, Melody Green announced that a feature film about Green&#x27;s life was in development. After the initial producers failed to exercise their final option to obtain long-term film rights, Melody began to gather a new production team. As of 2013, the film was under development.

<doc id="200861" wikidata="Q3636398" url="?curid=200861" title="Battle of Cisterna">
<text>The Battle of Cisterna took place during World War II, on 30 January–2 February 1944, near Cisterna, Italy, as part of the Battle of Anzio, part of the Italian Campaign. The battle was a clear German victory which also had repercussions on the employment of U.S. Army Rangers that went beyond the immediate tactical and strategic results of the battle.

During this battle, the 1st, 3rd, and 4th U.S. Army Ranger battalions, the 83rd Chemical Mortar Battalion, and the 509th Parachute Infantry Battalion, which had been brigaded as the 6615th Ranger Force (Provisional) commanded by Colonel William O. Darby, were assigned to support the renewal of an attack by Major General Lucian Truscott&#x27;s 3rd Infantry Division, which had previously failed to take Cisterna from 25 to 27 January. The 3rd Division&#x27;s attack was part of a large offensive by Major General John Lucas&#x27;s U.S. VI Corps to break out of the Anzio beachhead before German reinforcements could arrive and concentrate for a counterattack.

==Background==
On 22 January 1944, the Allies launched Operation Shingle, the amphibious landing by the U.S. and British divisions of U.S. VI Corps in the area of Anzio and Nettuno. This was designed to unhinge the formidable German Gustav Line defenses some to the southeast which had been under attack from the south by the other three corps (one British, one French and one U.S.) of Mark Clark&#x27;s United States Fifth Army since 16 January in the first Battle of Monte Cassino. Following the landings, which had been virtually unopposed, John P. Lucas—the VI Corps commander—had chosen a cautious strategy of consolidating the beachhead and building up his force strength, which also allowed time for the Germans to reinforce their defensive positions. By 29 January, there were 69,000 men in the beachhead, but the Germans had also had time to react and move 71,500 troops to face them.

On 31 January, Lucas launched a two-pronged attack. The main attack, by British 1st Infantry Division, was to advance northeast up the Via Anziate toward Campoleone and the Alban Hills. In a secondary simultaneous attack, a Ranger force was to infiltrate Cisterna and clear the Conca-Cisterna Road during the night preparatory to an attack in the morning by 15th Infantry Regiment on the town and supporting attacks by 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment on their right and 7th Infantry Regiment on their left. 7th Infantry was to cut Route 7, the main supply line to the German Tenth Army on the Gustav Line, at Cassino.

However, the plan had been based on the misinterpretation of reconnaissance intelligence, which had concluded that the main line of German resistance was behind Cisterna. In fact, the Wehrmacht had designated Cisterna as an assembly area for its reserve divisions and had begun moving units into the area. Although a Polish conscript in the German Army had deserted to the U.S. lines immediately before the attack, warning of the buildup, the message was not relayed promptly and the attack proceeded as planned.
The Rangers, who expected to encounter a line of thinly held outposts advanced unknowingly towards a large enemy force.

Contrary to their designated function as an elite raiding force, the Rangers had been involved in much of the front line fighting around the Anzio beachhead. Ranger casualties meant many replacements were recruits who lacked the experience and quality of training of the original members. The growing presence of green troops in an otherwise skilled force degraded its ability to conduct successful infiltration and night operations.

==Battle==
The 1st and 3rd Ranger Battalions—preceding the main attack by the 4th Ranger Battalion and the 3rd Battalion, 15th Infantry Regiment—attempted a night infiltration behind German lines into the town of Cisterna. Their objective was to seize the town in a surprise attack and hold it until the main attack came through.

The two battalions—totaling 767 men and supported by a platoon of 43 men of the 3rd Reconnaissance Troop—moved out at 01:30 and moved in the darkness along a drainage ditch (Mussolini Canal) in column formation. Although they were able to bypass numerous German positions, at first light they were still short of their objective and needed to cross open ground for the final section of the approach. At this point the Rangers were attacked by strong German forces of the 715th Infantry Division and Hermann Göring Panzer Division, including at least seventeen German Panzer IV tanks. According to the Army history of the operation, the infiltration movement had apparently been discovered and an ambush prepared.

The 1st Battalion commander—Major Dobson—personally knocked out one tank by shooting the commander with his pistol, climbing atop the tank, and dropping a white phosphorus grenade down the hatch. Two other tanks were captured by Rangers, but then knocked out by other Rangers who did not know they had been captured. Despite fierce fighting, there was little chance of success once the Rangers were attacked on the open ground. German units put Ranger prisoners in front of their tanks and commanded other Rangers to surrender. Over 700 POWs were captured.

===Attempted relief of the Rangers===
The main assault also jumped off in an attempt to rescue the trapped battalions. Led by the 4th Ranger Battalion, it encountered serious opposition and failed to break through. However, the overall attack—which also included an attack by the 7th Infantry Regiment and 504th Parachute Infantry Regiments—did push the Allied lines forward on a wide front on 31 January and 1 February, although failing to achieve the desired breakthrough and Cisterna was to remain in German hands until May 1944. However, German counterattacks on 1–2 February—conducted by the Hermann Göring Panzer and 71st Infantry Divisions—failed to recapture any of the ground from the Allies and suffered severe casualties.

==Aftermath==
Later intelligence revealed that the American efforts had hindered the planned German counterattack on the Allied forces at Anzio.

Gen Lucas&#x27; employment of the lightly armed Rangers to spearhead the attack was heavily criticized. The shattered Ranger forces within Italy were subsequently disbanded, and as many as four-hundred surviving Rangers served as replacements in the US/Canadian First Special Service Force, an elite raiding force in need of qualified replacements.

William O. Darby had commanded the American Ranger Force during the battle. When the 179th Infantry Regiment of the 45th Infantry Division was nearly overrun on 18 February during the major German attempt to take out the beachhead, Darby was sent to take command and hold the ground. Darby later was assistant division commander of the 10th Mountain Division. He was killed in action on 30 April 1945, and was the only U.S. officer honored with a posthumous promotion to General during World War II.

A fictionalized account of the battle was depicted in the motion picture &quot;Anzio&quot; (1968) and at the end of the film &quot;Darby&#x27;s Rangers&quot; (1958).

<text>A cisterna (: cisternae) is a flattened membrane vesicle found in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. Cisternae are an integral part of the packaging and modification processes of proteins occurring in the Golgi.

==Function==
Proteins begin on the cis side of the Golgi (the side facing the ER) and exit on the trans side (the side facing the plasma membrane). Throughout their journey in the cisternae, the proteins are packaged and are modified for transport throughout the cell. The number of cisternae in the Golgi stack is dependent on the organism and cell type. The structure, composition, and function of each of the cisternae may be different inside the Golgi stack. These different variations of Golgi cisternae are categorized into three groups; cis Golgi network, medial, and trans Golgi network. The &quot;cis&quot; Golgi network is the first step in the cisternal structure of a protein being packaged, while the &quot;trans&quot; Golgi network is the last step in the cisternal structure when the vesicle is being transferred to either the lysosome, the cell surface or the secretory vesicle. The cisternae are shaped by the cytoskeleton of the cell through a lipid bilayer. Post-translational modifications such as glycosylation, phosphorylation and cleavage occur in the Golgi and as proteins travel through it, they go through the cisternae, which allows functional ion channels to be created due to these modifications. Each class of cisternae contains various enzymes used in protein modifications. These enzymes help the Golgi in glycosylation and phosphorylation of proteins, as well as mediate signal modifications to direct proteins to their final destination. Defects in the cisternal enzymes can cause congenital defects including some forms of muscular dystrophy, cystic fibrosis, cancer, and diabetes.

The trans-Golgi network is an important part of the Golgi. It is located on the trans face of the Golgi apparatus and is made up of cisternae. The cisternae play a crucial role in the packaging, modification, and transport functions for the cell overall. The proteins and polysaccharides that get processed here within the cisterna will then be sent to their specified locations.

There are multiple types of cisternae which can be recognized from their distinctions in morphology. These distinctions include enzymes relating to glycosylation that have been identified in cisternae located in different regions of the Golgi. This difference in the localization of enzymes throughout cisternae can contribute to the functioning of the Golgi by regulating the pH, ion concentrations, and the amounts of substrate that are necessary. This also works to make sure that reactions are happening in the correct places within the Golgi and that proteins do not undergo the wrong modification if they are in the wrong location.

The cis Golgi network is the first step in the cisternal structure of a protein being packaged, while the trans Golgi network is the last step in the cisternal structure when the vesicle is being transferred to either the lysosome, the cell surface or the secretory vesicle. The medial cisternae is where the mannose residue and extra N-acetylglucosamine is removed. 

== Golgi glycosylation ==
The Golgi apparatus plays a critical role in the modification of proteins through glycosylation, particularly &quot;N&quot;-linked glycosylation, which is a crucial process for the proper folding, stability, and function of many secretory and membrane-bound proteins. &quot;N&quot;-linked glycosylation involves the attachment of oligosaccharides to the nitrogen atom of asparagine residues in proteins. These oligosaccharides are composed of various sugar units, including N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), mannose (Man), galactose (Gal), and N-acetylneuraminate (NANA, also known as sialic acid). These glycosylated structures are integral for proper protein function, influencing cellular interactions, protein trafficking, and immune recognition.

&quot;N&quot;-linked glycosylation begins in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where a precursor oligosaccharide is synthesized on a lipid carrier called dolichol. The precursor consists of a core structure made up of two N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residues, nine mannose (Man) residues, and three glucose (Glc) residues. The precursor is then transferred to a protein&#x27;s asparagine residue as soon as the protein enters the ER lumen. The attachment of the oligosaccharide to the asparagine is catalyzed by the enzyme oligosaccharyltransferase.

Once the glycosylated protein enters the ER, further processing of the oligosaccharide occurs. Three specific enzymes play key roles in this early stage of glycosylation. First, glucosidase I removes one glucose residue from the oligosaccharide. Then, glucosidase II removes two more glucose residues, leaving behind a core oligosaccharide attached to the protein. Finally, a mannosidase enzyme removes one mannose residue. After this initial trimming, the oligosaccharide is ready to move from the ER to the Golgi apparatus for more elaborate modifications.

In the Golgi, further trimming and addition of sugar residues occur, particularly the removal of mannose and the addition of various sugars such as GlcNAc, galactose (Gal), and sialic acid (NANA). Golgi mannosidase I and mannosidase II remove additional mannose residues from the oligosaccharide, further refining its structure. GlcNAc transferase then adds GlcNAc residues to the growing oligosaccharide chain by transferring GlcNAc from UDP-GlcNAc. In the medial-Golgi, the oligosaccharide undergoes more modifications, including the addition of two GlcNAc units, three Gal residues, and finally three sialic acid (NANA) residues in the trans-Golgi network.

Each compartment of the Golgi plays a distinct role in glycosylation and protein processing. The cis-Golgi network is involved in the phosphorylation of oligosaccharides on lysosomal proteins, a modification that helps target proteins to the lysosomes. The medial-Golgi is the site of important reactions like the trimming of mannose and the addition of GlcNAc, which is essential for the formation of complex glycan structures. In the trans-Golgi, galactose is added to the oligosaccharide, further refining the glycan structure. The trans-Golgi network is responsible for adding sialic acid (NANA) and sorting proteins into vesicles destined for lysosomes or secretion. These specialized modifications and sorting are crucial for protein functionality and their subsequent cellular destinations.

The organization of the Golgi compartments into cisternae—stacks of membrane-bound structures—ensures that enzymes are properly localized to each region, facilitating the sequential and highly regulated modification of oligosaccharides. The Golgi apparatus plays a pivotal role in &quot;N&quot;-linked glycosylation, a process that begins in the ER and is elaborated within the Golgi. Through the sequential trimming and addition of sugars like GlcNAc, mannose, galactose, and sialic acid, the Golgi ensures that proteins are properly modified for their final functional roles. The distinct regions of the Golgi, from the cis-Golgi to the trans-Golgi network, work in concert to facilitate the precise modification and sorting of glycoproteins, which are essential for a wide range of cellular functions.

== Secretory pathway ==
The secretory pathway is essential for the sorting, packing, and delivery of proteins to their correct cellular destinations. It begins in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where proteins are synthesized and initially sorted into vesicles for transport. These vesicles then move to the Golgi apparatus, where they undergo further processing and are directed to their final destinations, such as the plasma membrane, endosomes, or lysosomes.

The first step in the secretory pathway is the formation of transport vesicles at the ER. These vesicles are coated with COPII, a protein complex essential for budding from the ER. COPII coats consist of the small GTP-binding protein Sar1 and two additional complexes: Sec23/Sec24 and Sec13/Sec31. These coat proteins interact with membrane cargo proteins, ensuring that the right proteins are packaged into vesicles. The vesicles then move toward the cis-Golgi network, where they enter via COPII-mediated transport.

The secretory pathway also requires retrograde transport to maintain cellular function. Many ER-resident proteins have specific sorting signals that direct them to be retained in the ER or returned from the Golgi if missorted. This is achieved by COPI-coated vesicles, which transport these proteins back to the ER from the Golgi in a process called retrograde trafficking. COPI vesicles also play a key role in the movement of Golgi-resident enzymes between different Golgi compartments, ensuring that each compartment maintains the necessary enzymes for proper modification of cargo proteins.

Once vesicles reach the Golgi, they undergo further modifications, including glycosylation and proteolytic processing. Cargo proteins move through the Golgi compartments (cis, medial, and trans) by either vesicular transport or cisternal maturation. Vesicular transport suggests that the Golgi cisternae remain static while vesicles transport cargo between compartments. In contrast, cisternal maturation poses that the Golgi cisternae themselves mature as enzymes and cargo are progressively moved through the stack, while the cisternae retrogradely exchange enzymes by COPI vesicles.

At the trans-Golgi network, cargo proteins are sorted into different vesicles for delivery to their final destinations. For lysosomal proteins, a crucial modification occurs: the addition of mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) residues in the cis-Golgi. These M6P tags are recognized by M6P receptors in the trans-Golgi membrane, which directs the proteins toward late endosomes. In the endosomes, the M6P receptors dissociate from the cargo, and the receptors are recycled back to the Golgi or plasma membrane. The lysosomal enzymes are then delivered to the lysosomes for their final role in cellular degradation.

Thus, the secretory pathway is a highly coordinated process, involving various vesicular transport mechanisms and modifications, to ensure that proteins are correctly sorted, processed, and delivered to their appropriate cellular locations.

<text>Géraud Christophe Michel Duroc (; born du Roc; 25 October 1772 – 23 May 1813), Duke of [[Frioul]], was a French general and diplomat who fought in the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars. He was noted for his friendship with Napoleon Bonaparte, who appointed him as the first Grand marshal of the palace, the head of the Emperor&#x27;s military household. He is sometimes referred to as ‘Napoleon&#x27;s shadow’ (&quot;l&#x27;ombre de Napoléon&quot; in French).

==Early life and education==
Duroc was born in Pont-à-Mousson on 25 October 1772, to a family of the &quot;noblesse de robe&quot; from Gévaudan. His father, Claude du Roc, was a former captain of the dragoons who had retired to Pont-à-Mousson due to hearing loss. Duroc entered the local military school in 1781, where he studied for eight years. He then entered the School of Artillery of Châlons as a second lieutenant, in March 1792. Around this time, he removed the nobiliary particle &quot;de&quot; from his surname (changing it to &quot;Duroc&quot;), in the context of the French Revolution.

As a member of the nobility, Duroc opposed the new revolutionary government of France. In July 1792, he left the artillery school to become an &quot;emigré&quot; soldier in the counter-revolutionary Army of Condé, at the start of the Revolutionary Wars. He soon changed his mind, however, and after the Battle of Valmy Duroc deserted the royalist army. Along with two other deserters, he was arrested by the French in Fresnes-en-Woëvre following the battle, and in March 1793 he was allowed to return to Châlons and finish his education.

==Revolutionary Wars==
Duroc joined the French Revolutionary Army on 1 June 1793, being assigned lieutenant &quot;en seconde&quot; of the 4th Foot Artillery Regiment, and advanced steadily in the service. Captain Duroc became &quot;aide-de-camp&quot; to Napoleon in 1796, and distinguished himself at Isonzo, Brenta and Gradisca in the Italian campaigns of 1796-1797.

He served in Egypt, and was seriously wounded at the Battle of Abukir. His devotion to Napoleon was rewarded by complete confidence. He became first &quot;aide-de-camp&quot; (1798), general of brigade (1800) then governor of the Tuileries Palace. After the Battle of Marengo, Duroc was sent on missions to Vienna, St Petersburg, Stockholm and Copenhagen.

==Napoleonic Wars==

As Grand Marshal of the Palace, Duroc was responsible for the measures taken to secure Napoleon&#x27;s personal safety, whether in France or on his campaigns, and he directed the minutest details of the imperial household.

After the Battle of Austerlitz, where he commanded the grenadiers in the absence of General Oudinot, he was employed in a series of important negotiations with Frederick William III of Prussia, with the elector of Saxony (December 1806), in the incorporation of certain states in the Confederation of the Rhine, and in the conclusion of the armistice of Znaim (July 1809).

In 1808, he was created Duke of Frioul (&quot;Duc de Frioul&quot;): his duchy was made &quot;duché grand-fief&quot; for his widow in 1813, a rare - but nominal - hereditary honour (extinguished in 1829), created in Napoleon&#x27;s own Kingdom of Italy. In 1813, after the Russian campaign he was appointed to the &quot;Sénat conservateur&quot; as a senator.

After the Battle of Bautzen (20–21 May 1813), the Grande Armée made a slow pursuit of Allied forces. At the Battle of Reichenbach on 22 May 1813, a cannonball ricocheted off a tree-trunk, hit Duroc in the stomach, tore open his belly and spilled out his intestines in a gory mess over uniform, saddle and horse, which Napoleon witnessed. Whilst Duroc lay dying inside a farmhouse, he requested Napoleon&#x27;s presence where he apologised to the Emperor for not being able to serve him further, asked him to be a father to his daughter, and then requested him to withdraw so that he was not present at the moment of death. Alternatively, Napoleon claimed in later life that &quot;when his bowels were falling out before my eyes, he repeatedly cried to me to have him put out of his misery. I told him: &#x27;I feel pity for you, my friend, but there is no remedy but to suffer till the end.&#x27;&quot; Napoleon bought the farm and erected a monument to his memory.

==Legacy==

Duroc&#x27;s remains were moved in 1847 to be buried in the Hôtel des Invalides, in Paris. His name is inscribed on the Eastern pillar of the Arc de Triomphe, on column 15.

The metro station Duroc of the Paris Métro is named after him.

<text>Major General Charles Wolcott Ryder CB (January 16, 1892 – August 17, 1960) was a senior United States Army officer who served with distinction in both World War I and World War II.

==Early life and military career==
Charles W. Ryder was born in Topeka, Kansas in mid-January 1892 and graduated from Topeka High School. In 1911 he entered the United States Military Academy (USMA), at West Point, New York. Four years later, he graduated thirty-ninth in a class of 164 as a second lieutenant in the Infantry Branch of the United States Army as part of the West Point class of 1915, also known as &quot;the class the stars fell on&quot;. Among those he graduated with were Dwight D. Eisenhower, Omar Bradley, James Van Fleet, Joseph T. McNarney and many others who, like Ryder, would also attain general officer rank.

Ryder&#x27;s first assignment was with the 30th Infantry Regiment and, later, was on border duty near Fort Sam Houston, Texas. He then served with the Reserve Officers Training Corps (ROTC) in New York and, by the time of the American entry into World War I he was a company commander in the 16th Infantry Regiment.

Ryder, together with the rest of his regiment, which was now part of the 1st Infantry Brigade of the newly created 1st Division, was sent to the Western Front and arrived there in June 1917, one of the first units of the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) to be sent overseas in World War I. Promoted to captain in May, commanding Company &#x27;B&#x27; of the 1st Battalion, 16th Infantry, Ryder and his regiment, not immediately engaged in combat, spent almost a year being trained in trench warfare tactics from the French Army. He was promoted to major on June 17, 1918, and assumed command of the 1st Battalion, 16th Infantry Regiment.

A month later, he led the battalion in the Battle of Soissons, suffering heavy casualties, including Ryder himself, who was wounded by German artillery but continued to lead his men. Of the 1,100 men of Ryder&#x27;s battalion who went &quot;over the top&quot; on July 18, 1918, there were less than 50 remaining five days later. However, Ryder, in his first battle, had performed well and was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, the nation&#x27;s second highest award for valor in the face of the enemy, the Silver Citation Star and the Purple Heart.

Wounded in the heart (which would affect him for the rest of his life), he spent the next few weeks recovering in the hospital and soon returned to the command of his battalion. He again led the battalion in the Meuse-Argonne Offensive in early October 1918, where it captured Hill 272, a dominant terrain feature in the 1st Division&#x27;s sector which had brought the division to a standstill for three days. After personally observing his battalion&#x27;s objective, he gave verbal orders to his company commanders and outlined his plan of attack. On October 8 the division artillery concentrated fire on the hill and Ryder&#x27;s battalion, with Ryder, as at Soissons, again leading from the front, attacked the hill at 8:30am the next day, under cover of a thick fog and supported by machine guns and a huge artillery barrage. Working in small units to outflank the enemy machine guns and mortars, capturing or destroying enemy positions, the battalion had, by 11:00am, secured all its objectives and captured more than 50 machine guns and began to consolidate its position. For his personal leadership in the battle Ryder was awarded with a second Distinguished Service Cross, two of twenty five to be awarded to men of the 1st Division. World War I came to an end just over a month later with the signing of the Armistice with Germany coming into effect on November 11, 1918, at 11:00am. Ryder&#x27;s war was over and the personal lessons he learned would remain with him and serve him well in the future.

==Between the wars==
After the end of the conflict Ryder remained in the army, served on occupation duties in France and Germany. Ryder had been decorated with two Distinguished Service Crosses, a Silver Star and a Purple Heart for his service in the war.

Between the wars, Ryder served in various posts, including the Command and General Staff School, Fort Leavenworth, Kansas; the 15th Infantry in Tientsin, China; Assistant Instructor of Tactics, Commanding Company of Cadets at West Point (1923-1924) and as Commandant of Cadets at West Point (1937–1941).

==World War II==
In 1941–1942, during World War II, he was chief of staff of the VI Corps. From May 1942 to July 1944, Ryder, promoted to major general, was Commanding General (CG) of the 34th Infantry Division, the first U.S. division deployed to Europe in World War II. He led the division through the Tunisian campaign and the Italian Campaign, including the Operation Torch landings in French North Africa in November 1942 and many battles in Italy.

==Postwar==
From September 2, 1944, to December 6, 1948, Ryder served as commanding general of the IX Corps, preparing for the invasion of Japan. After the Japanese surrender, he continued to serve as commanding general of the IX Corps during the occupation of Japan.

Ryder retired from the Army in 1950 and died at Martha&#x27;s Vineyard Hospital on August 17, 1960, at the age of 68.

==Family==
His son, Charles Wolcott Ryder Jr. was a USMA graduate in the Class of 1941 who served with the 90th Infantry Division, had an equally distinguished career and, like his father, also rose to the rank of major general.

<text>The 36th Infantry Division (&quot;Arrowhead&quot;) also known as the &quot;Panther Division&quot;, the &quot;Lone Star Division&quot;, &quot;The Texas Army&quot;, and the &quot;T-patchers&quot;, is an infantry division of the U.S. Army and part of the Texas Army National Guard. The 36th Infantry Division was first organized during World War I (1914–1918) from units of the Texas and Oklahoma National Guards. After the war, the division was reformed as an all-Texas unit, and was called to service for World War II (1937–1945) on 25 November 1940, was deployed to the European Theater of Operations in April 1943, and returned to the Texas National Guard in December 1945.

In late 1941, a unit of the 36th Infantry, the 2nd Battalion, 131st Field Artillery, was detached and deployed to the Pacific Theatre of Operations (PTO) against the Japanese forces. In the course of the fighting, the Japanese Imperial Army captured some soldiers from the 2/131 FA and enslaved them to perform forced labor. Their fate as a unit was unknown for most of World War II, which resulted in the 2/131 FA Bn. being nicknamed the &quot;Lost Battalion&quot; of the PTO.

In 2004, the 36th Infantry Division was reconstituted in a reorganization of the 49th Armored Division.

==History==

===World War I===
The 36th Division was originally constituted by the Militia Bureau in early 1917 as the 15th Division, made up of troops from Texas and Oklahoma. In July 1917, three months after the American entry into World War I, the designation was changed to the 36th Division when the War Department directed the organization of the unit at at Camp Bowie, Texas, near Fort Worth, (related only in name to the later World War II-era camp near Brownwood, Texas) under the command of Major General Edwin St. John Greble.

After conducting training for the next few months, the 36th was sent to the Western Front in July 1918 and conducted major operations in the Meuse–Argonne offensive. On 9–10 October, the unit participated in heavy combat near the village of St. Etienne. Following this victory, which included the capture of several hundred men and officers of the German Army, as well as artillery, the unit launched an assault near an area known as &quot;Forest Farm.&quot; The eventual victory brought World War I to an end. In the relatively brief period of time the 36th Division spent in action during the war, the division suffered 2,584 casualties, 466 of them killed in action and an additional 2,118 wounded or missing.

===Interwar period===

The 36th Division headquarters arrived at the port of New York aboard the USS Patricia on 4 June 1919 after 11 months of overseas service and was demobilized on 18 June 1919 at Camp Bowie. In accordance with the National Defense Act of 1920, the division was allotted to the state of Texas and assigned to the VIII Corps in 1921. The designated mobilization training center for the “Texas Division” was Camp Hulen on Matagorda Bay near Palacios, Texas, where much of the division’s training activities occurred between the wars. The division headquarters was reorganized and federally recognized on 2 May 1923 at Houston, Texas. The division headquarters was relocated on 20 September 1930 to Fort Worth, and on 22 September 1936 to San Antonio, Texas. The division, less the 61st Field Artillery Brigade, conducted its summer camp at Camp Mabry, in Austin, Texas, from 1922–23, Fort Crockett, Texas, on Galveston Bay, in 1924, back to Camp Mabry in 1925, and at Camp Hulen from 1926-1939. The 61st Field Artillery Brigade conducted its training every other year at Camp Bullis, near San Antonio, so that its subordinate batteries could conduct live-fire training at the artillery ranges located there. For at least three years (1931-33) the division’s subordinate units trained over 170 company-grade Organized Reserve officers of the 90th Division at Camp Hulen and Camp Bullis. 

Like the 26th, 27th, 28th, 33rd, 37th, and 38th Divisions, the 36th Division was located all in one state, and therefore could maximize opportunities to train as a complete unit. From 1922-35, the 36th Division gradually increased its level of proficiency as its units became more skilled. The training was conducted at individual level initially, and up to regimental level for the later camps. In 1936, the division and brigade staffs participated in the Third Army command post exercise (CPX) at Camp Bullis. The CPX was designed to prepare the staffs for the large-scale maneuvers to be held in 1938. The division participated in the Eighth Corps Area concentration of the Third Army maneuvers at Camp Bullis in August 1938. During that maneuver, the 36th Division operated as part of the provisional Blue Corps against the 2nd and 45th Divisions of the Brown Corps. In January 1940, the 36th Division&#x27;s commanding general and his staff participated in the 2nd Division&#x27;s maneuver near Christine, Texas. For the final phase of the exercise, the division commander and staff assumed control of the simulated combat actions of the 2nd Division. In August 1940, the “Texas Division” again participated in the Third Army maneuvers, this time near the Kisatchie National Forest in Louisiana as part of the provisional VIII Corps.

===World War II===
The 36th Division was called up again for active federal service on 25 November 1940, during World War II (although the United States was neutral at this stage), departing for its mobilization station at Camp Bowie on 14 December 1940. The division commanded by Major General Claude V. Birkhead, moved to Brownwood, Texas, on 1 June 1941, where it participated in the VIII Corps Brownwood Maneuvers until 13 June 1941. The division then returned to Camp Bowie.

The division then moved to Mansfield, Louisiana, and took part in both the August and September 1941 Louisiana Maneuvers. The division, now commanded by Brigadier General Fred L. Walker, a Regular Army officer from Ohio and a distinguished veteran of World War I, then returned to Camp Bowie on 2 October 1941, where it was reorganized from a square division into a triangular division on 1 February 1942 and redesignated the 36th Infantry Division, just weeks after the American entry into World War II, as a result of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, which was followed four days later by the German declaration of war against the United States. As a result of this reorganization, the 144th Infantry, plus numerous supporting units, were transferred out of the division.

The division then moved to Camp Blanding, Florida, on 19 February 1942, and participated in the Carolina Maneuvers between 9 July 1942, and 15 August 1942. The division then was staged at Camp Edwards, Massachusetts, on 17 August 1942, for its port call to the European Theater Of Operations (ETO). During its time at Camp Edwards, the division conducted mock assaults of Martha&#x27;s Vineyard Island in preparation for future amphibious operations.

The division departed the New York Port of Embarkation (NYPOE) on 2 April 1943, for service in the Mediterranean Theater of Operations (MTO).

====Combat operations====
=====North Africa and Italy 1943−1944=====
The 36th Division landed in French North Africa on 13 April 1943, and trained at Arzew and Rabat. However, the training was hampered by the need to supply guards for some 25,000 Axis prisoners of war (POWs) who had surrendered at the conclusion of the Tunisian campaign in May. It was assigned to Major General Ernest J. Dawley&#x27;s VI Corps, part of the Fifth Army, but attached to the Services of Supply, North African Theater of Operations, United States Army (NATOUSA), for supply. The 36th Division was originally intended to take part in the Allied invasion of Sicily, codenamed Operation Husky, but Lieutenant General George S. Patton the Seventh Army commander, preferred to use experienced troops instead and the 36th Division remained in North Africa. The Fifth Army was commanded by Lieutenant General Mark W. Clark, who knew the 36th Division well from his time as chief of staff to Lieutenant General Lesley J. McNair, commander of Army Ground Forces, and specifically chose the 36th Division, rather than the more experienced 34th Infantry Division, together with the British 46th and 56th Infantry Divisions, to spearhead the Allied assault landings at Salerno, Italy, which was given the codename of Operation Avalanche.

Having missed out on the fighting in Sicily, the division first saw action in the Italian campaign, landing at Salerno on 9 September 1943. It was the first U.S. combat unit to fight on the European continent when it landed by sea at Paestum and fought in the Battle of Salerno against intense German opposition. The Germans launched numerous fierce counterattacks on 12–14 September, but the 36th, which at one stage during the battle was holding a 35-mile sector of the front (six times more than a full-strength infantry division was able to hold), repulsed them with the aid of air support and naval gunfire, and, with the help of paratroopers of the 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment (part of the 82nd Airborne Division), advanced slowly, securing the area from Agropoli to Altavilla. After sustaining over 4,000 casualties in its first major action, the division spent the next few weeks behind the lines, where it remained in the Fifth Army reserve, absorbing replacements and training for future combat operations. Despite the heavy losses, the 36th Division was considered to have fought well, and four men were awarded the Medal of Honor.

The 36th Division returned to combat in mid-November, after six weeks of rest, now under Major General Geoffrey Keyes&#x27; II Corps command. It captured Mount Maggiore, Mount Lungo, and the village of San Pietro despite strong enemy positions and severe winter weather. This grueling campaign against the Bernhardt Line was marked by futile attempts to establish a secure bridgehead across the Gari River, erroneously identified as the Rapido on 1 January 1944, to 8 February. The division attacked across the Gari River on 20 January but was harshly repulsed by the 15th &quot;Panzergrenadier&quot; Division. The 141st and 143rd Infantry Regiments were virtually destroyed, and the attack was stopped on 22 January. In 48 hours, the 36th Division had sustained 1,681 casualties, 143 of them killed, 663 wounded, and 875 missing, out of almost 6,000 men who took part. Many of the casualties consisted of newly-arrived replacements who were poorly integrated into their units. German losses were minimal, with only 64 killed and a further 179 wounded. A company commander in the 143rd Infantry said, &quot;I had 184 men. Forty-eight hours later, I had 17. If that&#x27;s not mass murder, I don&#x27;t know what is.&quot; 36th Division losses until the end of January 1944 were 2,255 battle casualties and 2,009 non-battle casualties, with the combat effectiveness of the 141st and 143rd Infantry Regiments severely diminished.

Strong controversy flared among the officers of the division. Lieutenant General Clark, the Fifth Army commander, was severely criticized for having ordered a difficult frontal attack, and was accused of having caused the disaster. After the war Congress, urged on by veterans of the division, conducted an investigation into the causes and responsibility for the defeat on the Gari River. Clark was absolved of blame and he personally believed the attack to be necessary, in order to attract German reserves from northern Italy to prevent their use at Anzio, where an amphibious assault, codenamed Operation Shingle, was being launched by Anglo-American forces in an attempt to outflank the Winter Line, capture the Italian capital of Rome, and potentially force a German withdrawal away from their formidable Winter Line defenses. However, the German reserves identified in northern Italy had already been drawn forward onto the front of the British X Corps during the First Battle of Monte Cassino a few days before, thus making the 36th Division&#x27;s assault unnecessary, although this was unknown to Clark at the time.

After assisting the 34th Infantry Division in the attack on Cassino and fighting defensively along the Gari River, the severely depleted 36th withdrew from the line on 12 March, for rest and recreation. The division arrived by sea at the Anzio beachhead on 22 May, under the command of Major General Lucian Truscott&#x27;s VI Corps, to take part in Operation Diadem, with the breakout from the beachhead commencing the following day. It drove north to capture Velletri on 1 June, and entered Rome on 5 June 1944, the day before the Normandy landings. Pushing up from Rome, the 36th encountered sharp resistance at Magliano, but reached Piombino on 26 June, before moving back to Paestum for rest and recreation. In July Major General Walker, who had commanded the 36th Division since September 1941, was replaced by Major General John E. Dahlquist.

=====Western Europe 1944−1945=====
On 15 August 1944, as part of the U.S. 6th Army Group, the division made another amphibious assault landing, against light opposition in the Saint-Raphaël-Fréjus area of southern France as part of Operation Dragoon, the Allied invasion of Southern France. A rapid advance opened the Rhone River Valley. Montelimar fell, 28 August, and large German units were trapped. The division reached Lyon on 3rd September and Bourg-en-Bresse the 4th.On 15 September, the division was attached to the French First Army. The 36th advanced to the Moselle River at Remiremont and the foothills of the Vosges. On 30 September, the 442nd Regimental Combat Team (442nd RCT, a Japanese-American unit) was assigned to the 36th to help shore up the division. The 442nd was subsequently used to spearhead the capture towns of Bruyères and Biffontaine where they faced stiff opposition. On 24 October the 143rd Infantry relieved the 100th and 3rd Battalion who were sent to Belmont, another small town to the north, for some short-lived rest. On 23 October the 1st Battalion, 141st Infantry were cut off just beyond the town or Biffontaine. On 27 October the 442nd RCT was called back in to save this Lost Battalion. On the afternoon of 30 October 3rd Battalion broke through and reached 1st Battalion, 141st, rescuing 211 T-Patchers at the cost of 800 men in five days. However, the fighting continued for the 442nd as they moved past the 141st Infantry. The drive continued until they reached Saint-Die on 17 November when they were finally pulled back. The 100th fielded 1,432 men shortly before, but was now down to 239 infantrymen and 21 officers. The 2nd Battalion was down to 316 riflemen and 17 officers, while not a single company in the 3rd Battalion had over 100 riflemen; the entire 100th/442nd Regimental Combat Team was down to less than 800 soldiers. On 13 October 1944, when attached to the 36th Infantry Division, the unit was at 2,943 rifleman and officers, but in only three weeks 140 were killed and 1,800 were wounded, while 43 were missing. For this action, the 442nd RCT would earn 3 of its 7 Presidential Unit Citations.

In a grinding offensive, the division crossed the Meurthe River, breached the Ste. Marie Pass and burst into the Alsatian Plains. The enemy counterattacked, 13 December 1944, but the 36th held the perimeter of the Colmar Pocket. Two days later, the division was released from attachment to the French First Army, and returned to the control of VI Corps, now under Major General Edward H. Brooks, under the Seventh Army, commanded by Lieutenant General Alexander Patch. The German counterattacks out of the &quot;Colmar Pocket&quot; were so fierce, that at times, the field artillery was forced to fire over open sights at point blank range to stop them. On 20 December 1944, the division resumed the attack, advancing northward along the Rhine River to Mannheim meeting heavy resistance at Haguenau, Oberhöfen, and Wissembourg. In this action Company &quot;G&quot; of the 143rd Infantry received a Presidential Unit Citation. On 27 December 1944, the division was reassigned to Major General Frank W. Milburn&#x27;s XXI Corps of the Seventh Army, and was pinched out and returned to Seventh Army reserve on 30 December 1944. During these battles in France the division had the highest rate of desertion out of any division in the American Army.

The division was taken out of the line for the first time since it had landed in the south of France. On 3 January 1945, the division was reassigned to Major General Wade H. Haislip&#x27;s XV Corps. In January 1945, the division was reassigned to VI Corps. It returned to the line early March. The 36th was reassigned to the Seventh Army on 29 March 1945, and moved to the Danube River on 22 April 1945. The 36th Division has been recognized as a liberating unit for its work securing the subcamps of the Dachau concentration camp system.

The 36th Division was reassigned to the XXI Corps on 27 April 1945, and attacked the Künzelsau area on the 30th. Members of the 36th Division&#x27;s 142nd Infantry arriving as reinforcements on 5 May tipped the Battle for Castle Itter in favor of a combined U.S. Army/Wehrmacht defense against a Waffen SS attack, the only time German and American forces fought side by side in World War II.

The 36th Division was responsible for the capture of Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring, Former Commander in Chief of Luftwaffe who handed himself to the Division on 6th of May, 1945. 

By 8 May 1945, otherwise known as Victory in Europe Day (VE-Day), the 36th Division was based in Kitzbühel, Austria where it captured &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot;- Gerd von Rundstedt, the commander of all German Armed Forces on the Western Front, and its final station was at Kufstein, Austria on 14 August 1945.

After 400 days of combat, the 36th Infantry Division returned to the United States in December 1945. It was returned to the Texas Army National Guard on 15 December 1945.

=====The Lost Battalions=====

The 36th ID suffered significant losses during World War II, twice earning the distinction of having &quot;lost&quot; a battalion during the war.

The &quot;Lost Battalion&quot; refers to the 1st Battalion, 141st Infantry, which was surrounded by German forces in the Vosges Mountains on 24 October 1944.

They would be rescued by the 442nd Regimental Combat Team, a segregated unit composed of second-generation Japanese Americans. In five days of battle, over 800 men of the 442nd gave their lives in order to break through German defenses and rescue 211 survivors of the 141st.

Texas Governor John Connally would make the members of the 442nd honorary Texans in appreciation of their rescue of the 141st Infantry in 1962.

Earmarked as part of the reinforcements to U.S. Army troops in the Philippines, the 2nd Battalion, 131st Field Artillery, was detached from the 36th Infantry and deployed on 21 November 1941 to join in the Pacific War. The 131st took part in the Battle of Java and fought fiercely at Porong with several other Allied units until the battalion was captured by the Japanese in March 1942. Information on the unit&#x27;s fate was unknown and considered &quot;lost&quot; as details following the Dutch surrender in Java failed to reach the U.S. government.

As prisoners, the men were forced to work in Burma and Thailand on the Burma Railway of &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot; fame, as well as coal mines, docks and shipyards in Japan and other southeast Asian countries. Conditions were poor, treatment harsh, and mortality exceptionally high. It was only through debriefing of survivors from Japanese POW convoys who had been sunk and rescued by U.S. submarines in September 1944 that the U.S. government would learn of the unit&#x27;s fate.

Repatriated after the end of the war in August 1945, the surviving POWs of the lost battalion were scattered throughout Southeast Asia in Java, Singapore, Burma, Thailand, French Indo China, Japan, China and Manchuria.

===Global War on Terror===

On 1 May 2004, the 49th Armored Division of the Texas Army National Guard was officially inactivated and the 49th Armored Division was redesignated the 36th Infantry Division. After half a century, the &quot;Fighting 36th&quot; was reactivated and carried on the legacy of the 36th Division.
In January 2004, 74 soldiers from Alpha Battery (TAB), 2nd Battalion, 131st Field Artillery were activated for federal service in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Alpha Battery commanded by CPT Alvaro Gomez entered federal service in Fort Sill, OK. Under the supervision of 1SG Alfredo Barrera, the soldiers trained and deployed to Iraq. While readying their equipment in Kuwait, Alpha Battery was given her mission and the five radar sections were split up. One AN-TPQ37 radar section (SSG Gonzales) was attached to the 1st Marine Division in Al Taqadum another (CW4 Earnest Metcalf) was assigned to the 1st Infantry Division at LSA Anaconda and the three AN-TPQ36 radar sections (CW2 Davidson, CW2 Bien, and SSG Johnson) were assigned to the 2nd Infantry Division in Mosul. The headquarters and support platoon (1LT Christopher Galvan) operated out of Forward Operating Base Freedom in northern Mosul. In addition to the target acquisition mission, the support platoon supplemented patrols conducted by the 25th Infantry Division Fires Brigade FIST Team and provided security for the FOB&#x27;s perimeter by manning the entrance gates and watch towers. At the conclusion of the battery&#x27;s deployment, its members were awarded 3 Bronze Star Medals, 1 Purple Heart Medal, 47 Army Commendation Medals, 74 Combat Action Badges, several memorandums of appreciation from command staff, and authorized to wear the unit shoulder sleeve insignia for wartime service from the 2nd Infantry Division, the 25th Infantry Division, the 36th Infantry Division, or the 1st Infantry Division.

In 2005 approximately 100 soldiers of the 36th Infantry Division deployed to Bosnia for Enduring Mission 3 which was a continuation from previous IFOR and SFOR missions. When Task Force Strike left Eagle Base in Tuzla late 2006, it marked the end of an American military maneuver presence in Bosnia which had existed for almost a decade after the Dayton Accords.

In 2005, over three thousand troops from the 56th BCT, 36th ID deployed to Iraq. The 3rd Battalion, 133rd Field Artillery Regiment and 2nd Battalion, 142nd Infantry Regiment were both awarded Meritorious Unit Citations for their service in Iraq.

In 2005–06, 800 soldiers of 3d Battalion, 141st Infantry Regiment, 72d Brigade, 36th Infantry Division deployed to Afghanistan. The battalion was attached to the 504th Infantry Regiment of the 82d Airborne Division and earned a Joint Meritorious Unit Citation.

In 2006, the 1st Squadron, 124th Cavalry Regiment, 36th Infantry Division became the first cavalry unit to serve as peacekeepers in the Sinai Desert for the Multinational Force and Observers. The force was made up of soldiers from several units of the 36th Infantry Division including 1–112th AR, 2–112th AR, 3–112th AR, 3rd Mech, and C Btry 2-131 FA (MLRS).

In late 2006, Company B of the 3d Battalion, 144th Infantry Regiment deployed to Iraq after pre-deployment training at Ft. Dix, NJ and were actively engaged in combat operations. They returned in late 2007. 5 Army Commendation Medals with Valor Devices were awarded to soldiers of 1st Platoon, Second Squad in recognition of the defeat of an ambush on a State Department convoy in central Baghdad.

In late 2005 to late 2006, the 36th Infantry Division was the major leading force for KFOR7, the peacekeeping mission on Kosovo.

The Combat Aviation Brigade, 36th Infantry Division shipped to Iraq in September 2006 for a planned one-year deployment.

On 7 May 2007 3d Battalion, 144th Infantry Regiment mobilized as &quot;Task Force Panther&quot; in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. &quot;Task Force Panther&quot; trained at Camp Shelby, MS, and, after validation, deployed to Kuwait, and then into Iraq.

On 28 August 2008, more than 3000 soldiers of the 56th IBCT again deployed to Iraq. On 15 August 2009, the 3000 soldiers of the 56th IBCT returned to Texas after 10 months in Iraq. Two soldiers from Bravo Troop 3-124 Cav, and one from C Btry 4-133 were wounded during the tour.

On 10 April 2009, 136th Military Police Battalion deployed more than 150 soldiers to Afghanistan to command and run the Bagram Theatre Internment Facility. Task Force Lonestar transferred the detainees from the BTIF to the new detention facility in Parwan. 136th Military Police Battalion returned in May 2010.

On 1 October 2009, the 72nd IBCT mobilized for deployment to Iraq. Upon arrival in theater, the brigade headquarters assumed authority as the Joint Area Support Group-Conditional for the International Zone, with the brigade&#x27;s subordinate elements distributed throughout the country conducting detainee operations. The brigade returned from Iraq in July and August 2010, with A Battery, 1-133 FA being the last element to return home.

In November and December 2010, the 36th Infantry Division Headquarters deployed to Basrah, Iraq, replacing the US 1st Infantry Division, where they provided command and control of US active Army, Reserve, and National Guard units. The 36th ID command covered 15,000 deployed military and contractor forces at 17 bases in the 9 provinces in southern Iraq. As part of the drawdown of US forces in Iraq, the division headquarters redeployed to the US starting in late August 2011, the main body following in September 2011 to Fort Hood, TX. No 36th ID soldiers were lost to combat operations during the deployment.

On 26 November 2011, the newly formed 1st Battalion (Airborne), 143rd Infantry Regiment mobilized as Task Force Walker for deployment to Afghanistan. The battalion, comprising companies from Texas, Rhode Island, and Alaska, was deployed across the country in support of provincial reconstruction teams. The headquarters element was located in Kabul serving under the 648th Maneuver Enhancement Brigade (Task Force Hydra) in the Kabul base cluster.

In the summer of 2012, both the 136th Maneuver Enhancement Brigade (MEB) and Task Force Arrowhead mobilized for service in Afghanistan. The 136th MEB took control of several bases in the Kabul area, while TF Arrowhead, composed of 31 security force assistance teams (SFATs), performed advisory duties with various Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) elements in Regional Command-South.

Also in the summer of 2012 the 3rd Battalion, C &amp; D Company 144th Infantry regiment from the 56th BCT deployed to Afghanistan (RC West) as Task Force Bowie. TF Bowie provided Battalion Command Base Security, including but not limited to presences/combat patrols, assessment missions, checkpoint control and flight line security for Shindand Airbase and surrounding areas. Shindand Air Base is located in the western part of Afghanistan in the Herat province, 7 miles northeast of the city of Sabzwar. Other areas of operations included Herat city, as well as RC North. In the fall of 2012 a small detachment was sent to RC North to assist in base security operations in coordination with small regiment from the 3rd ID.

In the spring of 2013 B co 3-144th IN deployed in support of TF 3–10 to Afghanistan and served in Konduz, Kabul, Mazar-e-Sharif Camp Bashton, and BAF

In Afghanistan, 36th has deployed agricultural development teams helping build farming infrastructure, as well as security forces advising teams training Afghan national security forces to promote long-term success of the Afghan government.

The 36th Infantry Division is the first National Guard Division to command an active duty brigade as part of the Army&#x27;s total force policy. This allows the active and reserve units to train together as they are preparing to fight together.

Currently, the 36th is in charge of an Afghanistan theatre; They will be in charge for 18 months (Two 9-month rotations). This is the first time a National Guard division has been in charge of an Afghanistan theatre this long.

During the Global War on Terror, the 36th ID has been involved in numerous military operations including Operation New Dawn, Enduring Freedom, Freedom&#x27;s Sentinel, and Jump Start.

In February 2018, &quot;Army Times&quot; reported the 36th was deployed to Iraq to assist Iraqi forces against Islamic State.

The deployment coincided with Kuwait&#x27;s 30th Liberation Day, tasking the 36th Infantry Division with maintaining and continuing the United States&#x27; partnership and allied strength with Kuwait, culminating in a self-described complex live-fire exercise.

==Insignia &amp; Song==
An insignia consisting of an olive drab &quot;T&quot; on a light blue flint arrowhead was adopted by the 36th Division in 1918. Light blue is the infantry branch color. The flint arrowhead represents the State of Oklahoma (once the Indian Territory) and the &quot;T&quot;, Texas and commonly called the &quot;T-Patch.&quot;

<text>The Rapido is a short river ( ) which flows in the Italian province of Frosinone. The river is known for the Battle of the Rapido River, despite it actually occurring on the Gari River.

Its source is close to the border between Lazio and Molise on the slopes of the Mainarde mountains. The river bathes the commune of Sant&#x27;Elia Fiumerapido after which it becomes known as the Gari.

Fed by numerous karstic springs, the river has a relatively high and reliable discharge: 25 m³/s on average and never dropping below 10 m³/s.

<text>Sir Alfred Chester Beatty (7 February 1875 – 19 January 1968) was an American-British mining magnate and philanthropist. A successful businessman, Beatty was given the epithet &quot;the King of Copper&quot; in reference to his fortune. He became a naturalised British subject in 1933, was knighted in 1954, and was made an honorary citizen of Ireland in 1957.

He collected African, Asian, European and Middle Eastern manuscripts, rare printed books, prints and objets d&#x27;art. After moving to Dublin in 1950, he established the Chester Beatty Library on Shrewsbury Road to house his collection; it opened to the public in 1954. The collections were bequeathed to the Irish people and entrusted to the care of the state in his Irish will. He donated several papyrus documents to the British Museum, his second wife&#x27;s (Edith Dunn Beatty) collection of Marie Antoinette&#x27;s personal furniture to the Louvre and a number of his personal paintings that once hung in the picture gallery of his London home to the National Gallery of Ireland. He also made possible the expansion and relocation of the Cancer Research Institute, which was renamed the Chester Beatty Institute, and later renamed the Institute of Cancer Research, in 1939.

==Early life==
A. Chester Beatty, known to friends and family as Chester or &quot;Chet&quot;, was born into a middle-class New York family in 1875 on the site of what is now Rockefeller Center, the youngest of three sons, Chester, Robert and Gedney. He was born to Hetty and John Beatty, a banker and stockbroker.

He graduated from Columbia School of Mines in 1898 and bought a one-way train ticket to Denver, Colorado. His first job in the mines earned him $2 per day as a &quot;mucker&quot;, clearing away rock and soil from mine tunnels. He was quickly promoted to supervisor of the Kektonga Silver Mine.

His first mentor was T. A. Rickard, a mining engineer. Rickard also introduced Beatty to his sister-in-law, Grace &quot;Ninette&quot; Rickard, whom Beatty married in Denver in 1900. In 1903 he joined John Hayes Hammond on the management team of the Guggenheim Exploration Company. This position soon made Beatty wealthy. In 1908, when he left the Guggenheims, he was regarded as one of the country&#x27;s leading mining engineers.

He bought a house on the East Side of New York and set up an office on Broadway as an independent mining consultant. Ninette and their daughter (little Ninette) joined him during the summer of 1907, and in October their son, Chester Jr, was born.

In 1911, Grace died suddenly of typhoid fever. In 1912 he purchased Baroda House in Kensington Palace Gardens and moved with his two young children to London the following year. Shortly after the move, he married his second wife, Edith Dunn, in the Kensington Registry Office. He and Edith were both avid collectors.

In 1914, Beatty founded the London-based mining company, Selection Trust. The First World War delayed the company&#x27;s expansion, but during the 1920s the business expanded to acquire interests in countries including the USSR, the Gold Coast (present-day Ghana) and the Colony and Protectorate of Sierra Leone.

Beatty made his fortune in Northern Rhodesia (present-day Zambia) and the Belgian Congo (present-day Democratic Republic of Congo), where he exploited the Copper Belt. For this, he became known as the &quot;King of Copper&quot;.

==Collector==
An early family anecdote recalls that, as a young boy, Chester caught the collection bug, bidding at auction for mining samples. He recalled attending an auction with his father at the age of ten, and bidding 10 cents on a piece of pink calcite. During his time in Denver he began collecting stamps, which grew into an award-winning collection. Before his move to London he had already started collecting Chinese snuff bottles and Japanese netsuke, inro and tsuba.

Due to a condition of the lungs called silicosis, which he had acquired through his years working in American mines, Beatty and his family would winter in Egypt, until the outbreak of World War II, and after the war in the south of France. During his first trip to Cairo in the winter of 1913/14, he became interested in papyrus and Islamic manuscripts.

In 1931 an announcement in &quot;The Times&quot; cast Beatty as a great collector. He had acquired an important collection of Biblical manuscripts, now known as the Chester Beatty Biblical Papyri. The discovery changed the existing understanding of pre-Constantinian textual history. With the New Testament books – Gospels and Acts (BP I), Pauline Epistles (BP II) and Revelation (BP III) – all dated to the third century, these documents were not only surprising for having survived the Diocletian persecutions at the beginning of the next century, but the dating moved New Testament scholarship back by at least one hundred years. The dating specifically of BP I (p45) to the mid-third century moved the understanding of when Christians accepted the four gospels as canonical to earlier than had previously been presumed.

In 1917, recovering from a bout of pneumonia and Spanish influenza, Beatty, Edith and his daughter Ninette, traveled by boat to Japan and China. During this trip he acquired painted albums and scrolls and he continued to purchase Chinese, Japanese and south-east Asian manuscripts, textiles and artefacts for the rest of his life.

Beatty&#x27;s reputation as a collector grew, and so did his network of advisers and agents. As in his business life, Beatty relied on the advice of experienced specialists but made the final decision on any purchase himself. By this time Edith was also establishing herself as a serious collector in her own right. While she was buying Impressionist and Post-Impressionist paintings and French furniture, Beatty was acquiring important Islamic material, including an exceptional collection of illuminated copies of the Quran, and Mughal, Turkish and Persian manuscripts. His Western holdings were enhanced by acquisitions of Coptic, Syriac, Armenian and Greek manuscripts. To his Asian holdings he added Tibetan, Thai, Burmese and Sumatran manuscripts. His eye was drawn to richly illustrated material, fine bindings and beautiful calligraphy, but he was also deeply committed to preserving texts for their historic value. He concerned himself only with works of the finest quality, and this became the hallmark of his collection.

Initially, Beatty was a competitive force in the burgeoning Orientalist art market of the early 20th century. The major library and museum institutions anticipated his presence when prospecting acquisitions. However, in 1925, Beatty began what would later become a robust partnership with the British Museum. Though in later cases he would purchase an object and simply donate it, for the manuscript now known as the Minto Album, Beatty amicably agreed to split the folios. The lot was sold to Sir Eric Maclagan, Director of the British Museum, as part of a joint-purchase agreement with Beatty for $3,950. Beatty had first pick of the folios, the museum bought the remainder for $2000, and Beatty charitably donated an additional folio. The Beattys were also patrons of the British Museum, donating 19 ancient Egyptian papyri to the Museum.

Between 1939 and 1949, Beatty acquired over 140 nineteenth-century paintings to display in the picture gallery of his London home. The gallery had been built as a result of the conversion of the stables to a library in 1934; the gallery linked the main house to the garden library. In 1940, Beatty packed up the paintings and shipped them to New York for safekeeping during the Second World War. In 1949, Beatty decided to donate part of his collection of French nineteenth-century paintings to the Irish nation as a token of appreciation to the Taoiseach of the day, John A. Costello, for his support in facilitating Beatty&#x27;s move from London. These are now part of the collection of the National Gallery of Ireland. One of the paintings was an idealized version of peasant life called &quot;The Gleaners&quot; by Jules Breton.

==Move to Dublin==
Beatty had supported the war effort, contributing a large amount of raw materials to the Allies. He received a belated knighthood by Queen Elizabeth II in the 1954 Birthday Honours List for his contribution to the wartime effort.

By the late 1940s, however, he had become disillusioned with Britain. Political deviations from his free-market values, coupled with increased foreign exchange restrictions impacted both his personal and collecting interests in Britain. Though he had initially envisioned deepening his relationship with the British Museum by donating his collection in its entirety (he had personally funded many of the museum acquisitions, and received expert consultations from the curators), he changed his mind when the new director insisted on deciding for himself whether Beatty&#x27;s collection met the museum&#x27;s quality standards. The director also would not assure Beatty that his collection would remain intact, rather than being parcelled out to different departments.

He bought a large townhouse for himself on Ailesbury Road in the Ballsbridge area of Dublin, and a site on nearby Shrewsbury Road, also in Ballsbridge, for the construction of the Chester Beatty Library. The library, which housed his collection, opened on 8 August 1953. It was moved to its current location at Dublin Castle in 2000.

Beatty spent the remainder of his life between Dublin and the south of France. He was made a Freeman of Dublin in 1954 and was the first person granted honorary citizenship of Ireland in 1957. He continued to collect in the 1950s and 1960s, acquiring important Ethiopian manuscripts and Japanese printed material during that period.

Beatty died in Monte Carlo in Monaco in 1968; his Irish estate was valued at £7 million. He was accorded a state funeral by the Irish government – the first private citizen in Irish history to receive such an honour. He is buried in Glasnevin Cemetery in Dublin.

The Chester Beatty Library on Shrewsbury Road and the collection it housed was bequeathed to a trust on behalf of the people of Ireland. In 2000, it opened in its current location: the eighteenth-century Clock Tower building in the grounds of Dublin Castle.

==Personal life and descendants==
In 1900, in Denver, Beatty married Grace Madeleine &#x27;Ninette&#x27; Rickard (1879–1911), the sister-in-law of his mentor T. A. Rickard. They had two children: a daughter, Ninette (1901–1962), and a son, Chester Jr (1907–1983). In 1911, Grace &#x27;Ninette&#x27; Beatty died of typhoid fever. In 1912, Chester Beatty bought a house in Kensington Palace Gardens (&#x27;Baroda House&#x27;), London, and moved there with his two children in the spring of 1913. In June 1913, he married Edith Dunn Stone (1886–1952) in the Kensington Registry Office. Edith Beatty was a racehorse owner and breeder, and well-known for her collection of Impressionist, Post-Impressionist and Modernist paintings, antique French furniture and objet d&#x27;art.

In 1929, in Westminster Cathedral, Chester&#x27;s daughter Ninette Beatty married Captain Edward Newling. A daughter, Anne, was born in Marylebone in 1930.

In 1933, Chester Beatty Jr married Elizabeth Pamela Belas. They had one daughter, Sarah Anne Chester Beatty.

Chester Beatty Jr married for a second time to Enid Groome, daughter of Stanley Hugh Groome, in 1938.

In 1956, Beatty Jr&#x27;s daughter Sarah married David Greville, Earl Brooke, heir to the Warwick Castle estate, and had two children, Guy Greville, 9th Earl of Warwick (born 1957), and Lady Charlotte Greville (1958), both of whom have children.

<doc id="200877" wikidata="Q2907187" url="?curid=200877" title="Maze generation algorithm">
<text>Maze generation algorithms are automated methods for the creation of mazes.

== Graph theory based methods ==

A maze can be generated by starting with a predetermined arrangement of cells (most commonly a rectangular grid but other arrangements are possible) with wall sites between them. This predetermined arrangement can be considered as a connected graph with the edges representing possible wall sites and the nodes representing cells. The purpose of the maze generation algorithm can then be considered to be making a subgraph in which it is challenging to find a route between two particular nodes.

If the subgraph is not connected, then there are regions of the graph that are wasted because they do not contribute to the search space. If the graph contains loops, then there may be multiple paths between the chosen nodes. Because of this, maze generation is often approached as generating a random spanning tree. Loops, which can confound naive maze solvers, may be introduced by adding random edges to the result during the course of the algorithm.

The animation shows the maze generation steps for a 
graph that is not on a rectangular grid.
First, the computer creates a random planar graph G
shown in blue, and its dual F
shown in yellow. Second, the computer traverses F using a chosen
algorithm, such as a depth-first search, coloring the path red.
During the traversal, whenever a red edge crosses over a blue edge,
the blue edge is removed.
Finally, when all vertices of F have been visited, F is erased
and two edges from G, one for the entrance and one for the exit, are removed.

=== Randomized depth-first search ===

This algorithm, also known as the &quot;recursive backtracker&quot; algorithm, is a randomized version of the depth-first search algorithm.

Frequently implemented with a stack, this approach is one of the simplest ways to generate a maze using a computer. Consider the space for a maze being a large grid of cells (like a large chess board), each cell starting with four walls. Starting from a random cell, the computer then selects a random neighbouring cell that has not yet been visited. The computer removes the wall between the two cells and marks the new cell as visited, and adds it to the stack to facilitate backtracking. The computer continues this process, with a cell that has no unvisited neighbours being considered a dead-end. When at a dead-end it backtracks through the path until it reaches a cell with an unvisited neighbour, continuing the path generation by visiting this new, unvisited cell (creating a new junction). This process continues until every cell has been visited, causing the computer to backtrack all the way back to the beginning cell. We can be sure every cell is visited.

As given above this algorithm involves deep recursion which may cause stack overflow issues on some computer architectures. The algorithm can be rearranged into a loop by storing backtracking information in the maze itself. This also provides a quick way to display a solution, by starting at any given point and backtracking to the beginning.

Mazes generated with a depth-first search have a low branching factor and contain many long corridors, because the algorithm explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

==== Recursive implementation ====

The depth-first search algorithm of maze generation is frequently implemented using backtracking. This can be described with a following recursive routine:

# Given a current cell as a parameter
# Mark the current cell as visited
# While the current cell has any unvisited neighbour cells
## Choose one of the unvisited neighbours
## Remove the wall between the current cell and the chosen cell
## Invoke the routine recursively for the chosen cell

which is invoked once for any initial cell in the area.

==== Iterative implementation (with stack) ====
A disadvantage of the first approach is a large depth of recursion – in the worst case, the routine may need to recur on every cell of the area being processed, which may exceed the maximum recursion stack depth in many environments. As a solution, the same backtracking method can be implemented with an explicit stack, which is usually allowed to grow much bigger with no harm.

# Choose the initial cell, mark it as visited and push it to the stack
# While the stack is not empty
## Pop a cell from the stack and make it a current cell
## If the current cell has any neighbours which have not been visited
### Push the current cell to the stack
### Choose one of the unvisited neighbours
### Remove the wall between the current cell and the chosen cell
### Mark the chosen cell as visited and push it to the stack

=== Iterative randomized Kruskal&#x27;s algorithm (with sets) ===

This algorithm is a randomized version of Kruskal&#x27;s algorithm.

# Create a list of all walls, and create a set for each cell, each containing just that one cell.
# For each wall, in some random order:
## If the cells divided by this wall belong to distinct sets:
### Remove the current wall.
### Join the sets of the formerly divided cells.

There are several data structures that can be used to model the sets of cells. An efficient implementation using a disjoint-set data structure can perform each union and find operation on two sets in nearly constant amortized time (specifically, formula_1 time; formula_2 for any plausible value of formula_3), so the running time of this algorithm is essentially proportional to the number of walls available to the maze.

It matters little whether the list of walls is initially randomized or if a wall is randomly chosen from a nonrandom list, either way is just as easy to code.

Because the effect of this algorithm is to produce a minimal spanning tree from a graph with equally weighted edges, it tends to produce regular patterns which are fairly easy to solve.

=== Iterative randomized Prim&#x27;s algorithm (without stack, without sets) ===

This algorithm is a randomized version of Prim&#x27;s algorithm.

# Start with a grid full of walls.
# Pick a cell, mark it as part of the maze. Add the walls of the cell to the wall list.
# While there are walls in the list:
## Pick a random wall from the list. If only one of the cells that the wall divides is visited, then:
### Make the wall a passage and mark the unvisited cell as part of the maze.
### Add the neighboring walls of the cell to the wall list.
## Remove the wall from the list.

Note that simply running classical Prim&#x27;s on a graph with random edge weights would create mazes stylistically identical to Kruskal&#x27;s, because they are both minimal spanning tree algorithms. Instead, this algorithm introduces stylistic variation because the edges closer to the starting point have a lower effective weight.

==== Modified version ====
Although the classical Prim&#x27;s algorithm keeps a list of edges, for maze generation we could instead maintain a list of adjacent cells. If the randomly chosen cell has multiple edges that connect it to the existing maze, select one of these edges at random. This will tend to branch slightly more than the edge-based version above.

==== Simplified version ====
The algorithm can be simplified even further by randomly selecting cells that neighbour already-visited cells, rather than keeping track of the weights of all cells or edges.

It will usually be relatively easy to find the way to the starting cell, but hard to find the way anywhere else.

=== Wilson&#x27;s algorithm ===

All the above algorithms have biases of various sorts: depth-first search is biased toward long corridors, while Kruskal&#x27;s/Prim&#x27;s algorithms are biased toward many short dead ends. Wilson&#x27;s algorithm, on the other hand, generates an &quot;unbiased&quot; sample from the uniform distribution over all mazes, using loop-erased random walks.

We begin the algorithm by initializing the maze with one cell chosen arbitrarily. Then we start at a new cell chosen arbitrarily, and perform a random walk until we reach a cell already in the maze—however, if at any point the random walk reaches its own path, forming a loop, we erase the loop from the path before proceeding. When the path reaches the maze, we add it to the maze. Then we perform another loop-erased random walk from another arbitrary starting cell, repeating until all cells have been filled.

This procedure remains unbiased no matter which method we use to arbitrarily choose starting cells. So we could always choose the first unfilled cell in (say) left-to-right, top-to-bottom order for simplicity.

=== Aldous-Broder algorithm ===

The Aldous-Broder algorithm also produces uniform spanning trees. However, it is one of the least efficient maze algorithms.

# Pick a random cell as the current cell and mark it as visited. 
# While there are unvisited cells: 
## Pick a random neighbour. 
## If the chosen neighbour has not been visited: 
### Remove the wall between the current cell and the chosen neighbour. 
### Mark the chosen neighbour as visited. 
## Make the chosen neighbour the current cell.

===Recursive division method===

Mazes can be created with &quot;recursive division&quot;, an algorithm which works as follows: Begin with the maze&#x27;s space with no walls. Call this a chamber. Divide the chamber with a randomly positioned wall (or multiple walls) where each wall contains a randomly positioned passage opening within it. Then recursively repeat the process on the subchambers until all chambers are minimum sized. This method results in mazes with long straight walls crossing their space, making it easier to see which areas to avoid.

For example, in a rectangular maze, build at random points two walls that are perpendicular to each other. These two walls divide the large chamber into four smaller chambers separated by four walls. Choose three of the four walls at random, and open a one cell-wide hole at a random point in each of the three. Continue in this manner recursively, until every chamber has a width of one cell in either of the two directions.

=== Fractal Tessellation algorithm ===

This is a simple and fast way to generate a maze.

On each iteration, this algorithm creates a maze twice the size by copying itself 3 times. At the end of each iteration, 3 paths are opened between the 4 smaller mazes.

The advantage of this method is that it is very fast. The downside is that it is not possible to get a maze of a chosen size - but various tricks can be used to get around this problem.

== Simple algorithms ==

Other algorithms exist that require only enough memory to store one line of a 2D maze or one plane of a 3D maze. Eller&#x27;s algorithm prevents loops by storing which cells in the current line are connected through cells in the previous lines, and never removes walls between any two cells already connected. The Sidewinder algorithm starts with an open passage along the entire top row, and subsequent rows consist of shorter horizontal passages with one connection to the passage above. The Sidewinder algorithm is trivial to solve from the bottom up because it has no upward dead ends. Given a starting width, both algorithms create perfect mazes of unlimited height.

Most maze generation algorithms require maintaining relationships between cells within it, to ensure the result will be solvable. Valid simply connected mazes can however be generated by focusing on each cell independently. A binary tree maze is a standard orthogonal maze where each cell always has a passage leading up or leading left, but never both. To create a binary tree maze, for each cell flip a coin to decide whether to add a passage leading up or left. Always pick the same direction for cells on the boundary, and the result will be a valid simply connected maze that looks like a binary tree, with the upper left corner its root. As with Sidewinder, the binary tree maze has no dead ends in the directions of bias.
A related form of flipping a coin for each cell is to create an image using a random mix of forward slash and backslash characters. This doesn&#x27;t generate a valid simply connected maze, but rather a selection of closed loops and unicursal passages. The manual for the Commodore 64 presents a BASIC program using this algorithm, using PETSCII diagonal line graphic characters instead for a smoother graphic appearance.

== Cellular automaton algorithms ==
Certain types of cellular automata can be used to generate mazes. Two well-known such cellular automata, Maze and Mazectric, have rulestrings B3/S12345 and B3/S1234. In the former, this means that cells survive from one generation to the next if they have at least one and at most five neighbours. In the latter, this means that cells survive if they have one to four neighbours. If a cell has exactly three neighbours, it is born. It is similar to Conway&#x27;s Game of Life in that patterns that do not have a living cell adjacent to 1, 4, or 5 other living cells in any generation will behave identically to it. However, for large patterns, it behaves very differently from Life.

For a random starting pattern, these maze-generating cellular automata will evolve into complex mazes with well-defined walls outlining corridors. Mazecetric, which has the rule B3/S1234 has a tendency to generate longer and straighter corridors compared with Maze, with the rule B3/S12345. Since these cellular automaton rules are deterministic, each maze generated is uniquely determined by its random starting pattern. This is a significant drawback since the mazes tend to be relatively predictable.

Like some of the graph-theory based methods described above, these cellular automata typically generate mazes from a single starting pattern; hence it will usually be relatively easy to find the way to the starting cell, but harder to find the way anywhere else.

<doc id="200880" wikidata="Q158232" url="?curid=200880" title="Prince Charles Alexander of Lorraine">
<text>Prince Charles Alexander Emanuel of Lorraine (; ; 12 December 1712 in Lunéville – 4 July 1780 in Tervuren) was a Lorraine-born Austrian general and soldier, field marshal of the Imperial Army, and governor of the Austrian Netherlands.

==Early life==
Charles was the son of Leopold, Duke of Lorraine, and Élisabeth Charlotte d&#x27;Orléans. When his elder brother Francis III, Duke of Lorraine, married the Archduchess Maria Theresa, daughter of Emperor Charles VI, Charles Alexander entered the Imperial service in 1737.

When his brother Francis traded the Duchy of Lorraine to the ex-Polish king Stanisław Leszczyński in exchange for the Grand Duchy of Tuscany as one of the terms ending the War of the Polish Succession in November 1738, the ducal title to Lorraine and Bar passed beyond Charles to King Louis XV of France upon Leszczynski&#x27;s death in 1766, though Francis and his successors retained the right to style themselves as dukes of Lorraine and Bar. 

On 7 January 1744 he married Maria Theresa&#x27;s only sister, Archduchess Maria Anna of Austria, thus making him doubly Maria Theresa&#x27;s brother-in-law. The couple were jointly made Governors of the Austrian Netherlands (now Belgium).

Although Maria Anna died later the same year after marriage, Charles&#x27; popularity and lack of clear replacement allowed him to continue as governor and de facto sovereign until his own death in 1780. Charles also became Grand Master of the Teutonic Order in 1761.

During the War of the Austrian Succession, he was one of the principal Austrian military commanders. He was most notable for his defeats by better trained and superior forces under Frederick the Great. At the Battle of Chotusitz in 1742, his forces lost the battle but were able to inflict greater loss of life and retreat in good order. However, he lost more decisively to Frederick at the Battle of Hohenfriedberg and the Battle of Soor in 1745. He was also defeated by Maurice de Saxe at the Battle of Rocoux in 1746.
==Seven Years&#x27; War==
Despite his record of defeats, he was able to retain his position. He was able to attain command ahead of the more popular Marshal Browne because of the support of his brother who had significant influence over military appointments. During Austria&#x27;s Third Silesian War against Prussia (part of the wider Seven Years&#x27; War), he commanded the Imperial Army at the Battle of Prague, where he was again defeated by Frederick the Great, king in Prussia, but was able to inflict heavy casualties on the larger Prussian forces. He subsequently defeated a much smaller Prussian army in 1757 at the Battle of Breslau before being completely routed by Frederick the Great at the Battle of Leuthen, which is considered one of Frederick&#x27;s most brilliant victories. During the battle, he was commander of the Imperial Army as appointed by Maria Theresa.

At Leuthen, the Austrians were overwhelmingly defeated by an army half their size, with fewer guns, and tired after a long march over 12 days. Charles and his second in command, Count Leopold Joseph von Daun, sank &quot;in the depths of despondency&quot;, and the Prince could not fathom what had happened. Charles had a mixed record against Frederick in past encounters but had never fared so badly as at Leuthen. After this crushing defeat, Maria Theresa replaced him with Daun; Charles retired from military service and subsequently served as the governor of the Austrian Netherlands. Though an unsuccessful military leader, Charles proved to be a competent administrator, well-liked by the population. Under him, the Austrian Netherlands flourished, and he was deeply involved in the cultural life of his province.

==Family and private life==
Because Charles ruled by right of his marriage to Maria Anna of Austria, Maria Anna&#x27;s death very shortly after marriage created a situation in which his mistress Elisabeth de Vaux and their children had to be kept secret. His children were to present themselves only under the surnames of their mothers in public if they were in the Netherlands.

Though there is obscurity about his private affairs after the death of Maria Anna, it is known that from his mistress Elisabeth de Vaux, Charles had a son, Charles Alexandre Guillaume Joseph, and a grandson through the same; a stillborn daughter by an unnamed mistress; a son, Charles Frédéric, by an unnamed mistress; a son, Jean Nicholas, and a daughter, Anne Françoise, by an unnamed mistress. With his mistress Regina Elisabeth Bartholotti von Porthenfeld (b.1725) he had a daughter, Maria Regina Johanna von Merey, later Baroness von Hackelberg-Landau (1744-1779). Some of his children were known to have lived in Dutch-speaking parts of Belgium temporarily or permanently. This included his first son Charles Alexandre Guillaume Joseph, who was later known to have returned to Lunéville in Lorraine to claim a substantial inheritance, and to have a son named Gustav Auguste in 1788. He died in Nancy.

==Architecture==
He had the Château de la Favorite (Lunéville) constructed as his retreat.

In Brussels, he had constructed the Palace of Charles of Lorraine. Also, he renovated Tervuren castle and the Château of Mariemont. Further, he commissioned the Château Charles in Tervuren.

<text>For nearly the entire history of film production, certain films have been banned by film censorship or review organizations for political or moral reasons or for controversial content, such as racism, copyright violation, and underage immorality. Censorship standards vary widely by country, and can vary within an individual country over time due to political or moral change.

Many countries have government-appointed or private commissions to censor and rate productions for film and television exhibition.

Generally speaking, the government itself cannot ban a film, since the United States Supreme Court ruled that films are protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution in a landmark 1950s decision. Instead of formal government censorship or bans, the film industry has, largely, policed itself through content-based ratings that are awarded to the vast majority of films that are to be publicly exhibited. Sometimes, a filmmaker may make edits to a film to avoid an &#x27;R-rating&#x27; or an &#x27;NC-17&#x27; rating, but a modern-day, government ban on a film would likely be struck down by the courts.
