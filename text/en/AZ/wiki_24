<text>Synapsida is a diverse group of tetrapod vertebrates that includes all mammals and their extinct relatives. It is one of the two major clades of the group Amniota, the other being the more diverse group Sauropsida (which includes all extant reptiles and birds). Unlike other amniotes, synapsids have a single temporal fenestra, an opening low in the skull roof behind each eye socket, leaving a bony arch beneath each; this accounts for the name &quot;synapsid&quot;. The distinctive temporal fenestra developed about 318 million years ago during the Late Carboniferous period, when synapsids and sauropsids diverged, but was subsequently merged with the orbit in early mammals.

The basal amniotes (reptiliomorphs) from which synapsids evolved were historically simply called &quot;reptiles&quot;. Therefore, stem group synapsids were then described as mammal-like reptiles in classical systematics, and non-therapsid synapsids were also referred to as [[pelycosaur]]s or pelycosaur-[[evolutionary grade|grade]] synapsids. These paraphyletic terms have now fallen out of favor and are only used informally (if at all) in modern literature, as it is now known that all &quot;extant&quot; reptiles are more closely related to each other and birds than to synapsids, so the word &quot;reptile&quot; has been re-defined to mean only members of Sauropsida or even just an under-clade thereof. In a cladistic sense, synapsids are in fact a monophyletic sister taxon of sauropsids, rather than a part of the sauropsid lineage. Therefore, calling synapsids &quot;mammal-like reptiles&quot; is incorrect under the &quot;new&quot; definition of &quot;reptile&quot;, so they are now referred to as stem mammals, proto-mammals, paramammals or pan-mammals. Most lineages of pelycosaur-grade synapsids were replaced by the more advanced therapsids, which evolved from sphenacodontoid pelycosaurs, at the end of the Early Permian during the so-called Olson&#x27;s Extinction.

Synapsids were the largest terrestrial vertebrates in the Permian period (299 to 251 mya), rivalled only by some large pareiasaurian parareptiles such as &quot;Scutosaurus&quot;. They were the dominant land predators of the late Paleozoic and early Mesozoic, with eupelycosaurs such as &quot;Dimetrodon&quot;, &quot;Titanophoneus&quot; and &quot;Inostrancevia&quot; being the apex predators during the Permian, and theriodonts such as &quot;Moschorhinus&quot; during the Early Triassic. Synapsid population and diversity were severely reduced by the Capitanian mass extinction event and the Permian–Triassic extinction event, and only two groups of therapsids, the dicynodonts and eutheriodonts (consisting of therocephalians and cynodonts) are known to have survived into the Triassic. These therapsids rebounded as disaster taxa during the early Mesozoic, with the dicynodont &quot;Lystrosaurus&quot; making up as much as 95% of all land species at one time, but declined again after the Smithian–Spathian boundary event with their dominant niches largely taken over by the rise of archosaurian sauropsids, first by the pseudosuchians and then by the pterosaurs and dinosaurs. The cynodont group Probainognathia, which includes the group Mammaliaformes, were the only synapsids to survive beyond the Triassic, and mammals are the only synapsid lineage that have survived past the Jurassic, having lived mostly nocturnally to avoid competition with dinosaurs. After the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction wiped out all non-avian dinosaurs and pterosaurs, synapsids (as mammals) rose to dominance once again during the Cenozoic.

==Linnaean and cladistic classifications==

At the turn of the 20th century, synapsids were thought to be one of the four main subclasses of reptiles. However, this notion was disproved upon closer inspection of skeletal remains, as synapsids are differentiated from reptiles by their distinctive temporal openings. These openings in the skull bones allowed the attachment of larger jaw muscles, hence a more efficient bite.

Synapsids were subsequently considered to be a later reptilian lineage that became mammals by gradually evolving increasingly mammalian features, hence the name &quot;mammal-like reptiles&quot; (also known as pelycosaurs). These became the traditional terms for all Paleozoic (early) synapsids. More recent studies have debunked this notion as well, and reptiles are now classified within Sauropsida (sauropsids), the sister group to synapsids, thus making synapsids their own taxonomic group.

As a result, the paraphyletic terms &quot;mammal-like reptile&quot; and &quot;pelycosaur&quot; are seen as outdated and disfavored in technical literature, and the term stem mammal (or sometimes protomammal or paramammal) is used instead. Phylogenetically, it is now understood that synapsids comprise an independent branch of the tree of life. The monophyly of Synapsida is not in doubt, and the expressions such as &quot;Synapsida contains the mammals&quot; and &quot;synapsids gave rise to the mammals&quot; both express the same phylogenetic hypothesis. This terminology reflects the modern cladistic approach to animal relationships, according to which the only valid groups are those that include all of the descendants of a common ancestor: these are known as monophyletic groups, or clades.

Additionally, Reptilia (reptiles) has been revised into a monophyletic group and is considered entirely distinct from Synapsida, falling within Sauropsida, the sister group of Synapsida within Amniota.

===Primitive and advanced synapsids===
The synapsids are traditionally divided for convenience, into therapsids, an advanced group of synapsids and the branch within which mammals evolved, and stem mammals, (previously known as pelycosaurs), comprising the other six more primitive families of synapsids. Stem mammals were all rather lizard-like, with sprawling gait and possibly horny scutes, while therapsids tended to have a more erect pose and possibly hair, at least in some forms. In traditional taxonomy, the Synapsida encompasses two distinct grades: the low-slung stem mammals have given rise to the more erect therapsids, who in their turn have given rise to the mammals. In traditional vertebrate classification, the stem mammals and therapsids were both considered orders of the subclass Synapsida.

===Practical versus phylogenetic usage of &quot;synapsid&quot; and &quot;therapsid&quot;===
In phylogenetic nomenclature, the terms are used somewhat differently, as the daughter clades are included. Most papers published during the 21st century have treated &quot;Pelycosaur&quot; as an informal grouping of primitive members. Therapsida has remained in use as a clade containing both the traditional therapsid families and mammals.

Although Synapsida and Therapsida include modern mammals, in practical usage, those two terms are used almost exclusively when referring to the more basal members that lie outside of Mammaliaformes.

==Characteristics==

===Temporal openings===

Synapsids evolved a temporal fenestra behind each eye orbit on the lateral surface of the skull. It may have provided new attachment sites for jaw muscles. A similar development took place in the diapsids, which evolved two rather than one opening behind each eye. Originally, the openings in the skull left the inner cranium covered only by the jaw muscles, but in higher therapsids and mammals, the sphenoid bone has expanded to close the opening. This has left the lower margin of the opening as an arch extending from the lower edges of the braincase.

===Teeth===

Synapsids are characterized by having differentiated teeth. These include the canines, molars, and incisors. The trend towards differentiation is found in some labyrinthodonts and early anapsid reptilians in the form of enlargement of the first teeth on the maxilla, forming a sort of protocanines. This trait was subsequently lost in the diapsid line, but developed further in the synapsids. Early synapsids could have two or even three enlarged &quot;canines&quot;, but in the therapsids, the pattern had settled to one canine in each upper jaw half. The lower canines developed later.

===Jaw===
The jaw transition is a good classification tool, as most other fossilized features that make a chronological progression from a reptile-like to a mammalian condition follow the progression of the jaw transition. The mandible, or lower jaw, consists of a single, tooth-bearing bone in mammals (the dentary), whereas the lower jaw of modern and prehistoric reptiles consists of a conglomeration of smaller bones (including the dentary, articular, and others). As they evolved in synapsids, these jaw bones were reduced in size and either lost or, in the case of the articular, gradually moved into the ear, forming one of the middle ear bones: while modern mammals possess the malleus, incus and stapes, basal synapsids (like all other tetrapods) possess only a stapes. The malleus is derived from the articular (a lower jaw bone), while the incus is derived from the quadrate (a cranial bone).

Mammalian jaw structures are also set apart by the dentary-squamosal jaw joint. In this form of jaw joint, the dentary forms a connection with a depression in the squamosal known as the glenoid cavity. In contrast, all other jawed vertebrates, including reptiles and nonmammalian synapsids, possess a jaw joint in which one of the smaller bones of the lower jaw, the articular, makes a connection with a bone of the cranium called the quadrate bone to form the articular-quadrate jaw joint. In forms transitional to mammals, the jaw joint is composed of a large, lower jaw bone (similar to the dentary found in mammals) that does not connect to the squamosal, but connects to the quadrate with a receding articular bone.

===Palate===
Over time, as synapsids became more mammalian and less &#x27;reptilian&#x27;, they began to develop a secondary palate, separating the mouth and nasal cavity. In early synapsids, a secondary palate began to form on the sides of the maxilla, still leaving the mouth and nostril connected.

Eventually, the two sides of the palate began to curve together, forming a U shape instead of a C shape. The palate also began to extend back toward the throat, securing the entire mouth and creating a full palatine bone. The maxilla is also closed completely. In fossils of one of the first eutheriodonts, the beginnings of a palate are clearly visible. The later &quot;Thrinaxodon&quot; has a full and completely closed palate, forming a clear progression.

===Skin and fur===

In addition to the glandular skin covered in fur found in most modern mammals, modern and extinct synapsids possess a variety of modified skin coverings, including osteoderms (bony armor embedded in the skin), scutes (protective structures of the dermis often with a horny covering), hair or fur, and scale-like structures (often formed from modified hair, as in pangolins and some rodents). While the skin of reptiles is rather thin, that of mammals has a thick dermal layer.

The ancestral skin type of synapsids has been subject to discussion. The type specimen of the oldest known synapsid &quot;Asaphestera&quot; preserved scales. Among the early synapsids, only two species of small varanopids have been found to possess osteoderms; fossilized rows of osteoderms indicate bony armour on the neck and back. However, some recent studies have cast doubt on the placement of Varanopidae in Synapsida, while others have countered and lean towards this traditional placement. Skin impressions indicate some early synapsids basal possessed rectangular scutes on their undersides and tails. The pelycosaur scutes probably were nonoverlapping dermal structures with a horny overlay, like those found in modern crocodiles and turtles. These differed in structure from the scales of lizards and snakes, which are an epidermal feature (like mammalian hair or avian feathers). Recently, skin impressions from the genus &quot;Ascendonanus&quot; suggest that at least varanopsids developed scales similar to those of squamates.

It is currently unknown exactly when mammalian characteristics such as body hair and mammary glands first appeared, as the fossils only rarely provide direct evidence for soft tissues. An exceptionally well-preserved skull of &quot;Estemmenosuchus&quot;, a therapsid from the Upper Permian, preserves smooth skin with what appear to be glandular depressions, an animal noted as being semi-aquatic. The oldest known fossil showing unambiguous imprints of hair is the Callovian (late middle Jurassic) &quot;Castorocauda&quot; and several contemporary haramiyidans, both non-mammalian mammaliaform (see below, however). More primitive members of the Cynodontia are also hypothesized to have had fur or a fur-like covering based on their inferred warm-blooded metabolism. While more direct evidence of fur in early cynodonts has been proposed in the form of small pits on the snout possibly associated with whiskers, such pits are also found in some reptiles that lack whiskers. There is evidence that some other non-mammalian cynodonts more basal than &quot;Castorocauda&quot;, such as &quot;Morganucodon&quot;, had Harderian glands, which are associated with the grooming and maintenance of fur. The apparent absence of these glands in non-mammaliaformes may suggest that fur did not originate until that point in synapsid evolution. It is possible that fur and associated features of true warm-bloodedness did not appear until some synapsids became extremely small and nocturnal, necessitating a higher metabolism. The oldest examples of nocturnality in synapsids is believed to have been in species that lived more than 300 million years ago.

However, Late Permian coprolites from Russia and possibly South Africa showcase that at least some synapsids did already have pre-mammalian hair in this epoch. These are the oldest impressions of hair-like structures on synapsids.

==== Mammary glands ====
Early synapsids, as far back as their known evolutionary debut in the Late Carboniferous period, may have laid parchment-shelled (leathery) eggs, which lacked a calcified layer, as most modern reptiles and monotremes do. This may also explain why there is no fossil evidence for synapsid eggs to date. Because they were vulnerable to desiccation, secretions from apocrine-like glands may have helped keep the eggs moist.

According to Oftedal, early synapsids may have buried the eggs into moisture laden soil, hydrating them with contact with the moist skin, or may have carried them in a moist pouch, similar to that of monotremes (echidnas carry their eggs and offspring via a temporary pouch), though this would limit the mobility of the parent. The latter may have been the primitive form of egg care in synapsids rather than simply burying the eggs, and the constraint on the parent&#x27;s mobility would have been solved by having the eggs &quot;parked&quot; in nests during foraging or other activities and periodically be hydrated, allowing higher clutch sizes than could fit inside a pouch (or pouches) at once, and large eggs, which would be cumbersome to carry in a pouch, would be easier to care for. The basis of Oftedal&#x27;s speculation is the fact that many species of anurans can carry eggs or tadpoles attached to the skin, or embedded within cutaneous &quot;pouches&quot; and how most salamanders curl around their eggs to keep them moist, both groups also having glandular skin.

The glands involved in this mechanism would later evolve into true mammary glands with multiple modes of secretion in association with hair follicles. Comparative analyses of the evolutionary origin of milk constituents support a scenario in which the secretions from these glands evolved into a complex, nutrient-rich milk long before true mammals arose (with some of the constituents possibly predating the split between the synapsid and sauropsid lines). Cynodonts were almost certainly able to produce this, which allowed a progressive decline of yolk mass and thus egg size, resulting in increasingly altricial hatchlings as milk became the primary source of nutrition, which is all evidenced by the small body size, the presence of epipubic bones, and limited tooth replacement in advanced cynodonts, as well as in mammaliaforms.

====Patagia====
Aerial locomotion first began in non-mammalian haramiyidan cynodonts, with &quot;Arboroharamiya&quot;, &quot;Xianshou&quot;, &quot;Maiopatagium&quot; and &quot;Vilevolodon&quot; bearing exquisitely preserved, fur-covered wing membranes that stretch across the limbs and tail. Their fingers are elongated, similar to those of bats and colugos and likely sharing similar roles both as wing supports and to hang on tree branches.

Within true mammals, aerial locomotion first occurs in volaticotherian eutriconodonts. A fossil &quot;Volaticotherium&quot; has an exquisitely preserved furry patagium with delicate wrinkles and that is very extensive, &quot;sandwiching&quot; the poorly preserved hands and feet and extending to the base of the tail. &quot;Argentoconodon&quot;, a close relative, shares a similar femur adapted for flight stresses, indicating a similar lifestyle.

Therian mammals would only achieve powered flight and gliding long after these early aeronauts became extinct, with the earliest-known gliding metatherians and bats evolving in the Paleocene.

===Metabolism===
Recently, it has been found that endothermy was developed as early as &quot;Ophiacodon&quot; in the late Carboniferous. The presence of fibrolamellar, a specialised type of bone that can grow quickly while maintaining a stable structure, shows that Ophiacodon would have used its high internal body temperature to fuel a fast growth comparable to modern endotherms.

==Evolutionary history==

Over the course of synapsid evolution, progenitor taxa at the start of adaptive radiations have tended to be derived carnivores. Synapsid adaptive radiations have generally occurred after extinction events that depleted the biosphere and left vacant niches open to be filled by newly evolved taxa. In non-mammaliaform synapsids, those taxa that gave rise to rapidly diversifying lineages have been both small and large in body size, although after the Late Triassic, progenitors of new synapsid lineages have generally been small, unspecialised generalists.

The earliest known synapsid &quot;Asaphestera&quot; coexisted with the earliest known sauropsid &quot;Hylonomus&quot; which lived during the Bashkirian age of the Late Carboniferous. It was one of many types of primitive synapsids that are now informally grouped together as stem mammals or sometimes as protomammals (previously known as pelycosaurs). The early synapsids spread and diversified, becoming the largest terrestrial animals in the latest Carboniferous and Early Permian periods, ranging up to in length. They were sprawling, bulky, possibly cold-blooded, and had small brains. Some, such as &quot;Dimetrodon&quot;, had large sails that might have helped raise their body temperature. A few relict groups lasted into the later Permian but, by the middle of the Late Permian, all had either died off or evolved into their successors, the therapsids.
The therapsids, a more advanced group of synapsids, appeared during the Middle Permian and included the largest terrestrial animals in the Middle and Late Permian. They included herbivores and carnivores, ranging from small animals the size of a rat (e.g.: &quot;Robertia&quot;), to large, bulky herbivores a ton or more in weight (e.g.: &quot;Moschops&quot;). After flourishing for many millions of years, these successful animals were all but wiped out by the Permian–Triassic mass extinction about 250 mya, the largest known extinction in Earth&#x27;s history, possibly related to the Siberian Traps volcanic event.

Only a few therapsids went on to be successful in the new early Triassic landscape; they include &quot;Lystrosaurus&quot; and &quot;Cynognathus&quot;, the latter of which appeared later in the Early Triassic. However, they were accompanied by the early archosaurs (soon to give rise to the dinosaurs). Some of these archosaurs, such as &quot;Euparkeria&quot;, were small and lightly built, while others, such as &quot;Erythrosuchus&quot;, were as big as or bigger than the largest therapsids.

After the Permian extinction, the synapsids did not count more than three surviving clades. The first comprised the therocephalians, which only lasted the first 20 million years of the Triassic period. The second were specialised, beaked herbivores known as dicynodonts (such as the Kannemeyeriidae), which contained some members that reached large size (up to a tonne or more). And finally there were the increasingly mammal-like carnivorous, herbivorous, and insectivorous cynodonts, including the eucynodonts from the Olenekian age, an early representative of which was &quot;Cynognathus&quot;.
Unlike the dicynodonts, which were large, the cynodonts became progressively smaller and more mammal-like as the Triassic progressed, though some forms like &quot;Trucidocynodon&quot; remained large. The first mammaliaforms evolved from the cynodonts during the early Norian age of the Late Triassic, about 225 mya.

During the evolutionary succession from early therapsid to cynodont to eucynodont to mammal, the main lower jaw bone, the dentary, replaced the adjacent bones. Thus, the lower jaw gradually became just one large bone, with several of the smaller jaw bones migrating into the inner ear and allowing sophisticated hearing.
Whether through climate change, vegetation change, ecological competition, or a combination of factors, most of the remaining large cynodonts (belonging to the Traversodontidae) and dicynodonts (of the family Kannemeyeriidae) had disappeared by the Rhaetian age, even before the Triassic–Jurassic extinction event that killed off most of the large non-dinosaurian archosaurs. The remaining Mesozoic synapsids were small, ranging from the size of a shrew to the badger-like mammal &quot;Repenomamus&quot;.
During the Jurassic and Cretaceous, the remaining non-mammalian cynodonts were small, such as &quot;Tritylodon&quot;. No cynodont grew larger than a cat. Most Jurassic and Cretaceous cynodonts were herbivorous, though some were carnivorous. The family Tritheledontidae, which first appeared near the end of the Triassic, was carnivorous and persisted well into the Middle Jurassic. The other, Tritylodontidae, first appeared at the same time as the tritheledonts, but was herbivorous. This group became extinct at the end of the Early Cretaceous epoch. Dicynodonts are generally thought to have become extinct near the end of the Triassic period, but there was evidence this group survived, in the form of six fragments of fossil bone that were found in Cretaceous rocks of Queensland, Australia. If true, it would mean there is a significant ghost lineage of Dicynodonts in Gondwana. However, these fossils were re-described in 2019 as being Pleistocene in age, and possibly belonging to a diprotodontid marsupial.

Today, the 5,500 species of living synapsids, known as the mammals, include both aquatic (cetaceans) and flying (bats) species, and the largest animal ever known to have existed (the blue whale). Humans are synapsids, as well. Most mammals are viviparous and give birth to live young rather than laying eggs with the exception being the monotremes.

Triassic and Jurassic ancestors of living mammals, along with their close relatives, had high metabolic rates. This meant consuming food (generally thought to be insects) in much greater quantity. To facilitate rapid digestion, these synapsids evolved mastication (chewing) and specialized teeth that aided chewing. Limbs also evolved to move under the body instead of to the side, allowing them to breathe more efficiently during locomotion. This helped make it possible to support their higher metabolic demands.

==Relationships==
Below is a cladogram of the most commonly accepted phylogeny of synapsids, showing a long stem lineage including Mammalia and successively more basal clades such as Theriodontia, Therapsida and Sphenacodontia:
Most uncertainty in the phylogeny of synapsids lies among the earliest members of the group, including forms traditionally placed within Pelycosauria. As one of the earliest phylogenetic analyses, Brinkman &amp; Eberth (1983) placed the family Varanopidae with Caseasauria as the most basal offshoot of the synapsid lineage. Reisz (1986) removed Varanopidae from Caseasauria, placing it in a more derived position on the stem. While most analyses find Caseasauria to be the most basal synapsid clade, Benson&#x27;s analysis (2012) placed a clade containing Ophiacodontidae and Varanopidae as the most basal synapsids, with Caseasauria occupying a more derived position. Benson attributed this revised phylogeny to the inclusion of postcranial characteristics, or features of the skeleton other than the skull, in his analysis. When only cranial or skull features were included, Caseasauria remained the most basal synapsid clade. Below is a cladogram modified from Benson&#x27;s analysis (2012):

However, more recent examination of the phylogeny of basal synapsids, incorporating newly described basal caseids and eothyridids, returned Caseasauria to its position as the sister to all other synapsids. Brocklehurst et al. (2016) demonstrated that many of the postcranial characters used by Benson (2012) to unite Caseasauria with Sphenacodontidae and Edaphosauridae were absent in the newly discovered postcranial material of eothyridids, and were therefore acquired convergently.

<doc id="201969" wikidata="Q182640" url="?curid=201969" title="Taif">
<text>Taif (, ) is a city and governorate in the Province of Makkah in Saudi Arabia. Located at an elevation of in the slopes of the Hijaz Mountains, which themselves are part of the Sarat Mountains, the city has a population of 563,282 people in 2022, making it one of the most populous cities in the kingdom.

There is a belief that Taif is indirectly referred to in Quran 43:31. The city was visited by the Islamic prophet Muhammad, sometime in the early 7th century, and was inhabited by the tribe of Banu Thaqif. It is still inhabited to this day by their descendants. As a part of the Hejaz, the city has seen many transfers-of-power throughout its history, with the last being during the Saudi conquest of Hejaz in 1925.

The city has been called the unofficial summer capital of Saudi Arabia and has also been called the best summer destination in Saudi Arabia as it enjoys a moderate weather during summer, unlike most of the Arabian Peninsula. The city owes its popularity among tourists to its many mountain resorts and moderate climate, even during the harsh summers of Arabia. The city is connected to the nearby resort town of Al-Hada via the iconic Highway 15 (Taif – Al-Hada Road). It stands out from the rest of the Hijazi region as it is a city that plays an active role in the agricultural output of Saudi Arabia and is the center of an agricultural area known for its cultivation of grapes, pomegranate, figs, roses and honey. Taif is also very active in the manufacturing of traditional attar, and is known locally as &quot;City of the Roses&quot; (). Taif also hosts the historic Souq &#x27;Okaz.

The Taif governorate is divided into 15 smaller municipalities, with Ta&#x27;if as the capital. The administration of the city itself is carried out by five municipalities, named North Taif, West Taif, East Taif, South Taif and New Taif. Taif is served by the Taif International Airport, with a larger international airport planned to open by 2030.

== Name ==
Much like many of the cities in the Hejazi region, the city of Ta&#x27;if had an older name: &quot;Wajj&quot; (). This was also the name of the Valley of Wajj, a significant valley within Arabian and Islamic history.

The etymology of the city&#x27;s current name, Taʾif (), comes from the Arabic root , which could translate to &quot;wanderer&quot;, &quot;roamer&quot;, or &quot;circulator&quot;; the latter of which is the basis of the word &quot;Ṭawāf&quot; (), which literally translates to &quot;circulation&quot; or &quot;circumambulation&quot;, and is used in the context of the circumambulation of the Kaaba.

Taʾif was given this name due to the wall that was built by the tribe of Banu Thaqif that circulated the city. In short, the city of Taʾif literally means the circulated or encircled city.

== History ==
In the 6th century A.D., the city of Ta&#x27;if was dominated by the Thaqif tribe, which still lives in and around the city of Ta&#x27;if today. It has been suggested that Jewish tribes who were displaced in the wars of the Himyarite Kingdom by Ethiopian Christians settled near Ta&#x27;if. The walled city was a religious centre as it housed the idol of the goddess &quot;Lāt&quot;, who was then known as &quot;the lady of Ta&#x27;if.&quot; Its climate marked the city out from its dry and barren neighbours closer to the Red Sea. Wheat, vines and fruit orchards were grown around Ta&#x27;if, and this is how the city earned its title &quot;the Garden of the Hejaz.&quot; Both Ta&#x27;if and Mecca were resorts of pilgrimage. Ta&#x27;if was more pleasantly situated than Mecca itself, and their people of Ta&#x27;if had close trading relations. The people of Ta&#x27;if carried on agriculture and fruit‑growing in addition to their trade activities.

In the early 7th century C.E., Muhammad, who was born in Makkah, preached Islam to the inhabitants of Mecca and the Hijaz, and encountered resistance from many of the people there. In 630, a battle took place at Hunayn, close to the city. Shortly after that, the unsuccessful siege of Ta&#x27;if took place. The city was assaulted by catapults from Banu Daus, but it repelled the attacks. The Battle of Tabuk in 631 left Tā&#x27;if completely isolated, so members of Thaqīf arrived in Makkah to negotiate the conversion of the city to Islam. The idol of &quot;Lāt&quot; was destroyed along with all other signs of the city&#x27;s pagan past.

The city then went through many exchanges-of-power, but most of the action within these conflicts took place between Makkah and Medina, and Ta&#x27;if dwindled in importance in contrast to the two holy cities.

=== Under Ottoman rule ===
On 17 July 1517, the Sharif of Mecca capitulated to the Ottoman Sultan Selim I. As a sign of this, he surrendered to him the keys of the Islamic cities of Mecca and Medina. As part of the Hijaz, Ta&#x27;if was also given over to Ottoman control and the city remained Ottoman for a further three centuries, until in 1802, when it was retaken by rebels allied with the House of Saud. These forces then proceeded to take Mecca and Medina. The loss was keenly felt by the Ottoman Empire, which viewed itself as the protector of the holy cities. The Ottoman sultan, Mahmud II, called upon the &quot;Wali&quot; of Egypt, Muhammad Ali, who launched an attack on the Hejaz and reconquered Ta&#x27;if in 1813.

In 1813, the Swiss traveler and orientalist Johann Ludwig Burckhardt visited Ta&#x27;if and left an eyewitness account of the city just after its recapture by the Muhammad Ali, with whom he obtained several interviews while he was there. Burckhardt reported that the wall and ditch around the city had been built by Othman el-Medhayfe. There were three gates and several towers on the city walls, which, however, were weak, being in some places only thick. Burckhardt stated that the castle had been built by Sharif Ghalib ibn Musa&#x27;id. He noted the destruction of the city caused by the conquest of 1802. Most of the buildings were still in ruin while he was there, and the tomb of &#x27;Abdullah ibn &#x27;Abbas – cousin of Muhammad and ancestor of the Abbasids – had been severely damaged. He also recorded that the population of the city was still mostly Thaqīfi. In terms of trade, the city was an entrepôt for coffee.

The castle and military barracks in Ta&#x27;if were repaired by the Ottomans in 1843, a &quot;&quot; – mansion for government business – was built in 1869, and a post office was established sometime later.

=== Arab Revolt ===
Prior to the Arab Revolt, Ahmed Bey had been made the commander of Ottoman forces in Tā&#x27;if. He had under him a force of 3,000 soldiers and 10 pieces of mountain artillery. Ghalib Pasha, the governor of the Hejaz was also present in the city. In 1916, the Hashemites launched their revolt against the Ottoman Empire in Mecca in June. That city had fallen and then in July, Abdullah, the eldest son of the Hashemite leader and Sharif of Mecca, Husayn ibn Ali, came with seventy men to Tā&#x27;if. Whilst his activities in the area aroused the suspicion of Ahmed Bey, Ghalib Pasha was unconcerned by so small a force. Abdullah secretly built up his army to 5,000 men. He then cut the telegraph wires to the city and took the offensive. All Hashemite assaults on the city were repelled by the mountain guns, and both sides settled down to an uneasy siege. However, Hashemite guns were slowly brought up to Tā&#x27;if, and then the city held out a little longer; before finally surrendering on 22 September. The city thus later became a part of the self-proclaimed Hashemite Kingdom of Hejaz.

=== Saudi conquest and modern history ===
Ta&#x27;if did not remain in Hashemite hands for very long. Tensions between the King of the Hejaz, Husayn ibn Ali, and Abdulaziz al-Saud, the Emir of Nejd and Hasa, soon broke out into violence. Although hostilities subsided in 1919, by September 1924, the then Saudi-sponsored Ikhwan militia, under the leadership of Sultan bin Bajad and Khaled bin Luwai&#x27;, was ready to attack Ta&#x27;if. The city was supposed to have been defended by the king&#x27;s son, &#x27;Ali, but he fled in panic with his troops. Three hundred of &#x27;Ali&#x27;s men were slain by the Ikhwan in what became known as the Ta&#x27;if massacre. In 1926, Abdulaziz al-Saud was officially recognized as the new King of Hejaz. Ta&#x27;if remained a part of the Kingdom of Hejaz until Abdulaziz al-Saud unified his two kingdoms and consolidated them into the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 1932. In 1934 the treaty was signed here that established the boundary lines between Yemen and the kingdom. The king himself was later to die in the city on 9 November 1953, as did King Khalid on 13 June 1982.

Ta&#x27;if was still little more than a medieval city when the Saudis took control of it. However, they later embarked on a project of modernizing the city. Saudi Arabia&#x27;s first public power generator was set up in Ta&#x27;if in the late 1940s. In terms of building roads to the isolated city, in 1965 the then King Faisal inaugurated the mountain highway between Mecca and Ta&#x27;if, now part of Highway 15 and known as the Taif – Al-Hada Road. In 1974, the approximately-650-kilometer Ta&#x27;if-Abha–Jizan highway was commissioned part of the Highway 15. By the 1991 Gulf War, Ta&#x27;if was such a modern city in terms of communications that it was chosen as the site of the Rendon Group&#x27;s television and radio network, which was used for communication with Kuwait during the Iraqi occupation.

== Geography ==
The entirety of the Ta&#x27;if governorate is situated on a raised valley surrounded by the Hejaz Mountains (part of the Sarat mountains) to the west and south. The city is situated at an elevation of above mean sea level. For comparison, the surrounding mountains which separate Ta&#x27;if from nearby villages such as Al-Hada and Ash-Shafa, range in height anywhere from . Ta&#x27;if is known to have had many &quot;wadis&quot; with running water before, suggested by the presence of dams along many of these. Taif&#x27;s highest point, the Jebel Daka is even the fifth highest peak of Saudi Arabia.

=== Climate ===
Ta&#x27;if has a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;BWh&quot;), with hot summers and mild winters. It is much cooler in Ta&#x27;if during the summertime than it is other parts of Saudi Arabia, particularly Riyadh. Precipitation is low, but all months see some rain, with more rain in spring and late autumn than in other months.

=== Natural landmarks ===
Al-Rudaf Park is a large natural park in South Ta&#x27;if, where trees stand amidst weathered granite rocks. The site also has a small zoo. Additionally, the park has a large lake with fountains and cannons. The Ta&#x27;if rose plantation is a complex of rose fields filled with small fragrant pink roses that are distilled into expensive Ta&#x27;if rose oil. The famous grown here is the 30-petal Damask rose (&quot;Rosa damascena trigintipetala&quot;), whose scent has been described as a robust, spicy, and dizzyingly complex scent which has been used by several luxury perfume brands, including Ormonde Jayne, Chanel, Guerlain and Hermès. The &quot;Nuqbat al-Hamra&quot;&#x27; park near Al-Hada is a large nature preserve at an elevation of above sea level. Ash-Shafā is a small village situated high up in the mountains at an elevation of above sea level, rich in agricultural products. The fruit gardens of Ta&#x27;if are located here. A camel ride is available, and Jabal Dakka is within view of the village. The Saiysad National Park is located in New Ta&#x27;if.

== Economy and development ==

Historically, Ta&#x27;if&#x27;s economy depended on agriculture and the cultivation of roses, which were traded throughout Central Asia and Transoxiana. Ta&#x27;if&#x27;s modern economy is still mostly dependent on agriculture and perfumes, but an increasing diversification project has been taking place in order to combat the city&#x27;s heavy dependence on these two industries. The distilled rose oil from the &quot;Rosa × damascena&quot; plant has been traditionally used as an attar in the Middle East, usually as a masculine fragrance, and due to its cultivation in Ta&#x27;if, it has gained the name &quot;Ta&#x27;if rose&quot;, which in 2024 was included in the UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.

On October 1, 2017, King Salman of Saudi Arabia inaugurated the &quot;New Ta&#x27;if&quot; project, a $3.9 billion project aiming at establishing a new, international airport in the city, dubbed the Ta&#x27;if International Airport, renovation and modernization of the historic Souk &#x27;Okaz, establishment of the Oasis of Technology, which is expected to include an Antonov aircraft manufacturing and assembly plant, an industrial airport with a 3.5-km runway, a solar farm covering expected to produce 30 MW of electricity, the Residential Suburb, which is expected to include 10,000 residential units, the Industrial City, an industrial city with a complex for heavy, medium and light industries along with a vocational training center, and the University City, a university projected to be built in the Saiysad National Park.

== Culture ==

=== Arts ===
The Souk &#x27;Okaz, one of the best known pre-Islamic &quot;souks&quot;, was not only a market, but in many ways, a historic theater, where sociopolitical and commercial exchanges took place between the tribes of pre-Islamic Arabia. People from around the peninsula would come to visit the idol of the goddess &quot;Lat&quot;. This is proof that Ta&#x27;if has long been a historic center for trade and the arts in the Arabian Peninsula; contemporary theaters in the area include the &#x27;Okaz Market Theater and the recently opened King &#x27;Abdullah Park Theater. A performing arts theater is also located in the nearby town of Qia and is known as the Folk Theater of Qia.

In the framework of Saudi Seasons initiative, the first Ta&#x27;if Season took place on August 1, 2019. Artists from seven countries participated in the event and a wide range of activities were overseen. Three main events have taken place during the season including the Souk &#x27;Okaz festival and a camel race. As a sideline to the event, a rose festival in the city as well as a number of concerts and plays were held.

=== Sports ===
Like most of Saudi Arabia, the most popular sport among Saudis in Ta&#x27;if is football. Wej SC (Saudi Arabian Football Federation) plays at King Fahd Sports City in North Ta&#x27;if near as-Sayl as-Saghir and is the football team representing the city. The expatriate minority in the city has brought several other games with them to Ta&#x27;if, including cricket, badminton and volleyball. Al Hawiyah Stadium is the local football pitch.

== Infrastructure ==

=== Education ===
In 2004 Taif University was established which offers both undergraduate and graduate programs across four colleges and 16 faculties. It has four campuses located in the Taif Governorate, with the main campus in Al-Hawiyya.

In 2014 the Canadian Niagara College opened a campus in Taif with programs in tourism, hospitality, and business. This effort is part of the Colleges of Excellence program. The college faced criticism for being open to men only, including from the Canadian Association of University Teachers. As of 2023 it is unclear whether the campus in Taif is still active, with even the main website of Niagara College KSA having mixed information.

=== Mosques ===
There are a number of historical mosques in the city. The Abdullah ibn &#x27;Abbas Mosque houses the remains of Abdullah ibn Abbas, a cousin and companion of Muhammad. The Mosque of Addas is named after Addas, an Iraqi Christian who embraced Islam after meeting Muhammad.

=== Museums and historic landmarks ===
Located north of Ta&#x27;if is the site of the Souk &#x27;Okaz, the largest and best known of the pre-Islamic &quot;souks&quot;. The &quot;souq&quot; was a scene of annual social, political and commercial gatherings. It was also the location of competitive recitation of poetry and prose. The buildings remain, including prominent outlines of walls of basaltic stone. Wadi Mitna is a &quot;wadi&quot; believed to be the location where Muhammad sought refuge from the tribes of Hawazin and Thaqif in 619 AD, after he was stoned by the tribes. He was later given sanctuary by his fellows in a small house, which has now been converted into a mosque. Shubra Palace is the regional museum of Ta&#x27;if, housed in a building built around 1900, which served as Ibn Saud&#x27;s lodging in the 1930s, and was also used as the Presidency of the Council of Ministers of Saudi Arabia during King Faisal&#x27;s reign. The Turkish Fort was a fort located near the Souk &#x27;Okaz, many battles have been fought here and many prominent graves can be found, though only a small part of the original fort remains. Legend has it that Lawrence of Arabia also fought here. The Badawi Fortress is located in the southern reaches of East Ta&#x27;if.

=== Transportation ===
Due to Ta&#x27;if&#x27;s location in the mountains, most major highways either bend around the city or avoid the region completely. The only major highway in the Saudi Arabian network to pass through Ta&#x27;if is Highway 15 (known to locals as the Taif – Al-Hada Road) which arrives from Mecca in the west, bends around the mountains through Al-Hada, passes through the center of Ta&#x27;if, and travels to Abha and Khamis Mushait via Baha and Baljurashi. Ta&#x27;if is connected to Highway 40 via Highway 267 and Highway 287. Highway 267 forms the western part of the Ta&#x27;if beltway, but then continues southward toward Ash-Shafa, bypassing Mecca by using a longer route and gives access to Highway 304, Highway 301, Highway 40 and Highway 290 via Highway 298.

Ta&#x27;if is served by the Taif International Airport. It was scheduled to open in 2020, but this had been delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The new airport is mainly designed to cater to pilgrims of Hajj and &#x27;Umrah, and to relieve pressure off the King Abdulaziz International Airport in Jeddah.

== Notable people ==
=== Tribes ===
The historically well-known tribe of Thaqif still lives in and around the city of Ta&#x27;if. &#x27;Utaibah is another Adnani tribe which still lives in Ta&#x27;if. Banu Harith is one of the Qahtani Arabs tribes living around Ta&#x27;if in Saudi Arabia. The tribe claims a very large area around the city in the area between Ta&#x27;if and Qunfudhah in Saudi Arabia. Thu al-Isba&#x27; al-&#x27;Adwani was an Arabic poet and a man of wisdom from the Banu &#x27;Adwan tribe that historically lived in the northern parts of Ta&#x27;if. Furthermore, Banu Thabit are people descended from Thabit and the tribe is originally part of Hawazin clan.

<text>Sterling Airlines A/S was a low-cost airline with its head office at Copenhagen Airport South in Dragør, Dragør Municipality, Denmark. It was created in September 2005 through the merger of two Danish airlines — Sterling European Airlines and Maersk Air — which had been acquired by the Icelandic investment group Fons Eignarhaldsfélag a few months before for MDKK 500. Fons was owned by Icelandic business tycoon Palmi Haraldsson. One month after the merger, Sterling Airlines was sold to the FL Group for an amount of MDKK 1500. In December 2006, Sterling was sold again, this time to Nordic Travel Holding. On 6 January 2006, Hannes Þór Smárason, CEO of the FL Group, stated that a merger of EasyJet and Sterling was a possibility.

At the end of 2005, Sterling Airlines had 1,600 staff and 29 aircraft, making it almost twice as large as Icelandair. The company flew to some 40 European destinations, with Copenhagen Airport, Oslo Airport, Gardermoen and Stockholm-Arlanda Airport as primary hubs.

On 29 October 2008, Sterling filed for bankruptcy and ceased operations. On 4 December 2008, Cimber Air announced that it had purchased Sterling and intended to restore the airline as a separate company, with a gradual expansion throughout Europe. The purchase included Sterling&#x27;s name, website and landing slots, but not aircraft. Former Sterling employees were not guaranteed jobs in the resurrected company, although Cimber believed many of them would be offered jobs.

==History==

* 1962: Eilif Krogager, founder of Danish travel agency Tjæreborg (based at Tjæreborg village near Esbjerg in Denmark), today part of MyTravel Group), started the charter airline Sterling Airways with two Douglas DC-6B bought from Swissair, to better service his own package tours from Scandinavia to the Mediterranean.
* 1963: Further DC-6Bs were acquired.
* 1965: Sterling received its first Caravelle.
* 1968: The company was bought out of the Tjæreborg Group and started servicing other travel agents as well.
* 14 March 1972: Sterling Airways Flight 296 crashed near the Dubai airport, killing all 112 persons on board. The 106 passengers were returning to Denmark following a holiday in Sri Lanka.
* 1977: Acquired the airline Copenhagen Air Services.
* 1987: The company celebrated its 25th anniversary with 19 aircraft and almost 1,300 staff.
* 1993: Sterling Airways went bankrupt.
* 1994: The estate after Sterling Airways re-created the company as Sterling European Airlines, with three aircraft and 182 staff.
* 1996: Sterling was bought by the Norwegian shipping company Fred. Olsen.
* 2000: Sterling started with regular air services to Málaga and Alicante, to compensate for the diminishing charter travel business.
* 2001: More routes were added; it was also decided that Sterling should leave the charter industry and become a fully fledged low-fare airline.
* 2002: Sterling opened 21 new routes, primarily between Scandinavia and Southern Europe, but also routes from Copenhagen to Oslo and Stockholm.
* 2003: Sterling expanded its fleet from six to eight aircraft and opened 11 more routes between Scandinavia and Southern Europe. Passenger numbers reached a record high of 1.3 million, a 40% increase on 2002.
* 2004: The fleet grew to 12 aircraft.
* March 2005: Fred. Olsen sold Sterling to the Icelandic investment company Fons Eignarhaldsfélag, owners of the small Iceland Express airline, and the managing director of Iceland Express, Almar Örn Hilmarsson, was promoted to new managing director for Sterling.
* June 2005: The Fons Eignarhaldsfélag bought Maersk Air from the A.P. Moller-Maersk Group and announced that they wanted to merge the two airlines under Sterling Airlines A/S.
* September 2005: The merger was approved by the authorities and Sterling Airlines A/S was the only operational company - the fourth largest low-cost carrier in Europe—and only a month later Fons Eignarhaldsfélag sold the company to the FL Group.
* August 2006: Sterling adopted a buy-on-board program that allows pre-ordering and onboard purchases of duty-free merchandise and meals.
* December 2006: FL Group sold Sterling to Northern Travel Holding, a holding company owned by the three Icelandic private equity companies FL Group, Fons Eignarhaldsfélag and Sons.
* April 2007: Essential Aircraft Maintenance Services (EAMS) has been established by LD Equity 2 based on the acquisition of Sterling&#x27;s aircraft maintenance department. LD Equity 2 has, together with a new management team, acquired Sterling&#x27;s aircraft maintenance activities and has established Essential Aircraft Maintenance Services A/S.
* 29 October 2008: Sterling ceased shortly after declared bankruptcy due to the rising fuel prices in the first half of 2008 and the Icelandic financial crisis in October that hit its major investor. The entire fleet was grounded with immediate effect.

==Fleet==

Historically &quot;Sterling Airways&quot; operated several Sud Aviation Caravelle IIIs and seven Super-Caravelles. During the time between late 1970s and the 1993 bankruptcy, Sterling also operated three Boeing 727s, two Douglas DC-8-63s (stretched &quot;Super DC 8&quot;) and one Super DC-8-62CF as well as an Aerospatiale Corvette.

As of 29 October 2008 the fleet has been grounded, due to &quot;Sterling Airlines&quot; declaring bankruptcy. Several Boeing jetliners are stored at Belgrade Nikola Tesla Airport (five 737-700 and two 737-800) and also at the nearby Batajnica Airport (four 737-700) in Belgrade, Serbia. One Boeing 757-200 was later acquired by Donald Trump and used as Trump Force One.

The Sterling Airlines fleet included the following aircraft (as of October 2008):

==Incidents and accidents ==
* On March 14, 1972, Sterling Airways Flight 296, a Sud Aviation Caravelle, crashed into a mountain ridge on approach to Dubai near Kalba, United Arab Emirates. All 112 passengers and crew on board died in the crash, making it the deadliest air disaster in the history of the United Arab Emirates.
* 15 March 1974, Sterling Airways Flight 901, another Sud Aviation Caravelle, suffered a landing gear failure at Mehrabad International Airport, Tehran, Iran. As the aircraft was taxiing, the right main landing gear failed, causing the right wing to hit the ground and catch fire. 15 passengers died in the incident.
* 3 September 1979, Sterling Airways Flight 4133 an Aérospatiale Corvette (Registration: OY-SBS) crashed into the sea south of Nice Côte d&#x27;Azur Airport, France. The aircraft took off from Coventry Airport for Nice. All 10 passengers and crew died in the crash.

<doc id="201971" wikidata="Q1969133" url="?curid=201971" title="Richard Pearse">
<text>Richard William Pearse (3 December 1877 – 29 July 1953) was a New Zealand farmer and inventor who performed pioneering aviation experiments. Witnesses interviewed many years afterwards describe observing Pearse flying and landing a powered heavier-than-air machine on 31 March 1903, nine months before the Wright brothers flew. Ambiguous statements made by Pearse himself make it difficult to date the aviation experiments with certainty. In a newspaper interview in 1909, with respect to inventing a flying machine, he said &quot;I did not attempt anything practical with the idea until 1904&quot;.

Biographer Gordon Ogilvie credits Pearse with &quot;several far-sighted concepts: a monoplane configuration, wing flaps and rear elevator, tricycle undercarriage with steerable nosewheel, and a propeller with variable-pitch blades.&quot;

Pearse largely ended his early flying experiments about 1911 but pioneered novel aircraft and aero-engine invention from 1933 with the development of his &quot;private plane for the million&quot;, a foldable single-engined tiltrotor convertiplane.

==Early life==
Richard William Pearse, born at Waitohi Flat, South Canterbury, New Zealand, on 3 December 1877, was the fourth of nine children of Digory Sargent Pearse (1844–1932) of South Petherwin, Cornwall, England, and Sarah Anne Brown (c.1850–1937) of County Londonderry, Ireland. Digory had migrated to New Zealand via South Australia in 1864–1865 and had taken up farming at Upper Waitohi, near Temuka. There he met and married Sarah, who&#x27;d come to New Zealand to be with her sister at Temuka in about 1867.

Digory and Sarah taught each of their children to play a musical instrument and formed a family orchestra. Richard played the cello, which he always kept close to hand. The family were also good tennis players; his brother Warne competing in New Zealand championships for some 25 years.

Richard Pearse attended the Waitohi Flat School from 1883 and Upper Waitohi School from 1891 to 1893, where, deep in thought at times and as a keen reader, he pursued an interest in technology. Peter Friel, a classmate at Upper Waitohi School, told researchers that Pearse came to school one morning with a device he&#x27;d made from a herring in tomato sauce tin cut to form a multi-blade rotor, mounted to a cotton reel base—a string-pull helicopter. Seated on its launcher&#x27;s peg and placed on a bench, he wound string around the reel and pulled away, whereupon the reel-rotor flew off and out of sight. Friel continued, &quot;That’s how he got the start of that flying business!&quot; Pearse revealed to the &quot;Timaru Post&quot; in 1909 that: &quot;From the time I was quite a little chap, I had a great fancy for engineering, and when I was still quite a young man, I conceived the idea of inventing a flying machine.&quot;

His father&#x27;s investment in eldest son Thomas&#x27;s medical degree at Edinburgh put aside any thought of support for Richard&#x27;s aspiration to study engineering at Canterbury College in Christchurch. Instead, at age 21 in 1898, his father set him up with the use of 100 acres (40.5 ha) of Waitohi farmland, upon which, over the next 13 years, he established a workshop, realised his ideas for bicycles, aero engines, flying machines and other contraptions, and kept some 76–286 sheep.

==Career==
===Early engineering work===
A hint of Pearse&#x27;s earliest flying machine work at Waitohi, South Canterbury, came from Jean Currie, in her 20s at the time. When interviewed by researchers Tom Bradley and Geoff Rodliffe she recalled that quite some time before her family moved from Waitohi Flat to Morven in 1899, her father, Thomas Currie, farmer, and uncle, Alexander McClintock, blacksmith, had walked up to Pearse&#x27;s workshop one Sunday only to return soon after, saying: &quot;If he gets that contraption in the air he will fall out and kill himself.&quot; Though others spoke of Pearse working on his plane at the turn of the century or during the Boer War, Currie&#x27;s account is dateable by Thomas Currie&#x27;s acquisition of land in the Waikakahi Estate ballot of March 1899 and the family&#x27;s departure from Waitohi.

As no light suitably powered engines could be purchased at that time, many pioneering inventors made their own. In 1951, Pearse, then 73 years old, told Dr. J R Gilmour during an examination for aged care, that he had made an engine away back &quot;during the Boer War&quot;. This could be anytime between 1899 and 1902. In that period, the only person available to Pearse, with knowledge of building hydrocarbon engines, was Cecil Wood of Timaru, who, from the mid-1890s, had pioneered New Zealand built internal combustion engines, motorcars and motorcycles. In later years, Wood told George Bolt and Harold Cederman that Pearse had visited him &quot;in 1901 and 1902, and was shown how to make spark plugs with the central electrode insulated by mica. Wood also helped him with the design of surface carburettors.&quot;

The earliest technical description of his two-cylinder horizontally-opposed double-acting four-stroke &quot;oil engine&quot;, was published in the 19 July 1906 provisional specification of Pearse&#x27;s patent application, &quot;An Improved Aerial or Flying Machine&quot; (New Zealand Patent no. 21476), and indicated in Figure 1 of the 1907 complete specification; its existence confirmed by the recovery of two 4 inch bore x 12 inch cast iron cylinder relics in 1971. The two pistons were connected by a single piston rod, with the crank-arm and crank mechanism, turning the propeller shaft, mounted about the centre. Calculations indicate the engine could have produced as much as ; &quot;quite enough power to get a plane off the ground. The Wright brothers, after all, managed their 1903 flights on 12 hp.&quot;

Crudely built, this engine appears to be Pearse&#x27;s earliest, preceding his light four-cylinder horizontally-opposed single-acting four-stroke engine which features in a 1909 &quot;Temuka Leader&quot; article. Pearse informed the Minister of Defence in May 1945, he&#x27;d started to work on this engine from about February 1904, a few months after Samuel Langley&#x27;s aeroplane failed to fly. He referred to the 25 hp engine as an &quot;aeroplane motor&quot;, his &quot;first motor&quot; and the &quot;first single-acting 4 cylinder motor&quot;.

At some point Pearse mounted the earlier two-cylinder engine within the flying machine—a tricycle undercarriage surmounted by a fabric-covered bamboo wing structure. In general layout the machine resembled modern aircraft design: monoplane rather than biplane; tractor rather than pusher propeller. Witnesses tended to agree that the flying machine had no tail section.

Pearse&#x27;s interest in engineering was not confined to aviation. In 1902, at Waitohi, Pearse invented a novel bell-crank pedal lever type bicycle with self-inflating tyres. Messrs. Martin and Co. of Christchurch built the bicycle, and Pearse made key components himself. Traveling up to Christchurch, he filed a patent application for the invention, via his newly appointed patent agent Henry Hughes, with the Christchurch Patent Office on 8 February 1902 (New Zealand Patent no. 14507)—his first patent. Coincidentally, on the day the Patent Office issued Letters Patent, Pearse&#x27;s bicycle drew public attention when he rode it in to Temuka on Sale Day, Tuesday, 19 May 1903, and Timaru on Wednesday, 20 May 1903.

===Flights===
Researchers into Pearse&#x27;s aeronautical work had located some 55 surviving witnesses by the 1980s. They assigning a principal category to each witness at that time: 20 had seen a flight or more, 9 had seen a plane on a hedge or in the workshop awaiting repairs, 2 had heard the plane in flight but did not see it, 7 had a second hand account of seeing flight, 10 knew of flights and 7 had seen or knew of the flying machine under construction.

Some witness accounts suggest Pearse flew in 1902; others indicate a series of flights in 1903, ending in winter that year. Some dateable events recalled as occurring about the time of the flights were: immediately after excessive flooding of the Ōpihi River on 23–24 March 1902; on 31 March, preceding April Fools&#x27; Day; within a year of the end of the Second Boer War and following the disbanding of the 9th Contingent, New Zealand Mounted Rifles, South Island Regiment, in New Zealand on 21 August 1902; about the time of Eugen Sandow&#x27;s visit to Timaru, 26–29 December 1902; during Honora Crowley&#x27;s last teaching year at Upper Waitohi School to September 1903; and before the Big Snow snowstorm from 11 July 1903. Following decades of research to establish dates, 31 March 1903 is noted by historians as the day when Pearse may have achieved some sort of witnessed flight.

====1903 March 31: Upper Waitohi School take off, Main Waitohi Road====
With the help of Pearse&#x27;s brother Warne, the aeroplane was pushed 800 metres up the gravel road to the Upper Waitohi School crossroads, where two dozen spectators gathered to watch the fun.  During several attempts to get the machine to work, the crowd dwindled to a handful of people. On the final effort Richard signalled to Warne to pull the propeller to start the engine, while boulders placed in front of the wheels, and volunteers, restrained the plane.  After a short time the engine picked up speed.  The boulders were then released, and the aircraft was given a push by volunteers. 

The Plane taxied for a considerable distance, keeping to the centre of the road. Pearse then accelerated, and the machine rose sluggishly into the air, sounding ’rather like a chaffcutter’.  It was travelling at an estimated 30kph, with a peak altitude exceeding 3 metres. Decades later witnesses provided affidavits describing the plane pitching and wobbling in the air, followed by a final leftward swerve onto the top of a four metre high gorse fence which fronted Pearse&#x27;s property. Estimates for the distance covered by witnesses vary from 45 metres to 400 metres, with an average of 135 metres. Richard hurt his shoulder during the crash. He was taken to hospital to see if he had broken his collar bone, but it was not, and he returned home the next day. The hospital later burnt down along with the records. 

The following day, witnesses describe telling other people of the ‘flight’ and being accused of making an April fool&#x27;s joke, thus, the date of the event was the 31st of March. One group of witnesses were school students, who had this discussion while riding their ponies to school.  Three of these students stopped attending School in the months leading up to April 1903.  Another group who watched the event from high ground were William Charles Bedford, his wife Mary, and her sister-in-law Mrs. Louise Johnson. William Bedford sold his farm in Waitohi in December 1903, and went to live in Apsley, Darfield, where he resided for the rest of his life. Mrs. Louise Johnson was one of the most alert witnesses with respect to how the plane behaved in the air. She recollected to interviewer George Bolt that the take off occurred long before she moved away from Waitohi in May 1904. With this and other evidence, Pearse historians generally agree that this take off likely occurred on 31 March 1903, with a less likely year of 1902, and could not have occurred in 1904.  This is the only flight experiment witnessed by multiple people. 

Preceding the Wright brothers powered flights, this was one of two aircraft which achieved a successful flight attempt, from level ground without the use of ramps, slopes, guiderails, or catapults.  The other was Clément Ader of France, who in 1890 is given credit by aviation historians for achieving a flight distance of approximately 50 metres at an altitude of 20 centimetres.

====1903: Multi-lap Paddock Flight, Richard Pearse&#x27;s Farm, Waitohi====
John William Casey, born 1896, seven years old in 1903, recalled that soon after Pearse&#x27;s first takeoff the news spread &quot;that there was to be another free show&quot;, and on that day a crowd, which he roughly estimated to number about 30 people, gathered near Pearse&#x27;s farm, the edge of which was only about from the school. Casey recalled that Miss Crowley let her students out of school to watch the event. According to Casey&#x27;s account and estimations, after a short run of about Pearse&#x27;s flying machine lifted off from an elevated part of the paddock, rose to about and, after flying two and a half circuits of the field, perhaps , landed on the gorse hedge separating the corner paddock from his workshop paddock. He thought the event lasted about ten minutes. In a letter to Geoff Rodliffe, Casey described the flying machine as having a tricycle undercarriage supporting a wing about 5–6 feet (about 1.5–1.8 metres) above ground and provided an accurate drawing showing the points of takeoff and landing.

The flight had to have occurred before Miss Crowley left the district in September 1903. John Casey moved with his parents William and Margaret to the new Chamberlain settlement near Albury, some from Waitohi, in June 1904.

Casey believed that Pearse&#x27;s brother, Warne, spun the propeller; however, Warne and others apparently never referred to such an impressive flight. Warne had pulled the propeller to start the engine on the previous flight run from the Upper Waitohi School. Casey also named five other people who may have witnessed the flight. Several independently recalled Miss Crowley as their teacher at that time, four described other flight attempts, and the fifth died before he could be interviewed.

If Casey&#x27;s observations could be verified, this would be the first controlled flight in the world by a powered aeroplane.

====1903 April 11, Holy Saturday, Easter: The Terrace Flight, Opihi River, Waitohi====
Robert Mitchell Gibson&#x27;s accounts of a flight were considered by researchers to be amongst the most credible. Born 2 December 1895, he was 8 years old when his older brother Ramsay, age 13 years, took him on another cycle excursion, this time with a number of youths to help Pearse prove his flying machine.

Gibson recalled that Pearse had transported his flying machine with a dray and couple of horses from his shed to a terrace field above the Opihi River. On the first run, the flying machine headed down the hill and into a clump of gorse. After the boys had pulled the machine out and up the top to the dray, they and Pearse inspected the ground for half an hour in preparation for another run. The boys then headed Pearse and his flying machine on toward the cliff but after about they were left behind as the flying machine gathered speed by its own thrust. As the flying machine went over the cliff and into the air, the boys watched it turn and fly up the river up to gradually going downwards. They ran diagonally across the paddock to find a wet Pearse scrambling up the riverbank.

Gibson was certain the flight took place in the Easter school holidays before Easter, or Easter Saturday (11 April), 1903. He dates the flight as having occurred shortly before the severe snowstorm of 1903—the Big Snow. This was the only snow to fall from 1902 to 1905. Gibson also dates the flight as occurring shortly after his brother Ramsey turned 14 in 1903. After his birthday, Ramsey immediately moved away from Waitohi to work. Ramsey never returned to Waitohi and died in 1908.

Gibson also served during the Great War, and recalled that he had been involved in a fight as a result of claiming that he had seen a New Zealander fly before the Wright Brothers. The Royal Navy consistently recorded Gibson&#x27;s character as &quot;VG&quot;.

Gibson&#x27;s later attempts to identify the other youths present at the Opihi River terrace flight were not successful.

The descending upstream flight, as recalled, may be best described as a powered glide, though an engineer&#x27;s calculation of the Opihi River site in the 1970s, based on local government survey data, plotted it as an &quot;almost level flight&quot; of just in length, from a terrace about above the riverbed, descending about to the river—an approximate grade of 1 in 134.

Arthur Tozer, who was about 17 years old at the time, recalled an event similar enough to be the same; that whilst driving a horse-drawn carriage through the Opihi riverbed he saw Pearse fly overhead but thought he had flown on to land on the terrace. Multiple independent hearsay accounts unrelated to Gibson&#x27;s flight were made by several sources. Because of the multiple witness and hearsay accounts, it is considered hard to doubt that Pearse at some time made an attempt to fly off the Opihi River terrace.

====1903 May 2, Saturday: Paddock Flight, Richard Pearse&#x27;s Farm, Waitohi====
Alexander Amos Martin was sure in his accounts of the flight he had seen. He recalled that he was about 16 and a half years old when he saw one of Pearse&#x27;s flights. Martin and his father had finished chaff cutting a stack of sheaves on Dick Connell&#x27;s farm about 2:00 pm. From Upper Waitohi&#x27;s main road he could see an odd contraption in Pearse&#x27;s paddock. Pearse had pushed his bamboo plane out of his shed and after altering the steering, started the engine and taxied for about . The plane then rose up into the air about 10 to 15 feet (3.0–4.6 metres) above ground, flew for about and crashed into a big gorse fence. &quot;He could not go any higher because he had no more Power the engine was all out and the under carriage and wheels caught in the gorse fence.&quot; Martin took off on his bicycle and rode on after his father&#x27;s chaff cutting plant.

Amos Martin stated that, &quot;The time Pearse flew was on May 2nd 1903 at between half past two in the afternoon and four o&#x27;clock.&quot; &quot;It was the year of the Big Snow.&quot; Writing to Joseph Coll on 23 May 1967, Martin said &quot;I say this that it was Pay-day and Pay-day was the first Saturday of the month.&quot; He left Temuka for the coalmine at Nightcaps, Southland, in August 1903.

====1903: Paddock Flight, Richard Pearse&#x27;s Farm, Waitohi====
Daisy Moore Crawford (later Mrs. McLean), born 1892, recalled that she saw Pearse&#x27;s flying machine in the air. She was with her father, William, who was a close friend of Pearse, on the hillside at the back of Pearse&#x27;s farm. When interviewed by Anna Cotterill and filmed by Hutton for TV One News in 1976, she said: &quot;I can remember it lifting up and coming down, and veering towards the road where there was a gorse fence, and landed on the gorse fence. And that gorse fence and the plane stuck in my mind, always!&quot; Daisy didn&#x27;t think he&#x27;d hurt himself but had landed with the cushion effect of the gorse hedge. When asked if there were a lot of people watching him, Daisy replied: &quot;There was no one watching him! Well there was those girls up at the hill like, but, down, when you come down near the homestead, his own little cottage, on the right hand side, over, there was just himself and his plane. But I can remember there might have been somebody on the road, but I never saw anyone [watching him].&quot; In a letter to Geoff Rodliffe dated 5 September 1976, Clifford Crawford, Daisy&#x27;s brother, said Daisy was certain the event occurred on Tuesday, 31 March 1903.

====1903 April–May====
Frank James Biggs of Taiko, born 28 September 1890, was educated at Fairview School, Fairview, Timaru, some from Waitohi, after the family moved there in 1898. He recalled his teacher at Fairview, Mrs. Christian Ritchie, telling the children that Pearse had flown. Writing to Joseph Coll on 25 May 1967, Frank Biggs said, &quot;Now regarding the flight, I can remember it pretty clearly it would be late April or early May. Spud digging time. I think Mr. Martin as he witnessed the flight would be correct with his statement.&quot; Biggs thought the year to be between 1902 and 1904. Mrs. Ritchie, head teacher at Fairview School since 1894, retired from teaching in April 1906, and presented with gifts from her many friends and well wishers, left the settlement.

====1903====
Sisters, Annie Fraser (later Mrs. Casey) and Margaret Fraser (later Mrs. Esler), recalled that they were on a hill filling sacks of potatoes dug by David Stumbles, when they heard Pearse&#x27;s flying machine in the distance. They piled up potatoes and threatened that if Pearse flew in their direction they would pelt him with spuds.

===Experiments on aerial navigation===
Pearse continued to develop the ability to achieve fully controlled flight. He incorporated small &quot;ailerons&quot;. Diagrams and eyewitness recollections agree that Pearse placed controls for pitch and yaw at the trailing edge of the low-aspect-ratio kite-type permanently stalled wing. This control placement (located in turbulent air-flow, and close to the centre of gravity) would have had minimal, possibly inadequate, turning moment to control the pitch or yaw of the aircraft. The Wright brothers, in comparison, successfully applied the principles of airfoil wing-profile and three-axis control to produce fully controlled flight.

====1909====

Pearse reappeared in the newspapers in late 1909 with his latest huge 700–900 sq ft. flying machine powered by a 24 horsepower motor. In a 1928 letter to &quot;The Star&quot;, Christchurch, Pearse summarised his progress in this particular &quot;oval-shaped&quot; monoplane:
At the trials it would start to rise off the ground when a speed of twenty miles an hour was attained. This speed was not sufficient to work the rudders, so, on account of its huge size and low speed, it was uncontrollable, and would spin round broadside on directly it left the ground. So I never flew with my first experimental &#x27;plane, but no one else did with their first for that matter.
The &quot;Otago Witness&quot;, 1 December 1909, also observed that &quot;Mr. Pearse has always been of an inventive turn of mind, as a visit to his workshop will show. Just lately the &quot;Scientific American&quot; printed an idea of his for an improved sparking plug for either high or low tension.&quot; Following many searches, researchers had doubts that this article existed, until it came to light during a search of Auckland Libraries’ bound volumes in 1999. R W Pearse&#x27;s &quot;The Handy Man&#x27;s Spark Plug&quot; was published in the 4 September 1909 issue of &quot;Scientific American&quot;, and again in Alexander Russell Bond&#x27;s &quot;Handy Man&#x27;s Workshop and Laboratory&quot;, a Scientific American Series publication, in 1910. Pearse&#x27;s handy man&#x27;s spark plug, having a wire within a central tube, utilised the pressure of the engine&#x27;s compression stroke to operate a valve, to vibrate the connected terminal wire into contact the central tube&#x27;s terminal, to produce multiple sparks.

Pearse&#x27;s work was not clearly reported at the time; no contemporary newspaper accounts appear to exist of his earliest efforts. Pearse&#x27;s own statements, interpreted though modern day lenses, have bamboozled many researchers, writers and critics. For many years such led the few who knew of his feats to accept 1904 as the date of flying. Unconcerned about posterity and in remote New Zealand, he received no public credit for his work during his lifetime. Pearse patented his design, but his innovations—such as ailerons and the lightweight air-cooled engine—did not succeed in influencing others.

===Later activities===
Pearse moved to Milton in Otago in about 1911 and discontinued his flying experiments due to the hillier country there. Much of his experimental equipment got dumped in a farm rubbish-pit. However, he continued experimenting and produced a number of inventions. He subsequently moved to Christchurch in the 1920s, where he built three houses and lived off the rentals.

Throughout the 1930s and 1940s, Pearse continued to work on constructing a tilt-rotor flying-machine for personal use – sometimes described as a cross between a windmill and a rubbish-cart. His design resembled an autogyro or helicopter, but involved a tilting propeller/rotor and monoplane wings, which, along with the tail, could fold to allow storage in a conventional garage. He intended the vehicle for driving on the road (like a car) as well for flying.

In 1951, aged 73 years, he was admitted to Sunnyside Hospital, Christchurch, diagnosed as suffering from arteriosclerotic psychosis, a common ailment among the elderly. He died there two years later. Researchers believe that many of his papers were destroyed at that time.

==Claims==
The Public Trustee administered Pearse&#x27;s estate following his death in 1953. The trust officer was instructed to place the properties and saleable articles up for auction and dump Pearse&#x27;s patented convertiplane invention. Setting in motion a serendipitous train of events, the auctioneer George Anderson offered the convertiplane to the Canterbury Aero Club. Following inspection by the club&#x27;s chief flying instructor, engineer and captain, their captain, Harry Walker, purchased it himself for £5 in June 1954 to save it from the scrap heap. They transported it to the club&#x27;s hangar at Harewood, along with Pearse&#x27;s powercycle as part of the lot. Intrigued by the shed find, Walker also rescued, examined and sorted what was left of Pearse&#x27;s papers and patents from the trustee&#x27;s rubbish heap and the yard. Sometime later, during a stopover at Christchurch Airport, Captain John Malcolm, NAC, caught sight of Pearse&#x27;s dismantled convertiplane in the hangar, and reported the find to aviation pioneer George Bolt in Auckland. As a result, Bolt went to see Pearse&#x27;s last flying machine during his next visit to Christchurch in March 1956. It is at this point that the tide turned for Richard William Pearse and his lifetime pursuit of aviation invention, from certain obliteration to recognition.

In 1958, Bolt excavated the South Canterbury dump site and discovered some components, including a propeller. His research in the 1950s and 1960s produced evidence for flight in 1903: people who had left the district by 1904 remembered the events, and recalled a particularly harsh winter with heavy snow.

During filming of a television documentary in the 1970s, the crew attached a replica of Pearse&#x27;s 1902–03 machine by a rope to a horse. When the horse bolted, the pilotless machine took to the air and flew laterally stable for some considerable distance before landing clumsily with slight damage, surprising all and prompting an impression that it was flyable. Unfortunately, as the cameras had been put aside, the event went unfilmed.

== Uncertainty of flight experiment dates ==

In mid-1958 Researcher George Bolt had tentatively concluded that all of his evidence showed that Pearse had conducted a public flight experiment on 31 March 1903 when two newspaper clippings had been found in the Pearse family album.   They revealed that Pearse had sent a letter to the press on 10 May 1915, stating that “After Langley’s failure in 1903, I was still of the opinion that aerial navigation was possible, and I started out to solve the problem, about March, 1904.  The Wright Brothers started at about the same time.”  Pearse also sent a letter to the press on 15 September 1928, stating that “I started my experiments on aerial navigation about February, 1904, with a monoplane which I had designed and constructed.”  In writing these words Pearse had been his own worst enemy because George Bolt took Pearse’s remarks about starting his aviation experiments in early 1904 (after the Wright Brothers) at face value and no longer pursued his enquiries with the same degree of enthusiasm.  

With additional evidence researchers later recognised from the 1915 letter that Pearse regarded both his and the Wright Brothers early powered ‘flights’ as tentative efforts.    They determined that the most likely explanation for the discrepancy between the 1903 witness testimonies and Pearse’s own remarks, was that Pearse considered his 1902 to 1903 powered paddock hops and the publicly witnessed take off of March 31, 1903 to be preliminaries to the more serious work involved in achieving absolute navigational control in the air.  

Historian Gordan Ogilvie writes in his biography of Richard Pearse that it is likely that the first publicly witnessed take off took place on 31 March 1903, and that Pearse had certainly achieved a number of tentative flights by 1909 but concludes that readers will need to make up their own minds.    The Museum of Transport and Technology (MOTAT) in Auckland, finds 31 March 1903 to be the most likely date of Richard Pearse’s first publicly witnessed powered take-off.

Some aviation historians cite Pearse’s statement in a 17 November 1909 newspaper interview that he &quot;did not attempt anything practical with the idea until, in 1904, the St Louis Exposition authorities offered a prize” as evidence that Pearse did not begin the construction of an aircraft before 1904, thus disregarding Pearse’s 1915 and 1928 statements; and claim that the 1902 to 1903 witnesses are unnamed and did not remember events or dates accurately.  This is despite, Gordon Ogilvie&#x27;s book ‘The Riddle of Richard Pearse’ recording no less than 48 named eyewitness accounts that were able to personally testify to witnessing Pearse&#x27;s aircraft development and subsequent attempts at powered flight over the period 1902 to 1904. Some were able to date their testimony accurately because of the date that they had moved away from the Waitohi area.  These witness testimonies are held in the Walsh Memorial Library in Auckland.

===Question of flight===
Ever since the first aviation experiments, the use of the term &quot;flight&quot; has often been contentious because it has no universally agreed definition. Researcher Geoff Rodliffe used the dictionary definition of the term to describe a powered flying machine being airborne for even a short time. Early aviators, such as the Wright brothers, viewed flight as being sustained, controlled and powered in a heavier-than-air flying machine to a predetermined location, or &quot;aerial navigation&quot;. With regard to takeoff method—Wright biplane fixed to location by use of ground mounted launching rails, and assistance of a catapult; Pearse was more strict with his definition of flight, rejecting the use of a launching apparatus. His monoplane had a steerable pneumatic tyred tricycle undercarriage to &quot;solve the problem of starting&quot; flight. In 1915 Pearse wrote in a letter to a newspaper:
The honour of inventing the aeroplane cannot be assigned wholly to one man; like most inventions, it is the product of many minds. After all, there is nothing that succeeds like success, and for this reason, pre-eminence will undoubtedly be given to the Wright Brothers, of America, as they were the first to actually make successful flights with a motor-driven aeroplane. At most America can only claim to have originated the aeroplane. The honour of perfecting it and placing it on its present footing belongs to France.
Pearse summarises his achievements in a 1928 letter to a newspaper:
At the trials it would start to rise off the ground when a speed of twenty miles an hour was attained. This speed was not sufficient to work the rudders, so, on account of its huge size and low speed, it was uncontrollable, and would spin round broadside on directly it left the ground. So I never flew with my first experimental &#x27;plane, but no one else did with their first for that matter.
From 1999, the Centennial of Flight (USA), Richard Pearse Centenary of Flight (NZ) and 100 Years of Flight (RAeS, UK), settled on 1903–2003 for the commemoration of those aeroplane pioneers in 2003.

==Legacy==
At the dawn of the 20th century, a number of enthusiasts in several countries advanced towards powered heavier-than-air flight. Pearse, as one of several designers contemporary with the Wrights, advanced some distance towards controlled flight. However, Pearse&#x27;s designs and achievements remained virtually unknown beyond the few who witnessed them and they had no impact on his contemporary aviation designers.

Museum of Transport and Technology (MOTAT) in Auckland holds Pearse&#x27;s last aeroplane, a tilt-rotor convertiplane, his 25 hp four-cylinder engine and metal propeller from the later first flying machine, his powercycle and other original artefacts. The collection includes the flying machine created for the 1975 television docudrama &quot;Richard Pearse&quot;, based on Pearse&#x27;s patent, witness descriptions and early 1900s technology.

South Canterbury Museum in Timaru displays material relating to Pearse and to his contribution to early aviation.

Pleasant Point Museum and Railway in Pleasant Point displays original Pearse engine artefacts and other items.

South Canterbury Aviation Heritage Centre at Richard Pearse Airport, Timaru displays material relating to Pearse. The collection includes interpretations of Pearse&#x27;s earliest flying machine constructed for the Richard Pearse Centenary of Flight 1903-2003 (MOTAT and South Canterbury Aviation Heritage Centre), for experiment and public display, along with several experimental two-cylinder engine reconstructions based on the remnants and descriptions of Richard Pearse&#x27;s original engines.
The Richard Pearse Memorial stands at Waitohi, South Canterbury, where Pearse made attempts at powered flight ().

The South Island lakeside town of Wānaka has a line of tiles mounted on the sidewalk by the lake listing important historic world and New Zealand events. The 1903 tile says that the first powered flight in history occurred in Timaru, and at the bottom of the tile for 1903 the Wright Brothers were listed as having also flown that year. Millennium path tiles were removed in 2019 in preparation for future lake shore redevelopment.

<doc id="201973" wikidata="Q219825" url="?curid=201973" title="National Convention">
<text>The National Convention () was the constituent assembly of the Kingdom of France for one day and the French First Republic for its first three years during the French Revolution, following the two-year National Constituent Assembly and the one-year Legislative Assembly. Created after the great insurrection of 10 August 1792, it was the first French government organized as a republic, abandoning the monarchy altogether. The Convention sat as a single-chamber assembly from 20 September 1792 to 26 October 1795 (4 Brumaire IV under the Convention&#x27;s adopted calendar).

The Convention came about when the Legislative Assembly decreed the provisional suspension of King Louis XVI and the convocation of a National Convention to draw up a new constitution with no monarchy. The other major innovation was to decree that deputies to that Convention should be elected by all Frenchmen 21 years old or more, domiciled for a year and living by the product of their labor. The National Convention was, therefore, the first French assembly elected by a suffrage without distinctions of class.

Although the Convention lasted until 1795, power was effectively delegated by the Convention and concentrated in the small Committee of Public Safety from April 1793. The eight months from the fall of 1793 to the spring of 1794, when Maximilien Robespierre and his allies dominated the Committee of Public Safety, represent the most radical and bloodiest phase of the French Revolution, known as the Reign of Terror. After the fall of Robespierre, the Convention lasted for another year until a new constitution was written, ushering in the French Directory.

== Elections ==
The indirect election took place from 2 to 10 September 1792 after the election of the electoral colleges by primary assemblies on 26 August. Despite the introduction of universal male suffrage, the turn-out was low, though there was an increase in comparison to the 1791 elections—in 1792 11.9% of a greatly increased electorate votes, compared to 10.2% of a much smaller electorate in the 1791.
The low turn-out was partly due to a fear of victimization; in Paris, Maximilien Robespierre presided over the elections and, in concert with the radical press, managed to exclude any candidate of royalist sympathies. In the whole of France, only eleven primary assemblies wanted to retain the monarchy. The electoral assemblies all tacitly voted for a &quot;republic&quot;, though only Paris used that word. The elections returned the same sort of men that the active citizens had chosen in 1791.

On 20 September the Convention held its first session in the &quot;Salle des Cent-Suisses;&quot; the next day it moved to the Salle du Manège, which had little room for the public and bad acoustics. From 10 May 1793 it met in the Salle des Machines, an immense hall in which the deputies were loosely scattered. The Salle des Machines had galleries for the public who often influenced the debates with interruptions or applause.

The members of the Convention came from all classes of society, but the most numerous were lawyers. 75 members had sat in the National Constituent Assembly, 183 in the Legislative Assembly. The full number of deputies was 749, not counting 33 from the French colonies, of whom only some arrived in Paris in time. Thomas Paine and Anacharsis Cloots were appointed in the Convention by Girondins. Besides these, however, the newly formed annexed to France from 1782 to 1789 were allowed to send deputations.

According to its own ruling, the Convention elected its president every fortnight, and the outgoing president was eligible for re-election after the lapse of a fortnight. Ordinarily, the sessions were held in the morning, but evening sessions also occurred frequently, often extending late into the night. Sometimes in exceptional circumstances, the Convention declared itself in permanent session and sat for several days without interruption. For both legislative and administrative the Convention used committees, with powers more or less widely extended and regulated by successive laws. The most famous of these committees included the Committee of Public Safety and the Committee of General Security.

== Political breakdown ==
The National Convention was made up of three major factions: The Montagnards (the Mountain), the Marais (the Plain) and the Girondins, also called Brissotins. Historians are divided on the makeup of the Convention, but the current consensus is that the Mountain was the biggest faction with around 302–309 deputies. The Girondins were represented by 178–227 deputies, and the Plain was represented by 153–250 deputies. Of the three groups the Mountain was the most cohesive, and the Plain was the least cohesive. Over 94% of the Mountain voted similarly on core issues; comparatively the Girondins and the Plain were much more divided with only 70% of Girondins voting similarly on the same issues and only 58% of the Plain voting similarly on the same issues.

== Girondin Convention ==
The first session was held on 20 September 1792. The following day, the assembly agreed to the proposition &quot;That royalty be abolished in France&quot; and was carried with cheers. On 22 September news arrived of the Battle of Valmy. On the same day, it was decreed that &quot;in future the acts of the assembly shall be dated &quot;First Year of the French Republic&quot;&quot;. Three days later, the corollary that &quot;the French republic is one and indivisible&quot; was added to guard against federalism. A republic had been proclaimed but remained to enact a republican government. The country was little more republican in feeling or practice than it had been before at any time since Varennes but now had to become a republic because it no longer had a king.

When the Convention met, the military situation was undergoing an extraordinary transformation that seemed to confirm the Girondin prophecies of easy victory. After Valmy, the Prussians withdrew to the frontier, and in November, French troops occupied the left bank of the Rhine. The Austrians, who had besieged Lille in October, were defeated by Dumouriez at the Battle of Jemappes on 6 November and evacuated the Austrian Netherlands. Nice was occupied, and Savoy proclaimed its union with France. The successes made it safe to quarrel at home.

===Girondins and Montagnards===
The Girondins were more conservative than the Montagnards, although they were still democrats. The Girondins drew their name from the Gironde, a region of France from which many of the deputies of this faction were elected (although many &quot;Girondins&quot; were actually Parisian by origin) and were also known as the Brissotins after their most prominent speaker, Jacques Pierre Brissot. The Montagnards drew their support from the Paris Commune and the popular societies such as the Jacobin Club and the Cordeliers; they got their name from the high bleachers on which they sat while the Convention was in session.

Three issues dominated the first months of the National Convention: revolutionary violence, the trial of the king, and the Parisian dominance of politics. Antagonism between Paris and the provinces created friction among the people that served as a propaganda tool and combat weapon for the two groups. The departments and districts resisted the idea of centralization. They saw the idea being symbolised by the desire to reduce the capital of the Revolution to a minuscule share of influence. Much of the Gironde wished to remove the Assembly from a city dominated by &quot;agitators and flatterers of the people&quot; but did not yet encourage an aggressive federalism, which would have run counter to its political ambitions.

=== The Plain ===
The Plain was a third faction during the Convention. It derived its name from their place on the floor of the Convention. During the start of the Convention, they sided with the Girondins, however, as it progressed and the Montagnards began to push for the execution of Louis XVI, The Plain began to side with them.

===Trial and execution of the king===

The Convention&#x27;s unanimous declaration of a French Republic on 21 September 1792 left open the fate of the former king. A commission was therefore established to examine the evidence against him while the Convention&#x27;s Legislation Committee considered legal aspects of any future trial. Most Montagnards favoured judgment and execution, but the Girondins were divided concerning Louis&#x27;s fate, with some arguing for royal inviolability, others supporting clemency and still others advocating lesser punishment or banishment. On 13 November Robespierre stated that a constitution which Louis had violated, despite declaring his inviolability, could not be used in his defence. Robespierre had been taken ill and had done little other than support Montagnard leader Louis Antoine de Saint-Just, who gave his first major speech, in his argument against the king&#x27;s inviolability. On 20 November, opinion turned sharply against Louis following the discovery of a secret cache of 726 documents consisting of Louis&#x27;s personal communications with bankers and ministers. At his trial, he claimed not to recognise documents that had been clearly signed by him.

The trial began on 10 December. The Montagnards put the debate on the ideological level. Louis XVI was classified as an enemy, who was alien to the body of the nation and as a &quot;usurper&quot;. Balloting began on 15 January 1793. Each deputy explained his vote at the rostrum. The vote against the king was unanimous. There was to be no popular referendum, as Girondins had hoped. The fatal vote started on 16 January and continued until the next day. Of the 726 deputies present, 361 declared themselves in favor of the death penalty without condition; 26 voted for death on condition that the Mailhe amendment be applied; 334 were opposed (including 44 who voted for death with reprieve); 5 abstained or recused. On 19 January the question of reprieve was put to a vote: 380 votes were cast against and 310 for (2 voted on condition; 10 abstained or recused). Each time, the Girondins had split.

On the morning of 21 January the Convention ordered the entire National Guard to line both sides of the route to the scaffold. Louis was beheaded at the Place de la Revolution. Within the nation, &quot;voters&quot; and &quot;appellants&quot; (those for or against the execution of Louis) swore undying hatred of each other. The rest of Europe, fearing the outcome of the French Revolution in their own countries, decreed a war of extermination against regicides.

=== Crisis and fall of Girondins ===
The Assembly began harmoniously, but within a few days the Girondins launched a bitter attack on their Montagnard opponents. Conflict continued without interruption until the expulsion of the Girondin leaders from the Convention on 2 June 1793. The Girondins had relied on votes from the majority of the deputies, many of whom were alarmed as well as scandalized by the September Massacres, but their insistence on monopolising all positions of authority during the Convention, and their attacks on the Montagnard leaders, soon irritated them and caused them to regard the party as a faction. One by one, deputies such as Couthon, Cambon, Carnot, Lindet and Barère began to gravitate towards the Montagnards and the majority. The Plain held itself aloof from both sides.

Girondins were convinced that their opponents aspired to a bloody dictatorship, but the Montagnards believed that the Girondins were ready for any compromise with conservatives and even royalists to guarantee their remaining in power. The bitter enmity soon reduced the Convention to a state of limbo. Debate after debate degenerated into verbal brawling from which no decision could emerge. The political deadlock, which had repercussions all over France, eventually drove men to accept dangerous allies: royalists in the case of Girondins, &quot;sans-culottes&quot; in that of the Montagnards.
Thus, the struggle within the Convention continued without results. The decision was to come from outside. Since the king&#x27;s trial, the &quot;sans-culottes&quot; had been constantly assailing the &quot;appealers&quot; (&quot;appelants&quot;), quickly came to desire their expulsion from the Convention and demanded the establishing a Revolutionary Tribunal to deal with supposed aristocratic plots. Military setbacks from the First Coalition, Charles François Dumouriez&#x27;s defection to the enemy, and the War in the Vendée (which began in March 1793) were all used as arguments by Montagnards and &quot;sans-culottes&quot; to portray Girondins as soft. The Montagnards proposed measures, but the Girondins were reluctant to take such measures. The Girondins were forced to accept the Montagnards&#x27; creation of the Revolutionary Tribunal and a Committee of Public Safety. Social and economic difficulties exacerbated the tensions between the groups.

The final showdown, the insurrection of 31 May – 2 June 1793, was precipitated by Jean-Paul Marat&#x27;s trial and the arrest of sectional activists. On 25 May, the Paris Commune marched to the Convention to demand the release of the activists. In reply, Maximin Isnard, who was presiding over the Convention, launched into a diatribe reminiscent of the Brunswick Manifesto: &quot;If any attack made on the persons of the representatives of the nation, then I declare to you in the name of the whole country that Paris would be destroyed&quot;. On the next day, the Jacobins declared themselves in a state of insurrection. On 28 May, the &quot;Cité&quot; section called the other sections to a meeting in order to organize the insurrection. On 29 May, the delegates representing 33 of the sections formed an insurrectionary committee of nine members. On 2 June, 80,000 armed &quot;sans-culottes&quot; surrounded the Convention. After an attempt of deputies to leave was stopped with guns, the deputies resigned themselves to declare the arrest of 29 leading Girondins. In that way, the Gironde ceased to be a political force.

== Montagnard Convention ==

Scarcely had the Gironde been eliminated when the Convention, under Montagnard leadership, found itself caught between two threats. While the federalist revolt gained strength, the popular movement, roused to fury by high prices, was increasing the pressure it exercised on the government. Meanwhile, the government was proving incapable of controlling the situation. In July 1793, the nation appeared to be on the point of falling apart.

In June the Montagnards played for time. On 3 June the sale of the property of emigrants, in small parcels and payable in ten years, was decreed; on the 10 June, the optional division of common lands by head; and on 17 July, the abolition, without compensation, of all that remained of manorial rights. The Montagnards attempted to reassure the middle classes by rejecting any idea of terror, by protecting property rights and by restricting the popular movement to very narrowly-circumscribed limits. It was a delicate balance to achieve, a balance that was destroyed in July by the worsening of the crisis. The Convention rapidly approved the new constitution in the hope to clear itself of the charge of dictatorship and calm the anxieties of the departments.

=== Constitution of 1793 ===

The Declaration of Rights, which precedes the text of the Constitution, solemnly reaffirmed the nation&#x27;s indivisibility and the great principles of equality, liberty, security, and property. In contrast to the Declaration of 1789, the 1793 added rights to public assistance, work, education and insurrection.

The chief aim of the Constitution was to ensure the major role of the deputies in the Convention, which was seen as being the essential basis for political democracy. The Legislative Assembly was to be elected by direct vote cast for a single member, deputies were elected on receiving a simple majority of the votes cast, and the assembly would sit for one year. The executive council of 24 members was chosen by the Legislative Assembly from among the 83 candidates chosen by the departments on the basis of universal male suffrage, and in that way, ministers were made responsible to the representatives. The exercise of popular suffrage was widened through the institution of the referendum. The Constitution was to be ratified by the people, as were laws in certain precisely defined circumstances.

The Constitution was submitted for popular ratification and adopted by a huge margin of more than 1,801,918 in favour to some 17,610 against. The results of the plebiscite were made public on 10 August 1793, but the application of the Constitution, the text of which was placed in an ark in the debating-chamber of the Convention, was postponed until peace had been made.

=== Federalist revolt and war ===

Indeed, the Montagnards faced dramatic circumstances: federalist insurrection, war in the Vendée, military failures, and a worsening economic situation. Despite everything, a new civil war could not be avoided. By the middle of June, about 60 departments were in more or less open rebellion. However, the frontier departments had remained faithful to the Convention. The rising was widespread, rather than deep. It was essentially the work of the departmental and district administrations. The communes, which were more popular in composition, showed themselves in general lukewarm or hostile, and federalist leaders soon became divided among themselves. Sincere republicans among them could not fail to be uneasy about the foreign invasion and the Vendée. Those who were seeing themselves rejected by the people sought support from the moderates, the Feuillants and even the aristocrats.

July and August were bad months on the frontiers. Within three weeks Mainz, the symbol of previous successes, capitulated to the Prussians, and the Austrians captured the fortresses of Condé and Valenciennes and invaded northern France. Spanish troops crossed the Pyrenees and began advancing on Perpignan in the War of the Pyrenees. The Piedmontese took advantage of the diversion of republican forces at Lyons in order to invade France from the east. In Corsica, Paoli&#x27;s revolt expelled the French from the island with British support. British troops opened the Siege of Dunkirk in August, and in October, the allies invaded Alsace. The military situation had become desperate.

In addition were other incidents that compounded the fury of the revolutionaries and convinced them that their opponents had abandoned all restraint of civilized behavior. On 13 July Charlotte Corday murdered the &quot;sans-culotte&quot; idol Jean-Paul Marat. She had been in touch with Girondin rebels in Normandy, and they were believed to have used her as their agent.

The lack of forethought displayed by the Convention during the first few days was redeemed by its vigor and skill in organizing measures of repression. Warrants were issued for the arrest of the rebellious Girondin leaders. The members of the revolting departmental administration were deprived of their office.

The regions in which the revolt was dangerous were those in which a large number of royalists had remained. There was no room for a third party between the Mountain, which was identified with the republic, and royalism, which was the ally of the enemy. The royalist insurrection in the Vendée had already led the Convention to take a long step in the direction of the terror: that is to say, the dictatorship of central power and the suppression of liberties. The Girondin insurrection prompted it to take a decisive step in the same direction.

=== Revolutionary government ===

The Constituent Assembly had legislated through its commissions. The Convention governed by means of its committees. Two of them were of essential importance: Public Safety and General Security. The second, which had formidable powers, is less well known than the first, which was the true executive authority and was armed with immense prerogatives. It dated from April, but its composition was thoroughly reshuffled during the summer of 1793.

The summer of 1793 saw &quot;sans-culotte&quot; disturbances reach a peak under a double banner: price fixing and terror. On top came the news of unprecedented treason: Toulon and its squadron had been handed over to the enemy. In the name of the wretched poverty of the people, the leaders of the &quot;enragés&quot;, with Jacques Roux at their head, called for a planned economy from a Convention, which had no liking for the idea. However, the revolutionary logic of the mobilization of resources by national dictatorship was infinitely more powerful than economic doctrine. In August, a series of decrees gave the authorities discretionary powers over the production and circulation of grain and ferocious punishments for fraud. &quot;Granaries of plenty&quot; were prepared, to stock corn requisitioned by authorities in each district. On 23 August, the decree on the &quot;levée en masse&quot; turned able-bodied civilians into soldiers.

On 5 September, Parisians tried to repeat the revolt of 2 June. Armed &quot;sections&quot; again encircled the Convention to demand the setting up of an internal revolutionary army, the arrest of suspects and a purge of the committees. It was probably the key day in the formation of the revolutionary government: the convention yielded, but kept control of events. It put Terror on the agenda on 5 September, on the 6th elected Collot d&#x27;Herbois and Billaud-Varenne to the Committee of Public Safety, on the 9th created the revolutionary army, on the 11th decreed the Maximum for grain and fodder (general controls for prices, and wages on the 29th), on the 14th reorganized the Revolutionary Tribunal, on the 17th voted in the law on suspects, and on the 20th gave the local revolutionary committees the task of drawing up lists of them.

The dictatorship of the Convention and the committees, simultaneously supported and controlled by the Parisian sections, representing the sovereign people in permanent session, lasted from June to September. It governed through a network of institutions set up haphazardly since spring in March, the Revolutionary Tribunal and representatives on missions in the departments and was followed the next month by the Convention&#x27;s representatives to the armies, also armed with unlimited powers; and enforced acceptance of &quot;assignat&quot; as the sole legal tender, price controls for grain and the forced loan of a billion livres from the rich.

At last, France saw a government take shape. Danton resigned from it on 10 July. Couthon, Saint-Just, Jeanbon Saint-Andre, and Prieur of the Marne formed a nucleus of resolute Montagnards who rallied Barère and Lindet, then successfully added Robespierre on 27 July, Carnot and Prieur of Cote-d&#x27;Ore on 14 August, and Collot d&#x27;Herbois and Billaud-Varenne on 6 September. They had a few clear ideas to which they clung: to command, to fight, and to conquer. Their work in common, the danger, the taste of and pride in power created solidarity that made the Committee an autonomous organism.

The committee was always managed collegially, despite the specific nature of the tasks of each director: the division into &quot;politicians&quot; and &quot;technicians&quot; was a Thermidorian invention, intended to lay the corpses of the Terror at the door of the Robespierrists alone. Many things, however, set the twelve committee members at loggerheads; Barère was more a man of the Convention than of the committee and was a link with The Plain. Robert Lindet had qualms about the Terror which, by contrast, was the outstanding theme of Collot d&#x27;Herbois and Billaud-Varenne, latecomers to the committee, forced on it by the &quot;sans-culottes&quot; in September; unlike Robespierre and his friends, Lazare Carnot had given his support only provisionally and for reasons of state to a policy concession to the people. But the situation which united them in the summer of 1793 was stronger than those differences of opinion. The Committee had to set itself above all, and choose those popular demands which were most suitable for achieving the Assembly&#x27;s aims: to crush the enemies of the Republic and dash the last hopes of the aristocracy. To govern in the name of the Convention, at the same time controlling it, and to restrain the people without quenching their enthusiasm—this was a gamble.

The ensemble of institutions, measures and procedures which constituted it was codified in a decree of 14 Frimaire (4 December) which set the seal on what had been the gradual development of centralized dictatorship founded on the Terror. In the center was the Convention, whose secular arm was the Committee of Public Safety, vested with immense powers: it interpreted the Convention&#x27;s decrees and settled their methods of application; under its immediate authority it had all state bodies and all civil servants (even ministers would disappear in April 1794); it directed military and diplomatic activity, appointed generals and members of other committees, subject to ratification by the Convention. It held responsibility for conducting war, public order and the provisioning of the population. The Commune of Paris, a famous &quot;sans-culotte&quot; bastion, was neutralized by coming under its control.

====Economy====
Administrative and economic centralization went hand in hand. The state of siege forced France into autarky; to save the Republic the government mobilized all the nation&#x27;s productive forces and reluctantly accepted the need for a controlled economy, which it introduced extemporaneously, as the emergency required. It was necessary to develop war production, revive foreign trade, and find new resources in France itself, and time was short. Circumstances gradually compelled it to assume the economic government of the country. Along with organization of the army, this was the most original feature of its work.

All material resources were subjected to requisitioning. Farmers surrendered their grain, fodder, wool, flax, and hemp. Artisans and merchants gave up their manufactured products. Raw materials were carefully sought out: metal of all kinds, church bells, old paper, rags and parchments, grasses, brushwood, and even household ashes for manufacturing of potassium salts, and chestnuts for distilling. All businesses were placed at the disposal of the nation: forests, mines, quarries, furnaces, forges, tanneries, paper mills, large cloth factories and shoe making workshops. The labor of men and the value of things were subject to price controls. No one had a right to speculate at the cost of &quot;Patrie&quot; while it was in danger. Armaments caused more concern. As early as September 1793 efforts were made to create a large factory in Paris for rifles and sidearms. A special appeal was made to scientists. Monge, Vandermonde, Berthollet, Darcet, Fourcroy perfected metallurgy and manufacture of arms.

Only to the wage earners did the Maximum seem thoroughly advantageous. It increased wages by one-half in relation to 1790, and commodities by only one-third. But since the Committee did not ensure that it was respected (except for bread), they would have been duped had they not been benefiting from the favorable conditions that a great war always offers the labor force. Still Paris became calmer because the &quot;sans-culottes&quot; were gradually finding ways to subsist; the &quot;levée en masse&quot; and the formation of the revolutionary army were thinning their ranks; many now were working in arms and equipment shops or in the offices of the committees and ministries, which were expanded enormously.

====Army of the Year II====

During the summer the requisition of the levy was completed and by July the total strength of the army reached 650,000. The difficulties were tremendous. The war production just started in September. The army was in the middle of the purge. In the spring of 1794, the amalgamation was undertaken. Two battalions of volunteers joined one battalion of regulars to constitute a demi-brigade, or regiment. At the same time, the command was reconstituted. The purge ended with most of the nobles excluded. The new generation reached the highest ranks, and the War College (&quot;Ecole de Mars&quot;) received six young men from each district to improve the staff. Army commanders were to be appointed by the Convention.

What gradually emerged was a well-equipped military command. François Séverin Marceau-Desgraviers, Lazare Hoche, Jean Baptiste Kléber, André Masséna, Jean-Baptiste Jourdan, and a host of others, backed by officers who combined abilities as soldiers and their political sense.

For the first time since the Roman Empire, a government succeeded in arming and feeding great numbers of soldiers. The technical innovations resulted chiefly from its sheer size as well the strategy that developed from it. The old system of cordons lost its prestige. Moving between the armies of the Coalition, the French could maneuver along interior lines, deploy part of their troops along the frontiers and take advantage of the inaction of any one of their enemies to beat the others. Acting &quot;en masse&quot;, and overwhelming the foe by sheer numbers were Carnot&#x27;s principles. They were still untried and not until Bonaparte appeared did they enjoy any great success.

=== Fall of factions ===
As late as September 1793, there were two distinct wings among the revolutionaries. Firstly, those who were later called Hébertists although Jacques Hébert himself was never the official leader of a party that advocated war to the death and adopted the program of the &quot;enragés&quot;, ostensibly because the &quot;sans-culottes&quot; approved it. The Hébertists preferred to side with the Montagnards so long as they could hope to control the Convention through them. They dominated the Cordeliers Club, filled Bouchotte&#x27;s offices, and could generally carry the Commune with them. The other wing was the Dantonists, which formed in response to the increasing centralization of the Revolutionary Government and the dictatorship of the Committees. The Dantonists were led predominately by deputies of the Convention (rather than the sans-culottes), including Danton, Delacroix, and Desmoulins.

Putting the needs of national defense above all other considerations, the Committee of Public Safety had no intentions of giving in to the demands of either the popular movement or the moderates. In order to balance the contradictory demands of these two factions, the Revolutionary Government attempted to maintain a position halfway between the moderate Dantonists (&quot;citras&quot;) and the extremist Hébertists (&quot;ultras&quot;).

But at the end of the winter of 1793–94, the shortage of food took a sharp turn for the worse. The Hébertists incited &quot;sans-culottes&quot; to demand stringent measures, and at first, the Committee proved conciliatory. The Convention voted 10 million livres for relief, on 3 Ventôse, Barère presented a new general Maximum, and on the 8th Saint-Just obtained a decree confiscating the property of suspects and distributing it to the needy (Ventôse Decrees). The Hébertists felt that if they increased the pressure, they would triumph once and for all. Although the call appeared like one for insurrection it was probably just for a new demonstration, like the one in September. However, the Committee of Public Safety decided on 22 Ventôse Year II (12 March 1794) that the Hébertists posed too serious a threat. The Committee linked Hébert, Charles-Philippe Ronsin, François-Nicolas Vincent, and Antoine-François Momoro to the émigrés Proli, Anacharsis Cloots and Pereira, so as to present the Hébertists as parties to the &quot;foreign plot&quot;. All were executed on 4 Germinal (24 March). This move largely silenced the Hébertists, now without their leadership. Having succeeded in stifling dissent on the left, the Committee then turned on the Dantonists, several members of which were implicated in financial corruption. The Committee forced the Convention to lift the parliamentary immunity of nine Dantonist deputies, allowing them to be put on trial. On 5 April Dantonist leaders Danton, Delacroix, Desmoulins, and Philippeaux were executed.

The execution of the leaderships of both rival factions caused some to become disillusioned. Many &quot;sans-culottes&quot; were stunned by the Hébertists&#x27; execution. All positions of influence traditionally held by the sans-culottes were eliminated. The Revolutionary Army was disbanded, the inspectors of food-hoarding were dismissed, Jean Baptiste Noël Bouchotte lost the War Office, the Cordeliers Club was forced to self-censor and the Government pressure brought about closing 39 popular societies. The Paris Commune, controlled by sans-culottes, was purged and filled with Committee nominees. With the execution of the Dantonists, many of the members of the National Convention lost trust in the Committee and even began to fear for their personal safety.

Ultimately, the Committee had undermined its own support by eliminating the Dantonists and Hébertists, both of which had backed the Committee. By compelling the Convention to allow the arrests of the Girondins and Dantonists, the Committee believed that it had destroyed its major opposition. However, the trials demonstrated the Committee&#x27;s lack of respect for members of the Convention, several of whom had been executed. Many Convention members who had sided with the Committee by mid-1794 no longer supported it. The Committee had acted as mediator between the Convention and the &quot;sans-culottes&quot; from which they both had acquired their strength. By executing the Hébertists and alienating the &quot;sans-culottes&quot;, the Committee became unnecessary to the Assembly.

=== Terror ===

Though the Terror was organized in September 1793, it was not introduced until October. It had resulted from a popular movement. A new chapter of the Revolutionary Tribunal was opened after 5 September, divided into four sections: the Committees of Public Safety and General Security were to propose the names of judges and jurymen; Fouquier-Tinville stayed as public prosecutor, and Martial Joseph Armand Herman was nominated president. The Terror was meant to discourage support for the enemies of the Revolution by condemning outspoken critics of the Montagnards.

The great political trials began in October. The queen was guillotined on 16 October. A special decree stifled the defense of 21 Girondins, including Vergniaud and Brissot, and they perished on the 31st.

At the summit of the apparatus of the Terror sat the Committee of General Security, the state&#x27;s second organization. It consisted of twelve members elected each month by the Convention, and vested with security, surveillance and police functions, including over civil and military authorities. It employed a large staff, headed the gradually constituted network of local revolutionary committees and applied the law on suspects by sifting through the thousands of local denunciations and arrests, which it then had to try.

The goal was to strike down alleged enemies of the Revolution, in the provinces and elsewhere, of various classes. According to Albert Mathiez, &quot;The severity of repressive measures in the provinces was in direct proportion to danger of revolt.&quot; Many outspoken members of the community were tried and executed for claims of treason. Camille Desmoulins and Georges Danton were two of the more notable men executed for their &quot;threats&quot; against the Revolution.

Deputies sent as &quot;representatives on mission&quot; by the Committee of Public Safety, armed with full powers, reacted according to both the local situation and their own temperaments. Lindet pacified the Girondin west in July without a single death sentence. In Lyon, some months later, Collot d&#x27;Herbois and Joseph Fouché relied on frequent summary executions by shooting because the guillotine was not working swiftly enough.

=== Slavery ===

The monarchy made a distinction between French soil on the mainland and soil under French control such as the colonies. That distinction allowed for slavery to be illegal in France but continue in the colonies. Colonists in Saint Domingue wanted to have representation, 21 members because of their population size and contribution to the economy. That was shot down by the National Convention as the majority of their population were slaves and thus had no rights as citizens and contributed nothing to representative population. The in France originally opposed slavery during the 1780s, but much of the opposition was ignored as a result of the French Revolution breaking out. The French showed a much greater willingness to act on the issue of slavery when the threat of a war with Spain seemed imminent.

In 1792 the National Convention agreed to delegate 3 commissaries for Saint Domingue. Two of the commissaires, Léger-Félicité Sonthonax and Étienne Polverel, implemented rights for free men of color that were equal to their white counterparts. On 5 May 1793 Sonthonax and Polverel attacked the plantation system and forced the owners to treat the slaves better and care more for their well-being. Sonthonax then attacked slavery itself by freeing any slave Huzards, Latin for hazards, who had been armed by their masters since they could not return to peaceful plantation life. Polverel issued a proclamation in Cap Francais on 21 June 1793, which freed all slaves who agreed to fight for the French Republic from both internal and external threats. The commissaires then ruled that the Republic would pay an indemnity to the owners of female slaves marrying free men and that all children of that union would be free. The National Convention eventually allowed for six representative members for the colony. When pressured by the Society of the Friends of the Blacks to end the slave trade in the colonies, the National Convention refused on the grounds of slavery being too core to the French economic wealth. The committee felt &quot;six million French people relied on the colonies to survive&quot; and continued to stand by the argument.

On 12 October 1790 the National Convention declared the only body of power who could control the status of people in the colonies were committees in the colonies themselves, which meant although free blacks met the requirement for active citizenship, the white colonists would not allow it. That was done in an attempt to please the white colonists and convince them not to join forces with the British. It also gave the colonies the power to control their own laws regarding slavery and allowed for the National Convention to wash their hands of the issue. Three deputies from Saint Domingue traveled to France to attempt to persuade the National Convention to abolish slavery. The National Convention abolished slavery after hearing speeches from the deputies on 4 February 1794. However, the Committee of Public Safety delayed sending the proclamation to the colonies for two months. That was because of the apparent opposition of Robespierre to the abolition of slavery. The issue was eventually resolved by the Committee circumventing Robespierre and ordering the abolition decree to be sent to Saint Domingue. However, Napoleon&#x27;s attempt to return to slavery in 1801 removed France&#x27;s state of being the first to abolish slavery and led to the loss of the most prosperous French colony.

=== Thermidor ===

The Jacobin dictatorship could hope to remain in power only so long as it was dealing successfully with a national emergency. As soon as its political opponents had been destroyed, and its foreign enemies defeated, it would lose the chief force that kept it together. The Jacobin fall happened more rapidly than expected because of issues within the party.

So long as it remained united, the Committee was virtually invulnerable, but it had scarcely attained the apogee of its power before signs of internal conflict appeared. The Committee of Public Safety had never been a homogeneous body. It was a coalition cabinet. Its members were kept together less by comradeship or common ideals than by calculation and routine. The press of business, which at first prevented personal quarrels, also produced tired nerves. Trifling differences were exaggerated into the issues of life and death. Small disputes estranged them from one another. Carnot, in particular, was irritated by the criticisms directed at his plans by Robespierre and Saint-Just. Dispute followed dispute. Bickering broke out on the Committee of Public Safety, with Carnot describing Robespierre and Saint-Just as &quot;ridiculous dictators&quot; and Collot making veiled attacks on the &quot;Incorruptible&quot;. From the end of June to 23 July, Robespierre ceased to attend the Committee.

Realizing the danger of fragmentation, they attempted a reconciliation. Saint-Just and Couthon favored it, but Robespierre doubted the sincerity of his enemies. It was he who brought about the fatal intervention of the Convention. On 8 Thermidor, Year II (26 July 1794), he denounced his opponents and demanded that &quot;unity of government&quot; be realized. When called upon to name those whom he was accusing, however, he refused. That failure destroyed him, for it was assumed that he was demanding a blank cheque. That night, an uneasy alliance was formed from threatened deputies and members of The Plain. On the next day, 9 Thermidor, Robespierre and his friends were not allowed to speak, and Louis Louchet of Aveyron called for the indictment of Robespierre, which the convention accepted. The men of the extreme left played the leading roles: Billaud-Varenne, who attacked, and Collot d&#x27;Herbois, who presided.

On hearing the news the Paris Commune, loyal to the man who had inspired it, called for an insurrection and released the arrested deputies in the evening and mobilized two or three thousand militants. The night of 9–10 Thermidor was one of great confusion in Paris, as the Commune and the Assembly competed for the support of the sections and their troops. The Convention proclaimed that the rebels were henceforth outlaws. Barras was given the task of mustering an armed force, and the moderate sections gave their support. The National Guardsmen and artillerymen assembled outside the were left without instructions and little by little they dispersed and left the square deserted. Around two o&#x27;clock in the morning, a column from Gravilliers section led by Léonard Bourdon burst in the and arrested insurgents.

On the evening of 10 Thermidor (28 July 1794), Robespierre, Saint-Just, Couthon and nineteen of their political allies were executed without trial. The following day, it was the turn of a large batch of 71 men, the largest mass execution in the entire course of the Revolution.

== Thermidorian Convention ==
Whatever reasons the conspirators had behind 9 Thermidor, the events afterwards went beyond their intentions. Evidently, the remaining members on the Committees counted on staying in office and currying the favour of the Jacobin dictatorship, as though nothing more had happened than a party purge.

=== Thermidorian Reaction ===

They were speedily disabused of that notion. Robespierrists might go out and Dantonists come in. The Convention had recovered its initiative and would put an end, once and for all, to the dictatorial committees government, which had ousted it from power. It was decreed that no member of governing committees should hold office for more than four months. Three days later, the Prairial Law was repealed and the Revolutionary Tribunal shorn of its abnormal powers. The Commune was replaced with a Commission of Civil Administrators (&quot;commission des administrateurs civils&quot;) from the ranks of the Convention. In November the Jacobin club was closed. Anti-Robespierrist but also anti-Jacobin reaction was in full flood. At the beginning of September Billaud, Collot and Barère left the Committee of Public Safety; by the end of the year, they were in prison.

The stability of the government was weakening. Next came the concentration of power, another revolutionary principle. The identification of the Committee of Public Safety with the executive was ended on 7 Fructidor (24 August), restricting it to its former domain of war and diplomacy. The Committee of General Security kept its control over the police. There was now to be a total of sixteen committees. &quot;Conventionnels&quot;, while aware of the dangers of fragmentation, were even more worried by its experience of monopoly of powers. In a few weeks the revolutionary government was dismantled.

The measures affected, finally, the instruments of the Terror and opened numerous breaches in the apparatus of repression. The law of 22 Prairial was repealed, the prisons were opened and &quot;suspects&quot; were released: 500 in Paris in a single week. A few public trials were staged, including those of Carrier, held responsible for the mass drowning at Nantes, and Fouquier-Tinville, notorious as the public prosecutor of the Great Terror of the late spring and summer of 1794, after which the Revolutionary Tribunal was quietly put aside. Yet an unofficial White Terror continued. In the provinces the Terror assumed violent and vicious form. In the Lyonnais, the Companions of Jehu flung the bodies of its victims, men and women, into the Rhône, and prisoners were massacred wholesale in gaol or on their way to prison, while in other cities, bands of so-called Companions of the Sun indiscriminately murdered &quot;terrorists&quot;, &quot;patriots of &#x27;89&quot; and, most eagerly of all, purchasers of former Church properties. Such excesses were deplored in Paris, but the Convention and its Committees were powerless to contain forces that they had themselves done much to unleash.

The destruction of the system of revolutionary government eventually brought about the end of the &#x27;Economic Terror&#x27;. &quot;Maximum&quot; was relaxed even before 9 Thermidor. Now virtually nobody believed in price controls any longer. Because the black market was plentifully supplied, the idea took hold that price controls equalled scarcity and that free trade, therefore, would bring back abundance. It was generally supposed by the free trade minded Physiocrat economists within France that prices would at first rise but that then they would fall as a result of competition. This illusion, however, was to be shattered in the winter of 1794–1795. Formally, the National Convention had put the end to the &quot;maximum&quot; as the season had started on the Christmas Eve of 4 Nivôse Year III (24 December 1794).

At the beginning of spring in March–April 1795, scarcity was such that more unrest appeared almost everywhere. The city of Paris was &#x27;active&#x27; once again.

=== Crushing of the popular movement ===

Discontent increased along with the shortages. On 17 March a delegation from &quot;faubourgs Saint-Marceau and Saint-Jacques&quot; complained that &quot;We are on the verge of regretting all the sacrifices that we have made for the Revolution.&quot; Police law was passed which lay down the death penalty for use of seditious language. Arms were distributed to the &quot;good citizens&quot;, the faithful nucleus of the National Guard. The trial of strength was approaching.
On 10 Germinal (30 March) all the sections called their general assemblies. The political geography of Paris emerged clearly from this. Convention debate was centered on two issues: the fate of Barère, Collot, Billaud and Vadier, and the implementation of the constitution of 1793. While in the sections of the center and the west formal addresses called for the punishment of the &quot;Four&quot; and passed over the food shortages, the sections of the east and the &quot;faubourgs&quot; demanded measures to deal with the grain crisis, the implementation of the constitution of 1793, the reopening of the popular societies and the release of the imprisoned patriots.

On the morning of 12 Germinal (1 April) crowds gathered on the &quot;Ile de la Cité&quot; and, pushing aside the palace guards, burst into the chamber where the Convention met. Amidst the uproar, spokesmen of the sections outlined the people&#x27;s grievances. Reliable battalions of National Guard were called and demonstrators, lacking arms and leaders, were forced to withdraw. For the most people it was the constitution of 1793—seen as a liberating utopia—which represented the solution to all evils. There were others who openly regretted the passing of &quot;the reign of Robespierre&quot;.
But it was not the end. A new explosion was on the horizon. Insurrection was being openly prepared. On 1 Prairial (20 May 1795) the alarm bells sounded in the &quot;faubourgs&quot; Saint-Antoine and Marceau. The armed battalions arrived at Place du Carousel and entered the sitting chamber. After an hour of uproar, &quot;The Insurrection of the People&quot; (&quot;L&#x27;Insurrection du Peuple&quot;) was read. In the chaos, none of the ringleaders thought of implementing the key item of the program: the overthrow of the government.

The remainder of the Montagnards, The Crest (&quot;la Crête de la Montagne&quot;), managed to obtain the passage of decrees favorable to the rebels. But at 11:30 p.m. two armed columns entered the chamber and cleared out the rioters. The next day insurgents repeated the same mistakes and after receiving promises from the deputies to take speedy measures against the famine, returned to the sections.

On 3 Prairial the government assembled loyal troops, chasseurs and dragoons, national guardsmen, selected from those &quot;who had fortune to preserve&quot;—20,000 men in all. Faubourg Saint-Antoine was surrounded and on 4 Prairial surrendered and was disarmed. Uncertainty about how to react, hesitancy in action, and lack of revolutionary leadership had doomed the popular movement to throw away its last chance in battle.

4 Prairial Year III is one of the crucial dates of the revolutionary period. The people had ceased to be a political force, participants in history. They were now no more than victims or spectators.

=== Constitution of the Year III ===

The victors now could set up a new constitution, the task the National Convention was originally elected for. The Commission of Eleven (the most notable members of which were Pierre Claude François Daunou, Jean-Denis Lanjuinais, François Antoine de Boissy d&#x27;Anglas, Antoine Claire Thibaudeau and Louis Marie de La Révellière-Lépeaux) drafted a text which would reflect the new balance of power. It was presented on 5 Messidor (23 June) and passed on 22 August 1795 (5 Fructidor of the Year III).

The new constitution went back to the constitution of 1791 as to the dominant ideology of the country. Equality was certainly confirmed, but within the limits of civil equality. Numerous democratic rights of the constitution of 1793—the right to work, to relief, to education—were omitted. The Convention wanted to define rights and simultaneously reject both the privilege of the old order and social leveling.

The constitution went back to the distinction between active and passive citizens. Only citizens over twenty-five years old, disposing of an income of two hundred days of work, were eligible to be electors. This electoral body, which held the real power, included 30,000 people, half as many as in 1791. Later, the age limit was reduced to twenty-one. Guided by recent experience, institutions were set up to protect the Republic from two dangers: the omnipotence of an assembly and dictatorship.

Bicameral legislature as a precaution against sudden political fluctuations was proposed: the Council of Five Hundred with rights to propose laws and Council of Ancients, 250 deputies, with powers to accept or reject proposed laws. Executive power was to be shared between five Directors chosen by the Ancients from the list drawn by Five Hundred. One of the Directors would be renewed each year with re-election after five years. As one of the practical precautions, no military were allowed within 60 miles of the sitting assembly and it could relocate in case of danger. The Directory still retained great power, including emergency powers to curb freedom of the press and freedom of association.

The Constitution generally was accepted favorably, even by those on the right, who were hopeful for the upcoming elections and even more happy to get rid of the legislative body so hated by them.

But how to make sure that the new elected body would not overturn the constitution as it was before with Legislative Assembly? Thermidorians attempted this on 5 Fructidor (22 August) by voting for a decree on &quot;formation of a new legislative body&quot;. Article II stipulated: &quot;All members presently active in the Convention are re-eligible. Election assemblies may not take fewer than two-thirds of them to form the legislative body&quot;. This was known as the Law of the Two-Thirds.

=== Vendémiaire ===
On 23 September the results were announced: the constitution was accepted by 1,057,390 votes, with 49,978 against. The Two-Thirds decrees obtained only 205,498 votes in favor and 108,754 against.

But the Convention had not taken into account those Paris sections who were against Two-Thirds decrees and failed to provide precise vote figures: 47 Parisian sections had rejected the decrees. Eighteen of the Paris sections contested the result. The &quot;Lepeletier&quot; section issued a call to insurrection. By 11 Vendémiaire seven sections were in state of revolt, sections which were the base of the Convention since 9 Thermidor and now won by the far right if not royalists. The Convention declared itself permanent. The &quot;conventionnels&quot; knew the score. They knew the art of insurrection by heart and to bring down &quot;muscadins&quot; was easier than the &quot;sans-culottes&quot;. Five members including Paul François Jean Nicolas, vicomte de Barras were appointed to deal with the crisis. A decree of 12 Vendémiaire (4 October) repealed the former disarmament of the former terrorists and an appeal to &quot;sans-culottes&quot; was issued.

During the nights of Vendémiaire 12–13 (October 4–5), General Jacques-François Menou was tasked with putting down the royalist rebels and keep them from attacking the Convention. He recruited other generals, such as Napoleon Bonaparte, to help aid in quelling the insurrection. The rebels outnumbered the Army by the thousands, but because of their preparations the night before, Bonaparte and the armies were able to line the road into Paris with cannons from Sablons Camp. Without a way into Paris, the rebels surrendered to the Convention on Vendémiaire 13. Barras and the Convention gave the armies permission to kill. Within 45 minutes over 300 royalist rebels were dead in front of the Church of Saint Roch. The rest had scattered and fled.

Moderate repression ensued and the White Terror in the south was stopped. On 4 Brumaire Year IV, just before breaking up, the Convention voted a general amnesty for &quot;deeds exclusively connected with the Revolution&quot;.

== Legacy ==

Anchel (1911) concludes, &quot;The work of the Convention was immense in all branches of public affairs. To appreciate it without prejudice, one should recall that this assembly saved France from a civil war and invasion, that it founded the system of public education (&quot;Museum&quot;, , , , ), created institutions of capital importance, like that of the , and definitely established the social and political gains of the Revolution.&quot; By a decree of 4 February 1794 (16 Pluviôse) it also ratified and expanded to the whole French colonial empire the 1793 abolition of slavery on Saint-Domingue by civil commissioners Sonthonax and Polverel, though this did not affect Martinique or Guadeloupe and was abolished by the law of 20 May 1802.

A number of social welfare policies and programs were introduced under the National Convention. Under a public assistance law of 19 March 1793, various principles were established such as state aid to be distributed according to population in each department, while work was to be provided to the able-bodied and home relief &quot;wherever possible for other varieties of the needy,&quot; while almsgiving was prohibited. A later public assistance law dated 28 June 1793 provided for state aid to be given through district ‘agencies’ to the aged, children and, for the first time in the history of France, unmarried mothers. In addition, abandoned children were to be received in hospitals until they turned 12, when they were to be apprenticed. A law of 15 October 1793, however, provided for the prohibition of begging and almsgiving and that &quot;departmental maisons de repression are to be established, to set beggars to work.&quot; A law on pensions for soldier’s dependents was introduced on 9 February 1794, along with a &quot;Generous and humane&quot; law on pensions for war widows on 4 June 1794. In addition, a law of 11 May 1794 established the Grand Livre de Bienfaisance Nationale, &quot;a register of state pensions benefiting the needy in rural areas.&quot;

A decree of June 1793, as noted by one study, &quot;proposed to provide the services of physicians, nurses, midwives, and apothecaries to the sick poor.&quot; A variety of local and concrete welfare projects were pursued by the Jacobins, including a program that provided for free healthcare for armaments workers, along with pay for sick leave and disability and death benefits. Other Jacobin welfare projects included the founding of primary schools in some districts, an &quot;egalitarian food policy,&quot; and the division and distribution of the land of the emigres. According to one study however, the actual impact of such policies and laws were much more limited, arguing that &quot;Decree after decree proclaimed the eradication of mendacity and the end of chronic deprivation, and ever larger appropriations were ear-marked with seemingly reckless abandon for poor relief…all to no lasting effect.&quot;

<text>A civil marriage is a marriage performed, recorded, and recognized by a government official. Such a marriage may be performed by a religious body and recognized by the state, or it may be entirely secular.

==History==
Countries maintaining a population registry of its residents keep track of marital status, and all United Nations (UN) member states except Iran, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, and Tonga have signed or ratified either the United Nations Convention on Consent to Marriage, Minimum Age for Marriage, and Registration of Marriages (1962) or the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (1979) which carry a responsibility to register marriages. Most countries define the conditions of civil marriage separately from religious requirements. Certain states, such as Israel, allow couples to register only on the condition that they have first been married in a religious ceremony recognized by the state, or were married in a different country. 

===In England===
In medieval Europe, marriage was governed by canon law, which recognized only those marriages where the parties stated they took one another as husband and wife as valid, regardless of the presence or absence of witnesses. It was not necessary, however, to be married by any official or cleric. This institution was canceled in England with the enactment of the Marriage Act 1753, which required that, in order to be valid and registered, all marriages were to be performed in an official ceremony in a religious setting recognized by the state, i.e. Church of England, the Quakers, or in a Jewish ceremony. Any other form of marriage was abolished. Children born into unions that were not valid under the act would not automatically inherit the property or titles of their parents. For historical reasons, the act did not apply in Scotland. Consequently, until 1940, it continued to be enough in Scotland for a man and a woman to pledge their commitment to each other in front of witnesses to legalize their marriage. This led to an industry of &quot;fast marriages&quot; in Scottish towns on the border with England; the town of Gretna Green was particularly well known for this. The Marriage Act 1836 removed the requirement that the ceremony takes place in a religious forum, and registrars have given the authority to register marriages not conducted by a religious official.

===In other European countries===
Many European countries had institutions similar to common-law marriage. However, the Catholic Church forbade clandestine marriage at the Fourth Lateran Council (1215), which required all marriages to be announced in a church by a priest. In 1566, the edict of the Council of Trent was proclaimed denying Catholics any form of marriage not executed in a religious ceremony before a priest and two witnesses.

The Protestant pastor and theologian of Geneva, John Calvin, decreed that in order for a couple to be considered married they must be registered by the state in addition to a church ceremony.

In 1792, with the French Revolution, religious marriage ceremonies in France were made secondary to civil marriage. Religious ceremonies could still be performed, but only for couples who had already been married in a civil ceremony. Napoleon later spread this custom throughout most of Europe. In present-day France, only civil marriage has legal validity. A religious ceremony may be performed after or before the civil union, but it has no legal effect.

In Germany, the Napoleonic code was valid only in territories conquered by Napoleon. With the fall of his empire, civil marriage in Germany began to die out. However, certain sovereign German states introduced civil marriages, which were either obligatory (like the French model) or optional, with either a religious or civil ceremony being accepted. Already before 1848, the Grand-Duchy of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach enacted optional civil marriages, followed by the German republics of the Free City of Frankfurt upon Main (1850, obligatory), Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg (1851, optional) and Free and Hanseatic City of Lübeck (1852, optional). German Grand-Duchies such as Oldenburg (1852/55, optional), Baden (1860), and Hesse (1860) as well as the Kingdom of Württemberg (1863) followed suit. Civil marriages enabled interfaith marriages as well as marriages between spouses of different Christian denominations. After the unification of Germany in 1871, the Reichstag adopted a bill initiated by Chancellor Otto von Bismarck as the &quot;Civil Marriage Law&quot; in 1875 (see: Kulturkampf); since then, only civil marriages have been recognized in Germany. Religious ceremonies may still be performed at the couple&#x27;s discretion. Until December 31, 2008, religious marriages could not be performed until the couple had first married in a civil ceremony.

==In the modern world==

===England and Wales===

Today marriages in England or Wales must be held in authorized premises, which may include register offices, premises such as stately homes, castles, and hotels that have been approved by the local authority, churches or chapels of the Church of England or Church in Wales, and other churches and religious premises that have been registered by the registrar general for marriage.

Civil marriages require a certificate and at times a license, that testify that the couple is fit for marriage. A short time after they are approved in the superintendent registrar&#x27;s office, a short non-religious ceremony takes place which the registrar, the couple, and two witnesses must attend; guests may also be present. Reference must not be made to God or any deity, or to a particular religion or denomination: this is strictly enforced, and readings and music in the ceremony must be agreed upon in advance.

===United States===
Marriage in the United States is largely regulated by state laws, though the Supreme Court has the authority to strike down unconstitutional laws (see &quot;Loving v. Virginia&quot; and &quot;Obergefell v. Hodges&quot;).

All states and the District of Columbia, as well as U.S. territories, require a marriage license issued by local civil authorities. As a rule, ministers of religion (e.g., rabbis or pastors) are authorized in law to perform marriages, while such state and local officials as mayors, judges, deputy marriage commissioners, and justices of the peace are empowered to conduct civil wedding ceremonies, which may take place in public offices. Owing to its Quaker heritage, many counties in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania allow self-uniting marriages for which no official minister is required. The type of ceremony (religious or civil) has no bearing on the legal validity of the marriage, and there is no requirement to precede a religious rite with a civil ceremony. Marriages performed outside of the United States are legally binding if officially recognized by the government of the country in which they are performed.

===Countries with mandatory civil marriage===
In most European and Latin American countries there is a civil ceremony requirement. Following the civil marriage ceremony, couples are free to marry in a religious ceremony. Such ceremonies, however, only serve to provide religious recognition of the marriage already recognized by the state. In countries such as Belgium and the Netherlands, most couples marry without any religious ceremony at all. Full formal weddings, complete with wedding gowns and the presence of family and friends, are usually conducted in special ceremonial rooms in the town hall.

===Countries with no civil marriage===
There is no civil marriage in many Middle Eastern countries, including Jordan, Palestine, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Iran, Lebanon, and Israel, as well as Libya and Indonesia; all marriages are conducted by religious authorities and registered by civil authorities only after having been registered by authorities of officially approved religions or having been registered abroad. Israel and Lebanon officially recognize Islam, Christianity, Druze, and Judaism as different religious sects within the legal system; marriage is only possible within the same religion but allowed between different denominations of that religion. In Lebanon, depending on gender and religion, interfaith marriages are permissible. A Muslim man may marry a Christian or Jewish woman, but a Muslim woman may not marry outside her faith. Druze themselves only permit intrafaith marriages. In Lebanon, gender and religion intersect in legal affairs. Lebanon does recognise civil marriages performed abroad, but only if the parties to the marriage physically travel outside of Lebanon, which is unfeasible if they are denied a passport by the General Directorate of General Security. By contact, Israeli law recognizes any marriage conducted abroad, even those officiated remotely by video conference in which the parties do not physically leave Israel. Malaysia and the United Arab Emirates allow civil marriage for non-Muslims only, while in Kuwait, Bahrain and Afghanistan it is allowed for foreign citizens only.

<doc id="201975" wikidata="Q907752" url="?curid=201975" title="LGM-118 Peacekeeper">
<text>The LGM-118 Peacekeeper, originally known as the MX for &quot;Missile, Experimental&quot;, was a MIRV-capable intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) produced and deployed by the United States from 1986 to 2005. The missile could carry up to eleven Mark 21 reentry vehicles (although treaties limited its actual payload to ten), each armed with a 300-kiloton W87 warhead. Initial plans called for building and deploying 100 MX ICBMs, but budgetary concerns limited the final procurement; only 50 entered service. Disarmament treaties signed after the Peacekeeper&#x27;s development led to its withdrawal from service in 2005.

Studies on the underlying concept started in the 1960s. The idea was to allow the US to absorb a sneak attack by the USSR with enough warheads surviving to attack the remaining Soviet missile silos. To do so, the missiles had to be highly accurate, be based in such a way that enough would survive a nuclear attack, carry a large number of warheads so the survivors would still inflict massive damage, and be able to rapidly re-target so they could be aimed at only those missiles the Soviets had not yet fired. Over its development through the 1970s, MX emerged as a highly accurate, rapid-firing, and quickly retargeted system. Ultimately, the only problem that was never completely solved was the issue of basing.

Initial development began in 1971, with full-scale development starting in 1974. President Jimmy Carter ordered initial production in 1979 but was overturned by Congress. After considerable debate about the system, in October 1982, President Ronald Reagan announced that 50 of the newly named Peacekeepers would be put into service in existing LGM-30 Minuteman silos, a temporary measure until final basing was decided. The first flight test took place in 1983, which included the successful launch of six inert re-entry vehicles, each hitting pre-planned targets. It was the first US ICBM to use a cold launch system.

Peacekeeper reached initial operational capability in 1986. At this time, the United States and the Soviet Union were negotiating the START II treaty, under which ICBMs were allowed to carry only a single warhead each. Because the Minuteman could carry a single warhead for far less money, the United States agreed to remove the Peacekeeper from their nuclear force in this treaty. Despite the US withdrawal from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and the subsequent Russian withdrawal from the START II on 14 June 2002, the last Peacekeeper missile was deactivated on 19 September 2005. Their advanced W87 warheads were moved to the Minuteman III.

The private launch firm Orbital Sciences Corporation has developed the Minotaur IV, a four-stage civilian expendable launch system using old Peacekeeper components. , seven Minotaur IV flights have been made.

==Development and deployment==
===Minuteman===
Deployment of the Minuteman ICBM began in 1962, during the Cold War, and proceeded rapidly. Limited accuracy with a circular error probable (CEP) of about and a small warhead of less than 1 megaton meant the system was unable to attack hardened targets like missile silos. This limited these early models to attacks on strategic targets like cities and ports, and the system had little or no capability as a counterforce weapon. The Air Force relied on its crewed bombers as the primary weapon for attacking hardened targets and saw the ICBM as a survivable deterrent that would guard against an attack on its bomber fleet.

Soviet missiles were known to have very low accuracy, far too low to directly attack US missile silos. They did have the combination of accuracy and power to attack the US bomber bases. Although it would be very difficult to arrange, there was the possibility that a combination of missile attacks on US bomber bases combined with bomber attacks on the missile bases would leave the US at a disadvantage. The survivability of the missile fleet became increasingly important, especially after the Kennedy administration took power, and the new Secretary of Defense, Robert McNamara, was given the task of making the US military the most powerful in the world while at the same time reducing its expenditures. He solved this problem by greatly reducing reliance on bombers, and by 1964, there were more US ICBMs than bombers on nuclear alert.

By the mid-1960s, the missile had become the main US strategic weapon. This led to concerns about various warfighting scenarios, especially as the Soviets improved their missiles. In the event of a Soviet missile launch, the US faced the difficult decision of whether to fire their missiles immediately or wait to determine the targets of the Soviet missiles. Firing early might mean striking civilian targets (countervalue) when the Soviets had only targeted military installations, something US politicians considered to be a serious problem (part of the flexible response doctrine). Even if the Soviets attacked only the bombers, the US would be left with no counterforce approach, as both the Navy and Air Force missiles could only attack large targets.

As the US Navy was quick to point out, their Polaris fleet&#x27;s stealth and mobility would maintain a countervalue force under any possible scenario. This threatened the Air Force&#x27;s supremacy in the nuclear warfighting arena. Even in the case of a counterforce attack, their bombers would take hours to complete their missions, during which the Soviets could launch their remaining missiles. The Air Force could not let this stand, and following the advice of RAND Corporation, in 1962 they decided the solution was to make the Minuteman capable of counterforce missions as well. The changes to Minuteman II were two-fold. One was to introduce the NS-17 inertial navigation system, which improved the CEP to and allowed the missiles to attack Soviet silos directly. The other was to allow the missiles to quickly switch between a selection of eight targets, allowing them to be fired at only those Soviet silos that had not already launched.

===Golden Arrow===
Similar improvements to Soviet missiles, real or imagined, led to US officials proposing a worrying scenario; a Soviet first strike with a limited number of warheads aimed at the Minuteman silos or control bunkers could cripple the US ICBM fleet. At the time, the Soviets were only capable of mounting a limited attack. With the limited accuracy of Soviet missiles, only an attack with a small number of missiles carrying very large warheads (multi-megaton range) was feasible. They had just enough of these to make a damaging, but not decisive, attack on the US ICBM fleet. This scenario was of deep concern to the Air Force as it became ever more dependent on Minuteman for most strategic missions.

The Air Force had depended on engineering support from TRW during the early days of the development of their ICBM force. In 1960 a number of TRW and other engineers involved in the ICBM program formed The Aerospace Corporation, initially working on the Mercury spacecraft, X-20 Dynasoar and various ICBM projects. In 1964, the Air Force contracted them to consider a wide variety of survivable ICBM approaches, under the name &quot;Golden Arrow&quot;.

The project considered road, rail, submarine and air-launched weapons. One of these suggested an air-launched ballistic missile. The proposal called for an enormous (for the day) turboprop-powered aircraft with two-day endurance carrying up to eight missiles that would be dropped out the back, parachuted to the vertical, and then launched. As part of the same study, Aerospace also considered a missile and wheeled launcher combination that was small enough that they could be carried in existing C-141 Starlifter aircraft. During periods of heightened tensions, they would be flown to practically any airport and set up. The Soviets would have to target thousands of airports, runways and even dirt strips and long stretches of highway to attack the fleet.

Finally, they also considered conventional missiles in &quot;super hard&quot; silos, buried under the southern side of mountains. As the enemy warheads would approach at a fairly shallow angle from the north, they would strike the north side of the mountains before they could hit the silos themselves. Properly positioned, this would keep the explosions at least away from the silos; it was believed that silos able to withstand multi-megaton explosions at one mile could be built, although this was an area of some uncertainty. This system had the advantage that the basing would be immune to changes in the accuracy or speed of the attack, only enormous increases in yield could overcome this physical barrier.

They proposed 100 missiles in three bases of 30 missiles each. They expected that at least one base would be able to survive even an all-out attack. However, if such a force of approximately 30 missiles was going to be a reasonable deterrent, each missile would need to carry 20 or more warheads. To launch them, the study introduced the &quot;ICBM-X&quot;, a massive new diameter design, well over twice the diameter of the existing LGM-30 Minuteman, and larger even than the Titan II &quot;heavy&quot; design at .

Any of the &quot;Golden Arrow&quot; concepts would be extremely expensive, and in the era of Robert McNamara&#x27;s US Department of Defense, cost was as important as any other consideration. As Alain Enthoven put it, &quot;Our gross national product, though large, is limited. If we attempted to develop and procure a dozen or more distinct different nuclear delivery systems… we doubtless would end up squandering our resources and not doing a good job on any of them.&quot; Golden Arrow, along with many similar proposals from other firms, proceeded no further, in favor of the Minuteman II.

===WS-120A===
In 1966 and 67, the Department of Defense ran the STRAT-X study to consider many of these issues. As part of this program, they proposed a smaller version of ICBM-X with 10 to 20 warheads. Known initially as WS-120A and later as BGM-75 AICBM, the missile was small enough to fit in existing large silos, like those for the Titan II, but was otherwise similar in concept to the ICBM-X, with a circular error probable (CEP) of about , and especially the ability to be quickly re-programmed to attack any targets needed. In comparison, the Minuteman II had a selection of eight targets, any one of which could be quickly selected for attack, but otherwise selecting a target outside this pre-computed list was not something that could be done &quot;on the fly&quot;. WS-120A&#x27;s preferred basing mode was a super-hardened shelter, but dispersed mobile options were also considered.

However, like Golden Arrow before it, WS-120A&#x27;s advantages found themselves being diluted by the new Minuteman III. The Minuteman III used the new NS-20 inertial navigation system (INS) with a CEP of , three warheads and an expanded collection of radar countermeasures that would ensure the warheads would survive an anti-ballistic missile attack. Although the system did not include the ability to be rapidly retargeted, this capability was under development and started deployment in 1972, before the planned 1975 introduction date of WS-120A. When it was fully deployed in 1978, the entire ICBM fleet could be entirely reprogrammed in 10 hours.

===INS advances===
Since the late 1950s, engineers at the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory had been working on a new type of inertial platform that replaced the mechanical gimbals with a sphere floating in a thin layer of fluorocarbon fluid. The so-called &quot;flimbal&quot; (apparently for &quot;FLoated Measurement BAL&quot;) would offer unprecedented accuracy and would be free from &quot;gimbal lock&quot;, a problem that caused conventional platforms to &quot;tumble&quot; and lose their accuracy. Like the ICBM-X, there was little development as there appeared to be no need for a platform with the sort of accuracy the flimbal provided, and the expense of developing the system would be extremely high.

In spite of a lack of official interest, during the late 1960s Kenneth Fertig managed to arrange some funding through the Air Force for the &quot;SABRE&quot; INS project, short for &quot;Self-Aligning Boost and RE-entry&quot;. The name referred to the concept that the system would be so accurate and free from the effects of mechanical shocks and jarring that it would not require any other form of &quot;fixing&quot; in flight. This was in contrast to the stellar-inertial systems under development by the Navy and others. It would retain its accuracy even through the rough conditions during re-entry, allowing the creation of maneuvering reentry vehicles.

===Counterforce considerations===
During the late 1970s, the Soviet Union fielded a large number of increasingly accurate MIRVed Heavy ICBMs like the SS-18. These missiles carried as many as 10 warheads along with up to 40 penetration aids, meaning that a small number of launches could present a threat to the Air Force&#x27;s ICBM fleet while retaining a large force in reserve. If the Soviet Union launched a first strike and the US did not respond immediately, the majority of their missiles and strategic bombers might be caught on the ground. A credible deterrent force would remain, but such a force might not have enough warheads left to attack &quot;both&quot; the remaining Soviet fleet and cities and other military targets.

In such a situation, the US would be left with two uncomfortable options. If they chose to respond in kind and attack the remaining Soviet missile fleet, there would be little to respond with if the Soviets immediately launched against US cities. The other option would require the US to be the first country to launch an attack on civilian targets, an attack that was both morally reprehensible as well as against stated policy. This worrying scenario led to the effort to develop a new ICBM with the accuracy needed to be an excellent counterforce weapon, the survivability needed to absorb a Soviet first strike, and the MIRV capabilities needed to ensure even a small number of survivors would be able to attack the remaining Soviet missile fleet. The Minuteman III simply did not have this combination of features.

Whether or not this problem actually existed is open to debate. The Minuteman had a relatively fast launch time, and early warning satellites meant that commanders would have almost instant warning of a Soviet launch, with ample time to plan a response. However, it would not be until much later in the sequence of events that land-based radars would be able to track the incoming individual warheads and determine the targets. In the case of a limited counterforce attack, it would be desirable to wait until the individual targeted silos were determined, determine which Soviet missiles had not been launched, and then launch only the targeted missiles against their unlaunched Soviet counterparts. This would require extremely tight timing.

The development of practical SLBM systems upset the nuclear equation dramatically. These weapons were essentially invulnerable when at sea, and offered a credible countervalue force, primarily against civilian targets as early models like the UGM-27 Polaris and UGM-73 Poseidon did not have the accuracy to attack Soviet silos and thus offered little counterforce capability. In some ways this helped the Air Force, as it meant they could concentrate on the counterforce scenarios, knowing that a countervalue attack would always be available from the Navy. However, improvements in SLBM accuracy might allow them to handle counterforce as well, and render the entire land-based ICBM fleet superfluous. The Air Force was not interested in handing the strategic role to the Navy. A survivable ICBM would address this issue.

===MX===
In 1971, the Air Force started a requirements development process combining the ICBM-X and SABRE concepts into a single platform, &quot;Missile, Experimental&quot;, or MX. The new missile would have enough accuracy and warhead payload that even a few survivors would be able to destroy enormous numbers of any remaining Soviet force. The specifications for MX were fixed in February 1972, the program office at the Space and Missile Systems Organization (SAMSO) formed on 4 April, and the advanced development program started in late 1973.

To address the survivability issue, a huge series of concepts and studies followed. In 1973, Strategic Air Command rejected mobile basing due to high costs and slow reaction times due to the need to set up the launcher. On 24 October 1974 the airmobile concept was tested by SAMSO by dropping a Minuteman I from a C-5A cargo aircraft. In November, the Secretary of Defense pushed the initial operational date back from 1983 to 1985 and opened a study on the possibility of developing a single missile for both ICBM and SLBM use. A six-month study in 1977 proposed a &quot;Low-Altitude Defense&quot; (LoAD) system using small anti-ballistic missiles at missile fields, similar to the Sprint system, to increase survivability. This was developed into the abortive Sentry program.&quot;

For MX, the Draper Laboratory developed SABRE into the &quot;Advanced Inertial Reference Sphere&quot; (AIRS). AIRS would have a drift rate of only 1.5 x 10−5 degrees per hour, allowing it to be periodically referenced to an external point, like the silo wall, and then left for extended periods of time. Over the period of the flight the drift would be so low that any inaccuracies in the platform would account for a maximum of 1% of the warhead&#x27;s final accuracy–the rest would be due to issues like the timing of the firing of the rocket engines, minor differences in warhead construction, and unavoidable randomness in the atmosphere. The Air Force also contracted with Autonetics for a backup design using mechanical gimbals, the &quot;Advanced Stable Platform&quot; (ASP). In May 1975 the first hand-built AIRS was transferred from Draper&#x27;s laboratory to Northrop for further development.

===Basing options===
In July 1976, Congress refused to fund MX using a silo-based system on grounds of vulnerability, and the project was halted. Several new proposals were made for alternate basing arrangements, including mobile basing in railway cars that would be sent out into the nation&#x27;s rail network during times of heightened threat levels, and more complex systems of deeply buried silos under mesas that would include systems to quickly dig themselves out after an attack.

Eventually, the program was reinstated on 12 June 1979 by President Carter. On 7 September 1979 he announced that 200 MX missiles would be deployed throughout eastern Nevada and western Utah. The deployment would occur in a system of multiple protective shelters linked by underground or aboveground roads, the so-called &quot;Racetrack&quot; proposal. Local opposition in Nevada was intense, and the concept gained a powerful enemy in the form of Senator Paul Laxalt. Initially support was high in Utah, especially in the Beaver County area; although opposition increased dramatically following a statement of disapproval by the leaders of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

When Ronald Reagan took office, Laxalt&#x27;s close ties with Reagan proved useful. Reagan canceled the new shelter system in 1981, calling it &quot;a Rube Goldberg scheme&quot;. On 2 October 1981 he proposed deploying an initial force of missiles in the approximately 60 existing Titan II silos, removing those now outdated missiles from service. The silos would be modified for much greater strength, and Minuteman III silos similarly adapted over time to bring the force to a total of 100 missiles. Additionally, he suggested funding development of three additional concepts, airborne drops from cargo aircraft, an &quot;active defense&quot; using short-range anti-ballistic missile, or basing new silos deep underground or on the south side of mesas (&quot;reverse-inclination basing&quot;). The latter two quickly proved unacceptable for various reasons, while testing of the air-drop concept was pursued.

On 22 November 1982, Reagan announced that the system would be deployed in new silos in what was then known as &quot;Closely Spaced Basing&quot;, but later better known as &quot;dense pack&quot;. During this speech, he made the first mention of the name Peacekeeper. The dense pack idea involved building super-hardened silos that would withstand more than of overpressure, exceeding both the rated of existing silos and the proposed upgrade to .

This extra hardness can be offset by minor increases in warhead accuracy. The key to dense pack concept was to space the silos close together, about . This was far enough apart that a single warhead could not destroy more than one silo; no conceivable warhead was powerful enough to destroy the silos from the point between them, from either silo. To attack the dense pack, separate warheads would have to be aimed at each silo. When one of the attacking warheads exploded, the blast wave and dirt thrown into the air would destroy any nearby warheads.

This &quot;fratricide theory&quot; was highly criticized due to the expected relative ease with which the Soviets could modify their warheads and circumvent this design. All that was required was that several warheads arrive and be detonated within a few milliseconds of each other, so the blast waves did not reach each other before completing destruction of the silo. Such timing could be easily achieved by launching all of the warheads from a single missile. Congress again rejected the system.

===Scowcroft Commission===
Reagan responded to this setback by appointing Lieutenant General Brent Scowcroft to lead a Commission on Strategic Forces, better known as the Scowcroft Commission.

In overall terms, the most important conclusion of the Scowcroft Commission was that the &quot;window of vulnerability&quot; in regard to the Soviet capability to attack US ICBMs never existed in the first place. The report examined a wide array of potential attack scenarios, and demonstrated that none allowed the Soviets to significantly blunt a US response, nor seriously limit its options in the flexible response policy.

Delivered 6 April 1983, the report suggested deploying 100 MX in existing Minuteman silos as a &quot;demonstration of national will&quot;, but in other ways basically suggested eliminating both MX and Minuteman and replacing them with a small single-warhead mobile ICBM. On 10 August, the Secretary of Defense ordered 100 Peacekeepers be deployed at Warren AFB in Wyoming and began development of what became the MGM-134 Midgetman.

===SLBMs come of age===
By this time both the US and USSR were beginning to field third-generation SLBMs with greatly improved accuracy. These now arguably had all of the capability of the land-based ICBMs, and were equally able to carry out the counterforce mission. Additionally, the submarines could maneuver much closer to their targets, greatly reducing the warning time, potentially to the point that the command structure would not have time to launch their ICBMs and bombers before the warheads were reaching them.

The development of the Trident II, which was described as &quot;effective against most of the hardened military targets, including missile silos and launch control centers&quot;, reopened the debate about MX. If Trident was capable of carrying out the mission originally intended for MX, and do so from a completely protected and mobile platform, what capabilities did MX add?

A compromise was eventually developed in mid-1983. Under this scheme, 100 missiles would be deployed in existing Minuteman silos to &quot;show national will&quot;. The plan also called for the removal of the old and accident-prone liquid fueled Titan II from use. However, this did not address the problem the MX was originally intended to solve, providing high survivability. This would later be addressed through the re-introduction of the &quot;rail garrison&quot; concept, with twenty-five trains each carrying two missiles. This system was expected to be operational in 1992. The supposed counterforce gap, then being widely talked about on television, also resulted in the schedule for silo deployment being moved up, dropping the production time from 44 months to 29.

Additionally, the plan also called for the development of an entirely new missile, which would emerge as the MGM-134 Midgetman. The Midgetman deliberately carried only one warhead and was highly mobile. Countering a single Midgetman would require the Soviets to blanket an area around its last known position with warheads. Even if this was successful, they would destroy only a single warhead. Faced with this choice, it was expected the Soviets would instead expend their warheads on easier targets.

====Peacekeeper Rail Garrison====

The Peacekeeper Rail Garrison is a mobile missile system that was developed by the United States Air Force during the 1980s as part of a plan to place fifty MGM-118A Peacekeeper intercontinental ballistic missiles on the rail network of the United States. The railcars were intended, in case of increased threat of nuclear war, to be deployed onto the nation&#x27;s rail network to avoid being destroyed by a first strike counterforce attack by the Soviet Union. However the plan was cancelled as part of defense cutbacks following the end of the Cold War, and the Peacekeeper missiles were installed in silo launchers as LGM-118s instead.

===Deployment===
The new ICBM was originally planned to be called &quot;Peacemaker&quot;, but at the last minute was officially designated the LGM-118A Peacekeeper. It was first test fired on 17 June 1983, by the Air Force Systems Command Ballistic Missile Office (Norton AFB, CA), 6595th Missile Test Group (Vandenberg AFB, CA Strategic Air Command), and Martin Marietta, from Vandenberg AFB, California Test Pad-01, traveling to strike successfully in the Kwajalein Test Range in the Pacific. The first eight test flights were launched from an above ground canister on TP-01, with the remaining test and operational Strategic Air Command flights from silos (LF-02, −05, &amp; -08) all located on North Vandenberg AFB. A total of 50 flight tests were accomplished.

The operational missile was first manufactured in February 1984 and was deployed in December 1986 to the Strategic Air Command, 90th Strategic Missile Wing at Francis E. Warren Air Force Base in Cheyenne, Wyoming in re-fitted Minuteman silos. However, the AIRS was not yet ready and the missiles were deployed with non-operational guidance units. AIRS had 19,000 parts and some of these required as many as 11,000 testing steps. Bogged down in paperwork due to government procurement policies, managers started bypassing official channels and buying replacement parts wherever they could be found, including claims that some of the parts were sourced at Radio Shack. In other cases, managers had created false shell companies to order needed test equipment.

When these allegations were released by &quot;60 Minutes&quot; and the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, the fallout was immediate. Northrop was slapped with a $130 million fine for late delivery, and when they reacted against employees they were countersued in whistleblower suits. The Air Force also admitted that 11 of the 29 missiles deployed were not operational. A Congressional report stated that &quot;Northrop was behind schedule before it even started&quot; and noted that the Air Force knew as early as 1985 that there were &quot;serious system deficiencies as well as a lack of effective progress&quot;. They complained that the Air Force should have come clean and simply pushed back the deployment date, but instead, in order to foster the illusion of progress, the missiles were deployed in a non-operational state.

The first prototype AIRS, by then known more generically as the Inertial Measurement Unit, or IMU, was delivered in May 1986, 203 days late. It was not until July 1987 that the first production AIRS were ready to ship, and the complete supply for the first 50 missiles was not complete until December 1988. Given these delays, and increased performance of the UGM-133 Trident II, Congress had already cancelled the 100-missile option in July 1985. In that decision, Congress limited the deployment of Peacekeeper ICBMs to 50 missiles until a more &quot;survivable&quot; basing plan could be developed.

Development of the rail garrison system was carried out in parallel. However, budgetary constraints and the dissolution of the Soviet Union led to its being scrapped. The National Museum of the United States Air Force has a rail garrison box car on display, and developmental remnants of the program can still be found at Vandenberg Air Force Base.

The project had already cost around $20 billion up to 1998 and produced 114 missiles, at $400 million for each operational missile. The &quot;flyaway&quot; cost of each warhead was estimated at 20 to 70 million dollars.

==Retirement and deactivation==
The missiles were gradually retired, with 17 withdrawn during 2003, leaving 29 missiles on alert at the beginning of 2004, and only 10 by the beginning of 2005. The last Peacekeeper was removed from alert on 19 September 2005 during the final deactivation ceremony when the 400th Missile Squadron was inactivated as well. During the ceremony an Under Secretary of the Air Force credited the Peacekeeper with helping to end the Cold War.

The Peacekeeper rockets were converted to the satellite launcher role by Orbital Sciences, as the Minotaur IV (OSP-2), while the warheads were redeployed on the existing Minuteman III missiles.

==Operator==
* The United States Air Force was the only operator of the Peacekeeper.
:: 400th Strategic Missile Squadron (later 400th Missile Squadron), Francis E. Warren AFB, Wyoming (1987–2005). Airborne Missileers operating the Common Airborne Launch Control System onboard Airborne Launch Control Center aircraft provided a survivable capability to remotely control and launch the Peacekeeper ICBM in the event the underground Launch Control Centers were unable to do so.
* Orbital Sciences: Will use the Minotaur IV civilian launch platform version.

<doc id="201976" wikidata="Q5153434" url="?curid=201976" title="Common Market (hip-hop group)">
<text>Common Market is an American hip hop duo based in Seattle, Washington, active from 2005 through 2009 and from 2019 to present. Both members, DJ/Producer Sabzi (Saba Mohajerjasbi) and MC RA Scion (Ryan Abeo), had been active hip hop artists in the Pacific Northwest for three years before they combined their talents in 2005 to form Common Market. Together they have released two albums, three EPs, and have gone on several tours.

==Early beginnings==
Sabzi started his career as DJ and producer in another hip hop duo, Blue Scholars, in Seattle, Washington. RA Scion gained musical skill while in Louisville, Kentucky, before moving to Seattle. RA Scion and Sabzi&#x27;s paths crossed through the Northwest hip hop scene, where they bonded over their Baháʼí Faith contacts, and their political and spiritual approach to hip-hop music.

==Musical career==

===2005-2007: &quot;Common Market&quot;, self titled LP and touring===
After collaborating on a pair of tracks on RA Scion&#x27;s 2004 solo project, &quot;Live and Learn&quot;, the duo began working in an attic-based studio for what would eventually become the 14-track self-titled debut, released in October 2005. An advance copy caught the ear of KRS-One, who praised the album and RA Scion for &quot;spitting in the tradition of the conscious hiphop movement.&quot; KRS-One then drove up to perform at Common Market&#x27;s album release party in Seattle, then taking the duo on the road with him on the &quot;Temple of Hiphop&quot; tour.

The album was hailed by fans as a remarkable improvement over any of their previous works. Common Market takes on questions about religion, politics and the state of mainstream hip-hop. At the core of Common Market&#x27;s music is a critical, unapologetic world view that change is not only necessary, it is inevitable, and can only come about through having love for and serving the people.

Shortly after the release of their debut album, Common Market gathered praise as &quot;Seattle Weekly&quot;&#x27;s 2006 Best New Artist and performing slots on grand stages such as the &quot;Sasquatch Festival&quot; and &quot;The Capitol Hill Block Party&quot;. They have shared the stage with KRS-One, Zion I, Ghostface Killah, The Coup, Guru of Gangstarr, and the Blue Scholars. The album&#x27;s regional success, along with the wave of Northwest hip-hop, poised the group for a serious push into the national scene, and the Common Market LP has been mixed and mastered by Seattle music engineer Martin Feveyear and repackaged with new album cover art. Their debut album was also the first official new release of Mass Line, a co-op indie record label run by Common Market, Blue Scholars and Gabriel Teodros. The now-defunct label&#x27;s mission statement included the goal of using hip hop as a means of grassroots community organizing and youth outreach.

===2007-2009: &quot;Tobacco Road&quot;===
In a 2007 interview on Seattle radio station 107.7 The End, the duo stated that their new album would be titled &quot;Tobacco Road&quot; and is scheduled for release &quot;on your mom&#x27;s 50th birthday.&quot; In preparation for the album release, Common Market released the EP &quot;Black Patch War&quot; on May 20, 2008. &quot;Tobacco Road&quot; was released September 9, 2008, followed by a CD release party on September 11, 2008, at Neumo&#x27;s in Seattle. Later that month, the album climbed to #50 on the U.S. Billboard Heatseekers chart. In September 2008, Common Market released a music video for the single &quot;Trouble Is.&quot; The video was shot by director Zia Mohajerjasbi and was filmed at sites around Monroe, Washington. Common Market were winners in the eighth annual Independent Music Award for Rap/Hip-Hop Album in 2009 for Tobacco Road. A second (and final) EP, &quot;The Winter&#x27;s End&quot;, followed in March 2009.

== Hiatus ==
In 2009, RA Scion announced that &quot;The Winter&#x27;s End&quot; would be the final release by the group via bandcamp, with both artists going their separate artistic ways.

== Reunion ==
On July 12, 2019, Common Market played again live at West Seattle Summer Fest after a ten-year hiatus. That week they also released a new EP titled &quot;Triple Crown&quot;. The group has also announced a forthcoming album, titled &quot;Pegasus Parade&quot;, which will be released in 2020.

== Name ==
RA Scion cites the name&#x27;s origin from Common&#x27;s song &quot;Communism&quot; from his 1994 album &quot;Resurrection&quot;.

<text>The BMP-3 is a Soviet and Russian infantry fighting vehicle, successor to the BMP-1 and BMP-2. The abbreviation BMP stands for &quot;Boevaya Mashina Pekhoty&quot; (, literally &quot;infantry combat vehicle&quot;).

== Production history ==

The design of the BMP-3 (&quot;Obyekt&quot; 688M) can be traced back to the &quot;Obyekt&quot; 685 light tank prototype with an 2A48-1 100 mm gun from 1975. The prototype did not enter series production, but the chassis, with a new engine, was used for the next-generation infantry combat vehicle &quot;Obyekt&quot; 688 from A. Blagonravov&#x27;s design bureau. The Ob. 688&#x27;s original weapon configuration consisting of an externally mounted Shipunov 2A42 30 mm autocannon, a 7.62 mm PKT machine gun and twin &quot;9M113 Konkurs&quot; ATGM launcher was rejected; instead, the new 2K23 armament system was selected. The resulting BMP-3 was developed in the early 1980s and entered service with the Soviet Army officially in 1987. It was shown for the first time in public during the 1990 Victory Day parade and was given the NATO code IFV M1990/1.

The BMP-3 is designed and produced by the &quot;Kurganmashzavod&quot; (&quot;Kurgan Machine Building Plant&quot;) some variants however are built by the Rubtsovsk Machine Building Plant (RMZ), for example the BRM-3K.

In May 2015, the Russian Defense Ministry signed a three-year contract to receive &quot;hundreds&quot; of BMP-3 vehicles to maintain its armored vehicle force until its replacement, the Kurganets-25, completes research and development. In the process of the BMP&#x27;s serial production, the vehicle&#x27;s design underwent 1,500 amendments. The contract was fully executed in 2017. 200 more received in 2018-2019 and 168 more in production to be delivered in 2020–2021[outdated information] with additional protection.

In the Army-2017 show, the Russian Defence Ministry signed a contract covering the first deliveries of an unspecified number of BMP-3 infantry fighting vehicles (IFVs) fitted with the Bumerang-BM turret, also known as the B-19 variant. The BMP-3 B-19 took part in the large-scale Russian-Belarusian exercise Zapad in September 2021.

In 2022, Russia started to promote to the international market a BMP-3 with a remotely controlled combat module. The batches of vehicles delivered to the Russian troops since 2023 are equipped with the Sodema main sight and extra protection as well as the ability to install ERA.

Kurganmashzavod reported in May 2023 that during the first quarter of the year it supplied the same number of vehicles it did in the whole of 2019. In July 2023, Russian Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu stated that the supplies and repair of BMP-3 by Kurganmashzavod had surged 2.1 times since early 2022. Kurganmashzavod reported in early September 2023 that the supply of BMP-3 increased by 3 times at comparison with peacetime.

== Design ==

=== Weaponry and optics ===
The BMP-3 is one of the most heavily armed infantry combat vehicles in service. The original version has a turret fitted with a low-velocity 2A70 100 mm rifled gun which can fire conventional shells or 9M117 Bastion Anti Tank Guided Missiles (AT-10 Stabber). It carries 40 100 mm rounds and 8 ATGMs. A 2A72 30 mm dual feed autocannon with 500 (300 HEI and 200 AP-T) rounds and a rate of fire of 350 to 400 rounds per minute and a 7.62 mm PKT machine gun with 2,000 rounds are mounted coaxially in the turret. The main gun elevates from −5° to +60°. There are also two 7.62 mm PKT bow machine guns, again with 2,000 rounds each. The BMP-3 is capable of engaging targets out to 5,000–6,000 metres with its ATGM weapon system 9K116-3 &quot;Basnya&quot;. With conventional ammunition, such as the HE-Frag shell 3OF32, the 2A70 gun has a range of 4,000 metres.

According to the manufacturer&#x27;s website, all weapons can be fired while still, on the move, and afloat with the same effectiveness. The ability to hit targets on the move with missiles was successfully demonstrated during competitive evaluations in the UAE in 1991.
The turret is fitted with the 2K23 system, which consists of an autoloader with 22 rounds (the remaining 18 rounds are stored in the hull), a 1V539 ballistic computer, a crosswind sensor, a 2E52-2 stabilising system, a 1D16-3 laser rangefinder, a 1K13-2 gunner&#x27;s sight/guidance device, a PPB-1 gunner&#x27;s sight and an OU-5-1 IR searchlight. Optional autoloader for ATGM missiles is also available. The commander has a combined optical sight 1PZ-10, a day/night vision device TKN-3MB and an IR searchlight OU-3GA2.

Since 2005, the BMP-3 can be fitted with a new fire control system from the &quot;Peleng&quot; Joint Stock Company from Belarus. This consists of a SOZH-M gunner&#x27;s main sight with an integrated laser rangefinder and missile guidance channel, a Vesna-K targeting system with thermal imaging camera and automatic target tracker AST-B, an armament stabilisation system, a ballistic computer with data input sensors and a PL-1 IR laser projector. Since 2017, the BMP-3 is fitted with a new fire control system from the &quot;Vologda Optical-Mechanical Plant&quot; from Russia. This consists of a Sodema two-plane stabilized gunner&#x27;s main sight with an integrated laser rangefinder and missile guidance channel plus a SOZH-M thermal imaging camera.

Standard equipment includes five firing ports with associated vision blocks, an R-173 transceiver, an R-173P receiver, a GO-27 radiation and chemical agent detector, an FVU filtration system, an automatic fire extinguisher and six 902V &quot;Tucha-2&quot; 81 mm smoke grenade launchers.

BMP-3M is equipped with Bakhcha-U turret, which has similar weapons to the original BMP-3 turret but with a new dual-channel FLIR gunner&#x27;s sight, commander&#x27;s panoramic thermal imaging device, vertical-storage conveyor, new autoloader, and a new sighting system. It also has a stronger armor on the turret, and two-axis stabilisation.

The turret of the BMP-3 has been fitted to the Patria Armoured Modular Vehicle and on the Turkish-UAE RABDAN 8x8 IFV.

In August 2017, a BMP-3M was presented with a new ATGM remote weapon station fitted on the standard turret carrying two 9M120 Ataka (AT-9 Spiral-2) missiles.

In June 2018, the Russian Defense Ministry announced that BMP-3s would be fitted with the AU-220M combat module equipped with a 57 mm cannon. The module can carry 80 rounds and fire 80 rounds per minute including air burst, high-explosive, fragmentation, armor-piercing and guided munitions with a maximum range of , and can even punch through the side armor of main battle tanks.

=== Mobility ===
The vehicle has an unconventional layout. The engine is in the back of the vehicle to the right (unlike most other IFVs, which have the engine located forward in the hull). As a result, the driver is seated forward in the hull (in the center) together with two infantrymen (one on each side of the driver). The vehicle has a double bottom, and the engine is located under the floor of the vehicle (troops enter/leave the vehicle over the engine). The remaining five infantrymen are seated aft of the two-man turret.

Early models were powered by a 450 hp engine UTD-29, but most BMP-3s are now equipped with the 500 hp UTD-29M version. The engine was developed at the Transmash Diesel Engine Plant in Barnaul. The BMP-3 has a range of 600 km, an altitude of operation of up to 3,000 m and it is transportable by train, truck, sea, and air. The BMP-3 engine is a diesel four-stroke, liquid-cooled design. The transmission is a four-speed hydromechanical power unit, with power takeoff to its water jets. The suspension is independent, with a torsion bar and six hydraulic shock absorbers. Steering is by gear differential with hydrostatic drive. The track adjusting mechanism is remotely controlled from the driver&#x27;s station, with tension force indication. The water-jet propulsion unit is single-stage, axial, auger-type.

=== Countermeasures ===
The hull and turret are made of a high-strength aluminum alloy, with the front of the hull being provided with an extra steel plate welded over it plus spaced armor from the trim vane. The turret is also provided with a thick steel spaced armour shield over its frontal arc. Over the frontal arc, the vehicle is protected against 30 mm gun rounds at a range of 200 m. In addition to &quot;hard&quot; protection, the BMP-3&#x27;s self-sealing fuel tank is located in front of the driver, directly behind the front armour plating. It is specially constructed to act as armour, effective against shaped charge warheads as well as any autocannon shells that managed to go through the front armour.

The BMP-3 can create a smoke screen by injecting fuel into the exhaust manifolds. A chemical agent detector, an FVU filtration system, an automatic fire extinguisher and six 902V &quot;Tucha-2&quot; 81 mm smoke grenade launchers are standard.

At least two distinct sets of explosive reactive armour kit are currently available, giving the BMP-3 protection from less advanced rocket propelled grenades. One of them is the Kaktus ERA kit, which has a unique design that creates minimal acoustic and kinetic backlash to the armour behind it upon detonation, thus ensuring that the occupants will not be harmed by shockwaves from the ERA block. The ERA blocks will completely disintegrate after detonation. According to Kurganmashzavod, the BMP-3 may also be fitted with additional side armor tiles, which can resist .50 caliber armour-piercing ammunition perpendicularly at close ranges. They give the BMP-3 added side protection from autocannon fire as well. BMP-3s serial production with ERA started as of November 2022.

The BMP-3 also has the ability to carry a Shtora-1 electro-optical jammer that disrupts semiautomatic command to line of sight (SACLOS) antitank guided missiles, laser rangefinders and target designators. Shtora is a soft-kill, or passive-countermeasure system. BMP-3s serial production with the Nakidka camouflage system started as of May 2024. BMP-3 infantry combat vehicles started receiving serially outfitted drone suppression systems in June 2024.

The standard weight of the vehicle is 18.7 tonnes. If additional armour overlay (metal sheet of armour and Kaktus ERA) is installed, the weight will reach to 22.2 tonnes. The body is covered from the sides and the top. In such kit, it is protected against 12.7 mm machine gun rounds in the range of 100–200 m. Rostec reported in September 2023 that the production of additional protection kits for the BMP-3 increased 30 times in comparison with 2022.

== Operational history ==
=== First Chechen War ===
The BMP-3 saw action with the Russian forces during the First Chechen War.

=== Kosovo ===
In 2000, the United Arab Emirates deployed some BMP-3s in peacekeeping operations during the Kosovo War.

=== Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen ===
The BMP-3 also saw military use with Emirati forces during the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen, where it is currently deployed.

=== Russo-Ukrainian War===

The BMP-3 has been used during the post-2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine by Russian forces. An unknown number have been put into service by the Armed Forces of Ukraine after being captured. Ukrainian anti-tank missiles and attack drones with HEAT warheads have been able to overcome protection systems on the BMP-3 such as reactive and slat armor, so by 2024 they were increasingly being used for indirect fire support.

As of February 5, 2025, open source intelligence website Oryx has visually confirmed the loss of 677 Russian BMP-3s (417 destroyed, 69 abandoned, 24 damaged, and 67 captured).

== Variants ==

The 9P157-2 carries two 9M123 missiles on launch rails, which are extended from a stowed position; the radar is also stowed during transit. The missiles are reloaded automatically from an internal magazine with 15 rounds (missiles are stored and transported in sealed canisters) and can also accept munitions manually loaded from outside the vehicle. The manufacturer claims that three 9P157-2 tank destroyers are able to engage 14 attacking tanks and destroy at least sixty percent of the attacking force. The dual guidance system ensures protection against electronic countermeasures and operation in all climatic conditions, day or night. NBC protection is provided for the crew (gunner and driver) of each 9P157-2 in addition to full armor protection equivalent to the standard BMP-3 chassis and entrenching equipment. The 9M123 missile itself is supersonic, flying at an average speed of and a range of between 400 and 6,000 meters. Entered service in 2005. More than 10 sets of new anti-tank guided missile (ATGM) complexes &quot;Khrizantema-S&quot; on the crawler, which replaced the &quot;Shturm&quot; complexes, entered the artillery units of the Southern Military District, based in Ingushetia, in November 2012. Khrizantema vehicles are fielded with artillery units.

<text>Centi- (symbol c) is a unit prefix in the metric system denoting a factor of one hundredth. Proposed in 1793, and adopted in 1795, the prefix comes from the Latin , meaning &quot;hundred&quot; (cf. century, cent, percent, centennial). Since 1960, the prefix is part of the International System of Units (SI). It is mainly used in combination with the unit &quot;metre&quot; to form &quot;centimetre&quot;, a common unit of length.

Example
* A honey bee is about 1.3 centimetres long.

<text>Coronaviruses are a group of related RNA viruses that cause diseases in mammals and birds. In humans and birds, they cause respiratory tract infections that can range from mild to lethal. Mild illnesses in humans include some cases of the common cold (which is also caused by other viruses, predominantly rhinoviruses), while more lethal varieties can cause SARS, MERS and COVID-19. In cows and pigs they cause diarrhea, while in mice they cause hepatitis and encephalomyelitis.

Coronaviruses constitute the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae, in the family &quot;Coronaviridae&quot;, order &quot;Nidovirales&quot; and realm &quot;Riboviria&quot;. They are enveloped viruses with a positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome and a nucleocapsid of helical symmetry. The genome size of coronaviruses ranges from approximately 26 to 32 kilobases, one of the largest among RNA viruses. They have characteristic club-shaped spikes that project from their surface, which in electron micrographs create an image reminiscent of the stellar corona, from which their name derives.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;coronavirus&quot; is derived from Latin &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;crown&quot; or &quot;wreath&quot;, itself a borrowing from Greek &quot;korṓnē&quot;, &quot;garland, wreath&quot;. The name was coined by June Almeida and David Tyrrell who first observed and studied human coronaviruses. The word was first used in print in 1968 by an informal group of virologists in the journal &quot;Nature&quot; to designate the new family of viruses. The name refers to the characteristic appearance of virions (the infective form of the virus) by electron microscopy, which have a fringe of large, bulbous surface projections creating an image reminiscent of the solar corona or halo. This morphology is created by the viral spike peplomers, which are proteins on the surface of the virus.

The scientific name &quot;Coronavirus&quot; was accepted as a genus name by the International Committee for the Nomenclature of Viruses (later renamed International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses) in 1971. As the number of new species increased, the genus was split into four genera, namely &quot;Alphacoronavirus&quot;, &quot;Betacoronavirus&quot;, &quot;Deltacoronavirus&quot;, and &quot;Gammacoronavirus&quot; in 2009. The common name coronavirus is used to refer to any member of the subfamily &quot;Orthocoronavirinae&quot;. As of 2020, 45 species are officially recognised.

== History ==
The earliest reports of a coronavirus infection in animals occurred in the late 1920s, when an acute respiratory infection of domesticated chickens emerged in North America. Arthur Schalk and M.C. Hawn in 1931 made the first detailed report which described a new respiratory infection of chickens in North Dakota. The infection of new-born chicks was characterized by gasping and listlessness with high mortality rates of 40–90%. Leland David Bushnell and Carl Alfred Brandly isolated the virus that caused the infection in 1933. The virus was then known as infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). Charles D. Hudson and Fred Robert Beaudette cultivated the virus for the first time in 1937. The specimen came to be known as the Beaudette strain. In the late 1940s, two more animal coronaviruses, JHM that causes brain disease (murine encephalitis) and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) that causes hepatitis in mice were discovered. It was not realized at the time that these three different viruses were related.

Human coronaviruses were discovered in the 1960s using two different methods in the United Kingdom and the United States. E.C. Kendall, Malcolm Bynoe, and David Tyrrell working at the Common Cold Unit of the British Medical Research Council collected a unique common cold virus designated B814 in 1961. The virus could not be cultivated using standard techniques which had successfully cultivated rhinoviruses, adenoviruses and other known common cold viruses. In 1965, Tyrrell and Bynoe successfully cultivated the novel virus by serially passing it through organ culture of human embryonic trachea. The new cultivating method was introduced to the lab by Bertil Hoorn. The isolated virus when intranasally inoculated into volunteers caused a cold and was inactivated by ether which indicated it had a lipid envelope. Dorothy Hamre and John Procknow at the University of Chicago isolated a novel cold from medical students in 1962. They isolated and grew the virus in kidney tissue culture, designating it 229E. The novel virus caused a cold in volunteers and, like B814, was inactivated by ether.
Scottish virologist June Almeida at St Thomas&#x27; Hospital in London, collaborating with Tyrrell, compared the structures of IBV, B814 and 229E in 1967. Using electron microscopy the three viruses were shown to be morphologically related by their general shape and distinctive club-like spikes. A research group at the National Institute of Health the same year was able to isolate another member of this new group of viruses using organ culture and named one of the samples OC43 (OC for organ culture). Like B814, 229E, and IBV, the novel cold virus OC43 had distinctive club-like spikes when observed with the electron microscope.

The IBV-like novel cold viruses were soon shown to be also morphologically related to the mouse hepatitis virus. This new group of viruses were named coronaviruses after their distinctive morphological appearance. Human coronavirus 229E and human coronavirus OC43 continued to be studied in subsequent decades. The coronavirus strain B814 was lost. It is not known which present human coronavirus it was. Other human coronaviruses have since been identified, including SARS-CoV in 2003, HCoV NL63 in 2003, HCoV HKU1 in 2004, MERS-CoV in 2013, and SARS-CoV-2 in 2019. There have also been a large number of animal coronaviruses identified since the 1960s.&quot;&quot;

== Microbiology ==

=== Structure ===
Coronaviruses are large, roughly spherical particles with unique surface projections. Their size is highly variable with average diameters of 80 to 120 nm. Extreme sizes are known from 50 to 200 nm in diameter. The total molecular mass is on average 40,000 kDa. They are enclosed in an envelope embedded with a number of protein molecules. The lipid bilayer envelope, membrane proteins, and nucleocapsid protect the virus when it is outside the host cell.

The viral envelope is made up of a lipid bilayer in which the membrane (M), envelope (E) and spike (S) structural proteins are anchored. The molar ratio of E:S:M in the lipid bilayer is approximately 1:20:300. The E and M protein are the structural proteins that combined with the lipid bilayer to shape the viral envelope and maintain its size. S proteins are needed for interaction with the host cells. But human coronavirus NL63 is peculiar in that its M protein has the binding site for the host cell, and not its S protein. The diameter of the envelope is 85 nm. The envelope of the virus in electron micrographs appears as a distinct pair of electron-dense shells (shells that are relatively opaque to the electron beam used to scan the virus particle).

The M protein is the main structural protein of the envelope that provides the overall shape and is a type III membrane protein. It consists of 218 to 263 amino acid residues and forms a layer 7.8 nm thick. It has three domains, a short N-terminal ectodomain, a triple-spanning transmembrane domain, and a C-terminal endodomain. The C-terminal domain forms a matrix-like lattice that adds to the extra-thickness of the envelope. Different species can have either &quot;N&quot;- or &quot;O&quot;-linked glycans in their protein amino-terminal domain. The M protein is crucial during the assembly, budding, envelope formation, and pathogenesis stages of the virus lifecycle.

The E proteins are minor structural proteins and highly variable in different species. There are only about 20 copies of the E protein molecule in a coronavirus particle. They are 8.4 to 12 kDa in size and are composed of 76 to 109 amino acids. They are integral proteins (i.e. embedded in the lipid layer) and have two domains namely a transmembrane domain and an extramembrane C-terminal domain. They are almost fully α-helical, with a single α-helical transmembrane domain, and form pentameric (five-molecular) ion channels in the lipid bilayer. They are responsible for virion assembly, intracellular trafficking and morphogenesis (budding).
The spikes are the most distinguishing feature of coronaviruses and are responsible for the corona- or halo-like surface. On average a coronavirus particle has 74 surface spikes. Each spike is about 20 nm long and is composed of a trimer of the Sprotein. The S protein is in turn composed of an S1 and S2 subunit. The homotrimeric Sprotein is a class I fusion protein which mediates the receptor binding and membrane fusion between the virus and host cell. The S1 subunit forms the head of the spike and has the receptor-binding domain (RBD). The S2 subunit forms the stem which anchors the spike in the viral envelope and on protease activation enables fusion. The two subunits remain noncovalently linked as they are exposed on the viral surface until they attach to the host cell membrane. In a functionally active state, three S1 are attached to two S2 subunits. The subunit complex is split into individual subunits when the virus binds and fuses with the host cell under the action of proteases such as cathepsin family and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) of the host cell.
S1 proteins are the most critical components in terms of infection. They are also the most variable components as they are responsible for host cell specificity. They possess two major domains named N-terminal domain (S1-NTD) and C-terminal domain (S1-CTD), both of which serve as the receptor-binding domains. The NTDs recognize and bind sugars on the surface of the host cell. An exception is the MHV NTD that binds to a protein receptor carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1). S1-CTDs are responsible for recognizing different protein receptors such as angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), aminopeptidase N (APN), and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4).

A subset of coronaviruses (specifically the members of betacoronavirus subgroup A) also has a shorter spike-like surface protein called hemagglutinin esterase (HE). The HE proteins occur as homodimers composed of about 400 amino acid residues and are 40 to 50 kDa in size. They appear as tiny surface projections of 5 to 7 nm long embedded in between the spikes. They help in the attachment to and detachment from the host cell.

Inside the envelope, there is the nucleocapsid, which is formed from multiple copies of the nucleocapsid (N) protein, which are bound to the positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome in a continuous beads-on-a-string type conformation. N protein is a phosphoprotein of 43 to 50 kDa in size, and is divided into three conserved domains. The majority of the protein is made up of domains 1 and 2, which are typically rich in arginines and lysines. Domain 3 has a short carboxy terminal end and has a net negative charge due to excess of acidic over basic amino acid residues.

=== Genome ===

Coronaviruses contain a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome. The genome size for coronaviruses ranges from 26.4 to 31.7 kilobases. The genome size is one of the largest among RNA viruses. The genome has a 5′ methylated cap and a 3′ polyadenylated tail.

The genome organization for a coronavirus is 5′-leader-UTR-replicase (ORF1ab)-spike (S)-envelope (E)-membrane (M)-nucleocapsid (N)-3′UTR-poly (A) tail. The open reading frames 1a and 1b, which occupy the first two-thirds of the genome, encode the replicase polyprotein (pp1ab). The replicase polyprotein self cleaves to form 16 nonstructural proteins (nsp1–nsp16).

The later reading frames encode the four major structural proteins: spike, envelope, membrane, and nucleocapsid. Interspersed between these reading frames are the reading frames for the accessory proteins. The number of accessory proteins and their function is unique depending on the specific coronavirus.

=== Replication cycle ===

==== Cell entry ====
Infection begins when the viral spike protein attaches to its complementary host cell receptor. After attachment, a protease of the host cell cleaves and activates the receptor-attached spike protein. Depending on the host cell protease available, cleavage and activation allows the virus to enter the host cell by endocytosis or direct fusion of the viral envelope with the host membrane.

Coronaviruses can enter cells by either fusing to their lipid envelope with the cell membrane on the cell surface or by internalization via endocytosis.

==== Genome translation ====
On entry into the host cell, the virus particle is uncoated, and its genome enters the cell cytoplasm. The coronavirus RNA genome has a 5′ methylated cap and a 3′ polyadenylated tail, which allows it to act like a messenger RNA and be directly translated by the host cell&#x27;s ribosomes. The host ribosomes translate the initial overlapping open reading frames ORF1a and ORF1b of the virus genome into two large overlapping polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab.

The larger polyprotein pp1ab is a result of a -1 ribosomal frameshift caused by a slippery sequence (UUUAAAC) and a downstream RNA pseudoknot at the end of open reading frame ORF1a. The ribosomal frameshift allows for the continuous translation of ORF1a followed by ORF1b.

The polyproteins have their own proteases, PLpro (nsp3) and 3CLpro (nsp5), which cleave the polyproteins at different specific sites. The cleavage of polyprotein pp1ab yields 16 nonstructural proteins (nsp1 to nsp16). Product proteins include various replication proteins such as RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (nsp12), RNA helicase (nsp13), and exoribonuclease (nsp14).

==== Replicase-transcriptase ====
A number of the nonstructural proteins coalesce to form a multi-protein replicase-transcriptase complex (RTC). The main replicase-transcriptase protein is the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). It is directly involved in the replication and transcription of RNA from an RNA strand. The other nonstructural proteins in the complex assist in the replication and transcription process. The exoribonuclease nonstructural protein, for instance, provides extra fidelity to replication by providing a proofreading function which the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase lacks.

&quot;Replication&quot; – One of the main functions of the complex is to replicate the viral genome. RdRp directly mediates the synthesis of negative-sense genomic RNA from the positive-sense genomic RNA. This is followed by the replication of positive-sense genomic RNA from the negative-sense genomic RNA.


&quot;Transcription&quot; – The other important function of the complex is to transcribe the viral genome. RdRp directly mediates the synthesis of negative-sense subgenomic RNA molecules from the positive-sense genomic RNA. This process is followed by the transcription of these negative-sense subgenomic RNA molecules to their corresponding positive-sense mRNAs. The subgenomic mRNAs form a &quot;nested set&quot; which have a common 5&#x27;-head and partially duplicate 3&#x27;-end.

&quot;Recombination&quot; – The replicase-transcriptase complex is also capable of genetic recombination when at least two viral genomes are present in the same infected cell. RNA recombination appears to be a major driving force in determining genetic variability within a coronavirus species, the capability of a coronavirus species to jump from one host to another and, infrequently, in determining the emergence of novel coronaviruses. The exact mechanism of recombination in coronaviruses is unclear, but likely involves template switching during genome replication.

==== Assembly and release ====
The replicated positive-sense genomic RNA becomes the genome of the progeny viruses. The mRNAs are gene transcripts of the last third of the virus genome after the initial overlapping reading frame. These mRNAs are translated by the host&#x27;s ribosomes into the structural proteins and many accessory proteins. RNA translation occurs inside the endoplasmic reticulum. The viral structural proteins S, E, and M move along the secretory pathway into the Golgi intermediate compartment. There, the Mproteins direct most protein-protein interactions required for the assembly of viruses following its binding to the nucleocapsid. Progeny viruses are then released from the host cell by exocytosis through secretory vesicles. Once released the viruses can infect other host cells.

=== Transmission ===
Infected carriers are able to shed viruses into the environment. The interaction of the coronavirus spike protein with its complementary cell receptor is central in determining the tissue tropism, infectivity, and species range of the released virus. Coronaviruses mainly target epithelial cells.&quot;&quot; They are transmitted from one host to another host, depending on the coronavirus species, by either an aerosol, fomite, or fecal-oral route.

Human coronaviruses infect the epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, while animal coronaviruses generally infect the epithelial cells of the digestive tract.&quot;&quot; SARS coronavirus, for example, infects the human epithelial cells of the lungs via an aerosol route by binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. Transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) infects the pig epithelial cells of the digestive tract via a fecal–oral route by binding to the alanine aminopeptidase (APN) receptor.

== Classification ==

Coronaviruses form the subfamily &quot;Orthocoronavirinae,&quot; which is one of two subfamilies in the family &quot;Coronaviridae,&quot; order &quot;Nidovirales,&quot; and realm &quot;Riboviria.&quot; They are divided into the four genera: &quot;Alphacoronavirus&quot;, &quot;Betacoronavirus&quot;, &quot;Gammacoronavirus&quot; and &quot;Deltacoronavirus&quot;. Alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses infect mammals, while gammacoronaviruses and deltacoronaviruses primarily infect birds.&quot;&quot;

== Origin ==

The most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of all coronaviruses is estimated to have existed as recently as 8000 BCE, although some models place the common ancestor as far back as 55 million years or more, implying long term coevolution with bat and avian species. The most recent common ancestor of the alphacoronavirus line has been placed at about 2400 BCE, of the betacoronavirus line at 3300 BCE, of the gammacoronavirus line at 2800 BCE, and the deltacoronavirus line at about 3000 BCE. Bats and birds, as warm-blooded flying vertebrates, are an ideal natural reservoir for the coronavirus gene pool (with bats the reservoir for alphacoronaviruses and betacoronavirusand birds the reservoir for gammacoronaviruses and deltacoronaviruses). The large number and global range of bat and avian species that host viruses have enabled extensive evolution and dissemination of coronaviruses.

Many human coronaviruses have their origin in bats. The human coronavirus NL63 shared a common ancestor with a bat coronavirus (ARCoV.2) between 1190 and 1449 CE. The human coronavirus 229E shared a common ancestor with a bat coronavirus (GhanaGrp1 Bt CoV) between 1686 and 1800 CE. More recently, alpaca coronavirus and human coronavirus 229E diverged sometime before 1960. MERS-CoV emerged in humans from bats through the intermediate host of camels. MERS-CoV, although related to several bat coronavirus species, appears to have diverged from these several centuries ago. The most closely related bat coronavirus and SARS-CoV diverged in 1986. The ancestors of SARS-CoV first infected leaf-nose bats of the genus &quot;Hipposideridae&quot;; subsequently, they spread to horseshoe bats in the species &quot;Rhinolophidae&quot;, then to Asian palm civets, and finally to humans.

Unlike other betacoronaviruses, bovine coronavirus of the species &quot;Betacoronavirus 1&quot; and subgenus &quot;Embecovirus&quot; is thought to have originated in rodents and not in bats. In the 1790s, equine coronavirus diverged from the bovine coronavirus after a cross-species jump. Later in the 1890s, human coronavirus OC43 diverged from bovine coronavirus after another cross-species spillover event. It is speculated that the flu pandemic of 1890 may have been caused by this spillover event, and not by the influenza virus, because of the related timing, neurological symptoms, and unknown causative agent of the pandemic. Besides causing respiratory infections, human coronavirus OC43 is also suspected of playing a role in neurological diseases. In the 1950s, the human coronavirus OC43 began to diverge into its present genotypes. Phylogenetically, mouse hepatitis virus (&quot;Murine coronavirus&quot;), which infects the mouse&#x27;s liver and central nervous system, is related to human coronavirus OC43 and bovine coronavirus. Human coronavirus HKU1, like the aforementioned viruses, also has its origins in rodents.

== Infection in humans ==

Coronaviruses vary significantly in risk factor. Some can kill more than 30% of those infected, such as MERS-CoV, and some are relatively harmless, such as the common cold. Coronaviruses can cause colds with major symptoms, such as fever, and a sore throat from swollen adenoids. Coronaviruses can cause pneumonia (either direct viral pneumonia or secondary bacterial pneumonia) and bronchitis (either direct viral bronchitis or secondary bacterial bronchitis). The human coronavirus discovered in 2003, SARS-CoV, which causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), has a unique pathogenesis because it causes both upper and lower respiratory tract infections.

Six species of human coronaviruses are known, with one species subdivided into two different strains, making seven strains of human coronaviruses altogether.

Four human coronaviruses produce symptoms that are generally mild, even though it is contended they might have been more aggressive in the past:
# Human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43), β-CoV
# Human coronavirus HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1), β-CoV
# Human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), α-CoV
# Human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63), α-CoV–

Three human coronaviruses produce potentially severe symptoms:
# Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), β-CoV (identified in 2003) 
# Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV), β-CoV (identified in 2012)
# Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), β-CoV (identified in 2019)

These cause the diseases commonly called SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 respectively.

=== Common cold ===
Although the common cold is usually caused by rhinoviruses, in about 15% of cases the cause is a coronavirus. The human coronaviruses HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-NL63 continually circulate in the human population in adults and children worldwide and produce the generally mild symptoms of the common cold. The four mild coronaviruses have a seasonal incidence occurring in the winter months in temperate climates. There is no preponderance in any season in tropical climates.

=== Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) ===

In 2003, following the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) which had begun the prior year in Asia, and secondary cases elsewhere in the world, the World Health Organization (WHO) issued a press release stating that a novel coronavirus identified by several laboratories was the causative agent for SARS. The virus was officially named the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV). More than 8,000 people from 29 countries and territories were infected, and at least 774 died.

=== Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) ===
In September 2012, a new type of coronavirus was identified, initially called Novel Coronavirus 2012, and now officially named Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). The World Health Organization issued a global alert soon after. The WHO update on 28 September 2012 said the virus did not seem to pass easily from person to person. However, on 12 May 2013, a case of human-to-human transmission in France was confirmed by the French Ministry of Social Affairs and Health. In addition, cases of human-to-human transmission were reported by the Ministry of Health in Tunisia. Two confirmed cases involved people who seemed to have caught the disease from their late father, who became ill after a visit to Qatar and Saudi Arabia. Despite this, it appears the virus had trouble spreading from human to human, as most individuals who are infected do not transmit the virus. By 30 October 2013, there were 124 cases and 52 deaths in Saudi Arabia.

After the Dutch Erasmus Medical Centre sequenced the virus, the virus was given a new name, Human Coronavirus–Erasmus Medical Centre (HCoV-EMC). The final name for the virus is Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). The only U.S. cases (both survived) were recorded in May 2014.

In May 2015, an outbreak of MERS-CoV occurred in the Republic of Korea, when a man who had traveled to the Middle East, visited four hospitals in the Seoul area to treat his illness. This caused one of the largest outbreaks of MERS-CoV outside the Middle East. As of December 2019, 2,468 cases of MERS-CoV infection had been confirmed by laboratory tests, 851 of which were fatal, a mortality rate of approximately 34.5%.

=== Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) ===
In December 2019, a pneumonia outbreak was reported in Wuhan, China. On 31 December 2019, the outbreak was traced to a novel strain of coronavirus, which was given the interim name 2019-nCoV by the World Health Organization, later renamed SARS-CoV-2 by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses.

As of , there were at least confirmed deaths and more than confirmed cases in the COVID-19 pandemic. The Wuhan strain has been identified as a new strain of Betacoronavirus from group 2B with approximately 70% genetic similarity to the SARS-CoV. The virus has a 96% similarity to a bat coronavirus, so it is widely suspected to originate from bats as well.

=== Coronavirus HuPn-2018 ===
During a surveillance study of archived samples of Malaysian viral pneumonia patients, virologists identified a strain of canine coronavirus which has infected humans in 2018.

== Infection in animals ==
Coronaviruses have been recognized as causing pathological conditions in veterinary medicine since the 1930s. They infect a range of animals including swine, cattle, horses, camels, cats, dogs, rodents, birds and bats. The majority of animal related coronaviruses infect the intestinal tract and are transmitted by a fecal-oral route. Significant research efforts have been focused on elucidating the viral pathogenesis of these animal coronaviruses, especially by virologists interested in veterinary and zoonotic diseases.

=== Farm animals ===
Coronaviruses infect domesticated birds. Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), a type of coronavirus, causes avian infectious bronchitis. The virus is of concern to the poultry industry because of the high mortality from infection, its rapid spread, and its effect on production. The virus affects both meat production and egg production and causes substantial economic loss. In chickens, infectious bronchitis virus targets not only the respiratory tract but also the urogenital tract. The virus can spread to different organs throughout the chicken. The virus is transmitted by aerosol and food contaminated by feces. Different vaccines against IBV exist and have helped to limit the spread of the virus and its variants. Infectious bronchitis virus is one of a number of strains of the species &quot;Avian coronavirus&quot;. Another strain of avian coronavirus is turkey coronavirus (TCV) which causes enteritis in turkeys.

Coronaviruses also affect other branches of animal husbandry such as pig farming and cattle raising. Swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV), which is related to bat coronavirus HKU2, causes diarrhea in pigs. Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a coronavirus that has recently emerged and similarly causes diarrhea in pigs. Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), which is a member of the species &quot;Alphacoronavirus 1&quot;, is another coronavirus that causes diarrhea in young pigs. In the cattle industry bovine coronavirus (BCV), which is a member of the species &quot;Betacoronavirus 1&quot; and related to HCoV-OC43, is responsible for severe profuse enteritis in young calves.

=== Domestic pets ===
Coronaviruses infect domestic pets such as cats, dogs, and ferrets. There are two forms of feline coronavirus which are both members of the species &quot;Alphacoronavirus 1&quot;. Feline enteric coronavirus is a pathogen of minor clinical significance, but spontaneous mutation of this virus can result in feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), a disease with high mortality. There are two different coronaviruses that infect dogs. Canine coronavirus (CCoV), which is a member of the species &quot;Alphacoronavirus 1&quot;, causes mild gastrointestinal disease. Canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV), which is a member of the species &quot;Betacoronavirus 1&quot; and related to HCoV-OC43, cause respiratory disease. Similarly, there are two types of coronavirus that infect ferrets. Ferret enteric coronavirus causes a gastrointestinal syndrome known as epizootic catarrhal enteritis (ECE), and a more lethal systemic version of the virus (like FIP in cats) known as ferret systemic coronavirus (FSC).

=== Laboratory animals ===
Coronaviruses infect laboratory animals. Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), which is a member of the species &quot;Murine coronavirus&quot;, causes an epidemic murine illness with high mortality, especially among colonies of laboratory mice. Prior to the discovery of SARS-CoV, MHV was the best-studied coronavirus both &quot;in vivo&quot; and &quot;in vitro&quot; as well as at the molecular level. Some strains of MHV cause a progressive demyelinating encephalitis in mice which has been used as a murine model for multiple sclerosis. Sialodacryoadenitis virus (SDAV), which is a strain of the species &quot;Murine coronavirus&quot;, is highly infectious coronavirus of laboratory rats, which can be transmitted between individuals by direct contact and indirectly by aerosol. Rabbit enteric coronavirus causes acute gastrointestinal disease and diarrhea in young European rabbits. Mortality rates are high.

== Prevention and treatment ==
A number of vaccines using different methods have been developed against human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Antiviral targets against human coronaviruses have also been identified such as viral proteases, polymerases, and entry proteins. Drugs are in development which target these proteins and the different steps of viral replication.

Vaccines are available for animal coronaviruses IBV, TGEV, and Canine CoV, although their effectiveness is limited. In the case of outbreaks of highly contagious animal coronaviruses, such as PEDV, measures such as destruction of entire herds of pigs may be used to prevent transmission to other herds.

<text>The Combat Vehicle 90 (CV90) (, strf 90 or Stridsfordon 90) is a family of Swedish tracked armoured combat vehicles designed by the Swedish Defence Materiel Administration (FMV), Hägglund &amp; Söner and Bofors during the mid-1980s to early 1990s, before entering service in Sweden in the mid-1990s. The CV90 platform design has continuously evolved from the Mk 0 to the current Mk IV with technological advances and changing battlefield requirements.

The Swedish version of the main infantry fighting vehicle (IFV) is fitted with a turret from Bofors equipped with a 40 mm Bofors autocannon. Export versions are fitted with Hägglunds E-series turrets, armed with either a 30 mm Mk44 or a 35 mm Bushmaster autocannon. Over time, the involvement of Hägglund &amp; Söner has been superseded by Alvis Hägglunds (from 1997) and BAE Systems Hägglunds (from 2004).

Developed specifically for the Nordic subarctic climate, the vehicle has very good mobility in snow and wetlands while carrying and supporting eight, and in later versions six, fully equipped soldiers. Other variants include forward artillery observation, command and control, anti-aircraft, armoured recovery vehicle, electronic warfare versions and so forth. Currently, 1,400 vehicles in 17 variants are (or will be) in service with ten user states, seven of which are part of the NATO alliance.

== History ==
During the Cold War, in 1983, the Swedish Army required vehicles with high mobility, air defence and anti-tank capability, high survivability and protection. In 1985, the &quot;stridsfordon 90&quot; project group, made up of representatives from the Swedish Armed Forces (&quot;Försvarsmakten&quot;), the FMV and Swedish industry (including Hägglunds and Bofors), finalized the design for a &quot;unity vehicle&quot; that originated from an air force concept. In 1986, the prototypes for strf 9040 and strf 9025 were ordered. Five prototypes were constructed but, before delivery in 1988, the 9025 version was discontinued. The prototypes were tested during extensive trials between 1988 and 1991, during which prototypes for specialized variants (forward observation, command and control, and armoured recovery vehicles) were ordered. The first deliveries started in 1994.

The CV90 has undergone four mark shifts to meet different customer requirements, focusing on capability enhancements.

===CV90 Mk 0===
The first CV90 delivered (retroactively named mark 0) was for Sweden, and was armed with a Bofors 40/70B cannon (a dedicated armored fighting vehicle variant of the Bofors 40 mm Automatic Gun L/70) in a two-man turret, which had beaten out the 25 mm M242 Bushmaster chain gun during initial prototype trials. The Mk 0 has a conventional electrical system and was fitted for but not with appliqué armour systems. The Swedish Army ordered five variants of the CV90. The requirements expressed by the Swedish FMV on signature management were extremely challenging and led to a lot of new design features inherited by all subsequent generations (Mks 0 to III). FMV also prioritized the requirements to provide the best possible design to fulfil user needs. Furthermore, the CV90 was also built for high reliability and ease of maintenance using only standard onboard tools and for conscripts to maintain and operate.

===CV90 Mk I===
The next variant of CV90, known as the Mk I, was delivered to Norway after winning the country&#x27;s competition for a new IFV against contemporaries such as the American M2 Bradley, British FV510 Warrior, and Austro-Spanish ASCOD (Pizarro/ULAN). The Mk I variant of the CV90 had a newly designed two-man 30 mm turret, evolved from the 25 mm turret. CV90 Mk I was the first IFV with high-hit probability performance during suppression fire modes, both while the vehicle is on the move and against air targets. The CV90 Mk I incorporated several improvements over the original Swedish CV90. Evaluations of mobility, reliability, lethality, fightability, ergonomics, durability and survivability were performed during the CV90 Mk I trial phase for these vehicles, with good results.

===CV90 Mk II===
The CV90 Mk I was the base for the next development, the CV90 Mk II. The Mk II was produced in three variants: the CV9030 CH (Switzerland) IFV and COM, and the CV9030 FIN (Finland) IFV. Both contracts were won in competition against other IFVs. One significant difference between the two variants was hull size: the Swiss variant is 100 mm higher over the front, with an additional 70 mm over the combat compartment at the rear. Another difference is the Mk II&#x27;s partial digitization and built-in Health &amp; Unit Monitoring System (HUMS), along with interactive manuals and instructions. The CV90 Mk II&#x27;s standard armament is the Mk44 Bushmaster II autocannon.

===CV90 Mk III===

The Mk III variant of the CV90 is a further development of the CV90 Mk II. The areas that underwent the most development were lethality, fightability, electronic architecture, survivability and mobility. The weapon system was upgraded to a 35/50 mm Bushmaster III cannon with an integrated muzzle ammunition programmer and a number of different firing scenarios depending on target setup. The crew station design provides the gunner and commander with a continuous eye-on-target engagement feature (crew members do not need to remove their head from the eyepiece to see and operate equipment).

Further electronic architecture upgrades made the Mk III completely digitized. Mobility improvements consisted of upgraded suspension and enhanced power-to-weight ratio to handle the increased gross vehicle weight. Improved survivability mainly came in the areas of mine protection and top attack. Horizontal protection was designed in similar ways to other CV90 variants, i.e. appliqué systems. The first variant of the Mk III, the Mk IIIa, was delivered to the Netherlands and Denmark, and the second, more modern Mk IIIb variant was delivered to Norway.

===CV90 Mk IV===

The CV90 Mk IV is equipped with a new Scania engine which develops up to and the latest upgraded X300 heavy-duty transmission. Its maximum weight was increased from 35 to 37 tonnes, with space for two tonnes of additional payload, without a decrease in vehicle agility. It features a new augmented reality system named . The concept fuses data from different systems within the vehicle to filter and prioritize the most critical information, allowing quicker crew decision-making and improved battlefield performance. The Mk IV generation is also the first Western IFV with a qualified Active Protection System. It is equipped with fourth generation electronic architecture supporting future technology adoption and growth.

=== CV90 Mk V ===
The Swedish army is supporting the development of an improved variant from between 2023 and 2027. No agreement has yet been concluded between the FMV and the industry on that development. The development goals focus on:
* A hybrid electric propulsion system will be proposed and potentially integrated to this version
* The C4ISR system is to be fully digitalized
* Improvement of the heat, radar and visual signature management of the vehicle
* Integrate Beyond Line Of Sight (BLOS) anti-tank guided missiles. Akeron MP is a next generation medium-range, man-portable, anti-tank missile, which has a BLOS capability.
* Integration of UAV. 
Initial tests involving the use of the Akeron MP and of a UAV were performed in January 2023.

This variant might be ordered, and it would extend the lifetime of the CV90 in the Swedish Army beyond 2034. An upgrade of the IFV variant (strf 90) including some of these elements is very likely.

== Design ==
Varying customer requirements have led to multiple CV90 variants with major differences in survivability and electronic architecture. Increased protection has led to higher curb weight; the vehicle&#x27;s combat weight has risen from 23 to 35 tonnes. With increasingly powerful diesel engines, the power-to-weight ratio has remained approximately the same. The track suspension system has seen several successive upgrades.

The Mk III version has a digital electronic architecture with several different CAN-buses and digital networks, and is the first IFV incorporating an automatic defensive aide suite which classifies threats and, in automatic mode, can fire smoke and/or the main gun to eliminate or evade targets, as well as instruct the driver on potential threats. At the Eurosatory 2010 exhibition, a version called Armadillo was presented. The Armadillo shown was an armoured personnel carrier (APC) version. The basic chassis can be readily converted to ambulance, control vehicle or other turreted versions.

=== Protection ===
The CV9040&#x27;s basic armour provides all-round protection against 14.5 mm armour-piercing rounds. Armour protection over the frontal arc is classified, but all models from CV9040B onwards are said to be protected against 30 mm APFSDS rounds. Some variants, including the CV9030N, can be fitted with MEXAS, a ceramic appliqué armor that provides protection against 30 mm APFSDS. This armour kit is intended to provide increased protection against improvised explosive devices, explosively formed penetrators, and 30 mm caliber armour-piercing rounds. All CV90s are fitted with a spall liner, which covers the interior spaces and provides protection for the troops inside against shrapnel and anti-personnel artillery munitions.

The CV90 can also be fitted with cage armour, which provides protection against tandem-charge and shaped charge warheads. The CV90 is fitted with a nuclear, biological, and chemical (NBC) filtration system accompanied by a chemical detector and radiation detector systems. The CV90 also uses heat-absorbing filters to provide temporary protection against thermal imaging, image intensifiers and infrared cameras. The CV90 was designed with a very low and compact structure to minimize radar and IR signatures.

With every generation of CV90 there has been an increase in payload and corresponding protection levels. The inherent mine protection levels have risen substantially to presently defeat the heaviest (10 kg TNT) anti-tank mines.

In December 2016, BAE Systems received a contract from the Netherlands to test the Israel Military Industries Iron Fist active protection system on their CV9035 vehicles. Iron Fist employs a multi-sensor early warning system using both infrared and radar sensors to deploy soft- and hard-kill countermeasures against anti-tank rockets and missiles. A decision for integration was to be made by early 2018.

In 2011, Hägglunds (now BAE Systems AB) demonstrated a version with an infrared camouflage called Adaptiv, consisting of thermoelectric plates capable of posing as many different objects, such as ordinary cars, stones, trees etc. to an enemy IR-viewfinder. It takes 1,500 plates to cover a CV90, at a cost of $100 per plate.

=== Mobility ===
The CV90 Mk 0 is powered by a DSI14 engine developed by Scania, which provides 550 horsepower and can reach speeds of per hour. The basic CV90 has a maximum road range of , but the latest generation can reach up to . The CV90 offers quiet movement for improved stealth, high speed over good terrain, and high ground clearance for protection against mines and improvised explosive devices.

BAE Systems is considering upgrading the CV90 with a hybrid-electric propulsion system as armies look to cut fuel expenses to respond to environmental issues and fuel economy. A hybrid-electric drive could cut fuel consumption by 10 to 30 percent. The new system would also provide a power boost to move the vehicle. The hybrid-electric combines a standard diesel engine with a battery pack to provide extra power to propel the vehicle or provide additional electricity. BAE Systems Hägglunds uses the knowledge acquired through many years of hybrid-electric drive development for the military SEP vehicles and the ongoing civilian hybrid-electric projects for forest machines, airplane howlers and loaders.

In April 2015, BAE Systems fitted a CV90 with an active damping suspension system derived from Formula One racing cars. This technology calculates the vehicle&#x27;s speed and anticipates the terrain ahead, then pressurizes the suspension at independent points to lift the chassis and keep the vehicle level. The suspension, which had been modified to suit a 38-ton armored vehicle rather than a racing car, reportedly increases speed by 30-40 percent on rough terrain, outrunning main battle tanks, decreases vehicle pitch acceleration by 40 percent, gives greater maneuverability and stability for on-the-move gunnery, and reduces crew fatigue and life-cycle costs.

=== Armament ===

The basic Swedish CV90 (strf 9040) is fitted with a two-man turret armed with a Bofors 40/70B autocannon and a coaxial 7.62 mm machine gun. The CV90 also carries six 76 mm grenade launchers, which are arranged in two clusters of three launchers; the clusters are positioned on each side of the turret. The grenade launchers are intended for smoke grenades, but can also be loaded with a variety of combat grenades.

The CV90 export variants are fitted with a Hägglunds E-series turret, with more than 600 &quot;E30&quot; (30 mm Bushmaster II) and &quot;E35&quot; (35 mm Bushmaster III) turrets delivered. BAE Systems Australia presented an offer for LAND 400 Phase 3 is the CV9035 with an E35 turret. It provides high commonality with BAE Systems’ LAND 400 Phase 2 CRV offer – the AMV35 – through its use of the same E35 turret system.

=== Sight ===
The CV90 is equipped with the Universal Tank and Anti-Aircraft Sight from Saab which has daytime optical, thermal imaging system and Generation III image intensification. The Norwegian IFV, C2, Recce, Mortar and Combat Engineer variants are delivered with the Kongsberg Protector remote weapon station with 360 degrees day and night sights as well as hunter-killer capability.

== Production ==
Production of the CV90 began in 1993, and as of 2014 over 1,200 vehicles had been ordered. In November 2000, Finland ordered 57 CV9030 vehicles. Total cost was €250 million (2008 value), or €4.42 million per vehicle. In June 2004, Finland made another purchase, bringing the overall quantity ordered to 102. This time, the cost was €2.92 million (2008 value) per vehicle. In December 2005, Denmark ordered 45 CV9035 vehicles for a cost of €188 million or €4.18 million per vehicle.

The Netherlands ordered 184 combat plus 8 instruction CV9035 vehicles for a cost of €749 million, or €3.9 million per vehicle. Norway initially bought 104 CV90s in the 1990s, buying new vehicles and upgrading the old ones in the 2010s. The Norwegian Army fields 164 CV90s, of which 74 are combat vehicles, 28 combat-engineering vehicles, 24 multi-purpose vehicles, 21 reconnaissance vehicles, 15 command vehicles, and two instruction vehicles. The upgrade of the Norwegian CV90s was estimated to cost around .

In August 2023, following a visit by Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy to Stockholm, he announced an agreement with Sweden to start production of the CV90 in Ukraine.

In June 2024 it was reported that the Netherlands will manufacture 180 CV90s.

== Combat service ==
=== 2004: Strf 9040C in Liberia ===
First use was by the Swedish UN forces in Liberia 2004, where 13 strf 9040C were deployed.

=== 2007: CV9030N in Afghanistan ===

Since production began in 1993, the CV90 had remained untested in combat until November 2007, when Norwegian Army CV90s from the 2nd Battalion saw heavy combat during Operation Harekate Yolo in Afghanistan. During the first week of November, Norwegian ISAF forces from the 2nd Battalion and &quot;Kystjegerkommandoen&quot; based in Mazar-e-Sharif, responded to a Taliban attack on Afghan National Army forces in the Ghowrmach district. Having been heavily outnumbered by the Taliban forces, the Norwegians used mortars and, in particular, CV90s, to suppress the attack. The operation left an unknown number of Taliban casualties, but Norwegian news sources say as many as 45 to 65 Taliban fighters may have been killed, and many more wounded.

The CV90 was later used extensively by ISAF forces of the Norwegian Army&#x27;s Telemark Battalion in May 2008, when the battalion came under heavy machine gun and RPG fire from Taliban fighters during Operation Karez in Badghis Province. The attack left 13 Taliban fighters dead and an unknown number wounded. No allied casualties were reported. In January 2010, a Norwegian soldier was killed when a CV9030 hit a large improvised explosive device in Ghowrmach, Afghanistan.

=== 2010: CV9035DK in Afghanistan ===
In February 2010, Denmark sent ten CV9035DKs to Afghanistan in order to bolster their contingent in Helmand Province. The Danish contingent had suffered numerous casualties since they began operations in the province in the autumn of 2006. The vehicles are from the Danish Royal Lifeguard Regiment, based in the Northern part of Seeland. They are working alongside MOWAG Piranha IIIC, MOWAG Eagle IV, M113 G3DK and Leopard 2A5DK vehicles, all contributed by Denmark, in the Helmand Province. By April 2010, two of the ten vehicles had been hit with IEDs, in both cases protecting the crew and passengers from personal injury. The vehicles lost two wheels and tracks, and were sent back to the manufacturer in Sweden for further investigation. On 7 August 2010, a CV9035DK hit an IED in Afghanistan, killing two soldiers and wounding another three. The explosion was so powerful that the vehicle was turned over.

=== 2023–present: CV9040C in Ukraine ===

On 19 January 2023, the Swedish Prime Minister had announced the transfer of up to 50 CV9040Cs to Ukraine to aid against the Russian invasion of the country.

It was reported in late June 2023 that CV90s had arrived at the front line, reportedly somewhere around Bakhmut in the eastern Donbas region. The arrival of the vehicles was reported as a &quot;significant boost&quot; to the Ukrainian firepower. In July, Forbes reported that the Russian Army had knocked out the first CV90, hitting the side of the vehicle with a rocket-propelled grenade. The people onboard apparently bailed out of the damaged vehicle. Both videos and photos of the event circulated online. By mid-September, three CV90s had suffered battle damage and one was damaged and captured but no Ukrainian crew members or embarked infantry had been killed.

CV90s were reported to have been deployed by the Ukrainian 93rd Mechanized Brigade in the city of Vovchansk in anticipation of a Russian assault as part of the 2024 Kharkiv offensive.

<text>General Hilmi Özkök (born 4 August 1940) is a Turkish general who served as the 24th Chief of the General Staff of the Turkish Armed Forces. He took up that post on August 28, 2002, and served until August 30, 2006, when he retired and was succeeded by General Yaşar Büyükanıt.

Özkök has expressed support for Turkey&#x27;s alignment with the European Union, sought a reduced role for the National Security Council, and opposed his peers&#x27; plans to stage a coup.

==Education and personal life==
Hilmi Özkök was born in Turgutlu, Manisa Province, and has been a career soldier. He was educated at the Isiklar (Işıklar) Military High School in Bursa and went from there in 1957 to complete a two-year course at the Turkish Military Academy. Özkök left there as a second lieutenant in the Artillery. He has commanded an Artillery Gun Line, Forward Observation team, Fire Direction Center, SATA Battery, Battalion and Brigade. He has mostly worked with M114 155 mm howitzers and M198 howitzers. He has commanded a Brigade which included a MGM-140 ATACMS tactical ballistic missile battalion. He studied at the Army War College and the NATO Defence College in the 1970s.

He is married to Özenç Özkök and has two children.

In his retirement he is pursuing photography and poetry.

==Career==
After graduating from the Army War College in 1972, Özkök moved into military staff, initially with the Special Weapons Branch of the Allied Forces Southern Europe (AFSOUTH), and then at SHAPE. He was promoted to brigadier general in 1984 and worked as Chief of Planning and Operations for the General Staff (TGS). From 1986 to 1988 he commanded the 70th Infantry Brigade and on his promotion to major general in 1988 he commanded the 28th Infantry Division. He returned to the TGS in 1990 and was promoted to lieutenant general in 1992 when he was sent to Brussels to head the Turkish NATO Military Delegation for three years.

On August 30, 1996, Özkök was promoted to full general and took charge of the NATO Allied Land Forces South-Eastern Europe (LANDSOUTHEAST) located in İzmir. He returned again to the TGS in 1998, this time as deputy chief. After a brief stint as the commander of the First Army in Istanbul, he was made commander of the Turkish Army in 2002, succeeding Hüseyin Kıvrıkoğlu. He served as chairman until his retirement on August 30, 2006.
The &quot;Chronicle&quot; said that during his tenure as the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, he opposed the plans of some of his peers who wanted to stage another coup d&#x27;etat and narrowly evaded assassination with a tip-off from the CIA on 3 February 2004. Major general Fehmi Büyükbayram of the Ankara central garrison changed Özkök&#x27;s schedule in order to protect him. Another attempt was allegedly prevented with a tip-off from the United Kingdom. Özkök recognized the allegations made in the &quot;Chronicle&quot;, but rejected some of the others, saying that the military would have taken the necessary precautions had they been true. In a 2007 interview Özkök said that he did not eat from the army canteen. People inferred that he feared poisoning, but Özkök replied that he merely wanted healthier food. A common complaint against him by his former colleagues has been that he often seems to avoid alcohol, as an admiral in Turkish navy wrote in his personal diary &quot;what we found in his (ozkok) glass turned out to be Coca-Cola while he was pretending to be drinking

<text>Cimolodonta is a clade of multituberculate mammals that lived from the Cretaceous to the Eocene. They probably lived something of a rodent-like existence until their ecological niche was assumed by true rodents. The more basal multituberculates are found in a different suborder, &quot;Plagiaulacida&quot;, a paraphyletic group containing all non cimolodontan multituberculates.

Cimolodonta is apparently a natural (monophyletic) suborder. Remains have been identified from across the Northern Hemisphere. They first appeared during the Aptian, and completely replaced the more primitive plagiaulacidans by the early Late Cretaceous. The taxon is recognized as the informal Paracimexomys group and the superfamilies Djadochtatherioidea, Taeniolabidoidea, and Ptilodontoidea. Additionally, and of uncertain affinities, are the families Cimolomyidae, Boffiidae, Eucosmodontidae, Kogaionidae, Microcosmodontidae and the two genera &quot;Uzbekbaatar&quot; and &quot;Viridomys&quot;. More precise placement of these types awaits further discoveries and analysis.

<text>Amr Moussa (, , Amr Muhammad Moussa; born 3 October 1936) is an Egyptian politician and diplomat who was the Secretary-General of the Arab League, a 22-member forum representing Arab states, from 1 June 2001 to 1 July 2011. Previously he served in the government of Egypt as Minister of Foreign Affairs from 1991 to 2001. On 8 September 2013, he was elected president of the committee of 50 that will amend the Egyptian constitution.

== Early life ==
He was born on 3 October 1936 in Cairo, Egypt, the son of former parliamentarian Muhammad Moussa. His father also had a son named Pierre during his studies in France in the 1920s. However, Moussa&#x27;s half-brother Pierre is a French citizen and has no ties to Egypt.

Moussa finished his education after earning a degree in law from Cairo University in 1957.

== Diplomatic career ==
Moussa then began his diplomatic career between 1958 and 1972 he worked in several missions, including Egypt&#x27;s Embassy in Switzerland and the Egyptian mission to the United Nations. From 1974 to 1977, he was an advisor to the Minister of Foreign Affairs. From 1977 to 1981 and again from 1983 to 1990, he was the Director of the Department of International Organizations at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. From 1981 to 1983, Moussa was the Deputy Permanent Representative to the United Nations in New York, then from 1983 to 1986 Ambassador to India. In 1990, he was promoted Permanent Representative of Egypt to the United Nations. He was named Minister of Foreign Affairs by Prime Minister Atef Sedki on 20 May 1991. He was minister until 15 May 2001 when he was elected as Secretary-General of the Arab League.

Moussa has been heavily involved with Egypt&#x27;s foreign policy since 1958. He was Egypt&#x27;s ambassador to the United Nations, India, and Switzerland for a total of 21 years. Moussa was among the many Arab and international diplomats who tried to resolve the Lebanese Civil War (1975–1990). After serving as Egypt&#x27;s Foreign Minister from 1991 to 2001, he served as the Secretary General of the Arab League. Moussa has been an extremely popular political figure in Egypt due to his criticism of Israeli policies towards Gaza and the West Bank. At the Forum for new diplomacy in February 2010, Moussa gave a speech in which he criticized the U.S. government&#x27;s double standard supporting Israel&#x27;s nuclear weapons policy but not allowing Iran to pursue nuclear energy. He also criticized Western countries, including the U.S., for not recognizing the results of the 2006 Palestinian election that brought Hamas into power. Like Mohamed El-Baradei and the Muslim Brotherhood, he supports opening the Gaza Strip/Egypt border. His criticisms have made Moussa extremely popular.

==Secretary-General of the Arab League==

On 15 May 2001, Moussa was selected as Secretary-General of the League of Arab States and took office on 1 June 2001. Critics of former-President Hosni Mubarak allege that Moussa&#x27;s appointment to the office of Secretary-General of the Arab League was motivated by Mubarak&#x27;s desire to remove him from the public spotlight, and so he would not compete as a candidate in the 2005 presidential elections.


On 2003, he became a member of the United Nations High Level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change for International Peace and Security.

On 2009, he signed a memorandum of understanding with the Holy See and met with Pope Benedict XVI in order to strengthen joint projects and to promote peace and dialogue on a cultural and political level.

On 13 June 2010, Moussa visited Gaza in a move to pressure Israel to lift its economic blockade over Hamas-ruled Gaza. The visit by Moussa was the first by an official of the Arab League since the election of Hamas in 2007. Immediately after the Gaza flotilla raid, Moussa said the Arab League would go to the UN Security Council to demand the blockade be lifted. On 15 May 2011, Nabil Elaraby was elected as Secretary-General of the Arab League and succeeded Moussa on 1 July 2011.

== Possible presidential candidacies ==

=== 2005 presidential election ===
In 2004, an online community gathered tens of thousands of signatures petitioning for Moussa to run in the 2005 elections, but there was no response. In a &quot;Doha Debate&quot; Forum televised by the BBC in 2006, Moussa was asked about his presidential hopes. Moussa merely replied that he hoped to continue the recent run of successes that have occurred under his leadership at the Arab League until the end of his term.

=== 2012 presidential election ===
When asked in October 2009 about rumours that he might run for the presidency in 2012, Moussa did not deny his intention to run for office or rule it out, leaving the door open to speculations. He argued that &quot;It&#x27;s the right of every citizen that has the capacity and efficiency to aspire to any political office that would allow him to contribute to the service of his nation&quot;. He further stated to the press that the qualities required to be the President of Egypt also apply to Gamal Mubarak, son of Hosni Mubarak. He also expressed appreciation &quot;for the confidence expressed by many people when they talk about his candidacy for the presidency and that the message reached him&quot;.

Moussa held talks with Mohamed El-Baradei after his return to Egypt. Many speculate that this meeting was held to discuss Constitutional reforms that will allow transparency in the election process as well as lifting restrictions on independent candidates. On 26 January 2011, at the Annual Horasis meeting in Zürich, Moussa shared strong views on the need for economic and political reforms in Egypt, and made it clear that he was considering a run.

On 1 February 2011, following the announcement by President Hosni Mubarak that he would not stand in the upcoming presidential elections, Moussa told CNN that he would seriously think about standing himself as a candidate in the next few weeks. On the 8 February broadcast of &quot;Al Jazeera&quot; English&#x27;s Empire, well-connected American journalist Seymour Hersh stated that Moussa was considered the U.S.&#x27;s favored &quot;Plan B&quot; should Mubarak resign, &quot;whether he knows it or not.&quot; On 11 February 2011, Al Jazeera English Online read from a Reuters report that stated Moussa was resigning from his position with the Arab League; on the day that President Mubarak resigned the presidency this furthered rumours he might make a strong bid for president when elections are announced in Egypt. On 12 February 2011, the Egyptian daily newspaper &quot;Alwafd&quot; reported that a group of Egyptian youth met with Moussa to discuss a possible nomination for the presidential election. Moussa reportedly agreed to the nomination, but stated that he would await the currently proposed constitutional reforms.

Amr Moussa announced that he would be running as a presidential candidate on 1 March 2011.

A poll conducted during the 2011 protests asking &quot;who do you think should be the next President of Egypt?&quot; showed Moussa in the lead, with 26% of respondents naming him.

Moussa placed fifth in the election with 11.13% of the first round vote. After the election, he formed the Conference Party with which a number of smaller opposition parties aligned.

== Criticisms ==
Although credited with shaking up the Arab League&#x27;s bureaucracy, Moussa has been criticized by former and current staff members of the Arab League for his management of the organization. In his book, &quot;The League of the Arab States: what’s left of it&quot;, former Arab League and Syrian diplomat Kawkab Najib El Rayess accused Moussa of favoritism and promoting his loyalists into the high ranks of the Arab League at the expense of the more-qualified diplomats.

<text>Arginbaatar is a genus of extinct mammal from the Lower Cretaceous of Mongolia. It was a member of the Multituberculata, an order which is also extinct. It belongs to the family Arginbaataridae (Hahn &amp; Hahn 1983). The genus &quot;Arginbaatar&quot; was named by Trofimov B.A. in 1980. &quot;Baatar&quot; is Mongolian for &quot;hero&quot; or &quot;warrior.&quot;

The primary species, &quot;Arginbaatar dmitrievae&quot;, was also named by Trofimov. The fossil remains date to the Aptian or Albian (Lower Cretaceous) Dzunbain Formation of Mongolia.

This genus is the only known member of its family, which is thus monotypic. Some characteristics are &quot;Plagiaulacida&quot;-like, while others are more akin to the further derived suborder of Cimolodonta. Exactly where it fits in is unclear. &quot;This family shows a mixture of &#x27;plagiaulacidan&#x27; and cimolodontan characters&quot; (Kielan-Jaworowska &amp; Hurum, 2001, p. 415).

<doc id="201997" wikidata="Q1502964" url="?curid=201997" title="International Police Association">
<text>The International Police Association (IPA) is a worldwide fraternal police organization. The IPA operates as a Non-Governmental Organization open to active duty or retired members of the police force.

== Mission ==
The IPA was founded in an effort to connect past and current members of law enforcement &quot;without distinction as to rank, position, gender, race, language or religion&quot; across cultures.

According to its website, the organization &quot;aims are to create and strengthen bonds of friendship between members of the police service, promote international cooperation in social, cultural and professional fields, encourage peaceful co-existence between peoples and preservation of world peace, improve the public image of the police service and enhance recognition of the IPA by international bodies.&quot;

==History==

=== Founding ===
The IPA was founded by Lincolnshire Police officer Arthur Troop in 1950. In 1949, Troop wrote an article published in the &quot;British Police Review&quot; under the pseudonym of Aytee. By January 1, 1950, the IPA was established with the Esperanto motto &quot;Servo per Amikeco,&quot; or &quot;Service Through Friendship.&quot; Troop became the first secretary general of the British section of the organization and later the first international secretary general. In 1966, he resigned from that role for unspecified personal reasons.

Troop and other organization leaders sought to expand to as many countries as possible. Within the course of several years, there were sections in the majority of Western Europe.

=== Expansion outside of Europe ===
On March 16, 1961 at the IPA&#x27;s organization-wide formal summit called the World Congress, the first sections outside of Europe were affiliated in Canada and Hong Kong. At the third World Congress held in Stuttgart, Germany, in September 1961, the first African IPA section was also affiliated in Kenya.

=== First female leader ===
In 1982, Phyllis Nolan of Ireland was elected to become the first woman to serve on the IPA&#x27;s executive board. She later became president of Section Ireland and international vice president.

=== International Administration Centre formed ===
In 1986, due to the growth of the organization, the leadership decided to hire a full-time staff. Until that point, administrative duties shifted from section to section. In 1987, a permanent centre was established in the United Kingdom at the headquarters building of Section UK.

By 2023, there were more than 372,000 members in nearly 100 countries, of which 65 are affiliated National Sections.

== Structure ==
The IPA adheres to the principles in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as adopted by the United Nations in 1948, and is in Consultative (Special) Status with the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations, and also is in Consultative Status with the Organization of American States and UNESCO.
=== International Executive Board ===
The International Executive Board (IEB) is responsible for the day-to-day management of the IPA. It&#x27;s made up of eight IPA members who are elected by the membership at the World Congress and they serve for a 4-year term.
=== Commissions ===
There are three commissions that report to the executive board:

* International Relations Commission: responsible for maintaining connections across different chapters and cultures
* Professional Commission: responsible for professional development, youth outreach, equal opportunities
* Socio-Cultural Commission: responsible for the development and promotion of social and cultural activities within the organization

== Outreach ==
=== Young Police Officers&#x27; Seminar (YPOS) ===
The Young Police Officers&#x27; Seminar is a training event for young IPA members from Law Enforcement Agencies, held every second year. Destinations have included New Zealand (2023), Sri Lanka (2022), the UK (2019), USA (2017), Poland (2015) and Australia (2013).

=== Arthur Troop Scholarships (ATS) ===
The ATS is awarded annually to 10 – 15 IPA members for professional education and advanced training, with the aim of aiding IPA members in their professional development in memory of the founder of the IPA. The ATS may be awarded to any IPA member active in a law enforcement role, but is predominantly targeted at our younger members.

=== International Learning and Development Exchange Program ===
The International Learning and Development Exchange Program (ILDEP) relates to an international exchange of IPA members pertaining to their professional working role and is placed under the responsibility of the Chairperson of the PC. The exchange has a focus on sharing knowledge, an exchange of ideas, practices, and policy.

=== International Education and Information Center ===
Gimborn Castle, in Germany, houses the IPA&#x27;s International Education and Conference Center, and is widely referred to as the Flagship of the Association. It is here where professional seminars, conferences and meetings are held in idyllic wooded mountainous surroundings, some 30 miles east of Cologne in the German State of North Rhine-Westphalia. IBZ Gimborn was founded on 25 October 1969  by a group led by Günter Kratz, Hans Jansen and Theo Leenders. They seized the opportunity to rent the castle from Baron von Fürstenberg. Conversion work was started on the main building and the defunct local primary school. Seminars initially were held in nearby Dürhölzen.

=== Travel Assistance ===
IPA Sections frequently arrange friendship weeks for members and their families to promote the culture and traditions of their countries, thus facilitating cross-border understanding. Many members participate in these events, while others travel on their own, with help from the sections they visit.

== IPA Houses ==
Many sections offer IPA members accommodation options: More than 40 IPA Houses are available, offering reasonably priced accommodation, plus the IPA has many other accommodation options available, including members’ holiday homes and discounts at hotels. IPA Houses and other accommodations are advertised in the IPA Hosting Book, with at present 264 hosting options.

== International Sports Events ==
Sports events and championships are arranged worldwide with numerous IPA members participating. The IPA Games is the latest contribution and is organized biennially. IPA Portugal hosted the IPA Games 2018. In 2022, Montenegro hosted the games.

== World Congress ==
The World Congress is an organization-wide summit to review the prior year and establish goals for the year ahead. It is hosted by a different national section every day, using lasting about a week. 

The event has been held since the organization&#x27;s founding. The World Congress has now been hosted in more than 31 countries in 65 years. In October 2023, the event was slated to be held in Athens, Greece.

<text>Ben Folds Five was an American alternative rock trio formed in 1993 in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. The group comprised Ben Folds (lead vocals, piano), Robert Sledge (bass guitar, backing vocals) and Darren Jessee (drums, backing vocals). The group achieved success in the alternative, indie and pop music scenes. Their single &quot;Brick&quot; from the second album, &quot;Whatever and Ever Amen&quot; (1997), gained airplay on many mainstream radio stations. 

During their first seven years, the band released three studio records, a compilation of B-sides and outtakes, and eight singles. They also contributed to a number of soundtracks and compilations. Ben Folds Five disbanded in October 2000, but reunited in 2011, and released their fourth album, &quot;The Sound of the Life of the Mind&quot;, in 2012, before disbanding again in 2013.

==History==
===1993–2000===
Ben Folds Five was formed in 1993 in Chapel Hill by Ben Folds. They were a trio in spite of their name, and the primary motivation behind the name, apart from the band&#x27;s well-known use of humor, was simple preference, according to Ben: &quot;I think it sounds better than Ben Folds Three.&quot; Folds once described their music as &quot;punk rock for sissies,&quot; a reaction to the angst prevalent in &#x27;90s rock.

Their first radio single was &quot;Underground&quot; from their self-titled debut album, released in 1995 on Caroline Records. The band&#x27;s biggest success was the single &quot;Brick&quot; from their second album, &quot;Whatever and Ever Amen,&quot; released in 1997. It was followed by the more somber and jazz-based 1999 album, &quot;The Unauthorized Biography of Reinhold Messner&quot;. The group contributed an outtake from the &quot;Reinhold Messner&quot; sessions, titled &quot;Leather Jacket&quot;, to the 1999 benefit album, &quot;No Boundaries: A Benefit for the Kosovar Refugees&quot;.

The band&#x27;s final released recording was a cover of Steely Dan&#x27;s &quot;Barrytown&quot; for the &quot;Me, Myself &amp; Irene&quot; soundtrack. The band had begun work on a fourth studio album, but following the worldwide tour in support of &quot;The Unauthorized Biography of Reinhold Messner&quot;, the band &quot;amicably&quot; broke up in October 2000. Tracks from the sessions later emerged in solo projects.

===After the break-up (2001–2011)===
Folds went on to pursue a successful solo career, releasing his debut album &quot;Rockin&#x27; the Suburbs&quot; in 2001, followed by &quot;Songs for Silverman&quot; in 2005, &quot;Way to Normal&quot; in 2008, and &quot;Lonely Avenue&quot; in collaboration with novelist Nick Hornby in 2010. He produced and arranged actor William Shatner&#x27;s second album &quot;Has Been&quot;, co-writing the majority of the songs with Shatner. Folds also contributed songs to the soundtracks for the animated movies &quot;Hoodwinked!&quot; and &quot;Over the Hedge&quot;, as well as forming the one-off side project The Bens (with Ben Lee and Ben Kweller) in 2003.

Jessee formed the indie band Hotel Lights in 2004, with his songs featured in television and film. Jessee released three studio albums for Bar/None Records in this time – including &quot;Hotel Lights&quot; in 2006, &quot;Firecracker People&quot; in 2008, and &quot;Girl Graffiti&quot; in 2011.

Sledge played with International Orange until the group disbanded in 2005. He later became the bass player in the three-piece Chapel Hill band Surrender Human, with Matt McMichaels from the Mayflies USA.

===Reunions (2008, 2011–2013, 2023)===
Ben Folds Five made a one-off concert appearance in September 2008 at the UNC Memorial Hall in Chapel Hill as part of the MySpace &quot;Front to Back&quot; series, in which artists play an entire album live. The band played its then-final album, &quot;The Unauthorized Biography of Reinhold Messner&quot;, and were briefly joined on stage by Ben&#x27;s father, Dean Folds, who read a transcript of his voice mail message that is used in the album song &quot;Your Most Valuable Possession&quot;, encoring with some of the songs from their first two albums&quot;.

In 2011, Ben Folds Five reunited to record three tracks for Ben Folds&#x27; &quot;The Best Imitation of Myself: A Retrospective&quot;. They made their first live appearance in four years as one of the headliners of the 2012 Mountain Jam festival. They made further appearances at that year&#x27;s 2012 Bonnaroo and Summerfest festivals.

The band&#x27;s fourth studio album, &quot;The Sound of the Life of the Mind&quot; was released in September 2012, supported by the single &quot;Do It Anyway&quot;, with a video featuring Anna Kendrick, Rob Corddry, and the cast of &quot;Fraggle Rock&quot;. A tour of the US, the UK, Australia and Ireland followed across the remainder of 2012. 

In June 2013, the trio released their first live album, titled &quot;Live&quot;. During that year Ben Folds Five toured with the Barenaked Ladies and Guster, before entering a hiatus that ultimately became permanent. Folds resumed his solo career, releasing the yMusic collaboration &quot;So There&quot; in 2015 and continuing to tour extensively. Jessee, meanwhile, released a new album with Hotel Lights in 2016, entitled &quot;Get Your Hand in My Hand&quot;, before releasing two solo albums: 2018&#x27;s &quot;The Jane, Room 217&quot; and 2020&#x27;s &quot;Remover&quot;.

Caleb Southern – the producer of the band&#x27;s first three albums and considered the &quot;fourth member&quot; of the band by Folds – died on July 6, 2023. The band briefly reunited for a concert in tribute to Southern on August 28, 2023, at the Cat&#x27;s Cradle in Chapel Hill, performing five songs.

<doc id="202008" wikidata="Q3906163" url="?curid=202008" title="Plagiaulacida">
<text>Plagiaulacida is a group of extinct multituberculate mammals. Multituberculates were among the most common mammals of the Mesozoic, &quot;the age of the dinosaurs&quot;. Plagiaulacids are a paraphyletic grouping, containing all multituberculates that lie outside of the advanced group Cimolodonta. They ranged from the Middle Jurassic Period to the early Late Cretaceous of the northern hemisphere. During the Cenomanian, they were replaced by the more advanced cimolodontans.

Kielan-Jaworowska and Hurum (2001) divides “Plagiaulacida” into three informal lineages, the paulchoffatiids, the plagiaulicids, and the allodontids.

== Allodontid line ==

The Allodontid line may be a superfamily, Allodontoidea.

Both allodontids and paulchoffatiids (below) were among the most basal of the plagiaulacids. The Allodontid line contains:

The family Allodontidae is known from two genera from the Upper Jurassic Morrison Formation of North America.

The family Zofiabaataridae contains a single genus, &quot;Zofiabaatar&quot; and is also from the Morrison Formation. The affinities of a further Morrison Formation genus, &quot;Glirodon&quot;, are unclear, but it&#x27;s also within the Allodontid line.

== Paulchoffatiid line ==

The Paulchoffatiid line may be a superfamily, Paulchoffatioidea.

Some remains from the Middle Jurassic of England might belong within this group. Representatives are best known from the Upper Jurassic, (especially from Guimarota, Portugal), though some were still extant during the Lower Cretaceous.

The genera of the family Paulchoffatiidae are divided into two of subfamilies, plus a couple of harder-to-place individuals:
*Subfamily Paulchoffatiinae includes &quot;Paulchoffatia&quot; and its relatives. This taxon contains nine genera.
*Subfamily Kuehneodontinae consists solely of the genus &quot;Kuehneodon&quot;, though there are half-a-dozen named species.

Other genera include &quot;Galveodon&quot; and &quot;Sunnyodon&quot;, both based on teeth from the Lower Cretaceous of Spain and England respectively.

Also referable to the paulchoffatiid line, but not the family itself, is the family Pinheirodontidae, which is known from Early Cretaceous teeth found in Iberia and England. As well as &quot;Rugosodon&quot; from the Middle-Late Jurassic of China.

== Plagiaulacid line (possibly Superfamily Plagiaulacoidea) ==

Family Plagiaulacidae is known from the Upper Jurassic (North America) to Lower Cretaceous (Europe), being represented by &quot;Plagiaulax&quot;, &quot;Bolodon&quot;, and &quot;Morrisonodon&quot;.

Family Albionbaataridae is known from the Upper Jurassic to Lower Cretaceous of Europe and Asia, (China – undescribed, 2001). These were shrew-sized Multituberculates, with some similarities to the paulchoffis.

Members of the family Eobaataridae display dental similarities with members of &quot;Paracimexomys&quot; group, (Cimolodonta). They are known from the Upper Jurassic to Lower Cretaceous of Europe and Asia.

&quot;Sinobaatar&quot; was described after the study by Kielan-Jaworowska and Hurum (2001). The Mongolian word ‘baatar’ is frequently employed in the nomenclature of Multituberculates. This reflects the fact that many of the most complete fossils have been recovered from sites in Mongolia, though this more applies to members of the more derived Cimolodonta.

A couple of further genera possibly fit somewhere within “Plagiaulacida”. This has been tentatively proposed for &quot;Janumys&quot; of the Middle Cretaceous. Its contemporary, &quot;Ameribaatar&quot;, is of uncertain affinities. Both were first described late in 2001.

<text>In the United Kingdom, a listed building is a structure of particular architectural or historic interest deserving of special protection. Such buildings are placed on one of the four statutory lists maintained by Historic England in England, Historic Environment Scotland in Scotland, in Wales, and the Historic Environment Division of the Department for Communities in Northern Ireland. The classification schemes differ between England and Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland (see sections below). The term has also been used in the Republic of Ireland, where buildings are protected under the Planning and Development Act 2000, although the statutory term in Ireland is &quot;protected structure&quot;.

A listed building may not be demolished, extended, or altered without permission from the local planning authority, which typically consults the relevant central government agency. In England and Wales, a national amenity society must be notified of any work to be done on a listed building which involves any element of demolition.

Exemption from secular listed building control is provided for some buildings in current use for worship, but only in cases where the relevant religious organisation operates its own equivalent permissions procedure. Owners of listed buildings are, in some circumstances, compelled to repair and maintain them and can face criminal prosecution if they fail to do so or if they perform unauthorised alterations. When alterations are permitted, or when listed buildings are repaired or maintained, the owners are often required to use specific materials or techniques.

Although most sites appearing on the lists are buildings, other structures such as bridges, monuments, sculptures, war memorials, milestones and mileposts, and the Abbey Road zebra crossing made famous by the Beatles, are also listed. Ancient, military, and uninhabited structures, such as Stonehenge, are sometimes instead classified as scheduled monuments and are protected by separate legislation. Cultural landscapes such as parks and gardens are currently &quot;listed&quot; on a non-statutory basis.

==Background==
Although a limited number of &#x27;ancient monuments&#x27; were given protection under the Ancient Monuments Protection Act 1882, there was reluctance to restrict the owners of occupied buildings in their actions related to their property. The extensive damage to buildings caused by German bombing during World War II prompted efforts to list and protect buildings that were deemed to be of particular architectural merit. Three hundred members of the Royal Institute of British Architects and the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings were dispatched to prepare the list under the supervision of the Inspectorate of Ancient Monuments, with funding from the Treasury. The listings were used as a means to determine whether a particular building should be rebuilt if it was damaged by bombing, with varying degrees of success. In Scotland, the process slightly predated the war with the Marquess of Bute (in his connections to the National Trust for Scotland) commissioning the architect Ian Lindsay in September 1936 to survey 103 towns and villages based on an Amsterdam model using three categories (A, B and C).

The basis of the current more comprehensive listing process was developed from the wartime system. It was enacted by a provision in the Town and Country Planning Act 1947 covering England and Wales, and the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1947 covering Scotland. Listing was first introduced into Northern Ireland under the Planning (Northern Ireland) Order 1972. The listing process has since developed slightly differently in each part of the UK.

===Heritage protection===
The process of protecting the built historic environment (i.e. getting a heritage asset legally protected) is called &#x27;designation&#x27;. Several different terms are used because the processes use separate legislation: buildings are &#x27;listed&#x27;; ancient monuments are &#x27;scheduled&#x27;, wrecks are &#x27;protected&#x27;, and battlefields, gardens and parks are &#x27;registered&#x27;. A heritage asset is a part of the historic environment that is valued because of its historic, archaeological, architectural or artistic interest.

Only some of these are judged to be important enough to have extra legal protection through designation. Buildings that are not formally listed but still judged as being of heritage interest can still be regarded as a material consideration in the planning process.

As a very rough guide, listed buildings are structures considered of special architectural and historical importance. Ancient monuments are of &#x27;national importance&#x27; containing evidential values, and can on many occasions also relate to below ground or unoccupied sites and buildings.

==Eligibility==
Almost anything can be listed. Buildings and structures of special historic interest come in a wide variety of forms and types, ranging from telephone boxes and road signs, to castles. Historic England has created twenty broad categories of structures, and published selection guides for each one to aid with assessing buildings and structures. These include historical overviews and describe the special considerations for listing each category. However, in 2020, the Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Dill v Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government and another&quot; that buildings in the scheme must meet certain criteria – &quot;a three-fold test which involved considering size, permanence and degree of physical attachment&quot; – referred to as the &quot;Skerritts&quot; test in reference to a previous legal case in England. Both Historic Environment Scotland and Cadw produce guidance for owners.

===Listing and delisting procedure===
In England, to have a building considered for listing or delisting, the process is to apply to the secretary of state; this can be done by submitting an application form online to Historic England. The applicant does not need to be the owner of the building to apply for it to be listed. Full information including application form guidance notes are on the Historic England website. Historic England assesses buildings put forward for listing or delisting and provides advice to the Secretary of State on the architectural and historic interest. The Secretary of State, who may seek additional advice from others, then decides whether to list or delist the building.

===Legislation===
====England====
In England, the authority for listing is granted to the Secretary of State by the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990. Listed buildings in danger of decay are listed on the Historic England &#x27;Heritage at Risk&#x27; Register.

In 1980, there was public outcry at the sudden destruction of the art deco Firestone Tyre Factory (Wallis, Gilbert and Partners, 1928–29). It was demolished over the August bank holiday weekend by its owners Trafalgar House, who had been told that it was likely to be &#x27;spot-listed&#x27; a few days later. In response, the government undertook to review arrangements for listing buildings in order to protect worthy ones from such demolition. After the Firestone demolition, the Secretary of State for the Environment, Michael Heseltine, also initiated a complete re-survey of buildings to ensure that everything that merited preservation was on the lists.

In England, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) works with Historic England (an agency of the DCMS), and other government departments, e.g. Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) to deliver the government policy on the protection to historic buildings and other heritage assets. The decision about whether or not to list a building is made by the Secretary of State, although the process is administered in England by Historic England.

====Wales====
The listed building system in Wales formerly also operated under the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, as in England, until this was replaced in 2024 with Wales-specific heritage legislation.

In Wales, the authority for listing is granted to the Welsh Ministers by section 76 of the Historic Environment (Wales) Act 2023, although the listing system is in practice administered by Cadw.

===English heritage protection reform===
There have been several attempts to simplify the heritage planning process for listed buildings in England. As of 2021, few changes had been implemented.

The review process was started in February 2000 by Alan Howarth, then minister at the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS). The outcome was the paper &quot;Power of Place&quot; in December 2000, followed by the subsequent policy document &quot;The Historic Environment: A Force for Our Future&quot;, published by the DCMS and the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions (DTLR) in December 2001. The launch of the Government&#x27;s Heritage Protection Reform (HPR) report in July 2003 by the DCMS, entitled &quot;Protecting our historic environment: Making the system work better&quot;, asked questions about how the current designation systems could be improved. The HPR decision report &quot;Review of Heritage Protection: The Way Forward&quot;, a green paper published in June 2004 by the DCMS, committed the UK government and English Heritage to a process of reform, including a review of the criteria used for listing buildings.

A Review of Heritage Policy in 2006 was criticised, and the Government began a process of consultation on changes to Planning Policy Guidance 15, relating to the principles of selection for listing buildings in England.

The government&#x27;s White Paper &quot;Heritage Protection for the 21st Century&quot;, published on 8 March 2007, offered a commitment to sharing the understanding of the historic environment and more openness in the process of designation.

In 2008, a draft Heritage Protection Bill was subject to pre-legislative scrutiny before its passage through UK Parliament. The legislation was abandoned despite strong cross-party support, to make room in the parliamentary legislative programme for measures to deal with the credit crunch, though it may be revived in future. The proposal was that the existing registers of buildings, parks and gardens, archaeology and battlefields, maritime wrecks, and World Heritage Sites be merged into a single online register that will &quot;explain what is special and why&quot;. English Heritage would become directly responsible for identifying historic assets in England and there would be wider consultation with the public and asset owners, and new rights of appeal. There would have been streamlined systems for granting consent for work on historic assets.

After several years of consultation with heritage groups, charities, local planning authorities, and English Heritage, in March 2010, the DCLG published Planning Policy Statement 5, &quot;Planning for the Historic Environment&quot;. This replaced PPG15 and set out the government&#x27;s national policies on the conservation of the historic environment in England. PPS5 was supported by a Practice Guide, endorsed by the DCLG, the DCMS, and English Heritage, which explained how to apply the policies stated in PPS5.

In December 2010, the Department for Communities and Local Government announced that in England all PPSs and Planning Policy Guidance Notes would be replaced by a single document, the National Planning Policy Framework. A consultation draft of this was published on 25 July 2011 and the final version on 27 March 2012. This became a material consideration in planning matters on publication. It has since been revised in 2018, 2019 and 2021.

=== Categories ===
The Historic Buildings and Monuments Commission in England and Cadw in Wales list buildings under three grades, with Grade I being the highest grade, as follows:
* Grade I: buildings that are of exceptional interest
* Grade II*: particularly important buildings of more than special interest
* Grade II: buildings that are of special interest

There was formerly a non-statutory Grade III, which was abolished in 1970. Additionally, Grades A, B and C were used mainly for Anglican churches in active use, loosely corresponding to Grades I, II and III. These grades were used mainly before 1977, although a few buildings are still listed using these grades.

In 2010, listed buildings accounted for about 2% of English building stock. In March 2010, there were about 374,000 list entries, of which 92% were Grade II, 5.5% were Grade II* and 2.5% were Grade I. Places of worship are an important part of the UK&#x27;s architectural heritage; England alone has 14,500 listed places of worship (4,000 Grade I, 4,500 Grade II* and 6,000 Grade II) and 45% of all Grade I listed buildings are places of worship. Some of the listed churches are no longer in use; between 1969 and 2010, some 1,795 churches were closed by the Church of England, equalling roughly 11% of the stock, with about a third listed as Grade I or Grade II.

===Statutory criteria===

The criteria for listing include architectural interest, historic interest and close historical associations with significant people or events. Buildings not individually noteworthy may still be listed if they form part of a group that is—for example, all the buildings in a square. This is called &#x27;group value&#x27;. Sometimes large areas comprising many buildings may not justify listing but receive the looser protection of designation as a conservation area.

The specific criteria include:
* Age and rarity: The older a building is, the more likely it is to be listed. All buildings erected before 1700 that &quot;contain a significant proportion of their original fabric&quot; will be listed. Most buildings built between 1700 and 1840 are listed. After 1840 more selection is exercised and &quot;particularly careful selection&quot; is applied after 1945. Buildings less than 30 years old are rarely listed unless they are of outstanding quality and under threat.
* Aesthetic merits: i.e. the appearance of a building. However, buildings that have little visual appeal may be listed on grounds of representing particular aspects of social or economic history.
* Selectivity: where a large number of buildings of a similar type survive, the policy is only to list the most representative or significant examples.
* National interest: significant or distinctive regional buildings; e.g. those that represent a nationally important but localised industry.
The state of repair of a building is &quot;not&quot; generally deemed to be a relevant consideration for listing.

Additionally:
* Any buildings or structures constructed before 1 July 1948 that fall within the curtilage of a listed building are treated as part of the listed building.
* The effect of a proposed development on the setting of a listed building is a material consideration in determining a planning application. Setting is defined as &quot;the surroundings in which a heritage is experienced&quot;.

Although the decision to list a building may be made on the basis of the architectural or historic interest of one small part of the building, the listing protection nevertheless applies to the whole building. Listing applies not just to the exterior fabric of the building itself, but also to the interior, fixtures, fittings, and objects within the curtilage of the building even if they are not fixed. De-listing is possible but is rare. One example is Anmer Hall in Norfolk, which was listed in 1984 and de-listed in 1988.

===Emergency measure===
In an emergency, the local planning authority can serve a temporary &quot;Building Preservation Notice&quot; (BPN), if a building is in danger of demolition or alteration in such a way that might affect its historic character. This remains in force for six months until the Secretary of State decides whether or not to formally list the building.

===Certificates of immunity===
Until the passing of the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Act 2013 an application for a Certificate of Immunity from Listing (CoI) could only be made if planning permission was being sought or had been obtained in England. However, the changes brought about by the Act means that now anyone can ask the Secretary of State to issue a Certificate of Immunity in respect of a particular building at any time.

===Alteration===
In England and Wales, the management of listed buildings is the responsibility of local planning authorities and the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (i.e., not DCMS, which originally listed the building). There is a general principle that listed buildings are put to &#x27;appropriate and viable use&#x27; and recognition that this may involve the re-use and modification of the building. However, listed buildings cannot be modified without first obtaining Listed Building Consent through the relevant local planning authority.

In Wales, applications are made using a form obtained from the relevant local authority. There is no provision for consent to be granted in outline. When a local authority is disposed to grant listed building consent, it must first notify the Welsh Parliament (&quot;i.e.&quot; Cadw) of the application. If the planning authority decides to refuse consent, it may do so without any reference to Cadw.

Carrying out unauthorised works to a listed building is a criminal offence and owners can be prosecuted. A planning authority can also insist that all work undertaken without consent be reversed at the owner&#x27;s expense.

===Mixed designations===
It is not unusual for historic sites, particularly large sites, to contain buildings with multiple, sometimes varying, designations. For example, Derwent Valley Mills, a World Heritage Site contains 838 listed buildings, made up of 16 listed at Grade I, 42 at Grade II* and 780 at Grade II. A further nine structures are Scheduled monuments.

===Locally listed buildings===
Many councils, for example, Birmingham City Council and Crawley Borough Council, maintain a list of non-designated heritage assets (known informally as locally listed buildings) as separate to the statutory list (and in addition to it). There is no statutory protection of a building or object on the local heritage list but the National Planning Policy Framework states that &quot;the effect of an 
application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be 
taken into account&quot;. Many also receive a degree of protection from loss through being in a Conservation Area or through planning policy.

==Northern Ireland==
Listing began later in Northern Ireland than in the rest of the UK: the first provision for listing was contained in the Planning (Northern Ireland) Order 1972; and the current legislative basis for listing is the Planning (Northern Ireland) Order 1991. Under Article 42 of the Order, the relevant Department of the Northern Ireland Executive is required to compile lists of buildings of &quot;special architectural or historic interest&quot;. Since 2016, the responsibility for the listing process rests with the Historic Environment Division of the Department for Communities, which took over the built heritage functions of the Northern Ireland Environment Agency (formerly the Environment and Heritage Service) following the break up of the Department of the Environment.

Following the introduction of listing, an initial survey of Northern Ireland&#x27;s building stock was begun in 1974. By the time of the completion of this First Survey in 1994, the listing process had developed considerably, and it was therefore decided to embark upon a Second Survey, which is still ongoing, to update and cross-check the original information. Information gathered during this survey, relating to both listed and unlisted buildings, is entered into the publicly accessible Northern Ireland Buildings Database.

A range of listing criteria, which aim to define architectural and historic interest, are used to determine whether or not to list a building. Listed building consent must be obtained from local authorities before any alteration to a listed structure. There are about 8,500 listed buildings in Northern Ireland, divided into four grades, defined as follows:
* Grade A: &quot;buildings of greatest importance to Northern Ireland including both outstanding architectural set-pieces and the least altered examples of each representative style, period and type.&quot;
* Grade B+: &quot;high quality buildings that because of exceptional features, interiors or environmental qualities are clearly above the general standard set by grade B1 buildings. Also buildings which might have merited Grade A status but for detracting features such as an incomplete design, lower quality additions or alterations.&quot;
* Grade B1: &quot;good examples of a particular period or style. A degree of alteration or imperfection of design may be acceptable. Generally B1 is chosen for buildings that qualify for listing by virtue of a relatively wide selection of attributes. Usually these will include interior features or where one or more features are of exceptional quality and/or interest.&quot;
* Grade B2: &quot;special buildings which meet the test of the legislation. A degree of alteration or imperfection of design may be acceptable. B2 is chosen for buildings that qualify for listing by virtue of only a few attributes. An example would be a building sited within a conservation area where the quality of its architectural appearance or interior raises it appreciably above the general standard of buildings within the conservation area.&quot;

==Scotland==
In Scotland, listing was begun by a provision in the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1947, and the current legislative basis for listing is the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) (Scotland) Act 1997. As with other matters regarding planning, conservation is a power devolved to the Scottish Parliament and the Scottish Government. The authority for listing rests with Historic Environment Scotland (formerly Historic Scotland), an executive agency of the Scottish Government, which inherited this role from the Scottish Development Department in 1991. The listing system is administered by Historic Environment Scotland on behalf of the Scottish Ministers. 

Listed building consent must be obtained from local authorities before any alteration to a listed structure. Applications for consent are made on a form obtained from Historic Environment Scotland. After consulting the local planning authority, the owner, where possible, and an independent third party, Historic Environment Scotland makes a recommendation on behalf of the Scottish Ministers.

The scheme for classifying buildings is:
* Category A: &quot;Buildings of special architectural or historic interest which are outstanding examples of a particular period, style or building type.&quot;
* Category B: &quot;Buildings of special architectural or historic interest which are major examples of a particular period, style or building type.&quot;
* Category C: &quot;Buildings of special architectural or historic interest which are representative examples of a period, style or building type.&quot;

There are about 47,400 listed buildings in Scotland. Of these, around 8 percent (some 3,800) are Category A, 50 percent are Category B, and 42 percent are listed at Category C.
===Examples of Category A listed buildings===

*St Peter&#x27;s Seminary, Cardross
* Palace of Holyroodhouse, Edinburgh
* Ravelston Garden, Edinburgh
* 1 Prince&#x27;s Terrace, Glasgow
* Glasgow Cathedral, Glasgow
* Glasgow City Chambers, Glasgow
* Craigellachie Bridge, Moray
* The Kirna, Walkerburn

===Examples of Category B listed buildings===
*Balmoral Hotel, Edinburgh
*Harbourmaster&#x27;s House, Dysart, Fife
*Perth Theatre, Perth
*Sabhal Mòr Ostaig, Isle of Skye
*Torloisk House, Isle of Mull

*St John&#x27;s Cathedral, Oban, Argyll
*Craigend Castle, East Dunbartonshire
*The George Cinema, Portobello, Edinburgh

==Records==
===England===
Although the 2008 draft legislation was abandoned, Historic England (then part of English Heritage) published a single list of all designated heritage assets within England in 2011. The National Heritage List for England is an online searchable database which includes 400,000 English Listings, this includes individual listed buildings, groups of multiple listed buildings which share the same listing, scheduled monuments, registered parks and gardens, protected historic wrecks and registered battlefields and World Heritage Sites in one place. The 400,000 in the listing should not be confused with the actual number of listed buildings, which will be much larger than the listing, because a listing can include more than one building that share the same listing number. The legislative frameworks for each type of historic asset remains unchanged. A photographic library of English listed buildings was started in 1999 as a snapshot of buildings listed at the turn of the millennium. This is not an up-to-date record of all listed buildings in England – the listing status and descriptions are only correct as at February 2001. The photographs were taken between 1999 and 2008. It is maintained by the Historic England archive at the Images of England project website. The National Heritage List for England contains the up-to-date list of listed buildings.

Listed buildings in danger of being lost through damage or decay in England started to be recorded by survey in 1991. This was extended in 1998 with the publication of Historic England&#x27;s Buildings at Risk Register which surveyed Grade I and Grade II* buildings. In 2008 this survey was renamed Heritage at Risk and extended to include all listed buildings, scheduled monuments, registered parks and gardens, registered battlefields, protected wreck sites and conservation areas. The register is compiled by survey using information from local authorities, official and voluntary heritage groups and the general public. It is possible to search this list online.

===Scotland===
In Scotland, the national dataset of listed buildings and other heritage assets can be searched online via Historic Environment Scotland, or through the map database Pastmap. A Buildings at Risk Register for Scotland was started in 1990 by Historic Scotland in response to similar concerns at the number of listed buildings that were vacant and in disrepair. RCAHMS maintained the register on behalf of Historic Scotland, and provided information on properties of architectural or historic merit throughout the country that are considered to be at risk. Since the merger of these two bodies into one, that work is now carried out by Historic Environment Scotland.

===Wales===
Cadw publishes and maintains a searchable map database for listed buildings in Wales. In Wales, at risk registers of listed buildings are compiled by local planning authorities, and Cadw produced a report in 2009. The Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales&#x27; (RCAHMW) Emergency Buildings Recording team is responsible for surveying historic buildings threatened with destruction, substantial alteration, or serious decay.

===Northern Ireland===
The Northern Ireland Buildings Database contains details of all listed buildings in Northern Ireland.

===Other===
British Listed Buildings Online (website) has sections on England, Wales and Scotland. It can be searched either by browsing for listed buildings by country, county and parish/locality, or by keyword search or via the online map. Not all buildings have photographs, as it is run on a volunteer basis.

<text>The Reform Club is a private members&#x27; club, owned and controlled by its members, on the south side of Pall Mall in central London, England. As with all of London&#x27;s original gentlemen&#x27;s clubs, it had an all-male membership for decades, but it was one of the first all-male clubs to change its rules to include the admission of women on equal terms in 1981. Since its foundation in 1836, the Reform Club has been the traditional home for those committed to progressive political ideas, with its membership initially consisting of Radicals and Whigs. However, it is no longer associated with any particular political party, and it now serves a purely social function.

The Reform Club currently enjoys extensive reciprocity with similar clubs around the world. It attracts a significant number of foreign members, such as diplomats accredited to the Court of St James&#x27;s. Of the current membership of around 2,700, some 500 are &quot;overseas members&quot;, and over 400 are women.

==History==

===19th century===
The club was founded by Edward Ellice, Member of Parliament (MP) for Coventry and Whig Whip, whose riches came from the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, but whose zeal was chiefly devoted to securing the passage of the Reform Act 1832. The club held its first meeting at No. 104 Pall Mall on 5 May 1836.

This new club, for members of both Houses of Parliament, was intended to be a forum for the radical ideas which the First Reform Bill represented: its purpose was to promote &quot;the social intercourse of the reformer of the United Kingdom&quot;.

The Reform Club&#x27;s building was designed by renowned architect Sir Charles Barry and contracted to builders Grissell &amp; Peto. The new club was built on palatial lines, the design being based on the Palazzo Farnese in Rome, and its Saloon in particular is regarded as the finest of all London&#x27;s clubs. It was officially opened on 1 March 1841. Facilities provided included a library which, following extensive donations from members, grew to contain over 85,000 books.

===20th century===
After the Second World War and with the old Liberal Party&#x27;s further decline, the club increasingly drew its membership from civil servants. The club continued to attract a comprehensive list of guest speakers including Government Ministers Nick Clegg and Theresa May (2011), Archbishop John Sentamu (2012), and Ambassador Liu Xiaoming (2013).

==Literary associations==
Besides having had many distinguished members from the literary world, including William Makepeace Thackeray and Arnold Bennett, the Reform played a role in some significant events, such as the feud between Oscar Wilde&#x27;s friend and literary executor Robbie Ross and Wilde&#x27;s ex-lover Lord Alfred Douglas. In 1913, after discovering that Lord Alfred had taken lodgings in the same house as himself with a view to stealing his papers, Ross sought refuge at the club, from where he wrote to Edmund Gosse, saying that he felt obliged to return to his rooms &quot;with firearms&quot;.

Harold Owen, the brother of Wilfred Owen, called on Siegfried Sassoon at the Reform after Wilfred&#x27;s death. Sassoon wrote a poem entitled &quot;Lines Written at the Reform Club&quot;, which was printed for members at Christmas 1920.

==Appearances in popular culture and literature==
===Books===
The Reform Club appears in Anthony Trollope&#x27;s 1867 novel &quot;Phineas Finn&quot;. This eponymous main character becomes a member of the club and there acquaints Liberal members of the House of Commons, who arrange to get him elected to an Irish parliamentary borough. The book is one of the political novels in the Palliser series. The political events it describes are a fictionalized account of the build-up to the Second Reform Act, passed in 1867, which effectively extended the franchise to the working classes.

The club appears in Jules Verne&#x27;s &quot;Around the World in Eighty Days&quot;, published in 1872, as a novel in 1873. The protagonist, Phileas Fogg, is a member of the Reform Club. He sets out to circumnavigate the world on a bet from his fellow members, beginning and ending at the club.

The Reform Club was used as a meeting place for MI6 operatives in Part 3, Chapter 1, p. 83ff of Graham Greene&#x27;s spy novel &quot;The Human Factor&quot; (1978, Avon Books, ).

The Reform Club and its Victorian era celebrity chef Alexis Soyer play pivotal roles in MJ Carter&#x27;s mystery novel &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Feast&quot; (2016, Fig Tree, ).

===Films and television===
Comedian and travel writer Michael Palin began and ended his televised 1989 journey around the world in 80 days at the Reform Club, following his fictional predecessor. Palin was not permitted to enter the building to complete his journey, as had been his intention, so his trip ended on the steps outside. Palin later explained that he had been refused entry not because he was not wearing a tie but because the club claimed it would &#x27;disturb the members&#x27;.

Victorian publisher Norman Warne is depicted visiting the Reform Club in the 2006 film &quot;Miss Potter&quot;. The club has been used as a location in a number of other films, including the fencing scene in the 2002 James Bond movie &quot;Die Another Day&quot;, &quot;The Quiller Memorandum&quot; (1966), &quot;The Man Who Haunted Himself&quot; (1970), Lindsay Anderson&#x27;s &quot;O Lucky Man!&quot; (1973), &quot;The Avengers&quot; (1998), &quot;Nicholas Nickleby&quot; (2002), &quot;1408&quot; (2007), &quot;Quantum of Solace&quot; (2008), &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; (2009), &quot;Paddington&quot; (2014), and Christopher Nolan&#x27;s &quot;Tenet&quot; (2020).

The club was used in Chris Van Dusen&#x27;s television series &quot;Bridgerton&quot; as a filming location.

===Photoshoot===
The Reform Club was the location of a photo shoot featuring Paula Yates for the 1979 summer issue of &quot;Penthouse&quot;.

===Podcasts===
In &quot;The Magnus Archives&quot;, the Reform Club was the possible location of Jurgen Leitner&#x27;s library, and had secret underground tunnels.

A citizen of both Ireland and the United Kingdom, he was knighted as a Knight Bachelor for his services to Northern Ireland.

As a rugby player, he represented Ireland, the British and Irish Lions and the Barbarians and is enshrined as a member of the International Rugby Board&#x27;s Hall of Fame. In business, he was noted for multiple successful roles, and became a billionaire, but by 2014, was being pursued in the Irish courts for debts amounting to €22 million by AIB, following losses amounting to hundreds of millions of euros in his unsuccessful attempt to save the Waterford Wedgwood group and to stop Denis O&#x27;Brien from assuming control of Independent News &amp; Media.

O&#x27;Reilly had six children from his first marriage, and 23 grandchildren, and was later married to Greek shipping heiress Chryss Goulandris, who died in 2023. He lived in Lyford Cay in the Bahamas until 2017, when the property was sold for less than €12 million as part of a bankruptcy arrangement. O&#x27;Reilly later lived in Château des Ducs de Normandie in Bonneville-sur-Touques in France and in County Kildare, Ireland. He died, after a short illness, at a hospital in Dublin on 18 May 2024, at the age of 88.

==Early years==

===Background===

O&#x27;Reilly was born in Dublin and was the only child of a civil servant, John O&#x27;Reilly (1906–1976), and Aileen O&#x27;Connor (1914–1989). O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s Drogheda-born father, eventually an inspector-general of customs, was born &quot;Reilly&quot; and added the &quot;O&quot;&#x27; when he applied to join the Irish Civil Service. Previously married with four older children, but estranged from his first wife, John O&#x27;Reilly married Aileen O&#x27;Connor in 1973, after the death of his first wife and only a little time after he had told his son of his other family. O&#x27;Reilly had been told about the situation by a Jesuit when he was 15, but kept it secret. He arranged for the John and Aileen O&#x27;Reilly Library at Dublin City University to be named after his parents, and O&#x27;Reilly Hall at University College Dublin to be named after his father, who had studied there.

O&#x27;Reilly, named &quot;Tony&quot; after his mother&#x27;s favourite brother, grew up on Griffith Avenue, a broad middle-class street in the Drumcondra/Glasnevin area of Dublin. He had prominent red hair. He holidayed with family, including an aunt in Balbriggan, cousins in Sligo and others in Drogheda. In 1951, the family moved to a bungalow in Santry.

===Education===

Educated at Belvedere College from the age of six, O&#x27;Reilly participated in several sports, including soccer, cricket, tennis, and rugby union. As a youth, he played soccer for Home Farm. In cricket he was a member of the Junior Cup-winning team in 1950; in tennis, he was in a Leinster Schools Cup-winning team and reached the under-15 national semi-finals. He was also noted for his acting skills (and participated in Gilbert and Sullivan operettas such as &quot;Iolanthe&quot;, and Dunsany&#x27;s &quot;A Night at an Inn&quot;). He was an altar boy, and a regular attendee at chapel, and during his time there spent a summer in the Gaeltacht to improve his Irish language skills. He passed the Leaving Certificate at 17, and with four schoolmates, studied philosophy, still at Belvedere, for a year after this, while developing his rugby. He was a prefect for his last two years at the school, and a senior member of a key sodality.

O&#x27;Reilly went on to study law at University College Dublin and then at the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland. He came fifth in Ireland in intermediate exams in 1956, and first and third in the country in final examinations in 1958, and was enrolled as a solicitor in November 1958. He never practised after training, but later became chairman of the major Dublin solicitors&#x27; firm now known as Matheson.

O&#x27;Reilly earned a PhD in agricultural marketing from the University of Bradford, and in addition, held at least one honorary doctorate.

==Rugby Union career==

===Ireland===

Between 1955 and 1970 O&#x27;Reilly won 29 caps for Ireland. His Five Nations career of 15 years, 23 days is the longest in history, a record shared with fellow Ireland player Mike Gibson. He made his senior international debut, aged just 18, against France on 22 January 1955. He scored his four tries for Ireland against France on 28 January 1956; against Scotland on 25 February 1956; against Wales in 1959; and against France in 1963. He made his final appearance for Ireland on 14 February 1970, after a six-year absence from the national team, against England. This final appearance was an 11th-hour replacement, denying Frank O&#x27;Driscoll—father of Brian, Ireland&#x27;s most-capped player—what would prove to be his only chance at a Test cap.

===British and Irish Lions===

O&#x27;Reilly toured twice with the British Lions, on their 1955 tour to South Africa and their 1959 tour to Australia and New Zealand. He made his debut for the Lions on 26 June 1955, scoring two tries against a Northern Universities XV. He played 15 games during the 1955 tour, scoring 16 tries. This included hat-tricks against a North Eastern Districts XV on 20 July and Transvaal on 23 July. He also played in all four Tests against South Africa, making his Test debut on the right wing before a crowd of 95,000 at Ellis Park on 6 August. He scored a try in the Lions 23–22 victory. He scored another try in the fourth Test on 24 September.

On the 1959 tour, he played a further 23 games and scored 22 tries. This included a hat-trick against King Country/Counties on 19 August. He played in all six tests, two against Australia and four against New Zealand. He scored tries in the two test wins against Australia and in the first and fourth tests against New Zealand. His total of 38 tries for the Lions on two tours remains a record.

===Barbarians===

Between 1955 and 1963, O&#x27;Reilly also made 30 appearances and scored 38 tries for the Barbarians. He made his debut on 9 April 1955 in a 6–3 win against Cardiff, and his final appearance against Swansea on 15 April 1963. On the Barbarians&#x27; 1958 tour of South Africa, O&#x27;Reilly scored 12 tries, seven of them in the game against East Africa. He remains the Barbarians record holder for both appearances and tries.

===Later rugby involvement===

O&#x27;Reilly was a member of the IRFU Commercial Committee. He was in the first class of inductees into the International Rugby Hall of Fame in 1997, and was inducted into the IRB Hall of Fame in 2009.

==Business career==

O&#x27;Reilly went from college to work as a management consultant for Weston-Evans in Ashby-de-la-Zouch, Leicestershire; he earned £200 annually, which was a very good salary by the then Irish standards. While there, he continued his rugby career, with Leicester. His work included cost accounting and time-and-motion studies, in industries ranging from shoe-making to pottery.

He then moved to Sutton&#x27;s of Cork, selling agricultural products, coal and oil.

===Irish semi-state sector===

O&#x27;Reilly joined &quot;An Bord Bainne&quot;, the Irish Dairy Board, in 1962, as General Manager, and developed the successful Kerrygold &quot;umbrella brand&quot; for Irish export butter. In 1966 he became Managing Director of the Irish Sugar Company. He soon developed a joint venture for freeze-drying food with the H. J. Heinz Co.

===Heinz===

In 1969, after discussions with the then Taoiseach Jack Lynch, who offered him a post such as Minister for Agriculture if he would stay, O&#x27;Reilly joined Heinz. There he made his name in international business, becoming managing director of the Heinz subsidiary in the UK, its largest non-US holding and the source of half of the group&#x27;s profit.

He moved to the company HQ in Pittsburgh in 1971 when he was promoted to senior vice-president for the North America and Pacific region. In 1973, R. Burt Gookin and Jack Heinz made him COO and President. He became CEO in 1979 when Mr. Gookin, then vice-chairman and chief executive officer, retired.

He became chairman of Heinz in 1987, succeeding HJ Heinz II, and becoming the first non-Heinz family member to hold that post. His guidance was seen as having helped transform the company into a major international competitor, its value increasing twelvefold (from $908 million to $11 billion). O&#x27;Reilly left Heinz in 1998 after several years during which analysts questioned the company&#x27;s performance, and after challenges from corporate governance groups and major pension funds including CalPERS and Business Week magazine; he was succeeded by his deputy, William R. Johnson.

===Other business interests===

During his time at Heinz, O&#x27;Reilly held roles as a major shareholder and chairman of several companies, including Waterford Wedgwood (1995–2009) and Independent News &amp; Media, and of a major partnership of solicitors, Matheson, in Dublin. Provision for him to do this was written into his contract before he went to the United States. After he left Heinz, he focused on three of these: Independent News &amp; Media; Waterford Wedgwood; and Fitzwilton; and later, for a brief time, Eircom. He was the main shareholder in Arcon, the Irish base-metal mining company that developed the Galmoy lead-zinc deposit, the company being co-founded with Richard Conroy, and later sold to Lundin Mining in 2005. He also retained a 40% stake in Providence Resources Plc, the Irish-based oil and gas exploration and development company.

===Independent News &amp; Media===

O&#x27;Reilly bought into Independent News &amp; Media (INM), a Dublin-based print media company, in 1973, and at peak, held over 28% of its shares, with leverage over more than 29.5% with family and other connected parties. He pushed the company to expand into other national markets and to increase its reach in Ireland. In the 1990s INM bought into South Africa (from 1994), Australia (from 1988) and New Zealand (from 1995), acquiring 38 newspaper titles, over 70 radio stations, cable and telecoms interests at a cost of around €1.3 billion. In the United Kingdom, INM took control of the national broadsheet &quot;The Independent&quot; in 1995, edging out MGN and Prisa. The company had over 200 national and regional newspaper and magazine titles in total, revenues of €1.7 billion and profits of €110.7 million, and assets of around €4.7 billion as well as debts in the region of €1.3 billion.

On Friday 13 March 2009, it was announced that on O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s 73rd birthday, 7 May, he would resign as both CEO and a member of the board of INM, to be succeeded by his son, Gavin. Further, the often-criticised large size of the board would be reduced from 17 to 10 and would include three nominees of Denis O&#x27;Brien. These announcements were actioned, and O&#x27;Reilly became President Emeritus of the group. The markets reacted positively to the news, especially to the explicit truce between the O&#x27;Reilly and O&#x27;Brien shareholder blocs, with Denis O&#x27;Brien voicing public support for Gavin O&#x27;Reilly as CEO-designate. The O&#x27;Reilly shareholding was diluted sharply from 2009.

===Interests beyond INM===

Among other investments, O&#x27;Reilly had at various times interests in:
* Fitzwilton, an industrial holding and investment company established with friends (Ferguson and Leonard) in the early 1970s. Over the years, the company was involved in numerous business activities including textiles, house construction, fertiliser manufacturing, bottling, oil and gas investments, supermarkets and light manufacturing. Taken private in the late 1990s in conjunction with his brother-in-law, the company was later involved in light manufacturing, property investments, financial services and architectural signage.
* Waterford Wedgwood Plc, the majority of which was placed in administration on 5 January 2009, and of which he was chairman until that date
* Providence Resources Plc, an Irish-based oil and gas exploration and production company, in which he held a stake of at least 40%. The company has interests in Ireland, the UK, the US and Nigeria.
* Landis+Gyr, one of the world&#x27;s largest smart metering companies, in which he held a 7% stake prior to its sale to Toshiba

===Lockwood and E-mat===

In 1996, in conjunction with his brother-in-law Petros Goulandris, he along with CEO Leonard Reinhart backed a management team that created Lockwood Financial Partners, which was named after friend Jim Lockwood who was a colleague and fee-based pioneer, and its sister company E-MAT (EMAT) which was founded by Leonard Reinhart and Jay N. Whipple to provide the first common operating program for separately managed accounts (SMAs). EMAT and the wealth management firm Lockwood, which was originally formed as Lockwood Advisors in 1995, based in Malvern, Pennsylvania, specialised in providing independent financial investment advisory services to brokers of high-net-worth individuals, and went on to become one of the largest independent advisory companies in the United States before both firms were sold to the Bank of New York (BoNY) in 2002, while Gerald L Hassell was president of BoNY, that folded Lockwood and Pershing LLC into the BNY Securities Group under the Pershing umbrella in October 2003 with Joseph M. Velli heading the BoNY Securities Group which would allow BoNY to compete against U.S. Trust, J.P. Morgan Chase, as well as those more brokerage-oriented organizations for private banking clients. Prior to the acquisition of Lockwood and EMAT by BoNY, RBC Dominion Securities was the two firms&#x27; primary institutional advisory account. At the time, assets under management were estimated to be in excess of $11 billion.

===Eircom and Valentia===

O&#x27;Reilly was part of the Valentia consortium that bought into Eircom, the former Irish state phone company, in November 2001, for €2.8 billion, beating a rival offer of €3 billion. In 2004, the company was partly refloated, and in 2005 sold at a profit to Babcock &amp; Brown of Australia.

==Charitable works==

O&#x27;Reilly sponsored and supported a wide range of charitable activities. Several of these, such as the many-year support of a professorship in Australian Studies at UCD, were arranged together with his first wife, and likewise later, he and his second wife would often jointly support an activity, such as sponsorship of a gallery at the National Science Historical Museum adjacent to Birr Castle. He showed a particular interest in &quot;naming rights&quot;, where a contribution to a project, generally of 5% to 20%, allows a donor to add a name to the project, and has received at least one such &quot;name&quot; as a gift.

===Kilcullen===

O&#x27;Reilly supported a number of local initiatives, from floral street displays and signage for local nature walks in Kilcullen to commissioning, with his wife, a piece of music for the launch of the Dun Ailinne Interpretative Park. A presentation in recognition of this was made in mid-2009. O&#x27;Reilly was also the patron of the Kilcullen GAA club.

===The O&#x27;Reilly Foundation===

The O&#x27;Reilly Foundation is a charity set up by O&#x27;Reilly with a board of trustees composed of family members, long chaired by his second wife, and with a scholarship board headed by Professor Emeritus John Kelly of UCD, succeeding Ken Whitaker. With an office address at a family home in Dublin, and an executive secretary, it contributed to various projects, with an emphasis on the education sector, primarily running an annual scholarship programme, awarding 2–3 advanced, usually multi-year, third-level scholarships, each for over €20,000 per annum.

Both through the foundation and before its inception, O&#x27;Reilly contributed to a range of university projects in Ireland, including examples at Dublin City University, University College Dublin, Trinity College Dublin and Queen&#x27;s University Belfast.

O&#x27;Reilly also paid for the construction of the 600-seat O&#x27;Reilly Theatre in Belvedere College, and also funded projects in the college. The family also contributed to the construction of the O&#x27;Reilly Theater in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and the 181 seat O&#x27;Reilly Theatre at Keble College, Oxford.

===Trinity College Dublin===

O&#x27;Reilly contributed towards the O&#x27;Reilly Institute, backed the development of Jewish Studies within TCD, and supported the Chair in Neuroscience. He was a Pro-Chancellor of the University of Dublin from 1994 until retiring on age grounds at the end of the 2010/2011 academic year, and was also a member of the board of the Trinity Foundation.

===University College Dublin===

O&#x27;Reilly supported his alma mater, UCD, by funding the O&#x27;Reilly Hall, named in honour of his parents. This building is used for exams and as a venue for large events in Dublin.

===Dublin City University===

&quot;The John and Aileen O`Reilly Library&quot; at Dublin City University was named in honour of his parents, as the O`Reilly Foundation contributed a substantial sum to the library&#x27;s capital costs in 2000.

===Queen&#x27;s University Belfast===

A new library at Queen&#x27;s University of Belfast was, as of 2008, to be named the Sir Anthony O&#x27;Reilly Library, in recognition of support for the University, including a pledge of £4 million (of a £44 million cost for the library), £2 million from his personal charity, The O&#x27;Reilly Foundation and £2 million from Independent News and Media / The Belfast Telegraph and the Ireland Funds. However, following a request by O&#x27;Reilly in April 2009, the library was proposed to be known as either &quot;The New Library&quot; or &quot;The Library at Queen&#x27;s&quot;.

===The Ireland Funds===

The American Ireland Fund, the central entity in The Ireland Funds, was established in Boston by O&#x27;Reilly and his friend, Pittsburgh businessman Dan Rooney, in 1976, and for many years this and later similar initiatives in other countries, took up a considerable amount of his time. The funds, representing a network with more than ten national entities, had raised over $600 million to date. O&#x27;Reilly was the chairman.

==Personal life==

===Family===

O&#x27;Reilly was first engaged in 1958, to Dorothy Connolly, whom he had met in 1954, with the marriage planned for 1959.

He met his first wife, Australian secretary and pianist Susan M. Cameron, the daughter of a wealthy Australian mining figure in whose name he endowed a professorship at UCD for at least a decade, in 1959 in Australia, after she was suggested as a social contact when he was touring for rugby. After courting her when she moved to London, they married in 1962. He had six children with her, born from 1963 to 1966: Susan Wildman, Anthony Cameron O&#x27;Reilly (generally &quot;Cameron&quot;), Justine O&#x27;Reilly, Gavin O&#x27;Reilly, Caroline Dempsey, and St John Anthony (&quot;Tony Junior&quot;); the last three are triplets. All three boys were involved in family business interests, while the daughters are not known to be, the eldest being a qualified pilot, the second a lawyer and the third a full-time mother. The eldest daughter took a bachelor&#x27;s degree at Yale, and a master&#x27;s degree in history at Oxford.

All the O&#x27;Reilly children married and there are 19 grandchildren. The youngest daughter, Caroline, was married at the restored Church of St. Mary at Castlemartin Estate on 1 June 1991, while eldest child, Susan, married investment banker Tarik C. Wildman (1959–) on 14 August 1993 before an Episcopal dean at the same church. Gavin O&#x27;Reilly married Alison Doody there some years later.

The O&#x27;Reillys separated in the late 1980s, and Susan O&#x27;Reilly settled in London, in a house bought by Tony O&#x27;Reilly. They later divorced, and Susan O&#x27;Reilly died in 2014.

O&#x27;Reilly later married Chryss Goulandris, a Greek shipping heiress, who bred and raced thoroughbred horses as &quot;Skymarc Farms&quot; and under other names, and who owned stud farms in Normandy and other locations. Chryss was well known on the racecourses of Ireland, Britain and France, as &#x27;Lady O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;, and was knowledgeable on all aspects of the equine industry. They first met in New York, when Chryss accompanied her brother to a business meeting and the wedding took place in the Bahamas on 4 September 1991.

Chryss made a naming gift in her husband&#x27;s honour in 1999 with the O&#x27;Reilly Theater in Pittsburgh, and he bought her a famous Jackie Onassis diamond ring for over US$2 million. The second Mrs O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s brother was a close business ally of O&#x27;Reilly for many years, from around the time of the marriage. Lady O&#x27;Reilly died in August 2023.

===Residences===

A number of homes were associated with O&#x27;Reilly, including his main residence for more than 15 years, Lissadell Tamura in the private gated community of Lyford Cay, with a beach near Nassau in the Bahamas.

For many years his principal residence and later a major base was Castlemartin, a &quot;big house&quot; dating in current form from the 18th century, at Kilcullen, County Kildare (which has associated stud farm and cattle breeding premises on the large estate lands). O&#x27;Reilly purchased Castlemartin in 1972 from the Earl of Gowrie, and spent millions on improvements to the house and on the restoration of the 15th century Church of St Mary in the grounds. On 15 February 2008 permission was granted for the development of two ancillary houses on a remote part of the estate, adjoining Kilcullen (Bridge) village&#x27;s main street, incorporating residential, restaurant and retail space. In October 2007, O&#x27;Reilly paid a record €125,000 per acre for Hollyhill Stud in Carnalway near Brannockstown, under 3 kilometres from Kilcullen. The stud farm on the banks of the Liffey, with a 10-room house and a cottage, was thought to have been intended for one of his daughters.

In late 1995, he and his wife purchased a former solicitor&#x27;s office, a four-storey Georgian house at 2 Fitzwilliam Square, Dublin, with a courtyard and coach house with a separate entrance. The £1 million house, formerly owned by railway pioneer William Dargan, was a base when travel to Castlemartin was not feasible, and a place for meetings and his private office. O&#x27;Reilly also had a holiday compound, Shorecliffe, comprising several houses, garden areas and two swimming pools, by the sea in Glandore, County Cork.

The O&#x27;Reillys also owned a château &quot;built on the ruins of the castle where William the Conqueror plotted his 1066 invasion of England&quot; near Deauville in France.

For many years, a key O&#x27;Reilly residence was a 34-room mock Tudor house of at Fox Chapel, Pittsburgh, with of grounds. This property, his second home in that area, with eight bedrooms and bathrooms, an &quot;Irish bar&quot; in the basement, tennis courts, Japanese and English-themed gardens and swimming and tennis facilities, was sold for around $US2.4 million in 2000.

The residential complex in Glandore, the house on Fitzwilliam Square and the Castlemartin Estate were all auctioned off at sales forced by O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s creditors. O&#x27;Reilly later lived in the Château des Ducs de Normandie in Bonneville-sur-Touques in France, and later again in a house near Castlemartin in County Kildare.

===Sporting interests and driving===

O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s sons said that he was a keen player of tennis late in life. For a period in the 1990s, O&#x27;Reilly chaired a committee set up by the then Lord Mayor of Dublin, Gay Mitchell, aiming to bring the Olympic Games to Dublin in 2004.

In February 1963, O&#x27;Reilly was involved in an accident between Urlingford and Johnstown, when his car struck a cyclist, who was injured. Locals testified that the injured man was careless, he had no lights or reflector and had been on the wrong side of the road. O&#x27;Reilly was convicted of driving with undue care and was fined 4 pounds.

===Art collection===

The O&#x27;Reillys were significant art collectors for many years, with the biggest known acquisition being Monet&#x27;s Le Portail (Soleil), bought in 2000, at Sotheby&#x27;s of London, for $US24 million, and others including works by William Orpen and Jack Yeats, and bronzes and statues. In June 2008 it was reported that O&#x27;Reilly had commissioned a bound catalogue of his art collection, 15 cm thick, at a cost of €125,000 for 500 copies, edited by Suzanne Macdougald and with notes by, among others, Bruce Arnold. Copies were said to have been given to the President of Ireland and the Queen of the United Kingdom.

===Wealth and bankruptcy===

In May 2014, &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; reported that O&#x27;Reilly and his wife had a net worth of around US$545 million, down sharply from March 2012, when the Sunday Independent reported that O&#x27;Reilly had a net worth of €1 billion, excluding his wife&#x27;s estimated €300 million from her shipping family inheritances.

O&#x27;Reilly became locked in a legal case with a state-controlled Irish bank, Allied Irish Banks (AIB), in relation to his multimillion-euro debts, with AIB seeking a summary judgment against him at the High Court. The commercial court in Dublin refused a six-month stay or delay in a judgement against O&#x27;Reilly. In June 2014, the court entered a judgement of nearly €46 million against him. Judge Peter Kelly said he believed there was force in the argument that O&#x27;Reilly and his investment companies were insolvent. During the hearing, lawyers for O&#x27;Reilly admitted that he also owed large amounts to other banks and financial institutions. This meant O&#x27;Reilly would have to sell properties in Ireland to meet his debts to AIB bank.

In the wake of AIB&#x27;s €22.6 million judgement debt against him, O&#x27;Reilly filed for bankruptcy in March 2016. His lawyers disclosed that he had liabilities of more than €170 million and realisable assets of only €23 million. ACC Bank was owed the most, holding a debt of almost €47 million; it was followed by the UK’s Lloyds Bank International with €45.6 million and US distressed debt fund Lone Star Funds with €44 million. Among the Irish banks, AIB was then owed €15.5 million (having reduced its debt by collecting most of the €7.4 million sale proceeds of O’Reilly’s County Kildare home, Castlemartin); Bank of Ireland was at the time owed €2.1 million and Ulster Bank €1.2 million, while he owed €7.2 million to Bahamian lender EFG Bank &amp; Trust and €5.7 million to BNY Mellon (Bank of New York Mellon). O&#x27;Reilly exited bankruptcy in December 2023.

O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s former long-time nurse and assistant of 13 years, Sabina Vidunas, filed a lawsuit against O&#x27;Reilly in Pennsylvania in 2013, claiming that he owed her $40 million stock in a deal that he reneged on. O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s lawyers argued that his Bahamas bankruptcy applied also in America and thus negated her claim, however the US Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania declared that O&#x27;Reilly could not claim that his Bahamas bankruptcy automatically applied in the United States, because by then his &quot;center of main interests&quot; did not lie in the Bahamas&quot; but in France, where he had settled since the case began. Because no evidence was presented of &quot;any operations or nontransitory economic activity in the Bahamas&quot;, the Bahamian bankruptcy would probably not be recognised for a lesser, &quot;non-main center&quot;, argument either. Vidunas&#x27;s lawsuit was still ongoing as of 2020.

===Death and legacy===

O&#x27;Reilly died, after a short illness, at St. Vincent&#x27;s University Hospital, Dublin, on 18 May 2024, at the age of 88. The Taoiseach, Simon Harris, paid tribute to O&#x27;Reilly, describing him as &quot;a giant of sport, business and media&quot; and &quot;a trailblazer&quot;; the O&#x27;Reilly family also released a statement. The President of Ireland released a statement of tribute the next day, noting &quot;so many aspects of Irish life that Anthony O’Reilly touched in an innovative and changing way&quot; and further noting the massive contribution his work with the Ireland Funds made, and his &quot;personal commitment to staying with what he saw as a symbolic Irish activity in Waterford Crystal&quot;. Journalist Matt Cooper said of him that &quot;Other than Taoisigh and Ministers for Finance, few were as powerful and influential in the late 20th century and the first decade of 21st century Ireland&quot;.

O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s removal was on 22 May 2024, to Church of the Sacred Heart, Donnybrook, Dublin 4, the parish church to which O&#x27;Reilly was long attached. It was attended by his six children, the current Taoiseach and past officeholders, and hundreds more. His funeral, led by a friend from the Jesuit order and concelebrated by 6 other priests, took place the following morning. His children led the mourners, along with Ireland&#x27;s Tánaiste and representatives of the President of Ireland and the Taoiseach, and hundreds more, including a range of business, cultural and rugby union figures. It was announced that his cremation on 24 May would be private, and that his grandchildren and other family members would gather for a private memorial service later in the year. One of his daughters read his favourite poem, Kipling&#x27;s &quot;If—&quot;, another the first reading, and all three of his sons delivered eulogies.

===Awards and honours===

In 1978, O&#x27;Reilly was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Laws (LLD) by Trinity College Dublin.

In 1988, he was appointed an Honorary Officer of the Order of Australia (AO) for services to Irish-Australian relationships.

O&#x27;Reilly was knighted in the 2001 New Year Honours &quot;for long and distinguished service to Northern Ireland&quot;; including in recognition for his work as head of The Ireland Funds charity. O&#x27;Reilly, who described himself as a constitutional nationalist, sought the approval of the Irish Government in relation to the award, because it is a requirement of the Constitution of Ireland that &quot;No title of nobility or of honour may be accepted by any citizen except with the prior approval of the Government&quot;. As O&#x27;Reilly was also a British subject, in part due to his pre-1949 Irish birth, he held a substantive and not just an honorary knighthood, and could validly style himself &quot;Sir&quot;, as he did, using the style &quot;Sir Anthony O&#x27;Reilly&quot;.

An authorised biography, &quot;The Player: The Life of Tony O&#x27;Reilly&quot;, was written by Ivan Fallon, a journalist and biographer in the early 1990s, later a senior executive at one of O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s companies, and was for many years the only study of any length. O&#x27;Reilly facilitated the project, and the author was given access to family members, including past and current wives, and to staff and business colleagues. Fallon insisted in the foreword that he had complete discretion on what to include and how to tell it, excluding only some private family matters. While giving great detail on some business matters, the book says almost nothing about O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s children and little of his second wife. It gives considerable detail on business matters and questions some of O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s assertions, notably about his Irish business interests. It also gives much information on O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s parents&#x27; situations and especially his father&#x27;s family, some of which the author notes even O&#x27;Reilly did not have until the book gathered it, and includes some detail about his residences.

In 2015, another biography of O&#x27;Reilly was written by journalist Matt Cooper and published by Gill and Macmillan. Titled &quot;The Maximalist: The Rise and Fall of Tony O&#x27;Reilly&quot;, the book is said to offer an &quot;overview of a man described by the publishers as &quot;one of Ireland&#x27;s most remarkable public figures&quot;&quot;.

<text>Ctenacodon is a genus of extinct mammal that lived in what is now North America during the Upper Jurassic period. It is a member of the family Allodontidae within the order Multituberculata. &quot;Ctenacodon&quot;, also known as &quot;Allodon&quot; (Marsh 1881), was named by Othniel Charles Marsh in 1879. At least three species are currently recognized.

Present in stratigraphic zone 5. Remains possibly referrable to &quot;Ctenacodon&quot; have been recovered from stratigraphic zone 2.

==Species==
The species &quot;Ctenacodon laticeps&quot; was named by Marsh in 1881 and Simpson G.G. in 1927. It has also been known as &quot;Allodon laticeps&quot; (Marsh 1881). Remains were found in the Upper Jurassic strata of the Morrison Formation in Wyoming (United States). The holotype, collected by Reed W.H. in 1880, is in the Peabody Museum of Natural History at Yale University.

The species &quot;Ctenacodon scindens&quot; was named by Simpson G.G. in 1928. Remains were found in Jurassic strata of the Morrison Formation of Wyoming. This species was originally assigned to &quot;C. serratus&quot;.

The species &quot;Ctenacodon serratus&quot;, also named by Marsh in 1879, is also known from the Morrison Formation.

<doc id="202029" wikidata="Q20030127" url="?curid=202029" title="Bradley Fighting Vehicle">
<text>The Bradley Fighting Vehicle (BFV) is an American tracked armored fighting vehicle of the United States developed by FMC Corporation and now manufactured by BAE Systems Land &amp; Armaments, formerly United Defense. It is named for U.S. General Omar Bradley.

The Bradley is designed to transport infantry or scouts with armor protection, while providing covering fire to suppress enemy troops and armored vehicles. Variants include the M2 Bradley infantry fighting vehicle and the M3 Bradley reconnaissance vehicle. The M2 holds a crew of three—a commander, a gunner and a driver—along with six fully equipped soldiers. The M3 mainly conducts scout missions and carries two scout troopers in addition to the regular crew of three, with space for additional BGM-71 TOW missiles.

In 2014, the U.S. Army selected BAE Systems&#x27; Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle (AMPV) proposal of a turretless variant of the Bradley to replace over 2,800 M113 armored personnel carriers. Some 2,907 surplus Bradleys will be modified to become AMPVs for the U.S. Army.

==Design==
The Bradley was developed largely in response to the Soviet BMP family of infantry fighting vehicles. The Bradley was meant to serve as an armored personnel carrier and a tank-killer. One design requirement specified that it should be as fast as the M1 Abrams main battle tank, so the vehicles could maintain formation.

===Armament===
The M2/M3&#x27;s primary armament is a 25 mm chain gun using either 100 or 300 rounds per minute, accurate to . It is armed with a TOW missile launcher capable of carrying two loaded missiles. The missiles, capable of destroying most tanks to a maximum range of , can only be fired while the vehicle is stationary. The Bradley carries a coaxial 7.62 mm medium machine gun to the right of the chain gun.

====Primary====
The Bradley is equipped with the 25 mm M242 Bushmaster as its main weapon. The M242 is a single-barrel chain gun with an integrated dual-feed mechanism and remote feed selection. The cannon carries 300 rounds of ammunition in two ready boxes (one of 70 rounds, the other of 230 rounds), with an extra 600 rounds in storage for the M2 Infantry Fighting Vehicle variant or 1,200 stowed rounds for the M3 Cavalry Fighting Vehicle variant. The two ready-boxes allow a selectable mix of rounds, such as the M791 APDS-T (Armor-Piercing Discarding Sabot (with) Tracer) and M792 HEI-T (High Explosive Incendiary (with) Tracer) rounds. The tungsten APDS-T rounds proved effective in Desert Storm, capable of knocking out many Iraqi vehicles, including several T-55 tanks.

Subsequent ammunition developments resulted in the M919 APFSDS-T (armor-piercing fin-stabilized discarding sabot (with) tracer) round containing a finned depleted uranium penetrator similar in concept to armor-piercing munitions used in modern tanks. The M919 was used in combat during the 2003 invasion phase of Operation Iraqi Freedom.

====Secondary====
An M240C medium machine gun is mounted coaxially to the M242, with 2,200 rounds of 7.62×51mm ammunition. For engaging heavier targets, such as acting as an anti-tank gun, the Bradley carries a TOW missile system. This was modified to fire TOW II missiles from the M2A1 model onward. M2 infantry Bradleys have firing ports for M231 Firing Port Weapons (FPWs), providing a means for the occupants to fire from within the vehicle and replacing the top-side gunners on the M113-based Armored Cavalry Assault Vehicles, although the M231 is rarely employed.

Initial variants had six ports, but the side ports were plated over with the armor configuration on the A2 and A3 variants, leaving only the two rear-facing mounts in the loading ramp. No versions of the M3 CFV carry firing port weapons. Early versions had all six firing port mounts fitted and plated over. Newer versions retain the two ramp-mounted firing ports, though plated over.

===Countermeasures===

The use of aluminum armor and the storage of large quantities of ammunition in the vehicle initially raised questions about its combat survivability. Spaced laminate belts and high-hardness steel skirts have been added to improve the side protection of later versions, while overall weight was increased to 33 tons.

All versions are equipped with two four-barreled smoke grenade launchers on the front of the turret for creating defensive smoke screens, which can also be loaded with chaff and flares.

====Bradley Urban Survival Kit====
The Bradley Urban Survival Kit (BUSK) is an upgrade similar to the M1 Abrams TUSK kit. It decreases the vulnerability of Bradleys in urban environments. The kit includes a more powerful spotlight, a wire mesh protector to keep the optics from getting scratched, and nonconductive arched strips of nylon that push away fallen electrical wires (power line protection) that would endanger crews, additional armor on the underside, and a bullet-resistant transparent shield for the commander outside the turret. It includes sensors and a software package to quickly detect when components are wearing out, and simulation software so gunners can train more realistically.

The BUSK kit adds 3 tons to the vehicle&#x27;s weight. Because of this, a major upgrade was planned. Additional upgrades included a stronger, 800 horsepower engine, a larger main gun, lighter armor, improved sensors and cameras to give a 360° view outside, and an improved fire extinguisher system. This system was supposed to enter service in 2012, but the Bradley became too heavy and the kit did not make it survivable enough. A newer BUSK III kit is now available for Bradleys incorporating a blastproof fuel cell, a blast-resistant driver seat, a turret survivability system, and an emergency ramp release. This kit was recently installed on 236 M2A3 Bradleys in South Korea and is scheduled next to be added to Bradleys of the 4th Infantry Division.

As of late July 2023, Ukrainian Bradleys have been fitted with BUSK upgraded armor and Bradley Reactive Armor Tiles.

===Mobility===
The Bradley is highly capable in cross-country open terrain, in accordance with one of the main design objectives of keeping pace with the M1 Abrams main battle tank. The Bradley was initially designed to float by deploying a flotation curtain around the vehicle, allowing it to &quot;swim&quot; at a speed of . Later armor upgrades have negated this capability.

==History==
===Development===
One of the early issues that drove the development of the infantry fighting vehicle (IFV) was the need to have a vehicle that could serve in a high-intensity conflict in Europe, which was feared might include the use of nuclear, biological or chemical (NBC) type weapons. To work in such an environment, an IFV would have to have a life support system that protected from outside contaminants, while allowing the soldiers to fight from inside the vehicle. The earliest specification, from 1958, called for a vehicle of no more than 8 tons, mounting a turret with a 20 mm autocannon and a 7.62 mm machine gun, with sealed firing ports for five infantry gunners.
In December 1963, the Army Combat Developments Command studied the concept for a &quot;Post 1965 Infantry Combat Vehicle&quot;, later the MICV. In the interim, the Army planned upgrades to the M113 that would bridge the gap to the MICV. One such upgrade was the XM734 which added firing ports. The .50 caliber machine gun was replaced with a twin machine gun cupola or an M139 20 mm autocannon. This test bed saw limited service in Vietnam, from 1967 to 1972, where it received positive feedback from troops.
In 1963, the U.S. and West German governments began work on the MBT-70 main battle tank design and an IFV companion project called MICV-65, Mechanized Infantry Combat Vehicle. In 1964, the Army solicited bids for the MICV-65, awarding the contract for the Pacific Car and Foundry Company. The first XM701 prototype was delivered in 1965 and testing was completed in 1966. The XM701 shared components with the M107 and M110 self-propelled howitzers.

The prototypes had the following characteristics: a weight of 25–27 tons, depending on an aluminum or steel hull; a 425 hp diesel engine; a two-man turret with a 20 mm gun; a crew of three plus nine infantry equipped with firing ports; a built-in toilet; armor that was proof against Soviet 14.5 mm MG fire beyond a certain range; a collective and overpressure CBR system; amphibious. The filtration system provided a shirt-sleeve environment until the passengers dismounted. After that they could not repressurize without fear of contamination, but they could plug their suits into the vehicle&#x27;s filtration system. The vehicle was high, long, and wide. The rising costs of the Vietnam War left less money to go around in the Pentagon&#x27;s procurement budget. The XM701 project had several technical shortcomings. It had poor mobility relative to upcoming designs such as the MBT-70, and it could not be carried aboard a C-141 Starlifter. The project was canceled, and new specifications were written in 1965.

In 1967, the public display of the BMP-1 caused additional interest in the MICV program, which concluded its studies in 1968. Continued disagreements on specifications slowed down development. In 1968, an Army task force headed by Major General George Casey recommended that the service once again pursue the development of an MICV. The Army opened a new program manager&#x27;s office later in 1968.
From 1969 to 1970, the Army looked at two alternate vehicles that could be fielded more quickly. The FMC Corporation had developed the XM765 Armored Infantry Fighting Vehicle, an IFV version of the M113A1. It had a one-man turret mounting a 25 mm gun, a sealed environment, and firing ports. The vehicle weight was 15 tons. The upper sides of the vehicle were sloped and spaced steel armor plates were added to improve protection. Firing ports for the passengers were added and a M139 20 mm cannon was added to the commander&#x27;s cupola. The U.S. Army rejected it due to limited mobility, which would have prevented it from keeping pace with the proposed MBT-70. The other alternate vehicle was the West German Marder, which mounted a 20 mm autocannon, relatively strong steel armor, and full CBR protection. The U.S. Army rejected it due to it not being amphibious, too large and heavy for air transport, and too expensive.
The MICV program continued on, and in 1972, the Army solicited proposals for the MICV. In November 1972, the Army awarded FMC a contract to develop the XM723. This vehicle was similar to the XM765, but had improved armor and speed. It shared components with the LVTP-7 rather than the M113. FMC began construction of the XM723 prototype, which was completed in 1973. The XM723 weighed 21 tons, had spaced aluminum armor proofed against 14.5 mm fire, had a crew of three plus eight infantry, firing ports for the infantry, and a one-man turret with a 20 mm gun. The commander sat inside the hull.

To adapt the XM723 to a reconnaissance role, as well as an IFV, the turret was replaced in 1976 with a two-man turret mounting a 25 mm Bushmaster cannon and TOW missiles. This was the TBAT-II (Tow Bushmaster Armored Turret, Two Man) design. A two-man turret design put the commander in a position with a better view of the battlefield. The TOW missiles give the vehicle a strong antiarmor capability. The value of anti-tank missiles had been well established in the 1973 Yom Kippur war. The added political advantage was that the TOW missiles made it an easier sell to Congress, as it was a new capability not possessed by the M113.

General Donn Starry wrote:
In October 1976, the Army accepted a number of recommendations put forward by the MICV Task Force formed earlier that year. The Army would combine the roles of scout and IFV, as the previous Armored Reconnaissance Scout Vehicle had been canceled. The Army agreed to make the armor protection comparable to the XM723. The TBAT-II turret with its 25 mm cannon and a TOW-missile launcher in the two-man turret would be used for the both vehicles.

In 1977, the MICV was renamed the XM2. The scout version became the XM3. These comprised the two variants of the Fighting Vehicle System. A third variant, called the General Support Rocket System, which later entered production as the M270 Multiple Launch Rocket System, was added to the portfolio in 1977.

Congress was questioning the development of the XM2 due to the high losses incurred by Soviet built BMP-1s in the 1973 Yom Kippur War. Congress suggested the development of a more heavily armored vehicle. The Army argued against this due to concerns about cost, weight, and development time. In 1977, Congress ordered two new evaluations of the IFV program, one by the Government Accounting Office (GAO) and one by the Department of the Army, under General Pat Crizer. The GAO report released in early 1978 was critical of the XM2&#x27;s height, mobility, complexity, lack of clear doctrinal use, and lack of chemical/biological/radiological protection.

Based upon this criticism, the OMB deleted M2/3 funding from the budget for the 1979 financial year. In 1978, the Crizer report asserted that the basic design was consistent with doctrine, and that development of an IFV with superior characteristics would be costly and pose significant developmental risks. An additional study, the IFV/CFV Special Study Group, evaluated whether an improved version of the M113 could be used instead of the M2/3 IFV. Their conclusion was that extensive redesign would be necessary for even marginal improvements in M113 derivatives. In October 1978, Congress reauthorized procurement funds.

FMC delivered eight XM2 prototypes to the Army beginning in December 1978 and progressing through March 1979.
The XM2/3 passed the Army Systems Acquisition Review Council Milestone III review in 1979. In December 1979, the XM2 and XM3 were type classified as the M2 and M3 respectively. Final approval for production came from the Secretary of Defense in February 1980. In October 1981 the vehicle was named the &quot;Bradley&quot; for World War II Army General Omar Bradley, who had died earlier that year.

===Production history===
The Bradley consists of two types of vehicles, the M2 Infantry Fighting Vehicle and the M3 Cavalry Fighting Vehicle. The M3 CFV was originally planned to be named after General Jacob L. Devers, but it was decided the Bradley name would apply to both, since both vehicles are based on the same chassis. They differ in only some details. The M2 carries a crew of three and a six-man infantry squad. The M3 carries the crew of three and a two-man scout team and additional radios, the BGM-71 TOW and M47 Dragon or FGM-148 Javelin missiles.

The first BFVs came off the production line in May 1980. The Army accepted delivery of the first production vehicles in May 1981. The first combat unit to be equipped with Bradleys (four M2s and six M3s), in March 1983, was the 1st Battalion, 41st (Mechanized) Infantry, 2nd Armored Division. Several years later, the unit commander, Lt. Col. Franklin W. Trapnell, Jr., became the Army&#x27;s system manager for the Bradley program.

Saudi Arabia stated an interest in acquiring the Bradley in 1989 and began importing the vehicle in 1990.

Bradley production concluded in 1995, with a total of 6,724 Bradleys (4,641 M2s and 2,083 M3s) produced for the U.S. Army. The total cost of the program was $5.7 billion, and the average unit cost $3.2 million. This was despite an unmet requirement by the U.S. Army for 8,709 Bradleys as of 1992. Remanufacture of A0 variants to A2 standard began at the same time. As of 2017, 2,907 Bradleys are slated to be modified to become Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicles for the U.S. Army. 1,600 to 2,000 older Bradleys remain in Army depots as of 2017. Some of these Bradleys will be taken from these stocks.

The Red River Army Depot in Texarkana, Texas, is responsible for maintenance and repair of the Bradley system.

====Col. James Burton and the joint live fire testing program====
Even after the troubled development history of the Bradley additional problems occurred after production started. Air Force Col. James G. Burton, an Office of the Secretary of Defense official, advocated the use of comprehensive live fire tests on fully loaded military vehicles to evaluate their survivability. The Army and Air Force agreed to establish the joint live fire testing program in 1984.

When testing the Bradley, disagreements occurred between Burton and the Aberdeen Proving Ground&#x27;s Ballistic Research Laboratory (BRL), which preferred smaller, more controlled, &quot;building block&quot; tests. They claimed such limited, completely unrealistic, according to Burton, testing would improve the databases used to model vehicle survivability, as opposed to full tests with random shots that would provide a far more accurate picture of its performance under real battlefield conditions but produce less useful statistical data.

Burton insisted on a series of &quot;overmatch&quot; tests in which weapons would be fired at the Bradley that were known to be able to penetrate its armor, including Russian ordnance easily. Burton saw attempts to avoid such tests as dishonest, while the BRL saw them as wasteful, as they already knew the vehicle would fail. The disagreements became so contentious that testing was suspended, while a congressional inquiry resulted. Additional improvements to vehicle survivability were added to production vehicles by 1988. Though Burton&#x27;s actions accelerated the implementation of these changes, the changes themselves were almost wholly the work of the BRL.

Burton was ordered to transfer from his post at OSD, prompting yet more congressional scrutiny. Burton retired from the Air Force rather than accept the new post. The House Armed Services Committee found that Burton&#x27;s claims of malfeasance were rather due to &quot;a long-standing fundamental disagreement over testing methodology and, more importantly, the inability of OSD and the Army to reach an agreement on how the test is conducted. ...The Army has complied with many of Colonel Burton&#x27;s issues of concern over the past several years.&quot;

In 1993, Burton released his book &quot;The Pentagon Wars: Reformers Challenge the Old Guard&quot;. The book was adapted into the black comedy film &quot;The Pentagon Wars&quot; in 1998.

===Combat history===
====Persian Gulf War====
During the Persian Gulf War, M2 Bradleys destroyed more Iraqi armored vehicles than the M1 Abrams. A few kills against Iraqi T-72 tanks at close range are reported. A total of 20 Bradleys were lost—three by enemy fire and 17 due to friendly fire incidents. Another 12 were damaged. The gunner of one Bradley was killed when his vehicle was hit by Iraqi fire, possibly from an Iraqi BMP-1, during the Battle of 73 Easting. To remedy some problems that were identified as contributing factors in the friendly fire incidents, infrared identification panels and other marking/identification measures were added to the Bradleys.

====Iraq War====
In the Iraq War, the Bradley proved vulnerable to improvised explosive device and rocket-propelled grenade attacks, but casualties were light with the crew able to escape. In 2006, total losses included 55 Bradleys destroyed and some 700 others damaged. By the end of the war, about 150 Bradleys had been destroyed.

====Russo-Ukrainian War====

During the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the US donated about 190 Bradleys to Ukraine&#x27;s armed forces. Ukraine&#x27;s first documented use of Bradleys occurred in the Zaporizhzhia region after Ukraine launched its southern counteroffensive in June 2023. An early assault near Mala Tokmachka on June 8 was unsuccessful, and imagery showed that Ukraine lost at least 17 Bradleys of M2 variant. On 19 July, Hanna Maliar, Ukraine&#x27;s deputy defense minister, claimed on Telegram that a M2 Bradley had killed Russian infantrymen during fighting in the Zaporizhzhia region. She further claimed that using TOW missiles the M2 Bradley was able to destroy two Russian T-72 tanks. The Bradley was assigned to the 47th Mechanized Brigade. These claims could not be independently verified.

On 12 January 2024, video emerged of a pair of Ukrainian M2A2 Bradleys from the 47th Mechanized Brigade engaging and disabling a Russian T-90M tank at close range with their autocannons in Stepove, Ukraine.

As of 28 February 2025, 144 of the donated Bradleys had been confirmed destroyed, damaged, abandoned or captured (71 destroyed, 25 damaged, 40 damaged and abandoned, 8 captured) by the Dutch open-source intelligence website Oryx.

U.S. Army began efforts to replace the Bradley in the mid-1980s under the Armored Systems Modernization program. The Army studied creating several vehicle variants under a common heavy chassis to replace main battle tanks and Bradleys. This effort was canceled in 1992 due to the collapse of the Soviet Union.

The U.S. Army began the Future Combat Systems (FCS) Manned Ground Vehicles program in 1999. This family of 18-ton lightweight tracked vehicles centered around a common chassis. It would consist of eight variants, including infantry carriers, scouting vehicles and main battle tanks. FCS was canceled in 2009 due to budget cuts.

In 2010, the Army began the Ground Combat Vehicle program to replace the M2 Bradley. Entries from BAE Systems and General Dynamics were selected for evaluation. Concerns grew around the vehicle&#x27;s proposed weight of around 70 tons. The GCV was cancelled in 2014 due to sequestration budget cuts.
The Army&#x27;s Bradley replacement effort was restarted under the Future Fighting Vehicle (FFV) program. In May 2015, General Dynamics and BAE Systems, the two prime contractors involved with the GCV, were awarded contracts to develop design concepts for the FFV. In June 2018, the Army established the Next Generation Combat Vehicle (NGCV) program to replace the M2 Bradley.

In October 2018, the program was re-designated as the Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle (OMFV). The NGCV program was expanded as a portfolio of next-generation vehicles including tanks and the Bradley-based Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle, a successor to the M113 family. This program placed much of the cost burden of development on contractors, causing many competitors to drop out. In February 2020, the Army restarted the program, promising to take on more responsibility for funding.

==Variants==
===M2 Bradley===
The M2 Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicle (IFV) consists of five variants: the M2, M2A1, M2A2, M2A2 ODS (Operation Desert Storm improvements), and M2A3. Their main mission is to provide protected transport of an infantry squad, up to six passengers, to critical points. Aside from carrying mechanized infantry into close contact with the enemy, the M2 can provide overwatching fire to dismounting infantrymen. It is adequately armored to provide protection against small arms fire and artillery, and able to combat any vehicle on the battlefield using its TOW missiles.

The M2 IFV has six external firing ports for the squad M231 Firing Port Weapon on the M2 and M2A1 versions only. Four ports were removed on the sides of the vehicle on the M2A2 and A3 versions, and only two in the ramp remain. These ports allow passengers to engage the enemy from within the protection of the Bradley vehicle. These firing ports are almost always covered by additional armor kits and a Bradley with them operable is rare. The proper use of M231 FPWs was rare in practice.

The M2 Bradley unit cost is $1.11 million (FY 1993 constant dollars) US$1.84M in 2016 (inflation adjusted).

===M3 Bradley===
The M3 Bradley Cavalry Fighting Vehicle (CFV) is virtually identical to the M2 Bradley except that it is equipped as a cavalry/scout vehicle. Instead of holding six infantrymen in the payload compartment, it is designed to seat two scouts and hold additional radios and ammunition. Lacking are the six external firing ports present on the M2 Bradley IFV.

===M4 command and control vehicle (C2V)===
The C2V is based on the M993 M270 multiple launch rocket system (MLRS) carrier chassis and is designed to provide an automated tactical command post and operations centers. It was designed to replace the M113-based M577A2 command post carrier. Mass production was cancelled in late 1999. Around 25 vehicles were finally produced for the US Army.

===Bradley Stinger Fighting Vehicle (BSFV)===
The BSFV is designed specifically for the carriage and support of a Stinger MANPADS team. The MANPADS-Under-Armor (MUA) dismounted Stinger team concept of the BSFV left the operators exposed, so it was replaced by the M6 Linebacker, which retained the dismounted Stinger missile capability.

===M6 Linebacker===
An air defense variant, these vehicles are modified M2A2 ODSs with the TOW missile system replaced with a four-tube Stinger missile system. The U.S. Army awarded the initial contract in 1995, calling for 260 Bradleys converted into the configuration. From 2005 to 2006, M6 Linebackers had their Stinger missile systems removed and were converted to standard M2 Bradley ODS IFVs. By 2017, the US Army was exploring reintroducing air defense Bradleys with the reemergence of hostile aerial threats.

In October 2017, BAE displayed an updated version of the Bradley Linebacker called the M-SHORAD (Mobile Short-Range Air Defense) equipped with a pMHR (portable multi-mission hemispheric radar) search radar mounted around the turret, a fire-control radar, and a jammer on top of the turret to non-kinetically defeat unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The main gun was replaced with an XM914 30 mm autocannon with airburst rounds, and a missile launcher that could accommodate various missiles including the Stinger, AIM-9X Sidewinder, or others.

The US Army chose to create an M-SHORAD vehicle out of the Stryker instead of the Bradley. Although the tracked Bradley has better mobility on soft ground, the wheeled Stryker has sufficient mobility to perform tactical air defense while also having greater weight, space, and electrical power capacity to make upgrades.

===M7 Bradley Fire Support Vehicle===
The B-FiST has replaced the existing armored FiST vehicle (FiST-V) platform, the M981 FISTV, in the U.S. Army inventory. The TOW/UA suite is replaced by target location equipment, integrated with the Bradley ISU sight unit. It carries equipment for use by dismounted observers. A hybrid GPS/inertial/dead reckoning navigation system robustly provides the vehicle location as a reference point.

===Bradley Engineer Squad Vehicle===
The Bradley ESV enables engineer assets to maintain momentum with the main force while conducting engineer and sapper operations. The ESV is equipped with standard combat engineering equipment and can employ unique mission equipment packages for obstacle neutralization.

===Bradley Battle Command Vehicle===
The Bradley BCV allows brigade commanders to move around the battlefield away from their command post. The BCV integrates an enhanced command and control communication suite to maintain digital interface with maneuver forces and the Tactical Operations Center.

===M993/M270 multiple launch rocket system carrier vehicle===
The M270 MLRS is composed of two major sections, a M269 launcher loader module mated to a M993 carrier vehicle. The M993 carrier vehicle portion is a modified BFV chassis.

===Black Knight===
The Black Knight prototype unmanned ground combat vehicle being developed by BAE that resembles a tank and makes extensive use of components from the Bradley Combat Systems program to reduce costs and simplify maintenance. It is designed to be remotely operated from a BFV commander&#x27;s station while riding mounted, as well as being controllable by dismounted infantry.

===Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle===

For the U.S. Army&#x27;s Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle (AMPV) program to replace the M113, BAE offered a variant of the Bradley. The AMPV submission was a turretless Bradley chassis, but US Army requirements favored providing greater cargo space, increased armor, upgraded engine and electrical systems. For increased protection, the Army required a V-shaped bottom replaces the flat base. These changes created a wholly new chassis design that is based on and shares common components with the Bradley but is a distinctly new vehicle. The AMPV has several modular roof sections to adapt to each role. For fuel efficiency, BAE has considered using a hybrid-electric drive, similar to their Ground Combat Vehicle. It was suggested that surplus Bradleys could be retrofitted into this version.

BAE said that they have the capability to build up to eight AMPV platforms per day, the same as the Bradley during the height of its production, as both vehicles share the same production line and supply base. A mortar carrier vehicle can be converted from the original Bradley in 40 days. Underbody blast tests demonstrated that AMPV survivability requirements could be met with a Bradley platform. BAE projected their AMPV submission to have similar operating costs to the M113 and lower costs than an M2 Bradley, as the platform&#x27;s most expensive components are related to the omitted turret. To better accommodate modern electronics, the turretless Bradley has 78% more internal space than the M113, and two 400-amp generators.

BAE Systems rolled out the first AMPV prototype on 15 December 2016. Funding allows for 160 vehicles to be produced per year as of 2016, which is enough to field one and a half brigades. The 1st Armored Brigade Combat Team, 3rd Infantry Division was the first unit to be equipped with the AMPV in March 2023. A contract for full-rate production was awarded in September 2023.

=== Other ===
* Battle Command Vehicle: The vehicle was visually similar to the M2 Bradley on which it is based. Some ammunition space was eliminated in order to accommodate communications equipment and workstations for battle commanders. United Defense LP converted two M2 Bradleys to this configuration, which the Army tested at Fort Hood in 1997.

<text>The Sikorsky SH-60/MH-60 Seahawk (or Sea Hawk) is a twin turboshaft engine, multi-mission United States Navy helicopter based on the United States Army UH-60 Black Hawk and a member of the Sikorsky S-70 family. The most significant modifications are the folding main rotor blades and a hinged tail to reduce its footprint aboard ships.

The U.S. Navy acquired H-60 helicopters under the model designations SH-60B, SH-60F, HH-60H, MH-60R, and MH-60S. Able to deploy aboard any air-capable frigate, destroyer, cruiser, fast combat support ship, expeditionary transfer dock, amphibious assault ship, littoral combat ship or aircraft carrier, the Seahawk can handle anti-submarine warfare (ASW), anti-surface warfare (ASUW), naval special warfare (NSW) insertion, search and rescue (SAR), combat search and rescue (CSAR), vertical replenishment (VERTREP), and medical evacuation (MEDEVAC). When entering service, the SH-60 was too large to operate from some of the smaller vessels in service, so it served along with the Kaman SH-2F and SH-2G models until 2001.

Early model Seahawks began to be retired in the 2010s and 2020s, with the last B model leaving U.S. Navy service in 2015, after over three decades, then the F and H models followed in 2016. These were replaced by the upgraded MH-60R and S models. 

==Design and development==
===Origins===
In the 1970s, the U.S. Navy began looking for a new helicopter to replace the Kaman SH-2 Seasprite. The SH-2 Seasprite was used by the Navy as its platform for the Light Airborne Multi-Purpose System (LAMPS) Mark I avionics suite for maritime warfare and a secondary search and rescue capability. Advances in sensor and avionic technology lead to the LAMPS Mk II suite being developed by the Naval Air Development Center. In 1974, the Navy conducted a competition to develop the Lamps MK III concept, which would integrate both the aircraft and shipboard systems. The Navy selected IBM Federal Systems as the Prime systems integrator for the Lamps MK III concept.

Since the SH-2 was not large enough to carry the Navy&#x27;s required equipment, a new airframe was required. In the mid-1970s, the Army evaluated the Sikorsky YUH-60 and Boeing Vertol YUH-61 for its Utility Tactical Transport Aircraft System (UTTAS) competition. The Navy based its requirements on the Army&#x27;s UTTAS specification, to decrease costs from commonality as the new airframe to carry the Lamps MK III avionics. In April 1977, Sikorsky and Boeing-Vertol submitted proposals for Navy versions of their Army UTTAS helicopters for review. The Navy also looked at helicopters being produced by Bell, Kaman, Westland and MBB, but these were too small for the mission. In early 1978, the Navy selected Sikorsky&#x27;s S-70B design, which was designated &quot;SH-60B Seahawk&quot;.

===SH-60B Seahawk===
IBM was the prime systems integrator for the Lamps MK III with Sikorsky as the airframe manufacturer. The SH-60B maintained 83% commonality with the UH-60A. The main changes were corrosion protection, more powerful T700 engines, single-stage oleo main landing gear, removal of the left side door, adding two weapon pylons, and shifting the tail landing gear forward to reduce the footprint for shipboard landing. Other changes included larger fuel cells, an electric blade folding system, folding horizontal stabilators for storage, and adding a 25-tube pneumatic sonobuoy launcher on the left side.

An emergency flotation system was originally installed in the stub wing fairings of the main landing gear. It was found to be impractical and possibly impeded emergency egress, and was removed. Five YSH-60B Seahawk LAMPS III prototypes were ordered. The first YSH-60B flight occurred on 12 December 1979. The first production SH-60B made its first flight on 11 February 1983. The SH-60B entered operational service in 1984, with its first operational deployment in 1985.

The SH-60B is deployed primarily aboard frigates, destroyers, and cruisers. The primary missions of the SH-60B are surface warfare and anti-submarine warfare. It carries a complex system of sensors, including a towed magnetic anomaly detector (MAD) and air-launched sonobuoys. Other sensors include the APS-124 search radar, ALQ-142 ESM system and optional nose-mounted forward looking infrared (FLIR) turret. Munitions carried include the Mk 46, Mk 50, or Mark 54 Lightweight Torpedo, AGM-114 Hellfire missile, and a single cabin-door-mounted M60D/M240 7.62 mm (0.30 in) machine gun, or GAU-16 .50 in (12.7 mm) machine gun.

A standard crew for a SH-60B is one pilot, one ATO/Co-Pilot (Airborne Tactical Officer), and an enlisted aviation warfare systems operator (sensor operator). The U.S. Navy operated the SH-60B in Helicopter Anti-Submarine Squadron, Light (HSL) squadrons. All HSL squadrons were redesignated Helicopter Maritime Strike (HSM) squadrons, and transitioned to the MH-60R between 2006 and 2015.

The SH-60J is a version of the SH-60B for the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force with different avionics. The SH-60K is a modified version of the SH-60J. The SH-60J and SH-60K are built under license by Mitsubishi in Japan.

===SH-60F===
After the SH-60B entered service, the Navy conducted a competition to replace the SH-3 Sea King. The competitors were Sikorsky, Kaman and IBM (avionics only). Sikorsky began development of this variant in March 1985. In January 1986, seven SH-60Fs were ordered including two prototypes (BuNos 163282/3). The first example flew on 19 March 1987. The SH-60F was based on the SH-60B airframe, but with upgraded SH-3H avionics.

The SH-60F primarily served as the carrier battle group&#x27;s primary antisubmarine warfare (ASW) aircraft. The helicopter hunted submarines with its AQS-13F dipping sonar, and carried a 6-tube sonobuoy launcher. The SH-60F is unofficially named &quot;Oceanhawk&quot;. The SH-60F can carry Mk 46, Mk 50, or Mk 54 torpedoes for its offensive weapons, and it has a choice of fuselage-mounted machine guns, including the M60D, M240D, and GAU-16 (.50 caliber or 12.7 mm) for self-defense. The standard aircrew is one pilot, one co-pilot, one tactical sensor operator (TSO), and one acoustic sensor operator (ASO). The SH-60F was operated by the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Helicopter Antisubmarine (HS) squadrons, until they were redesignated Helicopter Sea Combat (HSC) squadrons and transitioned to the MH-60S. The last HS squadron completed its transition in 2016.

===HH-60H===
The HH-60H was developed in conjunction with the US Coast Guard&#x27;s HH-60J, beginning in September 1986 with a contract for the first five helicopters with Sikorsky as the prime contractor. The variant&#x27;s first flight occurred on 17 August 1988. Deliveries of the HH-60H began in 1989. The variant earned initial operating capability in April 1990 and was deployed to Desert Storm with HCS-4 and HCS-5 in 1991. The HH-60H&#x27;s official DoD and Sikorsky name is &quot;Seahawk&quot;, though it has been called &quot;Rescue Hawk&quot;.

Based on the SH-60F, the HH-60H is the primary combat search and rescue (CSAR), naval special warfare (NSW) and anti-surface warfare (ASUW) helicopter. It carries various defensive and offensive sensors. These include a FLIR turret with laser designator, and the Aircraft Survival Equipment (ASE) package including the ALQ-144 Infrared Jammer, AVR-2 Laser Detectors, APR-39(V)2 Radar Detectors, AAR-47 Missile Launch Detectors and ALE-47 chaff/flare dispensers. Engine exhaust deflectors provide infrared thermal reduction, reducing the threat of heat-seeking missiles. The HH-60H can carry up to four AGM-114 Hellfire missiles on an extended wing using the M299 launcher, and a variety of mountable guns including M60D, M240, GAU-16 and GAU-17/A machine guns.

The HH-60H&#x27;s standard crew is a pilot, a copilot, an enlisted crew chief, and two door gunners or one rescue swimmer. Originally operated by HCS-5 and HCS-4 (later HSC-84), these two special USNR squadrons were established with the primary mission of Naval Special Warfare and Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR). Due to SOCOM budget issues, the squadrons were deactivated in 2006 and 2016 respectively. The HH-60H was also operated by Helicopter Antisubmarine (HS) squadrons, with a standard dispersal of six F-models and two or three H-models, before the transition of HS squadrons to HSC squadrons equipped with the MH-60S, the last of which completed its transition in 2016. The only squadron equipped with the HH-60H as of 2016 is HSC-85, one of only two remaining USNR helicopter squadrons, the other being HSM-60 equipped with the MH-60R. In Iraq, HH-60Hs were used by the Navy, assisting the Army, for MEDEVAC purposes and special operations missions.

===MH-60R===
The MH-60R &quot;Romeo&quot; was originally known as &quot;LAMPS Mark III Block II Upgrade&quot; when development began in 1993 with Lockheed Martin, formerly IBM/Loral. Two SH-60Bs were converted by Sikorsky, the first of which made its maiden flight on 22 December 1999. Designated YSH-60R, they were delivered to NAS Patuxent River in 2001 for flight testing. The production variant was redesignated MH-60R to match its multi-mission capability. The MH-60R was deployed by the US Navy in 2006.

The MH-60R is designed to combine the features of the SH-60B and SH-60F. Its avionics includes dual controls and instead of the complex array of dials and gauges in Bravo and Foxtrot aircraft, 4 fully integrated 8&quot; x 10&quot; night vision goggle-compatible and sunlight-readable color multi-function displays, all part of glass cockpit produced by Owego Helo Systems division of Lockheed Martin. Onboard sensors include: AAR-47 Missile Approach Warning System by ATK, Raytheon AAS-44 electro-optical system that integrates FLIR and laser rangefinder, ALE-39 decoy dispenser and ALQ-144 infrared jammer by BAE Systems, ALQ-210 electronic support measures system by Lockheed Martin, APS-147 multi-mode radar/IFF interrogator, which during a mid-life technology insertion project is replaced by APS-153 Multi-Mode Radar with Automatic Radar Periscope Detection and Discrimination (ARPDD) capability.

Both radars were developed by Telephonics, a more advanced AN/AQS-22 advanced airborne low-frequency sonar (ALFS) jointly developed by Raytheon &amp; Thales, an ARC-210 voice radio by Rockwell Collins, an advanced airborne fleet data link SRQ-4 Hawklink with radio terminal set ARQ-59 radio terminal, both by L3Harris, and LN-100G dual-embedded global positioning system and inertial navigation system by Northrop Grumman Litton division. Beginning in 2020, CAE&#x27;s MAD-XR were fielded on MH-60Rs, providing it with a magnetic anomaly detector.

Offensive capabilities are improved by the addition of new Mk-54 air-launched torpedoes and Hellfire missiles. All Helicopter Anti-Submarine Light (HSL) squadrons that receive the MH-60R are redesignated Helicopter Maritime Strike (HSM) squadrons.

===MH-60S===

In 1997, the Navy decided to replace its venerable CH-46 Sea Knight helicopters. In 1998, the Navy awarded a production contract to Sikorsky for the CH-60S, after sea demonstrations with a converted UH-60. The variant first flew on 27 January 2000 and it began flight testing later that year. The CH-60S was redesignated MH-60S in February 2001 to reflect its planned multi-mission use. The MH-60S is based on the UH-60L and has many naval SH-60 features. Unlike all other Navy H-60s, the MH-60S is not based on the original S-70B/SH-60B platform, with its forward-mounted twin tail-gear and single starboard sliding cabin door. Instead, the S-model is a hybrid, featuring the main fuselage of the S-70A/UH-60, with large sliding doors on both sides of the cabin and a single aft-mounted tail wheel, and the folding tail pylon, engines, drivetrain and rotors of the S-70B/SH-60. It includes the integrated glass cockpit developed by Lockheed Martin for the MH-60R and shares some of the same avionics/weapons systems.

It is deployed aboard aircraft carriers, amphibious assault ships, Maritime Sealift Command ships, and fast combat support ships. Its missions include vertical replenishment, medical evacuation, combat search and rescue, anti-surface warfare, maritime interdiction, close air support, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, and special warfare support. The MH-60S is to deploy with the AQS-20A Mine Detection System and an Airborne Laser Mine Detection System (ALMDS) for identifying submerged objects in coastal waters.

It is the first US Navy helicopter to field a glass cockpit, relaying flight information via four digital monitors. The primary means of defense is door-mounted machine guns such as the M60D, M240D, or GAU-17/A. A &quot;batwing&quot; Armed Helo Kit based on the Army&#x27;s UH-60L was developed to accommodate Hellfire missiles, Hydra 70 2.75 inch rockets, or larger guns. The MH-60S can be equipped with a nose-mounted forward looking infrared (FLIR) turret to be used in conjunction with Hellfire missiles. It carries the ALQ-144 Infrared Jammer.
The MH-60S is unofficially known as the &quot;Knighthawk&quot;, referring to the preceding Sea Knight, though &quot;Seahawk&quot; is its official DoD name. A standard crew for the MH-60S is one pilot, one copilot and two tactical aircrewmen, depending on the mission. With the retirement of the Sea Knight, the squadron designation of Helicopter Combat Support Squadron (HC) was retired from the Navy. Operating MH-60S squadrons were re-designated Helicopter Sea Combat Squadron (HSC). The MH-60S was to be used for mine clearing from littoral combat ships, but testing found it lacks the power to safely tow the detection equipment.

In August 2014, the U.S. Navy forward deployed the Airborne Laser Mine Detection System (ALMDS) to the U.S. 5th Fleet. The ALMDS is a sensor system designed to detect, classify, and localize floating and near-surface moored mines in littoral zones, straits, and choke points. The system is operated from an MH-60S, which gives it a countermine role traditionally handled by the MH-53E Sea Dragon, allowing smaller ships that the MH-53E cannot operate from, to be used in the role. The ALMDS beams a laser into the water to pick up reflections from things it bounces off of, then uses that data to produce a video image for ground personnel to determine if the object is a mine.

The MH-60S will utilize the BAE Systems Archerfish remotely operated vehicle (ROV) to seek out and destroy naval mines from the air. Selected as a concept in 2003 by the Navy as part of the Airborne Mine Neutralization System (AMNS) program and developed since 2007, the Archerfish is dropped into the water from its launch cradle, where its human operator remotely guides it down towards the mine using a fiber optics communications cable that leads back up to the helicopter. Using sonar and low-light video, it locates the mine, and is then instructed to shoot a shaped charge explosive to detonate it. In April 2016, BAE was awarded a contract to build and deliver the ROVs.

==Operational history==

===U.S. Navy===

The Navy received the first production SH-60B in February 1983 and assigned it to squadron HSL-41. The helicopter entered service in 1984, and began its first deployment in 1985.
The SH-60F entered operational service on 22 June 1989 with Helicopter Antisubmarine Squadron 10 (HS-10) at NAS North Island. SH-60F squadrons planned to shift from the SH-60F to the MH-60S from 2005 to 2011 and were to be redesignated Helicopter Sea Combat (HSC).

As one of the two squadrons in the US Navy dedicated to Naval Special Warfare support and combat search and rescue, the HCS-5 Firehawks squadron deployed to Iraq for Operation Iraqi Freedom in March 2003. The squadron completed 900 combat air missions and over 1,700 combat flight hours. The majority of their flights in the Iraqi theater supported special operations ground forces missions.
A west coast Fleet Replacement Squadron (FRS), Helicopter Maritime Strike Squadron (HSM) 41, received the MH-60R aircraft in December 2005 and began training the first set of pilots. In 2007, the R-model successfully underwent final testing for incorporation into the fleet. In August 2008, the first 11 combat-ready Romeos arrived at HSM-71, a squadron assigned to the carrier . The primary missions of the MH-60R are anti-surface and anti-submarine warfare. According to Lockheed Martin, &quot;secondary missions include search and rescue, vertical replenishment, naval surface fire support, logistics support, personnel transport, medical evacuation and communications and data relay.&quot;

HSL squadrons in the US have been incrementally transitioning to the MH-60R and have nearly completed the transition. The first MH-60Rs in Japan arrived in October 2012. The recipient was HSM-51, the Navy&#x27;s forward–deployed LAMPS squadron, home based in Atsugi, Japan. The Warlords transitioned from the SH-60B throughout 2013, and shifted each detachment to the new aircraft as they returned from deployments. HSM-51 will have all MH-60R aircraft at the end of 2013. The Warlords are joined by the Saberhawks of HSM-77.

On 23 July 2013, Sikorsky delivered the 400th MH-60, an MH-60R, to the U.S. Navy. This included 166 MH-60R versions and 234 MH-60S versions. The MH-60S is in production until 2015 and will total a fleet of 275 aircraft, and the MH-60R is in production until 2017 and will total a fleet of 291 aircraft. The two models have flown 660,000 flight hours. Seahawk helicopters are to remain in Navy service into the 2030s.

The SH-60B Seahawk completed its last active-duty deployment for the U.S. Navy in late April 2015 after a seven-month deployment aboard . After 32 years and over 3.6 million hours of service, the SH-60B was formally retired from U.S. Navy service during a ceremony on 11 May 2015 at Naval Air Station North Island. In late November 2015 returned from its deployment, ending the last active-duty operational deployment of both the SH-60F and HH-60H. The models are to be transferred to other squadrons or placed in storage.

=== Indian Navy ===
In February 2011, India selected the S-70B over the NHIndustries NH90 for an acquisition of 16 multirole helicopters for the Indian Navy to replace its aging Westland Sea King fleet. India selected the Seahawk for procurement in November 2014. In June 2017, India&#x27;s Ministry of Defence terminated the procurement program over a pricing issue. Then in August 2018, India&#x27;s Defence Ministry approved the purchase of 24 MH-60R helicopters. In April 2019, the US Defense Security Cooperation Agency approved sale of 24 MH-60R anti-submarine helicopters to India for US$2.6 bn and notified Congress of the proposed sale.

India signed a contract for the MH-60Rs in February 2020. These helicopters are to aid in detecting and destroying enemy submarines prowling in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR). On 16 July 2021, the U.S. Navy handed over the first two MH-60Rs to the Indian Navy at Naval Air Station North Island, San Diego. In December 2023, it qas reported that the 6th helicopter was delivered to the Navy. At least four were commissioned on 6 March 2024, in the presence of Defense Minister Rajnath Singh at their planned home base of INS Garuda in Kochi. They is formed the INAS 334 Naval Squadron and will be under the command of Captain M Abhishek Ram.

The MH-60Rs have been integrated with the Navy&#x27;s aircraft carrier INS Vikrant. The new helicopters can be used for rescue operations, especially in night search and rescue missions, as they have night vision goggles and forward-looking infrared facilities. They participated in the Exercise Milan-2024 held by the Navy.

On 24 August 2024, Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) approved a possible order worth $52.8 million for sonobuoys and related equipment. The deal includes the sale of 3 types of High Altitude Anti-Submarine Warfare (HAASW) sonobuoys including AN/SSQ-53G/O, AN/SSQ-62F, and AN/SSQ-36 sonobuoys may be a part of the deal. The sonobuoys are to be integrated onboard MH-60R for ASW operations. The Indian Navy is planning to acquire over 500 anti-submarine sonobuoys for the MH-60 fleet. On 6 October 2024, DSCA further cleared the possible sale of 53 aircraft-launched MK 54 MOD 0 Lightweight Torpedo all up rounds for its MH-60R fleet and associated equipment and support, including “in-country torpedo training”.

As per Ministry of Defence reports on 26 December 2024, the first nine helicopters were delivered and put into service on the fleet ships. The helicopters took part in exercises like MALABAR, SIMBEX and MILAN 24 in the year.

The Royal Australian Navy (RAN) ordered 16 S-70B-2s which were delivered in 1988 and 1989. In December 2017, the S-70B-2s were retired from service. The S-70B-2 served extensively in the Middle East, embarked on the &quot;Adelaide&quot;-class and the &quot;Anzac&quot;-class frigates. 11 S-70B-2 were sold to Skyline Aviation Group. Under Project AIR 9000 Phase 8, the MH-60R competed with the NHIndustries NH90 to replace the S-70B-2. In June 2011, the MH-60R was selected to replace the S-70B-2. 24 MH-60Rs were ordered to be equipped with the Mark 54 and the Hellfire with deliveries commencing in mid-2014. The US approved a Foreign Military Sale of 24 MH-60Rs in July 2010. The first MH-60R was delivered to the RAN in 2013 and the last was delivered in 2016. In 2018, Australia signed a 10-year agreement with the US Navy to support the MH-60R. The Department of Defence in the &quot;2020 Force Structure Plan&quot; reported it planned to expand and rationalise the RAN&#x27;s MRH-90 Taipan fleet used for support and logistics. In October 2021, the US approved a Foreign Military Sale to Australia of 12 MH-60Rs. In May 2022, the Australian government announced that it would purchase 12 MH-60Rs to replace the MRH-90 fleet. The government placed the order in September 2022.

The Royal Danish Navy (RDN) put the MH-60R on a short list for a requirement of around 12 new naval helicopters, together with the NH90/NFH, H-92, AW159 and AW101. The Request For Proposal was issued in September 2010. In November 2010, Denmark requested approval for a possible purchase of 12 MH-60Rs through a Foreign Military Sale. In November 2012, Denmark selected 9 MH-60Rs to replace its 7 aging Lynx helicopters. In October 2015, the US Navy accepted two mission ready MH-60R helicopters for Denmark.

<text>Darmstadt-Dieburg is a Kreis (district) in the south of Hesse, Germany. Neighboring districts are Offenbach, Aschaffenburg, Miltenberg, Odenwaldkreis, Bergstraße, Groß-Gerau, and the district-free city of Darmstadt, which it surrounds.

==History==
The district was created in 1975 by merging the previous districts of Darmstadt and Dieburg. In 1963 the district was twinned with the district of North East Derbyshire, England, in 1990 with the district Zwickauer Land in Saxony, Germany, and in 1995 with the Mladá Boleslav region in the Czech Republic.

==Geography==
The district is located in the Odenwald mountains. Most famous in the district is the Messel Pit, where many fossils in the oil shale of a Tertiary lake were found. The site is listed in the UNESCO world heritage list since 1995.

== Coat of arms ==
The coat of arms show a lion in the top part, taken from the coat of arms of the counts of Katzenelnbogen. The lion holds a Wheel of Mainz, the symbol of state of Mainz. Both owned big parts of the districts area in the past. The 23 stars in the bottom represent the municipalities of the county.

<text>Mary Gaskell Gillick ( Tutin; 1881 – 27 January 1965) was a sculptor and medallist, best known for her effigy of Elizabeth II used on coinage in the United Kingdom and elsewhere from 1953 to 1970.
==Personal life==
Born Mary Gaskell Tutin in Nottingham, she was the eldest of three children born to Thomas Tutin and Elizabeth Gaskell ( Ardern), who wed on 25 March 1880 in Knutsford, Cheshire.

She was educated at the Nottingham School of Art (1898–1902) and at the Royal College of Art (1902–1904), where she studied under the sculptor Édouard Lantéri.

After making her first exhibition at the Royal Academy in 1911, she designed several medals to be used as awards, and several other, larger relief sculptures in stone and bronze including the stone commemorative sculpture, Crosby Hall, Chelsea 1926

In 1905, she married sculptor Ernest Gillick.

==Honours==
She was appointed OBE in the 1953 Coronation Honours.

==Effigy of Elizabeth II==

In 1952, Gillick&#x27;s effigy design was selected from a field of seventeen to be used on general-circulation coinage for the new Queen Elizabeth, first issued in 1953. Gillick worked on the portrait between March and October 1952, with one sitting and close supervision by the Duke of Edinburgh. Gillick&#x27;s design was notable for portraying the Queen uncrowned, and was the last to be used on the pre-decimal coinage.

Gillick&#x27;s die master had insufficient relief, and the striking was too weak. Facial features and the dress folds in the shoulder disappeared. The problem was solved by re-cutting the dies. This remastering was performed by Cecil Thomas, an experienced medallist who had already crafted overseas currencies featuring Elizabeth II, but who had initially been turned down for the British coinage in preference to Gillick.

A cameo of Gillick&#x27;s effigy of the Queen has been used on British commemorative stamps from 1966 to 9 March 2023; the original effigy was also used for Maundy money until the Queen&#x27;s death in 2022.

<text>Psalodon is an extinct genus of North American mammal that lived during the Upper Jurassic period. It&#x27;s a member of the family Allodontidae within the order Multituberculata.

==Biostratigraphy==
Present in stratigraphic zones 2 and 5.

==Species==
&quot;Psalodon fortis&quot; was named by Othniel Charles Marsh in 1887 and G. G. Simpson in 1927. It is also known as &quot;Allodon fortis&quot; (Marsh 1887). Remains have been found in the Upper Jurassic Morrison Formation of Wyoming (United States). The holotype is at the Peabody Museum of Natural History at Yale University.

&quot;Psalodon marshi&quot; was named by Simpson G.G. in 1929. All of the remains came from the Morrison Formation of Wyoming.

&quot;Psalodon potens&quot; was named by Marsh O.C. in 1887 and Simpson G.G. in 1927. It is also known as &quot;Ctenacodon potens&quot; (Marsh 1887). The remains assigned to this species were also found in the Morrison Formation of Wyoming and the holotype is also at Yale.

Included are deaths attributable to coalition and insurgent military action, sectarian violence and criminal violence, which refers to excess civilian deaths caused by criminal action resulting from the breakdown in law and order which followed the coalition invasion. As of February 2019, the IBC has recorded 183,249 – 205,785 civilian deaths. The IBC has a media-centered approach to counting and documenting the deaths. Other sources have provided differing estimates of deaths, some much higher. See Casualties of the Iraq War.

The project uses reports from English-language news media (including Arabic media translated into English), NGO-based reports, and official records that have been released into the public sphere to compile a running total. On its database page the IBC states: &quot;Gaps in recording and reporting suggest that even our highest totals to date may be missing many civilian deaths from violence.&quot; The group is staffed by volunteers consisting mainly of academics and activists based in the UK and the US. The project was founded by John Sloboda and Hamit Dardagan.

According to Jonathan Steele, writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, IBC &quot;is widely considered as the most reliable database of Iraqi civilian deaths&quot;. But some researchers regard it at best as a floor, or baseline for mortality, and that it underestimates actual mortality by potentially several factors.

==Project statement==
The IBC overview page states:
&quot;This is an ongoing human security project which maintains and updates the world&#x27;s only independent and comprehensive public database of media-reported civilian deaths in Iraq that have resulted from the 2003 military intervention by the USA and its allies. The count includes civilian deaths caused by coalition military action and by military or paramilitary responses to the coalition presence (e.g. insurgent and terrorist attacks). It also includes excess civilian deaths caused by criminal action resulting from the breakdown in law and order which followed the coalition invasion.&quot;
The project quotes the top US general in Iraq, Tommy Franks, as saying &quot;We don&#x27;t do body counts&quot;. Franks gave this terse answer (&quot;You know we don&#x27;t do body counts&quot;) at Bagram Air Base in answer to journalists&#x27; questions on counting casualties during Operation Anaconda in Afghanistan.

==Method==
The IBC overview page states: &quot;Deaths in the database are derived from a comprehensive survey of commercial media and NGO-based reports, along with official records that have been released into the public sphere. Reports range from specific, incident based accounts to figures from hospitals, morgues, and other documentary data-gathering agencies.&quot;

Project volunteers sample news stories to extract minimum and maximum numbers of civilian casualties. Each incident reported at least by two independent news sources is included in the Iraq Body Count database. In December 2007, IBC announced that they would begin to include deaths reported by one source, and that the number of deaths provided by such reports would be openly tracked on its database page. Between 3.3 and 3.5 percent of deaths recorded by IBC are currently listed on the database page as derived from a single source.

IBC is purely a civilian count. IBC defines &quot;civilian&quot; to exclude Iraqi soldiers, insurgents, suicide bombers or any others directly engaged in war-related violence. A &quot;min&quot; and &quot;max&quot; figure are used where reports differ on the numbers killed, or where the civilian status of the dead is uncertain.

IBC is not an &quot;estimate&quot; of total civilian deaths based on projections or other forms of extrapolation. It is a compilation of documented deaths, as reported by English-language media worldwide. See the sources section farther down for more info on the media and their sources.

Some have suggested bias of sources could affect the count. If a number is quoted from an anti-coalition source, and the Allies fail to give a sufficiently specific alternate number, the anti-coalition figure is entered into IBC&#x27;s database as both a maximum and a minimum. The same works vice versa. The project argues that these potential over- and undercounts by different media sources would tend to balance out.

IBC&#x27;s online database shows the newspaper, magazine or website where each number is reported, and the date on which it was reported. However, this has been criticized as insufficient because it typically does not list the original sources for the information: that is, the NGO, journalist or government responsible for the number presented. Hence, any inherent bias due to the lack of reliable reports from independent or Allied sources is not readily available to the reader.

==Sources==
The IBC overview page states that its sources include &quot;public domain newsgathering agencies with web access&quot;. They include sources that are from sites updated at least once a day, are &quot;separately archived on the site, with a unique URL&quot;, are &quot;widely cited or referenced by other sources&quot;, are in English, and have &quot;fully public (preferably free) web-access&quot;

Primary sources used by the media are listed in the 2003 to 2005 IBC report. The sources are followed by the number of deaths reported from that source.

* Mortuaries. 8,913
* Medics. 4,846
* Iraqi officials. 4,376
* Eyewitnesses. 3,794
* Police. 3,588
* Relatives. 2,780
* US-Coalition. 2,423
* Journalists. 1,976
* NGOs. 732
* Friends/Associates. 596
* Other. 196

==Web counters==
The IBC overview page states: &quot;Results and totals are continually updated and made immediately available here and on various IBC web counters which may be freely displayed on any website or homepage, where they are automatically updated without further intervention.&quot;

==Body counts change over time==
Civilian deaths in the Iraq war ():

The figures above are those that appeared in real time on the IBC counters on or around those dates. However, those in the first line were increased radically in the following days and weeks. IBC&#x27;s current Max figure for the entire invasion phase, up to 30 April 2003, now stands at 7,299. Because IBC performs analyses (e.g., accounts for multiple reports, eliminates overlaps, etc.), there is always a delay between the date on which incidents occur and the addition of their numbers to the IBC database. Another factor is that some reports emerge weeks or even months later – for instance the emergence of Baghdad city morgue reports for 2005 in early 2006. The 6 December line above was taken from the IBC total as it stood on 6 December 2005, but the emergence of the morgue figures later increased IBC&#x27;s figures for that period to 31,818–35,747. The majority of civilians death from 2003 to 2011 were attributed to unknown actors.

== Cumulative updated body counts table ==
Following are the yearly IBC Project violent civilian death totals, broken down by month from the beginning of 2003. Table below is copied irregularly from the source page, and is soon out-of-date as data is continually updated at the source. As of 12 June 2023 the top of the IBC database page with the table says 186,901 – 210,296 &quot;Documented civilian deaths from violence&quot;. That page also says: &quot;Gaps in recording and reporting suggest that even our highest totals to date may be missing many civilian deaths from violence.&quot;


==2006==
The Iraq Body Count project states for the week ending 31 December 2006: &quot;It was a truly violent year, as around 24,000 civilians lost their lives in Iraq. This was a massive rise in violence: 14,000 had been killed in 2005, 10,500 in 2004 and just under 12,000 in 2003 (7,000 of them killed during the actual war, while only 5,000 killed during the &#x27;peace&#x27; that followed in May 2003). In December 2006 alone around 2,800 civilians were reported killed. This week there were over 560 civilian deaths reported.&quot;

From the above quote here are IBC yearly death totals (not counting the initial 7000 invasion deaths):

*2003: 5,000
*2004: 10,500
*2005: 14,000
*2006: 24,000

==March 2003 to March 2005 report==
The IBC released a report detailing the civilian deaths it had recorded between 20 March 2003 and 19 March 2005. From page 26: &quot;The analyses in this dossier cover the first two years of the military intervention in Iraq from 20 March 2003 to 19 March 2005, and are based on data which was available by 14 June 2005.&quot;

The report says the US and its allies were responsible for the largest share (37%) of the 24,865 deaths. The remaining deaths were attributed to anti-occupation forces (9%), crime (36%), and unknown agents (11%).

Who did the killing?

*37%. US-led forces killed 37% of civilian victims.
*9%. Anti-occupation forces/insurgents killed 9% of civilian victims.
*36%. Post-invasion criminal violence accounted for 36% of all deaths.
*11%. Unknown agents (11%).

:Killings by anti-occupation forces, crime and unknown agents have shown a steady rise over the entire period.

Who was killed?

*24,865 civilians were reported killed in the first two years.
*Men accounted for over 80% of all civilian deaths.
*Baghdad alone recorded almost half of all deaths.

When did they die?

*30% of civilian deaths occurred during the invasion phase before 1 May 2003.
*Post-invasion, the number of civilians killed was almost twice as high in year two (11,351) as in year one (6,215).

What was the most lethal weaponry?

*Over half (53%) of all civilian deaths involved explosive devices.
*Air strikes caused most (64%) of the explosives deaths.
*Children were disproportionately affected by all explosive devices but most severely by air strikes and unexploded ordnance (including cluster bomblets).

How many were injured?

*At least 42,500 civilians were reported wounded.
*The invasion phase caused 41% of all reported injuries.
*Explosive weaponry caused a higher ratio of injuries to deaths than small arms.
*The highest wounded-to-death ratio incidents occurred during the invasion phase.

==Iraq War Logs==

In October 2010, the group &quot;WikiLeaks&quot; released the Iraq War Logs, a set of nearly 400,000 classified US military documents on the Iraq war. IBC was among several media organizations and NGO&#x27;s given pre-release access to the documents, and IBC co-founder John Sloboda delivered a speech at the press conference for the release by &quot;WikiLeaks&quot;.

IBC published three pieces on their website detailing their analysis of the war logs. Among the main findings were that the war logs, &quot;contain an estimated 15,000 previously unknown civilian deaths,&quot; and that addition of the new material would suggest that, &quot;over 150,000 violent deaths have been recorded since March 2003, with more than 122,000 (80%) of them civilian.&quot;

==Academic publications==

Between 2009 and 2011, IBC published three papers in peer reviewed academic journals, co-authored with researchers from King&#x27;s College London and Royal Holloway, University of London. Each paper uses IBC data to evaluate different aspects of civilian casualties during the war.

The first paper, published in the New England Journal of Medicine in April 2009, analyses civilian deaths between 2003 and 2008 according to weapon types used. Among the findings were that, &quot;execution after abduction or capture was the single most common form of death overall,&quot; and that, &quot;events involving air attacks and mortar fire were the most dangerous&quot; to Iraqi females and children.

The second paper, published in &quot;PLoS Medicine&quot; in February 2011, analyses civilian deaths between 2003 and 2008 according to perpetrator, weapon, time, and location. The paper found that most deaths during the period were, &quot;inflicted by unknown perpetrators, primarily through extrajudicial executions.&quot; The paper also utilized what the authors refer to as the &quot;Dirty War Index&quot; which evaluates the behavior of different perpetrators or weapon types in terms of the proportion of women and children killed, with higher DWI ratios suggesting tactics or weapons that are more indiscriminate toward civilians. The study found that unknown perpetrators firing mortars had the highest DWI ratio, followed by Coalition Forces air attacks, leading the authors to advise that such weapons should not be used in populated areas.

The third paper, published in September, 2011, in a special edition of &quot;The Lancet&quot; for the 10 year anniversary of the September 11 attacks of 2001, focused on casualties of both civilians and Coalition soldiers specifically by suicide bomb attacks in Iraq between 2003 and 2010. This paper found that there had been at least 12,284 Iraqi civilians and 200 Coalition soldiers killed in at least 1,003 suicide bombings during the period. The study also found that these bombings had &quot;injured no fewer than 30,644 Iraqi civilians,&quot; and that, &quot;children are less likely to survive their suicide bomb injuries than adults.&quot;

== Criticisms and counter-criticisms ==
The IBC has received criticism from many sides. Some critics have focused on potential bias of sources. Others have raised concerns about the difficulty of distinguishing civilians from combatants. Others have criticized it for over or undercounting.

Some critics, often on the political right, claimed that the IBC numbers were an overcount, and that the numbers were suspect due to the antiwar bias of the IBC members. For example; 26 July 2005 &quot;National Review&quot; article, &quot;Bad Counts. An unquestioning media.&quot;

Others, often on the political left, criticized media and government willingness to quote IBC figures more approvingly than the much higher estimate coming from the Lancet study that came out in October 2004.

Journalists included Lila Guterman, John Pilger, and George Monbiot

In a 27 January 2005 article in &quot;The Chronicle of Higher Education&quot; Lila Guterman wrote:

The Lancet released the paper on 29 October, the Friday before the election, when many reporters were busy with political coverage. That day, the Los Angeles Times and the Chicago Tribune each dedicated only about 400 words to the study and placed the articles inside their front sections, on Pages A4 and A11, respectively. (The news media in Europe gave the study much more play; many newspapers put articles about it on their front pages.) In a short article about the study on Page A8, The New York Times noted that the Iraq Body Count, a project to tally civilian deaths reported in the news media, had put the maximum death toll at around 17,000. The new study, the article said, &#x27;is certain to generate intense controversy.&#x27; But the Times has not published any further news articles about the paper.

This view of IBC was based on the belief that IBC figures are extremely low due to pro-US media bias and inadequate reporting due to its heavy (though not exclusive) reliance on Western media sources, which has led some of these critics to claim IBC should be called the &quot;Iraq Western Media Body Count&quot;. These biases and inadequacies, they claim, mean IBC&#x27;s count is low by up to a factor of 10, and that it specifically minimizes the proportion of deaths caused by US forces.

Stephen Soldz wrote a 5 February 2006 article titled &quot;When Promoting Truth Obscures the Truth: More on Iraqi Body Count and Iraqi Deaths&quot;. It stated: &quot;Of course, in conditions of active rebellion, the safer areas accessible to Western reporters are likely to be those under US/Coalition control, where deaths are, in turn, likely to be due to insurgent attacks. Areas of insurgent control, which are likely to be subject to US and Iraqi government attack, for example most of Anbar province, are simply off-limits to these reporters. Thus, the realities of reporting imply that reporters will be witness to a larger fraction of deaths due to insurgents and a lesser proportion of deaths due to US and Iraqi government forces.&quot;

A further claim has been that IBC does little or nothing to correct misuse of their figures by public officials or media organizations. It is claimed that the media often misuse IBC&#x27;s estimate of the total number dead. It is also claimed that the media use the IBC&#x27;s estimate in order to ignore or downplay the October 2004 excess mortality study published in the Lancet Medical Journal, which estimated a far higher figure. Critics of IBC argue that the Lancet study is the most accurate estimate so far and is more reliable than IBC&#x27;s estimate.

Other criticism of various kinds came from journalists Stephen Soldz, Dahr Jamail, and Jeff Pflueger

In April 2006, IBC published a lengthy response to their critics entitled &quot;Speculation is no substitute: a defence of Iraq Body Count&quot;. In their reply, IBC argues that their critics have several key facts wrong. IBC argues that while their estimate is likely to be below the full toll, their critics&#x27; errors have led the critics to exaggerate the likely extent of such an undercount. Finally, IBC argues, the available evidence does not support their critics&#x27; claims of a pro-US bias infecting the IBC database.

===English-language versus Arabic-language media sources===
The IBC report for March 2003 to March 2005 states: &quot;We have not made use of Arabic or other non-English language sources, except where these have been published in English. The reasons are pragmatic. We consider fluency in the language of the published report to be a key requirement for accurate analysis, and English is the only language in which all team members are fluent. It is possible that our count has excluded some victims as a result.&quot;

Stephen Soldz, who runs the website &quot;Iraq Occupation and Resistance Report&quot;, writes in a 5 February 2006 &quot;ZNet&quot; article (in reference to the 2003-2005 IBC report): &quot;Given, as indicated in that report, that ten media outlets provided over half the IBC reports and three agencies [Associated Press, Agence France Presse, and Reuters] provided over a third of the reports, there is simply no reason to believe that even a large fraction of Iraqi civilian combat-related deaths are ever reported in the Western media, much less, have the two independent reports necessary to be recorded in the IBC database. Do these few agencies really have enough Iraqi reporters on retainer to cover the country? Are these reporters really able comprehensively to cover deaths in insurgent-held parts of Iraq? How likely is it that two reporters from distinct media outlets are going to be present at a given site where deaths occur? How many of the thousands of US bombings have been investigated by any reporter, Western or Iraqi? Simply to state these questions is to emphasize the fragmentary nature of the reporting that occurs and thus the limitations of the IBC database.&quot;

In a 28 April 2006 BBC &quot;Newsnight&quot; interview the IBC project&#x27;s co-founder John Sloboda, in response to these and similar arguments, has said: &quot;we have never had over the entire three years, anyone show us an Arabic source that reports deaths that we haven&#x27;t already got. In three years. In thousands of incidents. There are organisations that translate Arabic reports into English, and we see their data.&quot;

IBC monitors many Arabic sources that either publish in English as well as Arabic, or are translated by other sources. Some of these include:

Al Arabiya TV, Al-Furat, Al-Ittihad, Al Jazeera (Web), Al Jazeera TV, Al Sharqiyah TV, Al-Taakhi, Al-Bawaba, Arab News, Arabic News, Asharq Al Awsat, As-Sabah, Arab Times, Bahrain News Agency, Bahrain Times.

===Undercounting===

The IBC acknowledges on its website that its count is bound to be low due to limitations in reporting stating; &quot;many if not most civilian casualties will go unreported by the media. That is the sad nature of war.&quot; IBC&#x27;s critics claim, though, that the IBC does not do enough to indicate what they believe is the full extent of the undercounting. IBC has directly disputed these claims in a lengthy document on its website.

One criticism of IBC&#x27;s method, from MIT&#x27;s John Tirman, a principal research scientist, is that the &quot;surveillance instrument&quot; – the news media – is changing all the time: media organizations add or (more likely) subtract reporters from the field, which was happening in Iraq; reporters were largely confined to Baghdad during the worst violence; and reporters tended to write about spectacular events, like car bombs, when much of the violence was in the form of revenge killings throughout Iraq. &quot;As a result, this technique of totaling up the dead is incapable of accounting for the deaths that were not being recorded, whether by the English-language news media or the chaotic health care system.&quot; IBC itself radically changed its method in the middle of the war, switching from two references to one reference in the news media.

The October 2006 &quot;Lancet&quot; study states: &quot;Aside from Bosnia, we can find no conflict situation where passive surveillance recorded more than 20% of the deaths measured by population-based methods.&quot;

In an April 2006 article the IBC had described an example comparing itself to the 2004 United Nations Development Programme Iraq Living Conditions Survey (ILCS). &quot;The Lancet&quot; report uses the population estimates drawn from the ILCS study, while not mentioning its estimate of war-related deaths. IBC contends that ILCS is a more reliable indicator of violent deaths than the &quot;Lancet&quot; study, and suggests a much lower number than the &quot;Lancet&quot; study.

However, a supplement to the &quot;Lancet&quot; study published separately by its authors, as well as subsequent interviews with one of Lancet&#x27;s authors have disputed the methodology and results of the ILCS study. On the other hand, Jon Pedersen, author of the ILCS study, has disputed the methodology and results of the Lancet study. For more info on this controversy see the sections titled &quot;Criticisms&quot; and &quot;UNDP ILCS study compared to Lancet study&quot; in Lancet surveys of Iraq War casualties.

The 2006 Lancet study also states: &quot;In several outbreaks, disease and death recorded by facility-based methods underestimated events by a factor of ten or more when compared with population-based estimates. Between 1960 and 1990, newspaper accounts of political deaths in Guatemala correctly reported over 50% of deaths in years of low violence but less than 5% in years of highest violence.&quot;

&quot;The Lancet&quot; reference used is to Patrick Ball, Paul Kobrak, and Herbert F. Spirer and their 1999 book, &quot;State Violence in Guatemala, 1960-1996: A Quantitative Reflection&quot;. From the introduction: &quot;The CIIDH database consists of cases culled from direct testimonies and documentary and press sources.&quot;

Chapter 10 elaborates, saying that &quot;In the CIIDH project, participating popular organizations collected many of the testimonies long after the time of the killings, when people were less clear about details, especially the identities of all the victims.&quot; And says, &quot;Typically, during the collection of testimonies, a surviving witness might provide the names of one or two victims, perhaps close relatives, while estimating the number of other neighbors in the community without giving their names.&quot;

They report in chapter 7:

Figure 7.1 shows that in the CIIDH database, most of the information for human rights violations prior to 1977 comes from press sources. ... Approximately 10,890 cases were coded from the newspapers. Sixty-three percent of the press cases were taken from Prensa Libre, 10 percent from El Gráfico, 8 percent from La Hora and El Impacto respectively, and 6 percent from El Imparcial. The remaining 5 percent is made up by eight other newspapers.

But also in chapter 7 they reported that in later, more violent years:

When the level of violence increased dramatically in the late 1970s and early 1980s, numbers of reported violations in the press stayed very low. In 1981, one of the worst years of state violence, the numbers fall towards zero. The press reported almost none of the rural violence.

There is a list of figures, tables, and charts in the book that can be used to calculate what percentage of their cases of killings by state forces were reported by 13 Guatemalan newspapers for each year when compared to the testimonies of witnesses (as previously described from chapter 10).

In a 7 November 2004 press release concerning the October 2004 &quot;Lancet&quot; study the IBC states: &quot;We have always been quite explicit that our own total is certain to be an underestimate of the true position, because of gaps in reporting or recording&quot;.

One of the sources used by the media is morgues. Only the central Baghdad area morgue has released figures consistently. While that is the largest morgue in Iraq and in what is often claimed to be the most consistently violent area, the absence of comprehensive morgue figures elsewhere leads to undercounting. IBC makes it clear that, due to these issues, its count will almost certainly be below the full toll in its &#x27;Quick FAQ&#x27; on its homepage.

Quote from an IBC note: &quot;The Iraq Body Count (IBC) estimate for x350, like that for x334, was made possible by examination of the detailed data supplied to the Associated Press (AP) by the morgues surveyed in AP&#x27;s 23 May 2004 survey of Iraqi morgues.&quot;

That 23 May 2004 Associated Press article points out the lack of morgue data from many areas of Iraq. Also, it states: &quot;The [Baghdad] figure does not include most people killed in big terrorist bombings, Hassan said. The cause of death in such cases is obvious so bodies are usually not taken to the morgue, but given directly to victims&#x27; families. Also, the bodies of killed fighters from groups like the al-Mahdi Army are rarely taken to morgues.&quot;

<text>Zofiabaatar is a genus of extinct mammal from the Upper Jurassic period. It was a relatively early member of the extinct order Multituberculata within the suborder &quot;Plagiaulacida&quot;. It lived in North America along with dinosaurs such as &quot;Diplodocus&quot; and &quot;Allosaurus&quot;.

The primary species is &quot;Zofiabaatar pulcher&quot;. Fossils have been found in the Upper Jurassic Morrison Formation of Wyoming (U.S.). The animal was reportedly about long. It seems to have been a rather specialized creature, judging by the dentary. Zofiabaataridae are believed to belong to the allodontid line.

It is present in stratigraphic zone 6.

The species is named after the Polish paleontologist Zofia Kielan-Jaworowska.

<text>Glirodon is a genus of extinct mammal from the Upper Jurassic. It was a relatively early member of the also-extinct order of Multituberculata, suborder &quot;Plagiaulacida&quot;. These mammals lived in North America during the Mesozoic, also known as the &quot;age of the dinosaurs&quot;.

The genus &quot;Glirodon&quot; has been described by Engelmann G.F. and Callison G. (1999) from a &#x27;gliriform tooth&#x27;.

The species &quot;Glirodon grandis&quot;, also described by Engelmann and Callison, has been found in the Upper Jurassic formations of Dinosaur National Monument in Utah (United States). Other than being a large, early American Multituberculate, (see Multituberculata), the nature of this beast is somewhat unclear. It is an &quot;allodontid (two families and the genus &quot;Glirodon&quot;)&quot;, (Kielan-Jaworowska and Hurum, 2001). It had gliriform incisors; incisors with the &quot;enamel reduced to a stripe on the front side.&quot; Apparently, this condition evolved several times among Multituberculates.

It is based on a portion of snout. &quot;&quot;Glirodon&quot; retains the plesiomorphic &#x27;plagiaulacidan&#x27; (&quot;Plagiaulacida&quot;) dental formula and shares with Allodontidae the structure of the upper premolars (Pl.1 fis 2-4). It differs from the Paulchoffatiidae and Plagiaulacidae in having a single-cusped I3,&quot; (Kielan-Jaworowska &amp; Hurum, 2001, p. 401-402). I3 refers to an upper incisor and &#x27;plesiomorphic&#x27; means &#x27;basal&#x27;.

Present in stratigraphic zones 4 and 6.

<text>Paulchoffatia is a genus of extinct mammal of the Upper Jurassic - Lower Cretaceous. It was a relatively early member of the also extinct order Multituberculata, within the suborder &quot;Plagiaulacida&quot; and family Paulchoffatiidae. It lived in Europe during the &quot;age of the dinosaurs.&quot;

The genus &quot;Paulchoffatia&quot; (&quot;for Paul Choffat&quot;) was named by Kühne W.G. in 1961 based on a single species. It is also known as &quot;Paulchoffia&quot;. &quot;Paulchoffatia&quot; is characterized by a massive Corpus mandibulae (the part of the jaw below the tooth row), a rounded lower margin of the jaw and a massive, only slightly curved and steeply inclined incisor with a short root&quot;, (Hahn &amp; Hahn 2000, p. 105). The name honours the geologist Paul Choffat (1849–1919).

Remains of the species &quot;Paulchoffatia delgadoi&quot; were found in the Kimmeridgian (Upper Jurassic)-age strata of Guimarota, Portugal. The skull probably had a length of 2.5 cm. This taxon is based on five lower jaw fossils. Further material of this genus, though very possibly not this species, has been reported from the Lower Cretaceous location of Galve, Spain.

<text>The participation of Italy in the Second World War was characterized by a complex framework of ideology, politics, and diplomacy, while its military actions were often heavily influenced by external factors. Italy joined the war as one of the Axis Powers in 1940 (as the French Third Republic surrendered) with a plan to concentrate Italian forces on a major offensive against the British Empire in Africa and the Middle East, known as the &quot;parallel war&quot;, while expecting the collapse of British forces in the European theatre. The Italians bombed Mandatory Palestine, invaded Egypt and occupied British Somaliland with initial success. However, the British counterattacked, eventually necessitating German support to prevent an Italian collapse in North Africa. As the war carried on and German and Japanese actions in 1941 led to the entry of the Soviet Union and United States, respectively, into the war, the Italian plan of forcing Britain to agree to a negotiated peace settlement was foiled.

The Italian dictator Benito Mussolini was aware that Fascist Italy was not ready for a long conflict, as its resources were reduced by successful but costly pre-war conflicts: the pacification of Libya (which was undergoing Italian settlement), intervention in Spain (where a friendly fascist regime had been installed), and the invasions of Ethiopia and Albania. However, he opted to remain in the war as the imperial ambitions of the Fascist regime, which aspired to restore the Roman Empire in the Mediterranean (the &quot;Mare Nostrum&quot;), were partially met by late 1942, albeit with some German assistance.

With the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia and the Balkans, Italy annexed Ljubljana, Dalmatia and Montenegro. Puppet regimes were also established in Croatia and Greece, which were occupied by Italian forces. Following Vichy France&#x27;s collapse and the Case Anton, Italy occupied the French territories of Corsica and Tunisia. Italian forces had also achieved victories against insurgents in Yugoslavia and in Montenegro, and Italo-German forces had occupied parts of British-held Egypt on their push to El-Alamein after their victory at Gazala.

However, Italy&#x27;s conquests were always heavily contested, both by various insurgencies (most prominently the Greek resistance and Yugoslav partisans) and Allied military forces, which waged the Battle of the Mediterranean throughout and beyond Italy&#x27;s participation. The country&#x27;s imperial overstretch (opening multiple fronts in Africa, the Balkans, Eastern Europe, and the Mediterranean) ultimately resulted in its defeat in the war, as the Italian empire collapsed after decisive defeats in the Eastern European and North African campaigns. In July 1943, following the Allied invasion of Sicily, Mussolini was arrested by order of King Victor Emmanuel III, provoking a civil war. Italy&#x27;s military outside of the Italian peninsula collapsed, its occupied and annexed territories falling under German control. Under Mussolini&#x27;s successor Pietro Badoglio, Italy capitulated to the Allies on 3 September 1943, although Mussolini would be rescued from captivity a week later by German forces without meeting resistance. 

On 13 October 1943, the Kingdom of Italy officially became a co-belligerent of the Allies and formally declared war on its former Axis partner Germany. The northern half of the country was occupied by the Germans with the cooperation of Italian fascists, who formed a collaborationist puppet state (soldiers, police, and militia recruited for the Axis); the south was still controlled by monarchist forces, which fought for the Allied cause as the Italian Co-Belligerent Army and Italian resistance movement partisans (many of them former Royal Italian Army soldiers) of disparate political ideologies operated all over Italy. Unlike Germany and Japan, no war crimes tribunals were held for Italian military and political leaders, though the Italian resistance summarily executed some political members at the end of the war, including Mussolini on 28 April 1945.

==Background==

===Imperial ambitions===


During the late 1920s, the Italian Prime Minister Benito Mussolini spoke with increasing urgency about imperial expansion, arguing that Italy needed an outlet for its &quot;surplus population&quot; and that it would therefore be in the best interests of other countries to aid in this expansion. The immediate aspiration of the regime was political &quot;hegemony in the Mediterranean–Danubian–Balkan region&quot;, more grandiosely Mussolini imagined the conquest &quot;of an empire stretching from the Strait of Gibraltar to the Strait of Hormuz&quot;. Balkan and Mediterranean hegemony was predicated by ancient Roman dominance in the same regions. There were designs for a protectorate over Albania and for the annexation of Dalmatia, as well as economic and military control of Yugoslavia and Greece. The regime also sought to establish protective patron–client relationships with Austria, Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria, which all lay on the outside edges of its European sphere of influence. Although it was not among his publicly proclaimed aims, Mussolini wished to challenge the supremacy of Britain and France in the Mediterranean Sea, which was considered strategically vital, since the Mediterranean was Italy&#x27;s only conduit to the Atlantic and Indian Oceans.

In 1935, Italy initiated the Second Italo-Ethiopian War, &quot;a nineteenth-century colonial campaign waged out of due time&quot;. The campaign gave rise to optimistic talk on raising a native Ethiopian army &quot;to help conquer&quot; Anglo-Egyptian Sudan. The war also marked a shift towards a more aggressive Italian foreign policy and also &quot;exposed [the] vulnerabilities&quot; of the British and French. This in turn created the opportunity Mussolini needed to begin to realize his imperial goals. In 1936, the Spanish Civil War broke out. From the beginning, Italy played an important role in the conflict. Their military contribution was so vast, that it played a decisive role in the victory of the rebel forces led by Francisco Franco. Mussolini had engaged in &quot;a full-scale external war&quot; due to the insinuation of future Spanish subservience to the Italian Empire, and as a way of placing the country on a war footing and creating &quot;a warrior culture&quot;. The aftermath of the war in Ethiopia saw a reconciliation of German-Italian relations following years of a previously strained relationship, resulting in the signing of a treaty of mutual interest in October 1936. Mussolini referred to this treaty as the creation of a Berlin-Rome Axis, which Europe would revolve around. The treaty was the result of increasing dependence on German coal following League of Nations sanctions, similar policies between the two countries over the conflict in Spain, and German sympathy towards Italy following European backlash to the Ethiopian War. The aftermath of the treaty saw the increasing ties between Italy and Germany, and Mussolini falling under Adolf Hitler&#x27;s influence from which &quot;he never escaped&quot;.

In October 1938, in the aftermath of the Munich Agreement, Italy demanded concessions from France. These included a free port at Djibouti, control of the Addis Ababa-Djibouti railroad, Italian participation in the management of Suez Canal Company, some form of French-Italian condominium over French Tunisia, and the preservation of Italian culture on Corsica with no French assimilation of the people. The French refused the demands, believing the true Italian intention was the territorial acquisition of Nice, Corsica, Tunisia, and Djibouti. On 30 November 1938, Foreign Minister Galeazzo Ciano addressed the Chamber of Deputies on the &quot;natural aspirations of the Italian people&quot; and was met with shouts of &quot;Nice! Corsica! Savoy! Tunisia! Djibouti! Malta!&quot; Later that day, Mussolini addressed the Fascist Grand Council &quot;on the subject of what he called the immediate goals of &#x27;Fascist dynamism&#x27;.&quot; These were Albania; Tunisia; Corsica; the Ticino, a canton of Switzerland; and all &quot;French territory east of the River Var&quot;, including Nice, but not Savoy.

Beginning in 1939 Mussolini often voiced his contention that Italy required uncontested access to the world&#x27;s oceans and shipping lanes to ensure its national sovereignty. On 4 February 1939, Mussolini addressed the Grand Council in a closed session. He delivered a long speech on international affairs and the goals of his foreign policy, &quot;which bears comparison with Hitler&#x27;s notorious disposition, minuted by colonel Hossbach&quot;. He began by claiming that the freedom of a country is proportional to the strength of its navy. This was followed by &quot;the familiar lament that Italy was a prisoner in the Mediterranean&quot;. He called Corsica, Tunisia, Malta, and Cyprus &quot;the bars of this prison&quot;, and described Gibraltar and Suez as the prison guards. To break British control, her bases on Cyprus, Gibraltar, Malta, and in Egypt (controlling the Suez Canal) would have to be neutralized. On 31 March, Mussolini stated that &quot;Italy will not truly be an independent nation so long as she has Corsica, Bizerta, Malta as the bars of her Mediterranean prison and Gibraltar and Suez as the walls.&quot; Fascist foreign policy took for granted that the democracies—Britain and France—would someday need to be faced down. Through armed conquest Italian North Africa and Italian East Africa—separated by the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan—would be linked, and the Mediterranean prison destroyed. Then, Italy would be able to march &quot;either to the Indian Ocean through the Sudan and Abyssinia, or to the Atlantic by way of French North Africa&quot;.

As early as September 1938, the Italian military had drawn up plans to invade Albania. On 7 April, Italian forces landed in the country and within three days had occupied the majority of the country. Albania represented a territory Italy could acquire for &quot;&#x27;living space&#x27; to ease its overpopulation&quot; as well as the foothold needed to launch other expansionist conflicts in the Balkans. On 22 May 1939, Italy and Germany signed the Pact of Steel joining both countries in a military alliance. The pact was the culmination of German-Italian relations from 1936 and was not defensive in nature. Rather, the pact was designed for a &quot;joint war against France and Britain&quot;, although the Italian hierarchy held the understanding that such a war would not take place for several years. However, despite the Italian impression, the pact made no reference to such a period of peace and the Germans proceeded with their plans to invade Poland.

===Industrial strength===

Mussolini&#x27;s Under-Secretary for War Production, Carlo Favagrossa, had estimated that Italy could not possibly be prepared for major military operations until at least October 1942. This had been made clear during the Italo-German negotiations for the Pact of Steel, whereby it was stipulated that neither signatory was to make war without the other earlier than 1943. Although considered a great power, the Italian industrial sector was relatively weak compared to other European major powers. Italian industry did not equal more than 15% of that of France or of Britain in militarily critical areas such as automobile production: the number of automobiles in Italy before the war was around 374,000, in comparison to around 2,500,000 in Britain and France. The lack of a stronger automotive industry made it difficult for Italy to mechanize its military. Italy still had a predominantly agricultural-based economy, with demographics more akin to a developing country (high illiteracy, poverty, rapid population growth and a high proportion of adolescents) and a proportion of GNP derived from industry less than that of Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Sweden, in addition to the other great powers. In terms of strategic materials, in 1940, Italy produced 4.4 megatonnes (Mt) of coal, 0.01 Mt of crude oil, 1.2 Mt of iron ore and 2.1 Mt of steel. By comparison, Great Britain produced 224.3 Mt of coal, 11.9 Mt of crude oil, 17.7 Mt of iron ore, and 13.0 Mt of steel and Germany produced 364.8 Mt of coal, 8.0 Mt of crude oil, 29.5 Mt of iron ore and 21.5 Mt of steel. Most raw material needs could be fulfilled only through importation, and no effort was made to stockpile key materials before the entry into war. Approximately one quarter of the ships of Italy&#x27;s merchant fleet were in allied ports at the outbreak of hostilities, and, given no forewarning, were immediately impounded.

===Economy===
Between 1936 and 1939, Italy had supplied the Spanish Nationalist forces, fighting under Francisco Franco during the Spanish Civil War, with large number of weapons and supplies practically free. In addition to weapons, the &quot;Corpo Truppe Volontarie&quot; (&quot;Corps of Volunteer Troops&quot;) had also been dispatched to fight for Franco. The financial cost of the war was between 6 and 8.5 billion lire, approximately 14 to 20 per cent of the country&#x27;s annual expenditure. Adding to these problems was Italy&#x27;s extreme debt position. When Benito Mussolini took office, in 1921, the government debt was 93 billion lire, un-repayable in the short to medium term. Only two years later this debt had increased to 405 billion lire.

In September 1939, Britain imposed a selective blockade of Italy. Coal from Germany, which was shipped out of Rotterdam, was declared contraband. The Germans promised to keep up shipments by train, over the Alps, and Britain offered to supply all of Italy&#x27;s needs in exchange for Italian armaments. The Italians could not agree to the latter terms without shattering their alliance with Germany. On 2 February 1940, however, Mussolini approved a draft contract with the Royal Air Force to provide 400 Caproni aircraft, yet scrapped the deal on 8 February. British intelligence officer Francis Rodd believed that Mussolini was convinced to reverse policy by German pressure in the week of 2–8 February, a view shared by the British ambassador in Rome, Percy Loraine. On 1 March, the British announced that they would block all coal exports from Rotterdam to Italy. Italian coal was one of the most discussed issues in diplomatic circles in the spring of 1940. In April, Britain began strengthening the Mediterranean Fleet to enforce the blockade. Despite French uncertainty, Britain rejected concessions to Italy so as not to &quot;create an impression of weakness&quot;. Germany supplied Italy with about one million tons of coal a month beginning in the spring of 1940, an amount that exceeded even Mussolini&#x27;s demand of August 1939 that Italy receive six million tons of coal for its first twelve months of war.

===Military===

The Italian Royal Army (&quot;Regio Esercito&quot;) was comparatively depleted and weak at the beginning of the war. Italian tanks were of poor quality and radios few in number. The bulk of Italian artillery dated to World War I. The primary fighter of the Italian Air Force (&quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot;) was the Fiat CR.42 Falco, which, though an advanced biplane with excellent performance, was technically outclassed by monoplane fighters of other nations. Of the Regia Aeronautica&#x27;s approximately 1,760 aircraft, only 900 could be considered in any way combat-worthy. The Italian Royal Navy (&quot;Regia Marina&quot;) had several modern battleships but no aircraft carriers.

Italian authorities were acutely aware of the need to modernize and were taking steps to meet the requirements of their own relatively advanced tactical principles. Almost 40% of the 1939 budget was allocated for military spending. Recognizing the Navy&#x27;s need for close air support, the decision was made to build carriers. Three series of modern fighters, capable of meeting the best allied planes on equal terms, were in development, with a few hundred of each eventually being produced. The Carro Armato P40 tank, roughly equivalent to the M4 Sherman and Panzer IV medium tanks, was designed in 1940 (though no prototype was produced until 1942 and manufacture could not commence before the Armistice, owing in part to the lack of sufficiently powerful engines, which were themselves undergoing a development push; total Italian tank production for the war – about 3,500 – was less than the number of tanks used by Germany in its invasion of France). The Italians were pioneers in the use of self-propelled guns, both in close support and anti-tank roles. Their 75/46 fixed AA/AT gun, 75/32 gun, 90/53 AA/AT gun (an equally deadly but less famous peer of the German 88/55), 47/32 AT gun, and the 20 mm AA autocannon were effective, modern weapons. Also of note were the AB 41 and the Camionetta AS 42 armoured cars, which were regarded as excellent vehicles of their type. None of these developments, however, precluded the fact that the bulk of equipment was obsolete and poor. The relatively weak economy, lack of suitable raw materials and consequent inability to produce sufficient quantities of armaments and supplies were thus the key material reasons for Italian military failure.

On paper, Italy had one of the world&#x27;s largest armies, but the reality was dramatically different. According to the estimates of Bierman and Smith, the Italian regular army could field only about 200,000 troops at the war&#x27;s beginning. Irrespective of the attempts to modernize, the majority of Italian army personnel were lightly armed infantry lacking sufficient motor transport. Not enough money was budgeted to train the men in the services, such that the bulk of personnel received much of their training at the front, too late to be of use. Air units had not been trained to operate with the naval fleet and the majority of ships had been built for fleet actions, rather than the convoy protection duties in which they were primarily employed during the war. In any event, a critical lack of fuel kept naval activities to a minimum.

Senior leadership was also a problem. Mussolini personally assumed control of all three individual military service ministries with the intention of influencing detailed planning. &quot;Comando Supremo&quot; (the Italian High Command) consisted of only a small complement of staff that could do little more than inform the individual service commands of Mussolini&#x27;s intentions, after which it was up to the individual service commands to develop proper plans and execution. The result was that there was no central direction for operations; the three military services tended to work independently, focusing only on their fields, with little inter-service cooperation. Pay discrepancies existed for personnel who were of equal rank, but from different units.

==Outbreak of the Second World War==
Nazi Germany&#x27;s invasion of Poland on 1 September 1939, marked the beginning of World War II. Despite being an Axis power, Italy remained non-belligerent until June 1940.

===Decision to intervene===
Following the German conquest of Poland, Mussolini hesitated to enter the war. General Sir Archibald Wavell, the head of Middle East Command, correctly predicted that Mussolini&#x27;s pride would ultimately cause him to enter the war. Wavell would compare Mussolini&#x27;s situation to that of someone at the top of a diving board: &quot;I think he must do something. If he cannot make a graceful dive, he will at least have to jump in somehow; he can hardly put on his dressing-gown and walk down the stairs again.&quot;

Initially, the entry into the war appeared to be political opportunism though there was some provocation. The French and British, for their part had caused Italy a long list of grievances since during WWI through the extraction of political and economic concessions and the blockading of imports. Aware of Italy&#x27;s material and planning deficiencies leading up to World War II, and believing that Italy&#x27;s entry into the war on the side of Germany was inevitable, the English blockaded German coal imports from 1 March 1940 in an attempt to bring Italian industry to a standstill. The British and the French then began amassing their naval fleets (to a twelve-to-two superiority in capital ships over the Regia Marina) both in preparation and provocation. They thought wrongly that Italy could be knocked out early, underestimating its determination. Prior to this, from 10 September 1939, the Italians made several attempts to intermediate peace. While Hitler was open to it, the French were not responsive and the British only invited the Italians to change sides. For Mussolini, the risks of staying out of the war were becoming greater than those for entering, which led to a lack of consistency in planning, with principal objectives and enemies being changed with little regard for the consequences. Mussolini was well aware of the military and material deficiencies but thought the war would be over soon and did not expect to do much fighting.

==Italy enters the war: June 1940==

On 10 June 1940, as the French government fled to Bordeaux during the German invasion, declaring Paris an open city, Mussolini felt the conflict would soon end and declared war on Britain and France. As he said to the Army&#x27;s Chief-of-Staff, Marshal Badoglio:

Mussolini had the immediate war aim of expanding the Italian colonies in North Africa by taking land from the British and French colonies.

About Mussolini&#x27;s declaration of war in France, President Franklin D. Roosevelt of the United States said:
The Italian entry into the war opened up new fronts in North Africa and the Mediterranean. After Italy entered the war, pressure from Nazi Germany led to the internment in the Campagna concentration camp of some of Italy&#x27;s Jewish refugees.

===Invasion of France===

In June 1940, after initial success, the Italian offensive into southern France stalled at the fortified Alpine Line. On 24 June 1940, France surrendered to Germany. Italy occupied a swath of French territory along the Franco-Italian border. During this operation, Italian casualties amounted to 1,247 men dead or missing and 2,631 wounded. A further 2,151 Italians were hospitalised due to frostbite.

Late in the Battle of Britain, Italy contributed an expeditionary force, the Corpo Aereo Italiano, which took part in the Blitz from October 1940 until April 1941, at which time the last elements of the force were withdrawn.

In November 1942, the Italian Royal Army occupied south-eastern Vichy France and Corsica as part of Case Anton. From December 1942, Italian military government of French departments east of the Rhône River was established, and continued until September 1943, when Italy quit the war. This had the effect of providing a &quot;de facto&quot; temporary haven for French Jews fleeing the Holocaust. In January 1943 the Italians refused to cooperate with the Nazis in rounding up Jews living in the occupied zone of France under their control and in March prevented the Nazis from deporting Jews in their zone. German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop complained to Mussolini that &quot;Italian military circles... lack a proper understanding of the Jewish question.&quot;

The Italian Navy established a submarine base at Bordeaux, code named BETASOM, and thirty-two Italian submarines participated in the Battle of the Atlantic. Plans to attack the harbour of New York City with CA class midget submarines in 1943 were disrupted when the submarine converted to carry out the attack, the , was sunk in May 1943. The armistice put a stop to further planning.

==North Africa==

===Invasion of Egypt===


Within a week of Italy&#x27;s declaration of war on 10 June 1940, the British 11th Hussars had seized Fort Capuzzo in Libya. In an ambush east of Bardia, the British captured the Italian 10th Army Engineer-in-Chief, General Lastucci. On 28 June Marshal Italo Balbo, the Governor-General of Libya, was killed by friendly fire while landing in Tobruk. Mussolini ordered Balbo&#x27;s replacement, General Rodolfo Graziani, to launch an attack into Egypt immediately. Graziani complained to Mussolini that his forces were not properly equipped for such an operation, and that an attack into Egypt could not possibly succeed; nevertheless, Mussolini ordered him to proceed. On 13 September, elements of the 10th Army retook Fort Capuzzo and crossed the border into Egypt. Lightly opposed, they advanced about to Sidi Barrani, where they stopped and began entrenching themselves in a series of fortified camps.
At this time, the British had only 36,000 troops available (out of about 100,000 under Middle Eastern command) to defend Egypt, against 236,000 Italian troops. The Italians, however, were not concentrated in one location. They were divided between the 5th army in the west and the 10th army in the east and thus spread out from the Tunisian border in western Libya to Sidi Barrani in Egypt. At Sidi Barrani, Graziani, unaware of the British lack of numerical strength, planned to build fortifications and stock them with provisions, ammunition, and fuel, establish a water pipeline, and extend the via Balbia to that location, which was where the road to Alexandria began. This task was being obstructed by British Royal Navy attacks on Italian supply ships in the Mediterranean. At this stage Italian losses remained minimal, but the efficiency of the British Royal Navy would improve as the war went on. Mussolini was fiercely disappointed with Graziani&#x27;s sluggishness. However, according to Bauer he had only himself to blame, as he had withheld the trucks, armaments, and supplies that Graziani had deemed necessary for success. Wavell was hoping to see the Italians overextend themselves before his intended counter at Marsa Matruh.
One officer of Graziani wrote: &quot;We&#x27;re trying to fight this... as though it were a colonial war... this is a European war... fought with European weapons against a European enemy. We take too little account of this in building our stone forts... We are not fighting the Ethiopians now.&quot; (This was a reference to the Second Italo-Abyssinian War where Italian forces had fought against a poorly equipped opponent.) Balbo had said &quot;Our light tanks, already old and armed only with machine guns, are completely out-classed. The machine guns of the British armoured cars pepper them with bullets which easily pierce their armour.&quot;

Italian forces around Sidi Barrani had severe weaknesses in their deployment. Their five main fortifications were placed too far apart to allow mutual support against an attacking force, and the areas between were weakly patrolled. The absence of motorised transport did not allow for rapid reorganisation, if needed. The rocky terrain had prevented an anti-tank ditch from being dug and there were too few mines and 47 mm anti-tank guns to repel an armoured advance. By the summer of 1941, the Italians in North Africa had regrouped, retrained and rearmed into a much more effective fighting force, one that proved to be much harder for the British to overcome in encounters from 1941 to 1943.

===&quot;Afrika Korps&quot; intervention and final defeat===


On 8 December 1940, the British launched Operation Compass. Planned as an extended raid, it resulted in a force of British, Indian, and Australian troops cutting off the Italian 10th Army. Pressing the British advantage home, General Richard O&#x27;Connor succeeded in reaching El Agheila, deep in Libya (an advance of ) and taking some 130,000 prisoners. The Allies nearly destroyed the 10th Army, and seemed on the point of sweeping the Italians out of Libya altogether. Winston Churchill, however, directed the advance be stopped, initially because of supply problems and because of a new Italian offensive that had gained ground in Albania, and ordered troops dispatched to defend Greece. Weeks later the first troops of the German &quot;Afrika Korps&quot; started to arrive in North Africa (February 1941), along with six Italian divisions including the motorized Trento and armored Ariete.

German General Erwin Rommel now became the principal Axis field commander in North Africa, although the bulk of his forces were consisted of Italian troops, and subordinated to the Italian command, Rommel&#x27;s direction the Axis troops pushed the British and Commonwealth troops back into Egypt but were unable to complete the task because of the exhaustion and their extended supply lines which were under threat from the Allied enclave at Tobruk, which they failed to capture. After reorganising and re-grouping the Allies launched Operation Crusader in November 1941 which resulted in the Axis front line being pushed back once more to El Agheila by the end of the year.

In January 1942 the Axis struck back again, advancing to Gazala where the front lines stabilised while both sides raced to build up their strength. At the end of May, the &quot;German-Italian Panzer Army&quot;, launched the Battle of Gazala where the British armoured divisions were soundly defeated. The Axis seemed on the verge of sweeping the British out of Egypt, but at the First Battle of El Alamein, the Allies had halted the Axis advance towards Alexandria. The Axis forces made a final attempt to break through during the Battle of Alam el Halfa but the Eighth Army, held firm. After a period of reinforcement and training the Allies assumed the offensive at the Second Battle of Alamein (October/November 1942) where they scored a decisive victory and the remains of the German-Italian Panzer Army were forced to engage in a fighting retreat for to the Libyan border with Tunisia.

After the Operation Torch landings in the Vichy French territories of Morocco and Algeria (November 1942) British, American and French forces advanced east to engage the German-Italian forces in the Tunisia Campaign. By February, the Axis forces in Tunisia were joined by Rommel&#x27;s forces, after their long withdrawal from El Alamein, which were re-designated the Italian First Army (under Giovanni Messe) when Rommel left to command the Axis forces to the north at the Battle of the Kasserine Pass. Despite the Axis success at Kasserine, the Allies were able to reorganise (with all forces under the unified direction of 18th Army Group commanded by General Sir Harold Alexander) and regain the initiative in April. The Allies completed the defeat of the Axis armies in North Africa in May 1943.

==East Africa==

In addition to the well-known campaigns in the western desert during 1940, the Italians initiated operations in June 1940 from their East African colonies of Ethiopia, Italian Somaliland, and Eritrea.

As in Egypt, Italian forces (roughly 70,000 Italian soldiers and 180,000 native troops) outnumbered their British opponents. Italian East Africa, however, was isolated and far from the Italian mainland, leaving the forces there cut off from supply and thus severely limited in the operations they could undertake.

Initial Italian attacks in East Africa took two different directions, one into Sudan and the other into Kenya. Then, in August 1940, the Italians advanced into British Somaliland. After suffering and inflicting few casualties, the British and Commonwealth garrison evacuated Somaliland, retreating by sea to Aden.

The Italian invasion of British Somaliland was one of the few successful Italian campaigns of World War II accomplished without German support. In Sudan and Kenya, Italy captured small territories around several border villages, after which the Italian Royal Army in East Africa adopted a defensive posture in preparation for expected British counterattacks.

The &quot;Regia Marina&quot; maintained a small squadron in the Italian East Africa area. The &quot;Red Sea Flotilla&quot;, consisting of seven destroyers and eight submarines, was based at the port of Massawa in Eritrea. Despite a severe shortage of fuel, the flotilla posed a threat to British convoys traversing the Red Sea. However, Italian attempts to attack British convoys resulted in the loss of four submarines and one destroyer.

On 19 January 1941, the expected British counterattack arrived in the shape of the Indian 4th and Indian 5th Infantry Divisions, which made a thrust from Sudan. A supporting attack was made from Kenya by the South African 1st Division, the 11th African Division, and the 12th African Division. Finally, the British launched an amphibious assault from Aden to re-take British Somaliland.

Fought from February to March, the outcome of the Battle of Keren determined the fate of Italian East Africa. In early April, after Keren fell, Asmara and Massawa followed. The Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa also fell in April 1941. The Viceroy of Ethiopia, Amedeo, Duke of Aosta, surrendered at the stronghold of Amba Alagi in May. He received full military honours. The Italians in East Africa made a final stand around the town of Gondar in November 1941.

When the port of Massawa fell to the British, the remaining destroyers were ordered on final missions in the Red Sea, some of them achieving small successes before being scuttled or sunk. At the same time, the last four submarines made an epic voyage around the Cape of Good Hope to Bordeaux in France. Some Italians, after their defeat, waged a guerilla war mainly in Eritrea and Ethiopia, that lasted until fall 1943. Notable among them was Amedeo Guillet.

==Balkans==
===Invasion of Albania===

In early 1939, while the world was focused on Adolf Hitler&#x27;s aggression against Czechoslovakia, Mussolini looked to the Kingdom of Albania, across the Adriatic Sea from Italy. Italian forces invaded Albania on 7 April 1939 and swiftly took control of the small country. Even before the invasion, Albania had been politically dominated by Italy; after the invasion it was formally made a protectorate of Italy and the Italian king took the Albanian crown. Along with the intervention in the Spanish Civil War and the invasion of Abyssinia, the invasion of Albania was part of the Italian contribution to the disintegration of the collective security the League of Nations instituted after World War I. As such, it was part of the &quot;prelude to World War II&quot;.

===Invasion of Greece===

On 28 October 1940, Italy started the Greco-Italian War by launching an invasion of the Kingdom of Greece from Albania. In part, the Italians attacked Greece because of the growing influence of Germany in the Balkans. Both Yugoslavia and Greece had governments friendly to Germany. Mussolini launched the invasion of Greece in haste after the Kingdom of Romania, a state which he perceived as lying within the Italian sphere of influence, allied itself with Germany. The order to invade Greece was given by Mussolini to Badoglio and Army Chief of Staff Mario Roatta on 15 October, with the expectation that the attack would commence within 12 days. Badoglio and Roatta were appalled given that, acting on his orders, they had demobilised 600,000 men three weeks prior. Given the expected requirement of at least 20 divisions to facilitate success, the fact that only eight divisions were currently in Albania, and the inadequacies of Albanian ports and connecting infrastructure, adequate preparation would require at least three months. Nonetheless, D-day was set at dawn on 28 October.

The initial Italian offensive was quickly contained, and the invasion soon ended in an embarrassing stalemate. Taking advantage of Bulgaria&#x27;s decision to remain neutral, the Greek Commander-in-Chief, Lt Gen Alexandros Papagos, was able to establish numerical superiority by mid-November, prior to launching a counter-offensive that drove the Italians back into Albania. In addition, the Greeks were naturally adept at operating in mountainous terrain, while only six of the Italian Army&#x27;s divisions, the Alpini, were trained and equipped for mountain warfare. Only when the Italians were able to establish numerical parity was the Greek offensive stopped. By then they had been able to penetrate deep into Albania.

An Italian &quot;Spring Offensive&quot; in March 1941, which tried to salvage the situation prior to German intervention, amounted to little in terms of territorial gains. At this point, combat casualties amounted to over 102,000 for the Italians (with 13,700 dead and 3,900 missing) and fifty thousand sick; the Greek suffered over 90,000 combat casualties (including 14,000 killed and 5,000 missing) and an unknown number of sick. While an embarrassment for the Italians, losses on this scale were devastating for the less numerous Greeks; additionally, the Greek Army had bled a significant amount of materiel. They were short on every area of equipment despite heavy infusion of British aid in February and March, with the army as a whole having only 1 month of artillery ammunition left by the start of April and insufficient arms and equipment to mobilize its reserves. Hitler later stated in hindsight that Greece would have been defeated with or without German intervention, and that even at the time he was of the opinion that the Italians alone would have conquered Greece in the forthcoming season.

After British troops arrived in Greece in March 1941, British bombers operating from Greek bases could reach Romanian oil fields, vital to the German war effort. Hitler decided that a British presence in Greece presented a threat to Germany&#x27;s rear and committed German troops to invade Greece via Yugoslavia (where a coup had deposed the German-friendly government). The Germans invaded on 6 April 1941, smashing through the skeleton garrisons opposing them with little resistance, while the Italians continued a slow advance in Albania and Epirus as the Greeks withdrew, with the country falling to the Axis by the end of the month. The Italian Army was still pinned down in Albania by the Greeks when the Germans began their invasion. Crucially, the bulk of the Greek Army (fifteen divisions out of twenty-one) was left facing the Italians in Albania and Epirus when the Germans intervened. Hitler commented that the Italians &quot;had so weakened [Greece] that its collapse had already become inevitable&quot; and credited them with having &quot;engaged the greater part of the Greek Army.&quot;

===Invasion of Yugoslavia===
On 6 April 1941, the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; invasions of both Yugoslavia (Operation 25) and Greece (Operation Marita) began. Together with the rapid advance of German forces, the Italians attacked Yugoslavia in Dalmatia and finally pushed the Greeks out of Albania. On 17 April, Yugoslavia surrendered to the Germans and the Italians. On 30 April, Greece too surrendered to the Germans and Italians, and was divided into German, Italian, and Bulgarian sectors. The invasions ended with a complete Axis victory in May when Crete fell. On 3 May, during the triumphal parade in Athens to celebrate the Axis victory, Mussolini started to boast of an Italian Mare Nostrum in the Mediterranean.

Some 28 Italian divisions participated in the Balkan invasions. The coast of Yugoslavia was occupied by the Italian Army, while the rest of the country was divided between the Axis forces (a German and Italian creation, the Independent State of Croatia was born, under the nominal sovereignty of Prince Aimone, Duke of Aosta, but actually governed by the Croatian leader Ante Pavelić). The Italians assumed control of most of Greece with their 11th Army, while the Bulgarians occupied the northern provinces and the Germans the strategically most important areas. Italian troops would occupy parts of Greece and Yugoslavia until the Italian armistice with the Allies in September 1943.

In spring 1941, Italy created a Montenegrin client state and annexed most of the Dalmatian coast as the Governorship of Dalmatia (&quot;Governatorato di Dalmazia&quot;). A complicated four-way conflict between the puppet Montenegro regime, Montenegrin nationalists, Royalist remnants of the Yugoslav government, and Communist Partisans continued from 1941 to 1945.

In 1942, the Italian military commander in Croatia refused to hand over Jews in his zone to the Nazis.

==Mediterranean==

In 1940, the Italian Royal Navy (&quot;Regia Marina&quot;) could not match the overall strength of the British Royal Navy in the Mediterranean Sea. After some series of engagements, the Italian Navy declined to engage in a confrontation of capital ships. Since the British Royal Navy had as a principal task the supply and protection of convoys supplying Britain&#x27;s outposts in the Mediterranean, the mere continued existence of the Italian fleet (the so-called &quot;fleet in being&quot; concept) caused problems for Britain, which had to use warships sorely needed elsewhere to protect Mediterranean convoys. On 11 November, Britain launched the first carrier strike of the war, using a squadron of Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers to attack Taranto. The raid left three Italian battleships crippled or destroyed for the loss of two British aircraft shot down.

The Italian navy found other ways to attack the British. The most successful involved the use of frogmen and manned torpedoes to attack ships in harbour. The 10th Light Flotilla, also known as &quot;Decima Flottiglia MAS&quot; or Xª MAS, which carried out these attacks, sank or damaged 28 ships from September 1940 to the end of 1942. These included the battleships and (damaged in the harbour of Alexandria on 18 December 1941), and of merchant shipping. The Xª MAS used a particular kind of torpedo, the SLC (&quot;Siluro a Lenta Corsa&quot;), whose crew was composed of two frogmen, and motorboats packed with explosives, called MTM (&quot;Motoscafo da Turismo Modificato&quot;).

On 1942, Following the attacks on the two British battleships, the &quot;Regia Marina&quot; went on the offensive on the Royal Navy achieving some success at the Second Battle of Sirte in March, and Operation Vigorous and Operation Harpoon in June, the possibility of Italian dominance over the Mediterranean appeared more achievable. However, Mussolini&#x27;s brief period of relative success did not last. The oil and supplies brought to Malta in August, at great cost, by Operation Pedestal, as well as the Allied landings in North Africa, Operation Torch, in November 1942, turned the fortunes of war against Italy. Axis forces were ejected from Libya and Tunisia six months after the Battle of El Alamein, while their supply lines were harassed day after day by the growing and overwhelming aerial and naval supremacy of the Allies. By the summer of 1943, the Allies were poised to invade the Italian homeland.

==Eastern Front==


In July 1941, around 62,000 Italian troops of the Italian Expeditionary Corps in Russia (, CSIR) left for the Eastern Front to aid in the German invasion of the Soviet Union (Operation Barbarossa). In July 1942, the Italian Royal Army () expanded the CSIR to a full army of about 200,000 men named the Italian Army in Russia (, ARMIR), also known as the 8th Army.

From August 1942 to February 1943, the 8th Army took part in the decisive Battle of Stalingrad, where it suffered heavy losses (some 20,000 dead and 64,000 captured) when the Soviets isolated German forces by attacking the over-stretched Hungarian, Romanian, and Italian forces protecting the Germans&#x27; flanks. By the summer of 1943, Rome had withdrawn the remnants of the 8th Army to Italy. Many Italian POWs captured in the Soviet Union died in captivity due to harsh conditions in Soviet prison camps.

==Italian campaign==
===Allied invasion of Sicily and fall of Mussolini===


On 10 July 1943, a combined force of American and British Commonwealth troops invaded Sicily. German generals again took the lead in the defence and, although they lost the island after weeks of bitter fighting, they succeeded in ferrying large numbers of German and Italian forces safely off Sicily to the Italian mainland. On 19 July, an Allied air raid on Rome destroyed both military and collateral civilian structures. With these two events, popular support for the war diminished in Italy.

On 25 July, the Grand Council of Fascism voted to limit the power of Italian dictator Benito Mussolini and handed control of the Italian armed forces over to King Victor Emmanuel III. The next day, Mussolini met with the King, was dismissed as prime minister, and then imprisoned. A new Italian government, led by General Pietro Badoglio and Victor Emmanuel III, took over in Italy.

Although they publicly declared that they would keep fighting alongside the Germans, the new Italian government began secret negotiations with the Allies to come over to the Allied side. Tensions between the Axis and the Italian military were rising following the failure to defend Sicily, with &quot;New York Times&quot; correspondent Milton Bracker noting that &quot;Italian hatred of the Germans unquestionably grew as the fighting spirit waned, and episodes between German and Italian soldiers and civilians before and after the armistice have shown pretty clearly a complete and incontrovertible end of all sympathy between the former Axis partners.&quot;

===Armistice with the Allies and German invasion===
On 3 September, a secret armistice was signed with the Allies at Fairfield Camp in Sicily. The armistice was publicly announced on 8 September. By then, the Allies were on the Italian mainland.

On 3 September, British troops crossed the short distance from Sicily to the &#x27;toe&#x27; of Italy in Operation Baytown. Two more Allied landings took place on 9 September at Salerno (Operation Avalanche) and at Taranto (Operation Slapstick). The Italian surrender meant that the Allied landings at Taranto took place unopposed, with the troops simply disembarking from warships at the docks rather than assaulting the coastline.

Because of the time it took for the new Italian government to negotiate the armistice, the Germans had time to reinforce their presence in Italy and prepare for their defection. In the first weeks of August, they increased the number of divisions in Italy from two to seven and took control of vital infrastructure. Once the signing of the armistice was announced on 8 September, German troops quickly disarmed the Italian forces and took over critical defensive positions in Operation Achse. This included Italian-occupied southeastern France and the Italian-controlled areas in the Balkans. Only in Sardinia, Corsica, and in part of Apulia and Calabria were Italian troops able to hold their positions until the arrival of Allied forces. In the area of Rome, only one infantry division—the Granatieri di Sardegna—and some small armoured units fought with commitment, but by 11 September were overwhelmed by superior German forces.

King Victor Emmanuel III and his family, with Marshal Badoglio, General Mario Roatta, and others, abandoned Rome on 9 September. General Caroni, who was tasked with defending Rome, was given duplicitous orders to have his troops abandon Rome (something he did not want to do), and essentially to provide rear guard protection to the King and his entourage so they could flee to the Abruzzi hills, and later out to sea. They later landed at Brindisi. Most importantly, Badoglio never gave the &quot;OP 44&quot; order for the Italian people to rise up against the Germans until he knew it was too late to do any good; that is, he belatedly issued the order on 11 September. However, from the day of the announcement of the Armistice, when Italian citizens, military personnel and military units decided to rise up and resist on their own, they were sometimes quite effective against the Germans.

As part of the terms of the armistice, the Italian fleet was to sail to Malta for internment; as it did so, it came under air attack by German bombers, and on 9 September two German Fritz X guided bombs sank the Italian battleship off the coast of Sardinia. A &quot;Supermarina&quot; (Italian Naval Command) broadcast led the Italians to initially believe this attack was carried out by the British.

On the Greek island of Cephallonia, General Antonio Gandin, commander of the 12,000-strong Italian &quot;Acqui&quot; Division, decided to resist the German attempt to forcibly disarm his force. The battle raged from 13 to 22 September, when the Italians capitulated having suffered some 1,300 casualties. Following the surrender, the Germans proceeded to massacre thousands of the Italian prisoners.

Italian troops captured by the Germans were given a choice to keep fighting with the Germans. About 94,000 Italians accepted and the remaining 710,000 were designated Italian military internees and were transported as forced labour to Germany. Some Italian troops that evaded German capture in the Balkans joined the Yugoslav (about 40,000 soldiers) and Greek Resistance (about 20,000). The same happened in Albania.

After the German invasion, deportations of Italian Jews to Nazi death camps began. However, by the time the German advance reached the Campagna concentration camp, all the inmates had already fled to the mountains with the help of the local inhabitants. Rev. Aldo Brunacci of Assisi, under the direction of his bishop, Giuseppe Nicolini, saved all the Jews who sought refuge in Assisi. In October 1943 Nazis raided the Jewish ghetto in Rome. In November 1943 Jews of Genoa and Florence were deported to Auschwitz. It is estimated that 7,500 Italian Jews became victims of the Holocaust.

===Civil war and Italian declaration of war on Germany===

After Mussolini had been stripped of power, he was imprisoned at Gran Sasso in the Apennine mountains. On 12 September 1943 he was rescued by the Germans in Operation Eiche (&quot;Oak&quot;). The Germans re-located him to northern Italy where he set up a new Fascist state, the Italian Social Republic (&quot;Repubblica Sociale Italiana&quot; or RSI). Many Italian personalities joined the RSI, like General Rodolfo Graziani. This led, within the context of the Italian campaign, to a civil war between the forces loyal to the Kingdom of Italy, now fighting on the Allied side, and the Fascists who collaborated with the Germans.

On 13 October 1943, the Kingdom of Italy, which was now based outside of Mussolini&#x27;s control, formally became a co-belligerent of the Allies by declaring war on Nazi Germany. With Allied assistance some Italian troops in the south were re-organized into what were known as &quot;co-belligerent&quot; or &quot;royalist&quot; forces. In time, there was a co-belligerent army (Italian Co-Belligerent Army), navy (Italian Co-Belligerent Navy), and air force (Italian Co-Belligerent Air Force). These Italian forces fought alongside the Allies against the Germans for the rest of the war.

===Allied advance and liberation of Italy=== 


The Allied armies continued to advance through Italy despite increasing opposition from the Germans. The Allies soon controlled most of southern Italy, and Naples rose against and ejected the occupying German forces. The loyalist Italian government (sometimes referred to as the &quot;Kingdom of the South&quot;) declared war on Germany on 13 October, aligning Italy within the Western Allies as a co-belligerent. Other Italian troops, loyal to Mussolini and his RSI, continued to fight alongside the Germans (among them the &quot;Esercito Nazionale Repubblicano&quot;, the National Republican Army). From this point on, a large Italian resistance movement located in northern Italy fought a guerilla war against the German and RSI forces.

Winston Churchill had long regarded southern Europe as the military weak spot of the continent (in World War I he had advocated the Dardanelles campaign, and during World War II he favoured the Balkans as an area of operations, for example in Greece in 1940). Calling Italy the &quot;soft underbelly&quot; of the Axis, Churchill had therefore advocated this invasion instead of a cross-channel invasion of occupied France. But Italy itself proved anything but a soft target: the mountainous terrain gave Axis forces excellent defensive positions, and it also partly negated the Allied advantage in motorized and mechanized units. The final Allied victory over the Axis in Italy did not come until the spring offensive of 1945, after Allied troops had breached the Gothic Line. Mussolini was captured and killed on 28 April 1945 by the Italian resistance while attempting to flee. The surrender of German and RSI forces in Italy occurred on 2 May, shortly before Germany finally surrendered ending World War II in Europe on 8 May.

==Italy and Japan after the surrender==
Japan reacted with shock and outrage to the news of the surrender of Italy to the Allied forces in September 1943. Italian citizens residing in Japan and in Manchukuo were swiftly rounded up and summarily asked whether they were loyal to the King, who dishonoured their country by surrendering to the enemy, or with the Duce and the newly created Italian Social Republic, which vowed to continue fighting alongside the Germans. Those who sided with the King were interned in concentration camps and detained in dismal conditions until the end of the war, while those who opted for the Fascist dictator were allowed to go on with their lives, although under strict surveillance by the &quot;Kempeitai&quot;.

The Italian concession of Tientsin was occupied by Japanese troops with no resistance from its garrison. The Social Republic of Italy later formally gave it to the Japanese puppet Reorganized National Government of the Republic of China.

The news of Italy&#x27;s surrender did not reach the crew members of the three Italian submarines &quot;Giuliani&quot;, &quot;Cappellini&quot; and &quot;Torelli&quot; travelling to Singapore, then occupied by Japan, to take a load of rubber, tin, and strategic materials bound for Italy and Germany&#x27;s war industry. All the officers and sailors on board were arrested by the Japanese army, and after a few weeks of detention the vast majority of them chose to side with Japan and Germany. The &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; assigned new officers to the three units, who were renamed as U-boat &quot;U.IT.23&quot;, &quot;U.IT.24,&quot; and &quot;U.IT.25&quot;, taking part in German war operations in the Pacific until the &quot;Giuliani&quot; was sunk by the British submarine HMS &quot;Tally-ho&quot; in February 1944 and the other two vessels were taken over by the Japanese Imperial Navy upon Germany&#x27;s surrender in 1945.

Alberto Tarchiani, an anti-fascist journalist and activist, was appointed as Ambassador to Washington by the cabinet of Badoglio, which acted as provisional head of the Italian government pending the occupation of the country by the Allied forces. On his suggestion, Italy issued a formal declaration of war on Japan on 14 July 1945.

As early as of May 1945, the Italian destroyer &quot;Carabiniere&quot; had been prepared and refitted with a new radar and camouflage scheme to operate in the Indian and Pacific Ocean against the Japanese Empire, in collaboration with the Allies. Departing under the command of Captain Fabio Tani, after a troublesome voyage the Italian crew reached their new base in Trincomalee. By August 1945, the Carabiniere had undertaken 38 missions of anti-aircraft and anti-submarine escort to British warships and SAR operations. They thoroughly impressed Admiral Arthur Power of the Eastern Fleet during combat and in defending the fleet against kamikaze attacks, and he offered captain Tani a golden watch with 38 rubies, one for each mission, as a prize for their valour. Captain Tani kindly declined and requested that an Italian POW for each ruby be released instead, which was granted by the Admiral.

A further purpose of the Italian declaration of war on Japan was to persuade the Allies that the new government of Italy deserved to be invited to the San Francisco Peace Conference, as a reward for its co-belligerence. However, British Prime Minister Churchill and John Foster Dulles were resolutely against the idea, and so Italy&#x27;s new government was left out of the Conference.

Italy and Japan negotiated the resumption of their respective diplomatic ties after 1951, and later signed several bilateral agreements and treaties.

==Casualties==

Nearly four million Italians served in the Italian Army during the Second World War and nearly half a million Italians (including civilians) lost their lives between June 1940 and May 1945.

The official Italian government accounting of World War II 1940–45 losses listed the following data:
* Total military dead and missing from 1940 to 1945: 291,376
** Losses prior to the Armistice of Cassibile in September 1943: 204,346 (66,686 killed, 111,579 missing, 26,081 died of disease)
** Losses after the Armistice: 87,030 (42,916 killed, 19,840 missing, 24,274 died of disease). Military losses in Italy after the September 1943 Armistice included 5,927 with the Allies, 17,488 Italian resistance movement fighters and 13,000 Italian Social Republic (RSI) Fascist forces.
* Losses by branch of service:
** Army 201,405
** Navy 22,034
** Air Force 9,096
** Colonial Forces 354
** Chaplains 91
** Fascist militia 10,066
** Paramilitary 3,252
** Not indicated 45,078
* Military losses by theatre of war:
** Italy 74,725 (37,573 post armistice)
** France 2,060 (1,039 post armistice)
** Germany 25,430 (24,020 post armistice)
** Greece, Albania, and Yugoslavia 49,459 (10,090 post armistice)
** Soviet Union 82,079 (3,522 post armistice)
** Africa 22,341 (1,565 post armistice)
** At sea 28,438 (5,526 post armistice)
** Other and unknown 6,844 (3,695 post armistice).

Prisoner-of-war losses are included with military losses mentioned above.

The members in the Roll of Honor of the World War II (sic) amounted to a total of 319,207 deaths:
* Army 246,432;
* Navy 31,347;
* Air Force 13,210;
* Partisan formations 15,197;
* RSI armed forces 13,021.

Civilian losses totalled 153,147 (123,119 post armistice) including 61,432 (42,613 post armistice) in air attacks. A brief summary of data from this report can be found online.

In addition, deaths of African soldiers conscripted by Italy were estimated by the Italian military to be 10,000 in the 1940–41 East African Campaign.

Civilian losses as a result of the fighting in Italian Libya were estimated by an independent Russian journalist to be 10,000.

Included in total are 64,000 victims of Nazi reprisals and genocide, including 30,000 POWs and 8,500 Jews Russian sources estimated the deaths of 28,000 of the 49,000 Italian prisoners of war in the Soviet Union (1942–1954).

The genocide of Roma people killed 1,000 persons. Jewish Holocaust victims totalled 8,562 (including Libya).

After the armistice with the Allies, some 650,000 members of the Italian armed forces who refused to side with the occupying Germans were interned in concentration and labour camps. Of these, around 50,000 died while imprisoned or in transit. A further 29,000 died in armed struggles against the Germans while resisting capture immediately following the armistice.

==Aftermath==
The 1947 Treaty of Peace with Italy spelled the end of the Italian colonial empire, along with other border revisions. The 1947 Paris Peace Treaties compelled Italy to pay $360,000,000 (US dollars at 1938 prices) in war reparations: $125,000,000 to Yugoslavia, $105,000,000 to Greece, $100,000,000 to the Soviet Union, $25,000,000 to Ethiopia and $5,000,000 to Albania. Italy also agreed to pay £1,765,000 to Greek nationals whose property in Italian territory had been destroyed or seized during the war. In the 1946 Italian constitutional referendum, the Italian monarchy was abolished, having been associated with the deprivations of the war and Fascist rule. Unlike in Germany and Japan, no war crimes tribunals were held for Italian military and political leaders, though the Italian resistance summarily executed some of them, including Mussolini, at the end of the war.

==Controversies of historiography==

Allied press reports of Italian military prowess in the Second World War were almost always dismissive. British wartime propaganda trumpeted the destruction of the Italian 10th Army by a significantly smaller British force during the early phase of the North African Campaign. The propaganda from this Italian collapse, which was designed to boost British morale during a bleak period of the war, left a lasting impression. The later exploits of Rommel and German accounts of events tended to disparage their Italian allies and downplay their contributions; these German accounts were used as a primary source for the Axis side by English-language historians after the war. Kenneth Macksey wrote in 1972 that after the split in the Italian state and the reinforcement of fascist Italy by German troops, &quot;the British threw out the &quot;Italian Chicken&quot; only to let in the &quot;German Eagle&quot;&quot;, for example. Many military historians who contributed to this dismissive judgement, such as Basil Liddell Hart, were clearly influenced by German propaganda. Liddell Hart, who considered Italian people racially inferior to Germans, went so far as to express his appreciation for &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; Albert Kesselring, who had committed atrocious war crimes during the German occupation of Italy, and even lobbied to have him released from prison.

James Sadkovich, Peter Haining, Vincent O&#x27;Hara, Ian Walker and others have attempted to reassess the performance of Italian forces. Many previous authors used only German or British sources, not considering the Italian ones, hampered by the few Italian sources being translated into English. Contemporary British reports ignored an action of Bir El Gobi, where a battalion of &quot;Giovani Fascisti&quot; held up the 11th Indian Infantry Brigade and destroyed a dozen tanks of the 22nd Armoured Brigade. Sadkovich, Walker, and others have found examples of actions where Italian forces were effective, yet rarely discussed by most histories. During the Tunisian campaign, where Italian units were involved in most encounters, such as the battles of Kasserine Pass, Mareth, Akarit, and Enfidaville, it was observed by General Alexander, &quot;...the Italians fought particularly well, outdoing the Germans in line with them&quot;. Rommel also conceded praise on several occasions. Other times, German mistakes were blamed on Italians, or the Germans left the Italians in hopeless situations where failure was unavoidable. Questionable German advice, broken promises and security lapses had direct consequences at the Battle of Cape Matapan, in the convoy war and North Africa. According to Sadkovich, Rommel often retreated leaving immobile infantry units exposed, withdrew German units to rest even though the Italians had also been in combat, would deprive the Italians of their share of captured goods, ignore Italian intelligence, seldom acknowledged Italian successes and often resisted formulation of joint strategy.

Alan J.Levine, an author who has also extensively worked with Italian sources, points out that while Allied efforts to choke off Rommel&#x27;s supply lines were eventually successful and played the decisive role in the Allied victory in Africa, the Italians who defended it, especially navy commanders, were not feeble-minded or incompetent at all. He criticises Rommel for ignoring the good advice of Italians during the Crusader Offensive (although he also presents a positive picture of the Field Marshal in general), and in a review of Sadkovich&#x27;s work, &quot;The Italian Navy in World War II&quot;, criticises it for being unreliable and recommends Bragadin and the Italian official history instead. Gerhard L.Weinberg, in his 2011 George C. Marshall Lecture &quot;Military History – Some Myths of World War II&quot; (2011), complained that &quot;there is far too much denigration of the performance of Italy&#x27;s forces during the conflict.&quot;
In addition, Italian &#x27;cowardice&#x27; did not appear to be more prevalent than the level seen in any army, despite claims of wartime propaganda. Ian Walker wrote:

The vast majority of historians attribute Italian military shortcomings to strategy and equipment. Italian equipment was generally substandard relative to Allied or German armies. More crucially, they lacked suitable quantities of equipment of all kinds and their high command did not take necessary steps to plan for most eventualities. This was compounded by Mussolini&#x27;s assigning unqualified political favourites to key positions. Mussolini also dramatically overestimated the ability of the Italian military at times, sending them into situations where failure was likely, such as the invasion of Greece.

Historians have long debated why Italy&#x27;s military and Fascist regime proved ineffective at an activity — war — that was central to their identity. MacGregor Knox explains that this &quot;was first and foremost a failure of Italy&#x27;s military culture and military institutions.&quot; The explanation usually given is that Italy was unprepared for a global conflict as Fascist imperialism had diverted resources to wage wars in Libya, Ethiopia, Spain, and Albania during the 1930s: although successful, these campaigns drained resources that should have been destined to an effective re-armament. Donald Detwiler writes that &quot;Italy&#x27;s entrance into the war showed very early that her military strength was only a hollow shell. Italy&#x27;s military failures against France, Greece, Yugoslavia, and in the African Theatres of war shook Italy&#x27;s new prestige mightily.&quot; James Sadkovich surmises that Italian failures were caused by inferior equipment, overextension, and inter-service rivalries. Its forces had &quot;more than their share of handicaps.&quot;
