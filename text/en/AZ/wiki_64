<text>The American Hockey League (AHL) is a professional ice hockey league in North America that serves as the primary developmental league of the National Hockey League (NHL). The league comprises 32 teams, with 26 in the United States and 6 in Canada. 

As of the 2024–25 AHL season, all 32 NHL teams held affiliations with an AHL team. Historically, when an NHL team does not have an AHL affiliate, its players are assigned to AHL teams affiliated with other NHL franchises. The league offices are located in Springfield, Massachusetts, and its current president is Scott Howson.

A player must be at least 18 years old and not belong to a junior ice hockey team to be eligible. The league limits the number of experienced professional players in a team&#x27;s lineup during any given game; only five skaters can have accumulated more than 260 games played at the professional level (goaltenders are exempt from this rule).

The annual playoff champion is awarded the Calder Cup, named for Frank Calder, the first president (1917–1943) of the NHL. The defending champions following the 2023–24 season are the Hershey Bears, winning their 13th Calder Cup in franchise history.

==History==
===Predecessor leagues===
The AHL traces its origins directly to two predecessor professional leagues: the Canadian-American Hockey League (the &quot;Can-Am&quot; League), founded in 1926, and the first International Hockey League, established in 1929. Although the Can-Am League never operated with more than six teams, the departure of the Boston Bruin Cubs after the 1935–36 season reduced it down to just four member clubs: the Springfield Indians, Philadelphia Ramblers, Providence Reds, and New Haven Eagles for the first time in its history. At the same time, the then-rival IHL lost half of its eight members after the 1935–36 season, leaving it with just four member teams: the Buffalo Bisons, Syracuse Stars, Pittsburgh Hornets, and Cleveland Falcons.

===1936–1938===
With both leagues down to the bare minimum number of teams to be viable, the governors of both leagues recognized the need for action to assure their member clubs&#x27; long-term survival. Their solution was to play an interlocking schedule. While the Can-Am was based in the Northeast and the IHL in the Great Lakes, their footprints were close enough for this to be a viable option. The two leagues&#x27; eight surviving clubs began joint play in November 1936 as a new two-division &quot;circuit of mutual convenience&quot; known as the International-American Hockey League. The four Can-Am teams became the I-AHL East Division, with the IHL quartet playing as the West Division. The IHL also contributed its former championship trophy, the F.G. &quot;Teddy&quot; Oke Trophy, which would go to the regular-season winners of the merged league&#x27;s West Division until 1952. The Oke Trophy is now awarded to the regular-season winners of the AHL&#x27;s North Division.

A little more than a month into that first season, the balance and symmetry of the new combined circuit suffered a setback when its membership unexpectedly fell to seven teams. The West&#x27;s Buffalo Bisons were forced to cease operations on December 6, 1936, after playing just 11 games, because of what proved to be insurmountable financial problems and lack of access to a suitable arena; the Bisons&#x27; original arena, Peace Bridge Arena, had collapsed the previous season (a new Buffalo Bisons team would return to the league in 1940 after a new arena was constructed for them). The makeshift new I-AHL played out the rest of its first season (as well as all of the next) with just seven teams.

At the end of the 1936–37 season, a modified three-round playoff format was devised and a new championship trophy, the Calder Cup, was established. The Syracuse Stars defeated the Philadelphia Ramblers in the final, three-games-to-one, to win the first-ever Calder Cup championship. The Calder Cup continues on today as the AHL&#x27;s playoff championship trophy.

===Formal consolidation of the I-AHL===

After two seasons of interlocking play, the governors of the two leagues&#x27; seven active teams met in New York City on June 28, 1938, and agreed that it was time to formally consolidate. Maurice Podoloff of New Haven, the former head of the Can-Am League, was elected the I-AHL&#x27;s first president. The former IHL president, John D. Chick of Windsor, Ontario, became vice-president in charge of officials.

The new I-AHL also added an eighth franchise at the 1938 meeting to fill the void in its membership left by the loss of Buffalo two years earlier with the admission of the then two-time defending Eastern Amateur Hockey League (EAHL) champion Hershey Bears. The Bears remain the only one of these eight original I-AHL/AHL franchises to have been represented in the league without interruption since the 1938–39 season. The newly merged circuit also increased its regular-season schedule for each team by six games from 48 to 54.

===Contraction, resurrection, and expansion===

After the 1939–40 season the I-AHL renamed itself the American Hockey League. It generally enjoyed both consistent success on the ice and relative financial stability over its first three decades of operation. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, however, the cost of doing business in professional ice hockey began to rise sharply with NHL expansion and relocation (the NHL placed teams in Pittsburgh and Buffalo, forcing two long-time AHL clubs, the Pittsburgh Hornets and Buffalo Bisons, to fold) and especially the 1972 formation of the World Hockey Association (WHA), which forced the relocation and subsequent folding of the Cleveland Barons, Baltimore Clippers, and Quebec Aces. The number of major-league teams competing for players rose from six to thirty in just seven years. Player salaries at all levels shot up dramatically with the increased demand and competition for their services.

This did not seem to affect the AHL at first, as it expanded to 12 teams by 1970. However, to help compensate for the rise in player salaries, many NHL clubs cut back on the number of players they kept under contract for development, and players under AHL contracts could now also demand much higher paychecks to remain with their clubs. As a result, half of the AHL&#x27;s teams folded from 1974 to 1977. The league bottomed out in the summer of 1977, with news that the Rhode Island (formerly Providence) Reds – the last remaining uninterrupted franchise from the 1936–37 season, and the oldest continuously operating minor league franchise in North America – had decided to cease operations after 51 years in Rhode Island.

The AHL appeared in serious danger of folding altogether if this downward trend was not reversed. However, two events in the fall of 1977 helped reverse the trend. The first of these was the decision of the NHL&#x27;s Philadelphia Flyers to return to the league as a team owner, and the second was the unexpected collapse of the North American Hockey League just weeks before the start of the 1977–78 season.

The Flyers&#x27; new AHL franchise became the immediately successful Maine Mariners, which brought the new AHL city of Portland, Maine both the regular-season and Calder Cup playoff titles in each of that club&#x27;s first two seasons of operation. The folding of the NAHL, meanwhile, suddenly left two of its stronger teams, the Philadelphia Firebirds and Binghamton, New York-based Broome Dusters, without a league to play in. The owners of the Dusters solved their problem by buying the Reds franchise and moving it to Binghamton as the Binghamton Dusters, while the Firebirds crossed over to the AHL from the NAHL. The Dusters and Firebirds, together with the Hampton Gulls (who had joined the league from the Southern Hockey League), boosted the AHL to nine member clubs as the 1977–78 season opened. Hampton folded on February 10, 1978, but was replaced the next year by the New Brunswick Hawks. With franchise stability improving after the demise of the WHA in 1979, the league continued to grow steadily over the years, reaching 20 clubs by the 2000–01 season.

===Absorption of the IHL===

In 2001–02, the AHL&#x27;s membership jumped dramatically to 27 teams, mostly by the absorption of six teams—Milwaukee, Chicago, Houston, Utah, Manitoba, and Grand Rapids—from the International Hockey League. The IHL had established itself as the second top-level minor league circuit in North America, but folded in 2001 due to financial problems. One oddity caused by the AHL&#x27;s 2001 expansion was that the league had two teams with the same nickname: the Milwaukee Admirals and the Norfolk Admirals. The latter team transferred to the league from the mid-level ECHL in 2000. This situation lasted until the end of the 2014–15 season when the Norfolk team moved to San Diego and was replaced by another ECHL team with the same name.

The Utah Grizzlies suspended operations after the 2004–05 season (the franchise was sold in 2006 and returned to the ice in Cleveland in 2007 as the Lake Erie Monsters, now known as the Cleveland Monsters). The Chicago Wolves (2002, 2008, 2022), Houston Aeros (2003), Milwaukee Admirals (2004), and Grand Rapids Griffins (2013, 2017) have all won Calder Cup titles since joining the AHL from the IHL. Chicago and Milwaukee have also made multiple trips to the Calder Cup Finals, and Houston made their second Finals appearance in 2011.

The Manitoba Moose moved to St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland and Labrador in 2011 and were renamed the St. John&#x27;s IceCaps after the NHL&#x27;s Atlanta Thrashers moved to Winnipeg as the second incarnation of the Winnipeg Jets. In 2013, Houston moved to Des Moines, Iowa to become the Iowa Wild. This left Chicago, Grand Rapids and Milwaukee as the only ex-IHL teams still in their original cities until the 2015 relocations when the IceCaps moved back to Winnipeg as the Manitoba Moose.

===Relocations and western shift===

Beginning with the 2015–16 season, twelve franchises have since relocated due to NHL parent clubs&#x27; influence on their development teams and players. Of the twelve relocated franchises, nine were relocated because they were directly owned by NHL teams and the NHL parent club wished to make call-ups from the AHL more practical by having closer affiliates.

In January 2015, the AHL announced the relocation of five existing AHL franchises—Adirondack, Manchester, Norfolk, Oklahoma City, and Worcester—to California as the basis for a new &quot;Pacific Division&quot; becoming Stockton, Ontario, San Diego, Bakersfield, and San Jose respectively. The relocated teams were all affiliated and owned or purchased by teams in the NHL&#x27;s Pacific Division. The franchise movements continued with two more relocations involving Canadian teams with the St. John&#x27;s IceCaps going back to Winnipeg as the Manitoba Moose and the Hamilton Bulldogs becoming another iteration of the IceCaps to fulfill the arena contract in St. John&#x27;s.

In the following seasons, more NHL organizations influenced league membership. In 2016, the Springfield Falcons franchise was purchased by the Arizona Coyotes and relocated to become the Tucson Roadrunners and join the one-year-old Pacific Division. The Falcons were subsequently replaced by the Springfield Thunderbirds, the relocated Portland Pirates franchise under a new ownership group. The Montreal Canadiens-owned IceCaps relocated to the Montreal suburb of Laval, Quebec, and became the Laval Rocket in 2017. The Binghamton Senators were also purchased by the Ottawa Senators and were relocated to Belleville, Ontario, to become the Belleville Senators while the New Jersey Devils&#x27; owned Albany Devils were relocated to become the Binghamton Devils.

For the 2018–19 season, a 31st team joined the league with the Colorado Eagles as the NHL&#x27;s Colorado Avalanche affiliate. With the NHL planning to expand to 32 teams in 2021 with the Seattle Kraken, the Seattle ownership group was approved for a 2021 AHL expansion team, later announced to be the Coachella Valley Firebirds based in Palm Springs, California, following the construction of a new arena. The original plans for the new arena was eventually cancelled and the team postponed their launch by a year while new arena plans were developed.

In February 2020, the San Antonio Rampage franchise was bought and relocated by the NHL&#x27;s Vegas Golden Knights for the 2020–21 season as the Henderson Silver Knights and was moved to the Pacific Division. For the 2021–22 season, the Vancouver Canucks relocated their franchise from Utica to Abbotsford while the Utica Comets agreed to relocate and operate the franchise that was operating as the Binghamton Devils. On May 23, 2022, it was announced that the Stockton Heat would be relocating to Calgary, Alberta, starting the 2022–23 season.

For the 2023–24 season, the Chicago Wolves operated as the league&#x27;s only unaffiliated team, making them the first team to operate without an NHL partner since the inaugural season of the Worcester IceCats during the 1994–95 season. Consequently, the Carolina Hurricanes became the only NHL team currently without an AHL affiliate. However, the Hurricanes loaned some players to the Wolves, such as Vasili Ponomaryov, Domenick Fensore, Ronan Seeley and Antti Raanta. On May 2, 2024, the Hurricanes and Wolves committed to a three-year affiliation beginning with the 2024–25 season.

==Presidents==
==All-Star Game==

The American Hockey League first held an All-Star Game in the 1941–42 season as a fundraiser for American Red Cross and Canadian Red Cross efforts during World War II. Players from the Eastern Division faced off against players from the Western Division at Cleveland Arena.

The event was not played again until the 1954–55 season, and was then held annually until the 1959–60 season. These six annual games pitted a team of all-stars against the defending Calder Cup champions (with the exception of the 1959-60 event, which featured the Springfield Indians).

The modern AHL All-Star Game was reinstituted for the 1994–95 season and a skills competition was introduced in 1995–96, with the two-day event being dubbed the AHL All-Star Classic. The 1995 and 1996 games featured players from teams based in Canada taking on players from teams based in the United States. Beginning in 1997, Canadian-born players faced players born outside Canada (known as the “World” team in 1997 and “PlanetUSA” from 1998 to 2010).

The format was revamped again in 2011 to pit the Eastern Conference against the Western Conference. In 2014, a team of AHL all-stars hosted the Swedish Hockey League club Färjestad BK.

Since 2016, the all-star game has been replaced by the AHL All-Star Challenge, a three-on-three round-robin tournament among teams from the league&#x27;s four divisions; the top two teams advance to the final game, with the winner declared the challenge champions.

The AHL All-Star Classic was postponed in 2021 and 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Laval Rocket, who had been selected to host, ultimately hosted the event in 2023.

==Outdoor games==
Since the 2009–10 season, at least one team in the AHL has hosted an outdoor ice hockey game each year. The Syracuse Crunch was the first organization to put on an outdoor game in the AHL on February 20, 2010, building a rink at the New York State Fairgrounds in Syracuse, New York, and packing a record 21,508 fans in for the Mirabito Outdoor Classic against the Binghamton Senators. The contest, which was also televised to an international audience on NHL Network, was won by the Crunch, 2–1.

The Connecticut Whale hosted the Whale Bowl, the AHL&#x27;s second outdoor game held on February 19, 2011, as part of a 10-day Whalers Hockey Fest at Rentschler Field in East Hartford, Connecticut. Attendance for Connecticut&#x27;s game against the Providence Bruins was announced at 21,673, the largest in AHL history to that point. Providence won, 5–4, in a shootout.

On January 6, 2012, the largest crowd in AHL history saw the Adirondack Phantoms defeat the Hershey Bears, 4–3, in overtime before 45,653 fans at Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia, as the final event of the week-long activities associated with the 2012 NHL Winter Classic, which also included a game between the Philadelphia Flyers and the New York Rangers on Jan 2 and an alumni game between retired players (including eight honored members of the Hockey Hall of Fame) of those two clubs on December 31, 2011. The contest was the third outdoor game in AHL history and it more than doubled the league&#x27;s previous single-game attendance mark.

On January 21, 2012, the Steeltown Showdown between Ontario rivals, the Toronto Marlies and Hamilton Bulldogs, was held at Ivor Wynne Stadium in Hamilton, Ontario, with the Marlies winning 7–2 in front of 20,565 fans, the largest crowd ever for an AHL game in Canada. The AHL game was preceded the previous night by a game between Toronto Maple Leafs and Montreal Canadiens alumni.

Two outdoor games were announced for the 2012–13 AHL season, but a meeting between the Grand Rapids Griffins and Toronto Marlies at Comerica Park in Detroit as part of the festivities surrounding the NHL Winter Classic was not held because of the cancellation of the NHL Winter Classic. On January 20, 2013, the Hershey Bears and Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins met outdoors at Hersheypark Stadium in Hershey, Pennsylvania with the Penguins earning a 2–1 overtime victory in front of 17,311 fans.

The Rochester Americans hosted an outdoor game in 2013–14, the Frozen Frontier, which was held at Frontier Field in Rochester, New York, on December 13, 2013. The Americans took a 5–4 decision in a shootout against the Lake Erie Monsters before a standing-room crowd of 11,015 fans. A year after their originally scheduled date, the Griffins and Marlies played at Comerica Park on December 30, 2013, and Toronto prevailed in a shootout, 4–3, becoming the first AHL team ever with two outdoor wins. Attendance in Detroit was 20,337.

As part of the recent addition of the Pacific Division, the AHL played its first outdoor hockey game in California during the 2015–16 season, called the Golden State Hockey Rush. On December 18, 2015, the Stockton Heat defeated the Bakersfield Condors, 3–2, at Raley Field in West Sacramento, California.

For the second consecutive season, the AHL played an outdoor game in California as the Bakersfield Condors hosted the Condorstown Outdoor Classic against the Ontario Reign on January 7, 2017, at Bakersfield College&#x27;s Memorial Stadium. Despite sometimes heavy rain during the first period, the game went on as scheduled and the Condors defeated the Reign 3–2 in overtime.

Hersheypark Stadium hosted its second outdoor game in 2018. Cleveland&#x27;s FirstEnergy Stadium became the first National Football League venue to host an AHL outdoor game in 2023, and Truist Field in Charlotte hosted the Queen City Outdoor Classic in 2024.

==International games==
Teams from the AHL have competed against non-North American teams, in both international tournaments and one-off matchups.

The first recorded games between an AHL team and international competition took place in 1969, when the Montreal Voyageurs hosted the Canadian National Team in Winnipeg.

Several club teams from the Soviet Union toured the United States and Canada during the 1970s and 1980s and played exhibitions against AHL clubs, including the Soviet Wings (1974–75), HC Spartak Moscow (1976, 1986), Moscow Khimik (1976), HC Dynamo Moscow (1977–78), Traktor Chelyabinsk (1978–79) and Sokil Kyiv (1989).

Prior to the 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, New York, the Adirondack Red Wings hosted exhibition games against the national teams from the United States, West Germany, Sweden and Finland. Team USA also played exhibitions against AHL teams leading up to the 1994 Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway.

The Rochester Americans participated in the 1996 and 2013 editions of the Spengler Cup, held in Davos, Switzerland. The Spengler Cup is an annual invitational tournament featuring teams from leagues around Europe and the world. The participation of the AHL in future Spengler Cups has been discussed by both the tournament organizers and league leadership.

In 2014, Swedish club Färjestad BK met the Toronto Marlies as part of a visit to Canada that included its participation in the 2014 AHL All-Star Classic.

In February 2018, the Ontario Reign hosted and defeated the DEL&#x27;s Eisbären Berlin, 6–3, in a friendly matchup organized by Anschutz Entertainment Group, the owner of both teams.

<doc id="207089" wikidata="Q523968" url="?curid=207089" title="USS Arkansas (BB-33)">
<text>USS &quot;Arkansas&quot; (BB-33) was a dreadnought battleship, the second member of the , built by the United States Navy. She was the third ship of the US Navy named in honor of the 25th state, and was built by the New York Shipbuilding Corporation. She was laid down in January 1910, launched in January 1911, and commissioned into the Navy in September 1912. &quot;Arkansas&quot; was armed with a main battery of twelve guns and capable of a top speed of .

&quot;Arkansas&quot; served in both World Wars. During World War I, she was part of Battleship Division Nine, which was attached to the British Grand Fleet, but she saw no action during the war. During the interwar years, &quot;Arkansas&quot; performed a variety of duties, including training cruises for midshipmen and goodwill visits overseas.

Following the outbreak of World War II, &quot;Arkansas&quot; conducted Neutrality Patrols in the Atlantic prior to America&#x27;s entry into the war. Thereafter, she escorted convoys to Europe through 1944; in June, she supported the invasion of Normandy, and in August she provided gunfire support to the invasion of southern France. In 1945, she transferred to the Pacific, and bombarded Japanese positions during the invasions of Iwo Jima and Okinawa. After the end of the war, she ferried troops back to the United States as part of Operation Magic Carpet. &quot;Arkansas&quot; was expended as a target in Operation Crossroads, a pair of nuclear weapon tests at Bikini Atoll in July 1946.

== Design ==
&quot;Arkansas&quot; was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of . She displaced as designed and up to at full load. The ship was powered by four-shaft Parsons steam turbines and twelve coal-fired Babcock &amp; Wilcox water-tube boilers rated at , generating a top speed of . The ship had a cruising range of at a speed of .

The ship was armed with a main battery of twelve 12-inch/50 caliber Mark 7 guns guns in six twin Mark 9 gun turrets on the centerline, two of which were placed in a superfiring pair forward. The other four turrets were placed aft of the superstructure in two superfiring pairs. The secondary battery consisted of twenty-one /51 caliber guns mounted in casemates along the side of the hull. The main armored belt was thick, while the gun turrets had thick faces. The conning tower had thick sides.

=== Modifications ===
In 1925, &quot;Arkansas&quot; was modernized in the Philadelphia Navy Yard. Her displacement increased significantly, to standard and full load. Her beam was widened to , primarily from the installation of anti-torpedo bulges, and draft increased to . Her twelve coal-fired boilers were replaced with four White-Forster oil-fired boilers that had been intended for the ships cancelled under the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty; performance remained the same as the older boilers. The ship&#x27;s deck armor was strengthened by the addition of of armor to the second deck between the end barbettes, plus of armor on the third deck on the bow and stern. The deck armor over the engines and boilers was increased by and , respectively. Five of the 5-inch guns were removed and eight /50 caliber anti-aircraft guns were installed. The mainmast was removed to provide space for an aircraft catapult mounted on the Number 3 turret amidships.

== Service history ==
=== Pre-World War I ===
&quot;Arkansas&quot; was laid down on 25 January 1910, at New York Shipbuilding in Camden, New Jersey. She was launched on 14 January 1911, after which fitting-out work was effected. The ship was completed by September 1912, and was commissioned into the US Navy on 17 September, at the Philadelphia Navy Yard, under the command of Captain Roy C. Smith. Following her commissioning, &quot;Arkansas&quot; participated in a fleet review on 14 October 1912, for President William Howard Taft. The ship took Taft aboard that day for a trip to Panama to inspect the Panama Canal, which was still under construction. &quot;Arkansas&quot; began her shakedown cruise after delivering Taft and his entourage to the Canal Zone. During this cruise, the Navy&#x27;s first long-distance, continuous-wave, wireless telegraphy system was successfully tested, with regular transmissions received by &quot;Arkansas&quot; from a prototype Poulsen-arc transmission facility located in Arlington, Virginia. On 26 December, she returned to the Canal Zone to take Taft to Key West, Florida. After completing the voyage, &quot;Arkansas&quot; was assigned to the Atlantic Fleet and participated in fleet maneuvers off the east coast of the United States. &quot;Arkansas&quot;″s first overseas cruise, to the Mediterranean Sea, began in late October 1913. While there, she stopped in several ports, including Naples, Italy on 11 November, where the ship celebrated the birthday of King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy.

In early 1914, an international incident with Mexico culminated in the American occupation of Veracruz. &quot;Arkansas&quot; participated in the occupation, contributing four companies of naval infantry, which amounted to 17 officers and 313 enlisted men. The American forces fought their way through the city until they secured it. Two of &quot;Arkansas&quot;″s crewmen were killed in the fighting, and another two, John Grady and Jonas H. Ingram, received the Medal of Honor for actions during the occupation. The ship&#x27;s detachment returned on 30 April; &quot;Arkansas&quot; remained in Mexican waters until she departed on 30 September, to return to the United States. While stationed in Veracruz, the ship was visited by Captain Franz von Papen, the German military attaché to the United States and Mexico, and Rear Admiral Christopher Cradock, the commander of the British 4th Cruiser Squadron, on 10 May and 30 May 1914, respectively.

&quot;Arkansas&quot; arrived in Hampton Roads, Virginia, on 7 October, after which she took part in exercises for a week. She then sailed to the New York Navy Yard for periodic maintenance. After repairs were completed, the ship steamed down to the Virginia Capes area for training maneuvers. She returned to the New York Navy Yard on 12 December, for additional maintenance. The repairs were completed within a month, and on 16 January 1915, &quot;Arkansas&quot; departed for the Virginia Capes for exercises on 19–21 January. The ship then steamed down to Guantánamo Bay, Cuba for exercises with the fleet. &quot;Arkansas&quot; returned for training off Hampton Roads on 7 April, followed by another maintenance period at the New York Navy Yard, starting on 23 April.

On 25 June, the repairs were complete, and &quot;Arkansas&quot; departed for Newport, Rhode Island, for torpedo practice and tactical maneuvers in Narragansett Bay, which lasted through late August. On 27 August, the ship was back in Hampton Roads. There, she participated in exercises off Norfolk through 4 October. She then returned to Newport, where she took part in strategic maneuvers on 5–14 October. She went to the New York Navy Yard on 15 October, where she was drydocked for extensive maintenance. The work was completed by 8 November, when &quot;Arkansas&quot; returned to Hampton Roads. The ship was in Brooklyn for repairs on 19 November, which lasted until 5 January 1916, when she steamed south to the Caribbean Sea, via Hampton Roads, for winter exercises. She steamed to Mobile Bay on 12 March, for torpedo practice, before returning to Guantánamo Bay. She returned to the New York Navy Yard on 15 April, for an overhaul.

=== World War I ===
The United States declared war on Germany on 6 April 1917, joining the Allied Powers in World War I. &quot;Arkansas&quot; was at the time assigned to Battleship Division 7 stationed in Virginia. The ship patrolled the east coast and trained gun crews for the next fourteen months. The ship was sent to Britain in July 1918 to relieve the battleship , which had been assigned to operate with the Grand Fleet in the 6th Battle Squadron since December 1917. &quot;Arkansas&quot; departed the United States on 14 July; while approaching the Royal Navy base in Rosyth, the battleship fired on what was thought to be a periscope from a German U-boat. The destroyers escorting &quot;Arkansas&quot; dropped depth charges but did not hit the alleged submarine. &quot;Arkansas&quot; arrived in Rosyth on 28 July, and joined the rest of Battleship Division 9 stationed there. For the remainder of the conflict, Battleship Division 9 operated as the 6th Battle Squadron of the Grand Fleet.

On 11 November, the Armistice with Germany that ended World War I went into effect. The terms of the Armistice required Germany to intern the bulk of the High Seas Fleet in Scapa Flow, under the supervision of the Grand Fleet. &quot;Arkansas&quot; and the other American warships participated in the internment; a combined fleet of 370 British, American, and French warships met the High Seas Fleet in the North Sea on 21 November, and escorted it into Scapa Flow. On 1 December, Battleship Division 9 was detached from the Grand Fleet, after which &quot;Arkansas&quot; departed the Firth of Forth for the Isle of Portland. She then went to sea to meet the ocean liner , which was carrying President Wilson to Europe. &quot;Arkansas&quot; and the other American naval forces in Europe escorted the ship into Brest, France, on 13 December. After completing the escort, &quot;Arkansas&quot; sailed for New York City, arriving on 26 December, where the fleet participated in a Naval Review for Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels.

=== Inter-war period ===
====1919–1927====

The peacetime training regimen for &quot;Arkansas&quot; consisted of individual training, an annual fleet maneuver, and periodic maintenance in drydock. She also participated in gunnery and engineering competitions. After returning to the United States, &quot;Arkansas&quot; went into drydock at the Norfolk Navy Yard for an extensive overhaul. She then rejoined the fleet to conduct training exercises off Cuba, after which she crossed the Atlantic, bound for Europe. She reached Plymouth, on 12 May 1919, and then took weather observations on 19 May, and later served as a reference vessel to guide the Navy Curtiss NC flying boats flying from Trepassey Bay, Newfoundland, to Europe. After completing that task, she steamed to Brest, on 10 June, and picked up Admiral William S. Benson, the Chief of Naval Operations, and his wife. &quot;Arkansas&quot; carried them back to New York, after Benson was finished at the Peace Conference in Paris, arriving on 20 June.

On 19 July, &quot;Arkansas&quot; departed Hampton Roads, to join her new assignment, the US Pacific Fleet, bound for San Francisco. She arrived 6 September, via the Panama Canal, and embarked Secretary and Mrs. Josephus Daniels. She took Daniels and his wife to Blakely Harbor, Washington, on 12 September, and the following day, participated in a naval review for President Wilson. On 19 September, &quot;Arkansas&quot; entered the Puget Sound Navy Yard for a general overhaul. She returned to the fleet in May 1920 for training operations off California. The Navy adopted a hull classification system, and on 17 July, assigned &quot;Arkansas&quot; the designation &quot;BB-33&quot;. She steamed to Hawaii, in September, the first time she went to the islands. In early 1921, &quot;Arkansas&quot; visited Valparaíso, Chile, where she was received by President Arturo Alessandri Palma; the ship&#x27;s crew manned the rail to honor the Chilean president.

In August 1921, &quot;Arkansas&quot; returned to the Atlantic Fleet, where she became the flagship of the Commander, Battleship Force, Atlantic Fleet. Throughout the 1920s, &quot;Arkansas&quot; carried midshipmen from the United States Naval Academy on summer cruises. She went on a tour of Europe in 1923; there, on 2 July, she stopped in Copenhagen, and was visited by King Christian X of Denmark. She also stopped in Lisbon and Gibraltar. Another midshipmen cruise to Europe followed in 1924; the cruise for the next year went to the west coast of the United States. On 30 June 1925, she stopped in Santa Barbara, California, to assist in the aftermath of the 1925 Santa Barbara earthquake. &quot;Arkansas&quot;, the destroyer , and the patrol craft &quot;PE-34&quot; sent detachments ashore to help the police in Santa Barbara. They also established a temporary radio station in the city.
After returning from the 1925 cruise, the ship was modernized at the Philadelphia Navy Yard. She had her twelve old coal-fired boilers replaced with four oil-fired models, which were trunked into a single larger funnel. She also had more deck armor added to protect her from plunging fire, and a short tripod mast was installed in place of the aft cage mast. The modernization was completed in November 1926, after which &quot;Arkansas&quot; conducted a shakedown cruise in the Atlantic. She returned to Philadelphia, where she ran acceptance trials before she could rejoin the fleet. On 5 September 1927, &quot;Arkansas&quot; was present for ceremonies unveiling a memorial tablet honoring the French soldiers and sailors who died during the Yorktown campaign in 1781.

====1928–1941====
She returned to training cruises in May 1928, when she took a crew of midshipmen into the Atlantic along the east coast, along with a trip down to Cuba. In June, she participated in a joint Army-Navy coast defense exercise as part of the hostile &quot;attacking&quot; fleet. In early 1929, &quot;Arkansas&quot; cruised in the Caribbean and near the Canal Zone. She returned to the United States in May 1929, for an overhaul in the New York Navy Yard. After emerging from drydock, she conducted another training cruise, this time to European waters; she spent time in the Mediterranean and visited Britain. &quot;Arkansas&quot; returned to the United States in August and operated with the Scouting Fleet off the east coast. The training cruise for 1930 again went to Europe. She called in Cherbourg, France, Kiel, Germany, Oslo, Norway, and Edinburgh, Scotland. The cruise continued through the end of the year, and in 1931, the battleship visited Copenhagen, Greenock, Scotland, and Cádiz and Gibraltar in Spain. By September, the ship had crossed the Atlantic, and she stopped in Halifax, Nova Scotia. In February, &quot;Arkansas&quot; participated in Fleet Problem XII. During the maneuvers, she served as Admiral Arthur L. Willard&#x27;s flagship, and she was &quot;sunk&quot; by a submarine. A month later, on 21–22 March, &quot;Arkansas&quot; conducted exercises with the carriers and .
&quot;Arkansas&quot; participated in the Yorktown Sesquicentennial celebrations in October 1931, marking the 150th anniversary of the Siege of Yorktown. She embarked President Herbert Hoover and his entourage on 17 October, and took them to the exposition, and returned them to Annapolis on 19–20 October. She then went into drydock for an extensive refit in the Philadelphia Navy Yard, which lasted until January 1932. During this time, she was under the command of George Landenberger. &quot;Arkansas&quot; was transferred to the Pacific Fleet after completing the refit; while en route, she stopped in New Orleans to participate in the Mardi Gras celebration. She operated off the west coast through early 1934, at which point she was transferred back to the Atlantic Fleet, where she served as the flagship of the Training Squadron.

She conducted another training cruise to Europe in the summer of 1934. She stopped in Plymouth, England, Nice, France, Naples, Italy, and Gibraltar. She returned to Annapolis in August, after which she steamed to Newport. In Newport, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt reviewed the battleship from the yacht &quot;Nourmahal&quot;. While there, &quot;Arkansas&quot; entered one of her cutters in a competition with the British cruiser for the Battenberg Cup, and the City of Newport Cup; &quot;Arkansas&quot;″s cutter won both races. The ship carried the 1st Battalion, 5th Marines to Culebra, for a Fleet Landing Exercise No. 1 (FLEX 1) in January 1935. She returned to training cruise duties in June, and she again took the midshipmen to Europe. Among the stops were Edinburgh, Oslo, Copenhagen, Gibraltar, and Funchal, on the island of Madeira. She disembarked the Naval Academy crew in August and began another training cruise to Halifax, this time for Naval Reservists, the following month. A refit was conducted in October after completing the cruise.

&quot;Arkansas&quot; participated in the FLEX 2 at Culebra in January 1936, and then visited New Orleans, during Mardi Gras. She went to Norfolk for a major overhaul that lasted through the spring of 1936. After completing the overhaul, the ship took another midshipmen crew to European waters; she called in the ports of Portsmouth, England, Gothenburg, Sweden, and Cherbourg, and returned to Annapolis, in August. As in the previous year, she conducted another Reserve training cruise, and then went into drydock for an overhaul in Norfolk. The remainder of the 1930s followed a similar pattern; in 1937, the midshipmen training cruise went to Europe, but the 1938 and 1939 cruises remained in the western Atlantic.

At the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, &quot;Arkansas&quot; was moored at Hampton Roads, preparing to depart on a training cruise for the Naval Reserve. She departed to transport seaplane mooring and aviation equipment from Norfolk to Narragansett Bay, where the Navy planned to set up a seaplane base. While in Newport, &quot;Arkansas&quot; picked up ordnance for destroyers and brought it back to Hampton Roads. After returning to Virginia, &quot;Arkansas&quot; was assigned to a reserve force for the Neutrality Patrols in the Atlantic, along with her sister , the battleships and and the carrier . On 11 January 1940, &quot;Arkansas&quot;, &quot;New York&quot;, and &quot;Texas&quot; left for fleet maneuvers off Cuba. She underwent an overhaul at Norfolk between 18 March and 24 May. After emerging from her refit, &quot;Arkansas&quot; conducted another midshipman training cruise, along with &quot;Texas&quot; and &quot;New York&quot;, to Panama and Venezuela. In late 1940, she conducted three Naval Reserve training cruises in the Atlantic.

On 19 December 1940, with 500 naval reservists on board, the &quot;Arkansas&quot; collided at ~0300 hrs. with the outbound &quot;Collier Melrose&quot;, of the Mystic Steamship Company of Boston, off of Sea Girt, New Jersey. Although a glancing blow, the collier&#x27;s below-water plates were cracked, and she sank just short of a Brooklyn drydock after a 40-mile race to port. &quot;The warship proceeded to her Hudson river anchorage, minus only some paint and with a smashed lifeboat.&quot;

Over the months that followed, the United States gradually edged toward war in the Atlantic. The ship was assigned to the escort force for the Marines deployed to occupy Iceland, in July 1941, along with &quot;New York&quot;, two cruisers, and eleven destroyers. The task force deployed from NS Argentia, Newfoundland, on 1 July, and were back in port by 19 July. Starting on 7 August, &quot;Arkansas&quot; went on a neutrality patrol in the mid-Atlantic that lasted a week. After returning to port, &quot;Arkansas&quot; traveled to the Atlantic Charter conference with President Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, which took place on board . While there, the US Under Secretary of State, Sumner Welles, stayed aboard &quot;Arkansas&quot;. She conducted another neutrality patrol between 2 and 11 September.

=== World War II ===
&quot;Arkansas&quot; was anchored in Casco Bay, Maine, on 7 December 1941, when Japan attacked Pearl Harbor and brought the United States into the war. A week later, she steamed to Hvalfjordur, Iceland, and returned to Boston on 24 January 1942. She conducted training maneuvers in Casco Bay, to prepare her crew for convoy escort duties. On 6 March, she arrived at Norfolk, to begin overhaul. The secondary battery was reduced to six 5-inch/51 cal guns. Also, 36 40 mm Bofors anti-aircraft (AA) guns (in quadruple mounts) and 26 20 mm Oerlikon AA guns were added, the experience at Pearl Harbor having made the US Navy aware of the need for increased light AA armament. The 3-inch/50 caliber gun armament was also increased from 8 guns to 10. Work lasted until 2 July, after which time &quot;Arkansas&quot; conducted a shakedown cruise in Chesapeake Bay; she then proceeded to New York, arriving on 27 July. There, she became the flagship of Task Force 38 (TF 38), the escort for a convoy of twelve transports bound for Scotland. The convoy arrived in Greenock, on 17 August, and &quot;Arkansas&quot; returned to New York on 4 September.

&quot;Arkansas&quot; again escorted a convoy to Scotland, returning to New York by 20 October. Thereafter, convoys were sent to North Africa, to support the invasion of North Africa. &quot;Arkansas&quot; covered her first such convoy, along with eight destroyers, on 3 November. She returned to New York on 11 December, where she went into dock for another overhaul. On 2 January 1943, &quot;Arkansas&quot; departed New York to conduct gunnery training in Chesapeake Bay. Back in New York by 30 January, the ship&#x27;s crew prepared for a return to convoy escort duty. She escorted two convoys to Casablanca, between February and April, before returning to New York, for yet another period in drydock, which lasted until 26 May. &quot;Arkansas&quot; returned to duty as a training ship for midshipmen based at Norfolk. She resumed her convoy escort duties after four months, and on 8 October, she steamed to Bangor, Northern Ireland. She remained in Northern Ireland, through November, and departed on 1 December, bound for New York. After arriving on 12 December, &quot;Arkansas&quot; went into dock for more repairs, and then returned to Norfolk, on 27 December. The ship escorted another convoy bound for Ireland, on 19 January 1944, before returning to New York, on 13 February. Another round of gunnery drills followed on 28 March, after which &quot;Arkansas&quot; went to Boston for more drydock period.
On 18 April, &quot;Arkansas&quot; departed for Northern Ireland, where she trained for shore bombardment duties, as she had been assigned to the shore bombardment force in support of Operation Overlord, the invasion of northern France. She was assigned to Group II, along with &quot;Texas&quot; and five destroyers. Her float plane artillery observer pilots were temporarily assigned to VOS-7 flying Spitfires from RNAS Lee-on-Solent (HMS Daedalus). On 3 June, she left her moorings, and on the morning of 6 June, took up a position about from Omaha Beach. At 05:52, the battleship&#x27;s guns fired in anger for the first time in her career. She bombarded German positions around Omaha Beach until 13 June, when she was moved to support ground forces in Grandcamp les Bains. On 25 June, &quot;Arkansas&quot; bombarded Cherbourg, in support of the American attack on the port; German coastal guns straddled her several times, but scored no hits. Cherbourg fell to the Allies the next day, after which &quot;Arkansas&quot; returned to port, first in Weymouth, England, and then to Bangor, Northern Ireland, on 30 June.

On 4 July, &quot;Arkansas&quot; departed Northern Ireland for the Mediterranean Sea; she reached Oran, Algeria, on 10 July, before proceeding on to Taranto, arriving on 21 July. There, she joined the support force for Operation Dragoon, the invasion of southern France. Again, the battleship provided gunfire support to the amphibious invasion along with six Allied cruisers, starting on 15 August. The bombardment lasted for two more days, after which she withdrew, first to Palermo, and then to Oran. &quot;Arkansas&quot; then returned to the United States, arriving in Boston, on 14 September, where she underwent another refit that lasted until early November. She then steamed to California, via the Panama Canal, and spent the rest of the year conducting training maneuvers. On 20 January 1945, &quot;Arkansas&quot; departed California for Pearl Harbor, and then proceeded to Ulithi, to join the fleet in preparation for the amphibious assault on Iwo Jima. There, she was assigned to Task Force 54 (TF 54), which included five other battleships, four cruisers, and sixteen destroyers.

On 16 February, &quot;Arkansas&quot; was in position off Iwo Jima, and at 06:00, she opened fire on Japanese positions on the island&#x27;s west coast. The bombardment lasted until 19 February, though she remained off the island throughout the Battle of Iwo Jima, ready to provide fire support to the American Marines ashore. She departed on 7 March, bound for Ulithi, and arrived on 10 March, where she rearmed and refueled in preparation for the next major operation in the Pacific War, the invasion of Okinawa. She departed Ulithi, on 21 March, and arrived off Okinawa, four days later, when she began the bombardment along with the rest of Task Force 54. The soldiers and Marines went ashore on 1 April, and &quot;Arkansas&quot; continued to provide gunfire support over the course of 46 days throughout the Battle of Okinawa. &quot;Kamikazes&quot; repeatedly attacked the ship, though none struck her. She left the island in May, arriving in Guam on 14 May. She then proceeded to Leyte Gulf, on 12 June, arriving four days later. There, she was assigned to Task Group 95.7, along with &quot;Texas&quot; and three cruisers. She remained in the Philippines until 20 August, when she departed for Okinawa, arriving in Buckner Bay on 23 August, by which time Japan had surrendered, ending World War II. Over the course of the war, &quot;Arkansas&quot; earned four battle stars.

=== Post-war ===
After the end of the war, &quot;Arkansas&quot; participated in Operation Magic Carpet, the repatriation of American servicemen from the Pacific. She took around 800 men back to the United States, departing on 23 September, and reaching Seattle, Washington on 15 October. She made another three Magic Carpet trips between Pearl Harbor and the continental United States to ferry more soldiers home. During the first months of 1946, &quot;Arkansas&quot; lay at San Francisco. In late April, the ship got underway for Hawaii. She reached Pearl Harbor on 8 May, and departed Pearl Harbor on 20 May, bound for Bikini Atoll, earmarked for use as a target for atomic bomb testing in Operation Crossroads. On 1 July, &quot;Arkansas&quot; was exposed to an air burst in ABLE, but survived with extensive shock damage to her upper works, while her hull and armored turrets were lightly damaged.

On 25 July, the battleship was sunk by the underwater nuclear test BAKER at Bikini Atoll. Unattenuated by air, the shock was &quot;transmitted directly to underwater hulls&quot;, and &quot;Arkansas&quot;, only from the epicenter, appeared to have been &quot;crushed as if by a tremendous hammer blow from below&quot;. It appears that the wave of water from the blast capsized the ship, which was then hammered down into the shallow bottom by the descent of the water column thrown up by the blast. Decommissioned on 29 July, &quot;Arkansas&quot; was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 15 August. The ship lies inverted in about of water at the bottom of Bikini Lagoon, where it acts as an artificial reef. There are many pictures of the wreck on the National Park Service website.

== Relationship with the Arkansas Flag ==
The &quot;Arkansas&quot; was the catalyst for the creation of the Flag of Arkansas. In 1912 the Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR) decided that they would present three flags to the battleship as she was nearing her commission date. The three flags the DAR chose to present were the American Flag, Navy battalion Ensign, and a state flag. When the DAR learned from the Arkansas Secretary of State, Earle W. Hodges, that Arkansas possessed no official state flag, they decided to hold a statewide competition to come up with one. The winning design was from Willie Kavanaugh Hocker of Pine Bluff, Arkansas, who was also a member of the DAR. On 26 February 1913, with a few alterations, Hocker&#x27;s design become the official flag of Arkansas and was soon thereafter presented to the USS Arkansas by the DAR.

<text>Sand art is the practice of modelling sand into an artistic form, such as sand brushing, sand sculpting, sand painting, or creating sand bottles. A sandcastle is a type of sand sculpture resembling a miniature building, often a castle. The drip castle variation uses wet sand that is dribbled down to form organic shapes before the sands dries.

Most sand play takes place on sandy beaches, where the two basic building ingredients, sand and water, are available in abundance. Some sand play occurs in dry sandpits and sandboxes, though mostly by children and rarely for art forms. Tidal beaches generally have sand that limits height and structure because of the shape of the sand grains. Good sculpture sand is somewhat dirty, having silt and clay that helps lock the irregular-shaped sand grains together.

Sand castles are typically made by children for fun, but there are also sand-sculpture contests for adults that involve large, complex constructions. The largest sandcastle made in a contest was 18 feet tall; the owner, Ronald Malcnujio, a five-foot-tall man, had to use several ladders, each the height of the sandcastle. His sculpture consisted of one ton of sand and 10 litres of water to sculpt. 

== Sand castles and sculptures ==
Sand grains will always stick together unless the sand is reasonably fine. While dry sand is loose, wet sand is adherent if the proper amounts of sand and water are mixed. The reason for this is that water forms little &quot;bridges&quot; between the grains of sand when it is damp due to the forces of surface tension.

When the sand dries out or gets wet, the shape of a structure may change, and &quot;landslides&quot; are common. A mix of fine (mostly sharper) and coarse sand granules is very important to achieve good &quot;sand construction&quot; results. Fine granules that have been rounded by the natural influences of seas, rivers or fluvials, in turn negatively influence the bonding between the individual granules as they more easily slide past each other.Shovels and buckets are the main construction tools used in creating sand castles and sand sculptures, although some people use only their hands. A simple sand castle can be made by filling a bucket with damp sand, placing it upside-down on the beach, and removing the bucket. For larger constructions, water from the sea to mix with the sand can be brought to the building site with a bucket or other container. Sometimes forms of other materials, such as wood or plastic are constructed to hold piles of sand in place and in specific shapes.

Tunnels large enough to enter are extremely hazardous; children and adults die every year when such underground chambers collapsed under weight and instability of sand, or due to the tide coming up or the structure being hit by a wave. Sometimes, a dam can be built to hold back the water, tidal forts, which are incredibly large sandcastles with thick walls to protect the keep from the sea, can be built, or canals can be dug to contain the water.

A variant to a formed sculpture is the drip castle, made by dribbling very wet sand.

Sand sculpting as an art form has become popular in coastal beach areas. Hundreds of annual competitions are held all over the world. Techniques can be quite sophisticated, and record-breaking achievements have been noted in the &quot;Guinness World Records&quot;. Sometimes, contests are staged as advertising or promotional events. Most sand sculptors come from other disciplines but a few earn their living solely from sand-related activities.

Notable sand sculpture artists include Sudarsan Pattnaik and M N Gowri who created the Mysore Sand Sculpture Museum.

===Festivals and competitions===
From 1989 until 2009, a World Championship in Sand Sculpture was held in Harrison Hot Springs in Harrison, British Columbia, Canada, also known as &quot;Harrisand&quot;. The competition had solo, double and team categories. The world championship was held in Fort Myers, Florida, and other venues for a limited time. Other countries hold their own versions of the world championships as it is not possible to get all the people who may qualify in the same place at the same time due to the expense and logistics.

The world&#x27;s tallest sand castle was built on Myrtle Beach, South Carolina by Team Sandtastic as part of the 2007 Sun Fun Festival. The structure was 49.55 feet (15.1 m) high. It took 10 days to construct and used 300 truckloads of sand. This record was broken in 2019 when a 58-feet tall sand castle was unveiled at Rügen in Germany. The tallest-ever sand castle was built by a group of international artists and was constructed with 11,000 tons of sand.

Since 2003, Bettystown beach in County Meath, Ireland has been home to the Irish annual National Sandcastle and Sand Sculpturing competition.

In Lappeenranta, Finland, there is an annual tourist sight called the Sandcastle (&quot;Hiekkalinna&quot;), where a work of art made of sand according to a changing theme is created every year.

The record for the number of individual sandcastles built in one hour, was set at Scarborough, England, on 18 August 2012. Four hundred people constructed 683 castles, with each being two feet wide and high, accompanied by four turrets.

=== Sand pagodas ===

In southeast Asia sand pagodas are created in order to build Buddhist merit The tradition has been going on since the 1500s.

== Play ==

One of the main attractions of a sandy beach, especially for children, is playing with the sand; it presents more possibilities than an ordinary sandbox. One can make a mountain, a (encountering clay or the water table), canals, tunnels, bridges, a sculpture (representing a person, animal, etc., like a statue, or a scale model of a building), amongst many other things.

Burying someone up to their neck in sand or burying oneself in such a manner is another popular beach activity.

* Sand angels
Sand angels are made in the same manner as snow angels; a person lies on their back in the sand, extending their arms and legs and swishes them back and forth.

* Fight against the tide

A popular game is building a heap of sand, as high as possible, to withstand the upcoming tide.
== Sand art ==

=== Sand raking and beach murals===
&quot;Sand raking&quot; is performed on a sandy beach where the artist rakes the dry top layer of sand, exposing the wet underlayer to create light-and-dark contrasts. Usually the designs are quite large and are similar to man-made art crop circles. The designs are ephemeral, and wash away with the next tide. Some notable artists working in this medium include Andres Amador, Sean Corcoran and Marc Treanor.
=== Moving sand art ===
Moving Sand Art or Sand Frame is a display in which there are multiple colors of sand in water between two sheets of glass. Unlike sand paintings, a sand glass is meant to be turned; the sand, traditionally in black and a light color, moves into new shapes with each turn. Unlike sand paintings, which are a traditional craft, these are found around the world in many colors and sizes.

=== Others ===
* Sandpainting is the art of pouring colored sands and other pigments onto a surface to make a painting.

* Sand bottles are created by pouring colored sands into a bottle to make a scene.

* Sand drawing is the creation of a drawing by scratching it out in a flat base of sand.

* Sand animation is the making of animation by manipulating sand to build figures, textures and movement, frame by frame.

<text>The Edmonton Trappers were a minor league baseball team in Edmonton, Alberta. They were a part of the Triple-A level in the Pacific Coast League, ending with the 2004 season. Their home games were played at Telus Field in downtown Edmonton.

The Trappers joined the PCL in 1981 when Edmonton businessman Peter Pocklington purchased the Ogden A&#x27;s franchise from Utah trucker Dennis Job. The team&#x27;s games were originally played in Renfrew Park (later called John Ducey Park). The Trappers were immediately popular with the community, often above the league average in attendance, attracting almost half a million fans every season. A total of 8 million fans came to see them play over the course of their 24-year existence.

In 1984, the Trappers (then the Triple-A affiliate of the California Angels) became the first Canadian franchise to win a championship. They were also the only team to win a PCL championship, and first to win any championship, under affiliation with the Angels. The manager was Moose Stubing.

In 1995, John Ducey Park was torn down and replaced by Telus Field where the Trappers celebrated three PCL titles in their last decade, most recently in 2002 under the affiliation of the Minnesota Twins. In 2003, the team became the major affiliate of the Montréal Expos. The Trappers were one of the most successful, longest running, and second-to-last affiliated team in Canada.

In 2004, future Montreal Expos and Toronto Blue Jays pitcher Scott Downs threw a no-hitter against Las Vegas on June 11. It was the first no hitter by a Trapper since August 8, 1996, when Aaron Small threw one against the Vancouver Canadians.

Edmonton qualified for playoffs for the last time in September 2003. They defeated the Portland Beavers to make the post-season, but were eliminated immediately by the Sacramento River Cats in a three-game sweep.

In October 2003, the Trappers&#x27; fate in Edmonton was sealed when the team, then owned by the Canadian Football League&#x27;s Edmonton Eskimos, was sold to a group led by hall of famer Nolan Ryan and his son Reid. The sale shocked many fans in Edmonton. The Ryans moved the team after the 2004 season to Round Rock, Texas, a suburb north of Austin, and it was renamed the Round Rock Express. The last home game in Edmonton had a sizeable crowd against the Las Vegas 51s, but it was rained out after only one inning.

<doc id="207103" wikidata="Q312060" url="?curid=207103" title="Vince Clarke">
<text>Vincent John Martin (born 3 July 1960), known professionally as Vince Clarke, is an English synth-pop musician and songwriter. Clarke has been the main composer and musician of the band Erasure since its inception in 1985, and was previously the main songwriter for several groups, including Depeche Mode, Yazoo, and the Assembly. In Erasure, he is known for his deadpan and low-key onstage demeanour, often remaining motionless over his keyboard, in sharp contrast to lead vocalist Andy Bell&#x27;s animated and hyperactive frontman antics. 

Erasure have recorded over 200 songs and have sold over 28 million albums worldwide. Clarke was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2020 as a member of Depeche Mode.

==Early life and influences==
Vincent John Martin was born on 3 July 1960 in South Woodford, Essex; he later moved to Basildon, Essex. He initially studied the violin and then the piano. Clarke&#x27;s early musical influences included Sparks, Paul Simon, and Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark (OMD), who inspired his interest in electronic music. Clarke also cites electronic influences such as the Human League, Daniel Miller and Fad Gadget.

In the late 1970s, Clarke and schoolmate Andy Fletcher formed a short-lived band called No Romance in China, with Clarke on vocals and guitar and Fletcher on bass guitar. In 1979, Clarke played guitar in the Plan, an Ultravox-influenced band, with friends Robert Marlow and Paul Langwith.

== Career ==
===Depeche Mode===
In 1980, after the Plan dissolved, Clarke and Fletcher formed Composition of Sound, and were soon joined by Martin Gore. Clarke provided vocals until lead vocalist Dave Gahan joined the band, which was renamed Depeche Mode. At that time he adopted the stage name Vince Clarke, by which he is currently known. The band initially adopted a slick synthesised electropop sound, which produced the studio album &quot;Speak &amp; Spell&quot; and the Clarke-penned singles &quot;Dreaming of Me&quot;, &quot;New Life&quot;, and &quot;Just Can&#x27;t Get Enough&quot; in 1981.

Clarke left Depeche Mode shortly thereafter. He commented on Depeche Mode&#x27;s later material as being a little dark for his taste, but good nonetheless. Clarke also stated that he did not enjoy the public aspects of success, such as touring and interviews, and found himself frequently at odds with his bandmates, particularly on the tour bus. He also stated: &quot;I think everybody in the band, especially myself, imagined that the reason we were doing so well was because of themselves ... We were pretty young and very lucky, and things had happened very quickly for us, and I don&#x27;t think we were really mature to handle the situation.&quot; Clarke was replaced by musician Alan Wilder.

===Yazoo===

Clarke then teamed with lead vocalist Alison Moyet (at the time known by the nickname of Alf) to form the popular synth-pop duo Yazoo (known as Yaz in the US), which produced two studio albums and a string of hits, including &quot;Only You&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Go&quot;, &quot;Situation&quot;, &quot;The Other Side of Love&quot; and &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Diary&quot;.

Yazoo disbanded in 1983, and Moyet had a successful solo career. Yazoo reformed in 2008/2009 for a series of live dates to celebrate 25 years since the duo&#x27;s split.

===The Assembly===

Clarke teamed up with Eric Radcliffe in 1983. Their idea was to collaborate with different artists on each new single, under the name the Assembly. With singer Feargal Sharkey, former lead vocalist of the Undertones, they scored the top 5 UK hit &quot;Never Never&quot;. Meanwhile, Clarke founded the label Reset Records with Radcliffe. During 1983 and 1984 he produced four singles, &quot;The Face of Dorian Gray&quot;, &quot;I Just Want to Dance&quot;, &quot;Claudette&quot;, and &quot;Calling All Destroyers&quot; for his friend Robert Marlow, which were released on this label. They also produced a studio album, at first shelved but later released in 1999, under the name &quot;The Peter Pan Effect&quot;. In 1985, another collaboration took place with Paul Quinn of Bourgie Bourgie; the result was the single &quot;One Day&quot; by Vince Clarke &amp; Paul Quinn. However, the project never took off, and Clarke moved to other projects.

===Erasure===

In early 1985, Clarke placed an advertisement in &quot;Melody Maker&quot; for a singer, and one applicant was Andy Bell, who was a fan of his earlier projects. He teamed with Bell to form the group Erasure, and the duo became one of the major selling acts in British music with international hits like &quot;Oh L&#x27;amour&quot;, &quot;Sometimes&quot;, &quot;Chains of Love&quot;, &quot;A Little Respect&quot;, &quot;Drama!&quot;, &quot;Blue Savannah&quot;, &quot;Chorus&quot;, &quot;Love to Hate You&quot;, &quot;Take a Chance on Me&quot;, and &quot;Always&quot;.

As of November 2022, the duo have released 19 studio albums and have enjoyed a long string of hit singles spanning their four decades together.

=== VCMG ===

In 2011, Clarke collaborated with his former Depeche Mode colleague Martin Gore for the first time since 1981, as techno duo VCMG, on an instrumental minimalist electronic dance album called &quot;Ssss&quot;, released on 12 March 2012. The first EP, entitled &quot;Spock&quot;, was released worldwide exclusively on Beatport on 30 November 2011. The second EP, &quot;Single Blip&quot;, was once again first released exclusively on Beatport on 20 February 2012. Their third EP, &quot;Aftermaths&quot;, was released on 20 August 2012.

===Collaborations and other works===

In July 1984, Clarke teamed with Stephen Luscombe of Blancmange, Pandit Dinesh, and Asha Bhosle. The group, West India Company, released a four-track, self-titled EP.

Clarke worked with synth-pop producer Martyn Ware (of Heaven 17 and The Human League) in 1999 as The Clarke &amp; Ware Experiment and released the album &quot;Pretentious&quot;. The duo collaborated again in 2001 for the album &quot;Spectrum Pursuit Vehicle&quot;, which was created with &quot;3D music technology&quot; specifically designed for listening in headphones. That same year also saw the release of the Clarke-produced album &quot;Erasure&#x27;s Vince Clarke&quot;, which featured &quot;The Peter Pan Effect&quot;, an album that he and Eric Radcliffe produced for his long-time friend Robert Marlow. Clarke wrote &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Together&quot; for the pop girl group Girl Authority for their second and final studio album &quot;Road Trip&quot; (2007). The song was originally meant to be for Depeche Mode but was never recorded by them. Clarke also co-wrote &quot;What Do I Want from You?&quot; with Freeform Five, for their debut studio album &quot;Strangest Things&quot; (2005).

Clarke participated in a 2000 project called Family Fantastic. They produced the album &quot;Nice!&quot;. In 2008 Family Fantastic released a second album, entitled &quot;Wonderful&quot;. In 2001, Clarke founded Illustrious Co. Ltd. with Martyn Ware, to create new forms of spatialised sound composition using their unique 3D AudioScape system, collaborating with fine artists, educational establishments, the performing arts, live events, corporate clients, and educational settings round the world. In 2004, Clarke provided additional music for an episode of Johnny Bravo titled &quot;The Time of My Life&quot;. This was a collaboration with Richard Butler of the Psychedelic Furs.

On 21 May 2009, Clarke was awarded with an &quot;Outstanding Song Collection&quot; prize, during the Ivor Novello Awards ceremony of the same day, in recognition of 30 years in the music industry. Clarke was featured in the BBC Four documentary &quot;Synth Britannia&quot; (2009).

In 2012, Clarke produced a cover of the Depeche Mode song &quot;Fly on the Windscreen&quot; featuring Ane Brun. Clarke also did DJ sets in various locations in North America and Europe and also continued his production work of remixing songs for Dido and Chad Valley. 

On 14 July 2015, Clarke announced a collaboration with Jean-Michel Jarre called &quot;Automatic&quot;, released as a part of the studio album &quot;Electronica 1: The Time Machine&quot; on 16 October 2015. On 10 June 2016, in collaboration with Paul Hartnoll, Clarke digitally released the album &quot;2 Square&quot; on his new record label, VeryRecords.

Since 2017, Clarke has hosted &quot;The Synthesizer Show&quot; with VeryRecords artist Reed Hays on Maker Park Radio, a non-profit community streaming radio station from Staten Island, New York. Clarke&#x27;s first solo album called &quot;Songs of Silence&quot; was released on 17 November 2023.

==Production and recording methods==
When Clarke started making music, synthesisers were predominantly analogue; digital synthesizers were rare and would remain so until the launch of the Yamaha DX7 in 1983. In order to connect analogue synthesisers, analogue drum machines and analogue sequencers together, multiple CV/gate cables were required between each device. This system was not standardised, so inter-operability between instruments from different manufacturers was not always straightforward. In addition, some manufacturers used their own proprietary interfaces. When an industry-wide standard called MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) was introduced in 1983, Clarke, like most other electronic musicians, gradually migrated to the new technology. However, he continued to prefer his older analogue instruments:

&quot;... CV and Gate is tighter. I can hear and feel that it&#x27;s tighter than MIDI – we can even prove it using &#x27;scopes&#x27;. Because everything is clocked simply, it arrives bang on the beat. The whole production starts to &#x27;tick over&#x27;. Just look at Kraftwerk&#x27;s stuff. I think that &#x27;feel&#x27; has been lost with MIDI sequencers. No matter what you do with MIDI, the music will never sound as good as it did in the good old Futurist days. That&#x27;s why our tracks sound the way they do.&quot;

For Erasure&#x27;s fifth studio album &quot;Chorus&quot; (1991), he gathered together his collection of analogue synthesisers from various recording studio locations in London and set up a small studio in Amsterdam. This led Clarke to assemble an intricate patch system to more easily enable the control of his analogue instruments:

&quot;... the secret is having a good patch system – not as in patching to the mixing desk, but in patching CV and Gate. Because we don&#x27;t use MIDI at all, you have to run three or four cables between each synth module – CV, Gate, Filter, Amplitude or whatever – and you&#x27;ve got to have a really unique system to do that.&quot;&quot;

In 1993 Clarke described his approach to songwriting:

&quot;Andy [Bell] and I get together with a guitar and a tape recorder, I&#x27;ll strum some chords, he&#x27;ll sing a melody, and we work in little sections, four or eight bars long. Then we&#x27;ll try stringing the sections together. It&#x27;s like a jigsaw puzzle. I find it very hard to relate songwriting to synthesisers, actually – we write songs in a very traditional way. The electronic side of things is just to create the atmosphere. It&#x27;s mostly just messing about..! Once we&#x27;ve worked out a song, I start programming up the arrangement on the BBC UMI sequencer, which lets me run 16 synths simultaneously. That way you get a better idea if parts are working together or not. Then we start refining the individual sounds. And finally the whole lot is transferred to my Roland MC4, piece by piece, so it&#x27;s being run in CV and Gate. Once we&#x27;ve got that, it&#x27;s a case of Andy sketching out vocal ideas – in the studio we use two 48 track digital tape machines, which gives Dinger 24 tracks just for his voice!&quot; &quot;

Clarke continued to expand his collection of analogue synthesisers and in 1994 set up &quot;37B&quot;, a recording studio built adjacent to his custom-made home, &quot;Ammonite&quot;, in Chertsey, Surrey. From 1994 to 2003, all Erasure studio albums were either wholly or in part recorded at &quot;37B&quot;.

In 2004 Clarke moved to Maine. While waiting for his studio equipment to be shipped from the UK he began using an Apple Mac laptop with Logic Pro, Max/MSP, and various software synthesisers (many of which were analogue emulations). Since then he has continued to use Logic Pro, along with both software and analogue synthesisers:

&quot;Nowadays, you can take the best bits from digital and analogue. On certain projects – say, if I&#x27;m doing library music – where you need to have instant recall all the time, then it&#x27;s obviously much more convenient to use the computer. When it comes to writing a new song, though, I still like to have the old analogue gear there, too. But, a lot of soft synths have a character of their own, too; the Moog Modular V is just crazy! I think that analogue has an inherent sound to it – it&#x27;s like the old argument over vinyl versus CD. It seems that you hear more frequencies coming from an analogue synth than you do from a software synth, but the great thing about the latter is that you can do far more complex modulation, both within the synth itself and on the keyboard. To emulate any of those really complex modulations on an analogue ... well, you&#x27;d need a mile of cable.&quot; &quot;&quot;

As of 2009, Clarke has installed his analogue synthesisers alongside his Logic Pro-based workstation in a custom-built commercial studio called &quot;The Cabin&quot; in Maine.

==Personal life==
Clarke was married to Tracy Hurley Martin (the twin sister of Tonya Hurley) who was a booking agent and publicist to various entertainment artists. Among the musicians Tracy served as a publicist for included Prince, George Michael and Clarke&#x27;s former band Depeche Mode. She also represented “Goosebumps” and the Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen brand. Several films she produced were screened at the Tribeca and Edinburgh film festivals. Tracy died in January 2024 after two years of stomach cancer. She is survived by her twin sister Tonya, Clarke, and their son Oscar.

<text>RE/MAX Field (formerly Edmonton Ballpark, and Telus Field) is a baseball stadium in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. It has been home to several minor league baseball clubs; its last affiliated tenant was the Edmonton Trappers, a AAA Pacific Coast League club. It was also home to the Edmonton Capitals, an independent team that has been inactive since 2011. The Edmonton Prospects of the Western Canadian Baseball League (WCBL) were the main tenant from 2012 to 2019. The ballpark was mostly unused in 2020 and 2021 because of the COVID-19 pandemic, but the Edmonton Riverhawks of the West Coast League have been the main tenants since 2022. The facility is in the North Saskatchewan River Valley, in the neighbourhood of Rossdale.

==History==

Opened in 1995, Telus Field replaced the 60-year-old John Ducey Park (formerly &quot;Renfrew Park&quot;) on the same site. The stadium&#x27;s naming rights were purchased by the Telus telecommunications company in September 1995 for a 14-year deal.
It has walls all the way around except in centre field, where the batter&#x27;s eye is a green monster which is the third highest wall in professional baseball. Three players, Matthew LeCroy, Michael Cuddyer, and Todd Sears have hit home runs over it. Telus Field held the IBAF World Cup Women&#x27;s baseball in the summer of 2004 and from July 25 to August 3, 2008, the park held the IBAF AAA World Junior Championships for the 7th time since it started in 1981.

Despite Telus&#x27;s naming rights expiring in 2009 the stadium continued to use the name Telus Field until opening the 2016 season as Edmonton Ballpark, or simply Ballpark. Being displaced by the 2016 Fort McMurray wildfire, the Fort McMurray Giants played their inaugural season at the then Edmonton Ballpark. In May 2017 the stadium was renamed RE/MAX Field by the Edmonton Prospects; gaining naming rights and naming the park after the team&#x27;s sponsor, RE/MAX, for three years.

On May 20, 2020, Baseball Edmonton Inc., a group led by former Edmonton Oilers player Randy Gregg, reached a deal with the city of Edmonton to lease the stadium for ten years. Gregg said that his group would try to secure an agreement for a second WCBL team to play at RE/MAX field, but he hoped the Prospects would continue to play there as well. However, the owner of the Prospects claimed the ongoing negotiations regarding their use of the field &quot;[seemed] fraught with challenges.&quot; Gregg also outlined several possible plans to expand use of the field throughout the year, including the inclusion of minor baseball leagues, collaborations with local cultural and music groups, and an indoor attachment under the left field bleachers to allow for greater use of the facility during the winter. Baseball Edmonton Inc. advocated for the stadium to be included in the planned redevelopment of the Rossdale neighbourhood.

The Prospects played the 2021 and 2022 seasons as a road team and plan to move to the Spruce Grove Metro Ballpark in 2025. The Edmonton Riverhawks of the West Coast League will be the main tenant at RE/MAX Field beginning with the 2022 season.

==Features==
RE/MAX Field uses natural grass in the outfield and FieldTurf in the infield; originally AstroTurf was used, before replaced in 2005 and again in 2021. Artificial turf was chosen for lower maintenance costs, because it allows for a better drainage system so the infield can return to a playable state quicker than a grass infield would, and to minimize damage to the infield when concerts are held at the stadium.

The park has ground-level luxury suites with box and general seating built on top. The Home Plate VIP Lounge on the main concourse is located directly behind the plate, incorporating a bar and a restaurant with a view of the field from seats inside and outside. The lounge includes trophies and pictures of early Edmonton baseball teams. The capacity of the stadium is 9,200.

The dimensions are to left field, to left centre, to centre field, to right centre and to right field.

The stadium concourse features pictures of historic moments in Trapper history, including Ron Kittle&#x27;s 50-home-run season. There are also pictures from every Trapper championship and trophies.

==Events==
*January 21 – Åbo Svenska Teater in Åbo (Turku), Finland, opens with a performance of the Swedish-language play &quot;Gubben i Bergsbygden&quot;.
*March – W. Harrison Ainsworth takes over editorship of &quot;Bentley&#x27;s Miscellany&quot; from Charles Dickens at the end of the year. Until April serializations of their respective novels &quot;Jack Sheppard&quot; and &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; have been running simultaneously in the magazine.
*April – Washington Irving begins contributing regularly to &quot;The Knickerbocker&quot;, and will publish thirty new pieces in the magazine through March 1841 — including &quot;The Creole Village,&quot; where he coins the phrase &quot;the almighty dollar&quot;.
*May 31 – An important British constitutional case of &quot;Stockdale v Hansard&quot; begins when publisher John Joseph Stockdale sues for libel after John Roberton&#x27;s pseudo-medical work &quot;On Diseases of the Generative System&quot; (1811) is declared in a parliamentary report to be indecent.
*September – The first known London production of &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost&quot; after Shakespeare&#x27;s era opens at the Theatre Royal, Covent Garden, with Madame Vestris as Rosaline.

**Mikhail Lermontov publishes the first two parts of &quot;A Hero of Our Time&quot; (Герой нашего времени, &quot;Geroy nashevo vremeni&quot;) in &quot;Otechestvennye Zapiski&quot;. The novel comes to be seen as a pioneering classic of Russian psychological realism.
**&quot;Sir Gawain and the Green Knight&quot;, a late 14th-century Middle English alliterative romance by the &#x27;Pearl Poet&#x27;, is first published complete in &quot;Syr Gawayne&quot;, a collection of early romance poems by Scottish and English authors relating to that knight of the Round Table, edited by Frederic Madden for the Bannatyne Club.

<text>Elizabeth Smart (December 27, 1913 – March 4, 1986) was a Canadian poet and novelist. Her best-known work is the novel &quot;By Grand Central Station I Sat Down and Wept&quot; (1945), an extended prose poem inspired by her romance with the poet George Barker.

==Early life and education==
Smart was born to a prominent family in Ottawa, Ontario; her father, Russel Smart, was a lawyer, and the family had a summer house on Kingsmere Lake located next door to the future Prime Minister of Canada, William Lyon Mackenzie King. Her sister, Jane became a filmmaker, teacher and sculptor.

Smart attended the Ottawa Normal School in her formative years, but was soon transferred to the Elmwood School, a private prep school for girls located in an affluent Ottawa neighbourhood. She later attended Hatfield Hall in Cobourg, Ontario for secondary school. 

At the age of 11, Smart was confined to bed for a year due to a misdiagnosed &quot;leaky heart valve&quot;. She began writing at an early age, publishing her first poem at the age of 10 and compiling a collection of poetry at 15. In her youth, she often kept regular journals, a habit she would keep up throughout most of her life.

Smart grew up among the social elite of Ottawa through her father&#x27;s connections as a lawyer. Her mother often hosted parties for prominent politicians and civil servants. As a result, Smart socialized with many members of Ottawa&#x27;s political class who were or would become important figures in Canadian history, including acquaintances such as Graham Spry, Charles Ritchie, Lester B. Pearson, and William Lyon Mackenzie King. 

At the age of 18, following graduation from secondary school, Smart traveled to England to study music at the University of London.

In 1937, Smart took a job as secretary to the noted Mrs. Alfred Watt, head of the Associated Country Women of the World, an international organization for rural women, travelling extensively throughout the world accompanying Watt to various conferences. It was during this time that Smart happened across a book of poetry by George Barker, immediately falling in love not only with the poetry, but with the man himself.

After her travels with Mrs. Watt, Smart returned to Ottawa, where she spent six months writing society notes for the women&#x27;s page of &quot;The Ottawa Journal&quot;. At parties she would often ask about Barker, saying she wanted to meet and marry him. Soon Smart began a correspondence with the poet.

==Relationship with George Barker==
Eager to launch her writing career, Smart quit the &quot;Journal&quot; and left Ottawa for good. Traveling on her own, she visited New York, Mexico and California, joining a writers&#x27; colony at Big Sur. While there, Smart made contact with Barker through Lawrence Durrell, paying to fly Barker and his wife to the United States from Japan where he was teaching. Soon after meeting, they began a tumultuous affair which was to last for years.

In 1941, after becoming pregnant, Smart returned to Canada, settling in Pender Harbour, British Columbia to have the child she would name Georgina. Barker attempted to visit her in Canada, but Smart&#x27;s family influenced government officials: he was stopped at the border and turned back because of &quot;moral turpitude&quot;. During this time Smart produced her best-known work, &quot;By Grand Central Station I Sat Down and Wept&quot; (1945).

Smart soon returned to the United States and began work as a file clerk for the British embassy in Washington. Two years later, in 1943, during the height of the war, she sailed to the United Kingdom to join Barker. There she gave birth to their second child, Christopher Barker, and obtained employment at the British Ministry of Defence to support her children.

Just 2000 copies of &quot;By Grand Central Station I Sat Down and Wept&quot; were published in 1945 by Editions Poetry London, and it did not achieve popularity until its paperback reissue in 1966.

It is a fictional work, largely based on Smart&#x27;s affair with Barker up until that point. &quot;The power of emotion to transform one&#x27;s perspective on the world,&quot; a recent &quot;Open Letters Monthly&quot; review of the novel states, &quot;is the theme of this wildly poetic novel. The inspiration for Smart&#x27;s classic work of prose poetry is just as famous as the book itself.

Smart&#x27;s mother Louise (&quot;Louie&quot;) was not pleased with the book. Again availing influence with government officials, she led a successful campaign to have its publication banned in Canada. Of those copies that made their way into the country from overseas, Louise Smart bought up as many as she could find and had them burned. 

Barker visited Smart often in London where she worked. She became pregnant again, and was fired from the Ministry of Information. Their affair produced two more children (Sebastian, born 1945, and Rose Emma, born 1947). Through it all Barker, who was Catholic, said he would leave his wife for Smart, but this never happened (he was to have fifteen children by several different women). They lived a bohemian lifestyle and associated with many of the &#x27;Soho&#x27; artists. Christopher Barker writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot; about this period noted: &quot;On many occasions through the early Sixties, writers and painters such as David Gascoyne, Paddy Kavanagh, Roberts MacBryde and Colquhoun and Paddy Swift [Swift lived downstairs from Smart and his wife, Agnes, wrote cookbooks with Smart] would gather at Westbourne Terrace in Paddington, our family home at that time. They came for editorial discussions about their poetry magazine, &quot;X&quot;.&quot;

In addition to the unconventional nature of the relationship, the affair was fraught with turmoil. Barker was a heavy drinker and Smart took up the habit, which intensified when the two were together. The couple were involved in numerous fights; during one argument, Smart bit off part of Barker&#x27;s upper lip. Nonetheless, as evidenced from writings in her journals, Smart&#x27;s love for Barker continued for the remainder of her life.

==Single mother and writer==
Raising four children on her own, Smart worked for 13 years as an advertising copywriter, becoming the highest-paid copywriter in England. She joined the staff of &quot;Queen&quot; magazine in 1963, later becoming an editor. During this time her physical involvement with Barker waned and she took several other lovers, male and female.

Meanwhile, &quot;By Grand Central Station I Sat Down and Wept&quot; had been circulating in London and New York, acquiring a cult following that led to its paperback reissue in 1966 and critical acclaim. In the same year, Smart retired from commercial writing and relocated to a cottage in north Suffolk named &quot;The Dell&quot;.

It was at The Dell that Smart produced the bulk of her subsequent literary work, much of which has been published posthumously. Eager to make up for the time away from creative writing forced by the demands of raising her children, Smart wrote voluminously and on a number of subjects, poetry and prose, even her passion for gardening.

In 1977, following a 32-year absence from the book world, Smart published two new works, &quot;The Assumption of the Rogues &amp; Rascals&quot; and a small collection of poetry, titled &quot;A Bonus&quot;. Later, &quot;In the Meantime&quot; (1984), a collection of Smart&#x27;s unpublished poetry and prose appeared, and her two volumes of journals, &quot;Necessary Secrets: The Journals of Elizabeth Smart&quot; (1986) were published posthumously.

Smart returned to Canada for a brief stay from 1982 to 1983, becoming writer-in-residence at the University of Alberta. Afterward she spent a year in Toronto on a Canada Council writer&#x27;s grant before returning to England. In 1986 she died in London of a heart attack. She is buried in St George&#x27;s churchyard, St Cross South Elmham, Suffolk.

An hour-long documentary, &quot;Elizabeth Smart: On the Side of the Angels&quot; (1991) by Maya Gallus starred actor Jackie Burroughs as Elizabeth Smart and was narrated by author Michael Ondaatje. The publication of her journals in &quot;On The Side of the Angels&quot; brought further posthumous critical appreciation

==Influence==
Morrissey, former lead singer of the British band the Smiths, has talked of his love for Elizabeth Smart. References to &quot;By Grand Station Central I Sat Down And Wept&quot; are found in a number of Smiths songs, in particular &quot;What She Said&quot;, &quot;Reel Around The Fountain&quot; and &quot;Well, I Wonder&quot;, and as well, the title of the Smiths compilation album &quot;Louder Than Bombs&quot;.

Ian Brown used a passage from Elizabeth&#x27;s poem &quot;A Musical Note&quot; to name his third solo album &quot;The Music of the Spheres&quot;.

Canadian playwright Wendy Lill wrote a play entitled &quot;Memories of You&quot; (1989) about the life of Elizabeth Smart.

<text>Elizabeth Ann Gilmour (née Smart; born November 3, 1987) is an American child safety activist and commentator for ABC News. She gained national attention at age 14 when she was abducted from her home in Salt Lake City by Brian David Mitchell. Mitchell and his wife, Wanda Barzee, held Smart captive for nine months until she was rescued by police officers on a street in Sandy, Utah.

Smart has since gone on to work as an activist and advocate for missing persons and speaking out against abstinence-only education. Her life and abduction have been the subject of numerous non-fiction books and films.

==Early life==
Elizabeth Ann Smart was born on November 3, 1987, in Salt Lake City, Utah, to Edward &quot;Ed&quot; and Lois Smart. Her family was part of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. She is the second-oldest child in her family; she has four brothers and one sister. Smart attended Bryant Middle School and East High School in Salt Lake City. She later enrolled in Brigham Young University, where she earned her Bachelor of Music in harp performance.

==Kidnapping==

On June 5, 2002, 14-year-old Smart was abducted at knifepoint from her bedroom in her family&#x27;s house in Salt Lake City, Utah. For the next nine months, she was raped daily, tied up, and threatened with death if she attempted to escape. She was rescued by police officers on March 12, 2003, on a public street in Sandy, Utah, from her home. Two witnesses recognized abductors Brian David Mitchell and Wanda Ileen Barzee from an &quot;America&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot; episode.

On November 16, 2009, Barzee pled guilty to assisting in the kidnapping of Elizabeth Smart as part of a plea bargain with prosecutors. On May 19, 2010, federal Judge Dale A. Kimball sentenced Barzee to 15 years in federal prison. As part of a plea deal between the defense and federal prosecutors, he gave Barzee credit for seven years that she had already served. The court found Mitchell competent to stand trial for kidnapping and sexual assault charges. He was found guilty on both counts and sentenced in May 2011 to two life terms in federal prison.

==Activism and media coverage==

Smart&#x27;s uncle, Tom Smart, and author Lee Benson wrote a book about the search for Smart, &quot;In Plain Sight: The Startling Truth Behind the Elizabeth Smart Investigation&quot;. Her father wrote another book about Smart&#x27;s kidnapping, called &quot;Bringing Elizabeth Home&quot;. A television movie, &quot;The Elizabeth Smart Story&quot;, was made in 2003, based on the book by Smart&#x27;s father.

On March 8, 2006, Smart spoke before the United States Congress to support sexual predator legislation and the AMBER Alert system. On July 26, 2006, she spoke at an event held following the signing of the Adam Walsh Act. Smart was one of five recovered young adults who contributed entries to the 2008 book &quot;You&#x27;re Not Alone&quot;, which was published by the U.S. Department of Justice. She appeared at a May 2008 event promoting the book. In 2009, Smart commented on the kidnapping of Jaycee Lee Dugard. She shared that, in her own experience of recovering from trauma, she had found dwelling on the past to be unproductive.

In October 2009, Smart spoke at the 2009 Women&#x27;s Conference in California (hosted by Maria Shriver) on the topic of overcoming obstacles in life. In 2011, Smart founded the Elizabeth Smart Foundation, which aims to bring hope and end the victimization and exploitation of sexual assault through prevention, recovery, and advocacy. In March 2011, Smart was one of four women awarded the Diane von Furstenberg Award. On July 7, 2011, ABC News announced that she would work as a commentator for them, mainly focusing on missing persons.

In July 2012, Theta Phi Alpha National Fraternity honored Smart with the Siena Medal award. The medal is the highest honor the organization bestows upon a non-member. They named it after their patroness, St. Catherine of Siena.

On May 1, 2013, in a speech at a human trafficking conference at Johns Hopkins University, Smart discussed the need to emphasize individual self-worth in fighting human trafficking and the importance of dispelling cultural myths surrounding girls&#x27; loss of value upon sexual contact. Having been raped by her captor, she recalled the destructive impact of exposure to abstinence-only sexual education programs such as those stressed in her Mormon faith.

Many of them teach that a sexually active girl is akin to a chewed piece of gum. &quot;I thought, &#x27;Oh, my gosh, I&#x27;m that chewed up piece of gum, nobody re-chews a piece of gum, you throw it away.&#x27; And that&#x27;s how easy it is to feel like you no longer have worth, you no longer have value,&quot; Smart said. &quot;Why would it even be worth screaming out? Why would it even make a difference if you are rescued? Your life still has no value.&quot; Smart went on to ask that listeners educate children on having self-worth, avoiding viewing themselves as victims.

Smart described suicidal thoughts after the first of many rapes by her captor saying &quot;I felt like I wasn&#x27;t even human anymore.&quot;

In October 2013, &quot;My Story&quot;, a memoir of Smart&#x27;s experience co-written with Chris Stewart, was published by St. Martin&#x27;s Press. The book details both Smart&#x27;s kidnapping and the formation of the Elizabeth Smart Foundation, which works to promote awareness about abductions. Smart has played the harp on national television in the United States.

In February 2014, Smart testified before the Utah State House of Representatives in favor of HB 286. The bill would create an optional curriculum for use in Utah schools to provide training on child sexual abuse prevention. In early 2015, Faith Counts featured Smart in a video in which she explains how her religion sustained her through her ordeal and helped her heal. As of September 2016, Smart is a correspondent for the true-crime show &quot;Crime Watch Daily&quot;. Various state politicians have proposed bills that would require all computers to have a pornography filter, branding it the &quot;Elizabeth Smart Law.&quot; However, in March 2018, her spokesman denied her relationship to the proposal. Her lawyer sent a cease and desist letter to the politicians in which they were ordered not to use her name.

On June 5, 2017, on the 15th anniversary of her abduction, Lifetime aired the made-for-TV film titled &quot;I Am Elizabeth Smart&quot;, narrated and produced by Smart, which tells the story of her kidnapping from her perspective. The film starred Alana Boden as Elizabeth Smart, Skeet Ulrich as Brian David Mitchell, Deirdre Lovejoy as Wanda Ileen Barzee, George Newbern as Ed Smart, and Anne Openshaw as Lois Smart. In 2018, Smart published &quot;Where There&#x27;s Hope: Healing, Moving Forward, and Never Giving Up&quot; with St. Martin&#x27;s Press.

In 2021, Smart competed on &quot;The Masked Dancer&quot; as &quot;Moth&quot;. She was eliminated during the third episode of the series, placing eighth overall in the competition.

In 2022, Elizabeth Smart was the executive producer of the Lifetime movie &quot;Stolen By Their Father&quot; as part of its &quot;Ripped From the Headlines&quot; feature film which talked about Lizbeth Meredith&#x27;s plans to reclaim her daughters after being kept in Greece by Meredith&#x27;s ex-husband Greg during their visit to him.

In 2023, Smart was the executive producer of the Lifetime movie &quot;The Girl Who Escaped: The Kara Robinson Story&quot; as part of its &quot;Ripped From the Headlines&quot; feature film which detailed the abduction of Kara Robinson at the hands of Richard Evonitz. She was later the executive producer of &quot;Abducted By My Teacher: The Elizabeth Thomas Story&quot; as part of its &quot;Ripped From the Headlines&quot; feature film which detailed the kidnapping of Elizabeth Thomas.

In 2024, Smart was the executive producer of the Lifetime movie &quot;The Girl Locked Upstairs: The Tanya Kach Story&quot; as part of its &quot;Ripped From the Headlines&quot; feature film which detailed the kidnapping of Tanya Nicole Kach.

==Personal life==
On November 11, 2009, Smart left Salt Lake City to serve as a missionary for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Paris. Smart temporarily returned from her mission in November 2010 to serve as the chief witness in the federal trial of Brian David Mitchell. After the trial, she returned to France to finish her mission, coming home to Utah in early 2011.

While serving as missionaries in the Paris Mission, Smart met Scotland native Matthew Gilmour. In January 2012, after a courtship of one year, they became engaged. They married on February 18, 2012, in a private ceremony in the Laie Hawaii Temple. Since then, the couple have had three children: daughter Chloe Rose on February 7, 2015; son James on April 2, 2017; and daughter Olivia on November 7, 2018. As of 2023, the family lives in Wasatch County, Utah.

In 2019, Smart&#x27;s father, Ed, came out as gay and left the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, leading to the divorce of her parents. Smart stated that she would support both of her parents during this time.

In 2019, while traveling home to Utah aboard a Delta Air Lines flight, Smart alleged that she was awakened by a male passenger next to her rubbing her inner thigh. She reported the incident and began a self-defense program for women and girls called Smart Defense.

<text>The British Overseas Territories (BOTs) or alternatively referred to as the United Kingdom Overseas Territories (UKOTs) are the fourteen territories with a constitutional and historical link with the United Kingdom that, while not forming part of the United Kingdom itself, are part of its sovereign territory. The permanently inhabited territories are delegated varying degrees of internal self-governance, with the United Kingdom retaining responsibility for defence, foreign relations, and internal security, and ultimate responsibility for governance. Three of the territories are chiefly or only inhabited by military or scientific personnel, the rest hosting significant civilian populations. All fourteen have the British monarch as head of state. These UK government responsibilities are assigned to various departments of the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office and are subject to change.

==Population==
Most of the territories retain permanent civilian populations, with the exceptions of the British Antarctic Territory, South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands (which host only officials and research station staff) and the British Indian Ocean Territory (used as a military base). Permanent residency for the approximately 7,000 civilians living in the Sovereign Base Areas of Akrotiri and Dhekelia is limited to citizens of the Republic of Cyprus.

Collectively, the territories encompass a population of about 250,000 people and a land area of about . The vast majority of this land area constitutes the almost uninhabited British Antarctic Territory (the land area of all the territories excepting the Antarctic territory is only ), while the two largest territories by population, the Cayman Islands and Bermuda, account for about half of the total BOT population. The Cayman Islands alone comprise 28% of the entire BOT population. At the other end of the scale, three territories have no civilian inhabitants – the Antarctic Territory (currently consisting of five research stations), the British Indian Ocean Territory (whose inhabitants, the Chagossians, were forcibly moved to Mauritius and the United Kingdom between 1968 and 1973), and South Georgia (which actually did have a full-time population of two between 1992 and 2006). Pitcairn Islands, settled by the survivors of the mutiny on the &quot;Bounty&quot;, is the smallest settled territory, with 49 inhabitants (all of whom live on the titular island), while the smallest by land area is Gibraltar, which lies on the southern tip of the Iberian Peninsula. The United Kingdom participates in the Antarctic Treaty System and, as part of a mutual agreement, the British Antarctic Territory is recognised by four of the six other sovereign nations making claims to Antarctic territory.

The 14 British Overseas Territories are:

== History ==


Early colonies, in the sense of English subjects residing in lands hitherto outside the control of the English government, were generally known as &quot;plantations.&quot;

The first, unofficial, colony was Newfoundland Colony, where English fishermen routinely set up seasonal camps in the 16th century. It is now a province of Canada known as Newfoundland and Labrador.

After failed attempts, including the Roanoke Colony, the permanent English colonisation of North America began officially in 1607 with the settlement of Jamestown, the first successful permanent colony in Virginia (a term that was then applied generally to North America). Its offshoot, Bermuda, was settled inadvertently after the wrecking of the Virginia Company&#x27;s flagship there in 1609, with the company&#x27;s charter extended to officially include the archipelago in 1612. St. George&#x27;s town, founded in Bermuda in that year, remains the oldest continuously inhabited British settlement in the New World (with some historians stating that – its formation predating the 1619 conversion of &quot;James Fort&quot; into &quot;Jamestown&quot; – St. George&#x27;s was actually the first successful town the English established in the New World). Bermuda and Bermudians have played important, sometimes pivotal, but generally underestimated or unacknowledged roles in the shaping of the English and British transatlantic empires. These include maritime commerce, settlement of the continent and of the West Indies, and the projection of naval power via the colony&#x27;s privateers, among other areas.

The growth of the British Empire in the 19th century, to its territorial peak in the 1920s, saw Britain acquire nearly one quarter of the world&#x27;s land mass, including territories with large indigenous populations in Asia and Africa. From the middle of the 19th century to the early 20th century, the larger settler colonies – in Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa – first became self-governing colonies and then achieved independence in all matters except foreign policy, defence and trade. Separate self-governing colonies federated to become Canada (in 1867), Australia (in 1901), South Africa (in 1910) and Rhodesia (in 1965). These and other large self-governing colonies had by the 1920s become known as &quot;dominions&quot;. The dominions achieved almost full independence with the Statute of Westminster (1931).

Through a process of decolonisation following the Second World War, most of the British colonies in Africa, Asia and the Caribbean chose independence. Some colonies became Commonwealth realms, retaining the monarch as their own head of state. Most former colonies and protectorates became member states of the Commonwealth of Nations, a non-political, voluntary association of equal members, comprising a population of around 2.2 billion people.

After the independence of Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) in Africa in 1980 and British Honduras (now Belize) in Central America in 1981, the last major colony that remained was Hong Kong, with a population of over 5 million. With 1997 approaching, the United Kingdom and China negotiated the Sino-British Joint Declaration, which led to the whole of Hong Kong becoming a special administrative region of China in 1997, subject to various conditions intended to guarantee the preservation of Hong Kong&#x27;s capitalist economy and its way of life under British rule for at least 50 years after the handover. George Town, Cayman Islands, has consequently become the largest city among the dependent territories, partly because of the constant and healthy flow of immigration to the city and the territory as a whole, which saw its population jump 26% from 2010 to 2021, the fastest population growth of any of the territories.

Prior to 1 January 1983, the territories were officially referred to as the &quot;Crown Colonies&quot;. At that time they were renamed &quot;British Dependent Territories&quot;. In 2002, the British Parliament passed the British Overseas Territories Act 2002 which introduced the current name of &quot;British Overseas Territories&quot;. This reclassified the UK&#x27;s dependent territories as &quot;overseas territories&quot; and, with the exception of those people solely connected with the Sovereign Base Areas on Cyprus, restored full British citizenship to their inhabitants.

During the European Union (EU) membership of the United Kingdom, the main body of EU law did not apply and, although certain slices of EU law were applied to the overseas territories as part of the EU&#x27;s Association of Overseas Countries and Territories (OCT Association), they were not commonly enforceable in local courts. The OCT Association also provided overseas territories with structural funding for regeneration projects. Gibraltar was the only overseas territory that was part of the EU, although it was not part of the European Customs Union, the European Tax Policy, the European Statistics Zone or the Common Agriculture Policy. Gibraltar was not a member of the EU in its own right; it received representation in the European Parliament through its being part of the South West England constituency. Overseas citizens held concurrent European Union citizenship, giving them rights of free movement across all EU member states.

The Sovereign Base Areas in Cyprus were never part of the EU, but they are the only British Overseas Territory to use the Euro as official currency, having previously had the Cypriot pound as their currency until 1 January 2008.

On 15 May 2023, the sixteen heraldic shields of the British Overseas Territories and the three coat of arms of the Crown Dependencies were &quot;immortalised&quot; in two new stained-glass windows, unveiled in the Speaker&#x27;s House at the New Palace of Westminster. Speaker of the House of Commons, Sir Lindsay Hoyle said &quot;The two windows represent part of our United Kingdom family&quot;.

== Government ==

=== Head of state ===
The head of state in the overseas territories is the British monarch, currently King Charles III. The monarch appoints a representative in each territory to exercise the executive power of the monarch. In territories with a permanent population, a governor is appointed by the monarch on the advice of the British government. Currently (2019) all but two governors are either career diplomats or have worked in other civil service departments. The remaining two governors are former members of the British armed forces. In territories without a permanent population, a commissioner is usually appointed to represent the monarch. Exceptionally, in the overseas territories of Saint Helena, Ascension, Tristan da Cunha and the Pitcairn Islands, an administrator is appointed to be the governor&#x27;s representative. In the territory of Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha, there is an administrator in each of the two distant parts of the territory, namely Ascension Island and Tristan da Cunha. The administrator of the Pitcairn Islands resides on Pitcairn, with the governor based in New Zealand.

Following the Lords&#x27; decision in &quot;Ex parte&quot; Quark, 2005, it is held that the King in exercising his authority over British Overseas Territories does not act on the advice of the government of the UK, but in his role as king of each territory, with the exception of fulfilling the UK&#x27;s international responsibilities for its territories. The reserve powers of the Crown for each territory are no longer considered to be exercisable on the advice of the UK government. To comply with the court&#x27;s decision, the territorial governors now act on the advice of each territory&#x27;s executive and the UK government can no longer disallow legislation passed by territorial legislatures.

The role of the governor is to act as the &quot;de facto&quot; head of state, and they are usually responsible for appointing the head of government, and senior political positions in the territory. The governor is also responsible for liaising with the UK government, and carrying out any ceremonial duties. A commissioner has the same powers as a governor, but also acts as the head of government.

===Local government===
Although the British Government is the national government, much of governance within the territories has been delegated to local government, with all of those that have permanent populations having some degree of representative government (which was not the case for British Hong Kong) which have been delegated responsibility for local legislation, irrevocably guaranteed the same rights and representation they would have if born in England, representation in the national Parliament of the United Kingdom has yet to be extended to any overseas territory. The structure of the territorial government appears to be closely correlated to the size and political development of the territory.

===Legal system===
Each overseas territory has its own legal system independent of the United Kingdom. The legal system is generally based on English common law, with some distinctions for local circumstances. Each territory has its own attorney general and court system. For the smaller territories, the United Kingdom may appoint a UK-based lawyer or judge to work on legal cases. This is particularly important for cases involving serious crimes and where it is impossible to find a jury who will not know the defendant in a small population island. Whilst many are geographically remote, the British Overseas Territories share a direct connection with elements of supervisory governance (as did the now independent Commonwealth Nations) still exercisable by the UK’s Government in London, UK.

The 2004 Pitcairn Islands sexual assault trial is an example of how the United Kingdom may choose to provide the legal framework for particular cases where the territory cannot do so alone.

The highest court for all the British overseas territories is the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in London.

===Police and enforcement===
The British overseas territories generally look after their own policing matters and have their own police forces. In smaller territories, the senior officer(s) may be recruited or seconded from a UK police force, and specialist staff and equipment may be sent to assist the local force.

Some territories may have other forces beyond the main territorial police, for instance an airport police, such as Airport Security Police (Bermuda), or a defence police force, such as the Gibraltar Defence Police. In addition, most territories have customs, immigration, border and coastguard agencies.

Territories with military bases or responsibilities may also have &quot;Overseas Service Police&quot;, members of the British or Commonwealth Armed Forces.

===Joint Ministerial Council===

A Joint Ministerial Council of UK ministers, and the leaders of the overseas territories has been held annually since 2012 to provide representation between UK government departments and overseas territory governments.

==Disputed sovereignty==

The British Antarctic Territory overlaps with territory claims by both Argentina and Chile. However, territorial claims on the continent may not currently be advanced, under the holding measures of the Antarctic Treaty System.

Gibraltar was captured from Spain in 1704 by a force led by Admiral Sir George Rooke representing the Grand Alliance on behalf of the Archduke Charles, pretender to the Spanish throne. Spanish attempts to regain the territory failed, and it was eventually ceded to the Kingdom of Great Britain under the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht as part of the settlement of the War of the Spanish Succession.

The British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT) was the subject of a territorial dispute with Mauritius, the government of which claims that the separation of the Chagos Archipelago from the rest of British Mauritius in 1965, three years before Mauritius was granted independence from the United Kingdom, was unlawful. The long-running dispute was referred in 2017 to the International Court of Justice, which issued an advisory opinion on 25 February 2019 which supported the position of the government of Mauritius. On 3 October 2024, British prime minister Keir Starmer and Mauritian prime minister Pravind Jugnauth jointly announced that an agreement had been reached under which the UK would cede sovereignty over the territory. Under the deal, Diego Garcia will be excluded from any resettlement, and the UK will continue to administer the island for at least 99 years.

==United Nations list of non-self-governing territories==
Of the eleven territories with a permanent population, all except the Sovereign Base Areas of Akrotiri and Dhekelia in Cyprus continue to be listed by the UN Special Committee on Decolonization as non-self-governing territories since they were listed as dependent territories by the UK when it joined the UN in 1947. This means that the UK remains the official administrative power of these territories, and under Article 73 is therefore required &quot;to develop self-government, to take due account of the political aspirations of the peoples, and to assist them in the progressive development of their free political institutions.&quot;

== Relations with the United Kingdom ==

Historically the Secretary of State for the Colonies and the Colonial Office were responsible for overseeing all British Colonies, but today the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) has the responsibility of looking after the interests of all overseas territories except the Sovereign Base Areas of Akrotiri and Dhekelia, which comes under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Defence. Within the FCDO, the general responsibility for the territories is handled by the Overseas Territories Directorate.

In 2012, the FCO published &quot;The Overseas Territories: security, success and sustainability&quot; which set out Britain&#x27;s policy for the Overseas Territories, covering six main areas:
* Defence, security and safety of the territories and their people
* Successful and resilient economies
* Cherishing the environment
* Making government work better
* Vibrant and flourishing communities
* Productive links with the wider world

Britain and the Overseas Territories do not have diplomatic representations, although the governments of the overseas territories with indigenous populations all retain a representative office in London. The United Kingdom Overseas Territories Association (UKOTA) also represents the interests of the territories in London. The governments in both London and territories occasionally meet to mitigate or resolve disagreements over the process of governance in the territories and levels of autonomy.

Britain provides financial assistance to the overseas territories via the FCDO (previously the Department for International Development). As of 2019, only Montserrat, Saint Helena, Pitcairn and Tristan da Cunha receive budgetary aid (i.e. financial contribution to recurrent funding). Several specialist funds are made available by the UK, including:
* The Good Government Fund which provides assistance on government administration;
* The Economic Diversification Programme Budget which aim to diversify and enhance the economic bases of the territories.

The territories have no official representation in the UK Parliament, but have informal representation through the all-party parliamentary group, and can petition the UK government through the Directgov e-Petitions website.

Two national parties, UK Independence Party and the Liberal Democrats, have endorsed calls for direct representation of overseas territories in the UK Parliament, as well as backbench members of the Conservative Party and Labour Party.
The Chief Minister has argued that all British citizens in overseas territories should have the right to vote in UK parliamentary elections.

On 29 January 2024, the Chief Minister of Gibraltar, Fabian Picardo, addressed the House of Commons Committee on territorial constitution, looking at the relationship between the UK Parliament and the territories. He said that the UK Government&#x27;s new &quot;Votes for Life&quot; policy mean all Gibraltarians who have previously lived in the UK, for example as students, can now register to vote in its general elections - regardless of how long ago they lived there.
However, Fabian Picardo highlighted that, overall, there is no formal mechanism to ensure Gibraltar&#x27;s interests are represented under the constituency system - just the voluntary interest of individual MPs, such as those in the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Gibraltar.
The Chief Minister acknowledged the difficulty of finding a system to accommodate Westminster representation and OT&#x27;s self-governance - but said that the &quot;Pandora&#x27;s Box&quot; of devolution had opened a window to how this could be addressed.

=== Foreign affairs ===


Foreign affairs of the overseas territories are handled by the FCDO in London. Some territories maintain diplomatic officers in nearby countries for trade and immigration purposes. Several of the territories in the Americas maintain membership within the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States, the Caribbean Community, the Caribbean Development Bank, Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency and the Association of Caribbean States. The territories are members of the Commonwealth of Nations through the United Kingdom. The inhabited territories compete in their own right at the Commonwealth Games, and three of the territories (Bermuda, the Cayman Islands and the British Virgin Islands) sent teams to the 2016 Summer Olympics.

Although the Crown Dependencies of Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man are also under the sovereignty of the British monarch, they are in a different constitutional relationship with the United Kingdom. The British Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies are themselves distinct from the Commonwealth realms, a group of 15 independent countries (including the United Kingdom) sharing Charles III as monarch and head of state, and from the Commonwealth of Nations, a voluntary association of 56 countries mostly with historic links to the British Empire (which also includes all Commonwealth realms). Notably, while not independent Commonwealth realms, the territories are separately represented at the Commonwealth Games on the same basis as independent nation members, as are the three Crown Dependencies of Jersey, Guernsey and Isle of Man.

Full British citizenship has been granted to most &#x27;belongers&#x27; of overseas territories (mainly since the British Overseas Territories Act 2002).

Most countries do not recognise the sovereignty claims of any other country, including Britain&#x27;s, to Antarctica and its off-shore islands. Five nations contest, with counter-claims, the UK&#x27;s sovereignty in the following overseas territories:
* British Antarctic Territory – territory overlaps Antarctic claims made by Chile and Argentina
* British Indian Ocean Territory – claimed by Mauritius
* Falkland Islands – claimed by Argentina
* Gibraltar – claimed by Spain
* South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands – claimed by Argentina

=== Citizenship ===

The people of the British Overseas Territories are British Nationals. Most of the overseas territories distinguish between those British nationals who have rights reserved under the local government for those with a qualifying connection to the territory. In Bermuda, by example, this is called &quot;Bermudian status&quot;, and can be inherited or obtained subject to conditions laid down by the local government (non-British nationals must necessarily obtain British nationality in order to obtain Bermudian status). Although the expression &quot;belonger status&quot; is not used in Bermuda, it is used elsewhere in Wikipedia to refer to all such statuses of various of the British Overseas Territories collectively. This status is neither a nationality nor a citizenship, although it confers rights under local legislation.

Prior to 1968, the British government made no citizenship (or connected rights) distinction between its nationals in the United Kingdom and those in the British colonies (as the British Overseas Territories were then termed). Indeed, the people of Bermuda had been explicitly guaranteed by Royal Charters for the Virginia Company in 1607 (extended to Bermuda in 1612) and the Somers Isles Company (in 1615) that they and their descendants would have exactly the same rights as they would if they had they been born in England. Despite this, British Colonials without a qualifying connection to the United Kingdom were stripped of the rights of abode and free entry in 1968, and, in 1983, the British government replaced Citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies with British Citizenship (with rights of abode and free entry to the United Kingdom) for those with a qualifying connection to the United Kingdom or &quot;British Dependent Territories Citizenship&quot; for those with a connection only to a colony, at the same time re-designated a &quot;British Dependent Territory&quot;. This category of citizenship was distinguished from British Citizenship by what it did not include — the rights of abode and free entry to the United Kingdom — and was not specific to any colony but to all collectively, except for Gibraltar and the Falklands Islands, the people of which retained &quot;British Citizenship&quot;.

It was stated by some Conservative Party backbench MPs that the secret intent of the Conservative government was to restore a single citizenship, with full rights across the United Kingdom and the British Dependent Territories, once Hong Kong and its British Dependent Territories Citizens had been returned to the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1997. By that time, the Labour Party was in government with Tony Blair as Prime Minister. Labour had decried discrimination against the people of the British Dependent Territories (other than those of Gibraltar and the Falklands), which was understood universally as intended to raise a colour bar and had done so given that most white colonials were not affected by it and had made restoration of a single citizenship part of its election manifesto.

In 2002, when the British Dependent Territories became the &quot;British Overseas Territories&quot;, the default citizenship was renamed British Overseas Territories Citizenship (except still for Gibraltar and the Falkland Islands, for which British Citizenship remained the default), the immigration bars against its holders were lowered, and its holders were also entitled to obtain British Citizenship by obtaining a second British Passport (something that had previously been illegal) with the citizenship so indicated. As British Overseas Territories Citizens must provide their British Passport with the citizenship shown as British Overseas Territories Citizen in order to prove their entitlement to obtain a passport with the citizenship shown as &quot;British Citizen&quot;, most now have two passports, although the local governments of the territories do not distinguish an individual&#x27;s local status based on either form of citizenship, and the passport with the citizenship shown as &quot;British Citizen&quot; consequently shows the holder to be entitled to all of the same right as does the passport with the citizenship shown as &quot;British Overseas Territories Citizen&quot;, and is often required to access services in the United Kingdom, and is accepted by the immigration authorities of more foreign countries, many of which have barriers against holders of &quot;British Overseas Territories Citizen&quot; passport holders that do not apply to &quot;British Citizen&quot; passport holders (the exception being the United States in relation to Bermuda, with which it has retained close links since Bermuda was founded as an extension of Virginia).

In regard to movement within British sovereign territory, only British citizenship grants the right of abode in a specific country or territory, namely, the United Kingdom proper (which includes its three Crown Dependencies). Individual overseas territories have legislative independence over immigration, and consequently, BOTC status, as noted above, does not automatically grant the right of abode in any of the territories, as it depends on the territory&#x27;s immigration laws. A territory may issue belonger status to allow a person to reside in the territory that they have close links with. The governor or immigration department of a territory may also grant the territorial status to a resident who does not hold it as a birthright.

From 1949 to 1983, the nationality status of Citizenship of UK and Colonies (CUKC) was shared by residents of the UK proper and residents of overseas territories, although most residents of overseas territories lost their automatic right to live in the UK after the ratification of Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1968 that year unless they were born in the UK proper or had a parent or a grandparent born in the UK. In 1983, CUKC status of residents of overseas territories without the right of abode in the UK was replaced by British Dependent Territories citizenship (BDTC) in the newly minted British Nationality Act 1981, a status that does not come with it the right of abode in the UK or any overseas territory. For these residents, registration as full British citizens then required physical residence in the UK proper. There were only two exceptions: Falkland Islanders, who were automatically granted British citizenship, and with the Falkland Islands treated as a part of the UK proper through the enactment of British Nationality (Falkland Islands) Act 1983 due to the Falklands War with Argentina; and Gibraltarians, who were given the special entitlement to be registered as British citizens upon request without further conditions because of its individual membership in the European Economic Area and the European Economic Community.

Five years after the handover of Hong Kong to China in 1997, the British government amended the 1981 Act to give British citizenship without restrictions to all BDTCs (the status was also renamed BOTC at the same time) except for those solely connected with Akrotiri and Dhekelia (whose residents already held Cypriot citizenship). This restored the right of abode in the UK to residents of overseas territories after a 34-year hiatus from 1968 to 2002.

=== Military ===

Defence of the overseas territories is the responsibility of the United Kingdom. Many of the overseas territories are used as military bases by the United Kingdom- and its allies:

* Ascension Island (part of Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha) – the base known as RAF Ascension Island is used by both the Royal Air Force and the United States Air Force.
* Bermuda – became the primary Royal Navy base in North America, following US independence, and designated an Imperial fortress. The naval establishment included an admiralty, a dockyard, and a naval squadron. A considerable military garrison was built up to protect it, and Bermuda, which the British government came to see as a base, rather than as a colony, was known as &quot;Fortress Bermuda&quot;, and the &quot;Gibraltar of the West&quot; (Bermudians, like Gibraltarians, also dub their territory &quot;The Rock&quot;). Canada and the United States also established bases in Bermuda during the Second World War, which were maintained through the Cold War. Four air bases were located in Bermuda during the Second World War (operated by the Royal Air Force, Royal Navy, United States Navy and United States Army / United States Army Air Forces). Since 1995, the naval and military force in Bermuda has been reduced to the local territorial battalion, the Royal Bermuda Regiment.
* British Indian Ocean Territory – the island of Diego Garcia is home to a large naval base and airbase leased to the United States by the United Kingdom until 2036 (unless renewed). There are British forces in small numbers in the BIOT for administrative and immigration purposes.
* Falkland Islands – the British Forces Falkland Islands includes commitments from the British Army, Royal Air Force and Royal Navy, along with the Falkland Islands Defence Force.
* Gibraltar – Historically designated (along with Bermuda, Malta, and Halifax, Nova Scotia) as an Imperial fortress. British Forces Gibraltar included a Royal Navy Dockyard, HM Dockyard, Gibraltar, now Gibdock (also used by the Royal Navy), RAF Gibraltar – used by the RAF and NATO and a local infantry garrison – the Royal Gibraltar Regiment, which is part of the British Army. Spain, even though a member of NATO itself, has banned all visits to Gibraltar by non-UK craft. Even RAF UK fighter aircraft are banned and only transport planes permitted.
* The Sovereign Base Areas of Akrotiri and Dhekelia in Cyprus – maintained as strategic British military bases in the eastern Mediterranean Sea.
* Montserrat – the Royal Montserrat Defence Force, historically connected with the Irish Guards, is a body of twenty volunteers, whose duties are primarily ceremonial.
*Cayman Islands – The Cayman Islands Regiment is the home defence unit of the Cayman Islands. It is a single territorial infantry battalion of the British Armed Forces that was formed in 2020.
*Turks and Caicos – The Turks and Caicos Islands Regiment is the home defence unit of the British Overseas Territory of the Turks and Caicos Islands. It is a single territorial infantry battalion of the British Armed Forces that was formed in 2020, similar to the Cayman Regiment.

== City status and cities ==

As overseas territories came under the administration of the British Empire, a number of towns and villages began to request formal recognition to validate their importance, and would be accorded a status if deemed to be deserving such as a borough or as a more prestigious city by the monarch. Many cities were designated over several centuries, and as Anglican dioceses began to be created internationally from the 18th century, the process of city creation became aligned to that used in England, being linked to the presence of a cathedral. Later on, this process became untenable and other selection criteria and royal occasions were used instead. However, mainly from the 20th century onwards, increasing levels of states becoming fully independent caused the numbers of remaining cities to reduce substantially.

Since the second Millennium, competitions have been arranged by the UK government to grant city status to settlements. In 2021, submissions for city status were invited to mark the Platinum Jubilee of Elizabeth II, with Crown Dependencies and British Overseas Territories being allowed to take part for the first time. In the Overseas Territories, the applicants were George Town (in the Cayman Islands), Gibraltar and Stanley (in the Falkland Islands). It was later discovered that Gibraltar had been previously named a city, researchers at The National Archives confirming that Gibraltar&#x27;s city status was still in effect, with the territory missing from the official list of cities for the past 140 years. Stanley was later granted the honour, and alongside Hamilton, Bermuda, and Jamestown, St Helena, making a present total of four cities.

== Languages ==

Most of the languages other than English spoken in the territories contain a large degree of English, either as a root language, or in code-switching, e.g. Yanito. They include:

*Yanito (English and Spanish) or Spanish, Arabic, Hebrew, Hindi (Gibraltar)
*Cayman Islands English or Cayman Creole (Cayman Islands)
*Turks and Caicos Creole (Turks and Caicos Islands)
*Pitkern (Pitcairn Islands)
*Greek (Akrotiri and Dhekelia)

Forms of English:
*Bermudian English (Bermuda)
*Falkland Islands English

== Currencies ==
The 14 British overseas territories use a varied assortment of currencies, including the Euro, British pound, United States dollar, New Zealand dollar, or their own currencies, which may be pegged to one of these.

== Symbols and insignia ==

Each overseas territory has been granted its own flag and coat of arms by the British monarch. Traditionally, the flags follow the Blue Ensign design, with the Union Flag in the canton, and the territory&#x27;s coat of arms in the fly. Exceptions to this are Bermuda which uses a Red Ensign; British Antarctic Territory which uses a White Ensign, but without the overall cross of St. George; British Indian Ocean Territory which uses a Blue Ensign with wavy lines to symbolise the sea; and Gibraltar which uses a banner of its coat of arms (the flag of the city of Gibraltar).

Akrotiri and Dhekelia and Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha are the only British Overseas Territories without their own flag, although Saint Helena, Ascension Island and Tristan da Cunha have their own individual flags. Only the Union Flag, which is the national flag in all the territories, is used in these territories.

== Sports ==
Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands and the Cayman Islands are the only British Overseas Territories with recognised National Olympic Committees (NOCs); the British Olympic Association is recognised as the appropriate NOC for athletes from the other territories, and thus athletes who hold a British passport are eligible to represent Great Britain at the Olympic Games.

Shara Proctor from Anguilla, Delano Williams from the Turks and Caicos Islands, Jenaya Wade-Fray from Bermuda and Georgina Cassar from Gibraltar strove to represent Team GB at the London 2012 Olympics. Proctor, Wade-Fray and Cassar qualified for Team GB, with Williams missing the cut, however wishing to represent the UK in 2016.

The Gibraltar national football team was accepted into UEFA in 2013 in time for the 2016 European Championships. It has been accepted by FIFA and went into the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifying, where they achieved 0 points.

Gibraltar has hosted and competed in the Island Games, most recently in 2023.

== Biodiversity ==

The British Overseas Territories have more biodiversity than the entire UK mainland. There are at least 180 endemic plant species in the overseas territories as opposed to only 12 on the UK mainland. Responsibility for protection of biodiversity and meeting obligations under international environmental conventions is shared between the UK Government and the local governments of the territories.

Two areas, Henderson Island in the Pitcairn Islands as well as the islands of Gough and Inaccessible of Tristan da Cunha are listed as UNESCO World Heritage Sites, and two other territories, the Turks and Caicos Islands and Saint Helena, are on the United Kingdom&#x27;s tentative list for future UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Gibraltar&#x27;s Gorham&#x27;s Cave Complex is also found on the UK&#x27;s tentative UNESCO World Heritage Site list.

The three regions of biodiversity hotspots situated in the British Overseas Territories are the Caribbean Islands, the Mediterranean Basin and the Oceania ecozone in the Pacific.

The UK created the largest continuous marine protected areas in the world, the Chagos Marine Protected Area, and announced in 2015 funding to establish a new, larger, reserve around the Pitcairn Islands.

In January 2016, the UK government announced the intention to create a marine protected area around Ascension Island. The protected area would be , half of which would be closed to fishing.

<text>This article contains information about the literary events and publications of 1834.

==Events==
*April – W. Harrison Ainsworth&#x27;s first novel, the historical romance &quot;Rookwood&quot;, is published anonymously in London by Richard Bentley, with illustrations by George Cruikshank. Romanticising the highwayman Dick Turpin, it succeeds enough for the author to take up full-time writing. Bentley also publishes Edward Bulwer-Lytton&#x27;s anonymous popular novel &quot;The Last Days of Pompeii&quot; in the same year.
*June 10 – The Scottish philosopher and writer Thomas Carlyle moves to Cheyne Row (Carlyle&#x27;s House) in London.
*August – Charles Dickens first uses the pen name Boz, in the second installment of &quot;The Boarding-House&quot;, one of the &quot;Sketches by Boz&quot;, originally published in the &quot;Monthly Magazine&quot; (London).
*November 24 – George Sand begins her journal addressed to Alfred de Musset.
*&quot;unknown date&quot; – Carl Jonas Love Almqvist&#x27;s fourth novel in the &quot;Törnrosens bok&quot; series, &quot;The Queen&#x27;s Tiara (Drottningens juvelsmycke)&quot; is published anonymously. Set around the assassination of King Gustav III of Sweden in 1792, it is the first original historical novel written in Sweden, and features a bisexual character, Tintomara.

<doc id="207120" wikidata="Q2471533" url="?curid=207120" title="Laertes (Hamlet)">
<text>Laertes is a character in William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Hamlet&quot;. Laertes is Polonius&#x27; son and Ophelia&#x27;s brother. In the final scene, he mortally stabs Hamlet with a poison-tipped sword to avenge the deaths of his father and sister, for which he blamed Hamlet. While dying of the same poison, he implicates King Claudius.

The Laertes character is thought to be originated by Shakespeare, as there is no equivalent character in any of the known sources for the play. His name is taken from Laërtes, father of Odysseus in Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;.

==Role in the play==
In the first act, Laertes warns Ophelia against Hamlet&#x27;s romantic attentions, saying that Hamlet will soon lose his desire for her, and that it is not Hamlet&#x27;s own choice but the king&#x27;s as to whom he will marry. Before Laertes returns to France from Denmark, (having returned to Denmark only to attend the coronation of King Claudius), his father, Polonius, gives him advice to behave himself in France.

During Laertes&#x27;s absence, Hamlet kills Polonius in Gertrude&#x27;s parlour (act 3). Laertes, informed of his father&#x27;s death, returns to Denmark, and leads a mob to storm and take the castle (act 4). Laertes confronts the King, believing him responsible for Polonius&#x27;s death. The King explains to him who the real killer was, and incites Laertes to kill Hamlet and avenge Polonius&#x27;s death.

When Ophelia appears in her mad condition, Laertes laments, saying that if she had her wits she could not persuade him more to revenge. Later, Laertes is informed of her death. She had climbed into a willow tree that hung over a brook, and then fell into the water when a branch broke. Too insane to save herself, she drowned. His sister&#x27;s death strengthens Laertes&#x27;s resolve to kill Hamlet. In act 5, at Ophelia&#x27;s funeral, Laertes asks why the normal Christian burial ceremony is not being carried out for his sister, and rebukes the priest for questioning her innocence. He leaps into her grave and begs the attendants to bury him with her. Hamlet, who was previously watching from afar, advances and himself leaps into Ophelia&#x27;s grave. When Laertes attacks Hamlet, the two have to be held back – at the king&#x27;s command – to avoid a fight.

In the next scene (act 5, scene 2), King Claudius arranges a fencing match between Hamlet and Laertes. Laertes uses his sharp, poisoned sword instead of a bated (dull) sword. The King provides a poisoned drink as a backup measure. Before the match begins, Hamlet apologises publicly to Laertes for the wrongs he has dealt him. Laertes accepts the apology, so he says, but he proceeds with the scheme to kill Hamlet (though after Gertrude drinks the poisoned drink, he expresses having an attack of conscience). Hamlet is eventually wounded with the poisoned sword. Then, in a scuffle, the swords are switched. Hamlet wounds Laertes with his own poisoned blade, and Laertes then falls as well. Only then does he truly seem to feel guilty, for he tells Osric he has been &quot;justly killed&quot; with his own treachery. As he lies dying, Laertes confesses the truth and reveals that it was Claudius&#x27;s plot; this results in Hamlet killing Claudius. Laertes asks Hamlet for forgiveness, absolving him of his and his father&#x27;s deaths if Hamlet absolves him of his own. Hamlet does so, dying shortly after Laertes does.

Other characters&#x27; views of Laertes vary widely. Polonius feels a need to send a servant to France to spy on his son&#x27;s behaviour. Ophelia tells him not to be a hypocrite (in telling her to behave herself with Hamlet, but then being immoral himself in France). Hamlet is at first puzzled by Laertes&#x27;s hatred for him, but later admits that he sees his own cause displayed in Laertes&#x27;s actions.

==Portrayal==
Laertes is often portrayed by seemingly humble actors to give a loyal, wholesome appeal to the character. He has been played by Terence Morgan (1948), John Cullum (1964), Nicholas Jones (1970), Nathaniel Parker (1990), Hugh Bonneville (1992), Michael Maloney (1996), Liev Schreiber (2000), Edward Bennett (2009), Kobna Holdbrook-Smith (2015), Luke Thompson (2017) and Tom Felton (2018).

<text>The Nashville Sounds are a Minor League Baseball team of the International League and the Triple-A affiliate of the Milwaukee Brewers. They are located in Nashville, Tennessee, and are named for the city&#x27;s association with the music industry, specifically the &quot;Nashville sound&quot;, a subgenre of country music which originated in the city in the mid-1950s. The team plays their home games at First Horizon Park, which opened in 2015 on the site of the historic Sulphur Dell ballpark. The Sounds previously played at Herschel Greer Stadium from its opening in 1978 until the end of the 2014 season. They are the oldest active professional sports franchise in Nashville.

Established as an expansion team of the Double-A Southern League in 1978, the Sounds led all of Minor League Baseball in attendance in their inaugural season and continued to draw the Southern League&#x27;s largest crowds in each of their seven years as members. On the field, the team won six consecutive second-half division titles from 1979 to 1984 and won the Southern League championship twice: in 1979 as the Double-A affiliate of the Cincinnati Reds and again in 1982 as the Double-A affiliate of the New York Yankees.

The Sounds were replaced by a Triple-A American Association team in 1985. The Triple-A Sounds carried on the history of the Double-A team that preceded them. Nashville rarely contended for the American Association championship, making only three appearances in the postseason during their 13 years in the league. They joined the Triple-A Pacific Coast League in 1998 following the dissolution of the American Association after the 1997 season. Over 23 years in the Pacific Coast League, the team qualified for the postseason on five occasions. They won their lone Pacific Coast League championship in 2005 as the Triple-A affiliate of the Milwaukee Brewers. In conjunction with Major League Baseball&#x27;s reorganization of Minor League Baseball in 2021, the Sounds were placed in the Triple-A East, which became the International League in 2022.

Nashville has served as a farm club for eight Major League Baseball franchises. A total of 29 managers have led the club and its more than 1,500 players. As of the completion of the 2024 season, their 47th year in Nashville, the Sounds have played 6,566 regular-season games and compiled a win–loss record of (). They have a postseason record of in 93 games. Combining all 6,659 regular-season and postseason games, the Sounds have an all-time record of 3,447–3,212–2 ().

== History ==
=== Prior professional baseball in Nashville ===
Nashville has been home to Minor League Baseball teams since the late 19th century. The city&#x27;s professional baseball history dates back to 1884 with the formation of the Nashville Americans, who were charter members of the original Southern League from 1885 to 1886 and played their home games at Sulphur Spring Park, later renamed Athletic Park and Sulphur Dell. This ballpark was the home of Nashville&#x27;s minor league teams through 1963. In 1887, Nashville&#x27;s Southern League team was called the Nashville Blues. The Nashville Tigers competed in the same league from 1893 to 1894. In 1895, the Nashville Seraphs won the city&#x27;s first professional championship in the Southern League. The Nashville Centennials played in the Central League in 1897 but relocated to Henderson, Kentucky, during the season before the league&#x27;s collapse.

The city&#x27;s longest-operating baseball team, first known only as the Nashville Baseball Club and later renamed the Nashville Vols (short for Volunteers, the state nickname), was formed in 1901 as a charter member of the Southern Association. They remained in the league through 1961, winning eight pennants, nine playoff championships, and four Dixie Series titles. The Southern Association disbanded after the 1961 season, and no team was fielded in 1962, but the Vols played one final campaign in the South Atlantic League in 1963. Sulphur Dell was demolished in 1969, and the city had no professional baseball team for 14 years until 1978.

=== Getting a team and building a ballpark ===
Larry Schmittou, head coach of the Vanderbilt Commodores baseball team from 1968 to 1978, was instrumental in bringing professional baseball back to Nashville. Along with help from country musician Conway Twitty, Schmittou put together a group of investors including other country artists Cal Smith and Jerry Reed, as well as other Nashvillians, to finance a stadium and a minor league team. The Metro Parks Board agreed to lease to Schmittou the site of Nashville&#x27;s former softball fields on the grounds of Fort Negley, a Civil War fortification approximately south of downtown, on which to build. The US$1.5 million ballpark was to be named Herschel Greer Stadium in posthumous honor of Herschel Lynn Greer, a prominent Nashville businessman and president of the Nashville Vols. Schmittou and general manager Farrell Owens landed the Cincinnati Reds as a Major League Baseball affiliate after meeting with Sheldon &quot;Chief&quot; Bender, Cincinnati&#x27;s farm director, at the 1976 Winter Meetings. The new team was then granted membership in the Southern League, which operated at the Double-A classification.

The team was called the Sounds in reference to the &quot;Nashville sound&quot;, a subgenre of American country music that traces its roots to the area in the late 1950s. The team&#x27;s wordmark and color scheme were lifted from the defunct Memphis Sounds of the American Basketball Association, who used them from 1974 to 1975. The color blue was added to Memphis&#x27; red and white palette. Nashville&#x27;s original logo, which was used from 1978 into 1998, reflected the city&#x27;s long-standing association with country music. It depicted a mustachioed baseball player, nicknamed &quot;Slugger&quot;, swinging at a baseball with an acoustic guitar, a staple of country music, in place of a bat. Further illustrating the city&#x27;s musical ties was the typeface, with letters that resembled G-clefs, used to display the team name and the cap logo which resembled an eighth note.

=== Southern League ===
==== Cincinnati Reds (1978–1979) ====

With a team in place and a stadium under construction, the Nashville Sounds were set to begin play in 1978 as an expansion team of the Southern League. As the Double-A affiliate of the Cincinnati Reds, the Sounds played their first game on April 15, 1978, against the Memphis Chicks at Memphis&#x27; Tim McCarver Stadium, which they lost, 4–2. They recorded their first win the next evening, defeating Memphis, 3–0. Their home opener was scheduled to take place on April 25, but was rained out and rescheduled for the next night. On April 26, the Sounds played their first home game, a 12–4 victory, against the Savannah Braves before a sellout crowd of 8,156 fans at Greer Stadium. Nashville placed fourth of five teams in both halves of its inaugural season, which kept the team out of the championship playoffs.

The Sounds had more success at the turnstiles than on the field as they led all of Minor League Baseball in attendance by drawing 380,000 fans to Greer Stadium in their debut season. Nashville went on to lead the Southern League in attendance in each of their seven seasons of membership. Schmittou&#x27;s business philosophy revolved around earning profits not from ticket sales, but from the sale of souvenirs and concessions. This approach also involved promoting family-friendly entertainment rather than baseball games. Through the mid 1980s, the Sounds offered nightly promotions and treated fans to a carnival-like atmosphere between innings. The franchise was recognized with the Larry MacPhail Award for outstanding minor league promotions in 1978, 1980, and 1981.

Manager George Scherger led the 1979 Sounds to win the second-half Western Division title, qualifying them for the postseason. After defeating first-half winners Memphis, three games to one, for the Western Division title, they advanced to the league championship series against the Columbus Astros. Nashville won their first Southern League championship by defeating Columbus, three games to one.

Originally, the Reds allowed Nashville to use a designated hitter (DH) in their lineup. This allowance was later revoked since the Reds were a part of the National League in which pitchers bat instead of using a DH. Schmittou felt the Sounds were at a disadvantage against other teams that utilized the designated hitter, so he looked for a new major league affiliate for 1980. After two seasons at Double-A for the Reds, Nashville had a 152–140 win–loss record encompassing all regular-season and postseason games.

==== New York Yankees (1980–1984) ====
Schmittou had been encouraged by the New York Yankees organization to establish the Sounds as a Triple-A team, but he refused to go back on his previous agreement to partner with the Reds at Double-A. After the split with Cincinnati, the Sounds made their first affiliation switch in 1980, becoming the Double-A affiliate of the Yankees. This partnership was the most successful period in team history. They experienced five consecutive winning seasons and won five consecutive second-half Western Division titles, propelling them to the postseason each year.

Under manager Stump Merrill, the 1980 Sounds posted a franchise-best 97–46 record. They won the second half but lost the Western Division series to Memphis. The 1980 club was ranked as the sixty-ninth greatest minor league baseball team of all-time by baseball historians in 2001. Nashville set the league season attendance record that year when 575,676 fans attended games at Greer Stadium. The Sounds reached the 1981 championship series via another second-half title and winning the division over Memphis, but they fell to the Orlando Twins in the finals.

The 1982 Sounds, managed by Johnny Oates, finished with a 77–67 record and won the second half. After defeating the Knoxville Blue Jays, 3–1, in the Western Division finals, the Sounds advanced to the league championship series against the Jacksonville Suns, where they won the franchise&#x27;s second Southern League championship with a 3–1 series victory. The Sounds qualified for the Western Division series in each of the next two seasons, but fell to the Birmingham Barons in 1983, and to Knoxville in 1984. One highlight of the 1984 season was Jim Deshaies pitching the club&#x27;s first no-hitter against Columbus in the second game of a seven-inning doubleheader on May 4. Otis Nixon set the franchise career record for stolen bases (133) over the 1981 and 1982 seasons. Nashville had a 431–320 record during their five-year affiliation with the Yankees, their best record among all affiliations. Their seven-year record in the Southern League was 583–460.

=== American Association ===
==== Detroit Tigers (1985–1986) ====
In response to a decline in attendance and a decrease in local media coverage, Sounds president Larry Schmittou sought to boost interest in the team through an elevation to the Triple-A classification. He attempted to purchase and relocate one of two available Triple-A franchises late in the 1983 season, but each chose to continue in their markets for 1984. His desire to land a Triple-A team was part of a larger plan to put Nashville in a position to contend for a Major League Baseball franchise in the future.

Schmittou arrived at terms in July 1984 to purchase the Triple-A Evansville Triplets of the American Association for a reported sum of $780,000, with plans to move the franchise from Evansville, Indiana, to Nashville for the 1985 season. The Southern League wanted Schmittou to surrender his franchise to the league, but he had plans to relocate the team to Evansville to continue as the Triplets at Double-A. However, a combination of the league&#x27;s disapproval of the move and the City of Evansville being unwilling to upgrade Bosse Field resulted in a move to Huntsville, Alabama, where the team became the Huntsville Stars. The Triple-A Sounds carried on the history of the Double-A team that preceded them. The Triplets&#x27; legacy was retired, and the Stars were established as an entirely new franchise.

The Sounds began Triple-A competition in 1985 as a member of the American Association affiliated with the Detroit Tigers, continuing the major league affiliation that was in place with the Evansville franchise. Their first Triple-A game was a 3–1 win against the Buffalo Bisons at Greer Stadium on April 11. Though narrowly missing the playoffs in their first season with the Tigers, the Sounds ended their affiliation with Detroit after two years of poor attendance and a lackluster 1986 season. Over two years with the Tigers, they had a 139–144–2 record. Their all-time record stood at 722–604–2 after nine years of play.

==== Cincinnati Reds (1987–1992) ====
The Sounds rejoined the Cincinnati Reds farm system as their Triple-A affiliate in 1987 in a bid to increase attendance. Schmittou indicated that market surveys consistently showed the Reds to be the most popular MLB team in the area. In 1990, Nashville set its all-time attendance record when 605,122 fans attended games at Greer Stadium. The Sounds experienced their most successful season with the Reds at Triple-A and as members of the American Association that year when they compiled an 86–61 record under manager Pete Mackanin. Ending the regular-season in a tie with the Buffalo Bisons, the Sounds won the Eastern Division title in a one-game playoff. They advanced to their first American Association championship series, but they ultimately lost to the Omaha Royals.

Apart from the 1990 season, the Sounds finished too far back to qualify for the postseason in the other five years of affiliation with the Reds. However, several franchise records were set during this period. Skeeter Barnes, who had previously played with Nashville in 1979, set the career records for games played (514), at bats (1,848), and hits (517) during his second stint from 1988 to 1990. Pitcher Hugh Kemp started a record 73 games from 1987 to 1989. Greer Stadium, once one of the best stadiums in Triple-A baseball in terms of player and fan amenities, began to be outshined by newer ballparks being built in the late 1980s. The Reds let their player development contract with the Sounds expire so they could place their Triple-A affiliate in Indianapolis, which was closer and planning to build a new stadium. Nashville&#x27;s record after six years with Cincinnati at Triple-A was 431–436. Through 15 total years of competition, their all-time record stood at 1,207–1,040–2.

==== Chicago White Sox (1993–1997) ====

At the recommendation of the Office of the Commissioner of Baseball and with few options available, the Sounds signed a new player development contract with the Chicago White Sox, who wanted to move their Triple-A farm club closer than its previous location in Vancouver. The White Sox then presented a list of complaints about the relatively poor condition of Greer Stadium. Unable to convince the city to pay for a new ballpark, and deciding against moving the team elsewhere in the Nashville area, Schmittou made significant improvements to Greer. One of those was the addition of its signature guitar-shaped scoreboard, which was installed before the 1993 season. At one point, Schmittou considered dropping the Sounds back to Double-A due to the difficulty of bringing Greer up to the specifications of a Triple-A ballpark. Instead, renovations continued over the next several years in an attempt to meet Triple-A standards.

Greer Stadium was shared between the Sounds and the Southern League&#x27;s Nashville Xpress, previously known as the Charlotte Knights, during the 1993 and 1994 seasons. This came about when Charlotte acquired a Triple-A expansion franchise in 1993, leaving the existing Double-A team without a home. Schmittou offered Greer as a temporary home ballpark for the team. To accommodate an additional club, the Xpress&#x27; home games were scheduled for during the Sounds&#x27; road trips.

The Sounds reached the American Association playoffs in each of their first two years with the White Sox. The 1993 team, led by manager Rick Renick, clinched the Eastern Division title but lost the championship series to the Iowa Cubs. The 1994 Sounds qualified for their second consecutive postseason under Renick. In the first round, Nashville swept the New Orleans Zephyrs in three games to advance to the league finals, but they were defeated by the Indianapolis Indians. The team failed to reach the postseason again during their remaining three years with Chicago. The five-year White Sox affiliation ended after the 1997 season with the Sounds having a 390–342 record with four winning seasons over that period. After 13 years, their American Association record stood at 960–922–2, and their all-time 20-year record was 1,543–1,382–2.

The 1996 season marked the last that Schmittou was the team&#x27;s president and part majority owner. The city was poised to welcome a National Football League franchise, the Tennessee Titans, and Schmittou felt that revenue would be drawn away from the team. He and another investor sold their controlling financial interests in the Sounds to Chicago-based businessmen Al Gordon, Mike Murtaugh, and Mike Woleben.

=== Pacific Coast League ===
==== Pittsburgh Pirates (1998–2004) ====
The American Association, of which the Sounds had been members since 1985, disbanded after the 1997 season, and its teams were absorbed by the two remaining Triple-A leagues—the International League and Pacific Coast League (PCL). Nashville joined the PCL, becoming the easternmost team in the circuit. Along with a new league, they began to adopt new colors and logos over the course of the 1998 and 1999 seasons, phasing out the original colors and marks in use since their foundation in 1978. The new primary logo, replacing the original &quot;Slugger&quot;, consisted of a black, red, and white eighth note with a baseball at the top set against a circle of the same colors, plus silver, bearing the team name in white around the sides.

The Sounds entered the Pacific Coast League as the top farm club of the Pittsburgh Pirates, who sought to escape the chilly climate and lengthy travel associated with their previous affiliate in Calgary. The team regularly finished third or fourth in their four-team division, leaving them out of the playoffs. One of their three winning seasons occurred in 2003 when Trent Jewett managed the Sounds to clinch the American Conference Eastern Division title, giving them their first postseason berth in the PCL and first playoff appearance since 1994. Nashville defeated the Albuquerque Isotopes in the conference series but then lost the league finals to the Sacramento River Cats. Earlier in 2003, right-hander John Wasdin pitched the first perfect game in Sounds history on April 7 against Albuquerque at Greer Stadium. The 4–0 Sounds win was the second nine-inning perfect game in the PCL&#x27;s 101-year history.

Several franchise records were set during the affiliation with Pittsburgh. Chad Hermansen, a Sound from 1998 to 2002, holds the career records for runs (303), home runs (92), and runs batted in (286). Tike Redman hit a record 32 triples from 2000 to 2003. Closing pitcher Mark Corey set the record for saves (46) during the 2003 and 2004 seasons. Seeking to place their Triple-A club at a newer, more desirable stadium and to escape the high travel costs associated with playing in the PCL, Pittsburgh ended their affiliation with the Sounds after the 2004 campaign. Over seven years as a Pirates affiliate, Nashville had a 493–508 record. Through 27 years of competition, the Sounds&#x27; all-time record stood at 2,036–1,890–2.

==== Milwaukee Brewers (2005–2014) ====
The Sounds became the Triple-A affiliate of the Milwaukee Brewers in 2005. One factor in the Brewers&#x27; choice to partner with Nashville was the hope that the Sounds would soon get a new stadium to replace the then-27-year-old Greer. The team also debuted a new oval-shaped logo with a baseball player silhouetted against a yellow background hitting a ball toward the Nashville skyline with the city&#x27;s name written above within a red border and the team nickname written in red and black script below. The affiliation started well as manager Frank Kremblas led the club to win the American Conference Northern Division title with a 75–69 record. The team went on to win the conference title against the Oklahoma RedHawks, three games to two, before sweeping the Tacoma Rainiers in three games to win the Pacific Coast League championship. This was Nashville&#x27;s first championship at the Triple-A level since moving to the classification in 1985 and their first since the 1982 Southern League crown.

From May 5–6, 2006, the Sounds participated in a 24-inning game against the New Orleans Zephyrs, which was played over the course of two days and lasted eight hours and seven minutes. This matched the PCL record for the longest game, in terms of innings played. The Sounds finished the season tied with the Iowa Cubs for first place, but won the division title and advanced to the postseason via tiebreaker by means of having won the regular-season series versus Iowa. Nashville lost to the Round Rock Express in the conference series.

On June 25, 2007, Manny Parra pitched the club&#x27;s second perfect game, the third nine-inning perfect game in the PCL&#x27;s history, against Round Rock. Kremblas led the team to capture the division title for the third consecutive year and finish the season with a league-best 89–55 record. Ultimately, they were defeated by New Orleans in the conference series. The Sounds failed to win the division and qualify for the postseason during the next seven years of their Brewers affiliation despite narrow second-place finishes in 2009 and 2014. The 2013 team set the franchise record low win–loss record with a 57–87 campaign.

The Sounds had planned to leave Greer Stadium in the mid 2000s for a new ballpark to be called First Tennessee Field, but the project was abandoned when a financing agreement could not be reached. After the 2008 season and failing to secure a new facility, Al Gordon&#x27;s Amerisports Companies sold the team to MFP Baseball, a New York-based group of investors consisting of Masahiro Honzawa, Steve Posner, and Frank Ward. Keeping the team in Nashville was one of the PCL&#x27;s top criteria for approval of the sale. MFP made significant renovations to Greer while it continued to explore building a new stadium.

Prior to the 2014 season, the team, Metro Nashville, and the State of Tennessee finalized a plan to build a new downtown ballpark in time for the 2015 season. On August 27, 2014, the Sounds played their final game at Greer Stadium, an 8–5 loss to the Sacramento River Cats. The attendance at the game was a standing-room-only crowd of 11,067, the first sellout since 2010, and the largest crowd since 2007.

The Sounds severed ties with Milwaukee after the 2014 season citing poor on-field performance from recent Brewers Triple-A teams. Over the 10-year affiliation, the longest in Nashville&#x27;s history, the Sounds had a 732–721 record. Overall, the Sounds&#x27; 37-year record stood at 2,768–2,611–2.&#x27;

==== Oakland Athletics (2015–2018) ====
Nashville affiliated with the Oakland Athletics in 2015 due in part to the organization&#x27;s commitment to fielding competitive teams at the Triple-A level, an area in which co-owner Frank Ward felt Milwaukee lacked. The Sounds also introduced a new set of logos that incorporated elements reflecting Nashville&#x27;s &quot;Music City&quot; moniker, such as guitars, picks, and sound holes, as well as neon signs like those in the city&#x27;s Broadway entertainment district. The team initially elected to embrace a new color scheme that included Broadway Burnt Orange, Sunburst Tan, Neon Orange, and Cash Black. However, the team returned to the previous red and black palette, with the addition of platinum silver as an accent color, before the season began after receiving mixed feedback from team fans. The new primary logo was a red &quot;N&quot; set against a silver guitar pick, both with black borders.

The start of the 2015 season marked the first time that the Sounds played at the new $91 million First Horizon Park, then known as First Tennessee Park, which is located at the site of the historic Sulphur Dell ballpark just north of the Tennessee State Capitol in downtown Nashville. In the facility&#x27;s inaugural game on April 17, the Sounds defeated the Colorado Springs Sky Sox, 3–2 in 10 innings, with a walk-off RBI double in front of an announced paid attendance of 10,459 people.

In Nashville&#x27;s second season as an A&#x27;s affiliate, they reached the postseason for the first time since 2007 with a league-best 83–59 record and the American Conference Southern Division title, but they were unable to advance past the conference series versus the Oklahoma City Dodgers. Joey Wendle hit a franchise career-record 102 doubles from 2015 to 2017. Nashville declined to renew their contract with the Athletics after the 2018 season, choosing instead to seek a new major league affiliate. Over four years with Oakland, they had a 291–279 record. Through 41 seasons, their all-time record stood at 3,059–2,890–2.

==== Texas Rangers (2019–2020) ====
Nashville became the Triple-A affiliate of the Texas Rangers in 2019. The Sounds sought out the Rangers after identifying them as one of the most popular MLB teams among local baseball fans—behind the Atlanta Braves and St. Louis Cardinals—and for their geographical proximity. Also in 2019, just four years after their previous rebranding, the team debuted new colors and logos which pull together elements from their original visual identity and the musical imagery present throughout their franchise history. The new colors, navy blue, red, and white, are modernized versions of their original 1978 colors. The primary logo is a pair of concentric red rings with the team name in navy between the two divided horizontally at its center by twin red and blue stripes; a navy &quot;N&quot; resembling the F-hole of a guitar or violin is in the inner ring, which is styled like a baseball.

Veteran sidearm pitcher Tim Dillard, previously with the Sounds from 2007 to 2014, returned to the team in 2019. In his second stretch, he set the franchise career records for games pitched (242) and strikeouts (437) while adding to his existing marks for wins (48) and innings pitched (710). The 2019 season became the Sounds&#x27; only year of play as a Rangers affiliate. The start of the 2020 season was initially postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic before being cancelled altogether.

Following the 2020 season, Major League Baseball assumed control of Minor League Baseball in a move to increase player salaries, modernize facility standards, and reduce travel. Affiliations were rearranged to situate Triple-A teams closer to their major league parent clubs. The Texas Rangers chose to move their Triple-A affiliation back to Round Rock, Texas, where it had been prior to partnering with Nashville. As a Rangers farm club, the Sounds had a 66–72 record, their lowest record among all affiliations. Nashville held a over 23 years in the Pacific Coast League, while their all-time record stood at 3,125–2,962–2 after 42 seasons played over the course of 43 years.

=== Triple-A East / International League ===
==== Milwaukee Brewers (2021–present) ====

The Sounds became the Triple-A affiliate of the Milwaukee Brewers for a second time in 2021 upon signing a 10-year Professional Development License that runs through 2030. The Brewers desired reuniting with Nashville because of the quality of the player facilities at First Horizon Park and convenient travel options to and from the city. Along with Major League Baseball&#x27;s restructuring of the minors, the Pacific Coast League disbanded, and the Sounds were placed in the Triple-A East.

Opening Day for the 2021 season was postponed for nearly a month to temporarily eliminate commercial air travel and give players the opportunity to be vaccinated against COVID-19 before the season started. No playoffs were held to determine a league champion at the end of the season; instead, the team with the best regular-season record was declared the winner. Nashville placed ninth in the league standings. However, 10 games that had been postponed from the start of the season were reinserted into the schedule as a postseason tournament called the Triple-A Final Stretch in which all 30 Triple-A clubs competed for the highest winning percentage. Nashville finished the tournament tied for fourth place with a 7–2 record.

In 2022, the Triple-A East became known as the International League (IL), the name historically used by the regional circuit prior to the 2021 reorganization. Nashville began play in the renamed league with a 5–4 win against the Durham Bulls at First Horizon Park on April 5. Under manager Rick Sweet, who previously led the team in the last season of their former affiliation with Milwaukee and since their reaffiliation, the 2022 Sounds won the Western Division title with a league-best 91–58 record. In a single playoff game to determine the International League championship, Nashville was shutout, 13–0, by Durham, winners of the Eastern Division. Sweet was chosen for the International League Manager of the Year Award. He also received the Mike Coolbaugh Award in honor of his work ethic, baseball knowledge, and player mentoring. The franchise was recognized with the Minor League Baseball Organization of the Year Award. The IL began using a split-season format in 2023 in which the teams with the best league-wide records at the end of each half have qualified for the playoffs. Overall, the Sounds went 83–65 but did not win either half of the 2023 season. Robert Gasser won the International League Pitcher of the Year Award. In 2024, Nashville tied for seventh place in the first-half with a 38–37 mark, 12 games out of first. They improved in the second-half but finished in third at 40–31, six-and-a-half games back. Their full season record was 78–68. Chad Patrick won the IL Pitcher of the Year Award.

Over four seasons of the current Brewers affiliation, Nashville has a 315–247 record. Through 46 completed seasons of play, the Sounds have an all-time record of 3,398–3,168–2 encompassing all regular and postseason games over 47 years in Nashville.

== Season-by-season records ==

==Rivals==

Nashville&#x27;s chief rivals have been those based in Memphis, Tennessee. Located approximately to the southwest and connected to Nashville by Interstate 40, Memphis has fielded several teams which have competed in the same leagues as Nashville&#x27;s teams since the late 19th century. The Sounds entered the rivalry when they and the Memphis Chicks joined the Southern League in 1978 as members of its Western Division. For three consecutive seasons, from 1979 to 1981, the teams met in the Western Division finals to vie for a spot in the league championship series.

The intrastate rivalry was interrupted when Nashville moved to the American Association in 1985, but it was renewed when they and the Memphis Redbirds joined the Pacific Coast League in 1998. The teams have been division rivals ever since. Memphis beat out second-place Nashville by two games to clinch the 2009 division title and did likewise in 2014 by two-and-a-half games. In 2016, Nashville won the division with a win in Memphis. Roles were reversed in 2017 and 2018 as Memphis captured division titles in Nashville. In 2021, both teams were placed in the Southeastern Division of the Triple-A East. This became the International League in 2022, and both clubs were realigned into its Western Division. As of the completion of the 2024 head-to-head series, the Sounds lead the 27-year rivalry against the Redbirds with a record of 231–197 in 428 meetings.

== Ballparks ==

=== Herschel Greer Stadium (1978–2014) ===
The Sounds originally played at Herschel Greer Stadium from 1978 through 2014. The ballpark, which was demolished in 2019, was located on the grounds of Fort Negley, an American Civil War fortification approximately south of downtown Nashville. The venue experienced numerous expansions and contractions after its completion in 1978, reaching a capacity of 18,000 spectators at its peak, but seated 10,300 during its final 2014 season. The largest attendance, which also set the Southern League record, occurred on August 18, 1982, when 22,315 people saw the Sounds take on the Columbus Astros, many of them standing in roped-off areas in the outfield. Greer&#x27;s best-known feature, installed prior to the 1993 season, was a giant guitar-shaped scoreboard behind the left-field wall.

Following the construction of newer, relatively luxurious minor league ballparks in the late 1980s, Greer Stadium had fallen below the standards set for Triple-A stadiums by professional baseball. At the time, team president Larry Schmittou tried unsuccessfully to convince the city to fund a new ballpark. Throughout the 2000s, the team continued in its attempts to gather approval and financing for a new facility. At one point, First Tennessee Field was planned for construction on the west bank of the Cumberland River in downtown. Disagreements over who would pay for the ballpark repeatedly delayed its opening and eventually resulted in the cancellation of the project altogether. In the meantime, numerous upgrades and repairs were made in order to preserve its functionality until a new stadium could be built. A deal for such a new ballpark was achieved in late 2013. The Sounds played their final game at Greer on August 27, 2014.

=== First Horizon Park (2015–present) ===


The Sounds&#x27; current home ballpark is First Horizon Park, which opened in 2015 and was known as First Tennessee Park through 2019. The facility is located in downtown Nashville at the location of the former Sulphur Dell ballpark. It has a fixed seating capacity of 8,500 people, but can accommodate up to 10,000 with additional group areas and grass berm seating. The ballpark&#x27;s attendance record was set on July 16, 2022, when 12,409 people watched a game between the Sounds and the Memphis Redbirds. The stadium features wide concourses with direct views of the playing field. Its design, which incorporates the use of musical and baseball imagery, is meant to connect the park with the city&#x27;s baseball and musical heritage. Examples include the use of directional signage displaying information on Nashville&#x27;s former teams and players and the grandstand&#x27;s light stanchions reminiscent of those found at Sulphur Dell.

One of First Horizon Park&#x27;s most recognizable features, like Greer Stadium before it, is a guitar-shaped scoreboard beyond the right-center field wall. Unlike Greer&#x27;s guitar, which was only able to display basic in-game information such as the line score, count, and brief player statistics, the larger, modern version is also capable of displaying colorful graphics, animations, player photographs, videos, the batting order, fielding positions, and expanded statistics. Other distinguishing features at the ballpark include The Band Box, an outdoor restaurant and bar which serves variations on traditional ballpark foods, and The Country Club at The Band Box, a 9-hole miniature golf course which exhibits art from different local and regional artists. Since 2016, the Country Legends Race, similar to major league mascot races, such as the Sausage Race and Presidents Race, has been a part of the between-innings entertainment at the park. In the middle of the fifth inning, people in oversized foam caricature costumes depicting country musicians Johnny Cash, George Jones, Reba McEntire, and Dolly Parton race around the warning track from center-field, through the visiting bullpen, and to the home plate side of the first base dugout.

== Uniforms ==
The Sounds have utilized three distinct color schemes, five primary logos, and numerous uniforms since beginning play in 1978. Their original red, white, and blue identity reflected Nashville&#x27;s country music culture, while the switch to red, black, and white in the late 1990s sought to modernize the team. A 2015 rebrand reincorporated elements of the city&#x27;s musical heritage, which had been largely absent in previous years. The team reworked its identity in 2019, further integrating the city&#x27;s baseball and musical heritage with the Sounds of the present.

=== 1978–2018 ===
From 1978 to 1986, the team wore pullover v-neck jerseys made of white fabric, for home games, gray, for road games, and red, blue, and powder blue, for use as alternates. These had red, white, and blue tri-color bands around the neck, with larger bands at the sleeve openings (blue jerseys had one white band and two red bands). &quot;Sounds&quot; was written across the chest in red-on-blue music note-like script (powder blue jerseys had red-on-white script). Numbers were sewn on the back. Some jerseys during this period bore a Slugger patch on the right sleeve. The team had three sets of pants: white, gray, and powder blue, all with small tri-color stripes down the legs and larger stripes around the waistband. Beginning in the mid-1980s, numbers were also located on the front of jerseys below the team name on the player&#x27;s left in the same colors as the team name. The team cap was blue with a red brim bearing a white &quot;N&quot; styled like a music note bordered by red; this was the official team cap from 1978 through the mid-1990s. These first uniforms were modeled after those worn at the time by the Texas Rangers.

From 1987 to 1998, the team wore white button-up jerseys, for home games, and gray, for road games. The home jersey design remained largely similar to its predecessor. &quot;Sounds&quot; was still written across the chest in blue and red music note script; though, the font was changed briefly from 1987 to 1988. Numbers remained on the front in blue-on-red block characters. The player&#x27;s number was present on the back in red and blue. Names were added in blue some years. Road grays had &quot;Nashville&quot; on the chest but lacked tri-color bands at both the neck and sleeves. During this time, the team also added a blue mesh v-neck jersey with the red and white guitar swinger logo on the left chest. Blue belts replaced the pants&#x27; wide tri-color stripes. The Sounds continued to wear the original red-billed blue cap with all uniforms until approximately 1993 when a new cap was introduced. This all-blue cap interposed the &quot;N&quot; with the &quot;Slugger&quot; logo. The two caps were worn interchangeably through 1998.

Over the course of the 1998 and 1999 seasons, the team switched to a red and black color scheme. In the latter, uniforms consisted of black-pinstriped jerseys with black sleeves bearing a new music note logo on the left sleeve. White home jerseys had &quot;Sounds&quot; across the chest in red with a white-on-black border using the same font used by the Anaheim Angels at the time. Road grays read &quot;Nashville&quot; on the chest in the same style. Both had the player&#x27;s number sewn on the back in block characters of the same colors. An alternate solid red jersey with black and gray trim around the sleeve openings and a music note logo on the left chest was also worn. Another alternate, made of black material, had red and white trim at the sleeve openings and a similar music note logo on the left chest. All four were paired with pinstriped pants. Caps were black with the circular music note logo.

From 2003 to 2005, the Sounds switched to solid-colored jerseys and pants. The fronts had &quot;Sounds&quot; written across the chest in red script surrounded by black with the player&#x27;s number on the front below the team name in red-on-black block characters. Red and black piping ran around sleeve openings and along the row of buttons going up and down the front and around the neck. The left sleeve bore the music note logo. Pants had the same piping going down the legs on the outside and were paired with black belts. The road uniform set, though made of gray material and with &quot;Nashville&quot; across the front, was otherwise identical. A sleeveless red alternate jersey with black piping and similar white-on-black markings was worn in this period. They also continued use of the previous generation&#x27;s black alternate. The official home and road caps worn from 2003 to 2014 were black with a red and white music note logo.

From 2006 to 2012, the team&#x27;s jerseys were similar to those of the previous era, but lacked sleeves and the player&#x27;s number on the front. These vest-like jerseys were worn over black T-shirts of varying sleeve lengths. The player&#x27;s name was written on the back in black block characters; numbers were also displayed in large red-on-black characters. The matching road jerseys initially bared &quot;Sounds&quot; across the chest, but were later changed to &quot;Nashville&quot;; these usually lacked the player&#x27;s name on the back. A Milwaukee Brewers logo was added to the front left shoulder in 2007. A red mesh jersey with yellow, white, and black markings was worn from 2006 to 2007. A new red alternate was introduced in 2010. These were similar to the primary home and road mesh jerseys the team would adopt in 2013, but were red with black underarm sections and piping. &quot;Sounds&quot; was displayed across the chest in white-on-black script. A Brewers logo was located on the left, front chest, and the back numbers were white-on-black. All uniforms continued to be topped off with black caps with a red and white music note logo.

From 2013 to 2014, jerseys were made of mesh material with black sections at the armpits and a single line of black piping going down the sleeves and across the shoulders to the neck. A Brewers logo was sewn on the left sleeve. &quot;Sounds&quot; was written across the chest of home jerseys in the same red/black script used since 2003. The player&#x27;s name was displayed on the back in black block characters; numbers were also shown in large red-on-black digits. Road jerseys were the same, but with &quot;Nashville&quot; across the chest, red underarm sections and piping, and no name on the back. The team continued to wear the previous red alternate of the same style. All were paired with the black cap bearing the red and white music note logo.

From 2015 to 2018, home whites had single lines of red piping around the sleeve openings and up the front going around the neck. &quot;Sounds&quot; was displayed on the chest in red letters which resembled the sound holes on a guitar with a silver-on-black border. A swinging guitar logo was located on the left sleeve, while a green Athletics elephant logo was on the right. The player&#x27;s name was sewn on the back in black block characters with his number displayed below in red sound-hole lettering with a silver border and black drop shadow. White pants with a line of red piping going up the sides were worn with black belts. The home cap was black with the primary &quot;N&quot; guitar pick logo. Gray road uniforms were identical with only a few exceptions: they had &quot;Nashville&quot; on the chest, pants lacked any piping, and the cap bore an &quot;S&quot; guitar pick logo. An alternate black jersey with &quot;Music City&quot; on the front, red piping, no name on the reverse, and &quot;Nashville&quot; embroidered in red letters under the Athletics sleeve logo was also worn. A second set of alternates, introduced in 2016, were sublimation-printed red jerseys with black and white bands at the neck and bands of silver, black, and white around the sleeve openings. A guitar&#x27;s fret and headstock extended upward from these bands on each sleeve. &quot;Nashville&quot; appeared on the chest in white sound-hole lettering bordered by silver and black. The player&#x27;s number was located below the city&#x27;s name and on the back in silver characters with a white border and black drop shadow.

===2019–present===

Since the 2019 season, home jerseys have been white with &quot;NASH&quot; boldly arched across the chest in navy blue with the player&#x27;s number in red under the name on the left side. The sleeves have thin navy and red bands at the openings with six thin red stripes, reminiscent of guitar strings, running from the openings up the shoulders before terminating near the collar. The left side bears a navy &quot;NASH&quot; pick logo set against the strings. The player&#x27;s name is displayed on the back in navy with the number below in red. The home pants, worn with navy belts, are white with a pair of navy and red stripes running down the outsides. The home cap is all navy with a red &quot;N&quot; icon, styled like a guitar or violin&#x27;s F-hole, outlined in white.

Road grays have lines of red piping around the neck and along the row of buttons going up the chest with a red and white &quot;N&quot; icon on the left side and the player&#x27;s number on the right in the same colors. Each sleeve has a thin red band at the opening with a secondary logo displaying the Sounds&#x27; script wordmark in navy set against a red baseball on the left sleeve. The player&#x27;s number is displayed on the back in red with a white border. Gray pants, worn with navy belts, have the same navy/red stripes as the home pants. The road cap has a red bill but is otherwise identical to the home cap.

The navy blue alternate has &quot;Nashville&quot; written across the chest in an F-hole-styled red font with a white outline. Similar to the home whites, these have red and white bands at the openings and the guitar strings on the sleeves and behind the &quot;NASH&quot; pick are white. The player&#x27;s number is displayed on the back in red with a white border. The alternate cap is navy with a white front panel, red bill, and a red &quot;N&quot; icon outlined in navy.

The red alternate is a v-neck pullover with &quot;Sounds&quot; on the chest in navy bordered by white in the F-hole script. The player&#x27;s number is below the team name in navy outlined in white. The sleeves bear navy and white bands at the sleeve openings and white strings on the sleeves behind the &quot;NASH&quot; pick logo. A larger navy stripe and smaller white stripe go around the neck opening. The player&#x27;s number is displayed on the back in navy with a white border. The cap is navy with a white front panel bearing three navy stars arranged like those on the flag of Tennessee set in a red-outlined home plate.

Throwback uniforms honoring the 1978 Sounds are worn for Thursday home games in conjunction with Throwback Thursday promotions. The jerseys, similar to those worn by early Sounds teams, are white pullover v-necks with bands of red, white, and blue around the neck and sleeve openings. &quot;Sounds&quot; is written across the chest in red-on-blue music note-like script, with the player&#x27;s number below on the left in red block characters with blue borders. The left sleeve bears the &quot;Slugger&quot; logo. High white pants are worn with blue belts and either blue socks or stirrups. The cap is blue with a red brim, displaying an &quot;N&quot; styled like an eighth note in white bordered by red.

A fourth alternate jersey is worn for Saturday games as a part of Hit City Saturday promotions. These white v-neck pullovers have &quot;Hit City&quot; across the chest in navy, with red silhouettes of the Nashville skyline above and the lower half of the guitar scoreboard below. The neck and sleeve openings have navy bands, the left sleeve bears the primary team logo, and the player&#x27;s number is displayed in navy characters on the front and back. These jerseys are paired with the road cap and home white pants.

== Radio and television ==
During the inaugural season of 1978, Sounds games were broadcast on radio by Monte Hale. Bob Jamison, the team&#x27;s longest-tenured announcer, called games from 1979 through 1990. He was followed by Steve Carroll (1991–1995), Steve Selby (1996–1999), Chuck Valenches (2000–2009), and Stu Paul (2010–2011). Jeff Hem has been the team&#x27;s lead broadcaster since 2012.

All Sounds home and road games are broadcast on 94.9 FM The Fan (AM 830). Live audio broadcasts are also available online through the team&#x27;s website and the MiLB First Pitch app. Games can be viewed through the MiLB.TV subscription feature of the official website of Minor League Baseball, with audio provided by a radio simulcast.

== Mascots ==
The Nashville Sounds&#x27; mascot is an anthropomorphic rooster named Booster. He is bright red with yellow legs, beak, comb, and palms and red, orange, and yellow tail feathers resembling flames. He wears the same jerseys as the team with the number zero. He made his debut on April 17, 2015, at the Sounds&#x27; first game at First Tennessee Park. His name refers to &quot;boosting&quot; or building enthusiasm for the team, while his appearance is a play on Nashville hot chicken.

The first Sounds mascot was introduced during the team&#x27;s inaugural 1978 season. Homer Horsehide resembled their major league affiliate&#x27;s mascot—Mr. Red of the Cincinnati Reds. The character was human in appearance, except for an oversized anthropomorphized baseball in place of a human head. The mustachioed mascot donned a uniform identical to that of Sounds players. Homer continued as the team mascot through at least 1982. From 1995 to mid 1996, the mascot was a lime-green dinosaur named Champ, who was borrowed from the New York–Penn League&#x27;s Vermont Expos.

An anthropomorphic cougar named Ozzie was the team&#x27;s mascot from 1997 to 2014. The original Ozzie came from the Midwest League&#x27;s Kane County Cougars, which were owned by the same group that owned the Sounds and had an extra mascot costume. The surplus cougar outfit was sent to Nashville, and, after building a fan following during his first season, team management decided to make Ozzie the permanent mascot. The original costume was brown, but a new muscular yellow costume was introduced in 1998. Ozzie wore the same style of uniform as the team, but with no hat. He was retired when the Sounds left Greer Stadium in 2014, although he continued to make appearances during the 2014 to 2015 offseason.

== Roster ==

== Achievements ==
=== Awards ===

Sixteen players have won league awards in recognition for their performance with the Sounds. Three players have won league Most Valuable Player (MVP) awards. Steve Balboni (1980) and Brian Dayett (1982) won the Southern League MVP Award, and Magglio Ordóñez (1997) won the American Association MVP Award. Eleven players have won Pitcher of the Year honors. Bruce Berenyi (1978), Geoff Combe (1979), Andy McGaffigan (1980), Jamie Werly (1981), and Stefan Wever (1982) were selected for the Southern League Most Outstanding Pitcher Award. Chris Hammond (1990) and Scott Ruffcorn (1994) won the American Association Most Valuable Pitcher Award. R. A. Dickey (2007), Johnny Hellweg (2013), and Jimmy Nelson (2014) were selected for the Pacific Coast League Pitcher of the Year Award. Robert Gasser (2023) and Chad Patrick (2024) won the International League Pitcher of the Year Award. The American Association Rookie of the Year Award was won by Jeff Abbott (1996) and Magglio Ordóñez (1997). Ordóñez is the only Sounds player to win multiple league awards.

Five managers have been selected as their league&#x27;s Manager of the Year. Stump Merrill (1980) won the Southern League Manager of the Year Award. Rick Renick (1993 and 1996) won the American Association Manager of the Year Award. Frank Kremblas (2007) and Steve Scarsone (2016) won the Pacific Coast League Manager of the Year Award. Rick Sweet (2022) won the International League Manager of the Year Award.

Seventy-six players have been selected for midseason All-Star teams. Of those players, Jamie Werly (1980 and 1981), Joey Vierra (1992 and 1995), Drew Denson (1993 and 1994), Scott Ruffcorn (1994 and 1996), and Vinny Rottino (2007 and 2008) are the only players to have been selected twice as Sounds. Four players have been chosen as the MVP of midseason All-Star games: Duane Walker (1979), Ray Durham (1994), Magglio Ordóñez (1997), and Renato Núñez (2017). Of the 52 players who have been named to postseason All-Star teams, only Duane Walker (1979 in two positions) and Jeff Abbott (1996 and 1997) have been selected twice.

=== Retired numbers ===
The Sounds have honored three players by retiring their uniform numbers. This ensures that the number will be associated with one player of particular importance to the team. An additional number, 42, was retired throughout professional baseball in 1997 to honor Jackie Robinson, the first African American to play in Major League Baseball in the modern era. The Sounds&#x27; retired numbers are displayed on the concourse near the home plate entrance at First Horizon Park.

The number 00 was retired in 1991 in honor of Skeeter Barnes, a third baseman in 1979 and mostly an outfielder from 1988 to 1990. Barnes was a 1989 Triple-A All-Star and holds the franchise career records for games played, at bats, and hits. The number 18 was retired to honor Don Mattingly in 1999. Though only a Sound during the 1981 season, the first baseman led the team in games played, hits, doubles, and RBI. Additionally, Mattingly was named to the Southern League All-Star team and was selected as the New York Yankees&#x27; Minor League Player of the Year. The number 17 was retired in 2022 to honor Tim Dillard, a pitcher from 2007 to 2014 and in 2019. Over nine seasons in which he primarily appeared as a reliever, Dillard set the career records for wins, games pitched, innings pitched, and strikeouts.

=== Hall of Famers ===
Four former Sounds have been elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame. Closer Trevor Hoffman, who was inducted in 2018, played the majority of the 1992 season with Nashville while working his way up through the Cincinnati Reds organization. He later made two major league rehabilitation appearances while with the Milwaukee Brewers in 2009. Two other Hall of Fame players appeared in games for Nashville solely on rehab assignments. Shortstop Barry Larkin, who was inducted in 2012, appeared in two games in 1989. Outfielder Tim Raines, who played three games with Nashville in 1993, was inducted in 2017. Hoyt Wilhelm, the Sounds&#x27; pitching coach from 1982 to 1984, was inducted in 1985.

The Sounds are also represented in the Southern League Hall of Fame. Larry Schmittou, who helped bring baseball to Nashville in 1978 and was a team executive and owner through 1996, was inducted in 2016.

== Managers ==

Over the course of 46 seasons, the Nashville Sounds have been led by 29 managers. Three managers have guided the team to win their league&#x27;s championship. George Scherger (1979) and Johnny Oates (1982) led the team to win the Southern League championship. Frank Kremblas (2005) led them to win the Pacific Coast League championship. Rick Sweet, who previously managed the team in 2014, has been the Sounds&#x27; manager since 2021. He is also the longest-tenured manager in team history, having managed the team for 706 games across five seasons. The manager with the highest winning percentage over a full season or more is Stump Merrill, who led the Sounds to a .622 winning percentage from 1980 to 1981.

<doc id="207128" wikidata="Q966879" url="?curid=207128" title="Albuquerque Isotopes">
<text>The Albuquerque Isotopes are a Minor League Baseball team of the Pacific Coast League and the Triple-A affiliate of the Colorado Rockies. They play home games at Rio Grande Credit Union Field at Isotopes Park in Albuquerque, New Mexico, at an elevation of above sea level.

In 2003, the Calgary Cannons moved from Alberta to Albuquerque and became the Isotopes playing in the Pacific Coast League. The team was affiliated with the Florida Marlins until 2008, the Los Angeles Dodgers from 2009 to 2014 and the Colorado Rockies since 2015. In conjunction with Major League Baseball&#x27;s restructuring of Minor League Baseball in 2021, the Isotopes were organized into the Triple-A West, which was renamed the Pacific Coast League in 2022. The team won division titles in 2003, 2009, and 2012; it has never won a league championship.

The Isotopes&#x27; mascot is Orbit, a yellow, orange, and red alien (similar to the Houston Astros&#x27; mascot of the same name). In 2016, &quot;Forbes&quot; listed the team as the 14th-most valuable Minor League Baseball team with a value of $34 million.

==Background==
The Isotopes were preceded in minor league baseball play by the Albuquerque Dukes of the 1915 Rio Grande Association, followed by the Albuquerque Dons and Albuquerque Cardinals, who played as members of the Arizona-Texas League from 1932 to 1941. In 1946, the Albuquerque Dukes began a long era of play as members of the West Texas-New Mexico League.

Albuquerque&#x27;s previous minor-league team was the Los Angeles Dodgers-affiliated Albuquerque Dukes, which won several PCL championships in the 1970s and 1980s. The team was sold to Marshall Glickman and Mike Higgins, who moved it to Oregon in March 2000 and renamed it the Portland Beavers. 

In January 2001, a group of businessmen led by Ken Young and Mike Koldyke agreed to buy the Calgary Cannons with the intention of bringing the team to Albuquerque for the 2003 season. But Young and Koldyke told the city of Albuquerque that they would only buy the team if the city would fund a new stadium or renovate the existing Albuquerque Sports Stadium. In May 2001, the city approved a vote to spend $25 million on a renovation. Ken Young and Mike Koldyke then bought the Cannons, moved the team to Albuquerque, and renamed it the Isotopes. 

===Name origins===
The team&#x27;s name recalls the fictional &#x27;Springfield Isotopes&#x27; from the long-running TV series &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, first appearing in the Season 2 episode &quot;Dancin&#x27; Homer&quot; (aired in 1990) in which the main character Homer Simpson temporarily becomes his local baseball team&#x27;s mascot. In the episode &quot;Hungry, Hungry Homer&quot;, which first aired on March 4, 2001, Homer attempts to thwart the team&#x27;s plan to move to Albuquerque by going on a hunger strike. Subsequently, when the &quot;Albuquerque Tribune&quot; asked its online readers to help choose a new name for the Cannons, &quot;Isotopes&quot; received 67 percent of the 120,000 votes cast. &quot;Dancin&#x27; Homer&quot; writer Ken Levine said he was surprised when many Albuquerque journalists started calling him regarding the team name, as Isotopes had been chosen as &quot;the funniest, goofiest name we could come up with&quot; and he never thought it had potential for a real team, while adding that he had always liked the city&#x27;s previous minor league team, the Albuquerque Dukes, as it was the farm team of the Los Angeles Dodgers he supported.

Though team president Ken Young admitted that the name came from the series, he said at the name&#x27;s unveiling, &quot;We picked it because over the past year it has become a popular name, and it does have something to do with Albuquerque.&quot; The &quot;Isotopes&quot; name was deemed appropriate, since New Mexico has a number of well-known scientific and military facilities dealing with nuclear technology, such as Los Alamos National Laboratory, Sandia National Laboratories, and the Waste Isolation Pilot Project (WIPP), as well as the site of the Trinity test. In addition, uranium mining was a significant industry in the state during the Cold War.

In the three months after the team&#x27;s name was announced in September 2002, before the team ever took the field, the team sold more merchandise than the previous Albuquerque Dukes had sold in any single season, and led minor league baseball in merchandising revenue in 2003. The team said they were able to tell when episodes featuring the Springfield Isotopes would air in different markets based on clusters of orders from different viewing areas. The team has no working agreements with the rightsholders of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. However, statues of Homer, Bart, Lisa, and Marge Simpson (originally created as a promotional item for the 2007 film) are located at RGCU Field at Isotopes Park.

==Team history==
The planned renovation eventually turned into the construction of a new baseball facility, Isotopes Park, around the old playing field.

The Isotopes played their first official game in Albuquerque on April 11, 2003, three years after the Dukes left for Portland. At Isotopes Park, the baseball team was greeted by over 12,000 fans in their opening day game. In the Isotopes&#x27; opening season, the baseball team saw over 575,000 fans enter their stadium to watch their newly acquired team perform. During the 2003 season, Albuquerque saw immediate success as their new team won the 2003 Central Division Title and in addition to that, entered the 2003 Pacific Coast League Playoffs.

In 2008, the Albuquerque Isotopes achieved a new feat when they reached a new franchise record in attendance with over 590,000 fans. 

In July 2009, Albuquerque received an unusual amount of nationwide attention following the arrival of Manny Ramirez. The outfielder at the time was under intense scrutiny for a suspension he received after testing positive for performance-enhancing drugs, more commonly known as PEDs, and was slated to play a total of three games with the Albuquerque Isotopes before returning to the major league. The Albuquerque Isotopes ran multiple promotions for the arrival of Manny Ramirez including advertisements, wigs bearing an extreme similarity to the hair of Manny Ramirez, etc. which ultimately led to a then-attendance record with over 15,000 fans attending the outfielder&#x27;s opening game with the Isotopes. In addition to this, there was a large amount of harsh criticism towards the team from numerous sports media outlets including ESPN and sports commentators such as Bob Costas.

In conjunction with Major League Baseball&#x27;s restructuring of Minor League Baseball in 2021, the Isotopes were organized into the Triple-A West. Albuquerque ended the season in fourth place in the Eastern Division with a 52–68 record. No playoffs were held to determine a league champion; instead, the team with the best regular-season record was declared the winner. However, 10 games that had been postponed from the start of the season were reinserted into the schedule as a postseason tournament called the Triple-A Final Stretch in which all 30 Triple-A clubs competed for the highest winning percentage. Albuquerque finished the tournament tied for seventh place with a 6–4 record. In 2022, the Triple-A West became known as the Pacific Coast League, the name historically used by the regional circuit prior to the 2021 reorganization.

The franchise was purchased by Diamond Baseball Holdings following the 2023 season.

<doc id="207142" wikidata="Q335889" url="?curid=207142" title="Alan Brooke, 1st Viscount Alanbrooke">
<text>Field Marshal Alan Francis Brooke, 1st Viscount Alanbrooke (23 July 1883 – 17 June 1963), was a senior officer of the British Army. He was Chief of the Imperial General Staff (CIGS), the professional head of the British Army, during the Second World War, and was promoted to field marshal on 1 January 1944.

Brooke trained as an artillery officer and became Commandant of the School of Artillery, Larkhill in 1929. He held various divisional and corps level commands before the Second World War and became C-in-C Home Forces in 1940. He then became Chief of the Imperial General Staff in 1941. In that role he focused on strategy and, in particular, on the Mediterranean theatre. Here, his principal aims were to rid North Africa of Axis forces and knock Italy out of the war, thereby opening up the Mediterranean for Allied shipping, and then mount the cross-Channel invasion when the Allies were ready and the Germans sufficiently weakened. He then developed the strategy for pushing back the German forces in western Europe.

As chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee, Brooke was the foremost military advisor to Prime Minister Winston Churchill, and had the role of co-ordinator of the British military efforts in the Allies&#x27; victory in 1945. After retiring from the British Army, he served as Lord High Constable of England during the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953. His war diaries attracted attention for their criticism of Churchill and for Brooke&#x27;s forthright views on other leading figures of the war.

==Background and early life==
Alan Brooke was born on 23 July 1883 at Bagnères-de-Bigorre, Hautes-Pyrénées, to a prominent Anglo-Irish family from West Ulster. The Brookes had a long military tradition as the &quot;Fighting Brookes of Colebrooke&quot;, with a history of service in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, and World War I. He was the seventh and youngest child of Sir Victor Brooke, 3rd Baronet, of Colebrooke Park, Brookeborough, County Fermanagh, and the former Alice Bellingham, second daughter of Sir Alan Bellingham, 3rd Baronet, of Castle Bellingham in County Louth. Brooke&#x27;s father died when he was just eight years old.

Brooke was educated at a day school in Pau, France, where he lived until the age of 16; he was bi-lingual in French (which he spoke with a heavy Gascon accent and spoke as a first language as a result of his upbringing in the French Pyrenees) and English. He spoke both French and English very fast, leading some Americans later in life to distrust a &quot;fast-talking Limey.&quot; He was also fluent in German, and had learnt Urdu and Persian.

Brooke, desiring a military career, &quot;only just&quot; qualified for the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich in 1900, coming sixty-fifth out of seventy-two in the entrance exam, but passed out at seventeenth. Had he done any better he would have qualified for a commission in the Royal Engineers, as was his initial intention, and possibly would not have ended up on the General Staff after the Great War.

Brooke was commissioned into the Royal Regiment of Artillery as a second lieutenant on 24 December 1902. Due to his high placing at Woolwich Brooke was allowed to choose which branch of the Royal Artillery to join. His choice was the Royal Field Artillery, with which he served in Ireland and India in the years leading up to the outbreak of the First World War in the summer of 1914. He also received his &quot;jacket&quot; upon being selected to join the Royal Horse Artillery.

==First World War==

During the war, he was assigned to an ammunition column of the Royal Horse Artillery on the Western Front, where he gained a reputation as an outstanding planner of operations. He later was transferred to the 18th Division. At the Battle of the Somme in 1916, he introduced the French &quot;creeping barrage&quot; system, thereby helping the protection of the advancing infantry from enemy machine gun fire. Brooke was with the Canadian Corps from early 1917 and planned the barrages for the Battle of Vimy Ridge. In 1918 he was appointed GSO1 as the senior artillery staff officer in the First Army. Brooke ended the conflict as a lieutenant-colonel with the Distinguished Service Order and Bar and was mentioned in despatches six times.

As with many others of his generation, the war left its mark upon Brooke. In October 1918, shortly before the Armistice of 11 November 1918, he wrote 

When the Armistice did eventually arrive Brooke was in London on leave. He watched the crowds of people celebrating but felt mixed feelings, as he himself later wrote:

On 31 March 1942 he wrote:

==Between the wars==
During the interwar period, Brooke attended the first post-war course at the Staff College, Camberley in 1919. He managed to impress both his fellow students and the college&#x27;s instructors during the relatively brief time he was there. He then served as a staff officer with the 50th Division from 1920 to 1923. Brooke then returned to Camberley, this time as an instructor, before attending the Imperial Defence College. He was later appointed as an instructor at the college, and while there he became acquainted with most of the officers who became leading British commanders of the Second World War. From 1929 onwards Brooke held a number of important appointments: Inspector of Artillery, Director of Military Training and then General Officer Commanding (GOC) of the Mobile Division (later the 1st Armoured Division) in 1935. In 1938, on promotion to lieutenant-general, he took command of the Anti-Aircraft Corps (renamed Anti-Aircraft Command in April 1939) and built a strong relationship with Air Chief Marshal Hugh Dowding, the AOC-in-C of Fighter Command, which laid a vital basis of co-operation between the two commands during the Battle of Britain the following year. In July 1939 Brooke moved to command Southern Command. By the outbreak of the Second World War, Brooke was already seen as one of the British Army&#x27;s foremost generals.

==Second World War==
===Commander in Flanders, France and Britain===
Following the outbreak of the Second World War, in September 1939, Brooke commanded II Corps in the British Expeditionary Force (BEF)—which included in its subordinate formations the 3rd Infantry Division, commanded by the then Major-General Bernard Montgomery, as well as Major-General Dudley Johnson&#x27;s 4th Infantry Division. As corps commander, Brooke had a pessimistic view of the Allies&#x27; chances of countering a German offensive. He was sceptical of the quality and determination of the French Army, and of the Belgian Army. This scepticism appeared to be justified when he was on a visit to some French front-line units and was shocked to see unshaven men, ungroomed horses and dirty vehicles.

He had also little trust in Lord Gort, Commander-in-Chief of the BEF, who Brooke thought took too much interest in details while being incapable of taking a broad strategic view. Gort, on the other hand, regarded Brooke as a pessimist who failed to spread confidence, and was thinking of replacing him. Brooke correctly predicted that the Allied powers&#x27; Plan D envisioning an advance along the Meuse would allow the Wehrmacht to outflank them, but British High Command dismissed his warnings as defeatist. 

When the German offensive began, Brooke, aided by Neil Ritchie, his Brigadier General Staff (BGS), distinguished himself in the handling of the British forces in the retreat to Dunkirk. His II Corps faced rapid German Army armored advances following the Allied defeat at the Battle of Sedan. In late May 1940 it held off the major German attack on the Ypres-Comines Canal but then found its left flank exposed by the capitulation of the Belgian army. Brooke swiftly ordered Montgomery&#x27;s 3rd Division to switch from the Corps&#x27; right flank to cover the gap. This was accomplished in a complicated night-time manoeuvre. Pushing more troops north to counter the threat to the embarking troops at the Dunkirk evacuation from German units advancing along the coast, II Corps retreated to their appointed places on the east or south-east of the shrinking perimeter of Dunkirk. Brooke&#x27;s actions not only saved his own forces from capitulation, but prevented the Germans from seizing the 20-mile gap left by the Belgian surrender and capturing the entire BEF before it could safely evacuate.

Then on 29 May Brooke was ordered by Gort to return to England, leaving the Corps in Montgomery&#x27;s hands. According to Montgomery, Brooke was so overcome with emotion at having to leave his men in such a crisis that &quot;he broke down and wept&quot; as he handed over to Montgomery on the beaches of La Panne. He was told by Gort to &quot;proceed home ... for (the) task of reforming new armies&quot; and so returned on a destroyer (30 May). Then &quot;on June 2nd set out for the War Office to find out what I was wanted for&quot; with a &quot;light heart&quot; and with no responsibility, and was then told by Dill (CIGS) that he was to &quot;return to France to form a new BEF&quot;; he later said that hearing the command from Dill was &quot;one of his blackest (moments) in the war&quot;. He had already realised that there was no hope of success for the &quot;Brittany plan&quot; (Breton redoubt) to keep an allied redoubt in France. After General Maxime Weygand warned him that the French Army was collapsing and could offer no further resistance, he decided that he needed to convince his superiors to allow him to withdraw his forces to Cherbourg and Brest for evacuation to Britain. He told Secretary for War Anthony Eden that the mission had &quot;no military value and no hope of success&quot; although he could not comment on its political value. In his first conversation with Prime Minister Winston Churchill (Brooke had been rung by Dill who was at 10 Downing Street) he insisted that all British forces should be withdrawn from France. Churchill initially objected but was eventually convinced by Brooke; around 200,000 British and Allied troops were successfully evacuated from ports in northwestern France.

===Home Forces===
After returning for a short spell at Southern Command Brooke was appointed in July 1940 to command United Kingdom Home Forces to take charge of anti-invasion preparations. Thus it would have been Brooke&#x27;s task to direct the land battle in the event of a German amphibious invasion of Great Britain. Contrary to his predecessor General Sir Edmund Ironside, who favoured a static coastal defence, Brooke developed a mobile reserve which was to swiftly counterattack the enemy forces before they were established. A light line of defence on the coast was to assure that the landings were delayed as much as possible. Writing after the war, Brooke acknowledged that he also &quot;had every intention of using sprayed mustard gas on the beaches&quot;.

Brooke believed that the lack of a unified command of the three services was &quot;a grave danger&quot; to the defence of the country. Despite this, and the fact that the available forces never reached the numbers he thought were required, Brooke considered the situation far from &quot;helpless&quot; if the Germans were to invade. &quot;We should certainly have a desperate struggle and the future might well have hung in the balance, but I certainly felt that given a fair share of the fortunes of war we should certainly succeed in finally defending these shores&quot;, he wrote after the war. But in the end, the German invasion plan was never taken beyond the preliminary assembly of forces.

===Chief of the Imperial General Staff===
In December 1941 Brooke succeeded Field Marshal Sir John Dill as Chief of the Imperial General Staff (CIGS), the professional head of the British Army, in which appointment he also represented the British Army on the Chiefs of Staff Committee. In March 1942 he succeeded Admiral of the Fleet Sir Dudley Pound as chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee.

For the remainder of the Second World War, Brooke was the foremost military adviser to the British Prime Minister, Winston Churchill (who was also Minister of Defence), the War Cabinet, and to Britain&#x27;s allies. As CIGS, Brooke was the functional head of the British Army, and as chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee, which he dominated by force of intellect and personality, he took the leading military part in the overall strategic direction of the British war effort. In 1942, Brooke joined the Western Allies&#x27; ultimate command, the U.S.-British Combined Chiefs of Staff. Brooke was responsible for commanding the entire British Army; he focused on grand strategy, and his relationships, through the Combined Chiefs of Staff, with his American counterparts. He was also responsible for the appointment and evaluation of senior commanders, allocation of manpower and equipment and the organization of tactical air forces in support of land operations of field commanders. In addition he had primary responsibility for supervising the military operations of the Free French, Polish, Dutch, Belgian, and Czech units reporting to their governments in exile in London. Brooke vigorously allocated responsibilities to his deputies. Despite the traditional historical distrust that had existed between the military and the political side of the War Office, he got along quite well with his political counterpart, the Secretary of State for War, first the Conservative politician David Margesson and later Sir James Grigg, the former head civil servant of the department, who in an unusual move was promoted to the ministerial post.

Brooke&#x27;s focus was primarily on his Mediterranean strategy for the Mediterranean theatre. Here, his principal aims were to rid North Africa of Axis forces and knock Italy out of the war, thereby opening up the Mediterranean for Allied shipping, and then mount the cross-Channel invasion when the Allies were ready and the Germans sufficiently weakened.

Brooke&#x27;s and the British view of the Mediterranean operations contrasted with the American commitment to an early invasion of western Europe, which led to several heated arguments at the many conferences of the Combined Chiefs of Staff.

During the first years of the Anglo-American alliance, it was often the British who got their way. At the London Conference in April 1942, Brooke and Churchill seem to have misled General George C. Marshall, the U.S. Army Chief of Staff, about the British intentions on an early landing in France. At the Casablanca Conference in January 1943, it was decided that the Allies should invade Sicily, under the command of General Dwight D. Eisenhower, a decision that effectively postponed the planned invasion of Western Europe until 1944. The Casablanca agreement was in fact a compromise, brokered largely by Brooke&#x27;s old friend Field Marshal Sir John Dill, Chief of the British Joint Staff Mission in Washington, D.C. &quot;I owe him [Dill] an unbounded debt of gratitude for his help on that occasion and in many other similar ones&quot;, Brooke wrote after the war.

The post of CIGS was less rewarding than command in an important theatre of war but the CIGS chose the generals who commanded those theatres and decided what men and munitions they should have. When it came to finding the right commanders he often complained that many officers who would have been good commanders had been killed in the First World War and that this was one reason behind the difficulties the British had in the beginning of the war. When General Sir Claude Auchinleck was to be replaced as the commander of the British Eighth Army in 1942, Brooke preferred Lieutenant-General Bernard Montgomery (Montgomery was both Brooke&#x27;s ex-pupil and his protégé ) instead of Lieutenant-General William Gott, who was Churchill&#x27;s candidate. Soon thereafter Gott was killed when his aircraft was shot down and Montgomery received the command. Brooke would later reflect upon the tragic event which led to the appointment of Montgomery as an intervention by God. A few days earlier Brooke had been offered Auchinleck&#x27;s main job of Commander-in-Chief Middle East. Brooke declined, believing he now knew better than any other general how to deal with Churchill. He recorded that it would take a new CIGS six months to learn to handle Churchill, and &quot;during those six months anything might happen&quot;.

A year later, the war had taken a different turn and Brooke no longer believed it necessary to stay at Churchill&#x27;s side. He therefore looked forward to taking command of the Allied invasion of Western Europe, a post Brooke believed he had been promised by Churchill on three occasions. During the first Quebec Conference in August 1943, it was decided that the command would go to General George Marshall. (Although in the event Marshall&#x27;s work as U.S. Army Chief of Staff was too important for him to leave Washington, D.C., and Dwight Eisenhower was appointed instead.) Brooke was bitterly disappointed, both at being passed over and of the way the decision was conveyed to him by Churchill, who according to Brooke &quot;dealt with the matter as if it were one of minor importance&quot;.

Brooke or &quot;Brookie&quot; as he was often known, is reckoned to be one of the foremost of all the heads of the British Army. He was quick in mind and speech and deeply respected by his military colleagues, both British and Allied, although his uncompromising style could make the Americans wary.

As CIGS, Brooke had a strong influence on the grand strategy of the Western Allies. The war in the west unfolded more or less according to his plans, at least until 1943 when the American forces were still relatively small in comparison to the British. Among the most crucial of his contributions was his opposition to an early landing in France, which was important for delaying Operation Overlord until June 1944.

He was a cautious general with a great respect for the German war machine. Some American planners thought that Brooke&#x27;s participation in the campaigns of the First World War and in the two evacuations from France in the Second World War made him lack the aggression they believed necessary for victory. According to historian Max Hastings, Brooke&#x27;s reputation as a strategist was &quot;significantly damaged&quot; by his remarks at the Trident Conference in Washington in May 1943, where he claimed that no major operations on the continent would be possible until 1945 or 1946. His diary says that he wanted &quot;operations in the Mediterranean to force a dispersal of German forces, help Russia, and thus eventually produce a situation where cross Channel operations are possible&quot; but that Churchill &quot;entirely repudiated&quot; (or half repudiated) the paper we (the CCOS) had agreed on; Harry Hopkins got him to withdraw his proposed amendments but that Churchill had aroused suspicions with his talk of &quot;ventures in the Balkans.&quot;

===Relationship with Churchill===
During the years as CIGS, Brooke had a stormy relationship with Winston Churchill. Brooke was often frustrated with the Prime Minister&#x27;s habits and working methods, his abuse of generals and constant meddling in strategic matters. At the same time Brooke greatly admired Churchill for the way he inspired the Allied cause and for the way he bore the heavy burden of war leadership. In one typical passage in Brooke&#x27;s war diaries Churchill is described as a &quot;genius mixed with an astonishing lack of vision – he is quite the most difficult man to work with that I have ever struck but I should not have missed the chance of working with him for anything on earth!&quot;

Shortly after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Churchill and his senior military staff used the Arcadia Conference in Washington to decide the general strategy for the war. The American Army Chief of Staff George C. Marshall came up with the idea of a Combined Chiefs of Staff that would make final military decisions (subject to approval by President Roosevelt and Churchill). Marshall sold it to Roosevelt and together the two sold the idea to Churchill. Churchill&#x27;s military aides were much less favourable, and Brooke was strongly opposed. However, Brooke was left behind in London to handle the daily details of running the British war effort, and was not consulted. The combined board was permanently stationed in Washington, where Field Marshal Dill represented the British half. The Combined Board did have thirteen in-person full meetings, which Brooke attended.

When Churchill&#x27;s many fanciful strategic ideas collided with sound military strategy it was only Brooke on the Chiefs of Staff Committee who was able to stand up to the Prime Minister. Churchill said about Brooke: &quot;When I thump the table and push my face towards him what does he do? Thumps the table harder and glares back at me. I know these Brookes – stiff-necked Ulstermen and there&#x27;s no one worse to deal with than that!&quot; It has been claimed that part of Churchill&#x27;s greatness was that he appointed Brooke as CIGS and kept him for the whole war.

Brooke was particularly annoyed by Churchill&#x27;s idea of capturing the northern tip of Sumatra. But in some cases Brooke did not see the political dimension of strategy as the Prime Minister did. The CIGS was sceptical about the British intervention in the Greek Civil War in late 1944 (during the &quot;Dekemvriana&quot;), believing this was an operation which would drain troops from the central front in Germany. But at this stage the war was practically won and Churchill saw the possibility of preventing Greece from becoming a communist state.

The balance of the Chiefs of Staff Committee was tilted in October 1943 when Admiral Sir Dudley Pound, Brooke&#x27;s predecessor as chairman, retired as a result of poor health and Admiral Sir Andrew Cunningham succeeded Pound as First Sea Lord and naval representative on the Chiefs of Staff Committee. Brooke as a consequence got a firm ally in his arguments with Churchill. This was reflected in the most serious clash between the Prime Minister and the Chiefs of Staff, regarding the British preparations for final stages of the Pacific War. Brooke and the rest of the Chiefs of Staff wanted to build up the forces in Australia while Churchill preferred to use India as a base for the British effort. It was an issue over which the Chiefs of Staff were prepared to resign, but in the end a compromise was reached.

Despite their many disagreements Brooke and Churchill held an affection for each other. After one fierce clash Churchill told his chief of staff and military adviser, General Sir Hastings Ismay, that he did not think he could continue to work any longer with Brooke because &quot;he hates me. I can see hatred looking from his eyes.&quot; Brooke responded to Ismay: &quot;Hate him? I don&#x27;t hate him. I love him. But the first time I tell him that I agree with him when I don&#x27;t will be the time to get rid of me, for then I can be no more use to him.&quot; When Churchill was told this he murmured, &quot;Dear Brookie.&quot;

The partnership between Brooke and Churchill was a very successful one. According to historian Max Hastings, their partnership &quot;created the most efficient machine for the higher direction of the war possessed by any combatant nation, even if its judgments were sometimes flawed and its ability to enforce its wishes increasingly constrained&quot;.

Brooke&#x27;s diary entry for 10 September 1944 is particularly revealing of his ambivalent relationship with Churchill:

==War diaries==
Brooke kept a diary during the whole of the Second World War. Originally intended for his wife, Benita, the diaries were later expanded on by Lord Alanbrooke, as he had become, in the 1950s. They contain descriptions on the day-to-day running of the British war effort (including some indiscreet references to top secret interceptions of German radio traffic), Brooke&#x27;s thoughts on strategy, as well as frequent anecdotes from the many meetings he had with the Allied leadership during the war.

The diaries have become famous mostly because of the frequent remarks on and criticisms of Churchill. Although the diaries contain passages expressing admiration of Churchill, they also served as a vent for Brooke&#x27;s frustration with working with the Prime Minister. The diaries also give sharp opinions on several of the top Allied leaders. The American generals Eisenhower and Marshall, for example, are described as poor strategists and Field Marshal Sir Harold Alexander as unintelligent. Among the few individuals of whom Brooke seems to have kept consistently positive opinions, from a military standpoint, were General of the Army Douglas MacArthur, Field Marshal Sir John Dill, and Joseph Stalin. Brooke admired Stalin for his quick brain and grasp of military strategy. Otherwise he had no illusions about the man, describing Stalin thus: &quot;He has got an unpleasantly cold, crafty, dead face, and whenever I look at him I can imagine his sending off people to their doom without ever turning a hair.&quot;

The first (abridged and censored) version published in the 1950s was edited by the distinguished historian Sir Arthur Bryant: 1957 (&quot;The Turn of the Tide&quot;) and 1959 (&quot;Triumph in the West&quot;). Originally Brooke intended that the diaries were never to be published but one reason that he changed his mind was the lack of credit to him and the Chiefs of Staff in Churchill&#x27;s own war memoirs, which essentially presented their ideas and innovations as the Prime Minister&#x27;s own. Although censorship and libel laws accounted for numerous suppressions of what Brooke had originally written concerning persons who were still alive, the Bryant books became controversial even in their truncated state, mainly as a result of the comments on Churchill, Marshall, Eisenhower, Gort, and others. Churchill himself did not appreciate the books. In 1952, both Churchill and Beaverbrook threatened legal action against a biography of Stanley Baldwin by G. M. Young, and a settlement was reached by lawyer Arnold Goodman to remove the offending sentences. Publisher Rupert Hart-Davis had the &quot;hideously expensive&quot; job of removing and replacing seven leaves from 7,580 copies of the biography. Diary entries also refer to intercepts of German signals decrypted at Bletchley Park (which Brooke visited twice), which were secret until 1974.

In 2001, Alex Danchev of Keele University and Daniel Todman of Cambridge University published an unexpurgated version of the Brooke Diaries including original critical remarks that Brooke made at various times that had been suppressed in the Bryant versions. Danchev and Todman also criticised Bryant&#x27;s editing, but this is balanced by an assessment by Dr Christopher Harmon, advisor to the Churchill Centre and Professor at the US Marine Corps University. Bryant was inhibited by Lord Alanbrooke&#x27;s desire not to publish in full his critical diary entries about people who were still alive when Bryant&#x27;s books were published.

==Post-war career==
Following the Second World War and his retirement from the regular army, Lord Alanbrooke, as he was now, who could have chosen almost any honorary position he wanted, chose to be the Colonel Commandant of the Honourable Artillery Company. He held this position from 1946 to 1954. In addition, he served on the boards of several companies, both in industry and in banking. He was director of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, the Midland Bank, the National Discount Company and the Belfast Banking Company. Alanbrooke was particularly fond of being a director of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company where he served for eleven years from 1948.

According to historian Andrew Sangster, there was a reason for his choice to work in the private sector - i.e. not to stay in the military. Lord Alanbrooke ended the Second World War not well off: he had to move from his house and publishing his memoirs helped because such books sold well at that time.

==Marriages and children==
Lord Alanbrooke was married twice. After six years of engagement, in 1914 he married Jane Richardson, daughter of Colonel John Mervyn Ashdall Carleton Richardson, a neighbour who lived at Rossfad, County Fermanagh, Ulster. Six days into their honeymoon, the then Alan Brooke was recalled to active duty when the First World War started. The couple had one daughter and one son:

* The Hon Rosemary Brooke (25 October 1918 – 2016)
* Thomas Brooke, 2nd Viscount Alanbrooke (9 January 1920 – 19 December 1972)

Jane Brooke died of complications from an operation to repair a broken vertebra following a car accident in 1925 in which her husband was at the steering wheel. Jane&#x27;s death deeply affected Brooke, who blamed himself for the accident and felt guilt over it for the rest of his life. 

Brooke married secondly Benita Lees (1892–1968), daughter of Sir Harold Pelly, 4th Baronet and the widow of Sir Thomas Lees, 2nd Baronet, in 1929. The marriage was very happy for the uxorious Brooke. They too had a daughter and a son:

* The Hon Kathleen Benita Brooke (23 January 1931 – 20 November 1961)
* Alan Victor Harold Brooke, 3rd and last Viscount Alanbrooke (24 November 1932 – 10 January 2018)

During the war the couple lived in Hartley Wintney in Hampshire. After the war, their financial situation forced the couple to move into the gardener&#x27;s cottage of their former home, where they lived for the rest of their lives. Their last years were darkened by the death of their daughter, Kathleen, in a riding accident in 1961.

==Interests==
Lord Alanbrooke had a love of nature. Hunting and fishing were among his great interests. His foremost passion, however, was birds. He was a noted ornithologist, especially in bird photography. In 1944, he ordered the RAF not to use an island off the coast of Norfolk as a bombing range because of its significance to nesting roseate terns. He was president of the Zoological Society of London between 1950 and 1954, and vice-president of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) between 1949 and 1961. He was an honorary member of the Royal Photographic Society from February 1954 until his death.

==Death==
On 17 June 1963, Lord Alanbrooke suffered a heart attack and died quietly in his bed with his wife beside him. The same day, he had been due to attend the Garter Service in St George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor. Nine days later he was given a funeral in Windsor and buried in St Mary&#x27;s Church, Hartley Wintney. He was succeeded in the viscountcy and barony by his elder son, Thomas.

==Memorials==
Welbeck College and the Duke of York&#x27;s Royal Military School named one of their houses after him.

Several military barracks are named after him, such as Alanbrooke Barracks in Paderborn Garrison, Germany, and Alanbrooke Barracks in Topcliffe, North Yorkshire.

==In popular culture==
Brooke was portrayed in the television drama &quot;Churchill and the Generals&quot; by Eric Porter and in the film &quot;Churchill&quot; by Danny Webb.

He is memorably described by the narrator in Anthony Powell&#x27;s novel, &quot;The Military Philosophers&quot; (the 9th volume in his roman-fleuve, &quot;A Dance to the Music of Time&quot;), who refers to:...the hurricane-like imminence of a thickset general, obviously of high rank, wearing enormous horn-rimmed spectacles. He had just burst from a flagged staff-car almost before it had drawn up by the kerb. Now he tore up the steps of the building at the charge, exploding through the inner door into the hall. An extraordinary current of physical energy, almost of electricity, suddenly pervaded the place. I could feel it stabbing through me. This was the CIGS.

<text>Thaumaturgy () is the practical application of magic to effect change in the physical world. Historically, thaumaturgy has been associated with the manipulation of natural forces, the creation of wonders, and the performance of magical feats through esoteric knowledge and ritual practice. Unlike theurgy, which focuses on invoking divine powers, thaumaturgy is more concerned with utilizing occult principles to achieve specific outcomes, often in a tangible and observable manner. It is sometimes translated into English as wonderworking.

This concept has evolved from its ancient roots in magical traditions to its incorporation into modern Western esotericism. Thaumaturgy has been practiced by individuals seeking to exert influence over the material world through both subtle and overt magical means. It has played a significant role in the development of magical systems, particularly those that emphasize the practical aspects of esoteric work.

In modern times, thaumaturgy continues to be a subject of interest within the broader field of occultism, where it is studied and practiced as part of a larger system of magical knowledge. Its principles are often applied in conjunction with other forms of esoteric practice, such as alchemy and Hermeticism, to achieve a deeper understanding and mastery of the forces that govern the natural and supernatural worlds.

Thaumaturgy is defined as the &quot;science&quot; or &quot;physics&quot; of magic by Isaac Bonewits in his 1971 book &quot;Real Magic&quot;. A practitioner of thaumaturgy is a &quot;thaumaturge&quot;, &quot;thaumaturgist&quot;, &quot;thaumaturgus&quot;, &quot;miracle worker&quot;, or &quot;wonderworker&quot;.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;thaumaturgy&quot; derives from Greek &quot;thaûma&quot;, meaning &quot;miracle&quot; or &quot;marvel&quot; (final &quot;t&quot; from genitive &quot;thaûmatos&quot;) and &quot;érgon&quot;, meaning &quot;work&quot;. In the 16th century, the word &quot;thaumaturgy&quot; entered the English language meaning miraculous or magical powers. The word was first anglicized and used in the magical sense in John Dee&#x27;s book &quot;The Mathematicall Praeface to Elements of Geometrie of Euclid of Megara&quot; (1570). He mentions an &quot;art mathematical&quot; called &quot;thaumaturgy... which giveth certain order to make strange works, of the sense to be perceived and of men greatly to be wondered at&quot;.

== Historical development ==
=== Ancient roots ===
The origins of thaumaturgy can be traced back to ancient civilizations where magical practices were integral to both religious rituals and daily life. In ancient Egypt, priests were often regarded as thaumaturges, wielding their knowledge of rituals and incantations to influence natural and supernatural forces. These practices were aimed at protecting the Pharaoh, ensuring a successful harvest, or even controlling the weather. Similarly, in ancient Greece, certain figures were believed to possess the ability to perform miraculous feats, often attributed to their deep understanding of the mysteries of the gods and nature. This blending of religious and magical practices laid the groundwork for what would later be recognized as thaumaturgy in Western esotericism.

In Greek writings, the term &quot;thaumaturge&quot; also referred to several Christian saints. In this context, the word is usually translated into English as &#x27;wonderworker&#x27;. Notable early Christian thaumaturges include Gregory Thaumaturgus (c. 213–270), Saint Menas of Egypt (285–c. 309), Saint Nicholas (270–343), and Philomena ( 300 (?)).

=== Medieval and Renaissance Europe ===
During the medieval period, thaumaturgy evolved within the context of Christian mysticism and early scientific thought. The medieval understanding of thaumaturgy was closely linked to the idea of miracles, with saints and holy men often credited with thaumaturgic powers. The seventeenth-century Irish Franciscan editor John Colgan called the three early Irish saints, Patrick, Brigid, and Columba, thaumaturges in his &quot;Acta Triadis Thaumaturgae&quot; (Louvain, 1647). Later notable medieval Christian thaumaturges include Anthony of Padua (1195–1231) and the bishop of Fiesole, Andrew Corsini of the Carmelites (1302–1373), who was called a thaumaturge during his lifetime. This period also saw the development of grimoires—manuals for magical practices—where rituals and spells were documented, often blending Christian and pagan traditions.

In the Renaissance, the concept of thaumaturgy expanded as scholars like John Dee explored the intersections between magic, science, and religion. Dee&#x27;s &quot;Mathematicall Praeface to Elements of Geometrie of Euclid of Megara&quot; (1570) is one of the earliest English texts to discuss thaumaturgy, describing it as the art of creating &quot;strange works&quot; through a combination of natural and mathematical principles. Dee&#x27;s work reflects the Renaissance pursuit of knowledge that blurred the lines between the magical and the mechanical, as thaumaturges were often seen as early scientists who harnessed the hidden powers of nature.

In Dee&#x27;s time, &quot;the Mathematicks&quot; referred not merely to the abstract computations associated with the term today, but to physical mechanical devices which employed mathematical principles in their design. These devices, operated by means of compressed air, springs, strings, pulleys or levers, were seen by unsophisticated people (who did not understand their working principles) as magical devices which could only have been made with the aid of demons and devils.

By building such mechanical devices, Dee earned a reputation as a conjurer &quot;dreaded&quot; by neighborhood children. He complained of this assessment in his &quot;Mathematicall Praeface&quot;:

Notable Renaissance and Age of Enlightenment Christian thaumaturges of the period include Gerard Majella (1726–1755), Ambrose of Optina (1812–1891), and John of Kronstadt (1829–1908).

=== Incorporation into modern esotericism ===
The transition into modern esotericism saw thaumaturgy taking on a more structured role within various magical systems, particularly those developed in the 18th and 19th centuries. In Hermeticism and the Western occult tradition, thaumaturgy was often practiced alongside alchemy and theurgy, with a focus on manipulating the material world through ritual and symbolic action. The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, a prominent magical order founded in the late 19th century, incorporated thaumaturgy into its curriculum, emphasizing the importance of both theory and practice in the mastery of magical arts.

Thaumaturgy&#x27;s role in modern esotericism also intersects with the rise of ceremonial magic, where it is often employed to achieve specific, practical outcomes—ranging from healing to the invocation of spirits. Contemporary magicians continue to explore and adapt thaumaturgic practices, often drawing from a wide range of historical and cultural sources to create eclectic and personalized systems of magic.

==Core principles and practices==

===Principles of sympathy and contagion===
Thaumaturgy is often governed by two key magical principles: the Principle of Sympathy and the Principle of Contagion. These principles are foundational in understanding how thaumaturges influence the physical world through magical means. The Principle of Sympathy operates on the idea that &quot;like affects like&quot;, meaning that objects or symbols that resemble each other can influence each other. For example, a miniature representation of a desired outcome, such as a model of a bridge, could be used in a ritual to ensure the successful construction of an actual bridge. The Principle of Contagion, on the other hand, is based on the belief that objects that were once in contact continue to influence each other even after they are separated. This principle is often employed in the use of personal items, such as hair or clothing, in rituals to affect the person to whom those items belong.

These principles are not unique to thaumaturgy but are integral to many forms of magic across cultures. However, in the context of thaumaturgy, they are particularly important because they provide a theoretical framework for understanding how magical actions can produce tangible results in the material world. This focus on practical outcomes distinguishes thaumaturgy from other forms of magic that may be more concerned with spiritual or symbolic meanings.

===Tools and rituals===
Thaumaturgical practices often involve the use of specific tools and rituals designed to channel and direct magical energy. Common tools include wands, staffs, talismans, and ritual knives, each of which serves a particular purpose in the practice of magic. For instance, a wand might be used to direct energy during a ritual, while a talisman could serve as a focal point for the thaumaturge&#x27;s intent. The creation and consecration of these tools are themselves ritualized processes, often requiring specific materials and astrological timing to ensure their effectiveness.

Rituals in thaumaturgy are typically elaborate and may involve the recitation of incantations, the drawing of protective circles, and the invocation of spirits or deities. These rituals are designed to create a controlled environment in which the thaumaturge can manipulate natural forces according to their will. The complexity of these rituals varies depending on the desired outcome, with more significant or ambitious goals requiring more intricate and time-consuming procedures.

===Energy manipulation===
At the heart of thaumaturgy is the metaphor of energy manipulation. Thaumaturges believe that the world is filled with various forms of energy that can be harnessed and directed through magical practices. This energy is often conceptualized as a natural force that permeates the universe, and through the use of specific techniques, thaumaturges believe that they can influence this energy to bring about desired changes in the physical world.

Energy manipulation in thaumaturgy involves both drawing energy from the surrounding environment and directing it toward a specific goal. This process often requires a deep understanding of the natural world, as well as the ability to focus and control one&#x27;s own mental and spiritual energies. In many traditions, this energy is also linked to the practitioner&#x27;s life force, meaning that the act of performing thaumaturgy can be physically and spiritually taxing. As a result, practitioners often undergo rigorous training and preparation to build their capacity to manipulate energy effectively and safely.

==In esoteric traditions==

===Hermetic Qabalah===
In Hermetic Qabalah, thaumaturgy occupies a significant role as it involves the practical application of mystical principles to influence the physical world. This tradition is deeply rooted in the concept of correspondences, where different elements of the cosmos are seen as interconnected. In the Hermetic tradition, a thaumaturge seeks to manipulate these correspondences to bring about desired changes. The sephiroth on the Tree of Life serve as a map for these interactions, with specific rituals and symbols corresponding to different sephiroth and their associated powers. For example, a ritual focusing on Yesod (the sephirah of the Moon) might involve elements such as silver, the color white, and the invocation of lunar deities to influence matters of intuition, dreams, or the subconscious mind.

The manipulation of these correspondences through ritual is not just symbolic but is believed to produce real effects in the material world. Practitioners use complex rituals that might include the use of sacred geometry, invocations, and the creation of talismans. These practices are believed to align the practitioner with the forces they wish to control, creating a sympathetic connection that enables them to direct these forces effectively. Aleister Crowley&#x27;s &quot;Magick (Book 4)&quot; provides an extensive discussion on the use of ritual tools such as the wand, cup, and sword, each of which corresponds to different elements and powers within the Qabalistic system, emphasizing the practical aspect of these tools in thaumaturgic practices.

===Alchemy and thaumaturgy===
Alchemy and thaumaturgy are often intertwined, particularly in the context of spiritual transformation and the pursuit of enlightenment. Alchemy, with its focus on the transmutation of base metals into gold and the quest for the philosopher&#x27;s stone, can be seen as a form of thaumaturgy where the practitioner seeks to transform not just physical substances but also the self. This process, known as the Great Work, involves the purification and refinement of both matter and spirit. Thaumaturgy comes into play as the practical aspect of alchemy, where rituals, symbols, and substances are used to facilitate these transformations.

The alchemical process is heavily laden with symbolic meanings, with each stage representing a different phase of transformation. The stages of &quot;nigredo&quot; (blackening), &quot;albedo&quot; (whitening), &quot;citrinitas&quot; (yellowing), and &quot;rubedo&quot; (reddening) correspond not only to physical changes in the material being worked on but also to stages of spiritual purification and enlightenment. Thaumaturgy, in this context, is the application of these principles to achieve tangible results, whether in the form of creating alchemical elixirs, talismans, or achieving spiritual goals. Crowley also elaborates on these alchemical principles in &quot;Magick (Book 4)&quot;, particularly in his discussions on the symbolic and practical uses of alchemical symbols and processes within magical rituals.

===Other esoteric systems===
Thaumaturgy also plays a role in various other esoteric systems, where it is often viewed as a means of bridging the gap between the mundane and the divine. In Theosophy, for example, thaumaturgy is seen as part of the esoteric knowledge that allows practitioners to manipulate spiritual and material forces. Theosophical teachings emphasize the unity of all life and the interconnection of the cosmos, with thaumaturgy being a practical tool for engaging with these truths. Rituals and meditative practices are used to align the practitioner&#x27;s will with higher spiritual forces, enabling them to effect change in the physical world.

In Rosicrucianism, thaumaturgy is similarly regarded as a method of spiritual practice that leads to the mastery of natural and spiritual laws. Rosicrucians believe that through the study of nature and the application of esoteric principles, one can achieve a deep understanding of the cosmos and develop the ability to influence it. This includes the use of rituals, symbols, and sacred texts to bring about spiritual growth and material success.

In the introduction of his translation of the &quot;Spiritual Powers (神通 &quot;Jinzū&quot;)&quot; chapter of Dōgen&#x27;s &quot;Shōbōgenzō&quot;, Carl Bielefeldt refers to the powers developed by adepts of Esoteric Buddhism as belonging to the &quot;thaumaturgical tradition&quot;. These powers, known as siddhi or abhijñā, were ascribed to the Buddha and subsequent disciples. Legendary monks like Bodhidharma, Upagupta, Padmasambhava, and others were depicted in popular legends and hagiographical accounts as wielding various supernatural powers.

==Misconceptions and modern interpretations==

===Distinction from theurgy===
A common misconception about thaumaturgy is its conflation with theurgy. While both involve the practice of magic, they serve distinct purposes and operate on different principles. Theurgy is primarily concerned with invoking divine or spiritual beings to achieve union with the divine, often for purposes of spiritual ascent or enlightenment. Thaumaturgy, on the other hand, focuses on the manipulation of natural forces to produce tangible effects in the physical world. This distinction is crucial in understanding the differing objectives of these practices: theurgy is inherently religious and mystical, while thaumaturgy is more pragmatic and results-oriented.

Aleister Crowley, in his &quot;Magick (Book 4)&quot;, emphasizes the importance of understanding these differences, noting that while theurgic practices seek to align the practitioner with divine will, thaumaturgy allows the practitioner to exert their will over the material world through the application of esoteric knowledge and ritual.

<text>The Parliament of 1614 was the second Parliament of England of the reign of James VI and I and sat between 5 April and 7 June 1614. Lasting only two months and two days, it saw no bills pass and was not even regarded as a parliament by contemporaries. However, for its failure it has been known to posterity as the Addled Parliament.

James had struggled with debt ever since he came to the English throne. The failure of the Blessed Parliament of 1604–1611 to, in its seven-year sitting, either rescue James from his mounting debt or allow the king to unite his two kingdoms had left him bitter with the body. The four-year hiatus between parliaments saw the royal debt and deficit grow further, in spite of the best efforts of Treasurer Lord Salisbury. The failure of the last and most lucrative financial expedient of the period, a foreign dowry from the marriage of his heir-apparent, finally convinced James to recall Parliament in early 1614.

The parliament got off to a bad start, with poor choices made for the king&#x27;s representatives in Parliament. Rumours of conspiracies to manage Parliament (the &quot;undertaking&quot;) or to pack it with easily controlled members, though not based in fact, spread quickly. The spreading of that rumour and the ultimate failure of Parliament have been generally attributed to the scheming of the crypto-Catholic Earl of Northampton, but that allegation has met with some recent skepticism. Parliament opened on 5 April and, despite the king&#x27;s wishes it would be a &quot;Parliament of Love&quot;, flung itself immediately into the controversy over the conspiracies, which split Parliament and led to the exclusion of one alleged packer. However, by late April, Parliament had moved on to a familiar controversy, that of impositions. The House of Commons were pitted against the House of Lords, culminating in a controversy over an unrestrained speech by one prelate.

James grew impatient with the parliamentary proceedings. He issued an ultimatum to Parliament, which treated it irreverently. Insult was added to injury by belligerent and supposedly-threatening attacks on him from the Commons. On the advice of Northampton, James dissolved Parliament on 7 June and had four Members of Parliament (MPs) sent to the Tower of London. James devised new financial expedients to settle his still-growing debt, with little success. Historiographically, historians are divided between the Whiggish view of the parliament as anticipating the constitutional disputes of future parliaments and the revisionist view of it as a conflict primarily concerned with James&#x27;s finances.

==Background==
James VI and I (1566–1625) ascended to the Scottish throne on 24 July 1567, and subsequently to the English and Irish throne on 24 March 1603, becoming the first king to reign over both kingdoms. James inherited, with the latter throne, a national debt to the amount of £300,000, a sum that only increased during his reign. By 1608, it stood at £1 million. During his predecessor Elizabeth I&#x27;s reign, the inward revenue of the crown had steadily fallen; taxes from customs and land were consistently undervalued and the parliamentary subsidies steadily shrank. It did not help that James reigned as &quot;one of the most extravagant kings&quot; in English history. In peace, Elizabeth&#x27;s yearly expenditure never rose above £300,000; almost immediately after James took the throne, it was at £400,000. James had instituted various extra-parliamentary plans to recuperate this lost income, but these drew controversy from Parliament, and James still wanted money. Moreover, James was keen to not be &quot;a husband to two wives&quot; as king, and to unite his crowns as one kingdom of Great Britain; as his slogan went: &quot;one king, one people, and one law&quot;. The first parliament of his reign, also known as the Blessed Parliament, was called in 1604; it took seven years, with proceedings held through five sessions, before James dissolved it, ending unsatisfactorily for both king and Parliament. In the first session, it came to light that many members of the Commons feared James&#x27;s proposed unification would lead to the dissolution of the English Common Law system. Though many prominent politicians publicly praised the idea of unification and MPs promptly accepted a commission to investigate the union, James&#x27;s proposed adoption of the title &quot;king of Great Britain&quot; was rejected outright. Between the first and second sessions, in October 1604, James assumed this title by proclamation, controversially circumventing Parliament. Unification was not brought up at the second session, in hopes of assuaging outrage, but discussions of the plans in the third session were exclusively negative; as Scottish historian Jenny Wormald put it, &quot;James&#x27;s union was killed by this parliament&quot;. Unification was quietly dropped from discussion in the fourth and fifth sessions.

During the Blessed Parliament, Parliament&#x27;s own aims saw similar disappointment; James rebuffed the proposed institution of Puritan ecclesiastical reforms, and failed to address two unpopular royal rights, purveyance and wardship. In the second session, Parliament granted the king a subsidy of £400,000, keen to exhibit royal support in the wake of the Gunpowder Plot, but thanks to the reduction of these subsidies under Elizabeth, this was rather less than the king desired. After a three-year delay between sessions due to plague, the fourth session was called in February 1610, and was dominated by financial discussion. Lord High Treasurer, Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury proposed the Great Contract: a financial plan wherein Parliament would grant the Crown £600,000 immediately (to pay off its debts) and an annual stipend of £200,000 thereafter; in return, the king was to abolish ten feudal dues, among them, purveyance. After much haggling, in which wardship was added to the abolished dues, the session adjourned on a supportive note. However, when the next session began, support had cooled. Parliament refused to give an annual stipend unless James abolished impositions as well. Parliament did give the king an immediate subsidy, but the proposed £600,000 was reduced to a mere £100,000. By 6 November 1610, James demanded the other £500,000 and conditioned that, if impositions were to be abolished, Parliament would have to supply him with another equally lucrative income source. Parliament was outraged, and the Contract was abandoned three days later. Though both Salisbury and James made conciliatory gestures in hopes of securing any more financial support from Parliament, James grew impatient. On 31 December 1610, James publicly proclaimed the dissolution of the Parliament. James&#x27;s first parliament had ended on a bitter note; &quot;your greatest error&quot;, he chastised Salisbury, &quot;hath been that ye ever expected to draw honey out of gall.&quot;

After this, James was not keen to call another Parliament. However, without Parliament to raise taxes, the treasury was forced to find new ways to raise money. In 1611, the City of London loaned the Crown £100,000; £60,000 was extracted from the King of France over debts accumulated in the reign of Henry IV; honours were sold to wealthy gentlemen, raising £90,000; a forced loan was levied on nearly 10,000 people. Yet, after the death of Treasurer Salisbury in 1612, England&#x27;s finances still remained destitute, with a debt of £500,000 and annual deficit of £160,000. However, James&#x27;s principal fiscal expedient was to be the marriage of his heir-apparent, Henry, Prince of Wales, for which he expected a sizeable dowry, not to mention a foreign ally. James went into talks with several Catholic countries but, in late 1612, aged 18, Henry contracted typhoid and abruptly died; Prince Charles, newly heir-apparent at age 12, took his place in the negotiations. Negotiations were going most promisingly in France, where a marriage of Prince Charles to the 6-year-old Princess Christine of France promised a healthy sum of £240,000, almost halving James&#x27;s debt. However, by early 1614, France&#x27;s internal religious strife had intensified to such a point that civil war seemed imminent, so negotiations stalled on the French side; James grew impatient. James&#x27;s financial insecurity had only worsened in this time, the debt now at £680,000 and the deficit, £200,000. Conspicuous consumption had raised yearly expenditure to an unsustainable £522,000. A group of advisors, led by the Earls of Suffolk and Pembroke, encouraged the king to call a parliament to raise funds, convincing James &quot;that&quot;—as he later put it—&quot;my subjects did not hate me, which I know I had not deserved.&quot; Suffolk and Pembroke, though not optimistic about the parliament, encouraged James as they held what was then the general view in the Privy Council: that a Spanish or French alliance must be avoided, as to avoid strengthening the power of their allies in Court, the Scots. Northampton stringently opposed this summoning, but, in 1614, James reluctantly summoned another parliament. Writs of election were issued on 19 February that year.

==Parliament==

===Preparations===
The Privy Council as a whole was not optimistic about the upcoming parliament. Two of the king&#x27;s closest advisors were unavailable: Salisbury was dead and the 74-year-old Northampton was ill. Even Suffolk and Pembroke were clueless of any way to prevent Parliament from bringing up thorny issues such as impositions again. However, two Councillors were to provide advice to the king over his new parliament, which would prove significant. Attorney General Sir Francis Bacon, who had been among the most vocal in favour of calling Parliament, publicly blamed Salisbury entirely for the failure of the previous Parliament; he held a private grudge against the treasurer, suspecting he had undermined his early career. He asserted that Salisbury&#x27;s deal-making with Parliament had been the root of the king&#x27;s failure, and that James should instead approach Parliament as their king, rather than some merchant, and therefore request subsidies on the basis of the Commons&#x27; goodwill to their ruler. Bacon added to this that the king should employ patronage to win over the men of Parliament to his side. Sir Henry Neville offered advice to the king on how to warm relations with Parliament, which he accepted amiably, but Neville&#x27;s more portentous offer was that of an &quot;undertaking&quot;, whereby Neville and a group of &quot;patriots&quot; would arrange to manage the Parliament in James&#x27;s favour, in return for the office of Secretary of State. James rejected the undertaking derisively, and no such conspiracy was ever arranged, but rumours of its actual occurrence spread quickly in the lead up to Parliament.

MPs later accused James of trying to the parliament. Indeed, Bacon had plainly advised the king on the &quot;placing of persons well-affected and discreet&quot; in Parliament, and James had unapologetically packed the Irish Parliament the previous year. An atypically large number of Crown officials found themselves in this parliament; four Privy Councillors had seats in the Commons, alongside plenty of Crown lawyers. Though there is no evidence that the Crown sought to pack Parliament with easily controlled and pacified MPs, James certainly promoted the election of those sympathetic to the Crown&#x27;s ambitions. The Privy Council, in actuality, seemed more apathetic with regard to appointing useful parliamentary officials. Few of the expected preparations were made. After some Byzantine wrangling in which another better-qualified candidate was dropped, Ranulph Crewe, judge and MP for the government-controlled borough of Saltash, was chosen at the last minute to be the Speaker of the House of Commons. This was a surprising choice: Crewe&#x27;s previous experience in Parliament was limited to a short stint as an MP in 1597–98 and an appearance on two minor legal counsels; his legal career was no more impressive. Crewe&#x27;s inexperience at dealing with rowdy MPs was no doubt among the factors that allowed Parliament to descend into disorder, as it rapidly did. James&#x27;s most senior representative in the House of Commons, Ralph Winwood, Secretary of State, was announced similarly late. Though a spirited official and zealous Puritan, Winwood had no parliamentary experience at all and was a terse, unlikable figure. Though sometimes caricatured as juvenile, and thus prone to passionate outbursts, the new House of Commons as a whole was not especially young or inexperienced; it was the inexperience of his most important officials and advisors that was to damage the king.

===Opening and conspiracies===

Parliament opened on 5 April 1614. James opened the Parliament with the wish that it would come to be known as the &quot;Parliament of Love&quot;, and that king and Parliament would go on in harmony and understanding. His opening speech was divided into three sections: the first (), decrying the growth of Catholicism and imploring the harsher enforcement of existing laws; the second (), assuring Parliament of the security of the Stuart dynasty; and the third (), emphasising his financial necessity, and his aim not to bargain with Parliament any longer, but rather to ask of their goodwill in supplying funds. All but the religious aspect of this speech bore the unmistakable stamp of Bacon&#x27;s influence. Notably missing from the speech was any promise of compromise or reformation from the king. In the same speech, he stringently denied any sanction of Neville&#x27;s undertaking, but speculation on the conspiracy was already widespread. Neville&#x27;s plan had, by now, been twisted into a far-reaching conspiracy of the king&#x27;s court. English diplomat Sir Thomas Roe was the first to allege that the rumours were promulgated by the Earl of Northampton&#x27;s crypto-Catholic faction, who wanted the king to instead look for funds in a marital alliance with Catholic Spain, thus favouring Parliament&#x27;s failure. The idea that Northampton masterminded many of the factors in the failure of this parliament has been accepted by most later historians, but has met with the notable rejection of one Northampton biographer, Linda Levy Peck.

Suspicions only compounded as Parliament proceeded, with the revelation that the king had corresponded with influential subjects in the hopes of securing the election of the sympathetic. The House of Commons was divided between those who accepted the conspiracy and those who rejected it. The Commons thus immediately set about investigating the preceding elections for signs of misconduct. Though little beyond this was established, it was found that the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Sir Thomas Parry, had swayed the election in Stockbridge. For a brief period, this investigation dominated the Commons: Parry was suspended from the House and, passingly, from his Chancellorship. For many in Parliament, this seemed evidence enough that the king&#x27;s officials had attempted to pack Parliament. Simultaneously, a committee to inquire into the alleged undertaking was launched, though this proved less fruitful. The committee&#x27;s chairman returned on 2 May; he spoke confusingly, but concluded against the existence of any undertaking. However, parliamentary provocateur John Hoskins demanded further investigation, which the House accepted. On 14 May, the inquiry ended; after six weeks of Parliament, rumours of an undertaking had conclusively been dismissed. However, by the end of this controversy, resentment against the undertakers had evaporated. Neville was never suspended for his part, but rather ultimately met with commendation of Parliament. His advice was seen as part of an effort to allow the king to remedy their grievances. The packers, on the other hand, never gained the sympathy of Parliament, with their efforts invariably seen as attempts to undermine the parliamentary process.

===Controversy over impositions===

The dispute over the alleged packing and undertaking split the House, but it was not this that would cause the parliament&#x27;s ultimate failure. As early as 19 April, letter writer John Chamberlain communicated that &quot;the great clamor against undertakers [was] well quieted&quot;, and the Commons were occupied with a familiar controversy: impositions. Parliament adjourned on 20 April for Easter, reconvening on 2 May. Two days later on 4 May, the king delivered a speech to the Commons, ardent in its defence of the legality of impositions, a fact the king&#x27;s judges had apparently assured him of beyond any doubt. At the end he added portentously that, if he did not receive supply soon, the Commons &quot;must not look for more Parliaments in haste&quot;. However, at the same time, the Commons were united and unflinching in their belief that impositions threatened property law, and that, over impositions, &quot;the liberty of the kingdom is in question.&quot; James was so irritated by one such speech, given by MP Thomas Wentworth, that he had Wentworth imprisoned shortly after Parliament ended. As parliamentary historian Conrad Russell judged it, &quot;both sides were so firmly convinced that they were legally in the right that they never fully absorbed that the other party thought differently.&quot; Any understanding between the two sides was further hampered by the fact that the Commons continued to disregard the king&#x27;s financial troubles, which discouraged the king from giving up such a valuable source of income as impositions.

On 21 May, the Commons asked the Lords for a conference on impositions, anticipating their backing in petitioning the king. After five days of debate, the Lords returned with their formal refusal of such a conference, meeting with the astonishment of many. The Lords had voted 39 to 30 against it, carried by the near unanimity of the Lords Spiritual against this conference. Bishop Richard Neile, who was one of the most vocal opponents of the conference, added insult to injury with a sharp speech condemning the petitioners. The remarks made in this speech, known as the &quot; speech&quot;, have been described by one historian as &quot;the most dangerous words used in the reign [of James I] by any politician.&quot; The Commons refused to conduct any more business until Neile had been punished for this affront. Crewe&#x27;s feeble attempts to argue that parliamentary business must go on revealed his impotence in the face of the angered body. Though the Commons received a tearful apology and retraction from the Bishop on 30 May, they were unsatisfied and doubled down on their demands of disciplinary action. By the end of May, as historian Thomas L. Moir put it, &quot;the temper of the Commons had reached a fever pitch&quot; and leadership had broken down in this intractable atmosphere. No punishment for Neile, however, ever materialised, and the king grew impatient with Parliament.

===James grows impatient===
Parliament was adjourned on 1 June for Ascension Day, reconvening again on 3 June. When the Commons met on this day, they received an ultimatum from the king: unless Parliament agreed to grant him a financial supply soon, he would dissolve Parliament on 9 June. James expected this to shock the Commons into pursuing his aims, but instead, it only entrenched the opposition further into its obstinacy. Many felt this demand was a bluff; the king was still deeply in debt, and parliamentary subsidies seemed his only way out. Instead of effecting any subsidies, the Commons attacked the king mercilessly. His Court, especially its Scottish members, were accused of extravagance, suggesting the king would have no need for impositions or subsidies if not for these subjects. As one member memorably pronounced, James&#x27;s courtiers were &quot;spaniels to the king and wolves to the people&quot;. Possibly encouraged by Northampton, Hoskins grimly hinted that the lives of these Scottish courtiers were in danger, alluding to the ethnic massacre of the Angevins in the Sicilian Vespers; this was communicated to the king as a threat to the lives of himself and of his closest friends, such that he likely feared himself in danger of assassination. Roe was more prescient, if somewhat melodramatic, in his judgement that the impending dissolution would be &quot;the ending, not only of this, but of all Parliaments&quot;. The Commons issued their own ultimatum to James: if he abolished impositions, &quot;wherewith the whole kingdom doth groan&quot;, they would give him financial support.

However, James was in no position to give up such a source of income. While the anti-Northampton faction pleaded with the king to prorogue rather than dissolve Parliament, the king visited Northampton on his deathbed. Northampton persuaded the desperate king to dissolve Parliament. Shortly after James contacted the Spanish Ambassador, the Count of Gondomar, to be assured of Spanish support after his break with Parliament, an assurance which Gondomar happily supplied. James dissolved Parliament on 7 June 1614. The aims of Northampton&#x27;s factions were finally fulfilled, as Northampton saw the end of the Addled Parliament little more than a week before he died. The Parliament had elapsed without any bill being passed with royal assent, and thus was not constitutionally considered a parliament. Contemporaries spoke of it as a &quot;convention&quot;. For John Chamberlain, it seemed &quot;rather a only&quot;. However, for its failure the parliament has universally been known to posterity as the &quot;Addled Parliament&quot;.

==Aftermath==

Following the calamity of this parliament, James became even more determined to avoid the legislative body. He had four of the most belligerent MPs, including Hoskins, sent to the Tower of London for seditious speech. The same was done for Hoskins&#x27;s encouragers a few days later. Royal favour was extended to the king&#x27;s supporters in Parliament, even the Speaker, who received a knighthood and was made a king&#x27;s serjeant. Simultaneously James approached the Spanish Ambassador, confiding much in him, especially regarding his lack of confidence in the body. He reopened negotiations with Spain for a Spanish wife to his heir-apparent, anticipating a dowry of £600,000, enough to cover almost all his debt.

Shortly after the parliament ended, the Privy Council went into talks of calling another, possibly in Scotland, but James surmised this break in Parliament would be final. Indeed, he would not call another parliament for seven years. He only raised a Parliament in 1621 as a last resort to raise money for his son-in-law Elector Palatine Frederick V during the Thirty Years&#x27; War. This interlude was England&#x27;s longest in nearly a century, since that between 1515 and 1523. As one historian has commented, &quot;had it not been for the outbreak of the Thirty Years’ War in 1618, he might have succeeded in avoiding Parliament for the rest of his reign.&quot; In the meantime, still heavily in debt, James set about finding other ways to raise money. &quot;We shall see strange projects for money set on foot, and yet all will not help&quot;, one observer noted. His financial needs were temporarily sated with a benevolence asked of his wealthiest subjects in 1614, raising £65,000; the sale of the Cautionary Towns of Brielle and Vlissingen to the Dutch in 1616, raising £250,000; and in 1617, the request of a loan of £100,000 from the City of London for a Scottish Progress, though the City did not give this in full. The deficit was slowly reduced from 1614 to 1618. Yet, by 1620, his debt had risen to £900,000 and no marriage deal had materialised.

==Historiography==

Victorian Whig historian Samuel Rawson Gardiner, in his monumental history of the lead-up to the Civil War, took the view that the parliament of 1614 was primarily concerned with &quot;higher questions&quot; (i.e. those of a constitutional nature) &quot;which, once , can never drop out of sight&quot;. To this parliament, Gardiner wrote, one can &quot;trace the first dawning of the idea that, in order to preserve the rights of the subject intact, it would be necessary to make some change in the relations between the authority of the Crown and the representatives of the people.&quot; Gardiner&#x27;s judgement of the constitutional import of this assembly has met with the sympathy of some later historians. Moir, in his 1958 monograph on the parliament, held that &quot;the development had begun which led ultimately to parliamentary control of the executive&quot; as early as the exclusion of Parry. Maija Jansson, editor of the 1614 Parliamentary proceedings, wrote in 1988: &quot;[f]ar from being the confused do-nothing assembly of tradition, the English parliament of 1614 addressed thorny constitutional issues and anticipated the concern with procedure and privilege that is evident throughout the sessions of the 1620s.&quot;

This hypothesis regarding the Addled Parliament was criticised by the eminent parliamentary historian Conrad Russell in his 1991 Stenton lecture—entitled &quot;The Addled Parliament of 1614: The Limits of Revision&quot;. From Russell&#x27;s revisionist perspective, the members of Parliament were engaged in a constitutionally conservative battle, aimed at preserving their own rights rather than extending them. The disagreement between Parliament and Crown was not a &quot;battle between rival constitutional ideas&quot; but, as Russell concluded:

<doc id="207150" wikidata="Q919272" url="?curid=207150" title="British Expeditionary Force (World War I)">
<text>The British Expeditionary Force (BEF) was the six divisions the British Army sent to the Western Front during the First World War. Planning for a British Expeditionary Force began with the 1906–1912 Haldane Reforms of the British Army carried out by the Secretary of State for War Richard Haldane following the Second Boer War (1899–1902).

The term &quot;British Expeditionary Force&quot; is often used to refer only to the forces present in France prior to the end of the First Battle of Ypres on 22 November 1914. By the end of 1914—after the battles of Mons, Le Cateau, the Aisne and Ypres—the existent BEF had been almost exhausted, although it helped stop the German advance.An alternative endpoint of the BEF was 26 December 1914, when it was divided into the First and Second Armies (a Third, Fourth and Fifth being created later in the war). &quot;British Expeditionary Force&quot; remained the official name of the British armies in France and Flanders throughout the First World War.

Emperor Wilhelm II of Germany, who was famously dismissive of the BEF, allegedly issued an order on 19 August 1914 to &quot;exterminate ... the treacherous English and walk over General French&#x27;s contemptible little army&quot;. Hence, in later years, the survivors of the regular army dubbed themselves &quot;The Old Contemptibles&quot;. No evidence of any such order being issued by the Kaiser has ever been found.

==Formation==
Under the terms of the Entente Cordiale the United Kingdom had a diplomatic &quot;understanding&quot; with France to counter military aggression from the German Empire in the European continent. Detailed plans had been made for the British Army in the event of war breaking out between those two countries to dispatch an Expeditionary Force to France which consisted of six infantry divisions and five cavalry brigades under the command of General Sir John French to repel any German attack in the West. The BEF was arranged into I Corps, under the command of General Sir Douglas Haig, and II Corps, under the command of General Sir James Grierson, which embarked for France on 15 August 1914. The Expeditionary Force was given the prefix &quot;British&quot; on the arrival of Expeditionary Force A from the Indian Army.

In October 1914, 7th Division arrived in France, forming the basis of III Corps and the cavalry had grown to form the Cavalry Corps of three divisions. By December 1914, the BEF had expanded to such an extent that the First Army and the Second Army were formed.

By the end of 1914, after the battles of Mons, Le Cateau, the Aisne and Ypres, the old regular British Army had suffered massive casualties and lost most of its fighting strength but had managed to help stop the German advance.
===Command structure===

The force was commanded by Field Marshal Sir John French until December 1915, when he was replaced by General Sir Douglas Haig.The BEF&#x27;s Chief of Staff on mobilisation was General Archibald Murray. He was replaced in January 1915 by General William Robertson. Lieutenant-General Launcelot Kiggell then served as Chief of Staff from December 1915 to January 1917 when he was succeeded by Lieutenant-General Herbert Lawrence. The first two Corps were commanded by Haig (I Corps) and Horace Smith-Dorrien (II Corps).

===Kitchener&#x27;s New Army===

As the Regular Army&#x27;s strength declined, the numbers were made up, first by the Territorial Force, then by volunteers from Field Marshal Kitchener&#x27;s New Army. By the end of August 1914, he had raised six new divisions and by March 1915, the number of divisions had increased to 29. The Territorial Force was also expanded, raising second and third line battalions and forming eight new divisions, which supplemented its peacetime strength of 14 divisions. The Third Army was formed in July 1915 and with the influx of troops from Kitchener&#x27;s volunteers and further reorganisation, the Fourth Army and the Reserve Army, became the Fifth Army in 1916.

==Expansion==

===First Army===
The BEF grew from six divisions of British regular army and reserves in 1914, to encompass the British Empire&#x27;s war effort on the Western front in 1918 and some of its allies. Over the course of the war 5,399,563 men served with the BEF, the peak strength being 2,046,901 men.
The First Army was formed on 26 December 1914. Its first commander was Douglas Haig promoted from command of the I Corps. When Haig took over command of the BEF in 1915, the new commander was General Henry Horne. First Army remained in France until the end of the war.

===Second Army===
The Second Army was formed at the same time as the First Army on 26 December 1914. The first commander was Smith–Dorrien promoted from command of the II Corps. In May 1915, Smith–Dorrien was sacked and replaced by General Herbert Plumer. Second Army served in France notably in the Ypres Salient, and later served in Italy between November 1917 and March 1918, then returned to France.

===Third Army===
The Third Army was formed in July 1915, the first commander being General Edmund Allenby promoted after commanding the Cavalry Corps and the V Corps. He was replaced after the battle of Arras in May 1917, by General Julian Byng.

===Fourth Army===
The Fourth Army was formed in February 1916, under the command of General Henry Rawlinson. Confusingly, when the Second Army was sent to Italy late in 1917, the Fourth Army was renumbered the Second Army whilst Rawlinson commanded the Ypres Salient. After Plumer&#x27;s return from Italy Rawlinson spent a period as British Permanent Military Representative at the Supreme War Council at Versailles, but at the start of April he took over the remnants of Gough&#x27;s Fifth Army after its recent defeat. It was renamed the Fourth Army.

===Reserve/Fifth Army===

The Reserve Army was formed in May 1916, under command of General Hubert Gough. Beginning as the Reserve Corps, it was expanded and renamed the Reserve Army and became the Fifth Army in October 1916. Fifth Army suffered heavy losses during the German spring offensive in March 1918. It was reformed again in May 1918 under the command of General William Birdwood.

==Area of operations==

=== 1914 ===
The British Army first engaged the German Army in the Battle of Mons on 23 August 1914, which was part of the greater Battle of the Frontiers. The massed rifle fire of the professional British soldiers inflicted heavy casualties on the Germans who attacked &quot;en masse&quot; over terrain devoid of cover. The British held up the German advance until the evening when they began retiring to a second defensive line in the retreat from Mons during which they were engaged in the Battle of Le Cateau. Following the battle at Le Cateau, the BEF retreated unmolested by the Germans for a further five days, eventually retreating a full 400 km in thirteen days.

The Allied retreat finally ended at the River Marne, where Entente forces prepared to make a stand to defend Paris. This led to the First Battle of the Marne, which was fought from 5 to 10 September 1914. This battle would prove to be a major turning point of the war: it denied the Germans an early victory. From 13 September the First Battle of the Aisne took place, with both sides starting to dig trenches. Then for a three-week period following the development of trench warfare each side gave up frontal assaults and began trying to encircle each other&#x27;s flank. This period became known as the Race to the Sea: the Germans aimed to turn the Allied left flank, and the Allies sought to turn the German right flank.

By the end of First Battle of Ypres both sides started to dig in and trench warfare replaced the manoeuvre warfare that had featured during the Race to the Sea. The continuous trench lines of the Western Front now stretched from the North Sea to the Swiss frontier. The British Army held a small portion of this 400 mile front: from just north of the pre-war Belgium border to the River Somme in France, varying in length from in 1914, to over in 1918, in the area commonly known as Flanders.

===1915===
From the end of 1914, and in 1915, BEF attacks centred around the Ypres Salient. Then in September 1915, six divisions took part in the Battle of Loos – notable for the first use of poison gas by the British.

===1916===
In 1916 the BEF had moved into the Picardy region of France. The Battle of the Somme dominated British military activity for the year. Allied forces attempted to break through the German lines along a front north and south of the River Somme in northern France. On the first day on the Somme the BEF suffered 57,000 casualties. After the war a final tally counted 419,654 British and 204,253 French killed, wounded, or taken prisoner; of the 623,907 total casualties, 146,431 were either killed or missing.

===1917===
In 1917 the BEF&#x27;s attacks moved along the front, they operated in the Pas-de-Calais during the Battle of Arras. They then concentrated in Belgium for the Battle of Messines and the Battle of Passchendale, and ended the year back in the Pas-de-Calais for the Battle of Cambrai.

===1918===
In the spring of 1918 the BEF came under attack both in Flanders and on the Somme during the German Spring Offensive. The Second Battle of the Somme represented the BEF response to the German attack. This in turn began the Hundred Days Offensive, which led to the eventual defeat of the German Army on the western front, after the First and Third armies broke through the Hindenburg Line at the Battle of the Canal du Nord. This led to the final battle of the war in November 1918, the Battle of the Sambre by the First, Third and Fourth Armies and to the capture of Mons, 11 November 1918, by the First Army.

==Empire and Portuguese contribution==
The British Empire responded to the British call for troops for the Western Front and major formations of the British Indian Army, Canadian Army, Australian Army, New Zealand Army and the South African Army all served in France. The BEF also integrated most of the Portuguese Army troops who fought on the Western Front.

===Indian Expeditionary Force A===
In September 1914, the BEF was reinforced by the Indian Expeditionary Force A which eventually formed two corps each of two divisions, the Indian Cavalry Corps and the Indian Infantry Corps. Upon arrival in Marseille on 30 September 1914, only six weeks after the declaration of war, they were moved to the Ypres Salient and took part in the Battle of La Bassée in October 1914. In March 1915, the 7th (Meerut) Division was chosen to lead the assault in the Battle of Neuve Chapelle.The Expeditionary Force was hampered by a lack of familiarity with new equipment, only being issued Lee–Enfield rifles on their arrival in France and they had almost no artillery, relying on support from their neighbouring corps when in the front line. They were not accustomed to the continental weather and were poorly equipped to resist the cold, leading to low morale which was further compounded by the reserve system, whereby reinforcements were drafted in from any regiment and had no affiliation to their new units. Officer casualties were even more of a handicap, as replacements were unfamiliar with the Indian Army and could not speak the language. The infantry divisions were finally withdrawn to Egypt in October 1915, when they were replaced by the new British divisions of Kitchener&#x27;s Army.

===South African Overseas Expeditionary Force===

The South African Overseas Expeditionary Force consisted of the 1st South African Infantry Brigade of four infantry battalions supported by five Heavy Artillery batteries, a Field Ambulance, a Royal Engineers Signal Company and a General Hospital under the command of Brigadier General Henry Lukin. The brigade arrived in France in April 1916, and was assigned to the 9th (Scottish) Division and took part in the Battle of the Somme in July 1916, and on 14 July the Battle of Delville Wood. Of the 3,153 men in the brigade only 750 were left when the brigade was relieved on 20 July. Later in 1917, the brigade took part in the Battle of Arras and in the Third Battle of Ypres (Passchendaele). The brigade was destroyed in the 1918 German spring offensive and by the end of the war had suffered 15,000 casualties, with 5,000 killed.
===Canadian Expeditionary Force===
The Canadian Expeditionary Force was the designation of the field force created by Canada for service overseas in the First World War. Its major combat formation was the Canadian Corps, which eventually commanded four Canadian infantry divisions. The Canadian Corps&#x27; first commander was General Edwin Alderson, who was succeeded by General Julian Byng in 1916, who was in turn succeeded in 1917, by the Canadian General Arthur Currie until the end of the war. They distinguished themselves in battle from the Second Battle of Ypres, through the Somme and particularly in the Battle of Arras at Vimy Ridge in April 1917. Since they were mostly untouched by the German offensive in the spring of 1918, the Canadians were ordered to help spearhead the last campaigns of the War from the Battle of Amiens in August 1918.

===New Zealand Expeditionary Force===

The New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF) under the command of General Alexander Godley was the title of the military forces sent from New Zealand to fight for Britain during the First World War. Upon the outbreak of war, New Zealand immediately offered to provide two brigades — one of infantry and one of mounted troops — a total of 8,500 men. The NZEF was closely tied to the AIF for much of the war. When the Gallipoli campaign began, the New Zealand contingent was insufficient to complete a division on their own so was combined with the 4th Australian Infantry Brigade to form the New Zealand and Australian Division. This division, along with the Australian 1st Division, formed the famous Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC) under the command of General William Birdwood. After the end of the Gallipoli campaign, the NZEF formed its own infantry division; the New Zealand Division which served on the Western Front from April 1916. It took part in the Battle of Flers-Courcelette, the Battle of Morval, the Battle of Le Transloy, and the celebrated Battle of Le Quesnoy. The New Zealanders were considered exceptional troops by the Germans, a captured intelligence report named them &quot;...An exceptionally good assault division ...&quot;.

===Australian Imperial Force===
The Australian Imperial Force (AIF) was originally supposed to supply 20,000 men organised into one infantry division and one light horse brigade plus supporting units. By the end of the war, the AIF on the Western Front comprised five infantry divisions. The first Australian troops arrived in France in June 1915, the 1st Siege Artillery Brigade was formed under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Walter Adams Coxen, the Australian Army&#x27;s Director of Artillery, for service on the Western Front. About half the men in the unit were permanent gunners of the Garrison Artillery. The brigade departed Melbourne for England on 17 July 1915 and landed in France on 27 February 1916. Its 54th Siege Battery was equipped with 8 inch howitzers and its 55th Siege Battery with 9.2 inch howitzers. Five infantry divisions of the AIF saw action on the Western Front in France and Belgium, leaving Egypt in March 1916. Initially they were organised into I Anzac Corps and II Anzac Corps alongside the New Zealand Division, however, on 1 November 1917 the Australian divisions were re-grouped together to form the Australian Corps.
The 2nd Division was the first to arrive in France, followed by the 1st Division, while the 4th and 5th left Egypt later in June 1916. The 3rd Division was the last to arrive, having been formed in Australia in March 1916, and moving to England for training in July 1916, before being sent to France in December 1916. When originally formed in 1914 the AIF was commanded by Major General William Throsby Bridges, who also commanded the 1st Division. After Bridges&#x27; death at Gallipoli in May 1915, command transferred by default to Lieutenant General William Birdwood, a British officer who was commander of the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps. Birdwood was officially confirmed as commander of the AIF on 14 September 1916, while also commanding I Anzac Corps on the Western Front. Birdwood was later given command of the Australian Corps on formation in November 1917. Lieutenant General John Monash, an Australian officer, took over command of the corps in May 1918. Despite being promoted to command the Fifth Army, Birdwood retained command of the AIF.

===Portuguese Expeditionary Corps===

Following a British Government call for Portuguese troops, on 7 August 1916 the Parliament of Portugal agreed the participation of the Portuguese Army on the Western Front. In addition to a heavy artillery corps of 1,000 men under the command of the French Army, most of the Portuguese forces to be sent to the Western Front were to be incorporated in the CEP – &quot;Corpo Expedicionário Português&quot; (Portuguese Expeditionary Corps) under British command. The CEP was organised as an army corps of two divisions and corps troops, totalling 55,000 men, under the command of General Tamagnini de Abreu. The first CEP troops arrived in France on 2 February 1917. The first troops reached the front on 4 April. On 4 June, the 1st Infantry Brigade of the 1st Division repelled the first major attack made by the German Army against the lines defended by the CEP troops. On 5 November 1917 the CEP assumed the responsibility for an autonomous sector in the front, under the direct command of First Army. Most of the CEP was destroyed in the Battle of the Lys on 9 April 1918, losing more than 7,000 men. From July 1918, the remaining men of the CEP participated in the final allied offensives under the command of Fifth Army.

===Newfoundland Regiment===
Newfoundland in 1914 was not yet part of Canada. The tiny Dominion with a population of only 240,000 raised a force that eventually reached a strength of three battalions to serve in the war. The Newfoundland Regiment deployed to France in March 1916, as part of the 29th Division, after already having served in the Gallipoli Campaign. The Newfoundland Regiment was practically wiped out on the first day of the Battle of the Somme, suffering over 90% casualties. After receiving reinforcements, the Newfoundland Regiment continued to serve on the Western Front until the war&#x27;s end. In honour of the regiment&#x27;s service the privilege of adding the prefix Royal to the regiment&#x27;s name was granted in December 1917, and the regiment was known as the Royal Newfoundland Regiment from that point on.

===British West Indies Regiment===

The British West Indies Regiment was a unit of the British Army during the First World War, formed from volunteers from British colonies in the West Indies.

==Weapons==
Until 1914, British infantry officers still carried swords and the cavalry retained the cavalry sword throughout the war. The other officers&#x27; weapon was the revolver, the three most common being the Webley MK V or VI, the Colt New Service and the Smith &amp; Wesson hand ejector.

All other ranks in the BEF carried a .303 Lee–Enfield rifle fitted with an easily loaded ten-round magazine and issued with a seventeen-inch (430 mm) bayonet. These rifles enabled a high rate of fire with good accuracy, such that pre-war British soldiers were trained to hit a target fifteen times a minute at a range of 300 yards. The devastating efficiency and accuracy of the BEF infantry led the Germans to incorrectly believe that there were approximately 28 machine guns in each battalion.

When the BEF landed in France each infantry battalion and cavalry regiment was equipped with two Vickers or Maxim machine guns. Part of the reason for only allocating two guns per unit was the cost of manufacture and the need of a ten-week intensive training course for a Vickers gunner. During the course of 1916, the quicker to manufacture and more versatile Lewis guns began to be issued on the intended scale of the sixteen per battalion, one for each platoon. At the same time, the Vickers guns and their trained operators were redeployed to specialist companies of the Machine Gun Corps; one company was attached to each infantry brigade.

==Campaign medals==

As well as individual gallantry awards, all members of the BEF qualified for up to three campaign medals.
The 1914 Star, the 1914–15 Star, the British War Medal and the Victory Medal.

The 1914 Star was issued to officers and men of British forces who served in France or Belgium between 5 August and midnight 22/23 November 1914. The former date is the day after Britain&#x27;s declaration of war against the Central Powers, and the closing date marks the end of the First Battle of Ypres.

The 1914–1915 Star was issued to officers and men of British and Imperial forces who served in any theatre of the War between 5 August 1914 and 31 December 1915 (other than those who had already qualified for the 1914 Star).

The British War Medal was issued to officers and men of British and Imperial forces who had rendered service between 5 August 1914 and 11 November 1918. Officers and men of the Royal Navy, Royal Marines, and Dominion and Colonial naval forces (including reserves) were required to have completed 28 days mobilised service — the medal was automatically awarded in the event of death on active service before the completion of this period.

The Victory Medal was issued to all those who received the 1914 Star or the 1914–1915 Star, and to those who were awarded the British War Medal. It was never awarded singly. Women qualified for this and the earlier two medals, for service in nursing homes and other auxiliary forces.

The Territorial Force War Medal was only awarded soldiers in the Territorial Force. To qualify, the recipient had to have been a member of the Territorial Force on or prior to 30 September 1914, and to have served in an operational theatre outside of the United Kingdom between 5 August 1914 and 11 November 1918.

The Silver War Badge was issued in the United Kingdom to service personnel who had been honourably discharged due to wounds or sickness during the War. The badge, sometimes known as the Discharge Badge, Wound Badge or Services Rendered Badge, was first issued in September 1916, along with an official certificate of entitlement.

==Aftermath==

The British Army during the Great War was the largest military force that Britain had ever put into the field up to that point. On the Western Front, the British Expeditionary Force ended the war as a strong fighting force, more experienced and slightly bigger than the United States Army and with better morale than the French Army. The cost of victory, however, was high. The official &quot;final and corrected&quot; casualty figures for the British Army, including the Territorial Force, were issued on 10 March 1921. The losses for the period between 4 August 1914, and 30 September 1919, included 573,507 &quot;killed in action, died from wounds and died of other causes&quot; and 254,176 missing (minus 154,308 released prisoners), for a net total of 673,375 dead and missing. Casualty figures also indicated that there were 1,643,469 wounded.

<doc id="207152" wikidata="Q319007" url="?curid=207152" title="National Football Conference">
<text>The National Football Conference (NFC) is a conference of the National Football League (NFL), the highest level of professional American football in the United States. The NFC and its counterpart, the American Football Conference (AFC), each have 16 teams organized into four divisions.
Both conferences were created as part of the 1970 NFL merger with the rival American Football League (AFL). All ten of the former AFL teams and three NFL teams formed the AFC while the remaining thirteen NFL clubs formed the NFC. A series of league expansions and division realignments have occurred since the merger, thus making a total of 16 clubs in each conference. 

The defending champions of the NFC are the Philadelphia Eagles, who defeated the Washington Commanders in the 2024 season&#x27;s NFC Championship Game for their fifth conference championship in the team&#x27;s history.

==Teams==
Since 2002, like the AFC, the NFC has 16 teams that organized into four divisions each with four teams: East, North, South, and West.

==Season structure==


This chart of the 2024 season standings displays an application of the NFL scheduling formula. The Eagles in 2024 finished in first place in the NFC East. Thus, in 2025, the Eagles (highlighted in green) will play two games against each of its division rivals (highlighted in light blue), one game against each team in the NFC North and AFC West (highlighted in yellow), and one game each against the first-place finishers in the NFC South, NFC West (highlighted in orange), and AFC East (highlighted in pink).
The fourteen opponents each team faces over the 17-game regular season schedule are set using a predetermined formula:

Each NFC team plays the other teams in their respective division twice (home and away) during the regular season, in addition to eleven other games assigned to their schedule by the NFL: three games are assigned on the basis of a particular team&#x27;s final divisional standing from the previous season, and the remaining eight games are split between the roster of two other NFL divisions. This assignment shifts each year and will follow a standard cycle. Using the 2023 regular season schedule as an example, each team in the NFC East plays against every team in the NFC West and AFC East. In this way, non-divisional competition will be mostly among common opponents – the exception being the three games assigned based on the team&#x27;s prior-season divisional standing.

At the end of each season, the four division winners and three wild cards (non-division winners with best regular season record) in the NFC qualify for the playoffs. The NFC playoffs culminate in the NFC Championship Game with the winner receiving the George S. Halas Trophy. The NFC champion then plays the AFC champion in the Super Bowl.

==History==
Both the AFC and NFC were created after the NFL merged with the American Football League (AFL) in 1970. When the AFL began play in 1960 with eight teams, the NFL consisted of 13 clubs. By 1969, the AFL had expanded to ten teams and the NFL to 16 clubs. In order to balance the merged league, all ten of the former AFL teams along with the NFL&#x27;s Cleveland Browns, Pittsburgh Steelers, and Baltimore Colts formed the AFC, while the remaining 13 NFL teams formed the NFC.

While the newly formed AFC had already agreed upon and set up their divisional alignment plan along almost purely geographic lines, team owners could not agree to a plan on how to align the clubs in the NFC. The alignment proposals were narrowed down to five finalists (each one sealed in an envelope), and then the plan that was eventually selected was picked out of a glass bowl by then-NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle&#x27;s secretary, Thelma Elkjer, on January 16, 1970.

The five alignment plans for the NFC in 1970 were as follows, with Plan 3 eventually selected:

*Plan 1
**Eastern – Atlanta Falcons, Minnesota Vikings, New York Giants, Philadelphia Eagles, Washington Redskins
**Central – Chicago Bears, Detroit Lions, Green Bay Packers, New Orleans Saints
**Western – Dallas Cowboys, Los Angeles Rams, St. Louis Cardinals, San Francisco 49ers
*Plan 2
**Eastern – Minnesota, New York Giants, Philadelphia, Washington
**Central – Atlanta, Dallas, New Orleans, St. Louis
**Western – Chicago, Detroit, Green Bay, Los Angeles, San Francisco 
*Plan 3
**Eastern – Dallas, New York Giants, Philadelphia, St. Louis, Washington
**Central – Chicago, Detroit, Green Bay, Minnesota
**Western – Atlanta, Los Angeles, New Orleans, San Francisco
*Plan 4
**Eastern – Minnesota, New York Giants, Philadelphia, St. Louis, Washington
**Central – Atlanta, Chicago, Detroit, Green Bay
**Western – Dallas, New Orleans, Los Angeles, San Francisco 
*Plan 5
**Eastern – Detroit, Minnesota, New York Giants, Philadelphia, Washington 
**Central – Chicago, Dallas, Green Bay, St. Louis 
**Western – Atlanta, Los Angeles, New Orleans, San Francisco

Three expansion teams have joined the NFC since the merger, thus making the total 16. When the Seattle Seahawks and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers joined the league in 1976, they were temporarily placed in the NFC and AFC, respectively, for one season before they switched conferences. The Seahawks returned to the NFC as a result of the 2002 realignment. The Carolina Panthers joined the NFC in 1995.

Parity is generally greater among NFC teams than AFC teams. The only NFC team that has never made a Super Bowl appearance is the Detroit Lions. Since the 2002 division realignment, the NFC has sent 12 different teams to the Super Bowl -- all except the Lions, Vikings, Cowboys, and Commanders -- whereas the AFC has only sent 8: the Baltimore Ravens (1 time), the Cincinnati Bengals (1 time), the Las Vegas Raiders (1 time), the Kansas City Chiefs (4 times), the Denver Broncos (2 times), the Indianapolis Colts (2 times), the Pittsburgh Steelers (3 times) and the New England Patriots (8 times). The only NFC team to make back to back Super Bowls since 2002 are the Seattle Seahawks.

As of 2021, the only pre-merger team that does not play in its 1969 market is the St. Louis Cardinals, who moved in 1988 to Phoenix suburb of Tempe (they moved to Glendale in 2006). The Los Angeles Rams moved to St. Louis in 1995, but moved back to Los Angeles in 2016. None of the expansion teams added after 1970 have relocated.

With the exception of the aforementioned relocations since that time, the divisional setup established in 2002 has remained static ever since.

==Logo==

The original NFC logo, in use from 1970 to 2009, depicted a blue &#x27;N&#x27; with three stars across it. The new logo was similar to that of the AFC (which itself was similar to the AFL logo) in that unlike the NFL logo it consisted of a single letter instead of a full abbreviation. The three stars represented the three divisions that were used from 1970 to 2001 (Eastern, Central and Western). The 2010 NFL season brought an updated NFC logo. Largely similar to the old logo, the new logo has a fourth star, representing the four divisions that have composed the NFC since 2002, with the AFC logo being simultaneously updated in a similar manner.

==Television==
CBS aired the NFC&#x27;s Sunday afternoon and playoffs games from 1970 through the 1993 season. From 1994 to 2013, Fox was the primary rightsholder to the NFC&#x27;s games. In those years, all interconference games in which the NFC team was the visiting team were broadcast on either CBS or Fox. Since 2014, the cross-flex policy allows select NFC games (that involve them playing an AFC team at home or intraconference games) to be moved from Fox to CBS. Since 1990, select NFC playoff games have been seen on ABC or ESPN.

<text>Arthur Stanton Eric Johnson (January 20, 1929 – July 3, 2019) was an American actor and comedian who was best known for his work as a regular on television&#x27;s &quot;Rowan &amp; Martin&#x27;s Laugh-In&quot;.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Johnson was born January 20, 1929, in Benton Harbor, Michigan, the son of Abraham Lincoln and Edythe Mackenzie (Goldberg/Golden) Johnson. His father was an attorney. Johnson graduated from Austin High School and received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in radio journalism from University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign in 1949, where he worked at the campus radio station and the University of Illinois Theater Guild with his brother Coslough &quot;Cos&quot; Johnson.

Following brief military service in Korea (he was discharged due to a duodenal ulcer he had suffered since childhood), he sought employment in Chicago advertising agencies but was unsuccessful and left for New York City to work for Viking Press. In early 1954, Johnson performed in several New York nightclubs, including Le Ruban Bleu and the Village Vanguard. His first job in show business came when he impulsively stepped into an audition line and was cast in &quot;Gentlemen Prefer Blondes&quot;. Johnson appeared in Ben Bagley&#x27;s &quot;The Shoestring Revue&quot;, which opened off-Broadway on February 28, 1955, at the President Theater in New York. 

===Early television and film roles===
Johnson appeared three times in the 1955–1956 CBS sitcom &quot;It&#x27;s Always Jan&quot;, starring Janis Paige and Merry Anders. In 1956 a young Arte Johnson appeared in season 3, episode 22, of &quot;Make Room for Daddy&quot; in an episode called &quot;Who Can Figure Kids&quot;, where he sang and danced. In 1958 he joined the cast of the short-lived NBC sitcom &quot;Sally&quot;. On that program he played Bascomb Bleacher, Jr., the son of a co-owner of a department store, portrayed by Gale Gordon. He played Ariel Lavalerra in the 1960 film &quot;The Subterraneans&quot;, an adaptation of Jack Kerouac&#x27;s 1958 novel of the same name. In 1960 and 1961, he appeared in three episodes of Jackie Cooper&#x27;s military sitcom/drama series &quot;Hennesey&quot;, also on CBS. In &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot; he played Mr. Bates in the episode &quot;A Secret Life&quot; (1962). He was cast in an episode of Frank Aletter&#x27;s sitcom &quot;Bringing Up Buddy&quot;. He also appeared in an episode of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; titled &quot;The Whole Truth&quot; (1961).

Before his big breakthrough in &quot;Laugh-In&quot;, Johnson was cast for a guest role as Corporal Coogan in the anthology series &quot;GE True&quot; (&quot;The Handmade Private,&quot; 1962). He played a bumbling navy cameraman on an episode of &quot;McHale&#x27;s Navy&quot; in the first season and &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot; as a hotel clerk in the episode &quot;Andy and Barney in the Big City&quot; (also 1962). He was a member of the regular cast of the 1962–1963 situation comedy &quot;Don&#x27;t Call Me Charlie!&quot;, portraying Corporal Lefkowitz. Johnson appeared in a comedic role as Charlie, a boom-microphone operator who demonstrates to Jack Benny how to tell a joke properly, on &quot;The Jack Benny Program&quot; that aired on October 2, 1964. The joke performed in the sketch was the &quot;ugly baby&quot; story, later associated with Flip Wilson. He made a guest appearance on ABC&#x27;s sitcom, &quot;Bewitched&quot; as Samantha&#x27;s (Elizabeth Montgomery) Cousin Edgar in the final episode of the first season, airing on June 2, 1965. Also in 1965, Johnson played a rare dramatic supporting role in the film &quot;The Third Day&quot; as Lester Aldrich, who turns out to be the downtrodden husband of the sleazy nymphomaniac Holly.

Johnson appeared in one of the final episodes of ABC&#x27;s &quot;The Donna Reed Show&quot; in 1966. He was cast in the satirical James Coburn film &quot;The President&#x27;s Analyst&quot; (1967), in which he gave a comically chilling performance as a federal agent with a blindly obedient &quot;orders are orders&quot; mentality. He appeared in the Season 3 episode of &quot;Lost in Space&quot; titled &quot;Princess of Space&quot; (1968). Johnson also starred in an episode of Rod Serling&#x27;s &quot;Night Gallery&quot; titled &quot;The Flip-Side of Satan&quot; (1971).

===&quot;Laugh-In&quot;===
Johnson is best known for his work on &quot;Rowan &amp; Martin&#x27;s Laugh-In&quot; from 1968 to 1973, on which he played many characters, including &quot;Wolfgang,&quot; a cigarette-smoking German soldier oblivious to the fact that World War II was long over, as he skulked while hidden behind a potted plant. He would then invariably comment on a preceding gag with the catchphrase &quot;Very interesting ...,&quot; which Johnson claimed was inspired by a Nazi character who spoke the line during an interrogation scene in the film &quot;Desperate Journey&quot; (1942). Often toward the show&#x27;s close, he (as the German) would offer words of affection to &quot;Lucy and Gary&quot; (Lucille Ball and her second husband Gary Morton). &quot;The Lucy Show&quot; and later &quot;Here&#x27;s Lucy&quot; on CBS were in direct competition with NBC&#x27;s &quot;Laugh-In&quot; on Monday night. Johnson reprised the role briefly on &quot;Sesame Street&quot; in the early 1970s, and while voicing the Nazi-inspired character Virman Vundabar on an episode of &quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot;.

His other prominent &quot;Laugh-In&quot; character was &quot;Tyrone F. Horneigh&quot; (pronounced &quot;horn-eye,&quot; a &quot;clean&quot; variant of the vulgar term &quot;horny&quot;), the white-haired, trench coat-wearing &quot;dirty old man&quot; who repeatedly sought to seduce &quot;Gladys Ormphby,&quot; (Ruth Buzzi&#x27;s brown-clad &quot;spinster&quot; character) on a park bench. Tyrone would enter the scene, muttering a song (usually &quot;In the Merry, Merry Month of May&quot;), and, spying Gladys on the bench, would sit next to her. He would ask her a question, and regardless of the answer, turn it into a double entendre. She would then start hitting him with her purse and he would fall off the bench, sometimes with a plea for help.

To boost ratings in the third season, Tyrone successfully courted Gladys which led to an on-air wedding on the March 16, 1970, episode during the spring ratings sweep. Tiny Tim played best man, with Carol Channing as the bridesmaid, and Henry Gibson officiating. Alas, both bride-to-be and groom-to-be walk out of the church just before the wedding vows are spoken.

Years after &quot;Laugh-In&quot; ended, the two characters were the subject of an animated Saturday-morning children&#x27;s show, &quot;Baggy Pants and the Nitwits&quot;, with Tyrone as a helpful, muttering &quot;superhero.&quot;

Johnson and his brother Coslough earned Emmy Awards while working on &quot;Laugh-In&quot;.

===Later work===
Johnson guest-starred in two episodes of &quot;The Partridge Family&quot; (&quot;My Heart Belongs to a Two Car Garage&quot; and &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls... and Tolls... and Tolls&quot;) and the situation comedy &quot;A Touch of Grace&quot; (1973). He appeared in the first season of the Detroit-produced children&#x27;s show &quot;Hot Fudge&quot; (1974) and, for one week, as a celebrity guest panelist on the game show &quot;Match Game&quot;. From 1976 to 1980, Johnson was a regular celebrity guest judge on &quot;The Gong Show&quot;.

In 1976, Johnson voiced the animated cartoon character Misterjaw, a blue, German-accented shark, in &quot;The Pink Panther Show&quot;. He also voiced the character &quot;Rhubarb&quot; on &quot;The Houndcats&quot; and appeared as a guest on Canadian TV show &quot;Celebrity Cooks&quot; (1976) with host Bruno Gerussi. Johnson appeared on an episode of the NBC daytime version of &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; in September 1977 as a substitute letter-turner, both to fill in for an injured Susan Stafford, and to promote his short-lived NBC game show &quot;Knockout&quot;, which aired through early 1978. Instead of being introduced by the show&#x27;s announcer, he would start the show with a small monologue, then the announcer would introduce the day&#x27;s contestants. He was cast as Renfield, the comic sidekick of George Hamilton&#x27;s Dracula in the film &quot;Love at First Bite&quot; (1979) and appeared in the all-star television disaster film &quot;Condominium&quot; (1980). He voiced &quot;Weerd&quot; in &quot;The 13 Ghosts of Scooby-Doo&quot; (1985), and played a disgruntled employee denied severance pay in an episode of &quot;Airwolf&quot;. He also voiced several other characters: Dr. Ludwig Von Strangebuck and Count Ray on two episodes of &quot;DuckTales&quot;; Devil Smurf on &quot;The Smurfs&quot;; Top Cat and Lou on &quot;Yo Yogi!&quot;; and Newt on &quot;Animaniacs&quot;. Johnson guest-starred in the &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; episode &quot;No Laughing Murder&quot; (1987). He also appeared in an episode of &quot;Night Court&quot; (1990). From 1991 to 1992, Johnson appeared in multiple episodes of &quot;General Hospital&quot; as Finian O&#x27;Toole. He played the old laboratory head of a team of scientists working on a serum of youth in &quot;Second Chance&quot; (1996).

Johnson performed more than 80 audiobook readings, including Gary Shteyngart&#x27;s &quot;Absurdistan&quot; (2006) and Carl Hiaasen&#x27;s &quot;Bad Monkey&quot;. He appeared in the &quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot; episode &quot;The Ties That Bind&quot; (2005) as the voice of Virman Vundabar, which was his final acting role before his retirement in 2006.

==Personal life==
Johnson lived in Southern California with his wife, Gisela. He was previously married to choreographer Texie Waterman. He was a non-Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma survivor, having been diagnosed and successfully treated in 1997. Johnson died on July 3, 2019, after being ill for three years with bladder and prostate cancer. He was 90. His ashes were scattered off Hawaii. Gisela Johnson survives him.

<text>The Akron Pros were a professional football team that played in Akron, Ohio from 1908 to 1926. The team originated in 1908 as a semi-pro team named the Akron Indians, but later became Akron Pros in 1920 as the team set out to become a charter member of the American Professional Football Association (later renamed the National Football League (NFL) in 1922). Fritz Pollard, the first black head coach in the NFL, co-coached the Akron Pros in 1921. Paul Robeson played for the team in 1921 as well. He was among the earliest stars of professional football before football became segregated from 1934 to 1946. In 1926, the name was changed back to the Akron Indians, after the earlier semi-pro team. Due to financial problems, the team suspended operations in 1927 and surrendered its franchise the following year.

==History==

===Origins===

Before 1908, several semi-pro and amateur teams dominated the Akron football scene. The most dominant of these was a team known as the Akron East Ends. The East Ends&#x27; dominance of Ohio football went unmatched until the Massillon Tigers paid several ringers from the recently disbanded Pittsburgh Stars to defeat the East Ends in 1903.

The Akron Indians date as far back as 1908. The early Indians teams went on to win Ohio League championships in 1908, 1909, 1913 and 1914. The team was always referred to as the Indians by the fans. From 1908 to 1913, the Indians had a reputation of playing more of a style of football seen at the college level than that of the early athletic clubs. For example, the Indians preferred passing the ball as opposed to running.

===Parratt&#x27;s Indians===

Before the 1912 season, Peggy Parratt, an early football star with the Massillon Tigers, Franklin Athletic Club and the Shelby Blues, joined the Indians. He made the move after realizing that he could make more money in the large football market that Akron provided. When he arrived in Akron, his first move was to change the team name from the &quot;Akron&quot; Indians to &quot;Parratt&#x27;s Indians&quot;. With Peggy as a player, coach, and owner-manager, the Indians split their series with Shelby and twice defeated Canton, 14–7 and 19–7. However, they were defeated by the unheard-of Elyria Athletics, who then took the Ohio championship. The Athletics were mostly former Blues players who formed a team in Elyria after Parratt left for Akron.

The following season, Parratt brought most of Elyria&#x27;s 1912 championship team to Akron and added them to his roster. The Indians then beat Shelby and Elyria. They also managed to tie the rapidly improving Canton Pros. During the Indians&#x27; championship game against Shelby, the Blues loaded their team with a collection of famous players from big eastern schools and supported each member with a payroll of $700 for just that one game. However, the game was canceled due to a snowstorm. A week later when the Blues returned to Akron, the Indians were prepared with newly recruited talent that was viewed as even superior to that of Shelby&#x27;s. The Indians won the game 20–0 and brought the Ohio title back to Akron.

For his 1914 recruiting efforts, Parratt signed the usual big-name players, which consisted of a lineup that changed from week to week, with just enough stars on hand to guarantee a win. However, in 1914, he also employed several former Notre Dame stars, including the legendary Knute Rockne, Howard &quot;Horse&quot; Edwards, &quot;Deke&quot; Jones, and Joe Collins, as well as several Ohio collegiate stars like Ed Kagy, Dwight Wertz, Homer Davidson, Dutch Powell, Frank Nesser, and Ralph &quot;Fat&quot; Waldsmith. By late season, the entire left side of his Akron Indian line was from Notre Dame. The team dominated the Ohio League for the season. However, it managed to lose to Canton 6–0 on November 15, 1914. Despite the win, Canton&#x27;s captain Harry Turner died when his spine broke during a tackle on Akron fullback Joe Collins. Turner&#x27;s death marked the first fatal accident involving a major professional football team in Ohio.

To avoid an Akron title in 1915 the owners of the Massillon Tigers raided Parratt&#x27;s Akron roster and took away many of his star players. Canton manager Jack Cusack also picked up some former Akron players and signed Jim Thorpe to his renamed Canton Bulldogs team. By the end of the season, Parratt&#x27;s team was made up mostly of Akron sandlotters. After the disastrous 1915 season, Parratt returned to Cleveland, where he took some of his former Akron players and a few ex-collegians and formed a respectable team, which he named the Cleveland Tigers.

===Burkhardts===

In 1916 a local brewer, Burkhardt Brewing Company, took over the remains of the Indians and renamed the club the Akron Burkhardts. The team was reorganized by Howe Welch and his brothers Chang and Suey. After three seasons, Welch was a player, coach, and manager for Akron, playing against many of professional football&#x27;s early stars. The 1916 Burkhardts had a winning record despite falling to the Bulldogs and splitting a two-game series with the Columbus Panhandles. In 1918 the team was once again renamed the Indians, however, this is disputed due to many records of the time still referring to the club as the Burkhardts until 1920. The 1919 team, finished their season 5–5–0. However, the Indians lost money despite the presence of one of the country&#x27;s best breakaway runners, Fritz Pollard, the league&#x27;s first black player. From 1917 through at least 1921, the Indians name was sold off to Suey Welch, who fielded it as an independent club.

===Pros===

After experiencing financial losses from 1912 to 1919, the team was sold to Art Ranney, an Akron businessman and former football player at the University of Akron, and Frank Nied, a cigar store proprietor in 1920. The new owners soon dropped the Indian moniker and went with &quot;Pros,&quot; hoping to inspire better results, or at least better attendance. Nied and Ranney befriended and signed Fritz Pollard to their team. The two co-owners later made Pollard the first African-American coach in the NFL.

====Founding of the National Football League (NFL)====

The minutes for the September 17, 1920, meeting that formed the APFA, were kept on the stationery of the Akron Pros football team by one of the owners, Art Ranney. Ranney was then elected secretary-treasurer of the league (later renamed the National Football League in 1922).

====1920 NFL champions====

Pollard and most of the top 1919 players planned to return to the Pros in 1920. The team opened the season at League Park in early October by defeating the Wheeling Stogies, 43–0. Al Nesser, one of the infamous football-playing Nesser Brothers, scored three touchdowns on fumble recoveries. The following week the Pros defeated the Columbus Panhandles 37–0 using former guard, Frank McCormick as a wingback. After a 13–0 win over the Cincinnati Celts, the Pros played the Cleveland Tigers, a team composed mainly of ex-stars from the Massillon Tigers. Bob Nash, who played for Massillon in 1919, broke up a Stan Cofall punt resulting in an Akron touchdown and a final score of 7–0. The Pros then shocked the league by beating the Canton Bulldogs, who were considered the top team in the nation in 1920 with stars Jim Thorpe, Joe Guyon, Pete Calac, and Pete Henry, 10–0. However, after a rained-out game against the Detroit Heralds, the Pros played a reorganized Tigers team that held the Pros to a 7–7 tie. The team, under the rushing of Pollard and McCormick, rebounded by defeating the Dayton Triangles 13–0. After a 7–0 victory in a rematch to Canton, as well as a second win over Dayton, the Pros were recognized as the top team in Ohio.

The Pros then held the Buffalo All-Americans to a scoreless tie in front of only 3,000. At the game, Nied and Ranney agreed to sell Bob Nash to Buffalo for $300 and five percent of the gate in the first known player deal between NFL clubs. However, since the Pros held the best record in the league, they only had to avoid losing a game, while Buffalo and the Decatur Staleys had to win to capture the AFPA Championship. The Pros held the Staleys to a scoreless tie in front of 12,000 fans at Cub Park.

Both the All-Americans and the Staleys complained about the championship, arguing that Akron had not defeated them. The Pros were not named the AFPA Champs until April 30, 1921, after the team managers got together at Canton and voted the title to Akron, granting the team the Brunswick-Balke Collender Cup. (Not coincidentally, Ranney, then the league&#x27;s secretary, presided over the meeting as &quot;de facto&quot; President of the league, since neither President Jim Thorpe nor Vice President Stan Cofall appeared at the meeting.) According to modern NFL tie-breaking rules, the 1920 Buffalo All-Americans would be co-champions. They would be tied with the Pros in win percentage, wins to losses (.864), both teams beating out the Decatur Staleys, who would have a season that counted 11 wins to 2 losses (.846).

===Decline===

The Pros finished in 3rd place in 1921 and 10th place in 1922. The team only finished higher than 13th place in 1925, when it completed the season at fifth. Following the 1925 season, the Pros returned to being the Akron Indians. This new team played for the next four seasons before disbanding due to declining financial support and the team&#x27;s poor record after the 1926 season. The team suspended operations in 1927 and formally surrendered its franchise the following year.

<text>The Cleveland Bulldogs were a team that played in Cleveland, Ohio in the National Football League. They were originally called the Indians in 1923, not to be confused with the Cleveland Indians NFL franchise in 1922. However, after team owner Samuel Deutsch purchased the Canton Bulldogs in 1924, he merged the Canton team with his Indians and renamed his franchise the Cleveland Bulldogs. The Canton Bulldogs remained a part of the team until 1925, when they were sold back to Canton. The Cleveland Bulldogs played in the NFL until 1928 when they were relocated to Detroit and became the Detroit Wolverines. The team was later incorporated into the New York Giants in 1929. The Cleveland Bulldogs won the 1924 NFL championship.

==History==

===Origins===
Sam Deutsch, a Cleveland jeweler and boxing promoter who also owned a minor-league baseball team, bought an NFL franchise in 1923 and named the team the Indians. They played only seven games in that first season, but they had a shot at the championship, with a 3–0–3 record going into their final game against the Canton Bulldogs, who were also undefeated. The Indians were defeated 46–0 and posted a 3–1–3 league record, finishing fifth in the league, which comprised twenty teams at the time.

===Purchase of the Canton Bulldogs===
However, in August 1924, Deutsch, bought the defending NFL champions Canton Bulldogs for $2,500. The Bulldogs were experiencing heavy financial troubles at time and were sold to Deutsch without much of a struggle. Duestch combined the Cleveland Indians with the Canton Bulldogs, creating a new team, the Cleveland Bulldogs. Only seven of the Canton players actually joined the new Bulldogs; among them was player-coach Guy Chamberlin. The team played all of its home games at Dunn Field although Deutsch returned the team to Canton for the Thanksgiving game that season.

===1924 NFL champions and controversy===
The Cleveland Bulldogs won the NFL championship that year with a 7–1–1 record. After winning their first six games, the Bulldogs lost to the Frankford Yellow Jackets and entered a virtual tie with the Chicago Bears for first place in the standings. The Bears played more games, but also had more ties, and their one loss had come in the season opener against the Bulldogs. The Bears attempted to have an after-season exhibition game counted toward the standings, however in 1924 this was against the NFL&#x27;s rules. In July 1924, NFL owners had agreed on a proposal that the 1924 NFL season would begin on September 27 and end on November 30. Ironically, as it turned out, the proposal was made by Dutch Sternaman, co-owner of the Bears. On the official end date, Cleveland had a 7–1–1 record to Bears&#x27; 6–1–4. Ties didn&#x27;t count at all in those days, so the Bulldogs were in first place with an .875 winning percentage to Chicago&#x27;s .857. However, on December 7, 1924, the Bulldogs went to Chicago for a challenge match. The Bears won the game, 23–0, and claimed that they deserved the NFL championship; they cited as precedent the 1921 championship decision (which the Bears had won over the Buffalo All-Americans) that declared there was no such thing as an exhibition game. However, the issue wasn&#x27;t settled until the owners&#x27; meeting in January, when the owners voted for Cleveland to take the title. The owners also decided at that meeting that the 1925 season would run through December 20.

===Decline===
In 1925, several Canton businessmen purchased the rights to the old Canton Bulldogs team from Deutsch for $3,000. The Bulldogs, now known as the Canton Bulldogs, played in Canton during the 1925 and 1926 seasons. However Deutsch continued to call his Cleveland franchise the Bulldogs. He also sold his Cleveland Indians half of the club to Herb Brandt in August 1925. That season the Cleveland Bulldogs fell to a dismal 5–8–1 record. The team performed poorly on the field and at the bank. By mid-November the organization was nearly bankrupt.
In 1926 Brandt received authority from the league to suspend operations for a year. 

In 1927 by Sammy Deutsch made his reappearance, heading an ownership group which included Brandt, Max Rosenblum, Harold Gould, and Clinton Winfrey that took over and restarted the Cleveland Bulldogs franchise. The financially failing Kansas City Cowboys was purchased and provided the core of players for the new 1927 Bulldogs football club. Deutsch saw the team as a new business opportunity when he was able to procure the services of Cleveland-born Michigan passing legend Benny Friedman, whom he contracted of an astounding $18,000 for the 1927 season — the second highest compensation package in the league behind only Red Grange. 

The team finished fourth in the National Football League in 1927, with an 8–4–1 record, but the joy was short-lived as the team relocated to become the Detroit Wolverines in 1928 to better cash in on Friedman&#x27;s popularity.

===Ties to the New York Giants===

At the end of the season, Elliott Fisher purchased the Bulldogs and moved the team to Detroit to become the Wolverines. The 1928 Wolverines team consisted of 12 former Bulldogs players. Before the 1929 season, Tim Mara, owner of the New York Giants, purchased the entire Wolverines squad — with superstar passer Benny Friedman the primary object of his desire — and absorbed the team into his New York Giants franchise. Eight former Bulldogs players ended up playing for the Giants that season.

<text>The Frankford Yellow Jackets were a professional American football team, part of the National Football League from 1924 to 1931, although its origin dates back to as early as 1899 with the Frankford Athletic Association. The Yellow Jackets won the NFL championship in 1926. The team played its home games from 1923 in Frankford Stadium (also called Yellow Jacket Field) in Frankford, Philadelphia, a neighborhood in the northeast of Philadelphia, noted for the Market–Frankford Line that terminates there.

==Founding==
===Frankford Athletic Association===
The Frankford Athletic Association was organized in May 1899 in the parlor of the Suburban Club. The cost of purchasing a share in the association was $10. However, there were also contributing memberships, ranging from $1 to $2.50, made available to the general public. The Association was a community-based non-profit organization of local residents and businesses. In keeping with its charter, which stated that &quot;all profits shall be donated to charity&quot;, all of the team&#x27;s excess income was donated to local charitable institutions. The beneficiaries of this generosity included Frankford Hospital, the Frankford Day Nursery, the local Boy Scouts, and the local American Legion Post 211. The officers of the Association never received a salary or compensation for their work on behalf of the team.

The playing field, known as Wistar Field, became the first official home of the Yellow Jackets. Several years later, when the construction of the current high school was proposed, the team moved to Brown&#x27;s Field. The Association initially fielded a baseball team; however, soccer and football clubs were also formed. The Association&#x27;s football team played several games in 1899, including victorious contests against the Pioneer Athletic Association, Jefferson Medical College, the Philadelphia Athletic Club, and a team from Atlantic City.

The original Frankford Athletic Association disbanded before the 1909 football season. Several of the original players from the 1899 football team kept the team together, and they became known as Loyola Athletic Club. In keeping with Yellow Jackets tradition, they carried the &quot;Frankford&quot; name again in 1912, to become the Frankford Athletic Association.

==Yellow Jackets and the NFL==
In the early 1920s, the Frankford Athletic Association&#x27;s Yellow Jackets gained the reputation of being one of the best independent football teams in the nation. In 1922, Frankford absorbed the Philadelphia City Champion team, the Union Quakers of Philadelphia. That year Frankford captured the unofficial championship of Philadelphia. During the 1922 and 1923 seasons the Yellow Jackets compiled a 6–2–1 record against teams from the National Football League. This led to the Association being granted an NFL franchise in 1924.

===1924 season===
The Yellow Jackets assembled in September 1924 under coach Punk Berryman to begin preparing for the upcoming season. The team included players Harry Dayhoff, Russ Stein, Bill Kellogg, Joe Spagna, Whitey Thomas, Al Bedner, and Bob Jamison. The team often played 15 to 20 games a season. Frequently, they would schedule two games on the same weekend, typically one at home on Saturday and, because of Pennsylvania&#x27;s blue laws, an away game on Sunday. In their first game as a member of the NFL, the Yellow Jackets defeated the Rochester Jeffersons 21–0. Frankford finished the season with an overall record of 17–3–1, with an 11–2–1 record in league play. They finished third in league standings only behind the Cleveland Bulldogs and Chicago Bears; under modern standings tabulation procedures, Frankford would have finished in first place. In their 14 games, the Yellow Jackets also scored 38 rushing touchdowns during the 1924 season, an NFL record that stood for 98 years. The record was finally broken on January 29, 2023, by the same franchise that replaced them. The 2022 Philadelphia Eagles scored their 39th rushing touchdown in a single season (including the postseason) with four rushing touchdowns in the NFC Championship Game against the San Francisco 49ers. The Yellow Jackets did not have the benefit of postseason play in 1924, and that the Eagles required 19 games to break the record.

===1925 season===
In 1925 the Frankford Athletic Association enlisted the services of Guy Chamberlin, who served as a player-coach for NFL championship teams such as the 1922 and 1923 Canton Bulldogs and the 1924 Cleveland Bulldogs. After a 9–1 start in league play, Frankford lost several key players, including Chamberlin, to injuries. After a 49–0 defeat to the Pottsville Maroons, Frankford&#x27;s captain Bull Behman was suspended indefinitely from the team for indifferent play. He was accused of not giving his best during the past few weeks because of some dissension with other players. The move helped improve the team, which posted a 13–7 record in league play.

====1925 NFL Championship controversy====

The Yellow Jackets had a part in the 1925 NFL Championship controversy. A dispute arose over a game that the nearby Pottsville Maroons had played against the Notre Dame All-Stars in Philadelphia; the Yellow Jackets asserted that their nearby rivals had infringed on their territorial rights by playing the game against a non-league opponent in Philadelphia. The league agreed and suspended the Maroons, allowing the Chicago Cardinals to win the 1925 title. However, the NFL reinstated the Maroons the following year after fears that the team would join Red Grange&#x27;s upstart American Football League, which posed a threat to the league.

===1926 Championship season===
The Yellow Jackets began the 1926 season with an exhibition game against the Atlantic City Roses, which Frankford won 45–0. Their NFL campaign started just six days later, in a disappointing 6–6 tie at home against the Akron Pros. The first weekend in October saw the club post two solid victories over the Hartford Blues. They then played a two-game series against the Buffalo Rangers. During the Saturday game, the Yellow Jackets defeated the Rangers 30–0 in Frankford. The Jackets then headed to Buffalo for the Sunday game; however, the Rangers canceled due to &quot;wet grounds&quot;. The Yellow Jackets prepared for another two-game set, this time against the New York Giants, resulting in a pair of 6–0 Frankford victories. The Canton Bulldogs were next on the schedule; Frankford won the first game 10–0, while the second game was canceled due to rain.
During the final weekend of October, the Yellow Jackets had a league-leading 6–0–1 record. However, they had an upcoming two-game set with their toughest opponent yet, the Providence Steam Rollers. The Yellow Jackets managed to split the series. The team&#x27;s November schedule included only single-game weekends and a Thanksgiving Day game. This played to the Yellow Jackets’ advantage. The team posted victories over the Chicago Cardinals, Duluth Eskimos, and Dayton Triangles. This string of victories left Frankford in great shape in the standings as the team headed into its Thanksgiving Day game with the Green Bay Packers. For the next five seasons, the Frankford-Green Bay Thanksgiving Day game would become an annual tradition. Frankford went on to win the game 20–14, due mainly to a touchdown pass from Hust Stockton to Two-Bits Homan. The Yellow Jackets then posted a 7–6 victory over the Detroit Panthers two days later.

After a win over the Chicago Bears, the Yellow Jackets played a second two-game series against the Providence Steam Rollers. Frankford won the first game 24–0, but the second was canceled because of heavy snow. Frankford then had to play their final game of the season against the Pottsville Maroons, who were still upset after their NFL championship title had been stripped from them after complaints from Frankford. The game resulted in a scoreless tie. However, a 14–1–2 final record left the Yellow Jackets alone atop the NFL standings. Since a Championship Game would not exist in the NFL until 1933, the team with the best regular-season record was named the NFL Champion. This gave the Yellow Jackets undisputed claim to the league crown. The Jackets&#x27; 14 wins during the 1926 championship season set an NFL record for regular-season victories that stood until 1984 when it was broken by the 15–1–0 San Francisco 49ers.

One day after capturing the title, however, Theodore &quot;Thee&quot; Holden and Guy Chamberlin stepped down as president and coach of the Frankford Athletic Association.

===1927–1929 seasons===
James Adams took over as president of the Frankford Athletic Association in 1927. He hired Charley Moran as the team&#x27;s new coach. However, Moran&#x27;s son Tom briefly served as the team&#x27;s interim coach that year after Charley took a leave of absence to officiate in the 1927 World Series between the New York Yankees and the Pittsburgh Pirates. The Jackets suffered as a result of these changes and held a 2–5–1 record after eight league games. This led to Ed Weir becoming the team&#x27;s player-coach. Weir had fellow players Russ Daugherty, Charlie Rogers, and Swede Youngstrom serve as assistant coaches. Under Weir&#x27;s leadership, the team finished with a 6–9–3 record in 1927. The Jackets rebounded in 1928 with an 11–3–2 league record, behind only the Providence Steam Rollers. In 1929, Bull Behman became coach of the Yellow Jackets. The team finished with a 9–4–5 record for third place in league standings.

==Decline==

===1930 season===
The Yellow Jackets began to decline mainly because of financial hardships brought on by the Great Depression in 1930. Shep Royle, president of the Franklin Athletic Association, arranged for coaches Bull Behman and Wally Diehl to attend a coaching clinic in Chicago run by Glenn &quot;Pop&quot; Warner and Dick Hanley, in the hopes that it would improve their coaching techniques and develop a way to better utilize their players. At the same time, however, the Association&#x27;s management decided to retain only a few veteran players, replacing most of the squad with rookies direct from college. This resulted in a string of ten consecutive losses (eight of which were in October), the worst losing streak in Yellow Jackets history. To end the streak, Frankford purchased eleven players from the Minneapolis Red Jackets, and George Gibson took over the team&#x27;s coaching duties from Behman. The Legion Post also tried to rally to the Yellow Jackets, pledging its support. However, the effects of the economic depression and poor performance on the field combined to reduce the team&#x27;s fan base. The season finally ended with a 6–13–1 overall record and a 4–13–1 record in league play.

===Final season===
Before the start of the 1931 season, Frankford Stadium was severely damaged by a fire, forcing the club to find another location for its home games. However, most facilities suitable for professional football were already booked. The Yellow Jackets had to overcome this scheduling problem by playing at two different locations around the city of Philadelphia: Philadelphia Municipal Stadium and Baker Bowl. Philadelphia Municipal Stadium and Baker Bowl were located outside of the Frankford area, making attendance difficult for local fans. The team had hoped to draw broader support from Philadelphia at large.

Herb Joesting took over as head coach in 1931. However, the team was in terrible shape. Some members of the press began referring to the team as the Philadelphia Yellow Jackets, in an attempt to increase fan support, which failed to materialize. By October, NFL President Joe Carr, after witnessing the poor attendance at Frankford&#x27;s home loss to the Portsmouth Spartans, approved a plan for the Yellow Jackets to finish the season as a traveling team. Carr hoped that this move would allow the team to curb spending and rebound financially.

On October 26, 1931, the Yellow Jackets defeated the Chicago Bears, 13–12, at Wrigley Field. This game marked the last time a Philadelphia-based NFL team would win an away game over the Bears until October 17, 1999, when the Eagles defeated the Bears 20–16 at Soldier Field. The 1928 Yellow Jackets win over the Packers marked the last time in 51 years a Philadelphia NFL team won a road victory over the Packers; the Eagles&#x27; 1979 win at Green Bay finally ended that streak. Frankford&#x27;s 71 wins are the most by any defunct NFL team.

==Legacy==
The Frankford Athletic Association not only fielded the Yellow Jackets football team, but also the Yellow Jackets&#x27; Band and the Frankford Legion Post 211 Drum &amp; Bugle Corps. The Association also sponsored bus and train trips for fans to travel along to games in such places as Pottsville and New York City, where even the host teams&#x27; sportswriters took notice of their enthusiasm. The club occasionally sponsored half-time exhibitions by the Frankford Midgets, as well as a women&#x27;s football team. The latter is the first evidence of women playing organized football (in 1926).

During their time in the NFL, Frankford&#x27;s Ignacio Molinet became the league&#x27;s first Latino player.

Today the Philadelphia Fire Department&#x27;s Engine 14, stationed in Frankford, have adopted the Yellow Jackets moniker on their fire trucks.

==Philadelphia Eagles==
After two more games following the victory in Chicago, both shutout losses – indeed, the 1931 Yellow Jackets were shut out in every game besides the aforementioned victory – the Yellow Jackets suspended operations. Unable to find a buyer, the Frankford Athletic Association returned the franchise to the league.

The NFL spent over a year searching for a new team to operate in Philadelphia. On July 9, 1933, the NFL granted an expansion franchise to Bert Bell and Lud Wray and awarded them the assets of the failed Yellow Jackets organization, with Bell and Wray naming their team the Eagles after the symbol of Franklin Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal. This has led to assumptions that the Yellow Jackets sat out the 1932 season before returning to the league as the Eagles. However, that is not the case. Bell and Wray did not buy the Yellow Jackets team (though they acquired the Yellow Jackets&#x27; assets), but rather the NFL rights to the Philadelphia area that had formerly belonged to the Frankford Athletic Association. Due to the period of dormancy, the Eagles do not claim the Yellow Jackets&#x27; history as their own, while the NFL considers the Eagles as a 1933 expansion team for record-keeping purposes. Additionally, Bell and Wray assembled an almost entirely new team; Art Koeninger was the only player from the 1931 Yellow Jackets on the roster of the 1933 Eagles.

Despite this, in the first few years of the Eagles&#x27; existence, they wore powder blue and yellow uniforms similar to those worn by the Yellow Jackets; these are also the colors of Philadelphia&#x27;s flag. Replicas were later worn as 1934 throwbacks in a game against the Detroit Lions on September 23, 2007, as part of the team&#x27;s 75th anniversary season.

<text>The Providence Steam Rollers (also referred to as the Providence Steam Roller, the Providence Steamroller and the Providence Steamrollers) were a professional American football team based in Providence, Rhode Island in the National Football League (NFL) from 1925 to 1931. Providence was the first New England team to win an NFL championship. The Steam Roller won the league&#x27;s championship in 1928, which is the latest NFL championship win by a defunct team to date. Most of their home games were played at the Cycledrome, a 10,000-seat stadium that was built as a velodrome for bicycle races.

==History==

===Pre-NFL===
The Steam Rollers were established in 1916 by members of the &quot;Providence Journal&quot;; sports-editor Charles Coppen and part-time sports-writer Pearce Johnson. Three men shared in the ownership and management of the team: Coppen, James Dooley, and Peter Laudati. Meanwhile, Johnson stayed on as the team&#x27;s manager for each year of its existence.

The team soon became a regional power and by the mid-1920s was known as the best independent team in the country. By 1919 the team was drawing in more spectators than Brown University by a margin of 2–1, according to newspaper reports at the time. However, it seemed unlikely since the Steam Rollers crowd was on average 3,000 spectators a game. The players&#x27; wages were lower than those of Indiana and Ohio, so it was harder for the Steam Rollers to bring in &quot;ringers&quot;. Several college football players did play for the Steam Rollers, but under aliases, so as not to jeopardize their amateur status.

In 1924, Providence&#x27;s schedule featured several NFL teams. The Steam Rollers posted a 3–2–1 record against those teams, defeating the Rochester Jeffersons (3–0), Minneapolis Marines (49–0) and Dayton Triangles (10–7). Both of their losses came against the Frankford Yellow Jackets (21–10) and (16–3). The team also posted a scoreless tie against the Columbus Tigers. The 1924 Steam Rollers then went on to win the mythical &quot;undisputed championship of the Northeast&quot;. The team&#x27;s success that season was enough to make Steam Rollers management and fans start thinking about playing in the NFL.

===NFL years===

Providence joined the NFL in time for the 1925 season. By that time only three players from the 1924 team were still in the line-up when the team&#x27;s first practice of 1925 was held on September 17. In fact, only about a dozen of them wore Steam Rollers colors for the team&#x27;s debut in the NFL. The Steam Rollers played mediocre football in their first two NFL seasons, but posted a strong 8–5–1 record in 1927 with Jim Conzelman as the team&#x27;s head coach. For his per game salary of $292, Conzelman not only coached the team but also played quarterback in the single-wing formation. The star player for Providence was halfback George &quot;Wildcat&quot; Wilson, a 1925 All-American from the University of Washington who had spent the 1926 season as the head of the traveling Los Angeles Wildcats of the AFL.

====1928 championship season====

Providence opened its 1928 season against Red Grange and the New York Yankees, Wilson&#x27;s rival from the AFL. The Steam Rollers led the Yankees 20–7 at halftime and held that score throughout the second half. However, the team&#x27;s next game resulted in a 10–6 loss to the Frankford Yellow Jackets. However, the team soon rebounded with a four-game winning streak over the Dayton Triangles (28–0), Yankees (12–6), Pottsville Maroons (13–6) and Detroit Wolverines (7–0). The Steam Rollers faced the Yellow Jackets again at Frankford Stadium on November 17, which resulted in a scoreless tie. However a week later, at the Cycledrome, Providence finally avenged its only loss of the season with a 6–0 victory over the Yellow Jackets. The team would then post wins over the New York Giants (16–0) and Pottsville (7–0), before ending its season with a 7–7 tie, against the Green Bay Packers. Providence was named the 1928 NFL Champions. Prior to the 1932 season, the NFL team with the best winning percentage was named the NFL Champions. Despite the Yellow Jackets winning 3 more games than the Steam Rollers and posting an 11–3–2 record, Providence was awarded the title due to having a better winning percentage with an 8-1-2 season.

A &quot;victory banquet&quot; at the Biltmore Hotel took place a week later. At the banquet, each player was rewarded with a gold watch. It was also at this event that Conzelman was given a trophy and named the team&#x27;s &quot;Most Valuable Player&quot;. Five of the Steam Rollers players gained All-NFL honors when the league issued its official honor roll on December 23. Wildcat Wilson and Clyde Smith were named to the first team, while Curly Oden, Milt Rehnquist, and Gus Sonnenberg were placed on the second team.

====NFL firsts====
Over the course of the next seven years, the team not only won an NFL championship but also established three league &quot;firsts.&quot; In 1925, Providence was the first NFL team to play its home games in a bicycle racing stadium (a velodrome). In 1929, the Steam Rollers established two NFL &quot;firsts.&quot; In the six-day period between November 5 and November 10, 1929, Providence played four games. The marathon string began against the Staten Island Stapletons, the Chicago Cardinals and concluded with a two-game series against the Frankford Yellow Jackets. Although the Steam Rollers made history, their 0–3–1 record during that six-day stretch proved to be a scheduling disaster. During the second game of that four-game series, Providence hosted the Cardinals on November 6. The game was played at night at nearby Kinsley Park, where floodlights recently had been installed. The teams had originally been scheduled to play on Sunday, November 3, but heavy rains made the Cycledrome field unplayable. Since neither team wanted to lose a payday, the historic night game was hastily scheduled. Because of this, Providence made history again by being the first team to host an NFL game at night under floodlights. Although the Steam Rollers lost 16–0, the game was declared a success because 6,000 fans attended.

===Decline===
Despite their 1928 championship, the team experienced troubles in 1929. On January 4, 1929, Sonnenberg defeated Strangler Lewis in two straight falls to capture the world heavyweight championship in professional wrestling. This caused Sonnenberg to stay out of football, as he could make better money defending his title. Meanwhile, Oden quit pro football to take a job with an insurance company in Boston, and Smith decided to return to his native Missouri and coach football. Conzelman also didn&#x27;t fully recover from a knee injury sustained in 1928. Rehnquist missed the first half of the season due to illness, and Wildcat Wilson became complacent and turned into an ordinary back. The 1929 Steam Rollers team struggled to a 4–6–2 record, resulting in a 7th place league finish. This caused the fans, who attended each game during the championship season, to stay home. The team posted a 6–4–1 record in 1930 and a 4–4–3 record in 1931.

The lack of interest, coupled with the Great Depression in 1930, caused Dooley, Coppen and Laudati to suspend operations after the 1931 season. The three owners then gave up and turned the franchise back over to the NFL in 1933.

==Name origin==
During halftime against a game between the Steam Rollers and the Providence Pros, Charles Coppen, who was getting a hot dog, heard a remark that the opposing team was &quot;getting steam-rolled&quot;. Coppen loved the remark so much he named his team the Steam Rollers.

==Other Steam Roller teams==
A team known as the Providence Huskies (the Steam Roller had used a husky-like dog as their mascot, so this team may have been a continuation of or successor to the Steam Roller) played during the 1933 season. The Huskies earned a perfect season, the only season in the professional or semi-professional record books to have not allowed their opponents to score a single point over an entire season. In 1936 an unrelated Providence Steam Roller team played in the New England Football League for one season.

The Steam Roller name was revived by Pearce Johnson, one of the original team&#x27;s founders. The subsequent Steamrollers played on a near-continuous basis since that point as a semi-pro, minor league, and independent team until 1942, when it moved to Springfield and became the &quot;Springfield Steamroller&quot; for 1943, and suspended operations shortly thereafter. The last three seasons of a &quot;Providence Steamrollers&quot; team were as a member of the Atlantic Coast Football League; in 1962, the Steamroller team was the league&#x27;s runner-up, losing in the championship to the Paterson Miners in a double-overtime decision. The assets of the ACFL Steam Roller were bought and taken to the Continental Football League as the Rhode Island Indians, where the team played one last season in 1965. After the 1965 season, the team&#x27;s franchise rights were turned over to famed baseball player Jackie Robinson and became the &quot;Brooklyn Dodgers,&quot; which lasted one season.

A Basketball Association of America franchise was also called the Providence Steamrollers. The Steamrollers played for three seasons, beginning in 1946–1947.

The name was revived again in 1988 for an Arena Football League team, the New England Steamrollers.

A rare home movie showing the Providence Steamrollers playing the Framingham Lion Tamers was recently discovered and preserved by Northeast Historic Film, a regional moving image archive in New England.

<text>Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a blockage of an artery in the lungs by a substance that has moved from elsewhere in the body through the bloodstream (embolism). Symptoms of a PE may include shortness of breath, chest pain particularly upon breathing in, and coughing up blood. Symptoms of a blood clot in the leg may also be present, such as a red, warm, swollen, and painful leg. Signs of a PE include low blood oxygen levels, rapid breathing, rapid heart rate, and sometimes a mild fever. Severe cases can lead to passing out, abnormally low blood pressure, obstructive shock, and sudden death.
PE usually results from a blood clot in the leg that travels to the lung. The risk of blood clots is increased by advanced age, cancer, prolonged bed rest and immobilization, smoking, stroke, long-haul travel over 4 hours, certain genetic conditions, estrogen-based medication, pregnancy, obesity, trauma or bone fracture, and after some types of surgery. A small proportion of cases are due to the embolization of air, fat, or amniotic fluid. Diagnosis is based on signs and symptoms in combination with test results. If the risk is low, a blood test known as a D-dimer may rule out the condition. Otherwise, a CT pulmonary angiography, lung ventilation/perfusion scan, or ultrasound of the legs may confirm the diagnosis. Together, deep vein thrombosis and PE are known as venous thromboembolism (VTE).
Efforts to prevent PE include beginning to move as soon as possible after surgery, lower leg exercises during periods of sitting, and the use of blood thinners after some types of surgery. Treatment is with anticoagulant medications such as heparin, warfarin, or one of the direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs). These are recommended to be taken for at least three months. However, treatment using low-molecular-weight heparin is not recommended for those at high risk of bleeding or those with renal failure. Severe cases may require thrombolysis using medication such as tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) given intravenously or through a catheter, and some may require surgery (a pulmonary thrombectomy). If blood thinners are not appropriate or safe to use, a temporary vena cava filter may be used.
Pulmonary emboli affect about 430,000 people each year in Europe. In the United States, between 300,000 and 600,000 cases occur each year, which contribute to at least 40,000 deaths. Rates are similar in males and females. They become more common as people get older.
==Signs and symptoms==
Symptoms of pulmonary embolism are typically sudden in onset and may include one or many of the following: dyspnea (shortness of breath), tachypnea (rapid breathing), chest pain of a &quot;pleuritic&quot; nature (worsened by breathing), cough and hemoptysis (coughing up blood). More severe cases can include signs such as cyanosis (blue discoloration, usually of the lips and fingers), collapse, and circulatory instability because of decreased blood flow through the lungs and into the left side of the heart. About 15% of all cases of sudden death are attributable to PE. While PE may present with syncope (fainting), less than 1% of syncope cases are due to PE.

On physical examination, the lungs are usually normal. Occasionally, a pleural friction rub may be audible over the affected area of the lung (mostly in PE with infarct). A pleural effusion is sometimes present that is exudative (fluid that leaks out of blood vessels). This is detectable by decreased percussion note, audible breath sounds, and vocal resonance. The strain on the right ventricle may be detected as a left parasternal heave, a loud pulmonary component of the second heart sound, or raised jugular venous pressure. A low-grade fever may be present, particularly if there is associated pulmonary hemorrhage or infarction. 

As smaller pulmonary emboli tend to lodge in more peripheral areas without collateral circulation, they are more likely to cause lung infarction and small effusions (both of which are painful), but not hypoxia, dyspnea, or hemodynamic instability such as tachycardia. Larger PEs, which tend to lodge centrally, typically cause dyspnea, hypoxia, low blood pressure, fast heart rate and fainting, but are often painless because there is no lung infarction due to collateral circulation. The classic presentation for PE with pleuritic pain, dyspnea, and tachycardia is likely caused by a large fragmented embolism causing both large and small PEs. Thus, small PEs are often missed because they cause pleuritic pain alone without any other findings and large PEs are often missed because they are painless and mimic other conditions often causing ECG changes and small rises in troponin and brain natriuretic peptide levels.

PEs are sometimes described as massive, submassive, and nonmassive depending on the clinical signs and symptoms. Although the exact definitions of these are unclear, an accepted definition of massive PE is one in which there is hemodynamic instability. This is a cause of obstructive shock, which presents as sustained low blood pressure, slowed heart rate, or pulselessness.

==Risk factors==

About 90% of emboli are from a deep vein thrombosis located above the knee termed a proximal DVT, which includes an iliofemoral DVT. The rare venous thoracic outlet syndrome can also be a cause of DVTs, especially in young men without significant risk factors. DVTs are at risk for dislodging and migrating to the lung circulation. The conditions are generally regarded as a continuum known as a venous thromboembolism (VTE).

VTE is much more common in immunocompromised individuals as well as individuals with comorbidities including:
* Those that undergo orthopedic surgery at or below the hip without prophylaxis.
** This is due to immobility during or after the surgery, as well as venous damage during the surgery.
* Pancreatic and colon cancer patients (other forms of cancer also can be factors, but these are the most common)
** This is due to the release of procoagulants.
*** The risk of VTE is at its greatest during diagnosis and treatment but lowers in remission.
* Patients with high-grade tumors
* Pregnant women
** As the body puts itself into what is known as a &quot;hypercoagulable state&quot; the risk of a hemorrhage during childbirth is decreased and is regulated by increased expression of factors VII, VIII, X, Von Willebrand, and fibrinogen.
* Those on estrogen medication
** No linkage has been found to those taking progestin-only oral contraceptives.

The development of thrombosis is classically due to a group of causes named Virchow&#x27;s triad (alterations in blood flow, factors in the vessel wall, and factors affecting the properties of the blood). Often, more than one risk factor is present.
* &quot;Alterations in blood flow&quot;: immobilization (after surgery, long-haul flight), injury, pregnancy (also procoagulant), obesity (also procoagulant), cancer (also procoagulant)
* &quot;Factors in the vessel wall&quot;: surgery, catheterizations causing direct injury (&quot;endothelial injury&quot;)
* &quot;Factors affecting the properties of the blood&quot; (procoagulant state):
** Estrogen-containing medication (transgender hormone therapy, menopausal hormone therapy and hormonal contraceptives)
** Genetic thrombophilia (factor V Leiden, prothrombin mutation G20210A, protein C deficiency, protein S deficiency, antithrombin deficiency, hyperhomocysteinemia and plasminogen/fibrinolysis disorders)
** Acquired thrombophilia (antiphospholipid syndrome, nephrotic syndrome, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria)
** Cancer (due to secretion of pro-coagulants)
Although most pulmonary embolisms are the result of proximal DVTs, there are still many other risk factors that can also result in a pulmonary embolism.
* Risk factors include:
** Varicose veins caused by vascular damage
** Pulmonary hypertension
** Diabetes
** Traumatic hip fractures that immobilize the patient
** Joint fixation (primarily in the legs)

===Underlying causes===
After a first PE, the search for secondary causes is usually brief. Only when a second PE occurs, and especially when this happens while still under anticoagulant therapy, a further search for underlying conditions is undertaken. This will include testing (&quot;thrombophilia screen&quot;) for Factor V Leiden mutation, antiphospholipid antibodies, protein C and S and antithrombin levels, and later prothrombin mutation, MTHFR mutation, Factor VIII concentration and rarer inherited coagulation abnormalities.

==Diagnosis==
To diagnose a pulmonary embolism, a review of clinical criteria to determine the need for testing is recommended. In those who have low risk, age less than 50, heart rate less than 100 beats per minute, oxygen level more than 94% on room air, and no leg swelling, coughing up of blood, surgery or trauma in the last four weeks, previous blood clots, or estrogen use, further testing is not typically needed.

In situations with more high-risk individuals, further testing is needed. A CT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) is the preferred method for the diagnosis of a pulmonary embolism due to its easy administration and accuracy. Although a CTPA is preferred, other tests can be done. For example, a proximal lower limb compression ultrasound (CUS) can be used. This is a test that is primarily used as a confirmatory test, meaning it confirms a previous analysis showing the presence or suspected presence of a pulmonary embolism. According to a cross-sectional study, CUS tests have a sensitivity of 41% and specificity of 96%.

If there are concerns this is followed by testing to determine a likelihood of being able to confirm a diagnosis by imaging, followed by imaging if other tests have shown that there is a likelihood of a PE diagnosis.

The diagnosis of PE is based primarily on validated clinical criteria combined with selective testing because the typical clinical presentation (shortness of breath, chest pain) cannot be definitively differentiated from other causes of chest pain and shortness of breath. The decision to perform medical imaging is based on clinical reasoning, that is the medical history, symptoms, and findings on physical examination, followed by an assessment of clinical probability.

===Probability testing===
The most commonly used method to predict clinical probability, the Wells score, is a clinical prediction rule, whose use is complicated by multiple versions being available. In 1995, Philip Steven Wells, initially developed a prediction rule (based on a literature search) to predict the likelihood of DVT, based on clinical criteria. A new prediction score for PE was created in 1998 This prediction rule was revised by Wells &quot;et al.&quot; in 2000. In the 2000 publication, Wells proposed two different scoring systems using cutoffs of 2 or 4 with the same prediction rule, and also included D-dimer testing in the rule-out of PE in low probability patients. In 2001, Wells published results using the more conservative cutoff of 2 to create three categories. An additional version, the &quot;modified extended version&quot;, using the more recent cutoff of 2 but including findings from Wells&#x27;s initial studies were proposed. Most recently, a further study reverted to Wells&#x27;s earlier use of a cutoff of 4 points to create only two categories.

There are additional prediction rules for PE, such as the Geneva rule. More importantly, the use of &quot;any&quot; rule is associated with reduction in recurrent thromboembolism.

&quot;The Wells score&quot;:
* clinically suspected DVT – 3.0 points
* alternative diagnosis is less likely than PE – 3.0 points
* tachycardia (heart rate &gt; 100) – 1.5 points
* immobilization (≥ 3d)/surgery in previous four weeks – 1.5 points
* history of DVT or PE – 1.5 points
* hemoptysis – 1.0 points
* malignancy (with treatment within six months) or palliative – 1.0 points

Traditional interpretation
* Score &gt;6.0 – High (probability 59% based on pooled data)
* Score 2.0 to 6.0 – Moderate (probability 29% based on pooled data)
* Score &lt;2.0 – Low (probability 15% based on pooled data)

Alternative interpretation
* Score &gt; 4 – PE likely. Consider diagnostic imaging.
* Score 4 or less – PE unlikely. Consider D-dimer to rule out PE.

Recommendations for a diagnostic algorithm were published by the PIOPED investigators; however, these recommendations do not reflect research using 64-slice MDCT. These investigators recommended:
* Low clinical probability. If negative D-dimer, PE is excluded. If positive D-dimer, obtain MDCT and base treatment on results.
* Moderate clinical probability. If negative D-dimer, PE is excluded. &quot;However&quot;, the authors were not concerned that a negative MDCT with negative D-dimer in this setting has a 5% probability of being false. Presumably, the 5% error rate will fall as 64-slice MDCT is more commonly used. If positive D-dimer, obtain MDCT and base treatment on results.
* High clinical probability. Proceed to MDCT. If positive, treat, if negative, more tests are needed to exclude PE. A D-dimer of less than 750 ug/L does not rule out PE in those who are at high risk.

====Pulmonary embolism rule-out criteria====
The pulmonary embolism rule-out criteria (PERC) helps assess people in whom pulmonary embolism is suspected, but unlikely. Unlike the Wells score and Geneva score, which are clinical prediction rules intended to risk stratify people with suspected PE, the PERC rule is designed to rule out the risk of PE in people when the physician has already stratified them into a low-risk category.

People in this low-risk category without any of these criteria may undergo no further testing for PE: low oxygen saturations – SaO2 &lt;95%, unilateral leg swelling, coughing up blood, prior DVT or PE, recent surgery or trauma, age &gt;50, hormone use, fast heart rate. The rationale behind this decision is that further testing (specifically CT angiogram of the chest) may cause more harm (from radiation exposure and contrast dye) than the risk of PE. The PERC rule has a sensitivity of 97.4% and specificity of 21.9% with a false negative rate of 1.0% (16/1666).

===Blood tests===
In people with a low or moderate suspicion of PE, a normal D-dimer level (shown in a blood test) is enough to exclude the possibility of thrombotic PE, with a three-month risk of thromboembolic events being 0.14%. D-dimer is highly sensitive but not specific (specificity around 50%). In other words, a positive D-dimer is not synonymous with PE, but a negative D-dimer is, with a good degree of certainty, an indication of absence of a PE. A low pretest probability is also valuable in ruling out PE. The typical cut off is 500 μg/L, although this varies based on the assay. However, in those over the age of 50, changing the cut-off value to the person&#x27;s age multiplied by 10 μg/L (accounting for assay which has been used) is recommended as it decreases the number of falsely positive tests without missing any additional cases of PE.

When a PE is being suspected, several blood tests are done to exclude important secondary causes of PE. This includes a full blood count, clotting status (PT, aPTT, TT), and some screening tests (erythrocyte sedimentation rate, kidney function, liver enzymes, electrolytes). If one of these is abnormal, further investigations might be warranted to the issue.

Troponin levels are increased in between 16 and 47% with pulmonary embolism.

===Imaging===
In typical people who are not known to be at high risk of PE, imaging is helpful to confirm or exclude a diagnosis of PE after simpler first-line tests are used. Medical societies recommend tests such as the D-dimer to first provide supporting evidence for the need for imaging, and imaging would be done if other tests confirmed a moderate or high probability of finding evidence to support a diagnosis of PE.

CT pulmonary angiography is the recommended first-line diagnostic imaging test for most people.

Ultrasound of the legs can confirm the presence of a PE but cannot rule it out.

====CT pulmonary angiography====
CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) is a pulmonary angiogram obtained using computed tomography (CT) with radiocontrast rather than right heart catheterization. Its advantages are that it is accurate, it is non-invasive, it is more often available, and it may identify other lung disorders in case there is no pulmonary embolism. The accuracy and non-invasive nature of CTPA also make it advantageous for people who are pregnant.

Assessing the accuracy of CT pulmonary angiography is hindered by the rapid changes in the number of rows of detectors available in multidetector CT (MDCT) machines. According to a cohort study, single-slice spiral CT may help diagnose detection among people with suspected pulmonary embolism. In this study, the sensitivity was 69% and specificity was 84%. In this study which had a prevalence of detection was 32%, the positive predictive value of 67.0% and negative predictive value of 85.2%. However, this study&#x27;s results may be biased due to possible incorporation bias, since the CT scan was the final diagnostic tool in people with pulmonary embolism. The authors noted that a negative single-slice CT scan is insufficient to rule out pulmonary embolism on its own. A separate study with a mixture of 4-slice and 16-slice scanners reported a sensitivity of 83% and a specificity of 96%, which means that it is a good test for ruling out a pulmonary embolism if it is not seen on imaging and that it is very good at confirming a pulmonary embolism is present if it is seen. This study noted that additional testing is necessary when the clinical probability is inconsistent with the imaging results. CTPA is non-inferior to VQ scanning, and identifies more emboli (without necessarily improving the outcome) compared to VQ scanning.

====Ventilation/perfusion scan====

A ventilation/perfusion scan (or V/Q scan or lung scintigraphy) shows that some areas of the lung are being ventilated but not perfused with blood (due to obstruction by a clot). This type of examination is as accurate as multislice CT, but is less used, due to the greater availability of CT technology. It is particularly useful in people who have an allergy to iodinated contrast, impaired kidney function, or are pregnant (due to its lower radiation exposure as compared to CT). The test can be performed with planar two-dimensional imaging, or single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) which enables three-dimensional imaging. Hybrid devices combining SPECT and CT (SPECT/CT) further enable anatomic characterization of any abnormality.

====Low probability diagnostic tests/non-diagnostic tests====
Tests that are frequently done that are not sensitive for PE, but can be diagnostic.
* Chest X-rays are often done on people with shortness of breath to help rule out other causes, such as congestive heart failure and rib fracture. Chest X-rays in PE are rarely normal, but usually lack signs that suggest the diagnosis of PE (for example, Westermark sign, Hampton&#x27;s hump).
* Ultrasonography of the legs, also known as leg doppler, in search of deep venous thrombosis (DVT). The presence of DVT, as shown on ultrasonography of the legs, is in itself enough to warrant anticoagulation, without requiring the V/Q or spiral CT scans (because of the strong association between DVT and PE). This may be a valid approach in pregnancy, in which the other modalities would increase the risk of birth defects in the unborn child. However, a negative scan does not rule out PE, and low-radiation dose scanning may be required if the mother is deemed at high risk of having a pulmonary embolism. The main use of ultrasonography of the legs is therefore in those with clinical symptoms suggestive of deep vein thrombosis.

====Fluoroscopic pulmonary angiography====

Historically, the gold standard for diagnosis was pulmonary angiography by fluoroscopy, but this has fallen into disuse with the increased availability of non-invasive techniques that offer similar diagnostic accuracy.

===Electrocardiogram===

The primary use of the ECG is to rule out other causes of chest pain. An electrocardiogram (ECG) is routinely done on people with chest pain to quickly diagnose myocardial infarctions (heart attacks), an important differential diagnosis in an individual with chest pain. While certain ECG changes may occur with PE, none are specific enough to confirm or sensitive enough to rule out the diagnosis. An ECG may show signs of right heart strain or acute cor pulmonale in cases of large PEs – the classic signs are a large S wave in lead I, a large Q wave in lead III, and an inverted T wave in lead III (S1Q3T3), which occurs in 12–50% of people with the diagnosis, yet also occurs in 12% without the diagnosis.

This is occasionally present (occurring in up to 20% of people), but may also occur in other acute lung conditions, and, therefore, has limited diagnostic value. The most commonly seen signs in the ECG are sinus tachycardia, right axis deviation, and right bundle branch block. Sinus tachycardia, however, is still only found in 8–69% of people with PE.

ECG findings associated with pulmonary emboli may suggest a worse prognosis since the six findings identified with RV strain on ECG (heart rate &gt; 100 beats per minute, S1Q3T3, inverted T waves in leads V1-V4, ST elevation in aVR, complete right bundle branch block, and atrial fibrillation) are associated with increased risk of circulatory shock and death.

Cases with inverted T in leads V1-3 are suspected of PE or inferior myocardial infarction. PE cases show inverted T waves in leads II and aVF, but inferior myocardial infarction cases do not show inverted T waves in II and aVF.

===Echocardiography===

In massive and submassive PE, dysfunction of the right side of the heart may be seen on echocardiography, an indication that the pulmonary artery is severely obstructed and the right ventricle, a low-pressure pump, is unable to match the pressure. Some studies (see below) suggest that this finding may be an indication for thrombolysis. Not every person with a (suspected) pulmonary embolism requires an echocardiogram, but elevations in cardiac troponins or brain natriuretic peptide may indicate heart strain and warrant an echocardiogram, and be important in prognosis.

The specific appearance of the right ventricle on echocardiography is referred to as the &quot;McConnell&#x27;s sign&quot;. This is the finding of akinesia of the mid-free wall but a normal motion of the apex. This phenomenon has a 77% sensitivity and a 94% specificity for the diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism in the setting of right ventricular dysfunction.

==Prevention==

Pulmonary embolism may be preventable in those with risk factors. People admitted to the hospital may receive preventative medication, including unfractionated heparin, low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), or fondaparinux, and anti-thrombosis stockings to reduce the risk of a DVT in the leg that could dislodge and migrate to the lungs.

Following the completion of anticoagulation in those with prior PE, long-term aspirin is useful to prevent recurrence.

==Treatment==
Anticoagulant therapy is the mainstay of treatment. Acutely, supportive treatments, such as oxygen or analgesia, may be required. People are often admitted to hospital in the early stages of treatment and tend to remain under inpatient care until the INR has reached therapeutic levels (if warfarin is used). Increasingly, however, low-risk cases are managed at home in a fashion already common in the treatment of DVT. Evidence to support one approach versus the other is weak.

===Anticoagulation===
Anticoagulant therapy is the mainstay of treatment. For many years, vitamin K antagonists (warfarin or less commonly acenocoumarol or phenprocoumon) have been the cornerstone. As vitamin K antagonists do not act immediately, initial treatment is with rapidly acting injectable anticoagulants: unfractionated heparin (UFH), low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), or fondaparinux, while oral vitamin K antagonists are initiated and titrated (usually as part of inpatient hospital care) to the international normalized ratio, a test that determines the dose. In terms of injectable treatments, LMWH may reduce bleeding among people with pulmonary embolism as compared to UFH. According to the same review, LMWH reduced the incidence of recurrent thrombotic complications and reduced thrombus size when compared to heparin. There was no difference in overall mortality between participants treated with LMWH and those treated with unfractionated heparin. Vitamin K antagonists require frequent dose adjustment and monitoring of the international normalized ratio (INR). In PE, INRs between 2.0 and 3.0 are generally considered ideal. If another episode of PE occurs under warfarin treatment, the INR window may be increased to e.g. 2.5–3.5 (unless there are contraindications) or anticoagulation may be changed to a different anticoagulant e.g. LMWH.

In recent years, many anticoagulants have been introduced that offer similar to warfarin but without a need for titration to the INR. Known as the directly acting oral anticoagulants, these treatments are now preferred over vitamin K antagonists by American professional guidelines. Two of these (rivaroxaban and apixaban) do not require initial heparin or fondaparinux treatment, whereas dabigatran and edoxaban do. A Cochrane review found that there is no evidence of a difference between oral DTIs (dabigatran, rivaroxaban, edoxaban, apixaban) and standard anticoagulation in the prevention of recurrent pulmonary embolism.

In people with cancer who develop pulmonary embolism, therapy with a course of LMWH is favored over warfarin or other oral anticoagulants. Similarly, pregnant women are treated with low molecular weight heparin until after delivery to avoid the known teratogenic effects of warfarin, especially in the early stages of pregnancy, but it can be used while breastfeeding.

Anticoagulation therapy is usually continued for 3–6 months, or &quot;lifelong&quot; if there have been previous DVTs or PEs, or none of the usual transient risk factors is present. In those without a known cause that can be reversed 2 years of treatment may be better than 6 months. For those with small PEs (known as subsegmental PEs) the effects of anticoagulation are unknown as it has not been properly studied as of 2020.

===Thrombolysis===
Massive PE causing hemodynamic instability (shock and/or low blood pressure, defined as a systolic blood pressure &lt;90 mmHg or a pressure drop of 40 mmHg for &gt;15 min if not caused by new-onset arrhythmia, hypovolemia, or sepsis) is an indication for thrombolysis, the enzymatic destruction of the clot with medication. In this situation, it is the best available treatment for those without contraindications and is supported by clinical guidelines. It is also recommended in those in cardiac arrest with a known PE. Catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) is a new technique found to be relatively safe and effective for massive PEs. This involves accessing the venous system by placing a catheter into a vein in the groin and guiding it through the veins by using fluoroscopic imaging until it is located next to the PE in the lung circulation. Medication that breaks up blood clots is released through the catheter so that its highest concentration is directly next to the pulmonary embolus. CDT is performed by interventional radiologists or vascular surgeons, and in medical centers that offer CDT, it may be offered as a first-line treatment. Catheter-based ultrasound-assisted thrombolysis is being investigated.

The use of thrombolysis in non-massive PEs is still debated. Some have found that the treatment decreases the risk of death and increases the risk of bleeding including intracranial hemorrhage. Others have found no decrease in the risk of death.

===Inferior vena cava filter===

There are two situations when an inferior vena cava filter is considered advantageous, and those are if anticoagulant therapy is contraindicated (e.g. shortly after a major operation), or a person has a pulmonary embolus despite being anticoagulated. In these instances, it may be implanted to prevent new or existing DVTs from entering the pulmonary artery and combining with an existing blockage. Despite the device&#x27;s theoretical advantage of preventing pulmonary emboli, there is a lack of evidence supporting its effectiveness.

Inferior vena cava filters should be removed as soon as it becomes safe to start using anticoagulation. Although modern filters are meant to be retrievable, complications may prevent some from being removed. The long-term safety profile of permanently leaving a filter inside the body is not known.

===Surgery===
Surgical management of acute pulmonary embolism (pulmonary thrombectomy) is uncommon and has largely been abandoned because of poor long-term outcomes. However, recently, it has gone through a resurgence with the revision of the surgical technique and is thought to benefit certain people. Chronic pulmonary embolism leading to pulmonary hypertension (known as &quot;chronic thromboembolic hypertension&quot;) is treated with a surgical procedure known as a pulmonary thromboendarterectomy.

==Prognosis==

Fewer than 5 to 10% of symptomatic PEs are fatal within the first hour of symptoms.

There are several markers used for risk stratification and these are also independent predictors of adverse outcomes. These include hypotension, cardiogenic shock, syncope, evidence of right heart dysfunction, and elevated cardiac enzymes. Some ECG changes including S1Q3T3 also correlate with a worse short-term prognosis. There have been other patient-related factors such as COPD and chronic heart failure thought to also play a role in prognosis.

Prognosis depends on the amount of lung that is affected and on the co-existence of other medical conditions; chronic embolisation to the lung can lead to pulmonary hypertension. After a massive PE, the embolus must be resolved somehow if the patient is to survive. In thrombotic PE, the blood clot may be broken down by fibrinolysis, or it may be organized and recanalized so that a new channel forms through the clot. Blood flow is restored most rapidly in the first day or two after a PE. Improvement slows thereafter and some deficits may be permanent. There is controversy over whether small subsegmental PEs need treatment at all and some evidence exists that patients with subsegmental PEs may do well without treatment.

Once anticoagulation is stopped, the risk of a fatal pulmonary embolism is 0.5% per year.

Mortality from untreated PEs was said to be 26%. This figure comes from a trial published in 1960 by Barrit and Jordan, which compared anticoagulation against a placebo for the management of PE. Barritt and Jordan performed their study in the Bristol Royal Infirmary in 1957. This study is the only placebo-controlled trial ever to examine the place of anticoagulants in the treatment of PE, the results of which were so convincing that the trial has never been repeated as to do so would be considered unethical. That said, the reported mortality rate of 26% in the placebo group is probably an overstatement, given that the technology of the day may have detected only severe PEs.

===Predicting mortality===

The PESI and sPESI (= simplified Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index) scoring tools can estimate the mortality of patients. The Geneva prediction rules and Wells criteria are used to calculate the pre-test probability of patients to predict who has a pulmonary embolism. These scores are tools to be used with clinical judgment in deciding diagnostic testing and types of therapy. The PESI algorithm comprises 11 routinely available clinical variables. It puts the subjects into one of five classes (I–V), with 30-day mortality ranging from 1.1% to 24.5%. Those in classes I and II are low-risk and those in classes III–V are high-risk.

==Epidemiology==
There are roughly 10 million cases of pulmonary embolisms per year. In the United States, pulmonary embolisms are the primary cause of at least 10,000 to 12,000 deaths per year and a contributing cause in at least 30,000 to 40,000 deaths per year. True incidence involving pulmonary embolisms is unknown because they often go undiagnosed or unnoticed until autopsy. From 1993 to 2012, there has been an increase in the number of admissions in hospitals due to pulmonary embolisms, jumping from 23 cases per 100,000 people to 65 cases per 100,000 people. Despite this increase, there has been a decrease in mortality during that same period due to medical advances that have occurred.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE), a common risk factor, is present at much higher rates in those over the age of 70 (three times higher compared to those aged 45 to 69). This is likely due to there being a generally lower level of activity among the elderly, resulting in higher rates of immobility and obesity. VTE has a large, and continuously rising, case fatality rate. This rate is roughly 10% after 30 days, 15% after three months, and up to 20% after one year. Pulmonary embolisms alone (when resulting in hospitalizations) have a case fatality rate of about 5% to 10% so VTE can play a large factor in the severity of the embolisms.

When looking at all cases, the rate of fatal pulmonary emboli has declined from 6% to 2% over the last 25 years in the United States. In Europe, an average of approximately 40,000 deaths per year with pulmonary embolism as the primary cause was reported between 2013 and 2015, a conservative estimate because of potential underdiagnosis.
