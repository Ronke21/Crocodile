<text>Cimexomys is an extinct North American mammal that lived from the Upper Cretaceous to the Paleocene. For a while, it shared the world with dinosaurs, but outlived them. It was a member of the extinct order Multituberculata and lies within the suborder Cimolodonta. It is perhaps a member of the Paracimexomys group, though it is not certain.

The genus &quot;Cimexomys&quot; (&quot;bug mouse&quot;) was named by Sloan and Van Valen in 1965. Most remains are restricted to teeth. &quot;Cimex&quot; means &quot;bug&quot;, with reference to the type locality of &quot;Cimexomys minor&quot; in the Bug Creek Anthills in Montana, United States.

The inclusion of &quot;Cimexomys&quot; in the Paracimexomys group is tentative, (Kielan-Jaworowska &amp; Hurum, 2001, p. 403). Some species are termed here as &quot;Cimexomys&quot;, and they&#x27;re listed towards the end. New species have previously been christened with great enthusiasm, and much reidentification has also occurred.

==Species==

Further names include &quot;&quot;Cimexomys&quot; bellus&quot;, &quot;&quot;C.&quot; clarki&quot; and &quot;&quot;C.&quot; electus&quot;.

=== &quot;Cimexomys arapahoensis&quot; ===

Age: Lower Paleocene of the Denver Formation in Colorado (United States)&lt;br&gt;
&quot;&quot;C. arapahoensis&quot; is known from four dental and mandiblar fossils from the Alexander Locality of the Denver Formation (Colorado) and is the largest known species of &quot;Cimexomyx&quot;. I estimated its mass at about 120 g based on its lower first molar.&quot; (Eric W. Dewar, 2002) &quot;C. minor&quot; has also been identified from this location.

=== &quot;Cimexomys gratus&quot; ===

Age: Puercan (Paleocene) of the Polecat Bench Formation in Wyoming (USA). This animal weighed about 130 g, about five mice or a third of a rat.

=== &quot;Cimexomys judithae&quot; ===

This species (Sahni A. 1972) is also known as &quot;Paracymexomys judithae&quot; (Archibald J.D. 1982). Fossils come from the Campanian (Upper Cretaceous) of the Two Medicine Formation of Montana (USA). A near complete dentition and skeletal elements were discovered at Egg Mountain, a site associated with a dinosaur nesting colony, though this wasn&#x27;t the original material. &quot;C. judithae&quot; is reportedly more derived than other species, and the integrity of the genus is suspect, (as reflected here by the later entries for &quot;Cimexomys&quot;). Montellano reassigned this species to the cimex genus in 1992. The body mass is estimated to have been around 20 g.

Based on the new material from Montana, the authors &quot;argued that &quot;Cimexomys&quot; is too primitive to be included among either the Taeniolabidoidea or Ptilodontoidea. This agrees with our conclusion as we tentatively place &quot;Cimexomys&quot; in the informal &quot;Paracimexomys group&quot;, which we erect for plesiomorphic (basal), poorly known members of the Cimolodonta&quot;, (Kielan-Jaworowska &amp; Hurum, 2001, p. 393).

=== &quot;Cimexomys minor&quot; ===
(Sloan R.E. and Van Valen L. 1965)&lt;br&gt;
Age: Upper Cretaceous - Lower Paleocene&lt;br&gt;
Place: Hell Creek Formation, Montana and Denver Formation, Colorado (USA) and Ravenscrag Formation, Saskatchewan (Canada). Remains are small teeth of an eighth to a tenth of an inch in length. The animal weighed about 25 g, the same as a standard mouse.

===&quot;&quot;Cimexomys&quot; antiquus&quot;===
(Fox R.C. 1971). Fossils are known from the Santonian (Upper Cretaceous) of Utah. The type fossil is in Alberta, Canada. It weighed about 30 g.

===&quot;Cimexomys gregoryi&quot;===
Fossil remains of the species &quot;&quot;Cimexomys&quot; gregoryi&quot; (Eaton J.G. 1993) have been found in Campanian (Upper Cretaceous)-aged strata in the USA. This species shows similarities to the genus &quot;Bryceomys&quot;.

<text>Oulu ( , ; ) is a city in Finland and the regional capital of North Ostrobothnia. It is located on the northwestern coast of the country at the mouth of the River Oulu. The population of Oulu is approximately , while the sub-region has a population of approximately . It is the most populous municipality in Finland, and the fourth most populous urban area in the country. Oulu is also the most populous city in Northern Finland.

Oulu&#x27;s neighbouring municipalities are: Hailuoto, Ii, Kempele, Liminka, Lumijoki, Muhos, Pudasjärvi, Tyrnävä and Utajärvi. Oulu is the third northernmost city in the world with a population of over 100,000, after Murmansk and Norilsk in Russia.

Due to its large population and geopolitical, economic and cultural-historical position, Oulu has been called the &quot;capital of Northern Finland&quot;. Oulu is also considered one of Europe&#x27;s &quot;living labs&quot;, where residents experiment with new technologies (such as NFC tags and ubi-screens) on a community-wide scale. Although only in the top 2% of universities, the University of Oulu is regionally renowned in the field of information technology. Oulu has also been very successful in recent city image surveys; in a study published by the Finnish Economic Survey in 2008, Oulu received the best image rating among large cities in the country, including ratings from respondents in all provinces. In the 2023 T-Media survey, Oulu was tied with Kuopio as the second most attractive city in Finland, while Tampere was ranked first.

Once known for wood tar and salmon, Oulu has become a major high-tech centre, particularly in IT and wellness technology. Other important industries include wood processing, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, paper and steel.

Oulu has been selected as the European Capital of Culture for 2026.

==Etymology==
The city is named after the river Oulujoki, which originates in the lake Oulujärvi. There have been a number of other theories for the origin of the name &quot;Oulu&quot;. One possible source is a word in the Sami language meaning &#x27;flood water&#x27;, but there are other suggestions. At minimum, the structure of the word requires that, if originally given by speakers of a Uralic language, the name must be a derivative. In all likelihood, it also predates Finnish settlement and is thus a loanword from one of the now-extinct Saami languages once spoken in the area.

The most probable theory is that the name derives from the Finnish dialectal word &quot;oulu&quot;, meaning &quot;floodwater&quot;, which is related to e.g. Southern Sami &quot;åulo&quot;, meaning &quot;melted snow&quot;, &quot;åulot&quot; meaning &quot;thaw&quot; (of unknown ultimate origin). Two other word families have also been speculated to be related. The first is seen in the Northern Savo dialectal word &quot;uula&quot; and its Sami counterpart &quot;oalli&quot;, both meaning &quot;river channel&quot;. The second is the Uralic root reconstructed as *&quot;uwa&quot;, meaning &quot;river bed&quot; (reflected as &quot;vuo&quot; in modern Finnish, also in derivatives such as &quot;vuolas&quot; &quot;heavy-flowing&quot;). To either of these roots, some Sami variety would have to be assumed having added further derivational suffixes.

==History==

Oulu is situated by the Gulf of Bothnia, at the mouth of river Oulujoki, which is an ancient trading site. 

Following the Treaty of Nöteborg in 1323, the status of Oulu was disputed in its ownership, as both the Novgorod Republic and the Kingdom of Sweden held much influence. In 1345, the Kingdom of Sweden annexed territory up to the Kemi River for the Diocese of Turku. In 1375, the Novgorod Republic built a defensive castle which was later captured by the Kingdom of Sweden in 1377.

The 1400s were characterized by Russian raids in the region, during these raids captured people would be killed and/or taken back to the region of Russia. In 1531, the city was granted permission to act as a trading post. In 1590, the Oulu Castle was built by the Swedes and in 1595, the Treaty of Teusina firmly established Sweden&#x27;s control over Oulu. 

The city was founded on 8 April 1605 by King Charles IX of Sweden, and granted city privileges in 1610. In 1765, Oulu received township rights granting them to trade outside of Sweden. Oulu was the capital of the Province of Oulu from 1776 to 2009.

In 1822, a major fire destroyed much of the city, especially the city centre as most of the city was made from wood. The architect Carl Ludvig Engel, chiefly known for the neoclassical (empire style) buildings around Helsinki Senate Square, was enlisted to provide the plan for its rebuilding. With minor changes, this plan remains the basis for the layout of Oulu&#x27;s town center. The Oulu Cathedral was built in 1832 to his designs, with the spire being finished in 1844. During the Åland War, part of the Crimean War, Oulu&#x27;s harbour was raided by the British fleet, who destroyed ships and burned tar houses, leading to international criticism.

The city was the site of the Battle of Oulu on 3 February 1918 between the Whites and the Reds during the Finnish Civil War.

==Geography==

Oulu is located in northern Finland, a considerable distance from the other cities in the country. It is located north of the capital city Helsinki. Mainland Finland&#x27;s northernmost and southernmost points are roughly equidistant from Oulu. Oulu&#x27;s coast sits at the Bothnian Bay (&quot;Perämeri&quot; in Finnish) and the Swedish mainland is about 180 km directly west across the Bothnian Bay. From the center of Oulu in the direction of Oulunsalo, there is , a smaller but wide, meadow-belted bay, and part of it has been listed as a nature conservation area. The nearby island Hailuoto is just off the coast, away in the Bothnian Bay. Along the coast to the southwest, about of Oulu is Raahe (&quot;Brahestad&quot;), known for its historic wooden town, and, further to the southwest, about of Oulu is Kalajoki, known for its popular sandy beaches.

===Subdivisions===
Oulu is divided into 106 city districts. The largest of these are Haukipudas, Oulunsalo, Kaakkuri, Ritaharju, Tuira, and .

===Climate===
Oulu has a subarctic climate (Köppen: &quot;Dfc&quot;, Trewartha &quot;Eolo&quot;), bordering a humid continental climate (Köppen: &quot;Dfb&quot;, Trewartha &quot;Dclo&quot;). It is the largest Finnish city entirely in this climatic zone as well as one of the largest such in the world. The typical features are cold and snowy winters with short and mild summers. Average annual temperature is . The average annual precipitation is falling 105 days per year, mostly in late summer and fall. The warmest temperature ever recorded in Oulu was in July 1957, while the coldest temperature on record was in February 1966.

Due to Oulu&#x27;s far northern location, and its frequent overcast skies, it only sees on average 15 minutes of sunshine per day in December. During the winter solstice days only last 3 hours and 34 minutes with the sun rising 1.9 degrees over the horizon. On the other hand, during the summer solstice days last 22 hours and 3 minutes, with the sun dipping 1 degree below the horizon. This gives Oulu white nights during the summer.

==Transport==

===Intercity===
Oulu is served by Oulu Airport, the second largest airport in Finland by passenger volume. It is located south-west of the city centre.

The Port of Oulu is one of the busiest harbours on the Bothnian Bay. It includes four separate harbour areas: Vihreäsaari oil and bulk docks, Nuottasaari docks and Oritkari docks. There is also a ferry service in Oulu, which is mostly used between Oulunsalo and the Hailuoto Island.

The shortest travel time from Oulu railway station to Helsinki Central railway station is 5 h 34 min, operated by VR. Other destinations include Kolari, Rovaniemi, Seinäjoki and Tampere.

The most important road in Oulu is Highway 4 (E8/E75) that runs from Helsinki to Utsjoki via Lahti, Jyväskylä, Oulu, Kemi and Rovaniemi. Other highways running to and from Oulu are Highway 20 to Kuusamo and Highway 22 to Kajaani.
===Within the city===
Oulu is notable for its transportation network dedicated to non-motor vehicular traffic, including pedestrians and bicycles (termed &quot;light&quot; traffic in Finland). In 2022, the city contained more than of pathways and more than 300 underpasses and bridges devoted exclusively to pedestrian and bicycle traffic. The network is used year-round. The ratio of walking and cycling traffic pathways to residents is the highest in Finland and the cycling mode share is 20 percent. 
Even in winter, bicycle commuting remains strong in Oulu, in spite of the cold, dark, and snow. About 12% of winter trips are by bicycle, and about half of trips to school or university are. The city has a robust system for keeping bike paths maintained and clear of snow, and bike paths and lanes are plowed before roadways to encourage such human-scale winter transit in the city where 12% already do so. The Winter Cycling Federation was founded in Oulu in 2013, and the first Winter Cycling Congress was held there.

In 2015, a large underground parking facility, Kivisydän (&quot;Stone Heart&quot;), opened in the city center directly beneath main shopping streets. The network of parallel roads for cars and pedestrians was drilled in the rock at the depth of . The parking facility includes two ramps, 900 visitor parking lots (expandable to 1500), six access points to the ground served by 19 elevators (expandable to nine and 25), a service facility for commercial delivery vehicles, and ubi-screens that guide the driver to the selected ground access point and help locate the parked car by its license number.

== Solar power ==
In 2015, the Kaleva Media printing plant in Oulu became the most powerful photovoltaic solar plant in Finland, with 1,604 solar photovoltaic (PV) units on its roof. Although the city of Oulu, located near the Arctic Circle, has only two hours of weak sunlight in December, the photovoltaic cells work almost around the clock in the summer. The cold climate means the PV panels can get up to a 25% boost per hour, as they don&#x27;t overheat.

Because the sun is quite low in the sky at this latitude, vertical PV installations are popular on the sides of buildings. These solar walls also capture light reflected from snow.

Snow is not necessarily cleared from rooftop solar installations.

The local utility, Oulun Energia, is owned by the city of Oulu. The energy mix it receives from the Nordic-wide grid includes wood pellets, waste incineration, bioenergy, hydro-electric, geothermal, wind, nuclear, peat, natural gas and coal.

==Sports==
Ice hockey is the most popular spectator sport in Oulu. The local club Kärpät has won the SM-liiga championship title eight times (1981, 2004, 2005, 2007, 2008, 2014, 2015 and 2018). It has also twice been the runner-up in the IIHF European Champions Cup, in 2005 and in 2006.

In football AC Oulu plays in Veikkausliiga, the premier division of Finnish football. So far OPS has claimed the Finnish football championship only twice by winning Mestaruussarja in 1979 and in 1980. Other notable football clubs include OLS, OTP and JS Hercules.

Oulu has one well-known bandy club, OLS, which plays in Bandyliiga and has become Finnish champions 14 times, most recently in 2014. The other bandy club, OPS, with its 7 championships and a bronze medal as late as in 2009, announced it would be closing down after the 2009–10 season. In 2001 the city was the main venue for the Bandy World Championship.

Oulu is also home to several other sports clubs such as Oulu Northern Lights (American football), Oulun NMKY (Basketball), Oulun Lippo (Pesäpallo), Oulun Pyrintö (Track and field), SK Pohjantähti (Orienteering)), OYUS (Rugby union), Oulu Irish Elks (Gaelic football) and ETTA (Volleyball).

Oulun Tervahiihto is an annual ski marathon event held since 1889.

Terwa Run &amp; Marathon is an annual running event held since 1989 in late May.

A former motorcycle speedway track known as the Iinat Motor Sports Center was located north of the Pirttilammentie and east of the Iinatintie (). The Center opened in 1979 and hosted many events, including the Finnish Final, as part of the qualifying round of the Speedway World Championship in 1983.

==Education==

The University of Oulu and Oulu University of Applied Sciences have their main campuses located in Oulu.

Oulu is home to the most northerly architecture school in the world. The school is best known for its strong regionalistic ideas for developing architecture. This movement is named &quot;the Oulu school&quot; (&quot;Oulun koulu&quot;) of architecture. 

Oulu Vocational College has over 13 000 students. It houses several different study subjects in different units which are spread over Oulu and neighbouring municipalities. Oulu Vocational College School of Business Studies is one of the few vocational schools which has game programming in its curriculum.

Oulu International School is one of nine schools in Finland offering basic education in English. There&#x27;s also a Swedish-speaking private school (Swedish Svenska Privatskolan i Uleåborg) for students up until high school. The school is the northernmost Swedish-speaking school in Finland.

<text>Lillian Florence Hellman (June 20, 1905 – June 30, 1984) was an American playwright, prose writer, memoirist and screenwriter known for her success on Broadway, as well as her communist views and political activism. She was blacklisted after her appearance before the House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC) at the height of the anti-communist campaigns of 1947–1952. Although she continued to work on Broadway in the 1950s, her blacklisting by the American film industry caused a drop in her income. Many praised Hellman for refusing to answer questions by HUAC, but others believed, despite her denial, that she had belonged to the Communist Party.

As a playwright, Hellman had many successes on Broadway, including &quot;The Children&#x27;s Hour&quot;, &quot;The Little Foxes&quot; and its sequel &quot;Another Part of the Forest&quot;, &quot;Watch on the Rhine&quot;, &quot;The Autumn Garden&quot;, and &quot;Toys in the Attic&quot;. She adapted her semi-autobiographical play &quot;The Little Foxes&quot; into a screenplay, which starred Bette Davis. Hellman was romantically involved with fellow writer and political activist Dashiell Hammett, who also was blacklisted for 10 years; the couple never married.

Beginning in the late 1960s, and continuing through to her death, Hellman turned to writing a series of popular memoirs of her colorful life and acquaintances. Hellman&#x27;s accuracy was challenged in 1979 on &quot;The Dick Cavett Show&quot;, when Mary McCarthy said of her memoirs that &quot;every word she writes is a lie, including &#x27;and&#x27; and &#x27;the&#x27;.&quot; Hellman brought a defamation suit against McCarthy and Cavett, and during the suit, investigators found errors in Hellman&#x27;s &quot;Pentimento.&quot; They said that the &quot;Julia&quot; section of &quot;Pentimento&quot;, which had been the basis for the Oscar-winning 1977 movie of the same name, was actually based on the life of Muriel Gardiner. Martha Gellhorn, one of the most prominent war correspondents of the twentieth century, as well as Ernest Hemingway&#x27;s third wife, said that Hellman&#x27;s remembrances of Hemingway and the Spanish Civil War were wrong. McCarthy, Gellhorn and others accused Hellman of lying about her membership in the Communist Party and of being a committed Stalinist.

The defamation suit was unresolved at the time of Hellman&#x27;s death in 1984; her executors eventually withdrew the complaint. Hellman&#x27;s modern-day literary reputation rests largely on the plays and screenplays from the first three decades of her career, and not on the memoirs published later in her life.

==Biography==
===Early life and marriage===
Lillian Florence Hellman was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, into a Jewish family. Her mother was Julia Newhouse of Demopolis, Alabama, and her father was Max Hellman, a New Orleans shoe salesman. Julia Newhouse&#x27;s parents were Sophie Marx, from a successful banking family, and Leonard Newhouse, a Demopolis liquor dealer. During most of her childhood she spent half of each year in New Orleans, in a boarding home run by her aunts, and the other half in New York City. She studied for two years at New York University and then took several courses at Columbia University.

On December 31, 1925, Hellman married Arthur Kober, a playwright and press agent, although they often lived apart. In 1929, she traveled around Europe for a time and settled in Bonn to continue her education. She felt an initial attraction to a Nazi student group that advocated &quot;a kind of socialism&quot; until their questioning about her Jewish ties made their antisemitism clear, and she returned immediately to the United States. Years later she wrote, &quot;Then for the first time in my life I thought about being a Jew.&quot;

===1930s===
Beginning in 1930, for about a year she earned $50 a week as a reader for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in Hollywood, writing summaries of novels and periodical literature for potential screenplays. Although she found the job rather dull, it created many opportunities for her to meet a greater range of creative people while she became involved in more political and artistic scenes during that time. While there she met and fell in love with mystery writer Dashiell Hammett. She divorced Kober and returned to New York City in 1932. When she met Hammett in a Hollywood restaurant, she was 24 and he was 36. They maintained their relationship off and on until his death in January 1961.

Hellman&#x27;s drama &quot;The Children&#x27;s Hour&quot; premiered on Broadway on November 24, 1934, and ran for 691 performances. It depicts a false accusation of lesbianism by a schoolgirl against two of her teachers. The falsehood is discovered, but before amends can be made one teacher is rejected by her fiancé and the other commits suicide. Following the success of &quot;The Children&#x27;s Hour&quot;, Hellman returned to Hollywood as a screenwriter for Goldwyn Pictures at $2,500 a week. She first collaborated on a screenplay for &quot;The Dark Angel&quot;, an earlier play and silent film.

Following that film&#x27;s successful release in 1935, Goldwyn purchased the rights to &quot;The Children&#x27;s Hour&quot; for $35,000 while it still was running on Broadway. Hellman rewrote the play to conform to the standards of the Motion Picture Production Code, under which any mention of lesbianism was impossible. Instead, one schoolteacher is accused of having sex with the other&#x27;s fiancé. It appeared in 1936 under the title, &quot;These Three&quot;. She next wrote the screenplay for &quot;Dead End&quot; (1937), which featured the first appearance of the Dead End Kids and premiered in 1937.

On May 1, 1935, Hellman joined the League of American Writers (1935–1943), whose members included Dashiell Hammett, Alexander Trachtenberg of International Publishers, Frank Folsom, Louis Untermeyer, I.F. Stone, Myra Page, Millen Brand, and Arthur Miller. (Members were largely either Communist Party members or fellow travelers.)

Also in 1935, Hellman joined the struggling Screen Writers Guild, devoted herself to recruiting new members, and proved one of its most aggressive advocates. One of its key issues was the dictatorial way producers credited writers for their work, known as &quot;screen credit.&quot; Hellman had received no recognition for some of her earlier projects, although she was the principal author of &quot;The Westerner&quot; (1934) and a principal contributor to &quot;The Melody Lingers On&quot; (1935).

In December 1936, her play &quot;Days to Come&quot; closed its Broadway run after just seven performances. In it, she portrayed a labor dispute in a small Ohio town during which the characters try to balance the competing claims of owners and workers, both represented as valid. Communist publications denounced her failure to take sides. That same month she joined several other literary figures, including Dorothy Parker and Archibald MacLeish, in forming and funding Contemporary Historians, Inc., to back a film project, &quot;The Spanish Earth&quot;, to demonstrate support for the anti-Franco forces in the Spanish Civil War.

In March 1937, Hellman joined a group of 88 U.S. public figures in signing &quot;An Open Letter to American Liberals&quot; that protested an effort headed by John Dewey to examine Leon Trotsky&#x27;s defense against his 1936 condemnation by the Soviet Union. The letter has been viewed by some critics as a defense of Stalin&#x27;s Moscow Purge Trials. It charged some of Trotsky&#x27;s defenders with aiming to destabilize the Soviet Union and said the Soviet Union &quot;should be left to protect itself against treasonable plots as it saw fit.&quot; It asked U.S. liberals and progressives to unite with the Soviet Union against the growing threat of fascism and avoid an investigation that would only fuel &quot;the reactionary sections of the press and public&quot; in the United States. Endorsing this view, the editors of the &quot;New Republic&quot; wrote that &quot;there are more important questions than Trotsky&#x27;s guilt.&quot; Those who signed the &quot;Open Letter&quot; called for a united front against fascism, which, in their view, required uncritical support of the Soviet Union.

In October 1937, Hellman spent a few weeks in Spain to lend her support, as other writers had, to the International Brigades of non-Spaniards who had joined the anti-Franco side in the Spanish Civil War. As bombs fell on Madrid, she broadcast a report to the U.S. on Madrid Radio. In 1989, journalist and Ernest Hemingway&#x27;s third wife, Martha Gellhorn, herself in Spain at that period, disputed the account of this trip in Hellman&#x27;s memoirs and claimed that Hellman waited until all the witnesses were dead before describing events that never occurred. Nevertheless, Hellman had documented her trip in the &quot;New Republic&quot; in April 1938 as &quot;A Day in Spain.&quot; Langston Hughes wrote admiringly of the radio broadcast in 1956.

Hellman was a member of the Communist Party from 1938 to 1940, by her own account written in 1952, &quot;a most casual member. I attended very few meetings and saw and heard nothing more than people sitting around a room talking of current events or discussing the books they had read. I drifted away from the Communist Party because I seemed to be in the wrong place. My own maverick nature was no more suitable to the political left than it had been to the conservative background from which I came.&quot;

====&quot;The Little Foxes&quot; and controversy====

Her play &quot;The Little Foxes&quot; opened on Broadway on February 13, 1939, and ran for 410 performances. The play starred Tallulah Bankhead as Regina, and after its success on Broadway the play toured extensively in the United States. The play was Hellman&#x27;s personal favorite, and by far the most commercially and critically successful play she originated. However, a feud developed between the two when Bankhead wanted to perform for a benefit for Finnish Relief, as the USSR had recently invaded Finland. Without thinking Hellman&#x27;s approval was necessary, Bankhead and the cast told the press the news of the benefit. They were shocked when Hellman and Shumlin declined to give permission for the benefit performance, citing non-intervention and anti-militarism. Bankhead told reporters, &quot;I&#x27;ve adopted Spanish Loyalist orphans and sent money to China, causes for which both Mr. Shumlin and Miss Hellman were strenuous proponents ... why should [they] suddenly become so insular?&quot;
Hellman countered her star: &quot;I don&#x27;t believe in that fine, lovable little Republic of Finland that everyone gets so weepy about. I&#x27;ve been there and it seems like a little pro-Nazi Republic to me.&quot; Bankhead, who hated Nazism and had become a strong critic of Communism since the mid 1930s Great Purge and for what she saw as a communist betrayal of the Second Spanish Republic, was outraged by Hellman&#x27;s actions and thought Hellman a moral hypocrite. Hellman had never been to Finland. Bankhead and the cast suspected that Hellman&#x27;s refusal was motivated by her fanatical devotion to the Stalinist regime in Soviet Russia. Hellman and Bankhead became adversaries as a result of the feud, not speaking to each other for a quarter of a century afterwards.

Hellman had aggravated the matter further by claiming that the real reason for turning down the benefit was because when the Spanish Republican government fell to Franco&#x27;s fascists, Hellman and Shumlin requested that Bankhead put on a benefit for the Spanish loyalists fleeing to neighboring France, and the actress and company refused. Bankhead was further incensed by these comments, as she had helped many Spanish Republican fighters and families to flee the Spanish Civil War in 1937, after they had been turned on by Stalinist fighters behind their own Republican lines. Hellman and Bankhead would not speak again until late 1963. Years later, drama critic Joseph Wood Krutch recounted how he and fellow critic George Jean Nathan had shared a cab with Hellman and Bankhead:

Bankhead said: &quot;That&#x27;s the last time I act in one of your god-damned plays&quot;. Miss Hellman responded by slamming her purse against the actress&#x27;s jaw. ... I decided that no self-respecting Gila monster would have behaved in that manner.

===1940s===
On January 9, 1940, viewing the spread of fascism in Europe and fearing similar political developments in the United States, she said at a luncheon of the American Booksellers Association:

Her play &quot;Watch on the Rhine&quot; opened on Broadway on April 1, 1941, and ran for 378 performances. It won the New York Drama Critics&#x27; Circle Award. She wrote the play in 1940, when its call for a united international alliance against Hitler directly contradicted the Communist position at the time, following the Nazi-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact of August 1939. Early in 1942, Hellman accompanied the production to Washington, D.C., for a benefit performance where she spoke with President Roosevelt. Hammett wrote the screenplay for the movie version that appeared in 1943.

In October 1941, Hellman and Ernest Hemingway co-hosted a dinner to raise money for anti-Nazi activists imprisoned in France. New York Governor Herbert Lehman agreed to participate, but withdrew because some of the sponsoring organizations, he wrote, &quot;have long been connected with Communist activities.&quot; Hellman replied: &quot;I do not and I did not ask the politics of any members of the committee and there is nobody who can with honesty vouch for anybody but themselves.&quot; She assured him the funds raised would be used as promised and later provided him with a detailed accounting. The next month she wrote him: &quot;I am sure it will make you sad and ashamed as it did me to know that, of the seven resignations out of 147 sponsors, five were Jews. Of all the peoples in the world, I think, we should be the last to hold back help, on any grounds, from those who fought for us.&quot;

In 1942, Hellman received an Academy Award nomination for her screenplay for the film version of &quot;The Little Foxes&quot;. Two years later, she received another nomination for her screenplay for &quot;The North Star&quot;, the only original screenplay of her career. She objected to the film&#x27;s production numbers that, she said, turned a village festival into &quot;an extended opera bouffe peopled by musical comedy characters&quot;, but still told &quot;The New York Times&quot; that it was &quot;a valuable and true picture which tells a good deal of the truth about fascism&quot;. To establish the difference between her screenplay and the film, Hellman published her screenplay in the fall of 1943. British historian Robert Conquest wrote that it was &quot;a travesty greater than could have been shown on Soviet screens to audiences used to lies, but experienced in collective-farm conditions.&quot;

In April 1944, Hellman&#x27;s &quot;The Searching Wind&quot; opened on Broadway. Her third World War II project, it tells the story of an ambassador whose indecisive relations with his wife and mistress mirror the vacillation and appeasement of his professional life. She wrote the screenplay for the film version that appeared two years later. Both versions depicted the ambassador&#x27;s feckless response to anti-Semitism. The conservative press noted that the play reflected none of Hellman&#x27;s pro-Soviet views, and the communist response to the play was negative.

Hellman&#x27;s applications for a passport to travel to England in April 1943 and May 1944 were both denied because government authorities considered her &quot;an active Communist&quot;, although in 1944 the head of the Passport Division of the Department of State, Ruth Shipley, cited &quot;the present military situation&quot; as the reason. In August 1944, she received a passport, indicative of government approval, for travel to Russia on a goodwill mission as a guest of VOKS, the Soviet agency that handled cultural exchanges. During her visit from November 5, 1944, to January 18, 1945, she began an affair with John F. Melby, a foreign service officer, that continued as an intermittent affair for years and as a friendship for the rest of her life.

In May 1946, the National Institute of Arts and Letters made Hellman a member. In November of that year, her play &quot;Another Part of the Forest&quot; premiered, directed by Hellman. It presented the same characters twenty years younger than they had appeared in &quot;The Little Foxes&quot;. A film version to which Hellman did not contribute followed in 1948.

In 1947, Columbia Pictures offered Hellman a multi-year contract, which she refused because the contract included a loyalty clause that she viewed as an infringement on her rights of free speech and association. It required her to sign a statement that she had never been a member of the Communist Party and would not associate with radicals or subversives, which would have required her to end her life with Hammett. Shortly thereafter, William Wyler told her he was unable to hire her to work on a film because she was blacklisted.

In November 1947, the leaders of the motion picture industry decided to deny employment to anyone who refused to answer questions posed by the House Un-American Activities Committee. Following the Hollywood Ten&#x27;s defiance of the committee, Hellman wrote an editorial in the December issue of &quot;Screen Writer&quot;, the publication of the Screen Writers Guild. Titled &quot;The Judas Goats&quot;, it mocked the committee and derided producers for allowing themselves to be intimidated. It said in part:



Melby and Hellman corresponded regularly in the years following World War II while he held State Department assignments overseas. Their political views diverged as he came to advocate containment of communism while she was unwilling to hear criticism of the Soviet Union. They became, in one historian&#x27;s view, &quot;political strangers, occasional lovers, and mostly friends.&quot; Melby particularly objected to her support for Henry Wallace in the 1948 presidential election.

In 1949, she adapted Emmanuel Roblès&#x27; French-language play, &quot;Montserrat&quot;, for Broadway, where it opened on October 29. Again, Hellman directed it. It was revived again in 1961.

===1950s===

The play that is recognized by critics and judged by Hellman as her best, &quot;The Autumn Garden&quot;, premiered in 1951.

In 1952, Hellman was called to testify before House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), which had heard testimony that she had attended Communist Party meetings in 1937. She initially drafted a statement that said her two-year membership in the Communist Party had ended in 1940, but she did not condemn the party nor express regret for her participation in it. Her attorney, Joseph Rauh, opposed her admission of membership on technical grounds because she had attended meetings, but never formally become a party member. He warned that the committee and the public would expect her to take a strong anti-communist stand to atone for her political past, but she refused to apologize or denounce the party. Faced with Hellman&#x27;s position, Rauh devised a strategy that produced favorable press coverage and allowed her to avoid the stigma of being labeled a &quot;Fifth Amendment Communist&quot;. On May 19, 1952, Hellman authored a letter to HUAC that one historian has described as &quot;written not to persuade the Committee, but to shape press coverage.&quot; In it she explained her willingness to testify only about herself and that she did not want to claim her rights under the Fifth Amendment–&quot;I am ready and willing to testify before the representatives of our Government as to my own actions, regardless of any risks or consequences to myself.&quot; She wrote that she found the legal requirement that she testify about others if she wanted to speak about her own actions &quot;difficult for a layman to understand.&quot; Rauh had the letter delivered to the HUAC&#x27;s chairman Rep. John S. Wood on Monday.

In public testimony before HUAC on Tuesday, May 21, 1952, Hellman answered preliminary questions about her background. When asked about attending a specific meeting at the home of Hollywood screenwriter Martin Berkeley, she refused to respond, claiming her rights under the Fifth Amendment and she referred the committee to her letter by way of explanation. The Committee responded that it had considered and rejected her request to be allowed to testify only about herself and entered her letter into the record. Hellman answered only one additional question: she denied she had ever belonged to the Communist Party. She cited the Fifth Amendment in response to several more questions and the committee dismissed her. Historian John Earl Haynes credits both Rauh&#x27;s &quot;clever tactics&quot; and Hellman&#x27;s &quot;sense of the dramatic&quot; for what followed the conclusion of Hellman&#x27;s testimony. As the committee moved on to other business, Rauh released to the press copies of her letter to HUAC. Committee members, unprepared for close questioning about Hellman&#x27;s stance, offered only offhand comments. The press reported Hellman&#x27;s statement at length, its language crafted to overshadow the comments of the HUAC members. She wrote in part:

Reaction divided along political lines. Murray Kempton, a longtime critic of her support for communist causes, praised her: &quot;It is enough that she has reached into her conscience for an act based on something more than the material or the tactical ... she has chosen to act like a lady.&quot; The FBI increased its surveillance of her travel and her mail. In the early 1950s, at the height of anti-communist fervor in the United States, the State Department investigated whether Melby posed a security risk. In April 1952, the department stated its one formal charge against him: &quot;that during the period 1945 to date, you have maintained an association with one, Lillian Hellman, reliably reported to be a member of the Communist Party,&quot; based on testimony from unidentified informants. When Melby appeared before the department&#x27;s Loyalty Security Board, he was not allowed to contest Hellman&#x27;s Communist Party affiliation or learn who informed against her, but only to present his understanding of her politics and the nature of his relationship with her, including the occasional renewal of their physical relationship. He said he had no plans to renew their friendship, but never promised to avoid contact with her.

In the course of a series of appeals, Hellman testified before the Loyalty Security Board on his behalf. She offered to answer questions about her political views and associations, but the board only allowed her to describe her relationship with Melby. She testified that she had many longstanding friendships with people of different political views and that political sympathy was not a part of those relationships. She described how her relationship with Melby changed over time and how their sexual relationship was briefly renewed in 1950 after a long hiatus: &quot;The relationship obviously at this point was neither one thing nor the other: it was neither over nor was it not over.&quot; She said that:

The State Department dismissed Melby on April 22, 1953. As was its practice, the board gave no reason for its decision.

In 1954, Hellman declined when asked to adapt Anne Frank&#x27;s &quot;The Diary of a Young Girl&quot; (1952) for the stage. According to writer and director Garson Kanin, she said that the diary was &quot;a great historical work which will probably live forever, but I couldn&#x27;t be more wrong as the adapter. If I did this it would run one night because it would be deeply depressing. You need someone who has a much lighter touch&quot; and recommended her friends, Frances Goodrich and Albert Hackett.

Hellman made an English-language adaption of Jean Anouilh&#x27;s play &quot;L&#x27;Alouette&quot;, based on the trial of Joan of Arc, called &quot;The Lark&quot;. Leonard Bernstein composed incidental music for the first production, which opened on Broadway on November 17, 1955. Hellman edited a collection of Chekhov&#x27;s correspondence that appeared in 1955 as &quot;The Selected Letters of Anton Chekhov&quot;.

Following the success of &quot;The Lark&quot;, Hellman conceived of another play with incidental music, based on Voltaire&#x27;s &quot;Candide&quot;. Bernstein convinced her to develop it as a comic operetta with a much more substantial musical component. She wrote the spoken dialogue, which many others then worked on, and wrote some lyrics as well for what became the often-revived, &quot;Candide&quot;. Hellman hated the collaboration and revisions on deadline that &quot;Candide&quot; required: &quot;I went to pieces when something had to be done quickly, because someone didn&#x27;t like something, and there was no proper time to think it out ... I realized that I panicked under conditions I wasn&#x27;t accustomed to.&quot;

===1960s===
&quot;Toys in the Attic&quot; opened on Broadway on February 25, 1960, and ran for 464 performances. It received a Tony Award nomination for Best Play. In this family drama set in New Orleans, money, marital infidelity, and revenge end in a woman&#x27;s disfigurement. Hellman had no hand in the screenplay, which altered the drama&#x27;s tone and exaggerated the characterizations, and the resulting film received bad reviews. Later that year she was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

A second film version of &quot;The Children&#x27;s Hour&quot;, less successful both with critics and at the box office, appeared in 1961 under that title, but Hellman played no role in the screenplay, having withdrawn from the project following Hammett&#x27;s death in 1961. In the 1961 version of &quot;The Children&#x27;s Hour&quot;, however, despite the continued existence of the Motion Picture Production Code, the lead characters (played by Audrey Hepburn and Shirley MacLaine) were explicitly accused of lesbianism.

In 1961, Brandeis University awarded her its Creative Arts Medal for outstanding lifetime achievement and the women&#x27;s division of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine at Yeshiva University gave her its Achievement Award. The following year, in December 1962, Hellman was elected a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters and inducted at a May 1963 ceremony.

Another play, &quot;My Mother, My Father, and Me&quot;, proved unsuccessful when it was staged in March 1963. It closed after 17 performances. Hellman adapted it from Burt Blechman&#x27;s novel &quot;How Much?&quot;

Hellman wrote another screenplay in 1965 for &quot;The Chase&quot;, starring Marlon Brando, based on a play and novel by Horton Foote. Although Hellman received sole credit for the screenplay, she worked from an earlier treatment, and producer Sam Spiegel made additional changes and altered the sequence of scenes. In 1966, she edited a collection of Hammett&#x27;s stories, &quot;The Big Knockover&quot;. Her introductory profile of Hammett was her first exercise in memoir writing.

Hellman wrote a reminiscence of gulag-survivor Lev Kopelev, husband of her translator in Russia during 1944, to serve as the introduction to his anti-Stalinist memoirs, &quot;To Be Preserved Forever&quot;, which appeared in 1976. In February 1980, she, John Hersey, and Norman Mailer wrote to Soviet authorities to protest retribution against Kopelev for his defense of Soviet dissident Andrei Sakharov. Hellman was a long-time friend of author Dorothy Parker and served as her literary executor after her death in 1967.

Hellman published her first volume of memoirs that touched upon her political, artistic, and social life, &quot;An Unfinished Woman: A Memoir&quot;, in 1969, for which she received the U.S. National Book Award in category Arts and Letters, which was an award category from 1964 to 1976.

===1970s===
In the early 1970s, Hellman taught writing for short periods at the University of California, Berkeley, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Hunter College in New York City. Her second volume of memoirs, &quot;Pentimento: A Book of Portraits&quot;, appeared in 1973. In an interview at the time, Hellman described the difficulty of writing about the 1950s:

Hellman published her third volume of memoirs, &quot;Scoundrel Time&quot;, in 1976. These writings illustrated not only the exciting artistic time, but also depicted an influential tone, closely associated with the beginning of the feminist movement. In 1976, she posed in a fur coat for the Blackglama national advertising campaign &quot;What Becomes a Legend Most?&quot;. In August of that year she was awarded the prestigious Edward MacDowell Medal for her contribution to literature. In October, she received the Paul Robeson Award from Actors&#x27; Equity.

In 1976, Hellman&#x27;s publisher, Little Brown, canceled its contract to publish a book of Diana Trilling&#x27;s essays because Trilling refused to delete four passages critical of Hellman. When Trilling&#x27;s collection appeared the next year, in 1977, the &quot;New York Times&quot; critic felt the need to posit his own preference for the &quot;simple confession of error&quot; Hellman made in &quot;Scoundrel Time&quot; for her &quot;acquiescence in Stalinism&quot; to what he described as Trilling&#x27;s excuses for her own behavior during McCarthyism. Arthur L. Herman, however, later described &quot;Scoundrel Time&quot; as &quot;breathtaking dishonesty&quot;.

Hellman presented the Academy Award for Best Documentary Film at a ceremony on March 28, 1977. Greeted by a standing ovation, she said:

The 1977 Oscar-winning film &quot;Julia&quot; was based on the &quot;Julia&quot; chapter of &quot;Pentimento&quot;. On June 30, 1976, as the film was going into production, Hellman wrote about the screenplay to its producer:

In a 1979 television interview, author Mary McCarthy, long Hellman&#x27;s political adversary and the object of her negative literary judgment, said of Hellman that &quot;every word she writes is a lie, including &#x27;and&#x27; and &#x27;the&#x27;.&quot; Hellman responded by filing a US$2,500,000 defamation suit against McCarthy, interviewer Dick Cavett, and PBS. McCarthy in turn produced evidence she said proved that Hellman had lied in some accounts of her life. Cavett said he sympathized more with McCarthy than Hellman in the lawsuit, but &quot;everybody lost&quot; as a result of it. Norman Mailer attempted unsuccessfully to mediate the dispute through an open letter he published in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. At the time of her death, Hellman was still in litigation with McCarthy; her executors dropped the suit.

===Later years and death===
In 1980, Hellman published a short novel, &quot;Maybe: A Story&quot;. Though presented as fiction, Hellman, Hammett, and other real-life people appeared as characters. It received a mixed reception and was sometimes read as another installment of Hellman&#x27;s memoirs. Hellman&#x27;s editor wrote to &quot;The New York Times&quot; to question a reviewer&#x27;s attempt to check the facts in the novel. He described it as a work of fiction whose characters misremember and dissemble.

In 1983, New York psychiatrist Muriel Gardiner claimed she was the basis for the title character in &quot;Julia&quot; and that she had never known Hellman. Hellman denied the character was based on Gardiner. As the events Hellman described matched Gardiner&#x27;s account of her life and Gardiner&#x27;s family was closely tied to Hellman&#x27;s attorney, Wolf Schwabacher, some critics believe that Hellman appropriated Gardiner&#x27;s story without attribution.

Hellman died on June 30, 1984, aged 79, from a heart attack near her home on Martha&#x27;s Vineyard and is buried beneath a pine tree on a rise at one end of Abels Hill/Chilmark Cemetery, Chilmark, Martha&#x27;s Vineyard, Massachusetts.

==Archive==
Hellman&#x27;s papers are held by the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin. Her archive includes an extensive collection of manuscript drafts, contracts, correspondence, scrapbooks, speeches, teaching notes, awards, legal documents, appointment books, and honorary degrees.

==Legacy==
Institutions that awarded Hellman honorary degrees include Brandeis University (1955), Wheaton College (1960), Mt. Holyoke College (1966), Smith College (1974), Yale University (1974), and Columbia University (1976).

Human Rights Watch administers the Hellman/Hammett grant program named for the two writers.

Hellman is the central character in Peter Feibleman&#x27;s 1993 play &quot;Cakewalk&quot;, which depicts his relationship with Hellman, based in turn on Feibleman&#x27;s 1988 memoir of their relationship, &quot;Lilly&quot;, which described &quot;his tumultuous time as her lover, caretaker, writing partner and principal heir.&quot;

In 1999, Kathy Bates directed a television film, &quot;Dash and Lilly&quot;, based on the relationship between Hellman and Hammett.

Hellman&#x27;s feud with Mary McCarthy formed the basis for Nora Ephron&#x27;s 2002 play &quot;Imaginary Friends&quot;, with music by Marvin Hamlisch and lyrics by Craig Carnelia.

William Wright wrote &quot;The Julia Wars&quot;, based on the legal battle between Hellman and McCarthy. Chuck Palahniuk&#x27;s novel &quot;Tell-All&quot; (2010) was described by Janet Maslin in &quot;The New York Times&quot; as &quot;a looney pipe dream that savages Lillian Hellman&quot;. Dorothy Gallagher wrote a biography of Hellman, &quot;Lillian Hellman: An Imperious Life&quot;.

<text>Joseph T. &quot;Cap&quot; Shaw (May 8, 1874 – August 2, 1952) was the editor of &quot;Black Mask&quot; magazine from 1926 to 1936.

==Life and career==
Before becoming the editor of &quot;Black Mask&quot;, Shaw had worked as a newspaper reporter and as a soldier in World War I, attaining the rank of captain (Shaw&#x27;s friends gave him the nickname &quot;Cap&quot;). Shaw was also a professional fencer, and even won an Olympic medal for fencing. Under his editorship, &quot;Black Mask&quot; published many works of crime fiction now recognised as classics of the genre, by authors such as Dashiell Hammett, Raymond Chandler, and Erle Stanley Gardner. Chandler greatly admired Shaw&#x27;s ability to encourage &quot;Black Mask&quot; writers, claiming in a letter, &quot;We wrote better for him than we could have written for anybody else.&quot;

Despite the critical and commercial success of &quot;Black Mask&quot;, Shaw was eventually fired from the magazine, succeeded by Fanny Ellsworth. Shaw then worked as a literary agent, though without notable success.

Shaw was a writer himself, producing short stories, novels, and articles.

<doc id="208804" wikidata="Q995488" url="?curid=208804" title="Sandhurst, Berkshire">
<text>Sandhurst is a town and civil parish in the Bracknell Forest borough in Berkshire, England. It is in the south eastern corner of Berkshire, and is situated west-southwest of London, north west of Camberley and south of Bracknell. Sandhurst is known worldwide as the location of the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst (often referred to simply as &quot;Sandhurst&quot;, &quot;The Academy&quot; or &quot;The RMA&quot;). Despite its close proximity to Camberley, Sandhurst is also home to a large and well-known out-of-town mercantile development. The site is named &quot;The Meadows&quot; and has a Tesco Extra superstore and a Marks &amp; Spencer, two of the largest in the country. A large Next clothing and homeware store is open on the site of the old Homebase.

==Geography==

Sandhurst is in South East England near the junction of Berkshire, Hampshire and Surrey. The town has four main districts, from west to east: Little Sandhurst, Sandhurst (central) and College Town, with Owlsmoor to the northeast. North of the town are Edgbarrow Woods and a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) called Sandhurst to Owlsmoor Bogs and Heaths which includes the nature reserve of Wildmoor Heath. To the east is Broadmoor Bottom, an expanse of heathland together with fir tree plantations. This backs onto the high-security Broadmoor Hospital.

Sandhurst is bordered, on the south, by the River Blackwater, and several of the Yateley Lakes along its course are within the parish, notably Trilakes with its country park. This is also the county boundary with Hampshire at Blackwater. The town of Crowthorne is to the north, the village of Finchampstead to the west, and Camberley, across the Surrey county boundary, is on its southeastern side. This is the closest sizeable town, though Sandhurst is also only south of the new town of Bracknell. The soil is sandy, with a subsoil of sand and gravel.



==Transport==
Sandhurst lies just off the A30, which is away from junction 4 of the M3 motorway. It is also located from the M4, via the Crowthorne bypass (A3095) to Bracknell and the A329(M) towards Reading.

Sandhurst railway station is a stop on the North Downs Line; trains are operated by Great Western Railway. Services run between Gatwick, Guildford and Reading.

Stagecoach South operates bus route 3 between Yateley and Camberley every 15 minutes except on Sundays; alternate services extends to and from Aldershot.

==Local government==
Sandhurst has representation through several tiers of government – town council, unitary authority, and parliamentary (UK). Its Town Council is divided into four wards, Central Sandhurst, Little Sandhurst, College Town and Owlsmoor, all represented by twenty-four councillors. It is also part of the Bracknell Forest District. The ancient parish of Sandhurst also covered Crowthorne, until this became an ecclesiastical parish in its own right in 1874 and a civil parish in 1894. The current mayor of Sandhurst is Councillor Parm Panesar.

==History==
===Saxon and Medieval periods===
The name of the village is Anglo-Saxon and originates from the sandy soils and the hurst (a wooded eminence) of the area. In the early 14th century records, Sandhurst appears as part of the township of Sonning, a large minster parish spreading over much of eastern Berkshire, which later became a hundred when its villages obtained their own churches. These lands belonged to the Bishops of Salisbury. There were two manors in Sandhurst: ‘Hall’ in the grounds of what is now the Royal Military Academy and ‘Sandhurst’ on the site of Sandhurst Lodge. Nothing remains of the original buildings. The first mention of the village of Sandhurst is to be found in the Exchequer Rolls of Henry II in 1175 where the receipt of one mark for the &quot;Villata de Sandhurst&quot; is recorded.

===Tudor to Georgian periods===
In the early modern era, Sandhurst parish was a small farming community on the very edge of Windsor Forest, Sandhurst Walke being an important forest division subject to forest laws. Locals had the right to cut turf, bracken, heather and wood that was primarily cultivated to feed the forest deer. These were hunted by Royal parties from a hunting lodge in the vicinity of Hart&#x27;s Leap Road. A number of disputes are on record, showing how Sandhurst people sometimes took more resources than was allowed. Farming has always remained a major part of village life here and some defunct farms are still remembered in the names of housing estates, roads and even a restaurant: Sandhurst Farm, Snaprails, Caves Farm, Ambarrow Farm, College Farm, Rectory Farm, Beech Farm and Rackstraws Farm. In the mid-16th century, William, Lord Sandys, the Lord Chancellor to King Henry VIII, owned a supposed manor called &#x27;Buckhurst&#x27; in the area between College Town and Central Sandhurst.

===Victorian and Modern periods===
Life changed very little in Sandhurst until the 19th century when large sections of land were sold for the building of the Royal Military College, which moved from Marlow in 1813. The railway arrived in 1849 and a number of large country residences were subsequently erected in the area: amongst them, Harts Leap, Forest End, St Helens, The Uplands, The Warren, Longdown Lodge, Ryefield, Snaprails, and Ambarrow Court. Sandhurst Lodge was erected in about 1858 by Robert W. Gibson and leased to John Walter, of the Times Newspaper, and then Sir William Farrer, solicitor to Queen Victoria and The Duke of Wellington. Perry Hill and The Ceders came later. Only a few remain today. The others have been demolished and land developed.

Such large houses and institutions, including the Broadmoor Hospital and Wellington College in nearby Crowthorne, led to a great expansion of the local population as people moved into the area looking for work. Further residential housing was erected for these workers, as well as more schools for their children, more places of worship and other community resources. Until Sandhurst Comprehensive – now Sandhurst School – was built in 1969 in Owlsmoor, Secondary-age pupils were sent to Edgbarrow School in Crowthorne, Forest Grammar School for boys in Winnersh or Holt School for girls in Wokingham. From the late 1950s to the 80s, large housing estates have been built creating the conglomerate town of today from the original four villages of College Town, Central Sandhurst, Little Sandhurst and Owlsmoor.

<text>The Royal Military Academy Sandhurst (RMAS or RMA Sandhurst), commonly known simply as Sandhurst, is one of several military academies of the United Kingdom and is the British Army&#x27;s initial officer training centre. It is located in the town of Sandhurst, Berkshire, though its ceremonial entrance is in Camberley, Surrey, southwest of London. The academy&#x27;s stated aim is to be &quot;the national centre of excellence for leadership&quot;. All British Army officers, including late-entry officers who were previously Warrant Officers, as well as other men and women from overseas, are trained at the academy. It also commands the University Officers&#x27; Training Corps, which along with the General Staff Centre and Centre for Army Leadership are collectively part of the formation known as Sandhurst Group (RMAS Group) part of Home Command. 

Sandhurst is the British Army equivalent of the Britannia Royal Naval College and the Royal Air Force College Cranwell.

==Location==
Despite its name, the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst&#x27;s address is located in Camberley; the boundaries of the academy straddle the counties of Berkshire and Surrey. The county border is marked by a small stream known as the Wish Stream, after which the academy journal is named. The &quot;Main Gate&quot; is located on the east of the Academy on the London Road in Camberley. The &quot;College Town Gate&quot;, which is used for regular access, is located on the west of the Academy on Yorktown Road in Sandhurst.

==History==
The Royal Military Academy Sandhurst was formed on the site of the former Royal Military College (founded in 1801 for the training of officers for arms other than the Royal Artillery and Royal Engineers) in 1947 when it amalgamated with the Royal Military Academy in Woolwich (founded in 1741 for the training of officers for the Royal Artillery and Royal Engineers).

Following the ending of National Service in the UK and the closing of the Mons Officer Cadet School in Aldershot in 1972, the RMAS became the sole establishment for male initial officer training in the British Army, taking over the responsibilities of Mons for training Short Service Officer Cadets, Territorial Army officers, and those joining the Regular Army as graduates. For nearly half-a-century the welfare of overseas cadets was handled by Sandhurst volunteer Margaret Jones. In 1984, the Women&#x27;s Officer Training College Bagshot was also merged into Sandhurst. In 1992, a new Commissioning Course finally unified the training of male, female, and overseas cadets.

The Royal Military Academy Sandhurst Collection illustrates the history of the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, and the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst. The collection includes the Gentlemen Cadet registers, historic archives, uniforms, paintings, photographs, and other artefacts.

For the 1948 Summer Olympics in London, the newly created Academy hosted the running leg of the modern pentathlon competition.

In 2012, Sandhurst accepted a £15 million donation from the government of United Arab Emirates for the Zayed Building, an accommodation block, named after the UAE&#x27;s founding ruler. In 2013, Sandhurst accepted a donation of £3 million from the Government of Bahrain for the refurbishment of Mons Hall, named in honour of the men who fell in the Battle of Mons. It was renamed as King Hamad Hall in honour of the King of Bahrain, which generated some controversy in the United Kingdom.

In 2015, Sandhurst appointed Colonel Lucy Giles as the first female college commander in its history.

In 2019, Sandhurst gained widespread media attention in Britain after cadet Olivia Perks took her own life after an alleged affair with a superior at Sandhurst and amid fears she was going to be dismissed. In May 2023, an inquest into her death found that the army missed chances to prevent Perks&#x27;s suicide in failing to recognise signs of stress.

==Selection==
Potential officers, for regular, reserve, or professional qualified service, are identified by the Army Officer Selection Board (formerly the Regular Commissions Board, or RCB) situated in Westbury in Wiltshire. Assessment for regular or reserve direct entry service is undertaken at the same time, in the same groups, to the same standard. Nearly 10 per cent of British cadets are female and nearly 10 per cent of all cadets come from overseas. More than eighty percent of entrants are university graduates, although a degree is not required for admission.

==Instructors==
The Royal Military Academy Sandhurst instructors&#x27; cadre (group of trainers) is run once every year. The aim is to select 30 senior non-commissioned officers (SNCOs) from 60 over the course of 3–4 weeks. Instructors can come from any part of the British Army although most are historically from the Infantry. Typically before the 60 candidates arrive on the cadre, they would have had to have passed a &#x27;Divisional pre-selection&#x27; course, meaning it would not be unusual for over double the 60 places to be contested. Sergeants, Staff/Colour Sergeants (Colour Sergeants from Infantry units) attend the Instructors Cadre. The Instructors Cadre is known to be demanding, both physically and mentally, compressing all the prominent physical tests and mental assessments that each officer cadet undertakes over the year course, into 3/4 weeks. No other instructor posting has a selection to pass in order to be a part of a training team.

==Courses==


There are three commissioning courses run at the academy. All are accredited by various academic and professional institutions, in particular the Chartered Management Institute. The Regular Commissioning Course, and increasingly the Short Course, are attended by international officer cadets from other nations&#x27; land forces. The three courses are:

1. The Regular Commissioning Course, which lasts 44 weeks, for Direct Entry officers into the Regular service.

2. The Short Commissioning Course, which is for Army Reserve officers and both regular and reserve service professionally qualified officers (e.g., doctors, dentists, nurses, lawyers, pharmacists, veterinary surgeons and chaplains), which lasts eight weeks. The short course consists of four training modules; the first two, Modules A and B, can be completed under the supervision of RMAS with University Officers&#x27; Training Corps over a number of weekends, or at RMAS where each module lasts two weeks. The final two modules, modules C and D, of the Officers&#x27; training and assessment must be conducted at Sandhurst. This training can all be completed in an eight-week period at RMAS, or over a number of years. Upon completion, Officer Cadets become Second Lieutenants in the Army Reserve (including Officer Training Corps, OTC/UOTC), or Captains in PQO roles.

3. The Late Entry Officer Course (LEOC) for senior soldiers commissioning from the ranks.

The RMAS has an academic faculty staffed by civilian researchers with expertise in Communication and Applied Behavioural Science, Defence and International Affairs, and War Studies.

Unlike some other national military academies such as West Point in the United States, the École spéciale militaire de Saint-Cyr in France, the Royal Military College of Canada in Canada, the Pakistan Military Academy in Pakistan, the Nigerian Defence Academy in Nigeria or the Australian Defence Force Academy in Australia, Sandhurst is not a university. It only works with the Open University to award the Regular Commissioning Course 120 credit points towards a distance learning Honours Degree in International Studies which ultimately requires 360 points. Graduate entrants can gain a Postgraduate Certificate in Leadership and Conflict Studies from the Regular Commissioning Course and then embark on a pathway post-commissioning to complete a full master&#x27;s degree from a university through further electives and a dissertation. Alternatively, non-graduate cadets have the opportunity to earn a BSc in Leadership and Strategic Studies through their military service, which is awarded by the University of Reading.

== Sandhurst Group ==
Under the reforms outlined in the British Army&#x27;s restructuring plan Future Soldier, the Sandhurst Group formation was reorganised, and is under the control of Home Command. The Commander RMAS Group holds the rank of Brigadier and is the overall commander of the Group and the operations of the Royal Military Academy.

The Group is Headquartered at RMA Sandhurst, and takes its name from the Academy. The units that make up Sandhurst Group are:

The insignia used for Sandhurst Group is the same used by the Royal Military Academy and the badge of the Academy features on the Formation Flash for Sandhurst Group.

==Organisation==

In overall command of the RMAS is the Commander - a post established in January 2025 as part of the Sandhurst Group re-organisation where RMAS became a brigadier post as opposed to a major-general post. Whilst there is still a Commandant above the Commander, their post is now a mainly ceremonial one. The Commandant&#x27;s day-to-day job is now to be in charge of the new initial training command. The Commander RMAS is supported by a Deputy Commander (colonel). The senior warrant officer, the Academy Sergeant Major (AcSM), is one of the most senior warrant officers in the British Army. The regular commissioning course is split into three terms, each lasting fourteen weeks (referred to as the Junior, Intermediate and Senior Divisions, identified by differently coloured badges). Basic army training is covered in the first five weeks, which, by reputation, are the most gruelling (the families of the cadets are encouraged to support the cadets&#x27; morale by maintaining home contacts). The main RMAS Commissioning Courses start in January, May and September of each year. Each intake numbers approximately 200 cadets, each of whom is assigned to a platoon within one of two/three companies. Platoons are commanded by captains, with a colour sergeant who takes the main burden of day-to-day training, especially during the first term (unlike West Point, RMAS entrusts the majority of officer training to Senior Non-Commissioned Officers). There can be as many as seven companies within RMAS at any one time. There can be additional companies of Army Reserve or &#x27;professionally qualified officers&#x27; in the Academy who take part in shorter (1–2 months) commissioning courses. Each company is commanded by a major and named after a famous battle or campaign in which the British Army fought.

Officer cadets on the regular commissioning course nominate two regiments or corps that they seek to join during Junior Term. This choice may be influenced by their instructors, by family connections, or by regimental history, among other factors. Each regiment is looking for different qualities in its officers, and each cadet is considered on a case-by-case basis. At the beginning of Senior Term corps and regiments hold interviews, known as Regimental Selection Boards, to assist the corps and regiments in making offers to Officer Cadets. There can be competition among units for strong cadets and, conversely, among cadets for prestigious or specialised units. In the past, cadets might have been offered a so-called &quot;confirmed cadetship&quot;, whereby they would effectively accept a commission into a given regiment prior to commencing the Commissioning Course. As of the January 2023 intake, Confirmed Cadetships are no longer offered to Officer Cadets, other than in very rare cases including technical expertise or a cadet being aged 30 or older when they start the commissioning course. Cadets on the short course will have already been sponsored by a reserve unit, a professionally qualified unit, or a University Officers&#x27; Training Corps, and will return to their unit post completion of the course.

===Regular Army===
A small number of regular army units are based at the RMAS to provide support for the colleges and their training:

* Gurkha Demonstration Company (Sittang): this is a company-sized unit drawn from all units of the Brigade of Gurkhas, to provide an opposing force in battle training for the cadets.
* 44 Support Squadron, Royal Logistic Corps: this is the RMAS&#x27;s permanently based transport, logistic and signals support unit.
* Until 1984, the RMAS had its own band—The RMAS Band Corps.

==Sovereign&#x27;s Parade==
The first Sovereign&#x27;s Parade was held on 14 July 1948, in front of King George VI. Three Sovereign&#x27;s Parades are held each year outside the Old College to mark the &quot;passing-out&quot; and the final parade at Sandhurst of the Senior Division. All cadets, except for those who have been back-termed through injury or other reasons, are inspected by the Sovereign (or their representative), participate in the Trooping the Colour and parade past the Sovereign (or his representative) and guests. Guests consist of invited dignitaries and friends and families of the graduating cadets.

One of the highlights of the Parade is Trooping the Colour. The Colour trooped is the Sovereign&#x27;s Banner and the current banner is the third generation of itself, presented by Elizabeth II in March 1999; the first Sovereign&#x27;s Banner, known as the &quot;King George V&#x27;s Banner&quot;, was presented by George V on 6 November 1918 and the second one was presented by Queen Elizabeth on 27 October 1978.

The honour of Trooping the Colour falls to the Sovereign&#x27;s Platoon, the then-Champion Company/Platoon. The Sovereign&#x27;s Platoon, which wears multi-coloured lanyards, using the colours of all three Divisions, is selected on merit and is the best platoon amongst the Division; these officer cadets are chosen from a competition in drill, orienteering, shooting and a cross-country race, ensuring they are of the best in endurance and teamwork.

In the past, the Sovereign&#x27;s Platoon from the Senior Division formed the Colour Party with the Banner on the left flank of the parade; after the inspecting officer had completed inspection, the Colour Party would move to the centre place of the parade before the Saluting Base, awaiting the new Sovereign&#x27;s Platoon to take possession of the Banner. The new Sovereign&#x27;s Platoon would keep the Banner until handing it to the next Sovereign&#x27;s Platoon in the next Sovereign&#x27;s Parade; they had the privilege of leaving the parade before other divisions after the Senior Division officer cadets had marched into the Old College and the remainders of the parade would salute the banner while they were leaving the parade square.

Nowadays, the handover of the Sovereign&#x27;s Banner from the senior Sovereign&#x27;s Platoon to a new one dissipates. What replaces it is that the Sovereign&#x27;s Platoon of Senior Division, instead of the new one, marches to receive the Banner. The Ensign, at the end of the parade, also marches into the Old College whilst carrying the Banner.

At the end of the Parade, the Colours and the Senior Division leave the parade ground via the Grand Steps of the Old College building. They are followed by the Academy Adjutant on horseback (the origins of this tradition are unclear).

==Awards==
Each Commissioning Course has awards granted to outstanding cadets. The following awards are presented during the Sovereign&#x27;s Parade. Others are merely listed in the Parade programme. A system of Cadet Government also recognises merit by the appointment of Senior Under Officers, Junior Under Officers, Cadet Sergeants and Cadet Corporals.

=== Sandhurst Medal ===

In December 2016, the academy and its charitable trust created the Sandhurst Medal. Unlike most British medals, it is not awarded or authorised by the Sovereign and is instead awarded privately by the Sandhurst Trust. It may only be awarded to international cadets who have passed out from Sandhurst, not British graduates, and must be purchased for £250. Notable graduates such as Abdullah II of Jordan have mounted the medal on their military uniforms.

==Chapel==
There are two chapels within the academy, the Roman Catholic Chapel (Christ the King) and the Royal Memorial Chapel, dedicated as Christ Church, which also contains the South Africa Chapel, which was originally the sanctuary of the second Chapel before it was enlarged. The original chapel was what is now known as the British Indian Army Memorial Room. The Royal Engineers designed the original Chapel, which features red brick, terracotta moulding, interlocking pediment copies and corbels in 1879. The chapel was dedicated by King George VI on 2 May 1937, after architect Captain Arthur C. Martin enlarged the building in a Byzantine style. The Memorial stained glass and Windows in the chapel honour the Brigade of Guards, Rifle Brigade, Royal Fusiliers, and the Hampshire Regiment, among other units. Some memorials, including one honouring alumni of the US Military Academy at West Point, are carved into the black marble flooring. On panels devoted to the particular campaigns in which they died, are the names of former cadets killed in action. At intervals above the panels are circular tablets to the memory of College Governors. The names of former cadets who have died on active service in the field, or elsewhere are listed in the spaces between the panels. Other tablets on the walls of the porch of the Church were moved there from the old Chapel. At the nave near the chancel steps, old Regimental colours hang from the pillars.

The college cemetery has (in 2017) 21 graves and headstones maintained by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission.

<text>The Eddington luminosity, also referred to as the Eddington limit, is the maximum luminosity a body (such as a star) can achieve when there is balance between the force of radiation acting outward and the gravitational force acting inward. The state of balance is called hydrostatic equilibrium. When a star exceeds the Eddington luminosity, it will initiate a very intense radiation-driven stellar wind from its outer layers. Since most massive stars have luminosities far below the Eddington luminosity, their winds are driven mostly by the less intense line absorption. The Eddington limit is invoked to explain the observed luminosities of accreting black holes such as quasars.

Originally, Sir Arthur Eddington took only the electron scattering into account when calculating this limit, something that now is called the classical Eddington limit. Nowadays, the modified Eddington limit also takes into account other radiation processes such as bound–free and free–free radiation interaction.

==Derivation==
The Eddington limit is obtained by setting the outward radiation pressure equal to the inward gravitational force. Both forces decrease by inverse-square laws, so once equality is reached, the hydrodynamic flow is the same throughout the star.

From Euler&#x27;s equation in hydrostatic equilibrium, the mean acceleration is zero,

formula_1

where formula_2 is the velocity, formula_3 is the pressure, formula_4 is the density, and formula_5 is the gravitational potential. If the pressure is dominated by radiation pressure associated with an irradiance formula_6,

formula_7

Here formula_8 is the opacity of the stellar material, defined as the fraction of radiation energy flux absorbed by the medium per unit density and unit length. For ionized hydrogen, formula_9, where formula_10 is the Thomson scattering cross-section for the electron and formula_11 is the mass of a proton. Note that formula_12 is defined as the energy flux over a surface, which can be expressed with the momentum flux using formula_13 for radiation. Therefore, the rate of momentum transfer from the radiation to the gaseous medium per unit density is formula_14, which explains the right-hand side of the above equation.

The luminosity of a source bounded by a surface formula_15 may be expressed with these relations as

formula_16

Now assuming that the opacity is a constant, it can be brought outside the integral. Using Gauss&#x27;s theorem and Poisson&#x27;s equation gives

formula_17

where formula_18 is the mass of the central object. This result is called the Eddington luminosity. For pure ionized hydrogen,

formula_19

where formula_20 is the mass of the Sun and formula_21 is the luminosity of the Sun.

The maximum possible luminosity of a source in hydrostatic equilibrium is the Eddington luminosity. If the luminosity exceeds the Eddington limit, then the radiation pressure drives an outflow.

The mass of the proton appears because, in the typical environment for the outer layers of a star, the radiation pressure acts on electrons, which are driven away from the center. Because protons are negligibly pressured by the analog of Thomson scattering, due to their larger mass, the result is to create a slight charge separation and therefore a radially directed electric field, acting to lift the positive charges, which, under the conditions in stellar atmospheres, typically are free protons. When the outward electric field is sufficient to levitate the protons against gravity, both electrons and protons are expelled together.

===Different limits for different materials===
The derivation above for the outward light pressure assumes a hydrogen plasma. In other circumstances the pressure balance can be different from what it is for hydrogen.

In an evolved star with a pure helium atmosphere, the electric field would have to lift a helium nucleus (an alpha particle), with nearly 4 times the mass of a proton, while the radiation pressure would act on 2 free electrons. Thus twice the usual Eddington luminosity would be needed to drive off an atmosphere of pure helium.

At very high temperatures, as in the environment of a black hole or neutron star, high-energy photons can interact with nuclei, or even with other photons, to create an electron–positron plasma. In that situation the combined mass of the positive–negative charge carrier pair is approximately 918 times smaller (half of the proton-to-electron mass ratio), while the radiation pressure on the positrons doubles the effective upward force per unit mass, so the limiting luminosity needed is reduced by a factor of ≈ 918×2.

The exact value of the Eddington luminosity depends on the chemical composition of the gas layer and the spectral energy distribution of the emission. A gas with cosmological abundances of hydrogen and helium is much more transparent than gas with solar abundance ratios. Atomic line transitions can greatly increase the effects of radiation pressure, and line-driven winds exist in some bright stars (e.g., Wolf–Rayet and O-type stars).

==Super-Eddington luminosities==

The role of the Eddington limit in today&#x27;s research lies in explaining the very high mass loss rates seen in, for example, the series of outbursts of η Carinae in 1840–1860. The regular, line-driven stellar winds can only explain a mass loss rate of around ~ solar masses per year, whereas losses of up to per year are needed to understand the η Carinae outbursts. This can be done with the help of the super-Eddington winds driven by broad-spectrum radiation.

Gamma-ray bursts, novae and supernovae are examples of systems exceeding their Eddington luminosity by a large factor for very short times, resulting in short and highly intensive mass loss rates. Some X-ray binaries and active galaxies are able to maintain luminosities close to the Eddington limit for very long times. For accretion-powered sources such as accreting neutron stars or cataclysmic variables (accreting white dwarfs), the limit may act to reduce or cut off the accretion flow, imposing an Eddington limit on accretion corresponding to that on luminosity. Super-Eddington accretion onto stellar-mass black holes is one possible model for ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXSs).

For accreting black holes, not all the energy released by accretion has to appear as outgoing luminosity, since energy can be lost through the event horizon, down the hole. Such sources effectively may not conserve energy. Then the accretion efficiency, or the fraction of energy actually radiated of that theoretically available from the gravitational energy release of accreting material, enters in an essential way.

== Other factors ==
The Eddington limit is not a strict limit on the luminosity of a stellar object. The limit does not consider several potentially important factors, and super-Eddington objects have been observed that do not seem to have the predicted high mass-loss rate. Other factors that might affect the maximum luminosity of a star include:

*Porosity. A problem with steady winds driven by broad-spectrum radiation is that both the radiative flux and gravitational acceleration scale with &quot;r&quot;−2. The ratio between these factors is constant, and in a super-Eddington star, the whole envelope would become gravitationally unbound at the same time. This is not observed. A possible solution is introducing an atmospheric porosity, where we imagine the stellar atmosphere to consist of denser regions surrounded by regions of lower-density gas. This would reduce the coupling between radiation and matter, and the full force of the radiation field would be seen only in the more homogeneous outer, lower-density layers of the atmosphere.
*Turbulence. A possible destabilizing factor might be the turbulent pressure arising when energy in the convection zones builds up a field of supersonic turbulence. The importance of turbulence is being debated, however.
*Photon bubbles. Another factor that might explain some stable super-Eddington objects is the photon bubble effect. Photon bubbles would develop spontaneously in radiation-dominated atmospheres when the radiation pressure exceeds the gas pressure. We can imagine a region in the stellar atmosphere with a density lower than the surroundings, but with a higher radiation pressure. Such a region would rise through the atmosphere, with radiation diffusing in from the sides, leading to an even higher radiation pressure. This effect could transport radiation more efficiently than a homogeneous atmosphere, increasing the allowed total radiation rate. Accretion discs may exhibit luminosities as high as 10–100 times the Eddington limit without experiencing instabilities.

==Humphreys–Davidson limit==
Observations of massive stars show a clear upper limit to their luminosity, termed the Humphreys–Davidson limit after the researchers who first wrote about it.
Only highly unstable objects are found, temporarily, at higher luminosities. Efforts to reconcile this with the theoretical Eddington limit have been largely unsuccessful.

The H–D limit for cool supergiants is placed at around 320,000 .

<text>In mathematics, the Menger sponge (also known as the Menger cube, Menger universal curve, Sierpinski cube, or Sierpinski sponge) is a fractal curve. It is a three-dimensional generalization of the one-dimensional Cantor set and two-dimensional Sierpinski carpet. It was first described by Karl Menger in 1926, in his studies of the concept of topological dimension.

==Construction==
The construction of a Menger sponge can be described as follows:
# Begin with a cube.
# Divide every face of the cube into nine squares in a similar manner to a Rubik&#x27;s Cube. This sub-divides the cube into 27 smaller cubes.
# Remove the smaller cube in the middle of each face, and remove the smaller cube in the center of the larger cube, leaving 20 smaller cubes. This is a level-1 Menger sponge (resembling a void cube).
# Repeat steps two and three for each of the remaining smaller cubes, and continue to iterate &quot;ad infinitum&quot;.

The second iteration gives a level-2 sponge, the third iteration gives a level-3 sponge, and so on. The Menger sponge itself is the limit of this process after an infinite number of iterations.

==Properties==

The formula_1th stage of the Menger sponge, formula_2, is made up of formula_3 smaller cubes, each with a side length of (1/3)&quot;n&quot;. The total volume of formula_2 is thus formula_5. The total surface area of formula_2 is given by the expression formula_7. Therefore, the construction&#x27;s volume approaches zero while its surface area increases without bound. Yet any chosen surface in the construction will be thoroughly punctured as the construction continues so that the limit is neither a solid nor a surface; it has a topological dimension of 1 and is accordingly identified as a curve.

Each face of the construction becomes a Sierpinski carpet, and the intersection of the sponge with any diagonal of the cube or any midline of the faces is a Cantor set. The cross-section of the sponge through its centroid and perpendicular to a space diagonal is a regular hexagon punctured with hexagrams arranged in six-fold symmetry. The number of these hexagrams, in descending size, is given by the following recurrence relation:formula_8, with formula_9.

The sponge&#x27;s Hausdorff dimension is ≅ 2.727. The Lebesgue covering dimension of the Menger sponge is one, the same as any curve. Menger showed, in the 1926 construction, that the sponge is a &quot;universal curve&quot;, in that every curve is homeomorphic to a subset of the Menger sponge, where a &quot;curve&quot; means any compact metric space of Lebesgue covering dimension one; this includes trees and graphs with an arbitrary countable number of edges, vertices and closed loops, connected in arbitrary ways. Similarly, the Sierpinski carpet is a universal curve for all curves that can be drawn on the two-dimensional plane. The Menger sponge constructed in three dimensions extends this idea to graphs that are not planar and might be embedded in any number of dimensions.

In 2024, Broden, Nazareth, and Voth proved that all knots can also be found within a Menger sponge.

The Menger sponge is a closed set; since it is also bounded, the Heine–Borel theorem implies that it is compact. It has Lebesgue measure 0. Because it contains continuous paths, it is an uncountable set.

Experiments also showed that cubes with a Menger sponge-like structure could dissipate shocks five times better for the same material than cubes without any pores.

==Formal definition==
Formally, a Menger sponge can be defined as follows (using set intersection):

:formula_10

where formula_11 is the unit cube and

:formula_12

==MegaMenger==
MegaMenger was a project aiming to build the largest fractal model, pioneered by Matt Parker of Queen Mary University of London and Laura Taalman of James Madison University. Each small cube is made from six interlocking folded business cards, giving a total of 960 000 for a level-four sponge. The outer surfaces are then covered with paper or cardboard panels printed with a Sierpinski carpet design to be more aesthetically pleasing. In 2014, twenty level-three Menger sponges were constructed, which combined would form a distributed level-four Menger sponge.

==Similar fractals==
===Jerusalem cube===
A &quot;Jerusalem cube&quot; is a fractal object first described by Eric Baird in 2011. It is created by recursively drilling Greek cross-shaped holes into a cube. The construction is similar to the Menger sponge but with two different-sized cubes. The name comes from the face of the cube resembling a Jerusalem cross pattern.

The construction of the Jerusalem cube can be described as follows:
# Start with a cube.
# Cut a cross through each side of the cube, leaving eight cubes (of rank +1) at the corners of the original cube, as well as twelve smaller cubes (of rank +2) centered on the edges of the original cube between cubes of rank +1.
# Repeat the process on the cubes of ranks 1 and 2.

Iterating an infinite number of times results in the Jerusalem cube.

Since the edge length of a cube of rank N is equal to that of 2 cubes of rank N+1 and a cube of rank N+2, it follows that the scaling factor must satisfy formula_13, therefore formula_14 which means the fractal cannot be constructed using points on a rational lattice.

Since a cube of rank N gets subdivided into 8 cubes of rank N+1 and 12 of rank N+2, the Hausdorff dimension must therefore satisfy formula_15. The exact solution is
:formula_16
which is approximately 2.529

As with the Menger sponge, the faces of a Jerusalem cube are fractals with the same scaling factor. In this case, the Hausdorff dimension must satisfy formula_17. The exact solution is
:formula_18
which is approximately 1.786

<text>The Blue Dahlia is a 1946 American crime film and film noir with an original screenplay by Raymond Chandler directed by George Marshall and starring Alan Ladd, Veronica Lake and William Bendix. It was Chandler&#x27;s first original screenplay.

==Plot==
Three demobilized United States Navy aviators, Johnny Morrison, Buzz Wanchek, and George Copeland, arrive in Hollywood, California. All three flew together in the same flight crew from Kwajalein Atoll in the South Pacific. Buzz has shell shock and a metal plate in his head above his ear.

While George and Buzz get an apartment together, Johnny surprises his wife, Helen, at her hotel bungalow where she is hosting a riotous party with many drunken revellers. Johnny discovers that Helen is having an affair with Eddie Harwood, the owner of the Blue Dahlia nightclub on the Sunset Strip. Johnny punches Eddie as he leaves and then apologizes for losing his temper. The party ends and everybody leaves. Helen, drunk, confesses to Johnny that their son, Dickie, who Johnny believed died of diphtheria, actually died in a car crash that happened because she was driving while drunk. Johnny and Helen scuffle, which is witnessed by the hotel detective, &quot;Dad&quot; Newell. Johnny decides to leave. He pulls a gun on Helen, states &#x27;that&#x27;s what you deserve,&#x27; but drops the gun on a chair and leaves.

Buzz goes out to find Johnny at his hotel bungalow. He meets Helen Morrison in the hotel bar and, unaware of her identity, goes to her bungalow for a drink to wait for Mrs Morrison.

Helen rings Eddie who breaks up with her over the phone. However, she then blackmails him into seeing her again. Eddie visits Helen at her bungalow; this is witnessed by the hotel detective.

Johnny is picked up by Joyce Harwood (who is driving to Malibu) while walking in the rain. She is estranged from Eddie. Neither reveals their names. Although attracted to each other, they part ways and Johnny spends the night in a beach-side inn. The next morning, at the same inn, Joyce sees Johnny at breakfast and reveals that she stayed at the same inn. They decide to walk on the beach to look for moonstones. Whilst purchasing a bus ticket for Los Angeles, Johnny hears the radio announce that Helen has been murdered and that Johnny is suspected. He then quickly leaves to board a bus.

The police interview Newell, Harwood, Buzz, and George.

Johnny checks in to a cheap hotel in Los Angeles under an assumed name. Corelli, the hotel manager, finds Johnny&#x27;s framed photo of himself with Dickie and tries to blackmail him. Johnny punches Corelli out, smashing the frame in the process; he discovers on the back of the photo that Helen has written an insurance note revealing that Eddie is really Bauer, a murderer who is wanted in New Jersey.

Corelli revives and sells information on Johnny&#x27;s identity to a gangster named Leo (the nightclub partner of Eddie), who then kidnaps Johnny when he visits George and Buzz.

Buzz and George visit Eddie at the Blue Dahlia. Joyce, who has agreed to meet Eddie, introduces herself. As Joyce picks at a blue dahlia flower, the nightclub&#x27;s music sets off a painful ring in Buzz&#x27;s head. Lapsing into a fit, he remembers the agonizing music that he heard at Helen&#x27;s bungalow, as she played with a blue dahlia.

Johnny escapes Leo and his side-kick, knocking them both out just before Eddie arrives. They talk and Eddie admits with regret that, fifteen years earlier, he was involved in the shooting of a bank messenger.

Leo comes around and tries to shoot Johnny, but during a scuffle, he shoots Eddie instead. Johnny ends up shooting Leo and flees to the Blue Dahlia, where the police are trying to force a confused Buzz to admit that he killed Helen.

Johnny enters and suggests that Joyce turn up the jazz music that Buzz hates. As his head pounds, Buzz remembers leaving Helen alive in her bungalow. Newell tries to shift suspicion towards George, then attempts to leave as Police Captain Hendrickson confronts Newell with the accusation that he tried to blackmail Helen about her affair, and that he killed her when she refused to comply. Newell then tries to escape from the office but is shot dead by Hendrickson when he pulls his own gun.

Later, outside the Blue Dahlia, Buzz and George decide to go for a drink, leaving Johnny and Joyce together.

==Production==
===Development===
In 1945 Alan Ladd was one of Paramount&#x27;s top stars. He had served for ten months in the army in 1943 before being honorably discharged due to illness; however, he had recently been reclassified 1-A for the military draft, and he might have had to go back into the Army. Paramount kept applying for deferments so he could make films but Ladd was due for induction in May 1945.

The studio wanted to make a movie starring him before that happened, but had nothing suitable. Producer John Houseman knew Raymond Chandler from having collaborated on Paramount&#x27;s &quot;The Unseen&quot;, which Houseman produced and Chandler rewrote. Houseman says Chandler had started a novel but was &quot;stuck&quot; and was considering turning it into a screenplay for the movies instead. Houseman read the 120 pages Chandler had written and, within 48 hours, it was sold to Paramount. Houseman would produce it under the supervision of Joseph Sistrom.

It was the first original script for the screen that Chandler had ever written. He wrote the first half of the script in under six weeks and sent it to Paramount. Delighted, the studio arranged for filming to start in three weeks&#x27; time.

Paramount announced the film in February 1945, with Ladd, Lake, Bendix and Marshall (the director) all attached from the beginning. Houseman said George Marshall had a reputation for rewriting extensively on the set and had to persuade him to stick to the script. (Marshall said he was so impressed with the writing he never had any intention of rewriting.)

Houseman recalled that Ladd was unhappy with the casting of Doris Dowling as his wife because she was half a foot taller than he but this was disguised during their scenes together.

===Shooting===
Shooting began in March 1945 without a completed screenplay. Houseman was not worried initially because of his confidence in Chandler. He says four weeks into filming the studio began to worry as they were running out of script. &quot;We had shot sixty-two pages in four weeks; Chandler, during that time, had turned in only twenty-two—with another thirty to go.&quot;

The problem was the ending. Originally, Chandler intended the killer to be Buzz having a blackout. However, the Navy did not want a serviceman to be portrayed as a murderer, and Paramount told Chandler that he had to come up with a new ending. Chandler responded at first with writer&#x27;s block. Paramount offered Chandler a $5,000 incentive to finish the script, which did not work, according to Houseman:It was the front-office calculation, I suppose, that by dangling this fresh carrot before Chandler&#x27;s nose they were executing a brilliant and cunning maneuver. They did not know their man. They succeeded, instead, in disturbing him in three distinct and separate ways: One, his faith in himself was destroyed. By never letting Ray share my apprehensions, I had convinced him of my confidence in his ability to finish the script on time. This sense of security was now hopelessly shattered. Two, he had been insulted. To Ray, the bonus was nothing but a bribe. To be offered a large additional sum of money for the completion of an assignment for which he had already contracted and which he had every intention of fulfilling was by his standards a degradation and a dishonor. Three, by going to him behind my back they had invited him to betray a friend and fellow Public School man. The way the interview had been conducted (&#x27;sneakily&#x27;) filled Ray with humiliation and rage.
Chandler wanted to quit, but Houseman convinced him to sleep on it. The next day, Chandler said he would be able to finish the film if he resumed drinking. Houseman said that the writer&#x27;s requirements were &quot;two Cadillac limousines, to stand day and night outside the house with drivers available&quot;, &quot;six secretaries&quot;, and &quot;a direct line open at all times to my office by day, to the studio switchboard at night and to my home at all times.&quot; Houseman agreed and says Chandler then started drinking:

[Chandler] did not minimize the hazards [of drinking]&quot;, said Houseman in 1964, &quot;He pointed out that his plan... would call for deep faith on my part and supreme courage on his, since he would in effect be completing the script at the risk of his life. (It wasn&#x27;t the drinking that was dangerous, he explained, since he had a doctor who gave him such massive injections of glucose that he could last for weeks with no solid food at all. It was the sobering up that was parlous; the terrible strain of his return to normal living).&quot;

At the end of that time, Chandler presented the finished script.

Chandler was unhappy with the forced ending, saying it made &quot;a routine whodunnit out of a fairly original idea.&quot; He also disliked the performance of Lake. &quot;The only times she&#x27;s good is when she keeps her mouth shut and looks mysterious&quot;, he told a friend. &quot;The moment she tries to behave as if she had a brain she falls flat on her face. The scenes we had to cut out because she loused them up! And there are three godawful close shots of her looking perturbed that make me want to throw my lunch over the fence.&quot;

Chandler received a lot of deference on the set, but Lake was not familiar with him so, upon asking about him and being told, &quot;He&#x27;s the greatest mystery writer around&quot;, she made a point of listening intently to an analysis of his work by the film&#x27;s publicity director to impress newspaper reporters with her knowledge of a writer she had never read. Chandler developed an intense dislike for Lake and referred to her as &quot;Moronica Lake&quot;.

Lake later said about her role, &quot;I&#x27;m not much of a motivating force, but the part is good.&quot;

By May 1945, the government ruled that all men aged 30 or over would be released from the obligation to go back into the Army. Ladd did not have to re-enlist after all.

==Reception and legacy==
===Box office===
&quot;The Blue Dahlia&quot; ranked among the most popular films at the British box office in 1946.

===Critical response===
In a contemporary review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, critic Bosley Crowther called the film &quot;a honey of a rough-&#x27;em-up romance&quot; and wrote: &quot;[A]n air of deepening mystery overhangs this tempestuous tale which shall render it none the less intriguing to those lovers of the brutal and bizarre. ... George Marshall has tautly directed from Mr. Chandler&#x27;s crafty script. The tact of all this may be severely questioned, but it does make a brisk, exciting show.&quot;

&quot;Variety&quot; magazine wrote: &quot;Playing a discharged naval flier returning home from the Pacific first to find his wife unfaithful, then to find her murdered and himself in hiding as the suspect, Alan Ladd does a bangup job. Performance has a warm appeal, while in his relentless track down of the real criminal, Ladd has a cold, steel-like quality that is potent. Fight scenes are stark and brutal, and tremendously effective.&quot;

&quot;James Agee&quot;, critic and author writing in 1946, called the film &quot;convincing and entertaining in a dry, nervous, electric way...I hope there will be more films of the quality of &quot;The Blue Dahlia&quot;...The picture is as neatly stylized and synchronized, and as uninterested in moral excitement, as a good ballet; it knows its own weight and size perfectly and carries them gracefully and without self-importance; it is...about as good a movie as can be expected from the big factories. In its own uninsistent way, for that matter, it does carry a certain amount of social criticism. For it crawls with American types; and their mannerisms and affectations, and their chief preoccupations--blackmail and what&#x27;s-in-it-for-me--all seem to me to reflect, however coolly, things that are deeply characteristic of this civilization.&quot; 

&quot;Diabolique&quot; called it &quot;a fantastic film noir, full of atmosphere, intrigue, crackling dialogue and sensational performances, which was recognized as a classic almost immediately and made a tonne of money.&quot;
The film&#x27;s title could have been the origin of the Black Dahlia nickname, given to 1947 murder victim Elizabeth Short.

Rotten Tomatoes reports that 100% of its critics gave the film a positive review, based on 11 reviews.

===Awards and honors===
Chandler was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay.

==Adaptations==
&quot;The Blue Dahlia&quot; was dramatized as a half-hour radio play on the April 21, 1949 broadcast of &quot;The Screen Guild Theater&quot;, starring Lake and Ladd in their original film roles. The movie was also adapted into a stage play in 1989.

Houseman&#x27;s narrative of the film&#x27;s creation was dramatized for BBC Radio by Ray Connolly in 2009.

<doc id="208816" wikidata="Q1428303" url="?curid=208816" title="FITS">
<text>Flexible Image Transport System (FITS) is an open standard defining a digital file format useful for storage, transmission and processing of data: formatted as multi-dimensional arrays (for example a 2D image), or tables. FITS is the most commonly used digital file format in astronomy. The FITS standard was designed specifically for astronomical data, and includes provisions such as describing photometric and spatial calibration information, together with image origin metadata.

The FITS format was first standardized in 1981; it has evolved gradually since then, and the most recent version (4.0) was standardized in 2016. FITS was designed with an eye towards long-term archival storage, and the maxim &quot;once FITS, always FITS&quot; represents the requirement that developments to the format must be backward compatible.

Image metadata is stored in a human-readable ASCII header. The information in this header is designed to calculate the byte offset of some information in the subsequent data unit to support direct access to the data cells. Each FITS file consists of one or more headers containing ASCII card images (80 character fixed-length strings) that carry keyword/value pairs, interleaved between data blocks. The keyword/value pairs provide information such as size, origin, coordinates, binary data format, free-form comments, history of the data, and anything else the creator desires: while many keywords are reserved for FITS use, the standard allows arbitrary use of the rest of the name-space.

FITS is also often used to store non-image data, such as spectra, photon lists, data cubes, or structured data such as multi-table databases. A FITS file may contain several extensions, and each of these may contain a data object. For example, it is possible to store x-ray and infrared exposures in the same file.

== Composition ==

The earliest and still most commonly used type of FITS data is an image header/data block. The term &#x27;image&#x27; is somewhat loosely applied, as the format supports data arrays of arbitrary dimension—normal image data are usually 2-D or 3-D, with the third dimension representing for example time or the color plane. The data themselves may be in one of several integer and floating-point formats, specified in the header.

FITS image headers can contain information about one or more scientific coordinate systems that are overlaid on the image itself. Images contain an implicit Cartesian coordinate system that describes the location of each pixel in the image, but scientific uses usually require working in &#x27;world&#x27; coordinates, for example the celestial coordinate system. As FITS has been generalized from its original form, the world coordinate system (WCS) specifications have become more and more sophisticated: early FITS images allowed a simple scaling factor to represent the size of the pixels; but recent versions of the standard permit multiple nonlinear coordinate systems, representing arbitrary distortions of the image. The WCS standard includes many different spherical projections, including, for example, the HEALPix spherical projection widely used in observing the cosmic microwave background radiation.

FITS also supports tabular data with named columns and multidimensional rows. Both binary and ASCII table formats have been specified. The data in each column of the table can be in a different format from the others. Together with the ability to string multiple header/data blocks together, this allows FITS files to represent entire relational databases.

== Adoption ==
FITS support is available in a variety of programming languages that are used for scientific work, including C, C++, C#, Fortran, IGOR Pro, IDL, Java, Julia, LabVIEW, Mathematica, MATLAB, Perl, Perl Data Language (PDL), Python, R, and Tcl. The FITS Support Office at NASA/GSFC maintains a list of libraries and platforms that currently support FITS.

Image processing programs such as ImageJ, GIMP, Photoshop, PhotoLine, Chasys Draw IES, XnView and IrfanView can generally read simple FITS images, but frequently cannot interpret more complex tables and databases. Scientific teams frequently write their own code to interact with their FITS data, using the tools available in their language of choice. The FITS Liberator software is used by imaging scientists at the European Space Agency, the European Southern Observatory and NASA. The SAOImage DS9 Astronomical Data Visualization Application is available for many OSs, and handles images and headers.

Many scientific computing environments make use of the coordinate system data in the FITS header to display, compare, rectify, or otherwise manipulate FITS images. Examples are the coordinate transform library included with PDL, the PLOT MAP library in the Solarsoft solar-physics-related software tree, the Starlink Project AST library in C, and the PyFITS package in Python, now merged into the Astropy library.

== Current status ==

The FITS standard version 4.0 was officially approved by the IAU FITS Working Group in July 2016.

<text>Bury St Edmunds (), commonly referred to locally as &quot;Bury,&quot; is a cathedral as well as market town and civil parish in the West Suffolk district, in the county of Suffolk, England. The town is best known for Bury St Edmunds Abbey and St Edmundsbury Cathedral. Bury is the seat of the Diocese of St Edmundsbury and Ipswich of the Church of England, with the episcopal see at St Edmundsbury Cathedral. In 2011, it had a population of 45,000. The town, originally called Beodericsworth, was built on a grid pattern by Abbot Baldwin around 1080. It is known for brewing and malting (Greene King brewery) and for a British Sugar processing factory, where Silver Spoon sugar is produced. The town is the cultural and retail centre for West Suffolk and tourism is a major part of the economy.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Bury&quot; is etymologically connected with &quot;borough&quot;, which has cognates in other Germanic languages such as German &#x27;fortress, castle&#x27; and &#x27;(defined) area&#x27; Old Norse &#x27;wall, castle&#x27;; and Gothic &#x27;city&#x27;. They all derive from Proto-Germanic &#x27;fortress&#x27;. This in turn derives from the Proto-Indo-European root &#x27;fortified elevation&#x27;, with cognates including Welsh &quot;&quot; &#x27;stack&#x27; and Sanskrit &quot;-&quot; &#x27;high, elevated building&#x27;.

The second section of the name refers to Edmund, King of the East Angles, called Edmund the Martyr, who was killed by the Vikings in the year 869. He became venerated as a saint and a martyr, and his shrine made Bury St Edmunds an important place of pilgrimage.

The formal name of the diocese is &quot;St Edmundsbury&quot;, and the town is colloquially known as Bury.

==History==

An archaeological study in the 2010s on the outskirts of Bury St Edmunds (Beodericsworth, Bedrichesworth, St Edmund&#x27;s Bury) uncovered evidence of Bronze Age activity in the area. The dig also uncovered Roman coins from the first and second centuries. Samuel Lewis, writing in 1848, notes the earlier discovery of Roman antiquities, and as with several other writers connects Bury St Edmunds with &quot;Villa Faustini&quot; or &quot;Villa Faustina&quot;, although the location of this Roman site is also discussed by E. Gillingwater (1804), who notes the lack of evidence for it being here.

The town was one of the royal boroughs of the Saxons. Sigebert, king of the East Angles, founded a monastery here about 633, which in 903 became the burial place of King Edmund the Martyr, who was slain by the Danes in 869, and owed most of its early celebrity to the reputed miracles performed at the shrine of the martyr king. The town grew around Bury St Edmunds Abbey, a site of pilgrimage. By 925 the fame of St Edmund had spread far and wide, and the name of the town was changed to St Edmund&#x27;s Bury.

In 942 or 945, King Edmund I had granted to the abbot and convent jurisdiction over the whole town, free from all secular services, and Canute in 1020 freed it from episcopal control. Later, Edward the Confessor made the abbot lord of the franchise. The older monastery was destroyed and, the secular priests having been expelled, a new Benedictine abbey was built. Count Alan Rufus is said to have been interred at Bury St Edmunds Abbey in 1093. In the 12th and 13th centuries the head of the de Hastings family, who held the Lordship of the Manor of Ashill in Norfolk, was hereditary Steward of this abbey.

The town was for a time the home of a thriving Jewish community, and it is likely, although not certain, that Moyse&#x27;s Hall belonged to a Jewish merchant. On 18 March 1190, two days after the more well-known massacre of Jews at Clifford Tower in York, the people of Bury St Edmunds massacred 57 Jews. Later that year, Abbot Samson successfully petitioned King Richard I for permission to evict the town&#x27;s remaining Jewish inhabitants &quot;on the grounds that everything in the town... belonged by right to St Edmund: therefore, either the Jews should be St Edmund&#x27;s men or they should be banished from the town.&quot; This expulsion predates the Edict of Expulsion by 100 years. In 1198, a fire burned the shrine of St Edmund, leading to the inspection of his corpse by Abbot Samson and the translation of St Edmund&#x27;s body to a new location in the abbey.

The town is associated with Magna Carta. In 1214 the barons of England are believed to have met in the abbey church and sworn to force King John to accept the Charter of Liberties, the document which influenced the creation of Magna Carta, a copy of which was displayed in the town&#x27;s cathedral during the 2014 celebrations. By various grants from the abbots, the town gradually attained the rank of a borough.

Henry III in 1235 granted to the abbot two annual fairs, one in December and the other the great St Matthew&#x27;s fair, which was abolished by the Fairs Act of 1871. In 1327, the Great Riot occurred, in which the local populace led an armed revolt against the abbey. The riot destroyed the main gate, and a new, fortified gate was built in its stead. On 11 April 1608 a &quot;great fire&quot; broke out in Eastgate Street, which resulted in 160 dwellings and 400 outhouses being destroyed.

The town developed into a flourishing cloth-making town, with a large woollen trade, by the 14th century. In 1405 Henry IV granted another fair.

Elizabeth I in 1562 confirmed the charters which former kings had granted to the abbots. The reversion of the fairs and two markets on Wednesday and Saturday were granted by James I in fee farm to the corporation. James I in 1606 granted a charter of incorporation with an annual fair in Easter week and a market. James granted further charters in 1608 and 1614, as did Charles II in 1668 and 1684.

Parliaments were held in the borough in 1272, 1296 and 1446, but the borough was not represented until 1608, when James I conferred on it the privilege of sending two members. The Redistribution of Seats Act 1885 reduced the representation to one.

The borough of Bury St Edmunds and the surrounding area, like much of East Anglia, being part of the Eastern Association, supported Puritan sentiment during the first half of the 17th century. By 1640, several families had departed for the Massachusetts Bay Colony as part of the wave of emigration that occurred during the Great Migration. Bury&#x27;s ancient grammar school also educated such notables as the puritan theologian Richard Sibbes, master of St Catherine&#x27;s Hall in Cambridge, antiquary and politician Simonds d&#x27;Ewes, and John Winthrop the Younger, who became governor of Connecticut.

The town was the setting for witch trials between 1599 and 1694.
===Modern history===
The population had reached 12,538 by 1841.

A permanent military presence was established in the town with the completion of the Militia Barracks in 1857 and of Gibraltar Barracks in 1878.

During the Second World War, the USAAF used Rougham Airfield outside the town.

On 3 March 1974 a Turkish Airlines DC10 jet Flight 981 crashed near Paris killing all 346 people on board. Among the victims were 17 members of Bury St Edmunds Rugby Football Club, returning from France.

==Notable features==

Near the abbey gardens stands Britain&#x27;s first internally illuminated street sign, the Pillar of Salt, which was built in 1935. The sign is at the terminus of the A1101, Great Britain&#x27;s lowest road which is mostly below sea level.

There is a network of tunnels which are evidence of chalk-workings, though there is no evidence of extensive tunnels under the town centre. Some buildings have inter-communicating cellars. Due to their unsafe nature the chalk-workings are not open to the public, although viewing has been granted to individuals. Some have caused subsidence within living memory, for instance at Jacqueline Close.

Among noteworthy buildings is St Mary&#x27;s Church, Bury St Edmunds, where Mary Tudor, Queen of France and sister of Tudor king Henry VIII, was re-buried, six years after her death, having been moved from the abbey after her brother&#x27;s Dissolution of the Monasteries. Queen Victoria had a stained glass window fitted into the church to commemorate Mary&#x27;s interment. Moreton Hall, a Grade II*listed building by Robert Adam, houses the now-closed Moreton Hall Preparatory School. Bury St Edmunds Guildhall dates back to the late 12th century.

Bury St Edmunds has one of the full-time fire stations run by Suffolk Fire and Rescue Service. Originally located in the Traverse (now the Halifax bank), it moved to Fornham Road in 1953. The Fornham Road site (now Mermaid Close) closed in 1987 and the fire station moved to its current location on Parkway North.

Since March 2015, Bury St Edmunds has been the home town of the London and South East Regional Divorce Unit and the Maintenance Enforcement Business Centre (for issues with maintenance payments outside Greater London). The former processes divorce documents from across London and South East England as one of five centralised units covering the United Kingdom. Both units are based with Bury St Edmunds County Court in Triton House, St Andrews Street North.

==Geography==
Bury is located in the middle of an undulating area of East Anglia known as the East Anglian Heights, with land to the east and west of the town rising to above , though parts of the town itself are as low as above sea level where the Rivers Lark and Linnet pass through it.

===Climate===
There are two Met Office reporting stations in the vicinity of Bury St Edmunds, Brooms Barn (elevation ), west of the town centre, and Honington (elevation ), about north. According to Usman Majeed, head of Honington, the latter ceased weather observations in 2003, while Brooms Barn remains operational. Brooms Barn&#x27;s record maximum temperature stands at , recorded in August 2003. The lowest recent temperature was during December 2010.

Rainfall is generally low, at under , and spread fairly evenly throughout the year.

==Religion==
The town has a Christian heritage dating back to the foundation of the abbey in 1020. Today there are many active churches in the town.

===Abbey===

In the centre of Bury St Edmunds lie the remains of an abbey, surrounded by the abbey gardens. The abbey is a shrine to Saint Edmund, the Saxon King of the East Angles. The abbey was sacked by the townspeople in the 14th century and then largely destroyed during the 16th century with the Dissolution of the Monasteries, but the town remained prosperous throughout the 17th and 18th centuries, only falling into relative decline with the Industrial Revolution.

=== Anglican Churches ===
Until the building of St John&#x27;s in 1840, the town had just two parishes, St James&#x27;s and St Mary&#x27;s. The former has now become the cathedral. The town now has seven Anglican churches in six parishes, St Peter&#x27;s being in the same parish as St Mary&#x27;s.

====Cathedral====

St James&#x27; parish church became St Edmundsbury Cathedral when the Diocese of St Edmundsbury and Ipswich was formed in 1914. The cathedral was extended with an eastern end in the 1960s. A new Gothic revival cathedral tower was built as part of a Millennium project running from 2000 to 2005. The opening for the tower took place in July 2005, and included a brass band concert and fireworks. Parts of the cathedral remain uncompleted, including the cloisters. The tower makes St Edmundsbury the most recently completed Anglican cathedral in the UK, and was constructed using original fabrication techniques by six masons who placed the machine-cut stones individually as they arrived.

====St Mary&#x27;s Church====

St Mary&#x27;s Church is the civic church of Bury St Edmunds and the third largest parish church in England. It was part of the abbey complex and originally was one of three large churches in the town (the others being St James, now St Edmundsbury Cathedral, and St Margaret&#x27;s, now gone). It is renowned for its magnificent hammer-beam &quot;angel&quot; roof, and is the final resting place of Mary Tudor, Queen of France, Duchess of Suffolk and favourite sister of Henry VIII. St Mary&#x27;s is also home to the Chapel of the Suffolk and Royal Anglian Regiments.

===Sugar beet===
Bury&#x27;s largest landmark is the British Sugar factory near the A14, which processes sugar beet into refined crystal sugar. It was built in 1925 when the town&#x27;s MP, Walter Guinness, was Minister of Agriculture, and for many of its early years was managed by Martin Neumann, former manager of a sugar beet refinery in Šurany, then part of Czechoslovakia. Neumann was invited by the British government to oversee the refinement of sugar in Bury St Edmunds and, with his family, immigrated to the United Kingdom. The actor and writer Stephen Fry is a grandson of Martin Neumann, as recounted in the BBC programme &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot;

The refinery processes beet from 1,300 growers. 660 lorry-loads of beet can be accepted each day when beet is being harvested. Not all the beet can be crystallised immediately, and some is kept in solution in holding tanks until late spring and early summer, when the plant has spare crystallising capacity. The sugar is sold under the Silver Spoon name (the other major British brand, Tate &amp; Lyle, is made from imported sugar cane). By-products include molassed sugar beet feed for cattle and LimeX70, a soil improver. The factory has its own power station, which powers around 110,000 homes. A smell of burnt starch from the plant is noticeable on some days.

In March 2008 a further by-election put Conservatives in control but in the council election of May 2011 the lack of Conservative and other parties&#x27; candidates resulted a Labour majority before the election was held. By 2013 a number of by-elections put Conservatives in control again and in the 2015 election Conservatives won 14 of the 17 vacancies. In 2020 it was announced that the town council would meet in the Guildhall, the historic home of the borough council between 1606 and 1966.

There are regular bus services to the neighbouring towns of Brandon, Cambridge, Diss, Haverhill, Ipswich, Mildenhall, Newmarket, Stowmarket, Sudbury and Thetford and many of the villages in between. Daily National Express coach services between Victoria Coach Station in London and Bury stop at the town&#x27;s bus and coach station, as does the cross-country service between Clacton-on-Sea and Liverpool which travels via Cambridge, Peterborough, Leicester, Nottingham, Sheffield and Manchester.

<doc id="208825" wikidata="Q834456" url="?curid=208825" title="2002–2004 SARS outbreak">
<text>The 2002–2004 outbreak of SARS, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-1), infected over 8,000 people from 30 countries and territories, and resulted in at least 774 deaths worldwide.

The outbreak was first identified in Foshan, Guangdong, China, in November 2002. The World Health Organization (WHO) was notified of the outbreak in February 2003, and issued a global alert in March 2003. Initially, the cause of the outbreak was unknown, and some media outlets reported that an influenza virus was a potential culprit. The major part of the outbreak lasted about 8 months, and the World Health Organization declared SARS contained on 5 July 2003. However, several SARS cases were reported until May 2004.

In late December 2019, SARS-CoV-2, a coronavirus in the same genus as the one that caused SARS, was discovered in Wuhan, Hubei, China. This strain causes COVID-19, which spread to other areas of Asia, and then worldwide in early 2020, marking the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.

==Outbreak by country and territory==

==Timeline==
===November 2002===
On 16 November 2002, an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) began in China&#x27;s Guangdong province, bordering Hong Kong. The first case of infection was traced to Foshan. This first outbreak affected people in the food industry, such as farmers, market vendors, and chefs. The outbreak spread to healthcare workers after people sought medical treatment for the disease. The People&#x27;s Republic of China notified the World Health Organization (WHO) about this outbreak on 11 February 2003, reporting 305 cases including 105 health-care workers and five deaths. Later it reported that the outbreak in Guangdong had peaked in mid-February 2003. However, this appears to have been false because subsequently 806 cases of infection and 34 deaths were reported. Italian physician Carlo Urbani was the first to identify SARS as probably a new and dangerously contagious viral disease.

Early in the epidemic, the Chinese government discouraged its press from reporting on SARS, delayed reporting to WHO, and initially did not provide information to Chinese outside Guangdong province, where the disease is believed to have originated. Also, a WHO team that travelled to Beijing was not allowed to visit Guangdong province for several weeks. This resulted in international criticism, which seems to have led to a change in government policy in early April.

===January 2003===
A fishmonger, named Zhou Zuofen, checked in to the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital in Guangzhou on 31 January, where he infected 30 nurses and doctors. The virus soon spread to nearby hospitals.

===February 2003===
====Hong Kong====

In February 2003, Liu Jianlun became Hong Kong&#x27;s SARS index patient. He had come to attend a family wedding gathering; Liu was on the staff at Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital in Guangzhou and had treated SARS patients.

On 21 February, Liu and his wife checked into room 911 on the ninth floor of the Metropole Hotel. Despite feeling ill he visited with his family and they traveled around Hong Kong. By the morning of 22 February, he knew he was very sick and walked to the Accident and Emergency Department of Kwong Wah Hospital to seek treatment. He was treated by the triage nurse and doctor without protective measures even though a memorandum on surveillance of severe community-acquired pneumonia had been issued by the Hospital Authority of Hong Kong. After Liu&#x27;s chest X-ray taken in Kwong Wah Hospital became available, staff became aware of the situation, wearing personal protective equipment and full isolation inside the ICU. He had not recovered and died on 4 March.

Liu is believed to have been a SARS super-spreader: 23 other Metropole guests developed SARS, including seven from the ninth floor. Liu&#x27;s brother-in-law, who sought treatment in late February, was hospitalized in Kwong Wah Hospital on 1 March and died on 19 March. It is estimated that around 80% of the Hong Kong cases were due to Liu.

====Vietnam====
The virus was carried to Hanoi, Vietnam, by Chinese-American Johnny Chen, a resident of Shanghai who had roomed across the hall from Liu at the Metropole. He was admitted to the French Hospital of Hanoi on 26 February, where he infected at least 38 members of the staff. Even though he was evacuated to Hong Kong, he died on 13 March. Carlo Urbani, a World Health Organization (WHO) infectious disease specialist, was among the staff who examined Chen. Urbani observed that other hospital staff were already falling ill and realized that he was dealing with a new and dangerous disease. He himself became infected and died on 29 March.

====Canada====

On 23 February, an elderly woman named Kwan Sui-Chu who had also been a Metropole Hotel guest, returned to Toronto, Canada, from Hong Kong. She died at home on 5 March, after infecting her son Tse Chi Kwai, who subsequently spread the disease to Scarborough Grace Hospital and died on 13 March.

===March 2003===
====Singapore====
On 1 March, 26-year-old Esther Mok, another Metropole guest, was admitted to Tan Tock Seng Hospital after visiting Hong Kong, starting the outbreak in Singapore. Although she recovered, various family members did not.

====Taiwan====
The first cases of atypical pneumonia in Taiwan were identified in a Guangdong-based businessman and his wife on 14 March and confirmed on 17 March. He had returned to Taiwan via Hong Kong on 23 February and reported a fever two days later. His wife became ill after caring for him, and both were admitted to National Taiwan University Hospital. Taiwan&#x27;s third case of the disease was identified in a Yilan hospital on 15 March. Like the first case, the third case appeared in someone who had traveled to Guangdong and transited through Hong Kong before arriving in Taiwan. Shortly after the third case was diagnosed, officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States traveled to Taiwan to study the disease. The fourth case, in another traveler to Guangdong, was identified in Chiayi on 18 March, after he sought treatment at a hospital the previous day. By 22 March, six cases in Taiwan had matched the World Health Organization definition of probable.

====Hong Kong====

On 4 March, a 27-year-old man, who had visited a guest on the Metropole&#x27;s 9th floor 11 days earlier, was admitted to Hong Kong&#x27;s Prince of Wales Hospital. At least 99 hospital workers (including 17 medical students) were infected while treating him.

On 11 March, Carlo Urbani travelled to Bangkok, Thailand, to attend a medical conference. He fell ill during the flight and told a friend waiting at Bangkok not to touch him, to call an ambulance and take him to a hospital. He was isolated in an intensive care unit. A similar outbreak of a mysterious respiratory infection was reported among Hong Kong healthcare workers.

On 12 March, WHO issued a global alert about a new infectious disease of unknown origin in both Vietnam and Hong Kong. On 15 March, WHO issued a heightened global health alert about a mysterious pneumonia with a case definition of SARS after cases in Singapore and Canada were also identified. The alert included a rare emergency travel advisory to international travelers, healthcare professionals, and health authorities. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) issued a travel advisory stating that persons considering travel to the affected areas in Asia (Hong Kong, Singapore, Vietnam, and China) should not go.

On 17 March, an international network of 11 laboratories was established to determine the cause of SARS and develop potential treatments.

On 25 March, Hong Kong authorities stated that nine tourists had contracted the disease from a mainland Chinese man who had boarded the same plane on 15 March, Air China Flight 112 to Beijing.

On 27 March, Arthur K. C. Li, head of the Hong Kong Education and Manpower Bureau, announced cancellation of all classes in educational institutions. The Ministry of Education in Singapore announced that all primary schools, secondary schools, and junior colleges were to be shut until 6 April 2003. Polytechnics and universities were not affected. On 29 March, Urbani died in Bangkok.

On 30 March, Hong Kong authorities quarantined estate E of the Amoy Gardens housing estate due to a massive (200+ cases) outbreak in the building. The balcony was completely closed and guarded by the police. The residents of the building were later transferred to the quarantined Lei Yue Mun Holiday Camp and Lady MacLehose Holiday Village on 1 April because the building was deemed a health hazard.

Most of the cases were linked to apartments with a north-western orientation which shared the same sewage pipe. According to government officials, the virus was brought into the estate by an infected kidney patient (the type of kidney illness was not specified) after discharge from Prince of Wales Hospital, who visited his elder brother living on the seventh floor. Through excretion, the virus spread through drainage. One theory speculated that the virus was spread by airborne transmission, through dried up U-shaped P-traps in the drainage system which a maritime breeze blew into the estate&#x27;s balconies and stairwell ventilation. It was confirmed that the virus spread via droplets, but this later outbreak made officials question the possibility that the virus could be spread through the air.

===April 2003===
On 1 April, the U.S. government called back non-essential personnel in their consulate office in Hong Kong and Guangzhou. The US government also advised US citizens not to travel to the region.

On 2 April, Chinese medical officials began reporting the status of the SARS outbreak. China&#x27;s southern Guangdong province reported 361 new infections and 9 new deaths, increasing the total Mainland China figures previously reported at end-February. The virus was also detected in Beijing and Shanghai. The WHO also advised travellers to avoid Hong Kong and Guangdong during a press briefing.

On 3 April, a WHO team of international scientists landed in Guangzhou from Beijing to discuss with officials, but the team was yet to inspect any suspected origin or any medical facilities on the progress of infection control. Fifteen of the quarantined Amoy Gardens residents at Lei Yue Mun Holiday Camp were relocated to the Sai Kung Outdoor Recreation Centre after an overnight protest on washroom sharing. The first medical worker infected with SARS died in Hong Kong. The doctor&#x27;s daughter and infected wife survived his illness, although the wife was also among the quarantined medical workers under intensive care. Hong Kong school closures were extended by two weeks to 21 April.

On 4 April, the WHO team inspected the first infection case in Foshan County. The person infected four people but did not infect his family. A 40-year-old woman became the first local case in Shanghai. A Chinese health specialist admitted at a press conference to not informing the public early enough about the outbreak. The PRC Health Minister also claimed that the disease has been under control in most parts of mainland China. He also released the names of seven drugs which he claimed to be effective in curing SARS. WHO officials said that the information provided by the PRC about the disease has been &quot;very detailed&quot;. US government enforced compulsory quarantine of an infected person.

On 5 April, the Singapore government announced that school closures would be extended. Junior colleges were to reopen on 9 April, secondary schools would reopen on 14 April and primary schools and pre-schools would reopen on 16 April. On 6 April, a SARS case was found in Manila, a person who had returned from Hong Kong.

On 8 April, SARS was discovered in the Lower Ngau Tau Kok Estate near Amoy Gardens in Kowloon. Hong Kong health officials warned that SARS had spread so far domestically and abroad that it was here to stay. Nevertheless, WHO officials remained cautiously optimistic that the disease could still be contained.

On 9 April, James Earl Salisbury died of SARS at a hospital in Hong Kong. An American Mormon and a teacher at Shenzhen Polytechnic, he had been sick for approximately one month before his death, but he was originally diagnosed with pneumonia. His son Michael &quot;Mickey&quot; Salisbury was with him in China and also contracted the disease, but he survived it. Salisbury&#x27;s death led to more open admissions by the Chinese government about the spread of SARS.

On 10 April, Jim Hughes, the head of infectious disease at the CDC, confirming the warnings of Hong Kong health officials, claimed that he believed that SARS could no longer be eradicated in the Far East. However, he remained hopeful that it could be prevented from spreading widely in North America. On 11 April, the World Health Organization issued a global health alert for SARS as it became clear the disease was being spread by global air travel.

On 12 April, Marco Marra, director of the Michael Smith Genome Sciences Centre, which is part of the British Columbia Cancer Agency, announced that scientists at his centre had broken the genetic code of the virus suspected of causing the disease. In Toronto, three more people died of SARS, bringing the Canadian death toll to 13. On 16 April, the WHO issued a press release stating that the coronavirus identified by a number of laboratories was the official cause of SARS. The virus was officially named the SARS virus.

On 17 April, the first confirmed case of SARS from India was reported. On 19 April, Premier of the People&#x27;s Republic of China Wen Jiabao announced that there would be severe consequences for local officials who did not report SARS cases in a timely and accurate manner, signaling a major change in policy. SARS had also been gaining prominence in the mainland Chinese media; by late April, it had jumped from virtual invisibility onto the front page, with daily reports from all provinces on new cases and measures.

On 20 April, Beijing&#x27;s mayor Meng Xuenong and the health minister of the PRC Zhang Wenkang were replaced respectively by Wang Qishan from Hainan and the former deputy health minister Gao Qiang. They were the first two high-rank officials in the PRC to be dismissed because of the fallout of the epidemic. In the news conference chaired by Gao Qiang several hours earlier, the PRC admitted that in Beijing there were more than 300 cases, as opposed to the previous figure of only 37. The figure had increased to 407 the following day. Chinese officials also admitted to major underreporting of cases, which were attributed to bureaucratic ineptitude.

On 22 April, schools in Hong Kong started to reopen in stages. On 23 April, Beijing announced that all primary and secondary schools would be closed for two weeks. A few days before, some colleges in Peking University had been closed because some students had been infected. The WHO issued travel advisories against Beijing, Toronto, and Shanxi.

After several cases of SARS were diagnosed in Taiwan throughout the month of April, including a cluster at Taipei Municipal Hospital&#x27;s Hoping branch, the Taipei City Government closed that hospital and quarantined its 930 staff and 240 patients for two weeks. The decision to lock down the medical facility was protested by hospital staff.

On 24 April, the Hong Kong Government announced an HK$11.8 billion relief package designed to assist Hong Kong&#x27;s battered tourism, entertainment, retail, and catering sectors, consisting of a waiver of tourism- and transport-related license fees, and HK$1 billion allocated for tourism promotion overseas. The package also includes a salaries tax rebate and reduced rates.

On 26 April, Wu Yi was named Zhang Wenkang&#x27;s replacement as PRC health minister. On 26–27 April, Chinese authorities locked down Beijing, closing down theatres, discos, and other entertainment venues in Beijing as the death toll in Beijing continued to rise, threatening to become the worst-hit area of the country, eclipsing the province of Guangdong. People who may have been exposed were ordered to stay home. Authorities were bolstered by the fact that the infection rate seemed to have declined, with Guangdong only exporting three new infections over the weekend. The economic impact was becoming dramatic as shops, restaurants, markets, bars, universities, schools, and many other businesses had closed, while some government ministries and large state banks were working with minimal staff levels.

On 28 April, WHO declared the outbreak in Vietnam to be over as no new cases were reported for 20 days. On 29 April, leaders of member countries of ASEAN and the PRC premier held an emergency summit in Bangkok, Thailand to address the outbreak. Among the decisions made were the setting-up of a ministerial-level task force and uniform pre-departure health screening in airports.

On 30 April, the World Health Organization lifted the SARS travel warning for Toronto. The decision was made because &quot;it is satisfied with local measures to stop the spread of SARS&quot;. Canadian officials said they would step up screenings at airports.

===May 2003===
On 3 May, the 2003 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup was abruptly moved to the United States due to the outbreak. China maintained its automatic qualification and later hosted the Women&#x27;s World Cup four years later. On 4 May, the newly infected number of people in Hong Kong dropped to single digits. On 19 May, the WHO Annual Meeting was held in Geneva. Hong Kong pushed for the Tourism Warning to be lifted.

On 20 May, the WHO refused to lift the Tourism Warning for Hong Kong and Guangdong, but did so three days later after a recount of the number of SARS patients. On 24 May, the number of newly infected patients reached zero for in Hong Kong, the first time since the outbreak in the territory in March.

On 24 May, a new cluster of about 20 suspected patients was reported in Toronto. By 29 May, more than 7,000 people were instructed to quarantine themselves in Canada by authorities seeking to control the potential spread of the SARS outbreak.

In Taiwan, administrators and staff of Taipei Municipal Hospital&#x27;s Hoping branch faced disciplinary action from the Taipei City Government. The Control Yuan also launched an investigation into the hospital&#x27;s closure. Taipei City Bureau of Health director Chiu Shu-ti resigned from Ma Ying-jeou&#x27;s mayoral administration on 25 May. On 27 May, the Taichung City Government, led by mayor Jason Hu, established a command center in central Taiwan to handle SARS. The Department of Health worked with several hospitals in Taiwan to expand medical facilities and treatment for SARS patients.

On 31 May, Singapore was removed from WHO&#x27;s list of &#x27;Infected Areas&#x27;.

===June 2003===
On 10 June, the government of Ontario created the SARS Commission inquiry in order to &quot;investigate the recent introduction and spread of SARS&quot; in the province.

On 23 June, Hong Kong was removed from WHO&#x27;s list of &#x27;Affected Areas&#x27;, while Toronto, Beijing, and Taiwan remained. On 27 June, the World Health Organization stated that the world population should be SARS-free within the next two to three weeks, but warned the disease could emerge in China next winter.

===July 2003===
On 2 July, Canada was removed from the WHO&#x27;s list of &#x27;Infected Areas&#x27;.

On 5 July, WHO declared the SARS outbreak contained and removed Taiwan from the list of affected areas. Taiwan&#x27;s removal from the list signified the end of the outbreak.

===September 2003===
On 8 September, Singapore announced that a post-doctoral worker in a SARS research lab in the National University of Singapore had contracted the disease while working on the West Nile virus but recovered shortly thereafter. It was suspected that the two viruses mixed while he was doing his research.

===December 2003===
On 10 December, a researcher in a SARS lab in Taiwan was found infected with SARS after returning from Singapore attending a medical conference; 74 people in Singapore were quarantined but none of them were infected.

On 27 December, China announced the first suspected case of SARS in six months in Guangdong in an individual who was not a SARS researcher.

===January 2004===
On 5 January, China confirmed that the case reported in December was a case of wild source SARS. The Philippines announced a possible case in a person just returned from Hong Kong. The patient was later determined to have had pneumonia and not SARS. In China, Asian palm civets were culled in markets (the civets were thought to be a reservoir for the disease).

On 10 January, a restaurant worker in Guangdong was confirmed as the second wild source SARS since the outbreak was contained. Guangzhou was also the site of the first case in December and was thought to be the origin of the virus in the original outbreak. Three Hong Kong television reporters who visited SARS-related sites in Guangzhou were declared free of the disease. On 17 January, China announced a third case of SARS in Guangzhou. WHO officials urged more testing to bring the three recently announced cases into line with their standards; however, they also announced SARS virus had been detected by a WHO team in civet cages at the restaurant where the second case worked and in civet cages in the market.

On 31 January, China announced the fourth case of SARS as a 40-year-old doctor from the southern city of Guangzhou, and gave his family name as Liu. He was discharged when the announcement was made.

===April 2004===
SARS broke out again in Beijing and in Anhui Province. On 22 April, China announced that a 53-year-old woman had died on 19 April, its first SARS death since June. One person died and nine were infected in the outbreak which was first reported on 22 April. The first 2 infected cases involved a postgraduate student and a researcher at the National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention (abbrev.: Institute of Virology) of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention; an additional 7 cases were diagnosed, which were linked with close personal contact with the student, the lab or with a nurse who treated the student.

===May 2004===
Two additional confirmed cases of SARS and three additional suspected cases were reported in Beijing on 1 May, all related to a single research lab, the Diarrhea Virus Laboratory in the CDC&#x27;s National Institute of Virology in Beijing. &quot;The cases had been linked to experiments using live and inactive SARS coronavirus in the CDC&#x27;s virology and diarrhea institutes where interdisciplinary research on the SARS virus was conducted.&quot; The total number of cases was six, with four in Beijing and two in Anhui.

On 2 May, China announced the three suspected cases as genuine cases of SARS, bringing the total cases in a recent outbreak to nine. 189 people were released from quarantine. On 18 May, after no new infections had been reported in a three-week period, WHO announced China as free of further cases of SARS, but stated that &quot;biosafety concerns remain&quot;.

==Subsequent status==
In May 2005, Jim Yardley of the &quot;New York Times&quot; wrote: 

== Policy impact ==
In China, the SARS epidemic resulted in substantial public criticism, prompted government statements that privatizing health care in rural China had been a failure, and brought rural reform to the top of the policy agenda.

Following the outbreak, China strengthened its reporting mechanisms for contagious diseases and reduced the reporting time from grassroots healthcare worked to the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention from 15 days to 4 hours.

<text>The Eurovision Song Contest 1999 was the 44th edition of the Eurovision Song Contest, held on 29 May 1999 at the International Convention Centre in Jerusalem, Israel. Organised by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) and host broadcaster Israel Broadcasting Authority (IBA), the contest was held in the country following its victory at the with the song &quot;Diva&quot; by Dana International, and was presented by Dafna Dekel, Yigal Ravid, and Sigal Shachmon.

It was the first contest since that countries were allowed to perform in the language of their choice, and not necessarily the language of their country. It was also the first ever contest not to feature an orchestra or live music accompanying the competing entries.

== Location ==

The 1999 contest took place in Jerusalem, Israel, following the country&#x27;s victory at the with the song &quot;Diva&quot;, performed by Dana International. It was the second time that the contest was staged in Israel, following the also held in Jerusalem. The selected venue was the Ussishkin Auditorium of the International Convention Centre, commonly known in Hebrew as (), which also served as the host venue for the 1979 contest.

The prospect of the contest being staged in Israel resulted in protest by members of the Orthodox Jewish community in the country, including opposition by the deputy mayor of Jerusalem Haim Miller to the contest being staged in the city. Additional concerns over funding for the event also contributed to speculation that the contest could be moved to Malta or the United Kingdom, the countries which had finished in the top three alongside Israel the previous year. Financial guarantees by the Israeli government however helped to ensure that the contest would take place in Israel. The possibility of holding the event in an open air venue was discussed, however concerns over security led to the choice of an indoor venue for the event. A tight security presence was felt during the rehearsal week as a precaution against potential disruption from Palestinian militant groups.

==Participating countries==
Per the rules of the contest, twenty-three countries were allowed to participate in the event, a reduction from the twenty-five which took part in the and 1998 contests. made its first appearance since , and , , , and returned after being relegated from the previous year&#x27;s event. was unable to return from relegation due to failing to broadcast the 1998 contest, as specified in the rules for that edition. 1998 participants , , , , , , and were absent from this edition.

Several of the performers taking part in the contest had previously competed as lead artists in past editions. Two artists returned as lead artists in this year&#x27;s event: Doris Dragović representing had represented ; and Darja Švajger representing had represented her country . A number of former competitors also returned to perform as backing vocalists for some of the competing entries: Stefán Hilmarsson, who represented and , provided backing vocals for Selma; Kenny Lübcke, who represented , returned to provide backing for Trine Jepsen and Michael Teschl; Christopher Scicluna and Moira Stafrace, who represented , provided backing for Times Three; Gabriel Forss, who represented as a member of the group Blond, was among Charlotte Nilsson&#x27;s backing vocalists; and Linda Williams, who represented the , returned as a backing vocalist for Vanessa Chinitor. Additionally, Evelin Samuel represented in this year&#x27;s contest, having previously served as backing vocalist for the country .


=== Qualification ===
Due to the high number of countries wishing to enter the contest, a relegation system was introduced in in order to reduce the number of countries which could compete in each year&#x27;s contest. Any relegated countries would be able to return the following year, thus allowing all countries the opportunity to compete in at least one in every two editions. The relegation rules introduced for the 1997 contest were again utilised ahead of the 1999 contest, based on each country&#x27;s average points total in previous contests. The twenty-three participants were made up of the previous year&#x27;s winning country and host nation, the seventeen countries other than the host which had obtained the highest average points total over the preceding five contests, and any eligible countries which had not competed in the 1998 contest. In cases where the average was identical between two or more countries, the total number of points scored in the most recent contest determined the final order.

A new addition to the relegation rules specified that for the and future editions, the four countries whose broadcasters were the largest financial contributors to the contest, , , and the would automatically qualify for each year&#x27;s event and be exempt from relegation. This new &quot;Big Four&quot; group of countries was created to ensure the financial viability of the event, and was prompted by a number of poor placements in previous years for some of these countries, which if repeated in 1999 could have resulted in those countries being eliminated.

Finland, Greece, Hungary, Macedonia, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, and Switzerland were therefore excluded from participating in the 1999 contest, to make way for the return of Austria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Denmark, Iceland, and Lithuania, and new debuting country Latvia. However Latvia&#x27;s subsequently withdrew its participation at a late stage, and their place in the contest was subsequently offered to Hungary as the excluded country with the highest average points total. Hungarian broadcaster declined and the offer was then passed to Portugal&#x27;s as the next in line, which accepted.

The calculations used to determine the countries relegated for the 1999 contest are outlined in the table below.

== Production ==

The Eurovision Song Contest 1999 was produced by the Israel Broadcasting Authority (IBA). Amnon Barkai served as executive producer, Aharon Goldfinger-Eldar served as producer, Hagai Mautner served as director, and , Mia Raveh and Ronen Levin served as designers. On behalf of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), the event was overseen by Christine Marchal-Ortiz as scrutineer. Usually able to hold a maximum of 3,000 people, modifications made to the Ussishkin Auditorium reduced the capacity to around 2,000 for the contest, with rows of seats removed from the floor to make room for the stage and from the balcony to allow for the construction of boxes for use by various commentators.

Rehearsals in the venue for the competing acts began on 24 May 1999. Each country had two technical rehearsals in the week approaching the contest: the first rehearsals took place on 24 and 25 May, with each country allowed 40 minutes total on stage followed by a 20 minute press conference; the second rehearsals subsequently took place on 26 and 27 May, with each country allocated 30 minutes on stage. Each country took to the stage in the order in which they would perform, however the Lithuanian delegation was permitted to arrive in Israel one day later than the other delegations due to budget concerns. Subsequently the first day&#x27;s rehearsals began with Belgium as the second country to perform in the contest, with Lithuania being the last country to complete their first rehearsal on the second day; the order of rehearsals was corrected for the second rehearsals, with Lithuania scheduled as the first delegation on stage. Additional rehearsals took place on 26 May for the contest&#x27;s concluding performance with all artists, and on 27 May for the contest&#x27;s presenters and to test the voting scoreboard&#x27;s computer graphics. Two dress rehearsals held on 28 May were held with an audience, the second of which was also recorded as a production stand-by in case of problems during the live contest. A further dress rehearsal took place on the afternoon of 29 May ahead of the live contest, followed by security and technical checks.

The singer Dafna Dekel, the radio and television presenter Yigal Ravid and the model and television presenter Sigal Shachmon were the presenters of the 1999 contest, the first edition to feature three presenters in a single show. Dekel had previously represented and placed sixth with the song &quot;&quot;. The writers of the winning song were awarded with a trophy designed by Yaacov Agam, which was presented by the previous year&#x27;s winning artist Dana International.

A compilation album featuring many of the competing entries was released in Israel following the contest, commissioned by IBA and released through the Israeli record label IMP Records. The release contained nineteen of the twenty-three competing acts on CD and an additional video CD with clips from the televised broadcast and footage from backstage.

== Format ==
=== Entries ===
Each participating broadcaster was represented in the contest by one song, no longer than three minutes in duration. A maximum of six performers were allowed on stage during each country&#x27;s performance, and all performers were required to be at least 16 years old in the year of the contest. Selected entries were not permitted to be released commercially before 1 January 1999, and were then only allowed to be released in the country they represented until after the contest was held. Entries were required to be selected by each country&#x27;s participating broadcaster by 15 March, and the final submission date for all selected entries to be received by the contest organisers was set for 29 March. This submission was required to include a sound recording of the entry and backing track for use during the contest, a video presentation of the song on stage being performed by the artists, and the text of the song lyrics in its original language and translations in French and English for distribution to the participating broadcasters, their commentators and juries.

For the first time since the the participants had full freedom to perform in any language, and not simply that of the country they represented. This led to a marked increase in the number of entries which were performed in English. Additionally, the rules were modified to make the orchestra a non-obligatory feature of the contest of which organising broadcasters were free to opt out. IBA chose not to provide an orchestra, with all entries subsequently being performed with backing tracks, and no orchestra has been included as part of the competition since.

Following the confirmation of the twenty-three competing countries, the draw to determine the running order was held on 17 November 1998.

=== Voting procedure ===

The results of the 1999 contest were determined using the scoring system introduced in : each country awarded twelve points to its favourite entry, followed by ten points to its second favourite, and then awarded points in decreasing value from eight to one for the remaining songs which featured in the country&#x27;s top ten, with countries unable to vote for their own entry. Each participating broadcaster was required to use televoting to determine their points, with viewers able to register their vote by telephone for a total of five minutes following the performance of the last competing entry. Viewers could vote by calling one of twenty-two different telephone numbers to represent the twenty-three competing entries except that which represented their own country. Once phone lines were opened a video recap containing short clips of each competing entry with the accompanying phone number for voting was shown in order to aid viewers during the voting window. Systems were also put in place to prevent lobby groups from one country voting for their entry by travelling to other countries.

Participating broadcasters which were unable to hold a televote in its country due to technological limitations were granted an exception, and their points were determined by an assembled jury of eight individuals, which was required to be split evenly between members of the public and music professionals, comprised additionally of an equal number of men and women, and below and above 30 years of age. Participating broadcasters using televoting were also required to appoint a back-up jury of the same composition which would be called into action upon technical failure preventing the televote results from being used. Each jury member voted in secret and awarded between one and ten votes to each participating song, excluding that from their own country and with no abstentions permitted. The votes of each member were collected following the country&#x27;s performance and then tallied by the non-voting jury chairperson to determine the points to be awarded. In any cases where two or more songs in the top ten received the same number of votes, a show of hands by all jury members was used to determine the final placing; if a tie still remained, the youngest jury member would have the deciding vote.

=== Postcards ===
Each entry was preceded by a video postcard which served as an introduction to each country, as well as providing an opportunity to showcase the running artistic theme of the event and to create a transition between entries to allow stage crew to make changes on stage. The postcards for the 1999 contest featured animations of paintings of biblical stories which transitioned into footage of modern locations in Israel or clips representing specific themes related to contemporary Israeli culture and industries. The various locations or themes for each postcard are listed below by order of performance:
# Jacob&#x27;s Ladder; Israel Museum, Jerusalem

== Contest overview ==
The contest took place on 29 May 1999 at 22:00 (IST) and lasted 3 hours and 13 minutes.

The show began with a computer animation entitled &quot;From Birmingham to Jerusalem&quot;, highlighting the contest&#x27;s journey from last year&#x27;s host country the United Kingdom to Israel, and containing notable landmarks and features of the competing countries; the animation then transitioned into recorded footage of Jerusalem including dancers and hosts Dekel and Shachmon. The contest&#x27;s opening segment also featured Izhar Cohen and Gali Atari, previous Eurovision winning artists for and attending as special guests, and the previous year&#x27;s co-presenter Terry Wogan in attendance as the United Kingdom&#x27;s television commentator. A pause between entries was included for the first time to allow broadcasters to provide advertisements during the show; placed between the Polish and Icelandic entries, a performance of the song &quot;To Life&quot; from the musical &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot; featuring co-presenters Dekel and Shachmon was provided for the benefit of the audience in the arena and for non-commercial broadcasters.

The contest&#x27;s pre-recorded interval act entitled &quot;Freedom Calls&quot;, shown following the final competing entry and during the voting window, was staged outside the Walls of Jerusalem and the Tower of David and featured performances by a troupe of dancers, a chorus and Dana International singing the D&#x27;ror Yikra and a cover of &quot;Free&quot;, originally recorded by Stevie Wonder. Following the traditional reprise performance of the winning song, the show finished with a performance of the English version of Israel&#x27;s 1979 contest winning song &quot;Hallelujah&quot;, which included all the competing artists and was featured as a tribute to the victims of the then-ongoing Kosovo War and to the people of the Balkans impacted.

The winner was represented by the song &quot;Take Me to Your Heaven&quot;, composed by Lars Diedricson, written by and and performed by Charlotte Nilsson. This marked Sweden&#x27;s fourth victory in the contest, following wins in , , and , and occurred 25 years after ABBA brought Sweden its first victory. Iceland, Croatia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina also achieved their best results to date, placing second, fourth and seventh respectively.

During the presentation of the trophy to the contest winners, Dana International caused a security alert in the auditorium as while lifting the trophy she lost her balance and fell to the stage along with the winning songwriters before being helped up by security agents.

The Norwegian delegation raised an objection to the use of simulated male vocals during the performance of Croatian entry &quot;Marija Magdalena&quot;. Following the contest this was found to have contravened the contest rules regarding the use of vocals on the backing tracks, and Croatia were sanctioned by the EBU with the loss of 33% of their points for the purpose of calculating their average points total for qualification in following contests. The country&#x27;s position and points at this contest however remain unchanged.

The table below outlines the participating countries, the order in which they performed, the competing artists and songs, and the results of the voting.

== Detailed voting results ==

Televoting was used to determine the points awarded by all countries, except Lithuania, Turkey, Ireland, and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Ireland had intended to use televoting, however technical failures at Telecom Éireann ahead of the voting window meant that the majority of calls were not registered and the country&#x27;s back-up jury was utilised to determine its points.

The announcement of the results from each country was conducted in the order in which they performed, with the spokespersons announcing their country&#x27;s points in English or French in ascending order. The detailed breakdown of the points awarded by each country is listed in the tables below.

=== 12 points ===
The below table summarises how the maximum 12 points were awarded from one country to another. The winning country is shown in bold. Germany and Sweden each received the maximum score of 12 points from five countries, with Iceland receiving three sets of 12 points, Croatia and Slovenia receiving two sets each, and Bosnia and Herzegovina, Denmark, Ireland, Netherlands, Portugal, and Turkey each receiving one maximum score.

== Broadcasts ==

Each participating broadcaster was required to relay live and in full the contest via television. Non-participating EBU member broadcasters were also able to relay the contest as &quot;passive participants&quot;; any passive countries wishing to participate in the following year&#x27;s event were also required to provide a live broadcast of the contest or a deferred broadcast within 24 hours. Broadcasters were able to send commentators to provide coverage of the contest in their own native language and to relay information about the artists and songs to their television viewers. These commentators were typically sent to the venue to report on the event, and were able to provide commentary from small booths constructed at the back of the venue.

The contest was reportedly watched by 150 million viewers. Known details on the broadcasts in each country, including the specific broadcasting stations and commentators, are shown in the tables below.



==Other awards==
===Barbara Dex Award===
The Barbara Dex Award, created in 1997 by fansite House of Eurovision, was awarded to the performer deemed to have been the &quot;worst dressed&quot; among the participants. The winner in 1999 was Spain&#x27;s representative Lydia, as determined by visitors to the House of Eurovision website. This was the first edition of the award to be determined by site visitors, as the winners in 1997 and 1998 had been chosen by the founders of the House of Eurovision site Edwin van Thillo and Rob Paardekam.

<text>Weird Tales is an American fantasy and horror fiction pulp magazine founded by J. C. Henneberger and J. M. Lansinger in late 1922. The first issue, dated March 1923, appeared on newsstands February 18. The first editor, Edwin Baird, printed early work by H. P. Lovecraft, Seabury Quinn, and Clark Ashton Smith, all of whom went on to be popular writers, but within a year, the magazine was in financial trouble. Henneberger sold his interest in the publisher, Rural Publishing Corporation, to Lansinger, and refinanced &quot;Weird Tales&quot;, with Farnsworth Wright as the new editor. The first issue to list Wright as editor was dated November 1924. The magazine was more successful under Wright, and despite occasional financial setbacks, it prospered over the next 15 years. Under Wright&#x27;s control, the magazine lived up to its subtitle, &quot;The Unique Magazine&quot;, and published a wide range of unusual fiction.

Lovecraft&#x27;s Cthulhu mythos stories first appeared in &quot;Weird Tales&quot;, starting with &quot;The Call of Cthulhu&quot; in 1928. These were well-received, and a group of writers associated with Lovecraft wrote other stories set in the same milieu. Robert E. Howard was a regular contributor, and published several of his Conan the Barbarian stories in the magazine, and Seabury Quinn&#x27;s series of stories about Jules de Grandin, a detective who specialized in cases involving the supernatural, was very popular with the readers. Other well-liked authors included Nictzin Dyalhis, E. Hoffmann Price, Robert Bloch, and H. Warner Munn. Wright published some science fiction, along with the fantasy and horror, partly because when &quot;Weird Tales&quot; was launched, no magazines were specializing in science fiction, but he continued this policy even after the launch of magazines such as &quot;Amazing Stories&quot; in 1926. Edmond Hamilton wrote a good deal of science fiction for &quot;Weird Tales&quot;, though after a few years, he used the magazine for his more fantastic stories, and submitted his space operas elsewhere.

In 1938, the magazine was sold to William Delaney, the publisher of &quot;Short Stories&quot;, and within two years, Wright, who was ill, was replaced by Dorothy McIlwraith as editor. Although some successful new authors and artists, such as Ray Bradbury and Hannes Bok, continued to appear, the magazine is considered by critics to have declined under McIlwraith from its heyday in the 1930s. &quot;Weird Tales&quot; ceased publication in 1954, but since then, numerous attempts have been made to relaunch the magazine, starting in 1973. The longest-lasting version began in 1988 and ran with an occasional hiatus for over 20 years under an assortment of publishers. In the mid-1990s, the title was changed to &quot;Worlds of Fantasy and Horror&quot; because of licensing issues, the original title returning in 1998.

The magazine is regarded by historians of fantasy and science fiction as a legend in the field, Robert Weinberg considering it &quot;the most important and influential of all fantasy magazines&quot;. Weinberg&#x27;s fellow historian, Mike Ashley, describes it as &quot;second only to &quot;Unknown&quot; in significance and influence&quot;, adding that &quot;somewhere in the imagination reservoir of all U.S. (and many non-U.S.) genre-fantasy and horror writers is part of the spirit of &quot;Weird Tales&quot;&quot;.

==Background==

In the late 19th century, popular magazines typically did not print fiction to the exclusion of other content; they would include nonfiction articles and poetry, as well. In October 1896, Frank A. Munsey Company&#x27;s &quot;Argosy&quot; magazine was the first to switch to printing only fiction, and in December of that year, it changed to using cheap wood-pulp paper. This is now regarded by magazine historians as having been the start of the pulp magazine era. For years, pulp magazines were successful without restricting their fiction content to any specific genre, but in 1906, Munsey launched &quot;Railroad Man&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, the first title that focused on a particular niche. Other titles that specialized in particular fiction genres followed, starting in 1915 with &quot;Detective Story Magazine,&quot; with &quot;Western Story Magazine&quot; following in 1919. Weird fiction, science fiction, and fantasy all appeared frequently in the pulps of the day, but by the early 1920s, still no single magazine was focused on any of these genres, though &quot;The Thrill Book&quot;, launched in 1919 by Street &amp; Smith with the intention of printing &quot;different&quot;, or unusual, stories, was a near miss.

In 1922, J. C. Henneberger, the publisher of &quot;College Humor&quot; and &quot;The Magazine of Fun&quot;, formed Rural Publishing Corporation of Chicago, in partnership with his former fraternity brother, J. M. Lansinger. Their first venture was &quot;Detective Tales&quot;, a pulp magazine that appeared twice a month, starting with the October 1, 1922 issue. It was initially unsuccessful, and as part of a refinancing plan, Henneberger decided to publish another magazine that would allow him to split some of his costs between the two titles. Henneberger had long been an admirer of Edgar Allan Poe, so he created a fiction magazine that would focus on horror, and titled it &quot;Weird Tales&quot;.

==Publication history==

===Rural Publishing Corporation===
Henneberger chose Edwin Baird, the editor of &quot;Detective Tales&quot;, to edit &quot;Weird Tales&quot;; Farnsworth Wright was first reader, and Otis Adelbert Kline also worked on the magazine, assisting Baird. Payment rates were low, usually between a quarter and a half cent per word; the budget went up to one cent per word for the most popular writers. Sales were initially poor, and Henneberger soon decided to change the format from the standard pulp size to large pulp, to make the magazine more visible. This had little long-term effect on sales, though the first issue at the new size, dated May 1923, was the only one that first year to sell out completely—probably because it contained the first instalment of a popular serial, &quot;The Moon Terror&quot;, by A.G. Birch.

Even before the launch, Rural had incurred higher than expected costs from the printer for the first few issues of &quot;Detective Tales&quot;. After the first issue of &quot;Weird Tales&quot;, Rural switched to a cheaper printer, but it meant that the magazine began at a financial disadvantage. The magazine lost a considerable amount of money under Baird&#x27;s editorship: after thirteen issues, the total debt was over $40,000 and perhaps as much as $60,000. In the meantime, &quot;Detective Tales&quot; had been retitled &quot;Real Detective Tales&quot; and was making a profit, as was &quot;College Humor&quot;. Henneberger decided early in 1924 on a reorganization of the editorial staff, which meant that by late spring Baird was no longer actively editing &quot;Weird Tales&quot;, though for a while he remained on the staff. A financial reorganization was also necessary, and Henneberger decided to sell both magazines to Lansinger and invest the money in &quot;Weird Tales&quot;. This did not address the debt, $43,000 of which was owed to the magazine&#x27;s printer, Cornelius Printing Company. Cornelius agreed to an arrangement in which they would control a new company, to be called Popular Fiction Publishing, until the debt was paid off. Not all of the magazine&#x27;s debts were eliminated by this transaction, but it meant that &quot;Weird Tales&quot; could continue to publish, and perhaps return to profitability. The business manager of the new company was William (Bill) Sprenger, who had been working for Rural Publishing. Henneberger had hopes of eventually refinancing the debt with the help of another printer, Hall Printing Company, owned by Robert Eastman, though it is not known when Eastman and Henneberger discussed the possibility.

Baird stayed with Lansinger, so Henneberger wrote to H. P. Lovecraft, who had sold some stories to &quot;Weird Tales&quot;, to see if he would be interested in taking the job. Henneberger offered ten weeks advance pay, but made it a condition that Lovecraft move to Chicago, where the magazine was headquartered. Lovecraft described Henneberger&#x27;s plans in a letter to Frank Belknap Long as &quot;a brand-new magazine to cover the field of Poe-Machen shudders&quot;. Lovecraft did not wish to leave New York, where he had recently moved with his new bride; his dislike of cold weather was another deterrent. He spent several months considering the offer in mid-1924 without making a final decision; Henneberger visited him in Brooklyn more than once, but eventually either Lovecraft declined or Henneberger simply gave up. Wright briefly severed his connection with &quot;Weird Tales&quot; in mid-1924, but by the end of the year he had been hired as its new editor. The last issue under Baird&#x27;s name was a combined May/June/July issue, with 192 pages—a much thicker magazine than the earlier issues. It was assembled by Wright and Kline, rather than Baird.

===Popular Fiction Publishing===

Henneberger gave Wright full control of &quot;Weird Tales&quot;, and did not get involved with story selection. In about 1921, Wright had begun to suffer from Parkinson&#x27;s disease, and over the course of his editorship the symptoms grew gradually worse. By the end of the 1920s he was unable to sign his name, and by the late 1930s Bill Sprenger was helping him get to work and back home. The first issue with Wright as editor was dated November 1924, and the magazine immediately resumed a regular monthly schedule, the format changing back to pulp again. The pay rate was initially low, with a cap of half a cent per word until 1926, when the top rate was increased to one cent per word. Some of Popular Fiction Publishing&#x27;s debts were paid off over time, and the highest pay rate eventually rose to one and a half cents per word. The magazine&#x27;s cover price was high for the time. Robert Bloch recalled that &quot;in the late Twenties and Thirties of this century...at a time when most pulp periodicals sold for a dime, its price was a quarter&quot;. Although Popular Fiction Publishing continued to be based in Chicago, the editorial offices were in Indianapolis for a while, at two separate addresses, but moved to Chicago toward the end of 1926. After a short period on North Broadway, the office moved to 840 North Michigan Avenue, where it would remain until 1938.

In 1927, Popular Fiction Publishing issued Birch&#x27;s &quot;The Moon Terror&quot;, one of &quot;Weird Tales&quot;″ more popular serials, as a hardcover book, including three other stories from the magazine&#x27;s first year. One of the stories, &quot;An Adventure in the Fourth Dimension&quot;, was by Wright himself. The book sold poorly, and it remained on offer in the pages of &quot;Weird Tales&quot;, at reduced prices, for twenty years. It was at one point provided as a bonus to readers who subscribed. In 1930 Cornelius launched a companion magazine, &quot;Oriental Stories&quot;, but the magazine was not a success, though it managed to last for over three years before Cornelius gave up. Another financial blow occurred in late 1930 when a bank failure froze most of the magazine&#x27;s cash. Henneberger changed the schedule to bimonthly, starting with the February/March 1931 issue; six months later, with the August 1931 issue, the monthly schedule returned. Two years later &quot;Weird Tales&quot;&#x27; bank was still having financial problems, and payment to authors was being substantially delayed.

The Depression also hit the Hall Printing Company, which Henneberger had been hoping would take over the debt from Cornelius; Robert Eastman, the owner of Hall, at one point was unable to meet payroll. Eastman died in 1932, and with him went Henneberger&#x27;s plans for recovering control of &quot;Weird Tales&quot;. The magazine advertised in the early science fiction pulps, usually highlighting one of the more science-fictional stories. Often the advertised story was by Edmond Hamilton, who was popular in the sf magazines. Wright also sold hardcovers of books by some of his more popular authors, such as Kline, in the pages of &quot;Weird Tales&quot;. Although the magazine was never greatly profitable, Wright was paid well. Robert Weinberg, author of a history of &quot;Weird Tales&quot;, records a rumor that Wright was unpaid for much of his work on the magazine, but according to E. Hoffmann Price, a close friend of Wright&#x27;s who occasionally read manuscripts for him, &quot;Weird Tales&quot; was paying Wright about $600 a month in 1927.

=== Delaney ===

In 1938 Popular Fiction Publishing was sold to William J. Delaney, who was the publisher of &quot;Short Stories&quot;, a successful general fiction pulp magazine based in New York. Sprenger and Wright both received a share of the stock from Cornelius; Sprenger did not remain with the company but Wright moved to New York and stayed on as editor. Henneberger&#x27;s share of Popular Fiction Publishing was converted to a small interest in the new company, Weird Tales, Inc., a subsidiary of Delaney&#x27;s Short Stories, Inc. Dorothy McIlwraith, the editor of &quot;Short Stories,&quot; became Wright&#x27;s assistant, and over the next two years Delaney tried to increase profits by adjusting the page count and price. An increase from 144 pages to 160 pages starting with the February 1939 issue, along with the use of cheaper (and hence thicker) paper, made the magazine thicker, but this failed to increase sales. In September 1939 the page count went down to 128, and the price was cut from 25 cents to 15 cents. From January 1940 the frequency was reduced to bimonthly, a change which stayed in effect until the end of the magazine&#x27;s run fourteen years later. None of these changes had the intended effect, and sales continued to languish. In March 1940, Wright was let go because of his increasing health problems—he was by now suffering from Parkinson&#x27;s so severely that he had trouble walking unassisted. and was replaced by McIlwraith as editor. Wright then had an operation to reduce the pain with which he suffered, but never fully recovered. He died in June of that year.

Wright was replaced by McIlwraith, whose first issue was dated April 1940. From 1945 through 1949, she was assisted by Lamont Buchanan, who worked for her as associate editor and art editor for both &quot;Weird Tales&quot; and &quot;Short Stories&quot;. August Derleth also provided assistance and advice, although he had no formal connection with the magazine. Most of McIlwraith&#x27;s budget went to &quot;Short Stories&quot;, since that was the more successful magazine; the payment rate for fiction in &quot;Weird Tales&quot; by 1953 was one cent per word, well below the top rates of other science fiction and fantasy magazines of the day. War shortages also caused problems, and the page count was reduced, first to 112 pages in 1943, and then to 96 pages the following year.

The price was increased to 20 cents in 1947, and again to 25 cents in 1949, but it was not only &quot;Weird Tales&quot; that was suffering—the entire pulp industry was in decline. Delaney switched the format to digest with the September 1953 issue, but there was to be no reprieve. In 1954, &quot;Weird Tales&quot; and &quot;Short Stories&quot; ceased publication; in both cases the last issue was dated September 1954. For &quot;Weird Tales&quot;, the September 1954 issue was its 279th.

===1970s and early 1980s===

In the mid-1950s, Leo Margulies, a well-known figure in the magazine publishing world, launched a new company, Renown Publications, with plans to publish several titles. He acquired the rights to both &quot;Weird Tales&quot; and &quot;Short Stories&quot;, and hoped to bring both magazines back. He abandoned a plan to restart &quot;Weird Tales&quot; in 1962, using reprints from the original magazine, after being advised by Sam Moskowitz that there was little market for weird and horror fiction at the time. Instead Margulies mined the &quot;Weird Tales&quot; backfile for four anthologies which appeared in the early 1960s: &quot;The Unexpected&quot;, &quot;The Ghoul-Keepers&quot;, &quot;Weird Tales&quot;, and &quot;Worlds of Weird&quot;. The latter two were ghost-edited by Moskowitz, who proposed to Margulies that when the time was right to start the magazine up again, it should include reprints from obscure sources that Moskowitz had found, rather than just stories reprinted from the first incarnation of &quot;Weird Tales&quot;. These stories would be as good as new for most readers, and the money saved could be used for an occasional new story.

The new version of &quot;Weird Tales&quot; finally appeared from Renown Publications, in April 1973, edited by Moskowitz. It had weak distribution and sales were too low for sustainability; according to Moskowitz the average sales were 18,000 copies per issue, well short of the 23,000 that would have been needed for the magazine to survive. The fourth issue, dated Summer 1974, was the last, as Margulies closed down all his magazines except for &quot;Mike Shayne Mystery Magazine&quot;, which was the only one that was making a profit. Mike Ashley, a science fiction magazine historian, records that Moskowitz was unwilling to continue in any case, as he was annoyed by Margulies&#x27;s detailed involvement in the day-to-day editorial tasks such as editing manuscripts and writing introductions.

Margulies died the following year, and his widow, Cylvia Margulies, decided to sell the rights to the title. Forrest Ackerman, a science fiction fan and editor, was one of the interested parties, but she chose instead to sell to Victor Dricks and Robert Weinberg. Weinberg in turn licensed the title to Lin Carter, who interested a publisher, Zebra Books, in the project. The result was a series of four paperback anthologies, edited by Lin Carter, appearing between 1981 and 1983; these were originally planned to be quarterly, but in fact the first two both appeared in December 1980 and were both dated Spring 1981. The next was dated Fall 1981; Carter&#x27;s rights to the title were terminated by Weinberg in 1982 for non-payment, but the fourth issue was already in the works and finally appeared with a date of Summer 1983.

In 1982 Sheldon Jaffery and Roy Torgeson met with Weinberg to propose taking over as licensees, but Weinberg decided not to pursue the offer. The following year, Brian Forbes approached Weinberg with another offer. Forbes&#x27; company, the Bellerophon Network, was an imprint of a Los Angeles company named The Wizard. Ashley reports that Weinberg was only able to contact Forbes by phone, and even that was not always reliable, so negotiations were slow. Forbes&#x27; editorial director was Gordon Garb and the fiction editor was Gil Lamont; Forrest Ackerman also assisted, mainly by obtaining material to include. There was a good deal of confusion between the participants in the project: according to &quot;Locus&quot;, a science fiction trade journal, &quot;Ackerman says he has had no contact with publisher Forbes, does not know what will happen to the material he put together, and is as much in the dark as everybody else. Lamont says that he is still renegotiating his contract and is not sure where he stands&quot;. The original plan was for the first issue to appear in August 1984, dated July/August, but before it appeared the decision was taken to change the contents, and a new, completely reset issue finally appeared at the end of the year, dated Fall 1984. Even with this delay a final agreement had not yet been reached with Weinberg over licensing. Only 12,500 copies were printed; these were sent to two distributors who both went into bankruptcy. As a result, few copies were sold, and Forbes was not paid by the distributors. Despite the financial setback, Forbes attempted to continue, and a second issue eventually appeared. Its cover date was Winter 1985 but it was not published until June 1986. Few copies were printed; reports vary between 1,500 and 2,300 in total. Mark Monsolo was the fiction editor, but Garb continued as editorial director; Lamont was no longer involved with the magazine.

===Terminus and successors===

&quot;Weird Tales&quot; was more lastingly revived at the end of the 1980s by George H. Scithers, John Gregory Betancourt and Darrell Schweitzer, who formed Terminus Publishing, based in Philadelphia, and licensed the rights from Weinberg. Rather than focus on newsstand distribution, which was expensive and had become less effective in the 1980s, they planned to build a base of direct subscribers and distribute the magazine for sale through specialist stores. The first issue had a cover date of Spring 1988, but it was produced early enough to be available at the 1987 World Fantasy Convention in Nashville, Tennessee. The size was the same as the original pulp version, though it was printed on better paper. There were also limited edition hardcover versions of each issue, signed by the contributors. A special World Fantasy Award &quot;Weird Tales&quot; received in 1992 made it apparent that the magazine was successful in terms of quality, but sales were insufficient to cover costs. To save money the format was changed to a larger flat size, starting with the Winter 1992/1993 issue, but the magazine remained in financial trouble, issues becoming irregular over the next couple of years. The Summer 1993 issue was the last to have a hardcover edition; it was also the last, for a while, to bear the name &quot;Weird Tales&quot;, as Weinberg did not renew the license. The magazine was retitled &quot;Worlds of Fantasy &amp; Horror&quot;, and the volume numbering was restarted at volume 1 number 1, but in every other way the magazine was unchanged, and the four issues under this title, issued between 1994 and 1996, are regarded by bibliographers as part of the overall &quot;Weird Tales&quot; run.

In April 1995, HBO announced they had plans to turn &quot;Weird Tales&quot; into a three-episode anthology show similar to their &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot; series. The deal for the rights was facilitated by screenwriters Mark Patrick Carducci and Peter Atkins. Directors Tim Burton, Francis Ford Coppola, and Oliver Stone were executive producers, and each was expected to direct an episode. Stone was to be director of the pilot, but the series never came to fruition.
No issues appeared in 1997, but in 1998 Scithers and Schweitzer negotiated a deal with Warren Lupine of DNA Publications which allowed them to start publishing &quot;Weird Tales&quot; under license once again. The first issue was dated Summer 1998, and, other than the omission of the Winter 1998 issue, a regular quarterly schedule was maintained for the next four and a half years. Sales were weak, never rising above 6,000 copies, and DNA began to experience financial difficulties. Wildside Press, owned by John Betancourt, joined DNA and Terminus Publishing as co-publisher, starting with the July/August 2003 issue, and &quot;Weird Tales&quot; returned to a mostly regular schedule for a few months. A long hiatus ended with the December 2004 issue, which appeared in early 2005; this was the last issue under the arrangement with DNA. Wildside Press then bought &quot;Weird Tales&quot;, and Betancourt again joined Scithers and Schweitzer as co-editor.

The first Wildside Press edition appeared in September 2005, and starting with the following issue, dated February 2006, the magazine was able to stay on a more or less bimonthly schedule for some time. In early 2007, Wildside announced a revamp of &quot;Weird Tales&quot;, naming Stephen H. Segal the editorial and creative director and later recruiting Ann VanderMeer as the new fiction editor. In January 2010, the magazine announced Segal was leaving the top editorial post to become an editor at Quirk Books. VanderMeer was elevated to editor-in-chief, Mary Robinette Kowal joined the staff as art director and Segal became senior contributing editor.

On August 23, 2011, John Betancourt announced that Wildside Press would be selling &quot;Weird Tales&quot; to Marvin Kaye and John Harlacher of Nth Dimension Media. Marvin Kaye took over chief editorial duties. Issue 359, the first under the new publishers, was published in late February 2012. Some months before the release of issue 359, a special World Fantasy Convention preview issue was given away for free to interested attendees. Four issues then appeared, with issue #362 published in Spring of 2014.

On August 14, 2019, the official &quot;Weird Tales&quot; Facebook magazine announced the return of &quot;Weird Tales&quot; with author Jonathan Maberry as the editorial director. Issue #363-367 (2019-2023) became available to purchase at the &quot;Weird Tales&quot; website.

==Contents and reception==
Henneberger gave &quot;Weird Tales&quot; the subtitle &quot;The Unique Magazine&quot; from the first issue. Henneberger had been hoping for submissions of &quot;off-trail&quot;, or unusual, material. He later recalled talking to three well-known Chicago writers, Hamlin Garland, Emerson Hough, and Ben Hecht, each of whom had said they avoided writing stories of &quot;fantasy, the bizarre, and the outré&quot; because of the likelihood of rejection by existing markets. He added &quot;I must confess that the main motive in establishing &quot;Weird Tales&quot; was to give the writer free rein to express his innermost feelings in a manner befitting great literature&quot;, but it is unlikely any of these authors promised to submit anything to Henneberger.

=== Edwin Baird ===

Edwin Baird, the first editor of &quot;Weird Tales&quot;, was not an ideal choice for the job as he disliked horror stories; his expertise was in crime fiction, and most of the material he acquired was bland and unoriginal. The writers Henneberger had been hoping to publish, such as Garland and Hough, failed to submit anything to Baird, and the magazine published mostly traditional ghost fiction, many of the stories being narrated by characters in lunatic asylums, or told in diary format. The cover story for the first issue was &quot;Ooze&quot;, by Anthony M. Rud; there was also the first installment of a serial, &quot;The Thing of A Thousand Shapes&quot;, by Otis Adelbert Kline, and 22 other stories. Ashley suggests that the better pulp writers from whom Baird did manage to acquire material, such as Francis Stevens and Austin Hall, were sending Baird stories which had already been rejected elsewhere.

In the middle of the year Baird received five stories submitted by H. P. Lovecraft; Baird bought all five of them. Lovecraft, who had been persuaded by friends to submit the stories, included a cover letter that was so remarkably negative about the quality of the manuscripts that Baird published it in the September 1923 issue, with a note appended saying that he had bought the stories &quot;despite the foregoing, or because of it&quot;. Baird insisted that the stories be resubmitted as typed double-spaced manuscripts; Lovecraft disliked typing, and initially decided to resubmit only one story, &quot;Dagon&quot;. It appeared in the October 1923 issue, which was the most noteworthy of Baird&#x27;s tenure, since it included stories by three writers who would become frequent contributors to &quot;Weird Tales&quot;: as well as Lovecraft, it marked the first appearance in the magazine of Frank Owen and Seabury Quinn.

Robert Weinberg, in his history of &quot;Weird Tales&quot;, agrees with Ashley that the quality of Baird&#x27;s issues was poor, but comments that some good stories were published: &quot;it was just that the percentage of such stories was dismally small&quot;. Weinberg singles out &quot;A Square of Canvas&quot; by Rud, and &quot;Beyond the Door&quot; by Paul Suter as &quot;exceptional&quot;; both appeared in the April 1923 issue. Weinberg also regards &quot;The Floor Above&quot; by M. L. Humphries and &quot;Penelope&quot; by Vincent Starrett, both from the May 1923 issue, and &quot;Lucifer&quot; by John Swain, from the November 1923 issue, as memorable, and comments that &quot;The Rats in the Walls&quot;, in the March 1924 issue, was one of Lovecraft&#x27;s finest stories. Baird is also credited with discovering and encouraging Lovecraft. It was Henneberger who came up with another idea involving Lovecraft: Henneberger contacted Harry Houdini and made arrangements to have Lovecraft ghost-write a story for him using a plot supplied by Houdini. The story, &quot;Imprisoned with the Pharaohs&quot;, appeared under Houdini&#x27;s name in the May/June/July 1924 issue, though it was nearly lost—Lovecraft left the typed manuscript on the train he took to New York to get married, and as a result spent much of his wedding day retyping the manuscript from the longhand copy he still had.

The May/June/July 1924 issue included another story: &quot;The Loved Dead&quot;, by C. M. Eddy Jr. which included a mention of necrophilia. According to Eddy, this led to the magazine being removed from the newsstands in several cities, and beneficial publicity for the magazine, helping sales, but in his history of &quot;Weird Tales&quot; Robert Weinberg reports that he found no evidence of the magazine being banned, and the financial state of the magazine implies there was no benefit to sales either. S. T. Joshi, Lovecraft&#x27;s biographer, contends that the magazine was indeed removed from newsstands in Indiana, but according to John Locke, a magazine historian, the suggestion that there was ever a public reaction to the story is a misinterpretation of comments made by Lovecraft about the story.

The cover art during Baird&#x27;s tenure was dull; Ashley calls it &quot;unattractive&quot;, and Weinberg describes the color scheme of the first issue&#x27;s cover as &quot;less than inspired&quot;, though he considers the next month&#x27;s cover to be an improvement. He adds that from the May 1923 issue &quot;the covers plunged into a pit of mediocrity&quot;. In Weinberg&#x27;s opinion the poor cover art, frequently by R. M. Mally, was probably partly to blame for the magazine&#x27;s lack of success under Baird. Weinberg also regards the interior art during the magazine&#x27;s first year as very weak; most of the interior drawings were small, and with little of the atmosphere one would expect from a horror magazine. All the illustrations were by Heitman, whom Weinberg describes as &quot;... notable for his complete lack of imagination. Heitman&#x27;s specialty was taking the &quot;one&quot; scene in a frightening story that featured nothing at all frightening or weird and illustrating that&quot;.

=== Farnsworth Wright ===

The new editor, Farnsworth Wright, was much more willing than Baird had been to publish stories that did not fit into any of the existing pulp categories. Ashley describes Wright as &quot;erratic&quot; in his selections, but under his guidance the magazine steadily improved in quality. His first issue, November 1924, was little better than those edited by Baird, although it included two stories by new writers, Frank Belknap Long and Greye La Spina, who became popular contributors. Over the following year, Wright established a group of writers as regulars, including Long and La Spina, and published many stories by writers who would be closely associated with the magazine for the next decade and more. In April 1925, Nictzin Dyalhis&#x27;s first story, &quot;When the Green Star Waned&quot;, appeared; although Weinberg regards it as very dated, it was highly regarded at the time, Wright listing it in 1933 as the most popular story to appear in &quot;Weird Tales&quot;. That issue also contained the first instalment of La Spina&#x27;s novel &quot;Invaders from the Dark&quot;, which Baird had rejected as &quot;too commonplace&quot;. It proved to be extremely popular with readers, and Weinberg comments that Baird&#x27;s rejection was &quot;just one of the many mistakes made by the earlier editor&quot;.

Arthur J. Burks, who would go on to be a very successful pulp writer, appeared under both his real name and under a pseudonym, used for his first sale, in January 1925. Robert Spencer Carr&#x27;s first story appeared in March 1925; H. Warner Munn&#x27;s &quot;The Werewolf of Ponkert&quot; appeared in July 1925, and in the same issue Wright printed &quot;Spear and Fang&quot;, the first professional sale of Robert E. Howard, who would become famous as the creator of Conan the Barbarian. In late 1925 Wright added a &quot;&quot;Weird Tales&quot; reprint&quot; department, which showcased old weird stories, typically horror classics. Often these were translations, and in some cases the appearance in &quot;Weird Tales&quot; was the story&#x27;s first appearance in English.

Wright initially rejected Lovecraft&#x27;s &quot;The Call of Cthulhu&quot;, but eventually bought it, and printed it in the February 1928 issue. This was the first tale of the Cthulhu Mythos, a fictional universe in which Lovecraft set several stories. Over time other writers began to contribute their own stories with the same shared background, including Frank Belknap Long, August Derleth, E. Hoffmann Price, and Donald Wandrei. Robert E. Howard and Clark Ashton Smith were friends of Lovecraft&#x27;s, but did not contribute Cthulhu stories; instead Howard wrote sword and sorcery fiction, and Smith produced a series of high fantasy stories, many of which were part of his Hyperborean cycle. Robert Bloch, later to become well known as the writer of the movie &quot;Psycho&quot;, began publishing stories in &quot;Weird Tales&quot; in 1935; he was a fan of Lovecraft&#x27;s work, and asked Lovecraft&#x27;s permission to include Lovecraft as a character in one of his stories, and to kill the character off. Lovecraft gave him permission, and reciprocated by killing off a thinly disguised version of Bloch in one of his own stories not long afterward. Edmond Hamilton, a leading early writer of space opera, became a regular, and Wright also published science fiction stories by J. Schlossel and Otis Adelbert Kline. Tennessee Williams&#x27; first sale was to &quot;Weird Tales&quot;, with a short story titled &quot;The Vengeance of Nitocris&quot;. This was published in the August 1928 issue under the author&#x27;s real name, Thomas Lanier Williams. &quot;Weird Tales&quot;&#x27; subtitle was &quot;The Unique Magazine&quot;, and Wright&#x27;s story selections were as varied as the subtitle promised; he was willing to print strange or bizarre stories with no hint of the fantastic if they were unusual enough to fit in the magazine. Although Wright&#x27;s editorial standards were broad, and although he personally disliked the restrictions that convention placed on what he could publish, he did exercise caution when presented with material that might offend his readership. E. Hoffmann Price records that his story &quot;Stranger from Kurdistan&quot; was held after purchase for six months before Wright printed it in the July 1925 issue; the story includes a scene in which Christ and Satan meet, and Wright was worried about the possible reader reaction. The story nevertheless proved to be very popular, and Wright reprinted it in the December 1929 issue. He also published &quot;The Infidel&#x27;s Daughter&quot; by Price, a satire of the Ku Klux Klan, which drew an angry letter and a cancelled subscription from a Klan member. Price later recalled Wright&#x27;s response: &quot;a story that arouses controversy is good for circulation ... and anyway it would be worth a reasonable loss to rap bigots of that caliber&quot;. Wright also printed George Fielding Eliot&#x27;s &quot;The Copper Bowl&quot;, a story about a young woman being tortured; she dies when her torturer forces a rat to eat through her body. Weinberg suggests that the story was so gruesome that it would have been difficult to place in a magazine even fifty years later.

On several occasions Wright rejected a story of Lovecraft&#x27;s only to reconsider later; de Camp suggests that Wright&#x27;s rejection at the end of 1925 of Lovecraft&#x27;s &quot;In the Vault&quot;, a story about a mutilated corpse taking revenge on the undertaker responsible, was because it was &quot;too gruesome&quot;, but Wright changed his mind a few years later, and the story eventually appeared in April 1932. Wright also rejected Lovecraft&#x27;s &quot;Through the Gates of the Silver Key&quot; in mid-1933. Price had revised the story before passing it to Wright, and after Wright and Price discussed the story, Wright bought it, in November of that year. Wright turned down Lovecraft&#x27;s novel &quot;At the Mountains of Madness&quot; in 1935, though in this case it was probably because of the story&#x27;s length—running a serial required paying an author for material that would not appear until two or three issues later, and &quot;Weird Tales&quot; often had little cash to spare. In this case he did not change his mind.

Quinn was &quot;Weird Tales&quot;&#x27; most prolific author, with a long-running sequence of stories about a detective, Jules de Grandin, who investigated supernatural events, and for a while he was the most popular writer in the magazine. Other regular contributors included Paul Ernst, David H. Keller, Greye La Spina, Hugh B. Cave, and Frank Owen, who wrote fantasies set in an imaginary version of the Far East. C.L. Moore&#x27;s story &quot;Shambleau&quot;, her first sale, appeared in &quot;Weird Tales&quot; in November 1933; Price visited the &quot;Weird Tales&quot; offices shortly after Wright read the manuscript for it, and recalls that Wright was so enthusiastic about the story that he closed the office, declaring it &quot;C.L. Moore day&quot;. The story was very well received by readers, and Moore&#x27;s work, including her stories about Jirel of Joiry and Northwest Smith, appeared almost exclusively in &quot;Weird Tales&quot; over the next three years. As well as fiction, Wright printed a substantial amount of poetry, with at least one poem included in most issues. Originally this often included reprints of poems such as Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s &quot;El Dorado&quot;, but soon most of the poetry was original, with contributions from Lovecraft, Howard, and Clark Ashton Smith, among many others. Lovecraft&#x27;s contributions included ten of his &quot;Fungi from Yuggoth&quot; poems, a series of sonnets on weird themes that he wrote in 1930.
The artwork was an important element of the magazine&#x27;s personality; Margaret Brundage, who painted many covers featuring nudes for &quot;Weird Tales&quot;, was perhaps the best known artist. Many of Brundage&#x27;s covers were for stories by Seabury Quinn, and Brundage later commented that once Quinn realized that Wright always commissioned covers from Brundage that included a nude, &quot;he made sure that each de Grandin story had at least one sequence where the heroine shed all her clothes&quot;. For over three years in the early 1930s, from June 1933 to August/September 1936, Brundage was the only cover artist &quot;Weird Tales&quot; used. Another prominent cover artist was J. Allen St. John, whose covers were more action-oriented, and who designed the title logo used from 1933 until 2007. Hannes Bok&#x27;s first professional sale was to &quot;Weird Tales&quot;, for the cover of the December 1939 issue; he became a frequent contributor over the next few years.

Virgil Finlay, one of the most important figures in the history of science fiction and fantasy art, made his first sale to Wright in 1935; Wright only bought one interior illustration from Finlay at that time because he was concerned that Finlay&#x27;s delicate technique would not reproduce well on pulp paper. After a test print on pulp stock demonstrated that the reproduction was more than adequate, Wright began to buy regularly from Finlay, who became a regular cover artist for &quot;Weird Tales&quot; starting with the December 1935 issue. Demand from readers for Finlay&#x27;s artwork was so high that in 1938 Wright commissioned a series of illustrations from Finlay for lines taken from famous poems, such as &quot;O sweet and far, from cliff and scar/The horns of Elfland faintly blowing&quot;, from Tennyson&#x27;s &quot;The Princess&quot;. Not every artist was as successful as Brundage and Finlay: Price suggested that Curtis Senf, who painted 45 covers early in Wright&#x27;s tenure, &quot;was one of Sprenger&#x27;s bargains&quot;, meaning that he produced poor art, but worked fast for low rates.

During the 1930s, Brundage&#x27;s rate for a cover painting was $90. Finlay received $100 for his first cover, which appeared in 1937, over a year after his first interior illustrations were used; Weinberg suggests that the higher fee was partly to cover postage, since Brundage lived in Chicago and delivered her artwork in person, but it was also because Brundage&#x27;s popularity was beginning to decline. When Delaney acquired the magazine in late 1938, the fee for a cover painting was cut to $50, and in Weinberg&#x27;s opinion the quality of the artwork declined immediately. Nudes no longer appeared, though it is not known if this was a deliberate policy on Delaney&#x27;s part. In 1939 a campaign by Fiorello LaGuardia, the mayor of New York, to eliminate sex from the pulps led to milder covers, and this may also have had an effect. In 1936, Howard committed suicide, and the following year Lovecraft died. There was so much unpublished work by Lovecraft that Wright was able to use that he printed more material under Lovecraft&#x27;s byline after his death than before. In Howard&#x27;s case, there was no such trove of stories available, but other writers such as Henry Kuttner provided similar material. By the end of Wright&#x27;s tenure as editor, many of the writers who had become strongly associated with the magazine were gone; Kuttner, and others such as Price and Moore, were still writing, but &quot;Weird Tales&quot;&#x27; rates were too low to attract submissions from them. Clark Ashton Smith had stopped writing, and two other writers who were well-liked, G.G. Pendarves and Henry Whitehead, had died.
Except for a couple of short-lived magazines such as &quot;Strange Tales&quot; and &quot;Tales of Magic and Mystery&quot;, and a weak challenge from &quot;Ghost Stories&quot;, all between the late 1920s and the early 1930s, &quot;Weird Tales&quot; had little competition for most of Wright&#x27;s sixteen years as editor. In the early 1930s, a series of pulp magazines began to appear that became known as &quot;weird menace&quot; magazines. These lasted until the end of the decade, but despite the name there was little overlap in subject matter between them and &quot;Weird Tales&quot;: the stories in the weird menace magazines appeared to be based on occult or supernatural events, but at the end of the tale the mystery was always revealed to have a logical explanation. In 1935 Wright began running weird detective stories to try to attract some of the readers of these magazines to &quot;Weird Tales&quot;, and asked readers to write in with comments. Reader reaction was uniformly negative, and after a year he announced that there would be no more of them.

In 1939 two more serious threats appeared, both launched to compete directly for &quot;Weird Tales&quot;&#x27; readers. &quot;Strange Stories&quot; appeared in February 1939 and lasted for just over two years; Weinberg describes it as &quot;top-quality&quot;, though Ashley is less complimentary, describing it as largely unoriginal and imitative. The following month the first issue of &quot;Unknown&quot; appeared from Street &amp; Smith. Fritz Leiber submitted several of his &quot;Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser&quot; stories to Wright, but Wright rejected all of them (as did McIlwraith when she took over the editorship). Leiber subsequently sold them all to John W. Campbell for &quot;Unknown;&quot; Campbell commented each time to Leiber that &quot;these would be better in &quot;Weird Tales&quot;&quot;. The stories grew into a very popular sword and sorcery series, but none of them ever appeared in &quot;Weird Tales&quot;. Leiber did eventually sell several stories to &quot;Weird Tales&quot;, beginning with &quot;The Automatic Pistol&quot;, which appeared in May 1940.

&quot;Weird Tales&quot; included a letters column, titled &quot;The Eyrie&quot;, for most of its existence, and during Wright&#x27;s time as editor it was usually filled with long and detailed letters. When Brundage&#x27;s nude covers appeared, a lengthy debate over whether they were suitable for the magazine was fought out in the Eyrie, the two sides being divided about equally. For years it was the most discussed topic in the magazine&#x27;s letter column. Many of the authors Wright published wrote letters too, including Lovecraft, Howard, Kuttner, Bloch, Smith, Quinn, Wellman, Price, and Wandrei. In most cases these letters praised the magazine, but occasionally a critical comment was raised, as when Bloch repeatedly expressed his dislike for Howard&#x27;s stories of Conan the Barbarian, referring to him as &quot;Conan the Cimmerian Chipmunk&quot;. Another debate that was aired in the letter column was the question of how much science fiction the magazine should include. Until &quot;Amazing Stories&quot; was launched in April 1926, science fiction was popular with &quot;Weird Tales&quot;&#x27; readers, but after that point letters began to appear asking Wright to exclude science fiction, and only publish weird fantasy and horror. The pro-science fiction readers were in the majority, and as Wright agreed with them, he continued to include science fiction in &quot;Weird Tales&quot;. Hugh B. Cave, who sold half-a-dozen stories to Wright in the early 1930s, commented on &quot;The Eyrie&quot; in a letter to a fellow writer: &quot;No other magazine makes such a point of discussing past stories, and letting the authors know how their stuff is received&quot;.

=== Dorothy McIlwraith ===
McIlwraith was an experienced magazine editor, but she knew little about weird fiction, and unlike Wright she also had to face real competition from other magazines for &quot;Weird Tales&quot;&#x27; core readership. Although &quot;Unknown&quot; folded in 1943, in its four years of existence it transformed the field of fantasy and horror, and &quot;Weird Tales&quot; was no longer regarded as the leader in its field. &quot;Unknown&quot; published many successful humorous fantasy stories, and McIlwraith responded by including some humorous material, but &quot;Weird Tales&quot;″ rates were less than &quot;Unknown&quot;, with predictable effects on quality. In 1940 the policy of reprinting horror and weird classics ceased, and &quot;Weird Tales&quot; began using the slogan &quot;All Stories New – No Reprints&quot;. Weinberg suggests that this was a mistake, as &quot;Weird Tales&quot;″ readership appreciated getting access to classic stories &quot;often mentioned but rarely found&quot;. Without the reprints &quot;Weird Tales&quot; was left to survive on the rejects from &quot;Unknown&quot;, the same authors selling to both markets. In Weinberg&#x27;s words, &quot;only the quality of the stories [separated] their work between the two pulps&quot;.

Delaney&#x27;s personal taste also reduced McIlwraith&#x27;s latitude. In an interview with Robert A. Lowndes in early 1940, Delaney spoke about his plans for &quot;Weird Tales&quot;. After saying that the magazine would still publish &quot;all types of weird and fantasy fiction&quot;, Lowndes reported that Delaney did not want &quot;stories which center about sheer repulsiveness, stories which leave an impression not to be described by any other word than &#x27;nasty. Lowndes later added that Delaney had told him he found some of Clark Ashton Smith&#x27;s stories on the &quot;disgusting side&quot;.

McIlwraith continued to publish many of &quot;Weird Tales&quot;&#x27; most popular authors, including Quinn, Derleth, Hamilton, Bloch, and Manly Wade Wellman. She also added new contributors, including Ray Bradbury. &quot;Weird Tales&quot; regularly featured Fredric Brown, Mary Elizabeth Counselman, Fritz Leiber, and Theodore Sturgeon. Allison V. Harding was one of the magazine&#x27;s most frequent bylines during McIlwraith&#x27;s years as editor. As Wright had done, McIlwraith continued to buy Lovecraft stories submitted by August Derleth, though she abridged some of the longer pieces, such as &quot;The Shadow over Innsmouth&quot;. Sword and sorcery stories, a genre which Howard had made much more popular with his stories of Conan, Solomon Kane and Bran Mak Morn in &quot;Weird Tales&quot; in the early 1930s, had continued to appear under Farnsworth Wright; they all but disappeared during McIlwraith&#x27;s tenure. McIlwraith also focused more on short fiction, and serials and long stories were rare.

In May 1951 &quot;Weird Tales&quot; once again began to include reprints, in an attempt to reduce costs, but by that time the earlier issues of &quot;Weird Tales&quot; had been extensively mined for reprints by August Derleth&#x27;s publishing venture, Arkham House, and as a result McIlwraith often reprinted lesser-known stories. They were not advertised as reprints, which led in a couple of cases to letters from readers asking for more stories from H. P. Lovecraft, whom they believed to be a new author. In Weinberg&#x27;s opinion, the magazine lost variety under McIlwraith&#x27;s editorship, and &quot;much of the uniqueness of the magazine was gone&quot;. In Ashley&#x27;s view, the magazine became more consistent in quality, rather than worse; Ashley comments that though the issues edited by McIlwraith &quot;seldom attain[ed] Wright&#x27;s highpoints, they also omitted the lows&quot;. L. Sprague de Camp, toward the end of McIlwraith&#x27;s time as editor, agreed that the 1930s were the magazine&#x27;s heyday, citing Wright&#x27;s death and the departure for other, better-paying, markets of several of its contributors as factors in the magazine&#x27;s decline.

The quality of &quot;Weird Tales&quot;″ artwork suffered when Delaney cut the rates. Bok, whose first cover had appeared in December 1939, moved to New York and joined the office art staff for a while; he eventually left because of the low pay. Boris Dolgov began contributing in the 1940s; he was a friend of Bok&#x27;s and the two occasionally collaborated, signing the result &quot;Dolbokgov&quot;. Weinberg regards Dolgov&#x27;s illustration for Robert Bloch&#x27;s &quot;Yours Truly, Jack the Ripper&quot; as one of his best works. &quot;Weird Tales&quot;″ paper was of very poor quality, which meant that the reproductions were poor, and along with the low pay rate for art this meant that many artists treated &quot;Weird Tales&quot; as a last resort for their work. Damon Knight, who sold some interior artwork to &quot;Weird Tales&quot; in the early 1940s, recalled later that he was paid $5 for a single-page drawing, and $10 for a double-page spread; he worked slowly and the low pay meant &quot;Weird Tales&quot; was not a viable market for him.

The art editor, Lamont Buchanan, was able to establish five artists as regulars by the mid-1940s; they remained regular contributors until 1954, when the magazine&#x27;s first incarnation ceased publication. The five were Dolgov, John Giunta, Fred Humiston, Vincent Napoli, and Lee Brown Coye. In Weinberg&#x27;s review of &quot;Weird Tales&quot;″ interior art, he describes Humiston&#x27;s work as ranging &quot;from bad to terrible&quot;, but he is more positive about the others. Napoli had worked for &quot;Weird Tales&quot; from 1932 to the mid-1930s, when he began selling to the science fiction pulps, but his work for &quot;Short Stories&quot; brought him back to &quot;Weird Tales&quot; in the 1940s. Weinberg speaks highly of both Napoli and Coye, whom Weinberg describes as &quot;the master of the weird and grotesque illustration&quot;. Coye did a series of full-page illustrations for &quot;Weird Tales&quot; called &quot;Weirdisms&quot;, which ran intermittently from November 1948 to July 1951.

The letter column, &quot;The Eyrie&quot;, was much reduced in size during McIlwraith&#x27;s tenure, but as a gesture to the readers a &quot;&quot;Weird Tales&quot; Club&quot; was started. Joining the Club simply meant writing in to receive a free membership card; the only other benefit was that the magazine listed all the members&#x27; names and addresses, so that members could contact each other. Among the names listed in the January 1943 issue was that of Hugh Hefner, later to become famous as the founder of &quot;Playboy&quot;.

Toward the end of McIlwraith&#x27;s time as editor a couple of new writers appeared, including Richard Matheson and Joseph Payne Brennan. Brennan had already sold over a dozen stories to other pulps when he finally made a sale to McIlwraith, but he had always wanted to sell to &quot;Weird Tales&quot;, and three years after the magazine folded he launched a small-press horror magazine named &quot;Macabre&quot;, which he published for some years, in imitation of &quot;Weird Tales&quot;.

=== Moskowitz, Carter, and Bellerophon ===
The four issues edited by Sam Moskowitz in the early 1970s included a detailed biography of William Hope Hodgson, serialized over three issues, along with some rare stories of Hodgson&#x27;s that Moskowitz had unearthed. Many of the other stories were reprints, either from &quot;Weird Tales&quot; or from other early pulps such as &quot;The Black Cat&quot; or &quot;Blue Book&quot;. In Ashley&#x27;s opinion, the magazine &quot;had the feel of a museum piece with nothing new or progressive&quot;, though Weinberg describes the magazine as having &quot;an interesting jumble of contents&quot;. The subsequent paperback series edited by Lin Carter was criticized in similar terms: Weinberg regards it as having &quot;too much reliance ... on the old names like Lovecraft, Howard and Smith by reprinting mediocre material ... New writers were not sufficiently encouraged&quot;, though Weinberg does add that Ramsey Campbell, Tanith Lee and Steve Rasnic Tem were among the newer writers who contributed good material. Ashley&#x27;s opinion of the two Bellerophon issues is low: he describes them as lacking &quot;any clear editorial direction or acumen&quot;.

=== Ann VanderMeer ===
The April/May 2007 edition featured the magazine&#x27;s first all-new design in almost seventy-five years. With Stephen H. Segal as editorial and creative director and Ann VanderMeer as fiction editor, during the next few years the magazine &quot;won a number of awards and great acclaim.&quot; In 2010 VanderMeer became the magazine&#x27;s editor-in chief.

During this time &quot;Weird Tales&quot; published works by a wide range of strange-fiction authors including Michael Moorcock and Tanith Lee, as well as newer writers such as N. K. Jemisin, Jay Lake, Cat Rambo, and Rachel Swirsky. This period also saw the addition of a broader range of content, ranging from narrative essays to comics to features on weird culture. The magazine won its first Hugo Award in August 2009, in the semiprozine category, along with receiving two Hugo Award nominations in subsequent years and its first World Fantasy Award nomination, for Segal and Vandermeer, in more than seventeen years.

In addition to winning or being nominated for awards, under VanderMeer&#x27;s editorship &quot;Weird Tales&quot; saw the number of subscriptions triple as the magazine &quot;came to symbolise what was good about the changes in the SF community.&quot;

=== Marvin Kaye and after ===

in 2011 Marvin Kaye and John Harlacher purchased &quot;Weird Tales&quot; from John Gregory Betancourt with Kaye taking over chief editorial duties from VanderMeer. Issue 359, the first under the new publishers, was published in late February 2012. Some months before the release of issue 359, a special World Fantasy Convention preview issue was given away for free to interested attendees.

In August 2012, &quot;Weird Tales&quot; became involved in a media altercation after Kaye announced the magazine was going to publish an excerpt from Victoria Foyt&#x27;s controversial novel &quot;Save the Pearls&quot;, which many critics accused of featuring racist stereotyping. The decision was made despite the protests of VanderMeer, and prompted her to end her association with the magazine. Kaye wrote an essay titled &quot;A Thoroughly NONRACIST Novel&quot; defending his decision to publish the excerpt. Both the essay and Kaye&#x27;s decision to publish the excerpt were heavily criticized, N. K. Jemisin saying &quot;This is how you destroy something beautiful&quot; with regards to the magazine and Jim C. Hines saying he was &quot;highly disturbed that the editor ever thought this was in any way a good idea, that he was so supportive of this novel that he was going out of his way to defend and support it … up until the Internet landed on his head.&quot;

The publisher subsequently overruled Kaye and announced that &quot;Weird Tales&quot; no longer had plans to run the excerpt.

After the fall 2012 issue #360, Kaye only published two more issues of &quot;Weird Tales&quot;, issue #361 in the summer of 2013 and #362 in the spring of 2014.

In 2019 &quot;Weird Tales&quot; returned with author Jonathan Maberry as the editorial director, with issue #363 being released at the end of that year. This issue featured the story &quot;Up from Slavery&quot; by Victor LaValle, which later won the Stoker Award for Best Long Fiction.

=== Legacy ===
&quot;Weird Tales&quot; was one of the most important magazines in the fantasy field; in Ashley&#x27;s view, it is &quot;second only to &quot;Unknown&quot; in significance and influence&quot;. Weinberg goes further, calling it &quot;the most important and influential of all fantasy magazines&quot;. Weinberg argues that much of the material &quot;Weird Tales&quot; published would never have appeared if the magazine had not existed. It was through &quot;Weird Tales&quot; that Lovecraft, Howard, and Clark Ashton Smith became widely known, and it was the first and one of the most important markets for weird and science fantasy artwork. Many of the horror stories adapted for early radio shows such as &quot;Stay Tuned for Terror&quot; originally appeared in &quot;Weird Tales&quot;. The magazine&#x27;s &quot;Golden Age&quot; was under Wright, and de Camp argues that one of Wright&#x27;s accomplishments was to create a &quot;&quot;Weird Tales&quot; school of writing&quot;. Justin Everett and Jeffrey H. Shanks, the editors of a recent scholarly collection of literary criticism focused on the magazine, argue that &quot;&quot;Weird Tales&quot; functioned as a nexus point in the development of speculative fiction from which emerged the modern genres of fantasy and horror&quot;.

The magazine was, unusually for a pulp, included by the editors of the annual Year in Fiction anthologies, and was generally regarded with more respect than most of the pulps. This remained true long after the magazine&#x27;s first run ended, as it became the main source of fantasy short stories for anthologists for several decades. Weinberg argues that the fantasy pulps, of which, in his opinion, &quot;Weird Tales&quot; was the most influential, helped to form the modern fantasy genre, and that Wright, &quot;if he was not a perfect editor ... was an extraordinary one, and one of the most influential figures in modern American fantasy fiction&quot;, adding that &quot;Weird Tales&quot; and its competitors &quot;served as the bedrock upon which much of modern fantasy rests&quot;. Everett and Shanks agree, and regard &quot;Weird Tales&quot; as the venue where writers, editors and an engaged readership &quot;elevated speculated fiction to new heights&quot; with influence that &quot;reverberates through modern popular culture&quot;. In Ashley&#x27;s words, &quot;somewhere in the imagination reservoir of all U.S. (and many non-U.S.) genre-fantasy and horror writers is part of the spirit of &quot;Weird Tales&quot;&quot;.

== Bibliographic details ==

The editorial succession at &quot;Weird Tales&quot; was as follows:
Baird was listed as editor for the May/June/July 1924 issue, but that issue was assembled by Wright and Kline.

The publisher for the first year was Rural Publishing Corporation; this changed to Popular Fiction Publishing with the November 1924 issue, and to Weird Tales, Inc. with the December 1938 issue. The four issues in the early 1970s came from Renown Publications, and the four paperbacks in the early 1980s were published by Zebra Books. The next two issues were from Bellerophon, and then from Spring 1988 to Winter 1996 the publisher was Terminus. From Summer 1998 to July/August 2003 the publisher was DNA Publications and Terminus, listed either as DNA Publications/Terminus or just as DNA Publications. The September/October 2003 issue listed the publisher as DNA Publications/Wildside Press/Terminus, and through 2004 this remained the case, one issue dropping Terminus from the masthead. Thereafter Wildside Press was the publisher, sometimes with Terminus listed as well, until the September/October 2007 issue, after which only Wildside Press were listed. The issues published from 2012 through 2014 were from Nth Dimension Media.

&quot;Weird Tales&quot; was in pulp format for its entire first run except for the issues from May 1923 to April 1924, when it was a large pulp, and the last year, from September 1953 to September 1954, when it was a digest. The four 1970s issues were in pulp format. The two Bellerophon issues were quarto. The Terminus issues reverted to pulp format until the Winter 1992/1993 issue, which was large pulp. A single pulp issue appeared in Fall 1998, and then the format returned to large pulp until the Fall 2000 issue, which was quarto. The format varied between large pulp and quarto until January 2006, which was large pulp, as were all issues after that date until Fall 2009, except for a quarto-sized November 2008. From Summer 2010 the format was quarto.

The first run of the magazine was priced at 25 cents for the first fifteen years of its life except for the oversized May/June/July 1924 issue, which was 50 cents. In September 1939 the price was reduced to 15 cents, where it stayed until the September 1947 issue, which was 20 cents. The price went up again to 25 cents in May 1949; the digest-sized issues from September 1953 to September 1954 were 35 cents. The first three paperbacks edited by Lin Carter were priced at $2.50; the fourth was $2.95. The two Bellerophon issues were $2.50 and $2.95. The Terminus &quot;Weird Tales&quot; began in Spring 1988 priced at $3.50; this went up to $4.00 with the Fall 1988 issue, and to $4.95 with the Summer 1990 issue. The next price increase was to $5.95, in Spring 2003, and then to $6.99 with the January 2008 issue. The first two issues from Nth Dimension Media were priced at $7.95 and $6.99; the last two were $9.99 each.

Some of the early Terminus editions of &quot;Weird Tales&quot; were also printed in hardcover format, in limited editions of 200 copies. These were signed by the contributors, and were available at $40 as part of a subscription offer. Issues produced in this format include Summer 1988, Spring/Fall 1989, Winter 1989/1990, Spring 1991, and Winter 1991/1992.

===Anthologies===
Starting in 1925, Christine Campbell Thomson edited a series of horror story anthologies, published by Selwyn and Blount, titled &quot;Not at Night&quot;. These were considered an unofficial U.K. edition of the magazine, the stories sometimes appearing in the anthology before the magazine&#x27;s U.S. version appeared. The ones which drew a substantial fraction of their contents from &quot;Weird Tales&quot; were:

There was also a 1937 anthology titled &quot;Not at Night Omnibus&quot;, which selected 35 stories from the &quot;Not at Night&quot; series, of which 20 had originally appeared in &quot;Weird Tales&quot;. In the U.S. an anthology titled &quot;Not at Night!&quot;, edited by Herbert Asbury, appeared from Macy-Macius in 1928; this selected 25 stories from the series, 24 of them drawn from &quot;Weird Tales.&quot;

Numerous other anthologies of stories from &quot;Weird Tales&quot; have been published, including:

=== Canadian and British editions ===
A Canadian edition of &quot;Weird Tales&quot; appeared from June 1935 to July 1936; all fourteen issues are thought to be identical to the U.S. issues of those dates, though &quot;Printed in Canada&quot; appeared on the cover, and in at least one case another text box was placed on the cover to conceal part of a nude figure. Another Canadian series began in 1942, as a result of import restrictions placed on U.S. magazines. Canadian editions from 1942 up to January 1948 were not identical to the U.S. editions, but they match closely enough that the originals are easily identified. From the May 1942 to January 1945 issues, they correspond to the U.S. editions two issues earlier, that is, from January 1942 to September 1944. There was no Canadian issue corresponding to the November 1944 U.S. issue, so from that point the Canadian issues were only one behind the U.S. ones: the issues from March 1945 to January 1948 correspond to the U.S. issues from January 1945 to November 1947. There was no Canadian issue of the January 1948 U.S. issue, and from the next issue, March 1948, till the end of the Canadian run in November 1951, the issues were identical to the U.S. versions.

There were numerous differences between the Canadian issues from May 1942 to January 1948 and the corresponding U.S. issues. All the covers were repainted by Canadian artists until the January 1945 issue; thereafter the artwork from the original issues was used. Initially the fiction content of the Canadian issues was unchanged from the U.S., but starting in September 1942 the Canadian &quot;Weird Tales&quot; dropped some of the original stories in each issue, replacing them with either stories from other issues of &quot;Weird Tales&quot;, or, occasionally, material from &quot;Short Stories&quot;.

In a couple of instances a story appeared in the Canadian edition of the magazine before its appearance in the U.S. version, or simultaneously with it, so it is evident that whoever assembled the issues had access to the &quot;Weird Tales&quot; pending story file. Because of the reorganization of material, it often happened that one of the Canadian issues would have more than a single story by the same author. In these cases a pseudonym was invented for one of the stories.

There were four separate editions of &quot;Weird Tales&quot; distributed in the United Kingdom. In early 1942, three issues abridged from the September 1940, November 1940, and January 1941 U.S. issues were published in the U.K. by Gerald Swan; they were undated, and had no volume numbers. The middle issue was 64 pages long; the other two were 48 pages. All were priced at 6d. A single issue was released in late 1946 by William Merrett; it also was undated and unnumbered. It was 36 pages long, and was priced at 1/6. The three stories included came from the October 1937 U.S. issue.

A longer run of 23 issues appeared between November 1949 and December 1953, from Thorpe &amp; Porter. These were all undated; the first issue had no volume or issue number but subsequent issues were numbered sequentially. Most were priced at 1/-; issues 11 to 15 were 1/6. All were 96 pages long. The first issue corresponds to the July 1949 U.S. issue; the next 20 issues correspond to the U.S. issues from November 1949 to January 1953, and the final two issues correspond to May 1953 and March 1953, in that order. Another five bimonthly issues appeared from Thorpe &amp; Porter dated November 1953 to July 1954, with the volume numbering restarted at volume 1 number 1. These correspond to the U.S. issues from September 1953 to May 1954.

=== Collectability ===
&quot;Weird Tales&quot; is widely collected, and many issues command very high prices. In 2008, Mike Ashley estimated the first issue to be worth £3,000 in excellent condition, and added that the second issue is much rarer and commands higher prices. Issues with stories by Lovecraft or Howard are very highly sought-after, with the October 1923 issue, containing &quot;Dagon&quot;, Lovecraft&#x27;s first appearance in &quot;Weird Tales&quot;, fetching comparable prices to the first two issues. The first few volumes are so rare that very few academic collections have more than a handful of these issues: Eastern New Mexico University, the holder of a remarkably complete early science fiction archive, has &quot;only a few scattered issues&quot; from the early years, and the librarian recorded in 1983 that &quot;dealers laugh when Eastern enquires about these&quot;.

Prices of the magazine drop over the succeeding decades, the McIlwraith issues being worth far less than the ones edited by Wright. Ashley quotes the digest-sized issues from the end of McIlwraith&#x27;s tenure as fetching £8 to £10 each as of 2008. The revived editions are not particularly scarce, with two exceptions. The two Bellerophon issues received such poor distribution that they fetch high prices: Ashley quotes a 2008 price of £40 to £50 for the first one, and twice that for the second one. The other valuable recent issues are the hardback versions of the Terminus &quot;Weird Tales&quot;; Ashley gives prices of between £40 and £90, with some of the special author issues fetching a premium.

<text>Seabury Grandin Quinn (also known as Jerome Burke; January 1, 1889 – December 24, 1969) was an American government lawyer, journalist, and pulp magazine author, most famous for his stories of the occult detective Jules de Grandin, published in &quot;Weird Tales&quot;.

==Biography==
Seabury Quinn was born January 1, 1889, in Washington, D.C. In 1910 Quinn graduated from the law school of the National University and was admitted to the District of Columbia Bar.

Quinn served in the Army in World War I. After his service he became editor of a group of trade papers in New York, where he taught medical jurisprudence and wrote technical articles and pulp magazine fiction.

His first published work was &quot;The Law of the Movies&quot;, in &quot;The Motion Picture Magazine&quot;, December 1917. (His story &quot;Painted Gold&quot; may have been written earlier.) &quot;Demons of the Night&quot; was published in &quot;Detective Story Magazine&quot; on March 19, 1918, followed by &quot;Was She Mad?&quot; on March 25, 1918. He published &quot;The Stone Image&quot; in 1919. He introduced Jules de Grandin as a character in 1925 (taking the character&#x27;s surname from his own middle name), and continued writing stories about him until 1951. The longest of the de Grandin stories is the 1932 novel-length story &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Bride&quot;, strongly influenced by Robert W. Chambers&#x27; 1920 novel &quot;The Slayer of Souls&quot;.

In 1937 he returned to Washington to represent a chain of trade journals, and there subsequently became a government lawyer for the duration of World War II. He alternated between law and journalism all his life. He published over five hundred short stories.

His first book, &quot;Roads&quot; (a new origin for Santa Claus, drawn from the original Christian legends), was published by Arkham House in 1948.

Ten of the Jules de Grandin stories were collected in &quot;The Phantom Fighter&quot; (Mycroft &amp; Moran, an imprint of Arkham House), 1966. A broader selection of the stories, including the novel &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Bride&quot;, was issued in a six-volume Popular Library paperback edition in 1967–77. A three-volume omnibus reportedly including all the de Grandin stories was issued by Battered Silicon Dispatch Box in 2001.

Although the De Grandin stories were enormously popular on their initial publication, modern critics tend to regard them as the weakest part of Quinn&#x27;s work, with Brian Stableford describing the De Grandin stories &quot;as indeed rather undistinguished&quot;, claiming they are full of stereotyped characters and poorly resolved plots. Quinn wrote several non-De Grandin tales in the 1940s and 1950s; Stableford states Quinn&#x27;s &quot;best stories here are ironically perverted love stories&quot;, such as &quot;The Globe of Memories&quot; (1937) and 
&quot;Glamour&quot; (1939).

His writing was secondary to his career as a lawyer specializing in mortuary jurisprudence. He taught this subject at mortuary schools for many years, and for some 15 years was the editor of &quot;Casket &amp; Sunnyside&quot;, a leading trade journal. His Jerome Burke stories are still published in the &quot;Dodge&quot; embalming magazine.

Of his professional work, only two books were published. The first was &quot;A Syllabus of Mortuary Jurisprudence&quot;, published in book form in 1933 by Clement Williams of Kansas City, Kansas, with a foreword by C. A. Renouard (of the Renouard School of Embalming) and Clement Williams (of the Clement Williams School of Embalming). This was distilled from a lecture he gave in 1914. The text was extant as early as 1924/1925, being serialized in &quot;Casket and Sunnyside&quot;. Quinn became editor of &quot;Casket and Sunnyside&quot; in December 1925. 
The second was &quot;An Encyclopedic Law Glossary For Funeral Directors and Embalmers&quot;, published by the Williams Institute of Mortuary Science, Kansas City 1940, with an introduction by Quinn, dated January 1940. This had a series of definitions of terms that had puzzled his students.

Besides contributing to the then &quot;De-Ce-Co Magazine&quot;, later the &quot;Dodge Magazine&quot;, for the Dodge Chemical Co, of Cambridge, Massachusetts, Quinn wrote articles for &quot;The American Funeral Director&quot; and other trade journals. 
His Jerome Burke material, not necessarily in sequence, is available in &quot;This I Remember: Memoirs of a Funeral Director&quot;, published by the Battered Silicon Dispatch Box, with a foreword by Arnold Dodge.

Quinn was a contemporary of Robert E. Howard, H. P. Lovecraft, and Clark Ashton Smith. Mary Elizabeth Counselman was a friend of Quinn&#x27;s and wrote a tribute to him after he died.

Quinn&#x27;s posthumously published novel &quot;Alien Flesh&quot; (1977) is a sexually explicit erotic fantasy about a male Egyptologist who has a magical sex change into a beautiful young woman. It has been described as a &quot;bold and striking celebration of sexual confusion&quot; in the style of Pierre Louÿs. It was illustrated by Stephen Fabian.

On July 4, 1926, Quinn and his first wife Mary Helen Molster Quinn, had one child. Their son, Seabury Quinn, Jr., received drama degrees from Harvard, Colombia, and Yale Universities and served as professor of theater at Ohio University close to thirty years, endowing the Seabury Quinn Jr. Playwrights Festival in Athens, Ohio. 

==Recent publications==
&quot;Night Creatures&quot;, a collection of stories by Quinn, edited by Peter Ruber and Joseph Wrzos for Ash-Tree Press appeared in (2003).
&quot;Demons of the Night&quot;, another collection of his stories, was published by Black Dog Books, of Normal, Illinois. Edited by Gene Christie, it contains his early stories. It has two of the &quot;Major Sturdevant and his Washington Nights&#x27; Entertainment series&quot;, subtitled &quot;Stories of the Secret Service&quot;, and two more featuring Professor Forrester, another amateur detector of crimes. It also contains one of the most complete bibliographies of Quinn yet published.

&quot;Someday I&#x27;ll Kill You!&quot;, was published by Black Dog Books, of Normal, Illinois. Edited by Gene Christie, it contains all of Quinn&#x27;s non-series stories published outside of Weird Tales between 1925 and 1963.

All of the Jules deGrandin stories were reprinted in 5 hardcover volumes in 2018 &amp; 2019 by Night Shade Books.

A facsimile of the 1948 Arkham House edition of &quot;Roads&quot; was published 2017 by Shadowridge Press.

<doc id="208829" wikidata="Q11310481" url="?curid=208829" title="Jules de Grandin">
<text>Jules de Grandin is a fictional occult detective that, from 1925-1951, starred in 92 short stories and one novel by Seabury Quinn in the pulp magazine anthology series &quot;Weird Tales&quot;. In the pages of &quot;Weird Tales&quot;, Quinn also authored a serialized novel featuring de Grandin entitled &quot;The Devil’s Bride&quot;, which deals with a young girl being kidnapped by satanists. In 1966, Arkham House published a collection of 10 de Grandin stories as &quot;The Phantom Fighter,&quot; leading some fans to refer to the character by this nickname afterward. The character&#x27;s methods of reasoning and investigation has led to comparisons with Sherlock Holmes and Hercule Poirot.

==Overview==
In the stories, de Grandin is a French physician who is physically fit, with blonde hair and blue eyes. A former member of the French Sûreté, de Grandin becomes an expert in the occult and is eager to lend his aid and investigative skills when called. De Grandin lives in Harrisonville, New Jersey, and often new cases are brought to his attention by Jeremy Costello of the Harrisonville Police Department. Similar to Sherlock Holmes having a supporting cast of the landlady/housekeeper Mrs. Hudson and his aid and biographer Dr. Watson, de Grandin has a housekeeper named Nora McGinnis and is assisted on his investigations by Dr. Trowbridge, a fellow physician who narrates the stories. In his stories, De Grandin sometimes encounters otherworldly beings such as ghosts and werewolves, but in several instances he discovers the danger at hand is not supernatural as others suspected but simply the evil acts of ordinary people who are corrupt.

==Collected editions==
In 1966 Mycroft &amp; Moran published a ten-story, hardcover de Grandin collection, &quot;The Phantom Fighter&quot;. The collection included stories published between 1925 and 1930; Quinn provided an introductory essay. He also modernized the text in the stories.

Beginning in 1976, Popular Library issued five paperback collections of de Grandin stories, assembled and edited by Robert Weinberg. The collections included about one-third of the series as well as the only full-length de Grandin novel, &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Bride&quot;. The volumes carried covers by Vincent DiFate and included interior illustrations by Stephen Fabian. Aside from &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Bride&quot;, originally serialized in 1932, only three of the stories included had been published after 1930.

*&quot;The Adventures of Jules de Grandin&quot; (August 1976)
*&quot;The Casebook of Jules de Grandin&quot; (September 1976)
*&quot;The Skeleton Closet of Jules de Grandin&quot; (October 1976)
*&quot;The Devil&#x27;s Bride&quot; (November 1976)
*&quot;The Hellfire Files of Jules de Grandin&quot; (December 1976)
*&quot;The Horror Chambers of Jules de Grandin&quot; (February 1977)

No further volumes in the series were released, though more were planned, and the initial volumes were never reprinted. Weinberg reprinted three more stories in some of his reprint fanzines.

A collection of six stories in French translation, &quot;Les archives de Jules de Grandin&quot;, was issued by the Librairie des Champs-Elysées in 1979.

The entire series of stories has been reprinted by Night Shade Books in a five volume set called &quot;The Complete Tales of Jules de Grandin&quot; and in a three-volume set from Battered Silicon Dispatch Box Press. The Night Shade volumes use the print files from the Battered Silicon editions. The individual Night Shade volumes are

* &quot;The Horror on the Links&quot; (covering stories from 1925 to 1928)
* &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Rosary&quot; (1929 &amp; 1930)
* &quot;The Dark Angel&quot; (1931 to July 1933, including the novel &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Bride&quot;)
* &quot;The Rival from the Grave&quot; (August 1933 to March 1938)
* &quot;Black Moon&quot; (June 1938 through to the last story in September 1951).

&quot;The Devil&#x27;s Bride&quot; was issued in an Italian edition, &quot;Jules de Grandin: La Sposa del Diavolo&quot;, in 2015, translated by Nicola Lombardi and published by La Zona Morta.

==&quot;Weird Tales&quot;==
de Grandin stories were often selected for the cover of &quot;Weird Tales&quot;, particularly when Margaret Brundage was the regular cover artist.

<doc id="208830" wikidata="Q334846" url="?curid=208830" title="Edmund Allenby, 1st Viscount Allenby">
<text>Field Marshal Edmund Henry Hynman Allenby, 1st Viscount Allenby, (23 April 1861 – 14 May 1936) was a senior British Army officer and Imperial Governor. He fought in the Second Boer War and also in World War I, in which he led the British Empire&#x27;s Egyptian Expeditionary Force (EEF) during the Sinai and Palestine Campaign against the Ottoman Empire in the conquest of Palestine.

The British succeeded in capturing Beersheba, Jaffa, and Jerusalem from October to December 1917. His forces occupied the Jordan Valley during the summer of 1918, then went on to capture northern Palestine and defeat the Ottoman Yildirim Army Group&#x27;s Eighth Army at the Battle of Megiddo, forcing the Fourth and Seventh Army to retreat towards Damascus. Subsequently, the EEF Pursuit by Desert Mounted Corps captured Damascus and advanced into northern Syria.

During this pursuit, he commanded T. E. Lawrence (&quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;), whose campaign with Faisal&#x27;s Arab Sherifial Forces assisted the EEF&#x27;s capture of Ottoman Empire territory and fought the Battle of Aleppo, five days before the Armistice of Mudros ended the campaign on 30 October 1918. He continued to serve in the region as High Commissioner in Egypt from 1919 until 1925, a position that meant he effectively ruled Egypt during this period.

==Early life==
Allenby was born on 23 April 1861, the son of Hynman Allenby and Catherine Anne Allenby (née Cane) and was educated at Haileybury College. His father owned in Norfolk and Felixstowe House, at Felixstowe, then a fishing village. This was a summer home until the family settled there permanently after Hynman Allenby&#x27;s death in 1878.

Allenby had no great desire to be a soldier, and tried to enter the Indian Civil Service but failed the entry exam.
He sat the exam for the Royal Military College, Sandhurst in 1880 and was commissioned as a subaltern, with the rank of lieutenant, in the 6th (Inniskilling) Dragoons on 10 May 1882. He joined his regiment in South Africa later that year, taking part in the Bechuanaland Expedition of 1884–85. After serving at the cavalry depot in Canterbury, he was promoted to captain on 10 January 1888 and then returned to South Africa.

Allenby returned to Britain in 1890 and he sat – and failed – the entry exam for the Staff College at Camberley. Not deterred, he sat the exam again the next year and passed. Captain Douglas Haig of the 7th Hussars also entered the college at the same time, thus beginning a rivalry between the two that ran until the First World War. Allenby was more popular with fellow officers, even being made &quot;Master of the Draghounds&quot; in preference to Haig who was the better rider; Allenby had already developed a passion for polo. Their contemporary James Edward Edmonds later claimed that the staff at the Staff College thought Allenby dull and stupid but were impressed by a speech that he gave to the Farmers&#x27; Dinner, which had in fact been written for him by Edmonds and another.

He was promoted to major on 19 May 1897 and was posted to the 3rd Cavalry Brigade, then serving in Ireland, as the brigade major in March 1898.

==Second Boer War==
Following the outbreak of the Second Boer War in October 1899, Allenby returned to his regiment, and the Inniskillings embarked at Queenstown and landed at Cape Town, South Africa, later that year. He took part in the actions at Colesberg on 11 January 1900, Klip Drift on 15 February 1900 and Dronfield Ridge on 16 February 1900, and was mentioned in dispatches by the commander-in-chief, Lord Roberts on 31 March 1900.

Allenby, by now a major, was appointed to command the squadron of New South Wales Lancers, who were camped beside the Australian Light Horse outside Bloemfontein. Both men and horses suffered from the continuous rain and men with cases of enteric fever were taken away every day. Allenby soon established himself as a strict disciplinarian, according to A. B. Paterson even imposing a curfew on the officers&#x27; mess.

Allenby participated in the actions at Zand River on 10 May 1900, Kalkheuval Pass on 3 June 1900, Barberton on 12 September 1900 and Tevreden on 16 October 1900 when the Boer General Jan Smuts was defeated. He was promoted to local lieutenant-colonel on 1 January 1901, and to local colonel on 29 April 1901. In a despatch dated 23 June 1902, Lord Kitchener, Commander-in-Chief during the latter part of the war, described him as &quot;a popular and capable Cavalry Brigadier&quot;. For his services during the war, he was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in the South Africa honours list published on 26 June 1902, and he received the actual decoration of CB from King Edward VII during an investiture at Buckingham Palace on 24 October 1902.

==In between wars==
Allenby returned to Britain in 1902 and became commanding officer of the 5th Royal Irish Lancers in Colchester with the substantive rank of lieutenant-colonel on 2 August 1902, and the brevet rank of colonel from 22 August 1902. He was promoted to the substantive rank of colonel and to the temporary rank of brigadier general on 19 October 1905. He assumed command of the 4th Cavalry Brigade in 1906. He was promoted to the rank of major-general on 10 September 1909 and was appointed inspector of cavalry on 25 April 1910 due to his extensive cavalry experience. He was nicknamed &quot;The Bull&quot; due to an increasing tendency for sudden bellowing outbursts of explosive rage directed at his subordinates, combined with his powerful physical frame. Allenby stood with a barrel chest and his very bad temper made &quot;The Bull&quot; a figure who inspired much consternation among those who had to work under him.

==First World War==
During the First World War, Allenby initially served on the Western Front. At the outbreak of war in August 1914, a British Expeditionary Force (BEF) was sent to France, under the command of Field Marshal Sir John French. It consisted of four infantry divisions (the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 5th, with the 4th and 6th being held in Britain) and one cavalry division, the latter commanded by Allenby. The cavalry division first saw action in semi-chaotic circumstances covering the retreat after the Battle of Mons opposing the German Army&#x27;s invasion of France. One of Allenby&#x27;s subordinates claimed at the time: &quot;He cannot explain verbally, with any lucidity at all, what his plans are&quot;. When a headquarters officer asked why Brigadier General Hubert Gough&#x27;s cavalry brigade was miles from where it was supposed to be, he received the reply: &quot;He told me he was getting as far away from the Bull as possible. It was a most scandalous affair, and he was in an almost open rebellion against Allenby at the time&quot;. The division distinguished itself under Allenby&#x27;s direction in the subsequent fighting, with minimal resources at its disposal, at the First Battle of Ypres.

===Western Front===
Allenby was promoted to temporary lieutenant general on 10 October 1914. As the BEF was expanded in size to two armies, he was rewarded by being made commander of the Cavalry Corps. On 6 May 1915, Allenby voluntarily left the Cavalry Arm to take up command of V Corps which was engaged at that moment in severe fighting at the Second Battle of Ypres. Commanding a corps seemed to make Allenby&#x27;s bad temper even worse where anything from a split infinitive in a staff paper to discovering a corpse in the field without the tin helmet that Allenby ordered his men to wear sent Allenby off into a rage. The V Corps was victorious in defeating the German assault but incurred controversially heavy losses in the process through Allenby&#x27;s tactical policy of continual counterattacks at the German attacking force. In September 1915, V Corps attempted a diversion of German strength to facilitate the concurrent British offensive at Loos. They executed a minor attack in the Hooge Sector in the Ypres Salient under Allenby&#x27;s direction, which once again incurred substantial losses to its units involved in the affair.

In October 1915, Allenby was promoted to the temporary rank of general to lead the Third Army of the BEF, being made lieutenant-general (substantive rank) on 1 January 1916. In the mid-summer of 1916, he was the army commander in support of the launch of the Battle of the Somme, with responsibility for the abortive assault by Third Army troops on the trench fortress of the Gommecourt salient, which failed with severe casualties to the units under his command in the operation. By this time in 1916, Archibald Wavell, who was one of Allenby&#x27;s staff officers and supporters, wrote that Allenby&#x27;s temper seemed to &quot;confirm the legend that &#x27;the Bull&#x27; was merely a bad-tempered, obstinate hot-head, a &#x27;thud-and-blunder&#x27; general&quot;. Allenby harboured doubts about the leadership of the commander of the BEF, General Sir Douglas Haig, who had replaced Field Marshal French as commander-in-chief (C-in-C) of the BEF in December 1915, (and with whom Allenby had clashed at the Staff College some twenty years earlier) but refused to allow any of his officers to say anything critical about Haig. However, despite Allenby&#x27;s rages and obsession with applying the rules in a way that often seemed petty, Allenby&#x27;s staff officers found an intellectually curious general who was interested in finding new ways of breaking the stalemate. J. F. C. Fuller called Allenby &quot;a man I grew to like and respect&quot;, a man who always asked his staff if they had any new ideas about how to win the war. Allenby had wider interests than many other British generals, reading books on every conceivable subject from botany to poetry and was noted for his critical intellect. An officer who had dinner with Allenby at his headquarters in a French château recalled:

His keen grey-blue eyes, under heavy brows, search the face while he probes the mind with sharp, almost staccato questions about everything under the sun except what is expected. He cannot suffer fools gladly and demands an unequivocal affirmative or negative to every query he makes. He has a habit of asking questions on the most abstruse subjects, and an unpleasant knack of catching out anyone who gives an evasive answer for the sake of politeness.

Many of Allenby&#x27;s officers believed that he was incapable of any emotion except rage, but he was in fact a loving father and husband who was intensely concerned about his only child, Michael, who was serving at the front. Before Allenby went to bed every night, Allenby would enter the office of the officer who took the daily casualty returns, ask &quot;Have you any news of my little boy today?&quot; and after the officer replied &quot;No news sir&quot;, Allenby would then go to bed a reassured man.

In early 1917, Allenby was ordered by Haig, now a field marshal, to start preparations for a major offensive around the city of Arras. During his planning Allenby insisted upon putting into practice many of the ideas that his staff officers had offered. Allenby rejected the normal week-long bombardment of the German trenches before making an assault, instead planning on a 48-hour bombardment before the assault went ahead. In addition, Allenby had made careful plans to control traffic in the rear to prevent traffic jams that would block his logistics, a second echelon behind the first echelon that would only be sent in to exploit successes, tunnels to bring up new divisions behind the German lines while avoiding German fire and finally new weapons like tanks and aircraft were to play prominent roles in the offensive. In March 1917, the Germans pulled back to the Hindenburg Line, which led Allenby to argue that the planned offensive in the Arras sector in April should be changed, a request Haig refused. Despite refusing Allenby&#x27;s request for more time to change his plans, Haig informed him that the entire responsibility for the failure of the Arras offensive would rest with him. As the Zero Hour for the offensive at 5:30 am on 9 April 1917 approached, Allenby was thus unusually worried as he knew his entire career was in the balance.

At first, the Arras offensive went well with the Third Army breaking through the German lines and advancing three-and-a-half miles in one day. In a letter to his wife on 10 April 1917, Allenby wrote: &quot;I had a very big success yesterday. I won all along the line; killed a host of Boche and took over 7,500 prisoners...We have, at last, brought off what I been working on all winter. My staff has been splendid&quot;. There were weeks of heavy fighting during the Third Army&#x27;s offensive at the Battle of Arras in the spring of the 1917, where an initial breakthrough had deteriorated into trench-fighting positional warfare—once more with heavy casualties to 3rd Army&#x27;s units involved. Allenby lost the confidence of the BEF&#x27;s commander, Haig. He was promoted to full general on 3 June 1917, but he was replaced at the head of the Third Army by Lieutenant-General Sir Julian Byng on 9 June 1917 and returned to England.

===Egypt and Palestine===
==== British change of grand strategy ====
The British War Cabinet was divided in debate in May 1917 over the allocation of British resources between the Western Front and other fronts, with Allied victory over Germany far from certain. Curzon and Hankey recommended that Britain seize ground in the Middle East. Lloyd George also wanted more effort on other fronts. Previously, leaders had been concerned that taking over Palestine would divide it and leave it for other countries to take, but repeated losses to the Turkish Army and the stalled Western Front changed their minds.

Lloyd George wanted a commander &quot;of the dashing type&quot; to replace Lieutenant General Sir Archibald Murray in command of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force (EEF). Jan Smuts refused the command (late May) unless promised resources for a decisive victory. Lloyd George appointed Allenby to the role, although it was not decided immediately whether he would be authorised to launch a major offensive. Allenby believed his new assignment to be a joke, because he still believed that the war would be decided on the Western Front.

Although many of the War Cabinet wanted more efforts on the Palestine Front, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff (CIGS), General Sir William Robertson, believed that Western Front commitments did not justify a serious attempt to capture Jerusalem (Third Ypres was in progress from 31 July until November), and throughout 1917 he put pressure on Allenby to demand unrealistically large reinforcements to discourage the politicians from authorising Middle East offensives.

====Palestine campaign====
Allenby arrived on 27 June 1917. On 31 July 1917, he received a telegram from his wife saying that Michael Allenby had been killed in action, leading to Allenby&#x27;s breaking down in tears in public while he recited a poem by Rupert Brooke. Afterwards, Allenby kept his grief to himself and his wife, and instead threw himself into his work with icy determination, working very long hours without a break. Wavell recalled: &quot;He went on with his work and asked no sympathy. Only those who stood close to him knew how heavy the blow had been, how nearly it had broken him, and what courage it had taken to withstand it&quot;. Allenby assessed the Turkish Army&#x27;s fighting force that he was facing to be 46,000 rifles and 2,800 sabres, and estimated that he could take Jerusalem with 7 infantry and 3 cavalry divisions. He did not feel that there was a sufficient military case to do so, and felt that he would need reinforcements to advance further. Allenby understood the problems posed by logistics in the desert and spent much time working to ensure his soldiers would be well supplied at all times, especially with water. The logistics of getting water to the soldiers and through the desert is thought to be the biggest challenge and accomplishment Allenby made in the Middle East campaign. Allenby also saw the importance of good medical treatment and insisted that proper medical facilities be created to treat all of the diseases common to the Middle East like ophthalmia and enteric fever. Allenby was eventually ordered to attack the Turks in southern Palestine, but the extent of his advance was not yet to be decided, advice which Robertson repeated in &quot;secret and personal&quot; notes (1 and 10 August).

Allenby quickly won the respect of his troops by making frequent visits to the EEF&#x27;s front-line units, in a marked change from the leadership style of his predecessor Murray, who had commanded primarily from Cairo. Allenby moved the EEF&#x27;s GHQ from the Egyptian capital city to Rafah, nearer to the front lines at Gaza, and re-organized the disparate forces of the EEF into a three primary corps order of battle: XX, XXI, and the Desert Mounted Corps. He also approved the utilisation of Arabic irregular forces which were operating at that time to the Turkish Army&#x27;s open left flank in the Arabian interior, under the direction of a young British Army intelligence officer named T. E. Lawrence. He sanctioned £200,000 a month for Lawrence to facilitate his work amongst the tribes involved.

In early October 1917, Robertson asked Allenby to state his extra troop requirements to advance from the Gaza–Beersheba line (30 miles wide) to the Jaffa–Jerusalem line (50 miles wide), urging him to take no chances in estimating the threat of a German-reinforced threat. Allenby&#x27;s estimate was that he would need 13 extra divisions (an impossible demand even if Haig&#x27;s forces went on the defensive on the Western Front) and that he might face 18 Turkish and 2 German divisions. Yet, in private letters, Allenby and Robertson agreed that sufficient British Empire troops were already in place to take and hold Jerusalem.

Having reorganised his regular forces, Allenby won the Third Battle of Gaza (31 October – 7 November 1917) by surprising the defenders with an attack at Beersheba. The first step in capturing Beersheba was to send out false radio messages prompting the Turkish forces to think Britain was going to attack Gaza. After that, an intelligence officer, by the name of Colonel Richard Meinertzhagen, rode right up to the Turkish line, barely evading capture. In the fray, he dropped a bloodstained bag, smeared with horse blood, with fake military plans in it. The plans falsely described how the British force was on its way to capture Gaza. Additional radio messages threatening Meinertzhagen made up the Turkish Army&#x27;s mind: the British Army was going to attack Gaza. Instead, they went through with the capture of Beersheba. &quot;The Turks at Beersheba were undoubtedly taken completely by surprise, a surprise from which the dash of London troops and Yeomanry, finely supported by their artillery, never gave them time to recover. The charge of the Australian Light Horse completed their defeat&quot; – Allenby His force captured the water supply there, and was able to push onward through the desert. His force pushed northwards towards Jerusalem. &quot;Favoured by a continuance of fine weather, preparation for a fresh advance against the Turkish positions... of Jerusalem proceeded rapidly&quot; – Allenby The Ottomans were beaten at Junction Station (10–14 November), and retreated out of Jerusalem, which was on 9 December 1917. During the Palestine campaign, Allenby entered a bacteriological laboratory near Ludd, where he saw some charts on the wall. When he asked about their meanings, he was told that they were of the seasonal incidence of malignant malaria in the Plain of Sharon, then he replied:

==== The capture of Jerusalem ====
Allenby&#x27;s official proclamation of martial law following the fall of Jerusalem on 9 December 1917 read as follows:

 Allenby received Christian, Jewish and Muslim community leaders in Jerusalem and worked with them to ensure that religious sites of all three faiths were respected. Allenby sent his Indian Muslim soldiers to guard Islamic religious sites, feeling that this was the best way of reaching out to the Muslim population of Jerusalem.
Allenby dismounted and entered the city on foot through the Jaffa Gate, together with his officers, in deliberate contrast to the perceived arrogance of the Kaiser&#x27;s entry into Jerusalem on horseback in 1898, which had not been well received by the local citizens. He did this out of respect for the status of Jerusalem as the Holy City important to Judaism, Christianity, and Islam (see his proclamation of martial law above). The people of Jerusalem saw Allenby&#x27;s entrance on foot as a sign of his modesty.
He subsequently stated in his official report:

&quot;[The citizens of Jerusalem were] at first welcoming because they were glad the Ottomans were gone and they wanted a good relationship with the British. [They were] also cautious as they did not want the British to stay.&quot;

The British press printed cartoons of Richard Coeur de Lion – who had himself failed to capture Jerusalem – looking down on the city from the heavens with the caption reading, &quot;The last Crusade. My dream comes true!&quot; The crusade imagery was used to describe the campaign by the British press and later by the British Ministry of Information. There were reports that on entering the city Allenby had remarked &quot;only now have the crusades ended.&quot; However, mindful of the Pan-Islamic propaganda of the Ottomans who had proclaimed a &quot;jihad&quot; against the Allies in 1914, Allenby himself discouraged the use of the crusader imagery, banned his press officers from using the terms &quot;crusade&quot; and &quot;crusader&quot; in their press releases and always went out of his way to insist that he was fighting merely the Ottoman Empire, not Islam. Allenby stated that &quot;The importance of Jerusalem lay in its strategic importance, there was no religious impulse in this campaign&quot;.

In May 1918, Allenby publicly met with Chaim Weizmann and the Chief Rabbi of Jerusalem in Jerusalem. 

==== Defeat of the Ottoman Empire ====
Asked again after the Fall of Jerusalem, Allenby wrote that he could complete the conquest of Palestine with his existing forces, but would need 16–18 divisions, on top of the 8–10 he already had, for a further advance of 250 miles to the Damascus–Beirut Line and then to Aleppo to cut Turkish communications to Mesopotamia (where by early 1918, 50,000 Turks were tying down a British Empire ration strength of over 400,000, of whom almost half were non-combatants, and 117,471 were British troops).

Smuts was sent to Egypt to confer with Allenby and Marshall (C-in-C Mesopotamia), with Robertson&#x27;s clash with the government now moving to its final stages, and the new Supreme War Council at Versailles drawing up plans for more efforts in the Middle East. Allenby told Smuts of Robertson&#x27;s private instructions (sent by hand of Walter Kirke, appointed by Robertson as Smuts&#x27; adviser) that there was no merit in any further advance. Allenby worked with Smuts to draw up plans to reach Haifa by June and Damascus by the autumn, reinforced by 3 divisions from Mesopotamia. The speed of the advance was limited by the need to lay fresh rail track. This met with War Cabinet approval (6 March 1918).

The German spring offensive on the Western Front meant that Allenby was without reinforcements after his forces failed to capture Amman in March and April 1918. He halted the offensive in the spring of 1918 and had to send 60,000 men to the Western Front, although the Dominion Prime Ministers in the Imperial War Cabinet continued to demand a strong commitment to the Middle East in case Germany could not be beaten.

New troops from the British Empire (specifically Australia, New Zealand, India, and South Africa) led to the resumption of operations in August 1918. Following an extended series of deceptive moves, the Ottoman line was broken at the Battle of Megiddo (19–21 September 1918), and the Allied cavalry passed through and blocked the Turkish retreat. The EEF then advanced at an impressive rate, as high as 60 miles in 55 hours for cavalry, and infantry slogging 20 miles a day and encountering minimal resistance. Damascus fell on 1 October, Homs on 16 October, and Aleppo on 25 October. With the threat of Asia Minor being invaded, the Ottoman Empire capitulated on 30 October 1918 with the signing of the Armistice of Mudros.

==Governor of Egypt==

Allenby was made a field marshal on 31 July 1919, and created Viscount Allenby, of Megiddo and of Felixstowe in the County of Suffolk, on 7 October.

His appointment in 1919 as Special High Commissioner of Egypt came as the country was being disrupted by demonstrations against British rule. It had been under Martial Law since 1914 and several Egyptian leaders, including Saad Zaghlul, had been exiled to Malta.

These deportations had led to rioting across the country, with Cairo isolated. Allenby&#x27;s first response was conciliatory. He persuaded the Colonial Office to allow Zaghlul and his delegation, from the Wafd, to travel to France. Their intention was to present the Egyptian case to the Paris Peace Conference but they received no official recognition and returned to Egypt in failure.

As a General, Allenby played a prominent role in helping Britain counter the 1919 Egyptian revolution. However, as High Commissioner of Egypt, Allenby favored negotiations with Egypt. Soon after the 1919 uprising, the Milner Mission was initiated.

In early 1921 there were more riots and demonstrations that were blamed on Zaghlul. This time Allenby ordered that Zaghlul and five other leaders be deported to the Seychelles. Sixteen rioters were executed. The following year Allenby travelled to London with proposals which he insisted be implemented. They included the end of Martial Law, the drafting of an Egyptian Constitution and the return of Zaghlul. Progress was made: Egypt was granted limited self-government, and a draft constitution was published in October 1922 leading to the formation of a Zaghlul government in January 1924. The following November the commander of British forces in Egypt and Sudan, Sir Lee Stack, was assassinated in Cairo. Allenby&#x27;s response was draconian and included a humiliating £500,000 fine to be paid by the Egyptian Government. In May 1925, Allenby resigned and returned to England.

==Retirement==
Allenby was appointed Honorary Colonel of the Cinque Ports Fortress Royal Engineers on 12 September 1925 and made Captain of Deal Castle.

Murray and Allenby were invited to give lectures at Aldershot in 1931 about the Palestine campaign. Exchanging letters beforehand, Murray asked whether it had been worth risking the Western Front (in the autumn of 1917) to transfer troops to Palestine. Allenby avoided that question, but commented that in 1917 and into the spring of 1918 it had been far from clear that the Allies were going to win the war. The Armistice between Russia and the Central Powers of December 1917 had effectively taken Russia out of the war, but the Americans, who had entered the war in April 1917, were not yet present in strength. France and Italy were weakened and might have been persuaded to make peace, perhaps by Germany giving up Belgium or Alsace-Lorraine, or Austria-Hungary giving up the Trentino. In those circumstances, the Central Powers were likely to be left in control of Eastern Europe and the Balkans, and it had been sensible for Britain to grab some land in the Middle East to block Germany&#x27;s route to India. Allenby&#x27;s views mirrored those of the War Cabinet at the time.

Allenby went to Patagonia for a last fishing trip, aged 74, to see if the salmon really were as large as those in the River Tay.

In 1917 while serving in Egypt, Allenby formed a life-long friendship with Lieutenant Colonel Sir Herbert Lightfoot Eason, with Eason later describing Allenby as the greatest man he ever met in his long life of many distinguished contacts.

==Death==
He died suddenly from a ruptured cerebral aneurysm on 14 May 1936 at his house in Kensington, London, at the age of 75 years. His body was cremated, and his ashes were buried in Westminster Abbey.

==Family==
In 1897, Allenby married Miss Adelaide Chapman (d. 1942), the daughter of a Wiltshire landowner. Their only child, Lieutenant Horace Michael Hynman Allenby, MC (1898–1917), was killed in action at Koksijde in Flanders whilst serving with the Royal Horse Artillery. The personal inscription on his gravestone reads: . This is a quotation from &quot;When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom&#x27;d&quot; by American poet Walt Whitman.

On Allenby&#x27;s death, leaving no direct issue, his peerage and seat in the House of Lords passed by a special remainder to his nephew Dudley Allenby, son of Captain Frederick Allenby, who became the 2nd Viscount.

==Tributes==

Allenby supposedly once said that people would have to visit a war museum to learn of him, but that T. E. Lawrence would be remembered and become a household name. This was quoted by Robert Bolt in his screenplay for the 1962 film &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;, directed by David Lean. A blue plaque unveiled in 1960 commemorates Allenby at 24 Wetherby Gardens, South Kensington, London.

Publicity surrounding Allenby&#x27;s exploits in the Middle East was at its highest in Britain in the immediate aftermath of the First World War.
Allenby enjoyed a period of celebrity in the United States, as well. He and his wife went on an American tour in 1928, receiving a standing ovation when he addressed Carnegie Hall in New York City. Biographer Raymond Savage claimed that, for a time, Allenby was better known in America than Lawrence.

Allenby was the subject of a 1923 documentary film by British Instructional Films entitled &quot;Armageddon&quot;, detailing his military leadership during World War I. However, the film is believed lost.

The epic film &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; depicts the Arab Revolt during World War I. Allenby is given a major part in it and is portrayed by Jack Hawkins in one of his best-known roles. Screenwriter Bolt called Allenby a &quot;very considerable man&quot; and hoped to depict him sympathetically. Nonetheless, many view Allenby&#x27;s portrayal as negative.

The efforts of T. E. Lawrence (&quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;) were greatly aided by Allenby in the Arab Revolt, and he thought highly of Allenby: &quot;(He was) physically large and confident, and morally so great that the comprehension of our littleness came slow to him&quot;.

Into the 1990s, residents of Ismaïlia in north-eastern Egypt burned effigies to mark an annual spring holiday, including one of Allenby more than 70 years after he led forces in the Sinai.

The British journalist Mark Urban has argued that Allenby is one of the most important British generals who ever lived, writing that Allenby&#x27;s use of air power, mechanised forces and irregulars led by Lawrence marked one of the first attempts at a new type of war while at the same time he had to act as a politician holding together a force comprising men from many nations, making him &quot;the first of the modern supreme commanders&quot;. Urban further argued during the war, the British government had made all sorts of plans for the Middle East such as the Sykes–Picot Agreement in 1916 and the Balfour Declaration of 1917, but as long as the Ottoman Empire continued to hold much of the Near East, these plans meant nothing. By defeating the Ottomans in 1917–18, Allenby, if he did not create the modern Middle East, at the very least made the creation of the modern Middle East possible. If the Ottoman Empire had continued in its pre-war frontiers after the war—and before Allenby arrived in Egypt the British had not advanced very far—then it is probable that the nations of Israel, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon and Iraq would not exist today.

<text>The bağlama or saz/ساز is a family of plucked string instruments and long-necked lutes used in Azerbaijan, Iran, and Turkey. It is commonly used by the ashiks. 
==Name==
According to &quot;The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot;, &quot;the terms &#x27;bağlama&#x27; and &#x27;saz&#x27; are used somewhat interchangeably in Turkey. &#x27;Saz&#x27; is generally used interchangeably with &#x27;enstrüman&#x27; (instrument) and it is used to refer single or group of musical instruments like &#x27;üflemeli sazlar&#x27; (wind instruments).

==Bağlama scale==
The musical scale of the bağlama differs from that of many western instruments – such as the guitar – in that it features ratios that are close to quarter tones. The traditional ratios for bağlama frets are listed by Yalçın Tura:

*Fret 1: 18/17
*Fret 2: 12/11
*Fret 3: 9/8
*Fret 4: 81/68
*Fret 5: 27/22
*Fret 6: 81/64
*Fret 7: 4/3
*Fret 8: 24/17
*Fret 9: 16/11
*Fret 10: 3/2
*Fret 11: 27/17
*Fret 12: 18/11
*Fret 13: 27/16
*Fret 14: 16/9
*Fret 15: 32/17
*Fret 16: 64/33
*Fret 17: 2/1

However, as confirmed by Okan Öztürk, instrument makers now often set frets on the bağlama with the aid of fret calculators and tuners based on the 24-tone equal temperament.

==Notable performers==

* Aşık Veysel (1894–1973)
* Muharrem Ertaş (1913–1984)
* Neşet Ertaş (1938–2012)
* Musa Eroğlu (1945–)
* Orhan Gencebay
* Arif Sağ (1946–)
* Nida Tüfekçi
* Orhan Ölmez
* Aşık Mahzuni Şerif (1940–2002)
* Nuray Hafiftaş (1964–2018)

<text>A financial institution, sometimes called a banking institution, is a business entity that provides service as an intermediary for different types of financial monetary transactions. Broadly speaking, there are three major types of financial institution:

# Depository institution – deposit-taking institution that accepts and manages deposits and makes loans, including bank, building society, credit union, trust company, and mortgage broker;
# Contractual institution – insurance company and pension fund
# Investment institution – investment bank, underwriter, and other different types of financial entities managing investments.

Financial institutions can be distinguished broadly into two categories according to ownership structure:
* commercial bank
* cooperative bank

Some experts see a trend toward homogenisation of financial institutions, meaning a tendency to invest in similar areas and have similar business strategies. A consequence of this might be fewer banks serving specific target groups, and small-scale producers may be under-served. This is why a target of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 10 is to improve the regulation and monitoring of global financial institutions and strengthen such regulations.

== Standard settlement instructions ==
Standard Settlement Instructions (SSIs) are the agreements between two financial institutions which fix the receiving agents of each counterparty in ordinary trades of some type. These agreements allow the related counterparties to make faster operations since the time used to settle the receiving agents is conserved. Limiting each subject to an SSI also lowers the likelihood of a fraud. SSIs are used by financial institutions to facilitate fast and accurate cross-border payments.

==Regulation==
Financial institutions in most countries operate in a heavily regulated environment because they are critical parts of countries&#x27; economies, due to economies&#x27; dependence on them to grow the money supply via fractional-reserve banking. Regulatory structures differ in each country, but typically involve prudential regulation as well as consumer protection and market stability. Some countries have one consolidated agency that regulates all financial institutions while others have separate agencies for different types of institutions such as banks, insurance companies and brokers.

Countries that have separate agencies include the United States, where the key governing bodies are the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC), Office of the Comptroller of the Currency – National Banks, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) State &quot;non-member&quot; banks, National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) – Credit Unions, Federal Reserve (Fed) – &quot;member&quot; banks, Office of Thrift Supervision – National Savings &amp; Loan Association, State governments each often regulate and charter financial institutions.

Countries that have one consolidated financial regulator include: Norway with the Financial Supervisory Authority of Norway, Germany with Federal Financial Supervisory Authority and Russia with Central Bank of Russia.

=== Merits ===
Merits of raising funds through financial institutions are as follows:
# Financial institutions provide long term finance, which are not provided by commercial banks;
# The funds are made available even during periods of depression, when other sources of finance are not available;
# Obtaining loan from financial institutions increases the goodwill of the borrowing in the capital market . Consequently, such a company can raise funds easily from other sources as well;
# Besides providing funds, many of these institutions provide financial, managerial and technical advice and consultancy to business firms;
# As repayment of loan can be made in easy installments, it does not prove to be much of burden on the business.

<doc id="208837" wikidata="Q322675" url="?curid=208837" title="Bouzouki">
<text>The bouzouki (, ; ; &quot;bouzoukia&quot;, , from Greek , from Turkish ) is a musical instrument popular in the West Asia (Syria, Iraq), Europe and Balkans (Greece, North Macedonia, Bulgaria, Turkey). It is a member of the long-necked lute family, with a round body with a flat and a long neck with a fretted fingerboard. It has steel strings and is played with a plectrum producing a sharp metallic sound, reminiscent of a mandolin but pitched lower. It is the precursor to the Irish bouzouki, an instrument derived from the Greek bouzouki that is popular in Celtic, English, and North American folk music. There are 3 main types of Greek bouzouki: the &quot;trichordo&quot; (&quot;three-course&quot;) has three pairs of strings (known as courses) the &quot;tetrachordo&quot; (&quot;four-course&quot;) has four pairs of strings, &amp; then the &quot;pentachordo&quot; (&quot;five-course&quot;) with 5 pairs of strings. The instrument was brought to Greece in the early 1900s by Greek refugees from Anatolia, and quickly became the central instrument to the rebetiko genre and its music branches. It is now an important element of modern Laïko pop Greek music.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;bouzouki&quot; comes from the Turkish word , meaning &quot;broken&quot; or &quot;modified&quot;, and comes from a particular re-entrant tuning called , which was commonly used on its Turkish counterpart, the . It is in the same instrumental family as the mandolin and the lute. Originally the body was carved from a solid block of wood, similar to the saz, but upon its arrival in Greece in the early 1910s it was modified by the addition of a staved back borrowed from the Neapolitan mandola, and the top angled in the manner of a Neapolitan mandolins so as to increase the strength of the body to withstand thicker steel strings. The type of the instrument used in rebetiko music was a three-course instrument with three pairs of strings, but in the 1950s a four-course variety was developed and was made popular by Manolis Chiotis.

== Construction ==
From a construction point of view, the bouzouki can have differences not only in the number of strings but also in other features, e.g. neck length, width, height, depth of the bowl or main body, the width of the staves (the wooden gores or slices of the bowl) etc. These differences are determined by the manufacturer, who in his experience and according to the sound that the instrument should make, modifies his functional elements to achieve a more piercing, deeper or heavier sound.

The size and type of the resonating body largely determine the instrument&#x27;s timbre, while the length of the neck, and by extension the strings, determines the instrument&#x27;s pitch range, as well as influencing the timbre. While neck length can vary from instrument to instrument, most bouzoukis have the same number of frets (27), spaced such as to provide a chromatic scale in 12-tone equal temperament. On modern instruments the frets are metal, and set into a fixed position in the fingerboard (in contrast to early instruments and the related baglama, in which frets were of gut or cord tied onto the neck, and moveable.) The quality of the wood from which the instrument is made is of great importance to the sound. For the construction of the bowl, mulberry, apricot, cherry, acacia, and elm are considered to be the best woods, with walnut, plane, and chestnut being slightly inferior. The wood must be solid and sourced from slow-growth trees. The top or soundboard should be cedar or spruce (preferably spruce) if possible, cut in one piece. The top plays a major role in the sound because it resonates and strengthens and prolongs the vibration of the strings. Another factor that affects the quality of the sound is the varnish and the method of its application. The best varnish is a natural one made of shellac, which is applied by hand in many layers in the traditional way, for both acoustic and visual effects. The neck must be of very dry hardwood in order not to warp and increase the distance of the strings from the fret board (the action height) which makes playing the instrument more laborious. Manufacturers use different techniques to achieve this, each one having its own secrets. Many modern instruments have a metal rod or bar (truss-rod) set into a channel in the neck, under the fingerboard, which adds some weight but increases rigidity, and allows adjustment of the neck should it begin to warp.

==History==

The Greek bouzouki is a plucked musical instrument of the lute family, called the thabouras or tambouras family. The tambouras existed in ancient Greece as the pandura, and can be found in various sizes, shapes, depths of body, lengths of neck and number of strings. The bouzouki and the baglamas are the direct descendants. The Greek marble relief, known as the Mantineia Base (now exhibited at the National Archaeological Museum of Athens), dating from 330–320 BC, shows a muse playing a variant of the pandoura.

From Byzantine times it was called first &quot;pandoura&quot; and then &quot;tambouras&quot;. On display in the National Historical Museum of Greece is the tambouras of a hero of the Greek revolution of 1821, General Makriyiannis.
Other sizes have appeared and include the Greek instrument tzouras, an instrument smaller in size than standard bouzoukia.

The bouzouki arrived in Greece following the 1919–1922 war in Asia Minor and the subsequent population exchange between Greece and Turkey. The early bouzoukia mostly had three courses (six strings in three pairs, known as &quot;trichordo&quot;) and were tuned in different ways, according to the scale one wanted to play. At the end of the 1950s, four-course (tetrachordo) bouzoukia started to gain popularity. The four-course bouzouki was made popular by Manolis Chiotis, who also used a tuning akin to standard guitar tuning, which made it easier for guitarists to play bouzouki; this angered purists, but allowed for greater virtuosity and helped elevate the bouzouki into a truly popular instrument capable of a wide range of musical expression. Recently the three-course bouzouki has gained in popularity. The first recording with the four-course instrument was made in 1956.

The Irish bouzouki, with four courses, a flatter back, and differently tuned from the Greek bouzouki, is a more recent development, stemming from the introduction of the Greek instrument into Irish music by Johnny Moynihan around 1965. It was subsequently adopted by Andy Irvine, Dónal Lunny, and many others, although some Irish musicians, such as the late Alec Finn, continued to use the Greek-style instruments.

==Three-course bouzouki (trichordo)==

This is the classic style of bouzouki, introduced around 1900, that was the mainstay of most rebetiko music. It has fixed frets and 6 strings in three pairs. In the lower-pitched (bass) course, the pair consists of a thick wound string and a thin string, tuned an octave apart. The conventional modern tuning of the &quot;trichordo&quot; bouzouki is D3D4–A3A3–D4D4. This tuning was called the &quot;European tuning&quot; by Markos Vamvakaris, who mentioned (but failed to describe) several other tunings, or &quot;douzenia&quot;, in his autobiography. The illustrated bouzouki was made by Karolos Tsakirian of Athens, and is a replica of a &quot;trichordo&quot; bouzouki made by his grandfather for Markos Vamvakaris. The absence of the heavy mother-of-pearl ornamentation often seen on modern bouzoukia is typical of bouzoukia of the period. It has tuners for eight strings, but has only six strings, the neck being too narrow for eight. The luthiers of the time often used sets of four tuners on trichordo instruments, as these were more easily available, being also used on mandolins.

==Four-course bouzouki (tetrachordo)==
This type of bouzouki has 8 metal strings, which are arranged in 4 pairs, known as courses, typically tuned C3C4–F3F4–A3A3–D4D4 (i.e., one whole step below the four high strings of a guitar). In the two higher-pitched (treble) courses, the two strings of the pair are tuned to the same note. In the two lower-pitched (bass) courses, the pair consists of a thick wound string and a thin string tuned an octave apart. On the bouzouki the lower-pitched string comes first in these courses, the reverse of most other instruments with octave-paired courses (such as the 12-string guitar, charango or bajo sexto). These &#x27;octave strings&#x27; add to the fullness of the sound and are used in chords and bass drones (continuous low notes that are played throughout the music). The guitar-like tuning was introduced by composer and soloist Manolis Hiotis, who found it better suited to the kind of virtuoso playing he was famous for. Today, the tetrachordo is the most common bouzouki used in Greek music, though a few traditionalists still prefer the trichordo, particularly for the older &quot;rebetiko&quot; style of playing.
==Five-course bouzouki (pentachordo)==
This bouzouki has 10 strings arranged in 5 pairs, adding on an Octave G Course tuned G2G3 in addition to the other 8 strings to extend the range so the tuning is G2G3-C3C4–F3F4–A3A3–D4D4 (a whole step below the 5 high strings of a guitar) which allows for extended Chords &amp; versatility, &amp; was popularized by Antonopoulos Giorgos.

==Amplification==
In addition to developing the modern tetrachordo bouzouki, Manolis Hiotis was a pioneer of the use of amplification for the instrument, which he may have been using as early as 1945. However, the earliest documented use of amplification for the bouzouki comes from a 1952 photograph, showing Vasilis Tsitsanis and Yiannis Papaioannou playing bouzoukis, each with an electric guitar-style pick-up attached in the soundhole. There are also numerous photographs between 1953 and 1959 showing bands in which both vocalists and bouzouki players are using microphones for amplification. By 1960 special bouzouki pickups (such as the German &quot;Ideal&quot;) were being produced and permanently mounted in the instruments. Similar pickups are widely used by several Greek artists today and come in active and passive versions.

== Related instruments ==
The Greek baglamas () or baglamadaki () is very different from the Turkish bağlama. It is tuned the same as the trichordo bouzouki but pitched an octave higher (nominally D–A–D), with unison pairs on the four highest strings and an octave pair on the lower D. Musically, the baglamas is most often found supporting the bouzouki in the Piraeus style of rebetiko.

<text>Financial regulation is a broad set of policies that apply to the financial sector in most jurisdictions, justified by two main features of finance: systemic risk, which implies that the failure of financial firms involves public interest considerations; and information asymmetry, which justifies curbs on freedom of contract in selected areas of financial services, particularly those that involve retail clients and/or Principal–agent problems. An integral part of financial regulation is the supervision of designated financial firms and markets by specialized authorities such as securities commissions and bank supervisors. 

In some jurisdictions, certain aspects of financial supervision are delegated to self-regulatory organizations. Financial regulation forms one of three legal categories which constitutes the content of financial law, the other two being market practices and case law.

==History==

In the early modern period, the Dutch were the pioneers in financial regulation. The first recorded ban (regulation) on short selling was enacted by the Dutch authorities as early as 1610.

==Aims of regulation==
The objectives of financial regulators are usually:
* market confidence – to maintain confidence in the financial system
* financial stability – contributing to the protection and enhancement of stability of the financial system
* consumer protection – securing the appropriate degree of protection for consumers.
* reduce financial crime 
* regulate foreign participation

==Structure of supervision==
Acts empower organizations, government or non-government, to monitor activities and enforce actions. There are various setups and combinations in place for the financial regulatory structure around the globe.

===Securities market regulation===

Exchange acts ensure that trading on the floor of exchanges is conducted in a proper manner. Most prominent the pricing process, execution and settlement of trades, direct and efficient trade monitoring.

Financial regulators ensure that listed companies and market participants comply with various regulations under the trading acts. The trading acts demands that listed companies publish regular financial reports, ad hoc notifications or directors&#x27; dealings. Whereas market participants are required to publish major shareholder notifications. The objective of monitoring compliance by listed companies with their disclosure requirements is to ensure that investors have access to essential and adequate information for making an informed assessment of listed companies and their securities.

Asset management supervision or investment acts ensures the frictionless operation of those vehicles.

===Supervision of banks and financial services providers===

Banking acts lay down rules for banks which they have to observe when they are being established and when they are carrying on their business. These rules are designed to prevent unwelcome developments that might disrupt the smooth functioning of the banking system. Thus ensuring a strong and efficient banking system.

Besides other requirements, such a business is not permitted to contain in its name words such as &quot;bank&quot;, &quot;insurance&quot;, &quot;national&quot;, etc, unless it holds an appropriate license. Depending on banking regulations, jurisdictions may offer different types of banking licenses, such as:

* full banking licenses for general banking activities, such as taking deposits from the general public
* international banking licenses (offshore banking licenses), which prohibits any local business activities 
* non-banking financial institution (NBFI) is an institution that provides financial services but has to comply with fewer regulations than one with a full banking license.

== License issuance ==
Licenses are typically issued by a national banking regulator to applicant corporations that meet its banking requirements. The requirements may include minimum capital requirements, minimum number of directors, residence of shareholders, spread of shareholdings, disclosure of beneficial shareholders, besides other matters. These requirements may differ between jurisdictions, and may differ depending on the type of license being sought. Some jurisdictions, sometimes called tax havens, have a reputation for lax or corrupt standards in bank licensing, granting a license, for example, to shell companies, or to companies with nominee directors, or with dummy shareholders, etc.

The granting of the license may involve a complex and expensive procedure which may depend on the type of bank license being sought. There are a number of sectors in which banks may be involved. The general bank license allows a bank to engage in all banking activities, such as retail banking, merchant acquiring, cash management, asset management and trading. An applicant can apply for a limited banking license, such as an offshore banking license.

== Banking licenses in the United States ==

Most state legislatures in the United States ban general corporations from accepting banker&#x27;s deposits, which covers any service where a general corporation acts as a funds drawee that transfers current funds (i.e., credit payable upon demand) to make payments as a substitute for coins on behalf of an account holder. Historically, in some states, this ban did not extend to a sole proprietor acting as a banker.

One argument for justifying the policy of requiring banking licenses under the U.S. Constitution is that bankers credit sometimes interferes with the regulation of the value of coins, and therefore it is necessary and proper to make laws which regulate banking.

U.S. states tend to include a license to conduct the banking business as part of the standard terms of the corporate franchise in the state bank charters of incorporation. The license may be implied by a reference in the charter application to the bank being created &quot;under&quot; the state banking law. Federal depository institutions such as National Banks, or federally chartered credit unions derive their authority from federal statutory charter law. Opening or operating a bank also requires regulatory compliance, which may include Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) approval for coverage and opening an account at a Federal Reserve Bank (or otherwise establishing a facility to settle checks via settlement with Federal Reserve Bank issued credit).

If a bank wishes to perform any substantial fiduciary services, such as trust department services, or acting as a securities holding intermediary, then the bank must apply for an additional special license for trust powers. Depending on the specifics of the bank charter, these licenses are available variously from FDIC, Federal Reserve Board of Governors, or state regulators. Another option for such a bank is to create a State-chartered Trust Company and hold it as a subsidiary corporation.

<text>Shearwaters are medium-sized long-winged seabirds in the petrel family Procellariidae. They have a global marine distribution, but are most common in temperate and cold waters, and are pelagic outside the breeding season.

==Description==
These tubenose birds fly with stiff wings and use a &quot;shearing&quot; flight technique (flying very close to the water and seemingly cutting or &quot;shearing&quot; the tips of waves) to move across wave fronts with the minimum of active flight. This technique gives the group its English name. Some small species, like the Manx shearwater are cruciform in flight, with their long wings held directly out from their bodies.

==Behaviour==
===Movements===
Many shearwaters are long-distance migrants, perhaps most spectacularly sooty shearwaters, which cover distances in excess of from their breeding colonies on the Falkland Islands (52°S 60°W) to as far as 70° north latitude in the North Atlantic Ocean off northern Norway, and around New Zealand to as far as 60° north latitude in the North Pacific Ocean off Alaska. A 2006 study found individual tagged sooty shearwaters from New Zealand migrating a year, which gave them the then longest known animal migration ever recorded electronically (though subsequently greatly exceeded by a tagged arctic tern migrating ). Short-tailed shearwaters perform an even longer &quot;figure of eight&quot; loop migration in the Pacific Ocean from Tasmania to as far north as the Arctic Ocean off northwest Alaska. They are also long-lived: a Manx shearwater breeding on Copeland Island, Northern Ireland, was (as of 2003/2004) the oldest known wild bird in the world; ringed as an adult (when at least 5 years old) in July 1953, it was retrapped in July 2003, at least 55 years old (also now exceeded, by a Laysan albatross). Manx shearwaters migrate over to South America in winter, using waters off southern Brazil and Argentina, so this bird had covered a minimum of on migration alone. 

Following the tracks of the migratory Yelkouan shearwater has revealed that this species never flies overland, even if it means flying an extra 1,000 km. For instance, during their seasonal migration towards the Black Sea they would circumvent the entire Peloponnese instead of crossing over the 6 km Isthmus of Corinth.

===Breeding===
Shearwaters come to islands and coastal cliffs only to breed. They are nocturnal at the colonial breeding sites, preferring moonless nights to minimize predation. They nest in burrows and often give eerie contact calls on their night-time visits. They lay a single white egg. The chicks of some species, notably short-tailed and sooty shearwaters, are subject to harvesting from their nest burrows for food, a practice known as muttonbirding, in Australia and New Zealand.

===Feeding===
They feed on fish, squid, and similar oceanic food. Some will follow fishing boats to take scraps, commonly the sooty shearwater; these species also commonly follow whales to feed on fish disturbed by them. Their primary feeding technique is diving, with some species diving to depths of .

==Taxonomy==
There are about 30 species: a few larger ones in the genera &quot;Calonectris&quot; and &quot;Ardenna&quot; and many smaller ones in &quot;Puffinus&quot;. Recent genomic studies show that Shearwaters form a clade with &quot;Procellaria&quot;, &quot;Bulweria&quot; and &quot;Pseudobulweria&quot;. This arrangement contrasts with earlier conceptions based on mitochondrial DNA sequencing.

<text>Cedaromys (&quot;Cedar mouse&quot;) is an extinct mammal which lived during the Upper Cretaceous, at the same time as many dinosaurs. It was a member of the also extinct order of Multituberculata. It&#x27;s within the suborder of Cimolodonta, and a possible member of the Paracimexomys group.

==Species==
The species &quot;Cedaromys bestia&quot; was originally named &quot;Paracimexomys bestia&quot; in 1991, but later reassigned to &quot;Cedaromys&quot; by Eaton and Cifelli in 2001. Fossils have been found in Albian (late) - Cenomanian (early), (both Upper Cretaceous)-aged strata of the Cedar Mountain Formation in Utah (United States).

Fossils of the species &quot;Cedaromys parvus&quot; (Eaton &amp; Cifelli, 2001) have been found in strata of the same age in the Cedar Mountain Formation. This species is also in the Oklahoma collection. Suggested bodyweight is around 90 g.

<doc id="208850" wikidata="Q7333652" url="?curid=208850" title="Quotient of a formal language">
<text>In mathematics and computer science, the right quotient (or simply quotient) of a language formula_1 with respect to language formula_2 is the language consisting of strings &quot;w&quot; such that &quot;wx&quot; is in formula_1 for some string &quot;x&quot; in Formally:
formula_4

In other words, for all the strings in formula_1 that have a suffix in formula_2, the suffix is removed.

Similarly, the left quotient of formula_1 with respect to formula_2 is the language consisting of strings &quot;w&quot; such that &quot;xw&quot; is in formula_1 for some string &quot;x&quot; in formula_2. Formally:
formula_11

In other words, we take all the strings in formula_1 that have a prefix in formula_2, and remove this prefix.

Note that the operands of formula_14 are in reverse order: the first operand is formula_2 and formula_1 is second.

==Example==

Consider
formula_17
and
formula_18

Now, if we insert a divider into an element of formula_1, the part on the right is in formula_2 only if the divider is placed adjacent to a &quot;b&quot; (in which case &quot;i&quot; ≤ &quot;n&quot; and &quot;j&quot; = &quot;n&quot;) or adjacent to a &quot;c&quot; (in which case &quot;i&quot; = 0 and &quot;j&quot; ≤ &quot;n&quot;). The part on the left, therefore, will be either formula_21 or formula_22; and formula_23 can be written as
formula_24

==Properties==
Some common closure properties of the quotient operation include:

* The quotient of a regular language with any other language is regular.
* The quotient of a context free language with a regular language is context free.
* The quotient of two context free languages can be any recursively enumerable language.
* The quotient of two recursively enumerable languages is recursively enumerable.

These closure properties hold for both left and right quotients.

<doc id="208852" wikidata="Q189539" url="?curid=208852" title="Loan">
<text>In finance, a loan is the tender of money by one party to another with an agreement to pay it back. The recipient, or borrower, incurs a debt and is usually required to pay interest for the use of the money.

The document evidencing the debt (e.g., a promissory note) will normally specify, among other things, the principal amount of money borrowed, the interest rate the lender is charging, and the date of repayment. A loan entails the reallocation of the subject asset(s) for a period of time, between the lender and the borrower.

The interest provides an incentive for the lender to engage in the loan. In a legal loan, each of these obligations and restrictions is enforced by contract, which can also place the borrower under additional restrictions known as loan covenants. Although this article focuses on monetary loans, in practice, any material object might be lent.

Acting as a provider of loans is one of the main activities of financial institutions such as banks and credit card companies. For other institutions, issuing of debt contracts such as bonds is a typical source of funding.

==Types==
===Secured===
A secured loan is a form of debt in which the borrower pledges some asset (i.e., a car, a house) as collateral.

A mortgage loan is a very common type of loan, used by many individuals to purchase residential or commercial property. The lender, usually a financial institution, is given security a lien on the title to the property until the mortgage is paid off in full. In the case of home loans, if the borrower defaults on the loan, the bank would have the legal right to repossess the house and sell it, to recover sums owing to it. Loan modification can avoid defaults.

Similarly, a loan taken out to buy a car may be secured by the car. The duration of the loan is much shorter often corresponding to the useful life of the car. There are two types of auto loans, direct and indirect. In a direct auto loan, a bank lends the money directly to a consumer. In an indirect auto loan, a car dealership (or a connected company) acts as an intermediary between the bank or financial institution and the consumer.

Other forms of secured loans include loans against securities – such as shares, mutual funds, bonds, etc. This particular instrument issues customers a line of credit based on the quality of the securities pledged. Gold loans are issued to customers after evaluating the quantity and quality of gold in the items pledged. Corporate entities can also take out secured lending by pledging the company&#x27;s assets, including the company itself. The interest rates for secured loans are usually lower than those of unsecured loans. Usually, the lending institution employs people (on a roll or on a contract basis) to evaluate the quality of pledged collateral before sanctioning the loan.

===Unsecured===

Unsecured loans are monetary loans that are not secured against the borrower&#x27;s assets. These may be available from financial institutions under many different guises or marketing packages:
* Credit cards
* Personal loans
* Bank overdrafts
* Credit facilities or lines of credit
* Corporate bonds (may be secured or unsecured)
* Peer-to-peer lending

The interest rates applicable to these different forms may vary depending on the lender and the borrower. These may or may not be regulated by law. In the United Kingdom, when applied to individuals, these may come under the Consumer Credit Act 1974.

Interest rates on unsecured loans are nearly always higher than for secured loans because an unsecured lender&#x27;s options for recourse against the borrower in the event of default are severely limited, subjecting the lender to higher risk compared to that encountered for a secured loan. An unsecured lender must sue the borrower, obtain a money judgment for breach of contract, and then pursue execution of the judgment against the borrower&#x27;s unencumbered assets (that is, the ones not already pledged to secured lenders). In insolvency proceedings, secured lenders traditionally have priority over unsecured lenders when a court divides up the borrower&#x27;s assets. Thus, a higher interest rate reflects the additional risk that in the event of insolvency, the debt may be uncollectible.

===Demand===

Demand loans are short-term loans that typically do not have fixed dates for repayment. Instead, demand loans carry a floating interest rate, which varies according to the prime lending rate or other defined contract terms. Demand loans can be &quot;called&quot; for repayment by the lending institution at any time. Demand loans may be unsecured or secured.

===Subsidized===

A subsidized loan is a loan on which the interest is reduced by an explicit or hidden subsidy. In the context of college loans in the United States, it refers to a loan on which no interest is accrued while a student remains enrolled in education.

===Concessional===

A concessional loan, sometimes called a &quot;soft loan&quot;, is granted on terms substantially more generous than market loans either through below-market interest rates, by grace periods, or a combination of both. Such loans may be made by foreign governments to developing countries or may be offered to employees of lending institutions as an employee benefit (sometimes called a &quot;perk&quot;).

==Target markets==
Loans can also be categorized according to whether the debtor is an individual person (consumer) or a business.

===Personal===
Common personal loans include mortgage loans, car loans, home equity lines of credit, credit cards, installment loans, and payday loans. The credit score of the borrower is a major component in underwriting and interest rates (APR) of these loans. The monthly payments of personal loans can be decreased by selecting longer payment terms, but overall interest paid increases as well. A personal loan can be obtained from banks, alternative (non-bank) lenders, online loan providers and private lenders.

===Commercial===
Loans to businesses are similar to the above but also include commercial mortgages and corporate bonds and government guaranteed loans Underwriting is not based upon credit score but rather credit rating.

==Loan payment==
The most typical loan payment type is the fully amortizing payment in which each monthly rate has the same value over time.

The fixed monthly payment &quot;P&quot; for a loan of &quot;L&quot; for &quot;n&quot; months and a monthly interest rate &quot;c&quot; is:

:formula_1

For more information, see monthly amortized loan or mortgage payments.

==Abuses in lending==
Predatory lending is one form of abuse in the granting of loans. It usually involves granting a loan in order to put the borrower in a position that one can gain advantage over them; subprime mortgage-lending and payday-lending are two examples, where the moneylender is not authorized or regulated, the lender could be considered a loan shark.

Usury is a different form of abuse, where the lender charges excessive interest. In different time periods and cultures, the acceptable interest rate has varied, from no interest at all as in the biblical prescript, to unlimited interest rates. Credit card companies in some countries have been accused by consumer organizations of lending at usurious interest rates and making money out of frivolous &quot;extra charges&quot;.

Abuses can also take place in the form of the customer defrauding the lender by borrowing without intending to repay the loan.

==United States taxes==
Most of the basic rules governing how loans are handled for tax purposes in the United States are codified by both Congress (the Internal Revenue Code) and the Treasury Department (Treasury Regulations another set of rules that interpret the Internal Revenue Code).

# A loan is not gross income to the borrower. Since the borrower has the obligation to repay the loan, the borrower has no accession to wealth.
# The lender may not deduct (from own gross income) the amount of the loan. The rationale here is that one asset (the cash) has been converted into a different asset (a promise of repayment). Deductions are not typically available when an outlay serves to create a new or different asset.
# The amount paid to satisfy the loan obligation is not deductible (from own gross income) by the borrower.
# Repayment of the loan is not gross income to the lender. In effect, the promise of repayment is converted back to cash, with no accession to wealth by the lender.
# Interest paid to the lender is included in the lender&#x27;s gross income. Interest paid represents compensation for the use of the lender&#x27;s money or property and thus represents profit or an accession to wealth to the lender. Interest income can be attributed to lenders even if the lender does not charge a minimum amount of interest.
# Interest paid to the lender may be deductible by the borrower. In general, interest paid in connection with the borrower&#x27;s business activity is deductible, while interest paid on personal loans are not deductible. The major exception here is interest paid on a home mortgage.

===Income from discharge of indebtedness===
Although a loan does not start out as income to the borrower, it becomes income to the borrower if the borrower is discharged of indebtedness. Thus, if a debt is discharged, then the borrower essentially has received income equal to the amount of the indebtedness. The Internal Revenue Code lists &quot;Income from Discharge of Indebtedness&quot; in Section 61(a)(12) as a source of gross income.

Example: X owes Y $50,000. If Y discharges the indebtedness, then X no longer owes Y $50,000. For purposes of calculating income, this is treated the same way as if Y gave X $50,000.

For a more detailed description of the &quot;discharge of indebtedness&quot;, look at Section 108 (Cancellation-of-debt income) of the Internal Revenue Code.

<doc id="208860" wikidata="Q844717" url="?curid=208860" title="Spina bifida">
<text>Spina bifida (SB; ; Latin for &#x27;split spine&#x27;) is a birth defect in which there is incomplete closing of the spine and the membranes around the spinal cord during early development in pregnancy. There are three main types: spina bifida occulta, meningocele and myelomeningocele. Meningocele and myelomeningocele may be grouped as spina bifida cystica. The most common location is the lower back, but in rare cases it may be in the middle back or neck.

Occulta has no or only mild signs, which may include a hairy patch, dimple, dark spot or swelling on the back at the site of the gap in the spine. Meningocele typically causes mild problems, with a sac of fluid present at the gap in the spine. Myelomeningocele, also known as open spina bifida, is the most severe form. Problems associated with this form include poor ability to walk, impaired bladder or bowel control, accumulation of fluid in the brain, a tethered spinal cord and latex allergy. Some experts believe such an allergy can be caused by frequent exposure to latex, which is common for people with spina bifida who have shunts and have had many surgeries. Learning problems are relatively uncommon.
Spina bifida is believed to be due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors. After having one child with the condition, or if one of the parents has the condition, there is a 4% chance that the next child will also be affected. Not having enough folate (vitamin B9) in the diet before and during pregnancy also plays a significant role. Other risk factors include certain antiseizure medications, obesity and poorly controlled diabetes. Diagnosis may occur either before or after a child is born. Before birth, if a blood test or amniocentesis finds a high level of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), there is a higher risk of spina bifida. Ultrasound examination may also detect the problem. Medical imaging can confirm the diagnosis after birth. Spina bifida is a type of neural tube defect related to but distinct from other types such as anencephaly and encephalocele.
Most cases of spina bifida can be prevented if the mother gets enough folate before and during pregnancy. Adding folic acid to flour has been found to be effective for most women. Open spina bifida can be surgically closed before or after birth. A shunt may be needed in those with hydrocephalus, and a tethered spinal cord may be surgically repaired. Devices to help with movement such as crutches or wheelchairs may be useful. Urinary catheterization may also be needed.
Rates of other types of spina bifida vary significantly by country, from 0.1 to 5 per 1,000 births. On average, in developed countries, including the United States, it occurs in about 0.4 per 1,000 births. In India, it affects about 1.9 per 1,000 births. Europeans are at higher risk compared to Africans. 
==Types==
===Spina bifida occulta===
 is Latin for &#x27;hidden&#x27;. This is the mildest form of spina bifida.
In occulta, the outer part of some of the vertebrae is not completely closed. The splits in the vertebrae are so small that the spinal cord does not protrude. The skin at the site of the lesion may be normal, or it may have some hair growing from it; there may be a dimple in the skin, or a birthmark. Unlike most other types of neural tube defects, spina bifida occulta is not associated with increased AFP, a common screening tool used to detect neural tube defects in utero. This is because, unlike in most of the other neural tube defects, the dural lining is maintained.

Many people with this type of spina bifida do not even know they have it, as the condition is asymptomatic in most cases.
A systematic review of radiographic research studies found no relationship between spina bifida occulta and back pain. More recent studies not included in the review support the negative findings.

However other studies suggest spina bifida occulta is not always harmless. One study found that among patients with back pain severity is worse if spina bifida occulta is present.

&quot;Incomplete posterior fusion&quot; is not a true spina bifida and is very rarely of neurological significance.

===Meningocele===

A posterior meningocele () or meningeal cyst () is the least common form of spina bifida. In this form, a single developmental defect allows the meninges to herniate between the vertebrae. As the nervous system remains undamaged, individuals with meningocele are unlikely to have long-term health problems, although cases of tethered cord have been reported. Causes of meningocele include teratoma and other tumors of the sacrococcyx and of the presacral space, and Currarino syndrome.

A meningocele may also form through dehiscences in the base of the skull. These may be classified by their localisation as occipital, frontoethmoidal or nasal. Endonasal meningoceles lie at the roof of the nasal cavity and may be mistaken for a nasal polyp. They are treated surgically. Encephalomeningoceles are classified in the same way and also contain brain tissue.

===Myelomeningocele===

Myelomeningocele (MMC), also known as meningomyelocele, is the type of spina bifida that often results in the most severe complications and affects the meninges and nerves. In individuals with myelomeningocele, the unfused portion of the spinal column allows the spinal cord to protrude through an opening. Myelomeningocele occurs in the third week of embryonic development, during neural tube pore closure. MMC is a failure of this to occur completely. The meningeal membranes that cover the spinal cord also protrude through the opening, forming a sac enclosing the spinal elements, such as meninges, cerebrospinal fluid, and parts of the spinal cord and nerve roots. Myelomeningocele is also associated with club foot deformity, and Arnold–Chiari malformation, necessitating a VP shunt placement.

Toxins and conditions associated with MMC formation include: calcium-channel blockers, carbamazepine, cytochalasins, hyperthermia, and valproic acid.

====Myelocele====
Spina bifida with myelocele is the most severe form of myelomeningocele. In this type, the involved area is represented by a flattened, plate-like mass of nervous tissue with no overlying membrane. The exposure of these nerves and tissues make the baby more prone to life-threatening infections such as meningitis.

The protruding portion of the spinal cord and the nerves that originate at that level of the cord are damaged or not properly developed. As a result, there is usually some degree of paralysis and loss of sensation below the level of the spinal cord defect. Thus, the more cranial the level of the defect, the more severe the associated nerve dysfunction and resultant paralysis may be. Symptoms may include ambulatory problems, loss of sensation, deformities of the hips, knees or feet, and loss of muscle tone.

==Signs and symptoms==

===Physical problems===
Physical signs of spina bifida may include:
* Leg weakness and paralysis
* Orthopedic abnormalities (i.e., club foot, hip dislocation, scoliosis)
* Bladder and bowel control problems, including incontinence, urinary tract infections, and poor kidney function
* Pressure sores and skin irritations
* Abnormal eye movement

68% of children with spina bifida have an allergy to latex, ranging from mild to life-threatening. The common use of latex in medical facilities makes this a particularly serious concern. The most common approach to avoid developing an allergy is to avoid contact with latex-containing products such as examination gloves and catheters that do not specify they are latex-free, and many other products, such as some commonly used by dentists.

The spinal cord lesion or the scarring due to surgery may result in a tethered spinal cord. In some individuals, this causes significant traction and stress on the spinal cord and can lead to a worsening of associated paralysis, scoliosis, back pain, and worsening bowel and/or bladder function.

===Neurological problems===
Many individuals with spina bifida have an associated abnormality of the cerebellum, called the Arnold Chiari II malformation. In affected individuals, the back portion of the brain is displaced from the back of the skull down into the upper neck. In about 90% of the people with myelomeningocele, hydrocephalus also occurs because the displaced cerebellum interferes with the normal flow of cerebrospinal fluid, causing an excess of the fluid to accumulate. In fact, the cerebellum also tends to be smaller in individuals with spina bifida, especially for those with higher lesion levels.

The corpus callosum is abnormally developed in 70–90% of individuals with spina bifida myelomeningocele; this affects the communication processes between the left and right brain hemispheres. Further, white matter tracts connecting posterior brain regions with anterior regions appear less organized. White matter tracts between frontal regions have also been found to be impaired.

Cortex abnormalities may also be present. For example, frontal regions of the brain tend to be thicker than expected, while posterior and parietal regions are thinner. Thinner sections of the brain are also associated with increased cortical folding. Neurons within the cortex may also be displaced.

====Executive function====
Several studies have demonstrated difficulties with executive functions in youth with spina bifida, with greater deficits observed in youth with shunted hydrocephalus. Unlike typically developing children, youths with spina bifida do not tend to improve in their executive functioning as they grow older. Specific areas of difficulty in some individuals include planning, organizing, initiating, and working memory. Problem-solving, abstraction, and visual planning may also be impaired. Further, children with spina bifida may have poor cognitive flexibility. Although executive functions are often attributed to the frontal lobes of the brain, individuals with spina bifida have intact frontal lobes; therefore, other areas of the brain may be implicated.

Individuals with spina bifida, especially those with shunted hydrocephalus, often have attention problems. Children with spina bifida and shunted hydrocephalus have higher rates of ADHD than children without those conditions (31% vs. 17%). Deficits have been observed for selective attention and focused attention, although poor motor speed may contribute to poor scores on tests of attention. Attention deficits may be evident at a very early age, as infants with spina bifida lag behind their peers in orienting to faces.

====Academic skills====
Individuals with spina bifida may struggle academically, especially in the subjects of mathematics and reading. In one study, 60% of children with spina bifida were diagnosed with a learning disability. In addition to brain abnormalities directly related to various academic skills, achievement is likely affected by impaired attentional control and executive functioning. Children with spina bifida may perform well in elementary school, but begin to struggle as academic demands increase.

Children with spina bifida are more likely than their peers without spina bifida to be dyscalculic. Individuals with spina bifida have demonstrated stable difficulties with arithmetic accuracy and speed, mathematical problem-solving, and general use and understanding of numbers in everyday life. Mathematics difficulties may be directly related to the thinning of the parietal lobes (regions implicated in mathematical functioning) and indirectly associated with deformities of the cerebellum and midbrain that affect other functions involved in mathematical skills. Further, higher numbers of shunt revisions are associated with poorer mathematics abilities. Working memory and inhibitory control deficiencies have been implicated for math difficulties, although visual-spatial difficulties are not likely involved. Early intervention to address mathematics difficulties and associated executive functions is crucial.

Individuals with spina bifida tend to have better reading skills than mathematics skills. Children and adults with spina bifida have stronger abilities in reading accuracy than in reading comprehension. Comprehension may be especially impaired for text that requires an abstract synthesis of information rather than a more literal understanding. Individuals with spina bifida may have difficulty with writing due to deficits in fine motor control and working memory.

==Cause==
Spina bifida is believed to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. The genetic component is estimated at 60–70%, but few causative genes have been identified, despite much information gathered from mouse models. After having one child with the condition, or if a parent has the condition, there is a 4% chance the next child will also be affected. A folic acid deficiency during pregnancy also plays a significant role. Other risk factors include certain antiseizure medications, obesity, and poorly managed diabetes. Alcohol misuse can trigger macrocytosis which discards folate. After stopping the drinking of alcohol, a time period of months is needed to rejuvenate bone marrow and recover from the macrocytosis.

Certain mutations in the gene &quot;VANGL1&quot; have been linked with spina bifida in some families with a history of the condition.

==Pathophysiology==
Spina bifida occurs when local regions of the neural tube fail to fuse or there is failure in formation of the vertebral neural arches. Neural arch formation occurs in the first month of embryonic development (often before the mother knows she is pregnant). Some forms are known to occur with primary conditions that cause raised central nervous system pressure, raising the possibility of a dual pathogenesis.

In normal circumstances, the closure of the neural tube occurs around the 23rd (rostral closure) and 27th (caudal closure) day after fertilization. However, if something interferes and the tube fails to close properly, a neural tube defect will occur.

Maternal diabetes, anti-seizure medication use, obesity are known risk factors for the development of spina bifida.

Extensive evidence from mouse strains with spina bifida indicates that there is sometimes a genetic basis for the condition. Human spina bifida likely results from the interaction of multiple genes and environmental factors.

Research has shown the lack of folic acid (folate) is a contributing factor in the pathogenesis of neural tube defects, including spina bifida. Supplementation of the mother&#x27;s diet with folate can reduce the incidence of neural tube defects by about 70%, and can also decrease the severity of these defects when they occur. It is unknown how or why folic acid has this effect.

Spina bifida does not follow direct patterns of heredity as do muscular dystrophy or haemophilia. Studies show a woman having had one child with a neural tube defect such as spina bifida has about a 3% risk of having another affected child. This risk can be reduced with folic acid supplementation before pregnancy.

==Prevention==
There is neither a single cause of spina bifida nor any known way to prevent it entirely. However, dietary supplementation with folic acid has been shown to be helpful in reducing the incidence of spina bifida. Folate supplementation prior to conception has been found to reduce the risk of neural tube defects, including spina bifida, by 70%. Sources of folic acid include whole grains, fortified breakfast cereals, dried beans, leaf vegetables and fruits. However it is difficult for women to get the recommended 400 micrograms of folic acid a day from unfortified foods. Globally, fortified wheat flour and other cereal grains are credited with preventing 50,000–61,000 neural tube birth defects such as spina bifida yearly, which is estimated to be 22% of total possible preventable neural tube defects assuming universal and worldwide folic acid fortification. Many countries in Africa, Asia, and Europe have yet to implement fortification
Folate fortification of enriched grain products has been mandatory in the United States since 1998. This prevents an estimated 600 to 700 incidents of spina bifida a year in the U.S. and saves $400–600 million in healthcare expenses. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Public Health Agency of Canada and the UK Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) recommended amount of folic acid for women of childbearing age and women planning to become pregnant is at least 0.4 mg/day of folic acid from at least three months before conception, and continued for the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends all people who may become pregnant or are attempting pregnancy take a folic acid supplement containing 0.4–0.8 mg (400–800 mcg) of folic acid daily. Women who have already had a baby with spina bifida or other type of neural tube defect, or are taking anticonvulsant medication, should take a higher dose of 4–5 mg/day. However, the daily requirement of folate and the recommended folate blood levels to prevent neural tube defects are not well established.

==Screening==
Tests are not 100% perfect, so even though screening results present negative, there is still a slight chance that spina bifida is present.

Spina bifida can usually be detected during the second trimester of pregnancy by fetal ultrasound. Increased levels of maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP) should be followed up by two tests – an ultrasound of the fetal spine and amniocentesis of the mother&#x27;s amniotic fluid (to test for alpha-fetoprotein and acetylcholinesterase). AFP tests are now mandated by some state laws (including California) and failure to provide them can have legal ramifications. Spina bifida may be associated with other malformations as in dysmorphic syndromes, often resulting in spontaneous miscarriage. In the majority of cases, though, spina bifida is an isolated malformation.

Risks of amniocentesis, which may occur in approximately 1 in 900 tests, include leaking amniotic fluid, though this generally has no effect on pregnancy. However, second-trimester amniocentesis carries a slight risk of miscarriage of 0.1% to 0.3% when done by a skilled person using ultrasound, though research suggests that the risk of miscarriage is higher for amniocentesis done before 15 weeks of pregnancy. Infection transmission may occur from mother to child if the mother has infections such as hepatitis C, toxoplasmosis, or HIV/AIDS, or Rh sensitization, which ultimately damages the fetus&#x27; red blood cells. Needle injury to the fetus may occur, though serious injury is very rare, along with triggering a uterine infection, which is also very rare.

Genetic counseling and further genetic testing through amniocentesis may be offered during the pregnancy, as some neural tube defects are associated with genetic disorders such as trisomy 18. Ultrasound screening for spina bifida is partly responsible for the decline in new cases, because many pregnancies are terminated out of fear that a newborn might have a poor future quality of life. With modern medical care, the quality of life of patients has greatly improved.

==Treatment==
There is no known cure for the nerve damage caused by spina bifida. Standard treatment is surgery after delivery. This surgery aims to prevent further damage of the nervous tissue and to prevent infection; pediatric neurosurgeons operate to close the opening on the back. The spinal cord and its nerve roots are put back inside the spine and covered with meninges. In addition, a shunt may be surgically installed to provide a continuous drain for the excess cerebrospinal fluid produced in the brain, as happens with hydrocephalus. Shunts most commonly drain into the abdomen or chest wall.

===Pregnancy===
Standard treatment is after delivery. There is tentative evidence about treatment for severe disease before delivery while the baby is inside the womb. As of 2014, however, the evidence remains insufficient to determine benefits and harms.

Treatment of spina bifida during pregnancy is not without risk. To the mother, this includes scarring of the uterus. To the baby, there is the risk of preterm birth.

Broadly, there are two forms of prenatal treatment. The first is open fetal surgery, where the uterus is opened and the spina bifida repair performed. The second is via fetoscopy. These techniques may be an option to standard therapy.

===Childhood===
Most individuals with myelomeningocele will need periodic evaluations by a variety of specialists:
* Physiatrists coordinate the rehabilitation efforts of different therapists and prescribe specific therapies, adaptive equipment, or medications to encourage as high of a functional performance within the community as possible.
* Orthopedists monitor growth and development of bones, muscles, and joints.
* Neurosurgeons perform surgeries at birth and manage complications associated with tethered cord and hydrocephalus.
* Neurologists treat and evaluate nervous system issues, such as seizure disorders.
* Urologists to address kidney, bladder, and bowel dysfunction – many will need to manage their urinary systems with a program of catheterization. Bowel management programs aimed at improving elimination are also designed.
* Colorectal specialists help restore bowel and urinary control and function. 
* Ophthalmologists evaluate and treat complications of the eyes.
* Orthotists design and customize various types of assistive technology, including braces, crutches, walkers, and wheelchairs to aid in mobility. As a general rule, the higher the level of the spina bifida defect, the more severe the paralysis, but paralysis does not always occur. Thus, those with low levels may need only short leg braces, whereas those with higher levels do best with a wheelchair, and some may be able to walk unaided.
* Physical therapists, occupational therapists, psychologists, and speech/language pathologists aid in rehabilitative therapies and increase independent living skills.

===Transition to adulthood===

Although many children&#x27;s hospitals feature integrated multidisciplinary teams to coordinate healthcare of youth with spina bifida, the transition to adult healthcare can be difficult because the above healthcare professionals operate independently of each other, requiring separate appointments, and communicate among each other much less frequently. Healthcare professionals working with adults may also be less knowledgeable about spina bifida because it is considered a childhood chronic health condition. Due to the potential difficulties of the transition, adolescents with spina bifida and their families are encouraged to begin to prepare for the transition around ages 14–16, although this may vary depending on the adolescent&#x27;s cognitive and physical abilities and available family support. The transition itself should be gradual and flexible. The adolescent&#x27;s multidisciplinary treatment team may aid in the process by preparing comprehensive, up-to-date documents detailing the adolescent&#x27;s medical care, including information about medications, surgery, therapies, and recommendations. A transition plan and aid in identifying adult healthcare professionals are also helpful to include in the transition process.

Further complicating the transition process is the tendency for youths with spina bifida to be delayed in the development of autonomy, with boys particularly at risk for slower development of independence. An increased dependence on others (in particular family members) may interfere with the adolescent&#x27;s self-management of health-related tasks, such as catheterization, bowel management, and taking medications. As part of the transition process, it is beneficial to begin discussions at an early age about educational and vocational goals, independent living, and community involvement.

Certain locations feature multidisciplinary clinics in order to offer coordinated care between specialists, such as Cincinnati Children&#x27;s Center for Spina Bifida.

==Epidemiology==
Rates of spina bifida vary significantly by country from 0.1 to 5 per 1000 births. In high income and upper-middle income countries with folate fortification of foodstuffs public health programs, including in North America, the incidence of spina bifida is 34–37 cases per 100,000 live births. In countries without folate fortification programs nor widespread maternal folate supplementation, the incidence is 54–87 cases per 100,000 live births. And in low income countries or regions without folic acid supplementation nor fortification, the incidence is 300 cases per 100,000 live births. In India, about 1.9 per 1000 live births are affected by spina bifida.

In the United States, rates are higher on the East Coast than on the West Coast, and higher in white people (one case per 1000 live births) than in black people (0.1–0.4 case per 1000 live births). Immigrants from Ireland have a higher incidence of spina bifida than do natives. Highest rates of the defect in the USA can be found in Hispanic youth.

The highest incidence rates worldwide were found in Ireland and Wales, where three to four cases of myelomeningocele per 1000 population have been reported during the 1970s, along with more than six cases of anencephaly (both live births and stillbirths) per 1000 population. The reported overall incidence of myelomeningocele in the British Isles was 2.0–3.5 cases per 1000 births. Since then, the rate has fallen dramatically with 0.15 per 1000 live births reported in 1998, though this decline is partially accounted for because some fetuses are aborted when tests show signs of spina bifida (see Pregnancy screening above).

==History==
Although Hippocratic doctors were aware of developmental abnormalities involving the lower spine, the first person to describe a spinal spina bifida was a Persian physician Al-Razi (Rhazes, 865–925 AD). He gave the earliest accurate account of the morbid anatomy associated with spina bifida.

==Research==
* 1980 – Fetal surgical techniques using animal models were first developed at the University of California, San Francisco by Michael R. Harrison, N. Scott Adzick and research colleagues.
* 1994 – A surgical model that simulates the human disease is the fetal lamb model of myelomeningocele (MMC) introduced by Meuli and Adzick in 1994. The MMC-like defect was surgically created at 75 days of gestation (term 145 to 150 days) by a lumbo-sacral laminectomy. Approximately 3 weeks after creation of the defect a reversed latissimus dorsi flap was used to cover the exposed neural placode and the animals were delivered by cesarean section just prior term. Human MMC-like lesions with similar neurological deficit were found in the control newborn lambs. In contrast, animals that underwent closure had near-normal neurological function and well-preserved cytoarchitecture of the covered spinal cord on histopathological examination. Despite mild paraparesis, they were able to stand, walk, perform demanding motor test and demonstrated no signs of incontinence. Furthermore, sensory function of the hind limbs was present clinically and confirmed electrophysiologically. Further studies showed that this model, when combined with a lumbar spinal cord myelotomy leads to the hindbrain herniation characteristic of the Chiari II malformation and that in utero surgery restores normal hindbrain anatomy by stopping the leak of cerebrospinal fluid through the myelomeningocele lesion.

Surgeons at Vanderbilt University, led by Joseph Bruner, attempted to close spina bifida in 4 human fetuses using a skin graft from the mother using a laparoscope. Four cases were performed before stopping the procedure - two of the four fetuses died.
* 1998 – N. Scott Adzick and team at The Children&#x27;s Hospital of Philadelphia performed open fetal surgery for spina bifida in an early gestation fetus (22-week gestation fetus) with a successful outcome. Open fetal surgery for myelomeningocele involves surgically opening the pregnant mother&#x27;s abdomen and uterus to operate on the fetus. The exposed fetal spinal cord is covered in layers with surrounding fetal tissue at mid-gestation (19–25 weeks) to protect it from further damage caused by prolonged exposure to amniotic fluid. Between 1998 and 2003, Dr. Adzick, and his colleagues in the Center for Fetal Diagnosis and Treatment at The Children&#x27;s Hospital Of Philadelphia, performed prenatal spina bifida repair in 58 mothers and observed significant benefit in the babies.

Fetal surgery after 25 weeks has not shown benefit in subsequent studies.

===MOMS trial===
Management of myelomeningocele study (MOMS) was a phase III clinical trial designed to compare two approaches to the treatment of spina bifida: surgery before birth and surgery after birth.

The trial concluded that the outcomes after prenatal spina bifida treatment are improved to the degree that the benefits of the surgery outweigh the maternal risks. This conclusion requires a value judgment on the relative value of fetal and maternal outcomes on which opinion is still divided.

To be specific, the study found that prenatal repair resulted in:
* Reversal of the hindbrain herniation component of the Chiari II malformation
* Reduced need for ventricular shunting (a procedure in which a thin tube is introduced into the brain&#x27;s ventricles to drain fluid and relieve hydrocephalus)
* Reduced incidence or severity of potentially devastating neurologic effects caused by the spine&#x27;s exposure to amniotic fluid, such as impaired motor function

At one year of age, 40 percent of the children in the prenatal surgery group had received a shunt, compared to 83 percent of the children in the postnatal group. During pregnancy, all the fetuses in the trial had hindbrain herniation. However, at age 12 months, one-third (36 percent) of the infants in the prenatal surgery group no longer had any evidence of hindbrain herniation, compared to only 4 percent in the postnatal surgery group. Further surveillance is ongoing.

===Fetoscopic surgery===

In contrast to the open fetal operative approach performed in the MOMS trial, a minimally invasive fetoscopic approach (akin to &#x27;keyhole&#x27; surgery) has been developed. This approach has been evaluated by independent authors of a controlled study which showed some benefit in survivors, but others are more skeptical.

The observations in mothers and their fetuses that were operated over the past two and a half years by the matured minimally invasive approach showed the following results: Compared to the open fetal surgery technique, fetoscopic repair of myelomeningocele results in far less surgical trauma to the mother, as large incisions of her abdomen and uterus are not required. In contrast, the initial punctures have a diameter of 1.2 mm only. As a result, thinning of the uterine wall or dehiscence which have been among the most worrisome and criticized complications after the open operative approach do not occur following minimally invasive fetoscopic closure of spina bifida aperta. The risks of maternal chorioamnionitis or fetal death as a result of the fetoscopic procedure run below 5%. Women are discharged home from hospital one week after the procedure. There is no need for chronic administration of tocolytic agents since postoperative uterine contractions are barely ever observed. The current cost of the entire fetoscopic procedure, including hospital stay, drugs, perioperative clinical, ECG, ultrasound and MRI-examinations, is approximately €16,000.

In 2012, these results of the fetoscopic approach were presented at various national and international meetings, among them at the 1st European Symposium &quot;Fetal Surgery for Spina bifida&quot; in April 2012 in Giessen, at the 15th Congress of the German Society for Prenatal Medicine and Obstetrics in May 2012 in Bonn, at the World Congress of the Fetal Medicine Foundation in June 2012 and at the World Congress of the International Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ISUOG) in Copenhagen in September 2012, and published in abstract form.

Since then more data has emerged. In 2014, two papers were published on fifty one patients. These papers suggested that the risk to the mother is small. The main risk appears to be preterm labour, on average at about 33 weeks.

=== Placenta ===
The placenta is a critical determinant of fetal growth, yet placental development has not been well studied in pregnancies with fetal neural tube defects. Folate bioavailability is associated not only with isolated fetal neural tube defects, but is also required for optimal placental development. Pregnancies with folate-responsive neural tube defects may thus be at increased risk for poor placental development. A study comprehensively assessing the prevalence of placental pathology in a large cohort of fetuses with isolated neural tube defects found that these fetuses had higher risk of placental pathology and altered offspring growth outcomes at birth compared to controls, suggesting increased risk of placental maldevelopment that may contribute to poor fetal growth in pregnancies with neural tube defects.

<doc id="208865" wikidata="Q195961" url="?curid=208865" title="False memory syndrome">
<text>In psychology, false memory syndrome (FMS) was a proposed &quot;pattern of beliefs and behaviors&quot; in which a person&#x27;s identity and relationships are affected by false memories of psychological trauma, recollections which are strongly believed by the individual, but contested by the accused. False memory syndrome was proposed to be the result of recovered memory therapy, a scientifically discredited form of therapy intended to recover memories. Originally conceptualized by the False Memory Syndrome Foundation, the organization sought to understand what they understood as a general pattern of behaviors that followed after a patient underwent recovered memory therapy and to come up with a term to explain the pattern. The principle that individuals can hold false memories and the role that outside influence can play in their formation is widely accepted by scientists, but there is debate over whether this effect can lead to the kinds of detailed memories of repeated sexual abuse and significant personality changes (i.e. cutting off family members) typical of cases that FMS has historically been applied to. FMS is not listed as a psychiatric illness in any medical manuals including the ICD-11, or the DSM-5. The most influential figure in the genesis of the theory is psychologist Elizabeth Loftus.

== Definition ==
Memory researcher Julia Shaw notes that the &quot;syndrome&quot; does not refer to the normal, common, experience of having false memories or exhibiting memory errors or biases. False memory syndrome was a proposed &quot;pattern of beliefs and behaviors&quot; in which a person&#x27;s identity and interpersonal relationships center on a memory of a traumatic experience that the accused claims never happened but which the purported victim strongly believes occurred.

Not intended to be diagnostic, the colloquial &quot;syndrome&quot; referred to a set of behaviors that settled into a pattern:

# The belief that a mental health problem is a reaction to a past traumatic event that was repressed.
# The development of pseudomemories
# A centering of identity surrounding the memories
# The development of an extreme dependence on psychotherapy and a therapist
# Estrangement from family and friends

The FMS concept is controversial, and neither the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders nor the International Classification of Diseases include it. FMSF member Paul R. McHugh, among other supporters of the False Memory Syndrome construct, has suggested that the term was not adopted into the fourth version of the manual because the pertinent committee was, according to McHugh, being headed by believers in recovered memory. Those involved in the process of editing and publishing DSM-IV have rejected this accusation and characterized McHugh&#x27;s claim as conspiratorial, noting that the most recent edition of the International Classification of Diseases similarly chose not to include False Memory Syndrome while including Dissociative Amnesia.

== Recovered memory therapy ==

Recovered memory therapy is a catch all phrase to describe the scientifically discredited therapeutic processes and methods that can create false memories. These non-exhaustive methods include hypnosis, sedative guided interviews, journal writing for the purpose of recovering memories (often in the form of automatic writing), age regression and interpretation of &quot;body memories&quot; especially where the therapist believes repressed memories of traumatic events are the cause of their client&#x27;s problems. The term is not listed in DSM-V or used by any mainstream formal psychotherapy modality, which has led to accusations that the term is little more than a pejorative. 

== Evidence for false memories ==
Human memory is created and highly suggestible, and can create a wide variety of innocuous, embarrassing, and frightening memories through different techniques—including guided imagery, hypnosis, and suggestion by others. Though not all individuals exposed to these techniques develop memories, experiments suggest a significant number of people do, and will actively defend the existence of the events, even if told they were false and deliberately implanted. Questions about the possibility of false memories created an explosion of interest in suggestibility of human memory and resulted in an enormous increase in the knowledge about how memories are encoded, stored and recalled, producing pioneering experiments such as the lost in the mall technique. In Roediger and McDermott&#x27;s (1995) experiment, subjects were presented with a list of related items (such as candy, sugar, honey) to study. When asked to recall the list, participants were just as, if not more, likely to recall semantically related words (such as sweet) than items that were actually studied, thus creating false memories. This experiment, though widely replicated, remains controversial due to debate considering that people may store semantically related items from a word list conceptually rather than as language, which could account for errors in recollection of words without the creation of false memories. Susan Clancy discovered that people claiming to have been victims of alien abductions are more likely to recall semantically related words than a control group in such an experiment.

The lost in the mall technique is a research method designed to implant a false memory of being lost in a shopping mall as a child to test whether discussing a false event could produce a &quot;memory&quot; of an event that did not happen. In her initial study, Elizabeth Loftus found that 25% of subjects came to develop a &quot;memory&quot; for the event which had never actually taken place. Extensions and variations of the lost in the mall technique found that an average of one third of experimental subjects could become convinced that they experienced things in childhood that had never really occurred, even traumatic or impossible events.

=== Sexual abuse cases ===
The question of the accuracy and dependability of a repressed memory that someone has later recalled has contributed to some investigations and court cases, including cases of alleged sexual abuse or child sexual abuse (CSA). The research of Elizabeth Loftus has been used to counter claims of recovered memory in court and it has resulted in stricter requirements for the use of recovered memories being used in trials, as well as a greater requirement for corroborating evidence. In addition, some U.S. states no longer allow prosecution based on recovered memory testimony. Insurance companies have become reluctant to insure therapists against malpractice suits relating to recovered memories.

Supporters of recovered memories argue that there is &quot;overwhelming evidence that the mind is capable of repressing traumatic memories of child sexual abuse.&quot; Whitfield states that the &quot;false memory&quot; defense is &quot;seemingly sophisticated, but mostly contrived and often erroneous.&quot; He states that this defense has been created by &quot;accused, convicted and self-confessed child molesters and their advocates&quot; to try to &quot;negate their abusive, criminal behavior.&quot; Brown states that when pro-false memory expert witnesses and attorneys state there is no causal connection between CSA and adult psychopathology, that CSA doesn&#x27;t cause specific trauma-related problems like borderline and dissociative identity disorder, that other variables than CSA can explain the variance of adult psychopathology and that the long-term effects of CSA are non-specific and general, that this testimony is inaccurate and has the potential of misleading juries.

=== Malpractice cases ===
During the late 1990s, there were multiple lawsuits in the United States in which psychiatrists and psychologists were successfully sued, or settled out of court, on the charge of propagating iatrogenic memories of childhood sexual abuse, incest, and satanic ritual abuse.

Some of these suits were brought by individuals who later declared that their recovered memories of incest or satanic ritual abuse had been false. The False Memory Syndrome Foundation uses the term &quot;retractors&quot; to describe these individuals, and has shared their stories publicly. There is debate regarding the total number of retractions as compared to the total number of allegations, and the reasons for retractions.

==== Injuries resulting from malpractice ====
Sexual abuse of children and adolescents can lead to severe negative consequences. Child sexual abuse is a risk factor for many classes of psychiatric disorders, including anxiety disorders, affective disorders, dissociative disorders and personality disorders. Failure to meet recognized medical standards by psychiatrists causes injury to patients and the accused. Ramona v. Isabella was a prominent case of malpractice in 1994. A California jury awarded $500,000 to Gary Ramona, whose daughter Holly had falsely accused him of sexual abuse as a child, based on false memories retrieved by therapists during treatment for bulimia. Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Burton Bach dismissed Holly Ramona&#x27;s civil case against her father, holding that the outcome of her father&#x27;s malpractice suit had resolved the issue of whether any abuse took place. The Washington Post titled the article &quot;Sex Abuse Suit Dismissed in False-Memory Case&quot; on December 14, 1994. There were numerous cases brought to trial in the 1990s. Most included combinations of the misuse of hypnosis, guided imagery, sodium amytal, and anti-depressants.

The term &quot;false memory syndrome&quot; describes the phenomenon in which a mental therapy patient &quot;remembers&quot; an event such as childhood sexual abuse, that never occurred. The link between certain therapy practices and the development of psychological disorders such as dissociative identity disorder comes from malpractice suits and state licensure actions against therapists. These cases demonstrate the ease with which an individual can be led to exhibit dissociative symptoms, especially when hypnosis, sodium amytal, strong medications, or readings involving traumatic imagery magnify the effect of therapist suggestions or expectations. These cases also show that once the symptoms become established, the standard treatment modality often leads to a deterioration of the mental and emotional well-being of the patient.

== In popular culture ==
Television shows and movies have been made about the phenomenon, such as the USA Network series &quot;The Sinner,&quot; which touches on the idea of recovering forgotten memories. The show focuses on a woman who kills a seemingly random man on the beach one day for playing a song that triggered a traumatic event from her past, which she has temporarily forgotten. Throughout the first season detectives try to trigger her memory and find a motive for her actions.

&quot;The Caretaker&quot; (James Leyland Kirby) refers to the subject on his 2008 album &quot;Persistent Repetition of Phrases&quot;, which features a track titled &quot;False Memory Syndrome&quot;. Kirby later sampled &quot;False Memory Syndrome&quot; in the track &quot;H1 Post Awareness Confusions&quot; on his album &quot;Everywhere at the End of Time&quot;.

<doc id="208875" wikidata="Q1196788" url="?curid=208875" title="Underclocking">
<text>Underclocking, also known as downclocking, is modifying a computer or electronic circuit&#x27;s timing settings to run at a lower clock rate than is specified. Underclocking is used to reduce a computer&#x27;s power consumption, increase battery life, reduce heat emission, and it may also increase the system&#x27;s stability, lifespan/reliability and compatibility. Underclocking may be implemented by the factory, but many computers and components may be underclocked by the end user. Underclocking is the opposite of overclocking.

==Types==
===CPU underclocking===
For microprocessors, the purpose is generally to decrease the need for heat dissipation devices or decrease the electrical power consumption. This can provide increased system stability in high-heat environments, or can allow a system to run with a lower airflow (and therefore quieter) cooling fan or without one at all. For example, a Pentium 4 processor normally clocked at 3.4 GHz can be &quot;underclocked&quot; to 2 GHz and can then be safely run with reduced fan speeds. This invariably comes at the expense of some system performance. However, the proportional performance reduction is usually less than the proportional reduction in clock speed because performance is often limited by other bottlenecks: the hard disk, GPU, disk controller, Internet, network, etc. Underclocking refers to alterations of the timing of a synchronous circuit in order to lower a device&#x27;s energy needs. Deliberate underclocking involves limiting a processor&#x27;s speed, which may affect the speed of operations, but may or may not make a device noticeably less able, depending on other hardware and desired use.

Many computers and other devices allow for underclocking. Manufacturers add underclocking options for many reasons. Underclocking can help with excessive heat buildup, because lower performance will not generate as much heat inside the device. It can also lower the amount of energy needed to run the device. Laptop computers and other battery-operated devices often have underclocking settings, so that batteries can last longer without being charged.

In addition to providing underclocking features, manufacturers can choose to limit the capability of a machine in order to make it more efficient. Reduced instruction set computer (RISC) models can help makers build devices that work on less power.

===Graphics cards===
Underclocking can also be performed on graphics card processor&#x27;s GPUs, usually with the aim of reducing heat output. For instance, it is possible to set a GPU to run at lower clock rates when performing everyday tasks (e.g. internet browsing and word processing), thus allowing the card to operate at lower temperature and thus lower, quieter fan speeds. The GPU can then be overclocked for more graphically intense applications, such as games. Underclocking a GPU will reduce performance, but this decrease will probably not be noticeable except in graphically intensive applications.

===Memory underclocking===
Newer and faster RAM may be underclocked to match older systems as an inexpensive way to replace rare or discontinued memory. This might also be necessary if stability problems are encountered at higher settings, especially in a PC with several memory modules of different clock speed. If a PC processor is underclocked, and the clock factor or multiplier (the ratio between the processor and the memory clock speed) is unchanged, the memory will also be underclocked.

==When used==
Dynamic frequency scaling (automatic underclocking) is very common on laptop computers and has become common on desktop computers as well. In laptops, the processor is usually underclocked automatically whenever the computer is operating on batteries. Most modern notebook and desktop processors (utilizing power-saving schemes like AMD&#x27;s Cool&#x27;n&#x27;Quiet and PowerNow!) will underclock themselves automatically under a light processing load, when the machine BIOS and the operating system support it. Intel has also used this method on numerous processors through a feature called SpeedStep. SpeedStep first appeared on chips like the Core 2 Duo and selective Pentium models, later becoming a standard in mid to high-end Core i3, i5, and i7 models.

Some processors underclock automatically as a defensive measure, to prevent overheating which could cause permanent damage. When such a processor reaches a temperature level deemed too high for safe operation, the &quot;thermal control circuit&quot; activates, automatically decreasing the clock and CPU core voltage until the temperature has returned to a safe level. In a properly cooled environment, this mechanism should trigger rarely (if ever).

There are several different underclocking competitions similar in format to overclocking competitions, except the goal is to have the lowest clocked computer, as opposed to the highest.

==Advantages==
* Reduced electrical power consumption, especially when combined with undervolting (i.e., reducing the component&#x27;s voltage below the nominal). For instance, by underclocking an Athlon XP 1700+ processor from 1466 to 1000 MHz and reducing the core voltage from 1.75 to 1.15V, a computer user reduced the power consumption from 64.0 to 21.6W, i.e., 66% power reduction, with only 26% less performance. The same is true for newer processors: When a single-core Intel CPU was 20% underclocked, the PC&#x27;s performance was down only 13% with a 49% power reduction.
In general, the power consumed by a CPU with a capacitance &quot;C&quot;, running at frequency &quot;f&quot; and voltage &quot;V&quot; is approximately
:formula_1

* Reduced heat generation, which is exactly proportional to the power consumption.
* Less noise because the cooling fans may be slowed down, or even eliminated. A cooling fan&#x27;s efficiency is proportional to its rotation speed, but as it increases, so does the noise.
* Longer hardware lifespan.
* Increased stability.
* Increased battery life.
* Better compatibility with old applications.
* Proper performance of very old computer games that were dependent on CPU timing.

==In practice==
===Linux===
The Linux kernel supports CPU frequency modulation. In supported processors, using &quot;cpufreq&quot; to gain access to this feature gives the system administrator a variable level of control over the CPU&#x27;s clock rate. The kernel includes six governors by default: Conservative, Ondemand, Performance, Powersave, Userspace and Schedutil. The Conservative and Ondemand governors adjust the clock rate depending on the CPU load, but each with different algorithms. The Ondemand governor jumps to maximum frequency on CPU load and decreases the frequency step by step on CPU idle, whereas the Conservative governor increases the frequency step by step on CPU load and jumps to lowest frequency on CPU idle. The Performance, Powersave and Userspace governors set the clock rate statically: Performance to the highest available, Powersave to the lowest available, and Userspace to a frequency determined and controlled by the user. The Schedutil governor estimates the load through the scheduler&#x27;s Per-Entity Load Tracking (PELT) mechanism.

===Windows===
Underclocking can be done manually in the BIOS or with Windows applications, or dynamically using features such as Intel&#x27;s SpeedStep or AMD&#x27;s Cool&#x27;n&#x27;Quiet. In Windows 7 and 10, underclocking can be set within the &quot;advanced&quot; settings of a power management plan.

=== Asus Eee PC ===
Earlier models of the Asus Eee PC used a 900 MHz Intel Celeron M processor underclocked to 630 MHz.

=== Mac OS X ===
Underclocking can be performed in the EFI.

=== Smartphones and PDAs ===
Most smartphones and PDAs, such as the Motorola Droid, Palm Pre, and Apple iPhone, use underclocking of a more powerful processor, rather than the full clocking of a less powerful processor, to maximize battery life. The designers for such mobile devices often discover that a slower processor gives worse battery life than a more powerful processor at a lower clock rate.
They select a processor on the basis of the performance per watt of the processor.

===Performance===
The performance of an underclocked machine will often be better than might be expected. Under normal desktop use, the full power of the CPU is rarely needed. Even when the system is busy, a large amount of time is usually spent waiting for data from memory, disk, or other devices. Such devices communicate with the CPU through a bus which operates at a much lower bandwidth. Generally, the lower the CPU multiplier (and thus clockrate of a CPU), the closer its performance will be to that of the bus, and the less time it will spend waiting.

<doc id="208878" wikidata="Q713017" url="?curid=208878" title="Austin Osman Spare">
<text>Austin Osman Spare (30 December 1886 – 15 May 1956) was an English artist and occultist who worked as both a draughtsman and a painter. Influenced by symbolism and Art Nouveau, his art was known for its clear use of line, and its depiction of monstrous and sexual imagery. In an occult capacity, he developed magical techniques including automatic writing, automatic drawing and sigilization based on his theories of the relationship between the conscious and unconscious self.

Born into a working-class family in Snow Hill in London, Spare grew up in Smithfield and then Kennington, taking an early interest in art. Gaining a scholarship to study at the Royal College of Art in South Kensington, he trained as a draughtsman, while also taking a personal interest in Theosophy and Western esotericism, becoming briefly involved with Aleister Crowley and his A∴A∴. Developing his own personal occult philosophy, he wrote a series of occult grimoires, namely &quot;Earth Inferno&quot; (1905), &quot;The Book of Pleasure&quot; (1913) and &quot;The Focus of Life&quot; (1921). Alongside a string of personal exhibitions, he also achieved much press attention for being the youngest entrant at the 1904 Royal Academy summer exhibition.

After publishing a short-lived art magazine, &quot;Form&quot;, during the First World War he was conscripted into the armed forces and worked as an official war artist. Spare attempted to revive &quot;Form&quot; after the war before shifting his efforts to &quot;The Golden Hind&quot;, in partnership with Clifford Bax. Moving to various working class areas of South London over the following decades, Spare lived in poverty, but continued exhibiting his work to varying degrees of success. With the arrival of surrealism onto the London art scene during the 1930s, critics and the press once more took an interest in his work, seeing it as an early precursor to surrealist imagery. Losing his home during the Blitz, he fell into relative obscurity following the Second World War, although he continued exhibiting till his death in 1956.

Spare&#x27;s spiritualist legacy was largely maintained by his friend, the Thelemite author Kenneth Grant in the latter part of the 20th century, and his beliefs regarding sigils provided a key influence on the chaos magic movement and Thee Temple ov Psychick Youth. Spare&#x27;s art once more began to receive attention in the 1970s, due to a renewed interest in Art Nouveau in Britain, with several retrospective exhibitions being held in London.

==Biography==

===Childhood: 1886–1900===
Austin&#x27;s father, Philip Newton Spare, was born in Yorkshire in 1857, and moved to London, where he gained employment with the City of London Police in 1878, being stationed at Snow Hill Police Station. Austin&#x27;s mother, Eliza Osman, was born in Devon, the daughter of a Royal Marine, and married Philip Newton Spare at St Bride&#x27;s Church in Fleet Street in December 1879. The Spare&#x27;s first child to survive was John Newton Spare, born in 1882, with William Herbert Spare following in 1883 and then Susan Ann Spare in 1885.

The couple&#x27;s fourth surviving child, Austin Osman Spare was born shortly after four o&#x27;clock on the morning of 30 December 1886. Spare attended St. Agnes School, attached to a prominent High Anglican church, and as a child he was brought up within the Anglican denomination of Christianity. Taking an interest in drawing, from about the age of 12, he began taking evening classes at Lambeth School of Art under the tutorship of Philip Connard.

===Artistic training: 1900–1905===

In 1900, Spare began working as a designer at Powell&#x27;s glass-working business in Whitefriars Street, which had links to the Arts and Crafts movement and William Morris. In the evenings he attended the Lambeth School of Art. Two visitors to Powell&#x27;s, Sir William Blake Richmond and FH Richmond RBA, came across some of Spare&#x27;s drawings, and impressed, they recommended him for a scholarship to the Royal College of Art (RCA) in South Kensington. He achieved further attention when his drawings were exhibited in the British Art Section of the St. Louis Exposition and the Paris International Exhibition, and in 1903 he won a silver medal at the National Competition of Schools of Art, where the judges, who included Walter Crane and Byam Shaw, praised his &quot;remarkable sense of colour and great vigour of conception.&quot;

Soon, he began studying at the RCA, but was dissatisfied with the teaching he received there, becoming a truant and being disciplined by his tutors as a result. Influenced by the work of Charles Ricketts, Edmund Sullivan, George Frederic Watts and Aubrey Beardsley, his artistic style focused on clear lines, which was in stark contrast to the College&#x27;s emphasis on shading. Still living in his parents&#x27; home, he began dressing in unconventional and flamboyant garb, and became popular with other students at the college, with a particularly strong friendship developing between Spare and Sylvia Pankhurst, a prominent Suffragette and leftist campaigner.

After becoming a practising occultist, he wrote and illustrated his first grimoire, &quot;Earth Inferno&quot; (1905), in which he took as his premise Blavatsky&#x27;s idea that Earth already was Hell. The work exhibited a variety of influences, including Theosophy, the Bible, Omar Khayyam, Dante&#x27;s &quot;Inferno&quot; and his own mystical ideas regarding Zos and Kia.

In May 1904, Spare held his first public art exhibition in the foyer of the Newington Public Library in Walworth Road. Here, his paintings illustrated many of the themes that would continue to inspire him throughout his life, including his mystical views about Zos and Kia. His father then surreptitiously submitted two of Spare&#x27;s drawings to the Royal Academy, one of which, a design for a bookplate, was accepted for exhibition at that year&#x27;s prestigious summer exhibition. Journalists from the British press took a particular interest in his work, highlighting the fact that, at seventeen years of age, he was the youngest artist in the exhibition, with some erroneously claiming that he was the youngest artist to ever exhibit at the show. In 1905, he left the RCA without having received any qualifications.

===Early career: 1906–1910===
Having left higher education, Spare became employed as a bookplate designer and illustrator, with his first book commission being for Ethel Rolt Wheeler&#x27;s &quot;Behind the Veil&quot;, published by the company David Nutt in 1906. In ensuing years he would also illustrate such texts as Charles Grindrod&#x27;s &quot;The Shadow of the Raggedstone&quot; (1909) and Justice Darling&#x27;s &quot;On the Oxford Circuit and other Verses&quot; (1909). In 1905, he once more exhibited at the Royal Academy&#x27;s summer exhibition, having submitted a drawing known as &quot;The Resurrection of Zoroaster&quot;, featuring beaked serpents swirling around the figure of the ancient Persian philosopher who founded Zoroastrianism. Diversifying his employment, In 1906, Spare published his first political cartoon, a satire on the use of Chinese wage slave labourers in British South Africa, which appeared in the pages of &quot;The Morning Leader&quot; newspaper. When not involved in these jobs, he devoted much of his time to illustrating a second publication, &quot;A Book of Satyrs&quot;, which consisted of a series of nine satirical images lampooning such institutions as politics and the clergy. The volume contained a number of self-portraits; he also filled many of the images with illustrations of bric-a-brac, of which he was a great collector. The book was finished off with an introduction authored by Scottish painter James Guthrie. Proud of his son&#x27;s achievement, Spare&#x27;s father would later inquire as to whether the publisher John Lane of Bodley Head would be interested in re-printing &quot;A Book of Satyrs&quot;, leading to the release of an expanded second edition in 1909. Meanwhile, in 1907 Spare produced one of his most significant illustrations, a drawing titled &quot;Portrait of the Artist&quot;, featuring himself sitting behind a table covered in assorted bric-a-brac.

In October 1907 Spare held his first major exhibition, titled simply &quot;Black and White Drawings by Austin O Spare&quot;, at the Bruton Gallery in London&#x27;s West End. Attracting widespread interest and sensational views in the press, he was widely compared to Aubrey Beardsley, with reviewers commenting on what they saw as the eccentric and grotesque nature of his work. &quot;The World&quot; commented that &quot;his inventive faculty is stupendous and terrifying in its creative flow of impossible horrors&quot;, while &quot;The Observer&quot; noted that &quot;Mr. Spare&#x27;s art is abnormal, unhealthy, wildly fantastic and unintelligible&quot;.

One of those attracted to Spare&#x27;s work was Aleister Crowley (1875–1947), an occultist who had founded the religion of Thelema in 1904, taking as its basis Crowley&#x27;s &quot;The Book of the Law&quot;. Crowley introduced himself to Spare, becoming a patron and champion of his art, which he proclaimed to be a message from the Divine. Spare subsequently submitted several drawings for publication in Crowley&#x27;s Thelemite journal, &quot;The Equinox&quot;, receiving payment in the form of an expensive ritual robe. Spare would also be invited to join Crowley&#x27;s new Thelemite magical order, the A∴A∴ or &quot;Argenteum Astrum&quot;, which had been co-founded with George Cecil Jones in 1907. Becoming the seventh member of the order in July 1907, where he used the magical name of &quot;Yihovaeum&quot;, it was through doing so that he befriended the occultist Victor Neuburg, but although he remained in A∴A∴ until 1912, ultimately Spare never became a full member, disliking Crowley&#x27;s emphasis on strict hierarchy and organisation and becoming heavily critical of the practice of ceremonial magic. In turn, Crowley would claim that Spare was only interested in &quot;black magic&quot; and for that reason had kept him back from fully entering the Order.

Spare&#x27;s major patron during this period was the wealthy property developer Pickford Waller, although other admirers included Desmond Coke, Ralph Strauss, Lord Howard de Walden and Charles Ricketts. Spare became popular among &quot;avant-garde&quot; homosexual circles in Edwardian London, with several known gay men becoming patrons of his work. In particular he became good friends with the same-sex couple Marc-André Raffalovich and John Gray, with Spare later characterising the latter as &quot;the most wonderful man I have ever met.&quot; Gray would introduce Spare to the Irish novelist George Moore, whom he would subsequently befriend. The actual nature of Spare&#x27;s sexuality at the time remains debated; his friend Frank Brangwyn would later claim that he was &quot;strongly&quot; homosexual but had suppressed these leanings. In contrast to this, in later life Spare would refer to a wide variety of heterosexual encounters that took place at this time, including with an intersex person, a dwarf with a protuberant forehead and a Welsh maid.

===Marriage and &quot;The Book of Pleasure&quot;: 1911–1916===

On one occasion, Spare met a middle-aged woman named Mrs Shaw in a pub in Mayfair. Eager to marry off her daughter, who already had one child from an earlier relationship, Mrs Shaw soon introduced Spare to her child, Eily Gertrude Shaw (1888-1938). Spare fell in love, producing a number of portraits of Eily, before marrying her on 4 September 1911. However, the relationship between Spare and his wife was strained; unlike him, she was &quot;unintellectual and materialistic&quot;, and disliked many of his friends, particularly the younger males, asking him to cease his association with them.

Around 1910, Spare illustrated &quot;The Starlit Mire&quot;, a book of epigrams written by two doctors, James Bertram and F. Russell, in which his illustrations once more displayed his interest in the abnormal and the grotesque. Another notable work from this period was an illustration known as &quot;A Fantasy&quot;, which included a self-portrait of Spare surrounded by a variety of horned animals and a horned hermaphrodite creature, visually depicting his belief in the innate mental connection between humanity and our non-human ancestors.

Over a period of several years, Spare began work on his third tome, &quot;The Book of Pleasure (Self Love): The Psychology of Ecstasy&quot;, which he self-published in 1913. Exploring his own mystical ideas regarding the human being and their unconscious mind, it also discussed magic and the use of sigils. &quot;Conceived initially as a pictorial allegory the book quickly evolved into a much deeper work, drawing inspiration from Taoism and Buddhism, but primarily from his experiences as an artist.&quot; The book sold poorly, and received a mixed review from the &quot;Times Literary Supplement&quot;, which while accepting Spare&#x27;s &quot;technical mastery&quot;, was more critical of much of the content.

In 1914, Spare was involved in a newly launched popular art magazine known as &quot;Colour&quot;, which was edited in Victoria Street, submitting a number of contributions to its early issues. He soon developed the idea of founding his own art magazine, suggesting the idea to the publisher John Lane, who had formerly produced &quot;The Yellow Book&quot;, an influential periodical that had appeared between 1894 and 1897. Envisioning his new venture, titled &quot;Form&quot;, as a successor to &quot;The Yellow Book&quot;, he was joined as co-editor by the etcher Frederick Carter, who used the pseudonym of Francis Marsden. The first issue appeared in the summer of 1916, containing contributions from Edmund Joseph Sullivan, Walter de la Mare, Frank Brangwyn, W.H. Davies, J.C. Squire, Ricketts and Shannon. Spare and Carter co-wrote an article discussing automatic writing, arguing that it allowed the unconscious part of the mind to produce art, a theme that Spare had previously dealt with in &quot;The Book of Pleasure&quot;. Generally, &quot;Form&quot; was poorly received by the critics and the public, being described as a &quot;very horrible publication&quot; by George Bernard Shaw, who proclaimed its design and layout to be &quot;ancient Morrisian&quot; and thereby out of fashion.

===World War I, &quot;The Focus of Life&quot; and &quot;The Anathema of Zos&quot;: 1917–1927===
In 1917, with the First World War still raging, Spare was conscripted into the Royal Army Medical Corps, where he worked as a medical orderly. Later, he was appointed to the position of Acting Staff-Sergeant, and given the task of illustrating the conflict along with other artists based in a studio at 76 Fulham Road.

Spare was demobilized in 1919. Although they never gained a divorce, Spare had separated from his wife Eily, who had begun a relationship with another man. Focusing on the writing and illustration of a new book, 1921 saw the publication of &quot;The Focus of Life The Mutterings of AOS&quot; by Morland Press. Edited and introduced by Frederick Carter, the book once more dealt with Spare&#x27;s mystical ideas, continuing many of the themes explored in &quot;The Book of Pleasure&quot;. The success of this book led Spare to decide to revive &quot;Form&quot;, with the first issue appearing in a new format in October 1921, edited by Spare and his friend W.H. Davies. Intended to be populist in tone, contributions came from Sidney Sime, Robert Graves, Herbert Furst, Laura Knight, Frank Brangwyn, Glyn Philpot, Edith Sitwell, Walter de la Mare, J.F.C. Fuller and Havelock Ellis. However, Spare discontinued the magazine after the third issue, which was published in January 1922. He then moved on the production of another art journal, &quot;The Golden Hind&quot;, co-edited with Clifford Bax and published by Chapman and Hall. The first issue appeared in October 1922, featuring a lithograph from Spare titled &quot;The New Eden.&quot; Faced with problems, the journal eventually decreasing in size from a folio to a quarto, and in 1924 it folded after eight issues.

The summer of 1924 saw Spare produce a sketchbook of &quot;automatic drawings&quot; titled &quot;The Book of Ugly Ecstasy&quot;, which contained a series of grotesque creatures; the sole copy of the book would be purchased by the art historian Gerald Reitlinger. The spring of 1925 then saw the production of a similar sketchbook, &quot;A Book of Automatic Drawings&quot;, and then a further suite of pictures, titled &quot;The Valley of Fear&quot;. He also began work on a new book, a piece of automatic writing titled &quot;The Anathema of Zos: The Sermon to the Hypocrites&quot;, which served as a criticism of British society influenced by the ideas of German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche. Spare would self-publish it in an edition of 100 copies from his sister&#x27;s house in Goodmayes, Essex, in 1927.

===Surrealism and World War II: 1927–1945===
Spare held exhibitions of his work at the St. George&#x27;s Gallery in Hanover Square in 1927, and then at the Lefevre Gallery in 1929, but his work received little praise in the press or attention from the public. Living in poverty and with his work becoming unpopular in the mainstream London art scene, Spare contemplated suicide. He then undertook a series of anamorphic portraits, predominantly of young women, which he termed the &quot;Experiments in Reality&quot;. Influenced by the work of El Greco, they were exhibited at the Godfrey Phillips Galleries in St James&#x27;s, Central London in November 1930, an exhibit that proved to be Spare&#x27;s last in London&#x27;s West End.

Surrealism took an interest in automatism and the unconscious, and the reporter Hubert Nicholson ran a story on Spare titled &quot;Father of Surrealism – He&#x27;s a Cockney!&quot;. Jumping onto this new craze for surrealism, Spare released a set of what he described as &quot;SURREALIST Racing Forecast Cards&quot; for use in divination. The renewed interest benefited him, with his 1936, 1937 and 1938 exhibitions in Walworth Road proving a success, and he began teaching students at his studio in what he called his Austin Spare School of Draughtsmanship.

When the Second World War broke out against Nazi Germany in 1939, Spare, an ardent anti-Nazi, tried to enlist into the army, but was deemed too old. In the ensuing Blitz of London by the German Luftwaffe, Spare&#x27;s flat and all the artwork in it was destroyed by a bomb on 10 May 1941, leaving him temporarily homeless.

===Kenneth Grant and later life: 1946–1956===
Following the culmination of the war, Spare held a comeback show in November 1947 at the Archer Gallery. A commercial success, the works on display showed the increasing influence of Spiritualism on his thought, and included a number of portraits of prominent Spiritualists like Arthur Conan Doyle and Kate Fox-Jencken. He also featured a number of portraits of famous movie stars in the exhibit, leading him to later gain the moniker of &quot;the first British Pop Artist&quot;.

In the spring of 1949, a recently married woman named Steffi Grant introduced herself to Spare. She introduced him to her husband Kenneth Grant (1924–2011). Spare and the Grants became great friends, frequenting a number of London pubs together and sharing books on the subject of the esoteric.

The Grants&#x27; influence led Spare to begin writing several new occult manuscripts, the &quot;Logomachy of Zos&quot; and the &quot;Zoetic Grimoire of Zos&quot;. Under Grant&#x27;s influence, Spare began to show an increasing interest in witchcraft and the witches&#x27; sabbath, producing artworks with titles such as &quot;Witchery&quot;, &quot;Walpurgis Vampire&quot; and &quot;Satiated Succubi&quot; and claiming that on a bus he had encountered a group of female witches on their way to the Sabbath.

Spare held his first pub show at the Temple Bar in Walworth Road in late 1949, which again proved successful, earning Spare 250 guineas. One of those who had seen the show was publisher Michael Hall, and impressed by Spare&#x27;s work, he commissioned him to help provide illustrations for his new periodical, &quot;The London Mystery Magazine&quot;. The fifth issue, for August–September 1950, contained an article on Spare and his work, while the sixth contained an article written by Algernon Blackwood that was illustrated by Spare.

==As artist==
Spare&#x27;s work is remarkable for its variety, including paintings, a vast number of drawings, work with pastel, a few etchings, published books combining text with imagery, and even bizarre bookplates. He was productive from his earliest years until his death. According to Haydn Mackay, &quot;rhythmic ornament grew from his hand seemingly without conscious effort.&quot;

Spare was regarded as an artist of considerable talent and good prospects, but his style was apparently controversial. Critical reaction to his work in period ranged from baffled but impressed, to patronizing and dismissive. An anonymous review of &quot;The Book of Satyrs&quot; published in December 1909, which must have appeared around the time of Spare&#x27;s 23rd birthday, is by turns condescending and grudgingly respectful, &quot;Mr. Spare&#x27;s work is evidently that of young man of talent.&quot; However, &quot;What is more important is the personality lying behind these various influences. And here we must credit Mr. Spare with a considerable fund of fancy and invention, although the activities of his mind still find vent through somewhat tortuous channels. Like most young men he seems to take himself somewhat too seriously&quot;. Our critic ends his review with the observation that Spare&#x27;s &quot;drawing is often more shapeless and confused than we trust it will be when he has assimilated better the excellent influences upon which he has formed his style.&quot;

Two years later another anonymous review (this time of &quot;The Starlit Mire&quot;, for which Spare provided ten drawings) suggests, &quot;When Mr. Spare was first heard of six or seven years ago he was hailed in some quarters as the new Beardsley, and as the work of a young man of seventeen his drawings had a certain amount of vigour and originality. But the years have not dealt kindly with Mr. Spare, and he must not be content with producing in his majority what passed muster in his nonage. However, his designs are not inappropriate for the crude paradoxes that form the text of this book. It is far easier to imitate an epigram than to invent one.&quot;

In a 1914 review of &quot;The Book of Pleasure&quot;, the critic (again anonymous) seems resigned to bewilderment, &quot;It is impossible for me to regard Mr. Spare&#x27;s drawings otherwise than as diagrams of ideas which I have quite failed to unravel; I can only regret that a good draughtsman limits the scope of his appeal&quot;.

From October 1922 to July 1924 Spare edited, jointly with Clifford Bax, the quarterly, &quot;Golden Hind&quot; for Chapman and Hall publishers. This was a short-lived project, but during its brief career it reproduced impressive figure drawing and lithographs by Spare and others. In 1925 Spare, Alan Odle, John Austen, and Harry Clarke showed together at the St George&#x27;s Gallery, and in 1930 at the Godfrey Philips Galleries. The 1930 show was the last West End show Spare would have for 17 years.

Spare&#x27;s obituary printed in &quot;The Times&quot; of 16 May 1956 states:

Thereafter Spare was rarely found in the purlieus of Bond St. He would teach a little from January to June, then up to the end of October, would finish various works, and from the beginning of November to Christmas would hang his products in the living-room, bedroom, and kitchen of his flat in the Borough. There he kept open house; critics and purchasers would go down, ring the bell, be admitted, and inspect the pictures, often in the company of some of the models - working women of the neighbourhood. Spare was convinced that there was a great potential demand for pictures at 2 or 3 guineas each, and condemned the practice of asking £20 for &quot;amateurish stuff&quot;. He worked chiefly in pastel or pencil, drawing rapidly, often taking no more than two hours over a picture. He was especially interested in delineating the old, and had various models over 70 and one as old as 93.

But Spare did not entirely disappear. During the late 1930s he developed and exhibited a style of painting based on a logarithmic form of anamorphic projection which he called &quot;siderealism&quot;. This work appears to have been well received. In 1947 he exhibited at the Archer Gallery, producing over 200 works for the show. It was a very successful show and led to something of a post-war renaissance of interest.

Public awareness of Spare seems to have declined somewhat in the 1960s before the slow but steady revival of interest in his work beginning in the mid-1970s. The following passage in a discussion of an exhibit including Spare&#x27;s work in the summer of 1965 suggests some critics had hoped he would disappear into obscurity forever. The critic writes that the curator of the exhibit

has resurrected an unknown English artist named Austin Osman Spare, who imitates etchings in pen and ink in the manner of Beardsley but really harks back to the macabre German romanticism. He tortured himself before the first war and would have inspired the surrealist movement had he been discovered early enough. He has come back in time to play a belated part in the revival of taste for &quot;art nouveau&quot;.

Robert Ansell summarized Spare&#x27;s artistic contributions as follows:

During his lifetime, Spare left critics unable to place his work comfortably. Ithell Colquhoun supported his claim to have been a proto-Surrealist and posthumously the critic Mario Amaya made the case for Spare as a Pop Artist. Typically, he was both of these - and neither. A superb figurative artist in the mystical tradition, Spare may be regarded as one of the last English Symbolists, following closely his great influence George Frederick Watts. The recurrent motifs of androgyny, death, masks, dreams, vampires, satyrs and religious themes, so typical of the art of the French and Belgian Symbolists, find full expression in Spare&#x27;s early work, along with a desire to shock the bourgeois.

==Zos Kia Cultus==

From his early years, Spare developed his own magico-religious philosophy which has come to be known as the Zos Kia Cultus (also Zos–Kia Cultus), a term coined by the occultist Kenneth Grant. Raised in the Anglican denomination of Christianity, Spare had come to denounce this monotheistic faith when he was seventeen, telling a reporter that &quot;I am devising a religion of my own which embodies my conception of what; we are, we were, and shall be in the future.&quot;

===Zos and Kia===
Key to Spare&#x27;s magico-religious views were the dual concepts of &quot;Zos&quot; and &quot;Kia&quot;. Spare described &quot;Zos&quot; as the human body and mind, and would later adopt the term as a pseudonym for himself. Biographer Phil Baker believed that Spare derived the word from the Ancient Greek words &quot;zoe&quot;, meaning life, and &quot;zoion&quot;, meaning animal or beast, with Spare also being attracted to the exotic nature of the letter &quot;z&quot;, which rarely appears in the English language. The author Alan Moore disagreed, believing that the term &quot;ZOS&quot; had instead been adopted by Spare to counterbalance his own initials, &quot;AOS&quot;, in which the A would represent the beginning of the alphabet, and the Z would represent the end. In this way, Moore argued, Spare was offering an &quot;ultimate and transcendent expression of himself at the extremities of his own being.&quot;

Spare used the term &quot;Kia&quot;, which he pronounced &quot;keah&quot; or &quot;keer&quot;, to refer to a universal mind or ultimate power, akin to the Hindu idea of Brahman or the Taoist idea of the Tao. Phil Baker believed that Spare had developed this word either from Eastern or Cabalistic words such as &quot;ki&quot;, &quot;chi&quot;, &quot;khya&quot; or &quot;chiah&quot;. Alternately, he thought that it might have been adopted from Madame Blavatsky in her book &quot;The Secret Doctrine&quot;, which refers to the idea of an ultimate power as &quot;Kia-yu&quot;.

===The unconscious mind===

Spare placed great emphasis on the unconscious part of the mind, believing that it was the source of inspiration. He considered the conscious part of the mind to be useless for this, believing that it only served to reinforce the separation between ourselves and that which we desire.

It has been argued that Spare&#x27;s magic depended (at least in part) upon psychological repression. According to one author, Spare&#x27;s magical rationale was as follows, &quot;If the psyche represses certain impulses, desires, fears, and so on, and these then have the power to become so effective that they can mold or even determine entirely the entire conscious personality of a person right down to the most subtle detail, this means nothing more than the fact that through repression (&quot;forgetting&quot;) many impulses, desires, etc. have the ability to create a reality to which they are denied access as long as they are either kept alive in the conscious mind or recalled into it. Under certain conditions, that which is repressed can become even more powerful than that which is held in the conscious mind.&quot;

Spare believed that intentionally repressed material would become enormously effective in the same way that &quot;unwanted&quot; (since not consciously provoked) repressions and complexes have tremendous power over the person and his or her shaping of reality. It was a logical conclusion to view the subconscious mind as the source of all magical power, which Spare soon did. In his opinion, a magical desire cannot become truly effective until it has become an organic part of the subconscious mind.

Peter J. Carroll argues that Jungian psychology has had a heavy influence on Spare&#x27;s belief, specifically that the mind has strange hidden depths in it, and that magic basically depends on activating the subconscious as much as the conscious. Despite his interest in the unconscious, Spare was deeply critical of the ideas put forward by the psychoanalysts Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung, referring to them as &quot;Fraud and Junk.&quot;

===Atavistic resurgence===
Spare also believed in what he called &quot;atavistic resurgence&quot;, the idea that the human mind contains atavistic memories that have their origins in earlier species on the evolutionary ladder. In Spare&#x27;s worldview, the &quot;soul&quot; was actually the continuing influence of &quot;the ancestral animals&quot; that humans had evolved from, that could be tapped into to gain insight and qualities from past incarnations. In many ways this theory offered a unison of reincarnation and evolution, both being factors which Spare saw intertwined which furthered evolutionary progression. For these reasons, he believed in the intimate unity between humans and other species in the animal world; this was visually reflected in his art through the iconography of the horned humanoid figures. Although this &quot;atavistic resurgence&quot; was very different from orthodox Darwinism, Spare greatly admired the evolutionary biologist Charles Darwin, and in later life paid a visit to the Kentish village of Downe, where Darwin had written his seminal text &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot; (1859).

===Magic and sigils===

Spare &quot;elaborated his sigils by condensing letters of the alphabet into diagrammatic glyphs of desire, which were to be integrated into postural (yogalike) practices—monograms of thought, for the government of energy.&quot; Spare&#x27;s work is contemporaneous with Hugo Ball&#x27;s attempts &quot;to rediscover the evangelical concept of the &#x27;word&#x27; (logos) as a magical complex image&quot;—as well as with Walter Benjamin&#x27;s thesis that &quot;Mediation, which is the immediacy of all mental communication, is the fundamental problem of linguistic theory, and if one chooses to call this immediacy magic, then the primary problem of language is its magic. Spare&#x27;s &#x27;sentient symbols&#x27; and his &#x27;alphabet of desire&#x27; situate this mediatory magic in a libidinal framework of Tantric—which is to say cosmological—proportions.&quot; (An alphabet of desire modelled after Spare&#x27;s ideas has since been developed by Peter J. Carroll amongst others, especially in his influential &quot;Liber Null&quot;, a sourcebook of chaos magic.)

Following his experience with Aleister Crowley and other Thelemites, Spare developed a hostile view of ceremonial magic and many of those occultists who practised it, describing them as &quot;the unemployed dandies of the Brothels&quot; in &quot;The Book of Pleasure&quot;.

==Personal life==
Spare was often described as kind and down-to-earth by his friends. A lifelong animal lover, he took care of many animals that he found near his home and was a member of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals; in many photographs, he can be seen wearing the organisation&#x27;s badge.

==Death==
In May 1956, Spare&#x27;s appendix burst and he was admitted to South Western Hospital in London&#x27;s Stockwell district, where doctors noted that he had also been suffering from anaemia, bronchitis, gall stones, and hypertension. He died at the hospital on the afternoon of 15 May 1956, at the age of 69. He was buried alongside his father at St. Mary&#x27;s Church in the Ilford area of London.

==Legacy and influence==
===In art===
In 1964, the Greenwich Gallery held an exhibition of Spare&#x27;s work accompanied by a catalogue essay by the Pop Artist Mario Amaya, who believed that Spare&#x27;s artworks depicting celebrities, produced in the late 1930s and 1940s, represented &quot;the first examples of Pop art in this country.&quot; Furthermore, he proclaimed that Spare&#x27;s automatic drawings &quot;predicted Abstract Expressionism long before the name of Jack [sic] Pollock was heard of in England.&quot; London&#x27;s The Viktor Wynd Museum of Curiosities, Fine Art &amp; Natural History has a permanent gallery dedicated to his work - The Spare Room

A portrait of an old man, with a beard, by Spare was shown on the BBC Television programme &quot;Antiques Roadshow&quot; in March 2020, and was described as being very different in style to his usual work.

===In esotericism===
Some of Spare&#x27;s techniques, particularly the use of sigils and the creation of an &quot;alphabet of desire&quot; were adopted, adapted and popularized by Peter J. Carroll in the work &quot;Liber Null &amp; Psychonaut&quot;. Carroll and other writers such as Ray Sherwin are seen as key figures in the emergence of some of Spare&#x27;s ideas and techniques as a part of a magical movement loosely referred to as chaos magic.

===In music===
Bulldog Breed, a British psychedelic music band, have a song entitled &quot;Austin Osmanspare&quot; on their one and only 1970 album &quot;Made in England&quot;.

Asgærd, a British prog rock band, released an album in 1972 called &quot;In the Realm of Asgærd&quot;, which contained a song named &quot;Austin Osman Spare&quot;.

John Balance of the influential early industrial music group Coil (formed in 1982) described Spare as being his mentor, and claimed that &quot;what Spare did in art, we try to do through music.&quot;

The Polish death metal band Behemoth recorded a studio album entitled &quot;Zos Kia Cultus&quot; in Warsaw in September 2002.

=== In magic ===
&quot;Zos Kia Cultus&quot; is a term coined by Kenneth Grant, with different meanings for different people. One interpretation is that it is a form, style, or school of magic inspired by Spare. It focuses on one&#x27;s individual universe and the influence of the magician&#x27;s will on it. While the Zos Kia Cultus has very few adherents today, it is widely considered an important influence on the rise of chaos magic.

=== In culture ===
In 2016, a new street was named after Spare near his former home in London&#x27;s Elephant and Castle area.

<text>The prime minister of the Republic of Iraq is the head of government of Iraq and the commander-in-chief of the Iraqi Armed Forces. On 27 October 2022, Mohammed Shia&#x27; Al Sudani became the incumbent prime minister.

== History ==
The prime minister was originally an appointed office, subsidiary to the head of state, and the nominal leader of the Iraqi parliament. Under the 2005 constitution the prime minister is the country&#x27;s active executive authority. Nouri al-Maliki (formerly Jawad al-Maliki) was selected to be prime minister on 21 April 2006. On 14 August 2014, al-Maliki agreed to step down as prime minister of Iraq to allow Haider al-Abadi to take his place. On 25 October 2018, Adil Abdul-Mahdi was sworn into office five months after the 2018 elections until his resignation in 2019. He was once again appointed, this time as a caretaker prime minister due to political dispute. Abdul-Mahdi was replaced by Mustafa Al-Kadhimi, who was approved by the parliament on 7 May 2020. Al-Kadhimi was replaced by Al-Sudani after the 2021 Iraqi parliamentary election.

== Appointment ==
After an election, the Council of Representatives elects the president of the Republic and his deputies, including the president of the Council of Ministers. The Presidency Council must then name a prime minister unanimously within two weeks. If it fails to do so, then the responsibility of naming the prime minister reverts to the National Assembly. In that event, the Council of Representatives must confirm the nomination by an absolute majority. If the prime minister is unable to nominate his Council of Ministers within one month, the Presidency Council must name another prime minister.

Though not official, the appointment to the post has needed at least tacit approval from both the United States and Iran in recent times due to the influence of those countries on Iraqi politics.

==Agencies directly subordinate==
The Counter Terrorism Bureau, National Intelligence Service, National Security Service, Falcons Intelligence Cell, and Popular Mobilization Commission report to the prime minister directly. The Iraqi CTB oversees the Iraqi Counter Terrorism Command, a formation that includes all Iraqi Special Operations Forces. As of 30 June 2009, there had been legislation in progress for a year to make the Iraqi CTB a separate ministry.

== Seat ==
The prime minister&#x27;s office is located in the Al Zaqura Building in the Green Zone, Baghdad.

<text>The armored cruiser was a type of warship of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It was designed like other types of cruisers to operate as a long-range, independent warship, capable of defeating any ship apart from a pre-dreadnought battleship and fast enough to outrun any battleship it encountered.

For many decades, naval technology had not advanced far enough for designers to produce a cruiser that combined an armored belt with the long-range and high speed required to fulfill its mission. For this reason, beginning in the 1880s and 1890s, many navies preferred to build protected cruisers, which only relied on a lightly armored deck to protect the vital parts of the ship. However, by the late 1880s, the development of modern rapid-fire breech-loading cannons and high-explosive shells made the reintroduction of side armor a necessity. The invention of face-hardened armor in the mid-1890s offered effective protection with less weight than previously.

Varying in size, the armored cruiser was distinguished from other types of cruiser by its belt armor—thick iron (or later steel) plating on much of the hull to protect the ship from shellfire much like that on battleships. The first armored cruiser, the Imperial Russian Navy&#x27;s , was launched in 1873 and combined sail and steam propulsion. By the 1890s, cruisers had abandoned sail and took on a modern appearance.

In 1908, the armored cruiser was supplanted by the battlecruiser, which, with armament equivalent to that of a dreadnought battleship and speed equivalent to that of a cruiser, was faster and more powerful than an armored cruiser. At around the same time there was a successor to the protected cruiser, the &quot;light cruiser&quot; which described small cruisers with armored belts. Although they were now considered second-rate ships, armored cruisers were still widely used in World War I due to their speed and range, and being able to outgun all but battlecruisers and battleships (both pre-dreadnought and dreadnought types). Most surviving armored cruisers from this conflict were scrapped under the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922, which imposed limits on warships and defined a cruiser as a ship of 10,000 tons or less carrying guns of 8-inch caliber or less—rather smaller than many of the large armored cruisers. A handful survived in one form or another until World War II. Only one, the Greek Navy&#x27;s &quot;Georgios Averof&quot;, has survived to the modern day as a museum ship.

==History==
===Background===
The armored cruiser was developed in the 1870s as an attempt to combine the virtues of the armored ironclad warship and the fast and long-ranged, but unarmored, cruisers of the time. Such a ship was desirable to protect overseas trade and, especially for the French and British, to police their vast overseas empires. The concern within higher naval circles was that without ships that could fulfill these requirements and incorporate new technology, their fleet would become obsolete and ineffective should a war at sea arise. Concern over obsolescence in official circles was further fueled by the race between the increasing size of naval guns and of armor strong enough to withstand such fire. In 1860, one of the largest naval cannons in standard use had a bore of and fired a solid shot or approximately spherical shell. By 1884, guns with as wide a bore as , firing an exploding shell, were being mounted on naval vessels. This gun could penetrate up to 34 inches of wrought iron, the earliest form of naval armor. These were muzzle-loading guns, as had been used on ships from the 1500s. Breech-loading cannon, which were readopted into naval use in the 1870s, were more destructive than muzzle loaders due to their higher rate of fire. The development of rifled cannon, which improved accuracy, and advancements in shells were other factors. Although a cruiser would not likely face the largest-caliber guns of a battleship and many navies commonly used smaller weapons as they did not wear out as fast as larger ones did, cruisers still needed some form of protection to preclude being shot to pieces.

The adoption of rolled iron armor in 1865 and sandwich armor in 1870 gave ships a chance to withstand fire from larger guns. Both these protective schemes used wood as an important component, which made them extremely heavy and limited speed, the key factor in a cruiser&#x27;s ability to perform its duties satisfactorily. While the first ocean-going ironclads had been launched around 1860, the &quot;station ironclads&quot; built for long-range colonial service such as the British and French were too slow, at 13 and 11 knots respectively, to raid enemy commerce or hunt down enemy commerce raiders, tasks usually assigned to frigates or corvettes. Powered by both sail and steam but without the additional weight of armor, these ships could reach speeds of up to 16 or 17 knots. The most powerful among them were the British , the U.S. Navy&#x27;s and the French . The British especially had hoped to rely on these vessels to serve the more distant reaches of its empire. In the aftermath of the Battle of Hampton Roads in 1862, where United States wooden warships were defeated by the Confederate ironclad , the Admiralty realized that its ships could theoretically encounter an ironclad in any theater of operation.

Ship propulsion was improving but was also taking time to develop. Naval engines in the 1860s were single-expansion types, in which steam was expanded into a cylinder, pushed a piston and was released. Compounding, where steam is passed through a series of cylinders of increasing size before being released, was a more efficient process; it allowed the steam to generate more energy and use less coal to go the same distance. With greater efficiency came increasingly complex machinery and the larger potential for breakdown. However, advances in metallurgy and engineering, the potential for smaller bunkerage and the successful use of compounding in commercial engines made it an attractive option for naval engines, as well. By the 1870s, compound engines had become standard for warships. Compounding by itself did not increase power or speed significantly, although it allowed for a much greater operating range. Forced-draught systems would help increase power and speed but would not come into use until the early 1890s.

===1870s: First armored cruisers===
The Russian navy became the first to produce an armored warship intended for commerce raiding, with , begun in 1870 and launched in 1873, often referred to as the first armored cruiser. Armed with six and two guns, she and her sister were not fully armored but protected only by a narrow belt along the waterline. This belt, moreover, was so heavy that it sat below the ships&#x27; waterlines, which limited its benefit still further. Since they were iron-hulled, however, they were more durable than their wooden counterparts. With a top speed of only and a high coal consumption, which necessitated a full sailing rig, they were not really suited for the role of cruiser. Nevertheless, these ships were considered a new threat to British commerce in the event of war, the rationale being that any vessel, regardless of its speed, could technically be a threat to overseas commerce.

The British responded with , begun in 1873, launched in 1875 and armed with two and seven rifled guns. Two ships of the followed, armed with four 10-inch and eight 9-inch guns. These early armored cruisers were essentially scaled-down versions of the first-rate ironclad warships of the time and, like their Russian counterparts, were essentially belted cruisers. Their 9-inch belts were thicker than that of the Russians but did not extend the full length of the hull due to weight but tapered off at both ends. Past this belt, the designers placed a armored deck, situated deepest in the ships, to guard magazines and machinery against plunging fire. Above this deck, space was allocated for coal bunkers and storerooms. These areas served a two-fold purpose. The bunkers served as added protection, since two feet of coal was considered the equivalent of one foot of steel. Also, if either of the ships became flooded from battle damage, it was hoped the contents of the bunkers and storerooms would aid in their continued buoyancy. Because of this unarmored protection, these ships could be considered the first protected cruisers. However, these ships also shared the liabilities of the Russian ones and because of this, the British Navy was never happy with them. &quot;Shannon&quot;″s top speed of and &quot;Nelson&quot;″s of made them too slow to deal with fast cruisers and they were not armored well enough to take on a first-class battleship. Their armor belts also sat below the ships&#x27; waterlines, which made them of limited benefit.

The underlying problem with these early warships was that technology had not caught up to the demands being made of them; therefore, they represented a series of compromises and could not be fully effective. They were typically powered by double-expansion steam engines fed by boilers which generated steam at perhaps 60 or 70 psi pressure, which gave relatively poor efficiency and short range. Even with improved engines, the dearth of overseas refueling stations made a full sailing rig a necessity. As sailing ships required a high freeboard and a large degree of stability, the use of armored turrets as used on monitors and some battleships was ruled out, because a turret was a very heavy weight high in the ship and its placement necessitated a lower freeboard than was warranted for an oceangoing vessel. (The loss of in 1870 with nearly all of her 500-man crew illustrated graphically what could happen in a heavy sea with a steam-and-sail turret ship.) Consequently, armored cruisers retained a more traditional broadside arrangement. Their armor was distributed in a thick belt around the waterline along most of their length; the gun positions on deck were not necessarily armored at all. The limitations of these ships would not be rectified fully until decades after their construction.

Meanwhile, a battle in May 1877 between the British unarmored cruiser and the Peruvian monitor demonstrated the need for more and better-protected cruisers. &quot;Shah&quot; and the smaller wooden corvette hit &quot;Huáscar&quot; more than 50 times without causing significant damage. The Peruvian ship had an inexperienced crew unused to its cumbersome machinery, and managed to fire only six rounds, all of which missed. The engagement demonstrated the value of cruisers with armor protection.

===Rise of the protected cruiser in the 1880s===
During the 1870s, the rapid increase in the size and power of armor-piercing guns caused problems for the designers of battleships and cruisers alike. Even a ship designed with adequate armor protection from the current generation of guns might be vulnerable to new guns powerful enough to penetrate its armor. Consequently, naval designers tried a novel method of armoring their ships. The vital parts—engines, boilers, magazines and enough hull structure to keep the ship stable in the event of damage—could be positioned underneath an armored deck just below the waterline. This deck, which would only be struck very obliquely by shells, could be thinner and lighter than belt armor. The sides of the ship would be entirely unarmored but would be as effective as an armored belt which would not stop shellfire. Cruisers designed along these guidelines, known as protected cruisers, superseded armored cruisers in the 1880s and early 1890s.

As mentioned earlier, the armored cruiser &quot;Shannon&quot; was the first ship to make use of an armored deck. However, by the end of the 1870s, ships could be found with full–length armored decks and little or no side armor. The Italian of very fast battleships had armored decks and guns but no side armor. The British used a full-length armored deck in their of corvettes started in 1878; however the &quot;Comus&quot; class were designed for colonial service and were only capable of speed, not fast enough for commerce protection or fleet duties.

The breakthrough for the protected cruiser design came with the Chilean , designed and built by the British firm Armstrong at their Elswick yard. &quot;Esmeralda&quot;, with a high speed of , dispensed entirely with sails and carried an armament of two 10-inch and six 6-inch guns, considered very powerful for a ship her size. Her protection scheme, inspired by the &quot;Italia&quot; class, included a full–length protected deck up to thick, and a cork-filled cofferdam along her sides. &quot;Esmeralda&quot; set the tone for cruiser construction for the years to come, with &quot;Elswick cruisers&quot; on a similar design being constructed for Italy, China, Japan, Argentina, Austria and the United States. Protected cruisers became attractive for two reasons. First, the concept of the armored cruiser was not embraced wholeheartedly in naval circles. Second, several navies were caught in a race between armor thickness and the size of main guns and did not have the money to spend on battleships and armored cruisers. The use of smaller, cheaper cruisers was a better alternative.
The French navy adopted the protected cruiser wholeheartedly in the 1880s. The &quot;Jeune Ecole&quot; school of thought, which proposed a navy composed of fast cruisers for commerce raiding and torpedo-boats for coast defense, was particularly influential in France. The first French protected cruiser was , laid down in 1882, and followed by six classes of protected cruiser – and no armored cruisers until , laid down in 1888 but not finished until 1895. &quot;Dupuy de Lôme&quot; was a revolutionary ship, being the first French armored cruiser to dispose entirely of masts, and sheathed in steel armor. However, she and two others were not sufficiently seaworthy, and their armor could be penetrated by modern quick-firing guns. Thus from 1891 to 1897 the French reverted to the construction of protected cruisers.

The British Royal Navy was equivocal about which protection scheme to use until 1887. The large , begun in 1881 and finished in 1886, were built as armored cruisers but were often referred to as protected cruisers. While they carried an armored belt some 10 in thick, the belt only covered of the length of the ship, and was submerged below the waterline at full load. The real protection of the class came from the armored deck thick, and the arrangement of coal bunkers to prevent flooding. These ships were also the last armored cruisers to be designed with sails. However, on trials it became clear that the masts and sails did more harm than good; they were removed and replaced by a single military mast with machine guns.
The next class of small cruisers in the Royal Navy, the , were protected cruisers, but the Royal Navy then returned to the armored cruiser with the , begun in 1885 and completed in 1889. The navy judged the &quot;Orlando&quot;s inferior to protected cruisers and built exclusively protected cruisers immediately afterwards, including some very large, fast ships like the 14,000-ton . However, the &quot;Orlando&quot;s were the first class of cruiser to use the triple-expansion engine. Because this type of reciprocating engine used the steam in three stages, it was more fuel-efficient than earlier compound engines. It also used steam of higher pressure, 60 poundforce per square inch, as compared to the 25 to 30 poundforce in earlier engines. With these engineering developments, warships could now dispense with sails and be entirely steam-driven.

The only major naval power to retain a preference for armored cruisers during the 1880s was Russia. The Russian Navy laid down four armored cruisers and one protected cruiser during the decade, all being large ships with sails.

===Armored cruisers in the pre-dreadnought era===
The development of rapid–fire cannons in the late 1880s forced a change in cruiser design. Since a large number of hits at or near the waterline could negate the effect of water–excluding material used in protected cruisers, side armor again became a priority. Four inches (c. 10 cm) was considered adequate. However, it had to cover not just guns and the waterline but also much of the hull structure in–between; otherwise, the equally new high–explosive shells could penetrate and destroy much of the unarmored portion of the ship. Another development was the publication in 1890 of American naval strategist Alfred Thayer Mahan&#x27;s book &quot;The Influence of Sea Power upon History&quot;. While Mahan emphasized the importance of battleships above all other types of warships in obtaining command of the sea, armored cruisers and large protected cruisers could still be used as second-class battleships to maintain control of the sea lanes and potentially as fighting units of a battle fleet.

The armored cruisers built in the mid– to late–1890s were often as large and expensive as pre-dreadnought battleships. They combined long range, high speed and an armament approaching that of battleship with enough armor to protect them against quick-firing guns, considered the most important weapons afloat at the time. Their speed was made possible due to another development, case-hardened steel armor—first Harvey armor and then crucially Krupp armor. The higher tensile strength of these armors compared to nickel steel and mild steel made it feasible to put a light yet useful armor belt on a large cruiser. They saved further weight by not requiring a heavy timber backing, as previous armor plating had, to soften and spread the force of the impact from oncoming shells; of teak to give a fair surface upon which to attach them was all that was needed. Moreover, this belt could also be much wider than previously, covering the center of the hull, where the ammunition and engines were located, from the main deck to five feet below the waterline. Steel bulkheads added strength to the hull, while armor as thick as the belt covered the guns and heavier protection surrounded the conning tower. With these improvements, the ships became more fully protected than was possible previously. They were also expensive to maintain at fighting strength as they required a greater number of stokers to feed the boilers than a battleship when steaming at flank speed.
The ideas presented by Mahan prompted French Admiral Ernest François Fournier to write his book &quot;La flotte necessaire&quot; in 1896. Fournier argued that a fleet of technologically advanced armored cruisers and torpedo craft would be powerful and flexible enough to engage in a wide range of activity and overwhelm potential enemies. French naval and government circles embraced this ideal mutually and even advocates of battleships over cruisers admitted the latter&#x27;s potential usefulness in scouting and commercial warfare. The result was the building of increasingly large armored cruisers. , laid down in 1896, displaced 11,000 tons, carried a mixed armament of and guns, and had a belt of Harvey armor over her machinery spaces. The 12,300-ton and 14,000-ton followed. With a speed of 22.5 knots, the &quot;Léon Gambetta&quot;s were armed with four guns in twin turrets and 16 in four single and six twin turrets and were protected by up to of Krupp belt armor and nearly on their conning towers and turrets. The &quot;Edgar Quinet&quot;s, slightly faster at 23 knots, were armed with 14 guns and carried up to of armor on their belts, almost on their decks and on their turrets.
Britain, which had concluded as early as 1892 that it needed twice as many cruisers as any potential enemy to adequately protect its empire&#x27;s sea lanes, responded to the perceived threat from France, Russia and, increasingly, Germany with a resumption of armored cruiser construction in 1898 with the . At 21 knots, the &quot;Cressy&quot;s were slower than the newer French cruisers. However, their belt of Krupp steel was expected to keep out armor-piercing shells from a quick-firing gun at likely battle ranges, while their two 9.2-inch (233.7 mm) and 12 6-inch (152 mm) guns offered comparable firepower. The 2,500-ton weight of their belt armor was an improvement over the 1809 tons of the otherwise similar and very similar to that of the of battleships. The &quot;Cressy&quot;s were the beginning of a rapid expansion in British cruiser construction. Between 1899 and 1905, seven classes of armored cruisers were either completed or laid down, a total of 35 ships.
Japan, which now received British technical assistance in naval matters and purchased larger vessels from France and Britain, began an armored cruiser program of its own. With the end of the First Sino-Japanese War in 1895 and the return under pressure from Russia (in what became known as the &quot;Triple Intervention&quot;) of the Liaotung peninsula to China, Japan began a 10-year naval build-up program, under the slogan &quot;Perseverance and determination&quot; (, Gashinshōtan) in preparation for further confrontations. The core of this 109-ship build-up was the &quot;Six-Six Program&quot; of six battleships and six (eventually eight) armored cruisers comparable to the British &quot;Cressy&quot; class. followed the basic pattern for these cruisers—on a displacement, she carried four  and twelve  guns, was protected by a main belt, armored deck and turret armor and steamed at . They were considered a compromise between cruiser and battleship and were intended to augment capital ship strength in battle squadrons. This practice would persist until World War I.
The first United States armored cruiser, , was launched in 1889 but not completed until 1895 due to a three-year delay in the delivery of her armor plate. Armed with four guns, mounted en echelon (with the fore turret sponsoned to starboard and the aft turret to port) to allow end-on fire for both turrets, and six guns on broadside, she carried between 7 and 12 inches (178 to 305 mm) of belt armor and between 1 and 4 inches (25 to 102 mm) on her decks. However, &quot;Maine&quot; was laid down before Harvey or Krupp armor was available and could not benefit from the advantage in weight these much lighter armors offered. She was redesignated a &quot;second-class battleship&quot; in 1894, an awkward compromise reflecting that, at 16.45 knots, she was considerably slower than other cruisers and weaker than first-line battleships. Her destruction in Havana harbor in 1898 was a catalyst in starting the Spanish–American War.
&quot;Maine″s&quot; immediate successors, and , launched in 1895 and 1896 respectively, carried thinner but newer armor than &quot;Maine&quot;, with on her belt and 3 to 6 inches (76 to 152 mm) on her deck but better protected overall against rapid-fire weaponry. Their armor was comparable in thickness to that of &quot;Dupuy de Lôme&quot; but the French ship&#x27;s armor covered a much greater area of the hull. The hull protection of both ships was superior to their main rival, the British , which were the largest cruisers at the time but had no side armor. Armed with six guns, &quot;New York&quot; carried more heavy weapons than the French ship. Moreover, &quot;New York&quot;″s builder diverged from the Navy blueprint by rearranging her boilers during construction; this allowed the installation of additional transverse and longitudinal bulkheads, which increased her underwater protection. &quot;Brooklyn&quot; was an improved version of the &quot;New York&quot; and designs, more heavily armed (with eight and 12 guns) and with better sea-keeping abilities through the addition of a forecastle. After these two ships, the Navy concentrated on battleship construction until the Spanish–American War showed how cruisers could be &quot;useful,&quot; in the words of General J. B. Crabtree, &quot;and [showed] how desirable others would be.&quot;
Shortly after the war ended, the Navy laid down six armored cruisers to take advantage of lessons learned and better control the large sea areas the nation had just gained. Much larger than their predecessors (displacing 14,500 tons as compared to 8150 for &quot;New York&quot;), the &quot;Pennsylvania&quot;s &quot;were closer to light battleships than to cruisers,&quot; according to naval historian William Friedman. They carried four and 14 guns, of armor on their belts, on their turrets and on their conning towers. Their deck armor was light at for flat surfaces and for sloped, a compromise made for faster speed (22 knots, compared with 20 knots for &quot;Brooklyn&quot;). Improved ammunition made their main guns as powerful as the guns of the battleship and their use of state instead of city names, usually reserved for capital ships, emphasized their kinship.

The Spanish-American and First Sino-Japanese wars proved instrumental in spurring cruiser growth among all the major naval powers, according to naval historian Eric Osborne, &quot;as they showcased the abilities of the modern ships in warfare.&quot; The only time cruisers were seen in any of their traditional role, he continues, was as blockade ships during the Spanish–American War. More often, they were seen fighting in a battle line. They would not been seen in their designed role until World War I.

Even with all their improvements and apparent performance, opinion on the armored cruiser was mixed. The 1904 edition of the &quot;Encyclopedia Americana&quot; quotes an otherwise unidentified Captain Walker, USN, in describing the role of the armored cruiser as &quot;that of a vessel possessing in a high degree offensive and defensive qualities, with the capacity of delivering her attack at points far distant from her base in the least space of time.&quot; The same source defines an armored cruiser as &quot;a battleship in which the qualities of offense and defense have been much reduced to gain high speed and great coal capacity&quot; and adds, &quot;... there are many who hold that the armored cruiser is an anomaly, something less than a battleship and more than a protected cruiser, performing satisfactorily the duties of neither, with no special function of her own and lacking the great in warships, ability to fight in proportion to her great size and cost.&quot; By 1914 the U.S. Navy in hearings before the House of Representatives gave testimony to the effect that no armored cruisers were further planned nor to it knowledge were armored cruisers being built by any major naval power worldwide.

===Battle of Tsushima and final developments===

Armored cruisers were used with success in the line of battle by the Japanese at the Battle of Tsushima in 1905. Of the battle damage received by the Japanese, the armored cruiser received eight hits, which destroyed three of her guns, killed five crew members and injured 90 more (one of the wounded being Isoroku Yamamoto, who would later plan the attack on Pearl Harbor). None of the other Japanese armored cruisers suffered serious damage or large loss of life. was hit 16 times but no one onboard was killed and only 15 were wounded. Except for , all the cruisers present at Tsushima that morning were still battle-ready in the evening.

The performance of the Japanese armored cruisers led to a boom in the construction of armored cruisers in the world&#x27;s navies as some naval authorities concluded that the armored cruiser&#x27;s superior speed could ensure survivability in a naval action against battleships; they did not take into account the Russian Baltic Fleet&#x27;s inefficiency and tactical ineptitude during the battle. First Sea Lord &quot;Jacky&quot; Fisher, an advocate of armored cruisers as more useful than battleships to safeguard British trade and territorial interests, saw his efforts justified; his belief that &quot;speed is armor&quot; would lead him to create the battlecruiser. Danish Navy Commander William Hovgaard, who would later become president of New York Shipbuilding and serve on the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Battleship Design Advisory Board, a group which would help plan the fast battleships in the 1930s, said, &quot;The fighting capacity of the armored cruiser has reached a point which renders its participation in future fleet actions almost a certainty&quot; and called for a &quot;battleship-cruiser&quot; which would possess the speed of a cruiser and the firepower of a capital ship Other naval authorities remained skeptical. Mahan called the interest in armored cruisers &quot;a fad,&quot; then explained:

She is armored, and she is a cruiser; and what have you got? A ship to &quot;lie in the line&quot;? as our ancestors used to say. No, and Yes; that is to say, she may at a pinch, and at a risk that exceeds her powers. A cruiser? Yes, and No; for, order to give her armor and armament which do not fit the line, you have given tonnage beyond what is needed for the speed and coal endurance proper for a cruiser. By giving this tonnage to armor and armament you have taken it from other uses; either from increasing her own speed and endurance, or from providing another cruiser. You have in her more cruiser than she ought to have and less armored vessel, or less cruiser and more armored ship. I do not call this a combination, though I do call it a compromise... I do not say you have a useless ship. I do say that you have not as useful a ship as, for the tonnage, you ought to have.
Buoyed with their success at Tsushima, Japan laid down the four s between 1905 and 1908. At a speed of 20.5 knots, they carried an extremely heavy main armament of four guns, of belt and turret armor and of deck armor. The &quot;Tsukuba&quot;s were intended to take the place of aging battleships and thus showed Japan&#x27;s intention of continuing to use armored cruisers in fleet engagements. The U.S. Navy raised the main gun caliber of its cruisers with its , laid down between 1902 and 1904. These mounted four and 16 guns, the former a size previously allocated to battleships. While they had thinner armor than the &quot;Pennsylvania&quot;s ( on their belts and on their decks) due to newly imposed congressional restraints on tonnage, they could still steam at 22 knots. They were built as a fast, powerful response in the eventuality of a Pacific war and were the largest and last American armored cruisers built.
The British also considered and guns for its cruisers, the culmination of its armored cruiser building program. They displaced 14,600 tons, were capable of 23 knots and were armed with four and 10 guns. By the time these ships were commissioned, Britain possessed the largest armored cruiser force in the world. Undaunted and fully engaged in a naval arms race with the British, the Germans also continued to build armored cruisers, partly from their faith in them as fighting units and commerce raiders, partly from Japan&#x27;s success. Between 1897 and 1906 they laid down eight of them for use on overseas stations. The initial two, and , were armed with guns; the six that followed had guns of a more modern design. The final pair, and , displaced 12,781 tons, steamed at 23.5 knots, carried of belt and of deck armor and were armed with eight guns.

Another powerful armored cruiser was the Russian , completed in 1908. Armed with four in two twin turrets fore and aft and eight in turrets along the ship&#x27;s sides, she displaced 15,190 tons and carried a belt, two armored decks and armor on her turrets and conning tower. Her top speed was 21 knots. &quot;Rurik&quot; was unusual in that she was Russian designed but British built; the Russian Navy was not usually a customer of British shipyards. She was reportedly one of the best armored cruisers built, with an advanced sprinkler protection for the magazines. Intended as the first of a three-ship class, &quot;Rurik&quot;″s sisters were cancelled with the advent of the battlecruiser .
&quot;The supreme embodiment of the armored cruiser,&quot; in historian Robert K. Massie&#x27;s words, was the German ship . An enlarged version of the &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; class with a speed of 24.25 knots, armed with 12 and eight guns, &quot;Blücher&quot; was planned as an armored cruiser in part because the British had misled the Germans on the &quot;Invincible&quot;s then being constructed. The Germans expected these new British ships to be armed with six or eight guns. One week after the final decision to construct &quot;Blücher&quot;, the German naval attache learned they would carry eight guns, the same type mounted on battleships. With no funds available to redesign &quot;Blücher&quot;, work was ordered to proceed as scheduled. Although much more powerful than a typical armored cruiser, she was significantly weaker than the new British battlecruisers.

===Appearance of the battlecruiser===
By the time these new armored cruisers were entering service, such types of ships had reached the end of its development. Tactics and technology favored fighting power over long to medium ranges, which demanded an armament of primarily large caliber guns and a speed higher than that of battleships, preferably by at least 30 percent, to fulfill its traditional role as scout for the fleet and the newly acquired one of participating with battleships in a naval encounter. Thirty percent was the ratio by which frigates had been faster than ships of the line in the days of sail. If a battleship sailed at 20 knots, this would mean that an armored cruiser would have to steam at least 26 or 27 knots. To fulfill these criteria, however, armored cruisers would have to be built much larger and take on a different form than they had in the past. The battlecruiser HMS &quot;Invincible&quot; and her two sister ships were designed specifically to fulfill these requirements. In a sense they were an extension of the armored cruiser as a fast, heavily armed scout, commerce protector and cruiser-destroyer, reflected in the term originally ascribed to them, &quot;large armored cruiser.&quot; However, the battlecruisers were much larger than armored cruisers, allowing them to be faster, more heavily armed, and better-protected, so battlecruisers were able to outpace armored cruisers, stay out of range of their weapons and destroy them with relative impunity. Because they carried the heavy guns normally ascribed to battleships, they could also theoretically hold their place in a battle line more readily than armored cruisers and serve as the &quot;battleship-cruiser&quot; for which Hovgaard had argued after Tsushima. All these factors made battlecruisers attractive fighting units, although Britain, Germany and Japan would be the only powers to build them. They also meant that the armored cruiser as it had been known was now outmoded and no more were built after 1910. The United States Naval Institute put the matter bluntly in its 1908 written proceedings:

It is very doubtful if an armored cruiser of the &quot;Colorado&quot; class would dare even tackle a monitor, for fear that one of the latter&#x27;s shot &quot;might&quot; hit a vital spot, and if it did she would lose her only raison d&#x27;etre, for a crippled cruiser would be useless as a cruiser, and still not fit to &quot;lie in the line.&quot;... It may be urged that an armored cruiser was never intended to fight a battleship. Then what &quot;is&quot; she intended for? Surely not as a scout or a commerce destroyer, for vessels a fifth the displacement could do this work as well, and numbers are required here, not strength... If she is to overtake a weaker enemy, you must first assume a smaller enemy, otherwise she could not have superiority in both speed and strength. By escaping from a stronger enemy she will never win wars.

Later in the same address is this: &quot;Every argument used against [armored cruisers] holds true for battle-cruisers of the &quot;Invincible&quot; type, except that the latter, if wounded, would be fit to lie in the line, owing to her great armament. If it is hoped to fight at such great ranges that her 7-inch belt and 5-inch side will be of value, then the armor of battleships is wrong, not in principle, but in distribution.&quot;

===World War I===
Although pre-dreadnought battleships and armored cruisers were outclassed by modern battleship and battlecruiser designs, respectively, armored cruisers still played an active role in World War I. Their armor and firepower was sufficient to defeat other cruiser types and armed merchant vessels, while their speed and range made them particularly useful for extended operations out in the high seas. Some German and Royal Navy vessels, like , were allocated to remote naval squadrons. Many other vessels however, were formed into independent squadrons for patrolling European waters and accompanied capital ships every time the latter made forays out of port.

At the Battle of Coronel, the German armored cruisers and scored a resounding victory over British naval forces from the West Indies Station. With newer ships, superior gunnery and optimal logistics, the Germans sank the Royal Navy armored cruisers and , with the loss of over 1,500 British sailors and officers (including Rear-Admiral Christopher Cradock). This was one of the last battles involving armored cruisers as the chief adversaries; all subsequent engagements were dominated by battlecruisers and dreadnought battleships. Moreover, the timing could not have been worse for British morale. Six weeks earlier, the armored cruisers , and had all been sunk on the same day by the German submarine U-9.

Five weeks later, the Battle of the Falkland Islands showed graphically how much technology and tactics had changed. SMS &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; and SMS &quot;Gneisenau&quot; were sunk by a British force of the battlecruisers HMS &quot;Invincible&quot; and , three armoured cruisers and two light cruisers. The German armored cruisers were too slow to outrun their pursuers, and their initially accurate gunnery failed to inflict serious damage on the British battlecruisers. The British 12-inch guns turned the tide of battle once they started scoring hits on the Germans, and the German armored cruisers were fatally crippled before they had a chance to close the range and use their superior secondary armament. This victory seemed to validate Lord &quot;Jacky&quot; Fisher&#x27;s justification in building battlecruisers—to track down and destroy armored cruisers with vessels possessing superior speed and firepower. The German force commander Admiral Maximilian von Spee had been wary of the Allies&#x27; battlecruisers, especially the Imperial Japanese Navy and the Royal Australian Navy—in fact he described the latter&#x27;s flagship, the battlecruiser , as being superior to his entire force by itself. At the Falklands, he had already deduced the battle was lost when he missed the chance to attack the British battlecruisers in port.

During the Battle of Dogger Bank, &quot;Blücher&quot; was crippled by a shell from a British battlecruiser, which slowed &quot;Blücher&quot; to 17 knots and eventually sealed her fate. Admiral Franz von Hipper chose to let &quot;Blücher&quot; go down so his more valuable battlecruisers could escape.

, and were lost at the Battle of Jutland when they inadvertently came into sight and range of the German Navy&#x27;s battle line, which included several battlecruisers and dreadnought battleships. The armor belt was shown to be far less than required to survive the 280mm (11 inch) and 300 mm (12 inch) shells of more modern dreadnoughts and battlecruisers and the cruisers were too slow to get away from them. The final nail in the coffin for the armored cruiser type was in the development of capped armor-piercing shells. The Harvey and Krupp Cemented armor that had looked to offer protection failed when hit with soft capped AP shells of large enough size. Later hard capped AP shell would only make the matter worse.

===Post-World War I===

After the end of World War I, many of the surviving armored cruisers were sold for scrap. The Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 placed strict limits on the numbers of &quot;capital ships&quot; possessed by the navies of the great powers. A &quot;capital ship&quot; was defined as any vessel of over 10,000 tons displacement or with guns over 8-in caliber, and several more armored cruisers were decommissioned to comply with the terms of the treaty. The London Naval Treaty of 1930 introduced further limits on cruiser tonnage, and the former role of the armored cruiser was occupied by more modern light cruisers and heavy cruisers (and, in the case of the German navy, panzerschiffe).

Only a small number of armored cruisers survived these limitations, though a handful saw action in World War II in marginal roles;

The Hellenic Navy&#x27;s , constructed in 1909, served with the British Navy as a convoy escort in the Indian Ocean after the fall of Greece, while a number of Japanese armored cruisers were still active as minelayers or training vessels.

The Imperial Japanese Navy armored cruisers &quot;Asama&quot;, &quot;Izumo&quot;, &quot;Tokiwa&quot;, &quot;Iwate&quot;, &quot;Yakumo&quot;, &quot;Azuma&quot;, &amp; &quot;Kasuga&quot; were used as training, support, and anti-aircraft ships during the war near the Japanese home islands. Most were sunk by Allied bombings in Japanese harbors.

The Regia Marina&#x27;s &quot;San Giorgio&quot; was deployed to Spain to protected Italian interests during the Spanish Civil War. During World War II, she was heavily utilized at the Siege of Tobruk. There she provided anti-aircraft cover and naval gunfire support to Italian units. She was heavily damaged by British aircraft and was scuttled to prevent her capture. Her sister ship, &quot;San Marco&quot; was decommissioned in 1931 and used as a radio controlled target ship. In 1943, she was scuttled to prevent her capture by the Germans.

The United States Navy&#x27;s USS &quot;Rochester&quot;, decommissioned since 1933, was moored in Subic Bay and used as a receiving ship and anti-aircraft platform. She was later scuttled to prevent her capture by the Japanese during the Invasion of The Philippines.

The Argentine Navy&#x27;s ARA &quot;General Belgrano&quot; and ARA &quot;Pueyrredón&quot; served until 1947 and 1954 respectfully.

The Swedish Navy&#x27;s HSwMS &quot;Fylgia&quot; underwent an extensive modernization from 1939 to 1940 and conducted neutrality patrols in the Baltic Sea during World War II. She continued service until 1953.

The only armored cruiser still considered to be in existence, as well as in active duty, is the aforementioned &quot;Georgios Averof&quot;, preserved as a museum in Palaio Faliro, Greece.

==Differences with heavy cruisers==

The armored cruiser was not a close ancestor of heavy cruisers, even though the name might suggest this. The armored cruiser type had come about in a time of transition as one technology after another presented itself. Boilers had become better (though still in need of improvement), and Krupp cemented armor and compound steam engines had arrived. The rate of change was nothing less than staggering and any ship more than 20 years old was found to be completely obsolete. The Italian Navy, unable to afford battleships, produced the &quot;Garibaldi&quot;-class cruiser of 7,500 tons displacement which was an international success. William H. White DNC of the British Royal Navy was taken by the design and presented the design for the &quot;Cressy&quot;-class cruiser of 12,000 tons displacement designed from the onset as an adjunct to the pre-dreadnought battle line, on 3 May 1897. As such the armored cruiser is the direct predecessor of and inspiration for the battlecruiser.

The heavy cruiser was a direct product of the First London Naval Treaty of 1930, which divided cruisers into 2 classes between those with larger than 6.1&quot; main guns and those with smaller main guns with both remaining within the limits of the Washington Naval Treaty which limited cruisers to a standard displacement of no more than 10,000 tons, with main guns not exceeding 8 inches (203 mm) caliber. There were also important technical differences between the heavy cruiser and the armored cruiser, some of which reflected the generational gap between them. Heavy cruisers were typically powered by oil-fired superheated steam boilers and steam turbine engines, and were capable of far faster speeds than armored cruisers (propelled by coal-fired reciprocating steam engines of their era) ever had been. Countries withdrawing from the Washington Treaty and the London Naval Treaty of 1930 and Second London Naval Treaty 1936 eventually rendered all limitations on heavy cruisers moot, although the only supersized or large cruisers actually built were the two members of the &quot;Alaska&quot; class. 

Armored cruisers were often pressed into the main line of battle against battlecruisers and dreadnought battleships (Battle of the Falkland Islands, Battle of Dogger Bank (1915), Battle of Jutland). By contrast, heavy cruisers and light cruisers were not expected to be deployed as such, although there had been some notable engagements (Battle of the Denmark Strait, Battle of Cape Matapan, Naval Battle of Guadalcanal, Battle of Surigao Strait).

<text>In medicine, a shunt is a hole or a small passage that moves, or allows movement of, fluid from one part of the body to another. The term may describe either congenital or acquired shunts; acquired shunts (sometimes referred to as iatrogenic shunts) may be either biological or mechanical.
==Types==
* Cardiac shunts may be described as right-to-left, left-to-right or bidirectional, or as systemic-to-pulmonary or pulmonary-to-systemic.
* Cerebral shunt: In cases of hydrocephalus and other conditions that cause chronic increased intracranial pressure, a one-way valve is used to drain excess cerebrospinal fluid from the brain and carry it to other parts of the body. This valve usually sits outside the skull but beneath the skin, somewhere behind the ear. Cerebral shunts that drain fluid to the peritoneal cavity (located in the upper abdomen) are called &quot;ventriculoperitoneal&quot; (&quot;VP&quot;) shunts.
* Lumbar-peritoneal shunt (a.k.a. &quot;lumboperitoneal&quot;, &quot;LP&quot;): In cases of chronic increased intracranial pressure such as idiopathic intracranial hypertension and hydrocephalus, a tube or shunt with or without a one-way valve is used to drain the excess cerebrospinal fluid from the brain and transport it to the peritoneal cavity. Unlike the ventriculoperitoneal shunt, however, a lumbar-peritoneal shunt is usually inserted in between two of the vertebrae in the lumbar and punctures the cerebrospinal fluid sack or lumbar subarachnoid space, it then runs beneath the skin to the peritoneal cavity, where it is eventually drained away by the normal bodily fluid drainage system.
* A Peritoneovenous shunt: (also called Denver shunt) is a shunt which drains peritoneal fluid from the peritoneum into veins, usually the internal jugular vein or the superior vena cava. It is sometimes used in patients with refractory ascites. It is a long tube with a non-return valve running subcutaneously from the peritoneum to the internal jugular vein in the neck, which allows ascitic fluid to pass directly into the systemic circulation. Possible compilations include bleeding from varices, disseminated intravascular coagulation, infection, superior vena caval thrombosis and pulmonary edema.
* Pulmonary shunts exist when there is normal perfusion to an alveolus, but ventilation fails to supply the perfused region.
* A portosystemic shunt (PSS), also known as a liver shunt, is a bypass of the liver by the body&#x27;s circulatory system. It can be either a congenital or acquired condition. Congenital PSS is an uncommon condition in dogs and cats, found mainly in small dog breeds such as Miniature Schnauzers and Yorkshire Terriers, and in cats such as Persians, Himalayans, and mix breeds. Acquired PSS is also uncommon and is found in older dogs with liver disease causing portal hypertension, especially cirrhosis.
* A portacaval shunt (portal caval shunt) is a treatment for high blood pressure in the liver.
* A transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) is an artificial channel within the liver that establishes communication between the inflow portal vein and the outflow hepatic vein. It is used to treat portal hypertension.
* VASP (Vesicoamniotic shunting procedure): Fetal lower urinary tract outflow obstruction prevents the unborn baby from passing urine. This can result in a reduction in the volume of amniotic fluid, and problems with the development of the baby&#x27;s lungs and kidneys. A vesico–amniotic shunt is a tube that it is inserted into the unborn baby&#x27;s bladder to drain the excess fluid into the surrounding space.

<text>Shoe fetishism is the attribution of attractive sexual qualities to shoes or other footwear as a matter of sexual preference, or an alternative or complement to a relationship with a partner. It has also been known as retifism, after the French novelist Nicolas-Edme Rétif (1734–1806), also known as Rétif de la Bretonne, who wrote a novel about it (presumably based on his own penchants) called &quot;Fanchette&#x27;s Foot&quot;, which preference or penchant seems to have been if not &quot;all the rage&quot; at the time at least known to have been practiced or suffered by more than handsful of somewhat important individuals of that period (pre-Revolutionary France). 

Individuals with shoe fetishism can be erotically interested in women&#x27;s and/or men&#x27;s shoes.

Almost any type of shoe can be fetishized, depending on the sexual connotation associated with the wearer, for example an entire area of gay subculture is devoted towards the fetishization of sneakers and other forms of athletic footwear.

Another fetishism, which sometimes is seen as related to shoe fetishism, is boot fetishism.

Although shoes may appear to carry sexual connotations in mainstream culture (for example, women&#x27;s shoes are commonly sold as being &quot;sexy&quot;), this opinion refers to an ethnographic or cultural context, and is likely not intended to be taken literally.

==Prevalence ==
In order to determine the relative prevalences of different types of fetishes, scientists obtained a sample of at least 5,000 individuals worldwide from 381 discussion groups on the internet. The relative prevalences were estimated based on the number of groups devoted to a particular fetish, the number of individuals participating in the groups and the number of messages exchanged.

Using these measures, feet and shoes were found to be the most common target of preferences. This is consistent with an analysis of millions of search queries by users from the United States that were accidentally released during the AOL search data scandal. 64% of the sampled population that had a preference for an object associated with the body had a preference for shoes, boots, and other footwear.

==Popular culture==

In the 19th century, Central European students drank wine or Champagne from their lady&#x27;s shoe or bootlet as a sign of devotion. The custom is noted in the opera of 1882, &quot;Der Bettelstudent&quot;, where Symon drinks Champagne from Laura&#x27;s shoe at their wedding. In commemoration of this romantic tradition, the French shoe manufacturer Louboutin issued in 2009, a glass shaped like a woman&#x27;s shoe, which was reviewed critically by the German daily, &quot;Die Welt&quot;.

The &quot;Sex and the City&quot; episode, &quot;La Douleur Exquise!&quot;, featured a shoe salesman with a shoe and foot fetish, who allowed Charlotte York to have expensive shoes for free simply for allowing him to assist her in trying on various pairs of open shoes whilst he openly complimented her on the state of her feet and offered her foot reflexology. The relationship came to an end when Charlotte figured out she had been getting discounts because she was letting him hold her feet and was further discomforted by the salesman obviously climaxing while assisting her with the sixth pair of the day.

The movie &quot;There&#x27;s Something About Mary&quot; featured a former boyfriend of Mary, Dom &quot;Woogie&quot; Wooganowski, played by Chris Elliott, with a shoe fetish. He tried to steal her shoes.

In the animated comedy show &quot;Family Guy&quot;, the character Glenn Quagmire has a foot and shoe fetish, among other fetishes. 

In the movie from 1993 in Spanish, &quot;The Bilingual Lover&quot;, written and directed by Vicente Aranda from an adaptation from a novel by Juan Marsé, shoe fetishism pervades the whole story.

In the movie from 1995, &quot;While You Were Sleeping&quot;, starring Sandra Bullock, the main character&#x27;s landlord, played by Michael Rispoli, has a shoe fetish. 

In the television series from 2000 in Japanese, &quot;Bus Stop&quot;, the main character, Musashi, has a strong interest in high heels, and at one point repairs a broken high heel for the woman he is pursuing.

<text>In neurology, the Chiari malformation ( ; CM) is a structural defect in the cerebellum, characterized by a downward displacement of one or both cerebellar tonsils through the foramen magnum (the opening at the base of the skull).

CMs can cause headaches, difficulty swallowing, vomiting, dizziness, neck pain, unsteady gait, poor hand coordination, numbness and tingling of the hands and feet, and speech problems. Less often, people may experience ringing or buzzing in the ears, weakness, slow heart rhythm, or fast heart rhythm, curvature of the spine (scoliosis) related to spinal cord impairment, abnormal breathing, such as central sleep apnea, characterized by periods of breathing cessation during sleep, and, in severe cases, paralysis. CM can sometimes lead to non-communicating hydrocephalus as a result of obstruction of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) outflow. The CSF outflow is caused by phase difference in outflow and influx of blood in the vasculature of the brain.

The malformation is named after the Austrian pathologist Hans Chiari. A type II CM is also known as an Arnold–Chiari malformation after Chiari and German pathologist Julius Arnold.

==Signs and symptoms==
Findings are due to brainstem and lower cranial nerve dysfunction. Onset of symptoms are less likely to be present during adulthood in most patients. Younger children generally have a substantially different presentation of clinical symptoms from older children. Younger children are more likely to have a more rapid neurological degeneration with profound brainstem dysfunction over several days.

Headache is the most common symptom in those with Chiari malformation type 1 (in which only the cerebellar tonsils descend below the foramen magnum). This headache is usually occipital or sub-occipital in location (but may also present in other cranial areas), is usually dull or throbbing in character and is characteristically associated with Valsalva maneuvers (such as bearing down, coughing, sneezing, bending over or forcefully exhaling against a closed airway).

Symptoms that may be due to Chiari malformations include:

* Neurogenic dysphagia: Difficulty swallowing.
* Cyanosis: Bluish discoloration of skin while feeding.
* Weak crying
* Facial weakness
* Aspiration
* Headaches aggravated by Valsalva maneuvers
* Tinnitus (ringing in the ears)
* Lhermitte&#x27;s sign (electrical sensation that runs down the back and into the limbs)
* Vertigo (dizziness)
* Nausea
* Schmahmann&#x27;s syndrome
* Nystagmus (irregular eye movements; typically, so-called &quot;downbeat nystagmus&quot;)
* Facial pain
* Muscle weakness
* Impaired gag reflex
* Dysphagia (difficulty swallowing)
* Restless leg syndrome
* Sleep apnea
* Sleep disorders
* Impaired coordination
* Severe cases may develop all the symptoms and signs of a bulbar palsy
* Paralysis due to pressure at the cervico-medullary junction may progress in a so-called &quot;clockwise&quot; fashion, affecting the right arm, then the right leg, then the left leg, and finally the left arm; or the opposite way around.
* Papilledema on fundoscopic exam due to increased intracranial pressure
* Pupillary dilation
* Dysautonomia: tachycardia (rapid heart), syncope (fainting), polydipsia (extreme thirst), chronic fatigue
* Apnea: Sudden pause of breathing, usually during sleep.
* Opisthotonos: Spasm of the head which causes head to arch backwards. More common in infants than adults.
* Stridor

The blockage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow may also cause a syrinx to form, eventually leading to syringomyelia. Central cord symptoms such as hand weakness, dissociated sensory loss, and, in severe cases, paralysis may occur.

===Syringomyelia===

Syringomyelia is most often chronic progressive degenerative disorder characterized by a fluid-filled cyst located in the spinal cord. However, there can be also cases where the syrinx in terms of size and extent of symptoms actually stays stable throughout a lifetime. Syringomyelia symptoms include pain, weakness, numbness, and stiffness in the back, shoulders, arms or legs. Other symptoms include headaches, the inability to feel changes in the temperature, sweating, sexual dysfunction, and loss of bowel and bladder control. It is usually seen in the cervical region but can extend into the medulla oblongata and pons or it can reach downward into the thoracic or lumbar segments. Syringomyelia is often associated with type I Chiari malformation and is commonly seen between the C-4 and C-6 levels. The exact development of syringomyelia is unknown but many theories suggest that the herniated tonsils in type I Chiari malformations cause a &quot;plug&quot; to form, which does not allow an outlet of CSF from the brain to the spinal canal. Syringomyelia is present in 25% of patients with type I Chiari malformations.

==Pathophysiology==

The most common pathophysiological mechanism by which Chiari type I malformations occurs is due to a congenitally small posterior fossa. Other pathophysiological mechanisms involve increased intracranial pressure above the foramen magnum which causes a downward pressure against the cerebellum, thus causing the cerebellar tonsils to displace below the foramen magnum. Such causes include hydrocephalus (an accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid [CSF] around the brain), space occupying lesions in the brain such as tumors, subdural hematomas or other subdural fluid collections, arachnoid cysts, craniosynostosis (early closure of the cranial sutures)(especially of the lambdoid suture), hyperostosis (an excessive growth of bone) (such as craniometaphyseal dysplasia, osteopetrosis). Another pathophysiological mechanism by which Chiari malformations form is by negative pressure or a pulling force from below the foramen magnum which pulls against the brain, causing the cerebellar tonsils to herniate past the foramen magnum. Causes of this negative or pulling pressure include a tethered cord or an excessively tense Filum terminale, a cerebrospinal fluid leak creating a negative pressure around the spinal cord as the fluid surrounding the cord leaks out, or a CSF-venous fistula, in which the CSF leaks into a nearby vein.

Traumatic brain injury may cause delayed acquired Chiari malformation, but the pathophysiology of this is unknown. Additionally, ectopia may be present but asymptomatic until a whiplash injury causes it to become symptomatic. Other conditions linked to Chiari malformations include X-linked vitamin D-resistant rickets, and neurofibromatosis type I.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis is made through a combination of patient history, neurological examination, and medical imaging. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is considered the preferred imaging modality for Chiari malformation. The MRI visualizes neural tissue such as the cerebellar tonsils and spinal cord as well as bone and other soft tissues. CT and CT myelography are other options and were used prior to the advent of MRI, unfortunately the resolution of CT based modalities do not characterize syringomyelia and other neural abnormalities as well.

By convention, the cerebellar tonsil position is measured relative to the basion-opisthion line, using sagittal T1 MRI images or sagittal CT images. The selected cutoff distance for abnormal tonsil position is somewhat arbitrary, as not every person will be symptomatic at a certain amount of tonsil displacement, and the probability of symptoms and syrinx increases with greater displacement; however, greater than 5 mm is the most frequently cited cutoff number, though some consider 3–5 mm to be &quot;borderline&quot;; pathological signs and syrinx may occur beyond that distance. One study showed little difference in cerebellar tonsil position between standard recumbent MRI and upright MRI for patients without a history of whiplash injury. Neuroradiological investigation is used to first rule out any intracranial condition that could be responsible for tonsillar herniation. Neuroradiological diagnostics evaluate the severity of crowding of the neural structures within the posterior cranial fossa and their pressure against the foramen magnum. Chiari 1.5 is a term used when both brainstem and tonsillar herniation through the foramen magnum are present.

The diagnosis of a Chiari II malformation can be made prenatally, through ultrasound.

===Classification===
In the late 19th century, Austrian pathologist Hans Chiari described seemingly related anomalies of the hindbrain, the so-called Chiari malformations I, II and III. Later, other investigators added a fourth (Chiari IV) malformation. The scale of severity is rated I – IV, with IV being the most severe. Types III and IV are very rare. Since Dr. Chiari&#x27;s original descriptions Chiari 0, 1.5, 3.5, and 5 have been described in the medical literature.

====Types of Chiari malformation====
Other conditions sometimes causally associated with Chiari malformation include hydrocephalus, syringomyelia, spinal curvature, tethered spinal cord syndrome, and connective tissue disorders such as Ehlers–Danlos syndrome and Marfan syndrome.

Chiari malformation is the most frequently used term for this set of conditions. The use of the term &quot;Arnold–Chiari malformation&quot; has fallen somewhat out of favor over time, although it is used to refer to the type II malformation. Current sources use &quot;Chiari malformation&quot; to describe its four specific types, reserving the term &quot;Arnold–Chiari&quot; for type II only. Some sources still use &quot;Arnold–Chiari&quot; for all four types.

Chiari malformation or Arnold–Chiari malformation should not be confused with Budd–Chiari syndrome, a hepatic condition also named for Hans Chiari.

In Pseudo-Chiari Malformation, leaking of CSF may cause displacement of the cerebellar tonsils and similar symptoms sufficient to be mistaken for a Chiari I malformation.

==Treatment==
While there is no current cure, the treatments for Chiari malformation are surgery and management of symptoms. Treatment is directed on the occurrence of clinical symptoms rather than the radiological findings. The presence of a syrinx is known to give specific signs and symptoms that vary from dysesthetic sensations to algothermal dissociation to spasticity and paresis. These are important indications that decompressive surgery is needed for patients with Chiari Malformation Type II. Type II patients have severe brainstem damage and rapidly diminishing neurological response.

Decompressive surgery involves removing the lamina of the first and sometimes the second or third cervical vertebrae and part of the occipital bone of the skull to relieve pressure. The flow of spinal fluid may be augmented by a shunt. The surgery may involve the opening of the dura mater to allow decompression of the brain. A dural graft may be applied to cover the expanded posterior fossa. In those with type I Chiari malformations (especially those with a syrinx), a bone resection with duraplasty (compared to a bone resection without duraplasty) is associated with greater symptom relief and has a higher rate of symptomatic remission, and a lower need for re-operation. However, a bone resection with duraplasty was also associated with a higher rate of surgical complications. Re-operation may be needed in up to 6.8% of patients, and possible causes of re-operation include incomplete decompression and dural scarring. Other complications that are possible in surgical repair of type I Chiari malformations include an aseptic meningitis due to irritation from the dural grafts which is seen in 32% of cases. Rates of aseptic meningitis are lower with dural allografts or autografts as compared to bovine or synthetic grafts. Another complication includes a CSF leak, which may occur in up to 21% of people post-operatively.

A small number of neurological surgeons believe that detethering the spinal cord as an alternate approach relieves the compression of the brain against the skull opening (foramen magnum), obviating the need for decompression surgery and associated trauma. However, this approach is significantly less documented in the medical literature, with reports on only a handful of patients. The alternative spinal surgery is also not without risk.

Complications of decompression surgery can arise. They include bleeding, damage to structures in the brain and spinal canal, meningitis, CSF fistulas, occipito-cervical instability, and pseudomeningocele. Rare post-operative complications include hydrocephalus and brainstem compression by retroflexion of odontoid. Also, an extended CVD created by a wide opening and big duroplasty can cause a cerebellar &quot;slump&quot;. This complication needs to be corrected by cranioplasty.

In certain cases, irreducible compression of the brainstem occurs from in front (anteriorly or ventral) resulting in a smaller posterior fossa and associated Chiari malformation. In these cases, an anterior decompression is required. The most commonly used approach is to operate through the mouth (transoral) to remove the bone compressing the brainstem, typically the odontoid. This results in decompressing the brainstem and therefore gives more room for the cerebellum, thus decompressing the Chiari malformation. Arnold Menzes, MD, is the neurosurgeon who pioneered this approach in the 1970s at the University of Iowa. Between 1984 and 2008 (the MR imaging era), 298 patients with irreducible ventral compression of the brainstem and Chiari type I malformation underwent a transoral approach for ventral cervicomedullary decompression at the University of Iowa. The results have been excellent resulting in improved brainstem function and resolution of the Chiari malformation in the majority of patients.

==Epidemiology==
The incidence of congenital Chiari I malformation was previously believed to be in the range of one per 1000 births, but is likely much higher. Women are three times more likely than men to have a congenital Chiari malformation. Type II malformations are more prevalent in people of Celtic descent. A study using upright MRI found cerebellar tonsillar ectopia in 23% of adults with headache from motor-vehicle-accident head trauma. Upright MRI was more than twice as sensitive as standard MRI, likely because gravity affects cerebellar position.

Cases of congenital Chiari malformation may be explained by evolutionary and genetic factors. Typically, an infant&#x27;s brain weighs around 400g at birth and triples to 1100-1400g by age 11. At the same time the cranium triples in volume from 500 cm3 to 1500 cm3 to accommodate the growing brain. During human evolution, the skull underwent numerous changes to accommodate the growing brain. The evolutionary changes included increased size and shape of the skull, decreased basal angle and basicranial length. These modifications resulted in significant reduction of the size of the posterior fossa in modern humans. In normal adults, the posterior fossa comprises 27% of the total intracranial space, while in adults with Chiari Type I, it is only 21%. H. neanderthalensis had platycephalic (flattened) skulls. Some cases of Chiari are associated with platybasia (flattening of the skull base).

==History==
The history of Chiari malformation:
* 1883: Cleland was the first to describe Chiari II or Arnold–Chiari malformation on his report of a child with spina bifida, hydrocephalus, and anatomical alterations of the cerebellum and brainstem.
* 1891: Hans Chiari, a Viennese pathologist, described the case of a 17-year-old female with elongation of the tonsils into cone shaped projections which accompany the medulla and are crammed into the spinal canal.
* 1907: Schwalbe and Gredig, pupils of German pathologist Julius Arnold, described four cases of meningomyelocele and alterations in the brainstem and cerebellum, and gave the name &quot;Arnold–Chiari&quot; to these malformations.
* 1932: Van Houweninge Graftdijk was the first to report the surgical treatment of Chiari malformations. All patients died from surgery or postoperative complications.
* 1935: Russell and Donald suggested that decompression of the spinal cord at the foramen magnum might facilitate the CSF circulation.
* 1940: Gustafson and Oldberg diagnosed Chiari malformation with syringomyelia.
* 1974: Bloch &quot;et al.&quot; described the tonsils position to be classified between 7 mm and 8 mm below cerebellum.
* 1985: Aboulezz used MRI for discovery of extension

==Society and culture==
The condition was brought to the mainstream on the series &quot;&quot; in the tenth-season episode &quot;Internal Combustion&quot; on February 4, 2010.
Chiari malformation was briefly mentioned on the medical drama &quot;House M.D.&quot; in the fifth-season episode &quot;House Divided&quot;, It was the focus of the sixth-season episode &quot;The Choice&quot;. It is also the focus of &quot;Private Practice&quot; Season 4 episode 4, where a pregnant woman is diagnosed with it. It was the cause of death on the reality television series &quot;Dr. G: Medical Examiner&quot; in the sixth-season episode &quot;Bruised and Battered&quot;. It was also mentioned in the medical drama &quot;A Gifted Man&quot;, in the first-season episode &quot;In Case of Separation Anxiety&quot;.
It is also featured in the 3rd and 4th episode of the 7th season of the series &quot;Rizzoli &amp; Isles&quot; where Dr. Maura Isles is diagnosed with the condition.

<doc id="208896" wikidata="Q1035098" url="?curid=208896" title="Buzz Lightyear of Star Command">
<text>Buzz Lightyear of Star Command is an American animated science fiction comedy television series produced by Walt Disney Television Animation and co-produced by Pixar Animation Studios. It is a spin-off of Pixar&#x27;s &quot;Toy Story&quot; franchise and presents a fictionalized account of the in-universe character Buzz Lightyear. The series was preceded by the direct-to-video film &quot;Buzz Lightyear of Star Command: The Adventure Begins,&quot; and aired on UPN and ABC from October 2, 2000, to January 13, 2001, as part of Disney&#x27;s One Saturday Morning and Disney&#x27;s One Too programming blocks. While the series is 2D animated, Pixar animated the CGI opening title sequence at the beginning of each episode. The program was animated by Walt Disney Television Animation (Australia) Pty., Ltd., Tama Productions, Sunwoo Entertainment, Sunmin Image Pictures, Sae Hahn Productions, Hana Animation, Jade Animation, Wang Film Productions and Toon City.

Developed by Bob Schooley and Mark McCorkle, who would later create &quot;Kim Possible&quot; for Disney Channel, the series follows the adventures of Space Ranger Buzz Lightyear. The character first appeared as an action figure (voiced by Tim Allen) in the 1995 film &quot;Toy Story&quot;. Patrick Warburton voices the character in the television series. A video game of the same name based on the series was released in 2000.

This was the last &quot;Toy Story&quot; production for nearly a decade until the release of &quot;Toy Story 3&quot; in 2010.

==Premise==
&quot;Buzz Lightyear of Star Command&quot; is set in the far future. Capital Planet is the forefront of the Galactic Alliance, a peaceful union of various planets, home to various alien species that coexist in harmony. Star Command is a peacekeeping organization consisting of Space Rangers, who investigate threats to galactic peace. The primary enemy of Star Command is the Evil Emperor Zurg, an intergalactic crime boss and warlord that rules Planet Z, with an empire of heavily armed robots and slave races forced to work in opposition to the Galactic Alliance.

The series follows Buzz Lightyear, an experienced and famous Space Ranger who takes a crew of rookies under his wing as he investigates criminal activity across the galaxy and attempts to thwart Zurg&#x27;s evil plots to overthrow the universe.

==Characters==
===Star Command===
====Team Lightyear====
* Captain Buzz Lightyear (voiced by Patrick Warburton): Famed Space Ranger known for heroism and bravery and leader of Team Lightyear. Buzz often suggests that his archenemy Emperor Zurg is behind every evil plot and is often proven correct. Like his &quot;Toy Story&quot; incarnation, Buzz is idealistic and a stickler for procedure, but will tell a cover story if he needs to. However, he has few people skills, and at times displays a lack of integrity. He attended PS- 193 as a primary school. He wrote at least half of the regulations in the Star Command Manual. He also owns a house on Capital Planet, though as they all look alike and his duties often keep him away, he is confused over just which one is his. He seems to have a little crush on Dr. Ozma Furbanna and vice versa.
* Princess Mira Nova (voiced by Nicole Sullivan) is a rookie ranger and heir to the Tangean throne. She utilizes her people&#x27;s ability to phase through walls (called &quot;ghosting&quot;) and read minds. Buzz has a tendency to refer to her as &quot;Princess&quot; when he&#x27;s angry with her. She acts as Buzz&#x27;s co-pilot and second-in-command. She has the most common sense of the team. Mira also has an estranged relationship with her father, King Nova, who disapproves of her choice of being a Space Ranger, though deep down she still cares about him. She has red hair and turquoise skin.
* Booster Sinclair Munchapper (voiced by Stephen Furst) is a huge frog/dinosaur-like former janitor from the agricultural planet of Jo-ad (a play on the name of the Joad family, from John Steinbeck&#x27;s &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot;). He has a big appetite and incredible strength, but is sweet and occasionally naive. He is in awe of Buzz Lightyear and has encyclopedic knowledge of his prior adventures.
* XR: Xperimental Ranger (voiced alternatively by Larry Miller and Neil Flynn) is a short robot that was originally emotionless and programmed to learn from Buzz but was blown apart by Agent Z during his first mission. The LGMs rebuilt him, but the temporary loss of the Uni-Mind to Emperor Zurg left them off their game. They rebuilt XR with his slicker, more emotional personality and a variety of attachments. XR stands for Experimental Ranger (the LGMs have stated that this is the official meaning of the name, though other characters on the show hold the erroneous belief that the X stands for Expendable). He gets blown apart on nearly every mission he goes on but is easily rebuilt. He considers Commander Nebula his father (due to him unintentionally signing the paperwork authorizing his creation) and is always seeking his approval.

====Other personnel====
* Commander Nebula (voiced by Adam Carolla) is the Space Rangers&#x27; commander and Buzz&#x27;s superior, whose left leg was replaced by a pegleg-like plasma cannon. Rather short-tempered and constantly speaks with a loud voice. He has a robotic desk that forces him to do his paperwork. He hates to do so, though, and therefore signs forms without looking at them. By doing so, he inadvertently authorized the creation of XR, which was included on a vacation request form filled by the LGMs.
* LGMs, or Little Green Men (both voiced by Patrick Warburton) are small, three-eyed aliens (originally appeared as squeeze toy aliens in the &quot;Toy Story&quot; movies). They are the intensely loyal backbone of Star Command, keeping the station running while inventing/maintaining all of the equipment. When one of their own is kidnapped, the other LGMs will instinctively try to rescue him by any means necessary. LGMs are typically in awe of Buzz. While they generally like the other Rangers, they may not be able to tell one from another. Several of their race are also shown to work for Santa Claus, acting as his toy builders.
* Ty Parsec (voiced by Steve Hytner) is the infamous old comrade of Buzz Lightyear, who is fed up with Buzz always coming to his rescue. The Space Ranger was accidentally transformed into the robotic Wirewolf (equivalent of a werewolf) on the planet of Canis Lunis, after being bitten by the villain NOS-4-A2 while exposed to radioactive moonrock. Appeared in two episodes, with a cameo appearance in the episode &quot;War, Peace, and War&quot;. He is ultimately cured and reinstated as a Space Ranger.
* Rocket Crocket (voiced by Phil LaMarr): Member of Star Command and leader of Team Rocket. He has been Buzz&#x27;s rival since their academy days.
* Fop Doppler (voiced by Rob Paulsen): is a Tangean like Mira, he joined as a challenge to win her hand in marriage, but it was called off after he expressed his enjoyment of being a ranger right after helping foil Lord Angstrom&#x27;s attempt to overthrow King Nova.
* Petra Hammerhold (voiced by Nikki Cox) is Senator Hammerhold&#x27;s daughter. She joined Star Command when her father forced her to do so (largely to keep her from her boyfriend Plasma Boy). She was initially resentful of this, but was moved by Buzz&#x27;s heroism during a crisis.
* Plasma Boy (voiced by Michael Showalter) is Petra&#x27;s boyfriend, who has a Plasma Monster form. Booster competed against him for Petra&#x27;s affection. When Mira and XR fired a laser at his Plasma Monster form, he destabilized enough to the brink of explosion. He was prevented from explosion when Booster used his suit and Ion Stabilization Matrix on him. He&#x27;s now a member of Star Command.
* 42 (voiced by Joy Behar): Usually the name of Buzz Lightyear&#x27;s ship, it gained A.I. from one of the encounters with the Valkyran Raiders and a new energy projector device inserted on the ship by the LGMs. 42 doesn&#x27;t like what Buzz says about her and usually controls the ship herself. XR developed a crush on her. When the Valkyran Raiders were thwarted, 42&#x27;s consciousness was placed into a robot body and she now helps the LGMs.

===Villains===
* Evil Emperor Zurg (voiced by Wayne Knight): The main antagonist of the series and Buzz&#x27;s archenemy. Rules an empire on Planet Z and wants to rule the entire universe while destroying Star Command. Zurg often takes any opportunity to eliminate Buzz. Most of his subjects are robots. His feet double as rockets and he can transform his arms into a variety of weapons. Despite often breaking the seriousness of otherwise purely evil statements, Zurg is widely considered the evilest person in the galaxy, especially by the other villains. He seems to have some neuroses about being touched. In some episodes is shown being sinister. The episode &quot;War, and Peace and War&quot; was notably the only episode where Zurg teamed up with Buzz Lightyear to defeat the Heed, a common enemy that was trying to take over their galaxy. In &quot;Stranger Invasion&quot;, he claimed to be Buzz&#x27;s father (a parody upon &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; and a nearly identical scene in &quot;Toy Story 2&quot;), but quickly took it back, using the statement as a &#x27;Made You Look&#x27; in order to stun and deceive Buzz and gain the upper hand.
** The Grubs (both voiced by Frank Welker) are Zurg&#x27;s equivalents to the LGMs of Star Command (though far less competent). They perform mechanical and technical duties. The Grubs work for Zurg against their will and also desire freedom, but many of them are simply too afraid to try to defect.
** Brain Pods (Various Voices for each one) are Cybernetic brains in mobile jars, who serve Zurg as scientists and researchers. Although they take pride in their creations, they secretly harbor a desire to escape from Zurg&#x27;s control. (Two of which are shown succeeding in doing so on-screen.)
** The Hornets are Zurg&#x27;s robotic foot soldiers, extremely expendable, lousy shots and always get vaporized in mass numbers by Lightyear&#x27;s team. Hornets come in different models, but the most frequently seen are yellow and of average height.
* Warp Darkmatter (voiced by Diedrich Bader) was once Buzz&#x27;s partner and best friend, but he had been secretly working for Zurg since his academy days as a double agent and also betrayed Star Command. He eventually began working for him full-time as &quot;Agent Z.&quot; His right arm is robotic (with various weapon attachments) and was grafted to his body after becoming Agent Z. Warp often takes on assignments for Zurg and is paid quite handsomely. (He owns a whole moon and a summer asteroid in the Hampton&#x27;s Ring.) Though Buzz has vowed to bring him in for treason, he retains some hope that there is still some good in him.
* Evil Buzz Lightyear (voiced by Patrick Warburton) is the evil counterpart of Buzz from an alternate universe where he is an evil emperor instead of Zurg due to the fact that Zurg in the alternate universe apparently didn’t have what it took to be the ultimate evil (Zurg now works as a server at Cosmo&#x27;s Diner) and has destroyed Star Command along with various other planets and the Galactic Alliance. The Evil Buzz looks exactly like Buzz Lightyear, except having facial hair and wearing armor similar to Emperor Zurg, but with pants and without a cape, and the letter L in the center of his chest instead of the letter Z. He appears to be more dangerous and eviler than Emperor Zurg but despite being intimidated, Emperor Zurg teams up with the Evil Buzz to eliminate Buzz Lightyear and Star Command in the original universe but was thwarted by Buzz with the help of the alternate counterparts of Booster, Mira, XR and Nebula. Evil Buzz escapes and later teams up and falls in love with Gravitina.
* Gravitina (voiced by Kerri Kenney-Silver) is a large-headed female villain with mental control over gravity. One of Zurg&#x27;s allies and once hired to destroy Star Command. She&#x27;s in love with Buzz and later his evil counterpart.
* (voiced by Craig Ferguson) is a robotic vampire created by Zurg. He is capable of draining any system or entity driven by electrical power, as well as controlling any machine he bites. His bite (in combination with radioactive moonrock) also transformed Ty Parsec into Wirewolf. Using Wirewolf and XL, he briefly usurped control of Planet Z from Zurg and attempted to transform everyone in the galaxy into robots for him to feed on, but was defeated and destroyed by Buzz, XR, Wirewolf and a reformed XL. His name is a pun on the term Nosferatu.
* Torque (voiced by Brad Garrett) are minor alien villain who committed crimes of terrorism, smuggling, arson, and unpaid parking tickets. After being freed from a prison transport by Zurg&#x27;s Hornets, the Grubs implanted a cell-separation device upon his chest. Torque then possesses the ability to create duplicate versions of himself. They are unstable, however, as a single laser blast is enough to destroy them. In &quot;The Taking of PC-7&quot;, he tried to turn Booster evil (and later Buzz) with a memory-altering device built by the Warden of PC-7. The same device also made Torque (temporarily at least) a heroic good guy. Torque rides a motorcycle-shaped spacecraft, and his duplication abilities seem to be a reference to the character Lobo (who was also voiced by Brad Garrett in his DCAU appearances).
* XL (voiced by Bobcat Goldthwait) is XR&#x27;s predecessor (and technically older brother), who was shut down due to his villainous attitude. When he was reactivated by Zurg, XL rebuilt himself into a larger, more powerful robot with cutting edge (and stolen) robot parts. His head is red, whereas XR&#x27;s is yellow. He infiltrates Star Command numerous times because its command codes are in his head. Like XR, he considers Commander Nebula his father, though he resents him for shutting him down. He later redeems himself and is converted into an office managing robot capable of photocopying, collating, and other office related functions, but is never seen for the rest of the series afterwards. His name is a pun referring to his size (extra-large).
* Wirewolf (voiced by Steve Hytner) is a Space Ranger (Ty Parsec; see above) who patrolled the planet Canis Lunis until an attack from NOS-4-A2. While Ty was in combat with the energy vampire, NOS-4-A2, flew himself and Ty up into the beam, which gave power to the planet from the moon&#x27;s radioactive energy, and bit into Ty&#x27;s skin. After NOS-4-A2 fled, Ty started to mutate into some sort of electronic canine, later given the title of &quot;Wirewolf.&quot; Having discovered that this transformation only happens in the light of the Canis Lunis moon, Buzz told Booster to destroy the moon. Once the moon was destroyed, Team Lightyear believed that the Wirewolf was finished until NOS-4-A2 gave Ty a Canis Lunis moonrock. When NOS-4-A2 was destroyed, Ty was turned back to normal, ending the curse of the Wirewolf.

===Galactic Alliance===
* Madam President (voiced by Roz Ryan): Head of the Galactic Alliance. Her real name is unknown.
* Senator Aarrfvox (voiced by Jim Cummings) is a Shragorakian senator.
* Senator Banda (voiced by Dan Castellaneta) is a Bathyosian senator.
* Senator Hammerhold (voiced by Corey Burton) is Petra Hammerhold&#x27;s father.
* Senator Phlegmex (voiced by Frank Welker) is a slime-emitting senator.

===Other===
* Becky (voiced by Russi Taylor) is a little alien girl from the planet Roswell. She befriended Booster (whom she calls Pickles) when Team Lightyear&#x27;s ship crashed on her planet.
* Brent Starkisser (voiced by Corey Burton) is the Galaxy&#x27;s reporter.
* Cosmo (voiced by Paul Rugg) is an alien that owns and runs the diner that Team Lightyear eats at. He has a mechanical arm as well as a foreign accent.
* Dr. Animus (voiced by Tony Jay) is the Galaxy&#x27;s therapist.
* Dr. Ozma Furbanna (voiced by Linda Hamilton): Lead (and only) naturalist on planet Karn. She favors all animals (even the lethal carnivores) and hates to have them hurt, no matter what. Has a crush on Buzz (won&#x27;t admit it, though), and vice versa. Zurg once used her help to hatch the Millennial Bugs (entirely ticklish) where Zurg used them on Capital Planet.
* Ed (voiced by Paul Rugg) is a courier who somehow always knows how to track down Buzz Lightyear.
* Officer Panchex (voiced by Brian Doyle-Murray) is a fish policeman who helped Buzz Lightyear fight Minister Gularis.
* Professor Triffid (voiced by Joel Murray) is a scientist from Rhizome. He cares a lot for the plants there.
* Savy SL2 (voiced by Cree Summer): Her adopted robot parents were attacked by NOS-4-A2 in &quot;The Slayer&quot;, which lead her to hunting him down for revenge.
* Sheriff of Roswell (voiced by Stephen Root) is Becky&#x27;s father and ally of Team Lightyear.
* King Nova (voiced by John O&#x27;Hurley) is Mira&#x27;s father and the ruler of Tangea. Being more tradition bound he clearly disapproves of his daughter being a Space Ranger and therefore has a complicated relationship with her as well as Buzz. But regardless of his pompous nature he still cares about his daughter and also came to her aid when she had developed a power addiction and helped her get over it, though he almost got his wish of getting his daughter back in this instance had Buzz not saved her career through a cover story.
* Santa Claus (voiced by Earl Boen) is the holiday figure, who delivers presents to all the good people in the galaxy during the Holiday. He previously used a sleigh powered by belief and later time manipulation to accomplish this massive task. Zurg stole his time manipulation device to destroy the Holiday for everyone, prompting Santa to seek Team Lightyear&#x27;s help.
* The Fixer (voiced by Ed Asner) is a character from Trade World. He sells robotic parts to people around Trade World, and once tricked XR into delivering a package to XL.
* Crumford Lorak (voiced by Jon Favreau) is a conman, informant and criminal commonly seen on Trade World. When this guy gets the chance, he always tricks or turns on the first ranger he sees.
* Rentwhistle Swack (voiced by French Stewart) is an unscrupulous conman who will do anything for money.

<doc id="208897" wikidata="Q830335" url="?curid=208897" title="Protected cruiser">
<text>Protected cruisers, a type of cruising warship of the late 19th century, gained their description because an armored deck offered protection for vital machine-spaces from fragments caused by shells exploding above them. Protected cruisers notably lacked a belt of armour along the sides, in contrast to armored cruisers which carried both deck and belt armour. Protected cruisers were typically lighter in displacement and mounted fewer and/or lighter guns than armored cruisers. By the early 20th-century, with the advent of increasingly lighter yet stronger armour, even smaller vessels could afford some level of both belt and deck armour. In the place of protected cruisers, armored cruisers would evolve into heavy cruisers and light cruisers, the latter especially taking-up many of roles originally envisaged for that of protected cruisers.

From the late 1850s, navies began to replace their fleets of wooden ships-of-the-line with armoured ironclad warships. The frigates and sloops which performed the missions of scouting, commerce raiding and trade protection remained unarmoured. For several decades, it proved difficult to design a ship which had a meaningful amount of effective armour but at the same time maintained the speed and range required of a &quot;cruising warship&quot;. The first attempts to do so, large armored cruisers like , proved unsatisfactory, generally lacking enough speed for their cruiser role. They were, along with their foreign counterparts such as the French &quot;Alma&quot; class, more like second- or third-class battleships and were mainly intended to fulfil this role on foreign stations where full-scale battleships could not be spared or properly supported.

===First protective decks===

During the 1870s the increasing power of armour-piercing shells made armouring the sides of a warship more and more difficult, as very thick, heavy armour plates were required. Even if armour dominated the design of the ship, it was likely that the next generation of shells would be able to pierce such armour. This problem was even more poignant where the design of cruising warships was concerned, with their requirement for long endurance needing much of their displacement to be devoted to consumable supplies – even where very powerful and space-consuming high-speed machinery was not required – leaving very little weight available for armour protection. This meant that effective side belt armour would be almost impossible to provide for smaller ships.

The alternative was to leave the sides of the ship vulnerable, but to armour a deck just below the waterline. Since this deck would be struck only very obliquely by shells, it could be less thick and heavy than belt armour. The ship could be designed so that the engines, boilers and magazines were under the armoured deck, and with hopefully enough reserve buoyancy to keep the ship afloat even in the event of flooding resulting from damage above the protective deck. An armoured deck had actually been used for the first time in HMS &quot;Shannon&quot;, although she did rely principally on her vertical belt armour for defence: Her protective deck was only a partial one, extending from the forward armoured bulkhead of the citadel to the bow.

===Early ships===

The first of the smaller &quot;unarmoured&quot; British cruisers to incorporate an internal steel deck for protection was the of corvettes started in 1876; this was only a partial-length deck, with amidships over the machinery spaces. The &quot;Comus&quot; class were really designed for overseas service and were capable of only a speed, not fast enough for fleet duties. The following &quot;Satellite&quot; and &quot;Calypso&quot; classes were similar in performance.

A more potent and versatile balance of attributes was struck with the four s. Ordered in 1880 as modified dispatch vessels and re-rated as second-class cruisers before completion, these ships combined an amidships protective armoured deck with the size, lean form and high performance of . They also featured a heavy and well-sited armament of modern breech-loading guns. &quot;Leander&quot; and her three sisters were successful and established a basis for future Royal Navy cruiser development, through the rest of the century and beyond. Their general configuration was scaled up to the big First Class cruisers and down to the torpedo cruisers, while traces of the protected deck scheme can even be recognised in some sloops.

===Breakthrough===

By the start of the 1880s, ships were appearing with full-length armoured decks and no side armour, from the of very fast battleships to the torpedo ram . In the case of the latter, the armoured deck was of sufficient thickness to defend against small-calibre guns capable of tracking such a difficult, fast target. This was very much the philosophy adopted by George Wightwick Rendel in his design of the so-called &#x27;Rendel cruisers&#x27; &quot;Arturo Prat&quot;, and . By enlarging the flatiron gunboat concept, increasing engine power and thus speed, Rendel was able to produce a fast small vessel and still have enough tonnage to incorporate a very thin ( thick) partial protective deck over the machinery. Still small and relatively weakly built, these vessels were &#x27;proto-protected cruisers&#x27; which served as the inspiration for a significantly larger ship; &quot;Esmeralda&quot;.
The first true mastless protected cruiser and the first of the &#x27;Elswick cruisers&#x27;, the was designed by Rendel and built for the Chilean Navy by the British firm of Armstrong at their Elswick yard. &quot;Esmeralda&quot; was revolutionary; she had a high speed of (dispensing entirely with sails), an armament of two and six guns and a full-length protective deck. This was up to thick on the slopes, with a cork-filled cofferdam along her sides. It would not defend against fire from heavy guns, but was designed to be adequate to defeat any gun of the day considered capable of hitting so fast a ship.

With her heavy emphasis on speed and firepower, &quot;Esmeralda&quot; set the tone for competitive cruiser designs into the early 20th century, with &#x27;Elswick cruisers&#x27; of a similar design being constructed for Italy, China, Japan, Argentina, Austria and the United States. Cruisers with armoured decks and no side armour – like &quot;Esmeralda&quot; – became known as &quot;protected cruisers&quot;, and rapidly eclipsed the large and slow armoured cruisers during the 1880s and into the 1890s.

The French Navy adopted the protected-cruiser concept wholeheartedly in the 1880s. The &quot;Jeune École&quot; school of thought, which proposed a navy composed of fast cruisers for commerce raiding and torpedo boats for coastal defence, became particularly influential in France. The first French protected cruiser was , laid down in 1882, and followed by six classes of protected cruiser – and no armoured cruisers.

===Side armour abandonment===

The Royal Navy remained equivocal about which protection scheme to use for cruisers until 1887. The large , begun in 1881 and finished in 1886, were built as armoured cruisers but were often referred to as protected cruisers due to the limited extent of their side armour – although what armour they had was admittedly very thick. Their primary role, as with the earlier &quot;Shannon&quot; and &quot;Nelsons&quot;, was still to function as small battleships on foreign stations, countering enemy &quot;stationnaire ironclads&quot; rather than chasing down swift commerce-raiding corsairs. While they carried a very thick and heavy armoured belt of great power of resistance that extended over the middle of the ship&#x27;s length, the belt&#x27;s upper edge was submerged at full load.

Britain built one more class of armoured cruiser with the , begun in 1885 and completed in 1889. They were affected by a similar fault to the &quot;Imperieuse&quot; regarding their belt&#x27;s submergence. In 1887 an assessment of the &quot;Orlando&quot; type judged them inferior to the protected cruisers and thereafter the Royal Navy built only protected cruisers, even for very large first-class cruiser designs, not returning to armoured cruisers until the introduction of new lighter and stronger armour technology (as seen in the , laid down in 1898).

The sole major naval power to retain a preference for armoured cruisers into the 1890s was Russia. The Imperial Russian Navy laid down four armoured cruisers and one protected cruiser during the late 1880s, all large ships with sails.

===Elswick&#x27;s influence===

Following the &quot;Leander&quot; class, the next small cruisers designed for the Royal Navy were the of 1883. Derived from the previous class, these were also protected cruisers but with a full-length armoured deck for superior protection. The &quot;Merseys&quot; were born from a different tactical conception to their forebears and this was reflected in their armament arrangement. They were conceived as &#x27;fleet torpedo cruisers&#x27; to carry out attacks on the enemy battle line and featured heavy guns fore and aft with excellent fields of fire. Despite public Admiralty criticism of Elswick designs, it is clear that the &quot;Mersey&quot; class was heavily influenced by the Italian &#x27;torpedo ram cruiser&#x27; &quot;Giovanni Bausan&quot;, a design itself derived from &quot;Esmeralda&quot;. Thus, the British notion of the protected cruising warship was being shaped early on by the commercial export models coming out of Elswick. (For the following decade, practically any British cruiser which was seen to have eschewed very heavy firepower in favour of conservative design balance was subject to fierce public criticism, and this period coincided somewhat unfortunately with Sir William White&#x27;s tenure as DNC.)

The protected cruiser remained a popular and economical type, rather stable in terms of its characteristics, right throughout the 1890s and into the early 1900s. During this period, protected cruiser designs of second- to third-class grew slowly in size, seeing few major changes to the common balance of design features. Perhaps the most significant paradigm shift came with the universal adoption of quick-firing guns by the world&#x27;s navies in the middle of the 1890s; suddenly small and medium cruisers saw a swift increase in their fighting power for a slight reduction in gun calibre, yielding a very economical balance of attributes. This kept the protected cruiser competitive for a further decade.

==Eclipse of the type==

By 1910, steel armour had increased in quality, being lighter and stronger than before thanks to metallurgical advances, and steam-turbine engines, lighter and more powerful than previous reciprocating engines, were in general use. This gave rise to a new class of cruising warship, the &quot;light armoured cruisers&quot; which featured a side armoured belt (topped by a flat armoured deck) amidships and sloped armoured decks at the ends, instead of the single full-length curved deck of the older ships. With the introduction of oil-fired boilers, more effective at generating a constant steam pressure to get the best performance from the turbine engines, side bunkers of coal disappeared from ships and this change removed the protection they had afforded, making the shift to side armour a practical choice.

The majority of pre-existing protected cruisers – products of the Victorian-era design generation – had now become obsolete: With their by-now old and worn engines degrading their already-eclipsed performance by this point; their older models of lower-velocity guns able to shoot accurately to a shorter distance than newer equivalent ships, in a period where long-range fire control was a rapidly-developing discipline with technology to match; and finally – most critically – being less well protected than the new generation of side-armoured ships. From this point on, practically no more protected cruisers would be built for the world&#x27;s navies.

==Service areas==
===Austria-Hungary===

The Austro-Hungarian Navy built and operated three classes of protected cruisers. These were two small ships of the &quot;Panther&quot; class, two ships of the and three of the .

===Britain===

The Royal Navy rated cruisers as first, second and third class between the late 1880s and 1905, and built large numbers of them for trade protection requirements. For most of this time these cruisers were built with a &quot;protected&quot;, rather than armoured, scheme of protection for their hulls. First-class protected cruisers were as large and as well-armed as armoured cruisers, and were built as an alternative to the large first-class armoured cruiser from the late 1880s till 1898. Second-class protected cruisers were smaller, displacing and were of value both in trade protection duties and scouting for the fleet. Third-class cruisers were smaller, lacked a watertight double bottom, and were intended primarily for trade protection duties, though a few small cruisers were built for fleet scout roles or as &quot;torpedo&quot; cruisers during the &quot;protected&quot; era.

The introduction of Krupp armour in six-inch thickness rendered the &quot;armoured&quot; protection scheme more effective for the largest first class cruisers, and no large first class protected cruisers were built after 1898. The smaller cruisers unable to bear the weight of heavy armoured belts retained the &quot;protected&quot; scheme up to 1905, when the last units of the and es were completed. There was a general hiatus in British cruiser production after this time, apart from a few classes of small, fast scout cruisers for fleet duties. When the Royal Navy began building larger cruisers (less than ) again around 1910, they used a mix of armoured decks and/or armoured belts for protection, depending on class. These modern, turbine-powered cruisers are properly classified as light cruisers.

===France===

The French Navy built and operated a large variety of protected cruisers classes starting with &quot;Sfax&quot; in 1882. The last ship built to this design was in 1897.

===Germany===
The German Imperial Navy (&quot;Kaiserliche Marine&quot;) built a series of protected cruisers in the 1880s and 1890s, starting with the two ships of the in the 1880s. The Navy completed only two additional classes of protected cruisers, comprising six more ships: the unique , and the five ships. The type then was superseded by the armored cruiser at the turn of the century, the first of which being . All of these ships tended to incorporate design elements from their foreign contemporaries, though the &quot;Victoria Louise&quot; class more closely resembled German battleships of the period, which carried lighter main guns and a greater number of secondary guns.

These ships were employed as fleet scouts and colonial cruisers. Several of the ships served with the German East Asia Squadron, and , , and took part in the Battle of Taku Forts in 1900 during the Boxer Rebellion. During a deployment to American waters in 1902, participated in the Venezuelan crisis of 1902–1903, where she bombarded Fort San Carlos. Long since obsolete by the outbreak of World War I, the five &quot;Victoria Louise&quot;-class vessels briefly served as training ships in the Baltic but were withdrawn by the end of 1914 for secondary duties. &quot;Kaiserin Augusta&quot; and the two &quot;Irene&quot;-class cruisers similarly served in reduced capacities for the duration of the war. All eight ships were broken up for scrap following Germany&#x27;s defeat.

===Italy===
The Italian &quot;Regia Marina&quot; (Royal Navy) ordered twenty protected cruisers between the 1880s and 1910s. The first five ships, and the , were built as &quot;battleship destroyers&quot;, armed with a pair of large caliber guns. Subsequent cruisers were more traditional designs, and were instead intended for reconnaissance and colonial duties. Some of the ships, like and the , were designed specifically for service in Italy&#x27;s colonial empire, while others, like and the , were designed as high speed fleet scouts.

Most of these ships saw action during the Italo-Turkish War of 1911–1912, where several of them supported Italian troops fighting in Libya, and another group operated in the Red Sea. There, the cruiser and two destroyers sank or destroyed seven Ottoman gunboats in the Battle of Kunfuda Bay in January 1912. Most of the earlier cruisers were obsolescent by the outbreak of World War I, and so had either been sold for scrap or reduced to subsidiary roles. The most modern vessels, including &quot;Quarto&quot; and the &quot;Nino Bixio&quot; class, saw limited action in the Adriatic Sea after Italy entered the war in 1915. The surviving vessels continued on in service through the 1920s, with some—&quot;Quarto&quot;, , and , remaining on active duty into the late 1930s.

===Netherlands===

The Royal Netherlands Navy built several protected cruisers between 1880 and 1900. The first protected cruiser was launched in 1890 and called . It was a small cruiser with a heavy main gun; four years later a larger and more heavily armed protected cruiser was commissioned, which was called . In addition to these two cruisers, the Dutch also built six protected cruisers of the . The &quot;Holland&quot;-class cruisers were commissioned between 1898 and 1901, and featured, besides other armaments, two 15 cm SK L/40 single naval guns.

The Dutch protected cruisers have played a role in several international events. For example, during the Boxer Rebellion, two protected cruisers ( and () were sent to Shanghai to protect European citizens and defend Dutch interests.

===Russia===

The Imperial Russian Navy operated a series of protected cruiser classes (, &quot;Armored deck cruiser&quot;). The last ships built to this design where the in 1901.

===Spain===

The Spanish Navy operated a series of protected cruisers classes starting with . The last ship built to this design was in 1899.

===United States===
The first protected cruiser of the United States Navy&#x27;s &quot;New Navy&quot; was , launched in October 1884, soon followed by in December, and a year later. A numbered series of cruisers began with &quot;Newark&quot; (Cruiser No. 1), although &quot;Charleston&quot; (Cruiser No. 2) was the first to be launched, in July 1888, and ending with another &quot;Charleston&quot;, Cruiser No. 22, launched in 1904. The last survivor of this series is , preserved as a museum ship in Philadelphia.

The reclassification of 17 July 1920 put an end to the U.S. usage of the term &quot;protected cruiser&quot;, the existing ships were classified as light or heavy cruisers with new numbers, depending on their level of armor.

==Surviving examples==

<doc id="208900" wikidata="Q1127402" url="?curid=208900" title="Neural tube">
<text>In the developing chordate (including vertebrates), the neural tube is the embryonic precursor to the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain and spinal cord. The neural groove gradually deepens as the neural folds become elevated, and ultimately the folds meet and coalesce in the middle line and convert the groove into the closed neural tube. In humans, neural tube closure usually occurs by the fourth week of pregnancy (the 28th day after conception).

==Development==

The neural tube develops in two ways: primary neurulation and secondary neurulation.

Primary neurulation divides the ectoderm into three cell types:
* The internally located neural tube
* The externally located epidermis
* The neural crest cells, which develop in the region between the neural tube and epidermis but then migrate to new locations

# Primary neurulation begins after the neural plate forms. The edges of the neural plate start to thicken and lift upward, forming the neural folds. The center of the neural plate remains grounded, allowing a U-shaped neural groove to form. This neural groove sets the boundary between the right and left sides of the embryo. The neural folds pinch in towards the midline of the embryo and fuse together to form the neural tube.
# In secondary neurulation, the cells of the neural plate form a cord-like structure that migrates inside the embryo and hollows to form the tube.

Each organism uses primary and secondary neurulation to varying degrees.

* Neurulation in &quot;fish&quot; proceeds only via the secondary form.
* In &quot;avian&quot; species, the posterior regions of the tube develop using secondary neurulation and the anterior regions develop by primary neurulation.
* In &quot;mammals&quot;, secondary neurulation begins around the 35th somite.

Mammalian neural tubes close in the head in the opposite order that they close in the trunk.

==Structure==

Four neural tube subdivisions each eventually develop into distinct regions of the central nervous system by the division of neuroepithelial cells: the forebrain (prosencephalon), the midbrain (mesencephalon), the hindbrain (rhombencephalon) and the spinal cord.
* The &quot;prosencephalon&quot; further goes on to develop into the telencephalon (cerebrum) and the diencephalon (the optic vesicles and hypothalamus).
* The &quot;mesencephalon&quot; stays as the midbrain.
* The &quot;rhombencephalon&quot; develops into the metencephalon (the pons and cerebellum) and the myelencephalon (the medulla oblongata).

For a short time, the neural tube is open both cranially and caudally. These openings, called neuropores, close during the fourth week in humans. Improper closure of the neuropores can result in neural tube defects such as anencephaly or spina bifida.

The dorsal part of the neural tube contains the alar plate, which is associated primarily with . The ventral part of the neural tube contains the basal plate, which is primarily associated with motor (i.e., muscle) control.

The spinal cord develops from the posterior neural tube. As the spinal cord develops, the cells making up the wall of the neural tube proliferate and differentiate into the neurons and glia of the spinal cord. The dorsal tissues will be associated with sensory functions, and the ventral tissues will be associated with motor functions. 

==Dorsal-ventral patterning==
The neural tube patterns along the dorsal-ventral axis to establish defined compartments of neural progenitor cells that lead to distinct classes of neurons. According to the French flag model of morphogenesis, this patterning occurs early in development and results from the activity of several secreted signaling molecules. Sonic hedgehog (Shh) is a key player in patterning the ventral axis, while bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs) and Wnt family members play an important role in patterning the dorsal axis. Other factors shown to provide positional information to the neural progenitor cells include fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) and retinoic acid. Retinoic acid is required ventrally along with Shh to induce Pax6 and Olig2 during differentiation of motor neurons.

Three main ventral cell types are established during early neural tube development: the &quot;floor plate cells&quot;, which form at the ventral midline during the neural fold stage; as well as the more dorsally located motor neurons and interneurons. These cell types are specified by the secretion of the Shh from the notochord (located ventrally to the neural tube), and later from the floor plate cells. Shh acts as a morphogen, meaning that it acts in a concentration-dependent manner to specify cell types as it moves further from its source.

The following is a proposed mechanism for how Shh patterns the ventral neural tube: A gradient of Shh that controls the expression of a group of homeodomain (HD) and basic Helix-Loop-Helix (bHLH) transcription factors is created. These transcription factors are grouped into two protein classes based on how Shh affects them. Class I is inhibited by Shh, whereas Class II is activated by Shh. These two classes of proteins then cross-regulate each other to create more defined boundaries of expression. The different combinations of expression of these transcription factors along the dorsal-ventral axis of the neural tube are responsible for creating the identity of the neuronal progenitor cells. Five molecularly distinct groups of ventral neurons form from these neuronal progenitor cells in vitro. Also, the position at which these neuronal groups are generated &quot;in vivo&quot; can be predicted by the concentration of Shh required for their induction in vitro. Studies have shown that neural progenitors can evoke different responses based on the length of exposure to Shh, with a longer exposure time resulting in more ventral cell types.

At the dorsal end of the neural tube, BMPs are responsible for neuronal patterning. BMP is initially secreted from the overlying ectoderm. A secondary signaling center is then established in the roof plate, the dorsal most structure of the neural tube. BMP from the dorsal end of the neural tube seems to act in the same concentration-dependent manner as Shh in the ventral end. This was shown using zebrafish mutants that had varying amounts of BMP signaling activity. Researchers observed changes in dorsal-ventral patterning, for example, zebrafish deficient in certain BMPs showed a loss of dorsal sensory neurons and an expansion of interneurons.

<doc id="208909" wikidata="Q1281272" url="?curid=208909" title="Peter Doig">
<text>Peter Doig ( ; born 17 April 1959) is a painter of Scottish nationality who has lived and worked between Trinidad, Canada, the USA, Germany and Britain. He settled in Trinidad with his family between 2002 and 2021, when he moved back to London. 

Best known for his uncanny landscapes, Doig&#x27;s work takes in a range of subjects inspired by his personal experiences, from snowscapes and ski scenes reminiscent of childhood memories from Canada, to beach and jungle scenes from Trinidad. In 2007, his painting &quot;White Canoe&quot; (1990-91) sold at Sotheby&#x27;s for $11.3 million, then an auction record for a living European artist. Art critic Jonathan Jones said about him: &quot;Amid all the nonsense, impostors, rhetorical bullshit and sheer trash that pass for art in the 21st century, Doig is a jewel of genuine imagination, sincere work and humble creativity.&quot;

==Early life==
Peter Doig was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, in 1959. In 1962, he moved with his family to Trinidad, where his father worked with a shipping and trading company, and then in 1966 to Canada. After boarding school in Scotland and working on a gas rig in western Canada, he moved to London to study at the Wimbledon School of Art in 1979–1980, Saint Martin&#x27;s School of Art from 1980 to 1983, and Chelsea School of Art, in 1989–1990, where he received an MA. In 1989, the artist held a part-time job as a dresser at the English National Opera.

Doig was invited to return to Trinidad in 2000, to take up an artist&#x27;s residency with his friend and fellow painter, Chris Ofili. In 2002, Doig moved back to the island, where he set up a studio at the Caribbean Contemporary Arts Centre near Port of Spain. He also became a professor at the Fine Arts Academy in Düsseldorf, Germany, where he was a faculty member until 2017.

==Artistic practice==
Many of Doig&#x27;s paintings are landscapes with a number harking back to the snowy scenes of his childhood in Canada, and others inspired by the scenery in Trinidad. He draws inspiration for his figurative work from a range of sources including photographs, newspaper clippings, movie scenes, record album covers, and the work of earlier artists like Edvard Munch, H. C. Westermann, Friedrich, Monet, and Klimt. While his works are frequently based on found photographs (and sometimes on his own) they are not painted in a photorealist style. In a 2008 interview, Doig referred to his use of photographs and postcards as painting &quot;by proxy&quot; and noted that his paintings &quot;made no attempt to reflect setting&quot;.

Shortly after Doig&#x27;s graduation from the Chelsea College of Arts, he was awarded the prestigious Whitechapel Artist Prize culminating in a solo exhibition at the Whitechapel Art Gallery in 1991. Included in the Whitechapel exhibition were &quot;Swamped&quot; (1990), &quot;Iron Hill&quot; (1991), and &quot;The Architect&#x27;s Home in the Ravine&quot; (1991), now considered among Doig&#x27;s major works. &quot;The Architect&#x27;s Home in the Ravine&quot; (1991) shows Eberhard Zeidler&#x27;s modernist central Toronto home in the Rosedale ravine.

Traces of human civilisation in natural settings are a cornerstone of Doig&#x27;s works, and his so-called &#x27;Concrete Cabins&#x27; are exemplary of this theme. As well as private homes and other dwellings in Canada and the USA, Doig created a series of paintings and works on paper of Le Corbusier&#x27;s modernist communal living apartments known as &quot;l&#x27;Unité d’Habitation&quot; located at Briey-en-Forêt, in France. In 1991, Doig was involved with a group of architects and artists known as La Première Rue who worked on the restoration of the building. The modern urban structures are partially revealed and hidden by the forest that surrounds them, a characteristic Doig explores in his works of the subject. Doig explained, &quot;I had no idea that I might paint the building, I just was there sort of literally scrapping paint off the inside of the building, scraping the varnish off. But then, you know, walking around the building and taking photographs of it, I realised that the photographs reminded me of some of the paintings I had already made, and I thought, ‘Maybe I could paint- maybe paint this building as well’. So, I started experimenting with these, you know, drawings and photographing and filming it and getting more and more excited about what I was seeing, really.&quot; 

Pop culture references also occur frequently in Doig&#x27;s work. Created in the late 1990s, a series of paintings and works on paper – including works such as &quot;Country-Rock (Wing Mirror)&quot; (1999) – depict a tunnel, a familiar landmark for Toronto residents since an anonymous artist painted a rainbow over it, at the northbound Don Valley Parkway, in 1972. The rainbow has been repainted more than 40 times over two decades, despite authorities’ attempts to remove it. His 1997 painting &quot;Canoe-Lake&quot; was inspired by the 1980 slasher film &quot;Friday the 13th&quot;. In 2003, Doig started a weekly film club called StudioFilmClub in his studio together with Trinidadian artist Che Lovelace. Doig not only selected and screened the films; he also painted posters advertising the week&#x27;s film. He told an interviewer that he found this ongoing project liberating because it was &quot;much more immediate&quot; than his usual work.

==Exhibitions==
Doig has had major solo exhibitions at Tate Britain (2008), touring to Musée d&#x27;Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris and Schirn Kunsthalle Frankfurt; Dallas Museum of Art (2005); Pinakothek der Moderne, Munich (2004); Bonnefanten Museum, Maastricht (2003); and Whitechapel Art Gallery, London (1998). In 2005, he was one of the artists exhibited in part 1 of &quot;The Triumph of Painting&quot; at the Saatchi Gallery in London. Doig&#x27;s first major exhibition in his home country was entitled &quot;No Foreign Lands&quot;, taking place in the Scottish National Gallery, in Edinburgh, from 3 August to 3 November 2013. It was critically acclaimed and showed works created in the previous ten years, mostly during his residence in Trinidad. 

The Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, in collaboration with the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, presented his own exhibition, the first major held in North America, from 25 January to 4 May 2014. A retrospective opened at Fondation Beyeler, Basel, in 2014, which travelled in 2015 to Louisiana Museum of Modern Art in Humlebaek, Denmark. Also in 2015, an exhibition of recent works opened at Fondazione Bevilacqua La Masa in Venice, Italy, coinciding with the 56th Venice Biennale. Recently his work was included in the group exhibition &quot;Cooperations&quot; at Fondation Beyeler (2017). From 6 September to 16 November 2019, Michael Werner Gallery hosted an exhibition of new paintings by Doig.

In February 2023 a four-month exhibition of new and recent works by Peter Doig opened at London’s Courtauld Gallery comprising 12 paintings and 20 works on paper. Most of these paintings were completed in London since his return from Trinidad in 2021, including &quot;Alpinist&quot;, &quot;Canal&quot;, &quot;Bather&quot;, &quot;Music Shop&quot;, &quot;House of Music (Soca Boat)&quot;, &quot;Self-Portrait (Fernandes Compound)&quot; and &quot;Alice at Boscoe’s&quot;. He was the first contemporary artist to show at the Courtauld since its redevelopment and his display of painterly skills was widely admired by critics. In late 2023 and into 2024, the Musée d&#x27;Orsay, Paris, hosted two exhibitions by Doig, one showcasing a selection of his large-scale works, including &quot;Two Trees&quot; (2017), and the other a selection of historic works from the museum collection, chosen by Doig. 

==Recognition==
In 1993, Doig won the first prize at the John Moores exhibition with his painting &quot;Blotter&quot;. This brought public recognition, cemented in 1994, when he was nominated for the Turner Prize. From 1995 to 2000, he was a trustee of the Tate Gallery. He was honoured with amfAR&#x27;s Award of Excellence for Artistic Contributions to the Fight Against AIDS in 2009. He was also named the 2017 Whitechapel Gallery Art Icon.

==Art market==
In 2007, a painting of Doig&#x27;s entitled &quot;White Canoe&quot; (1990-91) sold at Sotheby&#x27;s for $11.3 million, then an auction record for a work by a living European artist. Paul Schimmel, chief curator at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles said in an interview that the sale made Doig go from being &quot;a hero to other painters to a poster child of the excesses of the market&quot;.

In 2009, &quot;Night Playground&quot; (1997–98), a densely painted landscape painting being sold by Joel Mallin, a New York collector, went for $5 million at a Christie&#x27;s auction in London, well above its high estimate of $3 million. Also at Christie&#x27;s London, &quot;The Architect’s Home in the Ravine&quot; (1991) was auctioned at £7.66 million in early 2013. 

Later in 2013, César Reyes, a psychiatrist who lives in Puerto Rico and is one of the artist&#x27;s biggest collectors, sold &quot;Jetty&quot;, a 1994 canvas of a lone figure on a dock at sunset, for $11.3 million. His painting &quot;Gasthof zur Muldentalsperre&quot; (2000-02), now at the Art Institute of Chicago, was sold at Christie&#x27;s in 2014 for $17,038,276. This price was surpassed by &quot;Swamped&quot;, also sold at Christie&#x27;s in 2015 for $25,950,000 and in 2021 for $39,000,000. Phillips auctioned Peter Doig&#x27;s 1991 canvas, &quot;Rosedale&quot;, depicting a Toronto snowfall, which was guaranteed for $25 million and sold for $28.8 million to a telephone bidder, an auction record for the artist at the time.

In 2016, a former Canadian corrections officer began a $5 million lawsuit against Doig over a picture he claimed was by Doig despite the artist&#x27;s denial it was his work. A Chicago court ruled in Doig&#x27;s favour later that year, finding that the painting was the work of a similarly named man, Peter Doige. In 2023, Doig was awarded $2.5 million in sanctions against the painting&#x27;s owner, the art gallery representing the owner, and their lawyer.

==Collections==
Doig is represented in many international museum and private collections, including the Tel Aviv Museum of Art (&quot;The House that Jacques Built,&quot; 1992); Tate, London (&quot;Echo Lake&quot;, 1998); Tate Modern, London (&quot;Ski Jacket&quot;, 1994); and the National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa (&quot;Grande Riviere&quot;, 2001-02). He is also represented at the British Museum, in London; Walker Art Gallery, in Liverpool; Southampton City Art Gallery; the National Galleries of Scotland, in Edinburgh; Musée National d&#x27;Art Moderne, in Paris; Bonnefanten Museum, in Maastricht; Goetz Collection, in Munich; Kunsthalle, in Nuremberg; Museo Cantonale d&#x27;Arte, in Lugano; Museu de Arte Moderna - Colecção Berardo, in Sintra; National Gallery of Canada, in Ottawa; Art Institute of Chicago; Museum of Modern Art, in New York; Metropolitan Museum of Art, in New York; Whitney Museum of American Art, in New York; National Gallery of Art, in Washington, D.C.; The Hirshhorn Museum, in Washington; Philadelphia Museum of Art; and Dallas Museum of Art, among other public collections.

<doc id="208910" wikidata="Q1393497" url="?curid=208910" title="Unocal Corporation">
<text>Union Oil Company of California, and its holding company Unocal Corporation, together known as Unocal was a major petroleum explorer and marketer in the late 19th century, through the 20th century, and into the early 21st century. It was headquartered in El Segundo, California, United States.

Unocal was involved in domestic and global energy projects. Unocal was one of the key players in the CentGas consortium, which attempted to build the Trans-Afghanistan Pipeline to run from the Caspian area, through Afghanistan, to the Indian Ocean, at a time after the Taliban siege of Kabul in 1996.

On August 10, 2005, Unocal merged its entire upstream petroleum business with Chevron and became a wholly-owned subsidiary. Unocal then ceased operations as an independent company, but continues to conduct many operations as Union Oil Company of California, a Chevron company.

==History==
The Union Oil Company of California was founded on October 17, 1890, in Santa Paula, California, by Lyman Stewart, Thomas Bard, and Wallace Hardison. It was a merger of three Southern California oil companies: the Sespe Oil Company and the Torrey Canyon Oil Company (both owned by Bard) and the Hardison and Stewart Oil Company. All three were notable as being completely unaffiliated with Standard Oil. Union Oil moved its headquarters to Los Angeles in 1901. The original headquarters in Santa Paula is a California Historical Landmark and museum.

About 1910, Union Oil made a strategic alliance with the Independent Producers Agency, a group of small oil producers, to build pipelines from the Kern County oil fields to Union Oil facilities on the Pacific coast. This gave the independent producers an alternative to what they perceived as the low prices paid by Standard Oil and the high freight rates charged by the railroads to move crude oil. It gave Union access to a large volume of crude oil. The situation was later fictionalized in the 2007 film &quot;There Will Be Blood&quot;.

In 1919, the Union Oil Company of Delaware was incorporated as a holding company for the Union Oil Company of California. In 1920, Union Oil purchased the Central Petroleum Company from the Texas Company. In 1922, the Union Oil Associates, Inc., was incorporated in California as a holding company to prevent control of the Union Oil Company of California passing to foreign interests after the merger of the Union Oil Company of Delaware with Royal Dutch Company.
In 1961, Union entered the Indonesian oil market. Henry L. Brandon, Union&#x27;s vice president of international development wrote a &quot;contract of work&quot; arrangement, which was a first for Indonesia. In a speech on Indonesian Independence Day in August 1961, then president Sukarno talked at some length about &quot;production sharing&quot;, which included language written into the contract by Union executives.
The company expanded to national status in 1965, when Union Oil merged with the Pure Oil Company, headquartered in what was then Palatine, Illinois, and now Schaumburg, Illinois. Over the next two decades, Union became the major oil producer in southern Alaska and a major natural gas producer in the Gulf of Mexico. The company was reorganized in 1983, and Union Oil Company of California became an operating subsidiary of a new Delaware-based holding company, Unocal Corporation. In 1985, Mesa Petroleum, controlled by billionaire T. Boone Pickens, attempted a takeover of Unocal Corp. that resulted in the Delaware Supreme Court landmark decision Unocal v. Mesa Petroleum, which upheld Unocal&#x27;s takeover defense. Virtually all operations are conducted by Union Oil Company of California (Union Oil).

In 1977, Unocal acquired The Molybdenum Corporation of America (now Molycorp). Among the assets acquired was Mountain Pass rare earth mine, then the world&#x27;s largest producer of rare earth elements.

In 1989, Unocal placed its midwest refining and marketing assets, including Union&#x27;s Lemont Refinery in Lemont, Illinois, into a 50/50 joint venture with Petróleos de Venezuela, S.A. (P.D.V.S.A.). The joint venture, known as the Uno-Ven Company, was headquartered in Arlington Heights, Illinois, and primarily comprising employees from Union Oil&#x27;s then Schaumburg, Illinois, division headquarters and Lemont, Illinois, refinery. The joint venture was dissolved in 1997, with P.D.V.S.A. receiving full ownership. During the life of the joint venture, the familiar Union 76 brand name continued in full force. At the termination of the joint venture, most stations were converted to Citgo, which is controlled by P.D.V.S.A.

In 1997, Unocal sold its western United States refining and marketing operations to Tosco Corporation, including the rights to the Union 76 brand for refining and marketing (except in states where Uno-Ven operated). Tosco was later acquired by Phillips Petroleum, which later merged with Conoco to form ConocoPhillips. As of January 2025, Chevron still maintains a common law trademark of Unocal.com, which redirects to the Chevron webpage.

===Acquisition===
In April 2005, the United States oil company Chevron made an offer to acquire Unocal for US$16.6 billion, which was followed, after the companies had agreed to the transaction, by a competing unsolicited bid from the Chinese firm CNOOC Limited of US$18.5 billion on June 22. The final Chevron offer of $17.9 billion was approved by Unocal shareholders on August 10. The final CNOOC bid was nearly 5% greater than that of Chevron, but faced significant political opposition from the United States Congress and was finally withdrawn by CNOOC August 2 citing the associated political uncertainty. Following a vote in the United States House of Representatives, the CNOOC bid was referred to President George W. Bush, on the grounds that its implications for national security needed to be reviewed.

==Operations==

===Central Asia===
Unocal was one of the key players in the CentGas consortium, an attempt to build the Trans-Afghanistan Pipeline to run from the Caspian area, through Afghanistan and probably Pakistan, to the Indian Ocean. One of the consultants to Unocal at that time was Zalmay Khalilzad, former US ambassador to Afghanistan, Iraq, and the United Nations.

In the 1980s, CIA chief Bill Casey had revived the agency&#x27;s practice of gaining intelligence from traveling businessmen. Marty Miller, one of Unocal&#x27;s top executives, conducted negotiations in several Central Asian countries from 1995, and voluntarily provided information gained on these trips to the CIA&#x27;s Houston station.

In 1996, Unocal opened an office in Kandahar, Afghanistan, while the Taliban were in the process of taking control of the country.

In 1997,

Unocal seems to have had a deeper role. Intelligence &quot;whistleblower&quot; Julie Sirrs claimed that anti-Taliban leader Ahmad Shah Massoud told her he had &quot;proof that Unocal had provided money that helped the Taliban take Kabul [in 1996]&quot;. And French journalist Richard Labeviere said, referring to the later 1990s, &quot;The CIA and Unocal&#x27;s security forces ... provided military weapons and instructors to several Taleban militia[s] ...&quot; US State Department officials openly promoted the pipeline, and former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger served as a Unocal consultant.

The Taliban and Unocal were in negotiations in Texas to discuss arrangements for the gas pipeline from Turkmenistan to Pakistan in 1997 although it faced competition with from the Argentine Bridas Corporation.

While no deal was ultimately agreed with either company, the Taliban were leaning toward making a deal with Unocal as of August 1998. The company suspended work on the project following the U.S. cruise missile strikes on Afghanistan in response to the 1998 U.S. Embassy bombings and completely pulled out in December 1998 citing low oil prices and a need to cut costs in addition to regional instability.

Unocal was also the third-largest member of the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline from the Caspian Sea to the Mediterranean Sea.

===Indonesia===
Unocal entered the Indonesian market in 1961. Under the leadership of Henry L. Brandon (VP of International Development), Union Oil was the first US oil company to sign a production sharing agreement (contract of work) with President Suharto.

==Sponsorships==
Union Oil was the sponsor of the Major Burnham Bowling Trophy, an annual California bowling event supported by the Boy Scouts of America and named after Major Frederick Russell Burnham.

76 was the official fuel and motor oil of NASCAR from the sport&#x27;s inaugural season in 1948 until the end of the 2003 season when Sunoco became the official fuel and Mobil 1 became the official motor oil. 

76 was an initial sponsor of the Los Angeles Dodgers when the team relocated from Brooklyn in 1958. The 76 logo was the only corporate sponsorship visible in Dodger Stadium for many years after it opened in 1962. 76 logos currently adorn the batter&#x27;s on-deck circles and the logo is atop the two large scoreboards in right and left field. A 76 gas station was located in the Dodger Stadium parking lot for decades. It is no longer an operating station, but the building continues to stand, serving as an event space. The 76 logo is often seen in other Major League Baseball and National Football League stadiums on the west coast.

==Controversy==

===Domestic US criticism===
In 1969, a blowout on the ocean bottom near Union Oil&#x27;s Platform &quot;A&quot; on the Dos Cuadras field leaked between 80,000 and of oil into the water of the Santa Barbara Channel, near Santa Barbara, California. The event led to widespread criticism of both Union Oil and the offshore oil drilling industry, and was one of the events leading to the passage of the 1970 National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).

Oil pipes under Avila Beach, California, leaked from the 1950s until 1996. A real estate firm determined the soil to be contaminated in 1989 and Unocal agreed to clean up the soil they contaminated. To clean up the massive spill, the crew had to excavate enough soil to fill a football field up to high.

Between the mid-1950s and 1994, Unocal leaked of diluent—a petroleum derivative pumped into heavy oil fields to make the oil flow freely—under the Guadalupe-Nipomo Dunes and nearby ocean water, the largest oil spill in California&#x27;s history. The pipelines had leaks in at least 90 places. Locals had noticed a strange sheen on the ocean surface, and dead seals and sea lions began washing up onto the beach. Although Unocal denied having any problems, records discovered by state fish and game officers disclosed that Unocal had long been aware of the leaks. Unocal has been actively cleaning up the site since the mid-90s, receiving praise from the Sierra Club for their habitat restoration work.

===&quot;Doe v. Unocal&quot;===

In the &quot;Doe v. Unocal&quot; case, Burmese villagers sued Unocal for complicity in forced labor, rape, torture, and murder. EarthRights International, the Center for Constitutional Rights, Paul Hoffman, Hadsell &amp; Stormer, and Judith Brown Chomsky served as co-counsel to the plaintiffs. In 2005, a settlement agreement was reached to compensate the plaintiffs.

<text>Charenton-le-Pont () is a commune situated to the southeast of Paris, France. It is located from the centre of Paris, to the north of the confluence of the Seine and Marne rivers; the part of the name refers to the stone bridge across the Marne. It is one of the most densely populated municipalities in Europe.

The Charenton Psychiatric Hospital is located in the neighbouring commune Charenton-Saint-Maurice, which changed its name in 1842 to Saint Maurice.

==History==
A Bronze Age hoard of weapons was found in the river Seine at Charenton in the late nineteenth century. Comprising swords, axes, spearheads and other miscellaneous objects, it is now in the British Museum.

Charenton was always a point of importance for the defence of the capital, and was frequently the scene of bloody conflicts. The fort of Charenton, located in Maisons-Alfort but intended to defend Charenton, is one of the older forts of the Paris defence.

In the 16th and 17th centuries, Charenton was the scene of the ecclesiastical councils of the Protestant party, which had its principal church in the town.

In the now-named commune St Maurice, adjoining Charenton to the east, is the Hospice de Charenton, a psychiatric hospital, the foundation of which dates from 1641. Until the time of the Revolution it was used as a general hospital, and even as a prison, but from 1802 onwards it was specially appropriated to the treatment of mental illness.

On 1 January 1860, the city of Paris was enlarged by annexing neighbouring communes. On that occasion, half of the commune of Bercy was annexed to the city of the Paris, and the remaining half was annexed to Charenton-le-Pont.

In 1929, the commune of Charenton-le-Pont lost about a third of its territory when the city of Paris annexed the Bois de Vincennes, a small part of which belonged to Charenton-le-Pont.

==Population==

==Transport==
Charenton-le-Pont is served by two stations on Paris Métro Line 8: Liberté and Charenton — Écoles.

===History===
There was also another station in the commune that existed from 1849 to 1942 and then was demolished.

==Education==
 the commune has 14 public and private schools.
*Public preschools (&quot;écoles maternelles&quot;): 4 vents, Cerisae, Champ des Alouettes, Conflans, Port au Lions, and Valmy 
*Public elementary schools: Briand A, Briand B, Desnos, Pasteur, and Valmy
*Collège la Cerisaie (junior high school)
*Lycée Robert Schuman (public senior high school/sixth-form college)
*Notre dame des Missions (private school, elementary through senior high school/sixth form college)

==Sport==
Charenton shares the association football club CA Paris-Charenton with the nearby town Maisons-Alfort. They play in all red with blue shorts. They are a merger between CA Paris (founded in 1892)—who won the 1920 Coupe de France, were second place in the 1928 Coupe de France, played in the first two seasons of Ligue 1, and then played in Ligue 2 until 1963—and SO Charentonnais (founded in 1904). The two merged in 1964. The club is chaired by Oscar Gonçalves. They mainly play at the Stade Henri Guérin in Charenton, but also play many matches at the Stade Charentonneau in Maisons-Alfort.
