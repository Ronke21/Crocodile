<text>Speen is a village and civil parish in West Berkshire, England. It is north west of the town of Newbury, Speen has clustered settlements, the largest of which is Speen village, which is contiguous with Newbury, and the others, buffered from the town by the A34 road, are Bagnor, Stockcross, Woodspeen and Marsh Benham. Its other land is an approximately even mixture of woodland and agricultural fields including hay meadows for livestock feed and pasture. The area varies greatly in elevation, having the Reading to Taunton Line alongside the north bank of the River Kennet as its southern boundary and both banks of the River Lambourn in its north with elevated ground in between. Benham Park in the south-west of the area is a listed landscape garden and house.

==History==

Wickham Heath occupies the far west of the parish and has plantations of trees, such as conifers which are felled for pulp and wood products.
Speen has the frequently interrupted footpath marking the Ermin Way, the main Roman road from Corinium Dobunnorum (Cirencester) to Calleva Atrebatum (Silchester). The Second Battle of Newbury during the English Civil War was fought at Speen on 27 October 1644. Speenhamland in the parish, now part of Newbury, was the home of the Speenhamland system of outdoor relief.

==Landmarks==
===Parish church===
The Church of England parish church of Saint Mary the Virgin is late Saxon and is the oldest church in Berkshire. It is the burial place of Giovanni Battista Castiglione (1515–98), Elizabeth I&#x27;s Italian tutor and servant, who was given the nearby Benham Valence house and park in 1570.

===The Ladywell or lady well===
The church was built near one of the holy wells of Christendom, which, is as with many wells, an enlarged spring. Tenuous local tradition says its water is able to cure eye diseases and other ills, and there have been reports it is haunted. Some of the village people have seen an old woman with white hair and wearing a blue rain mac wandering around the grave yard and up the path the well is situated on. The Ladywell was fenced off in the Victorian era.

===Speen House===
Next to the above sites are ramparts around the elevated Speen House, the latest incarnation of Speen manor house, which is mostly late 18th century, but incorporates a minority of building materials from its 17th century predecessor. Early historians have dated a few stones among the foundations to the Roman village of &quot;Spinae&quot;, but it is more likely that these oldest stones were sourced and hewn for the late medieval manor house, nothing else of which survives.

===Benham Park===
Benham Park or Benham Valence Manor, is a landscape garden by Capability Brown, centred on the house built by Henry Holland for William, 6th Baron Craven in 1775. It was later the home of his widow, Elizabeth, and her second husband, the Margrave of Anspach. Both the house and park are Grade II* listed. One of its pairs of grand and ornate gate piers (pilasters) is separately Grade I listed.

==Transport==
Speen railway station, on the Lambourn Valley Railway, served the parish until it was closed in 1960. The nearest railway station now is . 

The A34 road cuts through the middle of the parish in a roughly straight line north–south. It has the nucleus of the village to its east close to one of the three Newbury junctions and the road proceeds to a junction with the M4 Motorway at Chieveley. There are local bus services to Newbury, Lambourn and Hungerford.

<text>The Jātaka (Sanskrit for &quot;Birth-Related&quot; or &quot;Birth Stories&quot;) are a voluminous body of literature native to the Indian subcontinent which mainly concern the previous births of Gautama Buddha in both human and animal form. Jataka stories were depicted on the railings and torans of the stupas. According to Peter Skilling, this genre is &quot;one of the oldest classes of Buddhist literature.&quot; Some of these texts are also considered great works of literature in their own right. The various Indian Buddhist schools had different collections of jātakas. The largest known collection is the &quot;Jātakatthavaṇṇanā&quot; of the Theravada school, as a textual division of the Pāli Canon, included in the &quot;Khuddaka Nikaya&quot; of the &quot;Sutta Pitaka&quot;.
In these stories, the future Buddha may appear as a king, an outcaste, a deva, an animal—but, in whatever form, he exhibits some virtue that the tale thereby inculcates. Often, Jātaka tales include an extensive cast of characters who interact and get into various kinds of trouble – whereupon the Buddha character intervenes to resolve all the problems and bring about a happy ending. The Jātaka genre is based on the idea that the Buddha was able to recollect all his past lives and thus could use these memories to tell a story and illustrate his teachings.

For the Buddhist traditions, the jātakas illustrate the many lives, acts and spiritual practices which are required on the long path to Buddhahood. They also illustrate the great qualities or perfections of the Buddha (such as generosity) and teach Buddhist moral lessons, particularly within the framework of karma and rebirth. Jātaka stories have also been illustrated in Buddhist architecture throughout the Buddhist world and they continue to be an important element in popular Buddhist art. Some of the earliest such illustrations can be found at Sanchi and Bharhut.

According to Naomi Appleton, Jātaka collections also may have played &quot;an important role in the formation and communication of ideas about buddhahood, karma and merit, and the place of the Buddha in relation to other buddhas and bodhisattvas.&quot; According to the traditional view found in the Pali &quot;Jātakanidana&quot;, a prologue to the stories, Gautama made a vow to become a Buddha in the future, in front past Buddha Dipankara. He then spent many lifetimes on the path to Buddhahood, and the stories from these lives are recorded as Jātakas.

Jātakas are closely related to (and often overlap with) another genre of Buddhist narrative, the avadāna, which is a story of any karmically significant deed (whether by a bodhisattva or otherwise) and its result. According to Naomi Appleton, some tales (such as those found in the second and fourth decade of the &quot;Avadānaśataka&quot;) can be classified as both a jātaka and an avadāna.

== Overview ==
=== Dating ===
&quot;Jātaka&quot; tales may be quite ancient. The term appears as part of a schema of Buddhist literary forms called the nine component genres of the Buddha&#x27;s teaching (&quot;navaṅga-buddhasāsana&quot;), and depictions of them appear in early Indian art (as early as the second century BCE). They are also widely represented in ancient Indian inscriptions. According to Straube, &quot;the presumably oldest specimens of fully elaborated narratives are dispersed throughout the Vinayapiṭakas and Sūtrapiṭakas of the canonical collections of the different Buddhist schools. These texts are transmitted in various Indian dialects and stem from a prior oral tradition.&quot;

Furthermore, while these texts cannot be dated in a precise manner, &quot;the fact that many narratives are passed on in almost identical form within the canons of the different schools shows that they date back to the time before the schisms between the schools took place.&quot; Sarah Shaw, writing on the Pali &quot;Jātaka&quot;, states that the earliest part of the &quot;Jātaka&quot;, the verse portions, are &quot;considered amongst the very earliest part of the Pali tradition and date from the fifth century BCE&quot; while &quot;the later parts were incorporated during the period up to the third century CE.&quot;

According to A. K. Warder, &quot;jātaka&quot; are the precursors to the various legendary biographies of the Buddha, which were composed at later dates. Although many &quot;jātaka&quot; were written from an early period, which describe previous lives of the Buddha, very little biographical material about Gautama&#x27;s own life has been recorded. &quot;Jātaka&quot; tales also assimilate many traditional Indian fables and folklore that are not specifically Buddhist. As the genre spread outside of India, it also drew on local folk tales.

=== Literary features and themes ===
The Mahayana author Asaṅga provides a working definition of &quot;jātaka&quot; in his &quot;Śrāvakabhūmi&quot;:What is &quot;jātaka&quot;? That which relates the austere practices and bodhisattva practices of the Blessed One in various past births: this is called &quot;jātaka&quot;.The idea that &quot;jātaka&quot; are taught in order to illustrate the bodhisattva path is an ancient one and is contained in sources like the &quot;Mahavastu&quot;, which states: &quot;the supreme ones [Buddhas], who are skilled in jātakas and other doctrines, teach the course of practice of a bodhisattva.&quot;
Many jātakas are told with a common threefold plot schema which contains:
* a &quot;narrative in the present&quot; (&quot;paccupannavatthu&quot;), with the Buddha and other figures,
* a &quot;narrative in the past&quot; (&quot;atītavatthu&quot;), a story from a past life of the Buddha
* a &quot;link&quot; (&quot;samodhāna&quot;) in which there is an &quot;identification of the past protagonists with the present ones.&quot;

In the &quot;jātaka&quot; found in the &quot;Suttapitaka&quot;, which are almost always in prose, the Buddha is almost always depicted as a person of high rank in a past life (and not an animal). Some of these also include past lives of some of the Buddha&#x27;s disciples. One famous example is the Pali &quot;Mahāparinirvāṇasūtra&quot;, which includes the story of Mahāsudarśana. Unlike Sutra collections, Vinaya sources like the &quot;Vinayavastu&quot; contain more varied jātakas, including ones in which the Buddha is depicted as an animal.

Many &quot;jātaka&quot; contain elements of both verse and prose. According to Martin Straube &quot;the division into canonical verses and postcanonical prose points to the old Indian narrative form of ākhyāna, which has a fixed wording of the stanzas only, whereas the actual story is to be shaped anew during each oral performance.&quot; The plots of the &quot;jātaka&quot; range from simpler Aesopic style animal tales to longer more complex dramas which resemble epics or novels with intricate dialogue, characters and poetry. Despite the diversity of the plots and characters, they are all unified by the character of the heroic bodhisattva Gautama (whose identity is generally only revealed at the end of the story) and his struggles on the quest for awakening. In spite of this, Gautama is not always the central character of all these stories and sometimes only plays a minor role. Other recurring characters include important disciples of the Buddha, Devadatta (generally as a villain) and members of Gautama&#x27;s family, like his wife Yasodharā and son Rāhula.

Another important element of the stories are the various Buddhist virtues, called perfections, that were cultivated by the bodhisattva Gautama throughout his previous lives, and which serve as the lessons taught by the jātakas. Other jātakas, such as those found in the &quot;Buddhavaṃsa&quot; (&quot;Chronicle of Buddhas&quot;), focus on Gautama&#x27;s meeting, serving and venerating past Buddhas and serve to place his bodhisattva path in a chronology of past Buddhas. These stories generally focus on acts of devotion to past Buddhas and how this generates much merit which many positive outcomes in the future. A smaller number of jātakas illustrate various mistakes or bad actions that the bodhisattva committed in a past life (and the subsequent karmic retribution) and thus demonstrate the bodhisattva&#x27;s past imperfections.

Regarding the intended audience of these texts, Martin Straube notes that even though there is a widespread view that jātakas arose due to monks &quot;catering to the needs and tastes of the illiterate lay practitioners of Buddhism as propagandistic means of preaching or converting&quot; there is no historical evidence for this. Instead, the opposite might be true, since &quot;the prose portions of the Pali jātakas not infrequently have as their audience monks and nuns, who sometimes reach high levels of spiritual realization after listening to a jātaka story.&quot; Naomi Appleton, in her analysis of the second and fourth decade of the &quot;Avadānaśataka&quot;, notes that both sets of stories &quot;assume a monastic audience.&quot; Likewise, Kate Crosby writes that &quot;the format of the Jātaka in fact suggests that their original inclusion in the canonical collection was primarily for the benefit of monks.&quot; Crosby notes that many of these stories are connected with monastic behavior and decorum, some of them are also meant to illustrate specific rules in the Vinaya. In spite of this main intended audience, their simple format also made them easily adaptable for other uses. Thus, they were repackaged as artistic entertainment and teaching devices for laypersons, as parittas (protective chants) and as chronicle (vamsa) literature.

Straube also notes that the rock caves of Ajanta and Bagh were inhabited by monks and it was them who ordered and directed the jātaka murals found there. There is also evidence from inscriptions on old stūpas at various Indian sites (such as Sanchi and Bharhut) with jātaka motifs which indicate that they were built due to the patronage of monks and nuns, some of them of high rank such as bhāṇaka (reciter). Some scholars have also concluded that Jātaka reciters were part of their own division of reciters.

=== History ===
Jātakas were originally transmitted in prakrit languages and various forms of Sanskrit (from classical to Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit). They were then translated into central Asian languages (such as Khotanese, Tocharian, Uighur, and Sogdian)&quot;.&quot; Various jātaka stories and source texts were also translated into Chinese and Tibetan for the Tibetan and Chinese Buddhist canons. They were some of the first texts to be translated into Chinese. Kāng Sēnghuì (who worked in Nanking c. 247) was one of the first Chinese translators of Jātakas. Perhaps his most influential translation is the &quot;Scripture of the Collection of the Six Perfections.&quot;

The various Indian Buddhist schools had different collections of jātakas. The largest known collection is the &quot;Jātakatthavaṇṇanā&quot; of the Theravada school. In Theravada Buddhism, the Jātakas are a textual division of the Pāli Canon, included in the &quot;Khuddaka Nikaya&quot; of the &quot;Sutta Pitaka&quot;. The term &quot;Jātaka&quot; may also refer to a traditional commentaries (&quot;Atthakatha&quot;) on this book. The tales are dated between 300 BCE and 400 CE.

The Mahāsāṃghika Caitika sects from the Āndhra region also had Jātakas as part of their canon and they are known to have rejected some of the Theravāda Jātakas which dated past the time of King Ashoka. The Caitikas claimed that their own Jātakas represented the original collection before the Buddhist tradition split into various lineages.

In the Northern Buddhist tradition, Jātakas eventually came to be composed in classical Sanskrit. Perhaps the most influential and important Sanskrit Jātaka text is the &quot;Jātakamālā&quot; (&quot;Garland of Jātakas&quot;) of Āryaśūra which includes 34 Jātaka stories. This work differs from earlier sources in that it is a highly sophisticated poem which makes use of various Sanskrit literary devices. The &quot;Jātakamālā&quot; was quite influential and was imitated by later authors who wrote their own jātakamālās&quot;,&quot; mainly Haribhaṭṭa and Gopadatta. These works are all written in a classical Sanskrit genre known as campū, which is a blend of prose and verse in various meters. The jātakamālās all also use the six perfections (pāramitā) as their main framework. The influence of the &quot;jātakamālās&quot; can be seen in the Ajanta Cave complex, where illustrations of Jātakas are inscribed with quotes from Āryaśūra, with script datable to the sixth century. The &quot;Jātakamālā&quot; was also translated into Chinese in 434 CE. Borobudur, a massive 9th century Buddhist site in Java, contains depictions of all 34 Jatakas from the &quot;Jātakamālā&quot;.

Two other Sanskrit authors associated with the jātaka genre are Kumāralāta (2nd century CE), author of the &quot;Kalpanāmaṇḍitikā Dṛṣṭāntapaṅkti&quot; (&quot;Collection of Examples, Adorned with an Artistic Arrangement&quot;) and Saṅghasena&#x27;s (date unknown) &quot;Pusa benyuan jing&quot; (菩薩本縁經; &quot;Sūtra of the Bodhisattva&#x27;s Avadānas&quot;). Both works exist only in Chinese translation (but there are Sanskrit fragments). These texts are a kind of predecessor to the &quot;Jātakamālā&quot; and are less poetically sophisticated.

Later Sanskrit authors continued to write in the genre. One such late text is Kṣemendra&#x27;s (c. 1036–1065) &quot;Bodhisattvāvadānakalpalatā (Wish-Fulfilling Creeper Consisting in Avadānas of the Bodhisattva),&quot; a unique jātaka text written completely in verse. This work was influential on the Tibetan tradition.

Jātaka are also important in Tibetan Buddhism. They were one of the main sources of teaching and study for the popular Kadam school and later Tibetan authors produced abridged collections such as Karmapa Rangjung Dorje&#x27;s &quot;Hundred Births&quot; and Padma Chopel&#x27;s summary of the &quot;Avadānakalpalatā.&quot;

=== Late Jātakas ===
Within the Pali tradition, there are also many non-canonical Jātakas of later composition (some dated even to the 19th century) but these are treated as a separate category of literature from the &quot;official&quot; Jātaka stories that have been more or less formally canonized from at least the 5th century — as attested to in ample epigraphic and archaeological evidence, such as extant illustrations in bas relief from ancient temple walls. Apocryphal Jātakas of the Pali Buddhist canon, such as those belonging to the &quot;Paññāsa Jātaka&quot; collection, have been adapted to fit local culture in certain South East Asian countries and have been retold with amendments to the plots to better reflect Buddhist morals. According to Kate Crosby, &quot;there is also a collection of Jātaka of ten future Buddhas, beginning with Metteyya, which though less well-known today clearly circulated widely in the Theravada world.&quot;

There are also late compositions based on classic Jātakas, such as the &quot;Kavsiḷumiṇa,&quot; a poem based on the Kusa Jātaka in archaic Sinhala written King Parākkamabāhu II (13th century) and the &quot;Mahachat kham luang&quot;, the &#x27;royal version&#x27; of the &quot;Vessantara jātaka,&quot; which was composed at the court of King Paramatrailokanātha (c. 1482). The art of putting classic Jātakas into Thai verse remains a living tradition to this day.

== Important Jātakas ==


=== In Theravada ===

The Theravāda Jātakas comprise 547 poems, arranged roughly by an increasing number of verses. According to Professor von Hinüber, only the last 50 were intended to be intelligible by themselves, without commentary. The commentary gives stories in prose that it claims provide the context for the verses, and it is these stories that are of interest to folklorists. Alternative versions of some of the stories can be found in another book of the Pali Canon, the &quot;Cariyapitaka&quot;, and a number of individual stories can be found scattered around other books of the Canon. Many of the stories and motifs found in the Jātaka such as the Rabbit in the Moon of the Śaśajātaka (Jataka Tales: no.316), are found in numerous other languages and media.

== Jātakas in art and culture ==

Jātakas have been important as a way to spread Buddhist teachings and they were widely used as part of sermons, rituals, festivals, and various forms of art. Kate Crosby writes that they have been depicted in such varied forms as &quot;apocryphal literature, vernacular retellings, performance, temple art, temporary street and festival art, films, comics, and cartoons.&quot; The sponsorship of Jātaka recitations, copyings and art eventually grew to be seen as an act which generated merit for lay Buddhists. These acts are more common around important festivals like Vesak.
The earliest archeological findings which depict Jātakas are the illustrations found in the on the Bharhut stupa railing as well as at Sanchi (c. late 2nd – 1st century BCE), which also include inscriptions. After this, Jātakas appear at many Buddhist sites, like at Ajanta. Similar Jātaka tales are found in murals of Silk Road sites of the pre-Tang period (ca. 421–640 C.E.), such as at Kucha. They are also found in early Southeast Asian sites, especially at Bagan sites. Burmese Buddhism has an extensive tradition of Jātaka illustration, one of the best examples being the illustrations found at Ananda Temple (which depicts 554 tales).
Jātaka tales are often associated with specific locations. Originally, this applied to specific places in India, which served as Buddhist pilgrimage sites. Later traditions expanded this to include other places throughout the Buddhist world. According to Naomi Appleton, the fact that Jātaka tales lack specific references to specific places allowed them to be easily transported and re-localized. This flexibility contributed to the lasting popularity of the Jātakas. This tradition of associating Jātaka tales with regions outside of India played an important part in the promotion and legitimisation of Buddhism in these regions.

Thus, many stupas in Nepal and northern India are said to mark locations from the Jātaka tales. Chinese pilgrims like Xuanzang and Faxian reported several of these and discussed the stories connected with them. Sites discussed by these figures include the &quot;four great stupas&quot; as well as stupas in Pushkalavati, Mangalura, Hadda Mountain, and Sarvadattaan.

According to Naomi Appleton, the &quot;four great stupas&quot; visited by Faxian (337–422 CE) are: the first (in &#x27;So-ho-to&#x27;) was where the Buddha ransomed the life of a dove with his own flesh; the second (in Gandhāra) was where he gave away his eyes to a blind beggar; and the third and fourth (in Takshaśilā) were where he gave away his head to a man and his whole body to a starving tigress who was about to eat her own cubs, and where &#x27;kings, ministers, and peoples of all the kingdoms around vie with one another in making offerings&#x27;. A century later, Songyun writes of the same four sites and also mentions a whole area associated with the &quot;Vessantara-jātaka&quot;. 

=== Artistic depictions at major sites ===
Numerous Indian Buddhist archeological sites contain illustrations of Jātakas, and thus they are important artistic sources for Jātakas. Some of the main sites include:

* Ajanta Caves
* Amaravati
* Bagh Caves
* Bharhut
* Goli
* Kanaganahalli
* Mathura
* Nagarjunakonda
* Sanchi

Other ancient sites outside of India which contain Jataka illustrations include Borobudor, Dunhuang (the Mogao caves), Polonnoruwa, Anuradhapura, Bagan city, and Nakhon Pathom. Jataka illustrations (especially of the last 10 stories of the canonical Pali collection) are widespread in the Theravada Buddhist world, adorning many temples, wats and key sites.

=== Performance ===
According to the Chinese pilgrim Yijing, who visited India in the 7th century, jātaka plays were performed &#x27;throughout the five countries of India&#x27;. This culture of performance spread to other regions as well.

In Tibet, the &quot;Viśvāntara-jātaka&quot; was transformed into a popular play called the &quot;Dri med kun ldan&quot;. Other popular jataka plays include Nor bzaṅ or Sudhana and the story of Prince Maṇicūḍa (Lokānanda).

In Theravada countries, several of the longer tales such as &quot;The Twelve Sisters&quot; and the &quot;Vessantara Jataka&quot; are still performed in dance, theatre, puppetry, and formal (quasi-ritual) recitation. Such celebrations are associated with particular holidays on the lunar calendar used by Thailand, Myanmar, Sri Lanka and Laos. The recitation of the &quot;Vessantara Jataka&quot; remains an important ceremony remains an important ceremony in Theravada countries today.

== In other religions ==
Stories which are similar to the jātakas are also found in Jainism, which has stories focused on Mahavira&#x27;s path to enlightenment in previous lives. The Jain stories include Mahavira&#x27;s numerous forms of rebirth, such as animals as well as encounters with past liberated beings (jinas) which predict Mahavira&#x27;s future enlightenment. However, a major difference here is that, while Mahavira gets a prediction of future enlightenment, he does not make a vow to become a jina in the future, unlike the bodhisattva Gautama. There is also no equivalent idea of a bodhisattva path in Jainism, in-spite of the existence of some narratives about Mahavira&#x27;s past lives.

A similar collection of Indian animal fables is the Hindu &quot;Pañcatantra&quot;, which has been dated to around 200 BCE.

Some Buddhist jātakas were also adopted and retold by Islamic (and later Christian) authors, such as the 10th century Shia scholar Ibn Bābūya, who adapted a jātaka into a story titled Balawhar wa-Būdāsf, which became the Christian narrative of Barlaam and Joasaph.

<text>Bicameralism is a type of legislature that is divided into two separate assemblies, chambers, or houses, known as a bicameral legislature. Bicameralism is distinguished from unicameralism, in which all members deliberate and vote as a single group. , roughly 40% of the world&#x27;s national legislatures are bicameral, while unicameralism represents 60% nationally and much more at the subnational level.

Often, the members of the two chambers are elected or selected by different methods, which vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. This can often lead to the two chambers having very different compositions of members.

Enactment of primary legislation often requires a concurrent majority—the approval of a majority of members in each of the chambers of the legislature. When this is the case, the legislature may be called an example of perfect bicameralism. However, in many parliamentary and semi-presidential systems, the house to which the executive is responsible (e.g. House of Commons of the UK and National Assembly of France) can overrule the other house (e.g. House of Lords of the UK and Senate of France) and may be regarded as an example of imperfect bicameralism. Some legislatures lie in between these two positions, with one house able to overrule the other only under certain circumstances.

==History of bicameral legislatures==


The British Parliament is often referred to as the &quot;Mother of Parliaments&quot; (in fact a misquotation of John Bright, who remarked in 1865 that &quot;England is the Mother of Parliaments&quot;) because the British Parliament has been the model for most other parliamentary systems, and its Acts have created many other parliaments. The origins of British bicameralism can be traced to 1341, when the Commons met separately from the nobility and clergy for the first time, creating what was effectively an Upper Chamber and a Lower Chamber, with the knights and burgesses sitting in the latter. This Upper Chamber became known as the House of Lords from 1544 onward, and the Lower Chamber became known as the House of Commons, collectively known as the Houses of Parliament.

Many nations with parliaments have to some degree emulated the British &quot;three-tier&quot; model. Most countries in Europe and the Commonwealth have similarly organised parliaments with a largely ceremonial head of state who formally opens and closes parliament, a large elected lower house, and (unlike Britain) a smaller upper house.

The Founding Fathers of the United States also favoured a bicameral legislature. The idea was to have the Senate be wealthier and wiser. Benjamin Rush saw this though, and noted that &quot;this type of dominion is almost always connected with opulence&quot;. The Senate was created to be a stabilising force, not elected by mass electors, but selected by the State legislators. Senators would be more knowledgeable and more deliberate—a sort of republican nobility—and a counter to what James Madison saw as the &quot;fickleness and passion&quot; that could absorb the House.

He noted further that &quot;The use of the Senate is to consist in its proceeding with more coolness, with more system and with more wisdom, than the popular branch.&quot; Madison&#x27;s argument led the Framers to grant the Senate prerogatives in foreign policy, an area where steadiness, discretion, and caution were deemed especially important. State legislators chose the Senate, and senators had to possess significant property to be deemed worthy and sensible enough for the position. In 1913, the 17th amendment passed, which mandated choosing Senators by popular vote rather than State legislatures.

As part of the Great Compromise, the Founding Fathers invented a new rationale for bicameralism in which the Senate had an equal number of delegates per state, and the House had representatives by relative populations.

==Rationale for bicameralism and criticism==
Federal states have often adopted it as an awkward compromise between existing power held equally by each state or territory and a more democratic proportional legislature. For states considering a different constitutional arrangement that may shift power to new groupings, bicameralism could be demanded by currently hegemonic groups who would otherwise prevent any structural shift (e.g. military dictatorships, aristocracies).

The growing awareness of the complexity of the notion of representation and the multi-functional nature of modern legislatures may be affording incipient new rationales for second chambers, though these do generally remain contested institutions in ways that first chambers are not. An example of political controversy regarding a second chamber has been the debate over the powers of the Senate of Canada or the election of the Senate of France. Bicameral legislatures as a result have been trending down for some time with unicameral, proportional legislatures seen as more democratic and effective.

The relationship between the two chambers varies: in some cases, they have equal power, while in others, one chamber (the directly elected lower house with proportional representation) is clearly superior in its powers. The first tends to be the case in federal systems and those with presidential governments. The second tends to be the case in unitary states with parliamentary systems. There are two streams of thought: critics believe bicameralism makes meaningful political reforms more difficult to achieve and increases the risk of gridlock—particularly in cases where both chambers have similar powers—while proponents argue the merits of the &quot;checks and balances&quot; provided by the bicameral model, which they believe help prevent ill-considered legislation.

==Communication between houses==
Formal communication between houses is by various methods, including:
;Sending messages: Formal notices, such as of resolutions or the passing of bills, usually done in writing, via the clerk and speaker of each house.
;Transmission: of bills or amendment to bills requiring agreement from the other house.
;Joint session: a plenary session of both houses at the same time and place.
;Joint committees:which may be formed by committees of each house agreeing to join, or by joint resolution of each house. The United States Congress has conference committees to resolve discrepancies between House and Senate versions of a bill, similar to &quot;Conferences&quot; in Westminster parliaments.
;Conferences:Conferences of the Houses of the English (later British) Parliament met in the Painted Chamber of the Palace of Westminster. Historically there were two distinct types: &quot;ordinary&quot; and &quot;free&quot;. The British Parliament last held an ordinary conference in 1860—its elaborate procedure yielding to the simpler sending of messages. A free conference resolves a dispute through &quot;managers&quot; meeting less formally in private. The last free conference at Westminster was in 1836 on an amendment to the Municipal Corporations Act 1835; the previous one had been in 1740—with not much more success than ordinary conferences, the free type yielded to the greater transparency of messages. In the Parliament of Australia there have been two formal conferences, in 1930 and 1931, but many informal conferences. the &quot;Conference of Managers&quot; remains the usual procedure for dispute resolution in the Parliament of South Australia. In the Parliament of New South Wales in 2011, the Legislative Assembly requested a free conference with the Legislative Council over a bill on graffiti; after a year the Council refused, describing the mechanism as archaic and inappropriate. The two houses of the Parliament of Canada have also used conferences, but not since 1947 (although they retain the option).

==Examples of bicameralism at the national level==

===Federal===
Some countries, such as Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Canada, Germany, India, Malaysia, Mexico, Nepal, Nigeria, Pakistan, Russia, Switzerland, and the United States, link their bicameral systems to their federal political structure.

In the United States, Australia, Mexico, Brazil, and Nepal for example, each state or province is given the same number of seats in one of the houses of the legislature, despite variance between the populations of the states or provinces.

====Australia====
The bicameral Parliament of Australia consists of two Houses: the lower house is called the House of Representatives and the upper house is named the Senate. As of 31 August 2017, the lower house has 151 members, each elected from single-member constituencies, known as electoral divisions (commonly referred to as &quot;electorates&quot; or &quot;seats&quot;) using full-preference instant-runoff voting. This tends to lead to the chamber being dominated by two major groups, the Liberal/National Coalition and the Labor Party. The government of the day must achieve the confidence of this House to gain and hold power.

The upper house, the Senate, is also popularly elected, under the single transferable vote system of proportional representation. There are a total of 76 senators: 12 senators are elected from each of the 6 Australian states (regardless of population) and 2 from each of the 2 autonomous internal territories (the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory). This makes the total number 76, i.e. 6×12 + 2×2.

In many respects, Australia is a unique hybrid with influences from the United States Constitution, as well as from the traditions and conventions of the Westminster system and some indigenous features. Australia is exceptional in this sense because the government faces a fully elected upper house, the Senate, which must be willing to pass all its legislation. Although only the lower house, the House of Representatives, can hold a no-confidence vote against the government, in practice the support of the Senate is also necessary in order to govern. The Senate maintains the ability similar to that held by the British House of Lords, prior to the enactment of the Parliament Act 1911, to block supply against the government of the day. A government that is unable to obtain supply can be dismissed by the governor-general: however, this is generally considered a last resort and is a highly controversial decision to take, given the conflict between the traditional concept of confidence as derived from the lower house and the ability of the Senate to block supply (see 1975 Australian constitutional crisis). Many political scientists have held that the Australian system of government was consciously devised as a blend or hybrid of the Westminster and the United States systems of government, especially since the Australian Senate is a powerful upper house like the U.S. Senate; this notion is expressed in the nickname &quot;the Washminster mutation&quot;.

Unlike upper houses in most Westminster parliamentary systems, the Australian Senate is vested with significant power, including the capacity to block legislation initiated by the government in the House of Representatives. This block can however be overridden in a joint sitting after a double dissolution election, at which the House of Representatives has the dominant numbers.As a result of proportional representation, the chamber features a multitude of parties vying for power. The governing party in the lower house rarely has a majority in the Senate, and so generally needs to negotiate with other parties and independents to get legislation passed.

This variant of bicameralism has also been further explored by Tarunabh Khaitan, who coined the phrase &quot;Moderated Parliamentarism&quot; to describe a parliamentary system with several distinctive features: mixed bicameralism, moderated (but distinct) electoral systems for each chamber, weighted multipartisanship, asynchronous electoral schedules, and deadlock resolution through conference committees.

====Canada====
Canada&#x27;s elected lower house, the House of Commons, comprises Members of Parliament (MPs) from single-member &quot;ridings&quot; based mainly on population (updated every 10 years using Census data). The Commons is democratically elected every four years (constitutionally up to five years). In contrast, in Canada&#x27;s upper house, Senators are appointed to serve until age 75 by the Governor General on the advice of the Prime Minister through an Independent Advisory Board as of 2016.

The government (i.e. executive) is responsible to and must maintain the confidence of the elected House of Commons. Although the two chambers formally have many of the same powers, this accountability clearly makes the Commons dominant—determining which party is in power, approving its proposed budget, and (largely) the laws enacted. The Senate primarily acts as a chamber of revision: it rarely rejects bills passed by the Commons but does regularly amend them; such amendments respect each bill&#x27;s purpose, so they are usually acceptable to the Commons. The Senate&#x27;s power to investigate issues of concern to Canada can raise their profile (sometimes sharply) on voters&#x27; political agendas.

====Others====
In German, Indian, and Pakistani systems, the upper houses (the Bundesrat, the Rajya Sabha, and the Senate respectively) are even more closely linked with the federal system, being appointed or elected directly by the governments or legislatures of each German or Indian state, or Pakistani province. This was also the case in the United States before the Seventeenth Amendment was adopted. Because of this coupling to the executive branch, German legal doctrine does not treat the &quot;Bundesrat&quot; as the second chamber of a bicameral system formally. Rather, it sees the &quot;Bundesrat&quot; and the &quot;Bundestag&quot; as independent constitutional bodies. Only the directly elected &quot;Bundestag&quot; is considered the parliament. In the German &quot;Bundesrat&quot;, the various &quot;Länder&quot; have between three and six votes; thus, while the less populated states have a lower weight, they still have a stronger voting power than would be the case in a system based proportionately on population, as the most populous &quot;Land&quot; currently has about 27 times the population of the least populous. The Indian upper house does not have the states represented equally, but on the basis of their population.

There is also bicameralism in countries that are not federations, but have upper houses with representation on a territorial basis. For example, in South Africa, the National Council of Provinces (and before 1997, the Senate) has its members chosen by each province&#x27;s legislature.

In Spain, the Senate functions as a &quot;de facto&quot; territorially based upper house, and there has been some pressure from the Autonomous Communities to reform it into a strictly territorial chamber.

The European Union maintains a somewhat close to bicameral legislative system consisting of the European Parliament, which is elected in elections on the basis of universal suffrage, and the Council of the European Union, which consists of one representative for each government of member countries, who are competent for a relevant field of legislation. Though the European Union has a highly unusual character in terms of legislature, one could say that the closest point of equivalency lies within bicameral legislatures. The European Union is considered neither a country nor a state, but it enjoys the power to address national Governments in many areas.

===Aristocratic and post-aristocratic===
In a few countries, bicameralism involves the juxtaposition of democratic and aristocratic elements.

====House of Lords of the United Kingdom====
The best known example is the British House of Lords, which includes a number of hereditary peers. The House of Lords is a vestige of the aristocratic system that once predominated in British politics, while the other house, the House of Commons, is entirely elected. Over the years, some have proposed reforms to the House of Lords, some of which have been at least partly successful. The House of Lords Act 1999 limited the number of hereditary peers (as opposed to life peers, appointed by the Monarch on the advice of the Prime Minister) to 92, down from around 700. Of these 92, one is the Earl Marshal, a hereditary office always held by the Duke of Norfolk, one is the Lord Great Chamberlain, a hereditary office held by turns, currently by Baron Carrington, and the other 90 are elected by all sitting peers. Hereditary peers elected by the House to sit as representative peers sit for life; when a representative peer dies, there is a by-election to fill the vacancy. The power of the House of Lords to block legislation is curtailed by the Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949. Peers can introduce bills except Money Bills, and all legislation must be passed by both Houses of Parliament. If not passed within two sessions, the House of Commons can override the Lords&#x27; delay by invoking the &quot;Parliament Act&quot;. Certain legislation, however, must be approved by both Houses without being forced by the Commons under the &quot;Parliament Act&quot;. These include any bill that would extend the time length of a Parliament, private bills, bills sent to the House of Lords less than one month before the end of a session, and bills that originated in the House of Lords.

Life Peers are appointed either by recommendation of the Appointment Commission (the independent body that vets non-partisan peers, typically from academia, business or culture) or by Dissolution Honours, which take place at the end of every Parliamentary term when leaving MPs may be offered a seat to keep their institutional memory. It is traditional to offer a peerage to every outgoing Speaker of the House of Commons.

Further reform of the Lords has been proposed; however, no proposed reforms have been able to achieve public consensus or government support. Members of the House of Lords all have an aristocratic title, or are from the Clergy. 26 Archbishops and Bishops of the Church of England sit as Lords Spiritual (the Archbishop of Canterbury, Archbishop of York, the Bishop of London, the Bishop of Durham, the Bishop of Winchester and the next 21 longest-serving Bishops). It is usual that retiring Archbishops, and certain other Bishops, are appointed to the Crossbenches and given a life peerage.

Until 2009, 12 Lords of Appeal in Ordinary sat in the House as the highest court in the land; they subsequently became justices of the newly created Supreme Court of the United Kingdom. As of 16 February 2021, 803 people sit in the House of Lords, with 92 Hereditary Peers, 26 Lords Spiritual and 685 Life Peers. Membership is not fixed and decreases only on the death, retirement or resignation of a peer.

====Japan&#x27;s former House of Peers====
Another example of aristocratic bicameralism was the Japanese House of Peers, abolished after World War II and replaced with the present House of Councillors.

===Unitary states===
Many unitary states like Italy, France, the Netherlands, the Philippines, the Czech Republic, the Republic of Ireland and Romania have bicameral systems. In countries such as these, the upper house generally focuses on scrutinizing and possibly vetoing the decisions of the lower house.

====Italian Parliament====
On the other hand, in Italy the Parliament consists of two chambers that have the same role and power: the Senate (Senate of the Republic, commonly considered the &quot;upper house&quot;) and the Chamber of Deputies (considered the &quot;lower house&quot;). The main difference among the two chambers is the way the two chambers are composed: the deputies, in fact, are elected on a nationwide basis, whilst the members of the Senate are elected on a regional basis: this may lead to different majorities among the two chambers because, for example, a party may be the first nationally but second or third in some regions. Considering that in the Italian Republic the Government needs to win confidence votes in both the chambers, it may happen that a Government has a strong majority (usually) in the Chamber of Deputies and a weak one (or no majority at all) in the Senate. This has led sometimes to legislative deadlocks, and has caused instability in the Italian Government.

====Indirectly elected Upper Houses (France, Ireland, Netherlands)====
In some of these countries, the upper house is indirectly elected. Members of France&#x27;s Senate and Ireland&#x27;s Seanad Éireann are chosen by electoral colleges. In Ireland, it consists of members of the lower house, local councillors, the Taoiseach, and graduates of selected universities, while the Netherlands&#x27; Senate is chosen by members of provincial assemblies (who, in turn, are directly elected).

====Semi-bicameral (Hong Kong, Northern Ireland; earlier in Norway, the Netherlands)====
In Hong Kong, members of the unicameral Legislative Council returned from the democratically elected geographical constituencies and partially democratic functional constituencies are required to vote separately since 1998 on motions, bills or amendments to government bills not introduced by the government. The passage of these motions, bills or amendments to government motions or bills requires double majority in both groups simultaneously. (Before 2004, when elections to the Legislative Council from the Election Committee was abolished, members returned through the Election Committee vote with members returned from geographical constituencies.) The double majority requirement does not apply to motions, bills and amendments introduced by the government.

Another similar situation are cross-community votes in Northern Ireland when the &quot;petition of concern&quot; procedure is invoked.

Norway had a kind of semi-bicameral legislature with two chambers, or departments, within the same elected body, the Storting. These were called the Lagting and the Odelsting, and were abolished after the general election of 2009. According to Morten Søberg, there was a related system in the 1798 constitution of the Batavian Republic.

==Examples of bicameralism in subnational entities==
In some countries with federal systems, individual states (like those of the United States, Argentina, Australia and India) may also have bicameral legislatures. A few such states as Nebraska in the U.S., Queensland in Australia, Bavaria in Germany, and Tucumán and Córdoba in Argentina have later adopted unicameral systems. (Brazilian states and Canadian provinces all abolished upper houses).

===Argentina===
Only 8 out of 24 provinces still have bicameral legislatures, with a Senate and a Chamber of Deputies: Buenos Aires, Catamarca, Corrientes, Entre Ríos, Mendoza, Salta, San Luis (since 1987) and Santa Fe. Tucumán and Córdoba changed to unicameral systems in 1990 and 2001 respectively. Santiago del Estero changed to a bicameral legislature in 1884, but changed back to a unicameral system in 1903.

===Australia===
When the Australian states were founded as British colonies in the 19th century, they each had a bicameral Parliament. The lower house was traditionally elected based on the one-vote-one-value principle, with universal male suffrage, later expanded to women, whereas the upper house was either appointed on the advice of the government or elected, with a strong bias towards country voters and landowners. After Federation, these became the state Parliaments. In Queensland, the appointed upper house was abolished in 1922, while in New South Wales there were similar attempts at abolition, before the upper house was reformed in the 1970s to provide for direct election.

Beginning in the 1970s, Australian states (except Queensland, which is unicameral) began to reform their upper houses to introduce proportional representation in line with the Federal Senate. The first was the South Australian Legislative Council in 1973, which initially used a party list system (replaced with STV in 1982), followed by the Single Transferable Vote being introduced for the New South Wales Legislative Council in 1978, the Western Australian Legislative Council in 1987 and the Victorian Legislative Council in 2003.

Nowadays, the upper house both federally and in most states is elected using proportional representation while the lower house uses Instant-runoff voting in single member electorates. This is reversed in the state of Tasmania, where proportional representation is used for the lower house and single member electorates for the upper house.

===Bosnia and Herzegovina===
The Legislature of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, one of the two entities of Bosnia and Herzegovina, is a bicameral legislative body. The House of Representatives has 98 delegates, elected for four-year terms by proportional representation. The House of Peoples has 58 members, 17 delegates from among each of the constituent peoples of the Federation, and 7 delegates from among the other peoples. Republika Srpska, the other entity, has a unicameral parliament, known as the National Assembly, but there is also a Council of Peoples who is &quot;de facto&quot; the other legislative house.

===India===
Only 6 of the 36 states or Union Territories of India have bicameral legislatures, Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Telangana, and Uttar Pradesh, while the rest all have unicameral legislatures. The lower houses are called Legislative Assemblies, and their members are elected by universal adult suffrage from single-member constituencies in state elections, which are normally held every five years called Vidhana Sabha. In the six states with bicameral legislatures, the upper house is called the Legislative Council (&quot;Vidhan Parishad&quot;) or Vidhana Parishat, one-third of whose members are elected every two years. Members of the Legislative Council are elected in various ways:
* One-third are elected by the members of local bodies in the state such as municipalities, &quot;gram panchayats&quot;, block development councils and district councils.
* One-third are elected by the members of the state&#x27;s Legislative Assembly from amongst persons who are not members of the State Legislative Assembly.
* One-sixth are nominated by the governor of the state from amongst persons having knowledge or practical experience in fields such as literature, science, arts, the co-operative movement and social service.
* One-twelfth are elected from special constituencies by persons who are college graduates of three years&#x27; standing residing in those constituencies.
* One-twelfth are elected by persons engaged for at least three years in teaching in educational institutions within the state not lower than secondary schools, including colleges and universities.

From 1956 to 1958 the Andhra Pradesh Legislature was unicameral. In 1958, when the State Legislative Council was formed, it became bicameral until 1 June 1985 when it was abolished. This continued until March 2007 when the State Legislative Council was reestablished and elections were held for its seats. In Tamil Nadu, a resolution was passed on 14 May 1986 and the state&#x27;s Legislative Council was dissolved on 1 November 1986. Again on 12 April 2010, a resolution was passed to reestablish the council, but was ultimately unsuccessful. Similarly, the states of Assam, Jammu and Kashmir, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, and West Bengal have also dissolved the upper houses of their state legislatures.

===United States===
During the 1930s, the legislature of the State of Nebraska was reduced from bicameral to unicameral with the 43 members that once comprised that state&#x27;s Senate. One of the arguments used to sell the idea at the time to Nebraska voters was that by adopting a unicameral system, the perceived evils of the &quot;conference committee&quot; process would be eliminated.

A conference committee is appointed when the two chambers cannot agree on the same wording of a proposal, and consists of a small number of legislators from each chamber. This tends to place much power in the hands of only a small number of legislators. Whatever legislation, if any, the conference committee finalizes is presented in an unamendable &quot;take-it-or-leave-it&quot; manner by both chambers.

During his term as governor of the State of Minnesota, Jesse Ventura proposed converting the Minnesotan legislature to a single chamber with proportional representation, as a reform that he felt would solve many legislative difficulties and impinge upon legislative corruption. In his book on political issues, &quot;Do I Stand Alone?&quot;, Ventura argued that bicameral legislatures for provincial and local areas were excessive and unnecessary, and discussed unicameralism as a reform that could address many legislative and budgetary problems for states.

===Historical===
The German federal state of Bavaria had a bicameral legislature from 1946 to 1999, when the Senate was abolished by a referendum amending the state&#x27;s constitution. The other 15 states have used a unicameral system since their founding.

In the Soviet Union, regional and local Soviets were unicameral. After the adoption of the 1993 Russian Constitution, bicameralism was introduced in some regions. Bicameral regional legislatures are still technically allowed by federal law but this clause is dormant now. The last region to switch from bicameralism to unicameralism was Sverdlovsk Oblast in 2012.

Four Brazilian states (Bahia, Ceará, Pernambuco, and São Paulo) had bicameral legislatures that were abolished when Getúlio Vargas came to power after the Revolution of 1930.

==Reform==

===Arab political reform===
A 2005 report on democratic reform in the Arab world by the U.S. Council on Foreign Relations co-sponsored by former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright urged Arab states to adopt bicameralism, with upper chambers appointed on a &#x27;specialized basis&#x27;. The Council claimed that this would protect against the &#x27;Tyranny of the majority&#x27;, expressing concerns that without a system of checks and balances extremists would use the single chamber parliaments to restrict the rights of minority groups.

In 2002, Bahrain adopted a bicameral system with an elected lower chamber and an appointed upper house. This led to a boycott of parliamentary elections that year by the Al Wefaq party, who said that the government would use the upper house to veto their plans. Many secular critics of bicameralism were won around to its benefits in 2005, after many MPs in the lower house voted for the introduction of so-called morality police.

===Romania===
A referendum on introducing a unicameral Parliament instead of the current bicameral Parliament was held in Romania on 22 November 2009. The turnout rate was 50.95%, with 77.78% of &quot;Yes&quot; votes for a unicameral Parliament. This referendum had a consultative role, thus requiring a parliamentary initiative and another referendum to ratify the new proposed changes.

===Ivory Coast===
A referendum on a new constitution was held on 30 October 2016. The constitution draft would create a bicameral Parliament instead of the current unicameral. The Senate is expected to represent the interests of territorial collectivities and Ivoirians living abroad. Two thirds of the Senate is to be elected at the same time as the general election. The remaining one third is appointed by the president elect.

<text>The Roman road from Silchester to Bath connected Calleva Atrebatum (Silchester) with Aquae Sulis (Bath) via Spinae (Speen), Cunetio (near Marlborough) and Verlucio (near Sandy Lane). The road was a significant route for east–west travel and military logistics in south-east England during the 1st to 5th centuries.

Parts of its route were subsequently followed by earthworks that are presumed to form part of Wansdyke. During the Middle Ages, the road was used by drovers, as well as by merchants and travellers.

Margary numbered the road as 53. Portions of the Roman road are extant, while in other places all apparent vestiges are absent from view. In the early 19th century, Colt-Hoare surveyed and mapped its course from Overton Down (west of Marlborough) to Bath; the rest was only known in isolated sections until a study by Hugh Toller was published in 2013.

<doc id="204304" wikidata="Q140247" url="?curid=204304" title="Unicameralism">
<text>Unicameralism (from &quot;uni&quot;- &quot;one&quot; + Latin &quot;camera&quot; &quot;chamber&quot;) is a type of legislature consisting of one house or assembly that legislates and votes as one. Unicameralism has become an increasingly common type of legislature, making up nearly 60% of all national legislatures and an even greater share of subnational legislatures.

Sometimes, as in New Zealand and Denmark, unicameralism comes about through the abolition of one of two bicameral chambers, or, as in Sweden, through the merger of the two chambers into a single one, while in others a second chamber has never existed from the beginning.

==Rationale for unicameralism and criticism==
The principal advantage of a unicameral system is more efficient lawmaking, as the legislative process is simpler and there is no possibility of deadlock between two chambers. Proponents of unicameralism have also argued that it reduces costs, even if the number of legislators stays the same, since there are fewer institutions to maintain and support financially. More popular among modern-day democratic countries, unicameral, proportional legislatures are widely seen as both more democratic and effective.

Proponents of bicameral legislatures say that having two legislative chambers offers an additional restraint on the majority, though critics note that there are other ways to restrain majorities, such as through non-partisan courts and a robust constitution.

==List of unicameral legislatures==
Approximately half of the world&#x27;s sovereign states are currently unicameral. The People&#x27;s Republic of China is somewhat in-between, with a legislature and a formal advisory body. China has a Chinese People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference which meets alongside the National People&#x27;s Congress, in many respects an advisory &quot;upper house&quot;.

Many subnational entities have unicameral legislatures. These include the state of Nebraska and territories of Guam and the Virgin Islands in the United States, the Chinese special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macao, the Australian state of Queensland as well as the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory, a majority of the provinces of Argentina, all of the provinces and territories in Canada, all of the regions of Italy, all of the provinces of Nepal, all of the Spanish autonomous communities, both of the autonomous regions of Portugal, most of the states and union territories of India, and all of the states of Brazil and Germany. In the United Kingdom, the devolved Scottish Parliament, the Welsh Senedd, the Northern Ireland Assembly, and the London Assembly are also unicameral.

==Unicameralism in the Philippines==
Though the current Congress of the Philippines is bicameral, the country experienced unicameralism in 1898 and 1899 (during the First Philippine Republic), from 1935 to 1941 (the Commonwealth era) and from 1943 to 1944 (during the Japanese occupation). Under the 1973 Constitution, the legislative body was called Batasang Pambansa, which functioned also a unicameral legislature within a parliamentary system (1973–1981) and a semi-presidential system (1981–1986) form of government.

The ongoing process of amending or revising the current Constitution and form of government is popularly known as Charter Change. A shift to a unicameral parliament was included in the proposals of the constitutional commission created by President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo. Unlike in the United States, senators in the Senate of the Philippines are elected not per district and state but nationally; the Philippines is a unitary state. The Philippine government&#x27;s decision-making process, relative to the United States, is more rigid, highly centralised, much slower and susceptible to political gridlock. As a result, the trend for unicameralism as well as other political system reforms are more contentious in the Philippines.

While Congress is bicameral, all local legislatures are unicameral: the Bangsamoro Parliament, the Sangguniang Panlalawigan (Provincial Boards), Sangguniang Panlungsod (City Councils), Sangguniang Bayan (Municipal Councils), Sangguniang Barangay (Barangay Councils), and the Sangguniang Kabataan (Youth Councils).

==Unicameralism in the United States==
The Nebraska Legislature (also called the Unicameral) is the supreme legislative body of the state of Nebraska and the only unicameral state legislature in the United States. Its members are called &quot;senators&quot;, as it was originally the upper house of a bicameral legislature before the Nebraska House of Representatives dissolved in 1937. The legislature is also notable for being nonpartisan and officially recognizes no party affiliation, making Nebraska unique among US states. With 49 members, it is also the smallest legislature of any US state.

A 2018 study found that efforts to adopt unicameralism in Ohio and Missouri failed due to rural opposition. There was a fear in rural communities that unicameralism would diminish their influence in state government.

Local government legislatures of counties, cities, or other political subdivisions within states are usually unicameral and have limited lawmaking powers compared to their state and federal counterparts.

Some of the 13 colonies which became independent, such as Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New Hampshire had initially introduced strong unicameral legislature and (relatively) less powerful governors with no veto power. Pennsylvania&#x27;s constitution lasted only 14 years. In 1790, conservatives gained power in the state legislature, called a new constitutional convention, and rewrote the constitution. The new constitution substantially reduced universal male suffrage, gave the governor veto power and patronage appointment authority, and added an upper house with substantial wealth qualifications to the unicameral legislature. Thomas Paine called it a constitution unworthy of America.

In 1944, Missouri held a vote on changing the General Assembly to a unicameral one, which was narrowly rejected by the voters 52.42-47.58. Only the city of St. Louis and the St. Louis County voted in favor, whilst Jackson County (containing the bulk of Kansas City) narrowly voted against, and all other counties voted against the change to unicameralism.

In 1970, North Dakota voters voted to call a constitutional convention. In 1972, a change to a unicameral legislature was approved by 69.36-30.64, however, since the voters rejected the new constitution at the same referendum, it never took effect.

In 1999, Governor Jesse Ventura proposed converting the Minnesota Legislature into a single chamber. Although debated, the idea was never adopted.

The US territory of Puerto Rico held a non-binding referendum in 2005. Voters approved changing its Legislative Assembly to a unicameral body by 456,267 votes in favor (83.7%) versus 88,720 against (16.3%). If both the territory&#x27;s House of Representatives and Senate had approved by a vote the specific amendments to the Puerto Rico Constitution that are required for the change to a unicameral legislature, another referendum would have been held in the territory to approve such amendments. If those constitutional changes had been approved, Puerto Rico could have switched to a unicameral legislature as early as 2015.

On June 9, 2009, the Maine House of Representatives voted to form a unicameral legislature, but the measure did not pass the Senate.

Because of legislative gridlock in 2009, former Congressman Rick Lazio, a prospective candidate for governor, has proposed that New York adopt unicameralism.

The United States as a whole was subject to a unicameral Congress during the years 1781–1788, when the Articles of Confederation were in effect. The Confederate States of America, pursuant to its Provisional Constitution, in effect from February 8, 1861, to February 22, 1862, was governed by a unicameral Congress.

<text>Aquae Sulis (Latin for &quot;Waters of Sulis&quot;) was a small town in the Roman province of Britannia. Today it is the English city of Bath, Somerset. The Antonine Itinerary register of Roman roads lists the town as &quot;Aquis Sulis.&quot; Ptolemy records the town as &quot;Aquae calidae&quot; (warm waters) in his 2nd-century work &quot;Geographia&quot;, where it is listed as one of the cities of the Belgae.

==Development==

===Baths and temple complex===
The Romans probably began building a formal temple complex at Aquae Sulis in the AD 60s. The Romans had probably arrived in the area shortly after their arrival in Britain in AD 43 and there is evidence that their military road, the Fosse Way, crossed the river Avon at Bath. An early Roman military presence has been found just to the North-East of the bath complex in the Walcot area of modern Bath. Not far from the crossing point of their road, they would have been attracted by the large natural hot spring which had been a shrine of the Celtic Brythons, dedicated to their goddess Sulis. This spring is a natural mineral spring found in the valley of the Avon River in Southwest England, it is the only spring in Britain officially designated as hot. The name is Latin for &quot;the waters of Sulis.&quot; The Romans identified the goddess with their goddess Minerva and encouraged her worship. The similarities between Minerva and Sulis helped the Celts adapt to Roman culture. The spring was built up into a major Roman Baths complex associated with an adjoining temple. About 130 messages to Sulis scratched onto lead curse tablets (&quot;defixiones&quot;) have been recovered from the Sacred Spring by archaeologists. Most of them were written in Latin, although one discovered was in Brythonic; they usually laid curses upon those whom the writer felt had done them wrong. This collection is the most important found in Britain.

The Brythonic curse recovered on a metal pendant is the only sentence in the language that has been discovered. It reads:
&quot;Adixoui Deuina Deieda Andagin Uindiorix cuamenai&quot; or maybe &quot;Adixoui Deiana Deieda Andagin Uindiorix cuamiun ai&quot;

&quot;The affixed – Deuina, Deieda, Andagin, (and) Uindiorix – I have bound&quot;

An alternative translation based on a translation of certain words as non-proper nouns is the following:
&quot;May I, Windiorix for/at Cuamena defeat (alt. &quot;summon to justice&quot;) the worthless woman, oh divine Deieda.&quot; (Alt. &quot;Divine Deiada, may I, Windiorix, bring to justice/defeat (in court) the woman at Cuamena&quot;.)

This is still an uncertain translation in that it takes into account the nominal cases of the nouns:

&quot;Windiorix&quot; (alt. &quot;Windorix&quot;) - nominative masculine (subject), lit. &quot;fair-headed&quot; (&quot;windo&quot;) &quot;king&quot; (&quot;rix&quot;); &quot;Dewina Deieda&quot; - nominative/vocative feminine &quot;divine Deieda&quot; (&quot;deiada&quot; &quot;goddess&quot;); &quot;Andagin&quot; - accusative feminine &quot;woman&quot;; &quot;Cuamenai&quot; - locative/dative feminine of &quot;Cuamena&quot;

Gaius Julius Solinus remarks &quot;The circumference of Britain is 4875 miles. In this space are many great rivers, and hot springs refined with opulent splendour for the use of mortal men. Minerva is the patroness of these springs. In her shrine, the perpetual fires never whiten into ashes. When they dwindle away, they change into stony globules.&quot;

===Walled town===
It was the religious settlement, rather than the road junction further north and the residential area now known as Walcot, which was given defensive stone walls, probably in the 3rd century. The area within - of approximately - was largely open ground, but soon began to be filled in. There is some dispute as to whether these new buildings were private dwellings or were associated with servicing the pilgrims to the temple. There was also a ribbon development along the northern road outside the walls and cemeteries beyond.

===Decline===
From the later 3rd century on, the Western Roman Empire and its urban life declined. However, while the great suite of baths fell into disrepair, some use of the hot springs continued. After the end of Roman rule in Britain around AD 410, some residents seem to have remained, but violence seems to have taken root. Archaeological evidence of chaos and piratical raids on the few citizens who remained resident in the 440s include the finding of a young girl&#x27;s severed head in an oven in Abbeygate Street during excavations in 1984/85.

As far back as Geoffrey of Monmouth, the Arthurian Battle of Mons Badonicus (c. 500) has been suggested to have taken place near Aquae Sulis. Tim and Annette Burkitt have proposed &quot;Caer Badden&quot; (), some 20 miles northeast of the Roman mines at Charterhouse, on the basis of the &quot;Welsh Annals&quot;, as well as archaeological and toponymic evidence.

==Medieval legend==
In medieval times, the Roman temple at Bath was incorporated into British legend. The thermal springs at Bath were said to have been dedicated to Minerva by the legendary King Bladud and the temple there endowed with an eternal flame.

An 8th century poem in Old English, &quot;The Ruin&quot;, describing the ruinous changes that had overtaken a Roman hot-water spring, is assumed to be a reference to Aquae Sulis. The poem was copied in the Exeter Book for transmission to future generations.

==Remains==

Rediscovered from the 18th century onward, the city&#x27;s Roman remains have become one of Bath&#x27;s main attractions. They may be viewed almost exclusively at the Roman Baths Museum, which houses:
*Artefacts recovered from the Baths and the Roman town. There is a fine collection of stone sculptures.
*Excavated remains of the main temple courtyard.
*The Roman Baths themselves, though some lie below 18th century stonework. Of particular note is the original Roman Great Bath still lead-lined and fed by the sacred spring through Roman lead pipes.
*A hoard of 30,000 silver coins, one of the largest discovered in Britain, was unearthed in an archaeological dig in 2012. The coins, believed to date from the 3rd century, were found not far away from the Roman baths.

<text>Xuanzang (; ; 6 April 6025 February 664), born Chen Hui or Chen Yi (), also known by his Sanskrit Dharma name Mokṣadeva, was a 7th-century Chinese Buddhist monk, scholar, traveller, and translator. He is known for the epoch-making contributions to Chinese Buddhism, the travelogue of his journey to India in 629–645, his efforts to bring at least 657 Indian texts to China, and his translations of some of these texts. He was only able to translate 75 distinct sections of a total of 1335 chapters, but his translations included some of the most important Mahayana scriptures.

Xuanzang was born on 6 April 602 in Chenliu, near present-day Luoyang, in Henan province of China. As a boy, he took to reading religious books, and studying the ideas therein with his father. Like his elder brother, he became a student of Buddhist studies at Jingtu monastery. Xuanzang was ordained as a &quot;śrāmaṇera&quot; (novice monk) at the age of thirteen. Due to the political and social unrest caused by the fall of the Sui dynasty, he went to Chengdu in Sichuan, where he was ordained as a &quot;bhikṣu&quot; (full monk) at the age of twenty.

He later travelled throughout China in search of sacred books of Buddhism. At length, he came to Chang&#x27;an, then under the peaceful rule of Emperor Taizong of Tang, where Xuanzang developed the desire to visit India. He knew about Faxian&#x27;s visit to India and, like him, was concerned about the incomplete and misinterpreted nature of the Buddhist texts that had reached China. He was also concerned about the competing Buddhist theories in variant Chinese translations. He sought original untranslated Sanskrit texts from India to help resolve some of these issues.

At age 27, he began his seventeen-year overland journey to India. He defied his nation&#x27;s ban on travel abroad, making his way through central Asian cities such as Khotan to India. He visited, among other places, the famed Nalanda University in modern day Bihar, India where he studied with the monk, Śīlabhadra. He departed from India with numerous Sanskrit texts on a caravan of twenty packhorses. His return was welcomed by Emperor Taizong in China, who encouraged him to write a travelogue.

This Chinese travelogue, titled the &quot;Records of the Western Regions&quot;, is a notable source about Xuanzang, and also for scholarship on 7th-century India and Central Asia. His travelogue is a mix of the implausible, the hearsay and a firsthand account. Selections from it are used, and disputed, as a &quot;terminus ante quem&quot; of 645 for events, names and texts he mentions. His text in turn provided the inspiration for the novel &quot;Journey to the West&quot; written by Wu Cheng&#x27;en during the Ming dynasty, around nine centuries after Xuanzang&#x27;s death.

==Names==

Less common romanizations of &quot;Xuanzang&quot; include Hyun Tsan, Hhuen Kwan, Hiuan Tsang, Hiouen Thsang, Hiuen Tsang, Hiuen Tsiang, Hsien-tsang, Hsyan-tsang, Hsuan Chwang, Huan Chwang, Hsuan Tsiang, Hwen Thsang, Hsüan Chwang, Hhüen Kwān, Xuan Cang, Xuan Zang, Shuen Shang, Yuan Chang, Yuan Chwang, and Yuen Chwang. Hsüan, Hüan, Huan and Chuang are also found. The sound written &quot;x&quot; in pinyin and &quot;hs&quot; in Wade–Giles, which represents the s- or sh-like [ɕ] in today&#x27;s Mandarin, was previously pronounced as the h-like [x] in early Mandarin, which accounts for the archaic transliterations with &quot;h&quot;.

Another form of his official style was &quot;Yuanzang&quot;, written 元奘. It is this form that accounts for such variants as Yuan Chang, Yuan Chwang, and Yuen Chwang.

Tang Monk (Tang Seng) is also transliterated /Thang Seng/.

Another of Xuanzang&#x27;s standard aliases is Sanzang Fashi (): being a Chinese translation for Sanskrit &quot;Dharma&quot; or Pali/Prakrit &quot;Dhamma&quot;, the implied meaning being &quot;Buddhism&quot;.

&quot;Sanzang&quot; is the Chinese term for the Buddhist canon, or Tripiṭaka (&quot;Three Baskets&quot;), and in some English-language fiction and English translations of &quot;Journey to the West&quot;, Xuanzang is addressed as &quot;Tripitaka.&quot;

== Early life ==

Xuanzang was born Chen Hui (or Chen Yi) on 6 April 602 CE in Chenhe Village, Goushi Town (), Luozhou (near present-day Luoyang, Henan). His family was noted for its erudition for generations, and Xuanzang was the youngest of four children. His ancestor was Chen Shi (104–186), a minister of the Eastern Han dynasty. His great-grandfather Chen Qin (陳欽) served as the prefect of Shangdang (上黨; present-day Changzhi, Shanxi) during the Eastern Wei; his grandfather Chen Kang (陳康) was a professor in the Taixue (Imperial Academy) during the Northern Qi. His father Chen Hui (陳惠) served as the magistrate of Jiangling County during the Sui dynasty. According to traditional biographies, Xuanzang displayed a superb intelligence and earnestness, studied with his father, and amazed him by his careful observance of filial piety after one such study about that topic.

His elder brother was already a monk in a Buddhist monastery. Inspired, at a young age, Xuanzang expressed interest in becoming a Buddhist monk like his brother. After the death of his father in 611, he lived with his older brother Chen Su (), later known as Zhangjie (), for five years at Jingtu Monastery () in Luoyang, supported by the Sui state. During this time he studied Mahayana as well as various early Buddhist schools.

In 618, the Sui Dynasty collapsed and Xuanzang and his brother fled to Chang&#x27;an, which had been proclaimed as the capital of the Tang dynasty, and thence southward to Chengdu, Sichuan. Here the two brothers spent two or three years in further study in the monastery of Kong Hui, including the &quot;Abhidharma-kośa Śāstra&quot;. The abbot Zheng Shanguo allowed Xuanzang to study these advanced subjects though he was young.

Taking the monastic name Xuanzang, he was fully ordained as a monk in 622, at the age of twenty. The myriad contradictions and discrepancies in the Chinese translations at that time prompted Xuanzang to decide to go to India and study in the cradle of Buddhism. He knew about Faxian&#x27;s visit to India and, like him, sought original untranslated Sanskrit texts from India to help resolve some of these issues.

== Pilgrimage ==
===Dates===
Xuanzang started his pilgrimage to India in either 627 or 629 CE, according to two East Asian versions. The 627 CE version is found in &quot;Guang hongming ji&quot; from Daoxun and is also in Japanese and Korean texts. The 629 CE is found in Chinese and western versions. This confusion, though merely of two years, is of significance to western history.

The date when Xuanzang&#x27;s pilgrimage started is not resolved in any of the texts that Xuanzang himself wrote. Further, he did not write his own biography or travelogue, rather he recited it to his fellow monks after his return from India. Three of his immediate collaborators wrote his biography, and thus leaving three versions and with variant details. All three of these versions begin his pilgrimage in 629 CE.

Yet, one version by Huili, states that Xuanzang met Yabghu Qaghan, someone who died in 628 CE according to Persian and Turkish records. If this detail in Xuanzang&#x27;s biography and Persian-Turkish records are true, then Xuanzang must have left before Qaghan&#x27;s death, or in 627 CE. In other words, some of the details in the surviving versions of Xuanzang biography were invented or a paleographic confusion introduced an error, or the Persian-Turkish records are unreliable. The Japanese version is based on 8th to 10th-century translations of texts that ultimately came from Xuanzang&#x27;s monastery, which unfortunately has added to the confusion. Most sources state that Xuanzang started his pilgrimage in 629 CE.

===Travel through Central Asia===
==== Kingdom of Agni ====
In 630 CE, he arrived in the kingdom of Agni (Yanqi, in a place called Turpan). Here he met the king, a Buddhist along with his uncle Jnanachandra and precept Mokshagupta, who tried to persuade him to quit his journey and teach them Buddhist knowledge. He declined and they equipped him further for his travels with letters of introduction and valuables to serve as funds. Xuanzang observed that the country of Agni had more than ten monasteries following the Sarvastivada school of Hinayana Buddhism, with two thousand monks who ate &quot;three kinds of pure meat&quot; with other foods, rather than vegetarian food only that would be consistent with Mahayana Buddhist teachings. Therefore, the Buddhists in this country had stagnated in their Buddhist teachings.

==== Kingdom of Kuchi ====
Moving further westward, Xuanzang met about two thousand Turkic robbers on horses. The robbers began fighting with each other on how to fairly divide the loot. After the loot had thus been lost, they dispersed. Xuanzang thereafter reached the country of Kuchi. This country of 1000 li by 600 li, had over one hundred monasteries with five thousand monks following the Sarvastivada school of Hinayana Buddhism, and studying its texts in &quot;original Indian language&quot;.

Xuanzang writes of a dragon race and a region where water dragons metamorphose into horses to mate and create dragon-horses, also into men and mating with women nearby, creating dragon-men who could run as fast as the dragon-horses. These were men who will have massacred an entire city, leaving the place deserted.&quot;.

==== Baluka and other kingdoms ====
Further west he passed Aksu before turning northwest to cross the Tian Shan and then Tokmak on its northwest. He met the great Khagan of the Göktürks. After a feast, Xuanzang continued west then southwest to Tashkent, capital of modern Uzbekistan. Xuanzang describes more monasteries, such as the Eastern Cakuri monastery and Ascarya monastery, with Buddha&#x27;s footprints and Buddha idols. According to Xuanzang&#x27;s accounts, mystical light emanated from Buddha&#x27;s footprints on &quot;fast days&quot;. In the country of Baluka, the Sarvastivada school of Hinayana Buddhism was in vogue. He crossed the countries of Samarkand, Mimohe, Kaputana, Kusanika, Bukhara, Betik, Horismika and Tukhara. These had cities near rivers or lakes, then vast regions with no inhabitants, little water or grass. He describes warring factions of Turk chieftains in control, with &quot;illness and pestilence&quot; rampant.

From here, he crossed a desert, icy valleys and the Pamir range (which link Tian Shan, Karakoram, Kunlun, Uparisyena and the Himalaya mountain ranges). Here, observed Xuanzang, the wind is cold and &quot;blows with a piercing vehemence&quot; (Li Rongxi translation). Ferocious dragons live here and trouble the travellers particularly those who wear &quot;reddish brown&quot; color clothes. Thereafter, he crossed past a salty sea, one narrow from north to south and long from east to west, he calls the Great Pure Lake. He describes supernatural monsters, fishes and dragons living in this lake. The Xuanzang travelogues then rush through the names of many countries, stating that more details are provided in the return part of his journey, as he crosses into country of Bactra (modern Balkh). He adds that the Hinayana Buddhist schools were followed in all these regions.

In the capital of the country of Bactra, states Xuanzang, is a monastery with a Buddha&#x27;s idol decorated with jewels and its halls studded with rare precious substances. The Buddhist monastery also has an image of Vaishravana deity as its guardian. The monastery and the capital attracts repeated raids from the Turk chieftains who seek to loot these precious jewels. This monastery has a large bathing pot that looks dazzlingly brilliant and has a Buddha&#x27;s tooth relic and Buddha&#x27;s broom made of &quot;kasa grass&quot;. Outside is a vihara built ages ago, and many stupas to honor the &quot;arhats&quot; (Buddhist saints).

==== Kingdom of Bamiyana ====
South of Bactra is the country of Kacik, then the Great Snow Mountains with valleys &quot;infested with gangs of brigands&quot; (Li Rongxi translation). Crossing this pass, thereafter is the country of Bamiyana (a part of modern Afghanistan). There, state his travelogue is a colossal statue of standing Buddha, carved from a rock in the mountains, some one hundred and forty feet tall and decorated with gems. This valley has Buddhist monasteries, and also a colossal copper statue of the Buddha, that is over a hundred foot tall. He was told that it was cast in separate parts and then joined up together. To the east of a monastery in the Bamiyana valley was a Reclining Buddha entering Parinirvana that was over one thousand foot long. The people and the king of this valley serve the Buddhist monks, records Xuanzang.

Heading east and crossing the Black range, Xuanzang describes the country of Kapishi, where the Mahayana tradition of Buddhism had come in vogue. It had over 100 monasteries with stupas. More than 6000 monks, mostly Mahayana, studied here. Along with these Buddhist monasteries, states his travelogue, there were over ten Deva temples (Hindu) with &quot;heretical believers who go about naked and smear dust over their bodies&quot;, translates Li Rongxi. Furthermore, in the same capital region, there is a Hinayana monastery with 300 monks at the northern foothills.

The citizens of this country, adds Xuanzang, fondly recall &quot;King Kanishka of Gandhara&quot; (2nd-century CE, Kushan empire). To its east are the &quot;City of Svetavat temple&quot; and the Aruna Mountain known for its frequent avalanches. His travelogue then describes several popular legends about a Naga king. He also describes miraculous events from a Buddhist stupa, such as raging flames bursting out of them leaving behind stream of pearls. The citizens here, states Xuanzang, worship pieces of Buddha&#x27;s remains that were brought here in more ancient times. He mentions four stupas built in this area by king Ashoka.

===Travel through India and South Asia===

To Xuanzang, he entered India as he crossed the Black range and entered the country of Lampa. His travelogue presents India in fascicles separate from those for Central Asia. He, however, does not call it India, but the phonetic equivalent of what previously has been variously interpreted as &quot;Tianzhu&quot; or &quot;Shengdu&quot; or &quot;Xiandou&quot;. More recent scholarship suggests the closest pronunciation of the 7th-century term in his travelogues would be &quot;Indu&quot;.

Xuanzang states that India is a vast country over ninety thousand li in circuit, with seventy kingdoms, sea on three sides and snow mountains to its north. It is a land that is rich and moist, cultivation productive, vegetation luxuriant. He adds that it has its own ancient customs, such as measuring its distance as &quot;yojana&quot;, equal to forty li, but varying between thirty and sixteen depending on the source. They divide day and night into kala, and substances into various divisions, all the way to a fineness that they call indivisible and emptiness. The country has three seasons: hot, cold, rainy according to some Buddhists; while others say it is four: three months each of spring, summer, monsoon, and autumn.

The kingdoms of India have numerous villages and cities. Their towns and cities have square walls, streets are winding and narrow, with shops lined along these roads. Wine is sold in shops on the side streets. Those whose profession is butchering, fishing, executioners, scavengers (people that kill living beings and deal with products derived from them) are not allowed to live inside the cities. The cities are built from bricks, while homes are either made mostly from bricks or from &quot;wattled bamboo or wood&quot;. Cottages are thatched with straw and grass.

The residents of India clean their floor and then smear it with a preparation of cow dung, followed by decorating it with flowers, unlike Chinese homes. Their children go to school at age seven, where they begin learning a number of treatises of the five knowledges – first grammar, second technical skills which he states includes arts, mechanics, yin-yang and the calendar, third medicine, fourth being logic, and fifth field of knowledge taught is inner knowledge along with theory of cause and effect.

After further similar introduction covering the diverse aspects of the Indian culture he observed, including fashion, hair styles, preference for being barefoot, ritual washing their hands after releasing bodily waste, cleaning teeth by chewing special tree twigs, taking baths before going to their temples, worshipping in their temples, their alphabet that contains forty seven letters, the diversity of languages spoken, how harmonious and elegant they sound when they speak their languages, Xuanzang presents the various kingdoms of India.

Xuanzang includes a section on the differences between the Hinayana and Mahayana Buddhist communities. There are eighteen sects in Buddhism, according to Xuanzang. They stand against each other, debate &quot;various viewpoints, as vehemently as crashing waves&quot;. Though they share the same goal, they study different subjects and use sharp words to argue. Each Buddhist sect has different set of rules and regulations for their monks. The monks who cannot expound a single text must do the routine monastic duties (cleaning monastery and such). Those who can expound one Buddhist text flawlessly is exempt from such duties. Those who can recite two texts, get better quality rooms. Monks who can expound three Buddhist texts get attendants to serve them, while the few monks who can expound all four are provided with lay servants. Expounders of five texts have elephants for travel, while six texts entitles them to security retinue.

==== Kingdom of Lampa, Nagarahara, and Gandhara ====
Xuanzang describes Lampaka (modern Laghman, near the source of Kabul river) as the territory of north India, one whose circuit is more than 1000 li and where all monasteries studied Mahayana Buddhism. They have tens of Deva temples (Hindu) which heretics (non-Buddhists) frequent. To its southeast is the country of (modern Nangarhar), with many Buddhist monasteries and five Deva temples. The number of monks here, however, are few.

The stupa are deserted and in a dilapidated condition. The local Buddhists believe that the Buddha taught here while flying in the air, because were he to walk here, it caused many earthquakes. Nagarahara has a 300 feet high stupa built by Ashoka, with marvellous sculptures. Xuanzang paid homage by circling it. Both Lampaka and Nagarahara countries were independent with their own kings, but they have become a vassal of the Buddhist Kingdom of Kapisa found near Bamiyana.

The monasteries in these kingdoms are splendid, with four corner towers and halls with three tiers. They have strange looking figures at the joints, rafters, eaves and roof beams. The Indians paint the walls, doors and windows with colors and pictures. People prefer to have home that look simple from outside, but is much decorated inside. They construct their homes such a way that they open towards the east.

Xuanzang also describes implausible events such as glowing rock footprints of Buddha, dragons, tales of Naga, a stupa in which is preserved the Buddha&#x27;s eyeball as &quot;large as a crabapple&quot; and that is &quot;brilliant and transparent&quot; throughout, a white stone Buddha idol that worked miracles and &quot;frequently emitted light&quot;. The travelogue states that Xuanzang went into a dark cave here where dangerous beings lived, recited &quot;Srimaladevi Simhanadasutra&quot;, and they became Buddhists. Thereafter they all burnt incense and worshipped the Buddha with flowers.

Some five hundred li (~200 kilometer in 7th-century) to the southeast is the country of Gandhara – which some historic Chinese texts phonetically transcribed as &quot;Qiantuowei&quot;. On its east, it is bordered by the Indus river, and its capital is Purusapura.

This is the land of ancient sages and authors of Indic &quot;sastras&quot;, and they include Narayanadeva, Asanga, Vasubandhu, Dharmatrata, Monaratha and Parshva. To the southeast of Purusapura city is a 400-foot-high stupa built by Emperor Kanishka, one with nearly 2000 feet in diameter and a 25 layer wheel on the top. There is a large monastery near it. Gandhara has numerous holy Buddhist sites, and Xuanzang visited and worshipped all of them. He calls the stupas and the Buddha images in this region as &quot;magnificent&quot; and made with &quot;perfect craftmanship&quot;.

==== Kingdom of Udayana, Kashmira ====
Heading north towards Kashmir, he arrived in the city of Pushkalavati, with many holy Buddhist sites. Xuanzang worshipped at these &quot;great stupas and big monasteries&quot;. Thereafter he reached the country of Udayana, through which flowed the Subhavastu river (now called Swat river). It had 1400 monasteries of five early Buddhist schools (of 18 sub-traditions) – Sarvastivada, Mahāsāṃghika, Kasyapiya, Mahisasaka and Dharmagupta. These schools became unpopular, as the later form of Mahayana prospered. According to Xuanzang, these monasteries of early Buddhist schools are desolate and attract few monks. He then reached the city of Hi-lo and Manglaur.

In all these places, he mentions how the Buddha lived here in one of his previous lives (Jataka legends) and illustrated compassion-strength through his actions. There is a Buddhist temple northeast of Manglaur with the Avalokitesvara Bodhusattva image, one is noted for &quot;its miraculous manifestations&quot;. Crossing another 1000 li, he reached Darada valley – the old capital of Udayana, with a 100 feet golden wood statue of Maitreya Boddhisattva. This statue, states his travelogue, was built by an artist who went three times into heaven to see how he looks and then carve the realistic image of him on earth.

Xuanzang arrived in Taxila, after crossing a river with &quot;poisonous dragons and evil animals&quot;. There, he visited a major Buddhist monastery of the Sautrantika school. From there, after covering some 2200 li, he passed through the country of Simhapura (Kalabagh), of Urasa (now Hazara), and then into Kashmira. He was received by the king, and numerous monks from the Jayendra monastery. Kashmira is land with a very cold climate and is often calm without any wind. The region has lakes, grows plenty of flowers and fruit, saffron and medicinal herbs. Kashmira has over 100 monasteries and more than 5000 monks. The residents revere four large stupas that were built in ancient times by Ashoka.

Emperor Kanishika too built many Buddhist monasteries here. He also had treatises with 960,000 words written on copper plates and had them stored in a newly built great stupa. The Kashmira region has numerous monks well versed with the Tripitaka, states Xuanzang. He stays in Kashmira for two years and studies the treatises with them.

Xuanzang describes many events where he is helped by both Buddhists and non-Buddhists. For example, he describes leaving the city of Sakala and Narasimha, then passing with his companions through the Great Palasha forest. They get robbed and are walked towards some dry pond to be killed. A monk and he slip away. They hurry towards a village. Near it, they meet a Brahmana who is tilling his land. They tell him that robbers attacked them and their companions. The Brahmin goes to the village and beats a drum and blows a conch. About 80 men gather, and together they proceed to rescue the companions of Xuanzang.

While other rescued companions of his wail about the loss of all their property, Xuanzang reminds them that they should all be happy to be alive and not worry about the loss of property. The villagers help his companions and him by hosting them before the resume their journey. Yet, elsewhere, Xuanzang also recites the implausible tale of meeting a Brahmana who was 700 years old and had two associates, each over 100 years old, who had mastered all of the Vedas and the Buddhist &quot;Madhyamika sastra&quot;. He calls them heretics (non-Buddhists). These heretics help him and his companions get new garments and food. He stayed with this implausibly old Brahmana for a month, and studied the &quot;Madhyamika sastra&quot; with him.

==== The memorial of Pāṇini ====
To the northeast of Varsha country, states Xuanzang, there is a lofty mountain with a bluish stone image of Bhimadevi. She is the wife of Mahesvara. It is a great site of pilgrimage, where Indians from very far come with prayers. At the foot of this mountain is another temple for Mahesvara where ceremonies are performed by naked heretics who smear ash on their body. About 30 li (about 12 kilometers in 7th-century) southeast from these temples is Salatura, which says Xuanzang was the birthplace of Rishi Pāṇini and the author of &quot;Sabda-vidya-sastra&quot;.

Inspired by Mahesvara, this Rishi set out to &quot;make inquiries into the way of learning&quot; (Li Rongxi translation). He thoroughly studied all written and spoken language, words in ancient and his times, then created a treatise of one thousand stanzas. The heretics (Hindus) transmit this text orally from teacher to pupil, and it is this that makes the Brahmanas of this city &quot;great scholars of high talent with knowledge of wide scope&quot;. They have an image of Pāṇini installed in reverence of him in this city of Salatura.

==== Kingdoms of Takka, Jalamdhara, Sthanesvara, Mathura, Matipura, Kapitha ====
The country of Takka is south of Kashmira, extending from the Indus river to its west and Vipasha river to its east. They produce abundant quantities of non-sticky rice and wheat, also gold, brass, iron and other metals. They do not believe in Buddhism, and pray in several hundred &quot;deva&quot; temples. This country has ten Buddhist monasteries left. There were many more before, states Xuanzang. These were destroyed few hundred years ago, during the rule of a king named Mahirakula (Mihirakula). The king did this in anger because when he asked the monasteries in his domain for a Buddhist teacher to teach him Buddhism, the Buddhists did not send to him any learned scholar. Mahirakula cruel deed against the Buddhists triggered the king of Magadha to go to war with him. Mahirakula is defeated, forgiven but returns to power by assassinating the king of Kashmira and Gandhara. Xuanzang recites the hearsay stories he heard about Mahirakula&#x27;s continued cruelty and destruction of 1600 stupas and monasteries. Xuanzang then describes the surviving monasteries in Sagala with hundreds of Buddhist monks, along with its three colossal stupas, each over 200 feet tall, two built by Ashoka.

Xuanzang visited the country of Chinabhukti next, which he states got its name because a region west of the Yellow river was a vassal state of Emperor Kanishka. From there, during Kanishka&#x27;s reign, peaches and pears plantations were imported into Chinabhukti, northern India. Further northeast, he visited a Buddhist monastery of the Sarvastivada school with 300 monks. He describes another colossal stupa that is over 200 feet tall built by Emperor Ashoka. Near this, states Xuanzang, are numerous small stupas and large Buddhist caves. Around this monastery in the Himalayan hills are &quot;hundreds and thousands of stupas, built so closely together than their shadows touch one another&quot; (Li Rongxi translation). From there, he visited Jalamdhara. It grows non-sticky rice and cereals, its forest are luxuriant, the region is lush with flowers and fruits. They have 50 monasteries with over 2000 monks studying Mahayana and Hinayana traditions of Buddhism. They also have &quot;deva&quot; temples where heretics smear their bodies with ashes (Shiva-Hinduism).

From Jalambhara, Xuanzang travelled northeast through jagged peaks, deep valleys and dangerous trails into the Himalayan country of Kuluta. It is surrounded by mountains, and has abundant fruits, flowers and trees. It has twenty monasteries and over a thousand Buddhist monks studying mostly Mahayana Buddhism. It has fifteen &quot;deva&quot; temples frequented by heretics (Hindus). This region has many caves where Buddhist arhats and Rishis (saints) live. He then headed south, into the country of Shatadru. Here, writes Xuanzang, people wear &quot;gorgeous, extravagant&quot; clothes, the climate is hot and citizens are honest and friendly by custom. It has ten monasteries, but ruined and with few monks. He visits the country of Pariyatra, where they have plenty of cattle and sheep, as well as a type of rice that they harvest in sixty days after planting. This region has eight ruined monasteries and ten &quot;deva&quot; temples. The monks study Hinayana Buddhism here.

Xuangzang next arrived in the country of Mathura, calling it a part of central India. This region is fertile, people love mangoes, they produce cloth and gold. The climate is hot, the people are genial and good by custom, they advocate learning and virtue, states Xuanzang. This country has over twenty monasteries with over two thousand monks studying Hinayana and Mahayana Buddhism. Many &quot;deva&quot; temples are also found in this country. He describes the ritual carrying and worship of the Buddha and Buddhist deities in this country with incense and flowers scattered in streets. He visits and praises the Govinda monastery in the Mathura country. Next he visits the country of Sthanesvara, which has wealthy but unkind citizens who show off their wealth. It has three Buddhist monasteries with over seven hundred monks, a lustrous and clean colossal stupa which witnesses &quot;many divine manifestations&quot;. It also has well over hundred &quot;deva&quot; temples and numerous heretics.

The country of Srughna has Ganges river to its east and Yamuna river in the middle of it. These people are like those in Sthanesvara country. They believe in heretical ideas (Hindu) and are honest by nature, states Xuanzang. They cherish learning, arts and crafts, and cultivate wisdom, blessedness. In this country are five Buddhist monasteries, over thousand monks mostly studying Hinayana, and over one hundred &quot;deva&quot; temples with numerous heretics. East of this region is the Ganges river with dark blue waters and strange creatures living in it, but these creatures do not harm people. The water of Ganges is sweet in taste, and the heretics believe it to contain the &quot;water of blessedness&quot;, and that bathing in it causes sins to be expiated.

After crossing Ganges, he entered into the country of Matipura. Here, according to Xuanzang, half of the population is Buddhist and the other believe in heterodox religions. The climate is cooler and more temperate, its people are honest and esteem learning. The king of this country worships at the &quot;deva&quot; temples. The Matipura country has ten monasteries and over eight hundred monks, mostly studying Hinayana. Over fifty &quot;deva&quot; temples are frequented by the heretics here. Xuanzang describes the &quot;sastras&quot; composed and under study at the major Buddhist monasteries of Matipura. This region has the city of Mayura, densely populated and with a great &quot;deva&quot; temple near the Ganges river. The heretics call it the &quot;Gate of the Ganges&quot;. People from all five parts of India – east, north, west, south, central – come here crossing long distances on pilgrimage and to bathe at these gates. This place has numerous rest and almshouses, where the &quot;isolated, solitary and needy people get free food and medical service&quot;. North of this place is the country of Brahmapura, densely populated with prosperous and rich people. Colder in climate, here people are rude and violent by custom. This region has five Buddhist monasteries and ten &quot;deva&quot; temples. Southeast of here, states Xuanzang, is the country of Ahicchattra with ten monasteries and a thousand monks belonging to the Sammitiya sect of Hinayana Buddhism. It has five &quot;deva&quot; temples where heretics smear their bodies with ashes. The country of Vilashana and Kapitha are south and southeast of Ahicchattra. Most people in Vilashana are non-Buddhists, and there are two monasteries here with three hundred Buddhist monks. In Kapitha, there are four monasteries teaching Hinayana Buddhism, and they have over a thousand monks. Along with these Buddhist institution, Kapitha has ten &quot;deva&quot; temples. Kapitha, states Xuanzang, has a &quot;beautifully constructed monastery with many lofty and spacious buildings adoerned with exquisite carvings&quot; (Li Rongxi translation). It has Buddha statue at the top, Indra statue at left of the entrance and Brahma statue to the right.

==== Kingdoms of Kanyakubja, Ayodhya, Prayaga, Kausambi, Visaka ====
The country of Kanyākubja, also called Kusumapura, has the Ganges River to its west, with flowery forests of brilliant colors, transparent waters and prosperous people. They are simple and honest by custom, states Xuanzang, with handsome and graceful features. They cherish arts and literature, speak lucidly. Half of the population is Buddhist, half heretics. The Buddhists study both Mahayana and Hinayana teachings. The heretics have over two hundred &quot;deva&quot; temples.

The current monarch is Harshavardhana, a Hindu of Bais Kshatriya lineage. Three of his ancestors were also monarchs, and they were all known to the Chinese monarchs as virtuous. Xuanzang then recites, at length, the story of prince Shiladitya and how he constructed both major monasteries and temples, feeding hundreds of Buddhist monks and hundreds of Hindu priests on festive days. He describes numerous monasteries in the southeast of its capital, along with large Buddhist temple made of stone and brocks, with a thirty feet tall Buddha statue. To the south of this is temple, states Xuanzang, is a Surya temple built from bluestone. Next to the Surya temple is a Mahesvara (Shiva) temple also made from bluestone. Both are profusely carved with sculptures. About 100 li to the southeast of Shiladitya&#x27;s capital, states Xuanzang, is the Navadevakula city on the eastern bank of Ganges river. It is surrounded by flowery wood, has three monasteries with five hundred monks, and a multi-tiered terraced &quot;deva&quot; temple that is &quot;exquisitely constructed&quot; (Li Rongxi translation).

About 600 li to the southeast is the country of Ayodhya. It grows abundant amounts of cereals, is blessed with fruits and flowers. People are benign and dedicate themselves to arts and crafts. Ayodhya has over a hundred monasteries and three thousand monks studying Hinayana and Mahayana Buddhism. Its capital has ten &quot;deva&quot; temples. This is the country where some of the key shastras of the Sautrantika school of Buddhism were composed. A few hundred li east of Ayodhya is the country of Ayamukha. Here too, states Xuanzang, people are honest and simple. They have five monasteries with over one thousand monks, mostly studying Hinayana. Near them are ten &quot;deva&quot; temples.

About 700 li southeast is the country of Prayaga, on the banks of Yamuna river. It has luxuriant fruit trees and cereal crops, its people are kind and helpful. Most of them believe in heretical religions, and Prayaga has several hundreds of &quot;deva&quot; temples. At the south of this great city here is a forest full of champaka flowers with a 100 foot ancient stupa with collapsed foundation, originally built by Ashoka. The city has a great temple with decorated buildings. At the east of this great city two rivers meet forming a dune that is over ten li wide, and it is this place that wealthy people and kings such as Shiladitya come on pilgrimage from ancient times and give alms. It is called the Grand Place of Almsgiving. Numerous people gather here and bathe at the confluence of two rivers, some drown themselves, believing that this washes away their sins and that it will give them a better rebirth.

Five hundred li from Prayaga is the country of Kausambi. It produces abundant quantities of non-sticky rice and sugarcane. The citizens are bold, furious and dedicated to good deeds by custom. It has ten deserted and dilapidated Buddhist monasteries, attended by about three hundred monks. The country has fifty &quot;deva&quot; temples and numerous non-Buddhists. In the capital, within the palace is a Buddhist temple with a Buddha statue made from sandalwood. This Buddha image &quot;emits divine light&quot; sometimes, states Xuanzang. He adds that Kausambi is the place that Buddhists text predict is where the Buddha Dharma will come to an end in a distant future, therefore anyone who comes to this place feels sad and &quot;sheds tears&quot; (Li Rongxi translation).

He headed northeast, crossed Ganges river again, and this came to the country of Vishaka. He calls its people sincere and honest by custom, fond of learning. It has twenty monasteries and three thousand monks studying Hinayana Buddhism. Vishaka has numerous non-Buddhists and over fifty &quot;deva&quot; temples.

==== Kingdoms of Sravasti Kushinagara, Baranasi, Nepala ====
In Fascicle 6 of the travelogue manuscript, Xuanzang focuses on some of the holiest sites in Buddhism. He begins with Shravasti (present-day northeastern Uttar Pradesh), describing it to be a country of over six thousand li in circuit. The capital city is desolate, states Xuanzang, though some residents still live here. There are over hundred monasteries in its capital city, many dilapidated, where monks study Hinayana Buddhism. The country has hundred &quot;deva&quot; temples. He saw the decaying remains of Prasenajit&#x27;s palace, then to its east the Great Dhamma Hall stupa, another stupa and a temple for the maternal aunt of the Buddha. Next to these, states Xuanzang, is the great stupa of Angulimala. About five li (~2 kilometers in 7th century) south of the city is the Jetavana garden with two 70 feet high pillars standing, but the monastery there is in ruins. One pillar has a wheel carved at its top, the other a bull. Xuanzang saw all the monuments associated with the Shravasti legends with the Buddha, though many of these were in dilapidated condition. He also saw a Buddhist temple 60 feet high with a seated Buddha image, and a &quot;deva&quot; temple about the same size as the Buddha temple, both in good condition. Over sixty li to the northwest of Shravasti capital, he saw a series of stupas built by Ashoka for Kashyapa Buddha, one who lived for &quot;twenty thousand&quot; years, states Xuanzang.

From Shravasti, Xuanzang travelled southeast to the country of Kapilavastu. This country has no ruler, he states, and every city has its own lord. Well over a thousand monasteries were in this region, but most are dilapidated. Some three thousand monks continue to study Hinayana Buddhism in many of these monasteries. This country has two &quot;deva&quot; temples. He also describes a Buddhist temple with painting of a prince riding on a white horse, as well many Buddhist monuments and legends about the Buddha&#x27;s early life in this region, as well as those of the Shakya clan.

After Kapilavastu, he went eastward to the country of Ramagrama (Rama). The region is sparsely populated, the towns and villages in a dilapidated condition. He mentions a stupa where a snake-dragon comes out of the pond to circumambulate it, as well as elephants pick flowers and come to scatter on this stupa, according to Xuanzang. There is a monastery near this special stupa, where monks study Hinayana. Some hundred li to the east is another colossal stupa in good condition, one built by Ashoka. Past this forest is the country of Kushinagara, where towns and villages are deserted and in a dilapidated condition. He describes a large brick temple with reclining Buddha. He describes many monuments and sites he was able to see where numerous legends of the Buddha played out, including the site where he was cremated.

In Fascicle 7, Xuanzang describes five countries. He starts with Baranasi, stating the country has Ganges river to its west. The city is densely populated, with tightly packed homes in its lanes. The people are &quot;enormously wealthy&quot;, mild and courteous by nature. Few here believe in Buddhism, most are heretics (Hindus). The country has over thirty Buddhist monasteries with three thousand monks studying Hinayana. There are over one hundred &quot;deva&quot; temples, most dedicated to Mahesvara (Shiva). Some of these heretic followers go naked and smear their bodies with ash. On the west bank of Varana river near Baranasi, is a great stupa that is 100 feet tall and was built by Ashoka. Before it is a standing green-stone pillar polished as smooth as a mirror, states Xuanzang. He describes many more stupas, pillars and monasteries in Baranasi country.

After Baranasi, he visits the country of Garjanapati, where he finds the Aviddhakarna monastery that is &quot;very exquisitely&quot; carved with decorative sculptures. It is lush with flowers, with reflections in the pond nearby. From there he heads north of Ganges and visits a large Narayana temple. It has storied pavilions and terraces, the numerous &quot;deva&quot; statues are &quot;carved from stone with the most exquisite craftsmanship&quot;. About thirty li to the east of this Narayana temple is an Ashoka built stupa, with a twenty feet high pillar and lion image on its top. From there he walked to Vaishali, where says Xuanzang, people are honest and simple by custom. They study both orthodox Buddhist and heterodox non-Buddhist doctrines. The country of Vaishali has hundreds of monasteries, but only a few have monks and are in good condition. He describes the Svetapura monastery with lofty buildings and magnificent pavilions.

After Vaishali, he headed north and reached the country of Vriji. This country mostly venerates the non-Buddhist &quot;deva&quot; temples and doctrines, states Xuanzang. It has over ten monasteries with less than a thousand Buddhist monks. He then travelled to the country of Nepala, near the Snow Mountains. It has many flowers and fruits, yaks and two-headed birds. The people here, says Xuanzang, are rude and disparaging by nature, but skilled in craftsmanship. Their Buddhist monasteries and &quot;deva&quot; temples touch each other, and people simultaneously believe in Buddhist and non-Buddhist doctrines. The country has two thousand monks who study Hinayana and Mahayana teachings.

==== Kingdoms of Magadha, Iranaparvata, Champa, Kajangala, Kamarupa ====
In Fascicle 8 of the travelogue, Xuanzang begins with the country of Magadha. The country and its capital is sparsely populated. A fertile land, it produces a fragrant form of rice with extraordinary lustre. It regularly floods during the monsoon season, and during these months one can use a boat to travel. People are honest and simple here, and they revere Buddhism. Magadha has fifty monasteries and over ten thousand monks. It also has tens of &quot;deva&quot; temples.

According to Xuanzang, there is city south of river Ganges in Magadha. It is very ancient. When human life was &quot;innumerable years&quot; long, it was called &quot;Kusumapura&quot;. One can see the very ancient foundations of Kusumapura. Later, when human life span reduced to &quot;several thousand years&quot;, its name was changed to Pataliputra. Towards the north of his royal city is a huge standing pillar of Emperor Ashoka. There once were many monasteries, &quot;deva&quot; temples and stupas here, but several hundred such Buddhist and non-Buddhist monuments are in dilapidated and ruined condition, states Xuanzang.

He then describes several legends associated with Ashoka, along with several stupas and monasteries he found in good condition. For example, he describes the Tiladhaka monastery about 300 li southeast of the Magadha capital. It has four courts, lofty terraces, multi-storied pavilions where thousands of monks continue to study Mahayana Buddhism. Within this monastery complex, states Xuanzang, there are three temples, the center one with a thirty foot tall Buddha idol, another has a statue of Tara Bodhisattva, the third has a statue of Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva.

He visits Gaya and the Bodhi tree. Near the tree, he states there is the Mahabodhi monastery with many buildings and courtyards. Inside these buildings are &quot;most wonderful, and exquisitely done decorative paintings&quot;, states Xuanzang. It is painted in gold, silver, pinkish blue, lustrous white and semitransparent pigments, with the Buddha&#x27;s ornaments in the panel embedded with gems and jewels.

After crossing the Maha river, visiting many stupas, monasteries, Rishi Vyasa&#x27;s hill, Vipula hill, Pippala Cave, Bamboo temple and other monuments, Xuanzang arrived in Rajagriha (present-day Rajgir) and Nalanda University. He stayed and studied at Nalanda.

At Nalanda, he was in the company of several thousand monks. Xuanzang studied logic, grammar, Sanskrit, and the Yogacara school of Buddhism during his time at Nalanda with Silabhadra. He describes Nalanda as a place with &quot;azure pool winds around the monasteries, adorned with the full-blown cups of the blue lotus; the dazzling red flowers of the lovely kanaka hang here and there, and outside groves of mango trees offer the inhabitants their dense and protective shade&quot; (translation of Rene Grousset).

According to Grousset, the founders of Mahayana idealism, Asanga and Vasubandhu trained Dignaga, who trained Dharmapala and whose student was Silabhadra. Thus Xuanzang had reached his teacher Silabhadra, who made available to Xuanzang and through him to the Sino-Japanese world the entire heritage of Buddhist Mahayana thought, and the &quot;Cheng Weishi Lun&quot;, Xuanzang&#x27;s great philosophical treatise, is none other than the &quot;Summa&quot; of this doctrine, &quot;the fruit of seven centuries of Indian Buddhist thought.&quot; In this scripture, Xuanzang appears to a certain extent as the continuator of both Asanga and Vasubandhu.

From Nalanda, Xuanzang travelled through several kingdoms, including Iranaparvata, Champa, from there to Pundravardhana and Sylhet (in present-day Bangladesh. There Xuanzang found 20 monasteries with over 3,000 monks studying both the Hinayana and the Mahayana. One of them was the Vāśibhã Monastery, where he found over 700 Mahayana monks from all over Eastern India. He visited Kamarupa (present-day Assam and northeastern India), Samatata, Tamralipti, Kalinga and other regions, which Xuanzang calls as &quot;domain of east India&quot;.

==== Kingdoms of Kalinga, Multan, Andhra, Chola, Dravida and Malakuta ====
Xuanzang turned southward and travelled towards Andhradesa to visit the viharas at the Amaravati Stupa and Nagarjunakonda. He stayed at Amaravati and studied the &quot;Abhidhammapitakam&quot; texts. He observed that there were many viharas at Amaravati and some of them were deserted. He later proceeded to Kanchi, the capital of the Pallavas and has visited the Vaikunta Perumal Temple and also said that Kanchi was a strong center of Buddhism. He continued travelling to Nasik, Ajanta, Malwa; from there he went to Mulasthana and Pravata before returning to Nalanda again.

==== Kingdoms of Konkanapura, Maharashtra, Malawa, Valabhi, Gurjara, Ujjayani, Sindhu, Langala, Avanda, Varnu ====
Xuanzang was welcomed to Kanyakubja at the request of the Emperor Harshavardhana, who was an ally of Kumar Bhaskaravarman of Kamarupa, to attend a great Buddhist Sangha there which was also attended by both the monarchs as well as several others from neighboring kingdoms, Buddhist monks, Hindus, and Jains. Emperor Harsha invited Xuanzang to Kumbha Mela in Prayag where he witnessed the Emperor&#x27;s generous distribution of gifts to the poor.

After visiting Prayag, he returned to the imperial capital of Kanyakubja where he was given a grand farewell by Emperor Harsha. Travelling through the Khyber Pass of the Uparisyena mountain range, Xuanzang passed through Kashgar, Khotan, and Dunhuang on his way back to China. He arrived in the capital, Chang&#x27;an, on the seventh day of the first month of 645, 16 years after he left Chinese territory, and a great procession celebrated his return.

;Other sites
===Return to China===
On his return to China in 645 CE, Xuanzang was greeted with much honor but he refused all high civil appointments offered by the still-reigning emperor, Emperor Taizong of Tang. Instead, he retired to a monastery and devoted his energy to translating Buddhist texts until his death. He died on 5 February 664 CE in Yuhua Palace (玉華宮, in present-day Tongchuan, Shaanxi). According to his biography, he returned with &quot;over six hundred Mahayana and Hinayana texts, seven statues of the Buddha and more than a hundred sarira relics.&quot; In celebration of Xuanzang&#x27;s extraordinary achievement in translating the Buddhist texts, Emperor Gaozong of Tang ordered renowned Tang calligrapher Chu Suiliang () and inscriber Wan Wenshao () to install two stele stones, collectively known as &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s Preface to the Sacred Teachings&quot; in Chinese (), at the Giant Wild Goose Pagoda.

==Chinese Buddhism (influence)==

During Xuanzang&#x27;s travels, he studied with many famous Buddhist masters, especially at the famous center of Buddhist learning at Nalanda. When he returned, he brought with him some 657 Sanskrit texts. With the emperor&#x27;s support, he set up a large translation bureau in Chang&#x27;an (present-day Xi&#x27;an), drawing students and collaborators from all over East Asia. He is credited with the translation of some 1,330 fascicles of scriptures into Chinese. His strongest personal interest in Buddhism was in the field of Yogācāra (瑜伽行派), or &quot;Consciousness-only&quot; (唯識), and he founded a school taking after that tradition in China. His 7th-century scholarship on Yogacara has a major influence on Chinese Buddhism, and then on East Asian Buddhism.

The force of his own study, translation, and commentary of the texts of these traditions initiated the development of the Faxiang school (法相宗) in East Asia. Some of Xuanzang&#x27;s students, such as Kuiji (窺基, 632–682) and Wŏnch&#x27;ŭk (613–696), become influential authors in their own right. Although the Faxiang school itself did not thrive for a long time, its theories regarding perception, consciousness, Karma, rebirth, etc. found their way into the doctrines of other more successful schools. Xuanzang&#x27;s closest and most eminent student was Kuiji (窺基) who became recognized as the first patriarch of the Faxiang school. Xuanzang&#x27;s logic, as described by Kuiji, was often misunderstood by scholars of Chinese Buddhism because they lacked the necessary background in Indian logic.

Xuanzang was known for his extensive but careful translations of Indian Buddhist texts to Chinese, which have enabled subsequent recoveries of lost Indian Buddhist texts from the translated Chinese copies. He is credited with writing or compiling the &quot;Cheng Weishi Lun&quot; as a commentary on these texts. His translation of the Heart Sutra became and remains an important milestone in all East Asian Buddhist sects.

===The Perfection of Wisdom Sutra===
Xuanzang returned to China with three copies of the &quot;Mahaprajnaparamita Sutra&quot;. Xuanzang, with a team of disciple translators, commenced translating the voluminous work in 660 CE, using all three versions to ensure the integrity of the source documentation. Xuanzang was being encouraged by a number of his disciple translators to render an abridged version. After a suite of dreams quickened his decision, Xuanzang determined to render an unabridged, complete volume, faithful to the original of 600 chapters.

== Original works ==

Though Xuanzang is mainly known for his translation work, he also wrote a few original works.

In 646, under the Emperor&#x27;s request, Xuanzang completed his book, &quot;Records of the Western Regions&quot;, which has become one of the primary sources for the study of medieval Central Asia and India. This book was first translated into French by the Sinologist Stanislas Julien in 1857.

Xuanzang also wrote a large treatise on Yogacara Buddhist philosophy, the &quot;Cheng Weishi Lun&quot;.

There is also another original text called &quot;Bashi guiju song&quot; 八識規矩頌 (&quot;Verses on the Structure of the Eight Consciousnesses&quot;).

There was also a biography of Xuanzang written by the monk Huili (慧立). Both books were first translated into English by Samuel Beal, in 1884 and 1911 respectively. An English translation with copious notes by Thomas Watters was edited by T.W. Rhys Davids and S.W. Bushell, and published posthumously in London in 1905.

==Legacy==

Xuanzang&#x27;s &quot;Records of the Western Regions&quot; is the longest and most detailed account of the countries of Central and South Asia that has been bestowed upon posterity by a Chinese Buddhist pilgrim. While his main purpose was to obtain Buddhist books and to receive instruction on Buddhism while in India, he ended up doing much more. He has preserved the records of the political and social aspects of the lands he visited.

His record of the places visited by him in Bengal — mainly Raktamrittika near Karnasuvarna, Pundranagara and its environs, Samatata, Tamralipti and Harikela— have been very helpful in the recording of the archaeological history of Bengal. His account has also shed welcome light on the history of 7th century Bengal, especially the Gauda kingdom under Shashanka, although at times he can be quite partisan.

Xuanzang obtained and translated 657 Sanskrit Buddhist works. He received the best education on Buddhism he could find throughout India. Much of this activity is detailed in the companion volume to Xiyu Ji, the Biography of Xuanzang written by Huili, entitled the Life of Xuanzang.

His version of the Heart Sutra is the basis for all Chinese commentaries on the sutra, and recitations throughout China, Korea, Vietnam, and Japan. His style was, by Chinese standards, cumbersome and overly literal, and marked by scholarly innovations in terminology; usually, where another version by the earlier translator Kumārajīva exists, Kumārajīva&#x27;s is more popular.

===In fiction===
Xuanzang&#x27;s journey along the Silk Road, and the legends that grew up around it, inspired the Ming novel &quot;Journey to the West&quot;, one of the great classics of Chinese literature. The fictional counterpart Tang Sanzang is the reincarnation of the Golden Cicada, a disciple of Gautama Buddha, and is protected on his journey by four powerful disciples. One of them, the monkey, was a popular favorite and profoundly influenced Chinese culture and contemporary Japanese manga and anime (including the popular &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; and &quot;Saiyuki&quot; series), and became well known in the West by Arthur Waley&#x27;s translation and later the cult TV series &quot;Monkey&quot;.

In the Yuan Dynasty, there was also a play by Wu Changling (吳昌齡) about Xuanzang obtaining scriptures.

The movie &quot;Xuanzang&quot; was released in 2016 as an official Chinese and Indian production. It was offered as candidate for Best Foreign Language Film at the 89th Academy Awards due to its camera work, but ultimately was not nominated.

===Relics===
A skull relic purported to be that of Xuanzang was held in the Temple of Great Compassion, Tianjin until 1956 when it was taken to Nalanda—allegedly by the Dalai Lama—and presented to India. The relic was in the Patna Museum for a long time but was moved to a newly built memorial hall in Nalanda in 2007. The Wenshu Monastery in Chengdu, Sichuan province also claims to have part of Xuanzang&#x27;s skull.

Part of Xuanzang&#x27;s remains were taken from Nanjing by soldiers of the Imperial Japanese Army in 1942, and are now enshrined at Yakushi-ji in Nara, Japan. In November 1965, the relics of Xuanzang were returned by the Japanese government to Taiwanese government and eventually enshrined in Xuanzang Temple, Taiwan.

<text>Central Thailand (Central Plain) (historically also known as Siam or [[Dvaravati]]) is one of the regions of Thailand, covering the broad alluvial plain of the Chao Phraya River. It is separated from northeast Thailand (Isan) by the Phetchabun mountain range. The Tenasserim Hills separate it from Myanmar to the west. In the north it is bounded by the Phi Pan Nam Range, one of the hilly systems of northern Thailand. The area was the heartland of the Ayutthaya Kingdom (at times referred to as Siam) and is still the dominant area of Thailand since it contains the world&#x27;s most primate city, Bangkok.

==Definition==
The grouping of Thai provinces into regions follow two major systems in which Thailand is divided into either four or six regions. In the six-region system, commonly used in geographical studies, central Thailand extends from Sukhothai and Phitsanulok Provinces in the north to the provinces bordering the Gulf of Thailand in the south, excluding the mountainous provinces bordering Myanmar to the west and the coastal provinces of the east. The four-region system includes provinces only as far north as Chai Nat, Sing Buri and Lopburi and extends west and east to the borders of Myanmar and Cambodia.&lt;br&gt;
The central region, as defined by Royal Forest Department in 2019, consists of 18 provinces (7 provinces of Greater Bangkok, 8 provinces of South Central Thailand and 3 provinces of Western Thailand). The total area of this central region is , while the total forest area is or 33.2 percent of this regional area.

==Administrative divisions==
There are several different systems of dividing modern Thailand into different regions, which gives slightly different boundaries for Central Thailand. In the geographic six-region system, the central region includes the following 22 provinces, divided into three groups:

*Greater Bangkok: Bangkok, Nakhon Pathom, Nonthaburi, Pathum Thani, Samut Prakan, Samut Sakhon, Samut Songkhram
*North Central Thailand region: Kamphaeng Phet, Nakhon Sawan, Phetchabun, Phichit, Phitsanulok, Sukhothai, Uthai Thani
*South Central Thailand region: Ang Thong, Ayutthaya, Chainat, Lopburi, Nakhon Nayok, Saraburi, Sing Buri; Suphanburi

The four-region system includes 26 provinces in its definition of Central Thailand. Especially for statistical purposes, they are divided into four groups:

*Greater Bangkok: Bangkok, Nakhon Pathom, Nonthaburi, Pathum Thani, Samut Prakan, Samut Sakhon
*Sub-Central Thailand region: Ang Thong, Ayutthaya, Chainat, Lopburi, Nakhon Nayok, Saraburi, Sing Buri
*Western Thailand region: Kanchanaburi, Phetchaburi, Prachuap Khiri Khan, Ratchaburi, Samut Songkhram, Suphanburi
*Eastern Thailand region: Chachoengsao, Chanthaburi, Chonburi, Prachinburi, Rayong, Sa Kaeo, Trat

The eastern region is sometimes listed as a separate region distinct from Central Thailand: sometimes only the four coastal provincesand sometimes the above list excluding Nakhon Nayok. None of those regions are political subdivisions; they are only geographical or statistical groupings.
==Economy==

For economic statistics of Central Thailand by National Statistical Office (NSO) the following six provinces are listed: 1.Ang Thong 2.Ayutthaya 3.Chai Nat 4.Lopburi 5.Saraburi 6.Sing Buri&lt;br&gt;
However Nakhon Nayok province is listed by eastern Thailand.&lt;br&gt; 
For FY 2018, Central Region had a combined economic output of 863.328 billion baht (US$27.85 billion), or 5.3 percent of Thailand&#x27;s GDP. Ayutthaya province had an economic output of 412.701 billion baht (US$13.3 billion). This amounts to GPP per capita of 454,953 baht (US$14,676), 40 percent more than Saraburi province, next in the ranking and three times more than for all subsequent provinces in the ranking.

<doc id="204323" wikidata="Q264135" url="?curid=204323" title="Van Halen (album)">
<text>Van Halen is the debut studio album by American rock band Van Halen, released on February 10, 1978, by Warner Bros. Records. Widely regarded as one of the greatest debut albums in rock music, the album was a major commercial success, peaking at number 19 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs &amp; Tape chart. It has sold more than 10 million copies in the United States, receiving a Diamond certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and making it one of the best-selling albums in the country.

&quot;Van Halen&quot; contains some of the band&#x27;s most well-known songs, including &quot;Runnin&#x27; with the Devil&quot;, &quot;Ain&#x27;t Talkin&#x27; &#x27;bout Love&quot;, &quot;Jamie&#x27;s Cryin&#x27;&quot;, their cover version of the Kinks&#x27; 1964 song &quot;You Really Got Me&quot;, and the instrumental &quot;Eruption&quot;; written and played by guitarist Eddie Van Halen, it is widely regarded as one of the greatest guitar solos of all time and helped popularize two-handed tapping. In 2020, the album was ranked number 292 in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s list of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;.

==Background==
Van Halen recorded demos of 10 songs in November 1976 during sessions at Village Recorders in West L.A. and New York’s Electric Lady studios, produced and financed by Gene Simmons of Kiss. However, the resulting three-track demo tape attracted little interest from record labels, and Kiss’s manager Bill Aucoin even declined to manage the band. Guitarist Eddie Van Halen was not convinced of the quality of the material because they could not make the recordings with their own equipment. Simmons left to tour with Kiss after recording the demos, but said he would try to secure Van Halen a record deal afterwards.

After recording the demos, the band was offered several concerts. At a sold-out show in their hometown, Pasadena, the group&#x27;s future manager, Marshall Berle, discovered the band. He and musical entrepreneur Kim Fowley paired them with punk rock band Venus and the Razorblades for a gig at the Whisky a Go Go. After being well received by Berle at the Whisky a Go Go, the band gained the attention of Mo Ostin and Ted Templeman of Warner Bros. who both attended the band&#x27;s performance at the Starwood on February 3, 1977. Van Halen proceeded to sign a contract with Warner. 

The recording of this debut album with producer Ted Templeman began August 29, 1977. The tracks were recorded quickly during sessions between August 31 and September 8, 1977. It was mostly recorded live, but &quot;Runnin&#x27; with the Devil&quot;, &quot;Jamie&#x27;s Cryin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;Feel Your Love Tonight&quot; and &quot;Ice Cream Man&quot; contain guitar overdubs. Eddie also overdubbed his solo for &quot;Ain&#x27;t Talkin&#x27; &#x27;bout Love&quot; with an electric sitar. Work on the album ended October 4 with the final mixing of &quot;Little Dreamer&quot; and &quot;Eruption&quot; (titled simply &quot;Guitar Solo&quot; on studio documents). Overall, the album cost approximately $54,000 to produce. 

&quot;We didn&#x27;t have a ton of material,&quot; recalled bassist Michael Anthony, &quot;so we basically just took our live show and all the songs we knew and went for it. The whole album only took a couple of weeks. Ted Templeman wanted to make a big, powerful guitar record, and he had all he needed in what Eddie was doing.&quot;

The subsequent tour began March 3, 1978 at the Aragon Ballroom in Chicago with the band opening for Journey and Ronnie Montrose in the United States. They later opened for heavy metal band Black Sabbath in Europe and the United States.

==Packaging and artwork==
The cover photos for &quot;Van Halen&quot; were taken at the Whisky a Go Go, a Los Angeles club at which Van Halen often performed during late 1976-1977. The guitar pictured on the cover is Eddie Van Halen&#x27;s signature Frankenstrat (before he added the red paint), a highly customized Stratocaster-style guitar built out of replacement parts.

The liner notes thank radio disc jockey Rodney Bingenheimer and Kiss bassist Gene Simmons, the latter usually credited with discovering Van Halen although Bingenheimer deserves credit for introducing Van Halen to Simmons. &quot;A lot of people stick me on their [thanks list], even though I don&#x27;t deserve it,&quot; Simmons remarked. &quot;One that I &quot;did&quot; deserve to be on was that first Van Halen record – the guys still owe me a couple thousand bucks! But I love &#x27;em.&quot;

In the United States, &quot;Van Halen&quot; reached number 19 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200; their debut single, a cover of The Kinks&#x27; &quot;You Really Got Me&quot;, spent eleven weeks, three of which in the Top 40, on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, peaking at number 36.

Soon after its February 1978 release, &quot;Van Halen&quot; became regarded by fans and critics as one of rock music’s greatest debut albums; however, its initial critical reception was mostly negative. In 1978, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; critic Charles M. Young predicted, &quot;In three years, Van Halen is going to be fat and self-indulgent and disgusting ... follow[ing] Deep Purple and Led Zeppelin right into the toilet. In the meantime, they are likely to be a big deal.&quot; But he also wrote that: &quot;Van Halen&#x27;s secret is not doing anything that&#x27;s original while having the hormones to do it better than all those bands who have become fat and self-indulgent and disgusting. Edward Van Halen has mastered the art of lead/rhythm guitar in the tradition of Jimmy Page and Joe Walsh; several riffs on this record beat anything Aerosmith has come up with in years. Vocalist Dave Lee Roth manages the rare hard-rock feat of infusing the largely forgettable lyrics with energy and not sounding like a castrato at the same time. Drummer Alex Van Halen and bassist Michael Anthony are competent and properly unobtrusive.&quot; &quot;Village Voice&quot; critic Robert Christgau said, &quot;For some reason Warners wants us to know that this is the biggest bar band in the San Fernando Valley ... The term becomes honorific when the music belongs in a bar. This music belongs on an aircraft carrier.&quot;

According to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s Holly George-Warren, with the album&#x27;s release the mainstream media focused on Roth&#x27;s &quot;swaggering good looks and extroverted persona&quot;, while fans and musicians &quot;were riveted by Eddie Van Halen&#x27;s guitar mastery&quot;, which included &quot;an array of unorthodox techniques.&quot; She notes that, even before the band&#x27;s debut, &quot;Eddie became a legend among local guitarists.&quot;

&quot;Kerrang!&quot; magazine gave the album a very positive review, and considers the album to be an &quot;essential purchase.&quot; They wrote, &quot;IT&#x27;S DIFFICULT to overstate the effect VH&#x27;s debut had upon its release. With the music world split between punk, disco and prog rock, Van Halen combined a dazzling live show with a party-hearty motto and, in Eddie Van Halen, a guitarist who redefined what was possible on six strings. His sound on this album—christened &#x27;The Brown Sound&#x27;—remains the holy grail of guitar tones.&quot;

&quot;Record World&quot; called the single &quot;Jamie&#x27;s Crying&quot; a &quot;driving rhythm piece, which may be [Van Halen&#x27;s] most interesting single to date.&quot; saying that &quot;its rock energy never lets up.&quot;

==Commercial performance==
On August 7, 1996, &quot;Van Halen&quot; was re-certified by the RIAA for selling ten million copies in the United States alone. One of only seven rock bands to release two RIAA Diamond status albums, &quot;Van Halen&quot; remains one of Van Halen&#x27;s two best-selling albums, along with &quot;1984&quot;.

&quot;Van Halen&quot; went to Gold status on May 24, 1978, and then went to Platinum status just a few months later, on October 10, 1978. In less than a year the album sold more than one million copies in the US alone, meaning that the album was already a great success. On October 22, 1984, the album went to 5× Multi-Platinum status. The album went to 6x Multi-Platinum on February 1, 1989, and then went to 7× Multi-Platinum on September 29, 1993. In less than a year later, on July 11, 1994, the album went to 8x Multi-Platinum, and finally, on August 7, 1996, just two years later, the album went to Diamond status by RIAA.

The &quot;Van Halen&quot; album, like Van Halen&#x27;s other David Lee Roth-era albums—excepting &quot;Van Halen II&quot;, which was re-certified in 2004, to coincide with the promotion of a Warner Bros. Records greatest hits collection—was last brought by Warner Bros. Records to the RIAA for re-certification in 1996, while &quot;1984&quot; was re-certified on February 8, 1999. The band&#x27;s split with Warner Brothers in 2002, and subsequent agreement with Interscope has eliminated Warner Brothers&#x27; incentive for paying the [relatively substantial] fee to promote Van Halen&#x27;s back-catalog by having its albums re-certified. Despite lack of re-certification, Van Halen&#x27;s 1978 debut has continued to sell prolifically, re-appearing numerous times on &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs &amp; Tape and Top Pop Catalog Albums charts, as recently as 2020.

== Legacy==
AllMusic&#x27;s Stephen Thomas Erlewine described &quot;Van Halen&quot; as &quot;monumental&quot; and &quot;seismic&quot;, while noting that it is typically not viewed as an &quot;epochal generation shift&quot; in the same way as the debut albums of Led Zeppelin, the Ramones, The Rolling Stones, and the Sex Pistols. He explains, &quot;The reason it&#x27;s never given the same due is that there&#x27;s no pretension, nothing self-conscious about it.&quot; He commented: &quot;The still-amazing thing about &quot;Van Halen&quot; is how it sounds like it has no fathers ... Like all great originals &quot;Van Halen&quot; doesn&#x27;t seem to belong to the past and it still sounds like little else, despite generations of copycats.&quot; In Erlewine&#x27;s opinion, the album &quot;set the template for how rock and roll sounded for the next decade or more.&quot; A retrospective review by &quot;Q&quot; noted, &quot;Hit singles came later, but this dazzling debut remains their trump card.&quot;

The album has been called the progenitor of glam metal.

In 1994, &quot;Van Halen&quot; was ranked number eight in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;Top 50 Heavy Metal Albums&quot;. Larkin described it as &quot;one of the truly great&quot; debut albums of heavy metal. According to authors Gary Graff and Daniel Durchholz, writing in &quot;MusicHound Rock: The Essential Album Guide&quot; (1999), &quot;Van Halen&quot; is a &quot;headbanger&#x27;s paradise&quot;; before its release, &quot;no one had heard or seen anything like it.&quot; In 2003, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, listed it among The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, at number 410; the list&#x27;s 2012 edition had it ranked 415th. The 2020 list placed it at 292. According to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s Joe Levy, the album &quot;gave the world a new guitar hero and charismatic frontman&quot; in Eddie Van Halen and David Lee Roth, respectively. Levy credits the tracks &quot;Runnin&#x27; with the Devil&quot; and &quot;Ain&#x27;t Talkin&#x27; &#x27;Bout Love&quot; with &quot;put[ting] the swagger back in hard rock&quot;, praising Eddie Van Halen&#x27;s &quot;jaw-dropping technique&quot;, which &quot;raised the bar for rock guitar.&quot; In 2006, &quot;Guitar World&quot; readers ranked it number 7 on a list of the Greatest Guitar Albums of All Time. In 2013, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; listed the album at number 27 of the 100 Best Debut Albums of All Time.

On April 15, 2013, David Lee Roth was interviewed by Jay Mohr for his podcast, where he selected the album as his favorite Van Halen recording.

<doc id="204326" wikidata="Q9213" url="?curid=204326" title="Lumbini">
<text>Lumbinī (Lumbini, , &quot;the lovely&quot;) is a Buddhist pilgrimage site in the Rupandehi District of Lumbini Province in Nepal. According to the sacred texts of the Buddhist Commentaries, Maya Devi gave birth to Siddhartha Gautama in Lumbini in BCE. Siddhartha Gautama achieved Enlightenment,
and became Shakyamuni Buddha who founded Buddhism. He later passed into parinirvana at the age of 80 years, in c.544 BCE. Lumbini is one of four most sacred pilgrimage sites pivotal in the life of the Buddha.

Lumbini has a number of old temples, including the Mayadevi Temple, and several new temples, funded by Buddhist organisations from various countries. Most of the temples have already been completed and some are still under construction. Many monuments, monasteries, stupas, a museum, and the Lumbini International Research Institute are also near to the holy site. The Puskarini, or Holy Pond, is where Mayadevi, the Buddha&#x27;s mother, is believed to have taken the ritual bath prior to his birth and where the Buddha also had his first bath. At other sites near Lumbini, earlier Buddhas were born, then achieved ultimate Enlightenment and finally relinquished their earthly forms.

Lumbini was made a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1997.

==In Buddha&#x27;s time==
In the time of the Buddha, Lumbini was situated east of Kapilavastu and south-west of Devadaha of Shakya, an oligarchic republic. According to the Buddhist tradition, it was there that the Buddha was born. Ashoka Pillar of Lumbini, a monolithic column with an inscription in the ancient Brahmi script discovered at Rupandehi in 1896, is believed to mark the spot of Ashoka&#x27;s visit to Lumbini. The site was not known as Lumbini before the pillar was discovered. The translation of inscription (by Paranavitana) reads:

The park was previously known as Rupandehi, north of Bhagavanpura. The Sutta Nipáta (vs. 683) states that the Buddha was born in a village of the Sákyans in the Lumbineyya Janapada. The Buddha stayed in Lumbinívana during his visit to Devadaha and there preached the Devadaha Sutta.

==Pillar of Ashoka==

In 1896, former Commander-In-Chief of the Nepalese Army General Khadga Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana and Alois Anton Führer discovered a great stone pillar at Rupandehi, according to the crucial historical records made by the ancient Chinese monk-pilgrim Xuanzang in the 7th century CE and by another ancient Chinese monk-pilgrim Faxian in the early 5th century CE. The Brahmi inscription on the pillar gives evidence that Ashoka, emperor of the Maurya Empire, visited the place in 3rd-century BCE and identified it as the birth-place of the Buddha.

At the top of the pillar, there is a second inscription by king Ripumalla (1234 Saka Era, 13-14th century CE), who is also known from an inscription at the Nigali Sagar pillar:

A second pillar of Ashoka is located about 22 kilometers to the northwest of Lumbini, the Nigali Sagar pillar (with inscription), and a third one 24 kilometers to the west, the Gotihawa pillar (without inscription).

== Lumbini complex ==

Lumbini is in length and in width. The holy site of Lumbini is bordered by a large monastic zone in which only monasteries can be built, no shops, hotels or restaurants. It is separated into an eastern and western monastic zone, the eastern having the Theravadin monasteries, the western having Mahayana and Vajrayana monasteries. There is a long water filled canal separating the western and eastern zones, with a series of brick arch bridges joining the two sides along the length. The canal is serviced by simple outboard motor boats at the north end which provides tours. The holy site of Lumbini has ruins of ancient monasteries, a sacred Bodhi tree, an ancient bathing pond, the Ashokan pillar and the Mayadevi Temple, a site traditionally considered to be the birthplace of the Buddha. From early morning to early evening, pilgrims from various countries perform chanting and meditation at the site.

Lumbini complex is divided into three areas: the Sacred Garden, the Monastic Zone and the Cultural Center and New Lumbini Village. The Sacred Garden remains the epicenter of the Lumbini area and consists of the birthplace of Buddha and other monuments of archaeological and spiritual importance such as the Mayadevi Temple, the Ashoka Pillar, the Marker Stone, the Nativity Sculpture, Puskarini Sacred Pond and other structural ruins of Buddhist stupas and viharas. The Monastic Zone, spanning an area of one square mile is divided into two zones: the East Monastic Zone which represents Theravada school of Buddhism and the West Monastic Zone which represents Mahayana and Vajrayana school of Buddhism, with their respective monasteries on the either side of a long pedestrian walkway and canal. Marking the monastic spot as a sacred pilgrimage site, many countries have established Buddhist stupas and monasteries in the monastic zone with their unique historical, cultural and spiritual designs. The Cultural Center and New Lumbini Village comprises Lumbini Museum, Lumbini International Research Institute, World Peace Pagoda of Japan, Lumbini Crane Sanctuary and other administrative offices. The Government of Bangladesh is currently constructing a major Buddhist monastery in Lumbini.

== Excavation at the Mayadevi Temple in 2013 ==
New excavations in the Mayadevi temple in Lumbini in 2013 revealed a series of the most ancient Buddhist shrines in South Asia extending the history of the site to a much earlier date. According to Robin Coningham, excavations beneath existing brick structures at the Mayadevi Temple at Lumbini provide evidence for an older timber structure beneath the walls of a brick Buddhist shrine built during the Ashokan era (3rd-century BCE). The layout of the Ashokan shrine closely follows that of the earlier timber structure, which suggests a continuity of worship at the site. The pre-Mauryan timber structure appears to be an ancient tree shrine. Radiocarbon dating of charcoal from the wooden postholes and optically stimulated luminescence dating of elements in the soil suggests human activity began at Lumbini around 1000 BCE. The site, states Coningham, may be a Buddhist monument from 6th-century BCE. Other scholars state that the excavations revealed nothing that is Buddhist, and they only confirm that the site predates the Buddha.

== Religious significance ==
Before parinirvana at the age of eighty, Gautama Buddha gave a sermon to his disciples on the significance of Lumbini as a place of pilgrimage (Dīghanikāya, 16; Mahāparinibbāṇa Sutta):
Along with Lumbini which is the Buddha&#x27;s place of birth; Bodh Gaya where he attained enlightenment, Sarnath where he gave his first sermon and Kushinagar where he attained parinirvana are four most significant pilgrimage sites in Buddhism. These four places form a pilgrimage circuit along Buddha&#x27;s Holy Sites.

==Other developments==
Nepal&#x27;s central bank has introduced a 100-rupee Nepali note featuring Lumbini, the birthplace of Buddha. The Nepal Rastra Bank said the new note would be accessible only during the Dashain, Nepal&#x27;s major festival in the time of September/October. It displays the portrait of Mayadevi, Gautam Buddha&#x27;s mother in silver metallic on the front. The note also has a black dot which would help the blind recognise the note. The name of the central bank in Roman script would be printed on the note along with the date of printing in both the Gregorian Era and the Bikram Era. The new note is being issued following a cabinet decision 27 August.

Nipponzan Myohoji decided to build a Peace Pagoda in the park in 2001, which is visited by many different cultures and religions every day. Because some Hindus regard the Buddha as an incarnation of Vishnu, thousands of Hindus have begun to come here on pilgrimage during the full moon of the Nepali month of Baisakh (April–May) to worship Queen Mayadevi as Rupa Devi, the mother goddess of Lumbini. Lumbini was granted World Heritage status by UNESCO in 1997.

In 2011, Lumbini Development National Director Committee wad formed under the leadership of Prime Minister Prachanda.The committee was given the authority to &quot;draft a master plan to develop Lumbini as a peaceful and tourism area and table the proposal&quot; and the responsibility to gather international support for the same.

In 2022 on Buddha&#x27;s Birthday, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Nepalese Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba, jointly laid the foundation stone for the Indian monastery in Lumbini. Nepal-India cultural events are held annually in Lumbini highlighting the close spiritual and cultural connection between the two countries. António Guterres, secretary-general of the United Nations made a visit to Lumbini in the October of 2023 and &quot;urged everyone to reflect on the core teachings of Buddhism and their relevance in today’s troubled world &quot;, highlighting conflicts around the world from Middle East to Ukraine to Africa, undermining of global rules and their devastating impacts on ordinary people, especially women and children.

==Tourism==
In 2019, Lumbini received 1.5 million visitors from across the world.

<doc id="204329" wikidata="Q385098" url="?curid=204329" title="Van Halen II">
<text>Van Halen II is the second studio album by American rock band Van Halen. Released by Warner Bros Records on March 23, 1979, it peaked at number six on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs &amp; Tape chart and yielded hit singles &quot;Dance the Night Away&quot; and &quot;Beautiful Girls.&quot; As of 2004, it had sold almost six million copies in the United States alone. Critical reaction to the album has been positive, with &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; praising the &quot;feel-good, party atmosphere&quot; of the songs.

==Background and recording==
Recording of the album took place at Sunset Studio less than a year after the release of the band&#x27;s 1978 debut album, &quot;Van Halen&quot;. Recording of the album began on December 10, 1978, just one week after completing their first world tour, and was complete within a week. The band used a Putnam 610 console to record the album, similar to the console Eddie would later install in his home studio in 1983. Many of the songs on &quot;Van Halen II&quot; are known to have existed prior to the release of the first album, and are present on the demos recorded in 1976 by Gene Simmons, and in 1977 by Ted Templeman, including an early version of &quot;Beautiful Girls&quot; (then known as &quot;Bring On the Girls&quot;) and &quot;Somebody Get Me a Doctor.&quot;

Compared to the group&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Van Halen II&quot; sees the group stretching out their sound and developing on directions only hinted before, and is often seen as lighter and poppier in tone; however, according to author Morgan Brown, it is evenly balanced between radio-friendly songs and &quot;more intense, aggressive material&quot;. Eddie said: &quot;I hate it when albums are happy-happy or heavy-heavy all the way through. We had a little bit of both on &quot;Van Halen II&quot;&quot;.

&quot;You&#x27;re No Good&quot; opens with solo bass guitar treated with a flanger, followed by Eddie gently swelling guitar chords by using a volume control to mute their initial attack, a technique later used on &quot;Cathedral&quot; (from &quot;Diver Down&quot;, 1982). The hit single &quot;Dance the Night Away&quot; sees the group fully embrace the bubblegum pop idiom, and features calypso rhythms in the intro and after the second chorus, whereas &quot;Outta Love Again&quot; is funkier than any of Van Halen&#x27;s earlier material, with percussive vocals from David Lee Roth and jazz-funk drumming from Alex van Halen. A more challenging track, &quot;Light Up the Sky&quot; features cerebral, progressive elements combined with an adrenalized energy, leading Brown to compare it to a hybrid between progressive rock band Rush and the aggression of hardcore punk.

The brief interlude &quot;Spanish Fly&quot; is a intricate solo performed on an acoustic nylon-string guitar, with chiming natural harmonics; it is followed by the loud &quot;D.O.A.&quot;, which begins with a dissonant intro. Later, &quot;Women in Love...&quot; features themes of female bisexuality and an evocative intro with an ethereal guitar part played almost wholly on tapped harmonics, emboldened by double tracking to the point it resembles an electric piano more than a guitar. During the song&#x27;s outro, Eddie plays both power chords on his lower guitar strings, and a drone on the open higher strings.

==Artwork and packaging==
The black-and-yellow guitar on the back of the album known as &quot;Bumblebee&quot; is buried with Pantera guitarist Dimebag Darrell, who was killed December 8, 2004. Eddie Van Halen placed it in his Kiss Kasket at his funeral because Darrell had said it was his favorite. Eddie himself stated in an interview conducted in December 1979 by Jas Obrecht and published in the April 1980 edition of Guitar Player Magazine, that the guitar itself was not actually used on the tracking of &quot;Van Halen II&quot;, as it had only been completed just in time for the photo shoots for the album.

However, the guitar was completed by Charvel, delivered to Eddie by Karl Sandoval in early October 1978 and was photographed in use on the 2nd European leg of Van Halen&#x27;s 1978 tour. Despite this, there is no conclusive evidence that the guitar itself was or was not used for the tracking of the album. It is likely that Eddie had, in fact, taken the guitar apart and reassembled it just in time for the photoshoot, as there is evidence of swapped parts and a new guitar strap made from a lap-style seatbelt seen in the photos from the shoot.

David Lee Roth is shown in a cast in the inner liner notes, as he allegedly broke his heel on the third try of the spread-eagle jump used on the back cover photo.

In the liner notes, The Sheraton Inn of Madison, Wisconsin, is thanked. On Van Halen&#x27;s first tour, they stayed at the hotel and destroyed the seventh floor, having fire extinguisher fights in the hallways and throwing televisions out windows. They blamed the incidents on their tour-mates at the time, Journey.

==Critical reception==

In a 1979 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; review, Timothy White writes, &quot;Scattered throughout Van Halen&#x27;s second album are various Vanilla Fudge bumps and grinds, an Aerosmith-derived pseudobravado, a bit of Bad Company basement funk and even a few Humble Pie miniraveups,&quot; adding that the &quot;LP retains a numbing live feel.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; deemed the album &quot;screaming macho rock howlings and power-driven electric guitar attacks.&quot;

In a retrospective review, Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic noted that the album is &quot;virtually a carbon copy of their 1978 debut,&quot; though goes on to say it is &quot;lighter and funnier&quot; and &quot;some of the grandest hard rock ever made.&quot; Erlewine praises Eddie&#x27;s &quot;phenomenal gift&quot; and Roth&#x27;s &quot;knowing shuck and jive.&quot;

==Commercial performance==
It reached No. 6 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs &amp; Tape chart and No. 23 on the UK Albums Chart. &quot;Van Halen II&quot; was certified 5× Platinum in 2004. About 5.7 million records have been sold in the United States as of 2004. In 2000, &quot;Van Halen II&quot; was remastered and re-released.

<doc id="204331" wikidata="Q170335" url="?curid=204331" title="Constance I of Sicily">
<text>Constance I (; 2 November 1154 – 27 November 1198) was the queen of Sicily from 1194 until her death and Holy Roman empress from 1191 to 1197 as the wife of Emperor Henry VI.

As queen regnant of Sicily, she reigned jointly with her spouse and later with her infant son, the future Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II. She is particularly notable for her actions against her own family, the Norman kings of Sicily; she played an important role in the end of the Hauteville presence in Sicily.

Despite being the sole heir to the throne of Sicily, she did not marry until she was 30 due to an ominous prophecy. Shortly after becoming empress, she was involved in the succession war against her illegitimate nephew King Tancred for the Sicilian throne, during which she was captured, though she was later released unharmed. In the history of Holy Roman Empire only two empresses were captured, with the other being her mother-in-law Empress Beatrice.

Shortly before ascending the Sicilian throne, at the age of 40, she gave birth to her only child, Frederick, thus continuing the bloodlines of both the Holy Roman Empire and the Kingdom of Sicily.

After the death of her husband, she gave up her son&#x27;s claim to the throne of the Holy Roman Empire in favor of her younger brother-in-law Philip of Swabia, making her son merely king of Sicily. She, however, continued to use her imperial title. She died one year later, having entrusted her young son to Pope Innocent III.

== Background and marriage ==
Constance was the posthumous daughter of Roger II by his third wife Beatrice of Rethel.

Constance, unusually for a princess, was not betrothed until she was thirty, which later gave rise to stories that she had become a nun and required papal dispensation to marry. Boccaccio related in his &quot;De mulieribus claris&quot; that a prediction that &quot;her marriage would destroy Sicily&quot; led to her confinement to remain celibate, and by the 15th century, the monastery of Santissimo Salvatore, Palermo, claimed Constance as a former member. Historian Mary Taylor Simeti has suggested that Constance, a potential heir to the throne and a valuable pawn in international diplomacy, would not be lightly ceded.

In the spring of 1168, during the reign in Messina of her elder nephew King William II, opposition to the Chancellor, Stephen du Perche, grew intense. A rumor spread that William had been murdered, and that the Chancellor planned to put his brother on the throne by marriage to Constance, even though William had a brother, Henry of Capua. Stephen was finally forced to flee.

Henry died in 1172, as King William II did not marry until 1177 and his marriage remained childless (or ever had a son named Bohemond in 1181), Constance became the sole heir to the Sicilian crown; nonetheless, while said to have been designated the heir and sworn fealty to in 1174, she remained confined to her convent with her marriage seemingly beyond consideration until she was 30 years old.

Her betrothal to Henry, King of the Romans, was announced 29 Oct 1184 at the Augsburg episcopal palace, an event that Pope Lucius III initiated rather than objected to. In 1185, Constance traveled to Milan to celebrate the wedding, accompanied by a grand procession of princes and barons. Henry accompanied her to Salerno in August but had to return to Germany for the funeral of his mother. On August 28 Constance was greeted in the province of Rieti by ambassadors from the Emperor. Henry and Constance were married on 27 January 1186 at Basilica of Sant&#x27;Ambrogio, Milan. In exchange for the marriage, Emperor Frederick I agreed to relinquish his claim to southern Italy. Before leaving Sicily, William II had three important nobles (his cousin Tancred, Count of Lecce, Roger of Andria, and vice chancellor Matthew of Ajello) swear fealty to her as the probable successor to the throne at the curia of Troia. Matthew strongly opposed this marriage. Abulafia (1988) points out that William did not foresee the union of German and Sicilian crowns as a serious eventuality; his purpose was to consolidate an alliance with an erstwhile enemy of Norman power in Italy. Another aim of William in marrying Constance off was to prevent Tancred from claiming the throne.

Constance interceded in the succession conflict of her maternal grand-uncle Count Henry of Namur with her husband and father-in-law: Henry had designated his maternal nephew Baldwin V, Count of Hainaut as his heir while childless, but he had a daughter Ermesinde in 1186 and thus sought to replace Baldwin with her. Under the instruction of Frederick I, Baldwin succeeded to Namur in 1189 while Henry was still living.

The papacy, also an enemy of the emperors, did not want to see the kingdom of southern Italy (then one of the richest in Europe) in German hands, but Henry pressed Pope Celestine III to baptize and crown his son; the Pope put him off.

== Claim to Sicily ==
Knowing that Sicily&#x27;s Norman aristocracy would not welcome a Hohenstaufen king, William made the nobles, and the important men of his court, promise to recognize Constance&#x27;s succession if he died without direct heirs. Nevertheless, after his unexpected death in 1189, Tancred seized the throne. Tancred was illegitimate but he had the support of most of the great men of the kingdom such as Vice-Chancellor Matthew of Ajello. On the other hand, Archbishop Walter of the Mill and most of the aristocracy supported Constance. Matthew was able to induce Walter and other barons to support Tancred.

Joan of England, widow of William, believed Constance to be the rightful successor and vocally supported the Germans; in response Tancred put Queen Joan under house arrest and confiscated her vast estates, which enraged her brother King Richard I of England, who later rescued her.

=== First expedition ===
While Constance&#x27;s father-in-law, Frederick Barbarossa, was on a crusade, Henry and Constance were forced to stay in Germany and could not press her claim to the Sicilian crown. Emperor Frederick died in 1190 and the following year Henry and Constance were crowned emperor and empress. Constance then accompanied her husband at the head of a substantial imperial army to forcefully take the Sicilian throne from Tancred with the support of the loyal Pisan fleet. The northern towns of the kingdom opened their gates to Henry, including the earliest Norman strongholds Capua and Aversa. Salerno, Roger II&#x27;s mainland capital, sent word ahead that Henry was welcome and invited Constance to stay in her father&#x27;s old palace to escape the summer heat, and take treatment from doctors for her infirm health. Though welcomed, Constance felt many citizens were still loyal to Tancred as they whispered in groups quietly.

At Naples, Henry met the first resistance of the whole campaign, and was held up well into the southern summer from May to August, by which time much of the army had succumbed to malaria and other diseases. Even Henry himself fell ill. Henry of Welf, who was also participating in the siege of Naples, deserted to Germany, falsely claimed that the emperor had died, and touted himself as a possible successor. Although Henry VI recovered, the imperial army was forced to withdraw from the kingdom altogether. Constance remained in Salerno with a small garrison as a sign that Henry would soon return.

==== Brief captivity ====

Once Henry had withdrawn with the bulk of the imperial army, the towns that had fallen to the Empire immediately declared their allegiance to Tancred, for the most part now fearing his retribution. Nicholas of Ajello, son of Matthew and former Archbishop of Salerno, who was helping defend Naples, wrote letters about the events to his friends in Salerno. Thus the populace of Salerno saw an opportunity to win some favour with Tancred, so they taunted and besieged the defenseless Constance at Castel Terracena. Constance presented herself on a balcony and spoke to them in the tone of mild remonstrance and admonition, trying to tell them that the situation might improve and the defeat of Henry might be exaggerated by Nicholas, but the Salernitans were determined to capture her for Tancred, so they continued the siege. Constance locked herself in her room, locked the windows, and prayed to God for help and revenge. After a rapid negotiation with Elia di Gesualdo, a distant relative of Tancred, Constance voluntarily went out under the condition that her German guards were allowed to leave unharmed. She was then arrested by Elia (and some barons of Apulia who were related to her) and delivered to Tancred in Messina by Admiral Margaritus of Brindisi (her brother-in-law who had helped in the defence of Naples), on a bireme galley or dromon with 200 rowers. She was in her attire as empress, wearing a dress quilted with gold and decorated with roses, a cloak covered with precious jewels, and her hair was strewn with gems, making her look like a goddess. Thus she became an important and valuable prize given that Henry had every intention of regaining. When meeting Constance, Tancred blamed her for the invasion, but she proudly responded that she was just taking back her dominion, stolen by Tancred. By September 20, Henry learned the abduction of his wife at Genoa.

Constance was taken to Palermo, supervised by Queen Sibylla; Tancred had her eat with Sibylla and sleep in Sibylla&#x27;s bedroom. Sibylla, who had once quarrelled with Constance, after seeing that the populace of Palermo was showing sympathy to Constance, suggested that Tancred put Constance to death. Tancred disagreed, worrying that this would harm his popularity. So at the suggestion of Tancred, Sibylla discussed with Matthew of Ajello (who had been promoted to chancellor) where to imprison Constance. Matthew wrote a letter to Tancred in her presence, suggesting he put Constance in the Castel dell&#x27;Ovo in Naples in the custody of nobleman Aligerno Cottone. There she would be better-guarded since the castle was surrounded by water, and also secluded from the Sicilian people. Tancred accepted their suggestion. In addition, Matthew wrote to Aligerno, ordering &quot;ut imperatricem in Castro Salvatoris ad mare bene custodiat&quot; (&quot;that he guard well the Empress in the Castle of the Savior by the sea&quot;, i.e., Castel dell&#x27;Ovo).

Although Tancred always treated her with courtesy during her captivity, Constance was under extremely careful guard. Sibylla strongly opposed the deference Tancred showed to Constance, believing this would implicitly acknowledge the claims of the latter.

During the election of a new bishop of Liege in September 1191, Henry favored Albert de Rethel, a maternal uncle of Constance, whom both he and Constance had planned to make the next bishop of Liege. However, as mentioned above, at the time of the election, Constance had been imprisoned by the Sicilians, and the other candidate, Albert of Louvain, gained more support. In January 1192 Henry claimed the election was under dispute and instead appointed his newly made imperial chancellor Lothar of Hochstaden, provost of the church of St Cassius in Bonn and brother of Count Dietrich of Hochstaden. In September 1192 he proceeded to Lüttich (Liège) to enforce the succession. The majority of the electors of Liège accepted the imperial decision because of the emperor&#x27;s threat, and Albert de Rethel also relinquished his claim and indignantly refused a financial settlement from the emperor.

Margaritus was created Count of Malta in 1192 perhaps for his unexpected success of capturing the empress, granting him considerable resources.

Henry VI consistently refused to make peace with Tancred despite the capture of his wife; in his letter to Pope Celestine III to request the kingship of Tancred declared illegitimate, he even did not mention her captivity. While he did not have the power to rescue her, Tancred would not permit Constance to be ransomed unless Henry recognized him. Henry complained to Celestine about the capture of his wife, so the Pope threatened to excommunicate Tancred if he did not release the Empress. (The Pope hoped that by securing Constance&#x27;s safe passage back to Rome Henry would be better disposed towards the papacy and Celestine would be able to keep the Empire and Sicily from uniting.) Finally, Tancred was willing to give up his negotiating advantage (i.e. possession of the Empress) if the Pope would legitimize him as King of Sicily.

Constance was released in 1192 with all her suites and some gifts, and delivered to Egidio Cardinal of Anagni from the Papal States. They traveled through the Strait of Messina, but before they made it to Rome they met imperial soldiers and the pro-Hohenstaufen abbot Roffredo of Montecassino, and Constance asked them for help; they were able to intercept the convoy at Ceprano despite the opposition of the cardinals and escorted her safely across the Alps, ensuring that in the end neither the papacy nor Sicily scored any real advantage in having had the Empress in their custody at all, only less than a month after her release; Within two weeks Henry and Constance reunited in the imperial castle of Trifels.

=== Second Expedition ===
Henry was already preparing to invade Sicily a second time when Tancred died in February 1194. Later that year he moved south, leveled Salerno to the ground in revenge for arresting Constance, entered Palermo unopposed, deposed Tancred&#x27;s young son William III (died 1198), and had himself crowned instead. Prior to that he agreed the request of Constance to enfeoff William with the County of Lecce and Principality of Taranto on November 20.

== Queen of Sicily ==
While Henry moved quickly south with his army, a pregnant Constance followed at a slower pace. On 26 December, the day after Henry was crowned at Palermo, she gave birth to a son, named Constantine after herself (later renamed Frederick-Roger, i. e. the future Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor and King of Sicily) in the small town of Iesi, near Ancona.

Later, Frederick&#x27;s opponents, using Constance&#x27;s age (she was 40 at the time of Frederick&#x27;s birth) as the basis, spread the rumours that he was the son of a butcher. This induced counter-legends, such as a story recorded by a 1282 Florentine chronicle (authored by , according to which, Constance gave birth publicly in the town square (of Palermo, erroneously attributed as Frederick&#x27;s birthplace by Malispini) to dispel doubt of her maternity. She had the baby in a pavilion tent in the market square of the town, and invited the town matrons to witness the birth. A few days later she returned to the town square and publicly breast-fed the infant.

When Henry returned to Germany in 1195, Constance ruled Sicily and issued diplomas in her own name. She was crowned as queen regnant on 2 April at Bari.

She was able to lead her own government, although certainly Henry&#x27;s policies and the personnel he left placed some restriction on her independence. Many notaries who had worked for William II and Tancred, such as Gosfridus de Fogia, now worked for Constance, who based her government in Palermo and was surrounded by local noble families. Her government stopped to function after Henry&#x27;s return, only to continue again after his death.

In 1196 Henry VI had Richard, Count of Acerra brother of Sibylla hanged in revenge for the capture of Constance.

On Good Friday in 1196, Constance summoned Joachim of Fiore to Palermo to hear her confession in the Palatine chapel. Initially she sat on a raised chair, but when Joachim told her that as they were at the places of Christ and Mary Magdalene, she needed to lower herself, she sat on the ground.

The establishment of Henry&#x27;s rule in Sicily came with great social upheavals, including revolts around Catania and southern Sicily. Henry wanted to placate Sicilians by naming Constance regent. A part of the society, especially the elites who lost power during the transition, rejected German power and ethnic character as possessing a barbarous nature that could not be reasoned with. This group viewed Constance merely as Henry&#x27;s tool, that could not stop him from making up Sicilian government dominated by German seneschal Markward von Anweiler and ensured by German troops. A work now known as &quot;A Letter Concerning the Sicilian Tragedy to Peter&quot; (which was written after William II&#x27;s death in 1189 and before Henry&#x27;s successful subjugation of Sicily) accused Constance, a Sicilian princess born and raised in Sicily, of helping to impose German barbarity on her homeland. Nevertheless, according to Philippa Byrne, there were also writers and administrators who were receptive to Henry and Constance&#x27;s claims and their efforts to link themselves to the Hauteville tradition.

In 1197 Henry revisited Sicily, when there was a plot to murder him. Henry crushed the rebellion of Jordan Lupin who claimed to be king of Sicily and supposedly received a gift of jewels from Constance. According to German sources hostile to Constance, Constance also joined the revolts against her husband. Apparently, Henry did not act against Constance (other than the fact he had Jordan tortured to death in front of Constance in June 1197) despite reports of her complicity. They continued to live together and issue joint diplomas. On 28 September of that year, Henry died, likely from malaria. Constance was at his death bed and suspected by some of poisoning him (a theory that was criticized by other contemporaries). Theo Kölzer remarks that by this time, their marriage was at a low point. It is possible that the empress felt the mood of her compatriots and passively tolerated the rebels, but the evidence does not conclusively demonstrate that she actively participated in the conspiracies.

== Crowning of Frederick II and Her Death ==
In May 1198, Constance had the three-year-old Frederick crowned King of Sicily with herself as regent. After Henry&#x27;s death, initially she had upheld for her son the double title &quot;Romanorum et Sicilie Rex&quot;, but she abandoned the German claim after the coronation of Frederick in Palermo, May 1198. According to Kölzer, the Pope had put pressure on Constance and Frederick to abandon the title. Additionally, the death of Henry had left in Germany a power vacuum that a child monarch could not fill. Constance likely realized that Frederick&#x27;s perspective in Germany was hopeless and supported the claims of her brother-in-law Philip of Swabia, who was supported by a number of the princes against the Welf candidate, Otto IV.

Her government displayed a full swing towards the Norman tradition (and rejection of Henry&#x27;s vision of imperial rule) after her husband&#x27;s death. She surrounded herself with local advisors and excluded the ambitious Markward von Anweiler from a position of power, attempting to restrict him to his fief in Molise, as well as Walter of Palearia and Conrad I, Duke of Spoleto. While her own health becoming poor, Constance made warm overtures to the new pope Innocent III, abandoning the long-contended principle that the king was the apostolic legate, a central principle of Norman autonomy in the &quot;regno&quot; (when Henry was still alive, she had not hesitated to defend her rights as the natural heiress of her Norman forefathers, even against the authority of the Pope). Faced with the dangers that surrounded any child-king, Constance placed Frederick under the protection of Pope Innocent III, who forced her to cede traditional royal rights over church councils, legates, appeals and elections, leaving her only the right to approve a bishop-elect before he could occupy his see.

She issued diplomas jointly with Frederick after his coronation. Constance maintained her title of Holy Roman Empress Dowager, but she tried to keep options open for her son: she accepted the Pope&#x27;s conditions only as Queen of Sicily and not Empress – her husband had refused to accepted Sicily as a fief from the Pope all his life, to maintain the dignity of the Empire. That he became much more than King of Sicily could not be predicted when she unexpectedly died in late November 1198, before the cardinal sent by the Pope to receive her homage arrived. In her will she set up a Council of Regency for Sicily and made Innocent, who was the child&#x27;s feudal suzerain, his guardian, a reminder to all of the inviolability of his inheritance. She also instructed her subjects to swear fidelity to the Pope.

Constance was buried in the Cathedral of Palermo near the tombs of her father and her husband (and later their son). Her death led to a period of violence and chaos till 1208 when Frederick had grown to his majority. According to historian , the tomb that now holds the remains of Constance was actually the one she had commissioned for her husband. In 1215, Frederick had his father reburied in a porphyry sarcophagus taken from Cefalù (which was one of the two sarcophagi Roger II had commissioned for himself; according to the emperor&#x27;s order, the other one was reserved for himself).

== Views on Constance ==

Historian Vinicius Dreger writes that Constance was probably &quot;maybe the most important woman of Western Europe in late twelfth century&quot;, yet &quot;about her, as on most of her predecessors and contemporaries, we know little.&quot;

Biographer Jacqueline Alio infers that Constance and her sister-in-law Queen Dowager Margaret of Navarre knew each other and in her youth she might have intimated the style of leadership of Margaret, so they might have shared a sisterhood if tenuous. (Whether out of the will of Margaret or not, Constance was not released from her monastery during the lifetime of Margaret, who died in 1183.)

In the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;, Dante places Constance in Paradise (though he subscribed to the story that Constance had been a nun):

Constance had arranged the marriage between her son and a princess of Aragon, which would occur in 1209.

== Film and media ==
Constance is present in a scene in the film about Joachim of Fiore &quot;Joachim and the Apocalypse&quot; by Jordan River. Playing Constance the Italian actress Elisabetta Pellini.

==Controversial accounts==
&quot;De Mulieribus Claris&quot; (Latin for &quot;Concerning Famous Women&quot;) said that Constance was a daughter of King William I of Sicily, and upon her birth a Calabrian abbot named Joachim told William that his daughter would cause the destruction of Sicily. William believed the prediction and shut young Constance up in a monastery and forced her to become a nun to prevent her having husband or children. When permitted to be betrothed to Henry she continuously objected for that she thought her advancing age would become an obstacle, but in vain, &quot;Thus did a wrinkled crone abandon the sacred cloister, discard her monastic veil, and, royally adorned, marry and emerge in public as empress&quot;. This apparently contradicted the facts that Constance was indeed the posthumous daughter of Roger II and half-sister of William and she became empress in 1192. Giovanni Villani said William I sought to put her to death due to the prediction until Tancred a bastard son of Roger I, Count of Sicily persuaded him to send her to a convent.

Some said that it was Roger II who put Constance in a convent, which contradicted the fact that Constance was born after the death of Roger II.

Joachim Camerarius argued that Constance was simply sent to the convent during the coup against William I for her safety and stayed there until her betrothal without ever being a nun. Hugo Falcandus and Richard of San Germano argued Constance was brought up and educated in royal palace rather than a monastery. François Eudes de Mézeray said Constance had never become a nun.

Malespini and Boccaccio said she married at 50 and 55 respectively, and Brantôme argued that she married at 50 and gave birth at 52, while none was true. Florentine chroniclers said that Tancred annoyed the Pope so he and Archbishop of Palermo arranged the marriage of Constance to dethrone Tancred, and Tommaso Fazello said that according to decrees Celestine III absolved her from her vows, which contradicted the fact that Constance was betrothed during the reign of William II who would reign the next five years and Celestine was elected 7 years later; the chroniclers also said that it was wicked for the Pope to force Constance to give in her vows to marry, so Papal States was punished by the Heaven as the son born of the marriage of Constance would become its thorn.

An anonymous Vatican said in his &quot;Historia Sicula&quot; that the reason Constance did not marry before 30 was that she was too ugly, which could not be taken seriously, as political marriages seldom considered the looks of the parties.

<doc id="204333" wikidata="Q5193388" url="?curid=204333" title="Cultural literacy">
<text>Cultural literacy is a term coined by American educator and literary critic E. D. Hirsch, referring to the ability to understand and participate fluently in a given culture. Cultural literacy is an analogy to literacy proper (the ability to read and write letters). A literate reader knows the object-language&#x27;s alphabet, grammar, and a sufficient set of vocabulary; a culturally literate person knows a given culture&#x27;s signs and symbols, including its language, particular dialectic, stories, entertainment, idioms, idiosyncrasies, and so on. The culturally literate person is able to talk to and understand others of that culture with fluency.

==Causes==
Children of a given culture typically become culturally literate there via the process of enculturation. Enculturation seems to occur naturally, being intertwined with education, play, family relationships, friendships, etc. The cause of cultural literacy is a more difficult question when considering acculturation of immigrants, outsiders, cultural minorities, strangers, guests, etc.

Literacy of a given culture seems to arise over time with consistent exposure to and participation in that culture, especially certain key cultural strongholds, like business, story, arts, education, history, religion, and family. One could become literate for an oral culture (with no written language or recorded media) only by extended conversation. Alternatively, one could become literate for a written culture through conversation as well as reading culturally relevant books or exposure to culturally relevant films, plays, monuments, television shows, etc.

Western culture in general and Anglo-American culture in particular is a bibliocentric culture. It often trades in allusions to the Christian Bible, the influential works of Early Modern English such as works of William Shakespeare, the Thomas Cranmer &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;, Geoffrey Chaucer&#x27;s poetry, and many others. Knowledge of these books (among others) contributes largely to cultural literacy in the west. However, also essential are exposure to the art, history, and the lived experience of members of that culture.

==Examples==

For example, in 1908 British author G. K. Chesterton wrote, &quot;Complete self-confidence is a weakness... the man who has [self-confidence] has &#x27;Hanwell&#x27; written on his face as plain as it is written on that omnibus&quot;. This statement, especially the latter half, might be opaque to a reader from outside the United Kingdom, who does not know that &quot;omnibus&quot; is a less common British word for &quot;bus&quot; and &quot;Hanwell&quot; was the name of a (now defunct) insane asylum.

==Consequences==
The benefits and detriments of cultural literacy are debated. For example, social mobility increases when one is able to comfortably participate in conversation with gatekeepers like employers and teachers. Non-native members of a culture, such as missionaries to a foreign land or refugees from a native land, may experience negative consequences due to cultural illiteracy. However, the achievement of cultural literacy may seem to come at a cost to one&#x27;s own native culture.

==Research and questions==

Discussions of cultural literacy have given rise to several controversial questions:
*The Literature Question: How important are books to cultural literacy in the west? And which books? 
*The Content Question: What kinds of knowledge are important for cultural literacy? Knowing such and such facts, names, dates or more ethereal experiences like having heard such and such a song? 
*The Minority Question: Is cultural literacy part of the hegemony of the dominant culture? 
*The Multicultural Question: Which culture are we talking about when we say &quot;cultural&quot; literacy? Should we be talking about one or several—and which one(s)? 
*The Education Question: Should advancing cultural literacy be one of the goals of education? If so, what is the best means of doing so? 
*The Assessment Question: How do we evaluate cultural literacy? Is there a best way to test someone&#x27;s cultural literacy?

<doc id="204334" wikidata="Q11676" url="?curid=204334" title="George Pataki">
<text>George Elmer Pataki (; born June 24, 1945) is an American politician who served as the 53rd governor of New York from 1995 to 2006. He previously served in the State Legislature from 1985 to 1994, and as the mayor of Peekskill from 1981 to 1984. Pataki was the third Republican since 1923 to win New York&#x27;s governorship, after Thomas E. Dewey and Nelson Rockefeller, and is the most recent one to do so.

Pataki&#x27;s most notable achievements as governor included the creation of a number of new health care programs, presiding over recovery efforts following the September 11 attacks, and for increasing the state&#x27;s credit rating three times. He chose not to run for a fourth term in 2006; he was succeeded by Democrat Eliot Spitzer. Pataki and Mary Donohue (his second Lt. Governor) are the last Republicans elected to statewide office in New York, although Republicans Joseph Bruno and Dean Skelos each briefly served as acting Lieutenant Governor in 2008.

Pataki announced his candidacy for the Republican Party presidential nomination on May 28, 2015. He withdrew from the race shortly before the primaries began on December 29, 2015.

==Early life and education==
Pataki was born on June 24, 1945 in Peekskill, New York. Pataki&#x27;s paternal grandfather was Pataki János (known in the U.S. as &quot;John Pataki&quot;, 1883–1971) of Aranyosapáti, Kingdom of Hungary. The family name&#x27;s Hungarian pronunciation is and means &quot;from the creek (little river).&quot; János came to the United States in 1908, worked in a hat factory and had married Erzsébet (later Elizabeth; 1887–1975), also Hungarian-born, around 1904. Their son, Pataki&#x27;s father, was Louis P. Pataki (1912–1996), a mailman and volunteer fire chief, who ran the Pataki Farm. Pataki&#x27;s maternal grandfather was Matteo Laganà (born in Calabria, Italy in 1889), who married Agnes Lynch of County Louth, Ireland around 1914. Their daughter, Margaret Lagana (1915–2017), is Pataki&#x27;s mother. Pataki has an older brother, Louis. Pataki speaks some Hungarian as well as Spanish, French, and German.

After graduating from Peekskill High School, Pataki entered Yale University in 1963 on an academic scholarship and graduated in 1967. While there, Pataki was Chairman of the Conservative Party of the Yale Political Union, where he participated in debates. He received his J.D. from Columbia Law School in 1970.

==Early political career==

While practicing law at Plunkett and Jaffe, P.C. in Peekskill, Pataki became friends with Michael C. Finnegan, who would go on to be the architect of Pataki&#x27;s ascendancy to power. Finnegan would go on to manage Pataki&#x27;s campaigns for Mayor, State Assembly, State Senate, and the governorship. Finnegan was then appointed chief counsel to the governor in 1995, and played the key role in developing and negotiating nearly all of Pataki&#x27;s early legislative success.

===Mayor of Peekskill===
Pataki first won elected office in November 1981. He was elected mayor of the city of Peekskill, which is located in the northwestern part of Westchester County. Pataki defeated Democratic incumbent Fred Bianco Jr., winning 70% of the vote. In November 1983, he was re-elected mayor, winning 74% of the vote.

===New York State Assembly===
In November 1984, Pataki was elected to the New York State Assembly (91st District), by defeating one-term Democratic incumbent William J. Ryan, winning 53% of the vote. In November 1986, Pataki defeated Ryan in a rematch, capturing 63% of the vote. Pataki won a third term in November 1988, winning 74% of the vote against Democratic candidate Mark Zinna. Pataki won a fourth and final term in November 1990, winning over 90% of the vote, as he only faced a minor party candidate. He was an assemblyman in the 186th, 187th, 188th and 189th New York State Legislatures.

===New York State Senate===
From 1983 to 1992, the 91st Assembly district included parts of Westchester, Orange, Rockland, and Putnam Counties. However, in 1992, Assembly Democrats substantially redrew the district boundaries, placing the newly renamed 90th Assembly district entirely within Westchester County. Instead of running in the newly redrawn district, Pataki decided to challenge seven-term incumbent Republican State Senator Mary B. Goodhue in a Republican primary in Senate District 37 by criticizing her for taking her grandchildren to Disney World and missing a vote in Albany. Pataki won the primary by a 52% to 48% margin. However, Goodhue still planned to appear on the November ballot on a minor party line. In November 1992, Pataki won the general election. He served in the Senate during the 190th New York State Legislature and ran for governor at the next election.

==Gubernatorial campaigns==
===1994 campaign===

Pataki was a first-term state senator from Westchester County when he launched his bid for the Republican nomination for governor in 1994. He said he launched the campaign because of his frustration in the Senate regarding how Albany worked and on tax issues. Pataki&#x27;s campaign received a boost when he was endorsed by U.S. Sen. Al D&#x27;Amato. He received the party&#x27;s endorsement at the spring state convention and easily defeated former State Republican Chairman Richard Rosenbaum in the September primary. Pataki was considered an underdog from the start since he was running against three-term Gov. Mario Cuomo and because Pataki had little name recognition statewide. D&#x27;Amato reportedly backed Pataki because of a poll that showed a pro-choice, fiscal conservative from the New York City suburbs could win statewide for governor. The poll also showed a female running mate for lieutenant governor would help the ticket. Academic Betsy McCaughey was chosen as Pataki&#x27;s running mate.

The polls had Governor Cuomo ahead by as many as ten points going into the final two weeks, but they narrowed at the end. Pataki made an issue of Cuomo seeking a fourth term as governor and pledged to serve only two terms in office. Cuomo was helped late in the race by the endorsement of New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani. Pataki narrowly defeated Cuomo in the general election. Many, including Pataki himself, believed Howard Stern&#x27;s endorsement of Pataki was a major reason for his win. He finished with 48.8% of the vote to Cuomo&#x27;s 45.5%, and independence candidate Tom Golisano finished with 4.2%.

Pataki made up for a soft performance in New York City by running up a decisive margin outside of it, especially among upstaters disenchanted with Cuomo. Pataki won all but one county outside the Five Boroughs. Pataki became New York&#x27;s first elected Republican governor since Nelson Rockefeller.

===1998 campaign===

Pataki was considered the front-runner from the start of the 1998 campaign for governor. He was unopposed for the Republican nomination and paired with a new running mate, Judge Mary Donohue. The Democrats faced a primary battle between New York City Council Speaker Peter Vallone, Lt. Gov. Betsy McCaughey Ross, who had switched parties, and former Transportation Commissioner James LaRocca. Vallone captured the Democratic nomination, with Thomas Golisano running as the Independence nominee and McCaughey Ross as the Liberal Party nominee. Pataki was easily reelected to a second term in office. He finished with 54.3% of the vote, his highest percentage finish in a gubernatorial race, to Vallone&#x27;s 33.2% and Golisano&#x27;s 7.7%. This is the last time a Republican has won a majority in a statewide election in New York, and the first time since 1970, when Nelson Rockefeller was re-elected.

===2002 campaign===

Pataki was considered a strong contender for a third term, despite having pledged in 1994 to serve only two terms. He ran again on a ticket with Lt. Gov. Mary Donohue and the Democrats faced a primary battle between State Comptroller Carl McCall and former HUD Secretary Andrew Cuomo, Mario Cuomo&#x27;s son. Pataki emphasized his previous work and the need to have continuity following Sept. 11.

McCall essentially secured the Democratic nomination when Andrew Cuomo stumbled (and ultimately withdrew before the primary at the urging of his mentor Bill Clinton); Cuomo was quoted in the media as saying, regarding Pataki&#x27;s performance post-9/11:

Pataki stood behind the leader. He held the leader&#x27;s coat. He was a great assistant to the leader. But he was not a leader. Cream rises to the top, and Rudy Giuliani rose to the top.

Pataki sought the nomination of the Independence Party of New York in his bid for a third term as well. He faced the party&#x27;s founder and 1994 and 1998 nominee, Thomas Golisano, in his bid for the nomination. Pataki ran an active primary campaign and lost to Golisano. Donohue did win the primary for lieutenant governor and was the running mate of both Pataki and Golisano in the general election.

In the general election, Pataki defeated McCall and Golisano easily. As in 1998 due to Golisano&#x27;s presence on the ballot, Pataki did not win a majority, instead winning a plurality. Pataki won 49.4% of the vote, and McCall only mustered 33.5% with wins in four of the five New York City boroughs. Golisano finished with the highest vote total of his political career, and the highest vote total for any candidate of the Independence Party of New York in any statewide election.

This was the last time a Republican was elected Governor of New York, and the last time a Republican has cracked over 41% in a gubernatorial election until the 2022 election in which Republican candidate Congressman Lee Zeldin amassed 47% of the vote against incumbent Democrat Kathy Hochul.

===Retirement from the governorship===
By the summer of 2005, opinion polls indicated that Pataki would face an uphill battle if he sought a fourth term in 2006. Accordingly, he announced on July 27, 2005, that he would not do so, saying that New York was &quot;a better state than it was 10 years ago&quot; and that he was retiring so he could &quot;follow a new path, find new challenges.&quot; He was succeeded by Democrat Eliot Spitzer.

==Governorship and political positions==
As Governor of New York, Pataki was known as a moderate to Liberal Republican who cut taxes and was tough on crime, but who also supported gun control, environmental protection, gay rights, and abortion rights.

===Fiscal policy===
====Taxes, spending, budget power, and economic growth====
Under the Pataki Administration, New York&#x27;s credit rating was increased three times by Moody&#x27;s Investors Service, a fact that he highlighted often before his critics. During his three terms in office, he introduced and approved more tax cuts than any of his predecessors. Following through on a campaign promise, Pataki led a push to cut both the individual and the corporate tax rates in New York. The state&#x27;s infamously high income tax rates dropped by 20% on average, but an economic downturn following the attacks of September 11 and increasing state spending caused Sheldon Silver and Joseph Bruno to coordinate an effort to roll back a number of these cuts in 2003 over Pataki&#x27;s veto power.

The STAR and STAR-Plus programs were also introduced during Pataki&#x27;s governorship. The STAR program introduced tax relief for New York&#x27;s homeowners and landowners on their school taxes. The STAR-Plus program was later introduced when relief was diminished by increasing school taxes, increasing spending and State Aid. In his third term Pataki challenged the Speaker of the Assembly, resulting in two Court of Appeals decisions sustaining the powers of the governor to formulate a statewide budget.

====Casinos====

Pataki advocated for Native American casinos in upstate New York. As a part of the creation of the Seneca Niagara Casino in Niagara Falls, an agreement was reached to give a percentage of the slot machine revenue to the City of Niagara Falls each year to spend on local tourism projects and projects relating to hosting the casino.

===Social policy===
====Abortion====
Pataki describes himself as pro-choice. In 1999, he called upon the Republican Party to soften its platform language regarding opposition to abortion rights.

====Gay rights====
Pataki lobbied heavily in favor of the Sexual Orientation Non-Discrimination Act, a gay rights bill that had languished in the state Senate for many years due to the opposition of Senate Leader Joseph Bruno. In late 2002, Bruno finally gave in; the bill passed the Senate and was signed into law by Pataki. He opposed same-sex marriage as governor.

====Crime====
Polls showed that the majority of New Yorkers wanted the state&#x27;s death penalty laws restored. Prior to Pataki&#x27;s tenure, a bill to restore the death penalty had passed the Legislature for several years in a row only to be vetoed by Mario Cuomo. Pataki made the issue a top priority of his, and when the bill reached his desk in 1995, he signed it into law. The New York Court of Appeals later ruled the death penalty law unconstitutional in a 4–3 decision in People v. LaValle (2004).

Being tough on crime was a major plank of Pataki&#x27;s campaign for governor. In 2011, the administration touted statistics that illustrated that crime had steadily reduced during the 12 years Pataki had been governor, bringing New York from the 6th most dangerous state in the nation to the 7th safest. During his time in office, he signed into law over 100 new bills to change New York&#x27;s criminal statutes. In 2000, Pataki helped lead the legislature in passing some of the then-strictest gun control laws in the country. Numerous aspects of the bill had been put forward by members of the Democratic-controlled Assembly but had never made it through the Republican held Senate. With numerous mass shootings in recent public memory, he urged a number of Republican Senators to support the bill, eventually passing it in a bipartisan effort. His administration also launched programs such as SAF-T (Statewide Anti-Fugitive Teams) and the 100 Most Wanted. The initiatives were aimed at disseminating descriptions of criminals who were evading law enforcement officials to promote the ability of average citizens to help aid in their capture. Versions of Megan&#x27;s Law and Kendra&#x27;s Law were integrated into New York&#x27;s laws under the governor as well as a number of reforms to the Rockefeller Drug Laws. The changes to the Rockefeller laws were largely focused on inmates&#x27; ability to appeal for an early release from sentences that were passed on them under mandatory minimum sentencing statutes.

====Health care====
Under the Pataki Administration a number of new health care programs were created focusing on expanding care to the state&#x27;s poorest citizens.
In 1999, Governor Pataki signed into law comprehensive health care legislation that provided health insurance coverage, under Family Health Plus, to lower income adults who do not have health insurance through their employers.
Child Health plus greatly expanded coverage for poorer families with children under 19 who did not qualify for Medicaid. By 2001, 530,000 children had been enrolled in the program. Family Health Plus would expand insurance coverage even further, offering free insurance to families and single adults who had too much income to be covered by Medicaid but could not afford insurance. Pataki also increased the affordability and availability of medication for seniors under New York&#x27;s EPIC program by lowering fees and expanding eligibility. New York&#x27;s 2003 ban on smoking in public places was passed and signed into law under the Pataki administration in the hopes that it would promote better health in New York and reduce health care cost over time. Accessing his twelve years in office, &quot;The New York Times&quot; ran an editorial praising his work on health care.

====Environment====
In 2005, &quot;BusinessWeek&quot; placed George Pataki among the 20 individuals it commended for their personal efforts to combat global warming, citing his Greenhouse Gas Task Force and efforts to increase New York&#x27;s usage of renewable energies. In 1996, Pataki oversaw the creation and passage of the Clean Water/Clean Air Environmental Bond Act. The act put forth $1.75 billion for over 2,200 environmentally minded projects throughout the state. Projects were focused on improving drinking water quality, closing landfills, investing in recycling programs, cleaning up New York&#x27;s polluted waterways, funding cleanup of Brownfields and clean-air projects. During his tenure, Pataki added over one million acres to the entirety of the protected open spaces of New York. He also worked to protect the drinking water of millions of New Yorkers through the Catskill Watershed Agreement. Through the agreement, the numerous small communities that surround the 19 reservoirs that provide drinking water for New York City received $1 billion in aid to assuage environmental issues and promote local development in return for accepting higher standards of environmental regulations to better protect the reservoirs. On Pataki&#x27;s final day in office, &quot;The New York Times&quot; ran an editorial evaluating his twelve years as governor and praised his work on the environment.

====Education====
Pataki heeded mounting desire to allow New York to join numerous other states in the growing movement for charter schools. In 1998, Pataki prevailed upon the Legislature to pass a charter school law by threatening to veto a legislative pay raise if the bill was not passed. Over the course of his terms in office, Pataki would expand the availability of charter schools in New York City and raise the state&#x27;s cap on charter schools to 250.

In coordination with Mayor Rudy Giuliani, Pataki pushed to begin disassembling the reputation of City University of New York system as a group of remedial schools. Starting in 1999, CUNY colleges would be required to drop their remedial courses over a 3-year period and restrict students who could not pass entry exams in an effort to deliver a higher quality college education through the city colleges. Pataki also put forth legislation that would lend mayors in New York&#x27;s five largest cities greater control over their education systems. Through negotiations this authority was only awarded to the mayor of New York City as an attempt to overcome a system of school boards that many considered to be hampering efforts at reform.

====Political reform====
Looking over his tenure, &quot;The New York Times&quot; ran an editorial that criticized Pataki for the lack of tangible political reform and the consolidation of power under his watch.

===September 11 terrorist attacks and aftermath===
Pataki&#x27;s New York City office had moved out of the World Trade Center in the months before the September 11, 2001, attacks, as the governor had pushed for privatization of the building.

Following 9/11, Pataki and New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani appointed the LMDC to distribute nearly $10 billion in federal grants and to oversee the construction of a memorial. A symbolic cornerstone for the Freedom Tower with Pataki&#x27;s name was laid on July 4, 2004, and after numerous design changes, construction commenced in May 2006. The memorial was completed in 2011.

===Lieutenant governors===
====Betsy McCaughey Ross====

Pataki&#x27;s 1994 running mate for lieutenant governor was Betsy McCaughey, an academic best known for her critique of the Clinton health care plan. McCaughey was selected because of her work on the Clinton health care plan. Pataki choose McCaughey over sofa bed heiress Bernadette Castro; Castro was nominated for the U.S. Senate in 1994.

In April 1997, Pataki announced that he was dropping McCaughey from his 1998 reelection ticket. McCaughey became a Democrat and unsuccessfully sought the governorship in that party&#x27;s 1998 primary. She was on the 1998 general election ballot as the nominee of the Liberal Party for governor.

====Mary Donohue====

After dropping McCaughey Ross from his 1998 ticket, Pataki considered several replacement running mates. In the spring of 1998 he announced his choice of State Supreme Court Justice Mary Donohue for lieutenant governor. Donohue did not run to succeed Pataki in 2006. In December 2006, Pataki appointed Donohue to be a Judge of the New York Court of Claims.

==Political involvement during gubernatorial tenure==
===2000 presidential election===

In July 2000, Pataki&#x27;s name surfaced on the short list to be the running mate for Republican presidential nominee George W. Bush, along with the names of Governor John Engler of Michigan, Governor Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania, former Senator John Danforth of Missouri, and former U.S. Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole of North Carolina. Bush eventually selected the man who was in charge of scouting vice presidential candidates, former Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney. Pataki had strongly campaigned for Bush, making an unsuccessful effort to keep John McCain off the New York primary ballot (which Bush ultimately won).

===2004 Republican U.S. Senate primary===
Pataki and New York GOP Chairman Sandy Treadwell faced controversy after naming moderate Assemblyman Howard Mills the party&#x27;s nominee for the U.S. Senate against Senator Chuck Schumer over conservative Michael Benjamin, who held significant advantages in both fundraising and organization. Benjamin publicly accused Treadwell and Pataki of trying to muscle him out of the Senate race and undermine the democratic process. Mills went on to lose the election in the largest landslide for a Senate seat in the history of New York.

===2004 presidential election===
Pataki was instrumental in bringing the 2004 Republican National Convention to Madison Square Garden in Manhattan. New York City, which normally votes overwhelmingly Democratic (the Democratic presidential nominees carried 78 percent of the city vote in both 2000 and 2004), had never hosted a Republican Convention. He introduced President George W. Bush. A year prior, Pataki had boasted Bush would carry the state in the 2004 elections; Bush lost New York 58–40 to John Kerry. Pataki notably orated, referencing the recently deceased Ronald Reagan, &quot;This fall, we&#x27;re going to win one for the Gipper. But our opponents, they&#x27;re going to lose one with the Flipper.&quot;

==Post-governorship==
After leaving the governorship, Pataki joined the law firm Chadbourne &amp; Parke in New York joining their renewable energy practice. He continued to flirt with a possible bid for president. After ruling out a presidential campaign, Pataki retained his political action committee, which he could legally use to further his own views and other political interests. In addition, Pataki has formed an environmental consulting firm with his former chief of staff John Cahill, the Pataki-Cahill Group.

Pataki holds an amateur radio license.

===Governor George E. Pataki Leadership and Learning Center===
The Governor George E. Pataki Leadership and Learning Center, located in Peekskill, New York, is designed to educate schoolchildren on government using Governor Pataki&#x27;s public service as an example. Charles A. Gargano, Pataki&#x27;s former economic development chief, led the effort to create the center. On August 14, 2008, the &quot;New York Times&quot; announced that the center&#x27;s sponsors had &quot;filed paperwork with the State Department of Education and are trying to raise $500,000 for a start-up fund so they can open the center in the fall.&quot; The center held Governor Pataki&#x27;s official portrait, which was moved to Albany at the end of 2009. As of 2008, the center had three directors: David Catalfamo, the governor&#x27;s former communications chief; Kimberly Cappelleri, Libby Pataki&#x27;s former chief of staff; and, Amy Holden, former executive assistant to the governor.

===Declined 2010 U.S. Senate bid===

In February 2009, Pataki was approached by Sen. John Cornyn, head of the Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee, about a possible 2010 run for the U.S. Senate seat to which Kirsten Gillibrand had been appointed. In April 2010, Pataki said he would not run against Gillibrand.

===2012 presidential speculation===
In November 2009, Pataki traveled to Iowa, sparking speculation. Ending months of speculation, Pataki announced on August 26, 2011, that he would not run for the Republican presidential nomination. He endorsed Mitt Romney.

===Revere America===
Pataki announced in April 2010 that he was creating a nonprofit organization, Revere America, that would advocate repeal of the recently enacted United States Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which he said was a &quot;horrific&quot; and costly bungle. As of 2015, the organization is defunct.

===2016 presidential campaign===
In early 2015, Pataki started exploring a candidacy for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination; On May 28, 2015, Pataki formally announced his campaign for the 2016 Republican nomination. He had previously considered running in 2008 and in 2012, but had decided against it.

Pataki&#x27;s candidacy was considered a long-shot because of his age, because he had not run for office since 2002, and because of his liberal stances on abortion, gun control and environmental protection. Pataki received the endorsements of two New Hampshire State Senators: John Reagan and Nancy Stiles.

Pataki&#x27;s run failed to gain traction. He failed to make the main stage in the candidate debates, being relegated to the undercard debates or being excluded altogether. His national poll numbers stayed in the one percent range. Pataki did not file to be on the primary ballot in multiple states and missed the filing deadlines for Alabama, Arkansas, Idaho, Ohio, Oklahoma, Texas, Utah, and Virginia. On December 29, 2015, Pataki ended his campaign before the Republican presidential primaries had begun. He endorsed Florida Senator Marco Rubio on January 26, 2016 and went on to endorse Ohio Governor John Kasich after Rubio suspended his campaign.

After video footage of eventual nominee Donald Trump making lewd comments about women emerged on October 7, 2016, Pataki described the Republican nominee&#x27;s candidacy as &quot;a poisonous mix of bigotry &amp; ignorance.&quot; Pataki also called upon Trump to step down as the Republican nominee.

=== 2020 presidential election ===
In 2020, he declined to endorse Donald Trump for re-election. He stopped short of endorsing Joe Biden, citing disagreements with foreign policy relating to U.S.-China relations. Pataki opposed efforts to decertify the election results.

===2022 New York gubernatorial election===
In September 2022, Pataki endorsed Republican candidate Lee Zeldin for Governor of New York, against incumbent Democrat Kathy Hochul. Zeldin went on to lose the election by 6.4%, the closest margin since Pataki&#x27;s 1994 win.

==Personal life==
Pataki married his wife, Libby, in 1973. The Patakis have four children.

Pataki is Catholic.

Pataki suffered a burst appendix and had an emergency appendectomy on February 16, 2006, at Hudson Valley Hospital Center. Six days later, he developed a post-surgical complication (bowel obstruction caused by adhesions) and was transferred to New York-Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center for a second operation. From there, he was discharged on March 6.

Pataki has been an intense critic of the Cuomo and Hochul administrations. In 2022, he was considered to be a contender for Governor of New York for a fourth, non-consecutive term.

<doc id="204337" wikidata="Q718191" url="?curid=204337" title="Uthong">
<text>King U-thong (; ) or King Ramathibodi I (; ; , 1314–1369) was the first king of the kingdom Ayutthaya (now part of Thailand), reigning from 1351 to 1369.

==Origins and Reign==
He was known as Prince U Thong (meaning &quot;Golden Cradle&quot;) before he ascended to the throne in 1350. There are many theories about Uthong&#x27;s background, including possibly being a descendant of Mangrai. According to a better-known source, a seventeenth-century account by Dutchman Jeremias van Vliet, a &quot;Renowned Legend&quot; stated that Ramatibodi was an ethnic Chinese, having sailed down from China. After succeeding in trade, he became influential enough to rule the city of Phetchaburi, (or Vajrapur in sanskrit ) a coastal town of the Gulf of Thailand, before travelling up to Ayutthaya.

Ramathibodi I established four Great Officers of State. These were the Ministry of the Interior (&quot;Wieng&quot;), the Ministry of the Treasury (&quot;Klang&quot;), the Ministry for the King&#x27;s Household (&quot;Wang&quot;), and the Ministry of Agriculture (&quot;Na&quot;). He also codified the T&#x27;ai laws. Finally, he formed an alliance with the Ming dynasty.

He established his own capital in the new city of Ayutthaya. King Ramathabodi&#x27;s reign included Korat, Chantaburi, Tavoy, Tanintharyi, Tenasserim, and large parts of Malaya.

In 1352 he laid siege to Yasodharapura. He was successful the following year and placed one of his sons on the throne. However, they were only able to keep the throne until 1357, when the Khmers were able to regain it.

==Conflict of two dynasties==
King Ramathibodi&#x27;s death sparked a conflict over succession. Initially, his son King Ramesuan became ruler of Ayutthaya, but his son later abdicated in favor of Ramathibodi&#x27;s brother-in-law and the ruler of Suvarnabhumi, King Borommarachathirat I. In 1388 Ramesuan took revenge by taking Ayutthaya back from Borommarachathirat I&#x27;s son, Thonglan. and followed by Borommarachathirat I&#x27;s nephew Intharacha took Ayutthaya back for Suphannaphum dynasty in 1408. From then on Uthong dynasty was then purged and became a mere noble family of Ayutthaya until the 16th century.

<text>Jacob Radcliff or Radclift (April 20, 1764 – May 6, 1844) was a jurist, lawyer and politician.

He served as Mayor of New York City from 1810 to 1811, and from 1815 to 1818.

==Early life and education==
He was born on April 20, 1764, in Rhinebeck, Dutchess County, New York.

Radcliff graduated from Princeton University in 1783

==Career and marriage==
Radcliff practiced law under Egbert Benson, the first New York Attorney General. He was admitted to the bar in 1786.

About the same time, he married Juliana Smith, the daughter of Cotton Mather Smith and descendent of Richard Mather.

While practicing law in Poughkeepsie, New York, he was a member of the New York State Assembly (Dutchess County) in the 1795 18th New York State Legislature and was one of the twelve members of the Joint Committee on Elections of the Senate and Assembly of New York.

He was appointed Assistant Attorney General on February 23, 1796.

On December 27, 1798, he became a justice of the New York Supreme Court. In this position, he helped revise the state&#x27;s laws. He resigned from the bench in 1804, and practiced chancery law in Brooklyn.

When the Federalist Party gained the majority in 1810, Radcliff was appointed mayor of New York City. When the War of 1812 divided the Federalist party, Radcliff aligned with the Tammany Society, which was poised to gain a majority in state politics. Grand Sachem of Tammany Hall John Ferguson became mayor in 1815 but resigned to take the appointment of Surveyor of the Port of New York. Radcliff was chosen as his replacement.

==Death==
He died in Troy, New York, on May 6, 1844.

<text>[[Muang]] Sua (, ) was the name of Luang Phrabang following its conquest in 698 by a Tai/Lao prince, Khun Lo, who seized his opportunity when the king of Nanzhao was engaged elsewhere. Khun Lo had been awarded the town by his father, Khun Borom, who is associated with the Lao legend of the creation of the world, which the Lao share with the Shan and other peoples of the region. Khun Lo established a dynasty whose fifteen rulers reigned over an independent Muang Sua for the better part of a century.

==History==

Muang Sua, nowadays known as Luang Prabang, was named in 698 following its conquest, by the Lao prince Khun Lo, who awarded the town to his father Khun Borom, the legendary progenitor of the Lao race and it is the first laos kingdom.

In the second half of the eighth century, Nanzhao intervened frequently in the affairs of the principalities of the middle Mekong Valley, resulting in the occupation of Muang Sua in 709. Nanzhao princes or administrators replaced the aristocracy of Tai overlords. Dates of the occupation are not known, but it probably ended well before the northward expansion of the Khmer Empire under Indravarman I (reigned 877–889) and extended as far as the territories of Sipsong Panna on the upper Mekong.

In the meantime, the Khmers founded an outpost at Xayfong near Vientiane, and Champa expanded again in southern Laos, maintaining its presence on the banks of the Mekong until 1070. Chanthaphanit, the local ruler of Xayfong, moved north to Muang Sua and was accepted peacefully as ruler after the departure of the Nanzhao administrators. Chanthaphanit and his son had long reigns, during which the town became known by the Tai name Xieng Dong Xieng Thong. The dynasty eventually became involved in the squabbles of a number of principalities. Khun Chuang, a warlike ruler who may have been a Kammu (alternate spellings include Khamu and Khmu) tribesman, extended his territory as a result of the warring of these principalities and probably ruled from 1128 to 1169. The family of Khun Chuang reinstituted the Lao administrative system of the 7th century. Muang Sua next became the Kingdom of Sri Sattanak, a name connected with the legend of the naga (mythical snake or water dragon) who was said to have dug the Mekong riverbed. At this time, Theravada Buddhism was subsumed by Mahayana Buddhism.

Muang Sua experienced a brief period of Khmer suzerainty under Jayavarman VII from 1185 to 1191. By 1180 the Sipsong Panna had regained their independence from the Khmers, however, and in 1238 an internal uprising in the Khmer outpost of Sukhothai expelled the Khmer overlords.

Recent historical research has shown that the Mongols, who destroyed Dali in 1253 and made the area a province of their empire—naming it Yunnan—exercised a decisive political influence in the middle Mekong Valley for the better part of a century. In 1271 Panya Lang, founder of a new dynasty headed by rulers bearing the title panya (lord), began his rule over a fully sovereign Muang Sua. In 1286 Panya Lang&#x27;s son, Panya Khamphong, was involved in a coup d&#x27;état that was probably instigated by the Mongols and that exiled his father. Upon his father&#x27;s death in 1316, Panya Khamphong assumed his throne.

Ram Khamhaeng, an early ruler of the new Thai dynasty in Sukhothai, made himself the agent of Mongol interests, and in 1282-84 eliminated the vestiges of Khmer and Cham power in central Laos. Ramkhamhaeng obtained the allegiance of Muang Sua and the mountainous country to the northeast. Between 1286 and 1297, Panya Khamphong&#x27;s lieutenants, acting for Ramkhamhaeng and the Mongols, pacified vast territories. From 1297 to 1301, Lao troops under Mongol command invaded Dai Viet but were repulsed by the Vietnamese. Troops from Muang Sua conquered Muang Phuan in 1292–97. In 1308 Panya Khamphong seized the ruler of Muang Phuan, and by 1312 this principality was a vassal state of Muang Sua.

Mongol overlordship was unpopular in Muang Sua. Internal conflicts among members of the new dynasty over Mongol intervention in their affairs resulted in continuing family upheavals. Panya Khamphong exiled his son Fa Phi Fa and most likely intended to leave the throne to his younger grandson, Fa Ngieo. Fa Ngieo, involved in various coups and coup attempts, in 1330 sent his two sons to a Buddhist monastery outside the Mongol realm for safety. The brothers were kidnapped in 1335 and taken to Angkor, where they were entrusted to King Jayavarman IX, whose kingdom had acknowledged Mongol suzerainty since 1285.

The younger brother, Fa Ngum, married one of the king&#x27;s daughters and in 1349 set out from Angkor at the head of a 10,000-man army. His conquest of the territories to the north of Angkor over the next six years reopened Mongol communications with that place, which had been cut off. Fa Ngum organized the conquered principalities into provinces, and reclaimed Muang Sua from his father and elder brother. Fa Ngum was crowned king of Lan Xang at Vientiane, the site of one of his victories, in June 1354. Lan Xang extended from the border of China to Sambor below the Mekong rapids at Khong Island and from the Vietnamese border to the western escarpment of the Khorat Plateau.

<text>Renée Kathleen Zellweger ( ; born April 25, 1969) is an American actress. The recipient of various accolades, including two Academy Awards, two British Academy Film Awards, and four Golden Globe Awards, she was one of the world&#x27;s highest-paid actresses by 2007.

Born and raised in Texas, Zellweger studied English literature at the University of Texas at Austin. Initially aspiring for a career in journalism, she was drawn to acting following her brief work on stage while in college. Following minor roles in &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot; (1993) and &quot;Reality Bites&quot; (1994), her first starring role came with the slasher film &quot;The Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre&quot; (1995). She rose to prominence with starring roles in the romantic comedy &quot;Jerry Maguire&quot; (1996), the drama &quot;One True Thing&quot; (1998), and the black comedy &quot;Nurse Betty&quot; (2000), winning a Golden Globe Award for the last of these.

For portraying Bridget Jones in the romantic comedy &quot;Bridget Jones&#x27;s Diary&quot; (2001) and Roxie Hart in the musical &quot;Chicago&quot; (2002), Zellweger gained consecutive nominations for the Academy Award for Best Actress. She won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for playing a loquacious farmer in the war film &quot;Cold Mountain&quot; (2003). She reprised her role as Jones in the sequel &quot;Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason&quot; (2004), and, following a career downturn and hiatus, in &quot;Bridget Jones&#x27;s Baby&quot; (2016). In 2019, Zellweger starred in her first major television role in the Netflix series &quot;What/If,&quot; and portrayed Judy Garland in the biopic &quot;Judy&quot;, winning the Academy Award for Best Actress. She has since starred as Pam Hupp in the NBC crime miniseries &quot;The Thing About Pam&quot; (2022) and played Jones again in &quot;Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy&quot; (2025).

==Early life ==
Renée Kathleen Zellweger was born on April 25, 1969, in Katy, Texas. Her father, Emil Erich Zellweger, is from the Swiss town of Au, St. Gallen. He was a mechanical and electrical engineer who worked in the oil-refining business. Her mother, Kjellfrid, is Norwegian of Kven and Sámi descent. Kjellfrid grew up in Ekkerøy near the town Vadsø in the northern part of Norway. She was a nurse and midwife who moved to the United States to work as a governess for a Norwegian family in Texas. Referring to her religious background, Zellweger has described herself as being raised in a family of &quot;lazy Catholics and Episcopalians&quot;.

Zellweger attended Katy High School, where she was a cheerleader and active in athletics. She also participated in soccer and powderpuff football. In 1986, her academic paper, &quot;The Karankawas and Their Roots&quot;, won third place in the first-ever &quot;Houston Post&quot; High School Natural Science Essay Contest. After high school, she enrolled at the University of Texas at Austin, where she graduated in 1992 with a Bachelor of Arts in English Literature. While at the university, she took a drama course as an elective, which sparked her interest in acting.

In her junior year, her father lost his job and was unable to support her at college, so she took a job as a cocktail waitress in Austin, Texas. She said of the job, &quot;I learned a lot. As much as I did in my classes that that club paid for... I learned not to judge people, [and] that things are not black and white.&quot; She began getting small parts acting, and earned her Screen Actors Guild card for doing a Coors Light commercial. Also while in college, she did &quot;a bit part ... as a local hire&quot; in the Austin-filmed horror-comedy film &quot;My Boyfriend&#x27;s Back&quot;, playing &quot;the girl in the beauty shop, maybe two lines. But the beauty shop [scene] got cut.&quot; Her first job after graduation was working in a beef commercial, while simultaneously auditioning for roles around Houston, Texas.

==Career==
===1992–1995: Early roles===
While still in Texas, Zellweger appeared in several independent and low-budget films. One was &quot;A Taste for Killing&quot; (1992), followed by a role in the ABC miniseries &quot;Murder in the Heartland&quot; (1993). Also in 1993, she had an uncredited role in &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot;. In 1994, she appeared in &quot;Reality Bites&quot;, the directorial debut of Ben Stiller, and in the biographical film &quot;8 Seconds&quot;, directed by John G. Avildsen. Her first main role in a movie came with the 1995 horror film &quot;The Return of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre&quot;, alongside Matthew McConaughey, playing a teenager who leaves a prom early with three friends who get into a car accident, which leads to their meeting a murderous family, led by the iconic Leatherface. While the film went unnoticed, Joe Leydon for &quot;Variety&quot; magazine lauded Zellweger, calling her &quot;the most formidable scream queen since Jamie Lee Curtis went legit.&quot;

In her next film, the crime comedy &quot;Love and a .45&quot; (1994), Zellweger played a woman who plans a robbery with her boyfriend. Although the film received a limited release in theaters, Marc Savlov of &quot;Austin Chronicle&quot; applauded the main cast saying they were &quot;all excellent in their roles&quot; and noted that &quot;Zellweger&#x27;s character – all squeals and caged sexuality – seems a bit too close to Juliette Lewis&#x27; Mallory Knox (of &quot;Natural Born Killers&quot;) to be as fresh as it should be&quot;. The part earned her an Independent Spirit Award for Best Debut Performance. She subsequently relocated to Los Angeles, a move she had postponed several times because she believed she lacked the talent and experience to be a competitive actor in that city. She would next appear in the coming-of-age drama &quot;Empire Records&quot; (1995). Rotten Tomatoes&#x27; consensus was: &quot;Despite a terrific soundtrack and a strong early performance from Renee Zellweger, &quot;Empire Records&quot; is mostly a silly and predictable teen dramedy.&quot;

===1996–2000: Breakthrough===
Zellweger came to wider recognition through her role in &quot;Jerry Maguire&quot; (1996), playing a single mother and the romantic interest of a glossy sports agent (Tom Cruise). The film grossed over US$273 million worldwide. It was Cruise who chose her to play his love interest and later credited her with &quot;revealing the core humanity of the movie&quot;. Roger Ebert, acknowledging Zellweger&#x27;s and Cruise&#x27;s chemistry, wrote: &quot;The film is often a delight, especially when Cruise and Zellweger are together on the screen. He plays Maguire with the earnestness of a man who wants to find greatness and happiness in an occupation where only success really counts. She plays a woman who believes in this guy she loves, and reminds us that true love is about idealism.&quot; For her performance, Zellweger was nominated for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Supporting Role.

In the religious drama &quot;A Price Above Rubies&quot; (1998), Zellweger starred as a young woman who finds it difficult to conform to the restrictions imposed on her by the community. The film flopped at the box office, but Zellweger was applauded by some critics such as Ebert, who wrote that she gave a &quot;ferociously strong performance&quot;. That same year, she also starred in the drama &quot;One True Thing&quot;, opposite William Hurt and Meryl Streep. She played a woman, based on author Anna Quindlen, forced to put her life on hold in order to care for her mother, who is dying of cancer. &quot;One True Thing&quot; took in a modest US$23 million in the US, but had a favorable critical response; &quot;Variety&quot; magazine&#x27;s Todd McCarthy stated about Zellweger, &quot;Projecting gravity and impatience that she hasn&#x27;t shown before, Zellweger is outstanding as the smart young woman who resents the interruption to her life&#x27;s momentum but ends up growing in ways she never would have expected.&quot;

After playing the female lead opposite Chris O&#x27;Donnell in the little-seen romantic comedy &quot;The Bachelor&quot; (1999), Zellweger starred in the Farrelly brothers comedy &quot;Me, Myself &amp; Irene&quot; (2000), with Jim Carrey, as a woman on the run for what she believes is a false accusation set up by her mob-connected ex-boyfriend. It was a commercial success, grossing US$149 million worldwide.

In the black comedy &quot;Nurse Betty&quot; (2000), directed by Neil LaBute and starring Morgan Freeman, Zellweger played a Kansas waitress who suffers a nervous breakdown after witnessing her husband&#x27;s murder. &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; found the actress to be &quot;a performer who emanates kindness and a pure heart&quot;, and &quot;Variety&quot; remarked: &quot;Few actresses can convey the kind of honesty and humanity that Zellweger does here — it&#x27;s hard to imagine the film without her dominant, thoroughly credible performance&quot;. She won her first Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy, but she was in the bathroom when future co-star Hugh Grant announced her name. She later protested: &quot;I had lipstick on my teeth!&quot;

===2001–2007: Bridget Jones and worldwide recognition===
In 2001, Zellweger gained the prized lead role of Bridget Jones, opposite Hugh Grant and Colin Firth, in the British romantic comedy &quot;Bridget Jones&#x27;s Diary&quot;, based on the 1996 novel of the same name by Helen Fielding. The casting of Zellweger came amid much controversy since she was neither British nor plump, and did not smoke. During casting, Zellweger was told she was too thin to play the cherubic, chain-smoking Bridget, so she quickly embarked on gaining the required weight (20 pounds) and learning to speak in an English accent while she smoked herbal cigarettes. In addition to receiving dialect coaching to fine-tune her accent, part of Zellweger&#x27;s preparations involved spending three weeks working undercover in a &quot;work experience placement&quot; for British publishing firm Picador in Victoria, London. Her portrayal of Jones led Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; to comment, &quot;Ms. Zellweger accomplishes the small miracle of making Bridget both entirely endearing and utterly real.&quot; The role earned her a second Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actress – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy, and her first Academy Award and BAFTA Award nominations for Best Leading Actress. &quot;Bridget Jones&#x27;s Diary&quot; was a major commercial success, earning US$281 million worldwide.

Zellweger took on the role of a former actress serving as a foster mother, alongside Michelle Pfeiffer, in the drama &quot;White Oleander&quot; (2002), for which she received a Satellite Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress – Drama. She also portrayed Roxie Hart in the 2002 musical film &quot;Chicago&quot;, directed by Rob Marshall and co-starring Catherine Zeta-Jones, Richard Gere, Queen Latifah, and John C. Reilly. The film won Best Picture at the 75th Academy Awards. Writing for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, Tim Robey labeled &quot;Chicago&quot; the &quot;best screen musical [since 1972&#x27;s &quot;Cabaret&quot;]&quot;, and the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; commented, &quot;Zellweger is a joy to watch, with marvelous comic timing and, in her stage numbers, a commanding presence&quot;. She earned her second Academy Award and BAFTA Award nominations for Best Leading Actress, winning her second Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy and the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role.

In 2003, following the success of &quot;Chicago&quot;, Zellweger starred with Ewan McGregor in the little-seen romantic comedy &quot;Down with Love&quot;, as a woman advocating female independence in the 1950s and early 1960s, and appeared in Anthony Minghella&#x27;s war drama &quot;Cold Mountain&quot;, opposite Nicole Kidman and Jude Law, playing a woman who helps a farmer following her father&#x27;s death. The film garnered several award nominations and wins for its actors; Zellweger won the award for Best Supporting Actress at the 76th Academy Awards, the 61st Golden Globe Awards, the 10th Screen Actors Guild Awards, and the 57th British Academy Film Awards.

In 2004, Zellweger provided her voice for the DreamWorks Animation film &quot;Shark Tale&quot;, and reprised her title role in &quot;Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason&quot;, which made US$262 million around the globe and earned her a fourth Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy nomination. In 2005, she played the wife of world heavyweight boxing champion James J. Braddock in Ron Howard&#x27;s drama &quot;Cinderella Man&quot;, opposite Russell Crowe and Paul Giamatti. In his review for the film, David Ansen of &quot;Newsweek&quot;, wrote that the actress &quot;has an uncanny ability to make us swallow even the most movie-ish moments&quot;. On May 24, 2005, Zellweger received a landmark star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for her contributions to the motion picture industry.

Zellweger portrayed author Beatrix Potter in the biographical comedy &quot;Miss Potter&quot;, with Emily Watson and Ewan McGregor. She also served as an executive producer as she wanted to get more involved in the production. William Arnold of &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot; concluded that Zellweger &quot;strikes just the right chord of inspiration, eccentricity and uncompromising artistic drive.&quot; For her portrayal, she earned her sixth nomination for the Golden Globe Award (and her fifth one in the category of Best Actress – Musical or Comedy). In 2007, Zellweger lent her voice to the animated family comedy &quot;Bee Movie&quot; and was awarded the Women in Film Crystal award.

===2008–2014: Career fluctuations and hiatus===
With George Clooney in his directorial venture, the period comedy &quot;Leatherheads&quot; (2008), about the early years of professional American football, Zellweger portrayed a &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; newspaper reporter. The film received largely mixed reviews and made US$13.5 million in its opening weekend, described as &quot;disappointing&quot; by website Box Office Mojo. &quot;MTV.com&quot; praised the actress for &quot;displaying an unexpected gift for drawling sarcasm&quot;, but Kevin Williamson for website &quot;Jam!&quot; criticized her role, remarking that she, &quot;as the kind of lippy heroine epitomized by Rosalind Russell, is miscast in a role that demands snark, not sleepy-eyed sweetness&quot;. In the western &quot;Appaloosa&quot; (2008), Zellweger played a beguiling widow opposite Ed Harris and Viggo Mortensen. The film grossed US$20 million at the North American box office. Zellweger produced the made-for-television feature &quot;Living Proof&quot;, starring Harry Connick Jr., about the true story of Denny Slamon. It was co-produced by Craig Zadan and Neil Meron, and premiered in October 2008 on Lifetime Television.

Her next film was the 2009 comedy &quot;New in Town&quot;, in which she played a Miami high-powered consultant adjusting to her new life in a small Minnesota town. The movie rated poorly with reviewers and made a lackluster US$16 million in its domestic theatrical run. Peter Bradshaw of &quot;The Guardian&quot; stated that her &quot;rabbity, dimply pout – surely the strangest facial expression in Hollywood – simpers and twitches out of the screen in this moderate girly flick that adheres with almost religious fanaticism to the feelgood romcom handbook&quot;. In 2009, she also provided her voice for a supporting character in DreamWorks&#x27; animated film &quot;Monsters vs. Aliens&quot;, and starred as the mother of actor George Hamilton in the comedy &quot;My One and Only&quot;, which despite being distributed for a limited release to certain parts of the United States only. Bill Gray, of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; felt that she played her part &quot;to her strengths&quot;, and reviewer Mick LaSalle found her performance to be a &quot;standout&quot;.

Zellweger took on the role of a social worker assigned to a mysterious girl in &quot;Case 39&quot;, a supernatural thriller she had filmed in 2006. The title had a lengthy post-production and was not released in theaters in the United States until 2010. It was universally panned by critics and only earned US$5.3 million in its opening weekend, leading &quot;Indiewire&quot; to write that Zellweger &quot;faces an [u]ncertain [f]uture&quot; as she was in &quot;an unforgiving industry that doles out few juicy roles for women over 40.&quot; The road drama &quot;My Own Love Song&quot;, in which she played a former singer suffering from paralysis, was screened at the 2010 Tribeca Film Festival, and released for DVD.

After &quot;My Own Love Song&quot; was released, Zellweger took a four-year hiatus from screen acting, as she found the time to &quot;go away and grow up a bit&quot;. Reflecting on this period of time in a July 2016 interview with British &quot;Vogue&quot;, she explained: &quot;I was fatigued and wasn&#x27;t taking the time I needed to recover between projects, and it caught up with me [...] I got sick of the sound of my own voice&quot;. In 2013, Zellweger co-created and executive produced &quot;Cinnamon Girl&quot;, an original drama series set in the Hollywood movie and music scenes of the late 1960s and early 1970s, but the Lifetime network passed on the pilot. That same year, she was considered for a supporting role in the film &quot;&quot; alongside Andrea Riseborough but the role ultimately went to Juliette Lewis.

===2014–present: Resurgence and &quot;Judy&quot;===
Following a four-year hiatus from acting, Zellweger took on the pivotal role of &quot;Loretta Lassiter,&quot; an abused, yet devious wife. She plays the mother of a teenage son who is accused of murdering his wealthy father in a courtroom crime drama, &quot;The Whole Truth&quot; directed by Courtney Hunt and with Keanu Reeves ostensibly playing her son&#x27;s defence lawyer. Principal photography of the film, which is set in New Orleans, commenced in July 2014, the film was released following extensive post production, in the US during 2016. 

Zellweger made her trilogy comeback, opposite Colin Firth and Patrick Dempsey in the romantic comedy &quot;Bridget Jones&#x27;s Baby&quot; (2016), the third &quot;Bridget Jones&quot; franchise, portraying Jones as single and in her forties discovering that she is pregnant and must figure out, exactly who the father is. The film was met with a positive response by critics and grossed US$211.9 million worldwide. &quot;Village Voice&quot; found the movie to be &quot;the warmest and most satisfying of the series&quot; and concluded that Zellweger&#x27;s &quot;wise, light-hearted performance anchors this happy reunion, a surprising and refreshing gift from a creative well that seemed to have run dry&quot;.

In &quot;Same Kind of Different as Me&quot; (2017), a film adaptation of the autobiographical book by the same name, Zellweger starred with Djimon Hounsou, Olivia Holt and Jon Voight, as the wife of an art dealer whose struggling relationship is changed for the better by a homeless man. The film received mixed reviews from critics and was a moderate commercial success. &quot;The Wrap&quot;, nevertheless, remarked: &quot;Zellweger, in fact, delivers a gentle, thoughtful, yet headstrong performance as the wife who digs in her heels to get human decency out of the people she cares for the most&quot;. She played the friend of a New York City singer who gets a life-changing medical diagnosis in the independent drama &quot;Here and Now&quot; (2018), opposite Sarah Jessica Parker. Dana Schwartz of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; praised the appearance of Zellweger, describing the film as &quot;heightened by the magnetic Renée Zellweger, barely concealing her suburban rage behind a cheerfully swirled glass of wine.&quot;

Zellweger obtained her first major television role when she was cast as Anne Montgomery, a mysterious venture capitalist, in the Netflix thriller miniseries &quot;What/If&quot; (2019). Although the show received mixed reviews from critics, Zellweger&#x27;s performance was praised, with Haider Rifaat of &quot;The Express Tribune&quot; writing, &quot;Not to forgo the incredible acting prowess of Zellweger, who impeccably embraces the character of Anne. Subtle gestures, symbolic interaction and character development are some commendable aspects that intensify the actors&#x27; performances.&quot;

Her next role was that of Judy Garland in 2019&#x27;s biographical drama &quot;Judy&quot;. Based on the West End and Broadway play &quot;End of the Rainbow&quot;, the film chronicles the last years of Garland&#x27;s life, shortly before her death in 1969. Zellweger performed her own vocals in the film and her songs had to be performed in front of a live audience. &quot;Judy&quot; premiered to positive reviews at the Telluride Film Festival, and certain critics considered it to be the finest performance of her career. It also screened at the Toronto International Film Festival on 10 September 2019. Zoe Gahan of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; found her &quot;witty, sharp and devastating in the title role&quot; and added that &quot;it is hard to tell where Garland stops and Zellweger starts&quot;. Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; opined, &quot;Zellweger performs miracles playing Judy Garland: singing her heart out, baring her bruised soul and acting with a ferocity that ultimately rises to a state of grace.&quot; For her portrayal of Garland, Zellweger won numerous awards and accolades, including the Golden Globe Award, Screen Actors Guild Award, BAFTA Award and Academy Award. Zellweger&#x27;s win made her just the seventh actress to win an Oscar in both acting categories and the fourth to win Best Actress after Best Supporting Actress. The film&#x27;s soundtrack additionally earned her a Grammy Award nomination for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album.

Two and a half years later, in 2022, Zellweger took on her first starring role in network television in the NBC crime drama miniseries &quot;The Thing About Pam&quot;. She starred as Pam Hupp, who was involved in the 2011 murder of Betsy Faria. The part required her to wear face and body prosthetics, which took 80 minutes to apply. The series and her performance received mixed reviews from critics. &quot;IndieWire&quot;″s Ben Travers called her performance &quot;exaggerated&quot;, while John Doyle of &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; said that she &quot;brings an equal amount of vinegary exuberance to the work&quot;.

Zellweger played Jones again in the sequel &quot;Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy&quot;, which released in 2025.

==Public image==

Zellweger has appeared on the covers and photo shoots of several magazines throughout her career; she appeared on the September 1997 cover of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, and in subsequent years, the list has grown to include &quot;Vogue&quot;, &quot;Detour&quot;, &quot;Allure&quot; and &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;. Zellweger often draws attention for her style at award ceremonies and red carpet events, specifically for her frequent use of dresses designed by Carolina Herrera, a close friend who has worked with the actress for over fifteen years after they met at a Costume Institute gala. She is also a frequent attendee at New York Fashion Week, among other fashion events.

In April 1997, &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; named her part of &quot;Hollywood&#x27;s Next Wave of Stars&quot;. She was placed on E!&#x27;s &quot;Top 20 Entertainers of 2001&quot; list and was chosen by &quot;People&quot; magazine as one of the 50 most beautiful people in the world in 2003. She also ranked number 72 in the &quot;Top 100 Celebrities&quot; list made by &quot;Forbes&quot; in 2006, and the following year, she was placed at 20 among &quot;the 20 richest women in entertainment&quot;, by the magazine.

Following her performance on &quot;Jerry Maguire&quot;, Israeli singer songwriter Ariel Horowitz wrote, composed and performed a song called &quot;Renee&quot; in 2001, after watching the film. Horowitz said he was stunned by her performance. The song tells the fantasy in which he meets Zellweger, they fall in love and return to live in Israel, and she becomes a local movie star.

After Zellweger attended the 21st annual &quot;Elle&quot; Women in Hollywood Awards in October 2014, there was media and social commentary that she was hardly recognizable, which prompted speculation that she had undergone cosmetic surgery. Zellweger responded, &quot;Perhaps I look different. Who doesn&#x27;t as they get older?! Ha. But I am different. I&#x27;m happy.&quot;

==Personal life==
From 1999 to 2000, Zellweger was engaged to Jim Carrey. In 2003, she had a brief relationship with musician Jack White. In May 2005, Zellweger married singer Kenny Chesney. Four months later, Zellweger obtained an annulment.

Zellweger took part in the 2005 HIV prevention campaign of the Swiss federal health department.

Zellweger is one of the patrons for gender equality foundation The GREAT Initiative; in 2011 she visited Liberia with the charity. In April 2011, she collaborated with Tommy Hilfiger to design a handbag to raise money and awareness for the Breast Health Institute. &quot;Because of the experiences of close friends and family members who have had to endure and battle the challenges of breast cancer, I am a passionate supporter of breast health education and charitable causes&quot;, Zellweger stated about joining the campaign.

==Awards and nominations==

Among her numerous accolades for her acting work, Zellweger has received two Academy Awards, two BAFTA Awards, four Critics&#x27; Choice Movie Awards, four Golden Globe Awards, an Independent Spirit Awards, four Screen Actors Guild Awards, a British Independent Film Awards, and awards from the London Film Critics Circle, National Board of Review, National Society of Film Critics, New York Film Critics Circle, and Santa Barbara International Film Festival.

<text>Jules Hardouin-Mansart (; 16 April 1646 – 11 May 1708) was a French Baroque architect and builder whose major work included the Place des Victoires (1684–1690); Place Vendôme (1690); the domed chapel of Les Invalides (1690), and the Grand Trianon of the Palace of Versailles. His monumental work was designed to glorify the reign of Louis XIV of France.

==Biography==
Born Jules Hardouin in Paris in 1646, he studied under his renowned great-uncle François Mansart, one of the originators of the classical tradition in French architecture; Hardouin inherited Mansart&#x27;s collection of plans and drawings and added Mansart&#x27;s name to his own in 1668. He began his career as an entrepreneur in building construction, in partnership with his brother Michel, but then decided in 1672 to devote himself entirely to architecture. In 1674, he became one of the group of royal architects working for Louis XIV. His first important project was the Château de Clagny, built for the King&#x27;s consort, Madame de Montespan. He quickly showed he was a master of bureaucratic diplomacy as well as design and construction; he gained the protection and support of Madame de Montespan, then François-Michel le Tellier, Marquis de Louvois, the Minister of War. He studied under and then collaborated with landscape designer André Le Nôtre, before finally working directly with the King himself.

In 1677, he began working on the expansion of the royal Palace of Versailles, a project which occupied him for the rest of his life. Soon afterward became a member of the Académie royale d&#x27;architecture. In 1678, he became director of the work at Versailles. and the most prominent architect in the royal entourage. He was named First Architect of the King in 1681 and was raised to the nobility in 1682. He became intendant of the King in 1685, and royal inspector-general of buildings 1691, under the elderly superintendent of buildings, Villacerf, whom he finally replaced in 1699.

He owed his rise not just for his ability to please his patron with his designs, but especially because of his ability to manage enormous and complex projects with many elements and designers. He would sketch out an idea; stand back and intervene and adjust when needed, from time to time to visit the site, and to see that the budget was kept under control. 

In the latter part of his career he left more of the details to the architects who worked under him, notably Robert de Cotte, who was his chosen successor. He was given the title of Count of Sagonne in 1702, but died six months later at the royal Château de Marly.

==Style==
Hardouin-Mansart was the leading master of the architectural style that became known as the Louis XIV style or French classicism. A particular skill of Hardouin was his ability to create a wide variety of structures; chateaux, churches, pavilions, private residences, parks, and urban squares. He demonstrated an ability to adapt, modify, enlarge and rehabilitate, without losing the character of the original building, but adding his own original variations on the theme, as he demonstrated in particular at the Palace of Versailles.

Much of his success was due to his ability to select and guide very talented collaborators. his collaborators included the interior designer Charles Le Brun, who designed many of the interiors of Versailles, in perfect harmony with his architecture, and Robert de Cotte, a designer who also became his brother-in-law and in 1708 became his successor, completing the major projects he had begun in the Palace of Versailles.

His architecture is especially characterized by simplification; by large smooth spaces, the repetition of forms (especially arcades with semicircular arches and detached columns; long horizontals, and detached open spaces. He often used long rows of columns in front of a façade to give an air of grandeur and to hide the irregularities of the structure. He used the architectural orders to give a special majesty to interior surfaces, particularly in the chapel of Versailles, and the interiors of the Palace of Versailles and the Grand Trianon. 

He was adept at creating a sense of awe, as he demonstrated especially in the dome of Les Invalides (completed 1706) and in the garden façade of the Palace of Versailles, and in the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles.

==Major works==
===Les Invalides===

On March 1, 1676, François-Michel le Tellier, Marquis de Louvois, the Minister of War, summoned Hardouin-Mansart to take over construction of Les Invalides, the enormous hospital and chapel the King was building in the center of Paris for his pensioned and wounded soldiers. The project had been begun in 1671 by Libéral Bruant, and some of the residential buildings were completed and already occupied, but the centerpiece, the chapel for the soldiers, had not been begun. The King was not satisfied with the plans that were offered to him by Bruant, and complained about the slowness of the work. On March 1, 1676, Louvois dismissed Bruant and summoned Hardouin-Mansart, who was little known outside the royal household, and asked him to take over the church. 

The chapel originally planned by Bruant for the veterans was relatively modest in size and decoration. Hardouin-Mansart proposed a much more grandiose project with two adjoining parts; a choir for the pensioners, and a majestic domed royal church for the King. This was beyond what the Minister had proposed, but it apparently pleased the King, and, after long discussion, Hardouin-Mansart was given the project not only for the church, but for the Hôtel as well. Hardouin-Mansart briskly organized and completed the construction of residences and infirmaries for the pensioners. In 1676 he began work on the choir, the portion of the church intended for the pensioners. By the summer of 1677 the roof was in place, and in April 1678 he was able to order the woodwork of the stalls, and in 1679, the cabinetry for the organ. 

The work on the royal chapel proceeded more slowly. Its distinctive feature was the dome, one of the earliest constructed in Paris, following the church of the Val-de-Grâce, designed by his great-uncle, and (1645–1667), and the Collège des Quatre-Nations (1662–1670). His original plan called for a single great space under the dome, and painted decoration on the interior of the dome. However, while the work was in progress, the French army suffered reverses in the Netherlands, and the Superintendent of Finances, Colbert, was slow in providing funding. Hardouin-Mansart had to modify the original plan, eliminating the painted ceiling, and redesigning the dome with an interior dome, not visible from the outside. He mounted the dome on two successive drums, giving it greater height than the earlier Paris domes. He commissioned the sculptor François Girardon to make statues illustrating the themes of the building, the virtues of the Saints and the French Kings. By 1690 a large group of sculptors was at work at statues for the niches of the façade. The war was followed by a financial crisis; work was halted entirely in 1695, and did not resume until the war ended in 1699. Once the war ended, constructed resumed, and the royal chapel was finally consecrated, in the presence of the King, on 22 August 1706, not long before the death of Hardouin-Mansart. It remains his most famous work. 

===The Palace of Versailles===

From 1677 until his death, Hardouin-Mansart was responsible for the design and construction of much of the Palace of Versailles of Louis XIV. He succeeded the royal architect Louis Le Vau and became the &quot;surintendant des Bâtiments du Roi&quot; (Superintendent of royal buildings). Beginning in 1678, he completed the &quot;envelope&quot; of new buildings surrounding the original Château by Louis XIII, which had been begun by his predecessor, Louis Le Vau. He transformed the first-floor terrace of the Palace overlooking the garden, into the celebrated Hall of Mirrors, richly decorated by his collaborator, the artist Charles Le Brun. He also reconstructed the façade of the first floor facing the marble courtyard, giving it large arched windows and bringing in more light, and added new central residential wing, also with larger windows, for the royal family. To house the growing number of staff and servants in the Château, he built the Grand Commun (1682–85), and for the horses and carriages of the royal household constructed two palatial stables on the city-side of the Palace (finished in 1682).

His later additions to the Palace included the Orangerie (1684–86), halfway underground at the end of south wing, accessed by two monumental stairways and opening onto its own sunken garden. Toward the end of his life he built a separate smaller one-story palace, the Grand Trianon (1687) as a refuge for the King from the noise and ceremony of the court. His final project at Versilles was the chapel (1699–1710), which was carefully integrated into the architecture of the south wing. 

===Royal Squares===

Hardouin-Mansard was also an important urban designer, the creator of two notable Paris residential squares. Both squares, the Place des Victoires (1685) and Place Vendôme (1699), were designed, like his other architecture, to express the majesty and glory of Louis XIV. The Place des Victoires was built as a setting for a monument to Louis XIV, surrounded by a circle of harmonious matching residential buildings. The original statue was melted down after the Revolution, and replaced later by a copy; while the square was much altered in later years, with the addition of traverse streets and buildings in a different style. 

The later Place Vendôme was a larger square, but Hardouin-Mansard broke the rigid box shape with corner buildings facing inward, decorated with ornamental pediments. 

===Châteaux===
His most prominent position in France put him in place to create many of the significant monuments of the period, and to set the tone for the restrained French Late Baroque architectural style, somewhat chastened by academic detailing, that was influential as far as Saint Petersburg and even echoed in Constantinople. At the same time, the size of support staff in his official bureaucratic position has often raised criticisms that he was less than directly responsible for the work that was constructed under his name, criticisms that underestimate the discipline control within a large, classically trained studio.

Hardouin-Mansart used the mansard roof (&quot;mansarde&quot;), named for his great-uncle François Mansart, at the château of Dampierre-en-Yvelines, built for the duc de Chevreuse, Jean-Baptiste Colbert&#x27;s son-in-law, a patron at the center of Louis XIV&#x27;s court. This French Baroque château of manageable size lies &quot;entre cour et jardin&quot; as even Versailles did, the paved and gravel forecourt (&quot;cour d&#x27;honneur&quot;) protected behind fine wrought iron double gates, and enclosed by the main block and its outbuildings (&quot;corps de logis&quot;), linked by balustrades, symmetrically disposed. A traditional French touch is the modest pedimented entrance flanked by boldly projecting pavilions. Behind, the central axis is extended between the former parterres, now grass. The park with formally shaped water was laid out by André Le Nôtre. There are sumptuous interiors. The small scale makes it easier to compare to the approximately contemporary Het Loo (Netherlands), for William III of Orange.

He died at Marly-le-Roi in 1708.

<text>Gregory Blaxland (17 June 1778 – 1 January 1853) was an English pioneer farmer and explorer in Australia, noted especially for initiating and co-leading the first successful crossing of the Blue Mountains by European settlers.

== Early life ==

Gregory Blaxland was born 17 June 1778 at Fordwich, Kent, England, the fourth son of John Blaxland, mayor from 1767 to 1774, whose family had owned estates nearby for generations, and Mary, daughter of Captain Parker, R.N. Gregory attended The King&#x27;s School, Canterbury. In July 1799 in the church of St George the Martyr there, he married 20-year-old Elizabeth, daughter of John Spurdon; they had five sons and two daughters.

The Blaxlands were friends of Sir Joseph Banks who appears to have strongly influenced the decision of Gregory and his eldest brother, John, to emigrate to Australia. The government promised them land, convict servants and free passages, in accord with its policy of encouraging &#x27;settlers of responsibility and capital&#x27;. Leaving John to sell their Kent estates, Gregory sailed in the &quot;William Pitt&quot; on 1 September 1805 with his wife, the three children they then had, two servants, an overseer, a few sheep, seed, bees, tools, groceries and clothing.

Blaxland and his family reached Sydney on 1 April 1806, where he sold many of the goods he brought with him very profitably, bought eighty head of cattle so as to enter the meat trade, located of land at St Marys and was promised forty convict servants. Soon afterwards he also bought at the Brush Farm (near Eastwood) from D&#x27;Arcy Wentworth for £1500, while also displaying some of his future characteristics by commencing litigation against the master of the &quot;William Pitt&quot;. A further parcel of was granted for a farm at the South Creek.

== Blue Mountains expedition ==
Early in 1813 Blaxland, who needed more grazing land, obtained the approval of Governor Lachlan Macquarie for an attempt to cross the Great Dividing Range, known as the Blue Mountains, following the mountain ridges, instead of following the rivers and valleys. He secured the participation of William Lawson and William Charles Wentworth in the expedition, which was successful (though the expedition stopped short of actually crossing over the mountains) and enabled the settlers to access and use the land west of the mountains for farming. The crossing took 21 days, and only 6 days to return.

In February 1823 Blaxland published his &quot;Journal of a Tour of Discovery Across the Blue Mountains&quot; (London, 1823) in which he wrote:
:&quot;On Tuesday, May 11, 1813, Mr. Gregory Blaxland, Mr. William Wentworth, and Lieutenant Lawson, attended by four servants, with five dogs, and four horses laden with provisions, ammunition, and other necessaries, left Mr. Blaxland&#x27;s farm at the South Creek, for the purpose of endeavouring to effect a passage over the Blue Mountains ...&quot;

In recognition of the successful crossing, all three explorers were granted by Macquarie of land west of the mountains.

==Other activities==
Blaxland is also noted as one of the first settlers to plant grapes for wine-making purposes. He was engaged during the next few years in wine-making. He had brought vines from the Cape of Good Hope and found a species resistant to blight.

Blaxland&#x27;s diaries show that he had a clear grasp of the scale upon which agricultural and pastoral activities would be profitable in Australia. In 1814, like many others almost insolvent because of drought and depression, he tried to persuade Governor Macquarie to sanction a scheme for the exploitation of the interior by a large agricultural company similar to the later Australian Agricultural Company of the 1820s. Macquarie would not agree nor would he allow Blaxland land in the interior for his own flocks. Blaxland then had to dispose of his livestock, and joined the colonial opposition to Macquarie, and in 1819 sharply criticised his administration to Commissioner John Thomas Bigge.

Blaxland visited England in 1822 taking with him a sample of his wine. While in England he published in February 1823 his &quot;Journal of a Tour of Discovery Across the Blue Mountains&quot;. Later the same year, Blaxland was awarded the silver medal of the Royal Society of Arts for the wine he had brought to London.

== Later years ==
His wife died in December 1826. In January 1827 Blaxland was elected by a public meeting with two others to present a petition to Governor Darling asking that &quot;Trial by jury&quot; and &quot;Taxation by Representation&quot; should be extended to the colony. Still opposed to the governor&#x27;s authority, he made another visit to England, taking a petition in support of trial by jury and some form of representative government, and again carried samples of his wine, for which he won a gold medal of the Royal Society of Arts in 1828.

He successfully petitioned the Colonial Office for a drawback on the import duty on brandy imported into the colony and &#x27;actually used in the manufacture of wine&#x27;. Always a man of moody and mercurial character, Blaxland devoted his colonial activities almost entirely to the pursuit of his agricultural and viticultural interests.

He suffered great personal loss with the early and untimely deaths of his second son, youngest son and wife along with others quite close to him in rapid succession, which bore very heavily on his heart. He committed suicide on 1 January 1853 in New South Wales and was buried in All Saints Cemetery in Parramatta.

His son John was a prominent businessman. He was appointed to the New South Wales Legislative Council and served there from 1863 until his death in 1884.

<text>Matthew Nathan Drudge (born October 27, 1966) is an American journalist and the creator/editor of the Drudge Report, an American news aggregator. Drudge is also an author and a former radio and television show host.

==Early life and education==
Drudge was raised in Takoma Park, Maryland, near Washington, D.C. His father, Robert Drudge, a former social worker, and his mother divorced when he was six. Drudge went to live with his mother. He had few friends and was an avid news reader and radio talk show fan. Drudge graduated 341st out of a high school class of 355. In his book &quot;Drudge Manifesto&quot;, Drudge says that he &quot;failed his Bar Mitzvah&quot;.

== Career ==

=== Drudge Report ===

Drudge was unknown before he began the news aggregation site, the Drudge Report. For many years, he took odd jobs such as night counterman at a 7-Eleven convenience store, telemarketer for Time-Life books, McDonald&#x27;s manager, and sales assistant at a New York City grocery store. In 1989, he moved to Los Angeles, where he took up residence in a small Hollywood apartment. He took a job in the gift shop of CBS studios, eventually working his way up to manager. Here, he was apparently privy to some inside gossip, part of the inspiration for founding the Drudge Report. Worried about his son&#x27;s aimlessness, Drudge&#x27;s father insisted on buying him a Packard Bell computer in 1994. The Drudge Report began as email notes sent out to a few friends.

The original issues were part gossip and part opinion. They were distributed as an email newsletter and posted to alt.showbiz.gossip Usenet forum. In 1996, the newsletter transitioned slowly from entertainment gossip to political gossip and moved from email to the Web as its primary distribution mechanism.

In March 1995, the Drudge Report had 1,000 email subscribers; by 1997, Drudge had 85,000 subscribers to his email service. Drudge&#x27;s website gained in popularity in the late 1990s when he reported a number of stories before the mainstream media. Drudge first received national attention in 1996 when he broke the news that Jack Kemp would be Republican Bob Dole&#x27;s running mate in the 1996 presidential election. In 1998, he gained popularity when he published the reporting of then-&quot;Newsweek&quot; reporter Michael Isikoff, becoming the first media outlet to publish the news that later became the Clinton–Lewinsky scandal.

Drudge met Andrew Breitbart in Los Angeles during the 1990s and became his mentor, with Breitbart later helping to run the Drudge Report. Breitbart announced in 2005 that he was &quot;amicably leaving the Drudge Report after a long and close working relationship with Matt Drudge&quot;, but still helped run Drudge&#x27;s website from Los Angeles by working the afternoon shift, in addition to running &quot;Breitbart&quot;.

A story by &quot;Business 2.0&quot; magazine from April 2003 estimated that Drudge&#x27;s website received $3,500 a day (almost $1.3 million a year) in advertising revenues. Subtracting his relatively minor server costs, the magazine estimated that the Drudge Report website netted $800,000 a year. An article in &quot;The Miami Herald&quot; from September 2003 said that Drudge estimated he earns $1.2 million a year from his website and radio show. During an April 30, 2004 appearance on C-SPAN, he confirmed that he earns over $1 million.

For many years, Drudge was based out of his one-bedroom apartment in Hollywood. Today, he maintains the website from his two properties in Miami, Florida. In updating the site, he reportedly monitors multiple television news channels and a number of websites on several computers in his home office.

=== Fox News television show ===
From June 1998 to November 1999, Drudge hosted a Saturday night television show called &quot;Drudge&quot; on the Fox News Channel. The show ended by mutual agreement. Drudge had refused to go on air, charging Fox News with censorship when the network prevented him from showing photos of surgery on Samuel Armas. Drudge, who opposes abortion, wanted to use a picture of a tiny hand reaching out from the womb to dramatize his argument against late-term abortion, but Fox&#x27;s John Moody decided that that would be misleading because the photo was not of an abortion but an emergency operation on the fetus for spina bifida. Fox News alleged breach of contract but, after Drudge issued an apology, Fox issued a statement calling the parting &quot;amicable&quot;.

=== Radio talk show ===
Drudge hosted a Sunday night talk radio show – &quot;the only time anyone will let me on the air&quot;, he quipped. The show, which was also named the Drudge Report, was syndicated by Premiere Radio Networks. He guest hosted for the conservative radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh. Drudge gained notice in the early 2000s by becoming a frequent reference for news material on Limbaugh&#x27;s, Sean Hannity&#x27;s, and Mark Levin&#x27;s radio shows. He was often acknowledged by Michael Savage as a source of topics for &quot;The Savage Nation&quot;. Lynn Samuels, for a time, served as Drudge&#x27;s call screener.

Drudge left his position as radio host with Premiere effective September 30, 2007. He was replaced by Cincinnati radio station WLW&#x27;s Bill Cunningham on the network and in most markets, though in a few larger markets, John Batchelor replaced him instead.

===Books===
&quot;The Drudge Revolution: The Inside Story of How Talk Radio, Fox News, and a Gift Shop Clerk with an Internet Connection Took Down the Mainstream Media&quot; was published on July 28, 2020. The book&#x27;s author, Matthew Lysiak, interviewed over 200 former friends and associates, including former Drudge Report editor Joseph Curl.

Drudge wrote a book with Julia Phillips in 2000 titled &quot;Drudge Manifesto&quot;, which reached the &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller list. The book features a transcript of a Q&amp;A session conducted at the National Press Club on June 2, 1998, which lays out Drudge&#x27;s &quot;&quot;. It also contains copies of emails sent to Drudge by his readers, transcripts of Drudge talking to his cat, and extensive descriptions of parties Drudge has attended and how the celebrities there reacted to him. A review in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; said: &quot;Indeed, while Drudge Manifesto runs 247 pages ... Which leaves, in the end, 112 pages of new material, including nine pages of poetry.&quot; A review from the &quot;Columbia Journalism Review&quot; stated: &quot;By any standard, Drudge&#x27;s book is padded&quot;, and: &quot;It is a weird, stream-of-conscious mixture of telling readers how he got his stories and mocking his critics.&quot;

==Influence==
In 2024, Drudge was named Mediaite’s Most Influential in News Media. Mediaite stated, “Drudge will remain a dominant player – and potentially painful thorn in Trump’s side – for the next four years.&quot;

In the 2020 book &quot;Drudge Revolution&quot;, author Matthew Lysiak describes how every major presidential campaign dating back to the late 90s had a staffer whose responsibility was to make a connection and potentially influence Drudge. Ahead of the 2008 Democratic primaries, Hillary Clinton communication director Tracy Sefl befriended Drudge, a relationship which she describes in the book as &quot;scary&quot; due to the power of the Drudge Report.

In their 2006 book &quot;The Way to Win&quot;, Mark Halperin and John Harris report that Republican National Convention chairman Ken Mehlman &quot;kind of brags&quot; (as then-CNN host Howard Kurtz put it) about utilizing the Drudge channel. They also wrote that &quot;Drudge, with his droll Dickensian name, was not the only media or political agent whose actions led to John Kerry&#x27;s defeat. But his role placed him at the center of the game.&quot;

In 2006, &quot;Time&quot; named Drudge one of the 100 most influential people in the world, describing the Drudge Report as &quot;a ludicrous combination of gossip, political intrigue and extreme weather reports ... still put together mostly by the guy who started out as a convenience-store clerk.&quot;

ABC News concluded that the Drudge Report sets the tone for national political coverage. The article says &quot;Republican operatives keep an open line to Drudge, often using him to attack their opponents.&quot;

In October 2006, &quot;Washington Post&quot; editor Len Downie, speaking at the Online News Association&#x27;s annual convention in Washington, D.C., said, &quot;Our largest driver of traffic is Matt Drudge.&quot;

On October 22, 2007, &quot;New York Times&quot; reporter Jim Rutenberg wrote that Republican and Democratic presidential candidates, including Hillary Clinton, were cooperating with Drudge and &quot;working harder than ever to get favorable coverage for their candidates – or unfavorable coverage of competitors – onto the Drudge Report&#x27;s home page, knowing that television producers, radio talk show hosts and newspaper reporters view it as a bulletin board for the latest news and gossip.&quot; Rutenberg stated that Nielsen/NetRatings show that the Drudge Report gets three million unique visitors over the course of a month, or approximately one percent of the population of the United States.

During the 2012 Republican presidential primaries, Drudge was described by some, including former presidential candidate Fred Thompson, as having a pro-Mitt Romney slant.

==Personal life==
Drudge previously lived in Hollywood, California. As of 2007, he owned two properties in Miami, Florida – a $1.4 million Mediterranean-style stucco house on Rivo Alto Island and a $1 million-plus condominium in Miami&#x27;s Four Seasons hotel. By early 2009, Drudge earned millions of dollars a year, traveled extensively, and moved to another property in Miami. In 2003, he said his one indulgence, apart from travel, was his Corvette.

===Political views===
&quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; has described Drudge as a conservative populist. In 1998, Drudge claimed that his politics are &quot;libertarian except for drugs and abortion&quot;. In 2001, he told the &quot;Miami New Times&quot;: &quot;I am a conservative. I&#x27;m very much pro-life. If you go down the list of what makes up a conservative, I&#x27;m there almost all the way.&quot; In 2002, he described himself as &quot;Free from any Corporate Concerns&quot;. In a 2005 interview with &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, Drudge described his politics: &quot;I&#x27;m not a right-wing Republican. I&#x27;m a conservative and want to pay less taxes. And I did vote Republican at the last election. But I&#x27;m more of a populist.&quot;

===Comments by journalists===
Drudge has been called &quot;the Walter Cronkite of his era&quot; by Mark Halperin and John F. Harris, and &quot;the country&#x27;s reigning mischief-maker&quot; by Todd Purdum of &quot;The New York Times.&quot; Michael Isikoff of &quot;Newsweek&quot; said &quot;Drudge is a menace to honest, responsible journalism. And to the extent that he&#x27;s read and people believe what they read, he&#x27;s dangerous.&quot; Camille Paglia called Drudge &quot;the kind of bold, entrepreneurial, free-wheeling, information-oriented outsider we need far more of in this country.&quot; David McClintick described him as &quot;a modern Tom Paine, a possible precursor to millions of town criers using the Internet to invade the turf of bigfoot journalists.&quot;

<doc id="204375" wikidata="Q2710387" url="?curid=204375" title="USS Newark (C-1)">
<text>The first USS &quot;Newark&quot; (C-1) was a United States Navy protected cruiser, the eighth protected cruiser launched by the United States. In design, she succeeded the &quot;ABC&quot; cruisers , , and with better protection, higher speed, and a uniform 6-inch gun armament. Four additional protected cruisers (C-2 through C-5) were launched for the USN prior to &quot;Newark&quot;.

She was laid down by William Cramp &amp; Sons of Philadelphia on 12 June 1888, launched on 19 March 1890, sponsored by Miss Annie Boutelle, the daughter of Representative Charles A. Boutelle of Maine, and commissioned on 2 February 1891, Captain Silas Casey III in command.

==Design and construction==

&quot;Newark&quot; was designed in 1885 by the Navy&#x27;s Bureau of Construction and Repair and Bureau of Steam Engineering, based on specifications developed by a special advisory board convened by Secretary of the Navy William C. Whitney. The new board was convened when Whitney felt the Naval Advisory Board&#x27;s design was inadequate. &quot;Newark&quot;″s uniform main armament of twelve 6-inch guns resulted from the need to mount guns in sponsons to increase their arc of fire. Rear Admiral Edward Simpson, president of the Naval Advisory Board, commented that it was impossible to mount 8-inch guns on sponsons in a 4,000-ton ship. She also had a complete armored deck in accordance with European practice.

&quot;Newark&quot; was armed with 12 /30 caliber Mark 3 guns in sponsons along the sides. This allowed ahead and astern fire by up to four guns. Secondary armament was four 6-pounder () guns, four 3-pounder () Hotchkiss revolving cannon, two 1-pounder () Hotchkiss revolving cannon, and four .45 caliber (11.4 mm) Gatling guns. Six 14-inch (356 mm) torpedo tubes were included in the design but never mounted.

&quot;Newark&quot; had gun shields and a conning tower. The complete armored deck was up to on its sloped sides and aft, amidships and forward. This was a significant improvement from the partial deck of .

The engineering plant included four coal-fired locomotive boilers producing steam, with two horizontal triple expansion engines totaling driving two shafts for a speed of . Like other US Navy ships of the 1880s, she was built with a sail rig to increase cruising range, later removed. The ship carried up to 400 tons of coal, with a cruising range as built of at ; this could be increased to 850 tons for a range of .

===Refits===
In 1898 &quot;Newark&quot;″s 6-inch guns were converted to rapid firing. She was rebuilt in 1901–02 with /40 caliber Mark 3 guns, with the secondary armament augmented or replaced by six /50 caliber guns. The 3-inch guns were removed in 1908, and all armament was removed prior to her service as a hospital ship beginning in 1913.

==Service history==

===North &amp; South Atlantic, 1891–1897===
&quot;Newark&quot; operated off the Atlantic coast for ten months, taking part in maneuvers and exercises until detached on 8 December at Norfolk Navy Yard. There she remained, undergoing post-shakedown overhaul until being assigned on 11 March 1892 to the North Atlantic Squadron and sailing on 14 March for the West Indies. The cruiser operated in Caribbean waters and off the lower east coast, showing the flag in West Indies ports until returning to Norfolk on 5 June where she was made flagship of Rear Admiral Andrew E. K. Benham, Commander of the newly formed South Atlantic Squadron, on 25 June.

She departed on 17 July for Cádiz, Spain to participate in the ceremonies commemorating the 400th Anniversary of Columbus&#x27; sailing. Arriving on 30 July, she remained until 2 August then sailed for Genoa, Columbus&#x27; birthplace, arriving one month later to continue the celebration. Putting out from Genoa on 25 August, &quot;Newark&quot; cruised the Mediterranean and the Adriatic, visiting many ports until arriving on 11 February 1893 at Cádiz to take in tow a full size reproduction of caravel &quot;Niña&quot; and sailing on 18 February for home. Transferred to the Naval Review Fleet for temporary duty on 1 March, the cruiser arrived at Havana on 21 March, parting with &quot;Niña&quot; there, thence sailing to Hampton Roads and New York where she picked up the caravel once more and proceeded down the St. Lawrence River to Quebec, leaving the little ship there on 11 June and returning to Norfolk on 22 June.

&quot;Newark&quot; next sailed on 20 September, this time for Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, to protect American interests, arriving on 20 October and remaining until 1 April 1894. The warship then operated off the South American coast with the South Atlantic Squadron, making one cruise to South Africa from August to October 1894 and another the same time the following year, before returning to Norfolk on 27 April 1896. Assigned to the North Atlantic Station on 4 May, she joined her squadron at New York 25 June and engaged in patrol duty and exercises off the southeastern coast until decommissioning at Norfolk 6 March 1897.

===Spanish–American War, 1898===

Following extensive overhaul, &quot;Newark&quot; recommissioned on 23 May 1898, shortly after the declaration of war on Spain, she sailed on 13 June for Key West and then Cuba, joining the blockade on 30 June. Cruising in Cuban waters throughout the summer, the warship bombarded the port of Manzanillo on 12 August and on the following day accepted its surrender. After the battle of Santiago de Cuba, she participated in the final destruction of Admiral Cervera&#x27;s fleet through bombardment of the burned hulks. &quot;Newark&quot; returned to New York on 26 November 1898.

===Philippine–American War, 1899===
Departing New York on 23 March 1899, the cruiser steamed down the coast of South America on patrol, stopping at numerous ports along the way. In the middle of her cruise, on 7 April, she was ordered to proceed through the Straits of Magellan to San Francisco. The ship, low on coal, was forced to put into Port Low, Chile, from 31 May to 22 June to cut wood for fuel. Finally arriving Mare Island Navy Yard on 4 September, &quot;Newark&quot; underwent repairs and then sailed on 17 October via Honolulu for the Philippines arriving Cavite on 25 November to support the U.S. Army in the Philippine–American War. The warship took station off Vigan, Luzon, landed troops for garrison duty, then moved on to Aparri on 10 December, receiving the surrender of insurrectionists in the provinces of Cagayan, Isabela, and Bataan.

===Boxer Rebellion, 1900–1901===

On 19 March 1900, she sailed for Hong Kong to rendezvous with the monitor
 on 22 March and convoy that ship to Cavite, arriving on 3 April and staying there until sailing for Yokohama on 24 April, arriving three days later. The ship then hoisted the flag of Rear Admiral Louis Kempff, Assistant-Commander of the Asiatic Station and sailed on 20 May for China to help land reinforcements to relieve the legations under siege by the Boxers at Peking. Arriving Tientsin on 22 May, &quot;Newark&quot; operated in that port and out of Taku and Chefoo, protecting American interests and aiding the relief expedition under Vice Admiral Edward Hobart Seymour, R.N., until sailing at the end of July for Kure, Japan, and then Cavite where she hoisted the pennant of the Senior Squadron Commander in the Philippines. She sailed for home in mid-April 1901, via Hong Kong, Ceylon and Suez, arriving Boston late July 1901. She decommissioned there on 29 July.

===North Atlantic Fleet, 1902–1906===
&quot;Newark&quot; recommissioned on 3 November 1902, Commander Richard Wainwright in command and sailed on 14 December for duty in southern waters. For the next two years she operated in the West Indies and off the coast of South America as part of the North Atlantic Fleet. Returning to Norfolk briefly on 27 October 1904 to 9 January 1905, she resumed her duties in the West Indies for the first six months of the year and then in June, following exercises off Virginia, was assigned as a training ship to the United States Naval Academy. Placed in reserve at Annapolis on 15 September, she was restored to full duty on 3 May 1906 for her second east coast training cruise. On 4 August 1906 one of her launches was sunk in a collision with the tug &quot;T. A. Scott, Jr.&quot; at New London, Connecticut. Following this duty, she put into Norfolk on 13 September where she embarked a Marine detachment and sailed for Cuba on the 17th. The veteran cruiser returned home on 19 October and decommissioned at New York Navy Yard on 9 November.

===Cuba, 1908–1912===
Loaned to the New York Naval Militia on 23 March 1907, she recommissioned exactly one year later for duty as a station ship at the Naval Station, Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. Arriving on 2 April 1908, she served on this duty until returning to Norfolk on 5 December 1912 to be placed in reserve on the 31st. &quot;Newark&quot; decommissioned on 16 June 1913 and was stricken from the Navy List on 26 June.

===Hospital ship, 1913–1926===
The old cruiser continued to serve her country following her Navy service. Turned over to the Public Health Service, she served as quarantine hulk for the hospital in Providence, Rhode Island, until 1918 when she returned to the Navy to serve throughout World War I as an annex to the Naval Hospital, Newport, Rhode Island. Later transferred to New York, she returned to the Public Health Service at Providence, in May 1919. On 7 July 1926 she was again returned to the Navy Department for disposal and was sold on 7 September.

<text>Perversion is a form of human behavior which is far from what is considered to be orthodox or normal. Although the term &quot;perversion&quot; can refer to a variety of forms of &quot;deviation&quot;, it is most often used to describe sexual behaviors that are considered particularly abnormal, repulsive or obsessive. Perversion usually differs from &quot;deviant behavior&quot;, in that the latter covers areas of behavior (such as petty crime) for which &quot;perversion&quot; would be too strong a term. It is often considered derogatory, and, in psychological literature, the term &quot;paraphilia&quot; has been used as a replacement for most forms of sexual perversion, though this clinical term is controversial, and &quot;deviation&quot; is sometimes used in its place.

==History of concept==
One view is that the concept of perversion is subjective, and its application varies depending on the individual. Another view considers that perversion is a degradation of an objectively true morality. Originating in the 1660s, a pervert was originally defined as &quot;one who has forsaken a doctrine or system regarded as true, apostate.&quot; The sense of a pervert as a sexual term was derived in 1896, and applied originally to variants of sexualities or sexual behavior believed harmful by the individual or group using the term.

==Non-sexual usages==
The verb &quot;pervert&quot; is less narrow in reference than the related nouns, and can be used without any sexual connotations. It is used in English law for the crime of perverting the course of justice which is a common law offence. There is a transition to the sexual in &#x27;the technique of purposeful perversion&#x27; of conversational remarks: &quot;Purposeful perversion of what a woman has said ... is a long step closer to a direct attempt at seduction or rape.&quot;

The noun sometimes occurs in abbreviated slang form as &quot;perv&quot; and used as a verb meaning &quot;to act like a pervert&quot;, and the adjective &quot;pervy&quot; also occurs. All are often, but not exclusively, used non-seriously.

In economics, the term &quot;perverse incentive&quot; means a policy that results in an effect contrary to the policymakers&#x27; intention.

==Sexual usages==

===Freud on the role of perversion===
Freud&#x27;s didactic strategy in his &quot;Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality&quot; was to construct a bridge between the &quot;perversions&quot; and &quot;normal&quot; sexuality. Clinically exploring &quot;a richly diversified collection of erotic endowments and inclinations: hermaphroditism, pedophilia, sodomy, fetishism, exhibitionism, sadism, masochism, coprophilia, necrophilia&quot; among them, Freud concluded that &quot;all humans are innately perverse&quot;. He found the roots of such perversions in infantile sexuality—in &#x27;the child&#x27;s &quot;polymorphously perverse&quot; inclinations ... the &quot;aptitude&quot; for such perversity is innate&#x27;. The &#x27;crucial irony of Freud&#x27;s account in the &quot;Three Essays&quot; was that perversion in childhood &quot;was&quot; the norm&#x27;.
Refining his analysis a decade later, Freud stressed that while childhood sexuality involved a wide and unfocused range of perverse activities, by contrast with adult perversion there was &#x27;an important difference between them. Perverse sexuality is as a rule excellently centred: all its activities are directed to an aim—usually a single one; one component instinct has gained the upper hand...In that respect there is no difference between perverse and normal sexuality other than the fact that their dominating component instincts and consequently their sexual aims are different. In both of them, one might say, a well-organized tyranny has been established, but in each of the two a different family has seized the reins of power&#x27;.

A few years later, in &quot;A Child is Being Beaten&quot; (1919), Freud laid greater stress on the fact that perversions &quot;go through a process of development, that they represent an end-product and not an initial manifestation ... that the sexual aberrations of childhood, as well as those of mature life, are ramifications of the same complex&quot;—the Oedipus complex. Otto Fenichel took up the point about the defensive function of perversions—of &quot;experiences of sexual satisfactions which simultaneously gave a feeling of security by denying or contradicting some fear&quot;; adding that while &quot;some people think that perverts are enjoying some kind of more intense sexual pleasure than normal people. This is not true ... [though] neurotics, who have repressed perverse longings, may envy the perverts who express the perverse longings openly&quot;.

===Perversion in women===
Freud wrote extensively on perversion in men. However, he and his successors paid scant attention to perversion in women. In 2003, psychologist, psychoanalyst and feminist Arlene Kramer Richards published a seminal paper on female perversion, &quot;A Fresh look at Perversion&quot;, in the &quot;Journal of the American Psychoanalytic Association&quot;. In 2015, psychoanalyst Lynn Friedman, in a review of The Complete Works of Arlene Richards in the Journal of the American Psychoanalytic Association, noted prior to that time, &quot;virtually no analysts were writing about female perversion. This pioneering work undoubtedly paved the way for others, including Louise Kaplan (1991), to explore this relatively uncharted territory.&quot;

===The permissive society===
With the sexual revolution of the later twentieth century, much that Freud had argued for became part of a new wide-ranging liberal consensus. At times this might lead to a kind of Panglossian world view where every fetishist has his &quot;fetishera ... for every man who is hung up on shoes, there is a woman ready to cater for and groove with him, and for every man who gets his thrills from hair, there is a woman who gets hers from having her locks raped. Havelock Ellis has many cases of this meeting of the minds: the man who yearns to get pressed on by high heels sooner or later meets the woman who has daydreamed all her life of heel-pressing&quot;.

Where internal controversy did arise in the liberal consensus was about the exact relation of variations to normal development—some considering in the wake of Freud that &quot;these different sexual orientations can best be explained and understood by comparison with normal development&quot;, and highlighting the fear of intimacy in perversion as &quot;a kind of sex ... which is hedged about with special conditions ... puts &quot;a vast distance&quot; between the partners&quot;. From such a standpoint, &quot;whatever the deviant impulse or fantasy may be, that&#x27;s where the real, true, loving sexuality is hidden&quot;—a point of transition perhaps to some of the bleaker post-permissive visions of perversion.

===Critical views===
For some participants, &quot;Liberation, at least in its sexual form, was a new kind of imposed morality, quite as restricting&quot; as what had gone before—one that &quot;took very little account of the complexity of human emotional connections&quot;. New, more sceptical currents of disenchantment with perversion emerged as a result (alongside more traditional condemnations) in both the French-speaking and English-speaking worlds.

Lacan had early highlighted &quot;the ambivalence proper to the &#x27;partial drives&#x27; of scoptophilia, sadomasochism ... the often very little &#x27;realised&#x27; aspect of the apprehension of others in the practice of certain of these perversions&quot;. In his wake, others would stress how &quot;there is always, in any perverse act, an aspect of rape, in the sense that the Other must find himself drawn into the experience despite himself ... a loss or abandonment of subjectivity.&quot;

Similarly, object relations theory would point to the way &quot;in perversion there is the refusal, the terror of strangeness&quot;; to the way &quot;the &#x27;pervert&#x27; ... attacks imaginative elaboration through compulsive action with an accomplice; and this is done to mask psychic pain&quot;. Empirical studies would find &quot;in the perverse relationships described...an absolute absence of any shared pleasures&quot;; while at the theoretical level &quot;perversions involve—the theory tells us—an attempted denial of the difference between the sexes and the generations&quot;, and include &quot;the wish to damage and dehumanize ... the misery of the driven, damaging life&quot;.

<text>The 4th Infantry Division, also known as the Red Eagle Division, is an infantry division of the Indian Army. This division of the British Indian Army was formed in Egypt in 1939 during the Second World War. During the Second World War, it took part in campaigns in East Africa (Eritrea and Sudan), Syria, North Africa and Italy. Post independence, the division is part of the I Corps and headquartered at Prayagraj.

==History==

===North Africa===
During the war, the 4th Indian Division was in the vanguard of nine campaigns in the Mediterranean theatre. Major-General The Hon. P. Gerald Scarlett appears to have been the division&#x27;s first commander, from October 1939 to January 1940. The British 14th Infantry Brigade was attached to the division from 1 June to 20 July 1940; the British 16th Infantry Brigade was attached from 9 September 1940 to 14 December 1940. In the first of Archibald Wavell&#x27;s operations in Egypt, as part of the Western Desert Force, it took part in Operation Compass in December 1940. The division was involved in the battles of that campaign in the camps around Sidi Barrani. Along with the 7th Royal Tank Regiment, the 11th Indian Infantry Brigade of the 4th Indian Infantry Division destroyed the Italian Maletti Group at the Nibiewa Camp.

===East Africa===

In December 1940, the division was rushed to the British Sudan to join with the 5th Indian Infantry Division in order to prevent the numerically vastly superior Italian forces (ten divisions in total) from threatening Red Sea supply routes to Egypt as well as Egypt itself and the Suez Canal from the south. The East African campaign culminated in March 1941 with the battles at Keren in Eritrea.

It was at Keren that Subadar Richhpal Ram of the 4/6th Rajputana Rifles, 5th Indian Infantry Brigade, 4th Division, was awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross. In April 1941, Beresford-Peirse was promoted to command the Western Desert Force and Major General Frank Messervy assumed command.

===North Africa and Syria===
Having returned to Egypt, the 5th Indian Infantry Brigade was hurried across to Syria and participated in the advance on Damascus during the Syria-Lebanon campaign (June 1941). From 14 to 17 June 1941, the British 4th Armoured Brigade was attached to the division. The rest of the 4th Indian Division, having been rejoined by the 5th Brigade returning from Syria, was involved in the fighting, which ebbed and flowed past Tobruk from June 1941 into the autumn of 1941. For most of this period, the division was dispersed, with units temporarily attached to other formations, much to the disgust of Major General Francis Tuker, who had assumed command of the division in December 1941. Notable at this time was the break-out at the end of January by 7th Brigade, having been cut off at Benghazi during the Axis counter-offensive from Agheila and moving 200 miles avoiding the enemy to rejoin the new Eighth Army.

Early in April 1942, the 4th Division was again dispersed, with the 7th Brigade going to Cyprus, the 5th Brigade to Syria, the 11th Brigade to the Suez Canal Zone for training and the Central India Horse to Iraq after a period of training. By May 1942, the 11th Brigade was back in the fighting at Tobruk (attached to the 5th Indian Infantry Division). The 11th Brigade was caught in the siege of Tobruk, which fell on 21 June, and disappeared from the order of battle for the next 18 months. The 5th Brigade was rushed to the desert in June 1942; after escaping from Mersa Matruh, the brigade held the vital Ruweisat Ridge during the First Battle of El Alamein in July–August 1942. The situation had become so confused that General Erwin Rommel, also known as the Desert Fox, lost his way and was forced to spend a night in the open. With the dawn came the realization that he was in the company of 4th Division. With a sigh of relief, he slipped away, undetected.

Shortly before the Second Battle of El Alamein in October 1942, the 4th Indian Division was reunited with the 7th Brigade returning from Cyprus and the 161st Indian Infantry Brigade was attached (until December 1942) to replace the lost 11th Brigade. The division had a relatively subsidiary role in the battle, holding in stiff fighting, as a diversionary tactic, the Ruweisat Ridge, which was at the centre of the Allied front, whilst the breakthrough was planned further north.

By December 1942, the division was dispersed again but strong representations by its General Officer Commanding (GOC), Major-General Tuker (including his asking to be relieved of command), resulted in the 4th Indian Division being brought together as a fighting entity in March 1943. It fought with distinction in the Tunisia Campaign, right through to the fall of Tunis in May 1943, gaining a particular reputation for its prowess in mountainous country. The division had the honour of capturing General Hans-Jürgen von Arnim in Tunisia, bringing an end to the war in North Africa. Its major battles in North Africa were Benghazi, Tobruk, Wadi Akarit, Enfidaville and Tunis.

===Italy===
The division then moved in January 1944 to Italy (joined by the re-constituted 11th Brigade), where it took part in the Italian Campaign. It fought in the second Battle of Monte Cassino and suffered many casualties (in Tuker&#x27;s absence through illness it was commanded by Brigadier Harry Dimoline, the divisional Commander Royal Artillery). During the battle, the division was to attack in an arc towards the south and south-west, taking Point 593 and then moving south-east, up the heights towards the Abbey. The Indian Division would only advance on the Abbey once the 2nd New Zealand Division had attacked south and south-east, taking the town of Cassino. The main attack eventually commenced just after last light with the NZ Division&#x27;s 28 (Maori) Battalion to cross the Rapido River and to seize the station south of Cassino town, establishing a bridgehead for the corps armour to move into the town and to the foot of the Cassino massif—the attack starting at 2:130. The 28th Battalion attack failed and so did the 4th Indian Division attack on Point 593.

The division also suffered many casualties during the third battle (in March 1944), when it was commanded by Major-General Alexander Galloway, who had been released from command of the British 1st Armoured Division.

Command of the division was assumed by Major-General Arthur Holworthy late in March 1944 and the division took part in the advance from Cassino after the fourth battle in May 1944 to the Trasimene Line in Central Italy and then the Gothic Line. As part of the attachments and detachments for the campaign, the British 9th Armoured Brigade was attached to the division from 8 July 1944 to 19 July 1944. In November 1944, the division was shipped to Greece to help stabilise the country after the Axis withdrawal. Holworthy was succeeded by Major-General Charles Hamilton Boucher in January 1945 who commanded the division until the end of hostilities.

===Conclusion===
According to author Chand Das, during the Second World War, the &quot;division captured 150,000 prisoners and suffered 25,000 casualties, more than the strength of a whole division. It won over 1,000 honours and awards which included four Victoria Crosses and three George Crosses&quot;.

Field Marshal Lord Wavell wrote: &quot;The fame of this Division will surely go down as one of the greatest fighting formations in military history, to be spoken of with such as The Legio X Equestris (Tenth Legion), The Light Division of the Peninsular War and Napoleon&#x27;s Old Guard&quot;. Das wrote, &quot;Even beyond its fighting reputation, it will be remembered for the spirit of mutual trust and fellowship maintained between all ranks coming from so many different races and creeds&quot;.

==Post war==
The division, known as Red Eagle due to its badge of a red eagle on a black background, is now a part of the Indian Army. Immediately after the war ended, it was in Greece, but returned to India later in 1945.

In 1947 the division became the nucleus of the Punjab Boundary Force under Major-General T.W. Rees. The Boundary Force was established on 17 July 1947, with its headquarters at Lahore. It became operational 1 August 1947, but was disbanded on 1 September because of its ineffectiveness in controlling the riots breaking out as a consequence of Partition. It had approximately 15 Indian and 10 Pakistani battalions, and comprised 5th Indian Infantry Brigade, 11th Indian Infantry Brigade, 14 Parachute Brigade, which became part of the Pakistan Army, 43 Lorry Brigade (ex 1 Armoured Division) and 114th Indian Infantry Brigade. Also attached were 50th Parachute Brigade and 77th Parachute Brigade (both formerly with 2nd Airborne Division), and 123rd Indian Infantry Brigade. After Rees handed over, Major-General K. S. Thimayya reportedly took over command of the Boundary Force. The division moved to Jullunder after the Boundary Force was disbanded.

==Sino-Indian War of 1962==

Headquarters 4 Infantry Division, which was located in Ambala prior to the worsening Sino-Indian relations, was moved to the North East in 1959 and was located initially at Tezpur. During the war, its tactical headquarters was based at Zemithang and at Dirang Dzong in Kameng Frontier Division of North East Frontier Agency (NEFA). It was commanded by Major General Niranjan Prasad. Following the defeat at Namka Chu, he was replaced by Major General Anant Singh Pathania.

The constituent brigades of the division before the war were 5, 7, and 11 Infantry Brigades. 11 Brigade was detached for counter-insurgency operations in Nagaland.

During the war, the division consisted of -
*7 Infantry Brigade (Brigadier John Parashuram Dalvi). It consisted of 9 Punjab and 1 Sikh, both at Tawang and 1/9 Gorkha Rifles – at Misamari. 2 Rajput, 4 Grenadiers, 5 Assam Rifles and a company of 6 Mahar also saw operations under the brigade. 

*5 Infantry Brigade (Brigadier Shiv Charan Singh) of the division was removed from operational control of 4 Division and was directly under Headquarters, 33 Corps. It arrived in the foothills of the sector only on 19 November 1962.

*4 Artillery Brigade (Brigadier Kalyan Singh , replaced by Brigadier GS Gill). Artillery units which were part of the war include elements from 34 Heavy Mortar Battery (from 36 (Maratha) Heavy Mortar Regiment), 17 Parachute Field Regiment, 5 Field Regiment (95, 96 and 97 Field Batteries), 6 Field Regiment (86, 87 and 88 Field Batteries), 22 Mountain Regiment (7 (Bengal) and 2 (Derajat) Mountain Batteries) and 116 Heavy Mortar Battery (from 33 Medium Regiment).

Other brigades involved in the operations in this sector included - 
*62 Infantry Brigade (Brigadier N.K. Lal, replaced by Brigadier Hoshiar Singh) - Part of 20 Infantry Division (Ranchi) and was stationed at Ramgarh before the war; with 1 Sikh, 2 Sikh LI, 4 Sikh LI, 13 Dogra, 4 Garhwal Rifles, (2/8 Gorkha Rifles to 5 Infantry Brigade and 4 Sikh to 11 Infantry Brigade in Walong sector).

*65 Infantry Brigade (Brigadier G.M. Saeed, replaced by Brigadier A.S. Cheema) - From Hyderabad; with 19 Maratha LI, 4 Rajput and a platoon of 7 Mahar machine-gunners.

*48 Infantry Brigade (Brigadier Gurbux Singh) - From 17 Infantry Division at Ambala; with 5 Guards, 1 Sikh LI, 1 Madras, a platoon of 7 Mahar machine-gunners and two tanks from 7 Light Cavalry.

*67 Infantry Brigade (Brigadier M.S. Chatterjee) - from Nagaland; with JAK LI, 6/8 Gorkha Rifles

The forces of the division were ill prepared for the warfare in the mountains and poorly equipped to weather out in the cold climate. Poor leadership and refusal to acknowledge feedback from the forces on the ground (including multiple requests by Brigadier Dalvi for a tactical withdrawal) led to the rout of the Indian forces. 7 Infantry Brigade was effectively destroyed at the Namka Chu ridge on 20 October 1962 during the war. 
The tactical Headquarters of 4 Infantry Division withdrew from Zemithang on the morning of 21 October 1962. Tawang Garrison with two infantry Battalions and three artillery batteries was abandoned on 23 October 1962. The second phase of the Chinese attack commenced on 17 November 1962, after a lull of 23 days. The division faced further defeat and withdrew from Dirang Dzong in the forenoon of 18 November. The Chinese announced a unilateral cease-fire on 20 November, effective from the midnight of 21/22 November.

It was converted to a mountain division in 1963.

==Indo-Pakistani War of 1965==

The Red Eagles, less 33 Mountain Brigade were part of the XI Corps tasked to defend Punjab. Being a mountain division, it was inadequately equipped for warfare in the plains. The divisional plan was as under -
*62 Mountain Brigade - advance on Khemkaran-Kasur Road and capture Rohi Nallah area, cover Khemkaran, secure the Bambawali-Ravi-Bedian Canal (Ichogil Canal) between Ballanwala and Ganda Singh Wala
*7 Mountain Brigade - to secure the East bank of Ichogil Canal between Bedian and Ballanwala

The order of battle of the division was as follows -

4 Mountain Division (Major General Gurbaksh Singh)
*9 Horse (Deccan Horse)
*37 Battalion Punjab Armed Police
7 Mountain Brigade (Brigadier DS Sidhu)
*1/9 Gorkha Rifles
*4 Grenadiers
*7 Grenadiers 
*4 Sikh (after 12 September)
*2 Mahar (after 12 September)
62 Mountain Brigade (Brigadier HC Gahlaut)
*13 Dogra
*9 JAK LI
*18 Rajputana Rifles
4 Mountain Artillery Brigade (Brigadier Jhanda Singh Sandhu)
*1 Field Regiment (Self Propelled) (from 2 Independent Armoured Brigade)
*40 Medium Regiment (from 21 Independent Artillery Brigade)
*91 Mountain Composite (Towed) Regiment
*84 Light Regiment
*B Troop, 72 Composite Battery, 20 Locating Regiment
*Battery, 45 Air Defence Regiment
*Air OP

29 Infantry Brigade (from 16 September 1965) (7 Infantry Division)
*2 Maratha Light Infantry
*3/9 Gorkha Rifles
*4 (Independent) Squadron
*144 Field Regiment (TA)

62 Brigade commenced its attacks on 6 September and secured its objectives, except for the far bund in Rohi Nallah area. 7 Brigade met with stiff opposition. 4 Grenadiers secured the line of Ichhogil canal, but 7 Grenadiers could not secure its objective of capturing Ballanwala. This was followed by heavy enemy shelling. Some units suffered heavy casualties and desertions. Anticipating an armour thrust, the GOC decided to pull back to Asal Uttar on 7 September and hold the enemy. It assumed a ‘horse shoe’ shaped defensive position with Asal Uttar as its focal point. The Pakistani forces, consisting of the 1 Armoured Division and 11 Infantry Division attacked on 8 September. Though some positions of 1/9 Gorkhas and 18 Rajputana Rifles were overrun, 7 and 62 Brigades supported by Deccan Horse and 3 Cavalry were able to repulse the attacks. The Pakistanis launched a second attack on the night of 8 September. This attack was held back by the units of 7 Brigade, supported by armour and artillery and the enemy lost many tanks. Anticipating a wide outflanking manoeuvre from the west, Brigadier Theogaraj moved the major part of his brigade to cover the Lakhna-Mahmudpura-Chima area and flooded part of the approaches to guide the enemy tanks to a trap. As expected, in the morning of 10 September, the Pakistani M-47 and M48 Patton tanks were lured inside the horse-shoe shaped defensive position. They were first held back by the 4 Grenadiers. The battalion held out with great gallantry. This was when Company Quartermaster Havildar Abdul Hamid destroyed three tanks with his recoilless gun (for which he was awarded the Param Vir Chakra). The Pakistanis made multiple attempts to overrun the Indian defences. However, the swampy grounds and the tactical planning of the Indians meant that they suffered heavy losses - which included a total of 97 tanks and many men and senior officers. At the same time, the Indian Army lost only 10 tanks. The bulk of the Pakistani offense withdrew to Khemkaran. The division then made many unsuccessful attempts to capture Khemkaran, without success.

4 Mountain Division suffered 60 killed, 206 wounded and 93 missing in action. The major gallantry awards won during the battle were -
*Param Vir Chakra
**Company Quartermaster Havildar Abdul Hamid, 4 Grenadiers
*Maha Vir Chakra
**Major General Gurbaksh Singh, GOC 4 Mountain Division.
**Brigadier TK Theograj, Commander, 2 Independent Armoured Brigade

**Lieutenant Colonel Salim Caleb, Commandant, 3 Cavalry.
**Lieutenant Colonel AS Vaidya, Commandant, 9 Horse.

**40 Medium Regiment 
**4 Grenadiers 
**18 Rajputana Rifles (now 11 Mechanised Infantry Regiment) 
**1 Dogra (now 7 Mechanised Infantry Regiment)

==Indo-Pakistani War of 1971==
The division along with 9 Infantry Division was part of the II Corps on the eastern sector. The order of battle (ORBAT) for the division was as follows-

4 Mountain Division (Major General Mohinder Singh Barar)
*45 Cavalry (A Squadron)
7 Mountain Brigade (Brigadier Zail Singh)
*22 Rajput
*5 Jat
*1 Naga Regiment
41 Mountain Brigade (Brigadier A.H.E. &quot;Tony&quot; Michigan)

*9 Dogra
*5/1 Gorkha Rifles
62 Mountain Brigade (Brigadier Rajendra Nath)

Before the outbreak of full-fledged war, 4 Mountain Division had captured the border areas of Jibannagar, Uthali (by 62 Brigade) and Darshana (by 41 Brigade). The divisional plan was to advance on Magura by way of Majdia, Jibannagar, Kotchandpur and Jhenaidah, so as to secure the ferry on the Madhumati river.

After the commencement of operations, Kotchandpur was captured by 62 Brigade on 4 December 1971, though they suffered heavy casualties. 41 Mountain Brigade was tasked to form a block between Chuadanga and Jhenaidah, preventing two Pakistani battalions from moving towards Jhenaidah. 41 Mountain Brigade advanced and captured Jhenaidah and Kaliganj by 7 December. 62 Mountain Brigade captured Magura by 9 December. 7 Mountain Brigade, which had been entrusted to capture Kushtia in the North, met with stiff resistance on 9 December from the Pakistanis, which included armour. 41 Mountain Brigade and 62 Infantry Brigade therefore had to be sent to capture Kushtia. This delay led to 62 and 7 Mountain Brigades resuming their offensive towards Faridpur only on 15 December. By this time, IV Corps had reached Dacca, forcing a Pakistani surrender on 16 December 1971. On 16 December, Major General M.H. Ansari, GOC, Pakistan’s 9 Infantry Division and his divisional staff surrendered to Major General M.S. Barar at Kamarkhali, while his 3,000-strong garrison laid down arms before Brigadier Rajendra Nath at Faridpur.

The major gallantry awards won during the battle were

*Maha Vir Chakra
**Brigadier A.H.E. Michigan
**Lieutenant Colonel Chittoor Venugopal, 5/1 Gorkha Rifles 
**Havildar Bir Bahadur Pun, 5/1 Gorkha Rifles 
**Rifleman Pati Ram Gurung, 5/1 Gorkha Rifles

*The battle honour &quot;Darsana&quot; was awarded to the following units-
**45 Cavalry
**5/1 Gorkha Rifles

<text>The third USS &quot;Charleston&quot; (C-22/CA-19) was a United States Navy protected cruiser. She was launched 23 January 1904 by Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Co., Newport News, Virginia, sponsored by Miss Helen Whaley Rhett, and commissioned on 17 October 1905, Captain Cameron McRae Winslow in command. She was reclassified CA-19 on 17 July 1920.

==Service history==

===Pre-World War I===
&quot;Charleston&quot; cruised to South American ports in the summer of 1906 with Secretary of State Elihu Root on board for good-will visits, and after disembarking the official party at Panama in September, returned to the west coast for overhaul. She cleared San Francisco on 6 December 1906 to begin service with the Pacific Squadron, sailing along the west coast from Magdalena Bay, Mexico, to Esquimalt, British Columbia, on exercises and fleet maneuvers until 10 June 1908, when she entered the Puget Sound Navy Yard to prepare for the long passage to the Asiatic Squadron. During this time, &quot;Charleston&quot; stopped in Portland, Oregon in June 1907 for the annual Portland Rose Festival. &quot;Charleston&quot; was the first U.S. Navy ship to attend the event, a tradition the Navy continues participate in to this day.

Leaving Puget Sound on 28 October 1908, &quot;Charleston&quot; served in the Far East until 11 September 1910, first as flagship of 3rd Squadron, Pacific Fleet, and later, as flagship of the Asiatic Fleet. Based on Cavite, Philippines in the winter, the Fleet moved north each summer to Yantai, China, to continue exercises and visits to ports of China, Japan, Manchuria, and Russia, presenting a powerful reminder of American interest in the Far East. Returning to Bremerton, Washington, &quot;Charleston&quot; was decommissioned on 8 October 1910 at Puget Sound.

Placed in commission in reserve on 14 September 1912, &quot;Charleston&quot; joined the Pacific Reserve Fleet, remaining at Puget Sound as a receiving ship through early 1916, aside from a voyage to San Francisco in October 1913 as flagship for the Commander-in-Chief, Pacific Reserve Fleet. From 1912 through early 1916, she was receiving ship at the yard. With a new assignment as tender for the submarines based in the Panama Canal Zone, &quot;Charleston&quot; arrived at Cristobal, C.Z. on 7 May 1916, for a year of operations with submarines, reconnaissance of anchorages, and gunnery exercises.

===World War I===
On the day of America&#x27;s entry into World War I on 6 April 1917, &quot;Charleston&quot; was placed in full commission, and early in May reported for duty with the Patrol Force in the Caribbean. Based on St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands, she patrolled for commerce raiders through the month of May, then sailed north carrying Marines from Haiti to Philadelphia.

Here she readied to join the escort of the convoy carrying the first troops of the American Expeditionary Force to France, which cleared New York on 14 June, made St. Nazaire, France, after a safe passage through submarine waters on 28 June, and returned to New York on 19 July. After training naval volunteers and reserves for two weeks at Newport, &quot;Charleston&quot; cleared on 16 August for Havana, Cuba, where she supervised the sailing in tow of several former German ships to New Orleans. She next escorted a convoy from Cristobal to Bermuda, where she rendezvoused with a group of British transports, guarding their passage to Hampton Roads.

In September–October 1918, she made two convoy escort voyages to Nova Scotia, then joined the Cruiser and Transport Force, with which she made five voyages to France carrying occupation troops overseas and returning with combat veterans.

===Decommissioning and fate===
&quot;Charleston&quot; sailed from Philadelphia for the west coast on 23 July 1919, reaching Bremerton on 24 August. Here she was placed in reduced commission until late in 1920, when she arrived in San Diego to serve as administrative flagship for Commander, Destroyer Squadrons, Pacific Fleet. She served on this duty until 4 June 1923, when she sailed for Puget Sound Navy Yard and decommissioning on 4 December 1923. She was sold on 6 March 1930.

&quot;Charleston&quot; was stripped down to the waterline and then sold to the Powell River Company, Ltd. On 25 October 1930, the ship was towed to Powell River, British Columbia, Canada, to serve as a floating breakwater for a large logging mill. The hulk was ballasted, anchored and periodically pumped out to keep her afloat. The following year, she was joined by the hull of the cruiser &quot;Huron&quot; (formerly &quot;South Dakota&quot;). In 1961, heavy weather caused &quot;Charleston&quot; to partially flood, and her hull was towed to Kelsey Bay, on the north coast of Vancouver Island. The hulk was run ashore to serve as a breakwater, where she can be seen to this day.

==Silver service==
On 1 January 1905, the city of Charleston, South Carolina gave a silver punch service to the ship. The service included a silver bowl with an diameter that weighed nearly . The set was designed and made by Carrington, Thomas &amp; Co. in Charleston and included panels showing Fort Sumter, St. Michael&#x27;s Episcopal Church, Fort Moultrie, City Hall, and a view of the Battery. The set included a bowl, tray, and ladle that all included the seal of the city. When the ship was decommissioned, the service was returned to Charleston where it was displayed, for a period, at the Charleston Museum; it was again given to the next USS &quot;Charleston&quot; in 1936 and again returned to the city when that ship was itself decommissioned.

<doc id="204397" wikidata="Q7919570" url="?curid=204397" title="Venceremos Brigade">
<text>The Venceremos Brigade is an international organization founded in 1969 by members of the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) and officials of the Republic of Cuba. It was formed as a coalition of young people to show solidarity with the Cuban Revolution by working side by side with Cuban workers, challenging U.S. policies towards Cuba, including the United States embargo against Cuba. The yearly brigade trips, which as of 2010 have brought more than 9,000 people to Cuba, continue today and are coordinated with the Pastors For Peace Friendship Caravans to Cuba. The 48th Brigade travelled to Cuba in July 2017.

==History==
===Original brigades===

The 1959 Cuban Revolution was a key event that galvanized and inspired the growing New Left in the 1960s. Cuba became viewed as a radical and anti-imperialist third world country worthy of praise by many of the radical activists of the 1960s.

In 1969, SDS was composed of competing factions with individual priorities and visions. SDS delegates travelled to Havana, and were inspired by Fidel Castro&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s Day speech, in which he called on Cubans to help with the sugar harvest. Although the Americans originally offered to help by taking industrial jobs displaced by the massive sugar harvest, Fidel reportedly responded that if North Americans were to help, they would cut cane. Hoping to unite SDS members behind a new project, the leaders began planning a trip, bringing American activists to Cuba to cut sugar cane. Carl Oglesby originally presented the idea to members of SDS, but was ousted from SDS before it came to fruition. Bernardine Dohrn appointed Julie Nichamin and Brian Murphy to organize the trip. Allen Young was also partly responsible for the organization and negotiations with Carlos Rafael Rodríguez and other members of the Cuban government. While in the US, the group met occasionally by regions to supervise, recruit, and fundraise for the trips. The trip cohort, the Venceremos (&quot;we shall triumph&quot; in Spanish language) Brigade, was promoted as an inspiring and educational experience. The brigade itself was designed to encompass members from all radical movements in the United States, from black power radicals to anti-war student activists.

In November 1969, the first brigade of 216 Americans travelled to Cuba from Mexico City to skirt the U.S. government&#x27;s restrictions on travel to the island. The participants were to contribute to Cuba&#x27;s monumental ten million ton &quot;zafra&quot; (harvest) of 1970, as well as to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the Cuban Revolution. The second Brigade arrived in February 1970, to cut cane and learn about Cuban life. Although the &quot;zafra&quot; did not reach ten million tons, the Brigades continued.

===Later developments===
The Antonio Maceo Brigade was formed as a Cuban solidarity group of Cuban American radicals that first traveled to Cuba in 1977. Many Cubans who joined the brigade were motivated to prove that they weren&#x27;t counterrevolutionary &quot;gusanos&quot;. At the time the Venceremos Brigade refused to allow Cuban exiles to be members believing them all to be middle class and counterrevolutionary &quot;gusanos&quot;.

The FBI has questioned individual brigade travellers over the years. Michael Ratner, who had represented members of the Venceremos Brigade, said that visits by FBI agents were most prevalent in the 1970s and 1980s and dropped off during the 1990s. In 2010, at least 10 brigade participants were visited by FBI agents.

== Organization ==
=== Ideology ===
In &quot;Venceremos Brigade&quot;, Sandra Levinson and Carol Brightman describe the participants, &quot;brigadistas&quot;, as &quot;American radicals.&quot; They were attracted to Cuba by the socialist revolution taking place, the anti-imperialist movement, as well as Cuban culture. The Venceremos Brigade included a diverse group of participants from the beginning. White, Black, Chicano, Native American, and Puerto Rican Americans, as well as activists and feminists participated. In part, the Venceremos Brigade went to Cuba to study revolutionary culture, Che Guevara, and Che&#x27;s new socialist man. New Left philosophy permeated the movement. The &quot;brigadistas&quot; also invoked Cuba&#x27;s history of anti-racist and anti-colonial movements, and referred to the Black Power and feminist movements in the US, with the goal of creating a revolutionary political culture within the group.

Despite the leftist nature of the Brigades and the Cuban government, conflict emerged between Brigade organizers and gay members of the Brigade and their allies. To Cuban officials, the gay liberation movement represented U.S. imperialism, and was a challenge to Fidel Castro and Cuba. The organizers of the Venceremos Brigades settled on a Don&#x27;t ask, don&#x27;t tell policy, requiring queer &quot;brigadistas&quot; to refrain from discussing or performing their sexuality. Queer &quot;brigadistas&quot; were subject to homophobic slurs and questions, and homophobia was the overall policy. There were also gender-based tensions in the early brigades.

<doc id="204401" wikidata="Q4920615" url="?curid=204401" title="Black Cultural Association">
<text>The Black Cultural Association (BCA) was an African-American inmate group founded in 1968 at the California Medical Facility at Vacaville, a California state prison, and formally recognized by prison officials in 1969. The primary purpose of the BCA was to provide educational tutoring to inmates, which it did in conjunction with graduate college students from the nearby San Francisco Bay Area. Outsiders were allowed to attend meetings of the BCA, and tutors provided remedial and advanced courses in mathematics, reading, writing, art, history, political science, and sociology. In time, radical political organizations such as Venceremos infiltrated the BCA, giving rise to BCA factions such as Unisight, which eventually gave birth to the Symbionese Liberation Army.

==Origins==

The 1960s were famous for numerous social movements, including the Black Panther Party in California. This increase in racial tension across the nation fed to rising concerns about the African-American population. The Black Panther Party was created to watch the actions of police forces in Los Angeles making sure that they were protecting the public as a whole, not a specific race. In Oakland, the number of arrests dramatically increased, which led to an increase in prison populations. In the State of California&#x27;s prisoners statistics it states that the populations of inmates on December 31, 1960, was 21,660 persons. 8 years later on December 31, 1968 the population had increased to a high of 28,462. During the 1960s the black distribution in California prisons was 20.8 percent but gradually increased to 34.1 percent by the 1980s. The same people who were demanding social reforms found themselves in jail demanding prison reforms for those of color. From this rise in black inmate population came the Black Cultural Association, or the BCA. Their goal was to educate black inmates on basic educational skills as well as foster an environment for black empowerment.

==Timeline==
*1954: The Civil Rights Movement Begins

*1968: Civil Rights Act of 1968, which prevented &quot;by force or by threat of force, injure, intimidate, or interfere with anyone…by reason of their race, color, religion, or national origin.&quot;

*1968: The Black Cultural Association is founded.

*1971: The Black Cultural Association becomes an officially recognized prison group under the tutoring system put in place by linguistic professor Colston Westbrook.

*1972: The BCA gains popularity with white radicals through the help of William Wolfe. White activists begin to attend BCA meetings with the approval of Colston Westbrook.

*1972: The Maximum Psychiatric Diagnostic Unit at the Vacaville prison begins doing illegal experimentation on inmates, sparking controversy over fair treatment.

*December 1972: Rumors spread within the BCA that Westbrook was connected to the Central Intelligence Agency, therefore part of administering drug tests to black inmates.

*1973: The group gains peak attendance, with about 100 inmates part of the BCA.

==Education, tutors, and members==

=== Educational tutoring and politics ===
The main purpose of the BCA was to provide educational tutoring for inmates. For two years the BCA operated without much direction. However, in 1971 the BCA was officially recognized by the California Medical Facility. University of California-Berkeley linguistic professor, Colston Westbrook was recruited to organize an educational tutoring system for the group. Westbrook&#x27;s goal was to instill racial pride in the prisoners and provide self-help. Westbrook brought in a group of tutors to teach math, reading, writing, art, political science, black sociology, and African heritage. A majority of the BCA tutors were white students from the University of California at Berkeley that held leftist and radical beliefs. BCA tutors included Russell Little and William Wolfe. As well as Patricia Soltysik, Nancy Ling Perry, and Patty Hearst (who used a fake ID with the name Mary Alice Siem), according to Lake Headley, a private investigator. The group began to grow and started to meet two to three times a week. Over time, the BCA evolved from an educational group into more of a political group that focused on radical ideals and black empowerment. Because the focus of the group shifted away from the conventional educational group, no statistics could be found on how successful the program was at improving the education of prisoners.

=== Donald DeFreeze ===
One notable member of the BCA was a black prisoner named Donald DeFreeze. Defreeze became close with Westbrook and quickly embraced the revolutionary fantasy that was fostered in the BCA. Eventually, DeFreeze was transferred to Soledad State Prison where he then escaped. Following his escape he teamed up with fellow BCA members Russell Little and William Wolfe, as well as Bill and Emily Harris and Angela Atwood, to create the Symbionese Liberation Army.

==Group evolution==
The Black Cultural Association met regularly with outside volunteers, some of which did not teach basic educational skills. Tutors and prisoners tended to have discussions on radical ideas, often influencing inmates to join their way of thinking. Donald DeFreeze was one inmate who converted his political ideas after attending BCA meetings. Soon after, DeFreeze broke off from the Black Cultural Association and created his own group within the prison. Willie Wolfe and Russ Little were two white volunteers that joined the small group DeFreeze set up, as well as ex-Black panther and inmate Thero Wheeler. This small group of radical-left&#x27;s is considered the beginning of the Symbionese Liberation Army, or the SLA. Other volunteers at Vacaville prison were members of the Venceremos, a radical Chicano political organization. When the Venceremos political group became inactive, it joined forces with DeFreeze and the SLA to fight for prison reforms and black rights.

==Conspiracy==

Because the BCA operated with major political overtones under the pretense of education, many feared the group as a means to control the inmates and fuel the social unrest of the time. Various conspiracy theories involved the accusations that the group was transformed into an assassin group rather than one based purely for education. With inmates cut off from the outside world and their only information being fed to them by the radical tutors, it is believed by some that the group plotted revolution and other drastic means for social change. Louis Nelson, warden at San Quentin stated in a memo:

We are reading in the public press, and hearing via television and radio, that the best breeding and/or recruiting ground for neo-revolutionaries is in the prison system…. I am witnessing the deterioration of our ethnic organizations, which were once dedicated to the educational improvement of our men inside San Quentin, to para-military organizations with revolutionary overtones…. I do not believe that as the propagation of revolutionary acts or material. In fact, I believe it to be the exact opposite of my duty…. I intend to draw the line at revolutionary education.

Suspicions gained truth when radical groups calling for revolution such as the SLA branched off from and eventually took over the BCA. It abandoned education as its purpose and focused instead on political revolution.

<doc id="204404" wikidata="Q15440164" url="?curid=204404" title="Literary consonance">
<text>Consonance is a form of rhyme involving the repetition of identical or similar consonants in neighboring words whose vowel sounds are different (e.g., coming home, hot foot). Consonance may be regarded as the counterpart to the vowel-sound repetition known as assonance.

Alliteration is a special case of consonance where the repeated consonant sound is at the stressed syllable, as in &quot;few flocked to the fight&quot; or &quot;around the rugged rock the ragged rascal ran&quot;. Alliteration is usually distinguished from other types of consonance in poetic analysis and has different uses and effects.

Another special case of consonance is sibilance, the use of several sibilant sounds such as and . An example is the verse from Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s &quot;The Raven&quot;: &quot;And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain.&quot; (This example also contains assonance around the &quot;ur&quot; sound.) Another example of consonance is the word &quot;sibilance&quot; itself.

Consonance is an element of half-rhyme poetic format, sometimes called &quot;slant rhyme&quot;. It is common in hip-hop music, as for example in the song &quot;Zealots&quot; by the Fugees: &quot;Rap rejects my tape deck, ejects projectile/Whether Jew or gentile I rank top percentile.&quot; (This is also an example of internal rhyme.)

<text>The pastoral genre of literature, art, or music depicts an idealised form of the shepherd&#x27;s lifestyle – herding livestock around open areas of land according to the seasons and the changing availability of water and pasture. The target audience is typically an urban one. A &quot;pastoral&quot; is a work of this genre. A piece of music in the genre is usually referred to as a pastorale.

The genre is also known as bucolic, from the Greek , from , meaning a cowherd.

== Literature ==

===Pastoral literature in general===
Pastoral is a mode of literature in which the author employs various techniques to place the complex life into a simple one. Paul Alpers distinguishes pastoral as a mode rather than a genre, and he bases this distinction on the recurring attitude of power; that is to say that pastoral literature holds a humble perspective toward nature. Thus, pastoral as a mode occurs in many types of literature (poetry, drama, etc.) as well as genres (most notably the pastoral elegy).

Terry Gifford, a prominent literary theorist, defines pastoral in three ways in his critical book &quot;Pastoral&quot;. The first way emphasizes the historical literary perspective of the pastoral in which authors recognize and discuss life in the country and in particular the life of a shepherd. This is summed up by Leo Marx with the phrase &quot;No shepherd, no pastoral.&quot; The second type of the pastoral is literature that &quot;describes the country with an implicit or explicit contrast to the urban&quot;. The third type of pastoral depicts the country life with derogative classifications.Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Works and Days&quot; presents a &#x27;golden age&#x27; when people lived together in harmony with nature. This Golden Age shows that even before the Alexandrian age, ancient Greeks had sentiments of an ideal pastoral life that they had already lost. This is the first example of literature that has pastoral sentiments and may have begun the pastoral tradition. Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; is much like the &quot;Works and Days&quot; with the description of ages (golden, silver, bronze, iron, and human) but with more ages to discuss and less emphasis on the gods and their punishments. In this artificially constructed world, nature acts as the main punisher. Another example of this perfect relationship between man and nature is evident in the encounter of a shepherd and a goatherd who meet in the pastures in Theocritus&#x27; poem &quot;Idylls 1&quot;.
Traditionally, pastoral refers to the lives of herdsmen in a romanticized, exaggerated, but representative way. In literature, the adjective &#x27;pastoral&#x27; refers to rural subjects and aspects of life in the countryside among shepherds, cowherds and other farm workers that are often romanticized and depicted in a highly unrealistic manner. The pastoral life is usually characterized as being closer to the golden age than the rest of human life. The setting is a , or a beautiful place in nature, sometimes connected with images of the Garden of Eden. An example of the use of the genre is the short poem by the 15th-century Scottish makar Robert Henryson &quot;Robene and Makyne&quot; which also contains the conflicted emotions often present in the genre. A more tranquil mood is set by Christopher Marlowe&#x27;s well known lines from his 1588 &quot;The Passionate Shepherd to His Love&quot;:

&quot;The Passionate Shepherd to His Love&quot; exhibits the concept of Gifford&#x27;s second definition of &#x27;pastoral&#x27;. The speaker of the poem, who is the titled shepherd, draws on the idealization of urban material pleasures to win over his love rather than resorting to the simplified pleasures of pastoral ideology. This can be seen in the listed items: &quot;lined slippers&quot;, &quot;purest gold&quot;, &quot;silver dishes&quot;, and &quot;ivory table&quot; (lines 13, 15, 16, 21, 23). The speaker takes on a voyeuristic point of view with his love, and they are not directly interacting with the other true shepherds and nature.

Pastoral shepherds and maidens usually have Greek names like Corydon or Philomela, reflecting the origin of the pastoral genre. Pastoral poems are set in beautiful rural landscapes, the literary term for which is &quot;locus amoenus&quot; (Latin for &quot;beautiful place&quot;), such as Arcadia, a rural region of Greece, mythological home of the god Pan, which was portrayed as a sort of Eden by the poets. The tasks of their employment with sheep and other rustic chores is held in the fantasy to be almost wholly undemanding and is left in the background, leaving the shepherdesses and their swains in a state of almost perfect leisure. This makes them available for embodying perpetual erotic fantasies. The shepherds spend their time chasing pretty girls – or, at least in the Greek and Roman versions, pretty boys as well. The eroticism of Virgil&#x27;s second eclogue, &quot;Formosum pastor Corydon ardebat Alexin&quot; (&quot;The shepherd Corydon burned with passion for pretty Alexis&quot;), is entirely homosexual.

===Pastoral poetry===

Pastoral literature continued after Hesiod with the poetry of the Hellenistic Greek Theocritus, several of whose &quot;Idylls&quot; are set in the countryside (probably reflecting the landscape of the island of Cos where the poet lived) and involve dialogues between herdsmen. Theocritus may have drawn on authentic folk traditions of Sicilian shepherds. He wrote in the Doric dialect but the metre he chose was the dactylic hexameter associated with the most prestigious form of Greek poetry, epic. This blend of simplicity and sophistication would play a major part in later pastoral verse. Theocritus was imitated by the Greek poets Bion and Moschus.

The Roman poet Virgil adapted pastoral into Latin with his highly influential &quot;Eclogues&quot;. Virgil introduces two very important uses of pastoral, the contrast between urban and rural lifestyles and political allegory most notably in Eclogues 1 and 4 respectively. In doing so, Virgil presents a more idealized portrayal of the lives of shepherds while still employing the traditional pastoral conventions of Theocritus. He was the first to set his poems in Arcadia, an idealized location to which much later pastoral literature will refer.

Horace&#x27;s &quot;Epodes&quot;, ii Country Joys has &quot;the dreaming man&quot; Alfius, who dreams of escaping his busy urban life for the peaceful country. But as &quot;the dreaming man&quot; indicates, this is just a dream for Alfius. He is too consumed in his career as a usurer to leave it behind for the country.

Later Silver Latin poets who wrote pastoral poetry, modeled principally upon Virgil&#x27;s Eclogues, include Calpurnius Siculus and Nemesianus and the author(s) of the Einsiedeln Eclogues.

Italian poets revived the pastoral from the 14th century onwards, first in Latin (examples include works by Petrarch, Pontano and Mantuan) then in the Italian vernacular (Sannazaro, Boiardo). The fashion for pastoral spread throughout Renaissance Europe.

Leading French pastoral poets include Marot, a poet of the French court, and Pierre de Ronsard, once called the &quot;prince of poets&quot; in his day.
The first pastorals in English were the &quot;Eclogues&quot; (c. 1515) of Alexander Barclay, which were heavily influenced by Mantuan. A landmark in English pastoral poetry was Spenser’s &quot;The Shepheardes Calender&quot;, first published in 1579. Spenser&#x27;s work consists of twelve eclogues, one for each month of the year, and is written in dialect. It contains elegies, fables and a discussion of the role of poetry in contemporary England. Spenser and his friends appear under various pseudonyms (Spenser himself is &quot;Colin Clout&quot;). Spenser&#x27;s example was imitated by such poets as Michael Drayton (&quot;Idea, The Shepherd&#x27;s Garland&quot;) and William Browne (&quot;Britannia&#x27;s Pastorals&quot;). During this period of England&#x27;s history, many authors explored &quot;anti-pastoral&quot; themes. Two examples of this, Sir Philip Sidney&#x27;s &quot;The Twenty-Third Psalm&quot; and &quot;The Nightingale&quot;, focus on the world in a very anti-pastoral view. In “The Twenty-Third Psalm,” Nature is portrayed as something we need to be protected from, and in “The Nightingale,” the woe of Philomela is compared to the speaker&#x27;s own pain. Sidney also wrote &quot;Arcadia&quot;, which is filled with pastoral descriptions of the landscape. &quot;The Nymph&#x27;s Reply to the Shepherd&quot; (1600) by Sir Walter Raleigh also comments on the anti-pastoral as the nymph responds realistically to the idealizing shepherd of &quot;The Passionate Shepherd to His Love&quot; by embracing and explaining the true course of nature and its incompatibility with the love that the Shepherd yearns for with the nymph. Terry Gifford defined the anti-pastoral in his 2012 essay &quot;Pastoral, Anti-Pastoral and Post-Pastoral as Reading Strategies&quot; as an often explicit correction of pastoral, emphasizing &quot;realism&quot; over romance, highlighting problematic elements (showing tensions, disorder and inequalities), challenging literary constructs as false distortions and demythologizing mythical locations such as Arcadia and Shangri-La.

In the 17th century came the Country house poem. Included in this genre is Emilia Lanier&#x27;s &quot;The Description of Cooke-ham&quot; in 1611, in which a woman is described in terms of her relationship to her estate and how it mourns for her when she leaves it. In 1616, Ben Jonson wrote &quot;To Penshurst,&quot; a poem in which he addresses the estate owned by the Sidney family and tells of its beauty. The basis of the poem is a harmonious and joyous elation of the memories that Jonson had at the manor. It is beautifully written with iambic pentameter, a style that Jonson eloquently uses to describe the culture of Penshurst. It includes Pan and Bacchus as notable company of the manor. Pan, Greek god of the Pastoral world, half man and half goat, was connected with both hunting and shepherds; Bacchus was the god of wine, intoxication and ritual madness. This reference to Pan and Bacchus in a pastoral view demonstrates how prestigious Penshurst was, to be worthy in the company with gods.

&quot;A Country Life&quot;, another 17th-century work by Katherine Philips, was also a country house poem. Philips focuses on the joys of the countryside and looks upon the lifestyle that accompanies it as being &quot;the first and happiest life, when man enjoyed himself.&quot; She writes about maintaining this lifestyle by living detached from material things, and by not over-concerning herself with the world around her. Andrew Marvell&#x27;s &quot;Upon Appleton House&quot; was written when Marvell was working as a tutor for Lord Fairfax&#x27;s daughter Mary, in 1651. The poem is very rich with metaphors that relate to religion, politics and history. Similar to Jonson&#x27;s &quot;To Penshurst&quot;, Marvell&#x27;s poem is describing a pastoral estate. It moves through the house itself, its history, the gardens, the meadows and other grounds, the woods, the river, his Pupil Mary, and the future. Marvell used nature as a thread to weave together a poem centered around man. We once again see nature fully providing for man. Marvell also continuously compares nature to art and seems to point out that art can never accomplish on purpose what nature can achieve accidentally or spontaneously.
Robert Herrick&#x27;s &quot;The Hock-cart, or Harvest Home&quot; was also written in the 17th century. In this pastoral work, he paints the reader a colorful picture of the benefits reaped from hard work. This is an atypical interpretation of the pastoral, given that there is a celebration of labor involved as opposed to central figures living in leisure and nature just taking its course independently. This poem was mentioned in Raymond Williams&#x27;, &quot;The Country and the City&quot;. This acknowledgment of Herrick&#x27;s work is appropriate, as both Williams and Herrick accentuate the importance of labor in the pastoral lifestyle.

The pastoral elegy is a subgenre that uses pastoral elements to lament a death or loss. The most famous pastoral elegy in English is John Milton&#x27;s &quot;Lycidas&quot; (1637), written on the death of Edward King, a fellow student at Cambridge University. Milton used the form both to explore his vocation as a writer and to attack what he saw as the abuses of the Church. Also included is Thomas Gray&#x27;s, &quot;Elegy In a Country Churchyard&quot; (1750).

The formal English pastoral continued to flourish during the 18th century, eventually dying out at the end. One notable example of an 18th-century work is Alexander Pope&#x27;s &quot;Pastorals&quot; (1709). In this work Pope imitates Edmund Spenser&#x27;s &quot;Shepheardes Calendar&quot;, while utilizing classical names and allusions aligning him with Virgil. In 1717, Pope&#x27;s &quot;Discourse on Pastoral Poetry&quot; was published as a preface to &quot;Pastorals.&quot; In this work Pope sets standards for pastoral literature and critiques many popular poets, one of whom is Spenser, along with his contemporary opponent Ambrose Philips. During this time period Ambrose Philips, who is often overlooked because of Pope, modeled his poetry after the native English form of Pastoral, employing it as a medium to express the true nature and longing of Man. He strove to write in this fashion to conform to what he thought was the original intent of Pastoral literature. As such, he centered his themes around the simplistic life of the Shepherd, and, personified the relationship that humans once had with nature. John Gay, who came a little later was criticized for his poem&#x27;s artificiality by Doctor Johnson and attacked for their lack of realism by George Crabbe, who attempted to give a true picture of rural life in his poem &quot;The Village.&quot;

In 1590, Edmund Spenser also composed the famous pastoral epic &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot;, in which he employs the pastoral mode to accentuate the charm, lushness, and splendor of the poem&#x27;s (super)natural world. Spenser alludes to the pastoral continuously throughout the work and also uses it to create allegory in his poem, with the characters as well as with the environment, both of which are meant to have symbolic meaning in the real world. It is of six &#x27;books&#x27; only, though Spenser intended to write twelve. He wrote the poem primarily to honor Queen Elizabeth. William Cowper addressed the artificiality of the fast-paced city life in his poems &quot;Retirement&quot; (1782) and &quot;The Winter Nosegay&quot; (1782). Pastoral nevertheless survived as a mood rather than a genre, as can be seen from such works as Matthew Arnold&#x27;s &quot;Thyrsis&quot; (1867), a lament on the death of his fellow poet Arthur Hugh Clough. Robert Burns can be read as a Pastoral poet for his nostalgic portrayals of rural Scotland and simple farm life in &quot;To A Mouse&quot; and &quot;The Cotter&#x27;s Saturday Night&quot;. Burns explicitly addresses the Pastoral form in his &quot;Poem on Pastoral Poetry&quot;. In this he champions his fellow Scot Allan Ramsey as the best Pastoral poet since Theocritus.

Another subgenre is the Edenic Pastoral, which alludes to the perfect relationship between God, man, and nature in the Garden of Eden. It typically includes biblical symbols and imagery. In 1645 John Milton wrote &quot;L&#x27;Allegro&quot;, which translates as the happy person. It is a celebration of Mirth personified, who is the child of love and revelry. It was originally composed to be a companion poem to, &quot;Il Penseroso&quot;, which celebrates a life of melancholy and solitude. Milton&#x27;s, &quot;On the Morning of Christ&#x27;s Nativity&quot; (1629) blends Christian and pastoral imagery.

====Pastoral epic====
Milton is perhaps best known for his epic &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;, one of the few Pastoral epics ever written. A notable part of Paradise Lost is book IV where he chronicles Satan&#x27;s trespass into paradise. Milton&#x27;s iconic descriptions of the garden are shadowed by the fact that we see it from Satan&#x27;s perspective and are thus led to commiserate with him. Milton elegantly works through a presentation of Adam and Eve’s pastorally idyllic, eternally fertile living conditions and focuses upon their stewardship of the garden. He gives much focus to the fruit bearing trees and Adam and Eve&#x27;s care of them, sculpting an image of pastoral harmony. However, Milton in turn continually comes back to Satan, constructing him as a character the audience can easily identify with and perhaps even like. Milton creates Satan as character meant to destabilize the audience’s understanding of themselves and the world around them. Through this mode, Milton is able to create a working dialogue between the text and his audience about the ‘truths’ they hold for themselves.

===Pastoral romances===
Italian writers invented a new genre, the pastoral romance, which mixed pastoral poems with a fictional narrative in prose. Although there was no classical precedent for the form, it drew some inspiration from ancient Greek novels set in the countryside, such as &quot;Daphnis and Chloe&quot;. The most influential Italian example of the form was Sannazzaro&#x27;s &quot;Arcadia&quot; (1504). The vogue for the pastoral romance spread throughout Europe producing such notable works as Bernardim Ribeiro &quot;Menina e Moça&quot; (1554) in Portuguese, Montemayor&#x27;s &quot;Diana&quot; (1559) in Spain, Sir Philip Sidney&#x27;s &quot;Arcadia&quot; (1590) in England, and Honoré d&#x27;Urfé&#x27;s &quot;Astrée&quot; (1607–27) in France.

===Pastoral plays===

Pastoral drama also emerged in Renaissance Italy. Again, there was little Classical precedent, with the possible exception of Greek satyr plays. Poliziano&#x27;s &quot;Orfeo&quot; (1480) shows the beginnings of the new form, but it reached its zenith in the late 16th century with Tasso&#x27;s &quot;Aminta&quot; (1573), Isabella Andreini&#x27;s &quot;Mirtilla&quot; (1588), and Guarini&#x27;s &quot;Il pastor fido&quot; (1590). John Lyly&#x27;s &quot;Endimion&quot; (1579) brought the Italian-style pastoral play to England. John Fletcher&#x27;s &quot;The Faithful Shepherdess&quot;, Ben Jonson&#x27;s &quot;The Sad Shepherd&quot; and Sidney&#x27;s &quot;The Lady of May&quot; are later examples. Some of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays contain pastoral elements, most notably &quot;As You Like It&quot; (whose plot was derived from Thomas Lodge&#x27;s pastoral romance &quot;Rosalynde&quot;) and &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot;, of which Act 4 Scene 4 is a lengthy pastoral digression.

The forest in &quot;As You Like It&quot; can be seen as a place of pastoral idealization, where life is simpler and purer, and its inhabitants live more closely to each other, nature and God than their urban counterparts. However, Shakespeare plays with the bounds of pastoral idealization. Throughout the play, Shakespeare employs various characters to illustrate pastoralism. His protagonists Rosalind and Orlando metaphorically depict the importance of the coexistence of realism and idealism, or urban and rural life. While Orlando is absorbed in the ideal, Rosalind serves as a mediator, bringing Orlando back down to reality and embracing the simplicity of pastoral love. She is the only character throughout the play who embraces and appreciates both the real and idealized life and manages to make the two ideas coexist. Therefore, Shakespeare explores city and country life as being appreciated through the coexistence of the two.

===Pastoral science fiction===
Pastoral science fiction is a subgenre of science fiction which uses bucolic, rural settings, like other forms of pastoral literature. Since it is a subgenre of science fiction, authors may set stories either on Earth or another habitable planet or moon, sometimes including a terraformed planet or moon. Unlike most genres of science fiction, pastoral science fiction works downplay the role of futuristic technologies. In the 1950s and 1960s, Clifford Simak wrote stories about rural people who have contact with extraterrestrial beings who hide their alien identity.

Pastoral science fiction stories typically show a reverence for the land, its life-giving food harvests, the cycle of the seasons, and the role of the community. While fertile agrarian environments on Earth or Earth-like planets are common settings, some works may be set in ocean or desert planets or habitable moons. The rural dwellers, such as farmers and small-townspeople, are depicted sympathetically, albeit with the tendency to portray them as conservative and suspicious of change. The simple, peaceful rural life is often contrasted with the negative aspects of noisy, dirty, fast-paced cities. Some works take a Luddite tone, criticizing mechanization and industrialization and showing the ills of urbanization and over-reliance on advanced technologies.

===Post-pastoral, urban pastoral and other variants===

In 1994, British literature professor Terry Gifford proposed the concept of a &quot;post-pastoral&quot; subgenre. By appending the prefix &quot;post-&quot;, Gifford does not intend this to refer to “after” but rather 
to the sense of “reaching beyond” the contraints of the pastoral genre, but while continuing the core conceptual elements that have defined the pastoral tradition. Gifford states that the post-pastoral is &quot;best used to describe works that successfully suggest a collapse of the human/nature divide whilst being aware of the problematics involved&quot;, noting that it is &quot;more about connection than the disconnections essential to the pastoral&quot;. He gives examples of post-pastoral works, including Cormac McCarthy’s &quot;The Road&quot; (2006), Margaret Atwood’s &quot;The Year of the Flood&quot; (2009) and Maggie Gee’s &quot;The Ice People&quot; (1999), and he points out that these works &quot;raise questions of ethics, sustenance and sustainability that might exemplify [Leo] Marx’s vision of the pastoral needing to find new forms in the face of new conditions&quot;.

Gifford states that British eco-critics such as Greg Garrard have used the &quot;post-pastoral&quot; concept, as well as two other variants: &quot;gay pastoral&quot;, the seemingly contradictory &quot;urban pastoral&quot; and &quot;radical pastoral&quot;. Gifford lists further examples of pastoral variants, which he calls &quot;prefix-pastoral[s]&quot;: &quot;postmodern pastoral...hard pastoral, soft pastoral, Buell’s revolutionary lesbian feminist pastoral, black pastoral, ghetto pastoral, frontier pastoral, militarized pastoral, domestic pastoral and, most recently, a specifically ‘Irish pastoral&#x27;&quot;.

In 2014, &quot;The Cambridge Companion to the City in Literature&quot; had a chapter on the urban pastoral subgenre. 

==Pastoral music==

Theocritus&#x27;s &quot;Idylls&quot; include strophic songs and musical laments, and, as in Homer, his shepherds often play the syrinx, or pan flute, which is considered a quintessentially pastoral instrument. Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Eclogues&quot; were performed as sung mime in the 1st century, and there is evidence of the pastoral song as a legitimate genre of classical times.

The pastoral genre was a significant influence in the development of opera. After settings of pastoral poetry in the pastourelle genre by the troubadours, Italian poets and composers became increasingly drawn to the pastoral. Musical settings of pastoral poetry became increasingly common in first polyphonic and then monodic madrigals: these later led to the cantata and the serenata, in which pastoral themes remained on a consistent basis. Partial musical settings of Giovanni Battista Guarini&#x27;s &quot;Il pastor fido&quot; were highly popular: the texts of over 500 madrigals were taken from this one play alone. Tasso&#x27;s &quot;Aminta&quot; was also a favourite. As opera developed, the dramatic pastoral came to the fore with such works as Jacopo Peri&#x27;s &quot;Dafne&quot; and, most notably, Monteverdi&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Orfeo&quot;. Pastoral opera remained popular throughout the 17th-century, and not just in Italy, as is shown by the French genre of &quot;pastorale héroïque&quot;, Englishman Henry Lawes&#x27;s music for Milton&#x27;s &quot;Comus&quot; (not to mention John Blow&#x27;s &quot;Venus and Adonis&quot;), and Spanish zarzuela. At the same time, Italian and German composers developed a genre of vocal and instrumental pastorals, distinguished by certain stylistic features, associated with Christmas Eve.

The pastoral, and parodies of the pastoral, continued to play an important role in musical history throughout the 18th and 19th centuries. John Gay may have satirized the pastoral in &quot;The Beggar&#x27;s Opera&quot;, but also wrote an entirely sincere libretto for Handel&#x27;s &quot;Acis and Galatea&quot;. Rousseau&#x27;s &quot;Le Devin du village&quot; draws on pastoral roots, and Metastasio&#x27;s libretto &quot;Il re pastore&quot; was set over 30 times, most famously by Mozart. Rameau was an outstanding exponent of French pastoral opera. Beethoven also wrote his famous Pastoral Symphony, avoiding his usual musical dynamism in favour of relatively slow rhythms. More concerned with psychology than description, he labelled the work &quot;more the expression of feeling than [realistic] painting&quot;. The pastoral also appeared as a feature of grand opera, most particularly in Meyerbeer&#x27;s operas: often composers would develop a pastoral-themed &quot;oasis&quot;, usually in the centre of their work. Notable examples include the shepherd&#x27;s &quot;alte Weise&quot; from Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot;, or the pastoral ballet occupying the middle of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;The Queen of Spades&quot;. The 20th-century continued to bring new pastoral interpretations, particularly in ballet, such as Ravel&#x27;s &quot;Daphis and Chloe&quot;, Nijinsky&#x27;s use of Debussy&#x27;s &quot;Prélude à l&#x27;après-midi d&#x27;un faune&quot;, and Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;Le sacre du printemps&quot; and &quot;Les Noces&quot;.

The Pastorale is a form of Italian folk song still played in the regions of Southern Italy where the zampogna continues to thrive. They generally sound like a slowed down version of a tarantella, as they encompass many of the same melodic phrases. The pastorale on the zampogna can be played by a solo zampogna player, or in some regions can be accompanied by the piffero (also commonly called a ciaramella, &#x27;pipita&#x27;, or bifora), which is a primitive key-less double reed oboe type instrument.

==Pastoral art==
Idealised pastoral landscapes appear in Hellenistic and Roman wall paintings. Interest in the pastoral as a subject for art revived in Renaissance Italy, partly inspired by the descriptions of pictures Jacopo Sannazaro included in his &quot;Arcadia&quot;. The &quot;Pastoral Concert&quot; in the Louvre attributed to Giorgione or Titian is perhaps the most famous painting in this style. Later, French artists were also attracted to the pastoral, notably Claude, Poussin (e.g., Et in Arcadia ego) and Watteau (in his &quot;Fêtes galantes&quot;). The Fête champêtre, with scenes of country people dancing was a popular subject in Flemish painting. Thomas Cole has a series of paintings titled &quot;The Course of Empire&quot;, and the second of these paintings (shown on the right) depicts the perfect pastoral setting.

== Religious usage ==

=== In Christianity ===
Pastoral imagery and symbolism feature heavily in Christianity and the Bible. Jesus calls himself the &quot;Good Shepherd&quot; in , contrasting his role as the Lamb of God.

Many Christian denominations use the title &quot;Pastor&quot;, a word rooted in the Biblical metaphor of shepherding. (&quot;Pastor&quot; in Latin means &quot;shepherd&quot;). The Hebrew Bible (or Old Testament) uses the Hebrew word (&quot;roʿeh&quot;), which is used as a noun as in &quot;shepherd&quot;, and as a verb as in &quot;to tend a flock.&quot; It occurs 173 times in 144 Old Testament verses and relates to the literal feeding of sheep, as in Genesis 29:7. In Jeremiah 23:4, both meanings are used (&quot;ro&#x27;im&quot; is used for &quot;shepherds&quot; and &quot;yir&#x27;um&quot; for &quot;shall feed them&quot;), &quot;And I will set up shepherds over them which shall feed them: and they shall fear no more, nor be dismayed, neither shall they be lacking, saith the LORD.&quot; (KJV).

A pastoral economic system had great cultural significance for the Jewish people from earliest recorded times: Abraham herded flocks. Throughout the biblical accounts of the Children of Israel, a pastoral lifestyle in the harsh hinterland of the Levant related to the ideal of a society obedient to Yahweh, in contrast to the corruption and idolatry encountered in the &quot;fleshpots of Egypt&quot; (Exodus 16:3), in the lush Canaanite lowlands &quot;flowing with milk and honey&quot; (Exodus 3:8), or in Babylon, the &quot;great city&quot; of Israelite exile. David, a righteous shepherd-boy associated with the arid hill-country, contrasts with Goliath and Saul, representatives of luxurious urban élites. Thus New Testament imagery of shepherds and their sheep builds on established cultural and economic distinctions familiar, directly or indirectly, to the Jewish world at the time of the origins of Christianity in the first century CE.

A pastoral letter, often called simply a pastoral, is an open letter addressed by a bishop to the clergy or laity of a diocese or to both, containing general admonition, instruction or consolation, or directions for behavior in particular circumstances. In most episcopal church bodies, clerics are often required to read out pastoral letters of superior bishops to their congregations.

The pastoral epistles are a group of three books of the canonical New Testament: the First Epistle to Timothy (1 Timothy) the Second Epistle to Timothy (2 Timothy), and the Epistle to Titus. They are presented as letters from Paul the Apostle to Timothy and to Titus. They are generally discussed as a group (sometimes with the addition of the Epistle to Philemon) and are given the title &quot;pastoral&quot; because they are addressed to individuals with pastoral oversight of churches and discuss issues of Christian living, doctrine and leadership.

==Pastoral theory==
In the past four hundred years, a range of writers have worked on theorizing the nature of pastoral. These include Friedrich Schiller, George Puttenham, William Empson, Frank Kermode, Raymond Williams, Renato Poggioli, Annabel Patterson, Paul Alpers, and Ken Hiltner. George Puttenham was one of the first Pastoral theorists. He did not see the form as merely a recording of a prior rustic way of life but a guise for political discourse, which other forms had previously neglected. The Pastoral, he writes, has a didactic duty to “contain and enforme morall discipline for the amendment of mans behaviour”.

Friedrich Schiller linked the Pastoral to childhood and a childlike simplicity. For Schiller, we perceive in nature an “image of our infancy irrevocably past”. Sir William Empson spoke of the ideal of Pastoral as being embedded in varying degrees of ambivalence, and yet, for all the apparent dichotomies, and contradicting elements found within it, he felt there was a unified harmony within it. He refers to the pastoral process as &#x27;putting the complex into the simple.&#x27; Empson argues that &quot;... good proletarian art is usually Covert Pastoral&quot;, and uses Soviet Russia&#x27;s propaganda about the working class as evidence. Empson also emphasizes the importance of the double plot as a tool for writers to discuss a controversial topic without repercussions.

Raymond Williams argues that the foundation of the pastoral lies in the idea that the city is a highly urban, industrialized center that has removed us from the peaceful life we once had in the countryside. However, he states that this is really a &quot;myth functioning as a memory&quot; that literature has created in its representations of the past. As a result, when society evolves and looks back to these representations, it considers its own present as the decline of the simple life of the past. He then discusses how the city&#x27;s relationship with the country affected the economic and social aspects of the countryside. As the economy became a bigger part of society, many country newcomers quickly realized the potential and monetary value that lay in the untouched land. Furthermore, this new system encouraged a social stratification in the countryside. With the implementation of paper money came a hierarchy in the working system, as well as the &quot;inheritance of titles and making of family names&quot;.

Poggioli was concerned with how death reconciled itself with the pastoral, and thus came up with a loose categorization of death in the pastoral as &#x27;funeral elegy&#x27;, the most important tropes of which he cites as religion (embodied by Pan); friendship; allegory;and poetic and musical calling. He concedes though that such a categorization is open to much misinterpretation. As well, Poggioli focused on the idea that Pastoral was a nostalgic and childish way of seeing the world. In &quot;The Oaten Flue&quot;, he claims that the shepherd was looked up to was because they were “an ideal kind of leisure class.&quot;

Frank Kermode discusses the pastoral within the historical context of the English Renaissance. His first condition of pastoral poetry is that it is an urban product. Kermode establishes that the pastoral is derived as an opposition between two modes of living, in the country and in the city. London was becoming a modern metropolis before the eyes of its citizens. The result of this large-scale urban sprawl left the people with a sense of nostalgia for their country way of living. His next argument focuses on the artificiality of poetry, drawing upon fellow theorist, Puttenham.

Kermode elaborates on this and says, &quot;the cultivated, in their artificial way, reflect upon and describe, for their own ends, the natural life&quot;. Kermode wants us to understand that the recreation or reproduction of the natural is in itself artificial. Kermode elaborates on this in terms of imitation, describing it as &quot;one of the fundamental laws of literary history&quot; because it &quot;gives literary history a meaning in terms of itself, and provides the channels of literary tradition&quot;. Kermode goes on to explain about the works of Virgil and Theocritus as progenitors of the pastoral. Later poets would draw on these earlier forms of pastoral, elaborating on them to fit their own social context. As the pastoral was becoming more modern, it shifted into the form of Pastourelle. This is the first time that the pastoral really deals with the subject of love.

Annabel Patterson emphasizes many important ideas in her work, Pastoral and Ideology. One of these is that the pastoral mode, especially in the later 18th century, was interpreted in vastly different ways by different groups of people. As a result, distinctive illustrations emerged from these groups which were all variations of the understanding of Virgil&#x27;s Eclogues. Patterson explains that Servius&#x27; Commentary is essential to understanding the reception of Virgil&#x27;s Eclogues. The commentary discusses how poets used analogy in their writings to indirectly express the corruption within the church and government to the public. When speaking of post-Romanticism, it is imperative to take into consideration the influence and effect of Robert Frost on pastoral ideology. His poem, &quot;Build Soil&quot; is a critique of war and also a suggestion that pastoral, as a literary mode, should not place emphasis on social and political issues, but should rather, as Patterson says, &quot;turn in upon itself, and replace reformist instincts with personal growth and regeneration&quot;. William Wordsworth was a highly respected poet in the 1800s and his poem, &quot;Prelude,&quot; published in 1805, was an excellent example of what a dream of a new golden age might materialize as or look like.

Paul Alpers, in his 1996 book, &quot;What is Pastoral?&quot;, describes the recurring plot of pastoral literature as the lives of shepherds. With William Empson&#x27;s notion of placing the complex into the simple, Alpers thus critically defines pastoral as a means of allegory. Alpers also classifies pastoral as a mode of literature, as opposed to a genre, and he defines the attitude of pastoral works maintaining a humble relationship with nature. Alpers also defines pastoral convention as the act of bringing together, and authors use this to discuss loss. He says the speakers in pastoral works are simple herdsmen dramatized in pastoral encounters.

However, authors like Herrick changed the herdsmen to nymphs, maidens, and flowers. Thus, achieving a mode of simplicity but also giving objects voice. This is done by personifying objects like flowers. Moreover, authors that do this in their works are giving importance to the unimportant. Alpers talks about pastoral lyrics and love poems in particular. He says &quot;a lyric allows its speaker to slip in and out of pastoral guise and reveal directly the sophistication which prompted him to assume it in the first place″. In other words, he claims pastorals lyrics have both pastoral and not pastoral characteristics, perhaps like in the comparisons between urban and rural, but they always give importance to and enhance on the pastoral. Alpers talks about love poems and how they can be turned into pastoral poems simply by changing words like lover to shepherd. And he mentions Shakespeare as one of the authors who did this in his works. Furthermore, Alpers says the pastoral is not only about praise for the rural and the country side. For instance, Sidney dispraises the country life in &quot;The Garden&quot;. Pastoral can also include the urban, the court, and the social like in &quot;L’Allegro&quot;.

Alpers says that pastoral narration contradicts “normal” narrative motives and that there is a double aspect of pastoral narration: heroic poetry and worldly realities with narrative motives and conventions. And in respect to pastoral novels, Alpers says pastoral novels have different definitions and examples depending on the reader. Also, the pastoral novel differs from Theocritus and Virgil&#x27;s works. He says there are pastoral novels of the country life, of the longing for the simple, and with nature as the protagonist. And says the literary category of pastoral novels is realistic and post-realistic fiction with a rural theme or subject based on traditional pastoral.

In &quot;What Else Is Pastoral?&quot;, Ken Hiltner argues that Renaissance pastoral poetry is more often a form of nature writing than critics like Paul Alpers and Annabel Patterson give it credit for. He explains that even though there is a general lack of lavish description in Renaissance pastoral, this is because they were beginning to use gestural strategies, and artists begin to develop an environmental consciousness as nature around them becomes endangered. Another argument presented in the book is that our current environmental crisis clearly has its roots in the Renaissance. To do this we are shown examples in Renaissance pastoral poetry that show a keen awareness of the urban sprawl of London contrasted to the countryside and historical records showing that many at the time were aware of the issue of urban growth and attempted to stop it.

<text>The Eurasian nuthatch or wood nuthatch (Sitta europaea) is a small passerine bird found throughout the Palearctic and in Europe. Like other nuthatches, it is a short-tailed bird with a long bill, blue-gray upperparts and a black eye-stripe. It is a vocal bird with a repeated loud &quot;dwip&quot; call. There are more than 20 subspecies in three main groups; birds in the west of the range have orange-buff underparts and a white throat, those in Russia have whitish underparts, and those in the east have a similar appearance to European birds, but lack the white throat.

Its preferred habitat is mature deciduous or mixed woodland with large, old trees, preferably oak. Pairs hold permanent territories, and nest in tree holes, usually old woodpecker nests, but sometimes natural cavities. If the entrance to the hole is too large, the female plasters it with mud to reduce its size, and often coats the inside of the cavity too. The six to nine red-speckled white eggs are laid on a deep base of pine or other wood chips.

The Eurasian nuthatch eats mainly insects, particularly caterpillars and beetles, although in autumn and winter its diet is supplemented with nuts and seeds. The young are fed mainly on insects, with some seeds, food items mainly being found on tree trunks and large branches. The nuthatch can forage when descending trees head first, as well as when climbing. It readily visits bird tables, eating fatty man-made food items as well as seeds. It is an inveterate hoarder, storing food year-round. Its main natural predator is the Eurasian sparrowhawk.

Fragmentation of woodland can lead to local losses of breeding birds, but the species&#x27;s range is still expanding. It has a large population and huge breeding area, and is therefore classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as being of least concern.

==Taxonomy==
The nuthatches are a family of similar-looking birds with short tails and wings, compact bodies and longish pointed bills. They have grey or bluish upperparts, a black eyestripe and strong feet. All are in the single genus &quot;Sitta&quot;. Within the genus, the Eurasian nuthatch forms a superspecies with the chestnut-vented, Indian, chestnut-bellied and Kashmir nuthatches and has in the past been considered conspecific with all of these.

The Eurasian nuthatch was described by Carl Linnaeus in his landmark 1758 10th edition of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under its current scientific name. &quot;Sitta&quot; is derived from the Ancient Greek name for this bird, , &quot;sittē&quot;, and the species name, &quot;europaea&quot;, is Latin for &quot;European&quot;. &quot;Nuthatch&quot;, first recorded in 1350, is derived from &quot;nut&quot; and a word probably related to &quot;hack&quot;, since these birds hack at nuts they have wedged into crevices.

In 2014, Eric Pasquet and colleagues published a phylogeny based on examination of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA of 21 nuthatch species. The group &quot;europaea&quot; is related to the two nuthatches of rocky environments, the Western rock nuthatch (&quot;S. neumayer&quot;) and the Eastern rock nuthatch (&quot;S. tephronota&quot;), and these two clades diverge from each other by thirteen million years. Within the group &quot;europaea&quot;, the white-tailed nuthatch (&quot;S. himalayensis&quot;)—and consequently the white-browed nuthatch (&quot;S. victoriae&quot;), although not included in the study—appears to be basal, and the Eurasian nuthatch is closely related to the chestnut-vented nuthatch (&quot;S. nagaensis&quot;) and the Kashmir nuthatch (&quot;S. cashmirensis&quot;). The Indian Nuthatch (&quot;S. castanea&quot;), the Beautiful nuthatch (&quot;S. cinnamoventris&quot;), the Burmese nuthatch (&quot;S. neglecta&quot;), and the Siberian nuthatch (&quot;S. arctica&quot;) are not included in the study. All the species of the group &quot;europaea&quot; masonry the entrance to their nests. In 2020, a new phylogeny will appear, covering the genus more exhaustively; it includes, in particular, the four species mentioned above. It uses three mitochondrial genes and two nuclear ones. The three species from the south of the Asian continent (Indian, Beautiful and Burmese nuthatches) are related to the Kashmir nuthatch, but surprisingly, the Siberian nuthatch is located on a clean branch, quite distant from the Eurasian nuthatch, from which it was nevertheless long considered a subspecies.

The study by Päckert and colleagues (2020) also includes a fairly exhaustive sampling of the Eurasian nuthatch subspecies. It highlights three large groups of subspecies, not perfectly overlapping with the traditionally distinguished groups on the basis of the coloring of their lower parts. A first group concerns the &quot;European nuthatch&quot;, which includes all the European subspecies, whether buff-bellied or white-bellied, as well as the subspecies of the Near East. It is related to the group of the &quot;Asian Nuthatch&quot;, including the subspecies inhabiting the northern part of the Asian continent, from Kazakhstan to Korea and Japan, all white-bellied. Finally, a third group of subspecies, the &quot;Eastern nuthatch,&quot; includes the Asian subspecies living further south, in North and East China and in Taiwan.

The fossil record for nuthatches is sparse, and in Europe is limited to the extinct &quot;Sitta senogalliensis&quot; from the Lower Miocene in Italy and somewhat later material from France; the family appears to be of relatively recent origin.

===Subspecies===
There are more than 20 subspecies, but the precise number is disputed. These taxa can be divided into three main groups; these may have been geographically isolated from each other until relatively recently. Birds of intermediate appearance occur where the group ranges overlap.

The large, white-breasted &quot;S. e. arctica&quot; of north east Siberia is distinctive in appearance and genetically, and may be another subspecies group or even a separate species.

==Description==


The adult male of the nominate subspecies, &quot;S. e. europaea&quot; is long with a wingspan. It weighs . It has blue-grey upperparts, a black eye-stripe and whitish throat and underparts. The flanks and lower belly are orange-red, mottled with white on the undertail. The stout bill is dark grey with a paler area on the base of the lower mandible, the iris is dark brown and the legs and feet are pale brown or greyish. Most other members of the &quot;S. e. europaea&quot; group differ only in detail from the nominate form, often with respect to the hue of the underparts, but &quot;S. e. arctica&quot; is quite distinctive. It is large, pale, has a white forehead and a reduced eye-stripe, and it has more white in the tail and wings than any other subspecies. Nuthatches move on trees with short leaps, and do not use their tails for support. In flight, they have a characteristic appearance, with a pointed head, round wings and a short, square tail. Their flight is fast, with wings closed between beats, and is usually of short duration.

&quot;S. e. caesia&quot;, the most widespread of the western subspecies, has orange-buff underparts except for a white throat and cheeks. The other western forms mainly differ in the exact shade of the underparts, although some southeastern forms also show a white forehead and supercilium. &quot;S. e. sinensis&quot; and &quot;S. e. formosana&quot;, of China and Taiwan respectively, have buff underparts like the western races, but have buff, instead of white, throats.

The female is similar in appearance to the male, but may be identified by her slightly paler upperparts, a browner eyestripe and a more washed-out tone to the flanks and lower belly. In the eastern form, &quot;S. e. asiatica&quot;, some males have buff underparts like the female, and birds with this appearance are difficult to sex in the field. Young birds resemble the female, although their plumage is duller and they have paler legs. Individuals can be reliably sexed as female from about 12 days old by their paler and buffer flanks, or, in some white-breasted subspecies, by the creamier hue of their underparts.

Adults have a complete moult after breeding which takes about 80 days, starting from late May onwards and finishing by late September. The moult period for Siberian birds is more compressed, running from June to mid-September. Fledged juveniles moult some of their wing coverts when they are about eight weeks old.

In much of its range, Eurasian is the only nuthatch present. In southeast Europe and southwest Asia, the western and eastern rock nuthatches are larger and paler than the Eurasian species. They also lack white spots in the tail and are usually found in a different, stony habitat, and Krüper&#x27;s nuthatch is small and has a black cap and reddish breast patch. In southwest China, the chestnut-vented nuthatch is very similar to the European bird, but is darker above, has less white on the face and has greyer underparts.

=== Similar species ===
In most of its range, the Eurasian nuthatch is the only nuthatch present. In Southeast Europe and Western Asia, the Eastern rock nuthatch (&quot;S. tephronota&quot;) and the Western rock nuthatch (&quot;S. neumayer&quot;) inhabit rocky environments and are larger and paler than species. Eurasian species do not have white dots on their tails. In the same area, the Krüper&#x27;s nuthatch (&quot;S. krueperi&quot;) is smaller, with a dark crown and a large russet patch on the breast. In southwest China, the chestnut-vented nuthatch (&quot;S. nagaensis&quot;) is very similar to the torchepot, but has darker upperparts, less white on the face, and more greyish underparts. The Siberian nuthatch (&quot;S. arctica&quot;) was once considered a subspecies of the Eurasian nuthatch but differs quite clearly from it, being larger, pale, with a shorter and thinner eye line, a longer bill and a straighter culmen, and more white in the tail than any other subspecies.

===Voice===
The Eurasian nuthatch calls frequently, usually with a loud, sharp &quot;dwip&quot; normally repeated twice, sometimes more often if excited. It has a shrill &quot; sirrrr&quot; or &quot;tsi-si-si&quot; alarm call, and a thin &quot;tsit&quot; pre-flight call. The song is a slow whistled &quot;pee-pee-pee&quot; with many variants, including a faster version, and may be intermingled with the call.

The song of the distinctive &quot;S. e. arctica&quot; is said to be noticeably different from that of its relatives, which would help to establish whether it is a full species, but there has been insufficient research into its vocalizations.

==Distribution and habitat==
The Eurasian nuthatch&#x27;s breeding range extends across temperate Eurasia from Great Britain (but not Ireland) to Japan. It is found between the July isotherms, north to about latitude 64°N in western Russia and 69°N in Siberia. It breeds south to the Mediterranean in Europe, although it is absent from the islands, other than Sicily, and in most of Russia the southern boundary is around 54–55°N. In the east, the range includes most of China and Taiwan and much of Korea. It has occurred as a vagrant in Lebanon and the Channel Islands, and the nominate race has been recorded a few times in Finland where &quot;S. e. asiatica&quot; is the normal form.

Most populations are sedentary, apart from some post-breeding dispersal of young birds, and there is a reluctance to cross even short stretches of open water. Northern and eastern breeders are dependent on the cones of the Siberian stone pine, and if the crop fails many birds of the &quot;S. e. asiatica&quot; subspecies may move west into northern Sweden and Finland in autumn, sometimes staying to breed. Siberian &quot;S. e. arctica&quot; may make more limited movements south and east in winter, and &quot;S. e. amurensis&quot;, from southeast Russia, is regular in winter in Korea.

The preferred habitat is mature woodland with large, old trees, which provide extensive growth for foraging and nesting holes. In Europe, deciduous or mixed forest is favoured, particularly when containing oak. Parks, old orchards and other wooded habitats may be occupied as long as they have at least a block of suitable trees. Particularly in mountains, old spruce and pine forests are used, and pine is also favoured in Taiwan. In most of Russia, conifers are used for nesting, but population densities are relatively low. Moroccan birds nest in oak, Atlas cedar and fir. Unusual habitats include dwarf juniper in Mongolia and rocky terrain in a limited part of southern Siberia.

The Eurasian nuthatch is primarily a lowland bird in the north of its range, but reaches the tree-line in Switzerland, at or higher, and breeds occasionally at in Austria. It breeds at similar levels in the mountains of Turkey, the Middle East and Central Asia. It is mainly a mountain bird in southern Japan, , and Taiwan, , but in southern China, the chestnut-vented nuthatch is the highland species, with the Eurasian species at lower levels.

==Behaviour==

===Breeding===
Nuthatches are monogamous, and a pair occupies a breeding territory in which it spends the winter as well. Territory sizes range from in Europe to an average of in the sub-optimal conifer forests of Siberia. The male sings to defend his territory and attract a mate. Both sexes have a courtship display with a floating, quivering flight, and the male will also make circular flights with a spread tail and raised head. He will also feed the female while courting her. Despite the lifelong pairing, genetic research in Germany showed that at least 10% of the young in the study area were fathered by another male, usually from an adjacent territory.

The nest is in a tree cavity, usually an old woodpecker hole, but sometimes of natural origin. Occasionally the female will enlarge an existing hole in rotten wood. The nest site is typically above the ground and has a deep base of pine bark or chips of other wood, rarely supplemented with dry plant material. If the entrance to the hole is too large, it is plastered with mud, clay and sometimes dung to make it smaller. A small entrance and large interior, together with the use of a deep layer of wood chips in which to bury the eggs and small young when the adults leave the nest, may be adaptations to reduce the chance of predation. Nests with small entrance holes are most successful. Locally, a small entrance may make it less likely that the nest will be taken over by common starlings. The female undertakes most of the work, and often plasters the inside of the cavity too, taking up to four weeks to complete the construction. A nest is often re-used in subsequent years.

The clutch is usually 6–9 red-speckled white eggs, although up to 13 eggs are sometimes laid. They average and weigh of which 6% is shell. The female incubates the eggs for 13–18 days to hatching, and broods the altricial downy chicks until they fledge 20–26 days later. Both adults feed the chicks in the nest and continue after they fledge until they become independent in about 8–14 days. Normally only one brood is raised each year. When nest boxes are used, the clutch size and number of fledglings are greater in larger boxes. For reasons that are unclear, there is no link between cavity size and nesting outcomes for natural holes.

The sedentary nature of this species means that juveniles can only acquire a territory by finding a vacant area or replacing a dead adult. In Europe, young birds almost always move to unoccupied habitat, but in the larger territories of Siberia most live within the breeding range of an adult pair.

The adult annual survival rate across most of the range is around 51%, and a small Belgian study found a 25% local survival rate for juveniles. The typical lifespan is two years and the maximum known age for a wild bird is 12 years 11 months in the UK. There is also a Swiss longevity record of 10 years 6 months.

===Feeding===

The Eurasian nuthatch eats mainly insects, particularly caterpillar and beetles. In autumn and winter, the diet is supplemented with nuts and seeds, hazel nuts and beech mast being preferred. The young are fed mainly on the insects favoured by their parents, with some seeds. Food items are found mainly on tree trunks and large branches, but smaller branches may also be investigated, and food may be taken from the ground, especially outside the breeding season. Nuthatches can forage when descending trees head first, as well as when climbing. Some prey is caught in flight, and a nuthatch will remove bark or rotten wood to reach insects, although it cannot chisel into healthy wood like a woodpecker. A pair may temporarily join a mixed-species foraging flock as it passes near their territory. The Eurasian nuthatch readily visits bird tables and bird feeders in winter, eating human-made food items such as fat, cheese, butter and bread. It has even been recorded as taking slaughterhouse offal. Sizeable hard food items like nuts or large insects are wedged into crevices in tree bark and smashed with the strong bill.

Plant food is stored year-round, but mainly in autumn. Individual seeds are hidden in cracks in bark, occasionally in walls or in the ground. The food item is usually concealed with lichen, moss or small pieces of bark. The cached food is retrieved in cold weather. Siberian birds store the seeds of the Siberian stone pine, sometimes hoarding enough to last a whole year. Cached food may sometimes include non-plant material such as pieces of bread, caterpillars and grubs, the larvae being incapacitated by battering. Hoarding is a long-term strategy, stored food items only being consumed when fresh food is hard to find, sometimes up to three months after caching. Birds with good stored food supplies are fitter than those with more limited resources. Beech mast crops vary widely from year to year. Where beech mast is an important part of the diet, adult survival rates are largely unaffected in years with a poor mast crop, but the number of juvenile birds falls in the autumn as they are lost through starvation or emigration. In areas where common hazel is the prevalent tree species, there is a similar pattern of adult survival and loss of juvenile birds in years with poor nut production.

===Predators and parasites===
Across most of its European range, the most important predator of the Eurasian nuthatch is the sparrowhawk. Other species known to prey on this nuthatch include the northern goshawk, hobby, tawny owl, pygmy owl and least weasel. A Swedish study showed that 6.2% of the nuthatch nests in their study area were raided by predators. The perpetrators were not identified, but the main single predator of tit nests in the same study was the great spotted woodpecker.

Common starlings will take over Eurasian nuthatch nest holes, reducing their breeding success. This is most likely to occur if the nest is high in a tree and there is a good local breeding density of the nuthatch. Introduced ring-necked parakeets may also compete with Eurasian nuthatches for nesting holes. The parakeets tend to occur in fragmented urban woodlands, while nuthatches prefer large old oak woodlands, which reduces the level of competition. Ornithologists conducting a 2010 Belgian study suggested that the problem was not so severe as to warrant culling of the parakeets.

Mites of the genus &quot;Ptilonyssus&quot;, such as &quot;P. sittae&quot;, have been found in the Eurasian nuthatch&#x27;s nasal cavities. Intestinal worms include the nematodes &quot;Tridentocapillaria parusi&quot; and &quot;Pterothominx longifilla&quot;. Small studies in Slovakia and Spain found no blood parasites, but a larger Spanish survey found some evidence of &quot;Plasmodium&quot; infection.

==Status==

The European population of the Eurasian nuthatch has been estimated as 22.5–57 million birds, suggesting a global total of 45.9–228 million individuals. China, Taiwan, Korea, Japan and Russia each have between 10,000 and 100,000 breeding pairs. The known breeding area is about 23.3 million km2 (9 million sq mi), which is a large proportion of the potential suitable habitat, and the population appears to be stable. The large numbers and huge breeding range mean that this species is classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of least concern.

The Eurasian nuthatch is common throughout much of its range, although densities are lower in the far north and in coniferous forests. Annual numbers in Siberia fluctuate depending on the availability of pine cones from year to year. In recent decades, the nuthatch has colonised Scotland and the Netherlands, and expanded its range in Wales, northern England, Norway and the High Atlas mountain range in North Africa. &quot;S. e. asiatica&quot; breeds intermittently in Finland and northern Sweden following irruptions. Because large trees are essential, felling or fragmentation of old woodland can lead to local declines or losses.

<text>Photographic processing or photographic development is the chemical means by which photographic film or paper is treated after photographic exposure to produce a negative or positive image. Photographic processing transforms the latent image into a visible image, makes this permanent and renders it insensitive to light.

All processes based upon the gelatin silver process are similar, regardless of the film or paper&#x27;s manufacturer. Exceptional variations include instant films such as those made by Polaroid and thermally developed films. Kodachrome required Kodak&#x27;s proprietary K-14 process. Kodachrome film production ceased in 2009, and K-14 processing is no longer available as of December 30, 2010. Ilfochrome materials use the dye destruction process. Deliberately using the wrong process for a film is known as cross processing.

== Common processes ==
All photographic processing use a series of chemical baths. Processing, especially the development stages, requires very close control of temperature, agitation and time.

===Black and white negative processing===

# The film may be soaked in water to swell the gelatin layer, facilitating the action of the subsequent chemical treatments.
# The developer converts the latent image to macroscopic particles of metallic silver.
# A stop bath, typically a dilute solution of acetic acid or citric acid, halts the action of the developer. A rinse with clean water may be substituted.
# The fixer makes the image permanent and light-resistant by dissolving remaining silver halide. A common fixer is &quot;hypo&quot;, specifically ammonium thiosulfate.
# Washing in clean water removes any remaining fixer. Residual fixer can corrode the silver image, leading to discolouration, staining and fading.
The washing time can be reduced and the fixer more completely removed if a hypo clearing agent is used after the fixer.
# Film may be rinsed in a dilute solution of a non-ionic wetting agent to assist uniform drying, which eliminates drying marks caused by hard water. (In very hard water areas, a pre-rinse in distilled water may be required – otherwise the final rinse wetting agent can cause residual ionic calcium on the film to drop out of solution, causing spotting on the negative.)
# Film is then dried in a dust-free environment, cut and placed into protective sleeves.
Once the film is processed, it is then referred to as a &quot;negative&quot;.

The negative may now be printed; the negative is placed in an enlarger and projected onto a sheet of photographic paper. Many different techniques can be used during the enlargement process. Two examples of enlargement techniques are dodging and burning.

Alternatively (or as well), the negative may be scanned for digital printing or web viewing after adjustment, retouching, and/or manipulation.

From a chemical standpoint, conventional black and white negative film is processed by a developer that reduces silver halide to silver metal, exposed silver halide is reduced faster than unexposed silver halide, which leaves a silver metal image. It is then fixed by converting all remaining silver halide into a soluble silver complex, which is then washed away with water. An example of a black and white developer is Kodak D-76 which has bis(4-hydroxy-N-methylanilinium) sulfate with hydroquinone and sodium sulfite.

In graphic art film, also called lithographic film which is a special type of black and white film used for converting images into halftone images for offset printing, a developer containing methol-hydroquinone and sulfite stabilizers may be used. Exposed silver halide oxidizes the hydroquinone, which then oxidizes a nucleating agent in the film, which is attacked by a hydroxide ion and converts it via hydrolysis into a nucleating agent for silver metal, which it then forms on unexposed silver halide, creating a silver image. The film is then fixed by converting all remaining silver halide into soluble silver complexes.

===Black and white reversal processing===
This process has three additional stages:
# Following the first developer and rinse, the film is bleached to remove the developed negative image. This negative image is composed of metallic silver formed in the first developer step. The bleach used here only affects the negative, metallic silver grains, it does not affect the unexposed and therefore undeveloped silver halide. The film then contains a latent positive image formed from unexposed and undeveloped silver halide salts.
# The film is fogged, either chemically or by exposure to light.
# The remaining silver halide salts are developed in the second developer, converting them into a positive image composed of metallic silver.
# Finally, the film is fixed, washed, dried and cut.

=== Colour processing ===
Chromogenic materials use dye couplers to form colour images.
Modern colour negative film is developed with the C-41 process and colour negative print materials with the RA-4 process. These processes are very similar, with differences in the first chemical developer.

The C-41 and RA-4 processes consist of the following steps:
# The colour developer develops the silver negative image by reducing the silver halide crystals that have been exposed to light to metallic silver, this consists of the developer donating electrons to the silver halide, turning it into metallic silver; the donation oxidizes the developer which then activates the dye couplers to form the colour dyes in each emulsion layer, but only does so in the dye couplers that are around unexposed silver halide.
# A rehalogenising bleach converts the developed metallic silver into silver halide.
# A fixer removes all silver halide by converting it into soluble silver complexes that are then washed away, leaving only the dyes.
# The film is washed, stabilised, dried and cut.

In the RA-4 process, the bleach and fix are combined. This is optional, and reduces the number of processing steps.

Transparency films, except Kodachrome, are developed using the E-6 process, which has the following stages:
# A black and white developer develops the silver in each image layer.
# Development is stopped with a rinse or a stop bath.
# The film is fogged in the reversal step.
# The fogged silver halides are developed and oxidized developing agents couple with the dye couplers in each layer.
# The film is bleached, fixed, washed/rinsed, stabilised and dried as described above.

The Kodachrome process is called K-14. It is very involved, requiring 4 separate developers, one for black and white and 3 for color, reexposing the film in between development stages, 8 or more tanks of processing chemicals, each with precise concentration, temperature and agitation, resulting in very complex processing equipment with precise chemical control.

In some old processes, the film emulsion was hardened during the process, typically before the bleach. Such a hardening bath often used aldehydes, such as formaldehyde and glutaraldehyde. In modern processing, these hardening steps are unnecessary because the film emulsion is sufficiently hardened to withstand the processing chemicals.

A typical chromogenic color film development process can be described from a chemical standpoint as follows: Exposed silver halide oxidizes the developer. The oxidized developer then reacts with color couplers, which are molecules near the exposed silver halide crystals, to create color dyes which ultimately create a negative image, after this the film is bleached, fixed, washed, stabilized and dried. The dye is only created where the couplers are. Thus the development chemical must travel a short distance from the exposed silver halide to the coupler and create a dye there. The amount of dye created is small and the reaction only occurs near the exposed silver halide and thus doesn&#x27;t spread throughout the entire layer. The developer diffuses into the film emulsion to react with its layers. This process happens simultaneously for all three colors of couplers in the film: cyan (in the red-sensitive layer in the film), magenta(for the green-sensitive layer), and yellow (for the blue-sensitive layer). Color film has these three layers, to be able to perform subtractive color mixing and be able to replicate colors in images.

== Further processing ==

Black and white emulsions both negative and positive, may be further processed. The image silver may be reacted with elements such as selenium or sulphur to increase image permanence and for aesthetic reasons. This process is known as toning.

In selenium toning, the image silver is changed to silver selenide; in sepia toning, the image is converted to silver sulphide. These chemicals are more resistant to atmospheric oxidising agents than silver.

If colour negative film is processed in conventional black and white developer, and fixed and then bleached with a bath containing hydrochloric acid and potassium dichromate solution, the resultant film, once exposed to light, can be redeveloped in colour developer to produce an unusual pastel colour effect.

== Processing apparatus ==
Before processing, the film must be removed from the camera and from its cassette, spool or holder in a light-proof room or container.

=== Small scale processing ===

In amateur processing, the film is removed from the camera and wound onto a reel in complete darkness (usually inside a darkroom with the safelight turned off or a lightproof bag with arm holes). The reel holds the film in a spiral shape, with space between each successive loop so the chemicals may flow freely across the film&#x27;s surfaces. The reel is placed in a specially designed light-proof tank (called a daylight processing tank or a light-trap tank) where it is retained until final washing is complete.

Sheet films can be processed in trays, in hangers (which are used in deep tanks), or rotary processing drums. Each sheet can be developed individually for special requirements. Stand development, long development in dilute developer without agitation, is occasionally used.

=== Commercial processing ===
In commercial, central processing, the film is removed automatically or by an operator handling the film in a light proof bag from which it is fed into the processing machine. The processing machinery is generally run on a continuous basis with films spliced together in a continuous line. All the processing steps are carried out within a single processing machine with automatically controlled time, temperature and solution replenishment rate. The film or prints emerge washed and dry and ready to be cut by hand. Some modern machines also cut films and prints automatically, sometimes resulting in negatives cut across the middle of the frame where the space between frames is very thin or the frame edge is indistinct, as in an image taken in low light. Alternatively stores may use minilabs to develop films and make prints on the spot automatically without needing to send film to a remote, central facility for processing and printing.

Some processing chemistries used in minilabs require a minimum amount of processing per given amount of time to remain stable and usable. Once rendered unstable due to low use, the chemistry needs to be completely replaced, or replenishers can be added to restore the chemistry to a usable state. Some chemistries have been designed with this in mind given the declining demand for film processing in minilabs, often requiring specific handling. Often chemistries become damaged by oxidation. Also, development chemicals need to be thoroughly agitated constantly to ensure consistent results. The effectiveness (activity) of the chemistry is determined through pre-exposed film control strips.

== Environmental and safety issues ==

Many photographic solutions have high chemical and biological oxygen demand (COD and BOD). These chemical wastes are often treated with ozone, peroxide or aeration to reduce the COD in commercial laboratories.

Exhausted fixer and to some extent rinse water contain silver thiosulfate complex ions. They are far less toxic than free silver ion, and they become silver sulfide sludge in the sewer pipes or treatment plant. However, the maximum silver concentration in discharge is very often tightly regulated. Silver is also a somewhat precious resource. Therefore, in most large scale processing establishments, exhausted fixer is collected for silver recovery and disposal.

Many photographic chemicals use non-biodegradable compounds, such as EDTA, DTPA, NTA and borate. EDTA, DTPA, and NTA are very often used as chelating agents in all processing solutions, particularly in developers and washing aid solutions. EDTA and other polyamine polycarboxylic acids are used as iron ligands in colour bleach solutions. These are relatively nontoxic, and in particular EDTA is approved as a food additive. However, due to poor biodegradability, these chelating agents are found in alarmingly high concentrations in some water sources from which municipal tap water is taken. Water containing these chelating agents can leach metal from water treatment equipment as well as pipes. This is becoming an issue in Europe and some parts of the world.

Another non-biodegradable compound in common use is surfactant. A common wetting agent for even drying of processed film uses Union Carbide/Dow Triton X-100 or octylphenol ethoxylate. This surfactant is also found to have estrogenic effect and possibly other harms to organisms including mammals.

Development of more biodegradable alternatives to the EDTA and other bleaching agent constituents were sought by major manufacturers, until the industry became less profitable when the digital era began.

In most amateur darkrooms, a popular bleach is potassium ferricyanide. This compound decomposes in the waste water stream to liberate cyanide gas. Other popular bleach solutions use potassium dichromate (a hexavalent chromium) or permanganate. Both ferricyanide and dichromate are tightly regulated for sewer disposal from commercial premises in some areas.

Borates, such as borax (sodium tetraborate), boric acid and sodium metaborate, are toxic to plants, even at a concentration of 100 ppm. Many film developers and fixers contain 1 to 20 g/L of these compounds at working strength. Most non-hardening fixers from major manufacturers are now borate-free, but many film developers still use borate as the buffering agent. Also, some, but not all, alkaline fixer formulae and products contain a large amount of borate. New products should phase out borates, because for most photographic purposes, except in acid hardening fixers, borates can be substituted with a suitable biodegradable compound.

Developing agents are commonly hydroxylated benzene compounds or aminated benzene compounds, and they are harmful to humans and experimental animals. Some are mutagens. They also have a large chemical oxygen demand (COD). Ascorbic acid and its isomers, and other similar sugar derived reductone reducing agents are a viable substitute for many developing agents. Developers using these compounds were actively patented in the US, Europe and Japan, until the 1990s but the number of such patents is very low since the late-1990s, when the digital era began.

Development chemicals may be recycled by up to 70% using an absorber resin, only requiring periodic chemical analysis on pH, density and bromide levels. Other developers need ion-exchange columns and chemical analysis, allowing for up to 80% of the developer to be reused. Some bleaches are claimed to be fully bio-degradable while others can be regenerated by adding bleach concentrate to overflow (waste). Used fixers can have 60 to 90% of their silver content removed through electrolysis, in a closed loop where the fixer is continually recycled (regenerated). Stabilizers may or may not contain formaldehyde.

<text>Murcia–San Javier Airport is a military air base and former civilian passenger airport located in San Javier, southeast of Murcia, Spain. It is owned by the Spanish Air and Space Force. It was replaced (after several delays) by the new Región de Murcia International Airport, when it opened on 15 January 2019.

==Overview==
===Operations===
The airport can handle aircraft up to the size of a Boeing 757. It has Category 5 fire cover by the IATA, and also has one ambulance available.

The military air base dates back to at least the early 1930s and is located at the northern end of the airport. It is used chiefly by Spanish Air and Space Force turboprop, piston and jet-engined training aircraft of the Academia General del Aire (the Spanish Air Force College), including the aerobatic demonstration team of the Spanish Air and Space Force Patrulla Águila which can often be seen practicing over the nearby Mar Menor.

In recent years, Murcia Airport became much busier thanks to the arrival of several low-cost airlines. According to Aena, passenger numbers jumped from 88,608 in 1995 to 1,181,490 passengers in 2012.

===Replacement===
The airport invested in a new €60 million runway and terminal buildings around 2004 to 2011 In November 2011, the Minister of Public Works Antonio Sevilla, and Secretary of State for Transport Isaías Táboas, signed an official agreement that effectively proposed to close the airport to civilian air traffic from 2012.

In November 2017, the Spanish government said it would be awarding AENA the contract of managing Corvera Airport - whereby San Javier would be closed and flights transferred. In April 2018, it was confirmed that the new Región de Murcia International Airport, which is situated in closer proximity to the city of Murcia, would open in January 2019. San Javier closed on 14 January 2019 and all airlines transferred their services to the new airport the following day. The final flight to operate at San Javier was Ryanair flight FR4117 to Manchester.

==Airlines and destinations==
All operations transferred to Región de Murcia International Airport on 14 January 2019. Prior to this it was mostly used by leisure and low-cost carriers such as Jet2.com and Ryanair.

<text>Photographic paper is a paper coated with a light-sensitive chemical, used for making photographic prints. When photographic paper is exposed to light, it captures a latent image that is then developed to form a visible image; with most papers the image density from exposure can be sufficient to not require further development, aside from fixing and clearing, though latent exposure is also usually present. The light-sensitive layer of the paper is called the emulsion, and functions similarly to photographic film. The most common chemistry used is gelatin silver, but other alternatives have also been used.

The print image is traditionally produced by interposing a photographic negative between the light source and the paper, either by direct contact with a large negative (forming a contact print) or by projecting the shadow of the negative onto the paper (producing an enlargement). The initial light exposure is carefully controlled to produce a grayscale image on the paper with appropriate contrast and gradation. Photographic paper may also be exposed to light using digital printers such as the LightJet, with a camera (to produce a photographic negative), by scanning a modulated light source over the paper, or by placing objects upon it (to produce a photogram).

Despite the introduction of digital photography, photographic papers are still sold commercially. Photographic papers are manufactured in numerous standard sizes, paper weights and surface finishes. A range of emulsions are also available that differ in their light sensitivity, colour response and the warmth of the final image. Color papers are also available for making colour images.

==History==
The effect of light in darkening a prepared paper was discovered by Thomas Wedgwood in 1802. Photographic papers have been used since the beginning of all negative–positive photographic processes as developed and popularized by William Fox Talbot&#x27;s 1841 calotype.

After the early days of photography, papers have been manufactured on a large scale with improved consistency and greater light sensitivity.

==Types of photographic papers==

Photographic papers fall into one of three sub-categories:
* Papers used for negative-positive processes. This includes all current black-and-white papers and chromogenic colour papers.
* Papers used for positive-positive processes in which the &quot;film&quot; is the same as the final image (e.g., the Polaroid process, Imago direct positive paper).
* Papers used for positive-positive film-to-paper processes where a positive image on a film slide is enlarged and copied onto a photographic paper, for example the Ilfochrome process.

==Structure==
All photographic papers consist of a light-sensitive emulsion, consisting of silver halide salts suspended in a colloidal material – usually gelatin-coated onto a paper, resin coated paper or polyester support. In black-and-white papers, the emulsion is normally sensitised to blue and green light, but is insensitive to wavelengths longer than 600 nm in order to facilitate handling under red or orange safelighting. In chromogenic colour papers, the emulsion layers are sensitive to red, green and blue light, respectively producing cyan, magenta and yellow dye during processing.

===Base materials===
====Black-and-white papers====
Modern black-and-white papers are coated on a small range of bases; baryta-coated paper, resin-coated paper or polyester. In the past, linen has been used as a base material.

====Fiber-based papers (FB)====
Fiber-based (FB or Baryta) photographic papers consist of a paper base coated with baryta. Tints are sometimes added to the baryta to add subtle colour to the final print; however most modern papers use optical brighteners to extend the paper&#x27;s tonal range. Most fiber-based papers include a clear hardened gelatin layer above the emulsion which protects it from physical damage, especially during processing. This is called a supercoating. Papers without a super coating are suitable for use with the bromoil process. Fiber-based papers are generally chosen as a medium for high-quality prints for exhibition, display and archiving purposes. These papers require careful processing and handling, especially when wet. However, they are easier to tone, hand-colour and retouch than resin-coated equivalents.

====Resin-coated papers (RC)====
The paper base of resin-coated papers is sealed by two polyethylene layers, making it impenetrable to liquids. Since no chemicals or water are absorbed into the paper base, the time needed for processing, washing and drying durations are significantly reduced in comparison to fiber-based papers. Resin paper prints can be finished and dried within twenty to thirty minutes. Resin-coated papers have improved dimensional stability, and do not curl upon drying.

====The baryta layer====
The term &quot;baryta&quot; derives from the name of a common barium sulfate-containing mineral, barite. However, the substance used to coat photographic papers is usually not pure barium sulfate, but a mixture of barium and strontium sulfates. The ratio of strontium to barium differs among commercial photographic papers, so chemical analysis can be used to identify the maker of the paper used to make a print and sometimes when the paper was made. The baryta layer has two functions 1) to brighten the image and 2) to prevent chemicals adsorbed on the fibers from infiltrating the gelatin layer. The brightening occurs because barium sulfate is in the form of a fine precipitate that scatters light back through the silver image layer. In the early days of photography, before baryta layers were used, impurities from the paper fibers could gradually diffuse into the silver layer and cause an uneven loss of sensitivity (before development) or mottle (unevenly discolour) the silver image (after development).

====Colour papers====
All colour photographic materials available today are coated on either RC (resin coated) paper or on solid polyester. The photographic emulsion used for colour photographic materials consists of three colour emulsion layers (cyan, yellow, and magenta) along with other supporting layers. The colour layers are sensitised to their corresponding colours. Although it is commonly believed that the layers in negative papers are shielded against the intrusion of light of a different wavelength than the actual layer by colour filters which dissolve during processing, this is not so. The colour layers in negative papers are actually produced to have speeds which increase from cyan (red sensitive) to magenta (green sensitive) to yellow (blue sensitive), and thus when filtered during printing, the blue light is &quot;normalized&quot; so that there is no crosstalk. Therefore, the yellow (blue sensitive) layer is nearly ISO 100 while the cyan (red) layer is about ISO 25. After adding enough yellow filtration to make a neutral, the blue sensitivity of the slow cyan layer is &quot;lost&quot;. 

In negative-positive print systems, the blue sensitive layer is on the bottom, and the cyan layer is on the top. This is the reverse of the usual layer order in colour films.

The emulsion layers can include the colour dyes, as in Ilfochrome; or they can include colour couplers, which react with colour developers to produce colour dyes, as in type C prints or chromogenic negative–positive prints. Type R prints, which are no longer made, were positive–positive chromogenic prints.

==Black and white emulsion types==
The emulsion contains light sensitive silver halide crystals suspended in gelatin. Black-and-white papers typically use relatively insensitive emulsions composed of agb silver bromide, silver chloride or a combination of both. The silver halide used affects the paper&#x27;s sensitivity and the image tone of the resulting print.

===Chloride papers===
Popular in the past, chloride papers are nowadays unusual; a single manufacturer produces this material. These insensitive papers are suitable for contact printing, and yield warm toned images by development. Chloride emulsions are also used for printing-out papers, or POP, which require no further development after exposure.

===Chlorobromide papers===
Containing a blend of silver chloride and silver bromide salts, these emulsions produce papers sensitive enough to be used for enlarging. They produce warm-black to neutral image tones by development, which can be varied by using different developers.

===Bromide papers===
Papers with pure silver bromide emulsions are sensitive and produce neutral black or &#x27;cold&#x27; blue-black image tones.

===Contrast control===
&quot;Fixed-grade&quot; – or &quot;graded&quot; – black-and-white papers were historically available in a range of 12 grades, numbered 0 to 5, with 0 being the &quot;softest&quot;, or least contrasty paper grade and 5 being the &quot;hardest&quot;, or most contrasty paper grade. Low contrast negatives can be corrected by printing on a contrasty paper; conversely a very contrasty negative can be printed on a low contrast paper. Because of decreased demand, most extreme paper grades are now discontinued, and the few graded ranges still available include only middle contrast grades.

&quot;Variable-contrast&quot; – or &quot;VC&quot; – papers account for the great majority of consumption of these papers in the 21st century. VC papers permit the selection of a wide range of contrast grades, in the case of the brand leader between 00 and 5. These papers are coated with a mixture of two or three emulsions, all of equal contrast and sensitivity to blue light. However, each emulsion is sensitised in different proportions to green light. Upon exposure to blue light, all emulsions act in an additive manner to produce a high contrast image. When exposed to green light alone, the emulsions produce a low contrast image because each is differently sensitised to green. By varying the ratio of blue to green light, the contrast of the print can be approximately continuously varied between these extremes, creating all contrast grades from 00 to 5. Filters in the enlarger&#x27;s light path are a common method of achieving this control. Magenta filters absorb green and transmit blue and red, while yellow filters absorb blue and transmit green and red.

The contrast of photographic papers can also be controlled during processing or by the use of bleaches or toners.

===Panchromatic papers===
Panchromatic black-and-white photographic printing papers are sensitive to all wavelengths of visible light. They were designed for the printing of full-tone black-and-white images from colour negatives; this is not possible with conventional orthochromatic papers. Panchromatic papers can also be used to produce paper negatives in large-format cameras. These materials must be handled and developed in near-complete darkness. Kodak Panalure Select RC is an example of a panchromatic black-and-white paper; it was discontinued in 2005.

===Non Silver papers===

Numerous photo sensitive papers that do not use silver chemistry exist. Most are hand made by enthusiasts but cyanotype prints are made on what was commonly sold as blueprint paper. Certain precious metal including platinum and other chemistries have also been in common use at certain periods.

==Archival stability==
The longevity of any photographic print media will depend upon the processing, display and storage conditions of the print.

===Black-and-white prints===
&quot;Fixing&quot; must convert all non-image silver into soluble silver compounds that can be removed by washing with water. &quot;Washing&quot; must remove these compounds and all residual fixing chemicals from the emulsion and paper base. A hypo-clearing solution, also referred to as hypo clearing agent, HCA, or a washing aid, and which can consist of a 2% solution of sodium sulfite, can be used to shorten the effective washing time by displacing the thiosulfate fixer, and the byproducts of the process of fixation, that are bound to paper fibers.

&quot;Toners&quot; are sometimes used to convert the metallic silver into more stable compounds. Commonly used archival toners are: selenium, gold and sulfide.

Prints on fiber-based papers that have been properly fixed and washed should last at least fifty years without fading. Some alternative non-silver processes – such as platinum prints – employ metals that are, if processed correctly, inherently more stable than gelatin-silver prints.

===Colour prints===
For colour images, Ilfochrome is often used because of its clarity and the stability of the colour dyes.

She was the wife of Sun Yat-sen, therefore known by Madame Sun Yat-sen and the &quot;mother of modern China.&quot; A member of the Soong family, she and her family played a significant role in shaping the Republic of China. As a prominent leader of the left wing of the Kuomintang (KMT), she founded the Revolutionary Committee of the KMT. She entered the Communist government in 1949, and was the only female, non-Communist head of state of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. She was named Honorary President of the People&#x27;s Republic of China and admitted to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), a few weeks before her death in 1981.

Born in Shanghai and educated in the United States, she married Sun Yat-sen, the founder of the Republic of China and the KMT, as his third wife in 1915 and became a strong advocate for Sun&#x27;s KMT-CCP coalition, opposing Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s split with the CCP in 1927. During the Second Sino-Japanese War she joined her sisters in China&#x27;s wartime capital Chongqing to demonstrate national unity and support for the KMT-CCP alliance. However, during the subsequent Chinese Civil War she continued her support to the CCP, leading to a break in ties with her family. After the proclamation of the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) in 1949, she held several prominent positions in the Communist government, including Vice Chairman of the PRC (1949–1954; 1959–1975) and Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People&#x27;s Congress (1954–1959; 1975–1981). She travelled abroad during the early 1950s, representing China at a number of international events.

Following the purge of President Liu Shaoqi in 1968, she and Dong Biwu as Vice Presidents became &quot;de facto&quot; Heads of State of China until 1972, when Dong was appointed Acting President. During the Cultural Revolution, Soong was protected from being purged, as the top name on &quot;A List of Cadres to Be Protected&quot; created by Zhou Enlai. Despite this, her Beijing home was invaded by Red Guards, and her parents&#x27; tombs in Shanghai were destroyed. Soong survived the political turmoil of the Cultural Revolution but appeared less frequently after 1976. As the acting Chairwoman of the Standing Committee of the National People&#x27;s Congress from 1976 to 1978, Soong was again the acting Head of State, as the office of President had been abolished. During her final illness in May 1981, she was given the special title of &quot;Honorary Chairman of the People&#x27;s Republic of China&quot;.

== Names and titles ==
As with the Chinese naming tradition, Soong was the family name, Ching-ling was the first name. Her name is also rendered as Song Qingling in Pinyin. In some early literature, she was referred to as Chung-ling Song, a name she used during her time at Wesleyan. While studying there, she adopted the Christian name &quot;Rosamonde&quot; or &quot;Rosamond.&quot; Ching-ling was named after Rosamonde Ricaud, the daughter of the Methodist minister who baptised her father in the United States in 1880. Among her close friends at Wesleyan, however, she was more commonly known as Suzie or Suzi.

After marrying Sun Yat-sen in 1925, she became known as Madame Sun Yat-sen. Her daughter-in-law and the wife of Sun Fo, , preferred to be called Mrs Sun, rather than Madame Sun, to avoid confusion. As the wife and widow of the founder of the Chinese Republic, she was honoured as the &quot;mother of modern China,&quot; by both major political parties in China, KMT and CCP. The KMT, which hailed Sun Yat-sen as the &quot;father of the nation,&quot; extended this honour to her as &quot;the mother of the nation.&quot; The CCP also occasionally used this title to refer to her. However, she was not Sun&#x27;s only wife. Lu Muzhen was also sometimes described with the same term.

Following the Chinese Communist Revolution in 1949, she assumed a largely symbolic role in the Communist government in Beijing. Premier Zhou Enlai revered her as &quot;the treasure of the country.&quot; She was awarded the title of the &quot;Honorary Chairman of the People&#x27;s Republic of China&quot; in 1981 before her death.

== Early life and education ==
Soong Ching-ling was born in Shanghai, China on 27 January 1893, though the exact location of her birth remains debated. Her father, Charlie Soong, was a businessman and missionary originally from Wenchang, Hainan. Influenced by his uncle, who ran a grocery store in the United States, Charlie became enamoured with America when he was young. He was converted into Christianity in Wilmington, North Carolina in November 1880 and returned to China for missionary works in 1886. Her mother, Ni Kwei-tseng, was born in Shanghai to a missionary family originally from Yuyao, Zhejiang, which upheld a Christian tradition dating back to the Ming dynasty. She was educated at a high school run by American missionaries in Shanghai, where she met Charlie Soong. Married in 1890, the couple initially engaged in missionary work and business in Kunshan, later continuing their missionary efforts in Chuansha.

Charlie was deeply committed to education in the United States for his daughters. He wanted them to receive a Methodist education, so he enrolled them at McTyeire School for Girls in Shanghai, where Ching-ling studied from 1904 to 1907. Acting on the advice of his missionary friend William Burke, who had ties to the Mulberry Street United Methodist Church in Macon, Charlie sent his eldest daughter Ai-ling to Wesleyan College in 1904.

Ching-ling was among the first government-funded female Chinese students to study in the United States. The group, consisting of ten male and four female students, departed from Shanghai on 1 August 1907 and arrived in Seattle on 28 August, under the escort of , the director of the Foreign Office of the Viceroy of Liangjiang. Ching-ling first attended school in Summit, New Jersey, to study Latin and French to fulfil Wesleyan&#x27;s entrance requirements. She joined Ai-ling as a full-time college student at Wesleyan in the autumn of 1908, with their youngest sister Mei-ling accompanying them despite being only ten years old.

Although the Soong sisters spent most of their time on campus, they also travelled across the United States, navigating the prevailing anti-Chinese sentiments of the time. They were warmly received by local communities in the American South. In the summer of 1910, Ching-ling and Mei-ling attended summer school together at Fairmount College. In the summer of 1912, they participated in a church-sponsored YMCA conference in Montreat, North Carolina. During several Christmas holidays, they visited Washington, D.C., where they were hosted as guests of the Chinese ambassador.

== Leftist Kuomintang ==

=== Marriage with Sun Yat-sen ===
After graduating, Ching-ling&#x27;s elder sister, Ai-ling, returned to Shanghai in 1908 and became the secretary to Sun Yat-sen. Sun became fascinated with Ai-ling, constantly gazing at her, although Ai-ling did not reciprocate his feelings in the same way. Ching-ling graduated from Wesleyan in 1913, and returned to China via Yokohama, Japan, where she met Sun. Ai-ling resigned in 1914 to marry H. H. Kung, passing the position on to Ching-ling, who admired Sun as the hero who founded the Chinese Republic. In the summer of 1915, Ching-ling returned to Shanghai, asking her parents for their permission to marry Sun, which shocked the family. Ching-ling was confined at home in Shanghai, during which Sun divorced with his wife Lu Mu-zhen.

Despite objections from her father, Ching-ling married Sun Yat-sen on 25 October 1915. There were limited witnesses in their wedding ceremony in Tokyo, which included Wada Mizu, who provided his home for the wedding, Liao Zhong-kai and Liao&#x27;s 11-year-old daughter Cynthia. The Soong family chased Ching-ling to Tokyo, attempting to dissuade her from the marriage, with her father Charlie even appealing to the Japanese government to denounce Sun. Additionally, many of Sun’s colleagues did not acknowledge Ching-ling as his wife, referring to her as Miss Soong rather than Mrs Sun. As Ching-ling could only speak Shanghainese and English, her husband had to talk with her in English rather than Chinese.

==== 1916-1922: Guangzhou ====

Sun&#x27;s political rival, Yuan Shikai, stepped down in 1916 following his short-lived attempt to restore the monarchy. In May of the same year, Sun and Ching-ling returned to Shanghai. In 1917, Sun travelled to Guangzhou to establish a rival government opposing Duan Qirui&#x27;s Beijing government, while Ching-ling stayed behind in Shanghai. However, Sun’s strong-handed policies alienated the new government in Guangzhou, leading to his expulsion and subsequent departure from the city. The couple began to live together in a large European-styled mansion in Shanghai French Concession.

In November 1920, Sun returned to Guangzhou with the support of local military leader Chen Jiongming to establish a new government. On 7 April 1921, he assumed the title of Grand President of the Republic of China, setting up a breakaway regime to oppose the internationally recognised government in Beijing.

However, on 16 June 1922, Chen Jiongming rebelled. During the uprising, Ching-ling chose to stay behind to cover Sun&#x27;s escape, declaring, &quot;China can do without me; it cannot do without you.&quot; During her own flight, Ching-ling suffered a miscarriage and was later informed that she would never be able to conceive again. Ching-ling, thereafter, became respected as Madame Sun Yat-sen.

==== 1923-1927: First United Front ====

Ching-ling made her way to Shanghai after Sun&#x27;s escape, where the couple reunited. They met Soviet envoy Adolph Joffe, who had arrived in Shanghai in January 1923. Together, Sun and Joffe issued a joint declaration in which Joffe affirmed that communism or Soviet-style governance would not be imposed on China. Additionally, the Soviet Union pledged to relinquish the special privileges in China that had been inherited from Tsarist Russia. With renewed support in Guangzhou, Sun returned to establish his base once more. Like her husband, Ching-ling never publicly accepted communism.

During a visit to Sun&#x27;s residence in Shanghai, Chiang Kai-shek encountered Ching-ling&#x27;s younger sister, Mei-ling, for the first time and became enamoured with her. Subsequently, Chiang divorced his wife in Fenghua and sought Sun&#x27;s counsel on pursuing Mei-ling. When Sun consulted Ching-ling on the matter, she expressed her strong disapproval. Sun then advised Chiang to wait, and Chiang obeyed.

In 1924, at the invitation of Feng Yuxiang, Sun and Ching-ling travelled to Beijing to negotiate a peace deal with the Beijing government. Sun Yat-sen fell gravely ill after arriving in Beijing on 31 December 1924. In his final days, he recognised that Ching-ling no longer loved him, though she wept uncontrollably and insisted that she still loved him. On 24 February 1925, Wang Jingwei, who was widely considered Sun’s political heir, announced that all of Sun’s belongings would be entrusted to Ching-ling and reaffirmed his commitment to the policies advocated by Soviet advisor Mikhail Borodin. In his last moments, Sun called out “darling,” prompting Ching-ling to cry so bitterly that she fainted. Ching-ling harboured distrust toward Wang Jingwei. Shortly after, her sisters arrived from Shanghai to offer her moral support and safeguard her interests.

After Sun&#x27;s death in 1925, Ching-ling was elected to the KMT Central Executive Committee. In June 1925, she actively supported the Canton–Hong Kong strike, stating, &quot;Follow the views of Dr. Sun and act according to his actions. If he knew about this, he would be pleased.&quot; She attended key meetings of the Kuomintang, including the Third Plenum in 1927. In 1927, Mei-ling married Chiang, who was about to launch a purge against the CCP.

=== Kuomintang-Communist split ===
On 14 July 1927, following Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Jingwei’s announcements severing ties with the CCP, Soong Ching-ling issued a statement condemning the KMT-CCP split. She declared her intention to withdraw from politics until the KMT adopted a &quot;wiser policy.&quot; Ching-ling viewed the alliance between the KMT and CCP as a cornerstone of her late husband’s vision, and its dissolution as a betrayal. Nevertheless, she harboured concerns about the Communist influence within the alliance.

==== 1927-1928: Moscow ====
Ching-ling initially travelled from Wuhan to Shanghai, uncertain about whether to leave China. On the advice of Eugene Chen, she departed for Moscow in late August, intending to persuade the Soviet leadership to reaffirm their support for the KMT within the United Front. However, upon her arrival, they were caught in the conflict between Stalin and Trotsky. Stalin opposed efforts to overthrow Chiang Kai-shek, while Trotsky criticised the KMT as reflecting petty bourgeois values that undermined the prospects for land reform. Soong Ching-ling found herself unable to fully align with either side.

In Spring 1928, Soong Ching-ling and Eugene Chen visited Stalin at Kremlin. During the meeting, Stalin stated that they should return to China, leading the revolution, at which Ching-ling was disappointed, as she realised that Stalin was not interested in overthrowing Chiang Kai-shek.

==== 1928-1931: Berlin ====
Ching-ling arrived in Berlin on 1 May 1928, with assistance from the People&#x27;s Commissariat for Foreign Affairs. She was accompanied by Deng Yanda, a leftist leader of the Kuomintang, and cared for by Zhang Ke, a researcher from the Moscow Sun Yat-sen University.

On 26 March 1929, the 3rd National Congress of the KMT passed a resolution inviting Soong Ching-ling to Nanjing for Sun Yat-sen&#x27;s burial. She departed Berlin on 6 May, travelling via Moscow and Siberia, and arrived in Nanjing on 1 June. Ching-ling played a significant role in his funeral arrangements, escorting the coffin of her husband Sun Yat-sen to the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum in Nanjing.

On 21 September 1929, she departed China by ship and returned to Berlin in mid-November. While in Berlin, she witnessed widespread unemployment and hyperinflation. She avoided contact with representatives of the KMT-led government, instead engaging with European labour movements and maintaining ties with major Communist organisations, despite the rising influence of the Nazis. However, she was displeased by rumours spread about her by local Chinese students.

In late April 1931, she received a telegram from home informing her of her mother&#x27;s illness. Initially sceptical, she suspected it might be a ploy by the KMT to lure her back for their political purposes. To confirm the news, she wrote to a friend in China. She departed Berlin on 31 July 1931 to attend her mother’s funeral.

==== 1931-1937: Shanghai ====
In 1931, Ching-ling returned to China from Germany, for her mother&#x27;s funeral. She delivered the offer from Moscow to exchange Chiang Ching-kuo, the son of Chiang Kai-shek, for the arrested Soviet intelligence officer Jakob Rudnik. Chiang Kai-shek turned down this offer, although his wife Mei-ling wanted to agreed. Ching-ling hereafter began working for Comintern. In May 1933, Ching-ling contacted Liao Chengzhi on behalf of Comintern to request intelligence from the CCP. In 1934, a memo of Commintern suggests that the local Soviet representative believed it was a mistake to admit her into the Communist Party, which made her lose her unique value.

With financial backing from the Comintern, Ching-ling maintained contact with Moscow through Agnes Smedley and Ruth Weiss. She played a key role in rescuing Communist leaders, including Chen Geng, Liao Chengzhi, and Chen Duxiu, and communicated with the CCP viaher secretary Li Yun. She also provided Dong Jianwu with a special passport signed by Zhang Xueliang, enabling him to link Communist organisations in Shanghai and Shaanxi. At Mao Zedong&#x27;s request, she sent doctor Ma Haide and journalist Edgar Snow to Yan&#x27;an Soviet. Few were aware that she was secretly acting as a Communist agent.

=== Second United Front ===
==== 1938-1940: Hong Kong ====

On 23 December 1937, to evade Japanese aggression, Ching-ling moved from Shanghai to Hong Kong with her secretary Li Yun. She published influential articles, such as &quot;China Unconquerable&quot;, and penned letters appealing for global solidarity. In 1938, she founded the China Defence League in Hong Kong, aiming to garner international support for China’s war effort. The organisation mobilised resources, provided humanitarian aid, and published newsletters to raise awareness globally.

==== 1940-1945: Chongqing ====

The three Soong sisters made public appearances in Hong Kong in favour of relief work until 1940, when the Japanese radio stated that they would evacuate rather than join the Chinese government in Chongqing to endure the war conditions. In response to this, they left for Chongqing, where they continued to appear to boost public morale touring hospitals, air-raid shelter systems and bomb sites during the war. They founded the Indusco organization to protect Chinese industry during wartime conditions, an organization in which Soong Ai-ling was most active of the sisters.

=== Communist revolution ===
In September 1945, Soong Ching-ling met Mao Zedong in Chongqing. By December, she had left Chongqing for Shanghai, where she restructured the China Defence League into the China Welfare Institute. The organisation continued its support for Communist groups and their army while also engaging in charitable activities for children and social welfare. On 23 July 1946, Ching-ling issued an open letter in Shanghai, advocating for a coalition government between the KMT and the CCP and calling for the cessation of American aid to the KMT. In 1948, she was named honorary chairwoman of the Revolutionary Committee of the KMT, a left-wing splinter group claiming to uphold Sun Yat-sen’s legacy.

== People&#x27;s Republic of China ==
=== Coalition government ===
With the collapse of the Nationalist government and the Communist victory in the civil war, she left Shanghai in September 1949 to attend the Chinese People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), convened in Beijing by the Chinese Communist Party to establish a new Central People&#x27;s Government. On 1 October, she was a guest at the ceremony in Tiananmen Square marking the birth of the new People&#x27;s Republic of China. The Nationalist government issued an order for her arrest, but this was soon blocked by the swift military victory of the Communists. The KMT fled from mainland China to Taiwan soon after this. Soong was the third person in the new government mentioned by Mao in the founding Proclamation of the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

Soong was held in great esteem by the victorious Communists, who reckoned her as a link between their movement and Sun&#x27;s earlier movement. After the formal establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1949, she became one of six vice chairpeople of the Central People&#x27;s Government,&quot; and one of several vice-chairpeople of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association.

In 1950, Soong became chairwoman of the Chinese People&#x27;s Relief Administration, which combined several organizations dealing with welfare and relief issues. Her China Welfare Fund was reorganized as the China Welfare Institute and began publishing the magazine &quot;China Reconstructs&quot;, now published as &quot;China Today.&quot; In 1953, a collection of her writings, &quot;Struggle for New China&quot;, was published. In April 1951, it was announced that she had been awarded the Stalin Peace Prize for 1950. She donated her Stalin Award to China Welfare Institute, which was then used to establish International Peace Maternity And Child Health Hospital in Shanghai in 1952.

=== Vice-presidency ===
==== 1950-1966: Communist government ====

In 1953 Soong served on the committees preparing for elections to the new National People&#x27;s Congress and the drafting of the 1954 constitution. Soong was elected a Shanghai deputy to the first NPC, which adopted the constitution at its first meeting in September 1954. She was elected one of 14 vice-chairpeople of the NPC&#x27;s standing committee, chaired by Liu Shaoqi. In December of the same year, she was elected a vice-chairwoman of the CPPCC, which became a consultative body, and replaced Liu Shaoqi as chairperson of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association. During this period, Soong traveled abroad several times, visiting Austria, India, Burma, Pakistan, and Indonesia. Her trips included a January 1953 visit to the Soviet Union, where she was received by Stalin shortly before his death. She visited Moscow again in 1957 with Mao Zedong&#x27;s delegation to the 40th anniversary of the Russian Revolution.
In April 1959, Soong again served as a Shanghai deputy at the 2nd National People&#x27;s Congress. At this Congress, Mao Zedong and Zhu De stepped down as President and Vice-President of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. Liu Shaoqi was elected State Chairman (President), and Soong Ching-ling and Dong Biwu, a senior Communist Party &#x27;elder&#x27;, were elected Vice President of China. Soong resigned at this time from her positions as vice-chairwoman of the CPPCC National Committee and the NPC Standing Committee. She was re-elected to the post of Vice-chairperson of the PRC at the Third National People&#x27;s Congress in 1965, and appeared frequently in the early 1960s on ceremonial occasions, often greeting important visitors from abroad.

==== 1966-1976: Cultural Revolution ====
During the Cultural Revolution, Soong was heavily criticized by Red Guard factions, and in one incident, the marker of her parents&#x27; grave was toppled and their bodies exposed. Following this incident Premier Zhou Enlai recommended that Soong Ching-ling be put on a &quot;List of Cadres to be protected.&quot; Zhou&#x27;s recommendation was approved by Mao Zedong. Mao Zedong sent his wife, Jiang Qing, to visit Soong and explain the purpose of the &quot;Cultural Revolution.&quot; In response, Soong remarked that it should, above all, avoid harming the innocent, which embarrassed Jiang.

Despite Soong’s support of the CCP, she was skeptical of some radical actions such as the purging of capitalists and party moderates such as Liu Shaoqi from the government. Soong wrote seven letters to criticize the Cultural Revolution Campaign and objected to the excessive violence against her colleagues and other moderates within the CCP. In her letters with friends, Soong called Jiang a &quot;queen&quot; and &quot;shameless bitch.&quot; Late in the Cultural Revolution, during the 4th NPC which approved the 1975 Constitution in January 1975, Soong&#x27;s term as Vice President of China ended with the abolishment of that post, after which she was again appointed one of the vice-chairwomen of the NPC Standing Committee.

==== 1976-1981: Final years ====
Soong Ching-ling moved to her Shichahai residence in Beijing, where she penned several articles commemorating late Chinese leaders Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai. In November 1980, she wrote to the CCP Central Committee, urging the Party to reflect on the suffering it had inflicted on the people during past political movements. She also requested that her name not be equated with the Father of the Nation Sun Yat-sen, expressing her belief that she was unworthy of such an honour.

== Death and funeral ==
In the spring of 1981, Soong Ching-ling was diagnosed with leukaemia. Her last public appearance was on 8 May 1981, when she appeared in a wheelchair at the Great Hall of the People to accept an honorary LL.D. degree from the University of Victoria. A few days later she began running a high fever and was unable to rise again.

=== Honorary presidency ===
Soong Ching-ling had wanted to join the Chinese Communist Party as early as 1957. However, when she asked Liu Shaoqi for permission to join the party, the request was turned down because &quot;it was thought better for the revolution that she not join formally, but that she would thenceforth be informed, and her opinion sought, concerning all important inner-Party events matters, not only those involving the government.&quot;

When she fell in 1981, Wang Guangmei, the widow of Liu Shaoqi, visited her and later approached Hu Yaobang to ask if Soong could be admitted to the CCP. Hu agreed to consider the case, and Wang returned to Soong&#x27;s residence to confirm her interest in joining the CCP. Soong nodded in affirmation. Wang then relayed Soong’s wishes to Hu Yaobang. On 16 May 1981, she was admitted to the CCP and named Honorary Chairman of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. She is the only person to ever hold this title. Song Renqiong and Liao Chengzhi visited Soong in the hospital and informed her of the Politburo&#x27;s decision, first in Chinese and then in English for confirmation.

=== Death ===
Before her death, more than 50 party and state leaders, along with relatives from overseas and close friends, gathered at her bedside to pay their final respects. Her family sent a telegram to Mei-ling, hoping for a reunion. Mei-ling responded, suggesting that Ching-ling be sent to New York, United States instead. According to Xinhua News Agency, Soong Ching-ling died from chronic lymphocytic leukaemia at 8:18 p.m. on 29 May 1981 in Beijing. Xinhua described her death as &quot;a great loss to the country and the people.&quot; Despite invitations, Mei-ling chose to remain at home in Taiwan, reportedly due to political sensitivities. A potential family reunion in Beijing was seen as a threat to the legitimacy of her stepson, Taiwanese President Chiang Ching-kuo. Xinhua noted that other family members were present at the time of Soong&#x27;s passing.

Soon after her passing, world leaders expressed their condolences. United States President Ronald Reagan extended &quot;the sympathy of the American people and my personal condolences,&quot; highlighting Soong Ching-ling&#x27;s significant contributions as Sun Yat-sen&#x27;s private secretary, political advisor, and wife, as well as their early life in the United States. Soviet President Leonid Brezhnev offered &quot;profound condolences,&quot; a term stronger than that used upon Mao Zedong&#x27;s death, acknowledging her role as honorary chair of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association.

=== State funeral ===
The Chinese government declared three days of mourning, ordered flags to be lowered at Chinese embassies worldwide, and held a state funeral for Miss Soong on 3 June. Again, the funeral services extended an invitation to Soong Ching-ling’s family to attend the ceremony in Beijing. Although Mei-ling mourned her sister privately, she wrote to Chiang Ching-kuo, stating that despite their familial bond, she had decided not to travel to Beijing.

Hosted by Hu Yaobang, who was widely expected to become the next chairman of the CCP, the televised mourning ceremony at the Great Hall of the People in central Beijing drew over 10,000 attendees. Notable participants included Hua Guofeng, Deng Xiaoping, and Ye Jianying. In his eulogy, Deng Xiaoping mentioned that Soong, the aunt of then-President of Taiwan Chiang Ching-kuo, had expressed hope for reunification talks between the governments of Beijing and Taipei in the near future.

=== Resting place ===
In accordance with her wishes, Soong Ching-ling&#x27;s cremated remains were interred alongside her parents in the restored Soong family burial plot at Shanghai&#x27;s International Cemetery, later renamed the Soong Ching Ling Mausoleum in her honour. She was laid to rest beside her parents, Charlie Soong and Ni Kwei-tseng, with the names of their children—T.V. Soong, T.L. Soong, T.A. Soong, Ai-ling Soong, Ching-ling Soong, and Mei-ling Soong—engraved on the tombstone.

== Legacy ==

=== Public image ===
According to French historian Bernard Brizay, Soong Ching-ling stood out from the traditional female archetype. Despite her youthful, gentle, and kind appearance, she was remarkably strong-willed, which inspired Sun Yat-sen during his lowest moments. When asked if she loved her husband, she famously replied that her love was for the Chinese revolution. After her husband&#x27;s death, she could have withdrawn from politics, yet she steadfastly committed herself to fulfilling his revolutionary ideals, even in the face of death threats.

The CCP still treats Sun Yat-sen as one of the founders of their movement. They claim descent from Sun, who is viewed as a proto-communist, and the economic element of Sun&#x27;s ideology was socialism. Brizay noted that Soong Ching-ling did not like Mao Zedong but maintained a good relationship with Zhou Enlai. During Mao&#x27;s era, Jiang Qing envied Soong&#x27;s greater popularity among the people, but Soong remained silent in the face of Mao&#x27;s tyranny. After her death, the Communist government praised her as &quot;a great patriotic, democratic, internationalist and Communist fighter and an outstanding state leader of China,” and also &quot;a seasoned pioneer in the defence of world peace, and an exemplary member of the Communist Party of China.&quot;

In Taiwan, it was until 1965 when there was the first biography in Taiwan to mention Soong Ching-ling as the wife of Sun Yat-sen. The majority of people, except for those who had fled from the mainland, were unaware of Soong Ching-ling until the lifting of martial law in 1987, despite the widespread personality cult surrounding Sun Yat-sen. During the period of time, textbooks in Taiwan referred to Sun’s wife as Lu Muzhen. Soong Mei-ling criticised her sister Ching-ling for &quot;being disloyal to her country, lacking benevolence to the people, failing to fulfil filial piety to her parents, showing infidelity in her marriage, neglecting righteousness to her relatives and friends, disregarding greater justice, showing no reverence for heaven and earth, offering no remonstrance to tyrants, and failing to pacify citizens&quot;.

=== Former residence ===
Several of Soong Ch&#x27;ing-ling&#x27;s former residences have also been transformed into museums:

* In 1918, Soong and her husband Sun Yat-sen lived in a house in the French Concession of Shanghai. After her husband&#x27;s death, Soong continued to reside there until 1937. The house has now been converted into a museum dedicated called the Former Residence of Sun Yat-sen. Though dedicated primarily to Sun, it also contains some of Soong&#x27;s artefacts during their life together.
* From 1948 to 1963 Soong Ching-ling lived in the western end of the French Concession in Shanghai. This building is now the Soong Ching-ling Memorial Residence. A memorial hall containing some of her belongings and photographs stands near the entrance. The main building and gardens are preserved in near original state with original furnishings throughout. In the garage are two large cars: one Chinese built Red Flag limousine and another Russian car presented to Soong by Joseph Stalin.
* Soong Ching-ling obtained a mansion in Beijing in 1963 where she lived and worked for the rest of her life and received many dignitaries. After her death the site was converted into the Former Residence of Soong Ching-ling as a museum and memorial. The rooms and furniture have been kept as she had used them, and memorabilia are displayed.

=== Charitable organisations ===

In 1982, the Chinese government founded the China Soong Ching Ling Foundation, to unite charitable organisations under Soong across China. Soong&#x27;s charitable foundation in Hong Kong is known as Hong Kong Rosamond Foundation.

In 2008, the China Welfare Institute founded Soong Ching Ling School in Shanghai.

<text>The British Antarctic Territory (BAT) is a sector of Antarctica claimed by the United Kingdom as one of its 14 British Overseas Territories, of which it is by far the largest by area. It comprises the region south of 60°S latitude and between longitudes and , forming a wedge shape that extends to the South Pole, overlapped by the Antarctic claims of Argentina (Argentine Antarctica) and Chile (Chilean Antarctic Territory). The claim to the region has been suspended since the Antarctic Treaty came into force in 1961.

The Territory was formed on 3 March 1962, although the UK&#x27;s claim to this portion of the Antarctic dates back to letters patent of 1908 and 1917. The area now covered by the Territory includes three regions which, before 1962, were administered by the British as separate dependencies of the Falkland Islands: Graham Land, the South Orkney Islands, and the South Shetland Islands. The United Kingdom&#x27;s claim to the region has been suspended since the Antarctic Treaty came into force in 1961, Article 4 of which states &quot;No acts or activities taking place while the present Treaty is in force shall constitute a basis for asserting, supporting or denying a claim to territorial sovereignty in Antarctica. No new claim, or enlargement of an existing claim, to territorial sovereignty, shall be asserted while the present Treaty is in force.&quot; Most countries do not recognise territorial claims in Antarctica. The United Kingdom has ratified the treaty.

The territory is inhabited by the staff of research and support stations operated and maintained by the British Antarctic Survey and other organisations, and stations of Argentina, Chile and other countries. There are no native inhabitants. In 2012, the southern part of the territory was named Queen Elizabeth Land in honour of Queen Elizabeth II.

== History ==

The United Kingdom has had a continuous presence in the far South Atlantic since 1833 when it reasserted sovereignty over the Falkland Islands. In 1908, the UK extended its territorial claim by declaring sovereignty over &quot;South Georgia, the South Orkneys, the South Shetlands, the Sandwich Islands, and Graham&#x27;s Land, situated in the South Atlantic Ocean and on the Antarctic continent to the south of the 50th parallel of south latitude, and lying between the 20th and the 80th degrees of west longitude&quot;. All these territories were administered as Falkland Islands Dependencies from Stanley by the Governor of the Falkland Islands.

In 1917, the wording of the claim was modified, so as to, among other things, unambiguously include all the territory in the sector stretching to the South Pole (thus encompassing all of the present-day British Antarctic Territory). The new claim covered &quot;all islands and territories whatsoever between the 20th degree of west longitude and the 50th degree of west longitude which are situated south of the 50th parallel of south latitude; and all islands and territories whatsoever between the 50th degree of west longitude and the 80th degree of west longitude which are situated south of the 58th parallel of south latitude&quot;.

The United Kingdom also claimed Victoria Land in 1841 and Enderby Land in 1930. However, all territory between 160°E and 45°E was transferred to Australia (which itself was part of the British Empire and transferred because of this) in 1933. In 1943, at the height of World War II, the UK undertook a military operation known as Operation Tabarin to provide reconnaissance and meteorological information in the South Atlantic Ocean. This &quot;secret&quot; wartime project became the civilian Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey and later the British Antarctic Survey (BAS). BAS is responsible for most of the United Kingdom&#x27;s scientific research in Antarctica. In the 1950s, the Antarctic Treaty was negotiated to demilitarise the region and retain Antarctica – defined as all land and ice shelves south of 60°S latitude – for peaceful research purposes. The treaty was passed in 1961.

== Recognition ==
The Antarctic Treaty, signed by all relevant regional claimants, does not in itself either recognise or dispute any territorial claims, leaving this matter to individual signatories. Most of the world&#x27;s countries do not recognise any national claims to Antarctica. Australia, France, New Zealand, Norway and the United Kingdom, all of whom have territorial claims on the continent, mutually recognise each other&#x27;s claims. Argentina and Chile dispute the British claim, and have their own claims that overlap both Britain&#x27;s and each other&#x27;s (see Argentine Antarctica and Chilean Antarctic Territory).

== Geography ==

===Topography===
The British Antarctic Territory includes the Antarctic Peninsula, the South Shetland Islands, South Orkney Islands and numerous other offshore islands, the Ronne Ice Shelf (Weddell Sea), and parts of Coats Land. A triangle of central Antarctica converging on the South Pole was named Queen Elizabeth Land in December 2012, in honour of the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II.

Over 99 per cent of the territory&#x27;s land surface is covered by a permanent ice sheet, up to about thick. The highest peak in BAT was thought to be Mount Jackson, on the Antarctic Peninsula, at . However, in 2017 Mount Hope was calculated to be taller at .

===Vegetation===
There are very few plants in the British Antarctic Territories; most of them are mosses and lichens, but there are also two flowering plants: the Antarctic hairgrass and Antarctic pearlwort.

===Wildlife===
Many bird species, including seven species of penguin breed in the British Antarctic Territories. The British Antarctic Territories are also home to six species of seals.

=== Oil and gas reserves ===
In May 2024, it was reported that Russia had discovered extensive oil and gas reserves in the Antarctic, with a significant portion found in areas claimed by the United Kingdom. The estimated reserves, totaling 511 billion barrels of oil, raise concerns about potential drilling in a region protected by the Antarctic Treaty, which prohibits mineral and oil developments. While the UK&#x27;s Foreign Office has expressed trust in Russia&#x27;s assurance of conducting scientific research, critics argue that Russia&#x27;s activities resemble oil and gas prospecting rather than genuine scientific endeavors and questioned The Foreign Office&#x27;s management of the United Kingdom&#x27;s Antarctic interests.

=== Administration ===
The British Antarctic Territory is administered by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO). A Commissioner is appointed and is always the Director of the FCO&#x27;s Overseas Territories Directorate.

The Territory has a full suite of laws and legal and postal administrations. Given the provisions of the Antarctic Treaty System, the Territory does not enforce its laws on foreign nations who maintain scientific bases within the Territory. It is self-financing, with income from the sale of postage stamps and income tax.

The Royal Navy deploys the ice patrol ship, HMS Protector, in South Atlantic and Antarctic waters during the regional summer. The ship fulfills a variety of roles, including support for the British Antarctic Survey. The British Antarctic Survey also operates the RRS Sir David Attenborough in the region during the Antarctic summer, a ship owned by the Natural Environment Research Council.

== Nationality law ==

The territory is fully a part of the British Overseas Territories for nationality purposes. It is possible to hold British Overseas Territories citizenship (BOTC) by virtue of a connection with the territory. Additionally, since the relevant provisions of the British Overseas Territories Act 2002 came into force on 21 May 2002, a BOTC connected with the territory would also hold British citizenship.

Although this territory&#x27;s immigration laws would not allow for naturalisation, a person born in the territory before 1983 would hold BOTC (and British citizenship) on that basis. British citizenship and BOTC would also extend to the first generation born overseas. Since Emilio Palma was born in the Antarctic territories claimed by the UK prior to 1983, he automatically had British nationality at birth. Since his parents were both Argentine citizens and he was born at an Argentine base, he was automatically granted Argentine citizenship by the Argentine government.

Changes to British nationality law from 1 January 1983 mean that a child born in the territory can only gain BOTC and/or British citizenship if his/her father or mother holds BOTC and/or British citizenship or if his/her father or mother is &quot;ordinarily resident&quot; in the territory in compliance with the relevant immigration legislation. This effectively prevents any more children born in Argentine or Chilean bases within the area of the British claim being able to claim BOTC or British citizenship by virtue of being born within the territory.

== Research stations ==
The British Antarctic Survey has two permanently staffed facilities in the Territory: Halley Research Station and Rothera Research Station.

Signy Research Station was operated from 1947 until 1996 and now is only staffed in the summer. There are also two summer-only forward operating stations at Fossil Bluff and Sky Blu. Faraday was maintained until 1996, when it was sold to Ukraine and renamed Akademik Vernadsky Station.

Since 1996, the historic base at Port Lockroy on Goudier Island has been staffed by the UK Antarctic Heritage Trust during the Antarctic summer. Receiving about 10,000 visitors a year, it is one of the most visited sites on the continent. Visitors can tour the museum, buy souvenirs, post mail, and view the large gentoo penguin colony. Argentine presence in the territory dates to the foundation of the Orcadas Base, South Orkney Islands, in 1903. A number of other nations maintain bases in the territory, many in the South Shetland Islands.

== Postage stamps and coins ==

Despite the lack of permanent inhabitants, the British Antarctic Territory issues its own postage stamps. While some are actually used by visiting tourists and resident scientists, the bulk are sold overseas to collectors. The first issue came in 1963, an engraved set with 15 values ranging from ½d to one pound, featuring a portrait of Queen Elizabeth overlooking various scenes of human activity in Antarctica. Several additional issues in the 1960s were followed by a decimalisation issue in 1971 produced by overprinting the 1963 stamps.

In 2008–2009, as part of the celebrations of the centenary of the 1908 British territorial claim, the British Antarctic Territory issued its first ever legal-tender coin.

== Queen Elizabeth Land ==

On 18 December 2012, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office announced that the southern part of British Antarctic Territory has been named Queen Elizabeth Land in honour of Queen Elizabeth II in her Diamond Jubilee year. The area, the southern third of the territory, has an area of about – almost twice the size of the United Kingdom – and is roughly triangular in shape, with the South Pole at one apex and with the and lines of longitude forming the eastern and western boundaries. The northern boundary is formed by the Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf on the west and by Coats Land on the east.

The name &quot;Queen Elizabeth Land&quot; will be used in future on all British maps, but due to the unique status of Antarctica, it will be up to other countries to recognise the name if they see fit. Argentina, which lays claim to part of the area, criticised the naming.

<text>Saliva (commonly referred to as spit or drool) is an extracellular fluid produced and secreted by salivary glands in the mouth. In humans, saliva is around 99% water, plus electrolytes, mucus, white blood cells, epithelial cells (from which DNA can be extracted), enzymes (such as lipase and amylase), and antimicrobial agents (such as secretory IgA, and lysozymes).

The enzymes found in saliva are essential in beginning the process of digestion of dietary starches and fats. These enzymes also play a role in breaking down food particles entrapped within dental crevices, thus protecting teeth from bacterial decay. Saliva also performs a lubricating function, wetting food and permitting the initiation of swallowing, and protecting the oral mucosa from drying out.

Saliva has specialized purposes for a variety of animal species beyond predigestion. Certain swifts construct nests with their sticky saliva. The foundation of bird&#x27;s nest soup is an aerodramus nest. Venomous saliva injected by fangs is used by cobras, vipers, and certain other members of the venom clade to hunt. Some caterpillars use modified salivary glands to store silk proteins, which they then use to make silk fiber.

==Composition==
Produced in salivary glands, human saliva comprises 99.5% water, but also contains many important substances, including electrolytes, mucus, antibacterial compounds and various enzymes. Medically, constituents of saliva can noninvasively provide important diagnostic information related to oral and systemic diseases.

* Water: 99.5%
* Electrolytes:
** 2–21 mmol/L sodium (lower than blood plasma)
** 10–36 mmol/L potassium (higher than plasma)
** 1.2–2.8 mmol/L calcium (similar to plasma)
** 0.08–0.5 mmol/L magnesium
** 5–40 mmol/L chloride (lower than plasma)
** 25 mmol/L bicarbonate (higher than plasma)
** 1.4–39 mmol/L phosphate
** Iodine (mmol/L concentration is usually higher than plasma, but dependent variable according to dietary iodine intake)
* Mucus (mucus in saliva mainly consists of mucopolysaccharides and glycoproteins)
* Antibacterial compounds (thiocyanate, hydrogen peroxide, and secretory immunoglobulin A)
* Epidermal growth factor (EGF)
* Saliva eliminates caesium, which can substitute for potassium in the cells.
* Various enzymes; most notably:
** α-amylase (EC3.2.1.1), or ptyalin, secreted by the acinar cells of the parotid and submandibular glands, starts the digestion of starch before the food is even swallowed; it has a pH optimum of 7.4
** Lingual lipase, which is secreted by the acinar cells of the sublingual gland; has a pH optimum around 4.0 so it is not activated until entering the acidic environment of the stomach
**Kallikrein, an enzyme that proteolytically cleaves high-molecular-weight kininogen to produce bradykinin, which is a vasodilator; it is secreted by the acinar cells of all three major salivary glands
** Antimicrobial enzymes that kill bacteria:
***Lysozyme
***Salivary lactoperoxidase
***Lactoferrin
***Immunoglobulin A
***Beta defensin
**Proline-rich proteins (function in enamel formation, Ca2+-binding, microbe killing and lubrication)
** Minor enzymes including: salivary acid phosphatases A+B, N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase, NAD(P)H dehydrogenase (quinone), superoxide dismutase, glutathione transferase, class 3 aldehyde dehydrogenase, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, and tissue kallikrein (function unknown)
* Cells: possibly as many as 8 million human and 500 million bacterial cells per mL. The presence of bacterial products (small organic acids, amines, and thiols) causes saliva to sometimes exhibit a foul odor.
* Opiorphin, a pain-killing substance found in human saliva
* Haptocorrin, a protein which binds to vitamin B12 to protect it against degradation in the stomach, before it binds to intrinsic factor.

==Daily salivary output==
Experts debate the amount of saliva that a healthy person produces. Production is estimated at 1500ml per day and researchers generally accept that during sleep the amount drops significantly.
In humans, the submandibular gland contributes around 70 to 75% of secretions, while the parotid gland secretes about 20 to 25%; small amounts are secreted from the other salivary glands.

==Functions==
Saliva contributes to the digestion of food and to the maintenance of oral hygiene. Without normal salivary function the frequency of dental caries, gum disease (gingivitis and periodontitis), and other oral problems increases significantly. Saliva limits the growth of bacterial pathogens and is a major factor in sustaining systemic and oral health through the prevention of tooth decay and the removal of sugars and other food sources for microbes.

===Lubricant===
Saliva coats the oral mucosa mechanically protecting it from trauma during eating, swallowing, and speaking. Mouth soreness is very common in people with reduced saliva (xerostomia) and food (especially dry food) sticks to the inside of the mouth. Saliva is also oftentimes used as a lubricant in sexual acts, especially anal.

===Digestion===
The digestive functions of saliva include moistening food and helping to create a food bolus. The lubricative function of saliva allows the food bolus to be passed easily from the mouth into the esophagus. Saliva contains the enzyme amylase, also called ptyalin, which is capable of breaking down starch into simpler sugars such as maltose and dextrin that can be further broken down in the small intestine. About 30% of starch digestion takes place in the mouth cavity. Salivary glands also secrete salivary lipase (a more potent form of lipase) to begin fat digestion. Salivary lipase plays a large role in fat digestion in newborn infants as their pancreatic lipase still needs some time to develop.

===Role in taste===
Saliva is very important in the sense of taste. It is the liquid medium in which chemicals are carried to taste receptor cells (mostly associated with lingual papillae). People with little saliva often complain of dysgeusia (i.e. disordered taste, e.g. reduced ability to taste, or having a bad, metallic taste at all times). A rare condition identified to affect taste is that of &quot;&quot;, or excessive amounts of sodium in saliva that is &quot;not&quot; caused by any other condition (e.g., &quot;Sjögren syndrome&quot;), causing everything to taste &#x27;salty&#x27;.

===Other===
* Saliva maintains the pH of the mouth. Saliva is supersaturated with various ions. Certain salivary proteins prevent precipitation, which would form salts. These ions act as a buffer, keeping the acidity of the mouth within a certain range, typically pH 6.2–7.4. This prevents minerals in the dental hard tissues from dissolving.
* Saliva secretes carbonic anhydrase (gustin), which is thought to play a role in the development of taste buds.
* Saliva contains EGF. EGF results in cellular proliferation, differentiation, and survival. EGF is a low-molecular-weight polypeptide first purified from the mouse submandibular gland, but since then found in many human tissues including submandibular gland, parotid gland. Salivary EGF, which seems also regulated by dietary inorganic iodine, also plays an important physiological role in the maintenance of oro-esophageal and gastric tissue integrity. The biological effects of salivary EGF include healing of oral and gastroesophageal ulcers, inhibition of gastric acid secretion, stimulation of DNA synthesis as well as mucosal protection from intraluminal injurious factors such as gastric acid, bile acids, pepsin, and trypsin and to physical, chemical and bacterial agents.

==Production==
The production of saliva is stimulated both by the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic.

Sympathetic stimulation of saliva is to facilitate respiration, whereas parasympathetic stimulation is to facilitate digestion.

Parasympathetic stimulation leads to acetylcholine (ACh) release onto the salivary acinar cells. ACh binds to muscarinic receptors, specifically M3, and causes an increased intracellular calcium ion concentration (through the IP3/DAG second messenger system). Increased calcium causes vesicles within the cells to fuse with the apical cell membrane leading to secretion. ACh also causes the salivary gland to release kallikrein, an enzyme that converts kininogen to lysyl-bradykinin. Lysyl-bradykinin acts upon blood vessels and capillaries of the salivary gland to generate vasodilation and increased capillary permeability, respectively. The resulting increased blood flow to the acini allows the production of more saliva. In addition, Substance P can bind to Tachykinin NK-1 receptors leading to increased intracellular calcium concentrations and subsequently increased saliva secretion. Lastly, both parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous stimulation can lead to myoepithelium contraction which causes the expulsion of secretions from the secretory acinus into the ducts and eventually to the oral cavity.

Sympathetic stimulation results in the release of norepinephrine. Norepinephrine binding to α-adrenergic receptors will cause an increase in intracellular calcium levels leading to more fluid vs. protein secretion. If norepinephrine binds β-adrenergic receptors, it will result in more protein or enzyme secretion vs. fluid secretion. Stimulation by norepinephrine initially decreases blood flow to the salivary glands due to constriction of blood vessels but this effect is overtaken by vasodilation caused by various local vasodilators.

Saliva production may also be pharmacologically stimulated by the so-called sialagogues. It can also be suppressed by the so-called antisialagogues.

==Behaviour==

===Spitting===
Spitting is the act of forcibly ejecting saliva or other substances from the mouth. In many parts of the world, it is considered rude and a social taboo, and has sometimes been outlawed. In some countries, for example, it has been outlawed for reasons of public decency and attempting to reduce the spread of disease. These laws may not strictly enforced, but in Singapore, the fine for spitting may be as high as SGD$2,000 for multiple offenses, and one can even be arrested. In China, expectoration is more socially acceptable (even if officially disapproved of or illegal), and spittoons are still a common appearance in some cultures. Some animals, even humans in some cases, use spitting as an automatic defensive maneuver. Camels are well known for doing this, though most domestic camels are trained not to.

Spitting by an infected person (for example, one with SARS-CoV-2) whose saliva contains large amounts of virus, is a health hazard to the public.

===Glue to construct bird nests===
Many birds in the swift family, Apodidae, produce a viscous saliva during nesting season to glue together materials to construct a nest. Two species of swifts in the genus Aerodramus build their nests using only their saliva, the base for bird&#x27;s nest soup.

===Wound licking===
A common belief is that saliva contained in the mouth has natural disinfectants, which leads people to believe it is beneficial to &quot;lick their wounds&quot;. Researchers at the University of Florida at Gainesville have discovered a protein called nerve growth factor (NGF) in the saliva of mice. Wounds doused with NGF healed twice as fast as untreated and unlicked wounds; therefore, saliva can help to heal wounds in some species. NGF has been found in human saliva, as well as antibacterial agents as secretory mucin, IgA, lactoferrin, lysozyme and peroxidase. It has not been shown that human licking of wounds disinfects them, but licking is likely to help clean the wound by removing larger contaminants such as dirt and may help to directly remove infective bodies by brushing them away. Therefore, licking would be a way of wiping off pathogens, useful if clean water is not available to the animal or person.

===Classical conditioning===

In Pavlov&#x27;s experiment, dogs were conditioned to salivate in response to a ringing bell; this stimulus is associated with a meal or hunger. Salivary secretion is also associated with nausea. Saliva is usually formed in the mouth through an act called , which can be voluntary or involuntary.

===Making alcoholic beverages===
Some old cultures use chewed grains to produce alcoholic beverages, such as chicha, kasiri or sake.

==Substitutes==
A number of commercially available saliva substitutes exist.

<text>Adobe GoLive was a WYSIWYG HTML editor and web site management application from Adobe Systems. It replaced Adobe PageMill as Adobe&#x27;s primary HTML editor and was itself discontinued in favor of Dreamweaver. The last version of GoLive that Adobe released was GoLive 9.

==History==

GoLive originated as the flagship product of a company named GoNet Communication, Inc. then based in Menlo Park, California, and the development company GoNet Communications GmbH in Hamburg, Germany, in 1996. Later GoNet changed its name to GoLive Systems, Inc, and the name of its product to GoLive CyberStudio. Adobe acquired GoLive in 1999 and re-branded the GoLive CyberStudio product to what became Adobe GoLive. Adobe took over the Hamburg office as an Adobe development site to continue to develop the product.

At the time of the acquisition, CyberStudio was a Macintosh-only application. In the spring of 1999 Adobe released Adobe GoLive for both Macintosh and Microsoft Windows.

The first versions of Dreamweaver and CyberStudio were released in a similar timeframe. However, Dreamweaver eventually became the dominant WYSIWYG HTML editor in market share. After the Adobe acquisition of Macromedia (the company that had owned Dreamweaver), GoLive was progressively re-targeted toward Adobe&#x27;s traditional design market, and the product became better integrated with Adobe&#x27;s existing suite of design-oriented software products and less focused on the professional web development market.

The Adobe CS2 Premium suite contained GoLive CS2. With the release of Creative Suite 3, Adobe integrated Dreamweaver as a replacement for GoLive and released GoLive 9 as a standalone product.

In April 2008, Adobe announced that sales and development of GoLive would cease in favor of Dreamweaver.

==General description and distinctive aspects==
GoLive incorporated a largely modeless workflow that relied heavily on drag-and-drop. Most user interaction was done via a contextual inspector rather than the modal workflow found in Dreamweaver. Among its features were a separate editor for tables that supported nesting, and a two-dimensional panel for applying CSS styles to elements. GoLive supported drag-and-drop of native Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator files via what the company called &quot;Smart Objects&quot;, which then automatically guided the user through saving those files in web-supported formats. Updates to the original Photoshop or Illustrator assets were automatically tracked by GoLive. It also implemented a tool called &quot;Components&quot; which allowed updates to interface elements throughout a site to be updated globally by changing one single file. As a website management tool, GoLive allowed users to transfer and publish content directly from within the application, and allowed individual files to be excluded from uploading.

==Features==
One of the new features of GoLive version 5 was Dynamic Link, which was a method of creating dynamic, database-driven web content without the need to know a server-side language and with full WYSIWYG support in the GoLive user interface.

GoLive had a powerful set of extensibility API which could be used to add additional functionality to the product. The GoLive SDK provided interfaces which allowed developers to use a combination of XML, JavaScript and C/C++ to create plugins for the product. The extensibility API allowed developers access to custom drawing and event handling using JavaScript, as well as a full JavaScript debugger and command line interpreter. This allowed intermediate-level developers using interpreted JavaScript to create sophisticated user interfaces.

==Language and framework structure==
Adobe GoLive is coded in the C++ programming language. It uses a custom C++ framework called SCL (Simple Class Library) which was initially built from scratch by the engineers at GoLive Systems Inc. The SCL framework was also used in the short-lived Adobe Atmosphere 3D software.

==Release history==

As the final version, GoLive 9 was discontinued in April 2008.

<text>Michael Jeter (; August 26, 1952 – March 30, 2003) was an American actor. Known for his career on stage and screen, Jeter played diverse characters. He won a Tony Award and a Primetime Emmy Award. He portrayed Herman Stiles on the sitcom &quot;Evening Shade&quot; from 1990 until 1994.

Jeter was born in Lawrenceburg, Tennessee. He studied at Memphis State University and later pursued a career in acting. He made his Broadway debut acting in the musical &quot;Once in a Lifetime&quot; (1979), followed by &quot;G. R. Point&quot;. For his role as Otto Kringelein in the musical &quot;Grand Hotel&quot; (1989) he received a Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical. Jeter also portrayed Giuseppe Zangara in the musical &quot;Assassins&quot; (1989).

Jeter gained fame for his roles in &quot;The Fisher King&quot; (1991) and &quot;The Green Mile&quot; (1999). His other notable film roles include in &quot;Zelig&quot; (1983), &quot;Miller&#x27;s Crossing&quot; (1990), &quot;Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit&quot; (1993), &quot;Air Bud&quot; (1997), &quot;Mouse Hunt&quot; (1997), &quot;Patch Adams&quot; (1998), &quot;Jurassic Park III&quot; (2001), &quot;Open Range&quot; (2003), and &quot;The Polar Express&quot; (2004). He also appeared on &quot;Sesame Street&#x27;s Elmo&#x27;s World&quot; as the other Mister Noodle from 2000 to 2003.

== Early life and education ==
Jeter was born in Lawrenceburg, Tennessee on August 26, 1952. His mother, Virginia (née Raines; May 6, 1927 – May 21, 2019), was a housewife. His father, William Claud Jeter (March 10, 1922 – March 1, 2010), was a dentist. Jeter had one brother, William, and four sisters, Virginia, Amanda, Emily, and Lori. Jeter was a student at Memphis State University (now the University of Memphis) when his interests changed from medicine to acting. He performed in several plays and musicals at the Circuit Theatre and its sister theatre, the Playhouse on the Square, in midtown Memphis. He left Memphis to further pursue his stage career in Baltimore, Maryland.

==Career==

Jeter&#x27;s woebegone look, extreme flexibility, and high energy led Tommy Tune to cast him in the off-Broadway play &quot;Cloud 9&quot; in 1981. Much of his work specialised in playing eccentric, pretentious, or wimpy characters, as in &quot;The Fisher King&quot;, &quot;Waterworld&quot;, &quot;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas&quot;, &quot;The Green Mile&quot; and &quot;Drop Zone&quot;. Occasionally, Jeter was able to stray from type for more diverse characters, such as those he portrayed in &quot;Jurassic Park III&quot;, &quot;Air Bud&quot;, and &quot;Open Range&quot;. Jeter is perhaps most known for his role as convicted felon Eduard Delacroix in &quot;The Green Mile&quot;, a role for which he was nominated along with the rest of the cast for a Screen Actors Guild Award.

In &quot;The Fisher King&quot;, Jeter portrayed &quot;an unnamed homeless cabaret singer&quot;, and &quot;shimmies across the screen with boundless confidence, turning what might have been a grotesque, or at least merely humorous, part into something noble, even indomitable... In a film unafraid of big acting, Jeter goes bigger than anyone.&quot;

He also played Mr. Noodle&#x27;s brother, Mister Noodle, on &quot;Sesame Street&quot; from 2000 to 2003. He appeared in an episode of &quot;Touched by an Angel&quot; in 1999 as Gus, an insurance salesman who arrives in Las Vegas, in the episode &quot;The Man Upstairs&quot;. His last two appearances were in the films &quot;Open Range&quot; and &quot;The Polar Express&quot;. Both films were in post-production at the time of his death and, when released, contained a dedication to his memory. The season 35 premiere of &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, a special entitled &quot;The Street We Live On&quot;, was similarly dedicated to Jeter.

==Personal life and death==
Jeter was gay and met his partner Sean Blue in 1995; they were together until Jeter&#x27;s death in 2003.

Jeter was HIV-positive and disclosed his diagnosis in a 1997 interview on &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot;. Despite this, he remained healthy for many years. Jeter also announced while accepting his 1990 Tony that he had recovered from substance abuse.

On March 30, 2003, Jeter was found dead by Blue at his home in Hollywood Hills, California. He was 50 years old. Blue said that Jeter died of complications after an epileptic seizure. Jeter was cremated, and his ashes were given to charity.

<text>Arturo Gatti (April 15, 1972 – July 11, 2009) was a Canadian professional boxer who competed from 1991 to 2007.

A world champion in two weight classes, Gatti held the IBF junior lightweight title from 1995 to 1998, and the WBC super lightweight title from 2004 to 2005. He also participated in &quot;The Ring&quot; magazine&#x27;s Fight of the Year a total of four times (1997, 1998, 2002, and 2003). He announced his retirement on July 14, 2007. After his death in 2009, Gatti was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame on December 10, 2012, in his first year of eligibility, becoming the tenth Canadian boxer to be so inducted.

Gatti was born in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. He is the young brother of ex-professional boxer Joe Gatti. Gatti eventually relocated to Jersey City, New Jersey, as a teenager where he found a manager he trusted and decided to turn pro. He returned to Montreal after retiring from boxing to work in real estate.

He died under mysterious circumstances in 2009. His Brazilian wife was arrested for his homicide, then released after an autopsy done in Brazil ruled his death was a suicide. Subsequent American and Canadian investigations could not agree on Gatti&#x27;s cause of death, and discovered a history of suicidal ideation.

== Professional career ==
Arturo Gatti was a member of the Canadian National team, and was training to represent Canada at the 1992 Summer Games, but in 1991, at age 19, he decided to turn pro instead. He began boxing professionally on the night of June 10, 1991, with a third-round knockout of Jose Gonzalez in Secaucus, New Jersey. He went undefeated for six bouts before losing to King Solomon by split decision in six rounds on November 17, 1992.

His next fight, on March 24, 1993, was his first fight abroad, where he visited Amsterdam, Netherlands and knocked out Plawen Goutchev in round one.

In 1994, he beat Leon Bostic, and followed through with a Round 1 knockout over Pete Taliaferro to win the USBA super featherweight title. He retained the title against Richard Salazar and former world champion Jose Sanabria.

=== Signing with HBO ===
On December 15, 1995, Gatti challenged the IBF super featherweight Champion Tracy Harris Patterson, Floyd Patterson&#x27;s adoptive son. Gatti became world champion when he outpointed Patterson (scoring: 116–111, 115–112, 114–113) and signed a multi-fight deal with HBO to fight on HBO Boxing.

He only had two fights in 1996, once defending his world title. His title defense, at Madison Square Garden against Dominican Wilson Rodriguez was the first of three Gatti fights in a row to be named a candidate for &quot;Fight of the Year&quot; by &quot;The Ring&quot;. Dropped in round two and with his right eye closing fast, Gatti knocked Rodriguez down in round five with a left hook to the body, before finishing him off in round six to retain the title.

In 1997, he again won a points victory over Patterson, but this time by a larger margin (118–108, 117–109, 116–110). He then scored a technical knockout over former world champion Calvin Grove in the seventh round of a non-title affair. Then came his defense against former world champion Gabriel Ruelas, which was also named &quot;Fight of the Year&quot; by &quot;The Ring&quot;. Rocked by a left uppercut in the fourth, Gatti absorbed more than 15 consecutive punches before being saved by the bell. In the fifth, with Ruelas again the aggressor and looking close to victory, Gatti connected with a left hook that lifted Ruelas off the canvas and resulted in the knock out.

=== To the lightweight division ===
After that fight, Gatti relinquished the world title, going up in weight to the lightweight division. However, 1998 was a bad year for him, as he lost all three of his fights that year. He lost by a technical knockout in round eight to Angel Manfredy, and then lost a pair of close 10-round decisions to Ivan Robinson, the first by split decision, the second by unanimous. In Gatti–Robinson II, Gatti had a point deducted in the eighth round for low blows. Had the point not been deducted, the fight would have been a draw, as Robinson was ahead by only one point on two scorecards. Gatti–Robinson I was chosen &quot;Fight of the Year&quot; by &quot;The Ring&quot;, thus marking the second year in a row that a Gatti fight was given that award and the third year in a row a Gatti fight was nominated.

He only had one fight in 1999, knocking out Reyes Munoz in round one.

=== Controversial fight against Gamache ===
Gatti&#x27;s first fight of 2000 proved to be controversial. Faced with former world champion Joey Gamache, Gatti won by a knockout in round two. A subsequent lawsuit by Gamache&#x27;s handlers claimed Gatti had gained 19 pounds since the weigh-in the day before and thus had a large advantage over Gamache. In the wake of the fight, boxing regulators pushed for a new law limiting the amount of weight a competitor can gain between the weigh-in and time of the fight. Gatti was also accused by Gamache&#x27;s handlers of not having actually made the contracted weight of 141 pounds. After Gatti–Gamache, some boxing commissions started weighing boxers a second time.

Gatti also won his two other fights that year, against Eric Jukabuwski and Joe Hutchinson.

=== Fight against De La Hoya and trilogy against Micky Ward ===


In 2001, Gatti only had one fight, going up in weight to meet welterweight Oscar De La Hoya, who beat him by a technical knockout in five rounds. In 2002, Gatti returned to the light welterweight division and defeated former world champion Terronn Millett by a knockout in round four.

He then split two ten-round decisions with &quot;Irish&quot; Micky Ward, losing their first bout, but winning their second. Gatti-Ward I also earned &quot;Fight of the Year&quot; honors by Ring Magazine, and the 9th round was called the Round of the Century by Emanuel Steward.

On June 7, 2003, he and Ward had a . Gatti broke his twice-repaired right hand when he struck Ward&#x27;s hip bone with an attempted body shot in the fourth, and he dropped his arm. In the sixth, Gatti dominated the round, but got caught with an overhand to the top of the head a second before the bell rang and went down. Gatti would win the match by unanimous decision. The third fight between the two was again named &quot;Fight of the Year&quot; by &quot;Ring Magazine&quot;.

Gatti vs Ward I &amp; III are also part of HBO&#x27;s 10 best fights of the decade.

=== Career after Micky Ward ===
On January 24, 2004, Gatti, having recovered from a broken hand, scored a tenth round knock-down and defeated Gianluca Branco of Italy by a 12-round unanimous decision to win the vacant WBC light welterweight title.

On July 24, 2004, he knocked out the previously unbeaten former world champion Leonard Dorin Doroftei in two rounds at Atlantic City, to retain his title.

Gatti&#x27;s second defense of his WBC title came against former WBC super featherweight Champion Jesse James Leija on January 29, 2005. Gatti beat Leija by a fifth-round knockout.
Gatti&#x27;s protege, Danny &quot;Little Mac&quot; McDermott made his professional debut on the undercard with a victory over Alex Matos.

In his next fight, Gatti fought former super featherweight and lightweight world champion Floyd Mayweather Jr. on June 25, 2005. He took a horrific beating and Gatti&#x27;s corner man threw in the towel after he was beaten around the ring, thus ending his title reign via sixth-round technical knockout.

After the loss to Mayweather, Gatti moved up to the welterweight division. He beat Thomas Damgaard on January 28, 2006, by an eleventh-round technical knockout to win the vacant IBA welterweight title and become a champion in 3 different weight divisions.

On July 22, 2006, Gatti lost by a TKO to Carlos Baldomir, vying for the WBC &amp; &quot;The Ring&quot; welterweight championship. He then broke off his relationship with Buddy McGirt and had a new trainer in Micky Ward.

=== Final fight and retirement ===
Gatti attempted a comeback on July 14, 2007, against Alfonso Gomez, only to get TKO&#x27;d by Gomez. After the fight, Gatti announced his retirement in the dressing room, reportedly quipping: &quot;I&#x27;m coming back — as a spectator.&quot;

Gatti retired with a record of 40 wins and 9 losses, with 31 wins by knockout. On September 24, 2008, reports had surfaced that Gatti was considering a comeback against Montreal welterweight Antonin Décarie, the Canadian and North American Boxing Organization champion. On December 10, 2012, he was voted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame.

== Fighting style ==
Arturo was an aggressive, all-action fighter, often remembered as a slugger. Early on in his career, Gatti showed his tremendous punching power as he amassed a large number of first-round knockouts. Although he had the ability to box many opponents (as shown in the second Micky Ward fight) Gatti would often get into brawls when his opponents were able to take the power and fight back. This is why many of his bouts against good opposition were slug-fests.

Gatti had incredible heart, and a very good chin, shown in the majority of his major fights. He was able to absorb incredible amounts of punishment by fighters such as Wilson Rodriguez, Gabriel Ruelas, Angel Manfredy, Ivan Robinson, Oscar De La Hoya, Micky Ward, Floyd Mayweather and Carlos Baldomir, none of whom could knock him out cold. In his first title defence against Wilson Rodriguez at Madison Square Garden he showed off his recuperative abilities as he was close to being stopped under a barrage of shots and in the next round he stopped his opponent.

Oscar De La Hoya, who faced many big punchers from 130 pounds to 160 pounds, says Gatti hit him the hardest out of any fighter.

== Death ==
On July 11, 2009, Gatti was found dead in a hotel in Ipojuca, Pernambuco, Brazil, where he was on holiday with his Brazilian wife, Amanda Rodrigues, and their 10-month-old son. He was 37 years old. Gatti&#x27;s wife was initially charged with murder after Brazilian authorities ruled Gatti&#x27;s death a homicide, but after the coroner&#x27;s autopsy report was released, they declared it was a suicide by hanging, and charges against his widow were dropped. Gatti had a history of suicidal threats and had previously attempted suicide in 2006.

On July 31, 2009, it was announced that the Canadian government would be seeking more information from the Brazilian authorities on Gatti&#x27;s death. Gatti&#x27;s family confirmed that there would be a second autopsy done in Quebec.

Two independent investigators hired by Gatti&#x27;s longtime manager Pat Lynch released a statement in September 2011 that they believed Gatti was murdered. A contributing factor to their conclusion was an injury to the back of Gatti&#x27;s head that they believed could not have been self inflicted. After receiving the independent investigators&#x27; findings, Brazilian authorities again concluded that Gatti died by suicide.

At the family&#x27;s request, a Quebec coroner agreed to exhume the body so that two pathologists could conduct a second autopsy. After an autopsy, the pathologists ruled there was &quot;no clear evidence of foul play&quot; and expressed doubt at the conclusions reached by the private investigators hired by Gatti&#x27;s manager. CBC&#x27;s The Fifth Estate and HBO&#x27;s Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel both interviewed witnesses who stated Gatti assaulted his wife in public the night before his death, and that the injuries to the back of his head came as result of Gatti fighting with a passer-by who attempted to intervene.

<doc id="204433" wikidata="Q617087" url="?curid=204433" title="Macrotis">
<text>Macrotis is a genus of desert-dwelling marsupial omnivores known as bilbies or rabbit-bandicoots; they are members of the order Peramelemorphia. 

At the time of European colonisation of Australia, there were two species. The lesser bilby became extinct in the 1950s; the greater bilby survives but remains endangered. It is currently listed as a vulnerable species. The greater bilby is on average long, excluding the tail, which is usually around long. Its fur is usually grey or white; it has a long, pointy nose and very long ears, hence the reference of its nickname to rabbits.

== Taxonomy ==
&quot;Macrotis&quot; means &#x27;big-eared&#x27; ( + &#x27;ear&#x27;) in Greek, referring to the animal&#x27;s large, long ears.
The genus name was first proposed as a subgeneric classification, which after a century of taxonomic confusion was eventually stabilised as the accepted name in a 1932 revision by Ellis Troughton. In reviewing the systematic arrangement of the genus, Troughton recognised three species names, including one highly variable population with six subspecies.

The family&#x27;s current name &quot;Thylacomyidae&quot; is derived from an invalid synonym &quot;Thylacomys&quot;, meaning &#x27;pouched mouse&#x27;, from the Ancient Greek &#x27; (, &#x27;pouch, sack&#x27;) and &#x27; (, &#x27;mouse, muscle&#x27;), sometimes misspelt &quot;Thalacomys&quot;.

The term &quot;bilby&quot; is a loanword from the Yuwaalaraay Aboriginal language of northern New South Wales, meaning long-nosed rat. It is known as &quot;dalgite&quot; in Western Australia, and in South Australia, &quot;pinkie&quot; is sometimes used. The Wiradjuri of New South Wales also call it &quot;bilby&quot;.
Gerard Krefft recorded the name &quot;Jacko&quot; used by the peoples of the lower Darling in 1864, emended to &quot;Jecko&quot; in 1866 along with &quot;Wuirrapur&quot; from the peoples at the lower Murray River.

=== Classification ===

The placement of the population within taxonomic classification has changed in recent years. Vaughan (1978) and Groves and Flannery (1990) both placed this family within the family Peramelidae. Kirsch et al. (1997) found them to be distinct from the species in Peroryctidae (which is now a subfamily in Peramelidae). McKenna and Bell (1997) also placed it in Peramelidae, but as the sister of &quot;Chaeropus&quot; in the subfamily Chaeropodinae.

Here is a summary of the treatment as a peramelemorph family:
* Peramelemorphia
:* Thylacomyidae
::* Genus &quot;Macrotis&quot;
:::* &quot;Macrotis lagotis&quot;, extant
:::* &quot;Macrotis leucura&quot;, extinct
:*Chaeropodidae (pig-footed bandicoots, extinct)
:*Peramelidae (genera known as bandicoots, extant and extinct)

Fossil taxa allied to the family are:
* Genus †&quot;Ischnodon&quot;
:* †&quot;Ischnodon australis&quot;
* Genus †&quot;Liyamayi&quot;
:* †&quot;Liyamayi dayi&quot;

== Description ==
Bilbies have the characteristic long bandicoot muzzle and very big ears that radiate heat. They are about long. Compared to bandicoots, they have a longer tail, bigger ears, and softer, silky fur. The size of their ears allows them to have better hearing. They are nocturnal omnivores that do not need to drink water, as they obtain their moisture from food, which includes insects and their larvae, seeds, spiders, bulbs, fruit, fungi, and very small animals. Most food is found by digging or scratching in the soil, and using their very long tongues.

Unlike bandicoots, they are excellent burrowers and build extensive tunnel systems with their strong forelimbs and well-developed claws. A bilby typically makes a number of burrows within its home range, up to about a dozen, and moves between them, using them for shelter both from predators and the heat of the day. The female bilby&#x27;s pouch faces backwards, which prevents the pouch from getting filled with dirt while she is digging.

Bilbies have a gestation of about 12–14 days, one of the shortest among mammals.

The appearance of the bilby has been alluded to as &quot;Australia’s answer to the Easter rabbit&quot;.

== Conservation ==
Bilbies are slowly becoming endangered because of habitat loss and change, and competition with other animals. There is a national recovery plan being developed for saving them. This program includes captive breeding, monitoring populations, and reestablishing bilbies where they once lived. There have been reasonably successful moves to popularise the bilby as a native alternative to the Easter Bunny by selling chocolate Easter Bilbies (sometimes with a portion of the profits going to bilby protection and research). Reintroduction efforts have begun, with a successful reintroduction into the Arid Recovery Reserve in South Australia in 2000, and a reintroduction into Currawinya National Park in Queensland, where six bilbies were released into a predator-proof enclosure in April 2019.

Successful reintroductions have also occurred on the Peron Peninsula in Western Australia as a part of the Western Shield program, and at other conservation lands, including islands and the Australian Wildlife Conservancy&#x27;s Scotia and Yookamurra Sanctuaries. There is a highly successful bilby breeding program at Kanyana Wildlife Rehabilitation Centre near Perth, Western Australia.

== Evolution ==
The bilby lineage extends back 15 million years. In 2014 scientists found part of a 15-million-year-old fossilised jaw of a bilby which had shorter teeth that were probably used for eating forest fruit. Prior to this discovery, the oldest bilby fossil on record was 5 million years old. Modern bilbies have evolved to have long teeth used to dig holes in the desert to eat worms and insects.

It is thought the bilby diverged from its closest relative, an originally-carnivorous bandicoot, 20 million years ago.

<text>Adobe PageMaker (formerly Aldus PageMaker) is a desktop publishing computer program introduced in 1985 by the Aldus Corporation on the Apple Macintosh. The combination of the Macintosh&#x27;s graphical user interface, PageMaker publishing software, and the Apple LaserWriter laser printer marked the beginning of the desktop publishing revolution. Ported to PCs running Windows 1.0 in 1987, PageMaker helped to popularize both the Macintosh platform and the Windows environment.

A key component that led to PageMaker&#x27;s success was its native support for Adobe Systems&#x27; PostScript page description language. After Adobe purchased the majority of Aldus&#x27;s assets (including FreeHand, PressWise, PageMaker, etc.) in 1994 and subsequently phased out the Aldus name, version 6 was released. The program remained a major force in the high-end DTP market through the early 1990s, but new features were slow in coming. By the mid-1990s, it faced increasing competition from QuarkXPress on the Mac, and to a lesser degree, Ventura on the PC, and by the end of the decade it was no longer a major force. Quark proposed buying the product and canceling it, but instead, in 1999 Adobe released their &quot;Quark Killer&quot;, Adobe InDesign. The last major release of PageMaker came in 2001, and customers were offered InDesign licenses at a lower cost.

== Release history ==

* Aldus Pagemaker 1.0 was released in July 1985 for the Macintosh and in December 1986 for the IBM PC.
* Aldus Pagemaker 1.2 for Macintosh was released in 1986 and added support for PostScript fonts built into LaserWriter Plus or downloaded to the memory of other output devices. PageMaker was awarded a Codie award for &quot;Best New Use of a Computer&quot; in 1986. In October 1986, a version of Pagemaker was made available for Hewlett-Packard&#x27;s HP Vectra computers. In 1987, Pagemaker was available on Digital Equipment&#x27;s VAXstation computers.
* Aldus Pagemaker 2.0 was released in 1987. Until May 1987, the initial Windows release was bundled with a full version of Windows 1.0.3; after that date, a &quot;Windows-runtime&quot; without task-switching capabilities was included. Thus, users who did not have Windows could run the application from MS-DOS.
* Aldus Pagemaker 3.0 for Macintosh was shipped in April 1988. PageMaker 3.0 for the PC was shipped in May 1988 and required Windows 2.0, which was bundled as a run-time version. Version 3.01 was available for OS/2 and took extensive advantage of multithreading for improved user responsiveness.
* Aldus PageMaker 4.0 for Macintosh was released in 1990 and offered new word-processing capabilities, expanded typographic controls, and enhanced features for handling long documents. A version for the PC was available by 1991.
* Aldus PageMaker 5.0 was released in January 1993.
* Adobe PageMaker 6.0 was released in 1995, a year after Adobe Systems acquired Aldus Corporation.
* Adobe PageMaker 6.5 was released in 1996. Support for versions 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, and 6.5 is no longer offered through the official Adobe support system. Due to Aldus&#x27; use of closed, proprietary data formats, this poses substantial problems for users who have works authored in these legacy versions.
* Adobe PageMaker 7.0 was the final version made available. It was released 9 July 2001, though updates have been released for the two supported platforms since. The Macintosh version runs only in Mac OS 9 or earlier; there is no native support for Mac OS X, and it does not run on Intel-based Macs without SheepShaver. It does not run well under Classic, and Adobe recommends that customers use an older Macintosh capable of booting into Mac OS 9. The Windows version supports Windows XP, but according to Adobe, &quot;PageMaker 7.x does not install or run on Windows Vista.&quot;

==End of development==

Development of PageMaker had flagged in the later years at Aldus and, by 1998, PageMaker had lost almost the entire professional market to the comparatively feature-rich QuarkXPress 3.3, released in 1992, and 4.0, released in 1996. Quark stated its intention to buy out Adobe and to divest the combined company of PageMaker to avoid anti-trust issues. Adobe rebuffed the offer and instead continued to work on a new page layout application code-named &quot;Shuksan&quot; (later &quot;K2&quot;), originally started by Aldus, openly planned and positioned as a &quot;Quark killer&quot;. This was released as Adobe InDesign 1.0 in 1999.

The last major release of PageMaker was 7.0 in 2001, after which the product was seen as &quot;languishing on life support&quot;. Adobe ceased all development of PageMaker in 2004 and &quot;strongly encouraged&quot; users to migrate to InDesign, initially through special &quot;InDesign PageMaker Edition&quot; and &quot;PageMaker Plug-in&quot; versions, which added PageMaker&#x27;s data merge, bullet, and numbering features to InDesign, and provided PageMaker-oriented help topics, complimentary Myriad Pro fonts, and templates. From 2005, these features were bundled into InDesign CS2, which was offered at half-price to existing PageMaker customers.

No new major versions of Adobe PageMaker have been released since, and it does not ship alongside Adobe InDesign.

==Reception==
&quot;BYTE&quot; in 1989 listed PageMaker 3.0 as among the &quot;Distinction&quot; winners of the BYTE Awards, stating that it &quot;is the program that showed many of us how to use the Macintosh to its full potential&quot;.

== File formats ==
Adobe PageMaker file formats use various filename extensions, including PMD, PM3, PM4, PM5, PM6 and P65; these should be readable by the applications Collabora Online, LibreOffice or Apache OpenOffice, they can then be saved into the OpenDocument format or other file formats.
