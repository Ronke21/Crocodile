<text>Fugazi (; ) was an American post-hardcore band formed in Washington, D.C., in 1986. The band consisted of guitarists and vocalists Ian MacKaye and Guy Picciotto, bassist Joe Lally, and drummer Brendan Canty. They were noted for their style-transcending music, DIY ethical stance, manner of business practice, and contempt for the music industry.

Fugazi performed numerous worldwide tours and produced six studio albums, a film, and a comprehensive live series, gaining the band critical acclaim and success around the world. Highly influential on punk and alternative music, the band has been on an indefinite hiatus since 2003. Although the band currently has no plans to reunite, all four members remain on good terms and have regularly jammed together in private since going on hiatus.

==History==

===Formation and early years (1986–1989)===
After the hardcore punk group Minor Threat dissolved, MacKaye (vocals and guitar) was active with a few short-lived groups, most notably Embrace. MacKaye realized that he wanted to prioritize making music over being in a band, &quot;because sometimes bands get in the way of music, because you’re so focussed (sic) on making a band that you forget that it should be about music first.&quot; MacKaye had gotten to know Joe Lally, who was working as a roadie for the band Beefeater. After learning Lally played bass, MacKaye asked him if he would be interested in playing together. They soon recruited Dag Nasty drummer Colin Sears, and the trio began practicing around August or September of 1986. MacKaye&#x27;s original concept for Fugazi was akin to &quot;MC5 plus reggae&quot;.

In January 1987, Sears returned to Dag Nasty and was replaced by Brendan Canty, formerly of Rites of Spring. One day, Picciotto, Canty&#x27;s Rites of Spring bandmate, dropped by during a practice session to see how his friend was getting along; he later admitted he secretly harbored the idea of joining the group. But Picciotto was disappointed that there seemed to be no place for him.

After some uncertainty from Canty about what he wanted to do with his future, the trio regrouped and booked their first show at the Wilson Center in early September 1987. The group still needed a name, so MacKaye chose the word &quot;fugazi&quot; from Mark Baker&#x27;s &quot;Nam&quot;, a compilation of stories of Vietnam War veterans, in there being a slang acronym for &quot;Fucked Up, Got Ambushed, Zipped In [a body bag]&quot;.

The band began inviting Picciotto to practices. Inspired by the use of a foil in hip hop, Picciotto sang backup vocals. After his band Happy Go Licky broke up, he became more involved with Fugazi. MacKaye eventually asked Picciotto to become a full member, and he accepted.

===&quot;Fugazi EP&quot; &amp; &quot;Margin Walker&quot; – &quot;13 Songs&quot; (1988–1989)===
Fugazi embarked on its first tour in January 1988. In June 1988 the band recorded its debut EP &quot;Fugazi&quot; with producer Ted Niceley and producer/engineer Don Zientara (who became a longtime collaborator), and shortly afterward embarked on an arduous tour of Europe.

At the tour&#x27;s conclusion in December, the band recorded songs for its intended debut album, but the band was exhausted from touring and found the resulting sessions were unsatisfactory. The track list was cut down to an EP and released as &quot;Margin Walker&quot; the next year. Both EPs were eventually combined into the &quot;13 Songs&quot; release in late 1989. Upon the band&#x27;s return from Europe, Picciotto, unsatisfied with singing, began playing guitar too.

===&quot;Repeater&quot; and &quot;Steady Diet of Nothing&quot; (1990–1992)===

With Picciotto playing guitar full-time, Fugazi made the transition into jamming and writing new material as a band as opposed to performing songs composed solely by MacKaye. In addition to working on new material, songs they had been performing live were refined, such as &quot;Merchandise&quot; and &quot;Turnover&quot;, for inclusion on their first official full-length studio album.

Released on April 19, 1990, through Dischord Records, &quot;Repeater&quot; did not initially reach the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 charts or become a commercial success. But the band spent most of 1990 and 1991 touring heavily behind &quot;Repeater&quot;, performing 250 concerts between March 1990 and June 1991, routinely selling out 1,000-plus capacity venues throughout the world. By summer 1991, the album sold more than 300,000 copies, a large number for a label that relied on minimal promotion. Major labels began to court Fugazi, but the band stayed with Dischord. It was critically well received and featured an alternative rock sound that predated significant releases such as Nirvana&#x27;s &quot;Nevermind&quot; and Pearl Jam&#x27;s &quot;Ten&quot;, which unexpectedly broke the genre into the mainstream.

For Fugazi&#x27;s second studio album, &quot;Steady Diet of Nothing&quot;, released in July 1991, the band again asked Ted Niceley to produce. Niceley had become a chef and had to reluctantly turn down the job, so the band decided to produce the record themselves. After the success of &quot;Repeater&quot; and its subsequent world tour, &quot;Steady Diet&quot; was highly anticipated. Six months before its release Dischord had more than 160,000 pre-orders for the album.

===&quot;In on the Kill Taker&quot; and &quot;Red Medicine&quot; (1993–1996)===
Fugazi recorded its third album, &quot;In on the Kill Taker&quot;, in the fall of 1992 with Steve Albini in Chicago, but the results were deemed unsatisfactory and the band rerecorded the album with Niceley and Don Zientara. With the breakthrough of alternative rock in the early 1990s, &quot;In on the Kill Taker&quot;; released on June 30, 1993, became the group&#x27;s first record to enter the &quot;Billboard&quot; album charts, receiving critical praise from &quot;Spin&quot;, &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, and becoming the band&#x27;s breakthrough album.

By the &quot;In on the Kill Taker&quot; tour, the group began to sell out large auditoriums and arenas and receive more lucrative major label offers. During its sold-out 3-night stint at New York City&#x27;s Roseland Ballroom in September 1993, music mogul and Atlantic Records president Ahmet Ertegun met with the band backstage in an attempt to sign them. Ertegun offered the band &quot;anything you want&quot;, their own subsidiary label and more than $10 million just to sign with Atlantic. Fugazi declined. The organizers of Lollapalooza also attempted to recruit the band for a headlining slot on its 1993 tour, which the band considered but ultimately turned down.
Fugazi began writing the material for &quot;Red Medicine&quot; in late 1994, after touring in support of &quot;In on the Kill Taker&quot;. The band worked with Zientara but chose not to work with Niceley again. Fugazi opted to retreat from the in-your-face production values of &quot;In on the Kill Taker&quot; and instead worked to create an ambient sound that displayed greater range and depth. To achieve this, the band handled production duties itself, and in doing so, became more confident with in-studio experimentation. &quot;Red Medicine&quot; took Fugazi a step further toward art rock. The band began an extensive worldwide tour in support of the album, playing 172 shows between March 1995 and November 1996.

===&quot;End Hits&quot; and &quot;The Argument&quot; (1997–2002)===
After the grueling worldwide tour the band completed in support of &quot;Red Medicine&quot;, Fugazi took an extended break and also began writing material for a follow-up release. By March 1997 Fugazi had once again returned to Inner Ear Studios with Zientara to begin recording what became &quot;End Hits&quot;, with the intention of taking a more relaxed approach to recording and a longer amount of time to experiment with different songs and techniques in the studio. The group ultimately spent seven months recording the album. Due to the title, rumors began circulating at the time that it was to be their last release. 

Released on April 28, 1998, the album was commercially successful and marked one of the band&#x27;s highest debuts yet on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts. Critical reaction to &quot;End Hits&quot; was mixed. Many critics praised its heavier tracks, while others questioned the inclusion of the group&#x27;s longer, more experimental songs. Fugazi elected to bring in their former roadie Jerry Busher as a second drummer in order to replicate the drum overdub-heavy sound of the album live.
Fugazi began work on &quot;The Argument&quot; in 1999. This process saw the group taking more time than usual to write and demo material. Each member brought his own riffs and ideas to the band, jammed on them, and then began piecing the songs together into various configurations before deciding on the final versions. The album&#x27;s recording sessions took place between January and April 2001 at Inner Ear Studios and Dischord House in Arlington, Virginia. The band once again worked with Zientara. During the recording process a considerable amount of time was spent finalizing each song&#x27;s production, in particular the album&#x27;s drum tracks, in an effort to give it a unique feel. Canty told &quot;Modern Drummer&quot;, &quot;We recorded them all very differently in terms of the drum sounds. We used a lot of different drum kits, cymbals, snares, and ways of miking.&quot;

&quot;The Argument&quot; was released by Dischord Records on October 16, 2001, along with the EP Furniture + 2. Arion Berger of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called the album &quot;bracing&quot; and &quot;intellectual&quot; and Chris True of &quot;AllMusic&quot; &quot;spine-tingling and ear-shattering all at once&quot;, writing, &quot;the band has raised the bar for themselves and others once again.&quot; He also wrote that the album had &quot;touched on strange new territory&quot;. By this point Fugazi was on tour less, due in large part to other professional and personal commitments. It performed only 32 shows in 2001 and 2002. Even though the number of performances dwindled, during Fugazi&#x27;s last tour they performed in front of over roughly 70,000 people.

===Indefinite hiatus and reunion rumours (2003–present)===
Fugazi went on what it has called an &quot;indefinite hiatus&quot; after the conclusion of its 2002 UK tour following three sold-out nights at the London Forum on November 2–4, 2002. The hiatus was brought on by the band members&#x27; insistence on spending more time with their families and pursuing other professional projects.

Since Fugazi went on hiatus in 2003, rumors began circulating about a reunion, with some insinuating that the band may get back together to headline the Coachella Festival. While the band has confirmed that it has been offered large sums of money to reunite and headline festivals, such as Coachella, it has so far declined the offers.

In March 2011, MacKaye reiterated that Fugazi has &quot;been offered insane amounts of money to play reunions, but it&#x27;s not going to be money that brings us back together, we would only play music together if we wanted to play music together and time allowed it&quot;.

In November 2011, when asked by &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; about the possibility of a reunion and a follow up to 2001&#x27;s &quot;The Argument&quot;, Lally said, &quot;&quot;The Argument&quot; was a great record that we should try and top. It&#x27;ll take some time to come together and everything. To do that, we&#x27;d have to, the way the four of us are, we would take quite some time, I think, reassociating ourselves musically, and then just letting it come about naturally, because it would have to be a natural thing. So we&#x27;ll just see.&quot;

In August 2014, Dischord announced the official release of &quot;First Demo&quot;, an album featuring 11 demo songs recorded in January 1988. The announcement included a preview of the demo for the Fugazi track &quot;Merchandise&quot;. The album was released on November 18, 2014.

MacKaye insisted in a 2017 interview that Fugazi is not, in fact, broken up. While he admits any future public performance will have to contend with various confounding factors, the members have occasionally played music together, privately, since their 2003 hiatus. On March 21, 2018, in an interview on Vish Khanna&#x27;s Kreative Kontrol podcast, Lally confirmed the band&#x27;s irregular practice of casual get-togethers. He stated: &quot;Yeah, when we&#x27;re all in D.C., we totally hang out together and talk and spend a lot of time laughing. We have a great time together, go out to dinner, and we&#x27;ll play some music together.&quot; Lally also stated that additional public performances or tours were unlikely: &quot;There&#x27;s so much to try to look after to allow Fugazi to do anything, that we do not have the time to give it the respect that it deserves. So unfortunately, it is where it is.&quot;

On February 13, 2019, &quot;Louder Sound&quot; asked Lally and Canty about the possibility of Fugazi returning, Lally responded &quot;You never want to say never about anything, because how can you say that about the future? But there does seem to be a lack of time to allow it to happen, because the four of us would have to spend a lot of time together to figure out, &#x27;Should we play old songs?&#x27; &#x27;Who are we now?&#x27; &#x27;What is it now?&#x27; We are not the kind of band to get together and just rehearse two hours of old songs to go out and play it, rake in the dough and come home.&quot; Canty added, &quot;If we got back together it would have to be from the spirit of creativity. It would be different if we got back together.&quot;

==Side projects and related work==
In the hiatus, the members undertook side projects, with MacKaye forming the duo the Evens with drummer and singer Amy Farina (formerly of the Warmers).

In 2004, MacKaye produced the &quot;DC EP&quot; for Red Hot Chili Peppers guitarist John Frusciante, which also featured Jerry Busher.

Canty has been doing a variety of soundtrack scores and playing bass in the trio Garland Of Hours alongside frequent Fugazi guest contributors Jerry Busher and Amy Domingues, and has played bass live with Mary Timony. Canty also appears on Bob Mould&#x27;s 2005 album &quot;Body of Song&quot; and on Mould&#x27;s 2008 album &quot;District Line&quot;, and has toured with Mould, appearing in the live DVD &quot;Circle of Friends&quot;. He is currently working in the Burn to Shine DVD series which is being released by Trixie DVD. Now, he is playing in Deathfix alongside Devin Ocampo (Medications, Faraquet, Smart Went Crazy, Beauty Pill), Rich Morel (Bob Mould, Blow Off) and Mark Cisneros (Medications, the Make-Up). They will release their album in February 2013 on Dischord Records.

Lally has released three solo albums, &quot;There to Here&quot; (2006), &quot;Nothing Is Underrated&quot; (2007), and &quot;Why Should I Get Used to It&quot; (2011). He has also appeared on fellow DC post-punkers Decahedron&#x27;s debut album &quot;Disconnection_Imminent&quot;, as well as on a project with Red Hot Chili Peppers guitarists John Frusciante and Josh Klinghoffer, known as Ataxia. The group has recorded two albums, &quot;Automatic Writing&quot; (2004) and &quot;AW II&quot; (2007).

Picciotto currently works as a record producer most notably with Blonde Redhead and the Blood Brothers, and he has performed alongside members of the Ex at the Jazz festival in Wels, Austria. Picciotto also contributed guitar on two Vic Chesnutt albums, 2007&#x27;s &quot;North Star Deserter and 2009&#x27;s &quot;At the Cut&quot; (co-producing the latter), for Constellation Records and performed live with Chesnutt and members of Thee Silver Mount Zion Memorial Orchestra and the Quavers in Jem Cohen&#x27;s program entitled, &quot;Evening&#x27;s Civil Twilight in Empires of Tin at the Vienna International Film Festival (Viennale) in 2007 (a DVD of the program was released in 2009). Picciotto played guitar on Chesnutt&#x27;s Fall/Winter 2009 North American Tour. He has a daughter with musician Kathi Wilcox from the band Bikini Kill and the Frumpies.

In July 2011, Minneapolis based record label Doomtree released an album of mash-ups between Fugazi and east coast veteran rap crew the Wu-Tang Clan. The album is titled 13 Chambers, group name Wugazi. However, Fugazi itself did not have any involvement with the release. Bassist Joe Lally was asked about his thoughts on the Wugazi release, and stated &quot;I think they could&#x27;ve found better Fugazi pieces to sample with Wu-Tang guys rapping on it. I mean, it&#x27;s enjoyable, and I do appreciate it for the fact that somebody enjoys our music enough to bring it into that. But, you know, I don&#x27;t know. I guess I should shut up, because I suppose I&#x27;m about to run into these people at the Fun Fun Fun Fest festival and talk to them. But I&#x27;m afraid that is my opinion on it. It&#x27;s like, get better samples of our stuff, do better work.&quot;

In October 2012, Chris Lawhorn released &quot;Fugazi Edits&quot;. The album includes 22 instrumental tracks, which sample 100 songs from Fugazi&#x27;s discography. As in other cases, the band had no involvement in the production. But, the album was authorized for release by MacKaye, with the proceeds going to charity.

In 2016, Canty and Lally joined with guitarist Anthony Pirog to form the Messthetics, Canty and Lally&#x27;s first project together since Fugazi&#x27;s hiatus.
In March 2018, the Messthetics released their self-titled debut album and embarked upon a tour of the US and Japan. The band toured further and released a second album entitled &quot;Anthropocosmic Nest&quot; in 2019.

In 2018, Ian MacKaye, Amy Farina and Joe Lally debuted a new band. In February 2020, it was announced that the band, now called Coriky, would release their first album on March 27, 2020. The debut single, &quot;Clean Kill&quot;, was released on February 11, 2020. The band previewed their album at a free show in D.C.&#x27;s St. Stephen and the Incarnation Episcopal Church on February 22, 2020. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the release of &quot;Coriky&quot; was delayed to June 12, 2020, in part to accommodate independent record stores closed due to the pandemic. Upon release the record was favorable reviewed in a few publications; often drawing comparisons and contrasts with MacKaye and Farina&#x27;s other band the Evens, as well as Fugazi.

==Live performances==
Between 1987 and 2003, Fugazi played over 1,000 concerts in all 50 US states and all over the world. Over 800 of these shows were recorded by the band&#x27;s sound engineers. Beginning in 2004 and continuing into 2005, Fugazi launched a 30 CD Live Series that featured concerts from various points in their career, which were made available for sale via Dischord Records. Continuing with the live series concept and after several years of development on December 1, 2011, Fugazi launched a comprehensive Live Series website through Dischord Records that features 750 recordings available for download at the suggested price of $5 each or a &quot;pay what you want&quot; sliding scale option for each download between $1–100 with the goal of eventually making all 800 of the shows that have been recorded available for purchase. For $500 fans can also purchase an &quot;All Access&quot; privilege which will include access to any future concerts and downloads added to the site.

While each concert was professionally mastered, the recordings capture everything that happened onstage and for preservation&#x27;s sake the band chose not to edit anything out, singer/guitarist Guy Picciotto explained to the &quot;New York Times&quot;, &quot;We liked this idea of, &#x27;Let&#x27;s just let it be everything,&#x27; ... There doesn&#x27;t have to be the idea that this is the great, golden document. It&#x27;s all there, and it&#x27;s not cleaned up. You get what you get.&quot; The sound quality also varies as the earliest recordings were made to cassettes, then eventually digital formats such as DAT, CD-R and ultimately hard-drives were used. Each concert page also includes flyers, photographs and ticket stubs. As a career-spanning archival project, the Fugazi Live Series has few equals, putting the band in the company of acts like the Grateful Dead, Phish and Pearl Jam, three notable examples of other artists with such a large volume of concerts available for purchase.

==Musical style==
Fugazi&#x27;s style has been described as post-hardcore, art punk, alternative rock, and experimental rock. Fugazi&#x27;s music was an intentional departure from that of the hardcore punk bands the members had played in previously. Fugazi combined punk with funk and reggae beats, irregular stop-start song structures, and heavy riffs inspired by popular rock bands such as Led Zeppelin and Queen, bands that the punk community of the time largely disdained. When questioned by &quot;Guitar World&quot; in 2002 about the band&#x27;s influences, singer/guitarist Ian MacKaye responded, &quot;Too many to mention. And not just from the last few years. Some of them predate us by decades, and most of them wouldn&#x27;t be punk. I would hope any musician would be inspired by a lot of different kinds of music.&quot; Fugazi&#x27;s influences include Bad Brains, the Faith, Void, Minutemen, Black Flag, Sonic Youth, the Ex, the Beatles, and the Obsessed.

Picciotto became the group&#x27;s second guitarist when he realized MacKaye&#x27;s typically chunky, low-end riffs and Lally&#x27;s dub-influenced basslines allowed him to focus on high-pitched parts. In both vocal and guitar roles, Picciotto assumed the role of a foil to MacKaye; employing a Rickenbacker guitar for its scratchy single-coil sound in order to &quot;cut through MacKaye&#x27;s chunky chording like a laser beam.&quot; Their inventive, interlocking guitarwork often defies the traditional notion of &quot;lead&quot; and &quot;rhythm&quot; guitars and features unusual and dissonant chords and progressions filtered through a hardcore punk lens. Later, Fugazi more fully integrated elements of punk rock, hardcore, soul and noise with an inventively syncopated rhythm section.

Picciotto&#x27;s assumption of guitar duties allowed all four members of the band to jam together and write songs that way, where previously they had played songs largely as MacKaye had arranged them. When writing songs, the band often rearranges them with different structures and different singers. &quot;Spin&quot; has listed MacKaye and Picciotto together at No. 86 on their list of the 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time for their unique and interlocking guitar style in Fugazi.

Generally, MacKaye&#x27;s lyrics and singing are more direct and anthemic (MacKaye admits that he loves audience sing-alongs and writes songs with shout-able slogans), while Picciotto usually favors a more abstract, oblique approach. Lally has contributed vocals to a few songs as well, in which he sings in a more relaxed, quiet style as opposed to MacKaye and Picciotto, whose lyrics and vocals often feature strong emotional intensity. 

Each of Fugazi&#x27;s albums since &quot;Repeater&quot; have featured an instrumental. By the time of 1995&#x27;s &quot;Red Medicine&quot; bassist Joe Lally also began contributing vocals to the band and the group was implementing many of their broader influences into the overall sound. Critics Ian McCaleb and Ira Robbins declared that Fugazi&#x27;s music combined an &quot;unprecedented dynamic range ... and previously unimagined elements&quot; such as &quot;clattering musique concrète ... piano and sound effects ... murky dub and lancing clarinet&quot; and &quot;loose-limbed jammy funk ... into an ambitious, experimental format that raises more stylistic questions than it answers.&quot;

==Business practices==
Fugazi is well known for their members&#x27; refusal to sign to or work with corporate record labels, instead choosing to release their albums through Dischord. Despite receiving offers from major labels like Atlantic Records, the band were adamant about retaining their independence. MacKaye has stated that &quot;no amount of money is worth losing control of our music.&quot;

On their first tours, Fugazi worked out its DIY ethic by trial and error. Their decisions were partly motivated by pragmatic considerations that were essentially a punk rock version of simple living: for example, selling merchandise on tour would require a full-time merchandise salesperson who would require lodging, food, and other costs, so Fugazi decided to simplify their touring by not selling merchandise. The band was also motivated by moral or ethical considerations: for example, Fugazi&#x27;s members regarded pricey admission for rock concerts as tantamount to price gouging a performer&#x27;s most loyal fans. Fugazi&#x27;s inexpensive target goal of $5 admission was spawned during a conversation on an early tour when the band&#x27;s members were debating the lowest profitable admission price. Everett True has said that MacKaye and Fugazi &quot;had a mind-set that believed that any involvement with the system was corrupting and that you should create completely alternative structures outside&quot;.

In later years, Fugazi was unable to negotiate ticket prices below about $10–$15 total. However, it never saw the $5 rule as inviolable, instead aiming to charge a price that was both affordable and profitable. Unlike some similar, independent rock contemporaries, Fugazi&#x27;s performances and tours were always profitable, due to the group&#x27;s popularity, low business overhead costs, and MacKaye&#x27;s keen sense of audience response in given regions. Many times the band performed sold-out shows multiple consecutive nights at the same venue.

Fugazi&#x27;s early tours earned it a strong word-of-mouth reputation, both for its powerful performances, and also for the band&#x27;s eagerness to play in unusual venues. The group sought out alternatives to traditional rock clubs partly to relieve the boredom of touring, but also hoping to show fans that there are other options to traditional ways of doing things. As Picciotto said, &quot;You find the Elks Lodge, you find the guy who&#x27;s got a space in the back of his pizzeria, you find the guy who has a gallery. Kids will do that stuff because they want to make stuff happen.&quot;

The group, and MacKaye in particular, also made a point of discouraging violent, unwanted slam dancing and fistfights. This was partly because they saw as relics of the early 1980s hardcore punk era, but also due to financial considerations, since moshing often meant costly barricades had to be installed to prevent injuries. MacKaye recounted in an interview, &quot;We played one show to 4000 people one night and the barricade made more money than we did: the barricade cost more than we made. And that’s not even factoring in the 30 security staff you have to hire to man that barricade. It was just psychotic, and it had nothing to do with music: it wasn’t a physical response to music, it was like a behavioural hypnosis caused by television.&quot;

Michael Azerrad quotes Mackaye, &quot;See, [slam dancers] have one form of communication: violence ... So to disorient them, you don&#x27;t give them violence. I&#x27;d say, &#x27;Excuse me, sir ...&#x27;- I mean, it &quot;freaks&quot; them out – &#x27;Excuse me, sir, would you please cut that crap out?&#x27;&quot; Azerrad writes, &quot;[MacKaye&#x27;s] admonitions seemed preachy to some. And by and large, people would obey – it wasn&#x27;t cool to disrespect Ian MacKaye.&quot; Occasionally, Fugazi would have an unrepentant slam-dancer escorted from the concert, and give them an envelope containing a $5 refund (the group kept a stock of such envelopes in their tour van for these occasions).

During the summer of 1990, MacKaye formed the corporation Lunar Atrocities Ltd. in order to shield his own and his bandmates&#x27; personal assets from the threat of lawsuits. As MacKaye&#x27;s financial advisor, Seth Martin, explained to &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in a 1993 interview: &quot;protection from liability is the main reason to form a corporation, and for these guys it makes sense. If someone got hurt stage-diving and decided to sue, it would be harder to go after their personal assets.&quot;

==Influence and legacy==
Fugazi&#x27;s music and ethics have been immensely influential on punk and alternative music throughout the years, and has earned the band praise from many notable musicians as well. Sublime &quot;thanked&quot; the band by namedropping them on their debut album. At the Drive-In called the band an influence on their own music, as did other notable post-hardcore bands such as Refused, Quicksand, Thrice, Thursday, Cursive, Cap&#x27;n Jazz, Braid, and Mclusky. Former At the Drive-In guitarist Jim Ward has also noted Fugazi as a major influence of his during the recording process for his band Sparta&#x27;s first album &quot;Wiretap Scars&quot;. John Frusciante named them an influence on Red Hot Chili Peppers&#x27; &quot;Californication&quot; and on his solo album &quot;The Will to Death&quot;. Nirvana cited the band as an influence, and Kurt Cobain - who was friends with the members of Fugazi - was even spotted in a popular photo of the band with the word &quot;Fugazi&quot; misspelt on both shoes. Eddie Vedder of Pearl Jam remarked that witnessing the band live &quot;was a life-changing experience&quot; for him. Jimmy Eat World have also named Fugazi as an influence, and frontman Jim Adkins has noted that both MacKaye and Picciotto&#x27;s playing styles made him &quot;more open to the ideas behind guitar playing, as opposed to the technical difficulty of it.&quot;. Reportedly a huge fan, Elliott Smith was &quot;super-obsessed&quot; with the band and later admitted that his former band Heatmiser was &quot;trying to be Fugazi&quot;. The Smiths guitarist Johnny Marr offered the band praise, and called MacKaye one of his favorite guitarists. 

Towards the end of his life, Joe Strummer, lead vocalist of the Clash, recognized Fugazi as the band that best exemplified &quot;the spirit of punk&quot; in a 2000 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; interview, besides offering them accolades on several other occasions. In 1993, Joey Ramone of the Ramones picked the band as a favorite, labeling them a &quot;great social conscience&quot;. Graham Coxon of Blur recalls his introduction to bands such as Fugazi (and the Picciotto-led Rites of Spring) in the mid 1990s as being one of the most musically significant moments of his life: &quot;They used the guitar in an incredible way; making quite restrained noisy music, which I&#x27;d never heard English bands doing.&quot; Daniel Kessler of Interpol has also cited the band as an influence on his guitar-playing, as has Colin Frangicetto of Circa Survive, and Gareth Liddiard of the Drones and Tropical Fuck Storm. Tim Commerford of Rage Against the Machine found the band&#x27;s music on &quot;Repeater&quot; revelatory, as did Steve Holmes of American Football. Tom DeLonge of Blink-182 called the band a big influence as they &quot;stood for something and never varied from that path.&quot; &quot;Fugazi was probably my biggest influence as far as wanting to start a band&quot;, Modest Mouse founding member Jeremiah Green admitted, &quot;It was really great music and just sounded like something I could possibly do.&quot; When asked to name some of his favorite records or discographies, Brian Cook of Botch (and later Russian Circles) included the band&#x27;s entire discography amongst others. Gogol Bordello&#x27;s Eugene Hutz called the band&#x27;s debut EP &quot;probably the best I ever heard. It&#x27;s so together and everything sits in the right place.&quot; Jeff Rosenstock not only called the band a big influence on his music, but also on his strict DIY business practices &amp; ethics. Sunny Day Real Estate cited the band as an influence for similar reasons.

In addition, the band has been cited as an influence by Tool bassist Justin Chancellor, Jack White, Sepultura vocalist Derrick Green, Carrie Brownstein of Sleater-Kinney, Chester Bennington of Linkin Park, Dashboard Confessional, the Kills, Face to Face, the Futureheads, the Get Up Kids, ...And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead, Dillinger Escape Plan guitarist Ben Weinman, OK Go frontman Damian Kulash, Rise Against frontman Tim McIlrath, Daniel Johns of Silverchair, Biffy Clyro frontman Simon Neil, Justin Pierre of Motion City Soundtrack, Prong frontman Tommy Victor, Efrim Menuck of Godspeed You! Black Emperor, Dylan Baldi of Cloud Nothings, Arcade Fire lead singer Win Butler, Paul Dempsey of Something for Kate, Travis Morrison of the Dismemberment Plan, Brand New guitarist Jesse Lacey, Converge singer Jacob Bannon, Coalesce, Ben Lee, Patterson Hood of Drive-By Truckers, Pretty Girls Make Graves guitarist J. Clark, Explosions in the Sky, Kele Okereke of Bloc Party, Trevor de Brauw of Pelican, Matty Healy of the 1975, Mary Timony, Hayley Williams of Paramore, Justin Vernon of Bon Iver, Keanu Reeves and Lorde.

<doc id="203165" wikidata="Q705505" url="?curid=203165" title="Iberian grey shrike">
<text>The Iberian grey shrike (Lanius meridionalis) is a member of the shrike family. It is closely related to the great grey shrike, &quot;Lanius excubitor&quot;, and its plumage is generally similar to the great grey shrike apart from the differences noted below. The Iberian was previously considered conspecific with the great grey; where they co-occur, they do not interbreed and are separated by choice of habitat.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
The genus name, &quot;Lanius&quot;, is derived from the Latin word for &quot;butcher&quot;, and some shrikes are also known as &quot;butcher birds&quot; because of their feeding habits. The specific &quot;meridionalis&quot; is Latin for &quot;southern&quot;. The common English name &quot;shrike&quot; is from Old English &quot;scríc&quot;, &quot;shriek&quot;, referring to the shrill call.

It is resident in southern Europe. It is slightly smaller and darker than the great grey shrike, and prefers dry open country.

==Behaviour and ecology==

This medium-sized passerine bird eats large insects, small birds and rodents. Like other shrikes it hunts from prominent perches, and impales corpses on thorns or barbed wire as a &quot;larder&quot;.

==Background==
The EPs compiled were &quot;Fugazi&quot; (1988), which was recorded at Inner Ear Studios in June 1988 with Ted Niceley &amp; Don Zientara, and &quot;Margin Walker&quot; (1989), which was recorded in December 1988 at Southern Studios in London with John Loder handling production duties.

The EPs had been on Ian MacKaye&#x27;s Dischord Records as numbers 30 and 35, respectively. &quot;13 Songs&quot; was number 36. A remastered version was released in February 2003.

==Release==
&quot;13 Songs&quot; is Fugazi&#x27;s most successful release. While certain sources report the album&#x27;s total worldwide sales as being over 3 million, Alan O&#x27;Connor in his 2008 book &quot;Punk Record Labels and the Struggle for Autonomy: The Emergence of DIY&quot; lists the figure as 750,000 (based on an interview with Dischord Records).

==Reception==
The album has gone on to receive critical acclaim, despite being a compilation, with many calling it one of the best albums of the post-hardcore genre. &quot;Stereogum&quot; called it &quot;as auspicious as punk debuts come&quot;, further noting that on the album, &quot;most of the Fugazi elements were in place from the jump, albeit in a somewhat less-developed form. If the concept of a punk band writing a song from the perspective of a woman being hooted at by sexist loudmouths seems revolutionary now, imagine what it sounded like in 1988, when the canon of classic punk still consisted largely of songs dealing with beating on brats, lynching landlords, and the ritual impaling of cats.&quot; In a 5-star review for Allmusic, Andy Kellman called the album &quot;timeless&quot; and wrote that &quot;the importance of this record can perhaps be more suitably measured by the number of people who remember the first time they heard it. 13 Songs is usually among the first records that spring to mind when defining alternative rock. Furious, intelligent, artful, and entirely musical, it&#x27;s a baker&#x27;s dozen of cannon shots to the gut -- not just a batch of emotionally visceral and defiant songs recorded by angry young men, but something greater.&quot; Consequence of Sound called it &quot;a solid classic, instantly grabbing the ear with a timeless quality that you just don’t find every day. [...] I know this music is over 20 years old, but it sounds like it’s pouring out of someone’s garage down the street. You can’t fake this kind of timeless authenticity, though God knows many have tried.&quot; According to Popmatters, the album (along with &quot;Repeater&quot;) &quot;remain the band&#x27;s most widely successful and consistently praised work. &quot;13 Songs&quot;, for instance, has sold over three million copies -- all without radio singles, music videos, or any of the tools of corporate publicity that help musicians reach that stratospheric level of success.&quot;

===Accolades===
In 2005, &quot;13 Songs&quot; was ranked 29 in &quot;Spin&quot;&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Albums, 1985–2005&quot;. &quot;NME&quot; ranked it #284 in their list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot; in 2014. &quot;Paste&quot; ranked it at #57 on their list of &quot;The 80 Best Albums of the 1980s&quot;. In 2016, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked it 35th on their list of the &quot;40 Greatest Punk Albums of All Time&quot;.

==Influence==
According to Kathleen Hanna of Bikini Kill: &quot;&quot;13 Songs&quot; is to underground music what &quot;Led Zeppelin IV&quot; is to suburban potheads.&quot; According to Conrad Keely of ...And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead, the album along with Unwound&#x27;s &quot;Fake Train&quot; &quot;epitomized America&#x27;s disaffected, self-hating white middle-class guilt victims screaming about the fact that they have nothing to do with their time other than be bored, nothing to speak out against other than their own ennui and unwarranted discontent. And although that might sound like a criticism or an indictment, the fact is that this sentiment existed, it was shared by a lot of us, and it found its voice in albums like [&quot;13 Songs&quot;].&quot; &quot;Looking back upon the arc of alternative rock, punk and indie throughout the decade,&quot; writes &quot;Treble&quot;, &quot;from Nirvana to Jawbox, Shudder to Think, Sunny Day Real Estate, Quicksand and The Afghan Whigs, there’s a line that traces back to the jittery funk and searingly melodic hardcore of Fugazi’s first two EPs, which comprise &quot;13 Songs&quot;.&quot; Both Jack Johnson and Eddie Vedder have named &quot;13 Songs&quot; as one of their favorite albums of all time. Rise Against cited the album as one of their 12 key influences, alongside works by Bad Religion, Dead Kennedys and Jawbreaker.

<doc id="203170" wikidata="Q239393" url="?curid=203170" title="Lesser grey shrike">
<text>The lesser grey shrike (Lanius minor) is a member of the shrike family &quot;Laniidae&quot;. It breeds in South and Central Europe and western Asia in the summer and migrates to winter quarters in southern Africa in the early autumn, returning in spring. It is a scarce vagrant to western Europe, including Great Britain, usually as a spring or autumn erratic.

It is similar in appearance to the great grey shrike (&quot;Lanius excubitor&quot;) and the Iberian grey shrike (&quot;Lanius meridionalis&quot;); both sexes are predominantly black, white and grey, and males have pink-flushed underparts. It is slightly smaller than the great grey shrike, and has a black forehead and relatively longer wings. This species prefers dry open lowlands and is often seen on telephone wires.

This medium-sized passerine eats large insects, especially beetles, butterflies, moths and grasshoppers. Lesser grey shrikes frequently hover when hunting on their breeding grounds, but do not do so while moulting on non-breeding grounds. Like other shrikes, it hunts from prominent perches and sometimes impales corpses on thorns or barbed wire as a &quot;larder&quot;.

==Taxonomy==
The lesser grey shrike was formally described in 1788 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin under the binomial name &quot;Lanius minor&quot;. Gmelin based his description on the &quot;Pie-grièche d&#x27;Italie&quot; that had been described in 1770 by French polymath the Comte de Buffon and illustrated with a hand-coloured engraving by François-Nicolas Martinet. The genus name, &quot;Lanius&quot;, is derived from the Latin word for &quot;butcher&quot;, and some shrikes are also known as &quot;butcher birds&quot; because of their feeding habits. The specific &quot;minor&quot; is Latin for &quot;smaller&quot;. The common English name &quot;shrike&quot; is from Old English &quot;scríc&quot;, &quot;shriek&quot;, referring to the shrill call. The species is considered to be monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.

A molecular phylogenetic study published in 2019 found that within the genus &quot;Lanius&quot; the lesser grey shrike was sister to the woodchat shrike (&quot;Lanius senator&quot;), a migratory species that breeds in southern Europe, the Middle East and northwest Africa. The two species diverged from each other around 3.9–5.0 million years ago.

==Description==
The adult male lesser grey shrike has its nape, cheeks, ear and eye coverts and front part of the crown black. The hind part of the crown and the back is a pale bluish-grey and the rump is a similar but rather paler colour. The underparts are white with the lower breast and belly suffused with pink. The axillaries are greyish-white and the underwing coverts are brownish-black. The two central tail feathers are black with a white tip and base. The other pairs have increasing areas of white and less black. The primaries are black with a buff tip and white base. The secondaries are black with broader, paler tips but no white bases. The wing coverts are black with the lesser coverts being fringed with grey. The female has similar plumage but the head is dark grey rather than black, the ear coverts brownish-black, the upperparts a brownish-grey and the underparts less pink than the male. The juvenile is similar to the adults but is altogether more brown. It lacks the grey back and rump which are instead pale brown and faintly barred, and the underparts are white and cream without any pink. All birds have a brownish-black beak with a paler base to the lower mandible, brown irises and black legs and feet. Adult length is around with a wing length of and a tarsus length of .

==Distribution and habitat==
The lesser grey shrike spends the summer in South and Central Europe and western Asia. It breeds in southern France, Switzerland, Austria, Hungary, Slovakia, Czech Republic, Italy, the former Yugoslavia, Albania, Greece, Romania, Bulgaria, Ukraine and southern Russia. In Asia it breeds in the Middle East, its range extending as far as eastern Turkey and Iran. It is a vagrant to more northerly parts of Europe, usually in spring or autumn. Countries where it has been seen include Sweden, Finland, Denmark, United Kingdom, Netherlands, Belgium and northern France. It is a migratory species and winters in a broad belt across tropical southern Africa.

During the summer the lesser grey shrike inhabits open countryside, the edges of cultivated areas, heathland with scattered bushes and trees, gardens, coppices, woodland and roadside trees. In its winter quarters it is usually found in scrubland and among thorn trees.

==Behaviour==

The lesser grey shrike hunts from a strategic post, wire or branch and primarily feeds on insects which it catches in the air or on the ground. The diet includes beetles, moths and butterflies, large flies, grasshoppers, crickets and millipedes. Some fruits such as cherries and figs are eaten to a limited extent. The bird occasionally impales freshly caught prey on thorns for use later, but this is done to a much lesser extent than by some other shrike species. It has been shown experimentally that this species only creates a larder when it is satiated and that prey items are seldom plentiful enough for this to be the case. The male has been observed to feed the female before starting to create a food store. Repeated experimental exposure of birds to a food surplus significantly increases the rate at which they impale freshly caught prey. Other causal factors in the failure of this species to hoard may be a shortage of suitable caching sites and the fact that the bird lacks practice in storing food and this constrains its learning ability.

The flight of the lesser grey shrike is low and somewhat undulating and it occasionally glides with extended wings. At the end of the flight it swoops upward to land on a new hunting perch. It then turns its head from side to side searching for prey. When on the ground it hops, but it normally only stays there for long enough to pick up an item of food. Like other shrikes, when excited it fans its tail and moves it up and down or from sided to side. It is pugnacious and will defend its nest with vigour and drive away larger birds.

==Breeding==

The nest is often built in a roadside tree with good all-round visibility some off the ground. It is built by both birds out of the stems of various flowering plants such as cudweed (&quot;Gnaphalium&quot;) and (&quot;Filago&quot;), and thyme (&quot;Thymus&quot;), and lined with whisps of wool, hairs, roots and feathers. There are five to seven eggs in the clutch, usually bluish green blotched with greenish-brown. Sometimes the background colour is cream or buff with pinkish-brown blotches. Their average size is . Incubation lasts about fifteen days and is chiefly done by the female though both parents take part. They both feed the young which are ready to leave the nest after about fourteen days. There is usually a single brood.

==Status==
The lesser grey shrike has a world population estimated as being between two and a half and nine million individuals. These are spread out over a wide range and the IUCN, in its Red List of Threatened Species, lists the bird as being of &quot;Least Concern&quot;. Though the number of birds may be decreasing slightly, this is not thought to be sufficient to raise the species to the more threatened &quot;Vulnerable&quot; category.

In Europe the numbers of lesser grey shrikes has been dwindling and there are now thought to be three to five thousand breeding pairs. The diminution in numbers may be due to a series of wet summers leading to a dearth of insects. Another factor may be changes in agricultural practices with small enclosures with varying crops and patches of woodland being replaced by large fields. As a result, this bird has been listed as a threatened species in Annex I of the European Commission Birds Directive.

<text>Gerhardodon is an extinct genus of mammal from the Lower Cretaceous of southern England. It was a member of the also extinct order of Multituberculata, and lived with such dinosaurs as &quot;Iguanodon&quot;. It lies within the suborder &quot;Plagiaulacida&quot; and family Pinheirodontidae.

The genus &quot;Gerhardodon&quot; (&quot;Gerhard’s tooth&quot;) was named by Kielan-Jaworowska Z. and Ensom P.C. in 1992 based on a single species, &quot;Gerhardodon purbeckensis&quot;. It is known from the Berriasian (Lower Cretaceous) strata of Durlston Bay in Dorset, England. It is a multituberculate mammal from the Isle of Purbeck, Dorset. This formation is sometimes considered to be partly Upper Jurassic.

<text>In physics, engineering, and physical chemistry, a perfect gas is a theoretical gas model that differs from real gases in specific ways that makes certain calculations easier to handle. In all perfect gas models, intermolecular forces are neglected. This means that one can neglect many complications that may arise from the Van der Waals forces. All perfect gas models are ideal gas models in the sense that they all follow the ideal gas equation of state. However, the idea of a perfect gas model is often invoked as a combination of the ideal gas equation of state with specific additional assumptions regarding the variation (or nonvariation) of the heat capacity with temperature.

== Perfect gas nomenclature ==
The terms &quot;perfect gas&quot; and &quot;ideal gas&quot; are sometimes used interchangeably, depending on the particular field of physics and engineering. Sometimes, other distinctions are made, such as between &quot;thermally perfect gas&quot; and &quot;calorically perfect gas&quot;, or between imperfect, semi-perfect, and perfect gases, and as well as the characteristics of ideal gases. Two of the common sets of nomenclatures are summarized in the following table.

=== Thermally and calorically perfect gas ===
Along with the definition of a perfect gas, there are also two more simplifications that can be made although various textbooks either omit or combine the following simplifications into a general &quot;perfect gas&quot; definition.

For a fixed number of moles of gas formula_1, a thermally perfect gas
* is in thermodynamic equilibrium
* is not chemically reacting
* has internal energy formula_2, enthalpy formula_3, and constant volume / constant pressure heat capacities formula_4, formula_5 that are solely functions of temperature and not of pressure formula_6 or volume formula_7, i.e., formula_8, formula_9, formula_10, formula_11. These latter expressions hold for all tiny property changes and are not restricted to constant-formula_7 or constant-formula_6 variations.

A calorically perfect gas
* is in thermodynamic equilibrium
* is not chemically reacting
* has internal energy formula_2, and enthalpy formula_3 that are functions of temperature only, i.e., formula_8, formula_9
* has heat capacities formula_4, formula_5&quot; that are constant,&quot; i.e., formula_20, formula_21 and formula_22, formula_23, where formula_24 is any finite (non-differential) change in each quantity.

It can be easily shown that an ideal gas (i.e. satisfying the ideal gas equation of state, formula_25) is either calorically perfect or thermally perfect. This is because the internal energy of an ideal gas is at most a function of temperature, as shown by the thermodynamic equation
formula_26
which is exactly zero when formula_27. Since formula_2 is independent of volume, it must be true that for fixed formula_1, formula_2 and formula_31 are at most functions of only temperature for the ideal gas equation of state. This is also true for the two heat capacities, which are temperature derivatives of formula_2 and formula_3.

From both statistical mechanics and the simpler kinetic theory of gases, we expect the heat capacity of a monatomic ideal gas to be constant, since for such a gas only kinetic energy contributes to the internal energy and to within an arbitrary additive constant formula_34, and therefore formula_35, a constant. Moreover, the classical equipartition theorem predicts that all ideal gases (even polyatomic) have constant heat capacities at all temperatures. However, it is now known from the modern theory of quantum statistical mechanics as well as from experimental data that a polyatomic ideal gas will generally have thermal contributions to its internal energy which are not linear functions of temperature. These contributions are due to contributions from the vibrational, rotational, and electronic degrees of freedom as they become populated as a function of temperature according to the Boltzmann distribution. In this situation we find that formula_36 and formula_37. But even if the heat capacity is strictly a function of temperature for a given gas, it might be assumed constant for purposes of calculation if the temperature and heat capacity variations are not too large, which would lead to the assumption of a calorically perfect gas (see below).
These types of approximations are useful for modeling, for example, an axial compressor where temperature fluctuations are usually not large enough to cause any significant deviations from the &quot;thermally perfect&quot; gas model. In this model the heat capacity is still allowed to vary, though only with temperature, and molecules are not permitted to dissociate. The latter generally implies that the temperature should be limited to &lt; 2500 K. This temperature limit depends on the chemical composition of the gas and how accurate the calculations need to be, since molecular dissociation may be important at a higher or lower temperature which is intrinsically dependent on the molecular nature of the gas. 

Even more restricted is the &quot;calorically perfect gas&quot; for which, in addition, the heat capacity is assumed to be constant. Although this may be the most restrictive model from a temperature perspective, it may be accurate enough to make reasonable predictions within the limits specified. For example, a comparison of calculations for one compression stage of an axial compressor (one with variable formula_5 and one with constant formula_5) may produce a deviation small enough to support this approach. 

In addition, other factors come into play and dominate during a compression cycle if they have a greater impact on the final calculated result than whether or not formula_5 was held constant. When modeling an axial compressor, examples of these real-world effects include compressor tip-clearance, separation, and boundary layer/frictional losses.

<text>Benoît Paul Émile Clapeyron (; 26 January 1799 – 28 January 1864) was a French engineer and physicist, one of the founders of thermodynamics.

==Life==
Born in Paris, Clapeyron studied at the École polytechnique, graduating in 1818. He also studied at École des mines. In 1820 he and Gabriel Lamé went to Saint Petersburg to teach and work at the school of public works there. He returned to Paris only after the Revolution of July 1830, supervising the construction of the first railway lines connecting Paris to Versailles and Paris to Saint-Germain.
The half brothers Stéphane Mony and Eugène Flachat collaborated in this project, which was financed by Adolphe d&#x27;Eichthal(fr), Rothschild, Auguste Thurneyssen, Sanson Davillier and the Péreire brothers.
Clapeyron took his steam engine designs to England in 1836 to find a manufacturer and engaged Sharp, Roberts and Co.

From 1844 to 1859 Clapeyron was a professor at École des Ponts et Chaussées.

Clapeyron married Mélanie Bazaine, daughter of Pierre-Dominique Bazaine (mathematician and ingénieur des ponts), and older sister of Pierre-Dominique (Adolphe) Bazaine (railway engineer) and François Achille Bazaine (Marshal of France).

==Work==
In 1834, he made his first contribution to the creation of modern thermodynamics by publishing a report entitled &quot;Mémoire sur la puissance motrice de la chaleur&quot; (&quot;Memoir on the Motive Power of Heat&quot;), in which he developed the work of the physicist Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot, deceased two years before. Though Carnot had developed a compelling analysis of a generalised heat engine, he had employed the clumsy and already unfashionable caloric theory.

Clapeyron, in his memoire, presented Carnot&#x27;s work in a more accessible and analytic graphical form, showing the Carnot cycle as a closed curve on an indicator diagram, a chart of pressure against volume (named in his honor Clapeyron&#x27;s graph). Clapeyron&#x27;s analysis of Carnot was more broadly disseminated in 1843 when Johann Poggendorff translated it into German.

In 1842 Clapeyron published his findings on the &quot;optimal position for the piston at which the various valves should be opened or closed.&quot; In 1843, Clapeyron further developed the idea of a reversible process, already suggested by Carnot and made a definitive statement of &quot;Carnot&#x27;s principle&quot;, what is now known as the second law of thermodynamics.

These foundations enabled him to make substantive extensions of Clausius&#x27; work, including the formula, now known as the Clausius–Clapeyron relation, which characterises the phase transition between two phases of matter. He further considered questions of phase transitions in what later became known as Stefan problems.

Clapeyron also worked on the characterisation of perfect gases, the of homogeneous solids, and calculations of the statics of continuous beams, notably the theorem of three moments (Clapeyron&#x27;s theorem).

==Honors==
*Member of the Académie des Sciences, (1858).
*The Rue Clapeyron in Paris&#x27; 8th arrondissement (here) is named for him.
*His name is one of the 72 names inscribed on the Eiffel Tower.

<doc id="203176" wikidata="Q193873" url="?curid=203176" title="Oben am jungen Rhein">
<text>&quot;&quot; is the national anthem of Liechtenstein. Written in the 1850s, it is set to the melody of the British anthem, &quot;God Save the King&quot;, which in the 19th century had been used for a number of anthems of German-speaking nations, including those of Prussia, Bavaria, Saxony, and Switzerland.

==History==
The original lyrics, beginning &quot;Oberst am jungen Rhein&quot;, were written in the 1850s. The song may be grouped with the German &quot;Rhine songs&quot;, i.e. songs that celebrate the River Rhine as part of the German national patrimony, opposing the French territorial claims on the left river bank.

The text is attributed to Jakob Josef Jauch (1802–1859). Born in Saratov, Russia to Swiss Catholic family from Uri, Jauch studied theology in Lucerne and Chur during 1828–1832, and was consecrated as priest in 1833. He served as priest in London during 1837/8–1850. During 1852–1856, he lived in Balzers, Liechtenstein, and befriended Princess Franziska, with whom he planned a model educational institution in Balzers. Due to his progressive stance, Jauch came into conflict with the church hierarchy, and the bishop of Chur ordered him to leave Liechtenstein in 1856. If the attribution of the lyrics to Jauch is correct, the composition would likely date to Jauch&#x27;s time in Balzers (1852–1856).

The lyrics were not published during Jauch&#x27;s lifetime. They appeared in print, as the national anthem of Liechtenstein (&quot;Die Liechtenstein&#x27;sche National-Hymne&quot;) only after a period of oral transmission, in 1875, so that the tradition of Jauch&#x27;s authorship, or the original form of his lyrics, cannot be verified. The song served as Liechtenstein&#x27;s unofficial, &quot;de facto&quot; national anthem from the 1870s until its official adoption in 1920.

In 1963, the text was shortened, and reference to the &quot;German Rhine&quot;, which had been introduced in the 1920 version, was removed. &quot;Oben am jungen Rhein&quot; is the only remaining national anthem sharing the same melody with the British &quot;God Save the King&quot; (since the replacement of the Swiss &quot;Rufst du, mein Vaterland&quot; in 1961).

==Lyrics==
Usually, only the first and last stanzas are sung.

<text>Orbital are an English electronic music duo from Dunton Green, Kent, England, consisting of brothers Phil and Paul Hartnoll. The band&#x27;s name is taken from Greater London&#x27;s orbital motorway, the M25, which was central to the early rave scene during the early days of acid house. Additionally, the cover art on three of their albums showcase stylised atomic orbitals. Orbital have been critically and commercially successful, known particularly for their live improvisation during shows.

==Career==
===Early years and influences===

Paul Hartnoll described the early incarnation of Orbital as a &quot;low-cost bedroom New Order/Severed Heads&quot;. Other influences from the late 1970s and early 1980s included The Beat, Cabaret Voltaire, OMD and Kate Bush. The catalogues of Tamla Motown, ZTT and Trojan Records, and the classic rock of bands like Deep Purple, Led Zeppelin and Genesis, were also influential. The Hartnolls have expressed a deep appreciation of Kraftwerk.

In 1989, Orbital recorded &quot;Chime&quot; on their father&#x27;s 4 track tape deck, which they released on DJ Jazzy M&#x27;s Oh Zone Records in December 1989 and re-released on FFRR Records a few months later. The track became a rave anthem, reaching number 17 in the UK charts and earning them an appearance on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, during which they wore anti-Poll Tax T-shirts. According to Paul Hartnoll, the track was recorded &quot;under the stairs&quot; of their parents&#x27; house in &quot;a knocked-through stair cupboard that my dad set up as a home office&quot;. The track received its first live airing at a club night hosted by the promoter Que Pasa (Mark, Andrew and Nick Maddox) in a local Sevenoaks venue called the Grasshopper on Boxing Day. Next was a gig at the Town and Country 2 in Islington, performing for the first time under the name Orbital. Several singles and EPs followed, and their first self-titled album, a collection of tracks recorded at various times, was released in late 1991.

In late 1992, the &quot;Radiccio&quot; EP barely reached the UK top 40, although it included one of their most popular songs, &quot;Halcyon&quot;. The track featured a sample of Kirsty Hawkshaw from &quot;It&#x27;s a Fine Day&quot; (a chart hit for Opus III earlier that year). The B-side &quot;The Naked and the Dead&quot; was similarly based on a line from Scott Walker&#x27;s rendition of Jacques Brel&#x27;s song &quot;Next&quot;. &quot;Halcyon&quot; was dedicated to the Hartnolls&#x27; mother, who was addicted to the tranquiliser Halcion (Triazolam) for many years.

The duo&#x27;s popularity grew rapidly with the release of their second self-titled album, in 1993. The album included complex arrangements and textures, opening with the two-minute track &quot;Time Becomes&quot;. The track consisted of two slightly delayed, looped samples of a line from the &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; episode &quot;Time Squared&quot; spoken by actor Michael Dorn as the character Lieutenant Worf: &quot;... where time becomes a loop&quot; being played simultaneously through the left and right channels, respectively (until one cycle of phase difference has happened). The same sample was used at the beginning of &quot;the Moebius&quot;, the opening track in the previous album. This audio pun was intended to make listeners believe that they had bought a mis-pressed album (&quot;Orbital 1&quot; packaged as &quot;Orbital 2&quot;). The album reached #28 on the UK album charts, staying in the chart for 15 weeks. &quot;Halcyon&quot; was remixed for the album, as &quot;Halcyon + On + On&quot;. Versions of this song played live by the band have incorporated diverse samples, including &quot;You Give Love a Bad Name&quot; by the band Bon Jovi, &quot;Heaven Is a Place on Earth&quot; by Belinda Carlisle, and in 2004 &quot;I Believe in a Thing Called Love&quot; by the band The Darkness.

The first two albums are commonly known as &quot;The Green Album&quot; and &quot;The Brown Album&quot;, after the colours of their covers (although the first album&#x27;s cover is yellow, one of the first printings had a misprint causing the cover to be yellow-green).

===1994 breakthrough===
Orbital won an &quot;NME&quot; award for Vibes Best Dance Act early in 1994, but it was their headline appearance at the Glastonbury Festival on 25 June 1994 that brought them most attention. &quot;Q&quot; magazine classed it as one of the top 50 gigs of all time, and in 2002 included Orbital in their list of &quot;50 Bands to See Before You Die&quot;.

Crucially, the expanded TV coverage of the 1994 Glastonbury Festival by Channel 4 meant that Orbital&#x27;s set reached a huge audience, in what is regarded as a pivotal moment. Speaking to The Guardian in 2013 about the gig, Paul Hartnoll commented: &quot;I didn&#x27;t know how much of an impact it would have. Being young myself, I just thought, &#x27;It&#x27;s about time – of course we should have acid house at Glastonbury&#x27;. It used to annoy me. I just used to think it should be happening.&quot;

Orbital gave an improvisational element to live electronic music as the brothers mixed and sequenced their tracks on the fly, wearing their trademark head-mounted torches behind banks of equipment. Orbital were one of the few electronic acts invited to play at Woodstock &#x27;94.

The third album, &quot;Snivilisation&quot;, was released in August 1994. Alison Goldfrapp provided vocals on a couple of the tracks, including the single &quot;Are We Here?&quot;. This track also included a sample from &quot;Man at C&amp;A&quot; by The Specials. Among the remixes of &quot;Are We Here?&quot; was &quot;Criminal Justice Bill?&quot; – four minutes of silence, a reference to the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, which was in part intended to clamp down on the rave scene which had given birth to Orbital. The other track with Goldfrapp vocals, &quot;Sad But True&quot;, was remixed for the &quot;Times Fly&quot; EP, the band&#x27;s only release in 1995.

The single &quot;The Box&quot; was released in April 1996, reaching number 11 in the UK, and its parent album &quot;In Sides&quot;, released in May 1996, became their second Top Five album. &quot;In Sides&quot; has since come to be one of their most critically well-regarded works. As with the previous album, there was a vague theme of ecological disaster and dissatisfaction with society.

The following year, the duo contributed to film soundtracks (&quot;The Saint&quot;, &quot;Event Horizon&quot;, &quot;Spawn&quot;) and enjoyed the biggest singles of their career, with a live version of &quot;Satan&quot; and their reworking of the aforementioned &quot;The Saint&quot; theme both reaching number three in the UK. The &quot;In Sides&quot; track &quot;Out There Somewhere (Part 2)&quot; was also included in the long-awaited game series relaunch of &quot;Test Drive 4&quot;.

Orbital would go on to aid the &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; film soundtrack in reaching Platinum selling status during 1995, with a remix of &quot;Halcyon&quot;, which can be heard during the final scene of the film.

===Later albums===
In 1998, they returned to the studio to work on their fifth album &quot;The Middle of Nowhere&quot;. This was released in 1999, becoming their third top five album, and was a return to a more upbeat style; with Alison Goldfrapp returning on vocals and the single &quot;Style&quot; using the stylophone. In 2000 the single &quot;Beached&quot; was released from the soundtrack to the film &quot;The Beach&quot;, mixing the brothers&#x27; musical style with a melody by Angelo Badalamenti and the words of Leonardo DiCaprio from the film.

&quot;The Altogether&quot;, released in 2001, included guest vocals by the Hartnolls&#x27; brother-in-law David Gray, a sampled Ian Dury, and a version of the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; theme, and was mixed for 5.1 surround sound. It was to be their last album for FFRR, and had a mixed critical reception. The following year, &quot;Work 1989-2002&quot; collected various singles from &quot;Chime&quot; onwards. Orbital recorded the track &quot;Technologique Park&quot; for the 2002 film &quot;XXX&quot;, in which they can be seen playing the track live in a club.

In 2003, Orbital recorded the soundtrack for the horror film &quot;Octane&quot;.

Orbital split up in 2004. They played a final series of gigs in June and July 2004 at the Glastonbury Festival, the T in the Park Festival in Scotland, the Oxegen festival in Ireland, Istanbul, Turkey and the in Japan, concluding with a live Peel Session gig at Maida Vale Studios in London on 28 July 2004. The release of their seventh and last original album, &quot;Blue Album&quot;, coincided with this final wave of shows. The album included Sparks (on &quot;Acid Pants&quot;) and Lisa Gerrard (on the final single, &quot;One Perfect Sunrise&quot;).

===Following the breakup===
Paul Hartnoll continued to record music under his own name, including tracks for the 2005 game &quot;Wipeout Pure&quot; for the &quot;PSP&quot;. He released his first solo album, &quot;The Ideal Condition&quot;, on the ACP record label in June 2007. Alongside Flood, he also jointly produced &quot;Strength in Numbers&quot; by band The Music.

Phil Hartnoll formed a new electronica duo, Long Range, with Nick Smith. Their debut album, &quot;Madness and Me&quot;, was released on their own label, Long Range Recordings, in August 2007. 
Orbital released a two-CD/DVD compilation &quot;&quot; in June 2007, containing over two hours of music recorded at their various performances at the festival.

===Comeback and &quot;Wonky&quot;===
On 21 November 2008, Orbital announced they would be reforming to play a gig together called &quot;20 years after Chime&quot; at The Big Chill Festival 2009. They preceded this show with a headline performance at RockNess 2009 in June.
On 26 January 2009, their official website &quot;Loopz&quot; announced confirmed dates for their 20th anniversary tour. &quot;The Orbital reformation gathers momentum with headline shows now confirmed for Manchester and London this September.&quot; The concerts met with positive reviews. The band&#x27;s first performance after the breakup took place in June 2009 at Selector Festival in Cracow, Poland. On 17 April 2009, it was announced that Orbital would be playing at The Electric Picnic in September 2009.

On 16 June 2009, Orbital released a 2-CD collection of their favourite tracks. The collection, &quot;Orbital 20&quot; (stylised as &quot;20rbital&quot;), covered the 20 years since &quot;Chime&quot; and contained 20 tracks. A single, &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop Me&quot; / &quot;The Gun is Good&quot; was issued in 2010 on 12&quot; and digital download. At the Glastonbury Festival on 27 June 2010 to close their set, Matt Smith, who played the Eleventh Doctor, came on stage and performed with Orbital their cover of the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; theme tune.

On 16 February 2011, Orbital posted a video diary on YouTube, via Loopz. The video diary reported their progress on the recording of their new album, along with remixes of existing material for their DJ sets. Subsequent diary updates have been published. In October 2011, Orbital announced a six gig UK tour (including a date at the Royal Albert Hall) and new album in April 2012. &quot;Never&quot;, a track from the forthcoming album, was offered as a free download. The album titled &quot;Wonky&quot; was released on 2 April 2012, and included collaborations with singer Zola Jesus and MC Lady Leshurr. The albums release was featured on US radio on PrototypeRadio, which also marked the bands debut radio appearance on American radio.

Orbital appeared at the opening ceremony for the London 2012 Paralympic Games, performing &quot;Where Is It Going?&quot; live with Stephen Hawking delivering a speech about the Large Hadron Collider.

On 8 October 2012, Orbital released their soundtrack to the 2012 re-make of &quot;Pusher&quot;, including vocals from Toni Halliday.

===Second breakup===
On 21 October 2014, Orbital announced on their official website that they were &quot;hanging up their iconic torch-glasses and parting ways for the final time&quot; but would continue to work on projects separately. Phil Hartnoll focused on a DJ career, including a performance at Fuji Rock Festival, while Paul Hartnoll worked on a variety of music projects, including a solo album under the name 8:58 in 2015, a collaboration with Vince Clarke of Erasure called 2Square, and soundtrack work for &quot;Peaky Blinders&quot; and &quot;American Ultra&quot;.

===2017 reunion and &quot;Monsters Exist&quot;===
In February 2017, Orbital reunited and announced tour dates in June and July, at Forbidden Fruit in Dublin, Bluedot Festival at Jodrell Bank and Standon Calling in Hertfordshire, and announced that they were working on a new album, releasing &quot;Kinetic 2017&quot;, an updated remix of an early single, alongside the announcement. At the Bluedot Festival in July, the BBC Radiophonic Workshop joined Orbital on stage to perform &quot;Doctor?&quot; live, and in August 2017 the band released non-album single &quot;Copenhagen&quot; after working on the song during their summer live sets.

In December 2017, Orbital played two sell out shows over two nights at the Manchester O2 Apollo and the London Eventim Apollo. The sets included two previously unheard songs, &quot;Phuk&quot; (stylised &quot;P.H.U.K.&quot;) and &quot;Tiny Foldable Cities&quot;. These two shows were released on CD through Pledge Music. A third previously unheard song, &quot;The End is Nigh&quot;, was debuted May 2018 at the Biggest Weekend festival in Belfast.

A new album, entitled &quot;Monsters Exist&quot;, was released on 14 September 2018. It was the first Orbital album since &quot;In Sides&quot; to feature artwork by John Greenwood, and featured physicist Brian Cox on its final track.

In 2019, Orbital revealed plans for a 30th anniversary album, which would feature a compilation of updated versions of their songs created by themselves and their contemporaries. In early 2020, Orbital began performing two new songs tentatively titled &quot;One Day&quot; and &quot;Treadmill&quot; at live shows, including a live streamed &quot;Stay-At-Home-Rave&quot; hosted by United We Stream and The Haçienda, benefiting those impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in Greater Manchester.

In 2022, the duo composed and recorded the soundtrack for the Netflix comedy series &quot;The Pentaverate&quot; created by Mike Myers. On 20 October, they announced their tenth studio album titled &quot;Optical Delusion&quot;, which was released on 17 February 2023, along with a lead single titled &quot;Dirty Rat&quot;, featuring Sleaford Mods.

In June 2024, their performance at the Glastonbury Festival featured special guests Tilda Swinton (vocals on Deeper) and Mel C (vocals on Spicy).

In October 2024, they announced the release of a career-spanning compilation &quot;A Beginner&#x27;s Guide&quot; on 8 November 2024.

==Political commentary==
Throughout their career, Orbital have sometimes incorporated political and environmental commentary into their music. Early single Choice samples a speech against militarization from Crucifix&#x27;s &quot;Annihilation&quot;. The track &quot;Forever&quot; on &quot;Snivilisation&quot; samples a speech by Graham Crowden from the 1982 Lindsay Anderson film &quot;Britannia Hospital&quot;, in which he lambasts humankind; and &quot;You Lot&quot; on the &quot;Blue Album&quot; included a confrontational, partially vocoded sample of Christopher Eccleston playing the second coming of Jesus Christ in the TV two-part series &quot;The Second Coming&quot; written by Russell T Davies.

Although only the phrase &quot;New Age Travellers&quot; from John Major&#x27;s 1992 Conservative Party conference speech is retained in the 1995 single release of &quot;Sad But New&quot;, Orbital first unveiled the track including a fuller version of the speech in March 1995 as part of a live broadcast on BBC Radio 1 &quot;Interactive Radio Night&quot;, and as a response to the newly passed Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994. 

The track &quot;The Girl with the Sun in Her Head&quot; from &quot;In Sides&quot; was recorded in a studio powered only by Greenpeace&#x27;s mobile solar power generator, &quot;CYRUS&quot;. On the same album, &quot;Dŵr Budr&quot;, Welsh for &quot;dirty water&quot;, was inspired by the Sea Empress oil spill which took place just off the southern coast of Wales in February 1996. The album as whole is a concept album on that theme, for example the track &quot;P.E.T.R.O.L&quot;.

The video for 2018 single &quot;P.H.U.K&quot; (off &quot;Monsters Exist&quot;) features photography taken from British news services, with loose references to Brexit, the London fatberg, the Grenfell Tower fire, moped crime, and the 2010s migrant crisis, among other current events, and the title &quot;Please Help United Kingdom&quot; reappearing. Although not strictly political, the track &quot;There Will Come a Time&quot; (also featured on &quot;Monsters Exist&quot;) includes a spoken passage by the physicist Brian Cox, where he addresses the future of an expanding universe and the inevitable demise of the Earth, and urges mankind to care for the planet and maintain a peaceful existence while the Earth is still our home.

Starting in 2019, live performances of the track &quot;Impact (The Earth Is Burning)&quot; have included a sampled speech from Swedish environmental activist Greta Thunberg, declaring &quot;Our house is on fire. I don&#x27;t want you to be hopeful. I want you to panic.&quot;

Paul Hartnoll described his intentions behind Orbital&#x27;s sociopolitical messages as &quot;quite ambiguous. Rather than making social comments, I suppose what we&#x27;re doing is trying to put a score to the times we live in. I&#x27;d like to think that some of these are universal issues – the earth is still burning, even today, the world isn&#x27;t fixed, and governments are still fucking idiots. I&#x27;m not saying I could do any better, but they could. With our music, we&#x27;re saying &#x27;go on then, sort it out!&#x27;&quot;

<text>Groß-Gerau is a Kreis (district) in the south of Hesse (&quot;Hessen&quot; in German), Germany. Neighboring districts are Main-Taunus, district-free Frankfurt, Darmstadt-Dieburg, Bergstraße, Alzey-Worms, Mainz-Bingen, and the district-free cities Mainz and Wiesbaden.

== History ==
The historic roots of the district is the &quot;Gerauer Mark&quot;, which was first mentioned in 910. Starting in 1066 the counts of Katzenelnbogen became the rulers of the area, until in 1479 it came to Hesse.

The district was formed in 1832. The eastern part was moved to the Darmstadt-Dieburg district in 1874, and Gernsheim was included, which gave the district its current size.

== Partnerships ==
In 1979, the district started a partnership with the Cheshire county (UK). Other partnerships are with the district Weimarer Land in Thuringia, Germany, the municipality Masatepe in Nicaragua, and the Polish district Klodzko.

== Geography ==
The district is located in the upper Rhine valley. The river Main forms the northern boundary of the district, the river Rhine the western border. In the east the Odenwald mountains rise at the district boundary.

The highest elevation of the district is 145 m above sea level, located near Mörfelden on a former garbage deposit, the lowest is 83.2 m high and situated at the mouth of the Main into the Rhine.

== Coat of arms ==
The district coat of arms might be described thus: Per pale barry of ten gules and argent and barry of five argent and sable, at the fess point an inescutcheon azure with three lozenges argent.

The dexter (armsbearer&#x27;s right, viewer&#x27;s left) side of the coat of arms shows bars in the red and silver tinctures of Hesse, the sinister (armsbearer&#x27;s left, viewer&#x27;s right) side the silver and black bars of the Counts of Isenburg. In the middle are the arms of the Von Dornberg family, the ancestors of the Counts of Katzenelnbogen.

<doc id="203183" wikidata="Q359319" url="?curid=203183" title="Taha Yassin Ramadan">
<text>Taha Yasin Ramadan al-Jizrawi (; 20 February 1938 – 20 March 2007) was an Iraqi military officer and politician who served as the vice president of Iraq from March 1991 to the fall of Saddam Hussein in April 2003 and the commander of the Popular Army.

He is often referred to as &quot;the difficult man&quot; and &quot;the man of major missions.&quot; Known for his serious demeanor and deep knowledge of Iraqi-Soviet relations, he has played a significant role in Iraq&#x27;s leadership. In an interview with &quot;Al-Majalla&quot; published on January 24, 2022, Ramadan discussed a variety of issues, including Iraq’s foreign relations, the ongoing Iran-Iraq war, the economic situation, and the role of the People’s Army.

== Early life ==
Ramadan was born sometime between 1936 and 1938 to a peasant family in Mosul. Sources have claimed he is of Kurdish origin, while his family has stated he is Arab. Ramadan graduated from the Military College and initially retired from service in 1959. 

== Career ==
He returned to the military following the events of February 8, 1963, but retired again in 1964 and spent two years under house arrest. Subsequently, he was elected as a member of the regional leadership of the Iraqi Ba&#x27;ath Party.

After the 17 July Revolution of 1968, he was reinstated in the army and became a member of the Revolutionary Command Council in November 1969. In early 1970, he presided over a special court that tried &quot;enemies of the revolution.&quot; By March 1970, he was appointed Minister of Industry, a role he held until becoming Minister of Housing in 1976.

Ramadan also served as the commander of the Iraqi Popular Army, a militia aligned with the Ba&#x27;ath Party. In early 1974, he was re-elected to the Ba&#x27;ath Party&#x27;s regional leadership and acted as Minister of Planning from November 1974 to May 1976. By 1977, he was elected to the National Command of the Ba&#x27;ath Party.

Ramadan provided insight into the People’s Army, a key component of Iraq’s defense strategy. He explained that while the People’s Army, with around 600,000 trained members, was a reserve force, it was not a regular military unit. Its primary role was to support the regular army and maintain the home front. Ramadan stated that the People&#x27;s Army was a militia with a unique training regime and was integrated into the national defense under the leadership of the regular army. The personnel of the People’s Army participated in front-line duties based on military leadership&#x27;s guidance.

Regarding the potential for peace, Ramadan reiterated Iraq&#x27;s readiness for negotiations based on international norms, historical borders, and non-interference in internal affairs. However, he maintained that the Iranian conditions for ending the war were unacceptable, as they amounted to a breach of Iraq’s sovereignty.

== Vice-President ==
On July 16, 1979, following Saddam Hussein&#x27;s rise to the presidency, Ramadan was appointed First Deputy Prime Minister. This position enabled him to oversee the activities of various ministries and state institutions, as well as undertake visits to Western European countries and the former Soviet Union.

=== Iran–Iraq War ===
During the interview, Ramadan was asked about the broader Arab context of the Iran-Iraq war. He stated that in the early years of the war, some Arab parties used the conflict as a cover for their own issues, claiming that Iraq’s involvement was a distraction from the real battle – the defense of Palestine. Ramadan emphasized that Iraq’s defense of its sovereignty, especially in Basra and the Shatt al-Arab region, was critical, as those territories were central to Iraq&#x27;s survival. He pointed out that the reluctance of some Arab countries to fully support Iraq in its struggle against Iran was part of a broader Arab disunity that was weakening the region.

He expressed disappointment with certain Arab states that failed to take decisive or supportive stances, criticizing their inability to act when Iraq was under direct threat. Ramadan lamented the &quot;silent spectator&quot; role many Arab countries took during the war, reflecting what he described as a painful and fragmented Arab political landscape. According to Ramadan, had the Arab countries shown more unity and determination, the war might not have prolonged as it did.

When asked whether the continuation of the war was driven by military or political decisions, Ramadan acknowledged that although Iran had indicated a desire to invade Iraq, the conflict had not yet reached a decisive point. He argued that while Iraq’s military strength was formidable, the Arab situation, international interests, and the Iranian stance made it difficult to resolve the war. He stressed that Iraq was committed to defending its land but had no intention of invading Iranian territory. Peace, he suggested, could only become a reality if Iran was willing to engage in meaningful negotiations.

Finally, when questioned about reports of Iranian prisoners of war, Ramadan stated that he did not have official statistics on the number of prisoners. He denied the existence of civilian prisoners, although he invited further inquiries from &quot;The Economist&quot;.

=== Economy and social impact during war ===
On the topic of Iraq&#x27;s economic situation during the war, Ramadan rejected claims that the country was facing a financial crisis. He acknowledged that the war had strained Iraq’s resources but argued that Iraq’s economy was structurally solid. Iraq had managed to navigate the challenges of war without significant disruption to its internal economic stability. Ramadan pointed out that, despite the war, Iraq had continued to build and maintain its infrastructure, with citizens generally not feeling the war&#x27;s effects as strongly as those in other nations involved in shorter conflicts. He refuted claims that Iraq’s economic difficulties were due to war, stating that the situation was more about monetary adjustments and borrowing from various countries, which did not indicate an imbalance.

Ramadan emphasized that Iraq&#x27;s economy was adapting and continuing to grow, despite challenges. He argued that the nation’s socialist approach, combined with its ability to maintain economic activity even during war, set it apart from other countries. He also noted that while citizens did feel some concern over scarcity, the overall economic health of the country remained strong.

In the interview, Ramadan was asked about the social consequences of the Iraq-Iran war, particularly concerning the impact on students and families. He dismissed the notion that university students were being unnecessarily sent to the front lines, claiming that the Iraqi government ensured students could finish their education before being called to serve. He acknowledged that the war had created some social issues, but he emphasized the government’s focus on keeping the public engaged and responsible for their own defense.

=== Foreign relations ===
Despite international pressure, he played a crucial role in strengthening Iraq&#x27;s diplomatic and economic ties with several key nations. He led efforts to improve relations with Russia, India, Iran, and neighboring countries, positioning Iraq as a more active player on the global stage. His outreach aimed at diversifying Iraq&#x27;s alliances and reducing its dependence on Western powers, particularly amid ongoing tensions with the United States. In 2000, Ramadan made an official visit to India.

At the same time, according to Middle East analyst Amir Taheri, he was also involved in a &quot;Mafia-style crime syndicate&quot; that dominated Iraq&#x27;s trade, particularly in dealings with France and Germany. This suggests that beyond official diplomatic efforts, he played a significant role in managing illicit networks that facilitated trade and imports, circumventing international sanctions.

In 2000 and 2001, he further expanded Iraq&#x27;s economic partnerships by signing free trade agreements with countries such as Jordan, Egypt, and Syria. These agreements weakened U.S. efforts to isolate Iraq economically and politically, providing the country with alternative markets and trade routes despite ongoing sanctions. His ability to foster these alliances demonstrated a strategic push to counterbalance American influence in the region.

=== Proposed resolution to United States–Iraq conflict ===
In October 2002, four months before the United States invaded Iraq, Ramadan suggested U.S. President George W. Bush and Saddam Hussein settle their difference in a duel. He reasoned this would not only serve as an alternative to a war that was certain to damage Iraq&#x27;s infrastructure, but that it would also reduce the suffering of the Iraqi and American peoples. Ramadan&#x27;s offer included the possibility that a group of US officials would face off with a group of Iraqi officials of same or similar rank (President v. President, Vice President v. Vice President, etc.). Ramadan proposed that the duel be held in a neutral land, with each party using the same weapons, and with UN Secretary General Kofi Annan presiding as the supervisor. On behalf of Bush, White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer declined the offer.

=== Later years ===
Ramadan endured multiple assassination attempts, surviving two in 1997 and another in 1999, highlighting the volatile nature of Iraqi politics and the threats he faced from both internal and external adversaries. Despite these dangers, his unwavering loyalty to Saddam Hussein ensured his continued presence in the upper echelons of power. However, this same loyalty also constrained him, preventing him from making an independent bid for absolute authority.

In his later years, his influence diminished as Saddam&#x27;s sons, Uday Hussein and Qusay Hussein, consolidated their control, sidelining other key figures within the regime. While Ramadan remained a significant figure, he was ultimately overshadowed by the growing dominance of the Hussein family.

== Post-2003 ==
Following the fall of Saddam&#x27;s government, Taha Yasin Ramadan was placed on the U.S. list of most-wanted Iraqis and depicted as the &quot;Ten of Diamonds&quot; in the US deck of most-wanted Iraqi playing cards. He was captured on August 19, 2003, in Mosul, by fighters of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) and handed over to US forces.

He was one of the defendants in the Iraq Special Tribunal&#x27;s Al-Dujail trial. On 5 November 2006, he was sentenced to life imprisonment. On 26 December 2006, the appeals court sent the case file back to the Tribunal, saying the sentence was too lenient and demanding a death sentence. 

== Execution ==
On 12 February 2007, he was sentenced to death by hanging. His sentence was carried out on the fourth anniversary of US invasion of Iraq, before dawn on 20 March 2007.

<text>Carlo Urbani (; 19 October 1956 – 29 March 2003) was an Italian physician and microbiologist and the first to identify severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) as probably a new and dangerously contagious viral disease, and his early warning to the World Health Organization (WHO) triggered a swift and global response credited with saving numerous lives. Shortly afterwards, he himself became infected and died.

== Medical career ==
Urbani graduated with a medical degree in 1981 from the University of Ancona and specialized in infectious and tropical diseases from the University of Messina. He subsequently earned a postgraduate degree in tropical parasitology.

Urbani started volunteering for the African endemic disease cause since young joining the Italian Catholic NGO Mani Tese. In 1987 Urbani went to Ethiopia for one month. In 1989 he was primary aide in the infectious diseases department of Macerata, Italy. After years working in the epidemic medicine field, in 1993 he became an external consultant of the World Health Organization.

In 1996, he joined Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) and moved with his family to Phnom Penh, Cambodia for a year. Upon his return to his workplace in Macerata, he became president of the Italian section of MSF. He also helped launch a campaign against multinational pharmaceutical companies that keep up the price of indispensable medicines against AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. In 1999 he was part of the delegation that received the Nobel Peace Prize awarded to MSF. With the prize money, Urbani decided to create a fund to promote an international campaign for access to essential medicines for the world&#x27;s poorest populations.

== SARS outbreak ==
Back in Asia, Urbani was called into The French Hospital of Hanoi, Vietnam, in late February 2003 to look at an American patient, businessman Johnny Chen, who had fallen ill with what doctors thought was a bad case of influenza. Urbani realized that Chen&#x27;s ailment was probably a new and highly contagious disease. He immediately notified the WHO, triggering a response to the epidemic (principally isolation and quarantine measures) that ended it within five months. He also persuaded the Vietnamese Health Ministry to begin isolating patients and screening travelers, thus slowing the early pace of the epidemic.

On 11 March 2003, as he flew from Hanoi to a conference in Bangkok, Thailand, where he was to talk on the subject of childhood parasites, Urbani started feeling feverish. A colleague who met him at the airport called an ambulance. Urbani had contracted SARS while treating infected patients in Hanoi. His Bangkok hospital room became an improvised isolation ward, and communication occurred via an intercom. As his lungs weakened, he was put on a ventilator. During a moment of consciousness, Urbani asked for a priest to give him last rites and asked for his lung tissue to be donated for scientific research. Urbani died on 29 March 2003, after 18 days of intensive care.

SARS-CoV Urbani strain later became the reference variant of this outbreak.

== Personal life ==
Urbani married Giuliana Chiorrini in 1983, and in 1987 their first child, Tommaso, was born. 
He had two more children.

<doc id="203196" wikidata="Q1123168" url="?curid=203196" title="List of aircraft carriers of the United States Navy">
<text>Aircraft carriers are warships that act as airbases for carrier-based aircraft. In the United States Navy, these ships are designated with hull classification symbols such as CV (Aircraft Carrier), CVA (Attack Aircraft Carrier), CVB (Large Aircraft Carrier), CVL (Light Aircraft Carrier), CVE (Escort Aircraft Carrier), CVS (Antisubmarine Aircraft Carrier) and CVN (Aircraft Carrier (Nuclear Propulsion)). Beginning with the , (CV-59 to present) all carriers commissioned into service are classified as supercarriers. 

The U.S. Navy has also used escort aircraft carriers (CVE, previously AVG and ACV) and airship aircraft carriers (ZRS). In addition, various amphibious warfare ships (LHA, LHD, LPH, and to a lesser degree LPD and LSD classes) can operate as carriers; two of these were converted to mine countermeasures support ships (MCS), one of which carried minesweeping helicopters. All of these classes of ships have their own lists and so are not included here.

==Historical overview==
The first aircraft carrier commissioned into the U.S. Navy was on 20 March 1922. The &quot;Langley&quot; was a converted &quot;Proteus-class collier,&quot; originally commissioned as USS &quot;Jupiter&quot; (AC-3). It was soon followed by the other pre-World War II classes: the ; , the first U.S. purpose-built carrier; the, and .

As World War II loomed, two more classes of carriers were commissioned under President Franklin Roosevelt: the , which is informally divided into regular bow and extended bow sub-classes, and the ships, which are classified as light aircraft carriers. Between these two classes, 35 ships were completed. The Navy also purchased two training vessels, and , which were given the unclassified miscellaneous (IX) hull designation.

The and the were built later in World War II, but entered service too late to serve in the war. The &quot;Midway&quot; class would serve during the entire Cold War. 

At the start of the Cold War, the first supercarriers, the &quot;United States&quot; class, were canceled due to the Truman administration&#x27;s policy of shrinking the United States Navy and in particular, the Navy&#x27;s air assets. The policy was revised after a public outcry and Congressional hearings sparked by the Revolt of the Admirals.

Later in the Cold War, supercarrier construction began with the , followed by the ; , the first nuclear-powered carrier; and , the last conventionally powered carrier. These were followed by the and the modern-day post-cold war nuclear supercarriers, the only two classes of supercarriers that are currently in active-duty service. With the ten-ship &quot;Nimitz&quot; class complete by 2009, October 2013 saw the launch of , lead ship of the planned ten-ship &quot;Gerald R. Ford&quot; class. This was followed by the launch of in October 2019, while construction is underway on and .

==Training ships==
During World War II, the United States Navy purchased two Great Lakes side-wheel paddle steamers and converted them into freshwater aircraft carrier training ships. Both vessels were designated with the hull classification symbol IX and lacked hangar decks, elevators or armaments. The role of these ships was for the training of pilots for carrier take-offs and landings in a safe area where the carriers would not be at risk of attack by hostile forces. Together the &quot;Sable&quot; and &quot;Wolverine&quot; trained 17,820 pilots in 116,000 carrier landings. Of these, 51,000 landings were on &quot;Sable&quot;.

<doc id="203197" wikidata="Q1071343" url="?curid=203197" title="Memory effect">
<text>Memory effect, also known as battery effect, lazy battery effect, or battery memory, is an effect observed in nickel-cadmium rechargeable batteries that causes them to hold less charge. It describes the situation in which nickel-cadmium batteries gradually lose their maximum energy capacity if they are repeatedly recharged after being only partially discharged. The battery appears to &quot;remember&quot; the smaller capacity.

==True memory effect==
The term &quot;memory&quot; came from an aerospace nickel-cadmium application in which the cells were repeatedly discharged to 25% of available capacity (give or take 1%) by exacting computer control, then recharged to 100% capacity without overcharge. This long-term, repetitive cycle régime, with no provision for overcharge, resulted in a loss of capacity beyond the 25% discharge point. True memory cannot exist if any one (or more) of the following conditions holds:
* batteries achieve full overcharge.
* discharge is not exactly the same each cycle, within plus or minus 3%
* discharge is to less than 1.0 volt per cell

True memory-effect is specific to sintered-plate nickel-cadmium cells, and is exceedingly difficult to reproduce, especially in lower ampere-hour cells. In one particular test program designed to induce the effect, none was found after more than 700 precisely-controlled charge/discharge cycles. In the program, spirally-wound one-ampere-hour cells were used. In a follow-up program, 20-ampere-hour aerospace-type cells were used on a similar test régime; memory effects were observed after a few hundred cycles.

==Other problems perceived as memory effect==
Phenomena which are not true memory effects may also occur in battery types other than sintered-plate nickel-cadmium cells. In particular, lithium-based cells, not normally subject to the memory effect, may change their voltage levels so that a virtual decrease of capacity may be perceived by the battery control system.

===Temporary effects===

====Voltage depression due to long-term over-charging====
A common process often ascribed to memory effect is voltage depression. In this case, the output voltage of the battery drops more quickly than normal as it is used, even though the total capacity remains almost the same. In modern electronic equipment that monitors the voltage to indicate battery charge, the battery appears to be draining very quickly. To the user, it appears the battery is not holding its full charge, which seems similar to memory effect. This is a common problem with high-load devices such as digital cameras and cell phones.

Voltage depression is caused by repeated over-charging of a battery, which causes the formation of small crystals of electrolyte on the plates. These can clog the plates, increasing resistance and lowering the voltage of some individual cells in the battery. This causes the battery as a whole to seem to discharge rapidly as those individual cells discharge quickly and the voltage of the battery as a whole suddenly falls. This effect is very common, as consumer trickle chargers typically overcharge. Nickel–metal hydride batteries, for example, are known to experience this form of capacity loss often mistakenly attributed to memory effect.

=====Repair=====
The effect can be overcome by subjecting each cell of the battery to one or more deep charge/discharge cycles. This must be done to the individual cells, not a multi-cell battery; in a battery, some cells may discharge before others, resulting in those cells being subjected to a reverse charging current by the remaining cells, potentially leading to irreversible damage.

====High temperatures====
High temperatures can also reduce the charged voltage and the charge accepted by the cells.

====Other causes====
* Operation below 32 °F (0 °C)
* High discharge rates (above 5C) in a battery not specifically designed for such use
* Inadequate charging time
* Defective charger

===Permanent loss of capacity===

====Deep discharge====
Some rechargeable batteries can be damaged by repeated deep discharge. Batteries are composed of multiple similar, but not identical, cells. Each cell has its own charge capacity. As the battery as a whole is being deeply discharged, the cell with the smallest capacity may reach zero charge and will &quot;reverse charge&quot; as the other cells continue to force current through it. The resulting loss of capacity is often ascribed to the memory effect.

Battery users may attempt to avoid the memory effect proper by fully discharging their battery packs. This practice is likely to cause more damage as one of the cells will be deep discharged. The damage is focused on the weakest cell, so that each additional full discharge will cause more and more damage to that cell. Repeated deep discharges can exacerbate the degradation of the weakest cell, leading to an imbalance in the battery pack, where the affected cell becomes a limiting factor in overall performance. Over time, this imbalance can result in reduced capacity, shorter run times, and the potential for overcharging or overheating of the other cells, further compromising the battery&#x27;s safety and longevity.

====Age and use—normal end-of-life====
All rechargeable batteries have a finite lifespan and will slowly lose storage capacity as they age due to secondary chemical reactions within the battery whether it is used or not. Some cells may fail sooner than others, but the effect is to reduce the voltage of the battery. Lithium-based batteries have one of the longest idle lives of any construction. Unfortunately the number of operational cycles is still quite low at approximately 400–1200 complete charge/discharge cycles. The lifetime of lithium batteries decreases at higher temperature and states of charge (SoC), whether used or not; maximum life of lithium cells when not in use(storage) is achieved by refrigerating (without freezing) charged to 30%–50% SoC. To prevent overdischarge, battery should be brought back to room temperature and recharged to 50% SoC once every six months or once per year.

<text>The 1998 bombing of Iraq (code-named Operation Desert Fox) was a major bombing campaign against Iraqi targets, from 16 to 19 December 1998, by the United States and the United Kingdom. On 16 December 1998 Bill Clinton announced that he had ordered strikes against Iraq. The strikes were launched due to Iraq&#x27;s failure to comply with United Nations Security Council resolutions and its interference with United Nations inspectors that were searching for potential weapons of mass destruction. The inspectors had been sent to Iraq beginning in 1991 and were repeatedly refused access to certain sites.

The operation was a major flare-up in the Iraq disarmament crisis as it involved a direct attack on Iraq. The aim of the bombing was to disable military and security targets which may have enabled Iraq to produce, store, maintain, and deliver weapons of mass destruction. The bombing campaign had been anticipated earlier in the year and faced criticism both in the U.S. and from members of the international community. Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, and the United Arab Emirates initially announced they would deny the U.S. military the use of local bases for the purpose of air strikes against Iraq.

The bombing was criticized by Clinton&#x27;s detractors, who accused him of using the bombing to direct attention away from the ongoing impeachment proceedings he was facing.

==Background==
U.S. President Bill Clinton had been working under a regional security framework of dual containment, which involved utilizing military force when Iraq challenged the United States or the international community.

Although there was no Authorization for Use of Military Force, Clinton signed the Iraq Liberation Act into law on 31 October 1998. The new act appropriated funds for Iraqi opposition groups with the goal of carrying out a regime change.

Prior to Desert Fox, the U.S. almost led a bombing campaign against Saddam called Operation Desert Thunder. It was abandoned at the last minute when Iraq allowed the United Nations to continue weapons inspections.

==Degrading WMD capabilities==

Clinton administration officials stated that the aim of the mission was to degrade Iraq&#x27;s ability to manufacture and use weapons of mass destruction, not to eliminate it. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, when questioned about the distinction between degradation and elimination, commented that the operation did not strive to eliminate Iraqi weapons of mass destruction, but instead to make their use and production more difficult and less reliable.

The main targets of the bombing included weapons research and development installations, air defense systems, weapon and supply depots, and the barracks and command headquarters of Saddam&#x27;s elite Republican Guard. Iraqi air defense batteries, unable to target the American and British jets, began to blanket the sky with near random bursts of flak fire however the air strikes continued, and cruise missile barrages launched by naval vessels began being used in addition to bombs dropped by planes. By the night of the fourth day of the operation most of the specified targets had been damaged or destroyed and the operation was deemed a success.

==Military operations==
U.S. Navy aircraft from Carrier Air Wing Three, flying from the , and Patrol Squadron Four flew combat missions from the Persian Gulf in support of ODF. The operation marked the first time that women flew combat sorties as U.S. Navy strike fighter pilots and the first combat use of the United States Air Force&#x27;s B-1B bomber. Ground units included the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit (Special Operations Capable), of which 2nd Battalion 4th Marines served as the ground combat element. The U.S. Air Force sent several sorties of F-16s and A-10s from Ahmad al-Jaber Air Base into Iraq to fly night missions in support of the operation.

On the second night of Operation Desert Fox, 12 B-52s took off from the island of Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean and launched a barrage of conventional air-launched cruise missiles (CALCMs). The other bomber wing was the 28th AEG out of Thumrait AB. The missiles successfully struck multiple Iraqi targets, including six of President Saddam Hussein&#x27;s palaces, several Republican Guard barracks, and the Ministries of Defense and Military Industry. The following evening, two more B-52 crews launched 16 more CALCMs. Over a two-night period, aircrews from the 2nd and 5th Bomb Wings launched a total of 90 CALCMs. The B-1 Lancer bomber made its combat debut by striking at Republican Guard targets. From Thumrait AB, Sultanate Oman. The 28th AEG with the B-1b aircraft from Ellsworth and Dyess AFB also conducted missions. Also on 17 Dec, USAF aircraft based in Kuwait participated, as did British Royal Air Force Tornado aircraft. The British contribution totaled 15 percent of the sorties flown during Desert Fox.

By 19 December, U.S. and British aircraft had struck 97 targets, and Secretary of Defense William Cohen claimed the operation was a success. Supported by Secretary Cohen, as well as United States Central Command commander General Anthony Zinni and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Henry H. Shelton, President Bill Clinton declared &quot;victory&quot; in Operation Desert Fox. In total, the 70-hour campaign saw U.S. forces strike 85 percent of their targets, 75 percent of which were considered &quot;highly effective&quot; strikes. More than 600 sorties were flown by more than 300 combat and support aircraft, and 600 air-dropped munitions were employed, including 90 air-launched cruise missiles and 325 Tomahawk land attack missiles (TLAM). Operation Desert Fox inflicted serious damage to Iraq&#x27;s missile development program, although its effects on any WMD program were not clear. Nevertheless, Operation Desert Fox was the largest strike against Iraq since the early 1990s Persian Gulf War, until the commencement of Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2003. In October 2021, Zinni gave a retrospective about the operation.

97 sites were targeted in the operation with 415 cruise missiles and 600 bombs, including 11 weapons production or storage facilities, 18 security facilities for weapons, 9 military installations, 20 government CCC facilities, 32 surface-to-air missile batteries, 6 airfields, and 1 oil refinery. According to U.S. Defense Department assessments, on 20 December, 10 of these targets were destroyed, 18 severely damaged, 18 moderately damaged, 18 lightly damaged, and 23 not yet assessed. According to the Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister, the allied action resulted in 242 Iraqi military casualties, including 62 killed and 180 wounded. However, on 5 January 1999, American General Harry Shelton told the U.S. Senate that the strikes killed or wounded an estimated 1,400 members of Iraq&#x27;s Republican Guard. The number of Civilian casualties has been equally disputed. Iraq&#x27;s former ambassador to the UN, Nizar Hamdoon said in December 1998 that there was thousands of civilians dead and wounded. The international Red Cross reported 40 civilians killed and 80 injured in Baghdad.

==Reaction==
In reaction to the attack, three of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council (Russia, France, and the People&#x27;s Republic of China) called for the lifting of the eight-year oil embargo on Iraq, the reorganizing or disbanding of the United Nations Special Commission, and the firing of its chairman, Australian diplomat Richard Butler.

==Criticism==

===Accusations of an ulterior motive===
Former U.S. Army intelligence analyst William Arkin claimed in his January 1999 column in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; that the operation was focused on destabilizing the Iraqi government, and that claims of WMDs were being used as an excuse.

According to Department of Defense personnel with whom Arkin spoke, CENTCOM chief Anthony Zinni stated that the U.S. only attacked biological and chemical sites that had been identified with a high degree of certainty, and that the reason for the low number of targets was because intelligence specialists could not identify weapons sites with enough specificity to comply with Zinni&#x27;s directive.

Dr. Brian Jones was the top intelligence analyst on chemical, biological and nuclear weapons at the Ministry of Defence. He told &quot;BBC Panorama&quot; in 2004 that Defence Intelligence Staff in Whitehall did not have a high degree of confidence any of the facilities bombed in Operation Desert Fox were active in producing weapons of mass destruction. The testimony given by Jones is supported by the former Deputy Chief of Defence Intelligence, John Morrison, who informed the same program that, before the operation had ended, DIS came under pressure to validate a prepared statement to be delivered by then Prime Minister Tony Blair, declaring the operation an unqualified success. Large-scale damage assessment takes time, responded Morrison, therefore his department declined to sign up to a premature statement. &quot;After Desert Fox, I actually sent a note round to all the analysts involved congratulating them on standing firm in the face of, in some cases, individual pressure to say things that they knew weren&#x27;t true&quot;. Later on, after careful assessment and consideration, Defence Intelligence Staff determined that the bombing had not been all that effective.

The Duelfer Report concluded in 2004 that Iraq&#x27;s WMD capability &quot;was essentially destroyed in 1991&quot; following the end of sanctions.

===Distraction from Clinton impeachment scandal===
Some critics of the Clinton administration, including Republican members of Congress, expressed concern over the timing of Operation Desert Fox. The four-day bombing campaign occurred at the same time the U.S. House of Representatives was conducting the impeachment hearing of President Clinton. Clinton was impeached by the House on 19 December, the last day of the bombing campaign. A few months earlier, similar criticism was levelled during Operation Infinite Reach, wherein missile strikes were ordered against suspected terrorist bases in Sudan and Afghanistan on 20 August. The missile strikes began three days after Clinton was called to testify before a grand jury during the Lewinsky scandal and his subsequent nationally televised address later that evening in which Clinton admitted to having an inappropriate relationship.

===Criticism of the extent of the operation===
Other critics, such as former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, said the attacks did not go far enough, commenting that a short campaign was likely not to make a significant impact.

According to Charles Duelfer, after the bombing, the Iraqi ambassador to the UN told him, &quot;If we had known that was all you would do, we would have ended the inspections long ago.&quot;

Gen. Peter de la Billiere, a former head of the SAS who commanded British forces in the 1991 Gulf war, questioned the political impact of the bombing campaign, saying aerial bombardments were not effective in driving people into submission, but tend to make them more defiant.

<doc id="203200" wikidata="Q7029" url="?curid=203200" title="Quark star">
<text>A quark star is a hypothetical type of compact, exotic star, where extremely high core temperature and pressure have forced nuclear particles to form quark matter, a continuous state of matter consisting of free quarks.

==Background==
Some massive stars collapse to form neutron stars at the end of their life cycle, as has been both observed and explained theoretically. Under the extreme temperatures and pressures inside neutron stars, the neutrons are normally kept apart by a degeneracy pressure, stabilizing the star and hindering further gravitational collapse. However, it is hypothesized that under even more extreme temperature and pressure, the degeneracy pressure of the neutrons is overcome, and the neutrons are forced to merge and dissolve into their constituent quarks, creating an ultra-dense phase of quark matter based on densely packed quarks. In this state, a new equilibrium is supposed to emerge, as a new degeneracy pressure between the quarks, as well as repulsive electromagnetic forces, will occur and hinder total gravitational collapse.

If these ideas are correct, quark stars might occur, and be observable, somewhere in the universe. Such a scenario is seen as scientifically plausible, but has not been proven observationally or experimentally; the very extreme conditions needed for stabilizing quark matter cannot be created in any laboratory and has not been observed directly in nature. The stability of quark matter, and hence the existence of quark stars, is for these reasons among the unsolved problems in physics.

If quark stars can form, then the most likely place to find quark star matter would be inside neutron stars that exceed the internal pressure needed for quark degeneracy – the point at which neutrons break down into a form of dense quark matter. They could also form if a massive star collapses at the end of its life, provided that it is possible for a star to be large enough to collapse beyond a neutron star but not large enough to form a black hole.

If they exist, quark stars would resemble and be easily mistaken for neutron stars: they would form in the death of a massive star in a Type II supernova, be extremely dense and small, and possess a very high gravitational field. They would also lack some features of neutron stars, unless they also contained a shell of neutron matter, because free quarks are not expected to have properties matching degenerate neutron matter. For example, they might be radio-silent, or have atypical sizes, electromagnetic fields, or surface temperatures, compared to neutron stars.

==History==
The analysis about quark stars was first proposed in 1965 by Soviet physicists D. D. Ivanenko and D. F. Kurdgelaidze. Their existence has not been confirmed.

The equation of state of quark matter is uncertain, as is the transition point between neutron-degenerate matter and quark matter. Theoretical uncertainties have precluded making predictions from first principles. Experimentally, the behaviour of quark matter is being actively studied with particle colliders, but this can only produce very hot (above 1012 K) quark–gluon plasma blobs the size of atomic nuclei, which decay immediately after formation. The conditions inside compact stars with extremely high densities and temperatures well below 1012 K cannot be recreated artificially, as there are no known methods to produce, store or study &quot;cold&quot; quark matter directly as it would be found inside quark stars. The theory predicts quark matter to possess some peculiar characteristics under these conditions.

==Formation==

It is hypothesized that when the neutron-degenerate matter, which makes up neutron stars, is put under sufficient pressure from the star&#x27;s own gravity or the initial supernova creating it, the individual neutrons break down into their constituent quarks (up quarks and down quarks), forming what is known as quark matter. This conversion may be confined to the neutron star&#x27;s center or it might transform the entire star, depending on the physical circumstances. Such a star is known as a quark star.

===Stability and strange quark matter===
Ordinary quark matter consisting of up and down quarks has a very high Fermi energy compared to ordinary atomic matter and is stable only under extreme temperatures and/or pressures. This suggests that the only stable quark stars will be neutron stars with a quark matter core, while quark stars consisting entirely of ordinary quark matter will be highly unstable and re-arrange spontaneously.

It has been shown that the high Fermi energy making ordinary quark matter unstable at low temperatures and pressures can be lowered substantially by the transformation of a sufficient number of up and down quarks into strange quarks, as strange quarks are, relatively speaking, a very heavy type of quark particle. This kind of quark matter is known specifically as strange quark matter and it is speculated and subject to current scientific investigation whether it might in fact be stable under the conditions of interstellar space (i.e. near zero external pressure and temperature). If this is the case (known as the Bodmer–Witten assumption), quark stars made entirely of quark matter would be stable if they quickly transform into strange quark matter.

===Strange stars===

Stars made of strange quark matter are known as strange stars. These form a distinct subtype of quark stars.

Theoretical investigations have revealed that quark stars might not only be produced from neutron stars and powerful supernovas, they could also be created in the early cosmic phase separations following the Big Bang. If these primordial quark stars transform into strange quark matter before the external temperature and pressure conditions of the early Universe makes them unstable, they might turn out stable, if the Bodmer–Witten assumption holds true. Such primordial strange stars could survive to this day.

==Characteristics==
Quark stars have some special characteristics that separate them from ordinary neutron stars. Under the physical conditions found inside neutron stars, with extremely high densities but temperatures well below 1012 K, quark matter is predicted to exhibit some peculiar characteristics. It is expected to behave as a Fermi liquid and enter a so-called color-flavor-locked (CFL) phase of color superconductivity, where &quot;color&quot; refers to the six &quot;charges&quot; exhibited in the strong interaction, instead of the two charges (positive and negative) in electromagnetism. At slightly lower densities, corresponding to higher layers closer to the surface of the compact star, the quark matter will behave as a non-CFL quark liquid, a phase that is even more mysterious than CFL and might include color conductivity and/or several additional yet undiscovered phases. None of these extreme conditions can currently be recreated in laboratories so nothing can be inferred about these phases from direct experiments.

==Observed overdense neutron stars==
At least under the assumptions mentioned above, the probability of a given neutron star being a quark star is low, so in the Milky Way there would only be a small population of quark stars. If it is correct, however, that overdense neutron stars can turn into quark stars, that makes the possible number of quark stars higher than was originally thought, as observers would be looking for the wrong type of star.

A neutron star without deconfinement to quarks and higher densities cannot have a rotational period shorter than a millisecond; even with the unimaginable gravity of such a condensed object the centripetal force of faster rotation would eject matter from the surface, so detection of a pulsar of millisecond or less period would be strong evidence of a quark star.

Observations released by the Chandra X-ray Observatory on April 10, 2002, detected two possible quark stars, designated RX J1856.5−3754 and 3C 58, which had previously been thought to be neutron stars. Based on the known laws of physics, the former appeared much smaller and the latter much colder than it should be, suggesting that they are composed of material denser than neutron-degenerate matter. However, these observations are met with skepticism by researchers who say the results were not conclusive; and since the late 2000s, the possibility that RX J1856 is a quark star has been excluded.

Another star, XTE J1739-285, has been observed by a team led by Philip Kaaret of the University of Iowa and reported as a possible quark star candidate.

In 2006, You-Ling Yue et al., from Peking University, suggested that PSR B0943+10 may in fact be a low-mass quark star.

It was reported in 2008 that observations of supernovae SN 2006gy, SN 2005gj and SN 2005ap also suggest the existence of quark stars. It has been suggested that the collapsed core of supernova SN 1987A may be a quark star.

In 2015, Zi-Gao Dai et al. from Nanjing University suggested that Supernova ASASSN-15lh is a newborn strange quark star.

In 2022 it was suggested that GW190425, which likely formed as a merger between two neutron stars giving off gravitational waves in the process, could be a quark star.

==Other hypothesized quark formations==

Apart from ordinary quark matter and strange quark matter, other types of quark-gluon plasma might hypothetically occur or be formed inside neutron stars and quark stars. This includes the following, some of which has been observed and studied in laboratories:

* Robert L. Jaffe 1977, suggested a four-quark state with strangeness (qs).
* Robert L. Jaffe 1977 suggested the H dibaryon, a six-quark state with equal numbers of up-, down-, and strange quarks (represented as uuddss or udsuds).
* Bound multi-quark systems with heavy quarks (QQ).
* In 1987, a pentaquark state was first proposed with a charm anti-quark (qqqs).
* Pentaquark state with an antistrange quark and four light quarks consisting of up- and down-quarks only (qqqq).
* Light pentaquarks are grouped within an antidecuplet, the lightest candidate, Θ+, which can also be described by the diquark model of Robert L. Jaffe and Wilczek (QCD).
* Θ++ and antiparticle −−.
* Doubly strange pentaquark (ssdd), member of the light pentaquark antidecuplet.
* Charmed pentaquark Θc(3100) (uudd) state was detected by the H1 collaboration.
* Tetraquark particles might form inside neutron stars and under other extreme conditions. In 2008, 2013 and 2014 the tetraquark particle of Z(4430), was discovered and investigated in laboratories on Earth.

<text>Betty Boop is an animated cartoon character designed by Grim Natwick at the request of Max Fleischer. She originally appeared in the &quot;Talkartoon&quot; and &quot;Betty Boop&quot; film series, which were produced by Fleischer Studios and released by Paramount Pictures. She was featured in 90 theatrical cartoons between 1930 and 1939. She has also been featured in comic strips and mass merchandising.

A caricature of a Jazz Age flapper, Betty Boop was described in a 1934 court case as &quot;combin[ing] in appearance the childish with the sophisticated—a large round baby face with big eyes and a nose like a button, framed in a somewhat careful coiffure, with a very small body of which perhaps the leading characteristic is the most self-confident little bust imaginable&quot;. She was toned down in the mid-1930s as a result of the Hays Code to appear more demure, and has become one of the world&#x27;s best-known and most popular cartoon characters.

==History==

===Origins===
Betty Boop made her first appearance in the cartoon &quot;Dizzy Dishes&quot;, released on August 9, 1930, the seventh installment in Fleischer&#x27;s &quot;Talkartoon&quot; series. Inspired by a popular performing style, the character was originally created as an anthropomorphic French poodle. Clara Bow is sometimes given credit as being the inspiration for Boop, though Fleischer told his artists that he wanted a caricature of singer Helen Kane. Kane later sued Fleischer over the signature &quot;Boop Oop a Doop&quot; line. Betty Boop appeared as a supporting character in ten cartoons as a flapper girl with more heart than brains. In individual cartoons, she was called &quot;Nancy Lee&quot; or &quot;Nan McGrew&quot;—derived from the Helen Kane film &quot;Dangerous Nan McGrew&quot; (1930)—usually serving as a girlfriend to studio star Bimbo.

Within a year, Betty made the transition from an incidental human-canine breed to a completely human female character. While much credit has been given to Grim Natwick for helping to transform Max Fleischer&#x27;s creation, her transition into the cute cartoon girl was also in part due to the work of Bernard Wolf, Otto Feuer, Seymour Kneitel, Roland &quot;Doc&quot; Crandall, Willard Bowsky, and James &quot;Shamus&quot; Culhane. By the release of &quot;Any Rags&quot;, Betty Boop was forever established as a human character. Her floppy poodle ears became hoop earrings, and her black poodle nose became a girl&#x27;s button-like nose.

Betty was first voiced by Margie Hines. Later, several different voice actresses performed the role, including Kate Wright, Bonnie Poe, Ann Rothschild (also known as Little Ann Little), and especially Mae Questel, who began voicing Betty Boop in &quot;Bimbo&#x27;s Silly Scandals&quot; (1931), and continued with the role until 1939, returning nearly 50 years later in Disney&#x27;s &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot; (1988). Today, Betty is voiced by Cindy Robinson since 2015.

Although Betty&#x27;s first name was assumed to have been established in the 1931 Screen Songs cartoon &quot;Betty Co-ed&quot;, this &quot;Betty&quot; is a different character, which the official Betty Boop website describes as a &quot;prototype&quot; of Betty Boop. At least 12 Screen Songs cartoons featured Betty Boop or a similar character.

Betty Boop was the star of the &quot;Talkartoons&quot; by 1932 and was given her own series that same year, beginning with &quot;Stopping the Show&quot;. From that point on, she was crowned &quot;The Queen of the Animated Screen&quot;. The series was popular throughout the 1930s.

Since the character was created by an Austrian Jew and eventually voiced by a Jewish actress, Mae Questel, animation fans sometimes try to pinpoint various aspects that hint at Betty&#x27;s Jewishness. The 1932 Talkartoon &quot;Minnie the Moocher&quot; featured the only appearance of Betty&#x27;s parents: a strict immigrant couple, who get upset that Betty does not want to eat the traditional German foods &quot;hasenpfeffer&quot; (rabbit stew) and &quot;sauerbraten&quot;. Benjamin Ivry of &quot;Forward&quot; says that any of this evidence is ambiguous, as these are not kosher foods, and the accents of the parents are comical German accents, rather than Jewish.

Betty appeared in the first &quot;Color Classic&quot; cartoon &quot;Poor Cinderella&quot;, her only theatrical color appearance in 1934. In the film, she was depicted with red hair as opposed to her typical black hair.

===Contemporary resurgence===
The Betty Boop films were revived after Paramount sold them for syndication in 1955. UM&amp;M and National Telefilm Associates were required to remove the original Paramount logo from the opening and closing, as well as any references to Paramount in the copyright line on the main titles. However, the mountain motif remains on some television prints, usually with a UM&amp;M copyright line, while recent versions have circulated with the Paramount-Publix reference in cartoons from 1931.

The original Betty Boop cartoons were made in black and white. As new color cartoons made specifically for television began to appear in the 1960s, the original black-and-white cartoons were retired. Boop&#x27;s film career had a revival with the release of &quot;The Betty Boop Scandals of 1974&quot;, becoming a part of the post-1960s counterculture. NTA attempted to capitalize on this with a new syndication package, but because no market existed for cartoons in black and white, they sent them to South Korea, where the cartoons were hand-traced frame-by-frame in color, resulting in the degradation of the animation quality and timing. Unable to sell these to television largely because of the sloppy colorization, they assembled a number of the color cartoons in a compilation feature titled &quot;Betty Boop for President&quot;, to connect with the 1976 election, but it did not receive a theatrical release.

The release of the films on video cassette for home viewing created a new market for the films in their original form. The American Movie Classics cable television channel showcased a selection of the original black-and-white Betty Boop cartoons in the 1990s, which led to an eight-volume VHS and LV set, &quot;Betty Boop, the Definitive Collection&quot;. Some of the nonpublic-domain &quot;Boop&quot; cartoons copyrighted by Republic successor Melange Pictures (Paramount Global&#x27;s holding company that handles the Republic theatrical library) have been released by Olive Films under Paramount&#x27;s license, while the Internet Archive hosts 22 Betty Boop cartoons that are public domain.

==Portrayal==
===Sex symbol===

Betty Boop is regarded as one of the first and best-known sex symbols on the animated screen; she is a symbol of the Depression era and a reminder of the more carefree days of Jazz Age flappers. Her popularity was drawn largely from adult audiences, and the cartoons, while seemingly surreal, contained many sexual and psychological elements, particularly in the 1932 &quot;Talkartoon&quot; &quot;Minnie the Moocher&quot; (1932), featuring Cab Calloway and his orchestra.

&quot;Minnie the Moocher&quot; defined Betty&#x27;s character as a teenager of a modern era, at odds with the old-world ways of her parents. In the cartoon, after a disagreement with her strict parents, Betty runs away from home, accompanied by her boyfriend Bimbo, only to get lost in a haunted cave. A ghostly walrus (rotoscoped from live-action footage of Calloway) sings Calloway&#x27;s song &quot;Minnie the Moocher&quot;, accompanied by several other ghosts and skeletons. This haunting performance sends the frightened Betty and Bimbo back to the safety of home. &quot;Minnie the Moocher&quot; served as a promotion for Calloway&#x27;s subsequent stage appearances and also established Betty Boop as a cartoon star. The eight Talkartoons that followed all starred Betty, leading her into her own series beginning in 1932. With the release of &quot;Stopping the Show&quot; (August 1932), the Talkartoons were replaced by the &quot;Betty Boop&quot; series, which continued for the next seven years.

Betty Boop was unique among female cartoon characters because she represented a sexual woman. Other female cartoon characters of the same period, such as Minnie Mouse, displayed their underwear or bloomers regularly, in the style of childish or comical characters, not a fully defined woman&#x27;s form. Many other female cartoons were merely clones of their male co-stars, with alterations in costume, the addition of eyelashes, and a female voice. Betty Boop wore short dresses, high heels, a garter, and her breasts were highlighted with a low, contoured bodice that showed cleavage. In her cartoons, male characters frequently try to sneak a peek at her while she is changing or simply going about her business. In &quot;Betty Boop&#x27;s Bamboo Isle&quot;, she does the hula wearing nothing but a lei, strategically placed to cover her breasts, and a grass skirt. This was repeated in her first cameo appearance in &quot;Popeye the Sailor&quot; (1933). A certain girlish quality was given to the character. She was drawn with a head more similar to a baby&#x27;s than an adult&#x27;s in proportion to her body. This suggested the combination of girlishness and maturity that many people saw in the flapper type, which Betty represented.

While the character was kept pure and girl-like onscreen, compromises to her virtue were a challenge. The studio&#x27;s 1931 Christmas card featured Betty in bed with Santa Claus, winking at the viewer. The Talkartoons &quot;The Bum Bandit&quot; and &quot;Dizzy Red Riding Hood&quot; (both 1931) were given distinctly &quot;impure&quot; endings. Officially, Betty was only 16 years old, according to a 1932 interview with Fleischer (although in &quot;The Bum Bandit&quot;, she is portrayed as a married woman with many children and with an adult woman&#x27;s voice, rather than the standard &quot;boop-boop-a-doop&quot; voice).

Attempts to compromise her virginity were reflected in &quot;Chess-Nuts&quot; (1932) and most importantly in &quot;Boop-Oop-a-Doop&quot; (1932). In &quot;Chess-Nuts&quot;, the Black King goes into the house where Betty is and ties her up. When she rejects him, he pulls her out of the ropes, drags her off to the bedroom and says, &quot;I will have you&quot;. The bed, however, runs away, and Betty calls for help through the window. Bimbo comes to her rescue, and she is saved before anything happens. In &quot;Boop-Oop-a-Doop&quot;, Betty is a high-wire performer in a circus. The ringmaster lusts for Betty as he watches her from below, singing &quot;Do Something&quot;, a song previously performed by Helen Kane. As Betty returns to her tent, the ringmaster follows her inside and sensually massages her legs, surrounds her, and threatens her job if she does not submit. Betty pleads with the ringmaster to cease his advances, as she sings &quot;Don&#x27;t Take My Boop-Oop-A-Doop Away&quot;. Koko the Clown is practicing his juggling outside the tent and overhears the struggle inside. He leaps in to save Betty, struggling with the ringmaster, who loads him into a cannon and fires it. Koko, who remained hiding inside the cannon, knocks the ringmaster out cold with a mallet, while imitating the ringmaster&#x27;s laugh. Koko then inquires about Betty&#x27;s welfare, to which she answers in song, &quot;No, he couldn&#x27;t take my boop-oop-a-doop away&quot;. According to Jill Harness of &quot;Mental Floss&quot;, these portrayals of Boop fighting off sexual harassment on the animated screen made many see her as a feminist icon.

===Under the Production Code===
Betty Boop&#x27;s best appearances are considered to be in her first three years due to her &quot;Jazz Baby&quot; character and innocent sexuality, which was aimed at adults, but the content of her films was affected by the National Legion of Decency and the Production Code of 1934, which imposed guidelines on the motion-picture industry and placed specific restrictions on the content films could reference with sexual innuendos. This greatly affected the Betty Boop cartoons.

No longer a carefree flapper from the date the code went into effect on July 1, 1934, Betty became a spinster housewife or a career girl who wore a fuller dress or skirt. Additionally, as time progressed, the curls in her hair gradually decreased in number. She also eventually stopped wearing her gold bracelets and hoop earrings, and she became more mature and wiser in personality, compared to her earlier years. Right from the start, Joseph Breen, the new head film censor, had numerous complaints. Breen ordered the removal of the suggestive introduction that had started the cartoons because Betty Boop&#x27;s winks and shaking hips were deemed &quot;suggestive of immorality&quot;. For a few entries, Betty was given a new human boyfriend named Freddy, who was introduced in &quot;She Wronged Him Right&quot; (1934). Next, Betty was teamed with a puppy named Pudgy, beginning with &quot;Betty Boop&#x27;s Little Pal&quot; (1934). The following year saw the addition of the eccentric inventor Grampy, who debuted in &quot;Betty Boop and Grampy&quot; (1935).
While these cartoons were tame compared to her earlier appearances, their self-conscious wholesomeness was aimed at a more juvenile audience, which contributed to the decline of the series. Much of the decline was due to the lessening of Betty&#x27;s role in the cartoons in favor of her co-stars, not to mention Fleischer&#x27;s biggest success, Popeye. This was a similar problem experienced during the same period with Walt Disney&#x27;s Mickey Mouse, who was becoming eclipsed by the popularity of his co-stars Donald Duck, Goofy, and Pluto.

Since she was largely a musical novelty character, the animators attempted to keep Betty&#x27;s cartoons interesting by pairing her with popular comic strip characters such as Henry, The Little King and Little Jimmy, hoping to create an additional spin-off series with her pairing with Popeye in 1933. None of these films, though, generated a new series. When the flapper/jazz era that Betty represented had been replaced by the big bands of the swing era, Fleischer Studios made an attempt to develop a replacement character in this style in the 1938 &quot;Betty Boop&quot; cartoon &quot;Betty Boop and Sally Swing&quot;, but it was not a success.

The last &quot;Betty Boop&quot; cartoons were released in 1939, and a few made attempts to bring Betty into the swing era. In her last appearance, &quot;Rhythm on the Reservation&quot; (1939), Betty drives an open convertible, labeled &quot;Betty Boop&#x27;s Swing Band&quot;, through a Native American reservation, where she introduces the people to swing music and creates a &quot;Swinging Sioux Band&quot;. The &quot;Betty Boop&quot; cartoon series officially ended with &quot;Yip Yip Yippy&quot; (1939). While &quot;Yip Yip Yippy&quot; appears at the end of the Betty Boop series, it is actually a one-shot about a &quot;Drug Store&quot; mail-order cowboy &quot;wannabe&quot; without Betty, which was written mainly to fill the release schedule and fulfill the contract.

==Media==

===Television===
In 1955, Betty&#x27;s 110 cartoon appearances were sold to television syndicator UM&amp;M, which was acquired by National Telefilm Associates (NTA) in 1956. NTA was reorganized in 1985 as Republic Pictures, which folded in 2012, and became Melange Pictures, a subsidiary of Paramount Global, the parent company of Paramount. Paramount, Boop&#x27;s original home studio (via Melange/Paramount Global), acts as a theatrical distributor for the Boop cartoons that they originally released. Television rights are handled on Paramount&#x27;s behalf by Trifecta Entertainment &amp; Media, which in turn were inherited from CBS Television Distribution (renamed CBS Media Ventures in 2021), successor to other related companies, including Worldvision Enterprises, Republic Pictures Television, and NTA.

Betty Boop appeared in two television specials, &quot;The Romance of Betty Boop&quot; in 1985, which was produced by Lee Mendelson and Bill Melendez, the same creative team behind the Peanuts specials, and 1989&#x27;s &quot;The Betty Boop Movie Mystery&quot;; both specials are available on DVD as part of the Advantage Cartoon Mega Pack. While television revivals were conceived, nothing has materialized from the plans. Her most recent television appearance was an episode of &quot;Project Runaway All Stars&quot; in February 2018.

On February 11, 2016, &quot;Deadline&quot; announced that a new 26-episode television series focusing on Betty Boop is in production, in partnership with Normaal Animation, Fleischer Studios, and King Features. The show was to be aimed towards the tween and teenaged audiences. The show&#x27;s premise, according to the article, will &quot;recount the daily struggles, joys, and victories of young Betty Boop, who has every intention of being on stage and becoming a superstar&quot;.

===Home media===
While the animated cartoons featuring Betty Boop have enjoyed renewed attention over the last 30 years, official home-video releases have been limited to the VHS and LaserDisc collector&#x27;s sets in the 1990s. No such releases for the Betty Boop cartoons on DVD and Blu-ray were made until 2013, when Olive Films, under license from Paramount Home Entertainment, finally released the nonpublic domain cartoons, although they were restored from the original internegatives, these were altered in 1954 by a now defunct TV distributor named UM&amp;M TV Corp. and the altered opening and closing credits appear on these discs. Volume 1 was released on August 20, 2013, and volume 2 on September 24, 2013. Volume 3 was released on April 29, 2014, and volume 4 on September 30, 2014.

===Comics===
The &quot;Betty Boop&quot; comic strip by Bud Counihan (assisted by Fleischer staffer Hal Seeger) was distributed by King Features Syndicate from July 23, 1934, to November 28, 1937. From November 19, 1984, to January 31, 1988, a revival strip with Felix the Cat, &quot;Betty Boop and Felix&quot;, was produced by Mort Walker&#x27;s sons Brian, Neal, Greg, and Morgan. In 1990, First Comics published &quot;Betty Boop&#x27;s Big Break&quot;, a 52-page original graphic novel by Joshua Quagmire, Milton Knight, and Leslie Cabarga. In 2016, Dynamite Entertainment published new &quot;Betty Boop&quot; comics with 20 pages in the alternative American graphic novel style; four issues were released.
===Cancelled film projects===
In 1993, plans were made for an animated feature film of Betty Boop, but they were later cancelled. The musical storyboard scene of the proposed film can be seen online. The finished reel consists of Betty and her estranged father performing a jazz number together called &quot;Where are you?&quot; Jimmy Rowles and Sue Raney provide the vocals for Betty and Benny Boop.

Producers Steven Paul Leiva and Jerry Rees began production on a new Betty Boop feature film for the Zanuck Company and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. The script by Rees detailed Betty&#x27;s rise in Hollywood in the Golden Age of Hollywood. It was to be a musical with music by jazz musician Bennie Wallace and lyrics by Cheryl Ernst Wells. Wallace and Wells had completed several songs and 75% of the film had been storyboarded when, two weeks before voice recording was to begin with Bernadette Peters as Betty, the head of MGM, Alan Ladd Jr., was replaced by Frank Mancuso, and the project was abandoned. On August 14, 2014, Simon Cowell&#x27;s Syco and Animal Logic announced they were developing a feature-length film based on the character.

=== Video game ===
* Betty Boop&#x27;s Double Shift (2007) developed and published by DSI Games.

===Stage musical===

A musical entitled &quot;Boop! The Musical&quot;, with music by David Foster, lyrics by Susan Birkenhead and book by Bob Martin, made its pre-Broadway debut at the CIBC Theatre in Chicago, Illinois, from November 19, 2023, to December 24, 2023. Direction and choreography are by Jerry Mitchell, and the musical starred Jasmine Amy Rogers as Betty Boop, with Faith Prince as Valentina, Ainsley Melham as Dwayne, Erich Bergen as Raymond, Stephen DeRosa as Grampy, Angelica Hale as Trisha and Anastacia McCleskey as Carol.

===Film cameo===
In the 1988 film &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;, Betty Boop was voiced one more time by Mae Questel before her death in 1998. The character appears in a scene with detective Eddie Valiant. At the end, she appears in the crowd with a group of other cartoon characters who all sing &quot;Smile, Darn Ya, Smile!&quot;.

==Marketing and merchandise==
Marketers rediscovered Betty Boop in the 1980s, and Betty Boop merchandise has far outdistanced her exposure in films, with many not aware of her cinematic origin. Much of this merchandise features the character in her popular, sexier form, and has become popular worldwide once again.

In 2010, Betty Boop became the official fantasy cheerleader for the upstart United Football League. She was featured in merchandise targeted towards the league&#x27;s female demographic.

As of 2021, international licensing company Global Icons has acquired the licensing rights to Betty Boop and other Fleischer Studios characters, thus ending Fleischer&#x27;s longtime relationship with King Features Syndicate. She still appears in merchandise and social media, appealing to a 21st-century audience, using slang from the social media website TikTok, and she has various hobbies. (cyclist, recycling, etc.)

Marking Betty Boop&#x27;s 55th birthday, in 1985 she made her first appearance as a Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade balloon. The balloon held more than of helium and was tall. The balloon did not finish the 1986 parade due to collapsing near Times Square. The balloon appeared again in 1987 then returned for occasional use in the 1990s.

==Legal issues==

===Helen Kane lawsuit===

In May 1932, Helen Kane filed a $250,000 infringement lawsuit against Fleischer Studios, Max Fleischer and Paramount Publix Corporation for the &quot;deliberate caricature&quot; that produced &quot;unfair competition&quot;, exploiting her personality and image. While Kane had risen to fame in the late 1920s as &quot;The Boop-Oop-a-Doop Girl&quot;, a star of stage, recordings, and films for Paramount, her career was nearing its end by 1931, and Paramount promoted the development of Betty Boop following Kane&#x27;s decline. The case was brought in New York in 1934. On April 19, Fleischer testified that Betty Boop purely was a product of his imagination and detailed by members of his staff.

Theatrical manager Lou Bolton testified that Kane had witnessed an African-American child performer, Baby Esther (Esther Jones), using a similar vocal style in an act at the Everglades Restaurant club in midtown Manhattan, in &quot;April or May 1928&quot;. Under cross-examination Bolton said that he had met with Kane at the club after Esther&#x27;s performance, but could not say when she had walked in. Bolton also stated that Paramount&#x27;s lawyers had paid him $200 to come to New York. Esther&#x27;s name was given in the trial as Esther Jones. (During the trial, Lou Bolton, who was Esther Jones&#x27; manager, also testified his belief that she was probably in Paris.) An early test sound-on-disc film (lost after the trial), was produced, which featured Esther performing in this style and introduced as evidence. In the film, Esther sings three songs that had earlier been popularized by Helen Kane – &quot;Don&#x27;t Be Like That&quot;, &quot;Is There Anything Wrong with That?&quot;, and &quot;Wa-da-da&quot; – which writer Mark Langer says &quot;was hardly proof that Helen Kane derived her singing style from Baby Esther&quot;.
Jazz studies scholar Robert O&#x27;Meally stated this evidence, though, &quot;might very well have been cooked up by the Fleischers to discredit Kane, whom they later admitted to have been their model for Betty Boop.&quot; O&#x27;Meally also questioned if some sort of deal existed between Paramount and Bolton, and questioned if Esther were ever paid for her presumed loss of revenue.

New York Supreme Court Justice Edward J. McGoldrick ruled, &quot;The plaintiff has failed to sustain either cause of action by proof of sufficient probative force&quot;. In his opinion, based on the totality of the evidence presented in the trial, the &quot;baby&quot; technique of singing did not originate with Kane. No confirmed recordings of Jones are known to exist.

Under current US copyright law, Betty Boop is due to enter the public domain on January 1st, 2026. Later versions of her character will enter the public domain in the years that they become eligible.

===Lawsuits and recent ownership===

Ownership of the &quot;Boop&quot; cartoons has changed hands over the intervening decades due to a series of corporate mergers, acquisitions, and divestitures. In 1954 Paramount Pictures sold the TV rights to UM&amp;M TV Corp, Paramount was selling off all of their library to pay off debts. UM&amp;M TV Corp. went bankrupt before ever distributing the films, they only got as far as modifying the original masters with their TV titles. In 1955 National Telefilm Associates purchased all of the licenses &amp; films owned by UM&amp;M TV Corp. and made 16mm prints to distribute to TV stations. In 1985 NTA changed their name to Republic Pictures since much of their feature film library was old Republic movies. Aaron Spelling Productions absorbed the new Republic Pictures in 1994 and shortly after was acquired by Viacom, which also acquired Paramount Pictures. Then in 2006 Viacom made a corporate split into two separate companies: CBS Corporation and Paramount Pictures (the original distributor). As of 2021, Olive Films (under license from Paramount) holds home video rights and Trifecta retains television rights.

The rights to the &quot;Betty Boop&quot; character were not sold with the cartoons by Paramount, but were transferred to Harvey Comics in 1958 along with the &#x27;Famous Studios&#x27; cartoon characters (Casper, Herman &amp; Katnip, Baby Huey, etc.), regardless of whether they had the rights to transfer Betty Boop, according to a 2011 US Court verdict. The courts, however, were unable to come to a majority decision concerning ownership of the copyright. A trademark on the name (but not legitimately the likeness) of Betty Boop is owned by Fleischer Studios, for which the character was created in the 1930s, but which was unable to claim copyright infringement in a 2008 district court case; the merchandising rights to Betty&#x27;s name were licensed to King Features Syndicate, until 2021 but since then are licensed to Global Icons Inc.

==Legacy and revivals==
Betty Boop&#x27;s popularity has continued into popular culture. In the &quot;Green Acres&quot; episode &quot;School Days&quot;, Oliver quips that Lisa &quot;has a lot of Betty Boop in her&quot;. In &quot;Drawn Together&quot;, Betty is the inspiration for Toot Braunstein. Rapper Betty Boo based her voice and image on Betty Boop. The 1933 &quot;Betty Boop&quot; cartoon &quot;Snow-White&quot; (not to be confused with &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;) was selected for preservation by the U.S. Library of Congress in the National Film Registry in 1994. Betty appears in the Ink and Paint club scene in &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;. Betty is parodied in the &quot;Animaniacs&quot; episode &quot;Girl with the Googily Goop&quot;, with the Boop character called &quot;Googi Goop&quot;. The episode, made predominantly in black and white, is also a parody of &quot;Little Red Riding Hood&quot;. Googi was voiced by one-time Betty Boop voice actress Desirée Goyette. Beatress Johnson, a character in &quot;American Mary&quot;, has had extensive plastic surgery to resemble Betty Boop. Betty Boop appeared with model Daria Werbowy in a commercial for Lancôme&#x27;s Hypnôse Star Mascara, directed by Joann Sfar. In March, 2017, Betty appeared with fashion designer Zac Posen in an animated promotional short produced by King Features Syndicate, Fleischer Studios (its subsidiary) and Pantone.

In April 2011, Funny or Die parodied the character in a trailer spoof for a film called &quot;Boop&quot;, with Rose McGowan as Betty.

Betty Boop is a central character in the satirical parody webcomic &quot;Mr. Boop&quot;. The comic centers on the relationship between Betty and a fictionalized version of the webcomic&#x27;s creator who is married to Betty. The comic was nominated for an Ignatz Award. Betty can be seen at meet-and-greets at the Orlando Universal Studios theme park.

==Accolades==
* In 2002, Betty was voted in &quot;TV Guide&quot;″s 50 greatest cartoon characters of all time, ranking #17.
* In 2004, Betty Boop was voted among the &quot;100 Greatest Cartoons&quot; in a poll conducted by the British television channel Channel 4, ranking at #96.
* In March 2009, a UK newspaper voted Betty Boop the second sexiest cartoon character of all time, with Jessica Rabbit in first place and the Cadbury&#x27;s Caramel Bunny in third.
* In August 2010, the inaugural Betty Boop Festival was held in the city of Wisconsin Rapids, Wisconsin, and the third Festival was held in May 2012.

<doc id="203203" wikidata="Q146113" url="?curid=203203" title="Piano Sonata No. 8 (Beethoven)">
<text>Ludwig van Beethoven&#x27;s Piano Sonata No. 8 in C minor, Op. 13, commonly known as , was written in 1798 when the composer was 27 years old and was published in 1799. It has remained one of his most celebrated compositions. Beethoven dedicated the work to his friend Prince Karl von Lichnowsky. Although commonly thought to be one of the few works to be named by the composer himself, it was actually named &quot;&quot; (to Beethoven&#x27;s liking) by the publisher, who was impressed by the sonata&#x27;s tragic sonorities.

== Movements ==

In its entirety, encompassing all three movements, the work takes approximately 18-20 minutes to perform.

The sonata consists of three movements:
=== &quot;Grave – Allegro di molto e con brio&quot; ===
The first movement is in sonata form. It begins with a slow introductory theme, marked &quot;Grave&quot;. 
The exposition, marked &quot;Allegro di molto con brio&quot;, is in time (alla breve) in the home key of C minor and features three themes. Theme 1 features an aggressive rocket theme covering two octaves, accompanied with constant tremolo octaves in the left hand. 
Beethoven then makes use of unorthodox mode mixture, as he presents theme 2 in E minor rather than its customary parallel major. This theme is more lyrical than the first and makes use of grace notes and crossed hands. Theme 3 modulates to the mediant, E major, and features an Alberti-type figuration for the bass with tremolo. A codetta, with ideas from the opening allegro, closes the section. Some performers of the sonata include the introduction in the repeat of the exposition (Rudolf Serkin and András Schiff, for example), but most return to the beginning of the allegro section. This movement is one of the few compositions that contain hundred twenty-eighth notes.
The development section begins in the key of G minor but quickly modulates to E minor. In this section, Beethoven extends Haydn&#x27;s compositional practice by returning to the introductory section. After this reappearance of the &quot;Grave&quot;, the composer generates suspense with an extended dominant preparation.

The recapitulation brings back the themes of the exposition in different keys: themes 1 and 3 are played in the tonic key of C minor, then theme 2 is played in the unexpected key of F minor but then returns to the tonic key. The coda is very dramatic and includes a brief reminder of the &quot;Grave&quot; before ending with a swift cadence.

=== &quot;Adagio cantabile&quot; ===
This movement exemplifies the expressive &quot;Adagio&quot; style of many slow movements in the classical period. The famous &quot;cantabile&quot; melody is played three times, always in A major, separated by two modulating episodes; the movement is thus a simple rondo rather than the sonata form more common for movements of this seriousness. The first episode is set in F minor (the relative minor of A major), further modulating to E major before returning to the main theme. The second episode begins in A minor and modulates to E major. With the final return of the main theme, the accompaniment becomes richer and takes on the triplet rhythm of the second episode. There is a brief coda.

=== &quot;Rondo: Allegro&quot; ===
The sonata closes with a cut time movement in C minor. The main theme closely resembles the second theme of the &quot;Allegro&quot; of the first movement: its melodic pattern is identical for its first four notes, and its rhythmic pattern for the first eight. There is also a modified representation of the melody from the second movement, so it connects all three movements together. The movement&#x27;s sonata rondo form includes a brief coda. The three rondo episodes are in E major, A major, and C major. The common use of &quot;sforzando&quot; creates a forceful effect.

== Reactions of Beethoven&#x27;s contemporaries ==
The sonata &quot;Pathétique&quot; was an important success for Beethoven, selling well and helping create his reputation as a composer, not just as an extraordinary pianist. Not only was it instantly popular, it also exposed the world to the characteristics that Beethoven would continue to develop in the coming years.

When the pianist and composer Ignaz Moscheles discovered the work in 1804, he was ten years old; unable to afford to buy the music, he copied it out from a library copy. His music teacher, on being told about his discovery, &quot;warned me against playing or studying eccentric productions before I had developed a style based on more respectable models. Without paying heed to his instructions, however, I laid Beethoven&#x27;s works on the piano, in the order of their appearance, and found in them such consolation and pleasure as no other composer ever vouchsafed me.&quot;

Anton Schindler, a musician who was a friend of Beethoven in the composer&#x27;s later years, wrote: &quot;What the &quot;Sonate Pathétique&quot; was in the hands of Beethoven (although he left something to be desired as regards clean playing) was something that one had to have heard, and heard again, in order to be quite certain that it was the same already well-known work. Above all, every single thing became, in his hands, a new creation, wherein his always &quot;legato&quot; playing, one of the particular characteristics of his execution, formed an important part.&quot;

==Possible earlier influences==
Musicologists have speculated on whether the &quot;&quot; may have been inspired by Mozart&#x27;s piano sonata K. 457, since both compositions are in C minor and have three very similar movements. The second movement, &quot;Adagio cantabile&quot;, especially, makes use of a theme remarkably similar to one in the spacious second movement of Mozart&#x27;s sonata. 

Close similarities have also been noted with Bach&#x27;s Partita no. 2 in C minor. Both works open with a declamatory fanfare marked &quot;Grave&quot;, sharing a distinct combination of dotted rhythms, melodic contour, and texture. Furthermore, the first four notes of the Partita&#x27;s &quot;Andante&quot; (G–C–D–E, prominently repeated throughout the work) are found in the &quot;Pathétique&quot; as the first notes of important themes – first in the hand-crossing second subject of its first movement (initially transposed), then in the main theme of the &quot;Rondo&quot;. It is known that Beethoven was familiar with the works of Bach, having studied &quot;The Well-Tempered Clavier&quot; as a youth and returning to his predecessor&#x27;s compositional styles later in life.

== In popular culture ==
The work is widely familiar and has been adopted for appearance in many other contexts, especially works of popular culture.

*Lady Gaga used the opening theme in the intro to the music video for her 2011 song &quot;Marry the Night.&quot; 
*The &quot;cantabile&quot; theme from the second was used as the theme music for radio&#x27;s most widely listened-to classical music program, &quot;Adventures in Good Music&quot;, which aired nationally in the United States and in many other countries from 1970 to 2007. The theme was performed by Karl Haas, the program&#x27;s host.
*The full second movement is depicted as being performed by Schroeder in the movie &quot;A Boy Named Charlie Brown&quot;. (The actual performance is by Ingolf Dahl.)
*KISS quoted the sonata in &quot;Great Expectations&quot; from their 1976 album &quot;Destroyer&quot;. 
*Billy Joel used the theme as the chorus of his 1983 song &quot;This Night&quot;, 
*Louise Tucker used the theme in her Midnight Blue from 1982, which was a #1 hit in France.

<text>In mathematics, and more specifically in order theory, several different types of ordered set have been studied.
They include:
* Cyclic orders, orderings in which triples of elements are either clockwise or counterclockwise
* Lattices, partial orders in which each pair of elements has a greatest lower bound and a least upper bound. Many different types of lattice have been studied; see map of lattices for a list.
* Partially ordered sets (or &quot;posets&quot;), orderings in which some pairs are comparable and others might not be
* Preorders, a generalization of partial orders allowing ties (represented as equivalences and distinct from incomparabilities)
* Semiorders, partial orders determined by comparison of numerical values, in which values that are too close to each other are incomparable; a subfamily of partial orders with certain restrictions
* Total orders, orderings that specify, for every two distinct elements, which one is less than the other
* Weak orders, generalizations of total orders allowing ties (represented either as equivalences or, in strict weak orders, as transitive incomparabilities)
* Well-orders, total orders in which every non-empty subset has a least element
* Well-quasi-orderings, a class of preorders generalizing the well-orders

<text>Tom P. Brown (June 3, 1888 – March 25, 1958), sometimes known by the nickname Red Brown, was an American dixieland jazz trombonist. He also played string bass professionally.

== Early life ==
Brown was born in the Uptown neighborhood of New Orleans, Louisiana. His younger brother, Steve Brown, also became a prominent professional musician. 

== Career ==
Brown played trombone with the bands of Papa Jack Laine and Frank Christian; by 1910 usually worked leading bands under his own name. The band played in a style then locally known as &quot;hot ragtime&quot; or &quot;ratty music&quot;. In early 1915, his band was heard by Vaudeville dancer Joe Frisco who then arranged a job for Brown&#x27;s band in Chicago, Illinois.

On May 15, 1915, &#x27;Tom Brown&#x27;s Band from Dixieland&#x27; opened up at Lamb&#x27;s Cafe at Clark &amp; Randolph Streets in Chicago, with Ray Lopez, cornet and manager; Tom Brown, trombone and leader; Gussie Mueller clarinet, Arnold Loyacano piano and string bass; and Billy Lambert on drums. In Chicago Gussie Mueller was hired by bandleader Bert Kelly, and his place was taken by young New Orleans clarinetist Larry Shields.

This band seems to be the first to be popularly referred to as playing &quot;Jazz&quot;, or, as it was sometimes spelled early on, &quot;Jass.&quot;

Tom Brown&#x27;s Band enjoyed over four months of success in Chicago before moving to New York City, where it played for four months more before returning to New Orleans in February 1916. Upon arriving home Brown immediately started rounding up another band to go back to Chicago with him. The group again included Larry Shields; at the end of October, Brown agreed to switch clarinetists with the Original Dixieland Jass Band bringing Alcide Nunez into his band. Brown, Nunez and New Orleans drummer Ragbaby Stevens then went to work for Bert Kelly, who brought them to New York where they temporarily replaced the Original Dixieland Jass Band at Reisenweber&#x27;s in 1918. Brown started doing freelance recording work with New York dance and novelty bands, then joined the band of Harry Yerkes. At the start of 1920 he was joined in the Yerkes Band by Alcide Nunez.

Brown also played in vaudeville in the acts of Joe Frisco and Ed Wynn. 

In late-1921, he returned to Chicago and joined Ray Miller&#x27;s Black &amp; White Melody Boys, with whom he made more recordings. During this period, he also co-lead a dance band with his brother Steve.

In the mid-1920s, he returned home to New Orleans where he played with Johnny Bayersdorffer and Norman Brownlee&#x27;s bands, making a few recordings.

During the Great Depression, Borwn supplemented his income from music by repairing radios. He opened up a music shop and a junk shop on Magazine Street. He played string bass in local swing and dance bands. With the revival of interest in traditional jazz he played in various Dixieland bands in the 1950s, notably that of Johnny Wiggs. A local television station thought it would be a good idea to invite Brown and Nick LaRocca to talk about how jazz first spread north from New Orleans, but the show had scarcely started before the two old men got into an argument that turned into a fist-fight.

==Personal life==
Brown made his last recording just weeks before his death. He died in New Orleans.

<text>Hill Street Blues is an American serial police procedural television series that aired on NBC in prime-time from January 15, 1981, to May 12, 1987, for 146 episodes. The show chronicles the lives of the Metropolitan Police Department staff of a single police station located on Hill Street in an unnamed large U.S. city. The &quot;blues&quot; are the police officers in their blue uniforms. 

The show received critical acclaim, and its production innovations influenced many subsequent dramatic television series produced in the United States and Canada. In 1981, the series won eight Emmy Awards, a debut season record surpassed only by &quot;The West Wing&quot;, in 2000. The show won a total of 26 Emmy Awards (out of 98 Emmy Award nominations) during its run, including four consecutive wins for Outstanding Drama Series.

==Background==
MTM Enterprises developed the series on behalf of NBC, appointing Steven Bochco and Michael Kozoll as series writers. The writers were allowed the freedom to create a series that brought together a number of fresh ideas in TV drama. Each episode featured intertwined storylines, some of which were resolved within the episode, with others developing throughout a season. The conflicts between the work lives and private lives of the characters were also significant.

The series features a strong focus on the workplace struggle between what is right and what works. Television author John Javna described it as &quot;a cop show for the &quot;Big Chill&quot; generation, discovering that it takes all of their energy to keep even a few of their ideals alive while they struggle to succeed.&quot;

Almost every episode begins with a pre-credit sequence (or teaser) consisting of a briefing and roll call to start the day shift. From season three on, a &quot;Previously on...&quot; montage of clips of up to six episodes precedes the roll call. Author Steven Johnson wrote of the importance to viewers of each episode&#x27;s roll calls, saying that they &quot;performed a crucial function, introducing some of the primary threads and providing helpful contextual explanations for them.&quot; Also, almost all episodes take place over the course of a single day, many concluding with Captain Frank Furillo (Daniel J. Travanti) and public defender Joyce Davenport (Veronica Hamel) in a domestic situation, often in bed, discussing how their respective days went. The series deals with real-life issues and employs professional jargon and slang to a greater extent than had been seen before on television.

Each week after roll call, from Season 1 until Michael Conrad&#x27;s death partway through Season 4, Sergeant Phil Esterhaus says, &quot;Let&#x27;s be careful out there.&quot; Sergeant Lucy Bates continues the tradition through the end of Season 4, as a tribute to Conrad. From Season 5 until most of Season 6, Sergeant Stan Jablonski concludes his roll calls with, &quot;Let&#x27;s go out there and do it to them before they do it to us.&quot; At one point, at the suggestion of Detective Mayo, Jablonski softens, this to &quot;Let&#x27;s do our job before they do theirs.&quot; From then on, the show changed directions and conclusions (and even roll calls) were dropped.

==Production==
&quot;Hill Street Blues&quot; employed what was, at that time, a unique style of camera usage for weeknight television productions, such as filming close in with action cuts rapidly between stories. Rather than studio (floor) cameras, handhelds were used to enhance this style. 
Overheard, off-screen dialogue aurally augmented the &quot;documentary&quot; feel with respect to the filmed action of a scene.

Although primarily filmed in Los Angeles (both on location and at CBS Studio Center in Studio City), the series is set in a generic unnamed inner-city location with a feel of a U.S. urban center in the Midwest or Northeast. Bochco reportedly intended this fictional city to be a hybrid of Chicago, Buffalo, and Pittsburgh. The show&#x27;s opening and closing and cut-scenes were filmed in Chicago.

The program&#x27;s focus on failure and those at the bottom of the social scale is pronounced, in contrast to Bochco&#x27;s later project &quot;L.A. Law&quot;. Inspired by police procedural detective novels such as Ed McBain&#x27;s 1956 &quot;Cop Hater&quot;, the show has been described as &quot;Barney Miller&quot; out of doors. The focus on the bitter realities of 1980s urban living was revolutionary for its time.

The theme music for &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot; was written by Mike Post, featuring Larry Carlton on guitar. It was released as a single and became a major US hit, reaching #10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in November 1981, winning the Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Performance.

==Seasons==
Pilot: Brandon Tartikoff commissioned a series from MTM Productions, which assigned Bochco and Kozoll to the project. The pilot was produced in 1980, but was held back as a mid-season replacement so as not to get lost among the other programs debuting in the fall of 1980. Barbara Bosson, who was married to Bochco, had the idea to fashion the series into four- or five-episode story &quot;arcs&quot;. Robert Butler directed the pilot and developed a look and style inspired by the 1977 documentary &quot;The Police Tapes&quot;, in which filmmakers used handheld cameras to follow police officers in the South Bronx.

Season 1: The pilot aired on Thursday, January 15, 1981, at 10:00 pm, which would be the show&#x27;s time slot for nearly its entire run. The second episode aired two nights later; the next week followed a similar pattern (episode 3 on Thursday, episode 4 on Saturday). NBC had ordered 13 episodes and the season was supposed to end on May 25 with a minor cliffhanger (the resolution of Sgt. Esterhaus&#x27; wedding). Instead, growing critical acclaim prompted NBC to order an additional four episodes to air during the May sweeps. Bochco and Kozoll quickly fashioned this into a new story arc, which aired as two two-hour episodes to close the season. In the first season&#x27;s original ending, Officer Joe Coffey (Ed Marinaro) is shot dead during a vehicle stop. However, later on the producers decided that Coffey should remain, so the scene was edited to show him being seriously wounded and taken to a hospital. (The character would eventually be killed in the sixth season.) This echoes the shooting and resurrection of Renko and Hill at the beginning of the season, providing unintentional thematic bookends to the first season.

In early episodes, the opening theme had several clearly audible edits; this was replaced by a longer, unedited version partway through the second season. The end credits for the pilot differed from the rest of the series in that the background still shot of the station house was completely different. Ranking 87th out of 96 shows, it became the lowest-rated program ever renewed for a second season at the time. However, it was only renewed for ten episodes. A full order was picked up partway through the season.

Season 2: A writers strike pushed the start of the season forward to October 29, meaning that only 18 episodes were completed that year. Kozoll was now listed as a consultant, signifying his diminished role in the show. He later stated he was already feeling burnt out, and in fact was relying more on car chases and action to fill the scripts. A less muted version of the closing theme was played over the end credits.

Season 3: Kozoll left the show at the end of season two, replaced for the most part by Anthony Yerkovich (who later created &quot;Miami Vice&quot; after leaving &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot; at the end of this season) and David Milch. This was the show&#x27;s most popular season in terms of viewership, as it finished at #21. This was also the birth of &quot;Must See TV&quot;, as the show was joined by &quot;Cheers&quot;, &quot;Taxi&quot; and &quot;Fame&quot;. The network promoted Thursdays as &quot;the best night of television on television.&quot; Michael Conrad was increasingly absent from the show due to his ongoing, and ultimately unsuccessful, battle with cancer.

Season 4: Following his death on November 22, 1983, Michael Conrad&#x27;s final appearance was broadcast halfway through the season in February 1984 in a memorable send-off episode, &quot;Grace Under Pressure&quot;. Det. Harry Garibaldi (Ken Olin) was introduced at the end of the season as a temporary replacement for Det. J.D. LaRue (Kiel Martin) who was supposedly suffering from mononucleosis. The show won its fourth and final Emmy for Outstanding Drama Series this season.

Season 5: The show changed drastically this season, entering a somewhat &quot;soap opera-ish&quot; period according to Bochco. New characters included Sgt. Stanislaus Jablonski (Robert Prosky) and Det. Patsy Mayo (Mimi Kuzyk). Det. Garibaldi was now a regular, while Fay Furillo became a full-time member of the squad room as a victim&#x27;s advocate. Bochco was dismissed at season&#x27;s end by then-MTM President Arthur Price. The firing was due to Bochco&#x27;s cost overruns, coupled with the fact that the show had achieved the 100-episode milestone needed to successfully syndicate it.

Betty Thomas won an Emmy for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series this season. However, at the awards ceremony, Barry Bremen, aka &quot;The Great Imposter&quot;, rushed the stage ahead of Thomas and claimed she was unable to attend. He then claimed the award and left the stage, confusing viewers and robbing Thomas of her moment in the sun, although she returned and spoke after the ad break. Presenter Peter Graves suggested that the imposter was &quot;on his way to the cooler.&quot;

Season 6: Major changes occurred as Det. Mayo, Det. Garibaldi, Lt. Ray Calletano (René Enríquez), Fay Furillo (Barbara Bosson) and Officer Leo Schnitz (Robert Hirschfeld) were all phased out at the start of the season, and Joe Coffey left near the end. The sole addition was Lt. Norman Buntz, played by Dennis Franz, who had played a different character, the corrupt &quot;bad guy&quot; Detective Sal Benedetto, in several season 3 episodes. Buntz and Benedetto were doppelgängers. Peter Jurasik played a new recurring character (&quot;Sid the Snitch&quot;), who often teamed with Buntz. In a 1992 interview on &quot;Later with Bob Costas&quot;, Ken Olin claimed these characters were removed so the new show-runners would receive royalties. Bosson&#x27;s departure, however, was voluntary. She left after a salary conflict with the new executive producer who, according to the actress, had also wanted her character, Fay, to go back to being a shrewish &quot;thorn in her ex-husband&#x27;s side&quot;.

The season premiere opened with a roll call filled with officers never before seen on the show, briefly fooling viewers into thinking the entire cast had been replaced. It was then revealed that this was, in fact, the night shift. The action then cut to the day shift pursuing their after-work activities. Another unique episode from this season explained through flashbacks how Furillo and Davenport met and fell in love. This was the first season that Travanti and Hamel were not nominated for the Emmy for Outstanding Lead Actor/Actress in a Drama Series.

Season 7: Up until now, each episode of the series started with the morning roll call. Episodes from season 7 break away from tradition, showing characters at home or working. The roll call becomes a minor part of the beginning. Some episodes do not show roll call at all.

Officer Patrick Flaherty (Robert Clohessy) and Officer Tina Russo (Megan Gallagher) joined this season in an attempt to rekindle the Bates/Coffey relationship of years past. Stan Jablonski became a secondary character part way through this season, and when Travanti announced he would not return the next year, the producers decided to end the show in 1987. The program was also moved to Tuesday nights almost midway through the season after nearly six years to make way for &quot;L.A. Law&quot; on Thursdays. During this season the show featured the first lesbian recurring character on a major network; the character was police officer Kate McBride, played by Lindsay Crouse.

This was the only season that Bruce Weitz (Det. Mick Belker) was not nominated for the Emmy for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series. Only Betty Thomas was nominated, making her the sole member of the cast to be nominated in all seasons. This was the only season for which the show was not nominated for Outstanding Drama Series.

===Broadcast history and Nielsen ratings===
Years after the show had run, Daniel J. Travanti commented: &quot;NBC tried their best to get rid of us, and heaven knows why. They did their best to destroy us and only ordered 13 episodes — that&#x27;s how confident they weren&#x27;t. And when did they put us on the air? January 15, 17, 22 and 24. That&#x27;s disgustingly destructive, stupid and idiotic. There aren&#x27;t words strong enough. You put us on the air for four episodes that are thrown away in nine days? People barely saw us. What the fuck was that? Everyone was up in arms and screaming at NBC, and NBC was screaming at them. If they had dumped &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot;, they would&#x27;ve been called the idiots of all time. Their being in that weak position worked in our favor – but also threatened us all the time.&quot;


The series later aired in reruns on TV Land, Bravo, AmericanLife TV, and NuvoTV. It ran for several years, from September 2015, on the Heroes &amp; Icons network. The entire series could previously be viewed on Hulu and Amazon Prime Video. Season three can be viewed as streaming video on commercial sites and is also available in many countries from Channel 4 on YouTube.

==Setting==

Series producers deliberately left the exact city in which the series was set vague and a variety of methods are employed to imply different general locations. The call letters of local TV stations were usually obscured to avoid showing whether they began with &quot;W&quot; (the Federal Communications Commission designation for stations east of the Mississippi River) or &quot;K&quot; (signifying a station west of the Mississippi River). An episode in season three specifically mentions a radio station of WDPD, suggesting a city east of the Mississippi. However, in bar scenes throughout the series, characters are frequently shown drinking bottles of beer that strongly resemble Coors Beer. Coors did not obtain national distribution until 1986, and as a result of national distribution laws was not available east of the Mississippi until that year, implying the location is west of the Mississippi.

Though most of the series&#x27; scenes were filmed in Los Angeles (on location and at CBS Studio Center in Studio City), the series&#x27; introduction shows exterior shots entirely of Chicago and cutaway shots from Chicago were used in production, with police cars resembling the color schemes of Chicago Police Department patrol vehicles. Chicago&#x27;s 7th District Police Station is frequently shown in cutaway shots and also during the closing credits. This station was closed by the Chicago Police in 1998 and later repurposed as the headquarters for the University of Illinois at Chicago police.

The first episode of season three shows both a TV camera labeled &quot;WREQ&quot;, and a shot of a Regional Transportation Authority suburban train arriving at the Chicago and North Western Terminal. However, in the penultimate episode of season 2, a street sign for Los Angeles Street – a thoroughfare in downtown Los Angeles – is visible outside the fictitious Hotel Doane.

There are several mentions through the series of characters going down to &quot;the shore&quot;, which implies a lake or oceanfront setting. One indication of setting within the show was given by the Southern-accented character Officer Andy Renko when he stated in the season one episode &quot;Politics as Usual&quot;: &quot;Just drop that cowboy stuff. I was born in New Jersey, never been west of Chicago in my life&quot;, as if to imply that they were in Chicago. In Season 1 episode 12, Captain Furillo informs Lieutenant Hunter that the armored vehicle he was test driving has been found &quot;in the East River&quot;, implying New York City. In Season 2, Episode 3, Sergeant Esterhaus references guarding &quot;the national guard armory in Newark&quot;, implying a location in or near New Jersey. Season 2 episode 18 shows an elevated subway train on which the transit agency &quot;CTA&quot; can clearly be seen, suggesting Chicago. Throughout the series, characters occasionally mention well-known Chicago street names, such as Michigan Avenue, or other Chicago-related landmarks, such as the Blue Line subway and Mercy Hospital. Both of the characters played by Dennis Franz employ a heavy Chicago-type accent, also employed by Dan Aykroyd in &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot;, a motion picture set and filmed in Chicago.

In a Season 5 episode, during an undercover detail, Detective Belker is knocked unconscious by a criminal and stashed in the luggage compartment of an interstate bus. A package labeled &quot;Springfield ILL&quot; (using the old three-letter Postal Service state abbreviation) is next to him. When he is finally freed from the compartment and told he is in Springfield, it is still daytime and after he rides a bus back to his origin, it is now early evening and the other detective at his detail is not alarmed when Belker explains his absence as &quot;following a tail&quot;, implying the distance was not very great (Springfield is roughly a three-hour drive from Chicago via I-55).

The show also contains a few references to locations in Buffalo. In one episode, Lt. Hunter talks about needing to get rid of tickets for the &quot;Sabres.&quot; Buffalo place names mentioned on the show include the Kubiak Lodge, Ganson St. and the canals, Gabriel&#x27;s Gate bar, Decker St. and West Utica St. 
Show writer Steven Bochco attended college at the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University) in Pittsburgh. The run-down, shabby, drug-ridden impression of Pittsburgh&#x27;s Hill District that Bochco acquired was apparently part of the inspiration for the show. He intended the setting to resemble several cities, including Chicago, New York, Pittsburgh and Buffalo.

Although the city is never named, the Illinois state flag is visible over the judge&#x27;s left shoulder in the courtroom scenes in the Season 2 episode &quot;Fruits of the Poisonous Tree,&quot; suggesting that the location is Chicago. Some outdoor scenes, particularly in the first two seasons, capture palm trees and other Southern California flora not found in the Midwest or Northeastern United States.

While most vehicles sport generic, stateless license plates, 1980s-era California license plates are easily spotted on many large trucks used on set.

==Title==
&quot;Hill Street Blues&quot; refers to the blue uniforms worn by many police officers in the United States and, by extension, the depressing nature of inner-city police work. The phrase is uttered only once in the series, apart from introductions such as &quot;Previously on &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot;.&quot; It is spoken by Detective Emil Schneider (Dolph Sweet) in the first-season episode &quot;Gator Bait.&quot; Schneider says it in a slightly mocking tone, in reference to officers Hill and Renko, who he feels are out of their league at a particular crime scene.

The precinct bowling team is the &quot;Hill Street Blue Ballers.&quot;

==Critical reception==
Initially, &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot; received rave reviews from critics but had dismal Nielsen ratings. Early schedule switching did not help; the show was broadcast once weekly on four different nights during its first season alone but gradually settled into a Thursday night time slot. The NBC Broadcast Standards Unit deemed it &quot;too violent, too sexy, too grim.&quot; The producers described the show as &quot;an hour drama with 13 continuing characters living through a Gordian knot of personal and professional relationships.&quot; In a May 1981 review, John J. O&#x27;Connor charted the show&#x27;s growing popularity and called it &quot;a comfortable balance between comedy and drama.&quot;

The choice to include African-Americans as mainstays in the core ensemble cast and to feature several interracial and interethnic cop partnerships drew notice and praise, as did the overlapping plots and examinations of moral conundrums such as police corruption, racism, alcoholism and both interpersonal and institutional forgiveness.
The show was very influential, with many others imitating its use of handheld cameras, ensemble casts, and multiple overlapping story lines lasting for several episodes, set in urban decay. Alan Sepinwall wrote in 2014 that it &quot;is on the short list of the most influential TV shows ever made. Whether through shared actors, writers, directors or through stylistic and thematic complexity, its DNA can be found in nearly every great drama produced in the 30-plus years since it debuted.&quot; He compared &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot; to &quot;Casablanca&quot;, which was so influential on other films that &quot;if you come to see it for the first time after a lifetime of watching the copies, it could be at risk of playing like a bundle of clichés—even though it invented those clichés.&quot;

In 1993, &quot;TV Guide&quot; named the series its All-Time Best Cop Show in an issue celebrating 40 years of television. In 1997, the episode &quot;Grace Under Pressure&quot; was ranked number 49 on &quot;TV Guide&quot;″s 100 Greatest Episodes of All Time. When the list was revised in 2009, &quot;Freedom&#x27;s Last Stand&quot; was ranked number 57. In 1998, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; named it in the top 20 television shows of all time, saying it &quot;...took the cop show and turned it upside down&quot;. In 2002, &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot; ranked number 14 on &quot;TV Guide&quot;″s 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time, and in 2013 &quot;TV Guide&quot; ranked it #1 in its list of the 60 Greatest Dramas of All Time and #23 of the 60 Best Series. Also in 2013, the Writers Guild of America ranked it #15 on their list of the 101 Best Written TV Series.

== Spinoff ==
===&quot;Beverly Hills Buntz&quot;===

&quot;Beverly Hills Buntz&quot; aired on NBC from November 5, 1987, to April 22, 1988. It was a half-hour comedy, a hybrid between light private eye fare and a sitcom. Main character Norman Buntz (Dennis Franz) quits Hill Street, moves to Beverly Hills with Sid &quot;The Snitch&quot; Thurston (Peter Jurasik) and becomes a private investigator. Thirteen episodes were filmed, though only nine were broadcast.

== In popular culture ==
&quot;Hill Street Blues&quot; has inspired parodies, storylines, characters, and cultural references in numerous media vehicles.

*&quot;Second City Television&quot; - In 1981, the Canadian comedy series SCTV created a parody skit, &#x27;The Benny Hill Street Blues,&#x27; a cross between The Benny Hill Show and Hill Street Blues. 
*&quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;The Springfield Connection&quot; (S6E23), in which Marge becomes a cop, uses and ends with a mix of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; and &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot; themes.
*&quot;Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends&quot; episode &quot;The X-Men Adventure&quot; (S3E7), in which Spider-Man says to the heroes who are about to separate to search for Cyberiad, &quot;Let&#x27;s be careful out there.&quot;
*Issue 60 of &quot;Firestorm&quot;, published by DC Comics in 1987, featured thinly veiled references to &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot; characters in a story taking place in a police precinct.
* Southern rock band 38 Special&#x27;s music video for &quot;Back Where You Belong&quot; stars the band members as bumbling plainclothes police officers pursuing a female suspect. An affectionate homage to &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot;, the video begins with a morning rollcall scene in which a police sergeant implores the band members to &quot;be extra careful out there today.&quot;
* Black Flag mentions the show in their song &quot;TV Party&quot; on their satirical eponymous EP &quot;TV Party&quot;.

===Video game===
In 1991, Krisalis Software released the video game &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot; for Amiga, Atari ST and MS-DOS. It puts the player in charge of Hill Street Station and its surrounding neighborhood with the aim of promptly dispatching officers to reported crimes, apprehending criminals, and making them testify at court. If certain areas have less serious crimes unresolved, such as bag snatching, they soon escalate to more serious ones, such as murder in broad daylight. The game received mixed reviews.

<text>In meteoritics, a meteorite classification system attempts to group similar meteorites and allows scientists to communicate with a standardized terminology when discussing them. Meteorites are classified according to a variety of characteristics, especially mineralogical, petrological, chemical, and isotopic properties.
==Terminology==
There is no single, standardized terminology used in meteorite classification; however, commonly used terms for categories include &quot;types&quot;, &quot;classes&quot;, &quot;clans&quot;, &quot;groups&quot;, and &quot;subgroups&quot;. Some researchers hierarchize these terms, but there is no consensus as to which hierarchy is most appropriate. Meteorites that do not fit any known group (though they may fit somewhere within a higher level of classification) are &quot;ungrouped&quot;.

==Genetic relationships==
Meteorite classification may indicate that a &quot;genetic&quot; relationship exists between similar meteorite specimens. Similarly classified meteorites may share a common origin, and therefore may come from the same astronomical object (such as a planet, asteroid, or moon) known as a &quot;parent body&quot;. However, with current scientific knowledge, these types of relationships between meteorites are difficult to prove.

==Traditional classification scheme==
Meteorites are often divided into three overall categories based on whether they are dominantly composed of rocky material (stony meteorites), metallic material (iron meteorites), or mixtures (stony–iron meteorites). These categories have been in use since at least the early 19th century but do not have much genetic significance; they are simply a traditional and convenient way of grouping specimens. In fact, the term &quot;stony iron&quot; is a misnomer as currently used. One group of chondrites (CB) has over 50% metal by volume and contains meteorites that were called stony irons until their affinities with chondrites were recognized. Some iron meteorites also contain many silicate inclusions but are rarely described as stony irons.

Nevertheless, these three categories sit at the top of the most widely used meteorite classification system. Stony meteorites are then traditionally divided into two other categories: chondrites (groups of meteorites that have undergone little change since their parent bodies originally formed and are characterized by the presence of chondrules), and achondrites (groups of meteorites that have a complex origin involving asteroidal or planetary differentiation). The iron meteorites were traditionally divided into objects with similar internal structures (octahedrites, hexahedrites, and ataxites), but these terms are now used for purely descriptive purposes and have given way to modern chemical groups. Stony–iron meteorites have always been divided into pallasites (which are now known to comprise several distinct groups) and mesosiderites (a textural term that is also synonymous with the name of a modern group).

Below is a representation of how the meteorite groups fit into the more traditional classification hierarchy: 

* Chondrites
** Carbonaceous chondrite class
*** CI chondrites (Ivuna-like) group
*** CM-CO chondrite (mini-chondrule) clan
**** CM chondrite (Mighei-like) group
**** CO chondrite (Ornans-like) group
*** CV-CK chondrite clan
**** CV chondrite (Vigarano-like) group
***** CV-oxA chondrite (oxidized, Allende-like) subgroup
***** CV-oxB chondrite (oxidized, Bali-like) subgroup
***** CV-red chondrite (reduced) subgroup
**** CK chondrite (Karoonda-like) group
*** CR chondrite clan
**** CR chondrite (Renazzo-like) group
**** CH chondrite (Allan Hills 85085-like) group

***** CBb chondrite subgroup
** Ordinary chondrite class
*** H chondrite group
*** L chondrite group
*** LL chondrite group
** Enstatite chondrite class
*** EH chondrite group
*** EL chondrite group
**Other chondrite groups, not in one of the major classes

*** K chondrite (Kakangari-like) grouplet (a grouplet is a provisional group with &lt;5 members)
* Achondrites
** Primitive achondrites
*** Acapulcoite group
*** Lodranite group
*** Winonaite group
** Asteroidal achondrites
*** HED meteorite clan (possibly from asteroid 4 Vesta, also called basaltic achondrites)
**** Howardite group
**** Eucrite group
**** Diogenite group
*** Angrite group
*** Aubrite group (enstatite achondrites)
*** Ureilite group
*** Brachinite group
** Lunar meteorite group
** Martian meteorite group (sometimes called &quot;SNC meteorites&quot;)

** IIG iron meteorite group
** IIIAB iron meteorite group
** IIIE iron meteorite group
** IIIF iron meteorite group
** IVA iron meteorite group
** IVB iron meteorite group
* &quot;Non-magmatic&quot; or primitive iron meteorite groups
** IAB iron meteorite &quot;complex&quot; or clan (formerly groups IAB and IIICD)
*** IAB main group
*** Udei Station grouplet
*** Pitts grouplet
*** sLL (low Au, Low Ni) subgroup
*** sLM (low Au, Medium Ni) subgroup
*** sLH (low Au, high Ni) subgroup
*** sHL (high Au, Low Ni) subgroup
*** sHH (high Au, high Ni) subgroup
** IIE iron meteorite group

===Rubin classification===
A. E. Rubin (2000) classification scheme:

===Alternative schemes===
Two alternative general classification schemes were recently published, illustrating the lack of consensus on how to classify meteorites beyond the level of groups. In the Krot et al. scheme (2003) the following hierarchy is used:

* Chondrites
* Nonchondrites
** Primitive
** Differentiated
*** Achondrites
*** Stony irons
*** Irons

In the Weisberg et al. (2006) scheme meteorites groups are arranged as follows:

* Chondrites
* Primitive achondrites
* Achondrites

where irons and stony–irons are considered to be achondrites or primitive achondrites, depending on the group.

==History==
Modern meteorite classification was worked out in the 1860s, based on Gustav Rose&#x27;s and Nevil Story Maskelyne&#x27;s classifications. Gustav Rose worked on the meteorite collection of the Museum für Naturkunde, Berlin and Maskelyne on the collection of the British Museum, London. Rose was the first to make different categories for meteorites with chondrules (chondrites) and without (nonchondrites). Story-Maskelyne differentiated between siderites, siderolites and aerolites (now called iron meteorites, stony-iron meteorites and stony meteorite, respectively).

In 1872 Gustav Tschermak published his first meteorite classification based on Gustav Rose&#x27;s catalog from 1864:

In 1883 Tschermak modified Rose&#x27;s classification again.

Further modifications were made by Aristides Brezina.

The first chemical classification was published by Oliver C. Farrington, 1907.

George Thurland Prior further improved the classification based on mineralogical and chemical data, introducing the terms mesosiderite, lodranite and enstatite chondrite. In 1923 he published a catalogue of the meteorites in the Natural History Museum (London). He describes his classification as based on Gustav Tschermak and Aristides Brezina with modifications by himself. His main subdivisions were:
# Meteoric Irons or Siderites
# Meteoric Stony-irons or Siderolites
# Meteoric Stones or Aerolites.
He subdivides the &quot;Meteoric Stones&quot; into those that have chondrules (Chondritic Meteoric Stones or Chondrites) and those that don&#x27;t (Non-chondritic Meteoric Stones or Achondrites). The iron meteorites are subdivided according to their structures as ataxites, hexahedrites and octahedrites. A complete overview of his classification is given in the box below:

Brian Harold Mason published a further revision in the 1960s.
