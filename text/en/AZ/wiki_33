<text>A sermon is a religious discourse or oration by a preacher, usually a member of clergy. Sermons address a scriptural, theological, or moral topic, usually expounding on a type of belief, law, or behavior within both past and present contexts. Elements of the sermon often include exposition, exhortation, and practical application. The act of delivering a sermon is called preaching. In secular usage, the word &quot;sermon&quot; may refer, often disparagingly, to a lecture on morals.

In Christian practice, a sermon is usually preached to a congregation in a place of worship, either from an elevated architectural feature, known as a pulpit or an ambo, or from behind a lectern. The word &quot;sermon&quot; comes from a Middle English word which was derived from Old French, which in turn originates from the Latin word meaning &#x27;discourse.&#x27; A &quot;sermonette&quot; is a short sermon (usually associated with television broadcasting, as stations would present a sermonette before signing off for the night). The Christian Bible contains many speeches without interlocution, which some take to be sermons: Jesus&#x27; Sermon on the Mount in Matthew 5–7 (though the gospel writers do not specifically call it a sermon; the popular descriptor for Jesus&#x27; speech there came much later); and Peter after Pentecost in Acts 2:14–40 (though this speech was delivered to non-Christians and as such is not quite parallel to the popular definition of a sermon).

In Islam, sermons are known as &quot;khutbah&quot;.

==Christianity==

In Christianity, a sermon is typically identified as an address or discourse delivered to a congregation of Christians, typically containing theological or moral instruction. The sermon by Christian orators was partly based on the tradition of public lectures by classical orators. Although it is often called a homily, the original distinction between a sermon and a homily was that a sermon was delivered by a clergyman (licensed preacher) while a homily was read from a printed copy by a layman. In the 20th century the distinction has become one of the sermon being likely to be longer, have more structure, and contain more theological content. Homilies are usually considered to be a type of sermon, usually narrative or biographical .

The word &quot;sermon&quot; is used contemporarily to describe many famous moments in Christian (and Jewish) history. The most famous example is the Sermon on the Mount by Jesus of Nazareth. This address was given around 30 AD, and is recounted in the Gospel of Matthew (, including introductory and concluding material) as being delivered on a mount on the north end of the Sea of Galilee, near Capernaum. It is also contained in some of the other gospel narratives.

During the later history of Christianity, several figures became known for their addresses that later became regarded as sermons. Examples in the early church include Peter (see especially Acts ), Stephen (see ), Tertullian and John Chrysostom. These addresses were used to spread Christianity across Europe and Asia Minor, and as such are not sermons in the modern sense, but evangelistic messages.

The sermon has been an important part of Christian services since early Christianity, and remains prominent in both Roman Catholicism and Protestantism. Lay preachers sometimes figure in these traditions of worship, for example the Methodist local preachers, but in general preaching has usually been a function of the clergy. The Dominican Order is officially known as the &quot;Order of Preachers&quot; ( in Latin); friars of this order were trained to publicly preach in vernacular languages, and the order was created by Saint Dominic to preach to the Cathars of southern France in the early 13th century. The Franciscans are another important preaching order; Travelling preachers, usually friars, were an important feature of late medieval Catholicism. In 1448 the church authorities seated at Angers prohibited open-air preaching in France. If a sermon is delivered during the Mass it comes after the Gospel is sung or read. If it is delivered by the priest or bishop that offers the Mass then he removes his maniple, and in some cases his chasuble, because the sermon is not part of the Mass. A bishop preaches his sermon wearing his mitre while seated whereas a priest, or on rare occasions a deacon, preaches standing and wearing his biretta. 

In most denominations, modern preaching is kept below forty minutes, but historic preachers of all denominations could at times speak for several hours, and use techniques of rhetoric and theatre that are today somewhat out of fashion in mainline churches.

During the Middle Ages, sermons inspired the beginnings of new religious institutes (e.g., Saint Dominic and Francis of Assisi). Pope Urban II began the First Crusade in November 1095 at the Council of Clermont, France, when he exhorted French knights to retake the Holy Land.

The academic study of sermons, the analysis and classification of their preparation, composition and delivery, is called homiletics.

A controversial issue that aroused strong feelings in early modern Britain was whether sermons should be read from a fully prepared text, or extemporized, perhaps from some notes. Many sermons have been written down, collected and published; published sermons were a major and profitable literary form, and category of books in the book trade, from at least the Late Antique Church to about the late 19th century. Many clergymen openly recycled large chunks of published sermons in their own preaching. Such sermons include John Wesley&#x27;s &quot;Forty-four Sermons&quot;, John Chrysostom&#x27;s &quot;Homily on the Resurrection&quot; (preached every Easter in Orthodox churches) and Gregory Nazianzus&#x27; homily &quot;On the Theophany, or Birthday of Christ&quot; (preached every Christmas in Orthodox churches). The 80 sermons in German of the Dominican Johannes Tauler (1300–1361) were read for centuries after his death.
Martin Luther published his sermons (&quot;Hauspostille&quot;) on the Sunday lessons for the edification of readers. This tradition was continued by Martin Chemnitz and Johann Arndt, as well as many others into the following centuries—for example CH Spurgeon&#x27;s stenographed sermons, &quot;The Metropolitan Tabernacle Pulpit&quot;. The widow of Archbishop of Canterbury John Tillotson (1630–1694) received £2,500 for the manuscripts of his sermons, a very large sum.

===Lutheranism and Reformed Christianity===

The Reformation led to Protestant sermons, many of which defended the schism with the Roman Catholic Church and explained beliefs about the Bible, theology, and devotion. The distinctive doctrines of Protestantism held that salvation was by faith alone, and convincing people to believe the Gospel and place trust in God for their salvation through Jesus Christ was the decisive step in salvation.

In many Protestant churches, the sermon came to replace the Eucharist as the central act of Christian worship (although some Protestants such as Lutherans give equal time to a sermon and the Eucharist in their Divine Service). While Luther retained the use of the lectionary for selecting texts for preaching, the Swiss Reformers, such as Ulrich Zwingli, Johannes Oecolampadius, and John Calvin, notably returned to the patristic model of preaching through books of the Bible. The goal of Protestant worship, as conditioned by these reforms, was above all to offer glory to God for the gift of grace in Jesus Christ, to rouse the congregation to a deeper faith, and to inspire them to practice works of love for the benefit of the neighbor, rather than carry on with potentially empty rituals.

=== Evangelical Christianity ===
In the 18th and 19th centuries during the Great Awakening, major (evangelistic) sermons were made at revivals, which were especially popular in the United States. These sermons were noted for their &quot;fire-and-brimstone&quot; message, typified by Jonathan Edwards&#x27; famous &quot;Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God&quot; speech. In these sermons the wrath of God was intended to be made evident. Edwards also preached on &quot;Religious Affections&quot;, which discussed the divided Christian world.

In Evangelical Christianity, the sermon is often called the &quot;message&quot;. It occupies an important place in worship service, half the time, about 45 to 60 minutes. This message can be supported by a powerpoint, images and videos. In some churches, messages are grouped into thematic series. The one who brings the message is usually a pastor trained either in a bible college or independently. Evangelical sermons are broadcast on the radio, on television channels (televangelism), on the Internet, on web portals, on the website of the churches and through social media like YouTube and Facebook. 

=== Roman Catholic ===
Roman Catholic preaching has evolved over time but generally the subject matter is similar. As the famous St. Alphonsus Ligouri states, &quot;With regard to the subject matter of sermons. Those subjects should be selected which move most powerfully to detest sin and to love God; whence the preacher should often speak of the last things of death, of judgment, of Hell, of Heaven, and of eternity. According to the advice of the Holy Spirit, &#x27;Remember your last end, and you shall never sin.&#x27; (Eccl. vii. 40).&quot;

Among the most famous Catholic sermons are St. Francis of Assisi&#x27;s Sermon to the Birds, St. Alphonsus Liguori&#x27;s Italian , St. Robert Bellarmine&#x27;s sermons during the counter-reformation period in , the French by St. John Vianney and the of Ælfric of Eynsham.

==Islam==
&quot;Khutbah&quot; () serves as the primary formal occasion for public preaching in the Islamic tradition. In societies or communities with (for example) low literacy rates, strong habits of communal worship, and/or limited mass-media, the preaching of sermons throughout networks of congregations can have important informative and prescriptive propaganda functions
for both civil
and religious authorities—which may regulate the manner, frequency, licensing, personnel and content of preaching accordingly.

==Types==
There are a number of different types of sermons, that differ both in their subject matter and by their intended audience, and accordingly not every preacher is equally well-versed in every type. Some types of sermon include:

* Biographical sermons – tracing the story of a particular biblical character through a number of parts of the Bible.
* Evangelistic sermons (associated with the Greek word &quot;kerygma&quot;) – seeking to convert the hearers or bring them back to their previous faith through a recounting of the foundational story of the religion, in Christianity, the Good News. 
* Expository preaching – exegesis, that is sermons that expound and explain a text to the congregation.
*Fast sermons - Between January 1642 and April 1649, these were regular sermons preached in the English Parliament on the fourth Wednesday of every month.
* Historical sermons – which seek to portray a biblical story within its non-biblical historical perspective.
* Hortatory sermons (associated with the Greek word ) – exhort a return to living ethically, in Christianity a return to living on the basis of the gospel.
* Illuminative sermons, also known as proems () – which connect an apparently unrelated biblical verse or religious question with the current calendrical event or festival.
* Liturgical sermons – sermons that explain the liturgy, why certain things are done during a service, such as why communion is offered and what it means.
* Narrative sermons – which tell a story, often a parable, or a series of stories, to make a moral point.
* Redemptive-historical preaching – sermons that take into consideration the context of any given text within the broader history of salvation as recorded in the canon of the bible.
* Topical sermons – concerned with a particular subject of current concern;

Sermons can be both written and spoken out loud.

==Delivery methods==

Sermons also differ in the amount of time and effort used to prepare them. Some are scripted while others are not.

With the advent of reception theory, researchers also became aware that how sermons are listened to affects their meaning as much as how they are delivered. The expectations of the congregation, their prior experience of listening to oral texts, their level of scriptural education, and the relative social positions—often reflected in the physical arrangement—of sermon-goers vis-a-vis the preacher are part of the meaning of the sermon.

Albert Raboteau describes a common style of Black preaching first developed in America in the early 19th century, and common throughout the 20th and into the 21st centuries:

=== Impromptu preaching ===

&quot;Impromptu preaching&quot; is a sermon technique where the preacher exhorts the congregation without any previous preparation. It can be aided with a reading of a Bible passage, aleatory opened or not, or even without any scriptural reference.

The Bible says that the Holy Spirit gives disciples the inspiration to speak:&lt;BR&gt;
Matthew 10:16-20&lt;BR&gt;
According to some people, when Jesus says &quot;take no thought how or what ye shall speak&quot; he is saying that it is better not to script your speeches or sermons, but to let the Holy Spirit of your Father speak through you. Others see the expression as simply a comforting exhortation not to worry or be anxious, but to rest confident that God is in control (cf. Phil. 2:12-13). In other places the apostle Paul emphatically underscored the importance of diligent work in study and preparation (I Tim. 4:13-16; II Tim. 2:15).

Today impromptu preaching is practiced by unprogrammed Quakers, Mennonites and some Pentecostals.

=== Extemporaneous preaching ===

&quot;Extemporaneous preaching&quot; is a style of preaching involving extensive preparation of all the sermon except for the precise wording. The topic, basic structure and scripture to be used are all determined in advance, and the preachers saturate themselves in the details necessary to present their message so thoroughly that they are able to present the message with neither detailed notes nor perhaps even an outline. Consequently, unprepared preachers may find themselves unable to deliver a message with the same precision as people using detailed notes or memorizing detailed aspects of their speech.

While some might say this style is distinct from impromptu preaching, and that the preacher gives no specific preparation to their message, what Charles Spurgeon referred to as &quot;impromptu preaching&quot; he considered to be the same as extemporaneous preaching. He, in his sermon &quot;The Faculty of Impromptu Speech&quot;, describes extemporaneous preaching as a process of the preacher immersing himself in the Scriptures and prayer, knowing it so well that he only needs to find the appropriate words in the moment that the sermon is given. He states,

Henry Ware Jr. states,
On the other hand, it is distinct from many other forms of memorized preaching. Proponents claim that the importance of preaching demands it be extemporaneous.

The style was popular in the late 19th century among Baptist (Primitive Baptist especially), Methodist, Unitarian, and some Presbyterians preachers, such as Blackleach Burritt. Some of the more famous preachers who employed it were Charles Haddon Spurgeon, Charles Grandison Finney and Peter Cartwright.

==Secular usage==
In informal usage, the word &quot;sermon&quot; is used in secular terms, usually disapprovingly, to refer to &quot;a long talk in which someone advises other people how they should behave in order to be better people&quot;.

<text>A homily (from Greek ὁμιλία, &quot;homilía&quot;) is a commentary that follows a reading of scripture, giving the &quot;public explanation of a sacred doctrine&quot; or text. The works of Origen and John Chrysostom (known as Paschal Homily) are considered exemplary forms of Christian homily.

In Catholic, Anglican, Lutheran, and Eastern Orthodox churches, a homily is usually given during Mass (Divine Liturgy or Holy Qurbana for Orthodox and Eastern Catholic Churches, and Divine Service for the Lutheran Church) at the end of the Liturgy of the Word. Many people consider it synonymous with a sermon.

The English word homily is derived from the Ancient Greek word ὁμιλία &quot;homilia&quot;, which means intercourse or interaction with other people (derived from the word &quot;homilos,&quot; meaning &quot;a gathering&quot;). The word is used in (&quot;wicked &quot;homiliai&quot; corrupt good morals&quot;). The related verb is used in (as &quot;homiloun&quot;), and in (as &quot;homilei&quot;), both used in the sense of &quot;speaking with&quot;. The word later came to have a more technical sense. According to &quot;The Catholic Encyclopedia&quot;, Origen was the first to distinguish between &quot;logos&quot; (sermo) and &quot;homilia&quot; (tractatus).

==Roman Catholic Mass homily==
The General Instruction of the Roman Missal (GIRM), the official document governing the celebration of Mass, states that: 

== Other senses ==
Contemporary Protestant clergy often use the term &#x27;homily&#x27; to describe a short sermon, such as one created for a wedding or funeral.

In colloquial, non-religious, usage, &quot;homily&quot; often means a sermon concerning a practical matter, a moralizing lecture or admonition, or an inspirational saying or platitude, but sermon is the more appropriate word in these cases.

<doc id="203224" wikidata="Q1026894" url="?curid=203224" title="Lares, Puerto Rico">
<text>Lares (, ) is a mountain town and municipality of Puerto Rico&#x27;s central-western area. Lares is located north of Maricao and Yauco; south of Camuy, east of San Sebastián and Las Marias; and west of Hatillo, Utuado and Adjuntas. Lares is spread over 10 barrios and Lares Pueblo (Downtown Lares). It is part of the Aguadilla-Isabela-San Sebastián Metropolitan Statistical Area.

A city adorned with Spanish-era colonial-style churches and small downtown stores, Lares is located on a mountainous, breezy area that is about 1.5 hours from the capital San Juan by car.

In 1868, Lares was the site of the &quot;Grito de Lares&quot; (literally, &quot;The Cry of Lares&quot;, or Lares Revolt), an uprising brought on by pro-independence rebels members of the Revolutionary Committee of Puerto Rico striving for Puerto Rican independence from Spain. Even though it was short-lived, it remains an iconic historical event in the history of the island. The flag of the revolt, known as the &quot;Bandera del Grito de Lares (Grito de Lares flag)&quot;, is the official flag of Lares.

==History==

Lares was founded on April 26, 1827 by Francisco de Sotomayor and Pedro Vélez Borrero, who named the town after Amador de Lariz, a Spanish nobleman and one of its settlers.

Lares was the location of the &quot;Grito de Lares&quot; &quot;(Cry of Lares)&quot; revolt against Spanish rule in Puerto Rico on September 23, 1868. The revolt is recognized as the most important symbol of the Puerto Rican struggle for independence. Historian Fernando Picó described it thus:

Lares adopted the flag of the revolt as its official flag. The flag was proclaimed the national flag of a sovereign “Republic of Puerto Rico” by the revolting revolutionaries in 1868, making it the first flag of Puerto Rico. In 1895, the exiled revolutionaries replaced it with the current flag of Puerto Rico as the new revolutionary flag to represent an independent Puerto Rico. As the flag of the revolt, the flag of Lares is used by the independence movement in Puerto Rico to show support for the independence of the island from the United States.

Puerto Rico was ceded by Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish–American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 and became a territory of the United States. In 1899, the United States Department of War conducted a census of Puerto Rico finding that the population of Lares was 20,883.

Hurricane Maria on September 20, 2017, triggered numerous landslides in Lares. In many areas of Lares there were more than 25 landslides per square mile due to the significant amount of rainfall. (Puerto Rico will stand up) became the slogan used across the island to communicate the island would rise again.

When the hurricane hit, many areas in the Municipal Cemetery of Lares were damaged by landslides. Total affected were about 5,000 burial plots, with the burial places shifting and some plots opened. In response, the municipality closed the cemetery to the public. In early 2019, El Nuevo Día newspaper in Puerto Rico began listing the names of the cadavers that would be exhumed and moved to other cemeteries, a long and delicate process. On March 4, an update was given by Lares officials on how the issue was being handled. On May 10, 2019, it was announced that a decision had been made to build a temporary wooden structure separating the affected area so that family members could visit the plots that were unaffected by the hurricane-triggered landslides. The Bravo Family Foundation sent relief to Lares, in the immediate aftermath.

The December 2019 and January 2020 Puerto Rico earthquakes caused 28 families in Lares to lose their homes.

The superior (top) ones are blue and the inferior (bottom) ones red. A five-point white star is located in the center of the upper left rectangle.

===Coat of arms===
A silver cross is centered on and extends across the shield from side to side and top to bottom; it has blue top quadrants and red bottom quadrants; it has a five pointed silver star in the upper left quadrant.

<doc id="203230" wikidata="Q899657" url="?curid=203230" title="Iraqi no-fly zones conflict">
<text>The Iraqi no-fly zones conflict was a low-level conflict in the two no-fly zones (NFZs) in Iraq that were proclaimed by the United States, United Kingdom, and France after the Gulf War of 1991. The United States stated that the NFZs were intended to protect the ethnic Kurdish minority in northern Iraq and Shiite Muslims in the south. Iraqi aircraft were forbidden from flying inside the zones. The policy was enforced by the United States and the United Kingdom until 2003, when it was rendered obsolete by the 2003 invasion of Iraq. French aircraft patrols also participated until France withdrew in 1996.

The Iraqi government claimed 1,400 civilians were killed by Coalition bombing during the NFZ. The Kurdish-inhabited north gained effective autonomy and was protected from a feared repeat of the Anfal genocide in 1988 that killed tens of thousands of civilians. Over 280,000 sorties were flown in the first 9 years of the NFZs.

This military action was not authorised by the United Nations. The Secretary-General of the UN at the time the resolution was passed, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, called the no-fly zones &quot;illegal&quot; in a later interview with John Pilger.

== Legality ==
The American, British and French governments justified the no-fly zones by invoking United Nations Security Council Resolution 688, though the resolution made no explicit reference to no-fly zones. 

== Role in preparation for ground invasion ==
From March to December 2002 the number of bombs dropped increased by 300%. This was recognised as &quot;a clear indication that the no-fly zone is being used to destroy the country&#x27;s air defence systems in anticipation of an all-out attack&quot;. Whitehall officials privately admitted to &quot;the Guardian&quot; that the no-fly zones were being used to weaken Iraq&#x27;s air defence systems instead of the stated aim of defending the Marsh Arabs and the Shia population of Iraq.

The commander of the USS &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot;&#x27;s air wing said that the NFZ &quot;makes any potential action infinitely easier ... to fly over the same territory you&#x27;re going to attack is a real luxury&quot;.

== Civilian deaths ==
The United Nations reported that in 1999 alone 144 civilians were killed during Coalition bombing raids. By 1999 over 1,800 bombs had been dropped on Iraq, while Iraq stated that 1,400 civilians died due to bombing during the NFZ. 

The United States and coalition countries denied these allegations and cited popular Kurdish and Shia demands for no-fly zones, in order to protect against Saddam Hussein. The establishing of no-fly zones effectively cut off Saddam Hussein from much of the north and secured the Kurdish population, who gained effective autonomy directly following the intervention. This autonomy has continued to thrive and even avoided the chaos and bloodshed that characterized the rest of Iraq during the 2003 Iraq war.

== History ==

From 1992 to the United States-led coalition invasion of Iraq in 2003, there were two NFZs in Iraq. The NFZ in the north of Iraq was established shortly after the Gulf War, extending from the 36th parallel northwards. In August 1992 the NFZ in the south to the 32nd parallel was established, but in 1996 it was expanded to the 33rd parallel. The northern NFZ was initially part of Operation Provide Comfort relief operations to a persecuted Kurdish minority in Iraq, and was followed on by Operation Northern Watch. The southern NFZ was maintained by Operation Southern Watch.

When Operation Desert Storm ended in 1991, the safety of Kurds who were fleeing during the uprising from Iraqi persecution became an issue, and Operation Provide Comfort began. This operation essentially created a Northern NFZ to Iraqi military aircraft. The operation provided the Kurdish population with humanitarian aid and reassurance of safe skies.

On 26 June 1993, the U.S. conducted a cruise missile attack on the Iraqi Intelligence Service&#x27;s (IIS) principal command and control complex in Baghdad, publicly announced as retaliation for the assassination attempt by the IIS on former President George H. W. Bush while he was visiting Kuwait in April of that year to commemorate a coalition victory over Iraq in the Gulf War. Fourteen cruise missiles were launched from and nine of them launched from . Sixteen hit the target, while three struck a residential area, killing nine civilians and wounding 12 others. Four missiles were unaccounted for.

In October 1994, Baghdad once again began mobilizing around 64,000 Iraqi troops near the Kuwaiti border because of their expressed frustrations of economic sanctions imposed on Iraq by the United Nations Security Council (UNSC). In response, the U.S. begins to deploy troops in the Persian Gulf to deter Iraqi aggression against Kuwait. Code-named Operation Vigilant Warrior, 1st Brigade of the Fort Stewart, Georgia-based 24th Infantry Division (Mechanized) deployed and drew pre-positioned equipment in Kuwait. The 23rd Wing&#x27;s (Flying Tigers) 75th Fighter Squadron (Tigersharks) and its full complement of A-10s initially deployed from Pope AFB, North Carolina to Dhahran Air Base, Saudi Arabia, followed by the first forward deployment to Ahmad al-Jaber Air Base, Kuwait. This allowed better face-to-face coordination with tactical air control parties (TACP) assets further forward deployed at Camp Doha, Kuwait and points north. Iraq would later withdraw troops near the Kuwaiti border in response to a massive U.S. military build-up.

However, this was marred by a friendly-fire incident on 14 April 1994 when two United States Air Force F-15 Eagle fighter planes mistakenly shot down two United States Army UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters, killing 26 Coalition military and civilian personnel.

In September 1996, the U.S. conducted Operation Desert Strike, and ships from the Battle Group, including , and , in conjunction with B-52 bombers escorted by F-14D Tomcats from USS &quot;Carl Vinson&quot;, launched 27 cruise missiles against Iraqi air defense targets in southern Iraq. A second wave of 17 was launched later that day. The missiles hit targets in and around Kut, Iskandariyah, Nasiriyah, and Tallil. This was done in response to Saddam Hussein, the dictator of Iraq, attempting to launch an Iraqi military offensive campaign in the Kurdish town of Arbil in Iraqi Kurdistan.

Operation Provide Comfort officially ended on 31 December 1996. Following Operation Provide Comfort, the United States continued to watch over the northern skies with the launching of Operation Northern Watch on 1 January 1997. Operation Northern Watch continued to provide air security to the Kurdish population in the north. By 1999, the Department of Defense had flown over 200,000 sorties over Iraq.

American and British aircraft continuously enforced the NFZ, receiving anti-aircraft fire from Iraqi forces almost daily. The operation ran until its conclusion on 1 May 2003. In the south, Operation Southern Watch was underway to watch over the persecuted Shi&#x27;ite populations. This operation was launched on 27 August 1992 with the mission of preventing further human rights abuses against civilian populations. Iraq challenged the no-fly zone beginning in December 1992 when a USAF F-16 fighter plane shot down an Iraqi MiG-25 Foxbat fighter which had locked onto it in the Southern no-fly zone. The next month Coalition planes attacked Iraqi SAM sites in the South. Baghdad eventually halted firing on patrolling Coalition aircraft after August 1993.

In December 1998, Operation Desert Fox was conducted by the USAF and the Royal Air Force, which was a major four-day bombing campaign on Iraqi targets from 16 December to 19 December 1998. The contemporaneous justification for the strikes was Iraq&#x27;s failure to comply with United Nations Security Council resolutions and its interference with United Nations Special Commission inspectors.

In the aftermath of Operation Desert Fox in December 1998, Iraq announced it would no longer respect the no-fly zones and resumed its efforts in shooting down Coalition aircraft. Saddam Hussein offered a $14,000 reward to anyone who could accomplish this task, but no manned aircraft were ever shot down by Iraq. Air strikes by British and American aircraft against Iraqi claimed anti-aircraft and military targets continued weekly over the next few years. In the early 2000s (decade), the U.S. developed a contingency plan, Operation Desert Badger for dealing with pilots shot down over Iraqi no-fly zones.The operation continued until it transitioned to Operation Southern Focus in June 2002. They began to carry out offensive sorties, not only against targets that had fired on them, but upon installations that had demonstrated no hostile intent. The U.S. claimed that these increased attacks were the result of increasing Iraqi provocations, but later, in July 2005, the British Ministry of Defense released figures showing that the number of provocations had actually dropped dramatically prior to and just after the increase in allied attacks. Their records indicate that in the first seven months of 2001, there had been 370 provocations on the part of Iraq. In the seven months from October 2001 into May 2002, only 32 such provocations were recorded. General Tommy Franks later acknowledged that the dramatic increase in offensive sorties was an attempt to destroy the Iraqi defenses in much the same way as the air strikes at the beginning of the Gulf War had.

In purported retaliation for the Iraqis&#x27; now-daily air defense attacks on Coalition aircraft, the September attacks included a 5 September 100-aircraft attack on the main air defense site in western Iraq. According to an editorial by Michael Smith for the &quot;New Statesman&quot;, this was &quot;Located at the furthest extreme of the southern no-fly zone, far away from the areas that needed to be patrolled to prevent attacks on the Shi&#x27;a; it was destroyed not because it was a threat to the patrols, but to allow allied special forces operating from Jordan to enter Iraq undetected.&quot;

The NFZs effectively ceased to exist with the beginning of the Iraq War in March 2003, since air superiority over the country was quickly attained by the coalition. The NFZs were officially deactivated right after Saddam Hussein&#x27;s overthrow.

<text>American International Pictures LLC (AIP or American International Productions) is an American film production company owned by Amazon MGM Studios. In its original operating period, AIP was an independent film production and distribution company known for producing and releasing films from 1955 until 1980, a year after its acquisition by Filmways in 1979.

It was formed on April 2, 1954, as American Releasing Corporation (ARC) by former Realart Pictures Inc. sales manager James H. Nicholson and entertainment lawyer Samuel Z. Arkoff and their first release was the 1953 UK documentary film &quot;Operation Malaya&quot;. It was dedicated to releasing low-budget films packaged as double features, primarily of interest to the teenagers of the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s.

The company eventually became a part of Orion Pictures, which in turn, became a division of Amazon MGM Studios. On October 7, 2020, four decades after the original closure, MGM revived AIP as a label for acquired films for digital and theatrical releases, with MGM overseeing across streaming platforms and United Artists Releasing handling theatrical distribution in North America until 2023 when Amazon MGM Studios took over.

== AIP personnel ==
Nicholson and Arkoff served as executive producers while Roger Corman and Alex Gordon were the principal film producers and, sometimes, directors. Writer Charles B. Griffith wrote many of the early films, along with Arkoff&#x27;s brother-in-law, Lou Rusoff, who later produced many of the films he had written. Other writers included Ray Russell, Richard Matheson and Charles Beaumont. Floyd Crosby, A.S.C. famous for his camera work on a number of exotic documentaries and the Oscar winner, &quot;High Noon&quot;, was chief cinematographer. His innovative use of surreal color and odd lenses and angles gave AIP films a signature look. The early rubber monster suits and miniatures of Paul Blaisdell were used in AIP&#x27;s science fiction films. The company also hired Les Baxter and Ronald Stein to compose many of its film scores.

In the 1950s, the company had a number of actors under contract, including John Ashley, Fay Spain and Steve Terrell.

== Emphasis on teenagers ==
When many of ARC/AIP&#x27;s first releases failed to earn a profit, Arkoff quizzed film exhibitors who told him of the value of the teenage market as adults were watching television. AIP stopped making Westerns with Arkoff explaining: &quot;To compete with television westerns you have to have color, big stars and $2,000,000&quot;.

AIP was the first company to use focus groups, polling American teenagers about what they would like to see and using their responses to determine titles, stars, and story content. AIP would question their exhibitors (who often provided 20% of AIP&#x27;s financing) what they thought of the success of a title, then would have a writer create a script for it. A sequence of tasks in a typical production involved creating a great title, getting an artist such as Albert Kallis who supervised all AIP artwork from 1955 to 1973 to create a dynamic, eye-catching poster, then raising the cash, and finally writing and casting the film.

According to Filmink, &quot;AIP ran on basic principles: keep overheads down (i.e. no permanent studio space), keep all costs down, use fading stars (eg Ray Milland) or its own up-and-coming names (eg John Ashley), use cheap directors, go for genre (horror, sci fi, action, peplum), follow the trends, abandon the trends when audience enthusiasm lessens, give audiences something they can’t get from a regular studio picture, build your own franchises.&quot;

== The ARKOFF formula ==
Samuel Z. Arkoff related his tried-and-true &quot;ARKOFF formula&quot; for producing a successful low-budget movie years later, during a 1980s talk show appearance. His ideas for a movie included:

* Action (exciting, entertaining drama)
* Revolution (novel or controversial themes and ideas)
* Killing (a modicum of violence)
* Oratory (notable dialogue and speeches)
* Fantasy (acted-out fantasies common to the audience)
* Fornication (sex appeal for young adults)

Later, the AIP publicity department devised a strategy called &quot;the Peter Pan Syndrome&quot;:

a) a younger child will watch anything an older child will watch;&lt;br&gt;
b) an older child will not watch anything a younger child will watch;&lt;br&gt;
c) a girl will watch anything a boy will watch;&lt;br&gt;
d) a boy will not watch anything a girl will watch;&lt;br&gt;
therefore:
to catch your greatest audience you zero in on the 19-year-old male.

== History==
=== American Releasing Corporation ===
AIP began as the American Releasing Corporation, a new distribution company formed in 1954 by James H. Nicholson and Samuel Z. Arkoff.

==== Roger Corman ====
They were interested in distributing a car chase movie produced by Roger Corman for his Palo Alto Productions, &quot;The Fast and the Furious&quot; (1955). Corman had received offers from other companies for the film, but ARC offered to advance money to enable Corman to make two other films. Corman agreed, &quot;The Fast and the Furious&quot; performed well at the box office and the company was launched.

Corman&#x27;s next two films for the company were a Western, &quot;Five Guns West&quot; (1955), which Corman directed, and a science fiction film, &quot;The Beast with a Million Eyes&quot; (1955). The title from the latter had come from Nicholson.

ARC also distributed the Western &quot;Outlaw Treasure&quot; (1955) starring Johnny Carpenter.

==== Alex Gordon ====
ARC got Corman to direct another Western and science fiction double bill &quot;Apache Woman&quot; (1955) and &quot;Day the World Ended&quot; (1955). Both scripts were written by Arkoff&#x27;s brother-in-law Lou Rusoff, who would become the company&#x27;s leading writer in its early days. &quot;Apache Woman&quot; was produced by Alex Gordon, an associate of Arkoff&#x27;s, &quot;Day&quot; was produced by Corman. Both were made by Golden State Productions, ARC&#x27;s production arm.

Normally, B movies were made for the second part of a bill and received a flat rate. As television was encroaching on the B movie market, Nicholson and Arkoff felt it would be more profitable to make two low budget films and distribute them together on a double feature. Nicholson came up with a title for a film to support &quot;Day the World Ended&quot;, &quot;The Phantom from 10,000 Leagues&quot; (1955), but lacked the money to make both films. They split the costs with Dan and Jack Milner, film editors who wanted to get into production. The resulting double bill was very successful at the box office.

Gordon also produced &quot;The Oklahoma Woman&quot; (1955), a Western by Corman, made through Sunset Productions. It was put on a double feature with &quot;Female Jungle&quot; (1955), a film noir.

Other films released under the ARC banner include a British documentary &quot;Operation Malaya&quot; (1955) and Corman&#x27;s &quot;Gunslinger&quot; (1956).

=== American International in the 1950s ===
Arkoff and Nicholson had always wanted to name their company &quot;American International Pictures&quot;, but the name was unavailable. When the name became available, they changed over.

There were three main production arms at AIP in the late 1950s: Roger Corman, Alex Gordon &amp; Lou Rusoff, and Herman Cohen. Arkoff and Nicholson would buy films from other filmmakers as well, and import films from outside America.

==== Roger Corman ====
Corman continued to be an important member of AIP (though he also worked for Allied Artists and his own Filmgroup company during this period). He had a big hit for the company with the science fiction film &quot;It Conquered the World&quot; (1956) from a script by Rusoff that was rewritten by Charles B. Griffith.

His films included &quot;Rock All Night&quot; (1956); &quot;Naked Paradise&quot; (1957), in which Arkoff had a small role; &quot;The Undead&quot;; &quot;Sorority Girl&quot;; &quot;The Saga of the Viking Women and Their Voyage to the Waters of the Great Sea Serpent&quot; (1957); &quot;Machine Gun Kelly&quot; with Charles Bronson; and &quot;Teenage Caveman&quot; (1958), with Robert Vaughn.

AIP also distributed films Corman helped finance, such as &quot;Night of the Blood Beast&quot;, &quot;She Gods of Shark Reef&quot; and &quot;The Brain Eaters&quot; (all released in 1958).

==== Alex Gordon and Lou Rusoff ====
The other key producer for AIP was Alex Gordon who mostly made films though his Golden State Productions outfit, usually written by Lou Rusoff. He made &quot;Girls in Prison&quot; (1956), with director Edward L. Cahn who would become one of AIP&#x27;s most prolific directors. AIP released it on a double bill with &quot;Hot Rod Girl&quot; (1956).

Cahn also directed the following for Gordon: &quot;The She-Creature&quot; (released as a double feature with &quot;It Conquered the World&quot;); &quot;Flesh and the Spur&quot;, the last Western made by AIP; &quot;Shake, Rattle &amp; Rock!&quot;, a rock musical with Mike Connors; &quot;Runaway Daughters&quot; (1956); &quot;Voodoo Woman&quot;; &quot;Dragstrip Girl&quot; (1957), with John Ashley; &quot;Motorcycle Gang&quot; (1957), again with Ashley; &quot;Jet Attack&quot; and &quot;Submarine Seahawk&quot; (1958). Most of these were written by Rusoff and directed by Edward L. Cahn.

Gordon left AIP and Rusoff alone produced &quot;Hot Rod Gang&quot; (1958) and &quot;Ghost of Dragstrip Hollow&quot; (1959).

==== Herman Cohen ====
Another key producer for AIP was Herman Cohen, who had a huge hit with &quot;I Was a Teenage Werewolf&quot; (1957) starring Michael Landon. He followed it with &quot;I Was a Teenage Frankenstein&quot;, &quot;Blood of Dracula&quot; (both also in 1957 as a double feature), &quot;How to Make a Monster&quot; (1958), &quot;The Headless Ghost&quot; and &quot;Horrors of the Black Museum&quot; (both in 1959).

==== Other producers ====
Other key collaborators who worked for AIP in the late 1950s included:
* Norman T. Herman: &quot;Hot Rod Girl&quot; (1956)
* Robert Gurney: &quot;Invasion of the Saucer Men&quot; (1957; released as a double feature with &quot;I Was a Teenage Werewolf&quot;), &quot;Reform School Girl&quot; (1957) and &quot;Terror from the Year 5000&quot; (1958)
* Bert I. Gordon: &quot;The Amazing Colossal Man&quot; (1957), &quot;Attack of the Puppet People&quot; (1958), &quot;War of the Colossal Beast&quot; (1958; the sequel to &quot;The Amazing Colossal Man&quot;) and &quot;Earth vs. the Spider&quot; (1958)
* Burt Topper: &quot;Hell Squad&quot; (1958), &quot;Tank Commandos&quot; (1959) and &quot;Diary of a High School Bride&quot; (1959)
* Edward Bernds: &quot;High School Hellcats&quot; (1958).
* Stanley Shpetne: &quot;The Bonnie Parker Story&quot; (1958) and &quot;Paratroop Command&quot; (1959).
* Stanley Kallis: &quot;Operation Dames&quot; (1959) and &quot;Roadracers&quot; (1959).

==== Pickups ====
AIP would flesh out their distribution schedule by buying films made by outside producers. These included &quot;The Astounding She-Monster&quot;, the documentary &quot;Naked Africa&quot;, &quot;The Screaming Skull&quot; (1957), &quot;The Cool and the Crazy&quot;, &quot;Daddy-O&quot;, &quot;Dragstrip Riot&quot; and &quot;Tank Battalion&quot; (1958).

==== Anglo-Amalgamated ====
AIP developed a mutual relationship with Britain&#x27;s Anglo-Amalgamated who would distribute AIP&#x27;s product in the UK. In return, AIP would distribute their films in the U.S., such as &quot;The Tommy Steele Story&quot; (1957) and &quot;Cat Girl&quot; (1957).

AIP also imported &quot;The White Huntress&quot; (1954, England), &quot;Pulgarcito&quot; (1958, Mexico) and &quot;The Sky Calls&quot; (1959, Russia).

==== Late 1950s crisis ====
AIP became a victim of its own success when other companies started copying its double feature strategy. Costs were rising and were not compensated by increased box office grosses. AIP shut down most of their production arms and focused on distributing films from Italy, while they decided what to do next.

In October 1959 AIP announced it had secured finance from Colonial Bank (who had financed three of their films to date) for ten films over the next 12 months. The remaining 14 to 20 projects planned were paid by Pathe Laboratories. The ten films were &quot;Diary of a High School Bride&quot;, &quot;Drag Race&quot;, &quot;The Haunted House of Usher&quot;, &quot;End of the World&quot;, &quot;World Without Women&quot;, &quot;Bombs Away&quot;, &quot;Blood Hill&quot;,&quot;Take Me To Your Leader&quot;, &quot;She&quot; and &quot;Eve and the Dragon&quot;. Not all of these would be made.

=== AIP&#x27;s 1960s output ===
The company moved into rented office space at the former Chaplin Studios.

==== Imports ====
In the late 1950s, AIP kept their company afloat by importing films from Italy. These included &quot;Sheba and the Gladiator&quot; (1959), &quot;Goliath and the Barbarians&quot; (1959) and &quot;Black Sunday&quot; (1960); the latter film proved to be one of the company&#x27;s early successes.

There was also &quot;Atomic Agent&quot; (1959, France), &quot;The Angry Red Planet&quot; (1959, Denmark), &quot;Tiger of Bengal&quot; (1959) and &quot;The Indian Tomb&quot; (1960) from Fritz Lang in Germany, edited together as &quot;Journey to the Lost City&quot;, &quot;Portrait of a Sinner&quot; (1959, West Germany), &quot;The Professionals&quot; (1960, Great Britain), and &quot;Escape to Paradise&quot; (1960, the Philippines).

They also bought &quot;Why Must I Die?&quot; and &quot;The Jailbreakers&quot; (1960).

==== The Corman-Poe cycle ====
In the early 1960s, AIP gained kudos by combining Roger Corman, Vincent Price and the stories of Edgar Allan Poe into a series of horror films, with scripts by Richard Matheson, Charles Beaumont, Ray Russell, R. Wright Campbell and Robert Towne.

The original idea, usually credited to Corman and Lou Rusoff, was to take Poe&#x27;s story &quot;The Fall of the House of Usher&quot;, which had both a high name-recognition value and the merit of being in the public domain, and thus royalty-free, and expand it into a feature film. Corman convinced the studio to give him a larger budget than the typical AIP film so he could film the movie in widescreen and color, and use it to create lavish sets as well.

The success of &quot;House of Usher&quot; led AIP to finance further films based on Poe&#x27;s stories. The sets and special effects were often reused in subsequent movies (for example, the burning roof of the Usher mansion reappears in most of the other films as stock footage), making the series quite cost-effective. All the films in the series were directed by Roger Corman, and they all starred Price except &quot;The Premature Burial&quot;, which featured Ray Milland in the lead. It was originally produced for another studio, but AIP acquired the rights to it.

As the series progressed, Corman made attempts to change the formula. Later films added more humor to the stories, especially &quot;The Raven&quot;, which takes Poe&#x27;s poem as an inspiration and develops it into an all-out farce starring Price, Boris Karloff and Peter Lorre; Karloff had starred in a 1935 film with the same title. Corman also adapted H. P. Lovecraft&#x27;s short novel &quot;The Case of Charles Dexter Ward&quot; in an attempt to get away from Poe, but AIP changed the title to that of an obscure Poe poem, &quot;The Haunted Palace&quot;, and marketed it as yet another movie in the series. The last two films in the series, &quot;The Masque of the Red Death&quot; and &quot;The Tomb of Ligeia&quot;, were filmed in England with an unusually long schedule for Corman and AIP.

Although Corman and Rusoff are generally credited with coming up with the idea for the Poe series, in an interview on the Anchor Bay DVD of Mario Bava&#x27;s &quot;Black Sabbath&quot;, Mark Damon claims that he first suggested the idea to Corman. Damon also says that Corman let him direct &quot;The Pit and the Pendulum&quot; uncredited. Corman&#x27;s commentary for &quot;Pit&quot; mentions nothing of this and all existing production stills of the film show Corman directing.

==== List of Corman-Poe films ====
During the early 1960s, AIP produced a series of horror films inspired by the Poe cycle. Of eight films, seven feature stories that are actually based on the works of Poe.

# &quot;House of Usher&quot; (1960) – based on the short story &quot;The Fall of the House of Usher&quot;
# &quot;The Pit and the Pendulum&quot; (1961) – based on the title of the short story of the same name
# &quot;The Premature Burial&quot; (1962) – based on the short story of the same name
# &quot;Tales of Terror&quot; (1962) – based on the short stories &quot;Morella&quot;, &quot;The Black Cat&quot;, &quot;The Cask of Amontillado&quot; and &quot;The Facts in the Case of M. Valdemar&quot;
# &quot;The Raven&quot; (1963) – based on the poem of the same name
# &quot;The Haunted Palace&quot; (1963) – plot based on H. P. Lovecraft&#x27;s novel &quot;The Case of Charles Dexter Ward&quot;, using the title from Poe&#x27;s 1839 poem
# &quot;The Masque of the Red Death&quot; (1964) – based on the short story of the same name with another Poe short story, &quot;Hop-Frog&quot;, used as a subplot
# &quot;The Tomb of Ligeia&quot; (1964) – based on the short story &quot;Ligeia&quot;

Seven of the films, with the exception of &quot;The Premature Burial&quot;, featured Vincent Price as the star. Occasionally, Corman&#x27;s 1963 film &quot;The Terror&quot; (produced immediately after &quot;The Raven&quot;) is recognized as being part of the Corman-Poe cycle, although the film&#x27;s story and title are not based on any literary work of Poe.

Some Poe films announced by AIP but not made include &quot;The Gold Bug&quot;, &quot;The Thousand and Second Tale of Scheherazade&quot;, and &quot;The Angel of the Odd&quot;.

In 1962, Arkoff said AIP was in a position similar to Columbia Pictures just before they made &quot;Submarine&quot; and &quot;Dirigible&quot;:
Before that they were on poverty row. Our better position will enable us to obtain more important writers, perhaps more important producers as well. We&#x27;re a privately owned company at the moment but perhaps within two or three years we will become a public company.

==== Beach Party era ====
Beginning with 1963&#x27;s &quot;Beach Party&quot;, AIP created a new genre of beach party films featuring Annette Funicello and Frankie Avalon. The original idea and the first script were Rusoff&#x27;s. The highly successful and often imitated series ended in 1966 with the seventh film, &quot;The Ghost in the Invisible Bikini&quot;. Many actors from the beach films also appeared in AIP&#x27;s spy-spoofs, such as &quot;Dr. Goldfoot and the Bikini Machine&quot; (1965) and car racing films like &quot;Fireball 500&quot; (1966) and &quot;Thunder Alley&quot;. During this time, AIP also produced or distributed most of Corman&#x27;s horror films, such as &quot;&quot;.

In 1966, the studio released &quot;The Wild Angels&quot; starring Peter Fonda, based loosely on the real-life exploits of the Hells Angels motorcycle gang. This film ushered in AIP&#x27;s most successful year and kicked off a subgenre of motorcycle gang films that lasted almost 10 years and included &quot;Devil&#x27;s Angels&quot;, &quot;The Glory Stompers&quot; with Dennis Hopper, and &quot;The Born Losers&quot;—the film that introduced the Billy Jack character.

In 1968, AIP launched a $22 million film programme. The psychedelic and hippie scenes of the late &#x27;60s were also exploited with films like &quot;The Trip&quot;, also with Fonda, &quot;Riot on Sunset Strip&quot;, &quot;Wild in the Streets&quot;, &quot;Maryjane&quot;, &quot;Gas-s-s-s&quot; and &quot;Psych-Out&quot; with Jack Nicholson. These &quot;social protest&quot; films were also highly successful. Horror movies also enjoyed a revival of popularity in the late 60s.

==== International American International ====
In the UK, AIP struck up a film making partnership with Nat Cohen and Stuart Levy&#x27;s Anglo-Amalgamated. Anglo eventually released over 140 AIP-made or owned movies in the UK, mainly on double bills. The arrangement also saw Anglo Amalgamated&#x27;s British-made films distributed in the US by AIP. AIP&#x27;s co-productions with Anglo included &quot;Cat Girl&quot;, &quot;Circus of Horrors&quot; and &quot;The Masque of the Red Death&quot;. AIP also had co-production arrangements with Tigon British Film Productions, Hammer Film Productions and Amicus Productions. Amongst the movies made under these arrangements were &quot;Witchfinder General&quot;, &quot;The Vampire Lovers&quot; and &quot;Scream and Scream Again&quot;. AIP maintained a production office in London until 1973 before it was closed down. Nevertheless, the company remained active in making and financing British films, including &quot;Hennessy&quot; and &quot;The People that Time Forgot&quot;. They were also, briefly, involved in setting up two Hammer projects- &quot;Vampirella&quot; and &quot;To the Devil a Daughter&quot; (AIP distributed the latter on its initial US run.)

On a trip to Italy, Arkoff met Fulvio Lucisano, an Italian screenwriter and producer who eventually headed Italian International Film, which co-produced 25 films in Italy for AIP. Due to importing completed productions from other foreign countries being cheaper and simpler than producing their own in-house studio films in America, AIP had released many giallo, peplum, Eurospy and Macaroni Combat war films featuring many American stars and Italian stars such as the comedy team of Franco and Ciccio. However, AIP released only two Spaghetti Westerns (&quot;Massacre Time&quot; retitled &quot;The Brute and the Beast&quot; and &quot;God Forgives... I Don&#x27;t!&quot;), perhaps recalling their failure with Westerns in the 1950s. Many of these films were edited, rewritten with different (dubbed English) dialogue, usually by Arkoff&#x27;s nephew Ted Rusoff, and sometimes re-scored by Les Baxter.

AIP, through Henry G. Saperstein, is known for being the major U.S. distributor for Toho&#x27;s &quot;Godzilla&quot; and Daiei&#x27;s &quot;Gamera&quot; (kaiju) films of the 1960s and 1970s. AIP also distributed other Japanese science fiction films like &quot;Frankenstein Conquers the World&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;The X from Outer Space&quot; and the South Korean production &quot;Yongary, Monster from the Deep&quot;, as well as two Japanese animated features from Toei Animation, &quot;Alakazam the Great&quot; and &quot;Jack and the Witch&quot;.

AIP also released a pair of Japanese spy thrillers re-dubbed as a comedy co-written by Woody Allen called &quot;What&#x27;s Up Tiger Lily?&quot;.

The studio also released edited and English-dubbed versions of several Eastern Bloc science fiction films that had the dialogue rewritten for the American market and in some cases had additional scenes filmed with American and British actors. These include the Soviet film &quot;Planeta Bur&quot; (&quot;Planet of Storms&quot;) which was released by AIP in two different English-dubbed versions, as &quot;Voyage to the Prehistoric Planet&quot; and &quot;Voyage to the Planet of Prehistoric Women&quot; and the highly regarded 1963 Czech science fiction film &quot;Ikarie XB-1&quot;, which was re-titled &quot;Voyage to the End of the Universe&quot;.

A few years later, AIP backed a British Poe film directed by Gordon Hessler: &quot;The Oblong Box&quot; (1969) based on the short story of the same name.

==== AIP-TV ====

In 1964, AIP became one of the last film studios to start its own television production company, American International Productions Television (a.k.a. American-International Television or AIP-TV). AIP-TV at first released many of their 1950s films to American television stations, then filmed unsuccessful television pilots for &quot;Beach Party&quot; and &quot;Sergeant Deadhead&quot;. The company then made several color sci-fi/horror television films by Larry Buchanan that were remakes of black-and-white AIP films, and sold packages of many English-dubbed European, Japanese and Mexican films (the last type were produced by K. Gordon Murray) and foreign-made live-action and animated TV series (including &quot;Prince Planet&quot;). The best known animated series AIP-TV distributed was &quot;Sinbad Jr. and his Magic Belt&quot;.

In order to allay the fears of cinema owners who feared current releases would soon end up being shown on television, AIP issued a statement retroactive to 1963 that the company would not release any of their films to television until five years after cinema release, unless the film had not made back its original negative costs. AIP-TV also filmed specials for promotion of AIP films, such as &quot;The Wild Weird World of Dr. Goldfoot&quot; (1965, ABC) and &quot;An Evening of Edgar Allan Poe&quot; (1972, syndication), both with Vincent Price.

In 1978, AIP-TV distributed the pop music series &quot;Twiggy&#x27;s Jukebox&quot;. For several years around this time, AIP-TV also distributed several British TV series, including &quot;The Avengers&quot;, to U.S. stations.

==== AIP Records ====
AIP started their own record label, American International Records, in 1959 to release music used in their films. There were a number of soundtrack albums as well.

AIP Records was once distributed by MGM Records, the record label owned by AIP&#x27;s successor-in-interest MGM.

=== Going Public and Departure of Nicholson ===
In 1969, AIP went public to raise extra capital, issuing 300,000 shares.

In 1970, they entered into an agreement with Commonwealth United Entertainment to issue their films. In 1971 they released 31 films, their greatest number to date, and were seen as one of the most stable companies in Hollywood. Despite their exploitation roots, they did not concentrate on R- or X-rated filmmaking during this period.

In 1972, James H. Nicholson resigned from AIP to set up his own production company working out of 20th Century Fox, called Academy Pictures Corporation; its only two releases were &quot;The Legend of Hell House&quot; and &quot;Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry&quot;. AIP bought out over 100,000 of Nicholson&#x27;s shares. He died shortly thereafter of a cancerous brain tumor.

Around this time Roger Corman stopped making films for AIP, focusing on his company, New World Pictures. According to &quot;Filmink&quot; &quot;Corman leaving AIP coincided with Nicholson and Arkoff splitting up – they were like two parents who decide to get divorced when their eldest child finally moves out of home.&quot;

=== Arkoff alone ===
Arkoff continued on at AIP as president until the end of the decade. Heads of production during the 1970s included Larry Gordon (from January 1972 until early 1974) and Jere Henshaw (from 1977 until the demise of the company).

By the early 1970s, AIP felt the horror movie cycle was in decline and so switched to other genres, such as kung fu and gangsters. Notably, they produced some of that decade&#x27;s blaxploitation films, like &quot;Blacula&quot; and &quot;Foxy Brown&quot;. In a throwback to the old &quot;studio days&quot;, the company is credited with making Pam Grier a household name, as the majority of her early &#x27;70s films were made under contract to American International.

In the mid- to late 1970s, AIP began to produce more mainstream films, such as &quot;Bunny O&#x27;Hare&quot;, &quot;Cooley High&quot;, &quot;The Great Scout &amp; Cathouse Thursday&quot;, &quot;The Amityville Horror&quot;, &quot;Love at First Bite&quot;, &quot;Meteor&quot;, &quot;Force 10 from Navarone&quot;, &quot;Shout at the Devil&quot;, &quot;The Island of Dr. Moreau&quot; and &quot;C.H.O.M.P.S&quot;. The increased spending on these projects, though they did make some money, contributed to the company&#x27;s downfall. In the meantime, the studio imported and released its final foreign film, an Australian film, &quot;Mad Max&quot;, dubbed into American English.

James Nicholson&#x27;s first wife Sylvia was still a major shareholder of the company. She sued AIP for mismanagement, but this was resolved in 1978 when AIP bought out her shares.

=== Merger with Filmways ===
By the late 1970s, filmmaking costs continued to rise, AIP&#x27;s tactic of moving into bigger budgeted quality pictures was not paying off at the box office, and Arkoff began to think of merging the company. &quot;We&#x27;ve been the Woolworths of the movie business but Woolworths is being out priced&quot;, said Arkoff. Talks began with Filmways, Incorporated. Negotiations stalled for a while, but resumed a number of months later. In 1979, AIP was sold to Filmways for $30 million and became a subsidiary production unit thereof, renamed Filmways Pictures in 1980.

Arkoff was unhappy with the direction of the company and resigned to set up his own production company, receiving a pay out worth $1.4 million.

AIP-TV was absorbed as the wholly owned program syndication arm of Filmways Television. Filmways was later bought by Orion Pictures Company in 1982 and Filmways was later renamed Orion Pictures Corporation, but retained the distribution arm. This allowed Orion to establish its own distribution, after utilizing Warner Bros. for distribution. Warner Bros. still has distribution rights to Orion films which were originally distributed by this company. Today, a majority of the AIP library is owned by Amazon MGM Studios (via Orion Pictures). The American International name is still a registered trademark owned by Amazon MGM Studios&#x27;s Orion Pictures unit.

=== Relaunch ===
On October 7, 2020, it was announced that Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer relaunched AIP as a label for films that the studio will acquire for digital and limited theatrical releases. An MGM executive, Eric Hohl, was accepted as a president of the studio. MGM will oversee AIP&#x27;s new films across all streaming platforms and the theatrical releases of them will be handled by its joint distribution venture United Artists Releasing. The first film from the relaunched AIP was &quot;Breaking News in Yuba County&quot;, directed by Tate Taylor and starring Allison Janney, which was released on February 12, 2021.

On May 17, 2021, technology company Amazon entered negotiations to acquire MGM and even made a bid for about $9 billion. The negotiations are made with Anchorage Capital Kevin Ulrich. On May 26, 2021, it was officially announced that MGM will be acquired by Amazon for $8.45 billion, subject to regulatory approvals and other routine closing conditions; with the studio continuing to operate as a label under the new parent company, which includes AIP and its titles. The merger was finalized on March 17, 2022. On March 4, 2023, Amazon shut down UAR&#x27;s operations and folded them into MGM. In May 2023, Amazon Studios created Amazon MGM Studios Distribution, an international film and television distribution unit for both MGM and Amazon projects, which will include new projects and acquisitions from AIP.

=== Legacy ===
In 2005, less than four years after the death of Arkoff, filmmaker and Troublemaker Studios co-founder Robert Rodriguez founded a horror genre film and television company called Rodriguez International Pictures, which is a homage to the company.

<text>Halliburton Company is an American multinational corporation and the world&#x27;s second-largest oil service company which is responsible for most of the world&#x27;s fracking operations. It employs approximately 55,000 people through its hundreds of subsidiaries, affiliates, branches, brands, and divisions in more than 70 countries. The company, though incorporated in the United States, has dual headquarters located in Houston and in Dubai.

Halliburton&#x27;s major business segment is the Energy Services Group (ESG). KBR, a public company and former Halliburton subsidiary, is a major construction company of refineries, oil fields, pipelines, and chemical plants. Halliburton announced on April 5, 2007, that it had sold the division and severed its corporate relationship with KBR, which had been its contracting, engineering and construction unit as a part of the company.

The company has been criticized for its involvement in numerous controversies, including its involvement with Dick Cheney – as U.S. Secretary of Defense, then CEO of the company, then Vice President of the United States – and the Iraq War, and the &quot;Deepwater Horizon&quot;, for which it agreed to settle outstanding legal claims against it by paying litigants $1.1 billion.

KBR, one of Halliburton&#x27;s subsidiaries at the time, paid bribes to high-ranking Nigerian officials between 1994 and 2004. Under a deal reached with the U.S. Justice Department, Halliburton has agreed to pay $382 million to settle the bribery case.

In 2015, Halliburton was found guilty in court for illegal retaliation against a whistleblower who filed a report with the SEC over concerns that the company was illegally concealing billions of dollars.

The company has also been criticized for refusing to comply with United States Environmental Protection Agency requests for transparency around chemicals it uses in hydraulic fracturing.

Jeff Miller was promoted to President of Halliburton on August 1, 2014, and CEO on June 1, 2017, replacing Dave Lesar.

== Business overview ==

=== Locations ===
The company has dual headquarters located in Houston and in Dubai, but it remains incorporated in the United States.

=== Divisions ===
Energy services (the company&#x27;s historical cornerstone), formation evaluation, digital and consulting services, production volume optimization, and fluid systems are the major business segments. These businesses continue to be profitable, and the company is one of the world&#x27;s largest players in these service industries; it is second after Schlumberger, and is followed by Saipem, Weatherford International, and Baker Hughes.

With the acquisition of Dresser Industries in 1998, the Kellogg-Brown &amp; Root division (in 2002 renamed to KBR) was formed by merging Halliburton&#x27;s Brown &amp; Root (acquired 1962) subsidiary and the M.W. Kellogg division of Dresser (which Dresser had merged with in 1988). KBR is a major international construction company that works in an industry that tends to have an element of volatility and is subject to significant fluctuations in revenue and profit. Asbestos-related litigation from Kellogg acquisition caused the company to book more than US$4.0 billion in losses from 2002 through 2004.

As a result of the asbestos-related costs and staggering losses on the Barracuda Caratinga FPSO construction project based in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Halliburton lost approximately $900 million U.S. a year from 2002 through 2004. A final non-appealable settlement in the asbestos case was reached in January 2005 which allowed Halliburton subsidiary KBR to exit Chapter 11 bankruptcy and returned the company to quarterly profitability. While Halliburton&#x27;s revenues have increased because of its contracts in the Middle East, the overall impact on its bottom line has been mixed.

At a meeting for investors and analysts in August 2004, a plan was outlined to divest the KBR division through a possible sale, spin-off or initial public offering. Analysts at Deutsche Bank valued KBR at up to $2.15 billion, while others believed it could be worth closer to $3 billion by 2005. KBR became a separately listed company on April 5, 2007.

== History ==

=== Early history (as HOWCO) ===
The company was started in 1919 by Erle P. Halliburton as the New Method Oil Well Cementing Company.

In 1920, he brought a wild gas well under control, using cement, for W.G. Skelly, near Wilson, Oklahoma. On March 1, 1921, the Halliburton &quot;method and means of excluding water from oil wells&quot; was assigned a patent from the U.S. Patent Office. Halliburton invented the revolutionary cement jet mixer, to eliminate hand-mixing of cement, and the measuring line, a tool used to guarantee cementing accuracy. By 1922, the Halliburton Oil Well Cementing Company (HOWCO) was prospering from the Mexia, Texas oil boom, having cemented its 500th well in late summer.

In 1924, the company was incorporated in Delaware, with 56 people on its payroll. The stock of the corporation was owned by Erle and Vida Halliburton and by seven major oil companies: Magnolia, Texas, Gulf, Humble, Sun, Pure and Atlantic.

In 1926, its first foreign venture began with sale of equipment to Burma and India.

Throughout the 1930s and 1940s, Halliburton continued cementing across America. In 1938, Halliburton cemented its first offshore well using a truck on a barge off the Louisiana coast. In 1940, Halliburton opened offices in Venezuela and introduced bulk handling of cementing to the industry. In 1947, the Halliburton first marine cementing vessel went into service.

In 1951, Halliburton first appeared in Europe as Halliburton Italiana SpA, a wholly owned subsidiary in Italy. Over the next seven years, Halliburton launched Halliburton Company Germany GmbH, set up operations in Argentina and established a subsidiary in England. By 1951, HOWCO had service centers operating in Canada, Venezuela, Peru, Colombia, Saudi Arabia and Indonesia. Halliburton revenues topped $100 million for the first time in 1952.

Erle P. Halliburton died in Los Angeles in 1957. HOWCO is at this time worth $190 million with camps all over the world. The same year, HOWCO purchased Welex, which pioneered jet perforation. Otis Engineering, an oil field service and equipment company specializing in manufacturing pressure control equipment for oil and gas producing wells, was acquired in 1959.

=== As Halliburton ===
On July 5, 1961, the company changed its name to the Halliburton Company. In 1963, Halliburton was the first company in Oklahoma to receive the Presidential &quot;E&quot; for Export flag in recognition of notable contributions to foreign trade.

Halliburton opened a manufacturing center in Duncan, Oklahoma, in 1964. The company began to experiment with new technologies to help their services – for example, beginning in 1965 a pilot operation of a computer network system – the first such installation in the oilfield services industry. In 1966, workers broke ground for a new wing at the Research Center in Duncan that tripled the available space for the Chemical Research and Design Department.

In 1968, an automated mixing system for drilling mud was developed by Halliburton, primarily for use offshore. Gearhart Industries (acquired by Halliburton Energy Services in 1989) introduced the first digital computer logging system in 1974.

In 1969, Halliburton began construction of a base camp at Prudhoe Bay on Alaska&#x27;s North Slope.

In 1975, it responded to environmental concerns by working with the nonprofit Clean Gulf Associates to contain and clean up oil spills. In 1976, Halliburton established the Halliburton Energy Institute in Duncan, Oklahoma, to provide an industry forum for disseminating technical information.
In 1980, Halliburton Research Center opened in Duncan, Oklahoma. The company&#x27;s billionth sack of cement for customers was pumped in 1983. In 1989, Halliburton acquired logging and perforating specialist company Gearhart Industries and combined it with its subsidiary Welex to form Halliburton Logging Services.

Throughout the 1980s, Halliburton&#x27;s subsidiaries continued their projects around the world (under management of former CEO Brian Darcy) even in countries once considered enemies. Equipment was provided for the first multiwell platform offshore China, and an Otis Engineering team controlled a gigantic Tengiz field blowout in the Soviet Union.

=== 1990s ===
Following the end of Operation Desert Storm in February 1991, the Pentagon, led by then defense secretary Dick Cheney, paid Halliburton subsidiary Brown &amp; Root Services over $8.5 million to study the use of private military forces with American soldiers in combat zones. Halliburton crews also helped bring 725 burning oil wells under control in Kuwait.

In 1995, Cheney replaced Thomas H. Cruikshank, as chairman and CEO. Cruikshank had served since 1989.

In the early 1990s, Halliburton was found to be in violation of federal trade barriers in Iraq and Libya, having sold these countries dual-use oil drilling equipment and, through its former subsidiary, Halliburton Logging Services, sending six pulse neutron generators to Libya. After having pleaded guilty, the company was fined $1.2 million, with another $2.61 million in penalties.

During the Balkans conflict in the 1990s, Kellogg Brown-Root (KBR) supported U.S. peacekeeping forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and Hungary with food, laundry, transportation, and other life-cycle management services.

In 1998, Halliburton merged with Dresser Industries, which included Kellogg. Prescott Bush was a director of Dresser Industries, which is now part of Halliburton; his son, former president George H. W. Bush, worked for Dresser Industries in several positions from 1948 to 1951, before he founded Zapata Corporation.

=== 2000s ===

&quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported in 2001 that a subsidiary of Halliburton Energy Services called Halliburton Products and Services Ltd. (HPS) opened an office in Tehran. The company, HPS, operated on the ninth floor of a new north Tehran tower block. Although HPS was incorporated in the Cayman Islands in 1975 and is &quot;non-American&quot;, it shares both the logo and name of Halliburton Energy Services and, according to Dow Jones Newswires, offers services from Halliburton units worldwide through its Tehran office. Such behavior, undertaken while senior Republican (later U.S. vice president) Dick Cheney was CEO of Halliburton, may have violated the Trading with the Enemy Act. A Halliburton spokesman, responding to inquiries from Dow Jones, said &quot;This is not breaking any laws. This is a foreign subsidiary and no U.S. person is involved in this. No U.S. person is facilitating any transaction. We are not performing directly in that country.&quot; No legal action has been taken against the company or its officials. Later, David J. Lesar, Halliburton&#x27;s chief executive, announced that Halliburton would withdraw from Iran.

In April 2002, KBR was awarded a $7 million contract to construct steel holding cells at Camp X-Ray.

In November 2002, KBR was tasked to plan oil well firefighting in Iraq, and in February 2003 was issued a contract to conduct the work. Critics contend that it was a no-bid contract, awarded due to Dick Cheney&#x27;s position as vice president. Concern was also expressed that the contract could allow KBR to pump and distribute Iraqi oil. Others contend, however, that this was not strictly a &quot;no-bid contract,&quot; and was invoked under a contract that KBR won &quot;in a competitive bid process.&quot; The contract, referred to as LOGCAP, is a contingency-based contract that is invoked at the convenience of the Army. Because the contract is essentially a retainer, specific orders are not competitively bid (as the overall contract was).

In May 2003, Halliburton revealed in SEC filings that its KBR subsidiary had paid a Nigerian official $2.4 million in bribes in order to receive favorable tax treatment., United Arab Emirates
In October 2004, after emerging from the bankruptcy protection, Halliburton opened a new facility on , replacing an older facility that opened in 1948, in Rock Springs, Wyoming. With over 500 employees, Halliburton is one of the largest private employers in Sweetwater County.

On January 24, 2006, Halliburton&#x27;s subsidiary KBR (formerly Kellogg, Brown and Root) announced that it had been awarded a $385 million contingency contract by the Department of Homeland Security to build &quot;temporary detention and processing facilities&quot; or internment camps. According to &quot;Business Wire&quot;, this contract will be executed in cooperation with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Fort Worth District. Critics point to the Guantanamo Bay detention camp as a possible model. According to a press release posted on the Halliburton website, &quot;The contract, which is effective immediately, provides for establishing temporary detention and processing capabilities to augment existing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Detention and Removal Operations (DRO) Program facilities in the event of an emergency influx of immigrants into the U.S., or to support the rapid development of new programs. The contingency support contract provides for planning and, if required, initiation of specific engineering, construction and logistics support tasks to establish, operate and maintain one or more expansion facilities.&quot;

In February 2008, a hard disk and two computers containing classified information were stolen from Petrobras while in Halliburton&#x27;s custody. Allegedly, the content inside the stolen material was data on the recently discovered Tupi oil field. Initial police inquiries suggest that it could be a common container theft operation. The container was a ramshackle in complete disorder indicating that thieves were after &quot;valuables and not only laptops,&quot; said an expert consulted by the daily newspaper Folha de S. Paulo.

In 2008, Halliburton agreed to outsource its mission-critical information technology infrastructure to a Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex data center operated by CyrusOne Networks LLC.

On May 14, 2010, President Barack Obama said in an interview with CNN that &quot;you had executives of BP and Transocean and Halliburton falling over each other to point the finger of blame at somebody else&quot; when referring to the congressional hearings held during the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. &quot;The American people could not have been impressed with that display, and I certainly wasn&#x27;t.&quot; According to Tim Probert, executive vice president of Halliburton, &quot;Halliburton, as a service provider to the well owner, is contractually bound to comply with the well owner&#x27;s instructions&quot;.

It was anticipated that Halliburton&#x27;s $2.5 billion &quot;Restore Iraqi Oil&quot; (RIO) contract would pay for itself as well as for reconstruction of the entire country. Plans called for more oil to be exported from Iraq&#x27;s northern oil fields than actually occurred. Halliburton&#x27;s work on the pipeline crossing the Tigris river at Al Fatah has been called a failure. Critics claim that the oil fields are barely usable and access to international markets is severely limited. As an example, against the advice of its own experts, Halliburton attempted to dig a tunnel through a geological fault zone. The underground terrain was a jumble of boulders, voids, cobblestones, and gravel and not appropriate for the kind of drilling Halliburton planned. &quot;No driller in his right mind would have gone ahead,&quot; said Army geologist Robert Sanders when the military finally sent people to inspect the work.

=== Proposed acquisition of Baker Hughes ===
On November 17, 2014, Halliburton and Baker Hughes jointly announced a definitive agreement under which Halliburton will, subject to the conditions set forth in the agreement, acquire Baker Hughes in a stock and cash transaction valued at $34.6 billion. A press release made available on the former&#x27;s website, as at December 11, 2014 detailed the restructuring in the integration to follow. The firm announced it would acquire Baker Hughes for around $35 billion in cash and stock, creating an oilfield services company that aims to compete with Schlumberger. Prior to the merger of Baker Hughes and Halliburton, Halliburton must divest over $5 billion of its assets according to the regulations created by US competition enforcement authorities. The merger had a deadline of the end of April 2016 after which, if a decision had not been made, both companies could walk away from the deal if they chose. At the beginning of May 2016, the day after the deadline expired, Halliburton and Baker Hughes announced the termination of the merger agreement.

=== Chemical plant in Saudi Arabia ===
On March 1, 2022, Halliburton inaugurated its MultiChem facility in Jubail PlasChem Park, which will make Saudi Arabia an exporter of specialty products from an importer of specialty products.

== Controversies and criticism ==
=== Iraq War ===
Halliburton has become the object of several controversies involving the Iraq War and the company&#x27;s ties to former U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney. Cheney retired from the company during the 2000 U.S. presidential election campaign with a severance package worth $36 million. As of 2004, he had received $398,548 in deferred compensation from Halliburton while Vice President. Cheney was chairman and CEO of Halliburton Company from 1995 to 2000 and has received stock options from Halliburton.

In the run-up to the Iraq War, Halliburton was awarded a $7 billion contract for which only Halliburton was allowed to bid.

Bunnatine Greenhouse, a civil servant with 20 years of contracting experience, had complained to Army officials on numerous occasions that Halliburton had been unlawfully receiving special treatment for work in Iraq, Kuwait and the Balkans. Criminal investigations were opened by the U.S. Justice Department, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Pentagon&#x27;s inspector general. These investigations found no wrongdoing within the contract award and execution process.

In one of Greenhouse&#x27;s claims, she said that military auditors caught Halliburton overcharging the Pentagon for fuel deliveries into Iraq. She also complained that Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld&#x27;s office took control of every aspect of Halliburton&#x27;s $7 billion Iraqi oil/infrastructure contract. Greenhouse was later demoted for poor performance in her position. Greenhouse&#x27;s attorney, Michael Kohn, portrayed her performance reviews as punishment for criticizing the administrations. He stated in &quot;The New York Times&quot; that &quot;she is being demoted because of her strict adherence to procurement requirements and the Army&#x27;s preference to sidestep them when it suits their needs.&quot;

=== Deepwater Horizon explosion ===
An internal report released in 2010 by BP into the Deepwater Horizon explosion claimed that poor practices of Halliburton staff had contributed to the disaster. Investigations carried out by the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling found that Halliburton was jointly at fault along with BP and Transocean for the spill. The cement that Halliburton used was an unstable mixture, and eventually caused hydrocarbons to leak into the well, causing the explosion that started the crisis.

Halliburton pleaded guilty to destroying evidence after the April 2010 Deepwater Horizon disaster; the company destroyed computer simulations it performed in the months after the accident, simulations that contradicted Halliburton&#x27;s claim that it was BP who had not followed Halliburton&#x27;s advice. BP had employed Halliburton to oversee the process by which cement is used to seal casing in oil and gas wells, thereby preventing leaks. Government investigators had ordered companies involved in drilling the well to preserve all relevant evidence.

=== Allegations of corruption in Nigeria ===
In early December 2010, the Nigerian government filed corruption charges against Cheney in connection with his role as the chief executive of Halliburton. The case relates to an alleged $182 million contract involving a four-company joint venture to build a liquefied natural gas plant on Bonny Island in southern Nigeria. Earlier in 2009, KBR, a former subsidiary of Halliburton, agreed to pay $402 million after admitting that it bribed Nigerian officials, and Halliburton paid $177 million to settle allegations by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission without admitting any wrongdoing. In mid-December 2010, the case was settled when Nigeria agreed to drop the corruption charges against Cheney and Halliburton in exchange for a $250 million settlement. According to Femi Babafemi, the spokesperson for the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, the $250 million would include approximately $130 million frozen in a Swiss bank, and the rest would be paid as fines.

The Federal Contractor Misconduct Database details 10 instances of misconduct since 1995 under which Halliburton has agreed to pay settlements of $791 million. A further 22 instances of misconduct relate to the company&#x27;s former subsidiary KBR.

=== Environmental issues ===
In 2002, Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) reports were completed to measure the amount of chemicals emitted from Halliburton&#x27;s Harris County, Texas facility. The TRI is a publicly available EPA database that contains information on toxic chemical releases and waste management activities reported annually by certain industries as well as federal facilities. The facility had 230 TRI air releases in 2001 and 245 in 2002.

On June 7, 2006, Halliburton&#x27;s Farmington, New Mexico facility created a toxic cloud that forced people to evacuate their homes.

Halliburton may also be implicated in the oil spills in the Timor Sea off Australia in August 2009 and in the Gulf of Mexico in April 2010 for improper cementing. Halliburton staff were employed on the Transocean operated &quot;Deepwater Horizon&quot; oil rig in the Mexican Gulf. Halliburton staff completed cementation of the final production well 20 hours prior to the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig explosion, but had not yet set the final.

In July 2013, Halliburton Co agreed to plead guilty to charges that it destroyed evidence relating to the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill. This incurred a $200,000 fine; the firm also agreed to three years of probation and to continue cooperating with the criminal probe into the spill. In September 2014, the company agreed to pay $1.1 billion in damages to settle the majority of claims against it relating to the explosion, removing the uncertainty which had hung over the company for the previous four years.

=== Jamie Leigh Jones incident ===
Jamie Leigh Jones testified at a Congressional hearing that she had been gang-raped by as many as seven co-workers in Iraq in 2005 when she was an employee of KBR, and then falsely imprisoned in a shipping container for 24 hours without food or drink. KBR was a subsidiary of Halliburton at the time. Jones and her lawyers said that 38 women have contacted her reporting similar experiences while working as contractors in Iraq, Kuwait, and other countries. On September 15, 2009, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor of Halliburton, in a 2 to 1 ruling, and found that her alleged injuries were not, in fact, in any way related to her employment and thus, not covered by the contract. This decision effectively meant that the mandatory arbitration clause in her contract did not apply.

These incidents have tainted the public perception of Halliburton, with a consumer study rating it as the fifth least reputable company in America.

=== Sale of KBR ===
On April 15, 2006, Halliburton filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to sell up to 20 percent of its KBR stock on the NYSE under the ticker symbol &quot;KBR&quot;, as part of an eventual plan for KBR to be a separate company from Halliburton.

In November 2006, Halliburton began selling its stake in KBR, its major subsidiary, and by February 2007 had completely sold off the subsidiary. In June 2007, several days after Stewart Bowen, the Special Inspector General, released a new report, the Army announced that KBR would share another $150 billion contract with two other contractors, Fluor and Dyncorp, over the next 10 years.

=== Baghdad incident ===
In accordance with the law of armed conflict and to maintain non-combatant status, Halliburton does not arm its truck drivers. Trucks are often the target of insurgent attacks. On September 20, 2005, a convoy of four Halliburton trucks was ambushed north of Baghdad. All four trucks were struck by improvised explosive devices and were disabled. Their US National Guard escort was thought to have abandoned the disabled vehicles, leaving the drivers defenseless. Three of the four truck drivers were killed by the insurgents while the surviving driver caught the event on video. Although the trucks had military camouflage paint, the drivers were civilian. The US military returned to the scene 45 minutes later. However, in a statement by senior military officials in Iraq, an investigation revealed that troops did not abandon the civilians and they were all exiting the &quot;kill zone&quot; during the ambush.

=== Restatements ===
On March 31, 2003, Management at Halliburton restated earnings downward by $14 million for the fourth quarter of 2002. In the restatement, an additional $3 million expense (net of tax) to continuing operations and an $11 million expense, net of tax, to discontinued operations were recorded. On March 2, 2005, Halliburton restated its 2004 fourth-quarter earnings to add $2 million US in after-tax losses to reflect the collection of a $10 million receivable that had been reserved and a correction in lease accounting.

=== Health impacts ===
Halliburton has been criticized for its impacts on public health and the environment, most notably with the passing of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, also known as the Halliburton loophole. This law notably exempted chemicals used during hydraulic fracturing from the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, Safe Drinking Water Act, and CERCLA (&quot;Superfund&quot;). As a result of this, fracking fluids did not have to be reported to the EPA, rendering the EPA unable to legally regulate or monitor them.

In 2020, it was reported that out of nine companies the EPA has asked full disclosure from with regards to the chemicals used in gas drilling, Halliburton was the only one that refused to comply.

=== Illegal retaliation against whistleblower ===
In 2015, after a decade-long legal battle, Halliburton was declared guilty for illegally retaliating against whistleblower Tony Menendez. Menendez had filed a case with the SEC over concerns that Halliburton was taking illegal actions to conceal billions of dollars; following this, Halliburton retaliated against Menendez in a number of ways, including stripping Menendez of his responsibilities and forbidding him from coming to most meetings.

==Corporate affairs==
=== Headquarters ===

Halliburton&#x27;s headquarters (North Belt Campus) are located in northern Houston, Texas, near George H.W. Bush Intercontinental Airport.

Halliburton was headquartered in Dallas, Texas, from 1961 to 2003. The company moved its headquarters from the Southland Life Building in Dallas to of space in Lincoln Plaza in Downtown Dallas in 1985. 20 employees worked in Halliburton&#x27;s headquarters in Dallas.

Halliburton planned to move its headquarters to Houston in 2002. Halliburton, which signed its lease to occupy a portion of 5 Houston Center in Downtown Houston in 2002, moved its headquarters there by July 2003. Halliburton occupied of space on the 24th floor in 5 Houston Center.

In 2009 Halliburton announced that it planned to move its headquarters to the North Belt Campus in Houston. In addition it planned to consolidate operations at its Westchase and North Belt Campus. The move occurred in 2009. The North Belt complex was to house 2,500 employees. Halliburton planned to add a research and development facility with laboratories, a new cafeteria, a childcare center, two additional parking garages, and fitness and wellness centers for employees. The plans for the North Belt Campus had been delayed by one year: the first phase of expansion and renovation was completed in 2012, and in 2014 new buildings, garage, cafeteria, and fitness centre were completed. The construction of the North Belt administration building is scheduled to begin in late 2010.

According to Marilyn Bayless, the president of the North Houston Greenspoint Chamber of Commerce, in 2003 Halliburton had planned to move operations out of the North Belt office because other area school districts offered the freeport tax exemptions while the Aldine Independent School District (AISD), where the North Belt office is located, did not. In order to attract businesses, in May 2003, AISD began offering the same tax exemption as other jurisdictions. Subsequently, Halliburton retained the North Belt office.

<text>USS &quot;Kansas&quot; (BB-21) was a US pre-dreadnought battleship, the fourth of six ships in the class. She was the second ship of the United States Navy named Kansas, but the only one named in honor of the state of Kansas. The ship was launched in August 1905 and commissioned into the fleet in April 1907. &quot;Kansas&quot; was armed with a main battery of four guns and was capable of a top speed of .

Shortly after she entered service, &quot;Kansas&quot; joined the Great White Fleet for its circumnavigation of the globe in 1908–1909. She made trips to Europe in 1910 and 1911 and after 1912, became involved in suppressing unrest in several Central American countries, including the United States occupation of Veracruz during the Mexican Revolution. After the United States entered World War I in April 1917, &quot;Kansas&quot; was employed as a training ship for new personnel. In September 1918, she began escorting convoys to Europe. After the war ended in November, she then began a series of trips to France to bring American soldiers home.

The ship&#x27;s postwar career was short. She conducted training cruises for US Naval Academy cadets in 1920 and 1921, the first to the Pacific and the second to Europe. During this period she served briefly as the flagship of the 4th Battleship Division. After returning from the second cruise, &quot;Kansas&quot; was decommissioned and sold for scrap in August 1923 according to the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty.

==Design==
The followed the s, but corrected some of the most significant deficiencies in the earlier design, most notably the superposed arrangement of the main and some of the secondary guns. A heavier tertiary battery of guns replaced the guns that had been used on all previous US designs. Despite the improvements, the ships were rendered obsolescent by the revolutionary British battleship , completed before most of the members of the &quot;Connecticut&quot; class.

&quot;Kansas&quot; was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of . She displaced as designed and up to at full load. The ship was powered by two-shaft triple-expansion steam engines rated at , with steam provided by twelve coal-fired Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers ducted into three funnels. The propulsion system generated a top speed of . As built, she was fitted with heavy military masts, but these were quickly replaced by lattice masts in 1909. As completed, she had a crew of 827 officers and men, though this increased to 881 and later to 896.

The ship was armed with a main battery of four 12 inch/45 Mark 5 guns in two twin gun turrets on the centerline, one forward and aft. The secondary battery consisted of eight /45 guns and twelve /45 guns. The 8-inch guns were mounted in four twin turrets amidships and the 7-inch guns were placed in casemates in the hull. For close-range defense against torpedo boats, she carried twenty /50 guns mounted in casemates along the side of the hull and twelve 3-pounder guns. She also carried four 1-pounder guns. As was standard for capital ships of the period, &quot;Kansas&quot; carried four 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes, submerged in her hull on the broadside.

&quot;Kansas&quot;″s main armored belt was thick over the magazines and the propulsion machinery spaces and elsewhere. The main battery gun turrets had thick faces, and the supporting barbettes had of armor plating. The secondary turrets had of frontal armor. The conning tower had thick sides.

==Service history==

===Construction and the Great White Fleet===
The keel for &quot;Kansas&quot; was laid down at the New York Shipbuilding Corporation of Camden, New Jersey. She was launched on 12 August 1905. After completing fitting-out work, the ship was commissioned into the fleet on 18 April 1907 in Philadelphia. Captain Charles E. Vreeland was the ship&#x27;s first commanding officer. She began a shakedown cruise on 17 August off Provincetown, Massachusetts, that revealed the need for modifications, which began at Philadelphia on 24 September. On 9 December, she joined the ships that would be assigned to the Great White Fleet in Hampton Roads.

On 16 December, &quot;Kansas&quot; steamed out of Hampton Roads with the Great White Fleet for a circumnavigation of the globe. The cruise of the Great White Fleet was conceived as a way to demonstrate American military power, particularly to Japan. Tensions had begun to rise between the United States and Japan after the latter&#x27;s victory in the Russo-Japanese War in 1905, particularly over racist opposition to Japanese immigration to the United States. The press in both countries began to call for war, and Roosevelt hoped to use the demonstration of naval might to deter Japanese aggression. The cruise was also intended to assert the United States&#x27; status as a global naval power and to convince Congress of the need to support increased naval expenditures. The fleet cruised south to the Caribbean and then to South America, making stops in Port of Spain, Rio de Janeiro, Punta Arenas, and Valparaíso, among other cities. After arriving in Mexico in March 1908, the fleet spent three weeks conducting gunnery practice The fleet then resumed its voyage up the Pacific coast of the Americas, stopping in San Francisco and Seattle before crossing the Pacific to Australia, stopping in Hawaii on the way. Stops in the South Pacific included Melbourne, Sydney, and Auckland. 

The fleet then turned north for the Philippines, stopping in Manila, before continuing on to Japan where a welcoming ceremony was held in Yokohama. Three weeks of exercises followed in Subic Bay in the Philippines in November. The ships passed Singapore on 6 December and entered the Indian Ocean; they coaled in Colombo before proceeding to the Suez Canal and coaling again at Port Said, Egypt. The fleet called in several Mediterranean ports before stopping in Gibraltar, where an international fleet of British, Russian, French, and Dutch warships greeted the Americans. The ships then crossed the Atlantic to return to Hampton Roads on 22 February 1909, having traveled . There, they conducted a naval review for President Theodore Roosevelt.

===Peacetime activities===
A week after returning from the voyage, &quot;Kansas&quot; steamed to the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard for an overhaul after the lengthy period at sea. The work was completed on 17 June, and &quot;Kansas&quot; thereafter began a peacetime routine of maneuvers and various training exercises that continued throughout the following year. On 15 November 1910, she joined the 2nd Battleship Division for a cruise to Europe, stopping in Cherbourg, France, and Portland, England. The ships then recrossed the Atlantic, stopping in Santo Domingo and Cuba before continuing on to Hampton Roads. A second trip to Europe took place in mid-1911; this time, the division steamed into the Baltic Sea, visiting several ports in the region, including Copenhagen, Denmark, Stockholm, Sweden, Kronstadt, Russia, and Kiel, Germany. The ships arrived back in Provincetown on 13 July and thereafter joined fleet training exercises off the Virginia Capes. &quot;Kansas&quot; steamed to the Norfolk Navy Yard on 3 November for another overhaul.

&quot;Kansas&quot; began a series of extensive maneuvers in early 1912, based out of Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. She returned to Hampton Roads to greet a squadron of German warships—the battlecruiser and the light cruisers and —that visited the port from 28 May to 8 June. &quot;Kansas&quot; then embarked on a training cruise along the east coast of the United States for midshipmen from the US Naval Academy on 21 June. She returned the midshipmen to Annapolis on 30 August. On 15 November, she began a training cruise to the Gulf of Mexico, arriving back in Philadelphia for an overhaul on 21 December. She returned to duty on 5 May 1913 and cruised the east coast for the next several months. On 25 October, she crossed the Atlantic and cruised the Mediterranean Sea, which included a stop in Genoa, Italy. After returning to Guantánamo Bay, she was sent to the coast of Mexico to protect US interests during the Mexican Revolution. The ship was back in Norfolk on 14 March 1914, and another overhaul at Philadelphia followed on 11 April. On 1 July, &quot;Kansas&quot; steamed out of Norfolk to carry the remains of the recently deceased Venezuelan ambassador to the United States back to his home country. She arrived in La Guaira on 14 July before returning to the Mexican coast to support the forces occupying Veracruz. She left the area on 29 October to respond to unrest in Port au Prince, Haiti, arriving on 3 November. She remained there for a month before departing on 1 December for Philadelphia. The ship then resumed the normal peacetime routine of training exercises off the east coast and off Cuba until 30 September 1916, when she underwent another overhaul in Philadelphia.

===World War I===

She was still in dry dock when the United States declared war on Germany on 6 April 1917. On 10 July, she was assigned to the 4th Battleship Division (4th BatDiv) and was tasked primarily with training naval personnel in the Chesapeake Bay. In September 1918, she was assigned to convoy escort duty, with the first such mission on 6 September. The ship departed with her sister ship and the dreadnought to protect a fast HX troopship convoy. On 16 September, the three battleships left the convoy in the Atlantic and steamed back to the United States, while other escorts brought the convoy into port. On the 17th, &quot;South Carolina&quot; slipped her starboard propeller, which forced her to reduce speed to using only the port shaft. &quot;Kansas&quot; and &quot;New Hampshire&quot; remained with &quot;South Carolina&quot; to escort her back to port. Convoy duty did not last long, as the Germans signed the Armistice that ended the war on 11 November.

Following the end of the war in November 1918, she joined the effort to return American soldiers from France, making five trips to Brest, France. The first of these took place in December; &quot;Kansas&quot; and the battleship departed on 10 December and arrived in Brest on the 22nd. The two ships embarked a total of 2,732 soldiers between them over the course of four days before departing for the return trip. A major overhaul at Philadelphia followed from 29 June 1919 to 17 May 1920. She then proceeded to Annapolis, arriving on the 20th and embarking midshipmen for another training cruise, this time to the Pacific Ocean. She passed through the Panama Canal and visited a number of ports on the west coast, including Honolulu, Seattle, San Francisco, and San Pedro. She left San Pedro on 11 August bound for the Panama Canal and crossed into the Caribbean for a stop at Guantánamo Bay. &quot;Kansas&quot; arrived back in Annapolis on 2 September, where she disembarked the midshipmen. Rear Admiral Charles Frederick Hughes raised his flag aboard &quot;Kansas&quot; in Philadelphia as the flagship of the 4th BatDiv.

The ship departed on 27 September for a cruise to the Caribbean. While in Grassey Bay, Bermuda on 2 October, Edward, Prince of Wales, visited the ship. On the 4th, she passed through the Panama Canal and steamed to American Samoa, stopping in Pago Pago, Samoa on 11 November. &quot;Kansas&quot; then visited Hawaii before crossing back through the Panama Canal and eventually returning to Philadelphia on 7 March 1921. Another midshipmen training cruise followed on 4 June; three other battleships joined her for a visit to European waters. Stops included Oslo, Norway, Lisbon, Portugal, and Gibraltar. They passed through Guantánamo Bay before returning to Annapolis on 28 August. A visit to New York followed from 3 to 19 September. She arrived back at Philadelphia the following day, where she was decommissioned on 16 December. &quot;Kansas&quot; was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 24 August 1923 in accordance with the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty and was subsequently broken up for scrap.

<text>Moriscos (, ; ; Spanish for &quot;Moorish&quot;) were former Muslims and their descendants whom the Catholic Church and Habsburg Spain commanded to forcibly convert to Christianity or face compulsory exile after Spain outlawed Islam. Spain had a sizeable Muslim population, the &quot;mudéjars&quot;, in the early 16th century.

The Iberian Union mistrusted Moriscos and feared that they would prompt new invasions from the Ottoman Empire after the Fall of Constantinople. So between 1609 and 1614 they began to expel them systematically from the various kingdoms of the Union. The most severe expulsions occurred in the eastern Kingdom of Valencia. The exact number of Moriscos present in Spain before the expulsion is unknown and can only be guessed based on official records of the edict of expulsion. Furthermore, the overall number who were able to avoid deportation is also unknown, with estimates on the proportion of those who avoided expulsion or returned to Spain ranging from 5% to 40%.

The large majority settled on the western fringe of the Ottoman Empire and the Kingdom of Morocco. The last mass prosecution against Moriscos for 
crypto-Islamic practices occurred in Granada in 1727, with most receiving relatively light sentences.

In Spanish, &quot;morisco&quot; was also used in official colonial-era documentation in Spanish America to denote mixed-race &quot;castas&quot;: the children of relations between Spanish men and women of mixed African-European ancestry.

==Name and etymology==
The label &quot;morisco&quot; for Muslims who converted to Christianity began to appear in texts in the first half of the sixteenth century, though the use of the term at this time was limited. Usage became widespread in Christian sources during the second half of the century, but it was unclear whether Moriscos adopted the term. In their texts, it was more common for them to speak of themselves simply as &quot;muslimes&quot; (Muslims); in later periods, they may have begun to accept the label. In modern times, the label is in widespread use in Spanish literature and adopted by other languages, including .

The word &quot;morisco&quot; appears in twelfth-century Castilian texts as an adjective for the noun &quot;moro&quot;. These two words are comparable to the English adjective &quot;Moorish&quot; and noun &quot;Moor&quot;. Mediaeval Castilians used the words in the general senses of &quot;Muslim&quot; or an &quot;Arabic-speaker&quot; as in the case of Muslim converts; the words continued to be used in these older meanings even after the more specific meaning of &quot;morisco&quot; (which does not have a corresponding noun) became widespread.

According to L. P. Harvey, the two different meanings have resulted in modern scholars misinterpreting historical texts. In the early years, the Christians called them &quot;new Christians,&quot; &quot;new converts&quot;, or &quot;new Christians, converted from Moors&quot; (&quot;nuevos christianos convertidos de moros&quot;; to distinguish from those converted from Judaism) to refer to this group.

In 1517, the word &quot;morisco&quot; became a &quot;category&quot; added to the array of cultural and religious identities that existed at the time, used to identify Muslim converts to Christianity in Granada and Castille. The term was a pejorative adaptation of the adjective &quot;morisco&quot; (&quot;Moorish&quot;). It soon became the standard term for referring to all former Spain Muslims.

In Spanish America, &quot;morisco&quot; (or &quot;morisca&quot;, in feminine form) was used to identify a racial category: a mixed-race &quot;casta&quot;, the child of a Spaniard (&quot;español&quot;) and a mulatto (offspring of a Spaniard and a &quot;negro&quot;, generally a lighter-complexioned person with some African ancestry). This was probably due to a perception that such individuals looked similar to North Africans, appearing mostly white but with a somewhat visible sub-Saharan African admixture. The term appears in colonial-era marriage registers identifying individuals and in eighteenth-century &quot;casta&quot; paintings. The term quadroon was a similar term for quarter-black people in English colonies.

==Demographics==
There is no universally agreed figure for the Morisco population. Estimates vary because of the lack of a precise census. In addition, the Moriscos avoided registration and the authorities and tried to appear as members of the majority Spanish population. Furthermore, populations would have fluctuated, due to such factors as birth rates, conquests, conversions, relocations, and emigration.

Historians generally agree that, based on expulsion records, around 275,000 Moriscos were expelled from Spain in the early 17th century. Historian L. P. Harvey in 2005 gave a range of 300,000 to 330,000 for the early 16th century; based on earlier estimates by Domínguez Ortiz and Bernard Vincent, who gave 321,000 for the period 1568–75, and 319,000 just before the expulsion in 1609. But, Christiane Stallaert put the number at around one million Moriscos at the beginning of the 16th century. Recent studies by Trevor Dadson on the expulsion of the Moriscos propose the figure of 500,000 just before the expulsion, consistent with figures given by other historians. Dadson concludes that, assuming the 275,000 figure from the official expulsion records is correct, around 40% of Spain&#x27;s Moriscos managed to avoid expulsions altogether. A further 20% managed to return to Spain in the years following their expulsion according to Dadson.

===Kingdom of Granada===

The Emirate of Granada was the last Muslim kingdom in the Iberian Peninsula, which surrendered in 1492 to the Catholic forces after a decade-long campaign. Granada was annexed to Castile as the Kingdom of Granada, and had a majority Muslim population of between 250,000 and 300,000. Initially, the Treaty of Granada guaranteed their rights to be Muslim but Cardinal Cisneros&#x27;s effort to convert the population led to a series of rebellions. The rebellions were suppressed, and afterwards the Muslims in Granada were given the choice to remain and accept baptism, reject baptism and be enslaved or killed, or to go into exile. The option of exile was often not feasible in practice, and hindered by the authorities. Shortly after the rebellions&#x27; defeat, the entire Muslim population of Granada had nominally become Christian.
Although they converted to Christianity, they maintained their existing customs, including their language, distinct names, food, dress and even some ceremonies. Many secretly practiced Islam, even as they publicly professed and practiced Christianity. This led the Catholic rulers to adopt increasingly intolerant and harsh policies to eradicate these practices. This culminated in Philip II&#x27;s &quot;Pragmatica&quot; of 1 January 1567, which ordered the Moriscos to abandon their customs, clothing and language. The &quot;Pragmatica&quot; triggered the Morisco revolts in 1568–71. The Spanish authorities quashed this rebellion, and at the end of the fighting, the authorities decided to expel the Moriscos from Granada and scatter them to the other parts of Castile. Between 80,000 and 90,000 Granadans were marched to cities and towns across Castile.

===Kingdom of Valencia===
In 1492, the Kingdom of Valencia, part of the Crown of Aragon, had the second largest Muslim population in Spain after Granada, which became nominally the largest after the forced conversions in Granada in 1502. The nobles of Valencia continued to allow Islam to be practiced until the 1520s, and, to some extent, the Islamic legal system to be preserved.

In the 1520s, the Revolt of the Brotherhoods broke out among the Christian subjects of Valencia. The rebellion bore an anti-Islamic sentiment, and the rebels forced Valencian Muslims to become Christians in the territories they controlled. The Muslims joined the Crown in suppressing the rebellion, playing crucial roles in several battles. After the rebellion was suppressed, King Charles V started an investigation to determine the validity of the conversions forced by the rebels. He ultimately upheld those conversions, therefore putting the force-converted subjects under the authority of the Inquisition, and issued declarations to the effect of forcing the conversion of the rest of the Muslims.

After the forced conversions, Valencia was the region where the remains of Islamic culture was the strongest. A Venetian ambassador in the 1570s said that some Valencian nobles &quot;had permitted their Moriscos to live almost openly as Mohammedans.&quot; Despite efforts to ban Arabic, it continued to be spoken until the expulsions. Valencians also trained other Aragonese Moriscos in Arabic and religious texts.

===Aragon and Catalonia===
Moriscos accounted for 20% of the population of the kingdom of Aragon, residing principally on the banks of the Ebro river and its tributaries. Unlike Granadan and Valencian Moriscos, they did not speak Arabic but, as vassals of the nobility, were granted the privilege to practice their faith relatively openly.

Places like Muel, Zaragoza, were inhabited fully by Moriscos, the only Old Christians were the priest, the notary and the owner of the tavern-inn. &quot;The rest would rather go on a pilgrimage to Mecca than Santiago de Compostela.&quot;

In Catalonia, Moriscos represented less than 2% of the population and were concentrated in the Low Ebro region, as well as in the city of Lleida and the towns of Aitona and Seròs, in the Low Segre region. They largely no longer spoke Arabic, but Catalan, and to a lesser extent also Castilian-Aragonese in Lleida.

===Castile, Extremadura and the rest of Andalusia===
The Crown of Castile included, besides the Kingdom of Granada, also Extremadura and the rest of modern-day Andalusia (the Kingdoms of Seville, Córdoba and Jaén). The Morisco population in most of this territory was more dispersed except in specific locations such as Villarrubia de los Ojos, Hornachos, Arévalo or the &quot;Señorío de las Cinco Villas&quot; in the southwestern part of the province of Albacete, where they were the majority or even the totality of the population. Castile&#x27;s Moriscos were highly integrated and practically indistinguishable from the Catholic population: they did not speak Arabic and a large number of them were genuine Christians. The mass arrival of the much more visible Morisco population deported from Granada to the lands under the Crown of Castile led to a radical change in the situation of Castilian Moriscos, despite their efforts to distinguish themselves from the Granadans. For example, marriages between Castilian Moriscos and &quot;old&quot; Christians were much more common than between Castilian and Granadan Moriscos. The town of Hornachos was an exception, not only because practically all of its inhabitants were Moriscos but because of their open practice of the Islamic faith and of their famed independent and indomitable nature. For this reason, the order of expulsion in Castile specifically targeted the &quot;Hornacheros&quot;, the first Castilian Moriscos to be expelled. They were exceptionally allowed to leave fully armed and were marched as an undefeated army to Seville and transported to Morocco. They maintained their combative nature overseas, founding the Corsary Republic of Bou Regreg and Salé in modern-day Morocco.

===Canary Islands===
The situation of the Moriscos in the Canary Islands was different from on continental Europe. They were not the descendants of Iberian Muslims but were Muslim Moors taken from Northern Africa in Christian raids (&quot;cabalgadas&quot;) or prisoners taken during the attacks of the Barbary pirates against the islands. In the Canary Islands, they were held as slaves or freed, gradually converting to Christianity, with some serving as guides in raids against their former homelands. When the king forbade further raids, the Moriscos lost contact with Islam and became a substantial part of the population of the islands, reaching one-half of the inhabitants of Lanzarote. Protesting their Christianity, they managed to avoid the expulsion that affected European Moriscos. Still subjected to the ethnic discrimination of the &quot;pureza de sangre&quot;, they could not migrate to the Americas or join many organizations. Later petitions allowed for their emancipation with the rest of the Canarian population.

== Religion ==
=== Christianity ===
While the Moors chose to leave Spain and emigrate to North Africa, the Moriscos accepted Christianity and gained certain cultural and legal privileges for doing so.

Many Moriscos became devout in their new Christian faith, and in Granada, many Moriscos became Christian martyrs, as they were killed by Muslims for refusing to renounce Christianity. In 16th century Granada, the Christian Moriscos chose the Virgin Mary as their patroness saint and developed Christian devotional literature with a Marian emphasis.

=== Islam ===

Because conversions to Christianity were decreed by law rather than by their own will, some Moriscos still genuinely believed in Islam. Because of the danger associated with practicing Islam, however, the religion was largely practiced clandestinely. A legal opinion, called &quot;the Oran fatwa&quot; by modern scholars, circulated in Spain and provided religious justification for outwardly conforming to Christianity while maintaining an internal conviction of faith in Islam, when necessary for survival. The fatwa affirmed the regular obligations of a Muslim, including salah (ritual prayer) and zakat (almsgiving). However, the obligation might be fulfilled in a relaxed manner (e.g., the fatwa mentioned making the ritual prayer &quot;even though by making some slight movement&quot; and the ritual alms by &quot;showing generosity to a beggar&quot;). The fatwa also allowed Muslims to perform acts normally forbidden in Islamic law, such as consuming pork and wine, calling Jesus the son of God, and blaspheming against Muhammad as long as they maintained conviction against such acts.

The writing of a Morisco crypto-Muslim author known as the &quot;Young Man of Arévalo&quot; included accounts of his travel around Spain, his meetings with other clandestine Muslims and descriptions of their religious practices and discussions. The writing referred to the practice of secret congregational prayer, collecting alms to perform the Hajj (although it is unclear whether the journey was ultimately achieved), and the determination and hope to reinstitute the full practice of Islam as soon as possible. The Young Man wrote at least three extant works, &quot;Brief compendium of our sacred law and sunnah&quot;, the &quot;Tafsira&quot; and &quot;Sumario de la relación y ejercio espiritual&quot;, all written in Spanish with Arabic script (&quot;aljamiado&quot;), and primarily about religious topics.

Extant copies of the Qur&#x27;an have also been found from the Morisco period, although many are not complete copies but selections of surat, which were easier to hide. Other surviving Islamic religious materials from this period include collections of hadiths, stories of the prophets, Islamic legal texts, theological works (including al-Ghazali&#x27;s works), as well as polemical literature defending Islam and criticizing Christianity.

The Moriscos also likely wrote the Lead Books of Sacromonte, texts written in Arabic claiming to be Christian sacred books from the first century AD. Upon their discovery in the mid-1590s, the books were initially greeted enthusiastically by the Christians of Granada and treated by the Christian authorities as genuine, causing a sensation throughout Europe due to their (ostensibly) ancient origin. Hispano-Arabic historian Leonard Patrick Harvey proposed that the Moriscos wrote these texts in order to infiltrate Christianity from within, by emphasizing aspects of Christianity which were acceptable to Muslims. The content of the text was superficially Christian and did not refer to Islam at all, but contained many &quot;Islamizing&quot; features. The text never featured the Trinity doctrine or referred to Jesus as Son of God, concepts which are blasphemous and offensive in Islam. Instead, it repeatedly stated &quot;There is no god but God and Jesus is the Spirit of God (&quot;ruh Allah&quot;)&quot;, which is unambiguously close to the Islamic shahada and referred to the Qur&#x27;anic epithet for Jesus, &quot;the Spirit from him [God]&quot;. It contained passages which appeared (unbeknownst to the Christians at the time) to implicitly predict the arrival of Muhammad by mentioning his various Islamic epithets.

In many ways, their situation was comparable to that of the Marranos, secret Jews who lived in Spain at the same time.

==Timeline==
=== Conquest of al-Andalus ===
Islam had been present in Spain since the Umayyad conquest of Hispania in the eighth century. At the beginning of the twelfth century, the Muslim population in the Iberian Peninsula – called &quot;Al-Andalus&quot; by the Muslims – was estimated to number as high as 5.5 million, among whom were Arabs, Berbers and indigenous converts. In the next few centuries, as the Christians pushed from the north in a process called &quot;Reconquista&quot;, the Muslim population declined. At the end of the fifteenth century, the &quot;Reconquista&quot; culminated in the fall of Granada and the total number of Muslims in Spain was estimated at between 500,000 and 600,000 out of the total Spanish population of 7 to 8 million. Approximately half of the remaining Muslims lived in the former Emirate of Granada, the last independent Muslim state in Spain, which was annexed by the Crown of Castile. About 20,000 Muslims lived in other territories of Castile, and most of the remainder lived in the territories of the Crown of Aragon. Prior to this in Castile 200,000 of the 500,000 Muslims had been forcibly converted; 200,000 had left and 100,000 had died or been enslaved.

The Christians called the defeated Muslims who came under their rule the &quot;Mudéjars&quot;. Prior to the completion of the &quot;Reconquista&quot;, they were generally given freedom of religion as terms of their surrender. For example, the Treaty of Granada, which governed the surrender of the emirate, guaranteed a set of rights to the conquered Muslims, including religious tolerance and fair treatment, in return for their capitulation.

===Forced conversions of Muslims===
When efforts by Granada&#x27;s first archbishop, Hernando de Talavera for conversion to Christianity, were less than successful, Cardinal Jimenez de Cisneros took stronger measures: forced conversions, burning Islamic texts, and prosecution of many of Granada&#x27;s Muslims. In response to these and other violations of the Treaty, Granada&#x27;s Muslim population rebelled in 1499. The revolt lasted until early 1501, giving the Castilian authorities an excuse to void the terms of the Treaty for Muslims. In 1501 the terms of the Treaty of Granada protections were abandoned.

In 1501 Castilian authorities delivered an ultimatum to Granada&#x27;s Muslims: either convert to Christianity or be expelled. Most did convert, in order not to have their property and small children taken away from them. Many continued to dress in their traditional fashion, speak Arabic, and secretly practiced Islam (crypto-Muslims). The 1504 Oran fatwa provided scholarly religious dispensations and instructions about secretly practicing Islam while outwardly practicing Christianity. With the decline of Arabic culture, many used the &quot;aljamiado&quot; writing system, i.e., Castilian or Aragonese texts in Arabic writing with scattered Arabic expressions. In 1502, Queen Isabella I of Castile formally rescinded tolerance of Islam for the entire Crown of Castile. In 1508, Castilian authorities banned traditional Granadan clothing. With the 1512 Spanish invasion of Navarre, the Muslims of Navarre were ordered to convert or leave by 1515.

However, King Ferdinand, as ruler of the Crown of Aragon, continued to tolerate the large Muslim population living in his territory. Since the Crown of Aragon was juridically independent of Castile, their policies towards Muslims could and did differ during this period. Historians have suggested that the Crown of Aragon was inclined to tolerate Islam in its realm because the landed nobility there depended on the cheap, plentiful labor of Muslim vassals. However, the landed elite&#x27;s exploitation of Aragon&#x27;s Muslims also exacerbated class resentments. In the 1520s, when Valencian guilds rebelled against the local nobility in the Revolt of the Brotherhoods, the rebels &quot;saw that the simplest way to destroy the power of the nobles in the countryside would be to free their vassals, and this they did by baptizing them.&quot; The Inquisition and monarchy decided to prohibit the forcibly baptized Muslims of Valencia from returning to Islam. Finally, in 1526, King Charles V issued a decree compelling all Muslims in the crown of Aragon to convert to Catholicism or leave the Iberian Peninsula (Portugal had already expelled or forcibly converted its Muslims in 1497 and established its own Inquisition in 1536).

===After the conversion===
In Granada for the first decades after the conversion, the former Muslim elites of the former Emirate became the middlemen between the crown and the Morisco population. A certain religious tolerance, too, was still observable during the first half of the 16th century. They became &quot;alguaciles&quot;, &quot;hidalgos&quot;, courtiers, advisors to the royal court and translators of Arabic. They helped collect taxes; taxes from Granada made up one-fifth of Castile&#x27;s income, and became the advocates and defenders of Moriscos within royal circles. Some of them became genuine Christians while others secretly continued to be Muslims. The Islamic faith and tradition were more persistent among the Granadan lower class, both in the city and in the countryside. The city of Granada was divided into Morisco and Old Christian quarters, and the countryside often had alternating zones dominated by Old or New Christians. Royal and Church authorities tended to ignore the secret but persistent Islamic practices and traditions among some of the Morisco population.

Outside Granada, the role of advocates and defenders were taken by the Morisco&#x27;s Christian lords. In areas with high Morisco concentration, such as the Kingdom of Valencia and certain areas of other kingdoms, former Muslims played an important role in the economy, especially in agriculture and crafts. Consequently, the Christian lords often defended their Moriscos, sometimes to the point of being targeted by the Inquisition. For example, the Inquisition sentenced Sancho de Cardona, Admiral of Aragon, to life imprisonment after he was accused of allowing the Moriscos to openly practice Islam, build a mosque and openly made the &quot;adhan&quot; (call to prayer). The Duke of Segorbe (later Viceroy of Valencia) allowed his vassal in the Vall d&#x27;Uixó to operate a &quot;madrassa&quot;. A witness recalled one of his vassals saying that &quot;we live as Moors and no one dares to say anything to us&quot;. A Venetian ambassador in the 1570s said that some Valencian nobles &quot;had permitted their Moriscos to live almost openly as Mohammedans.&quot;

In 1567, Philip II directed Moriscos to give up their Arabic names and traditional dress, and prohibited the use of the Arabic language. In addition, the children of Moriscos were to be educated by Catholic priests. In reaction, there was a Morisco uprising in the Alpujarras from 1568 to 1571.

===Expulsion===
At the instigation of the Duke of Lerma and the Viceroy of Valencia, Archbishop Juan de Ribera, Philip III expelled the Moriscos from Spain between 1609 (Aragon) and 1614 (Castile). They were ordered to depart &quot;under the pain of death and confiscation, without trial or sentence... to take with them no money, bullion, jewels or bills of exchange... just what they could carry.&quot; Estimates for the number expelled have varied, although contemporary accounts set the number at between 270,000 and 300,000 (about 4% of the Spanish population).

The majority were expelled from the Crown of Aragon (modern day Aragon, Catalonia and Valencia), particularly from Valencia, where Morisco communities remained large, visible and cohesive; and Christian animosity was acute, particularly for economic reasons. Some historians have blamed the subsequent economic collapse of the Spanish Eastern Mediterranean coast on the region&#x27;s inability to replace Morisco workers successfully with Christian newcomers. Many villages were totally abandoned as a result. New laborers were fewer in number and were not as familiar with local agricultural techniques.

In the Crown of Castile (including Andalusia, Murcia and the former kingdom of Granada), by contrast, the scale of Morisco expulsion was much less severe. This was due to the fact that their presence was less felt as they were considerably more integrated in their communities, enjoying the support and sympathy from local Christian populations, authorities and, in some occasions, the clergy. Furthermore, the internal dispersion of the more distinct Morisco communities of Granada throughout Castile and Andalusia after the War of the Alpujarras, made this community of Moriscos harder to track and identify, allowing them to merge with and disappear into the wider society.
Although many Moriscos were sincere Christians, adult Moriscos were often assumed to be covert Muslims (i.e. crypto-Muslims), but expelling their children presented the government with a dilemma. As the children had all been baptized, the government could not legally or morally transport them to Muslim lands. Some authorities proposed that children should be forcibly separated from their parents, but sheer numbers showed this to be impractical. Consequently, the official destination of the expellees was generally stated to be France (more specifically Marseille). After the assassination of Henry IV in 1610, about 150,000 Moriscos were sent there. Many of the Moriscos migrated from Marseille to other lands in Christendom, including Italy and Sicily, or Constantinople. Estimates of returnee numbers vary, with historian Earl Hamilton believing that as many as a quarter of those expelled may have returned to Spain.

A number of the refugees settled in Muslim-held lands, mostly in the Ottoman Empire, in Algeria, Tunisia or Morocco; many of them came to Galata in the Ottoman Empire – from 1609 to the 1620s, many Moriscos settled there.

==International relations==

French Huguenots were in contact with the Moriscos in plans against the House of Habsburg which ruled Spain in the 1570s. Around 1575, plans were made for a combined attack of 
Aragonese Moriscos and Huguenots from Béarn under Henri de Navarre against Spanish Aragon, in agreement with the king of Algiers and the Ottoman Empire, but these projects floundered with the arrival of John of Austria in Aragon and the disarmament of the Moriscos. In 1576, the Ottomans planned to send a three-pronged fleet from Constantinople, to disembark between Murcia and Valencia; the French Huguenots would invade from the north and the Moriscos accomplish their uprising, but the Ottoman fleet failed to arrive.

Spanish spies reported that the Ottoman Emperor Selim II was planning to attack Malta, and from there advance to Spain. It was reported Selim wanted to incite an uprising among Spanish Moriscos. In addition, &quot;some four thousand Turks and Berbers had come into Spain to fight alongside the insurgents in the Alpujarras&quot;, a region near Granada and an obvious military threat. &quot;The excesses committed on both sides were without equal in the experience of contemporaries; it was the most savage war to be fought in Europe that century.&quot; After the Castilian forces defeated the Islamic insurgents, they expelled some eighty thousand Moriscos from the Granada Province. Most settled elsewhere in Castile. The &#x27;Alpujarras Uprising&#x27; hardened the attitude of the monarchy. As a consequence, the Spanish Inquisition increased prosecution and persecution of Moriscos after the uprising.

==Literature==
Miguel de Cervantes&#x27; writings, such as &quot;Don Quixote&quot; and &quot;Conversation of the Two Dogs&quot;, offer ambivalent views of Moriscos.
In the first part of &quot;Don Quixote&quot; (before the expulsion), a Morisco translates a found document containing the Arabic &quot;history&quot; that Cervantes is merely &quot;publishing&quot;. In the second part, after the expulsion, Ricote is a Morisco and a former neighbor of Sancho Panza. He cares more about money than religion, and left for Germany, from where he returned as a false pilgrim to unbury his treasure. He admits, however, the righteousness of their expulsion. His daughter Ana Félix is brought to Berbery but suffers since she is a sincere Christian.

Toward the end of the 16th century, Morisco writers challenged the perception that their culture was alien to Spain. Their literary works expressed early Spanish history in which Arabic-speaking Spaniards played a positive role. Chief among such works is &quot;Verdadera historia del rey don Rodrigo&quot; by (c. 1545–1615).

==Aftermath==

Scholars have noted that many Moriscos joined the Barbary Corsairs, who had a network of bases from Morocco to Libya and often attacked Spanish shipping and the Spanish coast. In the Corsair Republic of Sale, they became independent of Moroccan authorities and profited from trade and piracy.

Morisco mercenaries in the service of the Moroccan sultan, using arquebuses, crossed the Sahara and conquered Timbuktu and the Niger Curve in 1591. Their descendants formed the ethnic group of the Arma. A Morisco worked as a military advisor to Sultan Al-Ashraf Tumanbay II of Egypt (the last Egyptian Mamluk Sultan) during his struggle against the Ottoman invasion in 1517, led by Sultan Selim I. The Morisco military advisor advised Sultan Tumanbay to use infantry armed with guns instead of depending on cavalry. Arabic sources recorded that Moriscos of Tunisia, Libya and Egypt joined Ottoman armies. Many Moriscos of Egypt joined the army in the time of Muhammad Ali of Egypt.
Modern studies in population genetics have attributed unusually high levels of recent North African ancestry in modern Spaniards to Moorish settlement during the Islamic period and, more specifically, to the substantial proportion of Morisco population which remained in Spain and avoided expulsion.

===Moriscos in Spain after the expulsion===
It is impossible to know how many Moriscos remained after the expulsion, with traditional Spanish historiography considering that none remained and initial academic estimates such as those of Lapeyre offering figures as low as ten or fifteen thousand remaining. However, recent studies have been challenging the traditional discourse on the supposed success of the expulsion in purging Spain of its Morisco population. Indeed, it seems that expulsion met widely differing levels of success, particularly between the two major Spanish crowns of Castile and Aragón and recent historical studies also agree that both the original Morisco population and the number of them who avoided expulsion is higher than was previously thought.

One of the earliest re-examinations of Morisco expulsion was carried out by Trevor J. Dadson in 2007, devoting a significant section to the expulsion in Villarrubia de los Ojos in southern Castille. Villarubia&#x27;s entire Morisco population were the target of three expulsions which they managed to avoid or from which they succeeded in returning from to their town of origin, being protected and hidden by their non-Morisco neighbours. Dadson provides numerous examples, of similar incidents throughout Spain whereby Moriscos were protected and supported by non-Moriscos and returned en masse from North Africa, Portugal or France to their towns of origin.

A similar study on the expulsion in Andalusia concluded it was an inefficient operation which was significantly reduced in its severity by resistance to the measure among local authorities and populations. It further highlights the constant flow of returnees from North Africa, creating a dilemma for the local inquisition who did not know how to deal with those who had been given no choice but to convert to Islam during their stay in Muslim lands as a result of the Royal Decree. Upon the coronation of Philip IV, the new king gave the order to desist from attempting to impose measures on returnees and in September 1628 the Council of the Supreme Inquisition ordered inquisitors in Seville not to prosecute expelled Moriscos &quot;unless they cause significant commotion.&quot;

An investigation published in 2012 sheds light on the thousands of Moriscos who remained in the province of Granada alone, surviving both the initial expulsion to other parts of Spain in 1571 and the final expulsion of 1604. These Moriscos managed to evade in various ways the royal decrees, hiding their true origin thereafter. More surprisingly, by the 17th and 18th centuries much of this group accumulated great wealth by controlling the silk trade and also holding about a hundred public offices. Most of these lineages were nevertheless completely assimilated over generations despite their endogamic practices. A compact core of active crypto-Muslims was prosecuted by the Inquisition in 1727, receiving comparatively light sentences. These convicts kept alive their identity until the late 18th century.

The attempted expulsion of Moriscos from Extremadura was deemed a failure, with the exception of the speedy expulsion of the Moriscos of the town of Hornachos who would become the founders of the Republic of Salé in modern-day Morocco. Extremaduran Moriscos benefited from systematic support from authorities and society throughout the region and numerous Moriscos avoiding deportation while whole communities such as those of Alcántara temporarily shifted across the border to Portugal only to return later. The expulsion between 1609–1614, therefore, did not come close to its objective of eliminating Morisco presence from the region.

Similar patterns are observed in a detailed examination of the Expulsion in the southeastern Region of Murcia, large swathes of which were of Morisco majority. Morisco integration had reached high levels at the time of expulsion, they formed a strong socio-economic block with complex family ties and good-neighbourly relations. This resulted in the possibility of return, with few exceptions, to be offered and taken by a majority of Moriscos expelled. Although some were initially persecuted upon return, by 1622 they were no longer given any trouble from authorities.

Recent genetic studies of North African admixture among modern-day Spaniards have found high levels of North African (Berber) and Sub-Saharan African admixture among Spanish and Portuguese populations as compared to the rest of southern and western Europe, and such admixture does not follow a North-South gradient as one would initially expect, but more of an East-West one.

While the descendants of those Moriscos who fled to North Africa have remained strongly aware and proud of their Andalusi roots, the Moriscos&#x27; identity as a community was wiped out in Spain, be it via either expulsion or absorption by the dominant culture. Nevertheless, a journalistic investigation over the past years has uncovered existing communities in rural Spain (more specifically in the provinces of Murcia and Albacete) which seem to have maintained traces of their Islamic or Morisco identity, secretly practicing a debased form of Islam as late as the 20th century, as well as conserving Morisco customs and unusual Arabic vocabulary in their speech.

The ineffectiveness of the expulsion in the lands of Castile nevertheless contrasts with that of the Crown of Aragón (modern day Catalonia, Aragón and Valencian Community) in Eastern Spain. Here the expulsion was accepted much more wholeheartedly and instances of evasion and/or return have so far not been considered demographically important. This explains why Spain was not affected on the whole by the expulsion whereas the Valencian Community was devastated and never truly recovered as an economic or political powerhouse of the kingdom, ceding its position, within the Crown of Aragón, to the Catalan counties to the north, which never had a sizeable Morisco population to begin with.

===Modern-day ethnicities in Spain associated with Moriscos===
A number of ethnicities in northern Spain have historically been suspected of having Morisco roots. Among them are the Vaqueiros de Alzada of Asturias, the Mercheros (present throughout northern and western Spain), the Pasiegos of the Pas Valley in the mountains of Cantabria and the Maragatos of the Maragatería region of Leon. Genetic studies have been performed on the latter two, both showing higher levels of North African ancestry than the average for Iberia, although only in the case of the Pasiegos was there a clear differentiation from adjacent populations.

===Moriscos and population genetics===

Spain&#x27;s Morisco population was the last population who self-identified and traced its roots to the various waves of Muslim conquerors from North Africa. Historians generally agree that, at the height of Muslim rule, Muladis or Muslims of pre-Islamic Iberian origin were likely to constitute the large majority of Muslims in Spain, with over 75% of Al-Andalusian Iberians estimated to have converted by the 11th century. Studies in population genetics which aim to ascertain Morisco ancestry in modern populations search for Iberian or European genetic markers among contemporary Morisco descendants in North Africa, and for North African genetic markers among modern day Spaniards.

A wide number of recent genetic studies of modern-day Spanish and Portuguese populations have ascertained significantly higher levels of North African admixture in the Iberian peninsula than in the rest of the European continent. which is generally attributed to Islamic rule and settlement of the Iberian peninsula. Common North African genetic markers which are relatively high frequencies in the Iberian peninsula as compared to the rest of the European continent are Y-chromosome E1b1b1b1(E-M81) and Macro-haplogroup L (mtDNA) and U6. Studies coincide that North African admixture tends to increase in the south and west of the peninsula, peaking in parts of Andalusia, Extremadura, Southern Portugal and Western Castile. Distribution of North African markers are largely absent from the northeast of Spain as well as the Basque country. The uneven distribution of admixture in Spain has been explained by the extent and intensity of Islamic colonization in a given area, but also by the varying levels of success in attempting to expel the Moriscos in different regions of Spain, as well as forced and voluntary Morisco population movements during the 16th and 17th centuries.

As for tracing Morisco descendants in North Africa, to date there have been few genetic studies of populations of Morisco origin in the Maghreb region, although studies of the Moroccan population have not detected significant recent genetic inflow from the Iberian peninsula. A recent study of various Tunisian ethnic groups has found that all were indigenous North African, including those who self-identified as Andalusians.

===Descendants and Spanish citizenship===
In October 2006, the Andalusian Parliament asked the three parliamentary groups that form the majority to support an amendment that would ease the way for Morisco descendants to gain Spanish citizenship. It was originally made by IULV-CA, the Andalusian branch of the United Left. The proposal was refused.

Spanish Civil Code Art. 22.1 do provide concessions to nationals of the Ibero-American countries, Andorra, the Philippines, Equatorial Guinea, and Portugal, specifically it enables them to seek citizenship after two years rather than the usual ten years required for residence in Spain. Additionally similar concessions were provided later to the descendants of Sephardic Jews.

According to the President of Andalusi Historical Memory Association, Nayib Loubaris, this measure could potentially cover as many as 600 families of Morisco origin in what today is Morocco, who would have moved to Rabat and various other cities across the country. Such families are easily recognizable by their Spanish surnames such as Torres, Loubaris (from Olivares), Bargachi (from Vargas), Buano (from Bueno), Sordo, Denia, and Lucas. Earlier estimates had involved much larger figures of potential descendants (up to 5 million in Morocco and an indeterminate number from other Muslim countries).

Since 1992 some Spanish and Moroccan historians and academics have been demanding equitable treatment for Moriscos similar to that offered to Sephardic Jews. The bid was welcomed by Mansur Escudero, the chairman of the Islamic Council of Spain.

<doc id="203261" wikidata="Q981479" url="?curid=203261" title="Carl Icahn">
<text>Carl Celian Icahn (; born February 16, 1936) is an American businessman and investor. He is the founder and controlling shareholder of Icahn Enterprises, a public company and diversified conglomerate holding company based in Sunny Isles Beach, Florida. Icahn&#x27;s business model is to take large stakes in companies that he believes will appreciate from changes to corporate policy. Subsequently, Icahn then pressures management to make the changes that he believes will benefit shareholders, and him. Widely regarded as one of the most successful hedge fund managers of all time and one of the greatest investors on Wall Street, he was one of the first activist shareholders and is credited with making that investment strategy mainstream for hedge funds.

In the 1980s, Icahn developed a reputation as a &quot;corporate raider&quot; after profiting from the hostile takeover and asset stripping of Trans World Airlines.

Icahn is on the &quot;Forbes&quot; 400 and has a net worth of approximately $6.7 billion to $7 billion.

Since 2011, Icahn no longer manages money for outside clients. Investors can still invest in Icahn Enterprises.

==Early life and education==
Icahn was born in Brooklyn to an Ashkenazi Jewish family. He was raised in the Far Rockaway neighborhood of Queens in New York City, where he attended Far Rockaway High School. His father, Michael Icahn, a &quot;sworn atheist&quot;, was a cantor, and later a substitute teacher. His mother, Bella (née Schnall) also worked as a schoolteacher.

Icahn graduated from Princeton University with an A.B. in philosophy in 1957 after completing a senior thesis titled &quot;The Problem of Formulating an Adequate Explication of the Empiricist Criterion of Meaning.&quot; He entered New York University School of Medicine, but dropped out after two years to join the Army Reserve.

==Business career==
===1961–2005===

In 1961, Icahn began his career as a stockbroker for Dreyfus Corporation. In 1963, he became an options manager for Tessel, Patrick &amp; Co. and then he moved to Gruntal &amp; Co.

In 1968, with $150,000 of his own money and a $400,000 investment from his uncle, M. Elliot Schnall, Icahn bought a seat on the New York Stock Exchange and formed Icahn &amp; Co., which focused on risk arbitrage and options trading.

In 1978, in his first takeover attempt, he took a controlling stake in Tappan and forced the sale of the company to Electrolux, making a profit of $2.7 million, or doubling his investment. In 1979, he acquired Bayswater Realty &amp; Capital Corporation. In 1983, he acquired ACF Industries and in 1985 he sold those shares to Phillips Petroleum, making a $50 million profit.

In 1985, by pooling his funds with investor funds and funds borrowed from banks, Icahn acquired 50% of Trans World Airlines, and he completely acquired the company in a leveraged buyout in 1988. Icahn systematically sold TWA&#x27;s assets to repay money he owed, which was described as &quot;asset stripping&quot; and made him known as a &quot;corporate raider&quot;. In 1991, he sold TWA&#x27;s London routes to American Airlines for $445 million. Icahn made a $469 million profit, and left TWA with $540 million in debt. He formed lowestfare.com to sell TWA tickets and acquired portions of Global Leisure Travel from Ramy El-Batrawi.

In October 1986, Icahn launched an unsuccessful $8 billion hostile takeover for 89% of U.S. Steel; the bid was dropped in January 1987. In 1991, he sold his stake in the company for $1 billion, making a $200 million profit.

In June 1989, in the largest share sale to date on the New York Stock Exchange, Icahn sold his stake in Texaco for $2 billion, making a profit of $700 million.

In 1990, he offered to acquire Pan Am for $375 million.

In 1994, he took a 6.6% interest in Western Company of North America as it was in the process of being acquired by BJ Services.

In February 1997, Icahn sold his 7.3% interest in RJR Nabisco for a $125 million profit.

In June 1997, Icahn took control of Marvel Comics in a rivalry with Ronald Perelman.

In March 1998, he again bid for Pan Am, offering $43 million.

In December 1998, Icahn led an investor group that acquired a 5% stake in RJR Nabisco and pressured the company&#x27;s management to separate its tobacco and food units.

In July 2001, Icahn&#x27;s Riverdale, LLC lent Genesisintermedia $100 million and received options to purchase 5.5 million shares of the company at an average price of $5.09.

In 2004, Icahn began raising $3 billion to form Icahn Partners, a hedge fund. He took ownership stakes in Blockbuster Video and Time Warner.

In 2004, after Mylan announced a $4 billion stock deal to acquire King Pharmaceuticals, Icahn purchased a large block of stock and threatened a proxy fight, urging shareholders to vote against the acquisition. In February 2005, Mylan gave up its efforts to acquire King.

===2005–2010===
In 2005, XO Communications announced its intention to sell the wired part of its business for $700 million to Icahn, who was then chairman and a large shareholder; the money would be used to pay back its debts and to buy back its preferred stock for about $600 million from Icahn. Icahn would have then owned the wired business outright, and still own his 60% stake in XO. Despite Icahn&#x27;s majority ownership and the board of directors declaring the deal to be in the best interest of shareholders, R2 and other minority shareholders blocked the transaction through the court system in 2008, which charged Icahn with penalties due to his conflict of interest.

In August 2006, Icahn bought stock in Take-Two Interactive, a video game publisher, and increased his holdings to 11.3% in 2009, becoming the company&#x27;s second-largest shareholder.

In January 2007, he purchased a 9.2% stake in Telik, a biotech company engaged in cancer research. He also acquired 6.1 million shares of WCI Communities, later acquired by Lennar.

In May 2007, Icahn lost an election for a seat on the board of directors of Motorola, despite owning 3% of the company.

On February 9, 2007, Lear Corporation&#x27;s board of directors accepted a $2.3 billion takeover offer from Icahn.

That month he also invested $50 million in Motricity, a North Carolina–based provider of mobile content delivery technology.

In September 2007, Icahn increased his stake in BEA Systems to 13.22%, a few months before Oracle Corporation announced its acquisition of BEA Systems, which Icahn supported.

Beginning in 2007, Icahn gradually increased his stake in Biogen.

In April 2007, Icahn sold his casino interests in Nevada, including the Stratosphere Las Vegas, Arizona Charlie&#x27;s Boulder, Arizona Charlie&#x27;s Decatur, and Aquarius Casino Resort which were operated through American Casino &amp; Entertainment Properties, a subsidiary of Icahn Enterprises, for $1.3 billion or $1 billion more than he paid for the properties, to a unit of Goldman Sachs.

In March 2008, Icahn sued Motorola as part of his effort to gain four seats on Motorola&#x27;s board and force a sale of its mobile business.

In May 2008, Icahn purchased a large block of shares in Yahoo!, and shortly thereafter threatened to start a proxy fight to remove Yahoo&#x27;s board of directors in response to their rejection of a takeover bid by Microsoft. Instead, he forced an agreement to expand Yahoo&#x27;s board to eleven members, including Icahn and two others of his choice.

In June 2008, Icahn launched a blog, &quot;The Icahn Report&quot;.

In September/October 2008 Icahn was involved in the rejected attempted purchase of Imclone by Bristol-Myers Squibb and in the eventual sale of Imclone to Eli Lilly and Company for $6.5 billion in cash.

In December 2008, he filed suit against Realogy over a proposed debt swap.

In April 2009, Icahn engaged in a proxy battle for Amylin.

In September 2009, he offered to buy the shares of XO he did not already own for $0.55 each. He later raised his offer to $0.80, which ultimately expired.

In October, he resigned from the board of directors at Yahoo!, and by the following February had reduced his equity stake from a one-time high of 75 million shares to 12 million shares.

In February 2010, Icahn, through a subsidiary of his Icahn Enterprises LP, acquired the Fontainebleau Las Vegas for about $150 million. In March he was one of a group of lenders who purchased Tropicana Casino &amp; Resort Atlantic City, bringing the company out of bankruptcy for $200 million.

In March 2011, he conducted a failed takeover bid for Lionsgate Films.

In May 2010, he announced the purchase of an 8.54% stake in Lawson Software.

===2010–2015===
In May 2010, Icahn held a 6.9% stake in Mentor Graphics, increasing to 14% in July. Mentor&#x27;s retaliation with a shareholder rights plan failed to deter Icahn who, in February 2011, made an unsuccessful offer to buy the company for about $1.86 billion in cash.

In January 2011, Icahn offered to buy Clorox for $10.2 billion. By February he had accumulated a 9.08% stake in the company.

In October 2012, Icahn reported a 10% stake in Netflix.

In November 2012, he tried to gain control of the board of directors of Oshkosh Corporation.

In February 2013, Forbes listed Icahn as one of the 40 highest-earning hedge fund managers.

By April 2013, Icahn accumulated a 9.2% stake in Nuance Communications. On August 2, 2013, Icahn sued computer giant Dell and its board in an attempt to derail a $24.4 billion buyout bid by the CEO, Michael Dell, in favor of his own rumored forthcoming bid. In October 2013, Icahn held 4.7 million shares of Apple Inc. The same month, Icahn acquired around 61 million shares in Talisman Energy, leading to a surge in the share price. Also that month, he sold about 50% of his shares in Netflix for a profit in excess of $800 million in less than one year.

In November 2013, he acquired a 12.5% interest in Hologic, a medical device and diagnostics manufacturer.

In January 2014, Icahn invested another half billion dollars in Apple Inc.

Also in January 2014, Icahn pushed eBay to complete the corporate spin-off of PayPal. This started a proxy fight which was settled by April.

In October 2014, Icahn invested in Talisman Energy. The company&#x27;s stock price went down by 71% and he sold his shares two months later.

===Since 2015===
On May 15, 2015, Icahn made a $100 million investment in Lyft.

In November 2015, Icahn hired CBRE Group to market the unfinished Fontainebleau Las Vegas to potential buyers. Also in November 2015, he swapped his stake in eBay for shares in PayPal. Also in November 2015, Icahn disclosed a 7.13% stake in Xerox.

In December 2015, Icahn offered to acquire Pep Boys. He also raised his stake in Cheniere Energy to 13.8%, making him its largest shareholder.

In August 2017, Icahn sold the unfinished Fontainebleau Resort Las Vegas for $600 million, more than four times what he paid.

In January 2016, Icahn disclosed a 4.66% stake in Gannett Company and also held shares in Cheniere Energy and Freeport-McMoRan, both of which declined in value. Icahn sold his Apple shares in April 2016, citing concerns about Apple&#x27;s relationship with China.

In August 2016, Icahn increased his stake in Herbalife Nutrition to 21%.

Also in October 2016, Icahn closed the Trump Taj Mahal Casino in Atlantic City, citing a $350 million loss over several years as well as failure to reach a deal with striking union workers. Nearly 3,000 workers lost their jobs.

In November 2016, he increased his holdings in the car rental company The Hertz Corporation, after the company&#x27;s stock price had declined significantly.

In 2017, Icahn acquired a 9.7% stake in Conduent, sold out of Allergan and Nuance Communications, and increased his stakes in Navistar International and Herbalife Nutrition.

In May 2020, Icahn sold his entire 39% stake, or 55.3 million shares, of Hertz Global for 72 cents a share. He lost almost $2 billion on the investment.

In February 2022 Icahn, who held 200 shares of the company, nominated two people for election to McDonald&#x27;s board of directors in what may be the first step toward a proxy fight. Icahn aims to pressure McDonald&#x27;s to improve conditions of pigs raised by its suppliers.

However, in May 2022, only 1% of McDonald&#x27;s&#x27; shareholders voted in favor of nominees put forward by Icahn, scoring a victory against his demands for the improvement of conditions in which pigs are raised. In its statement, McDonald&#x27;s claimed it is already moving towards a more humane approach to the issue since its pledge in 2012, adding that Icahn&#x27;s demands were unreasonable.

In May 2023, short seller Hindenburg Research released an analysis of Icahn&#x27;s public company Icahn Enterprises that claims the company is over-valued due to paying large dividends using investments from new investors. In addition, the analysis claims that Icahn took out loans against a majority of his holdings and that these have the potential to be called should the stock price move downward. On the day of the release of this analysis, the share price of Icahn Enterprises dropped by 20%.

==Public policy and economic views==
Icahn endorsed Donald Trump in the 2016 United States presidential election. He also announced the formation of a super PAC pledging $150 million to push for corporate tax reform, in particular of tax inversions, which occur when corporations move their headquarters from the U.S. to take advantage of lower tax rates elsewhere.

Upon becoming the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, Trump announced that he would nominate Icahn for United States Secretary of the Treasury. However, he instead nominated Steven Mnuchin.

On December 21, 2016, it was announced that Icahn would serve as special advisor to the president on regulatory reform under President Donald Trump and that Icahn would aid Trump in an &quot;individual capacity&quot; rather than as a federal employee, and that he would not have &quot;specific duties&quot; and therefore would not have to relinquish his business interests while serving as an advisor to Trump. Icahn stepped down from this role on August 18, 2017, citing a desire not to interfere with the work of Neomi Rao as administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs.

In February 2018, Icahn avoided a $6 million loss by selling some of his holdings in a steel-price sensitive stock just days before the Trump administration announced a 25% tariff on steel imports.

When the President had Icahn interview Scott Pruitt during consideration of his nomination as Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, Icahn specifically asked Pruitt about his position on the EPA&#x27;s Renewable Fuel Standard. Icahn spoke directly to President Trump and to Gary Cohn about his proposed changes to the ethanol rule. CVR Energy, in which Icahn has 82% ownership, would save $205.9 million a year if Icahn&#x27;s proposal was adopted. The Sugar Land, Texas oil refinery benefited when President Trump made an exception to his regulation freeze to expand the tax advantage of master limited partnerships. CVR Energy&#x27;s stock doubled after President Trump&#x27;s election, increasing $455 million in value.

==Personal life==
In the summer of 1978, Icahn, then 41 years old, met Liba Trejbal, a 28-year-old ballerina from the former Czechoslovakia. She became pregnant 8 months later and Icahn offered to marry her if she signed a prenuptial agreement. They were married in March 1979. In October 1993, Liba filed for divorce and sued to invalidate the prenuptial agreement, claiming she signed it under duress due to the pregnancy. The divorce was settled in July 1999. They have two children, Brett Icahn and Michelle Celia Icahn Nevin. His nephew is Rick Schnall.

In 1999, Icahn married his longtime assistant and former broker, Gail Golden. She has two children from a previous marriage.

==Philanthropy==
Icahn Stadium on Randall&#x27;s Island in New York City is named after him, as is the Carl C. Icahn Center for Science and Icahn Scholar Program at Choate Rosemary Hall, a prep school in Connecticut. This organization pays for tuition, room and board, books, and supplies for 10 students every year for four years (freshman–senior), an endowment valued at about $400,000 per annum.

Icahn made a substantial contribution to his alma mater, Princeton University, to fund a genomics laboratory which bears his name, the Carl C. Icahn Laboratory at the university&#x27;s Institute for Integrated Genomics. He also made large contributions to Mount Sinai Hospital, New York, of which he is a trustee, which in return named a building the Icahn Medical Institute designed by Davis Brody Bond, and also, in 2013, renamed the Mount Sinai School of Medicine as the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. The genomics institute led by Brian Brown, PhD, was renamed the Icahn Genomics Institute.

His foundation, the Children&#x27;s Rescue Fund, built Icahn House in The Bronx, a 65-unit complex for homeless families consisting of single pregnant women and single women with children, and operates Icahn House East and Icahn House West, both of which are homeless shelters in New York City.

In 2010, Icahn joined the Giving Pledge list, pledging to give away more than half his fortune. Icahn is an activist investor, and has worked with the Humane Society of the United States in pushing McDonald&#x27;s to achieve its pledge to end the sourcing of pork produced with gestation crates.

==In the media==
Carl Icahn is featured in the 2022 HBO documentary &quot;&quot; directed by Bruce David Klein and produced by Atlas Media Corp.

==Awards and honors==
Icahn has the following awards:
* Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement in 1984,
* Starlight Foundation – Founders Award &amp; 1990 Man of the Year Award. 
* Guardian Angel 2001 Man of the Year
* In 2004, he was honored by the Center for Educational Innovation Public Education Association for his work with charter schools.
* In 2006, he was honored with the 100 Women in Hedge Funds Effecting Change Award for his outstanding contributions to improving education.

==Thoroughbred horse racing==
In 1985, Icahn established Foxfield Thoroughbreds, a horse breeding operation. At that year&#x27;s Newstead Farm Trust sale run by Fasig-Tipton, he paid $4 million for Larida, a six-year-old mare and a record $7 million for the four-year-old bay mare Miss Oceana who was in foal to champion sire, Northern Dancer.

Icahn&#x27;s Meadow Star won the 1990 Breeders&#x27; Cup Juvenile Fillies and was voted the American Champion Two-Year-Old Filly.

In 1992, Foxfield ended its racing operation and became a commercial breeder, having bred more than 140 graded stakes race horses.

In 2004, Icahn shut down Foxfield, selling all his mares and weanlings without reserve at the Keeneland Sales November breeding stock auction.

<text>Shoeburyness ( ), or simply Shoebury, is a coastal town in the City of Southend-on-Sea, in the ceremonial county of Essex, England; it lies east of the city centre. It was formerly a separate town until it was absorbed into Southend in 1933.

In Saxon times, the area was called &quot;Shoebury&quot;. Sometime between 1086 and the thirteenth century, it was divided into two parishes called North Shoebury and South Shoebury. The two villages remained small rural settlements until the 1850s, when a barracks was established in the parish of South Shoebury, later becoming MoD Shoeburyness. A garrison town, known as Shoeburyness, grew around the barracks, taking its name from the ness on the coast at the southern end of the parish. Shoeburyness railway station opened in 1884, as the eastern terminus of the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway.

The parish of South Shoebury was made an urban district in 1894, which was renamed Shoeburyness in 1895. The urban district of Shoeburyness and parish of North Shoebury were both abolished in 1933, being absorbed into the county borough of Southend-on-Sea. Development during the twentieth century saw the formerly separate settlements of Shoeburyness and North Shoebury absorbed into the built-up area of Southend.

==History==
The first record of occupation in Shoebury has been found from the Mesolithic period, with Neolithic and Bronze Age stone tools and Beaker pottery having also been discovered. An Iron Age settlement has been found, that had ramparts that were believed to be originally 40ft wide and 12ft tall, with evidence of round houses, ditches and Postholes that is now a Scheduled Monument. The Romans built a fortified settlement called Essobira at the Ness, that was attacked by the British in AD50 under Caratacus and later by Boudica&#x27;s rebels. Evidence of Essobira has not been found, however a Roman Kiln was found in 1892, 300 yards from Suttons, a historical house. A further Roman kiln was found in the grounds of the garrison in 1895. 

The Saxons re-established a settlement in the 6th century, which at this point that the name Shoebury, or in Anglo-Saxon Scobrih, or in Danish, Scabivig was first documented. A Camp was built by the Dane Hastein in circa 894, but little remains as the Artillery Barracks were built over part of the site. Shoebury (North and South were recorded as one) was listed in the Domesday Book of 1086, having a population of 33 and sitting within the control of the Rochford Hundred. The land was owned by three different people, Walter; Bishop Odo of Bayeux and the Swein of Essex, son of Robert FitzWimarc.

The parish church of South Shoebury, St. Andrew was originally constructed in the 12th century under the control of Prittlewell Priory, with the West Tower being added in the 15th century and the South porch in the 16th century. The church was restored during the 19th century by renown architect Sir Charles Nicholson. The manor house, known as South Shoebury Hall, is a medieval timber-framed house with an 18th-century brick frontage and other alterations. Other historical properties include Suttons, a Grade II listed manor house that was built in 1681, which is now on the most endangered list of Historic England. South Shoebury has also been called under is parish name of &quot;Shoebury Magna&quot; (in Latin &quot;Magna Shoberi&quot;) or &quot;Greater Shoebury&quot;.

South Shoebury was prone to flooding and Marsh fever, and in 1530 the parish had to sell St Andrew&#x27;s bells to pay for repairs to the sea defences. Shoebury Common first appeared as The Great Marsh on a map in 1687, and in 1899 the land owner, Colonel Burges handed the Common to the Shoeburyness Urban District Council &quot;for the recreation and benefit of the inhabitants of South Shoebury and others&quot;.

By 1851, the population of South Shoebury stood at 151, but just ten years later the census had shown the population had grown to 1,502. The growth in population was caused by the opening of nearby brickfields by the Frapping family, and the construction of the Artillery Barracks that was the start of Shoebury Garrison. Prior to the Garrison&#x27;s arrival the land had been home to several warrens, after the Normans had introduced rabbits to the area. In comparison, North Shoebury&#x27;s population in 1894 was just 184. The village of South Shoebury had been built up around the High Street and Rampart Street, but it was not until the 1920s and 1930s that the town grew, with the area known as Cambridge Town being established. The area was named after a local public house called the Duke of Cambridge. The town was described by the military historian Patrick Barry as
It was home to the last recorded case of indigenous malaria in the British Isles during the 1930s.

The brickfields use to run two narrow railways, that crossed the High Street without a level crossing, to transfer their goods to Thames Barges at East Beach, which took the bricks to London, which up to World War II brought refuse back that was used to power the brick kilns, pumping out nasty fumes. In 1866, the Gas Light &amp; Coke Company built a gas works to supply the Garrison, which a private company was then formed to manage the supply to Shoeburyness, which subsequently was taken over by Shoeburyness Urban District Council. The council was created in 1894, separating the civil and ecclesiastical side of the parish, until it was absorbed into Southend Borough in 1933 which also absorbed the former North Shoebury parish.

In between the two World Wars, Shoeburyness became a popular holiday resort, with a blacksmiths sitting next to the beach until the 1930s being a regular source of entertainment. In 1928, the Southend Recorder reported that tents stretched from the Common to Thorpe Hall Avenue, while in the same year local landmark Uncle Toms Cabin was built on the Common.

At the beginning of the Second World War, the depositing of a magnetic ground mine in the mud at the mouth of the Thames by the Luftwaffe was observed at Shoeburyness. Various sinkings of ships near the English coast in the preceding months were thought by many to be due to U-boat torpedoes, though the Admiralty suspected magnetic mines were being used. The heroic recovery of an intact mine on 23 November 1939, by Lieutenant Commanders Ouvry and Lewis from HMS Vernon made it possible for the Navy to study it and devise countermeasures to neutralise it; among these were the degaussing cables installed in merchant ships in Allied and British fleets, and, of course, wooden minesweepers. East Beach is the site of a defence boom, built in 1944, to prevent enemy shipping and submarines from accessing the River Thames. This replaced an earlier, similar boom built east.

After the war, artillery and other regiments continued to be garrisoned at Shoebury until 1976 when the garrison headquarters closed.

Up and to the early 1980s, the Shoebury&#x27;s were still two distinctive villages, separated by farm land. During the 1970s, a study by Southend Borough Council identified a lack of retail availability in the east of the borough. North Shoebury was identified as the site, with a supermarket of 50,000 square feet planned at its centre. Before any development took place, Essex County Council Archaeology Section of the Planning Department and Southend Museum started the North Shoebury Project in 1980 under the guidance of John Wymer, whose digs 
established that the area had continuous human habitation from the Mesolithic period. The planned store became the ASDA supermarket, which opened in 1981, while one of the former farm barns became the Parsons Barn public house. This was joined by the Bishopsteignton housing development, that was completed between 1981 and 1988. The site was the former farm of listed building, the White House, which had been sold in 1919 to Southend Estates Company. Following the closure of the Old Ranges in 1998 the old garrison land and buildings were sold, and in 2000 redevelopment of the site to housing started. In 2022, a heritage centre was opened on the former garrison after 35 years of campaigning.

==Description==
Shoeburyness sits on the Thames Estuary and is at the far east of the district of Southend-on-Sea, bordered to the west by Thorpe Bay at Maplin Way and to the North by Great Wakering which is part of Rochford District.

The MoD Shoeburyness site at Pig&#x27;s Bay is situated nearby and the facility is run by the company QinetiQ. The Garrison site is now part of a conservation area set up by Southend City Council.

Shoeburyness has two beaches: East Beach and Shoebury Common Beach, both Blue Flag beaches.

East Beach is a sandy/pebbly beach around a quarter of a mile long and is sandwiched between the Pig&#x27;s Bay MoD site and the former Shoeburyness Artillery barracks. Access to the large gravel/grass pay-and-display car park is via Rampart Terrace. The beach is closed when there is live fire at the MOD site.

Shoebury Common Beach is bounded to the east by the land formerly occupied by the Shoeburyness Artillery barracks and by Thorpe Bay to the west. Shoebury Common Beach is the site of many beach huts located on both the promenade and the beach. A Coast Guard watch tower at the eastern end of the beach keeps watch over the sands and mudflats while listening out for distress calls over the radio. A cycle path skirts around the sea-front linking the East Beach to Shoebury Common Beach, and thence into Southend and onto Chalkwell, in Westcliff-on-Sea.

Shoeburyness does not have an actual town centre. There are parades of shops in West Road, Ness Road and The Renown. The town is served by two supermarkets, Asda and Lidl.

Shoeburyness has several industrial estates, with Towerfield Road, Vanguard Way and Campfield Road serving the area.

The town is served by five doctors surgeries and three dentists, with its nearest hospital located at Southend University Hospital.

==Governance==
There is only one tier of local government covering Shoeburyness, being the unitary authority of Southend-on-Sea City Council. Shoeburyness is split into West Shoebury and Shoeburyness wards, which are both represented by three councillors.

Shoebury was listed in the Domesday Book of 1086, having a population of 33 and lying in the Rochford Hundred. Some time after 1086, the separate parishes of North Shoebury and South Shoebury were created. In Wakering Road, north of Constable Way stands a marker where the historical boundary between the two civil parishes existed. When parish and district councils were established in December 1894, the parish of North Shoebury was included within the Rochford Rural District whilst the parish of South Shoebury was made an urban district. One of the first actions of the new urban district council was to request a change in the council&#x27;s name from South Shoebury to Shoeburyness. The change of name took effect in January 1895. The name of the civil parish containing the urban district continued to be called &quot;South Shoebury&quot;. In 1931 the parish had a population of 6720. In 1933 both Shoeburyness Urban District Council (which managed the South Shoebury civil parish) and North Shoebury civil parishes were abolished and absorbed into the County Borough of Southend on Sea, except for a more rural eastern part of the old North Shoebury parish which was transferred to the parish of Great Wakering.

Shoeburyness is part of the Southend East and Rochford constituency, and the current serving Member of Parliament is Bayo Alaba.

==Climate==

Shoeburyness is known to be the driest town in England, with an average precipitation of 527mm/20.8in per annum. For comparison, New York City receives well above twice this amount.

==Transport==

The eastern terminus of the London, Tilbury and Southend line (c2c line) is at Shoeburyness railway station, where services run to London Fenchurch Street in the City of London. Shoeburyness Depot is the easternmost depot on the c2c line. The eastern end of the A13 is at Shoeburyness and is the only A Road in the town. Shoeburyness is served by Arriva and Stephensons of Essex bus companies.

==Education==
Shoeburyness High School is the only secondary school within the town and incorporates a sixth form, while primary education is delivered by St George&#x27;s Catholic Primary School, Friars Primary School, Hinguar Community Primary School, Richmond Avenue Primary and Nursery School and Thorpedene Primary School &amp; Nursery.

==Leisure==
Shoeburyness Leisure Centre in Delaware Road provides a swimming pool, gym and indoor courts. Shoeburyness formerly had an operating cinema, The Palace in Ness Road which opened in 1913 and closed in 1955.

Gunners Park and Shoebury Ranges is a 25-hectare nature reserve managed by the Essex Wildlife Trust (EWT). Other parks include Shoeburyness Park, Friars Park, Bishopsteignton Park, Shoebury Common and St. Mary&#x27;s Nature Reserve. A skate park is located in Anson Chase.

==Conservation==
Shoebury Garrison is one of Southend&#x27;s 14 listed conservation areas, being first designated in 1981 before a further extension in 2004. Historic England have listed a total of 44 properties between Grade II and Grade II*, with both parish churches amongst this list. The majority of the listings are on the former garrison site, including the Cart and Wagon Shed heritage and community centre.

==Pig&#x27;s Bay==

Pig&#x27;s Bay is a coastal area in the east of Shoeburyness. The main entrance to the site is at Blackgate Road, Shoeburyness. This is also the gateway to the island of Foulness, the third largest island off the coast of England.

The bay is the site of MoD Shoeburyness, a military installation established in 1849 and which is still used as a firing range. The Bay is home to Shoeburyness Boom, a World War II and Cold War defensive boom that is a Scheduled Monument.

One of the other uses of the site is the storage and scrapping of old railway vehicles. It has its own private railway network, stretching for around six miles, linked to one of the sidings at Network Rail&#x27;s Shoeburyness c2c electrical multiple unit depot by means of two unmanned level crossings across Shoeburyness High Street and Blackgate Road, respectively. 

The front locomotive of the passenger train involved in the 1997 Southall rail crash – when an InterCity 125 train collided with a freight train, killing seven people – was scrapped here, being cut up by Serco three years after the incident once the inquiry had been completed.

==In popular culture==
The English painter J. M. W. Turner depicted the fishermen of Shoeburyness in his oil painting &quot;Shoeburyness Fishermen Hailing a Whitstable Hoy&quot;. The painting was exhibited in 1809, and was part of a series Turner made of the Thames estuary between 1808 and 1810. The painting has been in the collection of the National Gallery of Canada since 1939.

In the fifth &quot;Temeraire&quot; novel &quot;Victory of Eagles&quot; (2008) by Naomi Novik, Shoeburyness is the setting of a fictitious climactic battle in which Wellesley and Nelson drive Napoleon out of England in early 1808.

Shoeburyness is home to &quot;the commuter&quot;, protagonist in the eponymous song and music video by Ceephax Acid Crew.

Shoeburyness is one of the better-known entrants in Douglas Adams&#x27; and John Lloyd&#x27;s 1990 spoof dictionary &quot;The Deeper Meaning of Liff&quot;. It is defined as &quot;the vague feeling of uncomfortableness caused by sitting on a bus seat still warm from someone else&#x27;s bottom&quot;.

Shoeburyness is referenced in the Billy Bragg song &quot;A13 Trunk Road to the Sea&quot; and in the Ian Dury song &quot;Billericay Dickie&quot;.

Shoeburyness was featured in the Viral Marketing for the Universal Pictures 2022 American science fiction action film sequel &quot;Jurassic World Dominion&quot;, with a number of the featured videos on the DinoTracker website filmed in the area doubling for locations around the world.

<doc id="203269" wikidata="Q312276" url="?curid=203269" title="Randy Rhoads">
<text>Randall William Rhoads (December 6, 1956 – March 19, 1982) was an American guitarist. He was the co-founder and original guitarist of the heavy metal band Quiet Riot, and the guitarist and co-songwriter for Ozzy Osbourne&#x27;s first two solo albums &quot;Blizzard of Ozz&quot; (1980) and &quot;Diary of a Madman&quot; (1981). Rhoads was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2021.

Originally educated in classical guitar, Rhoads combined these early influences with heavy metal, helping form a sub-genre later known as neoclassical metal. With Quiet Riot, he adopted a black-and-white polka-dot theme which became an emblem for the group. He reached his peak as the guitarist for Ozzy Osbourne&#x27;s solo career, performing on tracks including &quot;Crazy Train&quot; and &quot;Mr. Crowley&quot; on the &quot;Blizzard of Ozz&quot; album. &quot;Crazy Train&quot; features one of the most well-known heavy metal guitar riffs.

He died in a plane crash while on tour with Osbourne in Florida in 1982. Despite his short career, Rhoads is regarded as a pivotal figure in metal music, credited with pioneering a fast and technical style of guitar soloing that largely defined the metal scene of the 1980s. He helped popularize various guitar techniques now common in heavy metal music, including two-handed tapping, vibrato bar dive bombs, and intricate scale patterns, drawing comparisons to his contemporary Eddie Van Halen. The Jackson Rhoads guitar was originally commissioned by him. He has been included in several published &quot;Greatest Guitarist&quot; lists, and has been cited by other prominent guitarists as a major influence.

==Early life and education==
Rhoads was born on December 6, 1956, in Santa Monica, California, the youngest of three children. His parents were both music teachers. His brother was also a musician, who performed under the name &quot;Kelle.&quot; In 1958, when Rhoads was 17 months old, his father left the family and remarried. All three children were subsequently raised by their mother, Delores. She had received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in music from UCLA and had played piano professionally. She opened a music school in North Hollywood called Musonia to support the family.

The Rhoads family did not own a stereo, and the children created their own music at home to entertain themselves. Rhoads listened to the Beatles and the Rolling Stones as a child and would imitate their performances with his brother Kelle in the family garage. Rhoads began folk and classical guitar lessons at approximately age seven at his mother&#x27;s music school. He became interested in rock guitar and began lessons at Musonia from Scott Shelly. Shelly soon approached Rhoads&#x27; mother to inform her that he could no longer teach her son, as Rhoads&#x27; knowledge of the electric guitar had exceeded his own. Rhoads also received piano lessons from his mother to help build his understanding of music theory.

Rhoads met future bandmate Kelly Garni while attending John Muir Middle School in Burbank, California, and the two became best friends. According to Garni, the pair were unpopular due to &quot;the way we looked. Every time we showed up for school it was usually problematic, so we pretty much avoided it. We weren&#x27;t nerds, we weren&#x27;t jocks, we weren&#x27;t dopers, we were just on our own.&quot; Rhoads&#x27; sister Kathy recalled, &quot;People really gave him a hard time. They used to want to beat him up.&quot; Rhoads taught Garni how to play bass guitar, and together they formed a band called The Whore, rehearsing during the day at Rodney Bingenheimer&#x27;s English Disco, a 1970s Hollywood nightspot. It was during this period that Rhoads learned to play lead guitar. &quot;When I met him he didn&#x27;t know how to play lead guitar yet at all. He was just starting to take lessons for it and really just riffing around,&quot; said Garni. Rhoads spent several months playing at backyard parties around the Los Angeles area in the mid-1970s. 

The pair performed for a short time in a backing band for a vocalist remembered only as Smokey before forming a cover band, Violet Fox, with Rhoads&#x27; older brother Kelle on drums. Violet Fox, which was together for approximately five months, staged several performances in the Grand Salon at Musonia. Among their setlist was &quot;Mississippi Queen&quot; by Mountain and songs from the Rolling Stones, Alice Cooper and David Bowie. After Violet Fox dissolved, Rhoads formed various other short-lived bands such as The Katzenjammer Kids and Mildred Pierce. The Katzenjammer Kids&#x27; lead vocalist would often wear dresses on stage, which sometimes led to violent reactions from the audience.

According to Garni, he and Rhoads frequently listened to Long Beach, California radio station KNAC because it was &quot;the only radio station that would play anything of interest to us,&quot; and it was through KNAC that Rhoads discovered much of the music that influenced his playing. The home of a neighborhood friend with a high-quality stereo and large record collection became a regular hangout for the pair, and there they smoked pot and listened to more obscure hard rock music such as early Scorpions records.

Live bootleg recordings were very popular at that time, and Rhoads began to take note of the differences between studio recordings and the live versions, particularly the different licks guitarists incorporated when playing live. He began to memorize these licks and taught himself to play them. Rhoads&#x27; brother states that a July 11, 1971, Alice Cooper concert at the Long Beach Auditorium that the pair attended was a defining point in the guitarist&#x27;s life. After the concert was over he noted: 
Garni concurs, calling Rhoads&#x27; discovery of Alice Cooper &quot;a game changer.&quot; Guitarists Glen Buxton, Mick Ronson, and Leslie West were early influences on his playing.

==Quiet Riot==
At age 16, Rhoads and Kelly Garni formed the band Little Women. At approximately the same time, Rhoads began teaching guitar in his mother&#x27;s school during the day and playing live gigs at night. He graduated from Burbank High School, participating in a special program that allowed him to condense his studies and graduate early so he could teach guitar and pursue music full-time. Recruiting lead vocalist Kevin DuBrow and drummer Drew Forsyth, the band soon changed its name to Quiet Riot.

Forsyth had periodically played with Rhoads and Garni in the past, most notably in Mildred Pierce. DuBrow was an L.A. photographer who was not at all what Rhoads had in mind for his new band, and he was not well liked by his Quiet Riot bandmates, a situation that caused a great deal of tension within the band. Rhoads had envisioned a frontman in the vein of Alice Cooper or David Bowie, but DuBrow was persistent and would not take no for an answer. In the end, Rhoads and Garni decided that if nothing else, DuBrow shared their enthusiasm and he was hired.

Quiet Riot quickly became one of the most popular acts on the Los Angeles club circuit, and by late 1976 had secured a record deal with CBS/Sony Records. Fans began showing up at Quiet Riot shows wearing polka-dots, emulating the polka-dot vests and bow-ties that Rhoads wore onstage. He also had a polka-dot Flying V-style guitar custom made by a local luthier.

While the band had a strong following in Los Angeles, &quot;Quiet Riot&quot; and &quot;Quiet Riot II&quot; were released only in Japan. The relationship between DuBrow and Garni had also deteriorated completely during the recording of the band&#x27;s second album, with potentially catastrophic results. After drunkenly firing a handgun through the ceiling and engaging in a fistfight with Rhoads, Garni hatched a plan to shoot and kill DuBrow at The Record Plant studio while recording the album. Rhoads was left with no choice but to fire his longtime friend and band co-founder.

==Ozzy Osbourne==
In 1979, former Black Sabbath vocalist Ozzy Osbourne was in Los Angeles, attempting to form a new band. An acquaintance of Rhoads&#x27; from the LA club circuit, future Slaughter bassist Dana Strum, phoned Rhoads relentlessly to coax him into auditioning. Rhoads initially told Quiet Riot bandmate Rudy Sarzo that he was not really interested in auditioning, but finally agreed to go simply to get Strum off his back. Rhoads got the call for the audition just before his final show with Quiet Riot in September 1979. The day before Osbourne was scheduled to return to England, Rhoads agreed to audition for Osbourne at a Los Angeles studio.

=== Audition ===
Rhoads brought his Gibson Les Paul and a practice amp and started warming up. Osbourne, who was very drunk, said of the audition &quot;He played this fucking solo and I&#x27;m like, am I that fucking stoned or am I hallucinating or what the fuck is this?!&quot; Osbourne has maintained that he immediately gave him the job. Rhoads recalled later, &quot;I just turned up and did some riffs, and he said, &#x27;You&#x27;ve got the gig&#x27;; I had the weirdest feeling, because I thought, &#x27;You didn&#x27;t even hear me yet. After the audition, Rhoads returned to Musonia and told Sarzo that he had never actually met Osbourne, who was drunk and remained in the studio&#x27;s control room the entire time. According to Rhoads&#x27; own account, it was Strum who emerged from the control room to inform him that he had the job. Rhoads was, however, scheduled to meet Osbourne the following night in his hotel room. In the years following, Osbourne has maintained that his first encounter with Rhoads and the subsequent audition took place the following day at the hotel, and it seems that, in his inebriated state, he combined the two events in his mind. The fact that Osbourne immediately began rehearsals with another guitarist upon returning to England, and did not mention Rhoads until after that guitarist had been fired, seems to confirm that his account of events is inaccurate.

Over the next couple of days following the audition, Rhoads, Osbourne, Strum, and drummer Frankie Banali jammed together in Los Angeles before Osbourne returned to England. Disillusioned with Quiet Riot&#x27;s inability to land an American recording deal, Rhoads discussed with his mother the possibility of joining an already established band. When she asked him if he would accept &quot;an offer like this one&quot;, he replied, &quot;Of course!&quot;

Upon returning to England, Osbourne was introduced in a pub to former Rainbow bassist Bob Daisley by a Jet Records employee named Arthur Sharpe, and the pair hit it off and decided to work together. Unhappy with the guitarist they were initially working with, Osbourne mentioned to Daisley that he had recently met a talented young guitarist in Los Angeles by the name of Randy Rhoads. The new group&#x27;s management intended to keep the lineup all British and was reluctant to hire an unknown American guitarist, but manager Don Arden eventually relented. Rhoads flew to England only to return home a couple of days later, being turned away by English customs at Heathrow Airport when he didn&#x27;t have the necessary work permit. A representative from Jet Records was dispatched to clear the matter up but he never arrived, and Rhoads spent the night in a holding cell before being handcuffed and put on a plane back to the United States the next day. Osbourne subsequently called him to apologize, and arrangements were made for Rhoads to return to England with the proper paperwork. Rhoads flew to England on November 27, 1979, and met with Osbourne and Daisley at the Jet Records&#x27; offices in London. The trio traveled by train to Osbourne&#x27;s home, Bullrush Cottage, which also housed a rehearsal space. It was here that Rhoads lived with Osbourne, his then-wife Thelma, and their two children, during his first weeks in England. Years later, Osbourne said in his autobiography that he could not understand why a musician as talented as Rhoads would want to get involved with a &quot;bloated alcoholic wreck&quot; like himself.

=== &quot;The Blizzard of Ozz&quot; ===
After a short search, former Uriah Heep drummer Lee Kerslake completed the new band, then known as The Blizzard of Ozz. The group headed into the studio to record their debut album, titled &quot;Blizzard of Ozz&quot;. Rhoads&#x27; guitar playing had changed due to the level of freedom allowed by Osbourne and Daisley. His work with Quiet Riot had been criticized as being &quot;dull&quot; and did not rely on classical scales or arrangements. Propelled by Rhoads&#x27; neo-classical guitar work, &quot;Blizzard of Ozz&quot; proved an instant hit with rock fans, particularly in the US.

They released two singles from the album: &quot;Mr. Crowley&quot; and &quot;Crazy Train&quot;. &quot;Mr. Crowley&quot; is in the key of D-minor and &quot;Crazy Train&quot; in F-sharp minor. Osbourne said years later, &quot;One day Randy came to me and said that most heavy metal songs are written in an A to E chord structure. He said, &#x27;Let&#x27;s try to change that&#x27; ... so we made a rule that almost every number that we recorded on an album was never played in the same key.&quot; AllMusic reviewer Steve Huey described Crazy Train&#x27;s main guitar riff as &quot;a classic, making use of the full minor scale in a way not seen since Ritchie Blackmore&#x27;s heyday with Deep Purple.&quot;

&quot;Crazy Train&quot; and &quot;Mr. Crowley&quot; placed 9th and 28th, respectively, on &quot;Guitar World&quot;″s 100 Greatest Guitar Solos readers poll. &quot;Crazy Train&quot; placed 51 in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s 100 Greatest Guitar Songs of All Time list.

=== &quot;Diary of a Madman&quot; ===
Following a UK tour the band recorded another album, &quot;Diary of a Madman&quot;. In December 1981, Rhoads was voted &quot;Best New Talent&quot; by the readers of &quot;Guitar Player&quot; magazine and voted &quot;Best Heavy Metal Guitarist&quot; by the readers of UK-based &quot;Sounds&quot; magazine. At about this time, Rhoads reunited with Dubrow for a one-off Quiet Riot show at the Whisky a Go Go in West Hollywood during a brief trip home. Rhoads was subsequently warned by manager Sharon Arden not to do such a thing again.

During a break before leaving for their first US tour, both Kerslake and Daisley were suddenly fired by Sharon, the band&#x27;s manager and Osbourne&#x27;s future wife. For the US tour, ex-Black Oak Arkansas drummer Tommy Aldridge and bassist Rudy Sarzo – who had been Rhoads&#x27; bandmate in Quiet Riot – were hired. &quot;Diary of a Madman&quot; was released soon after in October 1981, and since Kerslake and Daisley were already out of the band, Aldridge and Sarzo&#x27;s names and photos appeared on the album sleeve. Disputes over royalties performance and other intellectual property rights became a source of future court battles. Kerslake has maintained that Rhoads almost left Osbourne&#x27;s band in late 1981 due to his displeasure with the firing of Kerslake and Daisley. &quot;He didn&#x27;t want to go [on tour with Osbourne]. We told him we were thrown out. He said he was going to leave the band as he did not want to leave us behind. I told him not to be stupid but thanks for the sentiment&quot;, the drummer later recalled.

Around this time, Rhoads remarked to Osbourne, bandmates Aldridge and Sarzo, and friend Kelly Garni that he was considering leaving rock for a few years to earn a degree in classical guitar at UCLA. In the 1991 documentary film &quot;Don&#x27;t Blame Me&quot;, Osbourne confirmed Rhoads&#x27; desire to earn the degree and stated that had he lived, he did not believe Rhoads would have stayed in his band. Friend and ex-Quiet Riot bassist Garni has speculated in interviews that if Rhoads had continued to play rock, he might have gone the route of more keyboard-driven rock, which had become popular through the 1980s. While on tour with Osbourne, Rhoads would seek out classical guitar tutors for lessons whenever possible.

At the time of his death, Rhoads had already made the decision to part ways with Osbourne once his contractual obligations had been fulfilled. Though he had a good relationship with Osbourne, the vocalist&#x27;s constant drug and alcohol abuse made day-to-day life on tour difficult for the members of his band. As the &quot;Diary of a Madman&quot; US tour progressed, Osbourne would often refuse to perform due to the lingering after-effects of the previous night&#x27;s excesses, and only Sharon could talk him into taking the stage. Many shows were simply canceled, and Rhoads grew tired of the unpredictability.

The final straw came when a plan was announced in February 1982 by Osbourne&#x27;s management and record label to record a live album of Black Sabbath songs at Toronto&#x27;s Maple Leaf Gardens later that year. Rhoads and bandmate Tommy Aldridge felt that they had established themselves as recording artists, and they regarded an album of cover songs to be a step backwards artistically and professionally. Thus, they refused to participate in the planned live recording. Osbourne viewed this decision as a betrayal, and the relationship between him and Rhoads became strained. Already drinking heavily, Osbourne escalated his drinking and began to tear the band apart. At one point he drunkenly fired the entire band, including Rhoads, though he later had no memory of doing so. He began taunting Rhoads with claims that the likes of Frank Zappa and Gary Moore were willing to replace him on the proposed live album. Osbourne&#x27;s behavior soon convinced Rhoads to leave the band. He grudgingly agreed to perform on the live album with the stipulation that he would depart after fulfilling his contractual obligations to Jet Records, which consisted of one more studio album and subsequent tour. The proposed live album was scrapped upon the guitarist&#x27;s sudden death weeks later, though the plan was quickly resurrected with the release of &quot;Speak of the Devil&quot; in November of that year.

==Death==
Rhoads played his last show on Thursday, March 18, 1982, at the Knoxville Civic Coliseum. The next day, the band was traveling by bus to Rock Super Bowl XIV, a festival in Orlando, Florida. Osbourne recalls his final conversation with Rhoads involved the guitarist admonishing him over his heavy drinking. On the bus, Rhoads said to Osbourne: &quot;You&#x27;ll kill yourself, you know, one of these days.&quot;

=== Plane crash ===

After driving much of the night, the bus stopped at Flying Baron Estates in Leesburg, Florida, to fix a malfunctioning air conditioning unit while Osbourne remained asleep. On the property, owned by the Calhoun Brothers tour bus company, there was an airstrip with helicopters and small planes. Without permission, tour bus driver and private pilot Andrew Aycock took a single-engine Beechcraft F35 plane registered to a Mike Partin. On the first flight, Aycock took keyboardist Don Airey and tour manager Jake Duncan with him as passengers. Duncan later revealed that Aycock &quot;buzzed&quot; the bus in an attempt to wake drummer Tommy Aldridge. The group then landed. The second flight had Rhoads and makeup artist Rachel Youngblood aboard. Rhoads had tried unsuccessfully to coax bassist Rudy Sarzo to join him on the flight; Sarzo chose to get some extra sleep instead.

During the second flight, more attempts were made to &quot;buzz&quot; the tour bus. Aycock succeeded in making two close passes, but botched the third attempt. At about 10a.m., after being in the air for approximately five minutes, one of the plane&#x27;s wings clipped the top of the tour bus, breaking the wing into two parts and sending the plane spiraling. The initial impact with the bus caused Rhoads&#x27; and Youngblood&#x27;s heads to crash through the plane&#x27;s windshield. The plane then severed the top of a pine tree and crashed into the garage of a nearby mansion, bursting into flames. Rhoads (25) was killed instantly, as were Aycock (36) and Youngblood (58). All three bodies were burned beyond recognition, and Rhoads was identified by dental records and personal jewelry. According to Sharon Osbourne, who was asleep in the bus and awoken by the crash, &quot;They were all in bits, it was just body parts everywhere.&quot;

Keyboardist Don Airey was the only member of the band to witness the crash, as the rest were still asleep in the bus. In his account, he reported a struggle between Rhoads and Aycock in the cockpit, seconds before the crash: 

As the band members on board the bus tried to figure out what had happened, bassist Sarzo recalls side-stepping broken glass in his bare feet and looking through the gaping hole in the bus to see tour manager Jake Duncan outside, rocking back and forth on the ground screaming &quot;They&#x27;re gone! They&#x27;re gone!&quot; Drummer Tommy Aldridge took a fire extinguisher from the bus and ran towards the crash site in a vain attempt to put out the fire. Tour manager Duncan, who had been on board the first flight, explained that although he had been concerned about the pilot&#x27;s behavior, there was no sense of foreboding:

Rhoads was afraid of flying and Youngblood had a bad heart. Rhoads originally had no intention of getting in the plane. Duncan explained how the guitarist ended up on the doomed flight:

=== Reaction ===
The remaining band and crew members were required to remain in Leesburg for an additional two days, until preliminary investigations were completed. Rhoads&#x27; brother-in-law flew from California to Leesburg to identify the guitarist&#x27;s remains. Ozzy Osbourne&#x27;s official statement to crash investigators was:

Bob Daisley and Lee Kerslake, who had recorded &quot;Blizzard of Ozz&quot; and &quot;Diary of a Madman&quot; with Rhoads and had been recently fired from Osbourne&#x27;s band, were together in Houston, Texas, with Uriah Heep later that day when they got word of the accident. Kerslake recalled the moment he heard the news:

Rhoads&#x27; longtime girlfriend Jodi Raskin was in her car when she recalls hearing a block of songs from &quot;Blizzard of Ozz&quot; on the radio before the DJ announced the accident and the news that Rhoads had been killed. She was too distraught to continue driving. When close friend and future Quiet Riot drummer Frankie Banali heard the news, he quickly got in touch with Rudy Sarzo to make sure he was all right. He reported sensing that Sarzo was having a hard time continuing without Rhoads.

Black Sabbath was also touring the US at the time and heard the news on the radio. According to bassist Geezer Butler, they panicked, as they didn&#x27;t know if Osbourne had been one of the casualties or not. They quickly contacted Osbourne&#x27;s management to find out what had happened.

In the hours following the crash, band members and crew called loved ones to assure them that they were safe, as news reports hadn&#x27;t yet named the victims. Sarzo found a church near the hotel they had been taken to and went inside to pray. The church was empty aside from one man at the front, crying uncontrollably near the altar. Sarzo was moved by the display of overwhelming grief. Eventually the man cried out &quot;Why? Why?&quot; and Sarzo realized it was Osbourne.

When fellow guitarist Eddie Van Halen learned about the crash he sensed immediately that the pilot &quot;had to have been fucked up when it happened,&quot; saying in an early 1982 radio interview, &quot;You don&#x27;t fly that low and smash into a crew bus and then hit the house. (The pilot) was jerking off. That&#x27;s just plain stupidity. I feel so sorry for (Rhoads).&quot;
Aycock&#x27;s estranged wife Wanda had spent that last night on the bus. Band members reported that Aycock was attempting to reconcile with her. According to witnesses, Wanda emerged from inside the bus shortly after the second flight took off and was standing in the doorway watching the plane as Aycock made his final approach. Don Airey and Sarzo both surmise that Aycock, having suddenly seen his estranged ex-wife appear, may have intentionally made the impulsive decision to kill her by crashing the plane into the bus. Sarzo also mentions Aycock&#x27;s troubled emotional state that day, worsened by the effects of the cocaine and sleep deprivation. Given the struggle in the cockpit, Sarzo theorized that Rhoads&#x27; actions in the last seconds of his life prevented a direct hit with the bus, which potentially could have killed the pilot&#x27;s ex-wife and everyone else on board.

Ozzy Osbourne later admitted that Aycock had been seen doing cocaine all night prior to the crash. It was confirmed after autopsy that Aycock had tested positive for cocaine; Rhoads&#x27; toxicology test revealed only nicotine. The NTSB investigation determined that Aycock&#x27;s aviation medical certificate had expired and it was reported that Aycock had been the pilot in another fatal crash in the United Arab Emirates six years earlier. Sharon had been aware of the prior crash, but hadn&#x27;t informed anyone else on the tour. In the moments after the crash, she reportedly admonished tour manager Duncan for allowing their people into a plane with a pilot who had been using drugs all night, telling him &quot;Don&#x27;t you know that man had already killed one of the Calhoun&#x27;s kids in a helicopter crash?&quot;

Rhoads&#x27; funeral was held at the First Lutheran Church in Burbank, California. Serving as pallbearers at the funeral were Osbourne, Aldridge, Sarzo, and Rhoads&#x27; former Quiet Riot bandmate Kevin DuBrow. On his coffin were flowers and two photos of the guitarist, one showing Rhoads and Osbourne on stage in San Francisco. Rhoads was buried at Mountain View Cemetery in San Bernardino, California. On his tomb is the inscription &quot;An inspiration for all young people.&quot;

==Personal life==
Rhoads stood tall and weighed . He was an avid collector of toy trains, and he traveled around England in search of them when he first arrived from the United States to record &quot;Blizzard of Ozz&quot; in 1980. He told Osbourne bandmate and close friend Rudy Sarzo that he and Sharon Arden were having a few celebratory drinks together in a hotel one night and ended up sleeping together. At the time, Ozzy Osbourne was trying to save his marriage to first wife Thelma, and Sharon was just his manager.

Osbourne has said that Rhoads did not use drugs and drank very little, preferring Anisette when he did drink. Osbourne says that while Rhoads did not like to party, he made up for it by smoking cigarettes heavily, saying &quot;He could have won a gold medal in the Lung Cancer Olympics, could Randy Rhoads.&quot; Kelly Garni said that in the early days of Quiet Riot he and Rhoads experimented with marijuana and cocaine but &quot;it really wasn&#x27;t for us&quot;. He said Rhoads viewed cocaine as harmless at that time, and used cocaine only occasionally as a means of staying up all night and having fun, but developed a much more negative view of the drug after teaming up with Osbourne. Garni said that Osbourne&#x27;s all-night drug binges taught the guitarist to avoid drugs and substance abuse, and he would typically go off alone to practice guitar or write letters home to his mother and girlfriend while Osbourne was getting high. 

According to his brother Kelle, Rhoads was a &quot;fairly devout&quot; Lutheran.

==Equipment==
===Guitars===

Shortly before leaving Quiet Riot in 1979, Rhoads presented hand-drawn pictures of a polka-dot Flying V-style guitar to Karl Sandoval, a California luthier. The guitar Sandoval built for Rhoads became one of the guitarist&#x27;s trademark instruments. Rhoads&#x27;s guitars included:
*1974 Gibson Les Paul Custom Alpine White
*1957 Gibson Les Paul Black Beauty (used for photographs only)
*Karl Sandoval &quot;Polka Dot&quot; V
*Jackson Rhoads White &quot;Prototype&quot; Concorde
*Jackson Rhoads Black with fixed bridge
*Fender Stratocaster

===2019 Equipment theft===
In December 2019, Ozzy Osbourne offered a $25,000 reward for information leading to the recovery of several pieces of equipment, most of it once belonging to Rhoads, stolen from the premises of Musonia music school on the night of November 28, 2019.

Among the items stolen were a 1963 Harmony Rocket (Rhoads&#x27; first electric guitar), a Peavey Amp Head which was part of Quiet Riot&#x27;s original stage gear, a very rare &quot;Randy Rhoads Series&quot; Marshall Head (Prototype No. 1 or 2 donated to the Rhoads family by the Marshall Company), and a Great Depression-era Silver French Besson trumpet originally owned by his mother, as well as numerous gifts from fans, memorabilia, all photos of Rhoads, and other &quot;miscellaneous instruments&quot;. The items were recovered just a few days later from a dumpster.

== Legacy and influence ==

Rhoads placed 36th on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; Magazine&#x27;s 100 Greatest Guitarists.
He placed fourth on &quot;Guitar World&quot; Magazine&#x27;s 100 Greatest Heavy Metal Guitarists, and 26th in &quot;Guitar World&quot;″s 50 Fastest Guitarists list.

Rhoads&#x27;s biggest influences as a guitarist were Leslie West, Ritchie Blackmore, Michael Schenker, Gary Moore, Charlie Christian, and John Williams.

In the years since his death Rhoads&#x27; work has been very influential within genres such as neoclassical metal, highly regarded by such players as Dimebag Darrell of Pantera, John Petrucci of Dream Theater, Zakk Wylde, Michael Romeo, Alexi Laiho, Mick Thomson of Slipknot, Paul Gilbert of Mr. Big, Buckethead, Michael Angelo Batio, Tom Morello of Rage Against the Machine, Mike McCready of Pearl Jam and Ray Toro of My Chemical Romance.

Aldridge, who Rhoads had regarded as his favorite drummer since seeing him perform on television with Black Oak Arkansas in the 1970s, has said that working with a musician as talented as Rhoads &quot;was inspirational. It was life-changing&quot;. From a musical standpoint, he has said that playing with Rhoads was the high point of his career, stating &quot;It was very exciting. From a musical perspective, it was probably the high-water mark of my career. Working with people like Randy Rhoads, guys like that, they kind of grab you by the scruff of your neck and lift you up to their level.&quot;

Rhoads&#x27; talent was not always met with such praise during his lifetime. Fellow guitarist Eddie Van Halen was somewhat dismissive of Rhoads&#x27; playing, saying in 1982 &quot;Everything he did he learned from me&quot; and &quot;I don&#x27;t really think he did anything that I haven&#x27;t done&quot;, but said that &quot;He was good&quot;. J. D. Considine of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; Magazine was critical of his playing, referring to Rhoads in his review of &quot;Diary Of A Madman&quot; as &quot;a junior-league Eddie Van Halen – bustling with chops but somewhat short on imagination&quot;. Years later, however, the magazine listed Rhoads as one of the greatest guitarists of all time.

=== Posthumous recognition ===
Just before his death Jackson Guitars created a signature model, the Jackson Randy Rhoads (though Rhoads had originally called his white pinstriped V &quot;the Concorde&quot;). Rhoads received one prototype – a black offset V hardtail that is the basis of today&#x27;s RR line of Jackson guitars – but died before the guitar went into production.

Jackson Guitars released an exact replica of Rhoads&#x27; original white &quot;shortwing&quot; V. His original guitar was handled, photographed, and measured extensively by Jackson&#x27;s luthiers to produce the most precise replica possible. The guitar comes with black gaffer&#x27;s tape covering the top wing and the back of the guitar, just like Rhoads&#x27;. Only 60 of the guitars were manufactured, each with the symbolic price tag of $12,619.56, which is Rhoads&#x27; birthday. In 2010, Gibson Guitars announced a new custom shop signature guitar modeled after Rhoads&#x27; 1974 Les Paul Custom.

As a tribute to Rhoads, Marshall Amplification released the 1959RR at the NAMM Show in 2008. The amp is a limited-edition all-white Marshall Super Lead 100-watt head modeled after Rhoads&#x27; own Super Lead amp. Marshall engineers looked extensively at Rhoads&#x27; actual amplifier and made the 1959RR to those exact specifications, down to the special high-gain modification Rhoads requested when he visited the Marshall factory in 1980.

In April 2011, author Joel McIver announced the publication of the first fully comprehensive Rhoads biography, &quot;Crazy Train: The High Life and Tragic Death of Randy Rhoads&quot;, with a foreword written by Zakk Wylde and an afterword by Yngwie Malmsteen. In June 2012, Velocity Publishing Group announced a comprehensive Rhoads biography, written by Steven Rosen and Andrew Klein, and containing over 400 pages of material.

May 31, 2011, marked the 30th anniversary and remaster-release of &quot;Blizzard of Ozz&quot; and &quot;Diary of a Madman&quot;. Both albums were remastered and restored to their original state with Bob Daisley&#x27;s bass and Lee Kerslake&#x27;s drums intact. &quot;Blizzard&quot; has three bonus tracks: &quot;You, Looking at Me, Looking at You&quot;, &quot;Goodbye to Romance&quot; (2010 Vocal &amp; Guitar Mix), and &quot;RR&quot; (Randy Rhoads in-studio guitar solo). Originally, &quot;Diary&quot; was to include long fade-out versions of &quot;You Can&#x27;t Kill Rock and Roll&quot;, &quot;Tonight&quot;, and &quot;Diary of a Madman&quot; (2010 Re-mix version), but they were not included in the re-issue. The Legacy version of &quot;Diary of a Madman&quot; includes a second CD called &quot;Ozzy Live&quot;, a live album pulled together from multiple performances on the 1981 Blizzard of Ozz tour. This performance features the same line-up as the &quot;Tribute&quot; album. Also included exclusively in the special box set are the 180-gram vinyl versions of the original albums, a 100-page coffee table book and the DVD &quot;Thirty Years After the Blizzard&quot;, that includes unreleased Rhoads video footage.

Producer Kevin Churko, who mixed the 2010 &quot;Ozzy Live&quot; CD, has stated that Epic Records has &quot;a lot more in the vault&quot; for future releases of Rhoads&#x27; material with Osbourne, as many of the band&#x27;s live performances from that era were recorded.

Rhoads&#x27; mother, Delores Rhoads, created the Randy Rhoads Scholarship Endowment at California State University, Northridge that gives annual scholarships to guitar students in memory of her son.

On January 18, 2017, Rhoads was inducted into the Hall of Heavy Metal History for defining heavy metal lead guitar.

Rhoads was formally inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on October 30, 2021, as a recipient of the Musical Excellence Award. Speaking (via video message) at the induction were Ozzy Osbourne, and guitarists Tom Morello of Rage Against the Machine, Zakk Wylde (formerly of Osbourne&#x27;s band, and greatly influenced by Rhoads in his youth) and Kirk Hammett of Metallica.

Rhoads was named the 21st greatest guitarist of all time by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in 2023.

<text>Talkartoons is a series of 42 animated cartoons produced by Fleischer Studios and distributed by Paramount Pictures from 1929 to 1932.

==History==
For the Fleischer brothers, the transition to sound was relatively easy. With the new contract with Paramount Pictures, and without the burden of Red Seal Pictures and Alfred Weiss, Max Fleischer was free to experiment with new, bold ideas. First he changed the name of the &quot;Ko-Ko Song Cartunes&quot; series to &quot;Screen Songs&quot;. Although the &quot;Screen Songs&quot; were successful, Fleischer felt that it wasn&#x27;t enough; Walt Disney seemed to gain a great amount of fame through his sound cartoons as well. He decided to work with his brother, Dave on a new series of cartoons where the characters did more than just simply dance to the music of the &quot;bouncing ball&quot;. The name for the new series was to be &quot;Talkartoons&quot;. When the idea was pitched to Paramount, they leaped at the opportunity.

The &quot;Talkartoons&quot; started out as one-shot cartoons. The first entry in the series was &quot;Noah&#x27;s Lark&quot;, released on October 26, 1929. Although a Fleischer cartoon, it appeared to be patterned after the &quot;Aesop&#x27;s Film Fables&quot; of Paul Terry. In it, a Farmer Al Falfa-esque Noah allows the animals of his ark to visit Luna Park. When he brings them back into the ship, the weight is so heavy that it sinks. In the end, Noah chases topless mermaids throughout the ocean waters. &quot;Lark&quot; has very few gray tones, due to employing the paper-cutout animation process utilized in the &quot;Screen Songs&quot; produced during the same time and the earlier Fleischer silent works. It also included copyright-free songs, mostly utilized from old 78-rpm&#x27;s.

The series began to take a new direction, however, with the arrival of Max and Dave&#x27;s brother, Lou Fleischer, whose skills in music and mathematics made a great impact at the studio. A dog named Bimbo gradually became the featured character of the series. The first cartoon that featured Bimbo was &quot;Hot Dog&quot; (1930), the first Fleischer cartoon to be animated on cels, and thus to employ a full range of greys. New animators such as Grim Natwick, Shamus Culhane, and Rudy Zamora began entering the Fleischer Studio, with new ideas that pushed the &quot;Talkartoons&quot; into a league of their own. Natwick especially had an off-beat style of animating that helped give the shorts more of a surreal quality. Perhaps his greatest contribution to the &quot;Talkartoons&quot; series and the Fleischer Studio was the creation of Betty Boop with &quot;Dizzy Dishes&quot; in 1930.

By late 1931, Betty Boop dominated the series. Koko the Clown was brought out of retirement from the silent days as a third character to Betty and Bimbo. By 1932, the series was at an inevitable end and instead, Betty Boop would be given her own series, with Bimbo and Koko as secondary characters.

==Filmography==
Dave Fleischer was the credited director on every cartoon produced by Fleischer Studios. Fleischer&#x27;s actual duties were those of a film producer and creative supervisor, with the head animators doing much of the work assigned to animation directors in other studios. The head animator is the first animator listed. Credited animators are therefore listed for each short. Many of the shorts from 1931-32 don&#x27;t have their animator credits listed, as they were cut when the shorts were sold to television and had their titles replaced.

<doc id="203277" wikidata="Q184387" url="?curid=203277" title="Norway national football team">
<text>The Norway national football team (, or informally &quot;Landslaget&quot;) represents Norway in men&#x27;s international football, and is controlled by the Norwegian Football Federation, the governing body for football in Norway. Norway&#x27;s home ground is Ullevaal Stadion in Oslo and their head coach is Ståle Solbakken. Norway has participated three times in the FIFA World Cup (1938, 1994, 1998), and once in the UEFA European Championship (2000).

Norway is one of only four national teams with a winning record against Brazil, and the only team together with Senegal to never have lost against them, with two wins and two draws in three friendly matches (in 1988, 1997 and 2006) and a 1998 World Cup group stage match.

After Euro 2000, the national team have been eliminated in 12 consecutive qualifications to a major international tournament (UEFA Euro and FIFA World Cup) as of December 2024.

==History==

Norway&#x27;s performances in international football have usually been weaker than those of their Scandinavian neighbours Sweden and Denmark, but they did have a golden age in the late 1930s. An Olympic team achieved third place in the 1936 Olympics, after beating the host Germany earlier in the tournament. Norway also qualified for the 1938 FIFA World Cup, where they lost 2–1 after extra time against eventual champions Italy. This was Norway&#x27;s last World Cup appearance in 56 years.

In the post-war years, up to and including the 1980s, Norway was usually considered one of the weaker teams in Europe. They never qualified for a World Cup or European Championship in this period, and usually finished near the bottom of their qualifying groups. Nevertheless, Norway had a reputation for producing the occasional shock result, such as the 3–0 win against Yugoslavia in 1965, the 1–0 away win against France in 1968, and the 2–1 victory against England in 1981 that prompted radio commentator Bjørge Lillelien&#x27;s famous &quot;Your boys took a hell of a beating&quot; rant.

Norway had their most successful period from 1990 to 1998 under the legendary coach Egil &quot;Drillo&quot; Olsen. At its height in the mid-90s the team was ranked No. 2. Olsen started his training career with Norway with a 6–1 home victory against Cameroon on 31 October 1990 and ended it on 27 June 1998 after a 0–1 defeat against Italy in the second stage of the 1998 World Cup.

In qualifying for the 1994 World Cup, Norway topped their group, finishing above both the European Championship winning and three-time World Cup finalists the Netherlands, and also above former World Cup winners England, beating both teams in the process.

In the 1994 World Cup in the United States, Norway was knocked out at the group stage after a win against Mexico, a defeat against Italy and a draw against the Republic of Ireland. Norway failed to qualify for second round qualification on goals scored as all 4 teams in the group finished with 4 points and identical goal difference. In the 1998 World Cup in France, Norway was once again eliminated by Italy in the first round of the knockout stage after finishing second in their group, having drawn against Morocco and Scotland and won 2–1 against Brazil.

Former under-21 coach Nils Johan Semb replaced Olsen after the planned retirement of the latter. Under Semb&#x27;s guidance, Norway qualified for Euro 2000, which remains their last major tournament appearance to date. Semb resigned at the end of an unsuccessful qualifying campaign in 2003 and was replaced by Åge Hareide. Under Hareide, Norway came close to reaching both the 2006 World Cup and Euro 2008, but ultimately fell short on both occasions. Then, in 2008, it all fell apart as Norway failed to win a single game the entire calendar year. Hareide resigned at the end of 2008. His replacement, initially on a temporary basis, was the returning Egil Olsen, who began his second spell in charge with an away win against Germany, and subsequently signed a three-year contract. Olsen resigned in September 2013 after Norway lost at home to Switzerland and had limited chances to qualify for the 2014 World Cup with one game to spare. He was replaced with Per-Mathias Høgmo. Olsen later claimed he was sacked.

===Crest===

Norway used the national flag on a white circle as their badge from the 1920s onwards. In May 2008 the NFF unveiled a new crest, a Viking-style Dragon wrapped around the NFF logo. After massive public pressure the crest was dropped. Between the 1980s and the 1990s, Norway used the NFF logo in the opposite breast of the shirt together with the national flag on a white circle. On 12 December 2014, a new crest was presented. The crest primarily features the national flag, in addition, there are two lions taken from the Coat of arms of Norway on the top. The lions are facing each other while holding a blue miniature of the NFF logo, and between the lions and above the NFF logo, it says &quot;NORGE&quot; (Norway) in blue letters.

===Kit suppliers===
Between 1996 and 2014, Norway&#x27;s kits were supplied by Umbro. They took over from Adidas who supplied Norway&#x27;s kit between 1992 and 1996.

On 10 September 2014, the NFF and Nike announced a new partnership that made the sportswear provider the official Norwegian team kit supplier from 1 January 2015.

<doc id="203279" wikidata="Q852981" url="?curid=203279" title="USS Saratoga (CV-3)">
<text>USS &quot;Saratoga&quot; (CV-3) was a built for the United States Navy during the 1920s. Originally designed as a battlecruiser, she was converted into one of the Navy&#x27;s first aircraft carriers during construction to comply with the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922. The ship entered service in 1928 and was assigned to the Pacific Fleet for her entire career. &quot;Saratoga&quot; and her sister ship, , were used to develop and refine carrier tactics in a series of annual exercises before World War II. On more than one occasion these exercises included successful surprise attacks on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. She was one of three prewar US fleet aircraft carriers, along with and , to serve throughout World War II.

Shortly after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, &quot;Saratoga&quot; was the centerpiece of the unsuccessful American effort to relieve Wake Island and was torpedoed by a Japanese submarine a few weeks later. After lengthy repairs, the ship supported forces participating in the Guadalcanal Campaign and her aircraft sank the light carrier during the Battle of the Eastern Solomons in August 1942. She was again torpedoed the following month and returned to the Solomon Islands area after repairs were completed.

In 1943, &quot;Saratoga&quot; supported Allied forces involved in the New Georgia Campaign and invasion of Bougainville in the northern Solomon Islands and her aircraft twice attacked the Japanese base at Rabaul in November. Early in 1944, her aircraft provided air support during the Gilbert and Marshall Islands Campaign before she was transferred to the Indian Ocean for several months to support the British Eastern Fleet as it attacked targets in Java and Sumatra. After a brief refit in mid-1944, the ship became a training ship for the rest of the year.

In early 1945, &quot;Saratoga&quot; participated in the Battle of Iwo Jima as a dedicated night fighter carrier. Several days into the battle, she was badly damaged by kamikaze hits and was forced to return to the United States for repairs. While under repair, the ship, now increasingly obsolete, was permanently modified as a training carrier with some of her hangar deck converted into classrooms. &quot;Saratoga&quot; remained in this role for the rest of the war and was then used to ferry troops back to the United States after the Japanese surrender in August, as a part of Operation Magic Carpet. In mid-1946, the ship was a target for nuclear weapon tests during Operation Crossroads. She survived the first test with little damage, but was sunk by a second test.

==Design and construction==

&quot;Saratoga&quot; was the fifth US Navy ship named after the 1777 Battle of Saratoga, an important victory during the Revolutionary War. She was originally authorized in 1916 as a , but before she was laid down construction was placed on hold so that higher-priority anti-submarine vessels and merchant ships, needed to ensure the safe passage of men and materiel to Europe during Germany&#x27;s U-boat campaign, could be built. After the war the design was extensively altered to incorporate improved boiler technology, anti-torpedo bulges, and a general increase in armor protection based on British wartime experiences. Given the hull number of CC-3, &quot;Saratoga&quot; was laid down on 25 September 1920 by New York Shipbuilding Corporation of Camden, New Jersey.

In February 1922, before the Washington Naval Conference concluded, the ship&#x27;s construction was suspended when she was 28 percent complete. She was ordered to be converted to an aircraft carrier with the hull number CV-3 on 1 July 1922. Her displacement was reduced by a total of , achieved mainly by the elimination of her main armament of eight 16-inch (406 mm) guns in four twin gun turrets (including their heavy barbettes, armor, and other equipment). The main armor belt was retained, although it was reduced in height to save weight. The hull generally remained unaltered, as did the torpedo protection system, because they had already been built and it would have been too expensive to alter them.

The ship had an overall length of , a beam of , and a draft of at deep load. &quot;Saratoga&quot; had a standard displacement of , and at deep load. At that displacement, she had a metacentric height of .

Christened by Olive Doolittle, wife of Curtis D. Wilbur, Secretary of the Navy, &quot;Saratoga&quot; was launched on 7 April 1925 and commissioned on 16 November 1927, under the command of Captain Harry E. Yarnell. She was nicknamed by her crew &quot;Sister Sara&quot; and, later, &quot;Sara Maru&quot;. In 1942, the ship had a crew of 100 officers and 1,840 enlisted men, and an aviation group totaling 141 officers and 710 enlisted men. By 1945, her crew totaled 3,373, including her aviation group.

===Flight deck arrangements===
The ship&#x27;s flight deck was long and had a maximum width of . Her flight deck was widened forward and extended aft during her refit in mid-1941. When built, her hangar &quot;was the largest single enclosed space afloat on any ship&quot; and had an area of . It was long and no less than wide. Its minimum height was , and it was divided by a single fire curtain just forward of the aft aircraft elevator. Aircraft repair shops, long, were aft of the hangar, and below them was a storage space for disassembled aircraft, long. &quot;Saratoga&quot; was fitted with two hydraulically powered elevators on her centerline. The forward elevator&#x27;s dimensions were and it had a capacity of . The aft elevator had a capacity of only and measured . Avgas was stored in eight compartments of the torpedo protection system, and their capacity has been quoted as either or .
&quot;Saratoga&quot; was initially fitted with electrically operated arresting gear designed by Carl Norden that used longitudinal wires intended to prevent the aircraft from being blown over the side of the ship, and transverse wires to slow the aircraft to a stop. This system was authorized to be replaced by the hydraulically operated Mk 2 system, without longitudinal wires, on 11 August 1931. Four improved Mk 3 units were added in 1934, giving the ship a total of eight arresting wires and four barriers intended to prevent aircraft from crashing into parked aircraft on the ship&#x27;s bow. When the forward flight deck was widened, an additional eight wires were added there to allow aircraft to land over the bow if the landing area at the stern was damaged. The ship was built with a , flywheel-powered, F Mk II aircraft catapult, also designed by Norden, on the starboard side of the bow. This catapult was strong enough to launch a aircraft at a speed of . It was intended to launch seaplanes, but was rarely used; a 1931 report counted only five launches of practice loads since the ship had been commissioned. It was removed some time after 1936.

Relatively few changes were made during the war to &quot;Saratoga&quot;″s aircraft-handling equipment. Her crew removed her forward arresting wires in late 1943, although their hydraulic systems were not removed until her refit in mid-1944. At that time she received two Type H hydraulic catapults mounted in her forward flight deck to handle the heavier aircraft entering service. Before the war, plans were made to replace the aft elevator with a model, but manufacturing delays and operational demands prevented this from ever happening. By mid-1942, the increasing size and weight of naval aircraft exceeded the capacity of the aft elevator and it was locked in place. It was removed in March 1945 to save weight and the opening in the flight deck was plated over. The machinery for the forward elevator was scheduled to be upgraded before the war, but this was not done until mid-1944. A new, 44-by-48-foot lightweight forward elevator as used in the carriers was installed in March 1945.

&quot;Saratoga&quot; was designed to carry 78 aircraft of various types, including 36 bombers, but these numbers increased once the Navy adopted the practice of tying up spare aircraft in the unused spaces at the top of the hangar. In 1936, her air group consisted of 18 Grumman F2F-1 and 18 Boeing F4B-4 fighters, plus an additional nine F2Fs in reserve. Offensive punch was provided by 20 Vought SBU Corsair dive bombers with 10 spare aircraft and 18 Great Lakes BG torpedo bombers with nine spares. Miscellaneous aircraft included two Grumman JF Duck amphibians, plus one in reserve, and three active and one spare Vought O2U Corsair observation aircraft. This amounted to 79 aircraft, plus 30 spares. In early 1945, the ship carried 53 Grumman F6F Hellcat fighters and 17 Grumman TBF Avenger torpedo bombers.

===Propulsion===
The &quot;Lexington&quot;-class carriers used turbo-electric propulsion; each of the four propeller shafts was driven by two electric motors. They were powered by four General Electric turbo generators rated at . Steam for the generators was provided by sixteen Yarrow boilers, each in its own individual compartment. Six electric generators were installed in the upper levels of the two main turbine compartments to provide power to meet the ship&#x27;s hotel load (minimum electrical) requirements.

The ship was designed to reach . She carried a maximum of of fuel oil, but only of that was usable, as the rest had to be retained as ballast in the port fuel tanks to offset the weight of the island and main guns. Designed for a range of at a speed of , the ship demonstrated a range of at a speed of with of oil.

===Armament===
The Navy&#x27;s Bureau of Construction and Repair was not convinced when the class was being designed that aircraft could effectively substitute as armament for a warship, especially at night or in bad weather that would prevent air operations. Thus the carriers&#x27; design included a substantial gun battery of eight 55-caliber Mk 9 eight-inch guns in four twin gun turrets. These turrets were mounted above the flight deck on the starboard side, two before the superstructure, and two behind the funnel, numbered I to IV from bow to stern. In theory the guns could fire to both sides, but it is probable that firing them to port would have damaged the flight deck. They could be depressed to −5° and elevated to +41°.

The ship&#x27;s heavy anti-aircraft (AA) armament consisted of twelve 25-caliber Mk 10 five-inch guns which were mounted on single mounts, three each fitted on sponsons on each side of the bow and stern. No light AA guns were initially mounted on &quot;Saratoga&quot;, but two twin .50-caliber (12.7 mm) machine gun mounts were installed in 1929. They were unsuccessful, but only the mount on the roof of Turret II was replaced by two .50-caliber (12.7 mm) machine guns by 1934. During the ship&#x27;s August 1941 , four 50-caliber Mk 10 three-inch AA guns were installed in the corner platforms. Another three-inch gun was added on the roof of the deckhouse between the funnel and the island. In addition, a number of .50-caliber machine guns were added on platforms mounted on her superstructure. The three-inch guns were just interim weapons until the quadruple 1.1-inch gun mount could be fielded, which occurred during a brief refit at the Bremerton Navy Yard in late November 1941.

While receiving temporary repairs at Pearl Harbor in January 1942 (after being torpedoed on 11 January 1942), &quot;Saratoga&quot;″s eight-inch turrets, barbettes and ammunition hoists were removed; they were replaced by four twin 38-caliber five-inch dual-purpose gun mounts in February at Bremerton. New barbettes were built and the ammunition hoists had to be returned from Pearl Harbor. The eight-inch guns and turrets were reused as coast defense weapons on Oahu. The older 25-caliber five-inch guns were replaced at the same time by eight more dual-purpose guns in single mounts. As the new guns were heavier than the older ones, only two could be added to the corner gun platforms; the space formerly used by the third gun on each platform was used by an additional quadruple 1.1-inch mount. In addition 32 Oerlikon 20 mm cannon were installed, six at the base of the funnel and the others distributed along the sides and rear of the flight deck. When the ship&#x27;s repairs were completed in late May, her armament consisted of 16 five-inch guns, nine quadruple 1.1-inch gun mounts and 32 Oerlikon guns.

After the ship was again torpedoed on 31 August 1942, her 1.1-inch gun mounts were replaced by an equal number of quadruple Bofors 40 mm mounts while she was under repair at Pearl Harbor. Her light anti-aircraft armament was also increased to 52 Oerlikon guns at the same time. In January 1944 a number of her 20 mm guns were replaced by more Bofors guns, many of which were in the positions formerly occupied by the ship&#x27;s boats in the sides of the hull. &quot;Saratoga&quot; mounted 23 quadruple and two twin 40 mm mountings as well as 16 Oerlikon guns when she completed her refit.

===Fire control and electronics===
The two superfiring eight-inch turrets had a Mk 30 rangefinder at the rear of the turret for local control, but the guns were normally controlled by two Mk 18 fire-control directors, one each on the fore and aft spotting tops. A rangefinder was fitted on top of the pilothouse to provide range information for the directors. Each group of three 5-inch guns was controlled by a Mk 19 director, two of which were mounted on each side of the spotting tops. Plans were made before the war to replace the obsolete Mk 19 directors with two heavier Mk 33 directors, one each on the fore and aft five-inch spotting tops, but these plans were cancelled when the dual-purpose guns replaced the main armament in early 1942.

&quot;Saratoga&quot; received an RCA CXAM-1 early warning radar in February 1941 during a refit in Bremerton. The antenna was mounted on the forward lip of the funnel with its control room directly below the aerial, replacing the secondary conning station formerly mounted there. She also received two FC (Mk 3) surface fire-control radars in late 1941, although these were both removed along with her main armament in January 1942. The new dual-purpose guns were controlled by two Mk 37 directors, each mounting an FD (Mk 4) anti-aircraft gunnery radar. When the 1.1-inch guns were replaced by 40 mm guns in 1942, the directors for the smaller guns were replaced by five Mk 51 directors. A small SC-1 early warning radar was mounted on the rear lip of the funnel during 1942. A SG surface-search radar was mounted on the foremast at the same time.

During the ship&#x27;s refit in January 1944, her electronics were modernized. The CXAM was replaced by an SK model and the SC-1 was replaced by an SC-3. The forward SG was supplemented by an additional SG-1 mounted on a short mast at the aft end of the funnel. A lengthier overhaul in mid-1944 provided the opportunity to revise the radar arrangements. The SK radar was moved to the rebuilt foremast and the forward SG radar was replaced by an SG-1 mounted at the top of the foremast. An SM-1 fighter-control radar was mounted in the SK&#x27;s former position and new antennas were added to the FD radars to allow them to determine target height. The SC-3 was replaced by an SC-4 in early 1945.

===Armor===
The waterline belt of the &quot;Lexington&quot;-class ships tapered in thickness from top to bottom and angled 11° outwards at the top. It covered the middle of the ships. Forward, the belt ended in a bulkhead that also tapered from seven to five inches in thickness. Aft, it terminated at a seven-inch bulkhead. This belt had a height of . The third deck over the ships&#x27; machinery and magazine was armored with two layers of special treatment steel (STS) totaling in thickness; the steering gear was protected by two layers of STS that totaled on the flat and on the slope.

The gun turrets were protected only against splinters with of armor. The conning tower was armored with of STS, and it had a communications tube with two-inch sides running from the conning tower down to the lower conning position on the third deck. The torpedo defense system of the &quot;Lexington&quot;-class ships consisted of three to six medium steel protective bulkheads that ranged from in thickness. The spaces between them could be used as fuel tanks or left empty to absorb the detonation of a torpedo&#x27;s warhead.

===Structural changes===
While under repair after being torpedoed on 11 January 1942, &quot;Saratoga&quot; received a bulge on the starboard side of her hull. This was primarily intended to increase the ship&#x27;s buoyancy, improve stability and allow her full fuel capacity to be utilized. The bulge was estimated to increase her metacentric height by and decrease her speed by one-quarter of a knot. It was also used to store additional fuel oil and increased her capacity to a total of . At the same time, her funnel was shortened by and her tripod foremast was replaced by a light pole mast to reduce her topweight.

All of these changes, including the lengthening of the flight deck, increased &quot;Saratoga&quot;″s full-load displacement in 1945 to . Her overall length increased to and her beam, at the waterline, to , too wide to use the Panama Canal.

==Service history==

===Inter-war period===
&quot;Saratoga&quot; was commissioned one month earlier than her sister ship, &quot;Lexington&quot;. As the ship was visually identical to &quot;Lexington&quot;, her funnel was painted with a large black vertical stripe to help pilots recognize her. She began her shakedown cruise on 6 January 1928 and five days later Marc A. Mitscher landed the first aircraft on board. Later that month, the rigid airship was refueled and resupplied when she moored to &quot;Saratoga&quot;″s stern on 27 January. That same day, the ship sailed for the Pacific via the Panama Canal, although she was diverted briefly en route to carry Marines to Corinto, Nicaragua, before joining the Battle Fleet at San Pedro, California, on 21 February. On 15 September, Captain John Halligan, Jr. relieved the newly promoted Rear Admiral Yarnell. Panama Canal pilots had never before handled a ship with such a significant flight deck overhang. &quot;Saratoga&quot; knocked over all the adjacent concrete lamp posts while passing through the Gatun locks.

In January 1929, &quot;Saratoga&quot; participated in her first fleet exercise, Fleet Problem IX, a simulated attack on the Panama Canal. These exercises tested the Navy&#x27;s evolving doctrine and tactics for the use of carriers. The ship was detached from the fleet with only the light cruiser as escort and made a wide sweep to the south to attack the canal, which was defended by the Scouting Fleet and &quot;Lexington&quot;, from an unexpected direction. Although the carrier was spotted by two defending ships before she launched her air strike, her aircraft were deemed to have destroyed the canal locks. &quot;Saratoga&quot; was &quot;sunk&quot; later the same day by an airstrike from &quot;Lexington&quot;. Captain Frederick J. Horne assumed command on 20 April. The following year, &quot;Saratoga&quot; and &quot;Langley&quot; were &quot;disabled&quot; by a surprise attack from &quot;Lexington&quot; in Fleet Problem X in the Caribbean. &quot;Saratoga&quot; returned the favor shortly afterward in Fleet Problem XI, further demonstrating the vulnerability of carriers to aerial attack. Following the exercises, &quot;Saratoga&quot; participated in the Presidential Review at Norfolk, Virginia, in May and then returned to San Pedro. Captain Frank McCrary relieved Horne on 5 September 1930.
&quot;Saratoga&quot; was assigned, together with &quot;Lexington&quot;, to defend the west coast of Panama against a hypothetical invader during Fleet Problem XII in February 1931. While each carrier was able to inflict some damage on the invasion convoys, the enemy forces succeeded in making a landing. All three carriers then transferred to the Caribbean to conduct further maneuvers, including one in which &quot;Saratoga&quot; successfully defended the Caribbean side of the Panama Canal from a staged attack by &quot;Lexington&quot;. Rear Admiral Joseph M. Reeves baited a trap for &quot;Lexington&quot;″s captain, Ernest J. King, with a destroyer and scored a kill on &quot;Lexington&quot; on 22 March while the latter&#x27;s aircraft were still searching for &quot;Saratoga&quot;. The 1932 movie &quot;Hell Divers&quot; was filmed aboard the ship and starred Wallace Beery and a young Clark Gable as a pair of competing aircraft gunners assigned to VF-1B.

During Grand Joint Exercise No. 4, &quot;Saratoga&quot; and &quot;Lexington&quot; were able to launch an airstrike against Pearl Harbor on Sunday, 7 February 1932, without being detected. The two carriers were separated for Fleet Problem XIII which followed shortly afterward. Blue Fleet and &quot;Saratoga&quot; were tasked to attack Hawaii and the West Coast defended by &quot;Lexington&quot; and the Black Fleet. On 15 March, &quot;Lexington&quot; caught &quot;Saratoga&quot; with all of her planes still on deck and was ruled to have knocked out her flight deck and have badly damaged the carrier, which was subsequently judged sunk during a night attack by Black Fleet destroyers. Captain George W. Steele assumed command on 11 July 1932. While en route from San Diego to San Pedro, the ship briefly ran aground off Sunset Beach, California, on 17 August. Captain Rufus F. Zogbaum, Jr. (son of the famous illustrator) relieved Steele, who was ordered to immediately retire, on 1 January 1933.

Before Fleet Problem XIV began the following month, the Army and the Navy conducted a joint exercise simulating a carrier attack on Hawaii. &quot;Lexington&quot; and &quot;Saratoga&quot; successfully attacked Pearl Harbor at dawn on 31 January without being detected. During the actual fleet problem, the ship successfully attacked targets in and around Los Angeles and San Francisco although she was damaged by opposing ships during the latter attack. Scenes from the 1933 Joe E. Brown film comedy, &quot;Son of a Sailor&quot;, were filmed aboard &quot;Saratoga&quot; and featured flight deck musters of the ships&#x27; company. Fleet Problem XV returned to the Gulf of Panama and the Caribbean in April–May 1934; the participating ships of the Pacific Fleet remained in the Caribbean and off the East Coast for more training and maneuvers until they returned to their home bases in November. Captain Kenneth Whiting relieved Zogbaum on 12 June, after the conclusion of the fleet problem.
Captain William F. Halsey assumed command on 6 July 1935 after the conclusion of Fleet Problem XVI. From 27 April to 6 June 1936, she participated in a Fleet Problem in the Panama Canal Zone where she was &quot;sunk&quot; by opposing battlecruisers and later ruled to have been severely damaged by aircraft from . During Fleet Problem XVIII in 1937, &quot;Saratoga&quot;, now under the command of naval aviation pioneer John H. Towers, covered an amphibious assault on Midway Atoll and was badly &quot;damaged&quot; by &quot;Ranger&quot;″s aircraft.

The 1938 Fleet Problem again tested the defenses of Hawaii and, again, aircraft from &quot;Saratoga&quot; and her sister successfully attacked Pearl Harbor at dawn on 29 March. Later in the exercise, the two carriers successfully attacked San Francisco without being spotted by the defending fleet. Captain Albert Cushing Read relieved Towers in July 1938. During Fleet Problem XX in 1939, the carrier remained off the West Coast as part of Task Force (TF) 7 with the battleship and escorts under the command of Rear Admiral Chester Nimitz to maintain a presence in the Pacific. From 2 April to 21 June 1940, she participated in Fleet Problem XXI, and her aircraft, together with those from &quot;Lexington&quot;, &quot;damaged&quot; the carrier in an early phase of the exercise. Shortly before the end of the fleet problem, Captain Archibald Douglas replaced Read as commanding officer.

From 6 January to 15 August 1941, &quot;Saratoga&quot; underwent a long-deferred modernization at the Bremerton Navy Yard that included the widening of her flight deck at her bow and the installation of additional antiaircraft guns and a CXAM-1 radar. The ship began a refit a few days later that lasted until late November, further revising the anti-aircraft armament and adding an FC radar.

===World War II===
When the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, &quot;Saratoga&quot; was entering San Diego Harbor to embark her air group, which had been training ashore while the ship was refitting. This consisted of 11 Grumman F4F-3 Wildcat fighters of VF-3 (under the command of Lieutenant Jimmy Thach), 43 Douglas SBD Dauntless dive bombers of VB-3 and VS-3, and 11 Douglas TBD Devastator torpedo bombers of VT-3. The ship also was under orders to load 14 Marine Corps Brewster F2A-3 Buffalo fighters of VMF-221 for delivery in Oahu. The following morning the ship, now the flagship of Carrier Division One, commanded by Rear Admiral Aubrey Fitch, sailed for Pearl Harbor. &quot;Saratoga&quot; arrived at Pearl on 15 December, refueled, and departed for Wake Island the following day. The ship was assigned to Task Force (TF) 14 under the command of Rear Admiral Frank Jack Fletcher; VF-3 had been reinforced by two additional Wildcats picked up in Hawaii, but one SBD had been forced to ditch on 11 December.

She then rendezvoused with the seaplane tender , carrying reinforcements and supplies, and the slow replenishment oiler . &quot;Saratoga&quot;″s task force was delayed by the necessity to refuel its escorting destroyers on 21 December, before reaching the island. This process was prolonged by heavy weather, although the task force could still reach Wake by 24 December as scheduled. After receiving reports of heavy Japanese carrier airstrikes, and then troop landings, TF 14 was recalled on 23 December, and Wake fell the same day. On the return voyage, &quot;Saratoga&quot; delivered VMF-221 to Midway on 25 December. The ship arrived at Pearl on 29 December and Fletcher was replaced as commander of Task Force 14 by Rear Admiral Herbert F. Leary the following day. Leary made &quot;Saratoga&quot; his flagship and Fitch was transferred to a shore command that same day. The task force put to sea on 31 December and patrolled in the vicinity of Midway.

&quot;Saratoga&quot;, about southwest of Pearl Harbor on 11 January 1942, was heading towards a rendezvous with USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; when she was hit by a torpedo fired by the &quot;I-6&quot;. The explosion flooded three of her boiler rooms, reduced her speed to a maximum of and killed six of her crewmen. The ship&#x27;s list was soon corrected and she reached Pearl Harbor two days later. While undergoing temporary repairs there, her four twin eight-inch gun turrets were removed for installation in shore batteries on Oahu. &quot;Saratoga&quot; then sailed to the Bremerton Navy Yard on 9 February for permanent repairs. She 10 Wildcats of the VF-2 Detachment and all of VS-3 with its Dauntlesses for self-protection on the voyage.

While under repair, the ship was modernized with an anti-torpedo bulge, her anti-aircraft armament was significantly upgraded and more radars were added. Douglas was relieved on 12 April and &quot;Saratoga&quot; was temporarily commanded by her executive officer, Commander Alfred M. Pride, until Captain DeWitt Ramsey assumed command a month later. &quot;Saratoga&quot; departed from Bremerton on 22 May, bound for San Diego. She arrived there on 25 May and began loading aircraft and supplies while waiting for her task force commander, Admiral Fitch, to arrive from the South Pacific. On 30 May Admiral Nimitz, now commander-in-chief of the United States Pacific Fleet, ordered Captain Ramsey to expedite his departure for Pearl Harbor, even if Fitch had not yet arrived. The ship sailed from San Diego on 1 June carrying 14 Wildcats of VF-2 Detachment and 23 Dauntlesses of VS-3; in addition she carried four Wildcats, 43 Dauntlesses and 14 Avengers as cargo. She arrived at Pearl Harbor on 6 June, the final day of the Battle of Midway. After refuelling, &quot;Saratoga&quot; departed the following day with the mission to ferry replacement aircraft to the carriers that survived the battle. The ship carried a total of 47 Wildcats, 45 Dauntlesses, five Devastators and 10 Avengers, including her own air group. Admiral Fletcher (whose flagship &quot;Yorktown&quot; had been sunk during the battle) came aboard on 8 June and made &quot;Saratoga&quot; his flagship. The ship rendezvoused with the other carriers on 11 June and transferred 19 Dauntlesses, the five Devastators and all of the Avengers to them. When the ship reached Pearl on 13 June, Fletcher and his staff disembarked; Admiral Fitch rendezvoused with the ship the next day. He became commander of Task Force 11 on 15 June, when Nimitz reorganized his carriers. From 22 through 29 June, &quot;Saratoga&quot; ferried 18 Marine Dauntlesses of VMSB-231 and 25 Army Air Corps Curtiss P-40 Warhawks to Midway Island to replace the aircraft lost during the battle. Fletcher relieved Fitch as commander of TF 11 the following day.

====Guadalcanal Campaign====

In late June 1942, the Allies decided to seize bases in the southern Solomon Islands with the objective of denying their use by the Japanese to threaten the supply and communication routes between the U.S., Australia, and New Zealand. They also intended to use Guadalcanal and Tulagi as bases to support a campaign to eventually capture or neutralize the major Japanese base at Rabaul on New Britain. Admiral Nimitz committed much of the Pacific Fleet to the task, including three of his four carrier task forces. They fell under the command of the recently appointed Vice Admiral Robert L. Ghormley, commander of the South Pacific Area.

On 7 July, Task Force 11 departed Pearl for the Southwest Pacific; it consisted of &quot;Saratoga&quot;, four heavy cruisers, , , and , and an escort of seven destroyers. Also assigned were three replenishment oilers and four fast transports converted from old four-stack destroyers. The carrier embarked 90 aircraft, comprising 37 Wildcats, 37 Dauntlesses and 16 Avengers. TF 11 and TF 18, centered around the carrier , rendezvoused south of Tongatapu on 24 July and they met the remaining forces, including &quot;Enterprise&quot;″s TF 16, assigned to Operation Watchtower three days later south of the Fiji Islands. The entire force of 82 ships was organized as Task Force 61 and commanded by Fletcher. On 30 July, &quot;Saratoga&quot; and the other carriers provided air cover for amphibious landings on Koro Island and practiced air strikes as part of the rehearsals for the planned invasion of Guadalcanal, Tulagi, and nearby islands.
The Allied force successfully reached the Solomon Islands without being detected by the Japanese because of thick fog and haze. &quot;Saratoga&quot; launched 24 Dauntlesses and a dozen Wildcats early on 7 August to attack targets on Guadalcanal. Her air group commander, Commander Harry D. Felt, coordinated the attack over the island, which also included eight Wildcats from &quot;Enterprise&quot;″s VF-6. The aircraft focused on the nearly complete airfield at Lunga and dispersed the two construction battalions building it. This allowed the 1st Marine Division to capture it (renaming it Henderson Field) without resistance. For the rest of the day, the carriers provided a combat air patrol (CAP) over the transports and themselves while their other aircraft provided air support for the Marines as needed.

The Japanese struck back quickly and launched 27 Mitsubishi G4M (&quot;Betty&quot;) medium bombers, escorted by 17 Mitsubishi A6M Zero (&quot;Zeke&quot;) fighters, against the Allied forces. Among the escorting pilots were several aces such as Junichi Sasai, Toshio Ota, Hiroyoshi Nishizawa, and Saburō Sakai. Failing to spot the carriers, the bombers attacked the transports and their escorts, defended by eight Wildcats from &quot;Saratoga&quot;″s VF-5. The Zeros shot down five Wildcats without losing any of their own, but the Americans shot down at least one G4M and damaged a number of others. The bombers failed to hit any Allied ships. About an hour later, nine Aichi D3A (&quot;Val&quot;) dive bombers attacked the transport groups. Also based in Rabaul, they were on a one-way mission with a minimal payload of two small bombs each because the distance to Guadalcanal exceeded their combat range; the pilots were expected to ditch at Shortland Island on the return leg where a Japanese seaplane tender could pick them up. By the time they arrived, the American CAP had been reinforced to 15 Wildcats from VF-5 and VF-6. Realizing that they had been spotted and that they could not reach the vulnerable transports before they were intercepted by the defending fighters, the Japanese attacked two of the escorting destroyers. They lightly damaged one destroyer with a direct hit, but the Americans shot down five of the attackers without loss to themselves.

The Japanese attacked the transports again the following day, but none of &quot;Saratoga&quot;″s aircraft were involved. Concerned about his declining fuel reserves and worried about air and submarine attacks after losing 20% of his fighters, Fletcher requested permission from Ghormley to withdraw one day early to refuel. This was granted and Fletcher&#x27;s carriers were mostly out of range by the morning of 9 August. This meant that they were out of strike range after a Japanese cruiser force sank four Allied cruisers that night. The transports still lacked air cover, but the only Japanese airstrike of the day specifically targeted the carriers and ignored the transports entirely. Fletcher loitered southeast of the Solomons, waiting for the Japanese carriers that signals intelligence told him were en route to be spotted. He rendezvoused with the aircraft transport on 19 August and covered her approach to Guadalcanal. The ship was carrying Marine aircraft for Henderson Field and successfully flew them off the next day. Fletcher returned to the Solomons on 21 August after escorting &quot;Long Island&quot; to safety and remained in the vicinity for the next several days to provide cover for two transports resupplying the Marines. American aircraft shot down several Japanese reconnaissance aircraft during this time and the Japanese concluded that one or more American carriers were operating southeast of Guadalcanal.

====Battle of the Eastern Solomons====


The presence of American carriers nearby firmed up Japanese plans to land troops on Guadalcanal on 24 August, covered by the fleet carriers and and the light carrier . A force of Japanese troop transports was detected on the morning of 23 August some north of Guadalcanal. Fletcher was not originally inclined to attack them until another force of two transports was spotted at Faisi later that morning. He changed his mind and ordered &quot;Saratoga&quot; to launch her airstrike of 31 Dauntlesses and six Avengers in the early afternoon at very long range. They could not locate the Japanese convoy in poor visibility because it had reversed course shortly after spotting the American reconnaissance aircraft. The aircraft lacked the range to return to their carrier and they were ordered to land at Henderson Field and return the following morning.

The Japanese failed to locate the American carriers during the day and Vice Admiral Chūichi Nagumo, commander of the First Carrier Division, ordered &quot;Ryūjō&quot;, escorted by the heavy cruiser and two destroyers, to attack Henderson Field, as per Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto&#x27;s orders. American aircraft located the &quot;Ryūjō&quot; task force the following morning as it approached within aircraft range of Guadalcanal, as well as other enemy ships, but failed to spot the fleet carriers. Fletcher delayed his attack until further reconnaissance aircraft failed to find the other Japanese carriers and his own aircraft returned from Henderson Field. In the meantime, &quot;Ryūjō&quot; had launched her own airstrike against Henderson Field, although they inflicted little damage while losing seven out of 21 aircraft during the attack.

&quot;Saratoga&quot; launched an airstrike against &quot;Ryūjō&quot;″s task force in the early afternoon that consisted of 31 Dauntlesses and eight Avengers; the long range precluded fighter escort. While those aircraft were en route, a number of reconnaissance aircraft from &quot;Enterprise&quot; spotted and attacked the Japanese formation. They inflicted no damage and the Japanese CAP shot down one Avenger. &quot;Saratoga&quot;″s aircraft sighted the carrier shortly afterward and attacked. They hit &quot;Ryūjō&quot; three times with bombs and one torpedo; the torpedo hit flooded the starboard engine and boiler rooms. No aircraft from either &quot;Ryūjō&quot; or &quot;Saratoga&quot; were shot down in the attack. The carrier capsized about four hours later with the loss of 120 crewmen.

About an hour after &quot;Saratoga&quot; launched her airstrike, the Japanese launched theirs once they located the American carriers. &quot;Shōkaku&quot; contributed 18 D3As and nine Zeros while &quot;Zuikaku&quot; launched nine D3As and six Zeros. Reconnaissance SBDs from &quot;Enterprise&quot; spotted the 1st Carrier Division shortly after the Japanese airstrike had taken off and five of &quot;Shōkaku&quot;″s Zeros stayed behind to deal with the Dauntlesses as they attacked &quot;Shōkaku&quot;. The Dauntlesses survived the attack by the Zeros, but their spot report was garbled and the enemy&#x27;s location could not be understood. This incident prompted Nagumo to launch a follow-on airstrike with 27 D3As and nine Zeros.

The first airstrike attacked the ships of TF 16 which was initially defended by fighters from VF-6. Once radar spotted the incoming Japanese aircraft, both carriers launched all available fighters. &quot;Enterprise&quot; was badly damaged by three bomb hits, but the Japanese lost 19 dive bombers and four Zeros to the defending fighters and anti-aircraft fire. They claimed to have shot down a dozen Wildcats although the Americans lost only five, of which three belonged to VF-5; some of the American losses were reportedly due to friendly anti-aircraft fire. In turn, the American fighters claimed to have shot down 52 Japanese aircraft, 15 more than the Japanese committed to the attack. The second Japanese airstrike failed to locate the American carriers.

Right before the Japanese attack, &quot;Saratoga&quot; launched a small airstrike of two Dauntlesses and five Avengers to clear her flight deck and these planes found and damaged the seaplane tender &quot;Chitose&quot; with near misses that also destroyed three Mitsubishi F1M reconnaissance floatplanes. Two Avengers were forced to make emergency landings, but they shot down one Zero from &quot;Shōkaku&quot;. After recovering their returning aircraft, the two American carriers withdrew, &quot;Enterprise&quot; for repairs and &quot;Saratoga&quot; to refuel the next day. Before the former departed for Tongatapu for temporary repairs, she transferred 17 Wildcats and six Avengers to &quot;Saratoga&quot; as replacements for the latter&#x27;s losses.
Fletcher rendezvoused with TF 18 east of San Cristobal on the evening of 26 August and transferred four Wildcats to &quot;Wasp&quot; the next day to bring the latter&#x27;s fighters up to strength. TF 17, with the carrier , arrived on 29 August. Two days later, a torpedo from struck &quot;Saratoga&quot; on her starboard side, just aft of the island. The torpedo wounded a dozen of her sailors, including Fletcher, it flooded one fire room, giving the ship a 4° list, and it caused multiple electrical short circuits. These damaged &quot;Saratoga&quot;″s turbo-electric propulsion system and left her dead in the water for a time. The heavy cruiser &quot;Minneapolis&quot; took &quot;Saratoga&quot; in tow while she launched her aircraft for Espiritu Santo, retaining 36 fighters aboard. By noon, the list had been corrected and she was able to steam under her own power later that afternoon.

&quot;Saratoga&quot; reached Tongatapu on 6 September and flew off 27 Wildcats for Efate once she arrived. The ship received temporary repairs there and sailed for Pearl on 12 September, escorted by the battleship , &quot;New Orleans&quot; and five destroyers. Task Force 11 reached Pearl on 21 September and &quot;Saratoga&quot; entered drydock the following day for more permanent repairs. Captain Ramsey was promoted on 27 September and replaced by Captain Gerald F. Bogan.

Task Force 11, now commanded by Rear Admiral Ramsey, sailed from Pearl Harbor, bound for Nouméa, New Caledonia, via Viti Levu, Fiji, on 12 November 1942 with &quot;Saratoga&quot; as his flagship. The other ships of the task force consisted of &quot;New Orleans&quot;, the fleet oiler and six destroyers. The carrier had on board the Wildcats of VF-6, Dauntlesses of VB-3 and VS-6, and the Avengers of VT-3. The ships dropped anchor in Fiji on 22 November, except for &quot;New Orleans&quot;, which immediately left for Nouméa, escorted by two destroyers. The cruiser was replaced by the light anti-aircraft cruiser on 29 November and the task force sailed for Nouméa on 1 December. After they arrived on 5 December, one of &quot;Saratoga&quot;″s main turbines required repairs which lasted until 13 December.

====1943====
On 23 January 1943, &quot;Saratoga&quot; launched 18 Wildcats of VF-3, 24 Dauntlesses of VB-3 and VS-3, and 17 Avengers of VT-3 for Henderson Field, retaining 16 Wildcats and 15 Dauntlesses for self-defense. The next day they attacked the Japanese airfield at Vila, Solomon Islands after it had been bombarded by four Allied light cruisers. The aircraft returned to the carrier without loss later that afternoon. Captain Bogan slipped and badly injured himself on 29 March so Captain Henry M. Mullinnix assumed command on 7 April.
With the withdrawal of &quot;Enterprise&quot; in early May, &quot;Saratoga&quot; became the only operational American fleet carrier in the South Pacific. Task Force 14, as her group was now known, was reinforced by the anti-aircraft cruiser on 3 May and by the British fleet carrier on 17 May. At this time Saratoga embarked 34 Wildcats of VF-5, 37 Dauntlesses of VB-3 and VS-3 and 16 Avengers of VT-3 Ramsey&#x27;s force was intended to provide distant cover for the impending landings on New Georgia and to prevent intervention by any Japanese carriers. The two carriers spent some weeks familiarizing each other with their capabilities and tactics and Ramsey decided to take advantage of each carrier&#x27;s strengths. He ordered that the Avengers of 832 Squadron be exchanged for 24 Wildcats from VF-3 as &quot;Victorious&quot; had difficulty operating the large Avenger and the British carrier possessed better facilities for coordinating fighter operations than &quot;Saratoga&quot;; the latter retained a dozen Wildcats for self-defense and escort duties. Fortunately, Ramsey never got a chance to test his reorganization as the Japanese carriers made no effort to attack the American transports. Ramsey was relieved on 26 July and replaced by Rear Admiral Frederick C. Sherman. &quot;Victorious&quot; sailed on 31 July for home and left eleven Avengers behind as reserves for &quot;Saratoga&quot;.

Carrier Air Group 12 was assigned to &quot;Saratoga&quot; in lieu of Carrier Air Group 3 and flew aboard on 1 August. It was composed of VF-12, VB-12 and VT-12; the fighter and dive bomber squadrons each had 36 aircraft and the torpedo bomber squadron had half that number. Grumman F6F Hellcats replaced the Wildcats formerly used. The task force was redesignated as Task Force 38 on 4 August and Captain John H. Cassady relieved Mullinix on 22 August after the latter was promoted. The ship was based at Havannah Harbor, Efate and Espiritu Santo from August through November. While refueling at sea on the night of 12 October, &quot;Saratoga&quot; collided with the oiler , damaging three of her 20-millimeter guns on her port side. On 22 October, she was joined by the light aircraft carrier .

On 27 October, Task Force 38 provided air cover for the invasion of the Treasury Islands, part of the preliminary operations for the invasion of Bougainville Island scheduled a few days later. On the morning of 1 November, &quot;Saratoga&quot;″s aircraft neutralized Japanese airfields at the northern end of the island and on Buka Island. They destroyed 15 Japanese aircraft while losing three Hellcats, one Dauntless, and two Avengers to all causes. While the task force was refuelling on 3–4 November, reconnaissance aircraft discovered Japanese cruisers massing at Rabaul and Admiral Halsey ordered Task Force 38 to attack them with maximal force before they could engage the transports at Bougainville. This translated into an attack group of 23 Avengers and 22 Dauntlesses, escorted by every available fighter on board the two carriers on 5 November; CAP over the carriers was provided by fighters flying from New Georgia. The attack caught the Japanese by surprise and badly damaged four heavy cruisers, two light cruisers, and a destroyer for the loss of only nine aircraft to all causes.

&quot;Saratoga&quot; and &quot;Princeton&quot; attacked Rabaul again on 11 November in conjunction with three carriers of Task Group 50.3. They attacked first, but inflicted little damage due to poor visibility; the other carriers were more successful and further damaged the ships at Rabaul. Task Force 38 returned to Espiritu Santo on 14 November. Now known as Task Group 50.4, &quot;Saratoga&quot; and &quot;Princeton&quot; were tasked as the &quot;Relief Carrier Group&quot; for the offensive in the Gilbert Islands. As part of the preliminary operations, they attacked Nauru on 19 November, destroying two fighters and three G4Ms on the ground. As the carriers were withdrawing, they were unsuccessfully attacked by eight more G4Ms, shooting down half of their attackers. TF 50.2 was not attacked during the battle and &quot;Saratoga&quot; transferred a number of her aircraft to replace losses aboard the other carriers before departing for Pearl Harbor on 30 November. She arrived on 4 December and off-loaded her aircraft and stores before proceeding to San Francisco where she arrived on 9 December for a refit and augmentation of her anti-aircraft guns.

====1944====

&quot;Saratoga&quot;″s refit was completed on 2 January 1944 and she arrived at Pearl Harbor on 7 January. The ship, now the flagship of Rear Admiral Samuel Ginder, commander of Task Group 58.4, sailed from Pearl Harbor on 19 January with and &quot;Princeton&quot;, to support the invasion of the Marshall Islands scheduled to begin on 1 February. Her air group at this time consisted of 36 Hellcats of VF-12, 24 Dauntlesses of VB-12 and eight Avengers of VT-8. As part of the preliminary operations, aircraft from the Task Group attacked airfields at Wotje and Taroa on 29–31 January, radio stations at Rongelap and Utirik Atoll on 1 February, and then attacked Engebi, the main island at Eniwetok Atoll, from 3 to 6 February, refuelled, and attacked Japanese defenses at Eniwetok again from 10 to 12 February. They provided air support during the entire Battle of Eniwetok which began on 17 February with landings at Engebi and continued until the islands were secured on 24 February. They then protected the Allied forces there until 28 February when land-based aircraft assumed that role.

On 4 March, &quot;Saratoga&quot; departed Majuro with an escort of three destroyers to reinforce the Eastern Fleet in the Indian Ocean for attacks on Japanese-controlled territory. She rendezvoused at sea on 27 March with the British force and arrived at Trincomalee, Ceylon, on 31 March. During the next two weeks, the carriers conducted intensive training and rehearsing with the fleet carrier for an attack on the port city of Sabang (Operation Cockpit) scheduled for 19 April. For this operation, &quot;Saratoga&quot; mustered 27 Hellcats, 24 Dauntlesses and 18 Avengers. The carrier launched 24 Hellcats, 11 Avengers and 18 Dauntlesses while &quot;Illustrious&quot; contributed 17 Fairey Barracuda bombers and 13 Vought F4U Corsair fighters. The attack caught the Japanese by surprise and there was no aerial opposition, so the escorts strafed the airfield and destroyed 24 aircraft on the ground. The port facilities and oil storage tanks were heavily damaged and one small freighter was sunk for the loss of one Hellcat to flak. The Japanese attempted to attack the fleet with three G4Ms as it was withdrawing, but the CAP shot down all three bombers. Sailing from Ceylon on 6 May, the task force attacked the oil refinery at Surabaya, Java, on 17 May after refueling at Exmouth Gulf, Australia. Little damage was inflicted on the refinery and only one small ship was sunk for the loss of one of VT-3&#x27;s Avengers. &quot;Saratoga&quot; was relieved from its assignment with the British the next day and ordered back to Pearl.

The ship arrived at Pearl on 10 June and remained for several days before departing for Bremerton to begin an overhaul scheduled to last several months. Captain Cassady was relieved by Captain Thomas Sisson on 22 June although he was only briefly in command before Captain Lucian A. Moebus assumed command on 31 July. &quot;Saratoga&quot; completed her post-refit sea trials on 13 September and arrived at the Naval Air Station Alameda on 16 September to begin loading 85 aircraft, 1500 passengers and cargo bound for Pearl Harbor. She departed San Francisco two days later and arrived on 24 September. The ship was assigned to Carrier Division 11 which was tasked to train night fighter pilots and to develop night tactics and doctrine. Rear Admiral Matthias Gardner made &quot;Saratoga&quot; his flagship on 10 October. Four days later, the ship was accidentally rammed by her plane guard destroyer , gashing the port side of her hull. Operations were immediately cancelled and she returned to port for temporary repairs. Permanent repairs were made during a brief refit during the first week of November. Carrier qualification and other training continued through most of January 1945.

====1945====
On 29 January 1945, &quot;Saratoga&quot; departed Pearl Harbor for Ulithi Atoll to rendezvous with the &quot;Enterprise&quot; and form a night fighter task group (TG 58.5/Night Carrier Division 7) along with &quot;Enterprise&quot;, to provide air cover for the amphibious landings on Iwo Jima. She arrived on 8 February with the 53 Hellcats and 17 Avengers of Carrier Air Group (Night) 53 aboard and sailed two days later.
The carrier force carried out diversionary strikes on the Japanese home islands on the nights of 16 and 17 February, before the landings began. &quot;Saratoga&quot; was assigned to provide fighter cover while the remaining carriers launched the strikes on Japan, but in the process, her fighters raided two Japanese airfields. The force fueled on 18 and 19 February, and the ship provided CAP over Iwo Jima on 19–20 February. The following day, &quot;Saratoga&quot; was detached with an escort of three destroyers to join the amphibious forces and carry out night patrols over Iwo Jima and nearby Chichi Jima. Taking advantage of low cloud cover and &quot;Saratoga&quot;″s weak escort, six Japanese planes scored five bomb hits on the carrier in three minutes; three of the aircraft also struck the carrier. &quot;Saratoga&quot;″s flight deck forward was wrecked, her starboard side was holed twice and large fires were started in her hangar deck; she lost 123 of her crew dead or missing as well as 192 wounded. Forty of her aircraft were destroyed, including 31 Grumman F6F Hellcat fighters and 9 Grumman TBM Avenger torpedo bombers. Another attack two hours later further damaged her flight deck. Slightly over an hour later, the fires were under control, and &quot;Saratoga&quot; was able to recover six fighters. The ship was sent to Bremerton for permanent repairs, arriving there on 16 March.

Because of &quot;Saratoga&quot;″s age and the number of modern carriers in service, the Navy decided to modify her into a training carrier. The aft elevator and its machinery were removed, the opening was plated over and the forward elevator was replaced with a larger model. Part of the hangar deck was converted into classrooms. While the ship was still under repair Captain Frank Akers assumed command on 27 April. The post-refit machinery trials on 12 May revealed some problems with one turbine, and an explosion in one 5-inch gun wounded eleven men and wrecked the mount. The full-power trials were completed on 20 May and a new mount was loaded aboard to be installed at Pearl. The ship sailed for NAS Alameda a few days later where she picked up 60 aircraft, 1,200 passengers and some trucks for delivery in Pearl. &quot;Saratoga&quot; arrived on 1 June and became the flagship of Rear Admiral Ralph F. Jennings, commander of Carrier Division 11. She resumed carrier qualification training on 3 June until she returned to the dockyard on 10 June for the installation of her replacement five-inch gun mount. Jennings transferred his flag to another carrier from 11 to 30 June. She continued training carrier pilots after the Japanese surrender until 6 September.
Over the span of the ship&#x27;s 17-year career, &quot;Saratoga&quot;″s aviators landed on her deck 98,549 times, then the record for the most carrier landings. &quot;Saratoga&quot; received eight battle stars for her World War II service. After the war, the ship took part in Operation Magic Carpet, the repatriation of American servicemen from the European, Pacific, and Asian theaters. She left Hawaii on 9 September with 3,712 Navy officers and enlisted men bound for the United States. In the course of the operation, she returned 29,204 veterans, the highest total for any individual vessel.

===Postwar years===
&quot;Saratoga&quot; was surplus to postwar requirements with the large numbers of &quot;Essex&quot;-class carriers in service, and she was assigned to Operation Crossroads on 22 January 1946.

====Operation Crossroads====
This was a test conducted at Bikini Atoll to evaluate the effect of the atomic bomb on ships. Captain Stanhope Ring assumed command on 6 March, but was relieved on 2 June by Captain Donald MacMahan. The ship hosted comedian Jack Benny&#x27;s radio show on 21 April, while &quot;Saratoga&quot; was berthed in San Francisco before her departure for Bikini. She departed from pier 33 and headed out the Golden Gate on 1 May 1946.
Operation Crossroads began with the first blast (Test Able), an air burst on 1 July 1946. &quot;Saratoga&quot; survived the explosion with only minor damage, including the ignition of the teak of her flight deck. A skeleton crew boarded &quot;Saratoga&quot; the following day to prepare her for the next test on 25 July. The ship was sunk by Test Baker, an underwater blast which was detonated under from the carrier. The force of the explosion lifted the vessel out of the water, knocked everything off her flight deck and knocked most of her funnel onto the flight deck. She was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 15 August 1946.

In recent years, the submerged wreck, the top of which is only below the surface, has become a scuba diving destination, one of only three carrier wrecks accessible to recreational divers (the others are the , in the Gulf of Mexico, and , off Batticaloa in Sri Lanka.) After a hiatus of several years, dive trips resumed in 2011.

==Awards and decorations==
&quot;Saratoga&quot; received four campaign decorations for her service during the Second World War, with eight battle stars awarded for action in the Pacific.

<text>Kurt Wüthrich (born 4 October 1938 in Aarberg, Canton of Bern) is a Swiss chemist/biophysicist and Nobel Chemistry laureate, known for developing nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) methods for studying biological macromolecules.

== Education and early life ==
Born in Aarberg, Switzerland, Wüthrich was educated in chemistry, physics, and mathematics at the University of Bern before pursuing his PhD supervised by Silvio Fallab at the University of Basel, awarded in 1964.

== Career ==
After his PhD, Wüthrich continued postdoctoral research with Fallab for a short time before leaving to work at the University of California, Berkeley for two years from 1965 with Robert E. Connick. That was followed by a stint working with Robert G. Shulman at the Bell Telephone Laboratories in Murray Hill, New Jersey from 1967 to 1969.

Wüthrich returned to Switzerland, to Zürich, in 1969, where he began his career there at the ETH Zürich, rising to Professor of Biophysics by 1980. He currently maintains a laboratory at the ETH Zürich, at The Scripps Research Institute, in La Jolla, California and at the of ShanghaiTech University. He has also been a visiting professor at the University of Edinburgh (1997–2000), the Chinese University of Hong Kong (where he was an Honorary Professor) and Yonsei University.

During his graduate studies Wüthrich started out working with electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, and the subject of his PhD thesis was &quot;the catalytic activity of copper compounds in autoxidation reactions&quot;. During his time as a postdoc in Berkeley he began working with the newly developed and related technique of nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to study the hydration of metal complexes. When Wüthrich joined the Bell Labs, he was put in charge of one of the first superconducting NMR spectrometers, and started studying the structure and dynamics of proteins. He has pursued this line of research ever since.

After returning to Switzerland, Wüthrich collaborated with, among others, Nobel laureate Richard R. Ernst on developing the first two-dimensional NMR experiments, and established the nuclear Overhauser effect as a convenient way of measuring distances within proteins. This research later led to the complete assignment of resonances for among others the bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor and glucagon.

In October 2010, Wüthrich participated in the USA Science and Engineering Festival&#x27;s Lunch with a Laureate program where middle and high school students will get to engage in an informal conversation with a Nobel Prize–winning scientist over a brown-bag lunch. Wüthrich is also a member on the USA Science and Engineering Festival&#x27;s Advisory Board and a supporter of the Campaign for the Establishment of a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly, an organisation which campaigns for democratic reform in the United Nations.

== Awards and honors ==
He was awarded the Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize from Columbia University in 1991, the Louis-Jeantet Prize for Medicine in 1993, the Otto Warburg Medal in 1999 and half of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2002 for &quot;his development of nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy for determining the three-dimensional structure of biological macromolecules in solution&quot;. He received the Bijvoet Medal of the Bijvoet Center for Biomolecular Research of Utrecht University in 2008. He was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 2010. He was also awarded the 2018 Fray International Sustainability Award at SIPS 2018 by FLOGEN Star Outreach.

== Personal details ==
On 2 April 2018, Dr. Wüthrich established permanent residency in Shanghai, China, after obtaining a Chinese permanent residence card.

Born in Cahors, Gambetta is said to have inherited his vigour and eloquence from his father, a Genoese grocer who had married a Frenchwoman named Massabie. At the age of fifteen, Gambetta lost the sight of his right eye in an accident, and it eventually had to be removed. Despite this disability, he distinguished himself at school in Cahors. He then worked at his father&#x27;s grocery shop in Cahors, the &quot;Bazar génois&quot; (&quot;Genoese bazaar&quot;), and in 1857 went to study at the Faculty of Law of Paris. His temperament gave him great influence among the students of the &quot;Quartier latin&quot;, and he was soon known as an inveterate enemy of the imperial government.

==Career==
Gambetta was called to the bar in 1859. 
He was admitted to the Conférence Molé in 1861 and wrote to his father, &quot;It is no mere lawyers club, but a veritable political assembly with a left, a right, a center; legislative proposals are the sole subject of discussion. It is there that are formed all the political men of France; it is a veritable training ground for the tribune.&quot;
Gambetta, like many other French orators, learned the art of public speaking at the Molé.

However, although he contributed to a Liberal review edited by Challemel-Lacour, Gambetta did not make much of an impression until, on 17 November 1868, he was selected to defend the journalist Delescluze. Delescluze was being prosecuted for having promoted a monument to the representative Baudin, who had been killed while resisting the &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; of 1851, and Gambetta seized his opportunity to attack both the &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; and the government with a vigour which made him immediately famous.

In May 1869, he was elected to the Assembly, both by a district in Paris and another in Marseille, defeating Hippolyte Carnot for the former constituency and Adolphe Thiers and Ferdinand de Lesseps for the latter. He chose to sit for Marseille, and lost no opportunity of attacking the Empire in the Assembly. Early in his political career, Gambetta was influenced by &quot;Le Programme de Belleville&quot;, the seventeen statutes that defined the radical program in French politics throughout the Third Republic. 

This made him the leading defender of the lower classes in the Corps Législatif. On 17 January 1870, he spoke out against naming a new Imperial Lord Privy Seal, putting him into direct conflict with the regime&#x27;s de facto prime minister, Émile Ollivier. (see Reinach, J., &quot;Discours et plaidoyers politiques de M. Gambetta&quot;, I.102 – 113) His powerful oratory caused a complete breakdown of order in the Corps. The Monarchist Right continually tried to interrupt his speech, only to have Gambetta&#x27;s supporters on the Left attack them. The disagreement reached a high point when M. le Président Schneider asked him to bring his supporters back into order. Gambetta responded, thundering, &quot;l&#x27;indignation exclut le calme!&quot; (&quot;indignation excludes calm!&quot;) (Reinach, &quot;Discours et plaidoyers politiques de M. Gambetta&quot;, I.112)

It was also in 1869 that Gambetta was initiated into Freemasonry at &quot;La Réforme&quot; lodge in Paris, sponsored by Louis-Antoine Garnier-Pagès. In this lodge he met Gustave Naquet and Maurice Rouvier.

===Proclamation of the Republic===

Gambetta opposed the declaration of the Franco-Prussian War. He did not, however, like some of his colleagues, refuse to vote for funds for the army. On 2 September 1870, the French Army suffered a disastrous defeat at the Battle of Sedan, in which the emperor Napoleon III surrendered and was taken prisoner. The news arrived in Paris on the night of 3 September, and early on 4 September large-scale protests began in the capital. 

Parisians broke into the Palais Bourbon, meeting place of the Chamber of Deputies, interrupting a session and calling for a Republic. Later that day, from the Hôtel de Ville, Gambetta proclaimed the French Republic to a large crowd gathered in the Place de l&#x27;Hôtel-de-Ville:

===Government of National Defense===

Gambetta was one of the first members of the new Government of National Defense, becoming Minister of the Interior. He advised his colleagues to leave Paris and run the government from some provincial city.

This advice was rejected because of fear of another revolution in Paris, and a delegation to organize resistance in the provinces was dispatched to Tours, but when this was seen to be ineffective, Gambetta himself left Paris 7 October with Eugène Spuller in a coal gas-filled balloon—the &quot;Armand-Barbès&quot;—and upon arriving at Tours took control as minister of the interior and of war. Aided by Freycinet, a young officer of engineers, as his assistant secretary of war, he quickly organized an army, which might have relieved Paris if Metz had held out, but Bazaine&#x27;s surrender brought the army of the Prussian prince Friederich Karl back into the field, and success was impossible. After the French defeat near Orléans early in December the seat of government was transferred to Bordeaux.

==Self-exile to San Sebastián==

Gambetta had hoped for a republican majority in the general elections on 8 February 1871. These hopes vanished when the conservatives and Monarchists won nearly 2/3 of the six hundred Assembly seats. He had won elections in eight different &quot;départements&quot;, but the ultimate victor was the Orléanist Adolphe Thiers, winner of twenty-three elections. Thiers&#x27;s conservative and bourgeois intentions clashed with the growing expectations of political power by the lower classes. Hoping to continue his policy of &quot;guerre à outrance&quot; against the Prussian invaders, he tried in vain to rally the Assembly to the war cause. However, Thiers&#x27; peace treaty on 1 March 1871 ended the conflict. Gambetta, disgusted with the Assembly&#x27;s unwillingness to fight, resigned and quit France for San Sebastián in Spain.

Meanwhile, the Paris Commune had taken control of the city. Despite his earlier career, Gambetta voiced his opposition to the Commune in a letter to Antonin Proust, his former secretary while Minister of the Interior, in which he referred to the Commune as &quot;les horribles aventures dans lesquelles s&#x27;engage ce qui reste de cette malheureuse France - the ghastly madness blighting what remains of our poor France&quot;.

Gambetta&#x27;s stance has been explained by reference to his status as a republican lawyer, who fought from the bar instead of the barricade and also to his father having been a grocer in Marseille. As a small-scale producer during the decades of the Second Industrial Revolution in France, Joseph Gambetta was nearly ruined by the competition of new chain-store food shops. This sort of &quot;big business&quot; made the hard-working middle-class - &quot;petite bourgeoisie&quot; - very resentful, not only of bourgeois industrial capitalism, but also of the working class, which now held the status of backbone of the French economy, rather than the class of small, independent shopkeepers. This resentment may have been passed down from father to son, and manifested itself in an unwillingness to support the lower-class Communards in their usurpation of what the &quot;petite bourgeoisie&quot; had won a certain hegemony over.

===Return===


On 24 June 1871, a letter was sent by Gambetta to his Parisian confidant, Dr. Édouard Fieuzal:

Gambetta returned to the political stage and won on three separate ballots. On 5 November 1871 he established a journal, &quot;La Republique française&quot;, which soon became the most influential in France. His public speeches were more effective than those delivered in the Assembly, especially the one at Bordeaux. His turn towards moderate republicanism first became apparent in Firminy, a small coal-mining town along the Loire River. There, he boldly proclaimed the radical republic he once supported to be &quot;avoided like the plague&quot; (&quot;se tenir éloignés comme de la peste&quot;) (Discours, III.5). From there, he went to Grenoble. On 26 September 1872, he proclaimed the future of the Republic to be in the hands of &quot;a new social level&quot; (&quot;une couche sociale nouvelle&quot;) (Discours, III.101), ostensibly the petite bourgeoisie to which his father belonged.

When Adolphe Thiers resigned in May 1873, and a Royalist, Marshal MacMahon, was placed at the head of the government, Gambetta urged his friends to a moderate course. By his tact, parliamentary dexterity and eloquence, he was instrumental in voting in the French Constitutional Laws of 1875 in February 1875. He gave this policy the appropriate name of &quot;opportunism,&quot; and became one of the leader of the &quot;Opportunist Republicans.&quot; On 4 May 1877, he denounced &quot;clericalism&quot; as the enemy. During the 16 May 1877 crisis, Gambetta, in a speech at Lille on 15 August called on President MacMahon &quot;se soumettre ou se démettre&quot;, to submit to parliament&#x27;s majority or to resign. Gambetta then campaigned to rouse the republican party throughout France, which culminated in a speech at Romans (18 September 1878) formulating its programme. MacMahon, unwilling both to resign and to provoke civil war, had no choice but to dismiss his advisers and form a moderate republican ministry under the premiership of Dufaure.

When the downfall of the Dufaure cabinet brought about MacMahon&#x27;s resignation, Gambetta declined to become a candidate for the presidency, but supported Jules Grévy; nor did he attempt to form a ministry, but accepted the office of president of the chamber of deputies in January 1879. This position did not prevent his occasionally descending from the presidential chair to make speeches, one of which, advocating an amnesty to the &quot;communards&quot;, was especially memorable. Although he directed the policy of the various ministries from behind the scenes, he evidently thought that the time was not ripe for asserting openly his direction of the policy of the Republic, and seemed inclined to observe a neutral attitude as far as possible. However, events hurried him on, and early in 1881 he headed off a movement for restoring &quot;scrutin de liste&quot;, or the system by which deputies are returned by the entire department which they represent, so that each elector votes for several representatives at once, in place of &quot;scrutin d&#x27;arrondissement&quot;, the system of small constituencies, giving one member to each district and one for vote to each elector. A bill to re-establish &quot;scrutin de liste&quot; was passed by the Assembly on 19 May 1881, but rejected by the Senate on 19 June.

This personal rebuff could not alter the fact that his name was on the lips of voters at the election. His supporters won a large majority, and Jules Ferry&#x27;s cabinet quickly resigned. Gambetta was unwillingly asked by Grévy on 24 November 1881 to form a ministry, known as &quot;Le Grand Ministère&quot;. Many suspected him of desiring a dictatorship; unjust attacks were directed against him from all sides, and his cabinet fell on 26 January 1882, after only sixty-six days. Had he remained in office, he would have cultivated the British alliance and cooperated with Britain in Egypt; and when the succeeding Freycinet government shrank from that enterprise only to see it undertaken with signal success by Britain alone, Gambetta&#x27;s foresight was quickly justified.

On 31 December 1882, at his house in Ville d&#x27;Avray, near Sèvres, he died from intestine or stomach cancer. Even though he was wounded a month earlier from an accidental revolver discharge, the injury had not been life-threatening. Five artists, Jules Bastien-Lepage, a realist painter, Antonin Proust, defender of the vanguard who Gambetta had named Minister of Fine Arts, Léon Bonnat, an academic painter, Alexandre Falguière, who did his mortuary mask, and his personal photographer Étienne Carjat all sat at his death-bed, making five widely different representations of him which were each published by the press the following day. His public funeral was on 6 January 1883.

==Personal life==

The love of his life was his connection with Léonie Léon, the full details of which were not known to the public until her death in 1906. She was the daughter of a creole French artillery officer. Gambetta fell in love with her in 1871. She became his mistress, and the liaison lasted until he died. Gambetta constantly urged her to marry him during this period, but she always refused, fearing to compromise his career; she remained, however, his confidante and intimate adviser in all his political plans. It seems she had just consented to become his wife, and the date of the marriage had been fixed, when the accident which caused his death occurred in her presence. Contradictory accounts of this fatal episode exist, but it was certainly accidental, and not suicide. Her influence on Gambetta was absorbing, both as lover and as politician, and the correspondence which has been published shows how much he depended upon her.

However, some of her later recollections are untrustworthy. For example, she claimed that a meeting took place in 1878 between Gambetta and Bismarck. That Gambetta after 1875 felt strongly that relations between France and Germany might be improved, and that he made it his object, by travelling incognito, to become better acquainted with Germany and the adjoining states, may be accepted, but M. Laur appears to have exaggerated the extent to which any actual negotiations took place. On the other hand, the increased knowledge of Gambetta&#x27;s attitude towards European politics which later information has supplied confirms the view that when he died, France had prematurely lost a clear thinker whom she could ill spare. In April 1905 a monument by Dalou to his memory at Bordeaux was unveiled by President Loubet.

==Legacy==


Gambetta proclamation of the Republic and call for a Levée en masse left a lasting impact on Germany in the decades following. Future Field Marshall Colmar Freiherr von der Goltz wrote in 1877:

In October 1918, when Germany was on the verge of defeat during the First World War, industrialist Walther Rathenau called for a German &quot;Levée en masse&quot; to reverse the deteriorating situation. Conservative Revolutionary Edgar Jung was also inspired by Gambetta. Adolf Hitler favorably contrasted Gambetta&#x27;s actions with that of the post-revolutionary leaders of the Weimar Republic:

A tall was planned in 1884 and erected in 1888 in the central space of the Louvre Palace, now Cour Napoléon. That initiative carried heavy political symbolism, since Gambetta was widely viewed as the founder of the Third Republic, and his outsized celebration in the middle of Napoleon III&#x27;s Louvre expansion thus affirmed the final victory of republicanism over monarchism nearly a century after the French Revolution – in the same vein, the Gambetta monument visually overpowered Napoleon&#x27;s comparatively diminutive Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel. Most of the monument&#x27;s sculptures were in bronze and in 1941 were melted for military use by German occupying forces. What remained of the Gambetta Monument was dismantled in 1954.

A stone urn containing Gambetta&#x27;s heart was placed in 1920 in the monumental staircase leading to the crypt of the Panthéon in Paris. The Russian red quartzite stone that was used for the urn was part of the same shipment that was used for Napoleon&#x27;s tomb at Les Invalides.

<text>William Shakespeare (1564–1616) wrote sonnets on a variety of themes. When discussing or referring to Shakespeare&#x27;s sonnets, it is almost always a reference to the 154 sonnets that were first published all together in a quarto in 1609. However, there are six additional sonnets that Shakespeare wrote and included in the plays &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, &quot;Henry V&quot; and &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost&quot;. There is also a partial sonnet found in the play &quot;Edward III&quot;.

==Context==
Shakespeare&#x27;s sonnets are considered a continuation of the sonnet tradition that swept through the Renaissance from Petrarch in 14th-century Italy and was finally introduced in 16th-century England by Thomas Wyatt and was given its rhyming metre and division into quatrains by Henry Howard. With few exceptions, Shakespeare&#x27;s sonnets observe the stylistic form of the English sonnet—the rhyme scheme, the 14 lines, and the metre. But, Shakespeare&#x27;s sonnets introduce significant departures of content.

Instead of expressing worshipful love for an almost goddess-like yet unobtainable female love-object, as Petrarch, Dante, and Philip Sidney had done, Shakespeare introduces a young man. He also introduces the Dark Lady. Shakespeare explores themes such as lust, homoeroticism, misogyny, infidelity, and acrimony.

==The quarto of 1609==
The primary source of Shakespeare&#x27;s sonnets is a quarto published in 1609 titled &quot;Shake-speare&#x27;s Sonnets.&quot; It contains 154 sonnets, which are followed by the long poem &quot;A Lover&#x27;s Complaint&quot;. Thirteen copies of the quarto have survived in fairly good shape. There is evidence in a note on the title page of one of the extant copies that the great Elizabethan actor Edward Alleyn bought a copy in June 1609 for one shilling.

The sonnets cover such themes as the passage of time, love, infidelity, jealousy, beauty and mortality. The first 126 are addressed to a young man; the last 28 are either addressed to, or refer to, a woman. (Sonnets 138 and 144 had previously been published in the 1599 miscellany &quot;The Passionate Pilgrim&quot;.)

The title of the quarto, &quot;Shake-speare&#x27;s Sonnets&quot;, is consistent with the entry in the &quot;Stationers&#x27; Register&quot;. The title appears in upper case lettering on the title page, where it is followed by the phrase &quot;Neuer before Imprinted&quot;. The title also appears every time the quarto is opened. That the author&#x27;s name in a possessive form is part of the title sets it apart from all other sonnet collections of the time, except for one—Sir Philip Sidney&#x27;s posthumous 1591 publication that is titled, &quot;Syr. P.S. his Astrophel and Stella&quot;, which is considered one of Shakespeare&#x27;s most important models. Sidney&#x27;s title may have inspired Shakespeare, particularly if the &quot;W.H.&quot; of Shakespeare&#x27;s dedication is Sidney&#x27;s nephew and heir, William Herbert. The idea that the persona referred to as the speaker of Shakespeare&#x27;s sonnets might be Shakespeare himself, is aggressively repudiated by scholars; however, the title of the quarto does seem to encourage that kind of speculation.

The first 17 poems, traditionally called the procreation sonnets, are addressed to the young man—urging him to marry and have children in order to immortalize his beauty by passing it to the next generation. Other sonnets express the speaker&#x27;s love for the young man; brood upon loneliness, death, and the transience of life; seem to criticise the young man for preferring a rival poet; express ambiguous feelings for the speaker&#x27;s mistress; and pun on the poet&#x27;s name. The final two sonnets are allegorical treatments of Greek epigrams referring to the &quot;little love-god&quot; Cupid.

The publisher, Thomas Thorpe, entered the book in the &quot;Stationers&#x27; Register&quot; on 20 May 1609:

: Tho. Thorpe. Entred for his copie under the handes of master Wilson and master Lownes Wardenes a booke called Shakespeares sonnettes vjd.

Whether Thorpe used an authorised manuscript from Shakespeare or an unauthorised copy is unknown. George Eld printed the quarto, and the run was divided between the booksellers William Aspley and John Wright.

===Dedication===

&quot;Shakespeare&#x27;s Sonnets&quot; include a dedication to &quot;Mr. W.H.&quot;:

The upper case letters and the stops that follow each word of the dedication were probably intended to resemble an ancient Roman lapidary inscription or monumental brass, perhaps accentuating the declaration in Sonnet 55 that the work would confer immortality to the subjects of the work:
The initials &quot;T.T.&quot; are taken to refer to the publisher, Thomas Thorpe. Thorpe usually signed prefatory matter only if the author was out of the country or dead, which suggests that Shakespeare was not in London during the last stage of printing. However, Thorpe&#x27;s entire corpus of such consists of only four dedications and three prefaces. It has been suggested that Thorpe signing the dedication, rather than the author, might indicate that Thorpe published the work without obtaining Shakespeare&#x27;s permission. Though Thorpe&#x27;s taking on the dedication may be explained by the great demands of business and travel that Shakespeare was facing at this time, which may have caused him to deal with the printing production in haste before rushing out of town. After all, May 1609 was an extraordinary time: That month saw a serious outbreak of the plague, which shut down the theatres, and also caused many to flee London. Plus Shakespeare&#x27;s theatre company was on tour from Ipswich to Oxford. In addition, Shakespeare had been away from Stratford and in the same month, May, was being called on to tend to family and business there, and deal with the litigation of a lawsuit in Warwickshire that involved a substantial amount of money.

====Mr. W. H., the dedicatee====
The identity of Mr. W.H., &quot;the only begetter of &quot;Shakespeare&#x27;s Sonnets&quot;&quot;, is not known for certain. His identity has been the subject of a great amount of speculation: That he was the author&#x27;s patron, that he was both patron and the &quot;faire youth&quot; who is addressed in the sonnets, that the &quot;faire youth&quot; is based on Mr. W.H. in some sonnets but not others, and a number of other ideas.


William Herbert, the Earl of Pembroke, is seen as perhaps the most likely identity of Mr. W.H. and the &quot;young man&quot;. He was the dedicatee of the First Folio. Thorpe would have been unlikely to have addressed a lord as &quot;Mr&quot;, but there may be an explanation, perhaps that form of address came from the author, who wanted to refer to Herbert at an earlier time—when Herbert was a &quot;younger man&quot;. There is a later dedication to Herbert in another quarto of verse, Ben Jonson&#x27;s &quot;Epigrammes&quot; (1616), in which the text of Jonson&#x27;s dedication begins, &quot;MY LORD, While you cannot change your merit, I dare not change your title … &quot; Jonson&#x27;s emphasis on Pembroke&#x27;s title, and his comment, seem to be chiding someone else who had the audacity to use the wrong title, as perhaps is the case in Shakespeare&#x27;s dedication.

Henry Wriothesley (the Earl of Southampton), with initials reversed, has received a great deal of consideration as a likely possibility. He was the dedicatee of Shakespeare&#x27;s poems &quot;Venus and Adonis&quot; and &quot;The Rape of Lucrece&quot;. Southampton was also known for his good looks.

Other suggestions include:
* A simple printing error for Shakespeare&#x27;s initials, &quot;W.S.&quot; or &quot;W. Sh&quot;. This was suggested by Bertrand Russell, Jonathan Bate, and Donald W. Foster.
* William Hall, a printer who had worked with Thorpe. It is noted that &quot;ALL&quot; following &quot;MR. W. H.&quot; spells &quot;MR. W. HALL&quot;. Using his initials W.H., Hall had edited a collection of the poems of Robert Southwell that was printed by George Eld, the printer of the 1609 Sonnets.
* Sir William Harvey, Southampton&#x27;s stepfather.
* William Haughton, a contemporary dramatist.
* William Hart, Shakespeare&#x27;s nephew and male heir.
* Who He. It has been argued that the dedication is deliberately ambiguous, possibly standing for &quot;Who He&quot;, a conceit also used in a contemporary pamphlet. It might have been created by Thorpe to encourage speculation and discussion (and hence, sales).
* Willie Hughes. The 18th-century scholar Thomas Tyrwhitt proposed &quot;William Hughes&quot;, based on puns on the name in the sonnets (notably Sonnet 20). This idea is expressed in Oscar Wilde&#x27;s short story &quot;The Portrait of Mr. W. H.&quot;, and that the sonnets were written to a young actor who played female roles in Shakespeare&#x27;s plays.

===Form and structure of the sonnets===

The sonnets are almost all constructed using three quatrains (four-line stanzas) followed by a final couplet. The sonnets are composed in iambic pentameter, the metre used in Shakespeare&#x27;s plays.

The rhyme scheme is ABAB CDCD EFEF GG. Sonnets using this scheme are known as Shakespearean sonnets, or English sonnets, or Elizabethan sonnets. Often, at the end of the third quatrain occurs the &quot;volta&quot; (&quot;turn&quot;), where the mood of the poem shifts, and the poet expresses a turn of thought.

The exceptions are sonnets 99, 126, and 145. Number 99 has fifteen lines. Number 126 consists of six couplets, and two blank lines marked with italic brackets; 145 is in iambic tetrameters, not pentameters. In one other variation on the standard structure, found for example in sonnet 29, the rhyme scheme is changed by repeating the second (B) rhyme of quatrain one as the second (F) rhyme of quatrain three.

Apart from rhyme, and considering only the arrangement of ideas, and the placement of the volta, a number of sonnets maintain the two-part organization of the Italian sonnet. In that case the term &quot;octave&quot; and &quot;sestet&quot; are commonly used to refer to the sonnet&#x27;s first eight lines followed by the remaining six lines. There are other line-groupings as well, as Shakespeare finds inventive ways with the content of the fourteen-line poems.

===Characters of the sonnets===
When analysed as characters, the subjects of the sonnets are usually referred to as the Fair Youth, the Rival Poet, and the Dark Lady. The speaker expresses admiration for the Fair Youth&#x27;s beauty, and—if reading the sonnets in chronological order as published—later has an affair with the Dark Lady, then so does the Fair Youth. Current linguistic analysis and historical evidence suggests, however, that the sonnets to the Dark Lady were composed first (around 1591–95), the procreation sonnets next, and the later sonnets to the Fair Youth last (1597–1603). It is not known whether the poems and their characters are fiction or autobiographical; scholars who find the sonnets to be autobiographical have attempted to identify the characters with historical individuals.

====Fair Youth====
The &quot;Fair Youth&quot; is the unnamed young man addressed by the poet in Sonnets 1–126. The young man is handsome, self-centred, universally admired and much sought after. The sequence begins with the poet urging the young man to marry and father children (sonnets 1–17). It continues with the friendship developing with the poet&#x27;s loving admiration, which at times is homoerotic in nature. Then comes a set of betrayals by the young man, as he is seduced by the Dark Lady, and they maintain a liaison (sonnets 133, 134 &amp; 144), all of which the poet struggles to abide. It concludes with the poet&#x27;s own act of betrayal, resulting in his independence from the fair youth (sonnet 152).

The identity of the Fair Youth has been the subject of speculation among scholars. One popular theory is that he was Henry Wriothesley, the 3rd Earl of Southampton; this is based in part on the idea that his physical features, age, and personality might fairly match the young man in the sonnets. He was both an admirer and patron of Shakespeare and was considered one of the most prominent nobles of the period. It is also noted that Shakespeare&#x27;s 1593 poem &quot;Venus and Adonis&quot; is dedicated to Southampton and, in that poem a young man, Adonis, is encouraged by the goddess of love, Venus, to beget a child, which is a theme in the sonnets. Here are the verses from &quot;Venus and Adonis&quot;:

A problem with identifying the fair youth with Southampton is that the most certainly datable events referred to in the Sonnets are the fall of Essex and then the gunpowder plotters&#x27; executions in 1606, which puts Southampton at the age of 33, and then 39 when the sonnets were published, when he would be past the age when he would be referred to as a &quot;lovely boy&quot; or &quot;fair youth&quot;.

Authors such as Thomas Tyrwhitt and Oscar Wilde proposed that the Fair Youth was William Hughes, a seductive young actor who played female roles in Shakespeare&#x27;s plays. Particularly, Wilde claimed that he was the Mr. W.H. referred to in the dedication attached to the manuscript of the Sonnets.

====The Dark Lady====

The Dark Lady sequence (sonnets 127–152) is the most defiant of the sonnet tradition. The sequence distinguishes itself from the Fair Youth sequence with its overt sexuality (Sonnet 151). The Dark Lady is so called because she has black hair and &quot;dun&quot; skin. The Dark Lady suddenly appears (Sonnet 127), and she and the speaker of the sonnets, the poet, are in a sexual relationship. She is not aristocratic, young, beautiful, intelligent or chaste. Her complexion is muddy, her breath &quot;reeks&quot;, and she is ungainly when she walks. The relationship strongly parallels Touchstone&#x27;s pursuit of Audrey in &quot;As You Like It&quot;. The Dark Lady presents an adequate receptor for male desire. She is celebrated in cocky terms that would be offensive to her, not that she would be able to read or understand what is said. Soon the speaker rebukes her for enslaving his fair friend (sonnet 133). He can&#x27;t abide the triangular relationship, and it ends with him rejecting her. As with the Fair Youth, there have been many attempts to identify her with a real historical individual. Lucy Negro, Mary Fitton, Emilia Lanier, Elizabeth Wriothesley, and others have been suggested.

====The Rival Poet====
The Rival Poet&#x27;s identity remains a mystery. If Shakespeare&#x27;s patron and friend was Pembroke, Shakespeare was not the only poet who praised his beauty; Francis Davison did in a sonnet that is the preface to Davison&#x27;s quarto &quot;A Poetical Rhapsody&quot; (1608), which was published just before &quot;Shakespeare&#x27;s Sonnets&quot;. John Davies of Hereford, Samuel Daniel, George Chapman, Christopher Marlowe, and Ben Jonson are also candidates that find support among clues in the sonnets.

It may be that the Rival Poet is a composite of several poets through which Shakespeare explores his sense of being threatened by competing poets. The speaker sees the Rival Poet as competition for fame and patronage. The sonnets most commonly identified as the Rival Poet group exist within the Fair Youth sequence in sonnets 78–86.

===&quot;A Lover&#x27;s Complaint&quot;===
&quot;A Lover&#x27;s Complaint&quot; is part two of the quarto published in 1609. It is not written in the sonnet form, but is composed of 47 seven-line stanzas written in rhyme royal. It is an example of a normal feature of the two-part poetic form, in which the first part expresses the male point of view, and the second part contrasts or complements the first part with the female&#x27;s point of view. The first part of the quarto, the 154 sonnets, considers frustrated male desire, and the second part, &quot;A Lover&#x27;s Complaint&quot;, expresses the misery of a woman victimized by male desire. The earliest Elizabethan example of this two-part structure is Samuel Daniel&#x27;s &quot;Delia ... with the Complaint of Rosamund&quot; (1592)—a sonnet sequence that tells the story of a woman being threatened by a man of higher rank, followed by the woman&#x27;s complaint. This was imitated by other poets, including Shakespeare with his &quot;Rape of Lucrece&quot;, the last lines of which contain Lucrece&#x27;s complaint. Other examples are found in the works of Michael Drayton, Thomas Lodge, Richard Barnfield, and others.

The young man of the sonnets and the young man of &quot;A Lover&#x27;s Complaint&quot; provide a thematic link between the two parts. In each part the young man is handsome, wealthy and promiscuous, unreliable and admired by all.

Like the sonnets, &quot;A Lover&#x27;s Complaint&quot; also has a possessive form in its title, which is followed by its own assertion of the author&#x27;s name. This time the possessive word, &quot;Lover&#x27;s&quot;, refers to a woman, who becomes the primary &quot;speaker&quot; of the work.

====Story of &quot;A Lover&#x27;s Complaint&quot;====
&quot;A Lover&#x27;s Complaint&quot; begins with a young woman weeping at the edge of a river, into which she throws torn-up letters, rings, and other tokens of love. An old man nearby approaches her and asks the reason for her sorrow. She responds by telling him of a former lover who pursued, seduced, and finally abandoned her. She recounts in detail the speech her lover gave to her which seduced her. She concludes her story by conceding that she would fall for the young man&#x27;s false charms again.

==Dates==
* 1597 – Shakespeare&#x27;s tragedy &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; is published. The spoken prologue to the play, and the prologue to Act II are both written in sonnet form, and the first meeting of the star-crossed lovers is written as a sonnet woven into the dialogue.
* 1598 – &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost&quot; is published as a quarto; the play&#x27;s title page suggests it is a revision of an earlier version. The comedy features the King of Navarre and his lords who express their love in sonnet form for the Queen of France and her ladies. This play is believed to have been performed at the Inns of Court for Queen Elizabeth I in the mid-1590s.
* 1598 – Francis Meres published his quarto &quot;Palladis Tamia&quot;, which was entered on the Stationers&#x27; Register on 7 September that year. In it he mentions that sonnets by Shakespeare were being circulated privately:
* 1599 – William Jaggard published an octavo volume called &quot;The Passionate Pilgrime. By W. Shakespeare.&quot; It is an anthology of 20 poems. This small publication contained some spurious content falsely ascribed to Shakespeare; it also contained four sonnets that can be said to be by Shakespeare: Two of the four appear to be early versions of sonnets that were later published in the 1609 quarto (numbers 138 and 144); the other two were sonnets lifted from Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost.&quot; Sonnets 138 and 144 are anything but the sweet sonnets hinted at by Francis Meres&#x27; comment. They are instead harshly frank, ironic and recriminative regarding the relationship of the speaker and the Dark Lady. The two sonnets that were taken from &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost,&quot; were, in the context of the play, written by comic characters who were intended to be seen as amateur sonneteers. Jaggard&#x27;s piracy sold well—a second printing was quickly ordered—but it, including poetry falsely ascribed to Shakespeare, must have been a disappointment to Shakespeare&#x27;s readers.
* January 1600 – an entry in the Stationers&#x27; Register is for a work that will include &quot;certain other sonnets by W.S.&quot; This may suggest that Shakespeare planned to respond right away and correct the impression left by Jaggard&#x27;s book with Shakespeare&#x27;s own publication, or the entry may have been merely a &quot;staying entry&quot; not regarding an upcoming publication, but intended to prevent Jaggard from publishing any more sonnets by Shakespeare.
* 14 August 1600 – Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;The Chronicle History of Henry the fifth&quot; is entered into the Register of the Stationers&#x27; Company. The spoken epilogue is written in the form of a sonnet.
* 20 May 1609 – The entry in the Stationers&#x27; Register announces &quot;Shakespeare&#x27;s Sonnets&quot;. The contents include a collection of 154 sonnets followed by the poem &quot;A Lover&#x27;s Complaint&quot;. This publication was greeted with near silence in the documentary record, especially when compared with the lively reception that followed the publication of &quot;Venus and Adonis&quot;.
* 1612 – Jaggard issues an expanded edition of his piratical anthology, &quot;The Passionate Pilgrim&quot;, which had been published in 1599. Thomas Heywood protests this piracy in his &quot;Apology for Actors&quot; (1612), writing that Shakespeare was &quot;much offended&quot; with Jaggard for making &quot;so bold with his name.&quot; Jaggard withdraws the attribution to Shakespeare from unsold copies of the 1612 edition.
* 1640 – The publisher John Benson publishes an anthology of poems; some are by Shakespeare, and about 30 are not, but all are ascribed to Shakespeare. It is titled &quot;Poems: Written by Wil. Shakespeare Gent&quot;. Benson is even more wildly piratical than Jaggard. Benson draws on &quot;The Passionate Pilgrim&quot; and other sources, including &quot;Shakespeare&#x27;s Sonnets&quot; (1609), which he rewrites and rearranges. Benson imperfectly rewrites the sonnets to make them appear to be addressing a woman—the pronoun &quot;he&quot; is often replaced by &quot;she&quot;. This edition is unfortunately influential and resulted in confusing and confounding various critical understanding and response for more than a century. Deliberate misgendering is also a feature of 17th-century commonplace books which include Sonnet 2, the most popular sonnet to appear in such collections. In Margaret Bellasys&#x27; commonplace book the poem appears with the non-gendered title, &#x27;Spes Altera&#x27;. In IA&#x27;s commonplace book, the gender of the addressee is explicitly changed with the title, &#x27;To one that would die a mayd&#x27;.
*1780 – Edmond Malone, in his two volume supplement to the 1778 Johnson-Stevens edition of the plays, finally instates the 1609 quarto edition of &quot;Shakespeare&#x27;s Sonnets&quot; as the sole authoritative text.
* 1986 – The New Penguin Shakespeare’s edition of the sonnets restores &quot;A Lover&#x27;s Complaint&quot; as an integral part of &quot;Shakespeare&#x27;s Sonnets.&quot;

==Criticism==

In his plays, Shakespeare himself seemed to be a satiric critic of sonnets—the allusions to them are often scornful. Then he went on to create one of the longest sonnet-sequences of his era, a sequence that took some sharp turns away from the tradition.

He may have been inspired out of literary ambition, and a desire to carve new paths apart from the well-worn tradition. Or he may have been inspired by biographical elements in his life. It is thought that the biographical aspects have been over-explored and over-speculated on, especially in the face of a paucity of evidence. The critical focus has turned instead (through New Criticism and by scholars such as Stephen Booth and Helen Vendler) to the text itself, which is studied and appreciated linguistically as a &quot;highly complex structure of language and ideas&quot;.

Besides the biographic and the linguistic approaches, another way of considering Shakespeare&#x27;s sonnets is in the context of the culture and literature that surrounds them.

Gerald Hammond, in his book &quot;The Reader and the Young Man Sonnets&quot;, suggests that the non-expert reader, who is thoughtful and engaged, does not need that much help in understanding the sonnets: though, he states, the reader may often feel mystified when trying to decide, for example, if a word or passage has a concrete meaning or an abstract meaning; laying that kind of perplexity in the reader&#x27;s path for the reader to deal with is an essential part of reading the sonnets—the reader doesn&#x27;t always benefit from having knots untangled and double-meanings simplified by the experts, according to Hammond.

During the eighteenth century, &quot;The Sonnets&quot;″ reputation in England was relatively low; in 1805, &quot;The Critical Review&quot; credited John Milton with the perfection of the English sonnet. Towards the end of the nineteenth century, Shakespeare and Milton seemed to be on an equal footing, but critics, burdened by an over-emphasis on biographical explorations, continued to contend with each other for decades on this point.

==Editions==
Like all Shakespeare&#x27;s works, &quot;Shakespeare&#x27;s Sonnets&quot; have been reprinted many times. Prominent editions include:
==Sonnets that occur in the plays==
There are sonnets written by Shakespeare that occur in his plays, and these include his earliest sonnets. They differ from the 154 sonnets published in the 1609, because they may lack the deep introspection, for example, and they are written to serve the needs of a performance, exposition or narrative.

===Early comedies===
In Shakespeare&#x27;s early comedies, the sonnets and sonnet-making of his characters are often objects of satire. In &quot;Two Gentlemen of Verona&quot;, sonnet-writing is portrayed cynically as a seduction technique. In &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost&quot;, sonnets are portrayed as evidence that love can render men weak and foolish. In &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot;, Beatrice and Benedick each write a sonnet, which serves as proof that they have fallen in love. In &quot;All’s Well that Ends Well&quot;, a partial sonnet is read, and Bertram comments, &quot;He shall be whipp&#x27;d through the army with this rhyme in&#x27;s forehead.&quot; In &quot;Henry V&quot;, the Dauphin suggests he will compose a sonnet to his horse.

The sonnets that Shakespeare satirizes in his plays are sonnets written in the tradition of Petrarch and Sidney, whereas Shakespeare&#x27;s sonnets published in the quarto of 1609 take a radical turn away from that older style, and have none of the lovelorn qualities that are mocked in the plays. The sonnets published in 1609 seem to be rebelling against the tradition.

In the play &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost&quot;, the King and his three lords have all vowed to live like monks, to study, to give up worldly things, and to see no women. All of them break the last part of the vow by falling in love. The lord Longaville expresses his love in a sonnet (&quot;Did not the heavenly rhetoric of thine eye…&quot;), and the lord Berowne does, too—a hexameter sonnet (&quot;If love make me forsworn, how shall I swear to love?&quot;)–a form Sidney uses in six of the sonnets in &quot;Astrophel and Stella&quot; (Numbers 1, 6, 8, 76, and 102). These sonnets contain comic imperfections, including awkward phrasing, and problems with the meter. After Berowne is caught breaking his vow, and exposed by the sonnet he composed, he passionately renounces speech that is affected, and vows to prefer plain country speech. Ironically, when proclaiming this he demonstrates that he can&#x27;t seem to avoid rich courtly language, and his speech happens to fall into the meter and rhyme of a sonnet. (&quot;O, never will I trust to speeches penned…&quot;)

===&quot;Henry V&quot;===
The epilogue at the end of the play &quot;Henry V&quot; is written in the form of a sonnet (&quot;Thus far with rough, and all-unable pen…&quot;). Formal epilogues were established as a theatrical tradition, and occur in 13 of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays. In &quot;Henry V&quot;, the character of Chorus, who has addressed the audience a few times during the play, speaks the wide-ranging epilogue/sonnet. It begins by allowing that the play may not have presented the story in its full glory. It points out that the next king would be Henry VI, who was an infant when he succeeded Henry V, and who &quot;lost France, and made his England bleed/ Which oft our stage hath shown.&quot; It refers to the three parts of &quot;Henry VI&quot; and to &quot;Richard III&quot; — connecting the Lancastrian and the Yorkist cycles.

===&quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;===
Three sonnets are found in &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;: The prologue to the play (&quot;Two households, both alike in dignity…&quot;), the prologue to the second act (&quot;Now old desire doth in his death-bed lie…&quot;), and set in the form of dialogue at the moment when Romeo and Juliet meet:

===&quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot;===
Two sonnets are mentioned in &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot;—sonnets by Beatrice and Benedick—and though not committed to paper, they were in Shakespeare&#x27;s mind. The first one, revealed by Claudio, is described as &quot;A halting sonnet of his own pure brain/Fashion&#x27;d to Beatrice&quot;. The second, found by Hero, was &quot;Writ in my cousin&#x27;s hand, stolen from her pocket/Containing her affection unto Benedick&quot;.

===&quot;Edward III&quot;===

The play &quot;Edward III&quot; has recently become accepted as part of Shakespeare&#x27;s canon of plays. It was considered an anonymous work, and that is how it was first published, but in the late 1990s it began to be included in publications of the complete works as co-authored by Shakespeare. Scholars who have supported this attribution include Jonathan Bate, Edward Capell, Eliot Slater, Eric Sams, Giorgio Melchiori, Brian Vickers, and others. The play, printed in 1596, contains language and themes that also appear in Shakespeare&#x27;s sonnets, including the line: &quot;Lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds&quot;, which occurs in sonnet 94 and the phrase &quot;scarlet ornaments&quot;, which occurs in sonnet 142. The scene of the play that contains those quotations is a comic scene that features a poet attempting to compose a love poem at the behest of his king, Edward III. At the time &quot;Edward III&quot; was published, Shakespeare&#x27;s sonnets were known by some, but they had not yet been published.

The king, Edward III, has fallen in love with the Countess of Salisbury, and he tells Lodowick, his secretary, to fetch ink and paper. Edward wants Lodowick&#x27;s help in composing a poem that will sing the praises of the countess. Lodowick has a question:

The king then expresses and dictates his passion in exuberant poetry, and asks Lodowick to read back to him what he has been able to write down. Lodowick reads:

When the countess enters, the poetry-writing scene is interrupted without Lodowick having accomplished much poetry—only two lines:

<text>The Grammy Award for Best Male R&amp;B Vocal Performance was awarded between 1968 and 2011. The award has had several minor name changes:

*In 1968 it was awarded as Best R&amp;B Solo Vocal Performance, Male
*From 1969 to 1994 it was awarded as Best R&amp;B Vocal Performance, Male
*Since 1995 it has been awarded as Best Male R&amp;B Vocal Performance

The award category was discontinued in 2012 as part of a major overhaul of the Grammy categories. It was merged with Best Female R&amp;B Vocal Performance and Best R&amp;B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals into a single category for [[Best R&amp;B Performance]].

Years reflect the year in which the Grammy Awards were presented, for works released in the previous year.

<text>The Red River Colony (or Selkirk Settlement), also known as Assiniboia, was a colonization project set up in 1811 by Thomas Douglas, 5th Earl of Selkirk, on of land in British North America. This land was granted to Douglas by the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company in the Selkirk Concession. It included portions of Rupert&#x27;s Land, or the watershed of Hudson Bay, bounded on the north by the line of 52° N latitude roughly from the Assiniboine River east to Lake Winnipegosis. It then formed a line of 52° 30′ N latitude from Lake Winnipegosis to Lake Winnipeg, and by the Winnipeg River, Lake of the Woods and Rainy River.

West of the Selkirk Concession, it is roughly formed by the current boundary between Saskatchewan and Manitoba. These covered portions consisted of present-day southern Manitoba, northern Minnesota, and eastern North Dakota, in addition to small parts of eastern Saskatchewan, northwestern Ontario, and northeastern South Dakota. The lands south of the 49th parallel north ceased to be a part of the Red River Colony following the signing of the Treaty of 1818, in which the United Kingdom agreed to cede this territory to the United States.

== History ==

=== Colony conception ===
Growing up in Scotland in the wake of the Jacobite rising of 1745, Lord Selkirk was constantly troubled by the plight of his Scottish kin. Selkirk was influenced by humanitarians including William Wilberforce and, following the forced displacement of Scottish farmers that took place during the Highland Clearances, decided that emigration was the only viable option to improve the livelihood of the Scottish people. Upon inheriting his father&#x27;s title in 1799, Selkirk focused the majority of his time and resources on establishing a Scottish colony in North America.

Selkirk became interested in the Red River region after reading Alexander MacKenzie&#x27;s Voyages in 1801; however, Selkirk was prevented from settling the region in 1802 when the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company raised concerns that the proposed colony would interfere with the running of the company. During the first decade of the nineteenth century Selkirk established two unsuccessful agricultural colonies in British North America but continued to pursue the settlement of the Red River region.

By 1807, Selkirk acknowledged that an alliance with either the Hudson&#x27;s Bay or North West Company, the dominant fur trading companies at the time, was essential to the establishment of a colony at Red River. By 1811, the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company had reconsidered Selkirk&#x27;s proposal and granted Selkirk , an area five times the size of Scotland, to establish an agricultural settlement in the region of Red River. Supplies of &quot;produce, such as flour, beef, pork and butter...&quot; would be affordable to manufacture in this colony, and would reduce the costly shipments from Britain.

The grant was also pending the annual provision of 200 men to the company and Selkirk&#x27;s assurance that the colony would remain out of the fur trade. Selkirk, who once mocked the fur trade for rarely grossing more than £200,000 and only having three ships employed in its service, gladly agreed to the terms. Selkirk referred to this new territory as the District of Assiniboia. At the time of the concession, Red River was the only Hudson Bay Colony that had been established within the company&#x27;s territory.

There is continuing debate as to whether Selkirk forced the concession of Assiniboia through a controlling interest of Hudson&#x27;s Bay stock. The argument against Selkirk claims that he received the concession by controlling the shares in the company. Historians seeking to defend this claim have argued that although Selkirk did buy a considerable number of Hudson&#x27;s Bay shares between 1811 and 1812, Selkirk received his initial grant in 1811.

=== Settling Red River ===

The early settlement of the Red River region was marked by a long series of crises and ecological disasters and within the first decade of settling the region it had already suffered renewed warfare, epidemics, prairie fires and a flood. Perhaps the most significant ecological disaster was the rapid depletion of the bison population. A vital food source, bison numbers had been dwindling since the 1760s due to heavy hunting pressure by Euroamerican traders as well as the aboriginal inhabitants of the prairies.

In July 1811, Miles Macdonell sailed from Yarmouth, England to the Hudson&#x27;s Bay post at York Factory with 36 primarily Irish and Scottish settlers. Due to persuasive efforts of the North West Company, only 18 settlers actually arrived at Red River in August 1812. As the planting season had ended before the settlers could complete the construction of Fort Douglas, they were forced to hunt bison for food and were completely unprepared for the arrival of 120 additional settlers in October. More settlers were scheduled to arrive in 1813, but due to a fever outbreak on their ship, they did not arrive until June 21, 1814. Dogged by poor harvests and a growing population, Macdonell, now governor of Red River, issued the Pemmican Proclamation in January 1814 to prevent the export of pemmican from the colony. In doing so, Macdonell undermined the security of Red River and plunged the colony into a conflict with the North West Company that would not end until 1821.

=== War between the companies ===
The Pemmican War that was initiated by Macdonell&#x27;s proclamation was only the tail end of a much larger conflict between the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company and its fur trade rivals, both English and French, in Montreal. The conflict dates back to King Charles II&#x27;s generous grant of Rupert&#x27;s Land to emigrants who were members of the nobility in 1670. Cause for conflict arose from the inability of either the Montreal traders or the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company to gain a monopoly over the North American fur trade. Between 1800 and 1821, the conflict between Hudson&#x27;s Bay and Montreal, at that point represented by the predominantly Scottish North West Company, intensified.
The conflict reached its peak in 1801 and witnessed both companies expending more resources on out-competing each other than were expended on the exploration of new fur grounds. Between 1803 and 1804, Hudson&#x27;s Bay morale had plummeted in the face of fierce Northwest competition and forced the two companies into negotiations but neither side could come to terms. Negotiations broke down again in 1805 and despite employing more aggressive agents and the provision of incentive programs, the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company was ready to abandon the fur trade in 1809. The Nor&#x27;Westers ability to make region-wide plans based on first-hand knowledge in addition to their ability to react quickly to changing circumstances provided the North West Company with a decisive advantage prior to 1810. After 1810, the combination of new management within the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company and the approval of a company-sponsored colony at Red River put the North West Company on the defensive. The establishment of a Hudson&#x27;s Bay colony in the Red River region denied the Nor&#x27;Westers access to vital supplies and restricted the company&#x27;s ability to expand westwards. Additionally, the establishment of an agricultural colony made the Hudson&#x27;s Bay company nondependent on the profitable fur trade, a factor that the Nor&#x27;Westers simply could not compete with. Moreover, by establishing an agricultural colony, the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company gained a decisive advantage over the North West Company by virtue of a viable fallback economy as well as a readily available food source during economic slumps. Much of this new-found confidence hinged on the Selkirk&#x27;s success at Red River and resulted in the colony becoming the central focus of seven years of inter-company warfare.

Red River first came under attack from the North West Company in the summer of 1815. Convinced that Macdonell&#x27;s proclamation was a deliberate attempt to block Northwest trade, the company destroyed Fort Douglas and burned down all of the surrounding buildings. The fort was later rebuilt but the engagement resulted in the capture of approximately 150 settlers including Macdonell. He was replaced by Robert Semple who took over as governor the following winter and reinforced the colony&#x27;s 45 survivors with 84 additional settlers. In 1815, the North West Company once again entered into negotiations with the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company under the threat of invasion of Northwest territory. Negotiations were headed by Selkirk himself and he promptly threw out all of the Nor&#x27;Wester proposals. The following year Semple and twenty other settlers were killed in the Battle of Seven Oaks and the settlement was abandoned once again. The imminent arrival of Selkirk in 1817, who had been en route to the colony prior to the incident at Seven Oaks, prompted the settlers to return to the colony shortly after. Travelling with a force of approximately 100 soldiers from the recently disbanded Swiss and German Regiment de Meuron and De Watteville&#x27;s Regiment, Selkirk captured Fort William, the North West Company headquarters, and captured several key agents including William McGillivray, Kenneth McKenzie and John McLoughlin. Although the arrival and subsequent settlement of Selkirk&#x27;s private army finally broke the back of the North West Company, Selkirk spent much of his remaining years, and the majority of his fortune, defending his actions at Fort William. When Selkirk arrived at Red River in 1817, the stability of the colony dramatically improved, especially after the removal of all Indigenous claims to the land. Selkirk achieved this by signing a treaty between the Red River colonists and the local Cree, Assiniboine and Ojibwa. Between 1817 and 1820, Selkirk committed all of his available resources to the betterment of his colonial venture and ironically it was Selkirk&#x27;s death in the spring of 1820 that ultimately ended Northwest aggression against his beloved colony.

The lands south of the 49th parallel north ceased to be a part of the Red River Colony following the signing of the Treaty of 1818, in which the United Kingdom agreed to cede this territory to the United States. It was later discovered that the Northwest Angle had also been ceded.

=== Rising colony ===
The rivalling Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company and North West Company were forced to merge in 1821 by the British government, and from then until 1870 the area was under the jurisdiction of the Assinboia Council, an appointed body with representatives of various sections of Red River society (francophone and anglophone, Roman Catholic and Protestant officials, Métis, Scottish, Irish, French-Canadian, etc.), all sharing a common past or present involvement with the Companies. While the end of the fur trade&#x27;s inspired conflicts on the plains, the Red River settlement was able to grow in both population and economic importance with the expansion of commercially oriented agriculture (raising of staple crops). The agricultural products, primarily wheat, began to rise in yearly yields. Flour production rose from over annually from 1823 to 1829 to over in the early 1830s. The supply of flour reached over by the mid-1830s, rapidly deflating the price the HBC paid the farmers for the product. Numbering over 1,000 by 1827, the farmers began to complain about the deflating rates they received and lack of markets for their goods.

In 1841, James Sinclair guided 200 settlers from the Red River Colony west in an attempt to retain the Columbia District for British North America. The party crossed the Rockies into the Columbia Valley, near present-day Radium Hot Springs, British Columbia; then travelled south. Despite such efforts, the British government eventually ceded all claim to land south of the 49th parallel of latitude west of the Rockies to the United States as a resolution to the Oregon boundary dispute.

=== Red River Rebellion ===
==== American annexation plans ====
American expansionists became heavily interested in the economic potential the territory of the Red River Colony possessed. The ideal soil, climate and socio-economic potential of the area convinced many Americans that they needed to make the territory part of the United States. The result ended up being an annexation proposal of Red River in 1870, in order to convert it into land that American settlers could use for economic purposes. Due to the outbreak of the Red River Rebellion, the American annexationists hoped to take advantage of the disruption caused by these political conflicts and present themselves in the forefront as the ideal leaders of the Red River land. The annexation was led by Minnesota senator Alexander Ramsey, and was backed by Zachariah Chandler and Jacob M. Howard- who were both senators of Michigan and represented Detroit merchants. They all shared the same economic vision for the annexation: Ramsey believed that the Red River valley would serve as an important commercial adjunct for his state, while Chandler and Howard believed that annexing the Red River would benefit their Great Lakes Trade. This was done under the belief it would help them in their attempts to colonize the region, as it prevented the Canadian government from establishing sovereignty over the area. A notable example would be James W. Taylor: he was an American special agent and Winnipeg consul who used his political power to shape the destiny of the valley, which called for the removal of all English-Canadian influence. 
The Canadian government, however, did not allow these attempts at U.S. expansionism to succeed.

The proposal was met with a significant amount of resistance from the inhabitants of the Red River as they were given the chance to address their grievances about the potential loss of land and becoming part of an American colonization project through a proclamation by the Governor-General of the dominion. Americans who supported annexation by the U.S. government tried to depict themselves as favorable figures in the eyes of the Métis by associating themselves with Louis Riel. The Rebellion was an unarmed conflict started by the Métis because Canada was attempting to claim possession of Rupert&#x27;s Land without any concern for the grievances of the Métis. However, the main American intention behind their decision to support Riel and the Rebellion was an attempt to sway the Métis in favour of the annexation by the US. One of their tools was the New Nation newspaper which elicited rhetoric that advocated annexation by the US because it embodied the popular Manifest Destiny ideology. This was meant to help the cause of annexation, the idea being that their support of the Red River Rebellion would encourage local resistance against the Canadian government, and help swing local opinion in favour of independence – then ultimately America would step in to offer the protection of the United States government to the Red River Métis and assert themselves as the new leaders and Red River would become American land. They ultimately wanted to create a situation where the Red River could become American territory by allying with the discontented Métis Nation.

However, this aggressive propaganda ultimately backfired upon the proposal of annexation. It created even more hostility towards the annexation party and the United States. This great emphasis on materialism never seemed appealing to the Red River people. The Americans became too acquisitive because they were eager to create a political union. This ultimately caused the annexation of the North West to fail, despite it being almost within reach. All this ultimately benefited the cause of Riel and the Rebellion. As a result, the Metis were able to successfully defy Canadian expansion into Rupert&#x27;s Land.

==== Legislative Assembly of Assiniboia, Louis Riel, and the Manitoba Act ====
This political chaos, in a sense, became pivotal for Red River because it allowed for the success of the Métis in their rebellion. In 1870, the elected Legislative Assembly of Assinboia was created by Red River inhabitants to take the place of the unelected Assiniboia Council. The Canadian government was forced to develop the negotiations that allowed for the Métis demands that were legally entrenched in the Manitoba Act which eventually led to the creation of the province of Manitoba. The political disputes put the Métis on a platform to voice their disapproval of Americans ignoring their concerns over these land disputes. They had legitimate claims to the land and they stated that they were the &quot;descendants of the lords of the soil.&quot;. Also, under Louis Riel&#x27;s leadership, the Metis rebels were able to capture Fort Garry – a fortified post of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company. This would lead Riel into becoming the leader of the provisional government, and he composed and sent a list of rights to Ottawa. The demands mainly consisted of the Métis wanting Red River to be entered into Canadian confederation as a province, security for their land claims, making English and French the official languages of the colony, as well as financial support for the Red River population. Riel hoped to accomplish a sense of equality for the Métis; he wanted to present them as a civilized people that were deserving of the same rights of any British subject. The rebellion became a pivotal moment in acquiring land rights and a political voice for the Métis, who were constantly disregarded for their Aboriginal status.

The aftermath of the rebellion caused the Métis to no longer be considered as Canadian Aboriginals – they became regarded as their own social group, and were distinct from other Aboriginal groups. In order to pacify the Métis resistance further, the Canadian government gave them generous land grants in 1869–70 that were carefully structured to be given in severalty, rather than in common. Red River was now developing its own provincial government that had a political voice and political implications upon Canadian federal government. This rebellion also led to the Métis emerging as a unique, acknowledged group within Canada, and ultimately, the disappearance of the Aboriginal rights paradigm in the public view of Red River. The rebellion was successful in a sense that it allowed the Métis to have a political voice, but it impacted the perception of how other Aboriginals would be viewed in Red River.

Once the rebellion ended, Riel and several of his comrades fled to the United States in 1870 upon being informed that several government soldiers and irregulars were looking to kill him to exact revenge for several incidents, in particular, the execution of Thomas Scott. Riel, however later returned to Canada in 1885 to help lead the North West rebellion. This caused him to face trial in a Canadian court, and eventually to being executed by the Canadian government in Regina. His death provoked outcry among the French Canadian, First Nations and Métis communities, with particular uproar in Québec in reaction to the execution of a French-speaking, Catholic political leader, and Riel&#x27;s death was seen on all sides (among those who saw Riel as a traitor who was rightly punished and those outraged at his arrest and execution) as symbolic of the danger that could result from contesting Canadian government policy. Riel would subsequently be claimed as a hero and martyr by the French-Canadian, Métis, and various First Nations for decades. The Canadian government was starting to punish the rebels for their defiance, but the rebellion is still considered a success in the sense that the Metis were still able to acquire the land rights they hoped to achieve, as well as no longer being ignored when it came to federal matters.

=== Development of Manitoba ===

The Red River rebellion needed to be finally be put to rest. In order to accomplish this, the Canadian government, which was predominantly led by English-Canadian conservatives, initiated the &quot;Manitoba Act&quot; in 1870. They believed that this act would accomplish two purposes: this would be able to crush the rebellion, while at the same time, appeasing the French demands of increasing French influence in Canada because the act would create a Western province that was constitutionally supportive of French Canadian language and culture. This was the first steps towards the creation of the present-day province of Manitoba. The act was given royal assent on May 12, 1870, and the commencement of Manitoba with a provincial status came to fruition on July 15, 1870. After the passage of the &quot;Manitoba Act&quot;, the Métis Provisional government was disbanded. There was an assimilation of the Métis people and the European settlers, and the Aboriginal influence was further distanced from Red River.

Through the act, the Red River colony was now christened as Manitoba: a new Canadian province that was self-governed, and that had its own rights and responsibilities. It was no longer being viewed as a territory and was now officially part of the Canadian confederation. Provincial status was accelerated by Louis Riel&#x27;s rebellion. Riel wanted to secure Red River for the Canadians against the Americans&#x27; colonization projects and sentiments of their Manifest Destiny ideologies. The early Manitoba provincial government initially struggled to be effective. Everything around it felt rushed because the &quot;Manitoba Act&quot; was mostly created to prevent another Red River Rebellion. Many of the government officials were inexperienced – especially the three delegates who went to Ottawa to negotiate union terms. None of them had experience with diplomacy or the creation of new governments. Due to the hurried nature of the creation of this province, the officials of this new government presented themselves as overwhelmed and unprepared, and this shows that Manitoba was essentially created to re-stabilize political unrest within Canada.

Many in French Canada had seen the establishment of Manitoba, officially bilingual and with a large francophone and Catholic population, as a counter-balance to English and Protestant dominance in the Canadian Confederation, while some hoped the province would be a political entity centered or at least heavily influenced by indigenous or Métis communities. Once the rebellion was put down and Manitoba was admitted, thousands of largely Protestant, anglophone Ontarians quickly began migrating to the prairies, and their presence swiftly shifted the demographic, national, and linguistic profile of the province, which in turn meant the election of provincial governments decisively oriented towards Ontario and English Canada, rather than French Canada, Métis, First Nations, or balance between these groups. The Manitoba government also sought to encourage immigration and the immediate establishment and expansion of stable agricultural communities, and within a two decades many thousands of international migrants, largely ethnic Ukrainians and Germans, had come to the province as agricultural settlers. The Catholic Church also continued to encouraged migration and settlement from Quebec and francophone Ontario to Manitoba, however these settlers were far outnumbered by English settlers as well international migrants whose communities would be assimilated in Anglo-Canadian society.

In the province&#x27;s first few decades of existence (1870–1900), Manitoba experienced conflicting interests between French and English Canadians. A quarter-century after the implementation of the &quot;Manitoba Act&quot; which legally guaranteed a place for the French language in the province&#x27;s administration, lawmaking, and judiciary along with a clause ensuring state funding for both Catholic (often de facto French) and Protestant schools, English had become the sole means of communication in the legislature and the judiciary, while the provincial government attempted the introduction of a secular, English-only public school system which would be the sole recipient of any public funding. The policy was eventually implemented with minor concessions such as the teaching of Catholic doctrine at the end of the day where the number of students warranted, and the role of French in these new public schools was to be highly limited, mainly to use as means of instructing young students who started school not speaking English.

== Women in the colony ==
The position of many women in the Red River Colony was determined within the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company&#x27;s 1670 Charter; this document gave legislative and judicial powers in Rupert&#x27;s Land to the company. It is stated within the Charter that the legal status of women is as dependents of a male authority, which included fathers, husbands or brothers.

In an extremely rare example of a woman successfully challenging this status-quo, Maria Thomas, a 16-year-old Métis domestic servant, took her employer, Rev. Owen Corbett, to court for repeatedly raping her and subjecting her to illegal abortions. Thomas, in her testimony, used the laws in place to challenge Corbett&#x27;s actions; citing British law against forcing individuals to undergo abortions, which were illegal. She won the case; however, Corbett was freed from jail shortly after by a group of settlers who were opposed to the trial. The courts did not challenge this, fearing a possible insurrection, demonstrating the weakness of the colonial authorities in the nascent colony.

In the establishing years of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company and the North West Company, male settlers frequently took a First Nations or Metis spouse. Though only encouraged by the NWC for trade relations, it was a common practice among European employees of both companies due to the various policies by the companies which only allowed males to emigrate to fur trading outposts. When female settlers did eventually start emigrating to the settlement, tensions between the European and indigenous communities were heightened due to the highly restrictive gender norms these women brought with them from Europe. In part a reflection of their conservative morals, many settlers in the colony also claimed to observe differences between European and indigenous women; Alexander Ross, a Scottish author who lived in the Red River Colony for a number of years, stated in a book written by him on the colony&#x27;s history that a friend informed him that European women were required to be &quot;graceful&quot; unlike indigenous women, who were exempt from this due to their bashfulness.

== Métis people of the Red River Colony ==
The mixed ethnicity of indigenous and European peoples at the Red River Colony, known as Metis, were not always referred to by that name in the beginning years of their existence. Augustus Chetlain, an author who lived in the colony, wrote in his book that they were often called &quot;Brules, Metifs, or half-breeds, the bastard sons of Indian concubines&quot;.

The culture and lifestyle of the Metis community living in Red River were not only present at the colony. Metis people had a long-lasting tradition of a semi-annual, commercial, buffalo hunt that took place throughout the prairies starting in the mid-1700s with the western fur trade. The Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company&#x27;s journals and a number of witnesses to these events stated that the united caravan was commonly known as a brigade. These brigades did not just focus on buffalo hunting but were used by buffalo hunters to trade and freight during this time. Women were fundamental in both actively participating in the brigade hunts or trade, as well as the bringing together of people prior to the excursion. By studying the social network of the Trottier Brigade, a community of people from the White Horse Plains in Red River, it is notable that biologically related women brought the majority of the men together.

Throughout the time that Metis people were a part of the Red River community they developed into several different identities, rather than just the common depiction of the bison-hunting French Catholic Metis. Metis identity, at that time as it is today, was diverse and complex due to the different livelihoods and practices followed. Metis who chose not to live on prairies and hunt buffalo for the winter remained on lakes such as Manitoba, Winnipegosis, and Winnipeg to ice fish. Over the course of the first half of the 19th century, up to forty households had developed on the lakeshore of Lake Manitoba. Fishing and trading had become year round practices and the Metis families involved would trade with HBC and ‘Freemen’- traders that did not work at the post.

Christianity played a vital role in shaping the community within the colony, especially for the Metis people. In the early 19th century, considerations were made by the Committee in London to open schools run by the Clergymen to benefit, in their opinion, from instruction in religion and civilization. Although these schools took in all children of the colony, mixed-ancestry children were a large focus due to them being tied to the fur trading post by their European fathers. John Halkett, a Committee member, wanted Metis families of retired HBC employees to be brought to Red River (from other nearby posts) to be put under the authority of the Roman Catholic Mission or Church Missionary Society. This plan was largely related to keeping retired Metis employees from continuing trade with the Indigenous peoples; however, its effect led to Christianity being a prominent part of culture for the Metis community. The Chaplain of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, John West, was also interested in the religious educating of Metis children. According to his book, he wrote to the Governor submitting a plan to gather up a number of children to care for and educate. He stated that he created this plan when he saw these children being raised in a way he deemed ignorant and idle.

The above-mentioned differences in religion, ways of life, and ethnic origins largely followed a pattern based on the initial contact between individuals, groups, and institutions. For example, large communities within the Cree nation are thought to have come into contact with French and later French-Canadian traders bringing Catholic priests and missionaries in their wake, later Scottish traders and the Company brought Protestant missionaries and clergy into Ojibwe-dominated areas. This division into a Cree-French-Catholic oriented group and an Ojibwe-Scottish-Protestant oriented group can be seen in the rise of the two main Métis languages: Mitchif, a French and Cree-based mixed-language whose speakers were largely Catholic, and Bungi, a form of speech that developed from Ojibwe, Scots, English, Gaelic, and Cree and was mostly spoken by Protestants (Anglican, Presbyterian).

== Church Missionary Society ==
The Church Missionary Society (CMS) provided financial assistance in 1820 to Reverend John West, chaplain to the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, towards the education of some First Nations children, including James Settee and Henry Budd of the Cree nation, both of whom were later ordained as priests. In 1822, the CMS appointed Revd West to head the mission in the Red River Colony. He was succeeded in 1823 by the Revd David Jones who was joined by the Revd W and Mrs Cockran in 1825. The mission expanded and by 1850, the missionaries were active throughout the colony and were travelling to Fort Simpson on the Mackenzie River.

<text>Hydrocephalus is a condition in which cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) builds up within the brain, which can cause pressure to increase in the skull. Symptoms may vary according to age. Headaches and double vision are common. Elderly adults with normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) may have poor balance, difficulty controlling urination, or mental impairment. In babies, there may be a rapid increase in head size. Other symptoms may include vomiting, sleepiness, seizures, and downward pointing of the eyes.
Hydrocephalus can occur due to birth defects (primary) or can develop later in life (secondary). Hydrocephalus can be classified via mechanism into communicating, noncommunicating, &quot;ex vacuo&quot;, and normal pressure hydrocephalus. Diagnosis is made by physical examination and medical imaging, such as a CT scan.
Hydrocephalus is typically treated through surgery. One option is the placement of a shunt system. A procedure called an endoscopic third ventriculostomy has gained popularity in recent decades, and is an option in certain populations. Outcomes are variable, but many people with shunts live normal lives. However, there are many potential complications, including infection or breakage. There is a high risk of shunt failure in children especially. However, without treatment, permanent disability or death may occur.
Hydrocephalus affects about 0.1-0.6% of newborns. Rates in the developing world may be higher. Normal pressure hydrocephalus affects about 6% of patients over 80. Description of hydrocephalus by Hippocrates dates back more than 2,000 years. The word &quot;hydrocephalus&quot; is from the Greek , meaning &#x27;water&#x27; and , meaning &#x27;head&#x27;.

==Signs and symptoms==
The clinical presentation of hydrocephalus varies with age as well as chronicity.

Infants:

Hydrocephalus is difficult to detect clinically before delivery, although enlarged ventricles can be spotted on ultrasonography as early as 18–20 weeks gestation. Since infants&#x27; skulls are not fully fused together at the cranial sutures yet, they have soft spots on their skulls known as open fontanelles. This anatomic characteristic means that infants&#x27; skulls can visibly grow in size when cerebrospinal fluid accumulates. Therefore, infants with hydrocephalus may present with an enlarged skull (or rapid growth in skull size), bulging fontanelles, or separated cranial sutures. Parents or physicians may also note that the infant is more irritable or tired than normal. Other symptoms include seizures, inability to look upwards (&quot;sunset eyes&quot; or &quot;setting sun&quot; sign), and pauses in breathing. Infants may also present with lack of weight gain or failure to meet motor and developmental milestones. Imaging can be done to confirm the suspected diagnosis of hydrocephalus. In infants, the open fontanelles allow for use of head ultrasonography. This allows pediatricians to minimize radiation exposure and come up with a diagnosis quickly. If further information is needed, an MRI can be done.

Of note, hydrocephalus in infants can occur as part of a syndrome, and therefore patients may present with other characteristic symptoms. An example of one such syndrome is the Walker-Warburg syndrome, in which patients may also have holoprosencephaly and several other cranial defects. The VACTERL disorders (vertebral anomalies, anal atresia, cardiac defects, tracheoesophageal fistula, renal and radial anomalies, and limb defects) may also include hydrocephalus, and can then be called VACTERL-H. Hydrocephalus can also occur as part of neurocutaneous disorders such as neurofibromatosis type I (NF I) and tuberous sclerosis. Lastly, patients with trisomy disorders (trisomy 9,19p, 13, 18, and 21) as well as triploidy have been noted to have hydrocephalus.Children:

In older children, the fontanelles are closed, so there is no visible change in head size. Since there is limited expansion of the skull, symptoms are more representative of the effects of increased intracranial pressure on a child&#x27;s developing brain. The most common presenting features in this age group are memory and concentration issues as well as motor and gait abnormalities. Nausea, vomiting, and a tremor of the arms and legs are also common features in older children. Patients may also have papilledema (swelling of the optic disc), worsening vision, and difficulty looking upwards on examination. A key feature in this age group includes headaches, due to the intracranial hypertension caused by the increased CSF in the closed space of the skull. These headaches tend to occur early in the morning as patients have been in a horizontal position throughout the night, which increases ICP.

Symptoms that may occur in older children can include:
* Brief, shrill, high-pitched cry
* Changes in personality, memory, or the ability to reason or think
* Changes in facial appearance and eye spacing (craniofacial disproportion)
* Crossed eyes or uncontrolled eye movements
* Difficulty feeding
* Excessive sleepiness
* Headaches
* Irritability, poor temper control
* Loss of bladder control (urinary incontinence)
* Loss of coordination and trouble walking
* Muscle spasticity (spasm)
* Slow growth (child 0–5 years)
* Delayed milestones
* Failure to thrive
* Slow or restricted movement
* Vomiting
Since increased intracranial pressure can damage the brain, thought and behavior may be negatively affected. Learning disabilities, including short-term memory loss, are common among those with hydrocephalus. Affected children tend to score better on verbal IQ than on performance IQ, a pattern which is thought to reflect the distribution of nerve damage to the brain. Hydrocephalus that is present from a young age can cause long-term problems with speech and language. Children can have trouble understanding complex and abstract concepts or difficulty retrieving stored information. They may also have a nonverbal learning disorder or spatial/perceptual disorders. Children affected by hydrocephalus may also have difficulty in understanding concepts within conversation. This is thought to be due to an inability to understand or interpret context. These children may tend to use words they know or have heard. However, the severity of hydrocephalus can differ considerably between individuals, and some are of average or above-average intelligence. Aside from learning disabilities, a child with hydrocephalus may also have coordination and visual problems. They may reach puberty earlier than the average child (this is called precocious puberty). About one in four develops epilepsy.

Adults:

In adults, acute hydrocephalus can have many of the same signs and symptoms (headaches, vomiting,nausea, papilledema, sleepiness, or coma) of increased intracranial pressure (ICP) that are seen in children. Increased volumes of CSF can also result in hearing loss, including sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). Hearing loss is a rare but well-known sequela of procedures resulting in CSF loss. Elevated ICP can also cause a portion of the brain to move out of place (uncal or tonsillar herniation), which can result in brain stem compression and possibly death.

By contrast, chronic dilatation (especially in the elderly population) may present in a more insidious manner. Hakim&#x27;s triad of gait instability, urinary incontinence, and dementia is a relatively typical manifestation of a form of hydrocephalus known as normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH). Focal neurological deficits may also occur, such as abducens nerve palsy and vertical gaze palsy (Parinaud syndrome due to compression of the quadrigeminal plate, where the neural centers coordinating the conjugated vertical eye movement are located). The symptoms depend on the cause of the blockage, the person&#x27;s age, and how much brain tissue has been damaged by the swelling.

Hydrocephalus ex vacuo is a condition in which there is ventriculomegaly due to loss of brain volume which then results in a subsequent increase in CSF. This is most commonly seen in patients with neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer&#x27;s disease (due to hippocampal atrophy specifically). Therefore, the presenting symptoms of this condition will likely be those of Alzheimer&#x27;s: memory loss, loss of language skills or comprehension (aphasia), inability to perform purposeful movements (apraxia), and inability to conduct activities of daily living independently. Hydrocephalus ex vacuo can also occur due to traumatic brain injuries or due to strokes.

==Causes==
Hydrocephalus can be caused by a combination of factors and is not fully understood. Any medical condition that interrupts the flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) can cause this build-up of excess fluid. This occurs due to blocked pathways of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), issues with CSF reabsorption, or increased CSF production.

Hydrocephalus can be classified as primary or secondary (acquired) based on the cause.

===Primary===
Primary hydrocephalus involves congenital, developmental, and genetic factors that lead to excess CSF build-up. Up to 50% of the causes of primary hydrocephalus are genetic.

Congenital hydrocephalus is defined by the presence of excess CSF at birth. It occurs due to a combination of factors, especially genetic causes prior to birth (meaning the fetus may develop hydrocephalus &quot;in utero&quot; during fetal development). The genes involved in congenital hydrocephalus involve aqueduct defects, development of the central nervous system, and cilia (involved in the movement and flow of CSF). The most common cause of congenital hydrocephalus is aqueductal stenosis, which occurs when the narrow passage between the third and fourth ventricles in the brain is blocked or too narrow to allow sufficient cerebral spinal fluid to drain. Fluid accumulates in the upper ventricles, causing build up and hydrocephalus.

Developmental disorders including neural-tube defects, arachnoid cysts, Dandy–Walker malformations, and Arnold–Chiari malformations can cause primary hydrocephalus. Dandy-walker malformations and Arnold-Chiari malformations lead to structural abnormalities in the brain, which disrupts the flow of CSF and causes hydrocephalus.

Neural tube defects are commonly caused by a deficiency of folic acid during pregnancy. Spina bifida is a neural tube defect that involves defects in the development of the spine, and it can cause hydrocephalus. Myelomeningocele is the most severe type of spina bifida, involving an open spinal column and the exact mechanism of hydrocephalus involved in this condition is unclear.

===Secondary (Acquired)===
Secondary hydrocephalus is acquired as a consequence of CNS infections, meningitis, brain tumors, head trauma, toxoplasmosis, or intracranial hemorrhage (subarachnoid or intraparenchymal).

Intraventricular hemorrhage, or bleeding within the ventricles of the brain, leads to hydrocephalus in 51-89% of patients. This is because the blood in the ventricles blocks the regular flow of CSF, leading to build-up of excess CSFNormal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) most often occurs in elderly patients with symptoms including gait disturbance, urinary incontinence, and cognitive issues. It is commonly divided into two categories, idiopathic NPH (with unknown cause) and secondary NPH (due to trauma, hemorrhage, etc.).

Hydrocephalus can also be caused by overproduction of CSF (relative obstruction) (e.g., choroid plexus papilloma, villous hypertrophy).

Brain atrophy or breakdown in elderly patients or patients with conditions like Parkinson&#x27;s or Alzheimer&#x27;s can lead to acquired hydrocephalus. This is likely because the breakdown of brain cells leads to ventriculomegaly (enlargement of ventricles) and increased space for CSF to fill.

==Mechanism==

Hydrocephalus is due to an imbalance between the amount of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) produced and the amount reabsorbed (or removed from the ventricular system). The purpose of cerebrospinal fluid is to provide mechanical support, nutrients, and remove waste from the central nervous system. In a person without hydrocephalus, CSF continuously circulates through the brain, its ventricles and the spinal cord and is continuously drained away into the circulatory system. Alternatively, the condition may result from an overproduction of the CSF, from a congenital malformation blocking normal drainage of the fluid, or from complications of head injuries or infections.

The choroid plexus, located in the lateral ventricles, forms the majority of CSF (believed to be around 70-80%). The ependymal lining of the ventricular system, the subarachnoid space, and the blood-brain-barrier forms the rest.

CSF flows through the ventricular system through the following pathway:

Lateral Ventricles → Interventricular Foramen of Monro → Third Ventricle → Cerebral Aqueduct → Fourth Ventricle

The CSF then exits the fourth ventricle through the median aperture and lateral aperture. It goes into the subarachnoid space or central canal of the spinal cord. Then, it is absorbed by the vili of arachnoid granulations into the blood circulation.

There have also been recent theories and studies exploring the drainage of CSF. One theory involves the drainage of CSF into the lymphatic vessel system. The lymphatic vessel system clears proteins and fluid throughout the body, but whether they are involved in CSF drainage within the brain is controversial and not yet clear. Lymphatic vessels in the dura mater is a possible site of CSF drainage.

Cilia plays a role in the flow of CSF. Cilia are long microtubules on the cell membranes of many cells, including ependymal cells (which line the ventricular system). Some genetic causes of congenital hydrocephalus have been linked to issues with cilia.

=== Mechanism of Symptoms ===
When the cerebrospinal fluid builds up, it causes compression of the brain, which leads to the symptoms of convulsions, intellectual disability, and epileptic seizures. These signs occur sooner in adults because their skulls are no longer able to expand to based on the increasing fluid volume. Fetuses, infants, and young children with hydrocephalus have head enlargement, excluding the face, because the pressure of the fluid causes the individual skull bones—which have yet to fuse—to bulge outward at their juncture points.

A rare complication of hydrocephalus is hearing loss. There are a few possible mechanisms involved in hearing loss in hydrocephalus. The cochlear aqueduct connects the perilymphatic space of the inner ear with the subarachnoid space of the posterior cranial fossa. Because of the delicate relationship between pressure and hearing, hearing loss may also be caused after a shunt is placed to treat hydrocephalus.

CSF can accumulate within the ventricles, this condition is called internal hydrocephalus and may result in increased CSF pressure. The production of CSF continues, even when the passages that normally allow it to exit the brain are blocked. Consequently, fluid builds inside the brain, causing pressure that dilates the ventricles and compresses the nervous tissue. Compression of the nervous tissue usually results in irreversible brain damage. If the skull bones are not completely ossified when the hydrocephalus occurs, the pressure may also severely enlarge the head. The cerebral aqueduct may be blocked at the time of birth or may become blocked later in life because of a tumor growing in the brainstem.

==Classification==
The classification of communicating vs. noncommunicating hydrocephalus are often used to describe the types of hydrocephalus. These terms describe the nonobstructive vs. obstructive mechanisms of the excess CSF build-up.

===Communicating===
In communicating hydrocephalus, there is no obstruction of CSF flow. Instead, there is either an increased production of CSF or difficulty reabsorbing CSF. Reabsorption occurs at the arachnoid granulations, so issues with reabsorption can occur because of arachnoid granulation impairment. There is also evidence of the lymphatic system being involved with reabsorption, so impairments of this system can also lead to excess CSF. Damage to these reabsorption sites are commonly post-hemorrhage or post-infection (such as meningitis). Scarring and fibrosis of the subarachnoid space following infectious, inflammatory, or hemorrhagic events can also prevent reabsorption of CSF, causing hydrocephalus.

Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) is a form of chronic communicating hydrocephalus, with enlarged cerebral ventricles and intermittently increased cerebrospinal fluid pressure. The symptoms include dementia, gait changes, and urinary incontinence. It is diagnosed with continuous intraventricular pressure recordings (over 24 hours or even longer) because instant measurements can show normal pressure values. Dynamic compliance studies may be also helpful. Altered compliance () of the ventricular walls, as well as increased viscosity of the cerebrospinal fluid, may play a role in the pathogenesis.
===Noncommunicating===
In noncommunicating hydrocephalus, there is obstruction to the CSF flow. Examples of common causes include hemorrhage, tumor, traumatic brain injury that disrupt the flow, leading to build-up of CSF in the brain.

==Treatments==
===Procedures===
Hydrocephalus is treated through surgery by creating a way for the excess fluid to drain away. An external ventricular drain (EVD), also known as an extraventricular drain or ventriculostomy, provides relief in the short term. In the long term, some people will need any of the various types of cerebral shunts. It involves the placement of a ventricular catheter (a tube made of silastic) into the cerebral ventricles. This creates a way to bypass the flow obstruction/malfunctioning arachnoidal granulations. The excess fluid drains into other body cavities where it can be resorbed. Most shunts drain the fluid into the peritoneal cavity (ventriculoperitoneal shunt). Other shunts drain the fluid into the right atrium (ventriculoatrial shunt), pleural cavity (ventriculopleural shunt), and gallbladder.

A shunt system can also be placed in the lumbar space of the spine. This allows the excess fluid to be redirected to the peritoneal cavity (lumbar-peritoneal shunt). Another treatment for obstructive hydrocephalus is an endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV). This surgery creates an opening in the floor of the third ventricle so that CSF flows directly to the basal cisterns. This treatment can shortcut any obstruction like aqueductal stenosis. This may or may not be appropriate based on individual anatomy. Some infants can be treated with ETV and choroid plexus cauterization. Choroid plexus cauterization reduces the amount of cerebrospinal fluid produced by the brain. The technique, known as ETV/CPC, was pioneered in Uganda by neurosurgeon Benjamin Warf and is now in use in several U.S. hospitals.

===External hydrocephalus===
External hydrocephalus is generally seen in infants. It involves enlarged fluid spaces or subarachnoid spaces outside of the brain. The most common sign is a head circumference above the 90th percentile. In most cases, no other signs or symptoms are reported. Rarely reported symptoms include a tense anterior fontanel, developmental delay, seizures, irritability, and vomiting. Usually, this condition is benign. It resolves spontaneously by two to three years of age. Thus, it usually does not need insertion of a shunt. If surgical treatment is required, a ventriculoperitoneal shunt is usually preferred. Other treatment options include using medications like acetazolamide. The condition can be diagnosed and monitored with brain sonography and CT/MRI. These tests and a good medical history can help to identify external hydrocephalus from similar conditions: subdural hemorrhages or symptomatic chronic extra-axial fluid collections which are accompanied by vomiting, headaches, and seizures.

===Shunt complications===
Shunt surgery is one of the most common procedures in pediatric neurosurgery. Significant advances in shunt technology and surgical approaches have been made over the years. However, the lifetime risk for a revision surgery of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt in pediatric patients can reach up to 80%. Shunt failure rates are also high. Of the 40,000 surgeries performed annually for hydrocephalus, only 30% are a person’s first surgery. Many patients require multiple revisions during their lives. Common complications requiring revision include:

# overdrainage of cerebrospinal fluid
# obstrucion of the valve or catheter
# infection
# catheter disconnection/migration

If shunt failure occurs, the cerebrospinal fluid begins to accumulate again. This can cause a number of physical symptoms develop (headaches, nausea, vomiting, photophobia/light sensitivity), some extremely serious, such as seizures. Patient factors that are associated with shunt failure includes the cause of the hydrocephalus, prematurity, male sex, spina bifida, epilepsy, severity of ventricular dilation, ethnicity, and age &lt;1 year. The diagnosis of CSF buildup is complex and requires specialist expertise. Diagnosis can depend on whether symptoms occur. For example, whether symptoms occur when the person is upright or in a prone position (lying down) with the head at roughly the same level as the feet.

Overdrainage of cerebrospinal fluid occurs when the fluid drains more rapidly than it is produced by the choroid plexus. The rate of overdrainage is estimated to be about 10% to 12% within 6.5 years after shunt placement. Signs and symptoms of overdrainage includes:

* listlessness
* severe headaches
* irritability
* light sensitivity
* auditory hyperesthesia (sound sensitivity)
* hearing loss 
* nausea
* vomiting
* dizziness
* vertigo
* migraines
* seizures 
* a change in personality
* weakness in the arms or legs,
* strabismus
* double vision (to appear when the person is vertical or standing)

If the person lies down, the symptoms usually vanish quickly. Resistance to traditional analgesic pharmacological therapy may also be a sign of shunt overdrainage or failure. A CT scan may or may not show any change in ventricle size, particularly if the person has a history of slit-like ventricles. It can be challenging to diagnose over-drainage. This can make treatment of overdrainage particularly frustrating for people and their families. However, monitoring the intracranial pressure in combination with radiological findings has been found to be a useful tool for identifying cases of overdrainage. Prevention of this complication includes using adjustable pressure valves and integrated gravitational units. To alleviate the symptoms, a lumbar puncture or external lumbar or ventricular drainage could be used. To prevent chronic overdrainage, a valve exchange is recommended.

Shunt obstruction is the most common cause of shunt failure. The shunt can be obstructed at the catheter or the valve itself. Cases of shunt obstruction would present with similar symptoms to untreated hydrocephalus (headaches, nausea, lethargy, etc.). It can be caused by tissue, bacteria, or kinking of the catheter. Diagnosis is usually made by shunt tapping and imaging studies like CT. Treatment involves replacing or flushing the shunt to address the cause of the obstruction and restore flow through the catheter.

The rate of initial shunt infection ranges from 3.6 to 12.6% The signs and symptoms of shunt infection are variable, but the most common include headache, nausea, fever, swelling, and lethargy. Shunt infections are most commonly diagnosed by culturing the cerebrospinal fluid. According to studies, the most common cause of infection are bacteria, followed by fungi. The bacterial Staphylococcal species, especially coagulase-negative Staphylococcus and &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;, is responsible for almost 2/3 of shunt infections. It is believed that these organisms are introduced to the cerebrospinal fluid at the time of surgery. In the case of shunt infection, it is recommended to remove the shunt. place an external ventricular drain, and then place a new shunt. Current research is dedicated to methods to prevent such infections from occurring. Using antibiotics or different shunt hardware to prevent bacterial growth is being studied. The efficacy of more vigilant shunt surveillance is also being studied. Standardized protocols for inserting cerebral shunts have been shown to reduce shunt infections. There is tentative evidence that preventative antibiotics may decrease the risk of shunt infections.

Shunt migration is a relatively uncommon complication that requires a shunt revision. The most common sites that the shunt catheter can migrate to include the scrotum (30.67% of cases), followed by through the anus (22% of cases). Less common sites include the large intestine, small intestine, stomach, and oral cavity. Signs and symptoms vary depending on the site of migration. For example, intestinal migrations may present with abdominal pain, fever, and vomiting, especially if it perforates the bowel. Anal migration often presents with no symptoms.

Following placement of a VP shunt, there have been cases of a decrease in post-surgery hearing. It is presumed that the cochlea aqueduct is responsible for the decrease in hearing thresholds. The cochlea aqueduct has been considered as a probable channel where CSF pressure can be transmitted. Therefore, the reduced CSF pressure could cause a decrease in Perilymphatic pressure. This could cause secondary endolymphatic hydrops. In addition to the increased hearing loss, there have also been findings of resolved hearing loss after ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement, where there is a release of CSF pressure on the auditory pathways.

==Epidemiology==
It is estimated that congenital hydrocephalus occurs in 8.5 out of 10,000 live births globally. The disease burden is more concentrated in Africa, Asia, and South America. A study in 2019 estimated that there are 180,000 childhood hydrocephalus cases from the African continent per year. It also reported 90,000 cases from Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific. Congenital hydrocephalus was found to be associated with many factors. The health of the affected individual&#x27;s mother is one factor. Exposure to medications in the prenatal period such as antibiotics is another factor. Low socioeconomic status is also a factor. In adults that are 18–64 years-old, about 11 in 100,000 cases of hydrocephalus is estimated. For adults over 65 years of age, 175 in 100,000 cases is estimated.

==History==

In the pre-historic area, there were various paintings or artifacts depicting children or adults with macrocephaly (large head) or clinical findings of hydrocephalus. The earliest scientific description of hydrocephalus was written by the ancient Greek physician, Hippocrates. He coined the word &#x27;hydrocephalus&#x27; from the Greek ὕδωρ, hydōr meaning &#x27;water&#x27; and κεφαλή, kephalē meaning &#x27;head&#x27;. A more accurate description was later given by the Roman physician Galen in the second century AD.

The first clinical description of an operative procedure for hydrocephalus appears in the &quot;Al-Tasrif&quot; (1,000 AD). This was contributed by the Arab surgeon Abulcasis. He described the evacuation of superficial intracranial fluid in hydrocephalic children. In his chapter on neurosurgical disease, he described that infantile hydrocephalus was caused by mechanical compression. Specifically, he wrote:


In the 17th century, Isbrand de Diemerbroeck proposed that the enlargement of an 18-month-old child&#x27;s head was due to unhealthy diet. This diet would cause thick fluids to travel from the intestines to the skull. He proposed using a poultice and laxative to decrease the amount of fluids in the body. If those methods failed, he recommended a skin puncture to remove the fluid. In 1744, Claude-Nicolas Le Cat, a French surgeon, performed a ventricular puncture to treat a 3-month old with hydrocephalus. He attempted to perform this surgery a second time, but the patient did not survive. Also during the 18th century, an English physician named Michael Underwood reported the symptoms associated with hydrocephalus. He described vomiting, fever, dilated pupils, sensitivity to light, and diplopia. He also noted that patients eventually fell into a deep coma and died.

In 1881, Carl Wernicke pioneered sterile ventricular puncture and external drainage of CSF for the treatment of hydrocephalus. This occurred a few years after the landmark study of Retzius and Key. In 1891, Heinrich Quincke first described using a lumbar puncture to drain excess spinal fluid. This eventually led to investigating permanent treatment methods. This would require developing a continuous drain to treat hydrocephalus. In 1893, Jan MIkulicz-Radecki used a permanent shunt to drain CSF successfully. It wasn&#x27;t until the 20th century that hydrocephalus remained an intractable condition. This was when cerebral shunt and other neurosurgical treatment modalities were developed. In the early 20th century, the role of the arachnoid villi in absorbing cerebrospinal fluid was confirmed by Harvey Cushing. He recommended draining the fluid into the retroperitoneal space rather than the scalp. He was the first to attempt to create a shunt to the external jugular vein using a transplanted vein from the patient&#x27;s father. In the 1950s, the invention of radiotracers allowed for scientists to trace the flow of cerebrospinal fluid. These findings were critical for shaping future therapies and treatments of hydrocephalus.

The first hydrocephalus shunt was placed in 1956. For the next 30 years, advances in shunt material and design were made, such as development of a valve system. Additionally, the invention of prenatal ultrasound made diagnosis of fetal hydrocephalus possible around the 1970s and 1980s. In the 1980s and 1990s, it was found that an endoscope could be used to more accurately place ventricular catheters. The advent of endoscopic procedures also resulted in endoscopic third ventriculostomies being used more commonly. This is an alternative method from shunt placement to treat hydrocephalus.

==Society and culture==
=== Name ===
The word &quot;hydrocephalus&quot; is from the Greek meaning &#x27;water&#x27; and meaning &#x27;head&#x27;. Other names for hydrocephalus include &quot;water on the brain&quot;, a historical name, and &quot;water baby syndrome&quot;.

===Awareness ===
There are many organizations that advocate for hydrocephalus patients and promote research about its treatments. The Hydrocephalus Association was founded as a family support group in 1983 by parents of children with hydrocephalus. It has since expanded to a non-profit patient advocacy group, and has invested over $14 million in research since 2009. The National Hydrocephalus Foundation, also started by parents of a child with hydrocephalus, is a non-profit organization established in 1979. The Pediatric Hydrocephalus Foundation was founded in 2005 for similar purposes.

September was designated National Hydrocephalus Awareness Month in July 2009 by the U.S. Congress in . The resolution campaign is due in part to the advocacy work of the Pediatric Hydrocephalus Foundation. Prior to July 2009, no awareness month for this condition had been designated.

=== Notable cases ===

* Author Sherman Alexie, born with the condition, wrote about it in his semi-autobiographical junior fiction novel &quot;The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian&quot;.
* Prince William, Duke of Gloucester (1689–1700), probably contracted meningitis at birth, which resulted in this condition.
* Emperor Ferdinand I of Austria (1793–1875) became emperor in 1835 despite various health issues including hydrocephalus and epilepsy.
* Masato Kudo, a professional soccer player, died of hydrocephalus on October 21, 2022.
* Danny Bonaduce, a TV and radio personality, revealed that he would be undergoing surgery for hydrocephalus that was impeding his ability to walk properly in 2023
* King Charles II of Spain, known as &quot;El Hechizado&quot; (the Bewitched), is thought to have suffered from many diseases, including pituitary hormone deficiency, renal tubular acidosis, Klinefelter syndrome, fragile X syndrome, and hydrocephalus

<doc id="203298" wikidata="Q1372737" url="?curid=203298" title="Penile subincision">
<text>Penile subincision is a form of genital modification or mutilation consisting of a urethrotomy, in which the underside of the penis is incised and the urethra slit open lengthwise, from the urethral opening (meatus) toward the base. The slit can be of varying lengths.

Subincision was traditionally performed around the world, notably in Australia, but also in Africa, South America and the Polynesian and Melanesian cultures of the Pacific, often as a coming of age ritual.

Disadvantages include the risks inherent in the procedure itself, which is often self-performed, and increased susceptibility to sexually transmitted infections (STIs). The ability to impregnate (specifically, getting sperm into the vagina) may also be decreased.

Subincisions can greatly affect urination, often resulting in hypospadias requiring the subincised male to sit or squat while urinating. The scrotum can be pulled up against the open urethra to quasi-complete the tube and allow an approximation to normal urination, while a few subincised men carry a tube with which they can aim.

==Cultural traditions==


Subincision (like circumcision) is well documented among the peoples of the central desert of Australia such as the Arrernte and Luritja. The Arrernte word for subincision is &quot;arilta&quot;, and occurs as a rite of passage ritual for adolescent boys. It was given to the Arrernte by Mangar-kunjer-kunja, a lizard-man spirit being from the Dreamtime. Some academics theorise that a subincised penis is thought to resemble a vulva, and the bleeding is likened to menstruation. This type of modification of the penis was also traditionally performed by the Lardil people of Mornington Island, Queensland. The young men who underwent the procedure were the only ones to learn a simple ceremonial language, Damin. In later ceremonies, repeated throughout adult life, the subincised penis would be used as a site for ritual bloodletting. According to Ken Hale, who studied Damin, no ritual initiations have been carried out in the Gulf of Carpentaria for half a century, and hence the language has also died out.

Another indigenous Australian term for the custom is &quot;mika&quot; or the &quot;terrible rite&quot;.

Samburu herdboys of Kenya are said to perform subincisions on themselves (or sometimes their peers) at age seven to ten. In Samoa, subincision of the foreskin, skin located along the tip of the penis, was ritually performed upon young men, as in Hawaii, where subincision of the foreskin is reported to have been performed at age six or seven.

<text>Changsha is the capital of Hunan, China. It is the 15th most populous city in China with a population of 10,513,100, the third-most populous city in Central China, and the most livable city in China, located in the lower reaches of the Xiang River in northeastern Hunan.

The city forms a part of the Greater Changsha Metropolitan Region along with Zhuzhou and Xiangtan, also known as the Changzhutan City Cluster. Greater Changsha was named one of the 13 emerging mega-cities in China in 2012 by the Economist Intelligence Unit. It is also a National Comprehensive Transportation Hub, and one of the first National Famous Historical and Cultural Cities in China. Changshanese, a kind of Xiang Chinese, is spoken in the downtown area, while Ningxiangnese and Liuyangnese are also spoken in the counties and cities under its jurisdiction. As of the 2020 Chinese census, the prefecture-level city of Changsha had a population of 10,047,914 inhabitants.

Changsha has a history of more than 2,400 years of urban construction, and the name &quot;Changsha&quot; first appeared in the &quot;Yi Zhou Shu&quot; written in the pre-Qin era. In the Qin dynasty, the Changsha Commandery was set up, and in the Western Han dynasty, the Changsha Kingdom was established. The Tongguan Kiln in Changsha during the Tang dynasty produced the world&#x27;s earliest underglaze porcelain, which was exported to Western Asia, Africa and Europe. In the period of the Five Dynasties, Changsha was the capital of Southern Chu. In the Northern Song dynasty, the Yuelu Academy (later Hunan University) was one of the four major private academies over the last 1000 years. In the late Qing dynasty, Changsha was one of the four major trade cities for rice and tea in China. In 1904, it was opened to foreign trade, and gradually became a revolutionary city. In Changsha, Tan Sitong established the School of Current Affairs, Huang Xing founded the China Arise Society with the slogan &quot;Expel the Tatar barbarians and revive Zhonghua&quot; (驱除鞑虏，复兴中华), and Mao Zedong also carried out his early political movements here. During the Republican Era, Changsha became one of the major home fronts in the Second Sino-Japanese War, but the subsequent Wenxi Fire in 1938 and the three Battles of Changsha from 1939 to 1942 (1939, 1941 and 1941–42) hit Changsha&#x27;s economy and urban construction hard.

Changsha is now one of the core cities in the Yangtze River Economic Belt and the Belt and Road Initiative, a Beta- (global second-tier) city by the GaWC, a new Chinese first-tier city and also a pioneering area for China-Africa economic and trade cooperation. Known as the &quot;Construction machinery capital of the world&quot;, Changsha has an industrial chain with construction machinery and new materials as the main industries, complemented by automobiles, electronic information, household appliances, and biomedicine. Since the 1990s, Changsha has begun to accelerate economic development, and then achieved the highest growth rate among China&#x27;s major cities during the 2000s. The Xiangjiang New Area, the first state-level new area in Central China, was established in 2015. As of 2023, more than 180 Global 500 companies have established branches in Changsha. The city has the 27th largest skyline in the world. The HDI of Changsha reached 0.817 (very high) in 2016, which is roughly comparable to a moderately developed country.

As of 2023, Changsha hosts 59 institutions of higher education, ranking 8th nationwide among all cities in China. The city houses four Double First-Class Construction universities: Hunan, National University of Defense Technology, Central South, and Hunan Normal, making Changsha the seat of several highly ranked educational institutions. It is a major center of research and innovation in the Asia-Pacific with a high level of scientific research, ranking 23rd globally in 2024. Changsha is the birthplace of super hybrid rice, the Tianhe-1 supercomputer, China&#x27;s first laser 3D printer, and China&#x27;s first domestic medium-low speed maglev line. Changsha has been named the first &quot;UNESCO City of Media Arts&quot; in China. The city is home to the Hunan Broadcasting System (HBS), the most influential provincial TV station in China.

==Names==
&quot;Chángshā&quot; is the pinyin romanization of the Mandarin pronunciation of the Chinese name or , meaning &quot;long sandy place&quot;. The name&#x27;s origin is unknown. It is attested as early as the 11th , when a vassal lord of the area sent King Cheng of Zhou a gift described as a &quot;Changsha softshell turtle&quot; (). In the 2nd century AD, historian Ying Shao wrote that the Qin use of the name &quot;Changsha&quot; for the area was a continuance of its old name. The name originally described the area. The Chu metropolis was known as Qingyang. The capital of the Kingdom of Changshawithin the present-day city of Changshawas known as Linxiang, meaning &quot;[place] Overlooking the Xiang River&quot;.

== History ==

===Early history===
Development started around when Changsha developed with the proliferation of Longshan culture, although there is no firm evidence of such a link. Evidence exists that people lived and thrived in the area during the Bronze Age. Numerous examples of pottery and other objects have been discovered.

Later Chinese legends related that the Flame and Yellow Emperors visited the area. Sima Qian&#x27;s history states that the Yellow Emperor granted his eldest son Shaohao the lands of Changsha and its neighbors. During the Spring and Autumn period (8th5th centuryBC), the Yue culture spread into the area around Changsha. During the succeeding Warring States period, Chu took control of Changsha. Its capital, Qingyang, became an important southern outpost of the kingdom. In 1951–57 archaeologists explored numerous large and medium-sized Chu tombs from the Warring States Era. More than 3,000 tombs have been discovered. Under the Qin dynasty , Changsha was a staging post for expeditions south into Guangdong that led to its conquest and the establishment of the Nanyue kingdom.

Under the Han Linxiang was the capital of the kingdom of Changsha. At first this was a client state held by Liu Bang&#x27;s Baiyue ally Wu Rui that served as a means of controlling the restive Chu people and as a buffer state against Nanyue. By Linxiang had city walls to protect it against uprisings and invasions. The famous Mawangdui tombs were constructed between 186 and Lady Xin Zhui was buried in the earliest tomb and, during its excavation in the 1970s, was found to have been very well preserved. More importantly, the tombs included the earliest surviving copies of the &quot;Tao Te Ching&quot; and other important literary and historical documents.

When Wu Rui&#x27;s descendant Wu Zhu &quot;Wú Zhù&quot;) died childless in , the kingdom was granted to a cadet branch of the imperial family as their fief. The kingdom was abolished under Wang Mang&#x27;s short-lived Xin dynasty and briefly revived by the Eastern Han. In its prince was demoted and the area administered as and Changsha Commandery.

The Three Kingdoms state of Wu ruled Changsha for several decades, a period whose administration is well known because its documents have been excavated. Following the turmoil of the Three Kingdoms, Emperor Wu of Jin granted Changsha to his sixth son Sima Yi. The local government had over 100 counties at the beginning of the dynasty. Over the course of the dynasty, the local government of Changsha lost control over a few counties, leaving them to local rule.

The Sui dynasty (6th century) renamed Xiangzhou to Changsha Tan Prefecture or Tanzhou. It was named after Zhaotan in the ninth year of Emperor Kaihuang (589 A.D.) of the Sui dynasty, and the Tanzhou General Manager was established. During the reign of Emperor Yang of the Sui dynasty, Tanzhou was abolished, and Changsha County, a first-level administrative unit, was established, but the jurisdiction area was reduced. Changsha&#x27;s 3-tier administration was simplified to a 2-tier state and county system, eliminating the middle canton region. Under the Tang, Changsha prospered as a center of trade between central China and Southeast Asia but suffered during the Anshi Rebellion, when it fell to the rebels.

In early 10th century, Changsha served as the capital of the state of Nanchu (南楚), or Southern Chu, established by Ma Yin (马殷) in 907, one of the ten southern war loads. Nanchu, lasted about 50 years, was the only independent state in the history that has ever been built in Hunan with Changsha as the capital, being eventually overthrown by Nantang (南唐) in 951.

Under the Song dynasty, the Yuelu Academy was founded in 976. It was destroyed by war in 1127 and rebuilt in 1165, during which year the celebrated philosopher Zhu Xi taught there. It was again destroyed by the Mongols during the establishment of the Yuan before being restored in the late 15th century under the Ming. Early 19th-century graduates of the academy formed what one historian called a &quot;network of messianic alumni&quot;, including Zeng Guofan, architect of the Tongzhi Restoration, and Cai E, a major leader in the defense of the Republic of China. In 1903 the academy became Hunan High School. Modern-day Hunan University is also a descendant of the Yuelu Academy. Some of its buildings were remodeled from 1981 to 1986 according to their presumed original Song design.

During the Mongol conquest of the Southern Song, Tanzhou was fiercely defended by the local Song troops. After the city finally fell, the defenders committed mass suicide. Under the Ming (14th–17th centuries), Tanzhou was again renamed Changsha and made a superior prefecture.

=== Modern history ===

Under the Qing (17th–20th centuries), Changsha was the capital of Hunan and prospered as one of China&#x27;s chief rice markets. During the Taiping Rebellion, the city was besieged by the rebels in 1852 or 1854 for three months but never fell. The rebels moved on to Wuhan, but Changsha then became the principal base for the government&#x27;s suppression of the rebellion.

The 1903 Treaty of Shanghai between the Qing and Japanese empires opened the city to foreign trade effective 1904. Most favored nation clauses in other unequal treaties extended the Japanese gains to the Western powers as well. Consequently, international capital entered the town and factories, churches, and schools were built. A college was started by Yale alumni, which later became a medical centre named Xiangya and a secondary school named the Yali School.
Following the Xinhai Revolution, further development followed the opening of the railway to Hankou in Hubei province in 1918, which was later extended to Guangzhou in Guangdong Province in 1936. Although Changsha&#x27;s population grew, the city remained primarily commercial in character. Before 1937, it had little industry apart from some small cotton-textile, glass, and nonferrous-metal plants and handicraft enterprises.

Mao Zedong, the founder of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, began his political career in Changsha. He was a student at the Hunan Number 1 Teachers&#x27; Training School from 1913 to 1918. He later returned as a teacher and principal from 1920 to 1922. The school was destroyed during the Chinese Civil War but has since been restored. The former office of the Hunan Communist Party Central Committee where Mao Zedong once lived is now a museum that includes Mao&#x27;s living quarters, photographs and other historical items from the 1920s.

Until May 1927, communist support remained strong in Changsha before the massacre carried out by the right-wing faction of the KMT troops. The faction owed its allegiance to Chiang Kai-shek during its offensive against the KMT&#x27;s left-wing faction under Wang Jingwei, who was then allied closely with the Communists. The purge of communists and suspected communists was part of Chiang&#x27;s plans for consolidating his hold over the KMT, weakening Wang&#x27;s control, and thereby over the entire China. In a period of twenty days, Chiang&#x27;s forces killed more than ten thousand people in Changsha and its outskirts.

During the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937–45), Changsha&#x27;s strategic location made it the focus of four campaigns by the Imperial Japanese Army to capture it from the Nationalist Army: these campaigns were the 1st Changsha, the 2nd Changsha, the 3rd Changsha, and the 4th Changsha. The city was able to repulse the first three attacks thanks to Xue Yue&#x27;s leadership, but ultimately fell into Japanese hands in 1944 for a year until the Japanese were defeated in a counterattack and forced to surrender. Before these Japanese campaigns, the city was already virtually destroyed by the 1938 Changsha Fire, a deliberate fire ordered by Kuomintang commanders who mistakenly feared the city was about to fall to the Japanese; Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek had suggested that the city be burned so that the Japanese force would gain nothing after entering it.

Following the Communist victory in the Chinese Civil War, Changsha slowly recovered from its former damage. Since Deng Xiaoping&#x27;s Reform and Opening Up Policy, Changsha has rapidly developed since the 1990s, becoming one of the important cities in the central and western regions. At the end of 2007, Changsha, Zhuzhou, and Xiangtan received approval from the State Council for the &quot;Chang-Zhu-Tan (Greater Changsha) Resource-Saving and Environment-Friendly Society Comprehensive Reform Pilot Area&quot;, an important engine in the Rise of Central China plan. In 2015, Xiangjiang New Area was approved as a national new area.

<text>Ahmad al-Shukeiri (, also transliterated al-Shuqayri, Shuqairi, Shuqeiri, Shukeiry; 1 January 1908 – 26 February 1980) was a Palestinian political leader and the first Chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, serving from 1964 to 1967.

== Early life ==
Shukeiri was born in Tebnine, south Lebanon then Ottoman Empire to a Turkish mother and a Palestinian father, As&#x27;ad Shukeiri (1860–1940) (who was elected to the Ottoman Parliament in 1908 and 1912). Ahmad acquired the Turkish language from his mother. After studying law in the British law college in Jerusalem, he became a prominent lawyer in British-Palestine and a member of the Independence Party. In 1945 he went to Washington, D.C. to establish a Palestinian office and in 1946 joined the Arab Higher Committee.

==Political career==
Shukeiri was a member of the Syrian delegation to the United Nations from 1949 to 1951. He then became assistant Secretary General for the Arab League from 1950 to 1956, Saudi ambassador to the United Nations from 1957 to 1962. At the 1964 Arab League summit (Cairo), he was given a mandate to initiate contacts aimed at establishing a Palestinian entity.

In December 1962, representing Saudi Arabia, he told the Special Political Committee of the United Nations General Assembly that the Tacuara movement had been formed to combat Zionism and he hoped it would spread in Latin America and its principles adopted by the United Nations. After receiving information about Tacuara from the Argentinian and Chilean delegations, he backed down, acknowledging that Tacuara was a fascist movement and claiming instead that it was more appropriate to compare Tacuara to Israel.

===Chairman of the PLO===
In May 1964, he was elected the first Chairman of the PLO (Palestine Liberation Organization) with the support of Egyptian leader Gamal Abdel Nasser.

From 28 May to 2 June 1964 Shukeiri and 396 nominated representatives from Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, the Gaza strip, Egypt, Qatar, Kuwait, Libya and Iraq attended a Palestinian Conference (the First Palestinian National Council in East Jerusalem). Delegates wore badges carrying a map of Palestine and inscribed &quot;We shall return&quot;. &quot;The Times&quot; reported that following an introductory address by King Hussein of Jordan, Shukeiri told delegates that &quot;Palestinians had experienced 16 years&#x27; misery and it was time they relied on themselves and liberated Palestine from the Israelis&quot;. The conference announced the establishment of the PLO as the representative of the Palestinian Arabs. Shukeiri and his colleagues also announced the formation of the Palestinian National Fund, and at the Second Arab Summit Conference in Alexandria in September 1964 of a military wing, the Palestine Liberation Army.

===&quot;Throw the Jews into the sea&quot;===

Prior to the Six Day War, Shukeiri, in an interview with Lebanese newspaper &quot;al-Yawm&quot;, stated &quot;we will endeavor to assist [the Jews] and facilitate their departure by sea to their countries of origin.&quot; Regarding the fate of Israeli-born Jews, he
replied: &quot;Whoever survives will stay in Filastin, but in my opinion no one will remain alive.&#x27;

These statements gained little public attention at the time, but after the war, they were used as part of the Israeli government&#x27;s justification of their initiation of active hostilities, utilizing a combined paraphrase of both statements and claiming that Shukeiri declared intention to &quot;throw Jews into the sea&quot;.

Shukeiri initially denied having made such a statement, but was widely criticized and ostracized by Palestinian and Arab leadership for having weakened the international standing of the Arab cause, with Jordanian Prime Minister Saad Jumaa later stating &quot;that [Shukeiri] is one of the direct causes for the catastrophe [the Arab defeat in the Six-Day War]. He had the appearance and bearings to play a role perfectly suited to him in the catastrophe of the Arab world and in Arab disputes, and unfortunately he fulfilled this function with alacrity and expertise.&quot;

In his 1971 apologia, &quot;Dialogues and Secrets with Kings&quot;, Shukeiri admitted usage of the phrase and similar language, claiming it reflected the accepted official Arab outlook at the time, but was &quot;indignant that such extremism should be fathered on him alone.&quot;

===Resignation===

In the aftermath of the Six-Day War, Shukeiri resigned as PLO Chairman in December 1967, and was succeeded by Yahya Hammuda.

== Later life ==
Between 1968 and 1979, Shukeiri wrote more than twenty books dealing with the Palestinian cause and the Arab Unity.

He died on February 26, 1980, aged 72, in Amman, Jordan.

<doc id="203302" wikidata="Q22918941" url="?curid=203302" title="New Romantics (song)">
<text>&quot;New Romantics&quot; is a song by the American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift from the deluxe edition of her fifth studio album, &quot;1989&quot; (2014). She wrote it with the producers Max Martin and Shellback. The title references the New Romantic cultural movement of the 1970s and 1980s; the new wave music style of that era influenced the song&#x27;s synth-pop production. &quot;New Romantics&quot; has an upbeat sound instrumented by pulsing synthesizers, and its lyrics are about reigniting one&#x27;s hopes and energy after enduring heartbreak.

Big Machine Records released &quot;New Romantics&quot; as the seventh and final single from &quot;1989&quot; on February 23, 2016. The song&#x27;s music video is a compilation of footage from the 1989 World Tour that Swift embarked on in 2015. In the United States, &quot;New Romantics&quot; peaked at number 46 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America. The single peaked in the top 40 on the charts in Australia, Belgian Flanders, Lebanon, and Scotland, and it received certifications in Australia, Brazil, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom.

Many music critics hailed the energetic and lively production of &quot;New Romantics&quot;. Several commented that the song should have been featured in &quot;1989&quot;&#x27;s standard release and have deemed it one of Swift&#x27;s best songs. A few critics otherwise deemed it a forgettable track. In 2019, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; included &quot;New Romantics&quot; in their list of the 100 best songs of the 2010s decade. Following a 2019 dispute regarding the ownership of Swift&#x27;s back catalog, she re-recorded the song and released it as &quot;New Romantics (Taylor&#x27;s Version)&quot; as part of her 2023 re-recorded album &quot;1989 (Taylor&#x27;s Version)&quot;.

==Production==
Inspired by 1980s synth-pop, the singer-songwriter Taylor Swift moved away from the country-styled music of her previous releases to employ a straightforward pop production for her fifth studio album, &quot;1989&quot; (2014). To this end, she enlisted prominent mainstream pop producers, including Swedish hitmakers Max Martin and Shellback; Swift also recruited the former as co-executive producer. Martin and Shellback produced seven out of thirteen tracks on the album&#x27;s standard edition, and two out of three bonus tracks on the deluxe edition, including &quot;New Romantics&quot;. Swift, Martin and Shellback are credited as the songwriters of &quot;New Romantics&quot;. The song was recorded by Michael Ilbert at MXM Studios in Stockholm, Sweden, and Sam Holland at Conway Recording Studios in Los Angeles. It was mixed by Serban Ghenea at MixStar Studios in Virginia Beach, Virginia, and mastered by Tom Coyne at Sterling Sound Studios in New York City.

==Music and lyrics==

&quot;New Romantics&quot; incorporates pulsating synthesizers. The song&#x27;s title is a reference to the New Romantic cultural movement of the late 1970s and 1980s. According to &quot;Slate&quot; editor Forrest Wickman, this reference is also apparent through the song&#x27;s sonic resemblance to the era&#x27;s new wave. Rob Sheffield of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; dubbed &quot;New Romantics&quot; the song that showcased the most authentic tribute to 1980s synth-pop on &quot;1989&quot;. AllMusic&#x27;s Stephen Thomas Erlewine similarly considered the track among the few on the album that truly sounded like 1980s pop, specifically &quot;1983 new wave&quot;. For Corey Baesley from &quot;PopMatters&quot;, &quot;New Romantics&quot; is where Swift emulates the &quot;indie electro-pop&quot; styles of the Scottish band Chvrches. While acknowledging the 1980s influences, such as the &quot;coolness&quot; of the 1980 hit &quot;We Got the Beat&quot;, the musicologist James Perone opined that &quot;New Romantics&quot; was musically &quot;more about the pop music of the 21st century&quot; than about the prevailing styles of the New Romantic era.

The lyrics are about Swift reigniting her hopes and energy after the heartbreak she had endured. For &quot;Pitchfork&quot; Vrinda Jagota, &quot;New Romantics&quot; is where Swift brushes off the pain &quot;into a night of uninhibited hedonism&quot;, representing her departure from &quot;slow-burning heartache&quot; on her previous songs towards a more positive, laid-back attitude. The refrain starts with Swift singing, Cause baby I could build a castle / Out of all the bricks they threw at me.&quot; Anna Leszkiewicz from the &quot;New Statesman&quot; commented that the &quot;castle&quot; imagery in &quot;New Romantics&quot; was used in a &quot;self-referential way&quot; and departed from the fairytale notion of &quot;castles&quot; on Swift&#x27;s previous songs. The lyrics, &quot;Heartbreak is the national anthem, we sing it proudly / We are too busy dancing to get knocked off our feet&quot;, find Swift celebrating the joys of youth; Emily Yahr from &quot;The Washington Post&quot; said this sentiment resembled Swift&#x27;s 2013 single &quot;22&quot;. &quot;Slate&quot; Carl Wilson described the song as &quot;1989&quot; representation of Swift&#x27;s new attitude towards romance. The lyric, &quot;The best people in life are free&quot;, sees Swift no longer seeking revenge on ex-lovers. Perone noted that the lyrics were representational of Swift&#x27;s generation&#x27;s defiant and carefree attitude, which he compared to that of the mods in the 1960s, specifically citing the Who&#x27;s 1965 song &quot;My Generation&quot;.

==Release==

&quot;New Romantics&quot; was initially one of the three bonus tracks on the deluxe edition of &quot;1989&quot;, which was available exclusively at Target in the United States. On February 17, 2015, Swift announced that she would release the three bonus tracks to iTunes Stores in the United States as promotional singles one at a time. &quot;New Romantics&quot; was released on March 3, 2015, by Big Machine Records. Following this release, the song entered the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart dated March 21, 2015, at number 71.

On February 19, 2016, Swift announced that &quot;New Romantics&quot; would be the seventh and final single from &quot;1989&quot;. Republic Records in partnership with Big Machine released the song to US contemporary hit and hot adult contemporary radio stations on February 23. Upon its single release, &quot;New Romantics&quot; debuted at number 28 on Pop Songs, a &quot;Billboard&quot; airplay chart; it peaked at number 18 on Pop Songs. The single peaked at number 46 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart dated April 30, 2016, and spent eight weeks on the chart. It reached the top 40 on charts in Lebanon (18), Belgian Flanders (33), Australia (35), and Scotland (40). &quot;New Romantics&quot; received a gold certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for exceeding 500,000 track-equivalent units, based on sales and on-demand streams. It also received a gold certification by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA), which indicates 35,000 units. The song received a nomination for Choice Song – Female Artist at the 2016 Teen Choice Awards.

On April 6, Swift released the music video for &quot;New Romantics&quot; exclusively on Apple Music, which required a paid subscription. Directed by Jonas Åkerlund, the video consists of concert and behind-the-scenes footage during the 1989 World Tour in 2015, intertwined with Swift&#x27;s voice-overs about her thoughts for her fans. Laura Bertens, a scholar in art history and cultural studies, cited &quot;New Romantics&quot; as an example of &quot;why music videos often elicit strong reactions&quot;. Bertens noted that the behind-the-scenes footage of Swift&#x27;s performances made the audience connect with her on a personal level, &quot;to see the private person behind the celebrity, all the while knowing that we are looking at a performance as well&quot;. &quot;Complex&quot; Jessie Morris deemed the exclusive Apple release part of Swift&#x27;s &quot;partnership&quot; with Apple Music, with whom Swift had collaborated on advertisements and interviews. &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; Karl Quinn labeled the release a &quot;cynical move&quot;, through which Swift implicitly encouraged her fans to subscribe to Apple Music to balance the competition with Spotify—the largest on-demand streaming platform at the time. Swift had publicly condemned Spotify&#x27;s free streaming services that provided low royalties for artists. Swift made the video available on her Vevo and YouTube accounts on April 13, 2016, without subscription requirements.

==Critical reception==
Upon the release of &quot;1989&quot;, Corey Beasley from &quot;PopMatters&quot; deemed &quot;New Romantics&quot; and the other two deluxe edition bonus tracks more &quot;compositionally daring&quot; than any track on the standard edition. Beasley favorably likened the song to the works of Chvrches, writing that &quot;[Swift] can do it better than anyone else&quot;. &quot;Slate&quot; Carl Wilson called it &quot;manifesto-toned&quot;, and &quot;Pitchfork&quot; Vrinda Jagota described the track as a &quot;surging, euphoric&quot; number that captures the essence of the album. Josh Duboff from &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; lamented the song&#x27;s exclusion from the standard edition of &quot;1989&quot;, writing that it could end up as an album track &quot;on pretty much any other 2014 pop star&#x27;s album&quot;. Aimee Cliff from &quot;Fact&quot; picked &quot;New Romantics&quot; as an example that best demonstrates Swift&#x27;s ability to &quot;[document] memories as romantic, filtered snapshots&quot;.

Sheffield ranked &quot;New Romantics&quot; as the second best song of 2014 and the second-greatest song of Swift&#x27;s career, behind &quot;All Too Well&quot; (2012). He hailed it as a &quot;work of genius, exceeding even the wildest hopes any fan could have dreamed&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; featured &quot;New Romantics&quot; at number 58 in their list &quot;100 Best Songs of the 2010s&quot;; Brittany Spanos described it as &quot;the type of relieving dance floor soul purge that the best pop can be&quot;. Retrospective reviews from &quot;The Guardian&quot; Alexis Petridis, &quot;NME&quot; Hannah Mylrae, and &quot;Paste&quot; Jane Song have commented that the song should have made the final cut of &quot;1989&quot; standard edition. Lucy Ford from &quot;British GQ&quot; ranked the single among Swift&#x27;s 10 best and praised its &quot;cheeky and winking&quot; theme. In a list ranking the bonus tracks from Swift&#x27;s albums, &quot;Variety&quot;&#x27;s Chris Willman ranked &quot;New Romantics&quot; third and described it as Swift and Martin&#x27;s &quot;peak [...] collaboration in terms of sheer ear candy&quot;.

There were less enthusiastic reviews. Nate Jones from &quot;Vulture&quot; regarded &quot;New Romantics&quot; as a weaker attempt at &quot;writing a big generational attempt&quot; than Swift&#x27;s 2012 song &quot;22&quot;. Chris Richards of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; said that the song &quot;registers somewhere between moldy emo and the back pages of a high school literary magazine&quot;, containing some of the &quot;worst lyrics&quot; on &quot;1989&quot;.

== Live performances ==
Swift included &quot;New Romantics&quot; on the set list for the 1989 World Tour, which ran from May to November 2015. She sang the song at the Formula 1 United States Grand Prix at the Circuit of the Americas on October 22, 2016, and at the DirecTV Super Saturday Night, as part of a series of pre-Super Bowl concerts, on February 4, 2017. Swift performed an acoustic guitar rendition at the August 9, 2023, show of the Eras Tour at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California, prefaced by her announcement of the October 27 release of her re-recording of &quot;1989&quot;, &quot;1989 (Taylor&#x27;s Version)&quot;. She sang the song again as part of a guitar medley with her songs &quot;Message in a Bottle&quot; and &quot;How You Get the Girl&quot; in dedication to Martin on the May 19, 2024, show of the tour at Friends Arena in Stockholm.

== &quot;New Romantics (Taylor&#x27;s Version)&quot; ==
After signing a new contract with Republic Records, Swift began re-recording her first six studio albums in November 2020. The decision followed a public 2019 dispute between Swift and the talent manager Scooter Braun, who acquired Big Machine Records, including the masters of Swift&#x27;s albums which the label had released. By re-recording the albums, Swift had full ownership of the new masters, which enabled her to control the licensing of her songs for commercial use and therefore substituted the Big Machine–owned masters.

The re-recording of &quot;New Romantics&quot;, subtitled &quot;Taylor&#x27;s Version&quot;, was released as part of &quot;1989&quot; re-recording, &quot;1989 (Taylor&#x27;s Version)&quot;, on October 27, 2023. Swift produced &quot;New Romantics (Taylor&#x27;s Version)&quot; with Christopher Rowe, who had produced her previous re-recordings. The track was engineered by Derek Garten at Prime Recording Studio in Nashville, Tennessee; mixed by Ghenea at MixStar Studios in Virginia Beach, Virginia; and mastered by Randy Merrill at Sterling Sound in Edgewater, New Jersey. Rowe recorded Swift&#x27;s vocals at Kitty Committee Studio in New York.

<text>Vapor Trails is the seventeenth studio album by Canadian rock band Rush. It was released on May 14, 2002, on Anthem Records, and was their first studio release since &quot;Test for Echo&quot; (1996), the longest gap between two Rush albums. After the &quot;Test For Echo&quot; tour finished in July 1997, drummer and lyricist Neil Peart suffered the loss of his daughter and then his wife in separate tragedies. As a result, the group entered an extended hiatus during which it was not certain they would continue. They eventually reunited in January 2001 to rehearse material for a new album, recording for which lasted until December. For the first and only time since &quot;Caress of Steel&quot; (1975), the group did not use any keyboards or synthesizers in their music, incorporating many layers of guitar, bass and drums instead.

&quot;Vapor Trails&quot; reached No. 3 in Canada and No. 6 in the United States. &quot;One Little Victory&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s lead single in March 2002 and went to No. 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Mainstream Rock chart in the United States. The next single was &quot;Secret Touch&quot;. The album went gold in Canada in August 2002. The Vapor Trails Tour lasted from June through November 2002, which saw the band play to the largest crowds of its career in Brazil. Following the band&#x27;s dissatisfaction with the album&#x27;s overall production, two tracks were remixed for the &quot;Retrospective III: 1989–2008&quot; compilation album. The positive feedback from this resulted in the entire &quot;Vapor Trails&quot; album being remixed by David Bottrill and released on September 30, 2013, as &quot;Vapor Trails Remixed&quot;, both as a separate release and as part of &quot;The Studio Albums 1989–2007&quot;.

==Background==
After Rush finished their Test for Echo Tour in July 1997, the group entered a five-year hiatus following the personal tragedies in drummer Neil Peart&#x27;s life, losing his daughter Selena in August 1997 and wife Jackie in June 1998. Peart took a hiatus and rode around North America on a motorcycle, covering . At some point in his journey, Peart decided to return to the band. In his book &quot;Ghost Rider: Travels on the Healing Road&quot;, Peart writes of how he had told his bandmates at Selena&#x27;s funeral, &quot;consider me retired.&quot; However, in October 2000, after a period of recuperation, Lee announced during promotional interviews for his solo album &quot;My Favourite Headache&quot; that Rush were to get together in the following January with the intention to write and rehearse material for a new studio album. Lee said that the album was not made for simply new music, but for &quot;the psychological health and welfare of all the people who have gone through a very difficult time.&quot;

==Writing and recording==
The trio gathered at Reaction Studios in Toronto on January 9, 2001, but did not play anything for three weeks. They discussed what they wanted to achieve and how the album should take shape. Lifeson said it was to get &quot;a feel for each other&#x27;s frame of mind. We needed to see if everybody was really up for it.&quot; Lee and Lifeson said that they chose the studio based on its &quot;artist friendly environment, that was very comfortable and accommodating&quot;. Among the topics discussed was the album&#x27;s musical direction which became a source of difficulty as initially, there was little agreement on what it should be. Upon reaching a consensus, Lifeson said the three found common ground &quot;on every aspect of the recording.&quot;

The band started working, adopting a three-week-on, one-week-off schedule with no one present apart from a technical assistant. The group was hopeful there was still chemistry amongst them to make an album. They adopted their usual method of writing with Lee and Lifeson working together on musical ideas in the studio control room while Peart worked elsewhere on the lyrics, this time using a pen, paper and a computer. Peart wrote about their attitude towards the sessions: &quot;We laid out no parameters, no goals, no limitations, only that we would take a relaxed, civilized approach.&quot; Peart looked through his scrapbook of notes and phrases he&#x27;d collected and explored ways of connecting them together to form a complete lyrical idea. Lee and Lifeson developed ideas largely through jam sessions typically kicked off by setting a pattern on a drum machine and playing along, recording every session using Logic Pro. This was to avoid making a demo tape of a collection of songs and re-record them at a later point. This way, early takes became the basis of the songs which kept the music fresh using as many original takes where possible.

After several weeks Peart presented the ideas he&#x27;d formed, but Lee and Lifeson had not put down any concrete pieces of music. Peart recalled they were not yet &quot;serious&quot; and still wanted to play and explore ideas as sifting through what they had put to tape was a tedious process and disrupted their creative flow. Peart had completed six sets of lyrics at this point but was not getting feedback from his bandmates as he had before, so he paused on lyrics and focused on his book &quot;Ghost Rider: Travels on the Healing Road&quot;. The three became dissatisfied with what they&#x27;d come up with and thought it was too forced, which led to their decision to take some weeks off. They did so, and returned feeling refreshed and more focused, and were able to work out complete songs, not just sections. The songs that emerged from these early jams were &quot;Peaceable Kingdom,&quot; &quot;Ceiling Unlimited&quot; and &quot;Nocturne,&quot; all of which still contain some parts put down from the original takes, in their final form. According to Lifeson, no tracks were completely re-recorded.

&quot;Vapor Trails&quot; is the first album since &quot;Caress of Steel&quot; (1975) not to feature keyboards. Lifeson had often worried about the presence of keyboards on previous Rush albums, but this time Lee had agreed not to use them. Lifeson therefore spent a greater amount of time devising guitar parts that were &quot;richer on tonality and harmonic quality&quot;, adequate for the background tracks. He also avoided sound effects on his guitar, to achieve a more raw sound. At certain points in recording his drum parts, Peart had been influenced by Who drummer Keith Moon and played in his style of more lyrical drumming, rather than simply keeping the beat.

After taking a break in June 2001, Rush began to record their new songs in mid-August. Initially they decided to write 13 tracks for the album and pick the best 10 or 11 for the final selection, but when the time arrived they agreed to include all of them. They were joined by English producer Paul Northfield, who had worked on several previous Rush albums and assisted in the arrangement to some tracks when the group felt stuck. The band are credited as co-producers. In December 2001, the group left the Reaction Studios and started mixing the album at Metalworks Studios with David Leonard. The mixing was complete in March 2002, after which it was sent to Masterdisk in New York City for mastering by Howie Weinberg. Rush chose him having liked the sound of the other albums that Weinberg had worked on.

==Reception==

The production of &quot;Vapor Trails&quot; has been criticized by the band themselves, critics and fans alike because of the album&#x27;s &quot;loud&quot; sound quality. It has overly compressed (clipped) audio levels during mastering, which generates additional digital distortion during the CD production. The trend, known as the loudness war, was very common on modern CD production at the time. Alex Lifeson stated:

It was a contest, and it was mastered too high, and it crackles, and it spits, and it just crushes everything. All the dynamics get lost, especially anything that had an acoustic guitar in it.

&quot;Billboard&quot; gave a favorable review.

==&quot;Vapor Trails Remixed&quot;==
&quot;Vapor Trails Remixed&quot; is a remixed version of &quot;Vapor Trails&quot; mixed by David Bottrill. The album was released by Atlantic Records and Rhino Entertainment on September 30, 2013, and entered at No. 35 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. The band had been unhappy with the original album&#x27;s overall sonic production. Influenced by the positive reaction to the remixes of &quot;One Little Victory&quot; and &quot;Earthshine&quot; featured on &quot;Retrospective III&quot; by Richard Chycki, Rush and Bottrill remixed the entire album. In an interview with Modern Guitars, Lifeson remarked that, since the remixes were so good, there had been talk of doing an entire remix of the album. &quot;Vapor Trails Remixed&quot; peaked in the US Billboard Charts at number 35.

&quot;Vapor Trails Remixed&quot; is also included in the box-set of Atlantic Studio Albums called &quot;The Studio Albums 1989–2007&quot;, in lieu of the original version.

<doc id="203305" wikidata="Q1934625" url="?curid=203305" title="Grammy Award for Best Female R&amp;B Vocal Performance">
<text>The Grammy Award for Best Female R&amp;B Vocal Performance (previously called Best Rhythm and Blues Solo Vocal Performance, Female) was an honor presented at the Grammy Awards, a ceremony established in 1958 and originally called the Gramophone Awards, to female recording artists for quality R&amp;B songs. Awards in several categories are distributed annually by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences of the United States to &quot;honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position.&quot;

According to the category description guide for the 52nd Grammy Awards, the award was presented to artists that performed &quot;newly recorded solo R&amp;B vocal performances&quot;. Solo numbers by members of an established group were not eligible for the award as &quot;separate entries from the duo or group performances.&quot; Albums were also considered for the accolade until 1992.

As a part of the major overhaul of Grammy categories, the award was discontinued in 2011. The Female R&amp;B Vocal Performance category, Male R&amp;B Vocal Performance category and all duo/group vocal performances in the R&amp;B category shifted to the Best R&amp;B Performance category in 2012.

The award for the Best Female R&amp;B Vocal Performance was first presented to Aretha Franklin at the 10th Grammy Awards ceremony in 1968 for the song &quot;Respect&quot;. Franklin received the most wins with eleven, followed by Anita Baker with five. Franklin also holds the record for the most nominations with twenty-three, while Chaka Khan is second with eight nominations. Fantasia Barrino became the final recipient of the award, when her song &quot;Bittersweet&quot; won the award in 2011. The award was presented to artists from the United States each year.

<doc id="203308" wikidata="Q1142049" url="?curid=203308" title="North West Company">
<text>The North West Company was a fur trading business headquartered in Montreal from 1779 to 1821. It competed with increasing success against the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company in the regions that later became Western Canada and Northwestern Ontario. With great wealth at stake, tensions between the companies increased to the point where several minor armed skirmishes broke out, and the two companies were forced by the British government to merge.

==Before the Company==
After the French landed in Quebec in 1608, independent French-Canadian traders commonly known as spread out and built a fur trade empire in the St. Lawrence basin. The French competed with the Dutch (from 1614) and English (1664) in New York and the English in Hudson Bay (1670). Unlike the French who traveled into the northern interior and traded with First Nations in their camps and villages, the English made bases at trading posts on Hudson Bay, inviting the indigenous people to trade. After 1731, pushed trade west beyond Lake Winnipeg. After the British conquest of New France in 1763 (and the defeat of France in Europe), the management of the fur trading posts was taken over by English speakers. These so-called &quot;pedlars&quot; began to merge because competition cost them money and because of the high costs of outfitting canoes to the far west.

==Beginnings==
There are historical references to a North West Company as early as 1770, including the Montreal-based traders Benjamin Frobisher, Isaac Todd, Alexander Henry the elder and others, but the standard histories trace the company to a 16-share organization formed in 1779, which included Todd, Simon McTavish and James McGill. Seeking to break the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company monopoly over the North American fur trade, in 1780, the organization was joined by Peter Pond and Alexander Ellice, with his brothers, Robert and James, (and, later, his sons, including Edward Ellice).

In the winter of 1783–1784, the North West Company was officially created on a long-term basis, with its corporate offices on Vaudreuil Street in Montreal. It was led by businessmen Benjamin Frobisher, his brother, Joseph, and McTavish, along with investor-partners who included the Ellices, Robert Grant, Nicholas Montour, Patrick Small, William Holmes, and George McBeath.
==Official founding==
In 1787 the North West Company merged with a rival organization, Gregory, McLeod and Co., which brought several more able partners in, including John Gregory, Alexander Mackenzie, and his cousin Roderick Mackenzie. The 1787 company consisted of 20 shares, some held by the agents at Montreal (see below), and others by wintering partners, who spent the trading season in the fur country and oversaw the trade with the aboriginal peoples there.

The wintering partners and the Montreal agents met each July at the company&#x27;s depot at Grand Portage on Lake Superior, later moved to Fort William. Also under the auspices of the company, Alexander Mackenzie conducted two important expeditions of exploration. In 1789, he descended the Grand River (now called the Mackenzie River) to the Arctic Ocean, and in 1793 he went overland from Peace River to the Pacific Ocean. Further explorations were performed by David Thompson, starting in 1797, and later by Simon Fraser. These men pushed into the wilderness territories of the Rocky Mountains and Interior Plateau and all the way to the Strait of Georgia on the Pacific Coast.

==Frobisher–McTavish deal==
The death of Benjamin Frobisher opened the door to a takeover of the North West Company by Simon McTavish, who made a deal with Frobisher&#x27;s surviving brother Joseph. The firm of McTavish, Frobisher and Company, founded in November 1787, effectively controlled eleven of the company&#x27;s twenty outstanding shares. At the time the company consisted of 23 partners, but &quot;its staff of Agents, factors, clerks, guides, interpreters, more commonly known today as amounted to 2000 people.&quot; In addition to Alexander Mackenzie, this group included Americans Peter Pond and Alexander Henry the elder. Further reorganizations of the partnership occurred in 1795 and 1802, the shares being subdivided each time to provide for more and more wintering partners.

Vertical integration of the business was completed in 1792, when Simon McTavish and John Fraser formed a London house to supply trade goods and market the furs, McTavish, Fraser and Company. While the organization and capitalization of the North West Company came from Anglo-Quebecers, both Simon McTavish and Joseph Frobisher married French Canadians. Numerous French Canadians played key roles in the operations both in the building, management, and shareholding of the various trading posts scattered throughout the country, as well numbering among the involved in the actual trading with natives.

In the northwest, the Company expanded its operations as far north as Great Bear Lake, and westwards beyond the Rocky Mountains. For several years, they tried to sell furs directly to China, using American ships to avoid the British East India Company&#x27;s monopoly, but little profit was made there. The company also expanded into the United States&#x27; Northwest Territory (today&#x27;s Midwest of Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio and Wisconsin). In 1796, to better position themselves in the increasingly global market, where politics played a major role, the North West Company briefly established an agency in New York City.

Despite its efforts, the North West Company was at a distinct disadvantage in competing for furs with the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, whose charter gave it a virtual monopoly in Rupert&#x27;s Land, where the best furs were trapped. The company tried to persuade the British Parliament to change arrangements, at least so the North West Company could obtain transit rights to ship goods to the west needed for trading for furs. It is said that Simon McTavish made a personal petition to Prime Minister William Pitt, but all requests were refused.
A few years later, with no relief to the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company&#x27;s stranglehold, McTavish and his group decided to gamble. They organized an overland expedition from Montreal to James Bay and a second expedition by sea. In September 1803, the overland party met at Charlton Island, in what is now Nunavut Territory, the , a ship that Fraser acquired. At Charlton Island, they laid claim to the region inhabited by the Inuit, in the name of the North West Company, and were able to capitalize on the rich furs of the area. Their expansion northwestward cut into the profits of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company. In 1800, HBC profited £38,000 in trade compared to the North West Company&#x27;s £144,000 in 1800. This bold move caught the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company off guard. In succeeding years it retaliated rather than reaching a compromise, which McTavish had hoped might be negotiated.

==Late 18th/early 19th century==

Simon McTavish brought several members of his family into the company, but nepotism took a back seat to ability. His brother-in-law, Charles Chaboillez, oversaw the Lower Red River trading post. McTavish also hired several cousins and his nephews William McGillivray and Duncan McGillivray to learn the business. William McGillivray was groomed by his uncle to succeed him as Director of the North West Company, and by 1796 he had effectively done so, acting as Montreal agents&#x27; representative at the annual meetings at Grand Portage, and later at Fort William.

Simon McTavish was an aggressive businessman who understood that powerful forces in the business world were always ready to pounce on any weakness. As such, his ambition and forceful positions caused disagreements between him and some of the shareholders, several of whom eventually left the North West Company during the 1790s. Some of these dissidents formed their own company, known unofficially as the XY Company, allegedly because of the mark they used on their bales of furs. Their cause was greatly strengthened in 1799, when the North West Company&#x27;s hero explorer, Alexander Mackenzie, quit his old partnership and soon after joined them.

There was intense competition between the rivals. When Simon McTavish died on 6 July 1804, the new head William McGillivray set out to put an end to the four years&#x27; rivalry. It had escalated to a point where the master of the North West Company post at Great Bear Lake had been shot by an XY Company employee during a quarrel. McGillivray was successful in putting together an agreement with the XY Company in 1804. It stipulated that the old North West Company partners held 75 per cent of the shares, and the former XY Company partners the remaining 25 per cent. Alexander Mackenzie was excluded from the new joint partnership.

Under William McGillivray, the Company continued to expand, and apparently to profit, during the first decade of the 19th century. Competition with the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company was intense, however, and profit margins were squeezed. The North West Company branch in New York City had allowed the Canadians to get around the British East India Company&#x27;s monopoly and ship furs to the Chinese market. Cargo ships owned by the North West Company conveniently sailed under the American flag, and doing so meant continued collaboration with John Jacob Astor.

However, Astor was as aggressive as Simon McTavish had been. An intense rivalry soon developed between him and William McGillivray over the Oriental market and westerly expansion to unclaimed territory in what is now the Columbia River basin, in the present-day states of Washington and Oregon. Astor&#x27;s Pacific Fur Company beat the North West Company in an effort to found a post near the mouth of the Columbia, Fort Astoria. A collapse in the sea otter population and the imminent possibility of British seizure of Astoria during the War of 1812 led to its sale to the North West Company in 1813. When HMS &quot;Racoon&quot; and its Captain Black arrived, he went through a ceremony of possession, even though the fort was already ostensibly under British control. Due to treaty complications of the Treaty of Ghent requiring the return of seized assets, putative ownership of the site was returned to the United States in 1817. Renamed as Fort George by the North West Company, continued to operate until the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company&#x27;s takeover and the replacement of Fort Astoria by Fort Vancouver.

The Canadian fur trade began to change in 1806, after Napoleon Bonaparte ordered the blockade of the Baltic Sea as part of the ongoing struggle between France and Britain for world dominance. Britain was dependent for almost all of her timber on the Baltic countries and on the U.S. states of New Hampshire and Massachusetts (which at that time included the large territory of Maine). By then, however, tensions had also begun to escalate again between Britain and the United States.

In 1809 the American Government passed the Non-Intercourse Act, which effectively brought about an almost complete cessation of trade between the two countries. Britain became totally dependent on her Canadian colony for her timber needs, especially the great white pine used for ships&#x27; masts. Almost overnight, timber and wood products replaced fur as Canada&#x27;s number one export. Fur remained profitable, however, as it had a high value-to-bulk ratio. In an economy short of ready money, fur was routinely used by Canadian merchants to remit value to their London creditors.

==Forced merger==
By 1810, another crisis hit the fur industry, brought on by the over-harvesting of animals, the North American beaver in particular. The destruction of the North West Company post at Sault Ste. Marie by the Americans during the War of 1812 was a serious blow during an already difficult time. In addition, the company was hurt by the refusal after the war with the United States to let Canadian traders freely cross its northern border. This reduced much of the border trade, which had previously been profitable for them, and artificially divided traders&#x27; relations with those several Native American tribes whose territories spanned the border.

All these events intensified competition between the companies. When Thomas Douglas convinced his fellow shareholders in the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company to grant him the Selkirk Concession, it marked another in a series of events that would lead to the demise of the North West Company. The Pemmican Proclamation, the ensuing Battle of Seven Oaks in 1816, and its violence, resulted in Lord Selkirk arresting William McGillivray and several North West Company proprietors. He ordered the seizure of their outpost property in Fort William and charged them with the deaths of 21 people at Seven Oaks. Although this matter was resolved by the authorities in Montreal, over the next few years some of the wealthiest and most capable partners began to leave the North West Company, fearful of its future viability. The form of nepotism within the company too had changed, from the strict values of Simon McTavish to something that was harming the business in both its costs and morale of others.

By 1820, the company was issuing coinage, each copper token representing the value of one beaver pelt. But the continued operations of the North West Company were in great doubt, and shareholders had no choice but to agree to a merger with their hated rival after Henry Bathurst, the Secretary of State for War and the Colonies, ordered the companies to cease hostilities. In July 1821, under more pressure from the British government, which passed new regulations governing the fur trade in British North America, a merger agreement was signed with the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company. By this, the North West Company name disappeared after more than 40 years of operations. At the time of the merger, the amalgamated company consisted of 97 trading posts that had belonged to the North West Company and 76 that belonged to the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company. When the competition between both companies came to an end, new board of directors wanted two field governors to oversee the newly defined territory, and George Simpson was appointed to the Northern Department. George Simpson (1787–1860), the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company Governor-in-Chief of Rupert&#x27;s Land, who became the Canadian head of the northern division of the greatly enlarged business, made his headquarters in the Montreal suburb of Lachine. The trading posts were soon reduced in number to avoid redundancy.

==Social and ethnic structure==
The masters or the of the North West Company were most often of Scottish descent, whether born in Canada or Scotland, and brought capital to the enterprise. Over time, many were related, since sons and nephews were recruited. The servants or were most often , mostly peasants&#x27; sons from the countryside around Montréal. Many Métis sons followed in their fathers&#x27; footstep, whether as or . Through descent and education, the laid claim to the status of gentlemen, while the did the physical labour.

===Bourgeois===
The or masters of the North West Company belonged to three different levels, depending on the role performed in the company.

Montreal merchants, or were owners of trading companies and shareholders in the North West Company. They were responsible for hiring staff, exporting furs, acquiring supplies, merchandise and provisions, and organizing their shipment to the inland trading posts. For this, they received commissions, in addition to the profits they made as shareholders.

Wintering partners or were also shareholders in the company, owning one or two shares each. They were not salaried, but received their income from the company&#x27;s profits through their shares. Trading goods were advanced to them on credit by the agents of Montreal. They wintered in the interior, managing a district with several trading posts, and were in charge of the actual trade with the Indians. During the summer, the agents and the associates met at Fort William. The wintering partners normally began their career path as clerks.

The clerks or were salaried employees. They began their career as apprentices serving five to seven years, before advancing to clerks and bookkeepers. Each hoped to become a shareholding partner, although many remained clerks.
The or servants did not constitute a uniform group with equal status. The lowest level of the status pyramid was formed by the , who paddled between Montreal and the posts around the Great Lakes. Seasonally employed, they were known by their diet and referred to as (&#x27;pork-eaters&#x27;). , or wintering servants, who paddled canoes from the Great Lakes to the interior trading posts, and worked at them during the winter, formed the next higher band of employees. Status and pay differed depending on a man&#x27;s role in the canoe. The or middleman was the drudge of canoe travel, while the responsibilities of the bowsman or and the steersman or were rewarded with up to five times as high pay as a common middleman, especially if serving as leader of a brigade of canoes. Interpreters and guides could earn up to three times as much as a middleman.

===Social dynamics===
The social dynamics of the company was rooted in kinship and descent or ethnic origin. The company was formed by a closed network of persons of Scots descent related through blood or marriage. Several important Montreal agents were related to Simon McTavish; and his successors, brothers William and Duncan McGillivray, were his nephews. Of 128 leading figures in the company, 77 were of Scots descent. Due to the prevalent kinship structures, it was all but impossible for unrelated men to advance from to .

==Organizational history==
The history of the partnership is complex, but it is necessary to keep track of who was competing with whom. Note that the definition of partner is not completely clear. For example, after Duncan McDougall surrendered Fort Astoria, he became a NWC partner with one one-hundredth of a share.
* 1771: William Grant and several others form a partnership which they call the &quot;N. W. Société&quot;
* 1775: Alexander Henry the elder speaks of a pool on the North Saskatchewan similar to 1779 (see Fort Sturgeon).
* 1779: Of 16 shares: 2 shares: Todd &amp; McGill, B &amp; J Frobisher, McGill &amp; Patterson, McTavish &amp; Co, Holmes &amp; Grant, Wadden &amp; Co, McBeath &amp; Co; 1 share: Ross &amp; Co, Oakes &amp; Co. The first three were large and closely connected. Peter Pond was a partner of McBeath and Patrick Small of McTavish.
* 1784: McGill &amp; Todd secede. Of 16 shares: 3 shares: Simon McTavish, B &amp; J Frobisher; 2 shares: George McBeath, Robert Grant, Nicholas Montour, Patrick Small; 1 share: Peter Pond, William Holmes. The agreement was made in January and confirmed that summer when the winterers arrived at Grand Portage for the first meeting.
* 1787: McTavish buys 1 of McBeath&#x27;s 2 shares. Gregory &amp; McLeod join. Of 20 Shares: 4 shares: McTavish; 3 shares: Joseph Frobisher; 2 shares: Patrick Small, Nicholas Montour, Robert Grant; 1 share: McBeath, Peter Pond, Holms; former Gregory &amp; McLeod members with 1 share each: John Gregory, Norman McLeod, Peter Pangman, Alexander MacKenzie.
* 1788: Merger creates McTavish, Frobisher &amp; Co which controls half of the NWC.
* 1790: Of 20 shares: 6 shares: McTavish &amp; Frobisher: 2 shares: Montour, Robert Grant, Patrick Small, John Gregory, Peter Pangman, Alexander MacKenzie; 1 share: McTavish&#x27;s nephew and Donald Sutherland.
* 1792: Now 46 shares. 20 Shares: McTavish, Frobisher &amp;Co (with new partner John Gregory), 6 Shares: Alexander MacKenzie, 2 Shares: Todd, McGill &amp; Co, Forsyth, Richardson &amp; Co, Montour, Sutherland, Angus Shaw, 1 Share: Alexander Henry the elder &amp; Alexander Henry the younger, Grant, Campion &amp; Co, Robert and Cuthbert Grant, Roderick McKenzie and others.
* 1796: Frobisher retires.
* 1802: 6 shares added to be distributed to clerks.
* 1804: McTavish dies, replaced by William McGillivray. Merger with XY Company.
* 1806: McTavish, Frobisher &amp; Co becomes McTavish, McGillivrays &amp; Co
* 1821: Merged with Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company. Former NWC owners have half the capital but little power.

XY Company or formally the New North West Company, and sometimes Alexander MacKenzie &amp; Co. In 1798 Forsyth, Richardson &amp; Co, Parker, Gerrand &amp; Ogilvy and John Mure of Quebec formed the XY Company. In 1799 MacKenzie left the NWC and went to England. Next year he bought shares in XY and soon became the effective head of the firm. Alexander Henry the younger was an XY winterer. They built a number of posts close to NWC and HBC posts. The murder of an HBC man by an XY man at Fort de l&#x27;Isle led to the Canada Jurisdiction Act which extended Quebec law to western Canada. In 1804 it merged with the NWC, having 25% interest in the combined company.

The South West Company: was an 1811 attempted partnership between two North West Company firms (McTavish, McGillivrays &amp; Co and Forsyth, Richardson &amp; Co) and John Jacob Astor to import goods through New York and deal with the Great Lakes trade. It was mostly blocked by the War of 1812 but remnants existed until at least 1820. Astor had been dealing with the NWC since around 1787.

McTavish, Fraser &amp; Co. was the London agent of Simon McTavish, from about 1790. John Fraser was his cousin. Simon McGillivray worked there and became a partner in 1805. Edward Ellice, a man of great influence, was involved.

Todd &amp; McGill was formed in 1776, was in the NWC by 1779, separated in 1784 and rejoined in 1792. They apparently wanted to concentrate on the southern Great Lakes.

Gregory &amp; McLeod joined in 1787. They employed Alexander Mackenzie, Peter Pangman and John Ross.

==Revival==
In 1987, the northern trading posts of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company were sold to an employee consortium that revived the name The North West Company in 1990. The new company is a grocery and merchandise store chain based in Winnipeg, with stores in Northern Canada, Alaska, US Pacific territories and the Caribbean. Its headquarters are across the street from the Forts Rouge, Garry, and Gibraltar National Historic Site of Canada, the site of an old North West Company fort.

<text>Richard Edmund Williams ( Lane; March 19, 1933 – August 16, 2019) was a Canadian-British animator, voice actor, and painter. A three-time Academy Award winner, he is best known as the animation director on &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot; (1988) -- for which he won two Academy Awards—and as the director of his unfinished feature film &quot;The Thief and the Cobbler&quot; (1993). His work on the short film &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; (1971) earned him his first Academy Award. He was also a film title sequence designer and animator. Other works in this field include the title sequences for &quot;What&#x27;s New Pussycat?&quot; (1965) and &quot;A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum&quot; (1966), title and linking sequences in &quot;The Charge of the Light Brigade&quot;, and the intros of the eponymous cartoon feline for two of the later &quot;Pink Panther&quot; films. In 2002 he published &quot;The Animator&#x27;s Survival Kit&quot;, an authoritative manual of animation methods and techniques, which has since been turned into a 16-DVD box set as well as an iOS app. From 2008 he worked as artist in residence at Aardman Animations in Bristol, and in 2015 he received both Oscar and BAFTA nominations in the best animated short category for his short film &quot;Prologue&quot;.

== Early life==
Williams was born as Richard Edmund Lane in Toronto, Ontario, the only son of the commercial illustrator Kathleen &quot;Kay&quot; Bell (1909–1998) and Leslie Lane (1905–1993), a London-born painter and photographic retoucher. Lane left when Williams was a baby, and he was adopted by his stepfather, Kenneth D. C. Williams (1910–2003), an advertising executive who worked for Brigdens, a printing and design company in Toronto.

Williams grew up on Golfdale Road, a suburban street in Toronto, where he and his childhood friend Martin Hunter put on magic shows and comedy acts for the local neighbourhood: &quot;We collected $16.25, wealth beyond the dreams of avarice&quot;. Williams&#x27; mother Kay was an accomplished illustrator whose work was inspired by Arthur Rackham and Edmund Dulac. Kay read her son the stories of the Arabian Nights, which would later inspire his magnum opus &quot;The Thief and the Cobbler&quot;. &quot;Kay introduced us to &quot;The Thief of Baghdad&quot; with its flying carpets, magical horses and wicked viziers&quot;. At the age of five, Kay took her son to see &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; (1937), a film which made a &quot;tremendous impression&quot; on him. Later he would quote his mother as saying to him, &quot;You saw ‘Snow White’ when you were 5, and you were never the same.&quot;

Williams was educated at the Northern Secondary School, Toronto, then known as the Northern Technical School. One of his classmates, Lars Thompson, recalled: &quot;Under the name of Ivan Yurpee, [Dick] played a trumpet in a band of fellow zanies. In class, he would sketch our teachers with an animator&#x27;s sure touch, and without detection&quot;.

At age 15, Williams travelled to Hollywood from Toronto on a five-day bus trip, where he took the Disney studio tour three days running, each day breaking away from the guide to seek out the studio animators and being ejected from the studio lot. He was finally invited to meet the animators, who showed him how the Disney animation process worked, after his mother contacted a friend who worked for Disney. &quot;I always wanted, when I was a kid, to get to Disney. I was a clever little fellow so I took my drawings and I eventually got in. They did a story on me, and I was in there for two days, which you can imagine what it was like for a kid.&quot;

With help from his stepfather, Williams was already earning a living as a commercial artist at age 17, creating advertisements for companies such as Dr. Ballard&#x27;s Pet Food. After graduating from high school, Williams enrolled in the advertising program at the Ontario College of Art. He did not receive a diploma, however, as he changed his course of study to join the fine arts program after his third year.

==Career==
===1950s: Ibiza, London and &quot;The Little Island&quot;===

In 1953, Williams saw an exhibition of paintings by Rembrandt and was &quot;moved to tears&quot;. For a time, he &quot;lost all interest in animation&quot;. He left Canada and settled in Ibiza, where he lived for two years and became a painter, finding inspiration in the clowns and performers at a local circus. These sketches would eventually become the short film &quot;Circus Drawings&quot;, completed over 50 years later, in 2010. While in Ibiza, Williams played in a jazz band; his passion for the cornet would be an enduring one, and he would lead several bands over the years, inspired by the music of Bix Beiderbecke.

In Ibiza, Williams began to draw storyboards for an animated film about three misguided idealists. In 1955, Williams left Ibiza and moved to England, where he began working at fellow Canadian George Dunning&#x27;s company, T.V. Cartoons Ltd., working mainly on television commercials. He also began developing his animated short film, &quot;The Little Island,&quot; during this period. Williams later explained that he was drawn back to the craft of animation because his &quot;paintings were trying to move&quot; and he &quot;couldn&#x27;t stand the idea of doing paintings for rich industrialists’ wives, and that whole art world was just repulsive as a way of life&quot;.

In the 1983 Thames Television documentary &quot;The Thief Who Never Gave Up&quot;, Williams credited animator Bob Godfrey with giving him his start in the business: &quot;Bob Godfrey helped me...I worked in the basement and would do work in kind, and he would let me use the camera...[it was] a barter system&quot;.

In the mid-1950s, fellow Canadian Jacques Konig was studying at the University of London: &quot;Dick did not play his cornet and lead his band just for the love of music, it was a significant and necessary contribution to his income. In my role as student president of the University of London&#x27;s Chelsea College and Chelsea Arts School (1956–57), I booked his hard-driving traditional jazz band for many of our events, and we knew all his available cash was being used to finance his hand-drawn and highly imaginative short film&quot;.

In 1958, Williams completed &quot;The Little Island&quot;, the film that launched his career, telling the story of three men on a desert island; each representing a single virtue: truth, beauty, and good. The film won the 1958 BAFTA Award for Best Animated Film.

===1960s: Richard Williams Animation, film titles, and commercials===
The critical and financial success of Williams&#x27;s next short, &quot;Love Me, Love Me, Love Me&quot; (1962), which was narrated by Kenneth Williams, enabled him to establish his own company, Richard Williams Animation Ltd. He made the short film &quot;A Lecture on Man&quot; that same year. Richard Williams Animation Ltd. eventually completed over 2,500 TV commercials, and won numerous awards, at its home at 13 Soho Square in Soho, London.

In 1965, he made the short film &quot;The Dermis Probe&quot;, and also animated the title sequences to &quot;What&#x27;s New Pussycat?&quot; (1965). In 1966, he animated the titles for &quot;A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum&quot;. Also in 1966 a television documentary, &quot;The Creative Person&quot;, was made about his life and work. In 1967, he completed the short film &quot;Sailor and the Devil&quot;, mainly animated by the illustrator Errol Le Cain, and also animated the title sequence for &quot;Casino Royale&quot;.

In 1968 his studio won accolades for the animated segments in Tony Richardson&#x27;s epic feature film about the Crimean War, &quot;The Charge of the Light Brigade&quot; (1968), which Williams described as &quot;the best job I ever had&quot;. Film critic Vincent Canby described Williams&#x27; work as “marvellous animated line drawings, done in the style of patriotic mid-19th-century cartoons&quot;.

In the mid-1960s, Williams began work on the personal project that he intended to be “the best animated feature ever”, based on the tales of Mulla Nasrudin, and initially titled &quot;Nasrudin&quot;. The project evolved over time and in 1973 he would settle on a new story and title, &quot;The Thief and the Cobbler&quot;.

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Williams hired and brought to London a number of the great Hollywood animators from the 1930s, elderly men who were by then nearing retirement. These included Art Babbitt (Goofy), Grim Natwick (Betty Boop), and Ken Harris (Wile E. Coyote). Babbitt, in particular, gave masterclasses at Williams&#x27; studio at 13 Soho Square, training a new generation of animators.

Following the 1967 release of Disney&#x27;s &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;, Williams first met master animator Milt Kahl, with whom he would become friends. Kahl had animated Shere Khan, the tiger, and Williams knelt down to polish his shoes. But Kahl said to him: “You can stop cleaning my shoes because you draw better than I do; but then you can clean them some more because you can&#x27;t animate.”

TV commercials provided Richard Williams Animation with its main source of income. Although Williams despised the form, director Clive Donner persuaded him to raise his game. Following a successful commercial for Guinness beer, set in London&#x27;s Royal Albert Hall, which won multiple awards, William&#x27;s studio became well known for commercials, bringing characters such as Cresta Bear to life.

===1970s: &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; and &quot;The Pink Panther&quot;===
In 1971, Williams directed the Academy Award-winning &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;, an animated adaptation of Charles Dickens&#x27;s 1843 novella. The design of the film was based upon the original 1843 engravings. &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; was broadcast on U.S. television by ABC on December 21, 1971, and released theatrically soon after. In 1972, it won the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film.

In around 1973, Williams fell out with his business partners over the feature film &quot;Nasruddin&quot;, and began to re-imagine the story, which soon morphed into a new tale about a mute thief who is obsessed with stealing three golden balls which protect an ancient city from invasion. Williams animated many of the scenes himself, and spent years perfecting a single scene in which the villainous vizier ZigZag shuffles a deck of cards.

In 1975, Williams animated the title credits for Blake Edwards&#x27; &quot;The Return of the Pink Panther&quot;, and in 1976 his studio completed the animated credits for &quot;The Pink Panther Strikes Again&quot;. Art Babbitt, who was working for Williams at the time, described his employer&#x27;s talent: &quot;He&#x27;s a director, designer, animator, and has a good layman&#x27;s knowledge of music. He&#x27;s a dreamer. He has more to learn as far as animation is concerned, but God, he can draw like a bastard&quot;.

In 1976, Williams did the illustrations for Idries Shah&#x27;s English translation of the stories of Nasrudin, titled &quot;The Exploits of the Incomparable Mullah Nasruddin&quot;.

In 1977, Williams directed the full-length animated feature film &quot;Raggedy Ann &amp; Andy: A Musical Adventure&quot; (1977), in which his daughter Claire played the part of Marcella.

===1980s: &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;===

In 1982, Williams directed &quot;Ziggy&#x27;s Gift&quot;, a television special in which Ziggy takes a job as a sidewalk Santa. The film won an Emmy Award, and in the same year he appeared in a Thames Television documentary titled &quot;Richard Williams and The Thief Who Never Gave Up&quot;.

In 1987, Williams embarked on his biggest project to date, becoming animation director on the Disney/Spielberg film &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot; (1988). Williams was initially reluctant to work on the film: when pitched the idea, Williams said to executive producer Steven Spielberg and director Robert Zemeckis &quot;I just hate animation and live-action together; it just doesn&#x27;t work, it&#x27;s ugly&quot;. As he did not want to move to Los Angeles, production was moved to London.

Disney and Spielberg promised Williams that in return for doing the film, they would help finance and distribute the still-unfinished &quot;The Thief and the Cobbler&quot;. Williams designed the characters for the film, including Jessica Rabbit. He said of Jessica that she was &quot;the ultimate male fantasy, drawn by a cartoonist. I tried to make her like Rita Hayworth; we took her hair from Veronica Lake, and Zemeckis kept saying, &#x27;What about the look Lauren Bacall had?&#x27;&quot; Blessed with tremendous energy, Williams barely slept and worked through multiple nights to get the animation finished on time.

In 1988, another documentary was released about Williams, titled &quot;I Drew Roger Rabbit&quot;. In 1989, following the success of &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;, Williams won two more Academy Awards for his work, a joint award for Best Special Effects, shared with Ken Ralston, Ed Jones and George Gibbs and a Special Achievement Award. Williams said &quot;I&#x27;m (in) the same business as Goya and Rembrandt. I may be rotten at it with nothing of the same quality or talent, but that&#x27;s my business&quot;.

Apart from animation, Williams&#x27;s great passion was Dixieland jazz. He led an ensemble in London named &quot;Dix Six&quot; that played regular gigs at venues such as the PizzaExpress Jazz Club, The 100 Club, and the Britannia Hotel in Grosvenor Square.

===1990s: &quot;The Thief and the Cobbler&quot;===

Richard Williams&#x27; magnum opus, a painstakingly hand-animated epic inspired by the Arabian Nights and with the production title &quot;The Thief and the Cobbler&quot;, was begun in 1964 and was initially self-funded. As a largely non-verbal feature meant for an adult audience, &quot;The Thief&quot; was dismissed at first as unmarketable. After over twenty years of work, Williams had completed only twenty minutes of the film, and following the critical success of &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;, Williams sought and secured a production deal with Warner Bros. in 1988. However, the production went over deadline, and in 1992, with only 15 minutes of footage left to complete, The Completion Bond Company, who had insured Warners&#x27; financing of the film, feared competition from the similarly themed Disney film &quot;Aladdin,&quot; which was scheduled to open on the same day, and seized the project from Williams in Camden, London.

Completion Bond then had animator Fred Calvert supervise the animation process in Korea. New scenes were also animated to include several musical interludes. Calvert&#x27;s version was released in South Africa and Australia in 1993 as &quot;The Princess and the Cobbler&quot;. Miramax (which was owned by Disney at the time) then acquired rights to the project and extensively rewrote and re-edited the film to include continuous dialogue, as well as many cuts to lengthy sequences. Miramax&#x27;s product was released in North America in 1995 under the title &quot;Arabian Knight&quot;. For a long time, Williams preferred not to discuss the film in detail.

Following the collapse of &quot;The Thief&quot;, Williams closed his company and left the UK for his native Canada, moving with his wife Imogen and their two children to a house in Fulford Harbour on Salt Spring Island, British Columbia, where the family lived for five years. To earn a living, Williams began to host animation masterclasses, in which he combined his skill as an animator with his talent on the stage, performing around 30 events around the world.

In 1992, Williams was awarded an honorary doctorate by the Royal College of Art. In 1997 Williams moved back to the UK, living first in Pembrokeshire and later moving to Bristol, where he would remain until the end of his life.

===2000s–2010s: &quot;The Animator&#x27;s Survival Kit&quot; and &quot;Prologue&quot;===

The notes for Williams&#x27; masterclass formed the basis for a book on the art of animation and, in 2002, Faber &amp; Faber published Williams&#x27; acclaimed animation how-to book, &quot;The Animator&#x27;s Survival Kit&quot;, with an &quot;expanded edition&quot; following in 2009. The book soon became a key reference for animators, both in print and later on as a DVD box set and an iPad application. The historian Kevin Brownlow described the &quot;ASK&quot; as “utterly riveting, even to a layman.”

From 2008, Williams began to work as artist in residence at Aardman Animations in Bristol, where he worked at one of his original 1938 Disney animation desks. Aardman co-founder Peter Lord described Williams as exemplifying &quot;pure creativity, he seemed to us to work without compromise and for the sheer love of his chosen art-form. No deadlines, except the ones he set himself, nobody to please or answer to, except himself. [He was] our special guest, our resident celebrity&quot;. Even in his 80s, Williams continued to work every day, and do a full day&#x27;s work. He liked to enter his office at Aardman by the fire escape &quot;just to avoid people&quot;.

In 2010, Williams completed his 9-minute short film titled &quot;Circus Drawings&quot;, first begun in Ibiza in the early 1950s. The silent film, with live accompaniment, premiered at the Pordenone Silent Film Festival in Italy in September 2010.

On December 10, 2013, the director&#x27;s cut of &quot;The Thief and the Cobbler&quot;, a workprint of the film, subtitled &quot;A Moment in Time&quot;, was screened in Los Angeles. Williams participated in the event. However, a final, finished version of the film as Williams had long envisioned would never be completed.

In 2015, his short film &quot;Prologue&quot; received both an Oscar nomination and a BAFTA nomination in the category of best animated short. &quot;Prologue&quot; was the first six minutes of his hand-drawn feature film &quot;Lysistrata&quot;, based on the ancient Greek comedy by Aristophanes, which Williams joked should be sub-titled &quot;Will I Live to Finish It?&quot;. Williams described &quot;Prologue&quot; as &quot;the only thing so far in my career that I’ve ever really been pleased with.&quot; In 2013 Williams told &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;All I need is some time and five or six assistants who can draw like hell.&quot; The film was intended to be &quot;grim but funny and salacious and sexy&quot;. Like his version of &quot;The Thief and the Cobbler&quot;, &quot;Prologue&quot; would never be completed. But, as Williams put it: &quot;it&#x27;s the doing of it that matters. Do it for the love of it. That&#x27;s all there is&quot;.

==Personal life==
Williams married four times. His marriage to Stephanie &quot;Tep&quot; Ashforth in the early 1950s was short-lived; she was reluctant to move to London with him, choosing to remain in Ibiza. In London he met his second wife, Lois Catherine Steuart, daughter of the U.S. diplomat George Hume Steuart; they were married in 1966, and had two children, Alexander Williams, born in 1967, and Claire Williams, born in 1969. Divorce followed in 1976.

In 1976 he married a third time, to Margaret French, from Missouri, with whom he had two more children: Timothy Williams, born in 1976, and Holly Williams, born in 1978.

Toward the end of his life, he lived in Bristol with his fourth wife, Imogen Sutton, with whom he had two more children, Natasha Sutton-Williams and Leif Sutton-Williams.

==Death==
Williams died of cancer on August 16, 2019, at his home in Bristol, England, still creating until the very end.
