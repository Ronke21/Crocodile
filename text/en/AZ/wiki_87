==Production==
Harve Presnell was the sole member of the original Broadway cast who was invited to reprise his stage role in the film. Although Tammy Grimes had originated the title role and had won the Tony Award for her performance, MGM executives wanted Shirley MacLaine for the film. After she signed, producer Hal Wallis claimed she was under contract to him, and MacLaine was forced to withdraw from the project. After this, many people wanted Judy Garland. Garland was reported to be the star of the film in 1961. When Debbie Reynolds was cast instead, MacLaine publicly accused her of agreeing to accept a lower salary in order to land the role, and director Charles Walters, who preferred MacLaine, tried to persuade Reynolds to turn down the part.

Exteriors were filmed in the Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park in western Colorado. Some brief black-and-white footage from the 1953 movie &quot;Titanic&quot; and 1958 movie &quot;A Night to Remember&quot;, portraying the ill-fated ocean liner&#x27;s collision with an iceberg and sinking, was interspersed with scenes of Molly Brown aboard the ship and later in a lifeboat.

Only five of the 17 musical numbers from the stage musical were used in the film, and Meredith Willson wrote &quot;He&#x27;s My Friend&quot; to extend the song score. Peter Gennaro, who had choreographed the original Broadway production, staged the musical sequences.

During production, MGM was putting all its resources into its forthcoming &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot; (1965), and at least $1 million was cut from the budget of &quot;Molly Brown&quot;. Running out of money to complete the film, director Charles Walters proposed cutting the rousing dance number &quot;He&#x27;s My Friend&quot;. To save the number, cast and crew ultimately decided to film it in one rigorous day using multiple cameras to reduce shooting time.

The film grossed $11,070,559 at the domestic box office. It earned $7.5 million in U.S. theatrical rentals.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
A.H. Weiler of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the film &quot;big, brassy, bold and freewheeling&quot; but added, &quot;The tones are ringing, but often hollow. Molly is a colorful character all right, and the screen, which is as wide as can be, is filled with vivid colors that help project the fact that this is merely a satisfying musical comedy and not an inspired subject.&quot; He continued, &quot;This is not to say that Meredith Willson&#x27;s score is not tuneful and lilting but to this listener it is good, sweet corn that is more palatable than memorable. Mr. Gennaro, on the other hand, has devised dances that more than complement Mr. Willson&#x27;s music. They may seem to be improvised but they have the true marks of professionalism in their carefully plotted verve, bounce and exuberance.&quot; He concluded, &quot;&quot;The Unsinkable Molly Brown&quot;, in the person of Miss Reynolds, and the other principals, often mistakes vigor for art. But Metro&#x27;s lavish and attractive production numbers make up for this basic superficiality. For all of its shallowness, &quot;Molly&quot; is a cheerful and entertaining addition to the local screen scene.&quot;

&quot;Variety&quot; observed, &quot;In essence, it&#x27;s a pretty shallow story since the title character, when you get right down to it, is obsessed with a very superficial, egotistical problem beneath her generous, razzmatazz facade. On top of that, Willson&#x27;s score is rather undistinguished. Debbie Reynolds thrusts herself into the role with an enormous amount of verve and vigor. At times her approach to the character seems more athletic than artful. Harve Presnell ... makes a generally auspicious screen debut as the patient Johnny. His fine, booming voice and physical stature make him a valuable commodity for Hollywood.&quot;

Channel 4 called it an &quot;amiable comedy with a handful of good tunes&quot; that &quot;lacks the satirical bite which its story may suggest. Sometimes the director seems to feel more at ease with the melodramatic moments than the comedy ones.&quot;

&quot;Time Out London&quot; noted, &quot;As ebulliently energetic as ever, Reynolds makes the brash social climbing both funny and touching, but the film itself gets trapped in two minds between satire and sentimentality. The score ... though pleasant, is rather thinly spread; but the sets are a delight in the best traditions of the MGM musical, and Walters does a wonderfully graceful job of direction&quot;.

&quot;TV Guide&quot; rated the film three out of four stars and commented, &quot;A rambunctious and spirited effort from Reynolds ... saves this otherwise weakly scripted, familiar musical from the long list of forgotten pictures.&quot;

===Box office===
The film set an opening week record at Radio City Music Hall in New York City, grossing $222,000 and became the number one film in the US that week. It went on to be the highest grossing film at the theater, with a 10-week gross of $2 million.

===Awards and nominations===
==Home media==
Warner Home Video released the Region 1 DVD on September 19, 2000. The film is in anamorphic widescreen format with an audio track in English and subtitles in English and French. In 2016, Warner Archive released the film on Blu Ray.

<text>The Banana Splits is an American children&#x27;s television variety show produced by Hanna-Barbera Productions and featuring the Banana Splits, a fictional rock band composed of four costumed animal characters in red helmets with yellow crests. The costumed hosts are Fleegle (guitar, vocals), Bingo (drums, vocals), Drooper (bass, vocals), and Snorky (keyboards, effects).

The series ran for 31 episodes on NBC on Saturday mornings from September 7, 1968, to September 5, 1970, and in syndication from 1970 to 1982. The show features the Banana Splits band as live-action costumed characters, who host both live-action and animated segments within their program. The costumes were constructed by Sid and Marty Krofft based on designs by Hanna-Barbera artists, and the series&#x27; sponsor was Kellogg&#x27;s Cereals.

A feature-length comedy horror film adaptation, &quot;The Banana Splits Movie&quot;, premiered at San Diego Comic-Con on July 18, 2019, and was released worldwide on August 13, 2019.

==History==
In 1967, William Hanna and Joseph Barbera approached Sid and Marty Krofft to build the costumes for a television show featuring animated and live-action segments, hosted by a bubblegum rock group of anthropomorphic animals. The show&#x27;s format of fast-paced blackout gags was loosely based on &quot;Rowan &amp; Martin&#x27;s Laugh-In&quot;, so much so that Barbera and Hanna hired that show&#x27;s head writers, Phil Hahn and Jack Hanrahan. (The Banana Splits later appeared as guests on &quot;Laugh-In&quot; on November 18, 1968.) 

&quot;The Banana Splits Adventure Hour&quot; premiered on NBC on September 7, 1968. In his autobiography, Barbera said that the show was originally going to be called &quot;The Banana Bunch&quot;, but permission could not be obtained from the author of a children&#x27;s book by that same title.

The Krofft brothers credit the series&#x27; success for making possible their own entry into television, &quot;H.R. Pufnstuf&quot;. NBC picked up the Krofft series, which was launched on August 30, 1969, during an hour-long special hosted by the Banana Splits.

The show&#x27;s live-action segment &quot;Danger Island&quot;, a cliffhanger serial, as well as the short-lived &quot;Micro Ventures&quot;, a part-live action, part-animated series consisting of only four episodes, ran alongside the animated segments &quot;Arabian Knights&quot; and &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot;. Actors Jan-Michael Vincent (billed as Michael Vincent) and Ronne Troup appeared in the live-action component &quot;Danger Island&quot;. All the live-action material filmed for the series&#x27; first season, including the &quot;Banana Splits&quot; and &quot;Danger Island&quot; segments, was directed by Richard Donner.

Jason Ankeny of AllMusic has blamed the show&#x27;s drastic ratings drop during its second season on the production staff&#x27;s failure to change backgrounds or set designs, which misled young viewers into thinking that they were watching reruns instead of new episodes.

==Synopsis==
Each show represented a meeting of the Banana Splits Club, and the wraparounds featured the adventures of the club members, a musical quartet meant to be reminiscent of the Monkees.

The Splits&#x27; segments, including songs of the week and comedy skits, served as wraparounds for a number of individual segments.

For the first season, some of the live-action segments—specifically those used during the musical segments—were shot at Six Flags Over Texas, an amusement park in Arlington, Texas. For the second season, filming took place at the Coney Island amusement park in Cincinnati, Ohio. In many episodes, the Banana Splits were seen riding the many rides at Six Flags and Coney Island.

The Banana Buggies, mentioned in the theme song, were customized vehicles driven by each live-action character. The buggies were customized Amphicat six-wheel drive all-terrain vehicles, each decorated to resemble the character who drove it. Plastic 1/25 scale model kits were issued by Aurora Plastics Corporation (catalog number 832) beginning in 1969. They were never reissued by Aurora, but have since been released as high-end resin-based kits.

&quot;The Banana Splits&quot; was one of the first two Hanna-Barbera series in 1968 for which Hanna and Barbera received executive producer credits, the other being &quot;The New Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&quot;; Edward Rosen was the producer on both series. It was also one of the first Saturday morning shows to use a laugh track, but only during the live-action comedy segments. In its first year, the cartoons were adventure-based and did not have laugh tracks (the first Saturday-morning cartoon with a laugh track was Filmation&#x27;s &quot;The Archie Show&quot;).

==Characters==
===Main===
* Fleegle – A beagle with a lisp and the Splits&#x27; self-proclaimed leader. Performed on-screen in the original series by Jeff Winkless (1968) and voiced by Paul Winchell (1968–1972). Later performed by Ginner Whitcombe and Keith Scott (2008), Terry Sauls and Eric Bauza (2019 film), and Paul F. Tompkins (in &quot;Jellystone!&quot;).
* Bingo – A nasal-voiced orangutan wearing white sunglasses and a yellow vest. Performed on-screen in the original series by Terence H. Winkless (1968) and voiced by Daws Butler (1968–1972). Later performed by Casey Hadfield and Keith Scott (2008), Buntu Plam and Eric Bauza (2019 film), and Jim Conroy (in &quot;Jellystone!&quot;).
* Drooper – A Southern-accented lion with a long tail, wearing yellowish-orange sunglasses. Performed on-screen in the original series by Anne W. Withrow (1968) and voiced by Allan Melvin (1968–1972). Later performed by Adam Grubner (2008), Kori Clarke and Eric Bauza (2019 film), and C.H. Greenblatt (in &quot;Jellystone!&quot;).
* Snorky – An elephant wearing pink sunglasses who communicates through honking noises. Originally covered in shaggy fur, he was redesigned for the second season to more resemble a regular elephant. Performed on-screen in the original series by James Dove (1968). Later performed by Robert Towers (2008) and Brandon Vraagom (2019 film).

===Secondary===
* Announcer – an unseen narrator who introduced the Banana Splits and certain acts. Voiced by Allan Melvin (1968–1972) and Eric Bauza (2019 film).
* The Banana Vac – A blue moose-like head with brown hair and light bulbs on his head. He hangs over the entrance of the clubhouse making various comments and often helps the Splits introduce segments. Voiced by Allan Melvin.
* Cuckoo Clock – A clock with a blue and yellow bird head inside that gave snarky answers when asked &quot;What time is it?&quot;, and helped the Splits introduce segments. Voiced by Paul Winchell.
* Goofy Gopher – A gopher who lived in a flower pot. Voiced by Paul Winchell, it was created for the show&#x27;s second season.
* Mildred the Robot - An invention of Fleegle&#x27;s that could grant wishes, often literally. &quot;Performed&quot; by Robby the Robot
* The Sour Grapes Bunch – A group of silent, human girl characters who were all named Charley (portrayed by Sheri Freeman). The Splits&#x27; rivals, they took turns bringing written notes to the Splits. They danced one song with the title characters. In the first season, on October 5, 1968, the song &quot;Doin&#x27; the Banana Split&quot; had all five girls appear with the hosts.
* The Dilly Sisters – Two Latina girls who played acoustic classical guitars and sang two songs: &quot;The Mexican Hat Dance&quot; and &quot;Ta-ra-ra Boom-de-ay&quot;. They became such a running gag that the viewer didn&#x27;t even have to see them -- one of the Splits would open a door and the first line of &quot;Ta-ra-ra Boom-de-ay&quot; would issue from &quot;behind&quot; the door. The Dilly Sisters were really Miriam and Nelly Nuñez, who recorded pop songs in their native Mexico from 1965 through 1983.

==Segments==
The show had four segments:

* &quot;Arabian Knights&quot; – Prince Turhan (voiced by Jay North), his cousin Princess Nida (voiced by Shari Lewis), and their allies Fariik the Magician (voiced by John Stephenson), Raseem the Strong (voiced by Frank Gerstle), his donkey Zazuum (voiced by Don Messick), and shapeshifter Bez (voiced by Henry Corden) work to free Persia from the evil Bakaar the Black Sultan (voiced by John Stephenson) and his enforcer Vangore (voiced by Paul Frees).
* &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; – Based on the novel of the same name. Athos (voiced by Jonathan Harris), Porthos (voiced by Barney Phillips), Aramis (voiced by Don Messick), and D&#x27;Artagnan (voiced by Bruce Watson) partake in new adventures fighting the enemies of the crowned heads of France King Louis XIV (voiced by Don Messick) and Queen Anne (voiced by Julie Bennett). They are sometimes assisted by a queen&#x27;s handmaid named Lady Constance Bonacieux (voiced by Julie Bennett) and her young nephew Tooly (voiced by Teddy Eccles).
* &quot;Micro Ventures&quot; – A four-episode segment where Professor Carter (voiced by Don Messick) and his children Jill (voiced by Patsy Garrett) and Mike (voiced by Tommy Cook) use a shrinking machine to shrink themselves and their dune buggy to miniature size to explore and experience the world from the perspective of an insect.
* &quot;Danger Island&quot; – The show&#x27;s only live-action segment. This adventure serial depicts archaeologist Professor Irwin Hayden (portrayed by Frank Aletter), his assistant Lincoln &quot;Link&quot; Simmons (portrayed by Jan Michael Vincent), and his daughter Leslie (portrayed by Ronne Troup) having adventures on an unnamed island chain with a shipwrecked merchant mariner named Elihu Morgan (portrayed by Rockne Tarkington) and his sidekick Chongo (portrayed by Kim Kahana) as they avoid a group of bumbling yet heavily armed modern day pirates led by Captain Mu-Tan (portrayed by Victor Eberg).

In the second season, &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; segments were replaced with reruns of &quot;The Hillbilly Bears&quot;, a cartoon segment that previously appeared on &quot;The Atom Ant Show&quot; (1965–1968).

&quot;The Banana Splits&quot; was syndicated in 1970 to local stations, reformatted as a half-hour show under the title The Banana Splits and Friends Show. The Banana Splits formed a framework for episodes from three of Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s animated series (&quot;The Atom Ant Show&quot;, &quot;The Secret Squirrel Show&quot;, and &quot;The Adventures of Gulliver&quot;) and the live-action &quot;The New Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&quot;. All the original &quot;Banana Splits&quot; episodes were included in this package, with Paul Winchell providing new, spoken introductions for the added components in the series.

==Music==

The show&#x27;s theme song, &quot;The Tra La La Song (One Banana, Two Banana)&quot;, was credited to Ritchie Adams and Mark Barkan, but that was merely contractual. It was written by Nelson B. Winkless Jr., on the upright piano in his living room—a piano that also spawned the &quot;Snap, Crackle, Pop&quot; jingle, among other successful themes. Adams and Barkan were the show&#x27;s music directors. The song, a single attributed to The Banana Splits, peaked at #96 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Top 100 in February 1969. The version included on the &quot;We&#x27;re The Banana Splits&quot; album is the same heard at the beginning of the show, while the single version is an entirely different arrangement and recording, with an additional verse.

The Banana Splits&#x27; bubblegum pop rock and roll was provided by studio professionals, including Joey Levine (&quot;I Enjoy Being a Boy&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s a Good Day for a Parade&quot;); Al Kooper (&quot;You&#x27;re the Lovin&#x27; End&quot;); Barry White (&quot;Doin&#x27; the Banana Split&quot;); Gene Pitney (&quot;Two Ton Tessie&quot;) and Jimmy Radcliffe, who provided his songs (&quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Find a Cave&quot;, &quot;Soul&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Go Away Go-Go Girl&quot;, &quot;Adam Had &#x27;Em&quot; and &quot;The Show Must Go On&quot;) but did not contribute vocals to Splits recordings.

The music director was music publisher Aaron Schroeder; production duties were mainly handled by David Mook. When a heavier R&amp;B vocal was needed, the music producers usually turned to singer Ricky Lancelotti, who was credited under his stage name Rick Lancelot. He went on to record several songs with Frank Zappa. In 1968, The Banana Splits released an album on Decca Records titled &quot;We&#x27;re the Banana Splits&quot;.

<text>Kim Stanley (born Patricia Kimberley Reid; February 11, 1925 – August 20, 2001) was an American actress who was primarily active in television and theatre but also had occasional film performances.

She began her acting career in theatre and subsequently attended the Actors Studio in New York. She received the 1952 Theatre World Award for her role in &quot;The Chase&quot; (1952), and starred in the Broadway productions of &quot;Picnic&quot; (1953) and &quot;Bus Stop&quot; (1955). Stanley was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play for her roles in &quot;A Touch of the Poet&quot; (1959) and &quot;A Far Country&quot; (1962).

In the 1950s, Stanley was a prolific performer in television; she later progressed to film, with a well-received performance in &quot;The Goddess&quot; (1958). She was the narrator of &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; (1962), and starred in &quot;Séance on a Wet Afternoon&quot; (1964), for which she won the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress. She was less active during the remainder of her career; two of her later film successes were as the mother of Frances Farmer in &quot;Frances&quot; (1982), for which she received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, and as Pancho Barnes in &quot;The Right Stuff&quot; (1983). Stanley received a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress – Miniseries or a Movie for her performance as Big Mama in a television adaptation of &quot;Cat on a Hot Tin Roof&quot; in 1985. That same year, she was inducted into the American Theatre Hall of Fame.

==Early life==
Stanley was born in Tularosa, New Mexico, the daughter of Ann (&quot;née&quot; Miller), an interior decorator, and J. T. Reid, a professor of philosophy and education at the University of New Mexico, located in Albuquerque. Her father was of Irish or Scottish descent, born and raised in Texas, where he met her mother (who was of German and English ancestry). She had three older brothers (Howard Clinton Reid, a psychiatrist; Kenneth Reid, killed in pilot training during World War II; and Justin Truman Reid, a lawyer); and a half-sister (Carol Ann Reid). She was a drama major at the University of New Mexico, and later studied at the Pasadena Playhouse and adopted her maternal grandmother&#x27;s surname as her stage name.

==Career==

===Theatre===
Stanley was a successful Broadway actress with only a few film roles. She was singled out by &quot;The New York Times&quot; critic Brooks Atkinson for her early work. She eventually attended the Actors Studio, studying under Elia Kazan, Lee Strasberg, and Vivian Nathan. She received the 1952 Theatre World Award for her performance as Anna Reeves in &quot;The Chase&quot;, and starred in such Broadway hits as &quot;Picnic&quot; (1953), playing Millie Owens and &quot;Bus Stop&quot; (1955), playing Cherie.

She was nominated for the 1959 Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play for &quot;A Touch of the Poet&quot; and the 1962 Tony for Best Actress in a Play for her portrayal of Elizabeth von Ritter in Henry Denker&#x27;s &quot;A Far Country&quot;. Stanley also portrayed Maggie &quot;The Cat&quot; in &quot;Cat on a Hot Tin Roof&quot; in the original London production of the play. In 1965, she played Masha in the London run of an Actors Studio production of Anton Chekhov&#x27;s play &quot;The Three Sisters&quot;. After a savaging of the production by local critics, she made good on her promise to never act on stage again.

===Television===
Stanley was a leading lady of live television drama, which flourished in New York City during the 1950s. On October 17, 1950, she starred in &quot;The Vanishing Lady&quot; on &quot;The Trap&quot;. Her other starring roles included Wilma, a star-struck 15-year-old girl from the U.S. Gulf Coast of Texas in Horton Foote&#x27;s &quot;A Young Lady of Property&quot;, which aired on &quot;The Philco-Goodyear Television Playhouse&quot; on April 5, 1953.

===Film===
Her first film was &quot;The Goddess&quot; (1958), playing a tragic movie star. She starred in &quot;Séance on a Wet Afternoon&quot; (1964), winning both the National Board of Review Award for Best Actress and the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress, and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress and the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role.

A filmed version of Strasberg-directed &quot;Three Sisters&quot; (1966) opened with Stanley reprising the role of Masha, and is the only time one can see her perform in a film alongside Geraldine Page, Sandy Dennis, Shelley Winters and other well-known names of the Actors Studio. She was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress and a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress – Motion Picture for her performance as Frances Farmer&#x27;s possessive mother in &quot;Frances&quot; (1982). She also played Pancho Barnes in &quot;The Right Stuff&quot; (1983). Stanley was the uncredited narrator in the drama film &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; (1962). As the narrator, she represents the character Jean Louise Finch (&quot;Scout&quot;) as an adult. Mary Badham portrays Scout as a child in the film.

She received an Emmy Award for Outstanding Single Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role for her appearance in the episode, &quot;A Cardinal Act of Mercy&quot; (1963), of the television series, &quot;Ben Casey&quot; (1961–1966), and an Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Limited Series or a Special for her appearance in the 1984 television adaptation of Tennessee Williams&#x27;s Southern melodrama &quot;Cat on a Hot Tin Roof&quot;, this time as Big Mama.

==Personal life==
Stanley was married four times: to Bruce Hall (1945–1946), Curt Conway (1949–1956), Alfred Ryder (1958–1964), and Joseph Siegel (1964–1967). All four marriages ended in divorce.

She had three children: one by Curt Conway; one by Brooks Clift (brother of Montgomery Clift), while she was married to Conway; and one by Alfred Ryder (Laurie). During her marriage to Ryder, Stanley converted to Judaism.

Stanley did not act during her later years, preferring the role of teacher in New York City, Los Angeles, and later Santa Fe, New Mexico.

==Death==
Stanley died of uterine cancer at a nursing home in Santa Fe at the age of 76. She was survived by her brother Justin, her three children, and several nephews and nieces. A biography, &quot;Female Brando: the Legend of Kim Stanley&quot; (2006), by Jon Krampner, was published by Back Stage Books, a division of Watson-Guptill.

She was inducted into the New Mexico Entertainment Hall of Fame in 2012.

<doc id="210238" wikidata="Q584025" url="?curid=210238" title="Dynasty (1981 TV series)">
<text>Dynasty is an American prime time soap opera that aired on ABC from January 12, 1981, to May 11, 1989. The series, created by Richard and Esther Shapiro and produced by Aaron Spelling, revolves around the Carringtons, a wealthy family residing in Denver. &quot;Dynasty&quot; stars John Forsythe as oil magnate Blake Carrington, Linda Evans as his new wife Krystle, and later Joan Collins as his former wife Alexis.

&quot;Dynasty&quot; was conceived by ABC to compete with CBS&#x27;s prime time series &quot;Dallas&quot;. Ratings for the show&#x27;s first season were unimpressive, but a revamp for the second season that included the arrival of Collins as scheming Alexis saw ratings enter the top 20. By the fall of 1982, it was a top 10 show, and by the spring of 1985, it was the #1 show in the United States. The series declined considerably in popularity during its final three seasons, and it was ultimately cancelled in the spring of 1989 after nine seasons and 220 episodes. A two-part miniseries, &quot;&quot;, aired in October 1991. A reboot series with a new cast premiered on The CW in October 2017.

&quot;Dynasty&quot; was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series – Drama every year from 1981 to 1986, winning in 1984. The series spawned a successful line of fashion and luxury products, and also a spin-off series called &quot;The Colbys&quot;. Other notable cast members included Pamela Sue Martin, Lloyd Bochner, Heather Locklear, Catherine Oxenberg, Michael Nader, Diahann Carroll, Emma Samms, Rock Hudson, Kate O&#x27;Mara, and Stephanie Beacham.

==Series history==
===Development===
Aaron Spelling, already well known for his successful ABC series, including &quot;Starsky &amp; Hutch&quot;, &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;, &quot;The Love Boat&quot;, &quot;Fantasy Island&quot;, &quot;Vega$&quot; and &quot;Hart to Hart&quot;, took on Richard and Esther Shapiro&#x27;s vision of a rich and powerful family who &quot;lived and sinned&quot; in a 48-room Denver mansion. Esther Shapiro said that an inspiration for the show was &quot;I, Claudius&quot;, a fictionalized depiction of the Julio-Claudian dynasty of Roman emperors. Shapiro said in 1985, &quot;We wanted to do something that would be fun, an American fantasy. We thought people had seen enough stories where families fell apart. We wanted a strong, nineteenth-century sort of family where people were in conflict but loved each other in spite of everything.&quot;

Intended by ABC to be a competitor for CBS&#x27;s &quot;Dallas&quot;, the working title for &quot;Dynasty&quot; was &quot;Oil&quot;. Initially, the two main families featured in the series were known as the Parkhursts and Corbys. By the time production began, they had been renamed the Carringtons and Colbys. George Peppard was cast as series patriarch Blake Carrington, but ultimately had difficulties dealing with the somewhat unsympathetic role, and was quickly replaced with John Forsythe. Filmed in 1980, the pilot was among many delayed due to a strike precipitated by animosity between the television networks and the partnership of the Screen Actors Guild and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists. &quot;Dynasty&quot; finally premiered on ABC as a three-hour event on January 12, 1981.

During its run, &quot;Dynasty&quot; explored issues such as rape, homosexuality, and racial integration, and put middle-aged women in the forefront. Acknowledging that the show is, however, primarily entertaining, producer Douglas S. Cramer said, &quot;We walk a fine line, just this side of camp. Careful calculations are made. We sense that while it might be wonderful for Krystle and Alexis to have a catfight in a koi pond, it would be inappropriate for Joan to smack Linda with a koi.&quot;

===Carringtons===
As &quot;Dynasty&quot; begins, powerful oil tycoon Blake Carrington (John Forsythe) is about to marry the younger Krystle Jennings (Linda Evans), his former secretary. Beautiful, earnest, and new to Blake&#x27;s world, Krystle finds a hostile reception in the Carrington household—the staff patronizes her, and Blake&#x27;s headstrong and promiscuous daughter Fallon (Pamela Sue Martin) resents her. Though devoted to Krystle, Blake himself is too preoccupied with his company, Denver-Carrington, and blind to Krystle&#x27;s predicament. Her only ally is her stepson Steven (Al Corley), whose complicated relationship with Blake stems from their fundamental political differences and Steven&#x27;s reluctance to step into his role as future leader of the Carrington empire. Meanwhile, Fallon, better suited to follow in Blake&#x27;s footsteps, is (as a woman) underestimated by and considered little more than a trophy to her father. She channels her energies into toying with various male suitors, including the Carrington chauffeur Michael Culhane (Wayne Northrop). At the end of the three-hour premiere episode &quot;Oil&quot;, Steven finally confronts his father, criticizing Blake&#x27;s capitalistic values and seemingly amoral business practices. Blake explodes, revealing the secret of which Steven thought his father was unaware: Blake is disgusted by Steven&#x27;s homosexuality, and his refusal to &quot;conform&quot; sets father and son at odds for some time.

In counterpoint to the Carringtons are the Blaisdels; Denver-Carrington geologist Matthew (Bo Hopkins)—unhappily married to the emotionally fragile Claudia (Pamela Bellwood)—is Krystle&#x27;s ex-lover. Returning from an extended assignment in the Middle East, Matthew quits and goes into business with wildcatter Walter Lankershim (Dale Robertson), and as Blake&#x27;s behavior begins pushing Krystle toward Matthew, the men are set as both business and romantic rivals. Blake is further enraged when Steven goes to work for longtime friend Matthew, in whom Steven sees qualities lacking in Blake. Though previously in a relationship with another man, Steven finds himself drawn to Claudia, who is putting her life back together after spending time in a psychiatric hospital. Esther Shapiro later said in the DVD commentary of the first season, &quot;The audience told us almost immediately: All they wanted to do was be in the mansion. [They] couldn&#x27;t care less about the oil fields. They didn&#x27;t want to see grubby rooms.&quot;

Fallon makes a secret business deal with Blake&#x27;s old friend and more-powerful business rival Cecil Colby (Lloyd Bochner), marrying his nephew Jeff (John James) to secure Cecil&#x27;s financial assistance for her father. When Blake stumbles upon Steven in an innocent goodbye embrace with his former lover Ted Dinard (Mark Withers), Blake angrily pushes the two men apart; Ted falls backward and hits his head, the injury proving fatal. Blake is arrested and charged with murder, and an angry Steven testifies that Ted&#x27;s death had been the result of malicious intent. A veiled surprise witness for the prosecution appears in the season finale &quot;The Testimony&quot;, and Fallon gasps in recognition: &quot;My God, that&#x27;s my mother!&quot;

The series&#x27; first 13 episodes have been seen in retrospect to be &quot;Dynasty&quot; &quot;arthouse&quot; era, a brief period before its characters were flattened into the caricatures that came to define the prime-time soap genre thanks to &quot;ratings pressures and the introduction of diva Joan Collins...[which] put an end to challenging story lines&quot;. The first season of &quot;Dynasty&quot; was &quot;modestly popular&quot; among viewers, ranking #28 with a 19.0 Nielsen rating, while #1 series &quot;Dallas&quot; achieved a 31.8 rating that season. ABC reran season one in summer 1981 at 10:00 PM on Wednesdays, the new time slot for season two, and initiated a media blitz to promote the series.

===&quot;Enter Alexis&quot;===
In the first episode of the second season, titled &quot;Enter Alexis&quot;, the mysterious witness removes her sunglasses to reveal British actress Joan Collins as a new arrival to the series. Collins&#x27;s Alexis Carrington blazed a trail across the show and its story lines; the additions of Collins and the &quot;formidable writing team&quot; of Eileen and Robert Mason Pollock are generally credited with &quot;Dynasty&quot; subsequent rise in the Nielsen ratings. The Pollocks &quot;soft-pedaled the business angle&quot; of the show and &quot;bombarded viewers with every soap opera staple in the book, presented at such a fast clip that a new tragedy seemed to befall the Carrington family every five minutes.&quot; Alexis&#x27;s testimony notwithstanding, Krystle is immediately put off by the former Mrs. Carrington&#x27;s condescending attitude and manipulations; Krystle&#x27;s subsequent discovery that Alexis had caused her miscarriage by intentionally startling her horse with a gunshot settles Alexis as Krystle&#x27;s implacable nemesis. Other new characters of the season are the psychiatrist Nick Toscanni (James Farentino), who tries to seduce Krystle while bedding Fallon and plotting against Blake; and Krystle&#x27;s greedy niece Sammy Jo Dean (Heather Locklear), who marries Steven for his money. The season finale sees Blake left for dead on a mountain after a fight with Nick. By that time, &quot;Dynasty&quot; had entered the Top 20. Esther Shapiro lamented in the season one DVD commentary, &quot;Had the series been left to us, and been a less huge hit, I think we would have seen these characters realized pretty much the way they are [in season one]. When Alexis came into it, it changed the tenor...And that&#x27;s the way they are now on television: you have your traditional villain, and I think that plays to a different denominator.&quot;

In the third season (ranked fifth in the ratings), Alexis marries Cecil on his deathbed and acquires his company, ColbyCo. In the meantime, Adam Carrington (Gordon Thomson), the long-lost son of Alexis and Blake who had been kidnapped in infancy, reappears in Denver and almost starts an affair with Fallon before they discover they are siblings. Also introduced are Krystle&#x27;s ex-husband, tennis pro Mark Jennings (Geoffrey Scott), and Kirby Anders (Kathleen Beller), the daughter of longtime Carrington majordomo Joseph (Lee Bergere). Kirby catches Adam&#x27;s eye but weds Jeff after his divorce from Fallon. In the middle of the season, news that Steven has been killed in an accident in Indonesia comes to the Carringtons; he survives, but undergoes plastic surgery and returns to Denver (portrayed by Jack Coleman). In the third-season cliffhanger, Alexis lures Krystle to Steven&#x27;s cabin and the two are locked inside while the cabin is set ablaze by an unseen arsonist, later revealed to be Joseph, who had meant for the fire to kill only Alexis and not Krystle.

With the show&#x27;s popularity soaring in the fourth season (now the third-most-watched program of 1983–1984), former President Gerald Ford guest-starred as himself in 1983, along with his wife Betty and former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger. New characters included the charming and ambitious Farnsworth &quot;Dex&quot; Dexter (Michael Nader), the scheming public relations assistant Tracy Kendall (Deborah Adair), the unscrupulous playboy Peter De Vilbis (Helmut Berger), and Blake&#x27;s illegitimate African American half-sister, Dominique Deveraux (Diahann Carroll). The main story lines included a custody battle between Steven and Blake over Steven and Sammy Jo&#x27;s son Danny, and a false accusation of illegal weapons dealings orchestrated by Alexis to ruin Blake&#x27;s financial empire. In the season finale, Fallon disappears just before her second wedding to Jeff (now divorced from Kirby) as her car seemingly collides with a truck on a stormy night (to accommodate the departure of Pamela Sue Martin from the series), while Alexis is arrested for the murder of Mark Jennings.

Driven by the new head writer and producer Camille Marchetta, who had devised the wildly successful &quot;Who Shot J.R.?&quot; scenario on &quot;Dallas&quot; five years earlier, &quot;Dynasty&quot; hit No. 1 in the fifth season. In the story, Alexis is exonerated and her secret daughter Amanda Bedford (Catherine Oxenberg) comes to Denver and discovers that Blake is her father. Steven has married Claudia but leaves her for a man and Claudia starts an affair with Adam. The marriage of Blake and Krystle is in crisis after the birth of their daughter Krystina, Dominique struggles to be accepted as a Carrington and loses her husband Brady Lloyd (Billy Dee Williams) in the process, and Sammy Jo discovers she is the heiress to a huge fortune. At the end of the season, an amnesiac Fallon (now portrayed by actress Emma Samms) reappears while the rest of the family go to Europe for the wedding of Amanda and Prince Michael of Moldavia (Michael Praed).

During the season, &quot;Dynasty&quot; attracted controversy when Rock Hudson&#x27;s real-life HIV-positive status was revealed after a romantic storyline between his character Daniel Reece and Evans&#x27;s Krystle. Hudson&#x27;s scenes required him to kiss Evans and, as news that he had contracted AIDS broke, there was speculation Evans would be at risk. The event led to a Screen Actors Guild rule requiring the notification of performers in advance of any scenes that require open-mouth kissing.

Over the run of the series, the rivalry between Alexis and Krystle is a primary driver for the melodrama. Alexis resents Krystle&#x27;s role as Blake&#x27;s wife and mistress of the Carrington household, and tries to undermine her at every opportunity, while Krystle makes increasingly bold efforts to keep Alexis from interfering in the lives of their mutual loved ones. The pair have numerous verbal spats that sometimes lead to physical altercations. &quot;Unfortunately, the thing people remember about this show is the catfights,&quot; noted Collins in 1991. Entertainment columnist Sue Cameron said in 2018 that the catfights became so popular that the press were invited to watch the filming of them. Krystle and Alexis famously brawl for the first time in Alexis&#x27;s studio, and then later in a lily pond. They also hurl mud at each other at a beauty salon, and slide down a ravine together into a puddle of mud, before having their final showdown brawl in a fashion studio in the 1991 miniseries &quot;&quot;. Later in the series, Alexis also has a catfight with Blake&#x27;s half-sister Dominique (Diahann Carroll), and then her own cousin Sable (Stephanie Beacham). She even has a brawl with her on-again, off-again lover and one-time husband, Dex (Michael Nader). Krystle&#x27;s niece Sammy Jo (Heather Locklear) also has her fair share of catfights, as she first engages in a slap fight with Claudia (Pamela Bellwood) before taking on Amanda (Catherine Oxenberg) in a brawl in a swimming pool. Sammy Jo later fights Fallon (Emma Samms) in a horse trough and the mud around it. Evans even battles with herself at the climax of a 1985–1986 storyline in which Krystle is imprisoned and replaced by a lookalike named Rita (also played by Evans); Krystle ends up battling Rita in order to escape. In 2008, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; termed Alexis and Krystle&#x27;s catfights &quot;the gold standard of scratching and clawing.&quot;

===&quot;Moldavian Massacre&quot;===
The so-called &quot;Moldavian Massacre&quot; occurred during the May 15, 1985 fifth-season finale. Amanda and Prince Michael&#x27;s royal wedding is interrupted by terrorists during a military coup in Moldavia, riddling the chapel with bullets and leaving all of the major characters lying seemingly lifeless. Esther Shapiro later said, &quot;It was a fairy-tale terrorist attack. It was beautifully shot, like a Goya painting.&quot; It was watched by an audience of 25.9 million. In 2011, Ken Tucker of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; named it one of the seven &quot;Unforgettable Cliff-Hangers&quot; of prime time dramatic television.

When the series resumed on September 25, 1985, it was revealed that only two minor characters had died: Steven&#x27;s boyfriend Luke Fuller (Billy Campbell), who was mortally wounded saving Claudia&#x27;s life, and Jeff&#x27;s love interest Lady Ashley Mitchell (Ali MacGraw). In the 2006 CBS special &quot;Dynasty Reunion: Catfights &amp; Caviar&quot;, Gordon Thomson stated that it was the follow-up that was the letdown, not the cliffhanger itself. John James stated in the 2001 episode of &quot;E! The True Hollywood Story&quot; featuring &quot;Dynasty&quot; that the Moldavian Massacre was when the show &quot;maxed out&quot; and &quot;overdosed&quot; on outrageousness. Creator Esther Shapiro stated in 2001 that she thought the cliffhanger was &quot;well produced&quot; but that they &quot;could&#x27;ve done something else&quot;.

Joan Collins was absent from the season six opener, as she was in a tense contract renegotiation with the show, seeking an increased salary. As a result, the first episode had to be rewritten to explain her absence and many of Alexis&#x27;s scenes were given to Krystle. Collins&#x27;s demands were met (she reportedly signed a $60,000 per episode contract) and she returned to the series in the season&#x27;s second episode. Despite her absence, the first episode of season six garnered a 28.1 rating (becoming the most watched episode of the series) as viewers wanted to see who had survived the season five cliffhanger.

===Continuing seasons and decline===

Although still a top ten series, &quot;Dynasty&quot; dropped from first to seventh place in the ratings for its sixth season, which featured a look-alike woman named Rita who poses as Krystle (with both roles played by Linda Evans), introduced Alexis&#x27;s sister Caress (Kate O&#x27;Mara), and launched the spin-off series &quot;The Colbys&quot;. Spurned by Blake, Alexis finds his estranged brother Ben (Christopher Cazenove) and the duo successfully plot to strip Blake of his fortune. Steven&#x27;s budding relationship with the closeted Bart Fallmont (Kevin Conroy) is ruined by Adam&#x27;s business-motivated public revelation that Bart is gay. Amanda, who has divorced Prince Michael, fights with Sammy Jo for the favors of Clay Fallmont (Ted McGinley). The May 21, 1986, season finale finds Blake strangling Alexis while the rest of the cast is in peril at the La Mirage hotel, which has been accidentally set afire by Claudia.

As the seventh season begins in September 1986, Blake stops short of killing Alexis, whom he had been strangling in the previous season&#x27;s cliffhanger, after learning she had bought his mansion and was evicting him and Krystle. Claudia has died in the fire she set, and Amanda (now played by Karen Cellini) is rescued by a returning Michael Culhane, Blake&#x27;s chauffeur from the first season. Blake turns the tables on Ben and Alexis and recovers his wealth, but loses his memory after an oil rig explosion. Alexis finds Blake and, with everyone believing he is dead, perpetuates the belief that they are still married. Living with a clean slate, Alexis finds herself softening to Blake but ultimately tells him the truth as he reunites with Krystle. Krystina receives a heart transplant but is later temporarily kidnapped by Sarah Curtis (Cassie Yates), the mother of the dead girl from whom Krystina received her new heart; Sammy Jo&#x27;s marriage to Clay crumbles and she falls into bed with Steven; Amanda leaves town; and Ben&#x27;s daughter Leslie (Terri Garber) arrives. Adam&#x27;s season-long romance with Blake&#x27;s secretary Dana Waring (Leann Hunley) culminates in a wedding, which is punctuated in the May 6, 1987, season finale by Alexis&#x27;s car plunging off a bridge into a river and the violent return of a vengeful Matthew Blaisdel. Although the first episode of season seven premiered with a high Nielsen rating of a 20.1, the competition with &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot;, now in the same time slot, and the constant storyline changes led to &quot;Dynasty&quot; falling out of the top 20 to No. 25.

With &quot;The Colbys&quot; cancelled, Jeff and Fallon return for &quot;Dynasty&quot; eighth season, their marriage falling apart again. Matthew, returned from the dead but troubled by headaches, holds the Carringtons hostage in hopes that Krystle will run away with him. Steven ends the siege by reluctantly stabbing his old friend to death. Alexis is saved by a handsome, mysterious stranger, Sean Rowan (James Healey). She later marries him, not realizing that he is Joseph&#x27;s son and Kirby&#x27;s brother, bent on revenge. Steven and Sammy Jo&#x27;s reconciliation is short-lived, and the pursuit of children unravels Adam and Dana&#x27;s marriage. Sean begins to manipulate and destroy the Carringtons from the inside, and he fights Dex to the death in the March 30, 1988 season finale. Blake, who failed being elected as governor of Colorado, comes home to find Krystle missing and their bedroom in shambles. For the first time since its debut, the show had dropped out of the top 30, to No. 41 in the ratings.

David Paulsen joined &quot;Dynasty&quot; as Executive Supervising Producer for its ninth season, and took over the plotting of the series. In a money-saving move, Evans appeared in only six episodes early in the season as an ailing Krystle seeks brain surgery in Switzerland but is left in an offscreen coma. Similarly to cut costs, Collins was contracted for only 13 out of the season&#x27;s 22 episodes. Former &quot;The Colbys&quot; character Sable (Stephanie Beacham) was brought in as both a platonic confidante for Blake and a nemesis for Alexis, and Tracy Scoggins also reprised her &quot;Colbys&quot; role as Sable&#x27;s daughter Monica. A storyline involving a murder and an old secret tying the Carrington, Colby, and Dexter families together spanned the season as Alexis and Sable sparred first over business and then over Dex. The series moved from Wednesday to Thursday, but ratings continued to decline and &quot;Dynasty&quot; was ranked No. 69 in the United States for the season. In May 1989, new ABC entertainment president Robert A. Iger cancelled &quot;Dynasty&quot;, making the last episode of season nine the series finale. The show ended on a cliffhanger with Blake, Fallon, Krystina, Alexis, and Dex in mortal peril.

=== Reunion miniseries ===
As an attempt to wrap up plotlines left unresolved by &quot;Dynasty&quot; cancellation, ABC produced a two-part miniseries titled &quot;&quot;, which aired in October 1991.

Many of the cast members, including John Forsythe, Joan Collins, John James, Heather Locklear and Emma Samms agreed to reprise their roles in early 1991. It was unknown during pre-production which characters the reunion film would include. Linda Evans was brought back last-minute, just before the final script was penned, as was Kathleen Beller. Jack Coleman, who had played Steven Carrington from 1982 to 1988, was unavailable to reprise his role, so he was replaced with Al Corley, who originated the part in 1981. Gordon Thomson also originally agreed to appear in the film but ABC refused to align the shooting schedule with his work on the daytime series &quot;Santa Barbara&quot;, and replaced him with Robin Sachs.

&quot;Dynasty: The Reunion&quot; aired on October 20 and October 22, 1991. The first night averaged 23 million viewers, the second night averaged 20.3 million. Both parts ranked in the Top 20 for the week, and second place in their respective time slots, behind the World Series on CBS. Critical reviews were not favorable, with many feeling the script was poor and that the film was merely an attempt of ABC&#x27;s wish to &quot;cash-in&quot; on an old series.

==Production==

&quot;Dynasty&quot; was shot at Warner Hollywood Studios in West Hollywood, California. The Filoli estate in Woodside, California, was used as the 48-room Carrington mansion in the opening credits, establishing shots, and some outdoor scenes in the pilot episode. Some of the other exterior shots of the Carrington mansion (including the lily pond catfight) were shot at a 17-room Palladian house called Arden Villa in Pasadena, California.

Costume designer Nolan Miller designed approximately 3,000 costumes over the course of the series, saying &quot;I never want to see them wearing the same outfit twice&quot;. His weekly wardrobe budget was $35,000.

John Forsythe was the only cast member to appear in all 220 episodes of the series. Linda Evans appeared in 204 of the 220 episodes, leaving the series after appearing in only six episodes of the ninth and final season. Joan Collins, who did not join the cast until the second season, also missed one episode in season 6 and nine episodes in season 9, and was consequently present for a total of 195 episodes. Forsythe and John James were the only two original cast members to appear in the final episode.

==Episodes==

===US Nielsen ratings===
&quot;Dynasty&quot; was a top 30 show from its first through seventh season, reaching No. 1 for the 1984–85 season with a Nielsen rating of 25.0 or an average tune-in audience of 21.2 million homes per episode.

===Syndication===
&quot;Dynasty&quot; was initially syndicated in reruns by Metromedia Producers Corporation in September 1985, on stations such as KTTV in Los Angeles, and WNEW-TV 5 in New York City, while season 6 began airing on ABC. This initial syndication package consisted of all 117 episodes (originally 114 on ABC) that had been produced up to this point.

==Impact and reception==
At the height of &quot;Dynasty&quot; popularity in 1985, Esther Shapiro said, &quot;we&#x27;ve done important things for women with &quot;Dynasty&quot;. For middle-aged women. You know, to let them know that it&#x27;s OK to want power and be romantic.&quot; Collins said in 2018, &quot;Every single person on &quot;Dynasty&quot; was good-looking. You wanted to see rich, good-looking people fighting with each other.&quot; In 2012, &quot;The New York Times&quot; credited the popularity of Nolan Miller&#x27;s costumes with &quot;setting a trend for thick shoulder pads during a decade of power dressing&quot;.

===Awards and nominations===
&quot;Dynasty&quot; was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series – Drama every year from 1981 to 1986, winning in 1984. Forsythe and Collins were also nominated for Best Actor and Best Actress every year from 1981 to 1986, and Evans was nominated for Best Actress every year from 1981 to 1985. Evans won in 1982 (tying with Barbara Bel Geddes of rival series &quot;Dallas&quot;), Forsythe won in 1983 and 1984, and Collins won in 1983. John James and Gordon Thomson were also nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Series, Miniseries or Television Film (James in 1985, and Thomson in 1987).

The series was nominated for 24 Emmy Awards over the course of its run, but only won once, for Outstanding Costumes for a Series in 1984. The show was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series in 1982. From 1982 to 1984, Forsythe received three consecutive nominations for Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series. Evans and Collins were each nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series (Evans in 1983, and Collins in 1984); both actresses lost to Tyne Daly for her work on the CBS police drama series &quot;Cagney and Lacey&quot;.

&quot;Dynasty&quot; was also an award winner at the People&#x27;s Choice Awards. Evans won Favorite Female Performer in a New TV Program in 1982, and Favorite Female TV Performer in 1983. In 1984, she won Favorite Female TV Performer, and the series was named Favorite TV Drama in a tie with the NBC drama &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot;. Evans and the series again won those same honors in 1985, with Evans sharing the Favorite Female TV Performer prize with her co-star, Collins. Evans won the award again in 1986, and the series tied with &quot;Miami Vice&quot; for Favorite TV Dramatic Program. In 1987, &quot;Dynasty&quot; tied with the CBS series &quot;Dallas&quot; for the award Favorite Nighttime Dramatic Serial. &quot;Dynasty&quot; won &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot; Awards in 1984 and 1985 for Outstanding Primetime Soap. In 1984 Forsythe, Evans and Collins won the awards for Outstanding Lead Actor, Actress and Villainess. John Forsythe won another award for Outstanding Actor in a Mature Role. Evans and Collins won the awards in the same categories in 1985, while Catherine Oxenberg won two awards, for Outstanding Supporting Actress and Outstanding Female Newcomer.

===Spin-offs and television events===
A spin-off, &quot;The Colbys&quot;, debuted in 1985, as Fallon &quot;returned from the dead&quot; and ex-husband Jeff followed her to Los Angeles, where they became embroiled in the family intrigues of Jeff&#x27;s wealthy California relatives. Pamela Sue Martin had been asked to reprise the role of Fallon but declined which led to the casting of Emma Samms in the role. Ratings for &quot;The Colbys&quot; were poor and the show lasted for just two seasons, ending in 1987. Both Fallon and Jeff returned to &quot;Dynasty&quot; after the series ended.

The cable channel SOAPnet aired repeats of all nine seasons. In January 2004, creator Esther Shapiro participated in a marathon of the show&#x27;s episodes, called &quot;Serial Bowl: Alexis vs. Krystle&quot;, giving behind-the-scenes tidbits and factoids.

On January 2, 2005, ABC aired a fictionalized television movie titled &quot;&quot;, chronicling the creation and backstage details of &quot;Dynasty&quot;. It received poor reviews both for content and for historical accuracy, and was criticized by Forsythe, Evans, and Collins in separate press releases. Filmed in Australia, the movie starred Bartholomew John as Forsythe, Melora Hardin as Evans, and Alice Krige as Collins. The film begins with a disclaimer noting the inclusion of &quot;time compression and composite and fictionalized characters and incidents,&quot; and takes dramatic license with both the historical timeline and events, as well as the fictional storylines originally presented on &quot;Dynasty&quot;.

On May 2, 2006, a non-fiction television special named &quot;Dynasty Reunion: Catfights &amp; Caviar&quot; aired on CBS. It assembled former cast members from the series in John Forsythe, Joan Collins and Linda Evans, as well as the four original actors who played the Carrington children (Pamela Sue Martin, Al Corley, Gordon Thomson and Catherine Oxenberg). Heather Locklear, John James, and Diahann Carroll declined to participate, but cast members Pamela Bellwood, Jack Coleman and Emma Samms were included in prerecorded interviews. The special showed various clips from the series, as the cast reminisced about their time on the show. The special was filmed at the Filoli estate, the location originally used for exterior shots of the Carringtons&#x27; mansion in the series.

On January 26, 2015, &quot;Home &amp; Family&quot; hosted a &quot;Dynasty&quot; reunion for one episode on the Hallmark Channel. It assembled former cast members from the series, including Pamela Sue Martin, Al Corley, Gordon Thomson, John James and Pamela Bellwood. The reunion episode focused on the cast&#x27;s memories of the show, both on and off-screen; a collection of gowns worn by the female characters; as well as members of the cast participating in several cooking, craft and fashion segments. The reunion episode also featured a new opening of the show&#x27;s iconic theme song, which included &quot;Home &amp; Family&quot; hosts Mark Steines and Christina Ferrare. Linda Evans did not participate on-air in the reunion episode, but sent a message to the cast, which was read on air.

===Commercial tie-ins===
The creations of series costume designer Nolan Miller became so popular that &quot;Dynasty&quot; spawned its own line of women&#x27;s apparel called &quot;The &quot;Dynasty&quot; Collection&quot;—a series of haute couture designs based on costumes worn by Joan Collins, Linda Evans and Diahann Carroll. A men&#x27;s fashion line followed. Esther Shapiro herself came up with the idea to produce licensed products that included sheets and towels, jewelry and furs, &#x27;Forever Krystle&#x27; perfume, and &#x27;Carrington&#x27; men&#x27;s cologne. Linda Evans was hired as a spokesperson for the beverage Crystal Light due to her character&#x27;s name.

Two novels were published, based on scripts from early episodes—&quot;Dynasty&quot; (1983) and &quot;Alexis Returns&quot; (1984)—written by Eileen Lottman. In 1984, Doubleday/Dolphin published the companion book &quot;Dynasty: The Authorized Biography of the Carringtons&quot;, which included an introduction by Esther Shapiro. &quot;The Authorized Biography&quot; featured storyline synopses in the form of extended biographies of the main characters, descriptions of primary locations (like the Carrington Estate and La Mirage) and dozens of photos from the series.

===Home media===
The first season of &quot;Dynasty&quot; was released on Region 1 DVD on April 19, 2005, by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment. The rights to subsequent seasons (and Season 1 rights for other regions) reverted to CBS DVD (distributed by Paramount) in November 2006. Seasons 1 through 4 were made available on iTunes in May 2012.

==Reboot series==

The Shapiros announced on January 12, 2011, that they had written a &quot;Dynasty&quot; prequel feature film script set in the 1960s, and were shopping it to studios for a possible film franchise. In a September 2011 interview, &quot;Dynasty&quot; actress Joan Collins chatted about a &quot;Dynasty&quot; television revival: &quot;I&#x27;ve been in constant contact with Esther Shapiro, who wrote it, and apparently they&#x27;ve written a script.&quot;

In September 2016, it was announced that a &quot;Dynasty&quot; reboot was in development at The CW, co-written by Josh Schwartz, Stephanie Savage, and Sallie Patrick. The project received a series order in May 2017. With the Shapiros also producing, the new series finds heiress Fallon facing off against her soon-to-be stepmother Cristal, a Hispanic woman. The CW&#x27;s &quot;Dynasty&quot; features Grant Show as Blake; Elizabeth Gillies as Fallon; Sam Adegoke as Jeff; Robert Christopher Riley as Blake&#x27;s chauffeur Michael; James Mackay as Steven; Rafael de la Fuente as Sam Jones, a gay male version of Sammy Jo; Alan Dale as Carrington majordomo Anders; Nick Wechsler as Matthew Blaisdel; Brianna Brown as Claudia; Wakeema Hollis as Jeff&#x27;s sister Monica Colby; Maddison Brown as Kirby, Sam Underwood as Adam; and Michael Michele as Dominique. Nathalie Kelley initially appears as Cristal in season one, but is replaced with Ana Brenda Contreras in season two, who is then recast with Daniella Alonso in season three. Nicollette Sheridan plays Alexis in seasons one and two, and Elaine Hendrix steps into the role for season three.

Season one of the new &quot;Dynasty&quot; premiered in the United States on October 11, 2017. The series was later renewed for a second, third, fourth, and fifth season. In May 2022, The CW announced the fifth season would be &quot;Dynasty&quot; last.

<doc id="210239" wikidata="Q482632" url="?curid=210239" title="Séance on a Wet Afternoon">
<text>Séance on a Wet Afternoon is a 1964 British crime thriller film, directed by Bryan Forbes, and starring Kim Stanley, Richard Attenborough, Nanette Newman, Mark Eden and Patrick Magee. Based on the 1961 novel by Mark McShane, the film follows a mentally unstable medium who convinces her husband to kidnap a child so she can help the police solve the crime and achieve renown for her abilities. Kim Stanley was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress for her role in the film.

==Plot==
Myra Savage is a medium who holds séances in her home. Her husband Billy, unable to work because of asthma and cowed by Myra&#x27;s domineering personality, assists in her séances. Myra&#x27;s life and psychic work are dominated by her relationship with the spirit of her son Arthur, who died at birth.

At Myra&#x27;s insistence, Billy kidnaps Amanda, the young daughter of a wealthy couple, Mr and Mrs Clayton, confining her in a room in the Savage home, whilst Myra impersonates a nurse to deceive the girl into believing she is hospitalised. Myra insists she is &quot;borrowing&quot; the girl to demonstrate her psychic abilities to the police in helping them find her. Although they ask for a £25,000 ransom, they plan to return the money with the girl after Myra has become famous for helping find her. Myra visits the Claytons, stating that she is a professional medium and claiming that she had a dream involving their daughter; Clayton is dismissive but his wife believes that Myra may know something. Mrs Clayton then comes to one of Myra&#x27;s seances.

After Billy hides Amanda, anticipating (correctly) the police coming to the house to investigate, he collects the ransom money, burying it in their garden before taking Amanda back to their house, but she has a high temperature and Billy wants to get a doctor, which Myra violently disagrees with. Myra&#x27;s plan goes awry as her unsteady mental health begins to fray. Believing that her dead son Arthur wants Amanda to be with him, she tells Billy to kill her; he wants to refuse, realising that his wife is completely unhinged, but he seems to lack the will power to resist her. He takes Amanda into the woods and places her under a tree; it is not clear if she is dead or just sedated.

When the police ask Myra to conduct a séance to help them find the missing girl – as she had hoped they would – she breaks down during the séance and reveals, as if in a psychic trance, what she and Billy have done. As the trance continues, she senses that the girl was not killed. Billy tells the police where he hid the ransom money and reveals that he left Amanda unconscious where she would be found by scouts who were camping nearby, which the police already know, confirming that she is all right.

==Production==
===Casting===
According to Jon Krampner&#x27;s biography &quot;Female Brando: The Legend of Kim Stanley&quot;, Forbes and Attenborough initially had encountered difficulty in casting the role of Myra. Deborah Kerr and Simone Signoret originally were approached for the part, but both actresses turned down the role.

Forbes and Attenborough then contacted Kim Stanley, an American theatre and television actress whose previous film work was limited to starring in the 1958 feature &quot;The Goddess&quot; and providing the uncredited opening and closing narration for the 1962 adaptation of &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot;. Attenborough later was quoted as stating that Stanley was the best choice, noting that the &quot;complexity of dramatic impression vital to the credibility of Myra was hard to find. Also an intellectual ability to follow and understand the character. I didn’t believe Simone (Signoret) could convey, as Kim did, the otherworldliness which this woman inhabited in her private fantasies.&quot;

===Shooting===
The film was shot at Pinewood Studios and at various locations around London including Trafalgar Square, Wimbledon, several London Underground stations and the derelict Staines Greyhound Stadium. The film&#x27;s sets were designed by the art director Ray Simm.

==Release==
===Reception===
&quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; wrote: &quot;If one says that the best things about &quot;Seance on a Wet Afternoon&quot; are the performances of Kim Stanley and Richard Attenborough and Bryan Forbes&#x27; script, this is not to decry Forbes&#x27; direction. In fact he does an excellent job, and no doubt the perfectly modulated acting (no hysteria, no Look It&#x27;s My Mad Scene) is largely due to his sympathetic handling of the actors: but there are flaws which indicate an uncertainty of level. ... The atmosphere is beautifully furthered by the décor – the hideously oppressive living-room, the ancient gramophone scratchily playing a haunting Mendelssohn song, the glaring whiteness of the bedroom disguised as a hospital, the polished gloom of the seance chamber, the discreetly overgrown garden. ... Still, it isn&#x27;t often that the British cinema offers a thriller which is so consistently intelligent and exciting; which contains one genuinely superb performance (Kim Stanley) likely to figure in many a ten-best list, and another (Attenborough) almost as good; and which provides dialogue which unerringly illuminates the dangerous areas between private fantasy and public madness.&quot;

London&#x27;s &quot;Daily Express&quot; called the film &quot;superbly atmospheric&quot;, and &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot; dubbed it &quot;compassionate, intelligent and absorbing.&quot;

The &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; called &quot;Séance on a Wet Afternoon&quot; &quot;the perfect psychological suspense thriller and a flawless film to boot&quot;, and &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated &quot;it isn’t often you see a melodrama that sends you forth with a lump in your throat, as well as a set of muscles weary from being tense for nigh two hours.&quot;

The film was a commercial failure, and its losses – along with those of &quot;Life for Ruth&quot; (1962) – caused the demise of the Allied Film Makers company.

===Awards and nominations===
==Remakes==
&quot;Séance on a Wet Afternoon&quot; was remade in 2000 as the Japanese horror film &quot;Seance&quot; (, &quot;Kōrei&quot;), directed by Kiyoshi Kurosawa. An opera of the same name based on the film, created by Broadway composer Stephen Schwartz, had its world premiere on 26 September 2009, at the Granada Theater at Opera Santa Barbara in California.

<doc id="210241" wikidata="Q1130001" url="?curid=210241" title="Textus Receptus">
<text>The  (Latin: &quot;received text&quot;) is the succession of printed Greek New Testament texts starting with Erasmus&#x27; &quot;Novum Instrumentum omne&quot; (1516) and including the editions of Stephanus, Beza, the Elzevir house, Colinaeus and Scrivener. 

Erasmus&#x27; Latin/Greek New Testament editions and annotations were a major influence for the original German Luther Bible and the translations of the New Testament into English by William Tyndale. Subsequent &quot;Textus Receptus&quot; editions constituted the main Greek translation-base for the King James Version, the Spanish Reina-Valera translation, the Czech Bible of Kralice, the Portuguese Almeida Recebida, the Dutch Statenvertaling, the Russian Synodal Bible and many other Reformation-era New Testament translations throughout Western, Northern and Central Europe.

Despite being viewed as an inferior form of the text of the New Testament by many modern textual critics, some Conservative Christians still view it as the most authentic text of the New Testament. This view is generally based upon a theological doctrine of the supernatural providential preservation of scripture.

== Textual origin ==
The &quot;Textus Receptus&quot; most strongly resembles the Byzantine text-type, as its editor Erasmus mainly based his work on manuscripts following the Byzantine text. However Erasmus sometimes followed the Minuscule 1 (part of the proposed Caesarean text-type in the Gospels) in a small number of verses, additionally following the Latin Vulgate translated by Jerome in the 4th century in a few verses, including Acts 9:6 and in placing the doxology of Romans into chapter 16 instead of after chapter 14 as in most Byzantine manuscripts. In the Book of Revelation, Erasmus&#x27; text primarily follows the Andreas text-type, named after the Andreas of Caesarea, (563–614) who used it in his widely influential commentary on Revelation.

Erasmus at the start of his work had around 8 Greek manuscripts, although he used &quot;Manuscript 2105&quot; mainly for his copious annotations which were based on notes prepared over the previous decade on unknown manuscripts. The Greek manuscripts used in the creation of Erasmus&#x27; first edition are the following:

Even though Erasmus had only one manuscript of Revelation when he created the &quot;Textus Receptus&quot;, F.H.A Scrivener notes that in a few places such as Revelation 1:4 and Revelation 8:13, Erasmus refers to manuscripts which he had seen earlier during his travels.

Other manuscripts were available to later editors of the &quot;Textus Receptus&quot;. Robert Stephanus had access to over a dozen manuscripts, including Codex Bezae and Regius, additionally making use of the Complutensian Polyglot. Stephanus&#x27; edition of the &quot;Textus Receptus&quot; became one of the two &quot;standard&quot; texts of the &quot;Textus Receptus&quot; alongside those of Theodore Beza. Like Stephanus, Beza had access to a larger manuscript pool than Erasmus, including Codex Claromontanus and the Codex Bezae, however he made very little use of them in his editions.

=== Last verses of Revelation ===
Although sometimes contested by some defenders of the &quot;Textus Receptus&quot;, it is a commonly accepted fact that because the manuscript which Erasmus used lacked the last six verses of Revelation, he used the Latin Vulgate to backtranslate the last verses of Revelation into Greek. However, he also used the notes of Valla, such as in the reading &quot;Amen. Even so, come Lord Jesus&quot; in Revelation 22:20, which does not completely agree with the Latin Vulgate. In this process, Erasmus introduced many distinct readings into the text of Revelation. Some of these readings were later edited out by Stephanus in his editions of the &quot;Textus Receptus&quot;, but some distinct Erasmian readings remained, such as the words &quot;book of life&quot; instead of &quot;tree of life&quot; in Revelation 22:19.

Some defenders of the &quot;Textus Receptus&quot; have argued that Erasmus used other Greek manuscripts for the last six verses of Revelation. Manuscripts such as 2049, 2067 and 296 which contain similar readings to the &quot;Textus Receptus&quot; have been proposed as possible sources for Erasmus&#x27; readings in the book of Revelation. However, critical scholarship today views these manuscripts as being more likely being influenced by the printed &quot;Textus Receptus&quot; editions, instead of them being a source for the readings of Erasmus.

== History ==
===Erasmus===
Erasmus had been working for years making philological notes on scriptural and patristic texts. In 1512, he began his work on the Latin New Testament. He consulted all the Vulgate manuscripts that he could find to create an edition without scribal corruptions and with better Latin. In the earlier phases of the project, he never mentioned a Greek text: &quot;My mind is so excited at the thought of emending Jerome&#x27;s text, with notes, that I seem to myself inspired by some god. I have already almost finished emending him by collating a large number of ancient manuscripts, and this I am doing at enormous personal expense.&quot;
He included the Greek text to defend the superiority of his Latin version over the Vulgate. He wrote, &quot;There remains the New Testament translated by me, with the Greek facing, and notes on it by me.&quot; He further demonstrated the reason for the inclusion of the Greek text when defending his work: &quot;But one thing the facts cry out, and it can be clear, as they say, even to a blind man, that often through the translator&#x27;s clumsiness or inattention the Greek has been wrongly rendered; often the true and genuine reading has been corrupted by ignorant scribes, which we see happen every day, or altered by scribes who are half-taught and half-asleep.&quot;

Erasmus&#x27;s new work was published by Froben of Basel in 1516, becoming the first published Greek New Testament, the &quot;Novum Instrumentum omne, diligenter ab Erasmo Rot. Recognitum et Emendatum&quot;. For the Greek text, he used manuscripts: 1, 1rK, 2e, 2ap, 4ap, 7, 817. In his research in England and Brabant for annotations on particular words, he had already consulted several other manuscripts and was particularly interested in patristic quotations as evidence of early readings. For subsequent editions he used more manuscripts, and consulted with his vast network of correspondents.

Typographical errors, attributed to the rush to print the first edition, abounded in the published text. Erasmus also lacked a complete copy of the Book of Revelation and translated the last six verses back into Greek from the Latin Vulgate to finish his edition. Erasmus adjusted the text in many places to correspond with readings found in the Vulgate or as quoted in the Church Fathers; consequently, although the &quot;Textus Receptus&quot; is classified by scholars as a late Byzantine text, it differs in nearly 2,000 readings from the standard form of that text-type, as represented by the &quot;Majority Text&quot; of Hodges and Farstad (Wallace, 1989). The edition was a sell-out commercial success and was reprinted in 1519, with most but not all of the typographical errors corrected.

Erasmus had been studying Greek New Testament manuscripts for many years, in the Netherlands, France, England and Switzerland, noting their many variants, but had only six Greek manuscripts immediately accessible to him in Basel. They all dated from the 12th century or later, and only one came from outside the mainstream Byzantine tradition. Consequently, most modern scholars consider his Greek text to be of dubious quality.

With the third edition of Erasmus&#x27;s Greek text (1522) the Comma Johanneum was included because &quot;Erasmus chose to avoid any occasion for slander rather than persisting in philological accuracy&quot; even though he remained &quot;convinced that it did not belong to the original text of l John.&quot;

Popular demand for Greek New Testaments led to a flurry of further authorized and unauthorized editions in the early sixteenth century, almost all of which were based on Erasmus&#x27;s work and incorporated his particular readings but typically also making a number of minor changes of their own.

=== Complutensian Polyglot ===
Complutensian Polyglot Bible is the name given to the first printed polyglot of the entire Bible. The edition was initiated and financed by Cardinal Francisco Jiménez de Cisneros (1436–1517). 

Some such as the Trinitarian Bible Society also associate the Complutensian Polyglot with the &quot;Textus Receptus&quot; tradition. However, it is not usually named as part of the &quot;Textus Receptus&quot;, though it influenced the &quot;Textus Receptus&quot; and was utilized by editors of the &quot;Textus Receptus&quot;, including Colinaeus, Stephanus and Erasmus himself in later editions. 

=== Estienne (Stephanus) and Beza ===
Robert Estienne, known as Stephanus (1503–1559), a printer from Paris, edited the Greek New Testament four times, in 1546, 1549, 1550 and 1551, the last in Geneva. The edition of 1551 contains the Latin translation of Erasmus and the Vulgate. Estienne&#x27;s version was re-issued with minor revisions of the Greek by Genevan leader Theodore Beza in 1565, 1582, 1588–89, 1598 and 1611.

=== Colinaeus ===
Simon de Colines (1480 – 1546) printed an edition of the Textus Receptus, which was primarily based upon the work of Erasmus and the Complutensian Polyglot. This edition of the &quot;Textus Receptus&quot; began to be printed in 1534, however its influence was minimal and it was not used by later editors of the Textus Receptus.

===Elzevir brothers===

The origin of the term &quot;Textus Receptus&quot; comes from the publisher&#x27;s preface to the 1633 edition produced by Bonaventure and his nephew Abraham Elzevir who were partners in a printing business at Leiden. The preface reads, &quot;Textum ergo habes, nunc ab omnibus receptum: in quo nihil immutatum aut corruptum damus&quot; (&quot;so you hold the text, now received by all, in which [is] nothing corrupt&quot;). The two words &quot;textum&quot; and &quot;receptum&quot; were modified from the accusative to the nominative case to render &quot;Textus Receptus&quot;. Over time, that term has been retroactively applied even to Erasmus&#x27;s editions, as his work served as the basis of the others.

=== F.H.A Scrivener ===

In 1894, Frederick Henry Ambrose Scrivener produced a significant Greek edition of the &quot;Textus Receptus&quot;, based on the textual variants that the translators of the King James Version (KJV) had utilized. The translators of the King James Version did not rely on a single edition of the &quot;Textus Receptus&quot; but instead they incorporated readings from multiple editions of the &quot;Textus Receptus&quot;, including those by Erasmus, Stephanus, and Beza. Additionally, they consulted the Complutensian Polyglot and the Latin Vulgate itself. This resulted in a Greek text that, while rooted in the tradition of the &quot;Textus Receptus&quot;, uniquely aligned with the particular readings of the King James Version.

== Textual criticism ==

John Mill (1645–1707) collated textual variants from 82 Greek manuscripts. In his &quot;Novum Testamentum Graecum, cum lectionibus variantibus MSS&quot; (Oxford 1707) he reprinted the unchanged text of the &quot;Editio Regia&quot;, but in the index he enumerated 30,000 textual variants.

Shortly after Mill published his edition, Daniel Whitby (1638–1725) attacked his work by asserting that the text of the New Testament had never been corrupted and thus equated autographs with the &quot;Textus Receptus&quot;. He considered the 30,000 variants in Mill&#x27;s edition a danger to Holy Scripture and called for defending the &quot;Textus Receptus&quot; against these variants.

Johann Albrecht Bengel (1687–1752) edited in 1725 &quot;Prodromus Novi Testamenti Graeci Rectè Cautèque Adornandi&quot; and in 1734 &quot;Novum Testamentum Graecum&quot;. Bengel divided manuscripts into families and subfamilies and favoured the principle of &quot;lectio difficilior potior&quot; (&quot;the more difficult reading is the stronger&quot;).

Johann Jakob Wettstein&#x27;s apparatus was fuller than that of any previous editor. He introduced the practice of indicating the ancient manuscripts by capital Roman letters and the later manuscripts by Arabic numerals. He published in Basel &quot;Prolegomena ad Novi Testamenti Graeci&quot; (1731).

J. J. Griesbach (1745–1812) combined the principles of Bengel and Wettstein. He enlarged the Apparatus by considering more citations from the Fathers, and various versions, such as the Gothic, the Armenian, and the Philoxenian. Griesbach distinguished a Western, an Alexandrian, and a Byzantine Recension. Christian Frederick Matthaei (1744–1811) was a Griesbach opponent.

Karl Lachmann (1793–1851) was the first who broke with the &quot;Textus Receptus&quot;. His object was to restore the text to the form in which it had been read in the Ancient Church in about AD 380. He used the oldest known Greek and Latin manuscripts.

Constantin von Tischendorf&#x27;s &quot;Editio Octava Critica Maior&quot; was based on Codex Sinaiticus.

Westcott and Hort published &quot;The New Testament in the Original Greek&quot; in 1881 in which they rejected what they considered to be the dated and inadequate &quot;Textus Receptus&quot;. Their text is based mainly on Codex Vaticanus in the Gospels.

== Defense ==
Frederick von Nolan, a 19th-century historian and Greek and Latin scholar, spent 28 years attempting to trace the &quot;Textus Receptus&quot; to apostolic origins. He was an ardent advocate of the supremacy of the &quot;Textus Receptus&quot; over all other editions of the Greek New Testament, and he argued that the first editors of the printed Greek New Testament intentionally selected those texts because of their superiority and disregarded other texts, which represented other text-types because of their inferiority.
It is not to be conceived that the original editors of the [Greek] New Testament were wholly destitute of plan in selecting those manuscripts, out of which they were to form the text of their printed editions. In the sequel it will appear, that they were not altogether ignorant of two classes of manuscripts; one of which contains the text which we have adopted from them; and the other that text which has been adopted by M. Griesbach.
Regarding Erasmus, Nolan stated:

Nor let it be conceived in disparagement of the great undertaking of Erasmus, that he was merely fortuitously right. Had he barely undertaken to perpetuate the tradition on which he received the sacred text he would have done as much as could be required of him, and more than sufficient to put to shame the puny efforts of those who have vainly labored to improve upon his design. [...] With respect to Manuscripts, it is indisputable that he was acquainted with every variety which is known to us, having distributed them into two principal classes, one of which corresponds with the Complutensian edition, the other with the Vatican manuscript. And he has specified the positive grounds on which he received the one and rejected the other. 
The Textus Receptus was defended by John William Burgon in his &quot;The Revision Revised&quot; (1881) and also by Edward Miller in &quot;A Guide to the Textual Criticism of the New Testament&quot; (1886). Burgon supported his arguments with the opinion that the Codex Alexandrinus and Codex Ephraemi were older than the Sinaiticus and the Vaticanus; and also that the Peshitta translation into Syriac (which supports the Byzantine Text) originated in the 2nd century. Miller&#x27;s arguments in favour of readings in the Textus Receptus were of the same kind. However, both Burgon and Miller believed that although the &quot;Textus Receptus&quot; was to be preferred to the Alexandrian Text, it still required to be corrected in certain readings against the manuscript tradition of the Byzantine text. In that judgement, they are criticised by Edward F. Hills, who argues that the principle that God provides truth through scriptural revelation also must imply that God must ensure a preserved transmission of the correct revealed text, continuing into the Reformation era of biblical translation and printing. For Hills, the task of biblical scholarship is to identify the particular line of preserved transmission through which God is acting; a line that he sees in the specific succession of manuscript copying, textual correction and printing, which culminated in the &quot;Textus Receptus&quot; and the King James Bible. Hills argues that the principle of providentially-preserved transmission guarantees that the printed &quot;Textus Receptus&quot; must be the closest text to the Greek autographs and so he rejects readings in the Byzantine Majority Text where they are not maintained in the &quot;Textus Receptus&quot;. He goes so far as to conclude that Erasmus must have been providentially guided when he introduced Latin Vulgate readings into his Greek text; and even argues for the authenticity of the Comma Johanneum.
Hence the true text is found not only in the text of the majority of the New Testament manuscripts but more especially in the Textus Receptus and in faithful translations of the Textus Receptus, such as the King James Version. In short, the Textus Receptus represents the God-guided revision of the majority text. 
Hills was the first textual critic to defend the &quot;Textus Receptus&quot;. Although others have defended it per se, they are not acknowledged textual critics (such as Theodore Letis and David Hocking) or their works are not on a scholarly level (such as Terence H. Brown and D. A. Waite).

=== Providential preservation ===

Those who still advocate the use of the &quot;Textus Receptus&quot; often rely upon a theological stance of supernatural providential preservation, arguing that a reliance upon naturalism to establish the text of the New Testament is contrary to divine revelation. Thus, they have cited passages such as Psalm 12:6–7, Psalm 119:89, Matthew 5:18, Psalm 117:2, Matthew 24:35 and 1 Peter 1:25 as evidence that God would miraculously preserve every single true reading of the Bible. This interpretation, however, has been challenged by critics of the &quot;Textus Receptus&quot; who often assert that these scriptural passages pertain to God&#x27;s oral communication with humanity rather than the written scriptures or to a more general preservation in the New Testament manuscripts as a whole.

== Relationship to Byzantine text ==

The &quot;Textus Receptus&quot; was mainly established on a basis of manuscripts of the Byzantine text-type, also called &#x27;Majority text&#x27;, and usually is identified with it by its followers. However, in addition, over many years, Erasmus had extensively annotated New Testament citations in early Fathers, such as Augustine and Ambrose, whose biblical quotations more frequently conformed to the Western text-type; and he drew extensively on these citations (and also on the Vulgate) in support of his choice of Greek readings.

The &quot;Textus Receptus&quot; differs from the Majority Text edition of Robinson and Pierpont in 1,838 Greek readings, of which 1,005 represent &quot;translatable&quot; differences. Most of these variants are minor, however Byzantine manuscripts usually exclude the Comma Johanneum and Acts 8:37, which are present in the &quot;Textus Receptus&quot;. Despite these differences, printed editions based on the Byzantine text agree far more closely with the Textus Receptus than with the critical text, as the Majority Text disagrees with the critical text 6,577 times in contrast to the 1,838 times it disagrees with the &quot;Textus Receptus&quot;. Additionally, multiple of the agreements between the &quot;Textus Receptus&quot; and the Byzantine text are very significant, such as the reading of &quot;God&quot; in 1 Timothy 3:16 and the inclusion of the Story of the Adulteress. Sometimes the &quot;Textus Receptus&quot; contains readings which are present within the Byzantine text-type, but form a minority therein. This includes the reading &quot;through his blood&quot; in Colossians 1:14, which is contained in around 40% of the Byzantine manuscripts of Colossians, being omitted from the Byzantine critical edition of Robinson and Pierpont and that of Hodges and Farstad.

F. H. A. Scrivener (1813–1891) remarked that at Matt. 22:28; 23:25; 27:52; 28:3, 4, 19, 20; Mark 7:18, 19, 26; 10:1; 12:22; 15:46; Luke 1:16, 61; 2:43; 9:1, 15; 11:49; John 1:28; 10:8; 13:20, Erasmus followed the readings of Minuscule 1 (Caesarean text-type). For Revelation, Erasmus used Minuscule 2814, which follows the Andreas text-type. The Andreas text-type has been called a subtype of the Majority Text in Revelation, which is divided into the Koine form of Revelation and the Andreas type of Revelation.

Dean Burgon, an influential supporter of the &quot;Textus Receptus&quot; declared that it needs correction. He suggested 150 corrections in its Gospel of Matthew alone.

: Matthew 10:8 it has Alexandrian reading νεκροὺς ἐγείρετε (&quot;raise the dead&quot;) omitted by the Byzantine text.
: Acts 20:28 it has Alexandrian reading τοῦ Θεοῦ (&quot;of God&quot;) instead of Byzantine τοῦ Κυρίου καὶ Θεοῦ (&quot;of the Lord and God&quot;).

== Controversial readings ==
The &quot;Textus Receptus&quot; contains many well known variants, such as the Comma Johanneum, Confession of the Ethiopian eunuch, the long ending of Mark, the Pericope Adulterae, the reading &quot;God&quot; in 1 Timothy 3:16 and the reading &quot;book of life&quot; in Revelation 22:19.

=== Comma Johanneum (1 John 5:7) ===
The Comma Johanneum is a Trinitarian text included in 1 John 5:7 within the &quot;Textus Receptus&quot;, however the comma is seen as an interpolation by almost all textual critics. The comma is mainly only attested in the Latin manuscripts of the New Testament, being absent from the vast majority of Greek manuscripts of the New Testament, the earliest Greek manuscript being from the 14th century. It is also totally absent in the Ethiopic, Aramaic, Syriac, Georgian, Arabic and from the early pre-12th century Armenian witnesses to the New Testament. And as a result, modern translations as a whole, both Catholic and Protestant, do not include the comma in the main body of the text.

The text (with the comma in italics and enclosed by brackets) in the King James Bible reads:In the Greek Textus Receptus (TR), the verse reads thus:ὅτι τρεῖς εἰσιν οἱ μαρτυροῦντες εν τῷ οὐρανῷ, ὁ πατήρ, ὁ λόγος, καὶ τὸ Ἅγιον Πνεῦμα· καὶ οὗτοι οἱ τρεῖς ἕν εἰσι.The earliest surviving Latin manuscripts containing the comma date back to the 5th to 7th centuries. These include the Freisinger fragment (6th-7th century), León palimpsest (7th century), besides the younger Codex Speculum (5th century). Its first full appearance in Greek is from the Greek version of the Acts of the Lateran Council in 1215. It subsequently appears in the writings of Emmanuel Calecas (died 1410), Joseph Bryennius (1350 – 1431/38) and in the Orthodox Confession of Moglas (1643). While there are no comprehensive Patristic Greek references to the comma, F.H.A. Scrivener notes potential allusions to it somewhere around the 5th century in two Greek texts: Synopsis of Holy Scripture and the Disputation with Arius from Pseudo-Athanasius. It is only found in a few later Greek manuscripts: 61 (), 629 (14th), 918 (16th century), 2318 (18th century), 2473 (17th century), and in the margins of 88 (11th century with margins added at the 16th century), 177 (BSB Cod. graec. 211), 221 (10th century with margins added at the 15th/16th century), 429 (14th century with margins added at the 16th century), 636 (16th century) and possibly 635 (11th century, added later into the margin).

The Codex Vaticanus in some places contains umlauts to indicate knowledge of variants. Although there has been some debate on the age of these umlauts and if they were added at a later date, according to a paper made by Philip B. Payne, the ink seems to match that of the original scribe. The Codex Vaticanus contains these dots around 1 John 5:7, however according to McDonald, G. R, it is far more likely that the scribe had encountered other variants in the verse than the Johannine comma, which is not attested in Greek manuscripts until the 14th century.

The Johannine comma gained a stronger position within the Latin tradition, especially in the middle ages, being referenced to by Peter Abelard (12th century), Peter Lombard (12th century), Bernard of Clairvaux (12th century), Thomas Aquinas (13th century) and William of Ockham (14th century) among many others. The first undisputed work to quote the Comma Johanneum as an actual part of the Epistle&#x27;s text appears to be the 4th century Latin homily , probably written by Priscillian of Ávila (died 385), or his close follower Bishop Instantius. However some have argued that the 3rd-century Church father Cyprian (died 258) knew of the comma earlier, who in &quot;Unity of the Church 1.6&quot; may have quoted the Johannine comma: &quot;Again it is written of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, &#x27;And these three are one. Nevertheless, other scholars believe that he was giving an allegorical interpretation of the three elements mentioned in the uncontested part of the verse instead of quoting the Johannine comma itself.

=== Confession of the Ethiopian Eunuch (Acts 8:37) ===

The confession of the Ethiopian eunuch is a variant reading in Acts 8:37, widely seen by Textual Critics to be a later interpolation into the text. It is found in the King James Version due to its existence within the Textus Receptus.
It reads in the King James Version as:And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.In the Greek of the &quot;Textus Receptus&quot;, the verse reads:ειπεν δε ο φιλιππος ει πιστευεις εξ ολης της καρδιας εξεστιν αποκριθεις δε ειπεν πιστευω τον υιον του θεου ειναι τον ιησουν χριστονErasmus himself decided to include the verse in his edition of the Greek text due to its presence in the Latin Vulgate of his day and due to being in the margin of Minuscule 2816 (15th century), which he used in his compilation of the &quot;Textus Receptus&quot;. The reading is quoted by many western early Christian writers, such as Ireaneus (130 – c. 202), Cyprian (210 – 258), Ambrose (339 – 397) and Augustine (354 – 430). The verse is found in the Codex Glazier (4-5th century), the Harclensis Syriac (7th century), some Old Latin and Vulgate manuscripts alongside some Ethiopian, Georgian and Armenian manuscripts. Nevertheless, the earliest Greek manuscript to contain the verse is Codex Laudianus (550ad) and it is not found in 𝔓45 (250ad), 𝔓74 (7th century), Codex Sinaiticus (4th century), Vaticanus (4th century). Alexandrinus (5th century), Ephraemi Rescriptus (5th century), Codex Athous Lavrensis (8th-9th century) and a multitude of other codices and cursives.

=== Pericope Adulterae (John 7:53-8:11) ===
The Pericope Adulterae is a passage found in John 7:53-8:11. It is viewed by most New Testament scholars as an interpolation, including Evangelical scholars. The pericope does not occur in the earliest Greek manuscripts discovered in Egypt. The Pericope Adulterae is not in 𝔓66 or in 𝔓75, both of which have been assigned to the late 100s or early 200s, nor in two important manuscripts produced in the early or mid 300s, Sinaiticus and Vaticanus. The first surviving Greek manuscript to contain the pericope is the Latin-Greek diglot Codex Bezae, produced in the 400s. The Codex Bezae is also the earliest surviving Latin manuscript to contain it. Out of 23 Old Latin manuscripts of John 7–8, seventeen contain at least part of the pericope, and represent at least three transmission-streams in which it was included.Alongside the Old Latin manuscripts, the Pericope Adulterae is found in most Byzantine text-type manuscripts, Palestinian Syriac manuscripts, the Latin Vulgate and some Armenian manuscripts. The earliest Greek writing to explicitly reference the passage is the Didascalia Apostolorum (3rd century). The passage is later referenced to in Greek by Didymus the Blind (4th century) alongside the Apostolic Constitutions (4th century), the Synopsis Scripturae Sacrae (6th century) and the 6th century canon tables of the Monastery of Saint Epiphanus. Additionally, some manuscripts such as Codex Regius (8th century) and Codex Sangallensis (9th century) contain a large gap after John 7:52, thus indicating knowledge of the passage despite being omitted. Due to its presence within most manuscripts within the Byzantine text-type, it is also a characteristic of Byzantine printed editions of the New Testament such as the texts of Maurice A. Robinson &amp; William G. Pierpont and The Greek New Testament According to the Majority Text (Hodges-Farstad).

There is now a broad academic consensus that the passage is a later interpolation added after the earliest known manuscripts of the Gospel of John. This has been the view of &quot;most NT scholars, including most &quot;evangelical&quot; NT scholars, for well over a century&quot;. Bishop J. B. Lightfoot wrote that absence of the passage from the earliest manuscripts, combined with the occurrence of stylistic characteristics atypical of John, together implied that the passage was an interpolation. Nevertheless, he considered the story to be authentic history. Bart D. Ehrman concurs in &quot;Misquoting Jesus&quot;, adding that the passage contains many words and phrases otherwise alien to John&#x27;s writing. The evangelical Bible scholar Daniel B. Wallace agrees with Ehrman. However, advocates of the Byzantine priority theory and those who view the Textus Receptus as the most accurate text have attempted to argue for the Johannine authorship of the story. They have argued that there are points of similarity between the pericope&#x27;s style and the style of the rest of the gospel, saying that anomalies in the transmission of the Pericope Adulterae may be explained by the Lectionary system, where due to the Pericope Adulterae being skipped during the Pentecost lesson, some scribes would relocate or omit the story to not interviene with the flow of the Pentecost lesson.

=== Book of life (Revelation 22:19) ===
The Textus Receptus in Revelation 22:19 reads &quot;book of life&quot; instead of the Nestle-Aland reading &quot;tree of life&quot;, which the &quot;Textus Receptus&quot; contains on the grounds of the Latin Vulgate (380ad) reading, however it is also attested within the scriptural quotations of Ambrose (339 – 4 April 397) and in some Coptic manuscripts. Modern textual critics see the Latin Vulgate reading which found its way into the &quot;Textus Receptus&quot; as a typo caused by the similarity of the Latin words for book &quot;libro&quot; and tree &quot;ligno&quot;.

=== Fellowship (Ephesians 3:9) ===
The Textus Receptus contains a unique reading &quot;fellowship&quot; (koinonia) instead of &quot;administration&quot; (oikonomia) in Ephesians 3:9. This variant is found in 10% of the Greek manuscripts of Ephesians alongside its inclusion in the &quot;Textus Receptus&quot;. It is missing from the Sinaiaticus (4th century), Vaticanus (4th century), Alexandrinus (5th century) and Papyrus 46 (3rd century).

=== The longer ending of Mark (Mark 16:9-20) ===
Mark 16:9-20 or the longer ending of Mark is a variant found within the &quot;Textus Receptus&quot; which has generally been assumed to have been a later addition into the text by modern textual critics. The earliest extant complete manuscripts of Mark, Codex Sinaiticus and Codex Vaticanus, two 4th-century manuscripts, do not contain the last twelve verses, 16:9–20. It is also omitted by one Syriac manuscript, the Syriac Sinaiticus (4th century) and one Old Latin manuscript, the Codex Bobbiensis (430ad). It is also missing from some Georgian and Armenian manuscripts and is omitted by Eusebius of Caesarea (4th century), Hesychius of Jerusalem (5th century), Severus of Antioch (5th century) and possibly Origen (3rd century).

It is included in the Majority/Byzantine Text (over 1,500 manuscripts of Mark), Family 13, Codex Alexandrinus (5th century), Codex Bezae (5th century), Codex Ephraemi (5th century), Codex Koridethi (9th century), Athous Lavrensis (9th century), Codex Sangallensis 48 (9th century), minuscules: 33, 565, 700, 892, 2674. The Vulgate (380ad) and most of the Old Latin, Syriac Curetonian (5th century), Peshitta (5th century), Bohairic, most Sahidic, Gothic (4th century) and the Harklean Syriac (600ad). The passage is also cited by the Epistula Apostolorum (120-140ad), possibly Justin Martyr (160ad), Diatessaron (160–175 AD), Irenaeus (180ad), Hippolytus (died 235ad), Vincentius of Thibaris (256ad), De Rebaptismate (258ad), Acts of Pilate (4th century), Fortunatianus (350ad) and the Apostolic Constitutions (4th century)

Due to its presence within most manuscripts within the Byzantine text-type, it is also a characteristic of Byzantine printed editions of the New Testament such as the texts of Maurice A. Robinson &amp; Willia1 Timothy 3:16m G. Pierpont, The Greek New Testament According to the Majority Text (Hodges-Farstad) and the Eastern Orthodox Patriarchal text.

=== God was manifest in the flesh (1 Timothy 3:16) ===

One noteworthy variant within the &quot;Textus Receptus&quot; is the reading &quot;God&quot; (theos) in 1 Timothy 3:16, as it concerns a very important theological point. This reading is not found in the earliest manuscripts known today, which instead read &quot;who&quot; (hos), which is why modern versions do not contain the word &quot;God&quot; in this verse.

The reading &quot;God&quot; is supported most Byzantine text-type manuscripts, Codex Athous Lavrensis (8th century), Minuscule 81 (11th century), Minuscule 1739 (10th century), Minuscule 614 (13th century), Gregory of Nyssa (4th century), Didymus (4th century), John Chrysostom (4th century), Euthalius (4th century) and Theodoret (5th century), while the reading &quot;who&quot; is found in the Codex Sinaiaticus (4th century), Alexandrinus (5th century), Ephraemi Rescriptus (5th century), Gothic manuscripts, Jerome (4th century), Origen (3rd century) and Epiphanus (4th century). Although the Sinaiticus, Alexandrinus and Ephraemi Rescriptus were corrected by later scribes to add the reading &quot;theos&quot;.

=== It is hard for thee to kick against the pricks (Acts 9:5-6) ===
The reading &quot;It is hard for thee to kick against the pricks&quot; is found in the &quot;Textus Receptus&quot; in Acts 9:5, which is lacking in most Greek manuscripts. Erasmus admitted himself that these words were not found in the Greek manuscripts he had access to, however decided to include the words due to their presence in the Latin Vulgate. These words are found in verse 4 instead of verse 5 in two Greek manuscripts: 431 and Codex Laudianus. They are also found in the Palestinian Syriac manuscripts alongside in the writings of Augustine and Petilianus. While these words are found in verse 5 as in the &quot;Textus Receptus&quot; in the Vetus Latina manuscripts, Vulgate manuscripts and in the writings of Ambrose (339 – 4 April 397) and Lucifer of Cagliari (died 370ad).

After these words, the &quot;Textus Receptus&quot; contains the reading &quot;And he trembling and astonished said, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? And the Lord said unto him&quot;. These words are found found in the 7th century Harclean Syriac version, the Latin Vulgate, Vetus Latina manuscripts alongside the 4th or 5th century Coptic Codex Glazier. However, there are no extant Greek manuscripts today to include these words.

Some such as Clark have argued that the words &quot;It is hard for thee to kick against the pricks&quot; should be included in Acts 9 because they fit Lukan style more accurately. Nevertheless, Bruce M. Metzger has argued that these words are more likely added by copyists trying to harmonize Acts 9 later accounts of Paul&#x27;s conversion.

=== Other controversial readings ===
== Variants within the Textus Receptus editions ==
Although the &quot;Textus Receptus&quot; tradition is very uniform, there are some variants between the different editions of the &quot;Textus Receptus&quot;. There are around 283 differences between the editions of Scrivener and Stephanus, while the number is 190 between the editions Scrivener and Beza. Most of these variants are insignificant, and often deal with spelling differences, word order or other minor differences.

The following examples are from F.H.A Scrivener, who listed the variants between the &quot;Textus Receptus&quot; editions:

* Beza adds &quot;de&quot; after &quot;husteron&quot;, which is lacking in the text of Stephanus in Mark 1:21´.
* Beza reads &quot;kaleseis&quot; instead of &quot;kalesousi&quot; in Matthew 1:23. Beza&#x27;s reading is only supported by Codex D.
* Unlike Stephanus, Beza includes the words &quot;tou theou&quot; after &quot;agapen&quot; in 1 John 3:16. This reading is also found in the Complutensian Polyglot.
* Beza omits the word &quot;hoti&quot; in Matthew 9:33, which is found in the text of Stephanus.
* Stephanus includes the word &quot;amen&quot; at the end of Mark 16:20, which is also omitted by Beza and Erasmus. This reading is found in the Complutensian Polyglot.
* Beza and Elzevir read &quot;apothanontos&quot;, while Stephanus reads &quot;apothanontes&quot; in Romans 7:6. The reading of Beza has been proposed to have been supported by John Chrysostom (347 – 14 September 407), but it is absent from the existing Greek manuscripts. However Beza&#x27;s argument that Chrysostom&#x27;s manuscript included the reading &quot;apothanontos&quot; has been disputed as being a misinterpretation of his commentary, as there are places where Chrysostom&#x27;s commentaries contain the common Greek reading of &quot;apothanontes&quot;. Beza argued that later authors had interpolated the reading into Chrysostom&#x27;s commentary.

<text>A joint or articulation (or articular surface) is the connection made between bones, ossicles, or other hard structures in the body which link an animal&#x27;s skeletal system into a functional whole. They are constructed to allow for different degrees and types of movement. Some joints, such as the knee, elbow, and shoulder, are self-lubricating, almost frictionless, and are able to withstand compression and maintain heavy loads while still executing smooth and precise movements. Other joints such as sutures between the bones of the skull permit very little movement (only during birth) in order to protect the brain and the sense organs. The connection between a tooth and the jawbone is also called a joint, and is described as a fibrous joint known as a gomphosis. Joints are classified both structurally and functionally.

Joints play a vital role in the human body, contributing to movement, stability, and overall function. They are essential for mobility and flexibility, connecting bones and facilitating a wide range of motions, from simple bending and stretching to complex actions like running and jumping. Beyond enabling movement, joints provide structural support and stability to the skeleton, helping to maintain posture, balance, and the ability to bear weight during daily activities.

The clinical significance of joints is highlighted by common disorders that affect their health and function. Osteoarthritis, a degenerative joint disease, involves the breakdown of cartilage, leading to pain, stiffness, and reduced mobility. Rheumatoid arthritis, an autoimmune disorder, causes chronic inflammation in the joints, often resulting in swelling, pain, and potential deformity. Another prevalent condition, gout, arises from the accumulation of uric acid crystals in the joints, triggering severe pain and inflammation.

Joints also hold diagnostic importance, as their condition can indicate underlying health issues. Symptoms such as joint pain and swelling may signal inflammatory diseases, infections, or metabolic disorders. Effective treatment and management of joint-related conditions often require a multifaceted approach, including physical therapy, medications, lifestyle changes, and, in severe cases, surgical interventions. Preventive care, such as regular exercise, a balanced diet, and avoiding excessive strain, is critical for maintaining joint health, preventing disorders, and improving overall quality of life.

==Classification==

The number of joints depends on if sesamoids are included, age of the human and the definition of joints. However, the number of sesamoids is the same in most people with variations being rare.

Joints are mainly classified structurally and functionally. Structural classification is determined by how the bones connect to each other, while functional classification is determined by the degree of movement between the articulating bones. In practice, there is significant overlap between the two types of classifications.

===Clinical, numerical classification===
*monoarticular – concerning one joint
*oligoarticular or pauciarticular – concerning 2–4 joints
*polyarticular – concerning 5 or more joints

=== Structural classification (binding tissue)===

Structural classification names and divides joints according to the type of binding tissue that connects the bones to each other. There are four structural classifications of joints:
* fibrous joint – joined by dense regular connective tissue that is rich in collagen fibers
* cartilaginous joint – joined by cartilage. There are two types: primary cartilaginous joints composed of hyaline cartilage, and secondary cartilaginous joints composed of hyaline cartilage covering the articular surfaces of the involved bones with fibrocartilage connecting them.
* synovial joint – not directly joined – the bones have a synovial cavity and are united by the dense irregular connective tissue that forms the articular capsule that is normally associated with accessory ligaments.
* facet joint – joint between two articular processes between two vertebrae.

===Functional classification (movement)===
Joints can also be classified functionally according to the type and degree of movement they allow: Joint movements are described with reference to the basic anatomical planes.
* synarthrosis – permits little or no mobility. Most synarthrosis joints are fibrous joints, such as skull sutures. This lack of mobility is important, because the skull bones serve to protect the brain.
* amphiarthrosis – permits slight mobility. Most amphiarthrosis joints are cartilaginous joints. An example is the intervertebral disc. Individual intervertebral discs allow for small movements between adjacent vertebrae, but when added together, the vertebral column provides the flexibility that allows the body to twist, or bend to the front, back, or side.
* synovial joint (also known as a &quot;diarthrosis&quot;) – freely movable. Synovial joints can in turn be classified into six groups according to the type of movement they allow: plane joint, ball and socket joint, hinge joint, pivot joint, condyloid joint and saddle joint.
Joints can also be classified, according to the number of axes of movement they allow, into nonaxial (gliding, as between the proximal ends of the ulna and radius), monoaxial (uniaxial), biaxial and multiaxial. Another classification is according to the degrees of freedom allowed, and distinguished between joints with one, two or three degrees of freedom. A further classification is according to the number and shapes of the articular surfaces: flat, concave and convex surfaces. Types of articular surfaces include surfaces.

===Biomechanical classification===
Joints can also be classified based on their anatomy or on their biomechanical properties. According to the anatomic classification, joints are subdivided into &quot;simple&quot; and &quot;compound&quot;, depending on the number of bones involved, and into &quot;complex&quot; and &quot;combination&quot; joints:
# Simple joint: two articulation surfaces (e.g. shoulder joint, hip joint)
# Compound joint: three or more articulation surfaces (e.g. radiocarpal joint)
# Complex joint: two or more articulation surfaces and an articular disc or meniscus (e.g. knee joint)

===Anatomical=== 

The joints may be classified anatomically into the following groups:
# Joints of hand
# Elbow joints
# Wrist joints
# Axillary joints
# Sternoclavicular joints
# Vertebral articulations
# Temporomandibular joints
# Sacroiliac joints
# Hip joints
# Knee joints
# Articulations of foot

Unmyelinated nerve fibers are abundant in joint capsules and ligaments, as well as in the outer part of intra-articular menisci. These nerve fibers are responsible for pain perception when a joint is strained.

==Clinical significance==

Damaging the cartilage of joints (articular cartilage) or the bones and muscles that stabilize the joints can lead to joint dislocations and osteoarthritis. Swimming is a great way to exercise the joints with minimal damage.

A joint disorder is termed arthropathy, and when involving inflammation of one or more joints the disorder is called arthritis. Most joint disorders involve arthritis, but joint damage by external physical trauma is typically not termed arthritis.

Arthropathies are called &quot;polyarticular&quot; (multiarticular) when involving many joints and &quot;monoarticular&quot; when involving only a single joint.

Arthritis is the leading cause of disability in people over the age of 55. There are many different forms of arthritis, each of which has a different cause. The most common form of arthritis, osteoarthritis (also known as degenerative joint disease), occurs following trauma to the joint, following an infection of the joint or simply as a result of aging and the deterioration of articular cartilage. Furthermore, there is emerging evidence that abnormal anatomy may contribute to early development of osteoarthritis. Other forms of arthritis are rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis, which are autoimmune diseases in which the body is attacking itself. Septic arthritis is caused by joint infection. Gouty arthritis is caused by deposition of uric acid crystals in the joint that results in subsequent inflammation. Additionally, there is a less common form of gout that is caused by the formation of rhomboidal-shaped crystals of calcium pyrophosphate. This form of gout is known as pseudogout.

Temporomandibular joint syndrome (TMJ) involves the jaw joints and can cause facial pain, clicking sounds in the jaw, or limitation of jaw movement, to name a few symptoms. It is caused by psychological tension and misalignment of the jaw (malocclusion), and may be affecting as many as 75 million Americans.

==History==

===Etymology===
The English word &quot;joint&quot; is a past participle of the verb &quot;join&quot;, and can be read as &quot;joined&quot;. Joint is derived from Latin &quot;iunctus&quot;, past participle of the Latin verb &quot;iungere&quot;, join, unite, connect, attach.

The English term &quot;articulation&quot; is derived from Latin &quot;articulatio&quot;.

Humans have also developed lighter, more fragile joint bones over time due to the decrease in physical activity compared to thousands of years ago.

<text>Italian tourist Orfeo Bartolini, 51, was murdered in Afghanistan in April 2003.

Bartolini left his home in Rimini, Italy on March 17, 2003, and set out on by motorcycle for India, where he planned to visit the tomb of Mother Teresa.

On April 10, his motorcycle broke down in the Shahjoi district of Zabul province, Afghanistan. He hired a car to take him to Kabul. On the way, the car was stopped by two men on a motorbike, who then shot Bartolini.

Though the area was a known stronghold of the Taliban, looking to regroup following their removal as leaders of the Afghan government by American and allied forces, Italian ambassador Dominico Georgi originally declared that robbery may be the cause of Bartolini&#x27;s murder. However, as the Italian&#x27;s Afghan driver was unhurt in the attack and no robbery was reported, Taliban dissidents remained the chief suspects. The week after the killing, eight Taliban fighters were captured by Afghan soldiers investigating Bartolini&#x27;s murder in the Sur Ghar area of the country.

<doc id="210244" wikidata="Q77144" url="?curid=210244" title="Leo Strauss">
<text>Leo Strauss (September 20, 1899 – October 18, 1973) was an American scholar of political philosophy. Born in Germany to Jewish parents, Strauss later emigrated from Germany to the United States. He spent much of his career as a professor of political science at the University of Chicago, where he taught several generations of students and published fifteen books.

Trained in the neo-Kantian tradition with Ernst Cassirer and immersed in the work of the phenomenologists Edmund Husserl and Martin Heidegger, Strauss authored books on Spinoza and Hobbes, and articles on Maimonides and Al-Farabi. In the late 1930s, his research focused on the texts of Plato and Aristotle, retracing their interpretation through medieval Islamic and Jewish philosophy, and encouraging the application of those ideas to contemporary political theory.

== Biography ==
=== Early life and education===
Strauss was born on September 20, 1899, in the small town of Kirchhain in Hesse-Nassau, a province of the Kingdom of Prussia (part of the German Empire), to Hugo Strauss and Jennie Strauss, née David. According to Allan Bloom&#x27;s 1974 obituary in &quot;Political Theory&quot;, Strauss &quot;was raised as an Orthodox Jew&quot;, but the family does not appear to have completely embraced Orthodox practice. Strauss himself noted that he came from a &quot;conservative, even orthodox Jewish home&quot;, but one which knew little about Judaism except strict adherence to ceremonial laws. His father and uncle operated a farm supply and livestock business that they inherited from their father, Meyer (1835–1919), a leading member of the local Jewish community.

After attending the Kirchhain Volksschule and the Protestant Rektoratsschule, Leo Strauss was enrolled at the Gymnasium Philippinum (affiliated with the University of Marburg) in nearby Marburg (from which Johannes Althusius and Carl Joachim Friedrich also graduated) in 1912, graduating in 1917. He boarded with the Marburg cantor Strauss (no relation), whose residence served as a meeting place for followers of the neo-Kantian philosopher Hermann Cohen. Strauss served in the German army from World War I from July 5, 1917, to December 1918.

Strauss subsequently enrolled in the University of Hamburg, where he received his doctorate in 1921; his thesis, &quot;On the Problem of Knowledge in the Philosophical Doctrine of F. H. Jacobi&quot; (&quot;Das Erkenntnisproblem in der philosophischen Lehre Fr. H. Jacobis&quot;), was supervised by Ernst Cassirer. He also attended courses at the Universities of Freiburg and Marburg, including some taught by Edmund Husserl and Martin Heidegger. Strauss joined a Jewish fraternity and worked for the German Zionist movement, which introduced him to various German Jewish intellectuals, such as Norbert Elias, Leo Löwenthal, Hannah Arendt and Walter Benjamin. Benjamin was and remained an admirer of Strauss and his work throughout his life.

Strauss&#x27;s closest friend was Jacob Klein but he also was intellectually engaged with Gerhard Krüger—and also Karl Löwith, Julius Guttmann, Hans-Georg Gadamer, and Franz Rosenzweig (to whom Strauss dedicated his first book), as well as Gershom Scholem, Alexander Altmann, and the Arabist Paul Kraus, who married Strauss&#x27;s sister Bettina (Strauss and his wife later adopted Paul and Bettina Kraus&#x27;s child when both parents died in the Middle East). With several of these friends, Strauss carried on vigorous epistolary exchanges later in life, many of which are published in the &quot;Gesammelte Schriften&quot; (&quot;Collected Writings&quot;), some in translation from the German. Strauss had also been engaged in a discourse with Carl Schmitt. However, after Strauss left Germany, he broke off the discourse when Schmitt failed to respond to his letters.

=== Career ===
After receiving a Rockefeller Fellowship in 1932, Strauss left his position at the Higher Institute for Jewish Studies in Berlin for Paris. He returned to Germany only once, for a few short days twenty years later. In Paris, he married Marie (Miriam) Bernsohn, a widow with a young child, whom he had known previously in Germany. He adopted his wife&#x27;s son, Thomas, and later his sister&#x27;s child, Jenny Strauss Clay (later a professor of classics at the University of Virginia); he and Miriam had no biological children of their own. At his death, he was survived by Thomas, Jenny Strauss Clay, and three grandchildren. Strauss became a lifelong friend of Alexandre Kojève and was on friendly terms with Raymond Aron and Étienne Gilson. Because of the Nazis&#x27; rise to power, he chose not to return to his native country. Strauss found shelter, after some vicissitudes, in England, where, in 1935 he gained temporary employment at the University of Cambridge with the help of his in-law David Daube, who was affiliated with Gonville and Caius College. While in England, he became a close friend of R. H. Tawney and was on less friendly terms with Isaiah Berlin.

Unable to find permanent employment in England, Strauss moved to the United States in 1937, under the patronage of Harold Laski, who made introductions and helped him obtain a brief lectureship. After a short stint as a research fellow in the Department of History at Columbia University, Strauss secured a position at The New School, where, between 1938 and 1948, he worked in the political science faculty and also took on adjunct jobs. In 1939, he served for a short term as a visiting professor at Hamilton College. He became a U.S. citizen in 1944, and in 1949 became a professor of political science at the University of Chicago, holding the Robert Maynard Hutchins Distinguished Service Professorship until he left in 1969.

In 1953, Strauss coined the phrase &quot;reductio ad Hitlerum&quot;, a play on &quot;reductio ad absurdum&quot;, suggesting that comparing an argument to one of Hitler&#x27;s, or &quot;playing the Nazi card&quot;, is often a fallacy of irrelevance.

In 1954, he met Karl Löwith and Hans-Georg Gadamer in Heidelberg and delivered a public speech on Socrates. He had received a call for a temporary lectureship in Hamburg in 1965 (which he declined for health reasons) and received and accepted an honorary doctorate from the University of Hamburg and the German Order of Merit via the German representative in Chicago. In 1969, Strauss moved to Claremont McKenna College (formerly Claremont Men&#x27;s College) in California for a year, and then to St. John&#x27;s College, Annapolis in 1970, where he was the Scott Buchanan Distinguished Scholar in Residence until his death from pneumonia in 1973. He was buried in Annapolis Hebrew Cemetery, with his wife Miriam Bernsohn Strauss, who died in 1985. Psalm 114 was read in the funeral service at the request of family and friends.

==Thought== 
Strauss&#x27;s thought can be characterized by two main themes: the critique of modernity and the recovery of classical political philosophy. He argued that modernity, which emerged among the 15th century Italian city states particularly in the writings of Niccolò Machiavelli, was a radical break from the tradition of Western civilization, and that it led to a crisis of nihilism, relativism, historicism, and scientism. He claimed that modern political and social sciences, which were based on empirical observation and rational analysis, failed to grasp the essential questions of human nature, morality, and justice, and that they reduced human beings to mere objects of manipulation and calculation. He also criticized modern liberalism, which he saw as a product of modernity, for its lack of moral and spiritual foundations, and for its tendency to undermine the authority of religion, tradition, and natural law.

To overcome the crisis of modernity, Strauss proposed a return to the classical political philosophy of the ancient Greeks and the medieval thinkers, who he believed had a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of human nature and society. He advocated a careful and respectful reading of the classical texts, arguing that their authors wrote in an esoteric manner, which he called &quot;the art of writing&quot;. He suggested that the classical authors hid their true teachings behind a surface layer of conventional opinions, in order to avoid persecution and to educate only the few who were capable of grasping them, and that they engaged in a dialogue with each other across the ages. Strauss called this dialogue &quot;the great conversation&quot;, and invited his readers to join it.

Strauss&#x27;s interpretation of the classical political philosophy was influenced by his own Jewish background and his encounter with Islamic and Jewish medieval philosophy, especially the works of Al-Farabi and Maimonides. He argued that these philosophers, who lived under the rule of Islam, faced similar challenges as the ancient Greeks. He also claimed that these philosophers, who were both faithful to their revealed religions and loyal to the rational pursuit of philosophy, offered a model of how to reconcile reason and revelation, philosophy and theology, Athens and Jerusalem.

== Views ==
=== Philosophy ===
For Strauss, politics and philosophy were necessarily intertwined. He regarded the trial and death of Socrates as the moment when political philosophy came into existence. Strauss considered one of the most important moments in the history of philosophy Socrates&#x27; argument that philosophers could not study nature without considering their own human nature, which, in the words of Aristotle, is that of &quot;a political animal.&quot; However, he also held that the ends of politics and philosophy were inherently irreconcilable and irreducible to one another.

Strauss distinguished &quot;scholars&quot; from &quot;great thinkers,&quot; identifying himself as a scholar. He wrote that most self-described philosophers are in actuality scholars, cautious and methodical. Great thinkers, in contrast, boldly and creatively address big problems. Scholars deal with these problems only indirectly by reasoning about the great thinkers&#x27; differences.

In &quot;Natural Right and History&quot;, Strauss begins with a critique of Max Weber&#x27;s epistemology, briefly engages the relativism of Martin Heidegger (who goes unnamed) and continues with a discussion of the evolution of natural rights via an analysis of the thought of Thomas Hobbes and John Locke. He concludes by critiquing Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Edmund Burke. At the heart of the book are excerpts from Plato, Aristotle, and Cicero. Much of his philosophy is a reaction to the works of Heidegger. Indeed, Strauss wrote that Heidegger&#x27;s thinking must be understood and confronted before any complete formulation of modern political theory is possible, and this means that political thought has to engage with issues of ontology and the history of metaphysics.

Strauss wrote that Friedrich Nietzsche was the first philosopher to properly understand historicism, an idea grounded in a general acceptance of Hegelian philosophy of history. Heidegger, in Strauss&#x27;s view, sanitized and politicized Nietzsche, whereas Nietzsche believed &quot;our own principles, including the belief in progress, will become as unconvincing and alien as all earlier principles (essences) had shown themselves to be&quot; and &quot;the only way out seems to be ... that one voluntarily choose life-giving delusion instead of deadly truth, that one fabricate a myth.&quot; Heidegger believed that the tragic nihilism of Nietzsche was itself a &quot;myth&quot; guided by a defective Western conception of Being that Heidegger traced to Plato. In his published correspondence with Alexandre Kojève, Strauss wrote that Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel was correct when he postulated that an end of history implies an end to philosophy as understood by classical political philosophy.

=== On reading ===
In the late 1930s, Strauss called for the first time for a reconsideration of the &quot;distinction between exoteric (or public) and esoteric (or secret) teaching.&quot; In 1952 he published &quot;Persecution and the Art of Writing&quot;, arguing that serious writers write esoterically, that is, with multiple or layered meanings, often disguised within irony or paradox, obscure references, even deliberate self-contradiction. Esoteric writing serves several purposes: protecting the philosopher from the retribution of the regime, and protecting the regime from the corrosion of philosophy; it attracts the right kind of reader and repels the wrong kind; and ferreting out the interior message is in itself an exercise of philosophic reasoning. 

Taking his bearings from his study of Maimonides and Al-Farabi, and pointing further back to Plato&#x27;s discussion of writing as contained in the &quot;Phaedrus&quot;, Strauss proposed that the classical and medieval art of &quot;esoteric&quot; writing is the proper medium for philosophic learning: rather than displaying philosophers&#x27; thoughts superficially, classical and medieval philosophical texts guide their readers in thinking and learning independently of imparted knowledge. Thus, Strauss agrees with the Socrates of the &quot;Phaedrus&quot;, where the Greek indicates that, insofar as writing does not respond when questioned, good writing provokes questions in the reader—questions that orient the reader towards an understanding of problems the author thought about with utmost seriousness. Strauss thus, in &quot;Persecution and the Art of Writing&quot;, presents Maimonides &quot;as a closet nonbeliever obfuscating his message for political reasons&quot;.

Strauss&#x27;s hermeneutical argument—rearticulated throughout his subsequent writings (most notably in &quot;The City and Man&quot; [1964])—is that, before the 19th century, Western scholars commonly understood that philosophical writing is not at home in any polity, no matter how liberal. Insofar as it questions conventional wisdom at its roots, philosophy must guard itself especially against those readers who believe themselves authoritative, wise, and liberal defenders of the status quo. In questioning established opinions, or in investigating the principles of morality, philosophers of old found it necessary to convey their messages in an oblique manner. Their &quot;art of writing&quot; was the art of esoteric communication. This was especially apparent in medieval times when heterodox political thinkers wrote under the threat of the Inquisition or comparably obtuse tribunals.

Strauss&#x27;s argument is not that the medieval writers he studies reserved one exoteric meaning for the many (hoi polloi) and an esoteric, hidden one for the few (hoi oligoi), but that, through rhetorical stratagems including self-contradiction and hyperboles, these writers succeeded in conveying their proper meaning at the tacit heart of their writings—a heart or message irreducible to &quot;the letter&quot; or historical dimension of texts.

Explicitly following Gotthold Ephraim Lessing&#x27;s lead, Strauss indicates that medieval political philosophers, no less than their ancient counterparts, carefully adapted their wording to the dominant moral views of their time, lest their writings be condemned as heretical or unjust, not by &quot;the many&quot; (who did not read), but by those &quot;few&quot; whom the many regarded as the most righteous guardians of morality. It was precisely these righteous personalities who would be most inclined to persecute/ostracize anyone who was in the business of exposing the noble or great lie upon which the authority of the few over the many stands or falls.

=== On politics ===
According to Strauss, modern social science is flawed because it assumes the fact–value distinction, a concept which Strauss found dubious. He traced its roots in Enlightenment philosophy to Max Weber, a thinker whom Strauss described as a &quot;serious and noble mind&quot;. Weber wanted to separate values from science but, according to Strauss, was really a derivative thinker, deeply influenced by Nietzsche&#x27;s relativism. Strauss treated politics as something that could not be studied from afar. A political scientist examining politics with a value-free scientific eye, for Strauss, was self-deluded. Positivism, the heir to both Auguste Comte and Max Weber in the quest to make purportedly value-free judgments, failed to justify its own existence, which would require a value judgment.

While modern-era liberalism had stressed the pursuit of individual liberty as its highest goal, Strauss felt that there should be a greater interest in the problem of human excellence and political virtue. Through his writings, Strauss constantly raised the question of how, and to what extent, freedom and excellence can coexist. Strauss refused to make do with any simplistic or one-sided resolutions of the Socratic question: &quot;What is the good for the city and man?&quot;

=== Encounters with Carl Schmitt and Alexandre Kojève ===
Two significant political-philosophical dialogues Strauss had with living thinkers were those he held with Carl Schmitt and Alexandre Kojève. Schmitt, who would later become, for a short time, the chief jurist of Nazi Germany, was one of the first important German academics to review Strauss&#x27;s early work positively. Schmitt&#x27;s positive reference for, and approval of, Strauss&#x27;s work on Hobbes was instrumental in winning Strauss the scholarship funding that allowed him to leave Germany.

Strauss&#x27;s critique and clarifications of &quot;The Concept of the Political&quot; led Schmitt to make significant emendations in its second edition. Writing to Schmitt in 1932, Strauss summarised Schmitt&#x27;s political theology that &quot;because man is by nature evil, he, therefore, needs &quot; dominion&quot;. But dominion can be established, that is, men can be unified only in a unity against—against other men. Every association of men is necessarily a separation from other men ... the political thus understood is not the constitutive principle of the state, of order, but a condition of the state.&quot;

Strauss, however, directly opposed Schmitt&#x27;s position. For Strauss, Schmitt and his return to Thomas Hobbes helpfully clarified the nature of our political existence and our modern self-understanding. Schmitt&#x27;s position was therefore symptomatic of the modern-era liberal self-understanding. Strauss believed that such an analysis, as in Hobbes&#x27;s time, served as a useful &quot;preparatory action,&quot; revealing our contemporary orientation towards the eternal problems of politics (social existence). However, Strauss believed that Schmitt&#x27;s reification of our modern self-understanding of the problem of politics into a political theology was not an adequate solution. Strauss instead advocated a return to a broader classical understanding of human nature and a tentative return to political philosophy, in the tradition of the ancient philosophers.

With Kojève, Strauss had a close and lifelong philosophical friendship. They had first met as students in Berlin. The two thinkers shared boundless philosophical respect for each other. Kojève would later write that, without befriending Strauss, &quot;I never would have known ... what philosophy is&quot;. The political-philosophical dispute between Kojève and Strauss centered on the role that philosophy should and can be allowed to play in politics.

Kojève, a senior civil servant in the French government, was instrumental in the creation of the European Economic Community. He argued that philosophers should have an active role in shaping political events. Strauss, on the contrary, believed that philosophers should play a role in politics only to the extent that they can ensure that philosophy, which he saw as mankind&#x27;s highest activity, can be free from political intervention.

=== Liberalism and nihilism ===
Strauss argued that liberalism in its modern form (which is oriented toward universal freedom as opposed to &quot;ancient liberalism&quot; which is oriented toward human excellence), contained within it an intrinsic tendency towards extreme relativism, which in turn led to two types of nihilism:

* The first was a &quot;brutal&quot; nihilism, expressed in Nazi and Bolshevik regimes. In &quot;On Tyranny&quot;, he wrote that these ideologies, both descendants of Enlightenment thought, tried to destroy all traditions, history, ethics, and moral standards and replace them by force under which nature and mankind are subjugated and conquered.
* The second type—the &quot;gentle&quot; nihilism expressed in Western liberal democracies—was a kind of value-free aimlessness and a hedonistic &quot;permissive egalitarianism,&quot; which he saw as permeating the fabric of contemporary American society.

In the belief that 20th-century relativism, scientism, historicism, and nihilism were all implicated in the deterioration of modern society and philosophy, Strauss sought to uncover the philosophical pathways that had led to this situation. The resultant study led him to advocate a tentative return to classical political philosophy as a starting point for judging political action.

=== Strauss&#x27;s interpretation of Plato&#x27;s &quot;Republic&quot; ===
According to Strauss, the &quot;Republic&quot; by Plato is not &quot;a blueprint for regime reform&quot; (a play on words from Karl Popper&#x27;s &quot;The Open Society and Its Enemies&quot;, which attacks &quot;The Republic&quot; for being just that). Strauss quotes Cicero: &quot;&quot;The Republic&quot; does not bring to light the best possible regime but rather the nature of political things—the nature of the city.&quot;

Strauss argued that the city-in-speech was unnatural, precisely because &quot;it is rendered possible by the abstraction from &quot;eros&quot;&quot;. Though skeptical of &quot;progress,&quot; Strauss was equally skeptical about political agendas of &quot;return&quot;—that is, going backward instead of forward. In fact, he was consistently suspicious of anything claiming to be a solution to an old political or philosophical problem. He spoke of the danger in trying finally to resolve the debate between rationalism and traditionalism in politics. In particular, along with many in the pre-World War II German Right, he feared people trying to force a world state to come into being in the future, thinking that it would inevitably become a tyranny. Hence he kept his distance from the two totalitarianisms that he denounced in his century, both fascists and communists.

=== Strauss and Karl Popper ===
Strauss actively rejected Karl Popper&#x27;s views as illogical. He agreed with a letter of response to his request of Eric Voegelin to look into the issue. In the response, Voegelin wrote that studying Popper&#x27;s views was a waste of precious time, and &quot;an annoyance&quot;. Specifically about &quot;The Open Society and Its Enemies&quot; and Popper&#x27;s understanding of Plato&#x27;s &quot;The Republic&quot;, after giving some examples, Voegelin wrote:

Strauss proceeded to show this letter to Kurt Riezler, who used his influence in order to oppose Popper&#x27;s appointment at the University of Chicago.

=== Ancients and Moderns ===
Strauss constantly stressed the importance of two dichotomies in political philosophy, namely Athens and Jerusalem (reason and revelation) and Ancient versus Modern. The &quot;Ancients&quot; were the Socratic philosophers and their intellectual heirs; the &quot;Moderns&quot; start with Niccolò Machiavelli. The contrast between Ancients and Moderns was understood to be related to the unresolvable tension between Reason and Revelation. The Socratics, reacting to the first Greek philosophers, brought philosophy back to earth, and hence back to the marketplace, making it more political.

The Moderns reacted to the dominance of revelation in medieval society by promoting the possibilities of Reason. They objected to Aquinas&#x27;s merger of natural right and natural theology, for it made natural right vulnerable to sideshow theological disputes. Thomas Hobbes, under the influence of Francis Bacon, re-oriented political thought to what was most solid but also most low in man—his physical hopes and fears—setting a precedent for John Locke and the later economic approach to political thought, as in David Hume and Adam Smith.

=== Strauss and Zionism ===
As a youth, Strauss belonged to the German Zionist youth group, along with his friends Gershom Scholem and Walter Benjamin. Both were admirers of Strauss and would continue to be throughout their lives. When he was 17, as he said, he was &quot;converted&quot; to political Zionism as a follower of Ze&#x27;ev Jabotinsky. He wrote several essays about its controversies but left these activities behind by his early twenties. While Strauss maintained a sympathetic interest in Zionism, he later came to refer to Zionism as &quot;problematic&quot; and became disillusioned with some of its aims.

Strauss taught at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem during the 1954–55 academic year. In his letter to a &quot;National Review&quot; editor, Strauss asked why Israel had been called a racist state by one of their writers. He argued that the author did not provide enough proof for his argument. He ended his essay with this statement: &quot;Political Zionism is problematic for obvious reasons. But I can never forget what it achieved as a moral force in an era of complete dissolution. It helped to stem the tide of &#x27;progressive&#x27; leveling of venerable, ancestral differences; it fulfilled a conservative function.&quot;

=== Religious belief ===
Although Strauss accepted the utility of religious belief, there is some question about his religious views. He was openly disdainful of atheism and disapproved of contemporary dogmatic disbelief, which he considered intemperate and irrational. However, like Thomas Aquinas, he felt that revelation must be subject to examination by reason. At the end of &quot;The City and Man&quot;, Strauss invites us to &quot;be open to ... the question &quot;quid sit deus&quot; [&quot;What is God?&quot;]&quot; (p. 241). Edward Feser writes that &quot;Strauss was not himself an orthodox believer, neither was he a convinced atheist. Since whether or not to accept a purported divine revelation is itself one of the &#x27;permanent&#x27; questions, orthodoxy must always remain an option equally as defensible as unbelief.&quot;

In &quot;Natural Right and History&quot;, Strauss distinguishes a Socratic (Platonic, Ciceronian, Aristotelian) from a conventionalist (materialistic, Epicurean) reading of divinity, and argues that &quot;the question of religion&quot; (what is religion?) is inseparable from the question of the nature of civil society and civil authority. Throughout the volume he argues for the Socratic reading of civil authority and rejects the conventionalist reading (of which atheism is an essential component). This is incompatible with interpretations by Shadia Drury and other scholars who argue that Strauss viewed religion purely instrumentally.

== Reception and legacy ==
=== Reception by contemporaries ===
Strauss&#x27;s works were read and admired by thinkers as diverse as the philosophers Gershom Scholem, Walter Benjamin, Hans-Georg Gadamer, and Alexandre Kojève, and the psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan. Benjamin had become acquainted with Strauss as a student in Berlin, and expressed admiration for Strauss throughout his life. Gadamer stated that he &#x27;largely agreed&#x27; with Strauss&#x27;s interpretations.

=== The Straussian school ===
Straussianism is the name given &quot;to denote the research methods, common concepts, theoretical presuppositions, central questions, and pedagogic style (teaching style) characteristic of the large number of conservatives who have been influenced by the thought and teaching of Leo Strauss&quot;. While it &quot;is particularly influential among university professors of historical political theory ... it also sometimes serves as a common intellectual framework more generally among conservative activists, think tank professionals, and public intellectuals&quot;. Harvey C. Mansfield, Steven B. Smith and Steven Berg, though never students of Strauss, are &quot;Straussians&quot; (as some followers of Strauss identify themselves). Mansfield has argued that there is no such thing as &quot;Straussianism&quot; yet there are Straussians and a school of Straussians. Mansfield describes the school as &quot;open to the whole of philosophy&quot; and without any definite doctrines that one has to believe in order to belong to it.

Within the discipline of political theory, the method calls for its practitioners to use &quot;a &#x27;close reading&#x27; of the &#x27;Great Books&#x27; of political thought; they strive to understand a thinker &#x27;as he understood himself&#x27;; they are unconcerned with questions about the historical context of, or historical influences on, a given author&quot; and strive to be open to the idea that they may find something timelessly true in a great book. The approach &quot;resembles in important ways the old New Criticism in literary studies.&quot; 

There is some controversy in the approach over what distinguishes a great book from lesser works. Great books are held to be written by authors/philosophers &quot;of such sovereign critical self-knowledge and intellectual power that they can in no way be reduced to the general thought of their time and place,&quot; with other works &quot;understood as epiphenomenal to the original insights of a thinker of the first rank.&quot; This approach is seen as a counter &quot;to the historicist presuppositions of the mid-twentieth century, which read the history of political thought in a progressivist way, with past philosophies forever cut off from us in a superseded past.&quot; Straussianism puts forward the possibility that past thinkers may have &quot;hold of &quot;the truth&quot;and that more recent thinkers are therefore wrong.&quot;

=== The Chinese Straussians ===
Almost the entirety of Strauss&#x27;s writings has been translated into Chinese. There even is a school of Straussians in China, the most prominent being Liu Xiaofeng (Renmin University) and Gan Yang. &quot;Chinese Straussians&quot; (who often are also fascinated by Carl Schmitt) represent an example of the hybridization of Western political theory in a non-Western context. As the editors of a recent volume write, &quot;the reception of Schmitt and Strauss in the Chinese-speaking world (and especially in the People&#x27;s Republic of China) not only says much about how Schmitt and Strauss can be read today, but also provides important clues about the deeper contradictions of Western modernity and the dilemmas of non-liberal societies in our increasingly contentious world.&quot;

== Criticism ==

=== Basis for esotericism ===
In the essay, &quot;Persecution and the Art of Writing&quot;, Strauss posits that information needs to be kept secret from the masses by &quot;writing between the lines&quot;. However, this seems like a false premise, as most authors Strauss refers to in his work lived in times when only the social elites were literate enough to understand works of philosophy.

=== Conservatism ===
Some critics of Strauss have accused him of being elitist, illiberal and anti-democratic. Journalists such as Seymour Hersh have opined that Strauss endorsed noble lies, &quot;myths used by political leaders seeking to maintain a cohesive society&quot;. In &quot;The City and Man&quot;, Strauss discusses the myths outlined in Plato&#x27;s &quot;Republic&quot; that are required for all governments. These include a belief that the state&#x27;s land belongs to it even though it may have been acquired illegitimately and that citizenship is rooted in something more than accidents of birth.

Shadia Drury, in &quot;Leo Strauss and the American Right&quot; (1999), claimed that Strauss inculcated an elitist strain in American political leaders linked to imperialist militarism, neoconservatism and Christian fundamentalism. Drury argues that Strauss teaches that &quot;perpetual deception of the citizens by those in power is critical because they need to be led, and they need strong rulers to tell them what&#x27;s good for them&quot;. Nicholas Xenos similarly argues that Strauss was &quot;an anti-democrat in a fundamental sense, a true reactionary&quot;. Xenos says: &quot;Strauss was somebody who wanted to go back to a previous, pre-liberal, pre-bourgeois era of blood and guts, of imperial domination, of authoritarian rule, of pure fascism.&quot;

=== Anti-historicism ===
Strauss has also been criticized by some conservatives. According to Claes G. Ryn, Strauss&#x27;s anti-historicist thinking creates an artificial contrast between moral universality and &quot;the conventional&quot;, &quot;the ancestral&quot;, and &quot;the historical&quot;. Strauss, Ryn argues, wrongly and reductively assumes that respect for tradition must undermine reason and universality. Contrary to Strauss&#x27;s criticism of Edmund Burke, the historical sense may be indispensable to an adequate apprehension of universality. Strauss&#x27;s abstract, ahistorical conception of natural right distorts genuine universality, Ryn contends. Strauss does not consider the possibility that real universality becomes known to human beings in a concretized, particular form. Strauss and the Straussians have paradoxically taught philosophically unsuspecting American conservatives, not least Roman Catholic intellectuals, to reject tradition in favor of ahistorical theorizing, a bias that flies in the face of the central Christian notion of the Incarnation, which represents a synthesis of the universal and the historical. According to Ryn, the propagation of a purely abstract idea of universality has contributed to the neoconservative advocacy of allegedly universal American principles, which neoconservatives see as justification for American intervention around the world—bringing the blessings of the &quot;West&quot; to the benighted &quot;rest&quot;. Strauss&#x27;s anti-historical thinking connects him and his followers with the French Jacobins, who also regarded tradition as incompatible with virtue and rationality. 

What Ryn calls the &quot;new Jacobinism&quot; of the &quot;neoconservative&quot; philosophy is, writes Paul Gottfried, also the rhetoric of Saint-Just and Leon Trotsky, which the philosophically impoverished American Right has taken over with mindless alacrity; Republican operators and think tanks apparently believe they can carry the electorate by appealing to yesterday&#x27;s leftist clichés.

=== Response to criticism ===
In his 2009 book &quot;Straussophobia&quot;, Peter Minowitz provides a detailed critique of Drury, Xenos, and other critics of Strauss whom he accuses of &quot;bigotry and buffoonery&quot;. 

In &quot;Reading Leo Strauss&quot;, Steven B. Smith rejects the link between Strauss and neoconservative thought, arguing that Strauss was never personally active in politics, never endorsed imperialism, and questioned the utility of political philosophy for the practice of politics. In particular, Strauss argued that Plato&#x27;s myth of the philosopher king should be read as a reductio ad absurdum, and that philosophers should understand politics not in order to influence policy but to ensure philosophy&#x27;s autonomy from politics. In his review of &quot;Reading Leo Strauss&quot;, Robert Alter writes that Smith &quot;persuasively sets the record straight on Strauss&#x27;s political views and on what his writing is really about&quot;. 

Strauss&#x27;s daughter, Jenny Strauss Clay, defended Strauss against the charge that he was the &quot;mastermind behind the neoconservative ideologues who control United States foreign policy.&quot; &quot;He was a conservative&quot;, she says, &quot;insofar as he did not think change is necessarily change for the better.&quot; Since contemporary academia &quot;leaned to the left&quot;, with its &quot;unquestioned faith in progress and science combined with a queasiness regarding any kind of moral judgment&quot;, Strauss stood outside of the academic consensus. Had academia leaned to the right, he would have questioned it, tooand on certain occasions &quot;did&quot; question the tenets of the right.

Mark Lilla has argued that the attribution to Strauss of neoconservative views contradicts a careful reading of Strauss&#x27; actual texts, in particular &quot;On Tyranny&quot;. Lilla summarizes Strauss as follows:

Philosophy must always be aware of the dangers of tyranny, as a threat to both political decency and the philosophical life. It must understand enough about politics to defend its own autonomy, without falling into the error of thinking that philosophy can shape the political world according to its own lights.

Responding to charges that Strauss&#x27;s teachings fostered the neoconservative foreign policy of the George W. Bush administration, such as &quot;unrealistic hopes for the spread of liberal democracy through military conquest&quot;, Nathan Tarcov, director of the Leo Strauss Center at the University of Chicago, asserts that Strauss as a political philosopher was essentially non-political. After an exegesis of the very limited practical political views to be gleaned from Strauss&#x27;s writings, Tarcov concludes that &quot;Strauss can remind us of the permanent problems, but we have only ourselves to blame for our faulty solutions to the problems of today.&quot;

<text>Social guidance films constitute a genre of propaganda films attempting to influence children and adults to behave in certain ways. Social guidance films, particularly popular in the mid-20th century, were designed to address various social issues and promote positive behavior among audiences, especially young people. Often produced by government agencies or educational institutions, these films tackled topics such as peer pressure, substance abuse, and moral decision-making, using relatable narratives and characters to convey their messages. produced by the U.S. government as &quot;attitude-building films&quot; during World War II, the genre grew to be a common source of indoctrination in elementary and high school classrooms in the United States from the late 1940s to the early 1970s. The films covered topics including courtesy, grammar, social etiquette and dating, personal hygiene and grooming, health and fitness, civic and moral responsibility, sexuality, child safety, national loyalty, racial and social prejudice, juvenile delinquency, drug use, and driver safety; the genre also includes films for adults, covering topics such as marriage, business etiquette, general safety, home economics, career counseling and how to balance budgets. A subset is known as hygiene films addressing mental hygiene and sexual hygiene.

==History==
Social guidance films were typically produced by educational filmmakers, government agencies, and private organizations, reflecting the postwar anxiety over social change and the desire for conformity in an era of rapid modernization. These films were often produced by corporations such as Coronet Instructional Films, Centron Corporation for Young America Films, Encyclopædia Britannica Films, and occasionally by better-known companies such as Ford Motor Company and Crawley Films for McGraw-Hill Book Company. Many were made by independent producers, most notably the prolific maverick independent filmmaker Sid Davis. Few of these films featured notable actors, and only a few were produced by a major Hollywood studio, such as the films made by Walt Disney Productions and Warner Bros. In rare instances, the films were sponsored by a major company such as Kotex or General Motors. Ken Smith, in his seminal 1999 book on the genre, &quot;Mental Hygiene: Classroom Films 1945 - 1970&quot;, estimates that there were &quot;around three thousand&quot; films made that fall into the &quot;social guidance&quot; film genre. Aimed at schoolchildren, the films used a combination of didactic storytelling and visual imagery to impart moral lessons, promoting ideals such as proper conduct, emotional control, and the American dream.

While many of the films were merely instructional (like 1941&#x27;s &quot;Posture and Exercise&quot;, 1949&#x27;s &quot;Posture and Personality&quot; and 1952&#x27;s &quot;Duck and Cover&quot;), others ended with an invitation for a classroom discussion of the topic (1956&#x27;s &quot;What About Alcoholism?&quot;; 1959&#x27;s &quot;What About Prejudice?&quot;), whereas others were presented as striking cautionary tales (1959&#x27;s &quot;Signal 30&quot;; 1961&#x27;s &quot;Seduction of the Innocent&quot;; 1967&#x27;s &quot;Narcotics: Pit of Despair&quot;).

== Description ==
Social guidance films discussed issues such as etiquette in regards to family, school and dating. Studios such as Coronet films strayed away from voice-over and portrayed their social guidance films by having their protagonist play out real life scenarios as a way to connect with their audience. Often, these films portrayed a life of the &quot;ideal Human&quot;, this would fall along the lines of the model of nuclear families. With a mix of drama and instructional content, they aimed to foster a sense of community responsibility and personal integrity. While their simplistic portrayals and moralistic tones may seem dated today, these films reflect a cultural effort to navigate the complexities of social norms and encourage ethical conduct in an evolving society.

Social guidance films address their audience to relate with their protagonist. Protagonist or social guidance films are typically depicted as part of the white, middle-class, ignoring and prioritizing other identities. The antithesis of social guidance films, these works served as tools of social control and social engineering, designed to help shape the behavioral patterns of young audiences.

== Reception and goal ==
Social guidance films were accessible for people of all ages. They were typically shown to children in schools. These films were included into the classrooms and utilized to create class discourse. Social guidance films were used so extensively in classrooms that only a few of these films remain today. When a film reel would be too damaged to be played in the classrooms, educators would dispose of them and order newer reels from production companies. The overall goal of the social guidance films was to help shape younger generations to stay within accepted social boundaries. Although sometimes viewed as conservative or reactionary by today&#x27;s standards, Smith points out that these films were not made by conservatives or reactionaries but instead &quot;by some of the most liberal and progressive-minded people of their time.&quot; When shown in the classroom, many had felt that a teachers scope of practice should not exceed reading, writing and basic arithmetic. According to Smith, the social guidance films were viewed as harmful in more rural and poorer areas, &quot;the moral education was seen as a territory for parents and the church.&quot;

The goal of social guidance films were to provide guidance for their audience to become adapted into society and fit the mold of societal norms. Social guidance films also had a goal of control and conformity of their audience. Qualities such as self-control and temper were some of the main topics of these films. Specifically elements of control were confounded in the mental hygiene film; presenting ideologies surrounding women&#x27;s appearance, child care, and home cooking. Within the goal of control, there was additionally a plan for normalcy. The lessons taught within social guidance films echoed themes of maintaining within &quot;normal&quot; boundaries.

==Appearances in other media==
As films in this genre are largely in public domain, they have been used in modern productions outside of their intended purpose, usually as a means of unintentional comedy. A number of short social guidance films, such as &quot;Posture Pals&quot; (1952) and &quot;Are You Ready for Marriage?&quot; (1950), were featured and lampooned on the television comedy series &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot; to provide padding for episodes in which the featured movie segments did not fill out the program&#x27;s roughly 90-minute running time. On &quot;The Weird Al Show&quot;, clips from still other films were taken and edited together with new voiceovers to make parodies.

The 1999 feature film &quot;The Iron Giant&quot;, set in 1957, features a social guidance film-within-a-film titled &quot;Atomic Holocaust&quot;, the style and tone of which emulate 1952&#x27;s &quot;Duck and Cover&quot;.

A fifth-season episode of the AMC series &quot;Mad Men,&quot; which takes place between July 1966 and August 1966, uses the title of 1959&#x27;s &quot;Signal 30&quot; as the episode title.

<text>The Škoda 75 mm Model 1939 (75 mm M.39) was a mountain gun manufactured by Škoda Works and exported in small numbers to Romania and Iran. The design was related to the Bofors L/22 sold to Switzerland. For transport, the gun could be broken into eight sections and carried by mule. The gun crew was protected by an armoured shield. Romanian guns equipped two mountain artillery battalions.

<doc id="210254" wikidata="Q164950" url="?curid=210254" title="Dynasty">
<text>A dynasty is a sequence of rulers from the same family, usually in the context of a monarchical system, but sometimes also appearing in republics. A dynasty may also be referred to as a &quot;house&quot;, &quot;family&quot; or &quot;clan&quot;, among others.

Historians periodize the histories of many states and civilizations, such as the Roman Empire (27 BC – AD 1453), Imperial Iran (678 BC – AD 1979), Ancient Egypt (3100–30 BC), and Ancient and Imperial China (2070 BC – AD 1912), using a framework of successive dynasties. As such, the term &quot;dynasty&quot; may be used to delimit the era during which a family reigned.

Before the 18th century, most dynasties throughout the world have traditionally been reckoned patrilineally, such as those that follow the Frankish Salic law. In polities where it was permitted, succession through a daughter usually established a new dynasty in her husband&#x27;s family name. This has changed in all of Europe&#x27;s remaining monarchies, where succession law and conventions have maintained dynastic names &quot;de jure&quot; through a female.

Dynastic politics has declined over time, owing to a decline in monarchy as a form of government, a rise in democracy, and a reduction within democracies of elected members from dynastic families.

==Terminology==

The word &quot;dynasty&quot; (from the , &quot;dynasteía&quot; &quot;power&quot;, &quot;lordship&quot;, from &quot;dynástes&quot; &quot;ruler&quot;) is sometimes used informally for people who are not rulers but are, for example, members of a family with influence and power in other areas, such as a series of successive owners of a major company, or any family with a legacy, such as a dynasty of poets or actors. It is also extended to unrelated people, such as major poets of the same school or various rosters of a single sports team.

The dynastic family or lineage may be known as a &quot;noble house&quot;, which may be styled as &quot;imperial&quot;, &quot;royal&quot;, &quot;princely&quot;, &quot;ducal&quot;, &quot;comital&quot; or &quot;baronial&quot;, depending upon the chief or present title borne by its members, but it is more often referred by adding the name afterwards, as in &quot;House of Habsburg&quot;.

===Definition===
A ruler from a dynasty is sometimes referred to as a &quot;dynast&quot;, but this term is also used to describe any member of a reigning family who retains a right to succeed to a throne. For example, King Edward VIII ceased to be a dynast of the House of Windsor following his abdication.

In historical and monarchist references to formerly reigning families, a &quot;dynast&quot; is a family member who would have had succession rights, were the monarchy&#x27;s rules still in force. For example, after the 1914 assassinations of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria and his morganatic wife, their son Maximilian, Duke of Hohenberg, was bypassed for the Austro-Hungarian throne because he was not a Habsburg dynast. Even after the abolition of the Austrian monarchy, Duke Maximilian and his descendants have not been considered the rightful pretenders by Austrian monarchists, nor have they claimed that position.

The term &quot;dynast&quot; is sometimes used only to refer to agnatic descendants of a realm&#x27;s monarchs, and sometimes to include those who hold succession rights through cognatic royal descent. The term can therefore describe overlapping but distinct sets of people. For example, David Armstrong-Jones, 2nd Earl of Snowdon, a nephew of Queen Elizabeth II, is in the line of succession to the British crown, making him a British dynast. On the other hand, since he is not a patrilineal member of the British royal family, he is therefore not a dynast of the House of Windsor.

Comparatively, the German aristocrat Prince Ernst August of Hanover, a male-line descendant of King George III, possesses no legal British name, titles or styles (although he is entitled to reclaim the former royal dukedom of Cumberland). He was born in the line of succession to the British throne and was bound by Britain&#x27;s Royal Marriages Act 1772 until it was repealed when the Succession to the Crown Act 2013 took effect on 26 March 2015. Thus, he requested and obtained formal permission from Queen Elizabeth II to marry the Roman Catholic Princess Caroline of Monaco in 1999. Yet, a clause of the English Act of Settlement 1701 remained in effect at that time, stipulating that dynasts who marry Roman Catholics are considered &quot;dead&quot; for the purpose of succession to the British throne. That exclusion, too, ceased to apply on 26 March 2015, with retroactive effect for those who had been dynasts before triggering it by marriage to a Roman Catholic.

===Dynastic marriage===
A &quot;dynastic marriage&quot; is one that complies with monarchical house law restrictions, so that the descendants are eligible to inherit the throne or other royal privileges. For example, the marriage of King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands to Máxima Zorreguieta in 2002 was dynastic, making their eldest child, Princess Catharina-Amalia, the heir apparent to the Crown of the Netherlands. The marriage of his younger brother, Prince Friso of Orange-Nassau, in 2003 lacked government support and parliamentary approval. Thus, Prince Friso forfeited his place in the order of succession to the Dutch throne, and consequently lost his title as a &quot;Prince of the Netherlands&quot;, and left his children without dynastic rights.

Empress Maria Theresa of the Habsburg dynasty had her children married into various European dynasties. Habsburg marriage policy amongst European dynasties led to the &quot;Pax Austriaca&quot;.

==History==
Historians periodize the histories of many states and civilizations, such as Ancient Iran (3200–539 BC), Ancient Egypt (3100–30 BC) and Ancient and Imperial China (2070 BC – AD 1912), using a framework of successive dynasties. As such, the term &quot;dynasty&quot; may be used to delimit the era during which a family reigned, and also to describe events, trends and artifacts of that period (e.g., &quot;a Ming dynasty vase&quot;). Until the 19th century, it was taken for granted that a legitimate function of a monarch was to aggrandize his dynasty: that is, to expand the wealth and power of his family members.

Before the 18th century, most dynasties throughout the world have traditionally been reckoned patrilineally, such as those that follow the Frankish Salic law. In polities where it was permitted, succession through a daughter usually established a new dynasty in her husband&#x27;s family name. This has changed in all of Europe&#x27;s remaining monarchies, where succession law and conventions have maintained dynastic names &quot;de jure&quot; through a female. For instance, the House of Windsor is maintained through the children of Queen Elizabeth II, as it did with the monarchy of the Netherlands, whose dynasty remained the House of Orange-Nassau through three successive queens regnant. The earliest such example among major European monarchies was in the Russian Empire in the 18th century, where the name of the House of Romanov was maintained through Grand Duchess Anna Petrovna. This also happened in the case of Queen Maria II of Portugal, who married Prince Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha-Koháry, but whose descendants remained members of the House of Braganza, per Portuguese law; in fact, since the 1800s, the only female monarch in Europe who had children belonging to a different house was Queen Victoria and that was due to disagreements over how to choose a non German house. In Limpopo Province of South Africa, Balobedu determined descent matrilineally, while rulers have at other times adopted the name of their mother&#x27;s dynasty when coming into her inheritance. Less frequently, a monarchy has alternated or been rotated, in a multi-dynastic (or polydynastic) system—that is, the most senior living members of parallel dynasties, at any point in time, constitute the line of succession.

==Longevity==

Dynasties lasting at least 250 years include the following. Legendary lineages that cannot be historically confirmed are not included.

==Extant sovereign dynasties==
There are 43 sovereign states with a monarch as head of state, of which 41 are ruled by dynasties. There are currently 26 sovereign dynasties.

==Political families==
Though in elected governments, rule does not pass automatically by inheritance, political power often accrues to generations of related individuals in the elected positions of republics and constitutional monarchies. Eminence, influence, tradition, genetics, and nepotism may contribute to the phenomenon.

===Hereditary dictatorship===

Hereditary dictatorships are personalist dictatorships in which political power stays within a dictator&#x27;s family due to the overwhelming authority of the dictator, rather than by the democratic consent of the people. The dictator typically fills government positions with their relatives. They may groom a successor during their own lifetime, or a member of their family may maneuver to take control of the dictatorship after the dictator&#x27;s death.

<text>The Škoda 100 mm Model 1916 (100 mm M.16) was a mountain howitzer used by Austria-Hungary during World War I, developed from the 10 cm M. 14 Feldhaubitze. The Turks used a 105 mm variant, the M.16(T). The Wehrmacht redesignated this as the 10 cm GebH 16 or 16(ö). Guns acquired from Italy, after 1943, were known as 10 cm GebH 316(i); those acquired from Czechoslovakia were 10 cm GebH 16(t). The Italians referred to weapons gained either through capture or reparations as the Obice da 100/17 modello 16. The gun could be broken into three sections, intended for towing by two animal carts. The gun crew was protected by a gun shield. The Italians used lighter shells than the Czechs, which accounts for the greater range and muzzle velocity of their guns.

<text>The Pomeranian War was a theatre of the Seven Years&#x27; War. The term is used to describe the fighting between Sweden and Prussia between 1757 and 1762 in Swedish Pomerania, Prussian Pomerania, northern Brandenburg and eastern Mecklenburg-Schwerin.

The war was characterized by a back-and-forth movement of the Swedish and Prussian armies, neither of whom would score a decisive victory. It started when Swedish forces advanced into Prussian territory in 1757, but were repelled and blockaded at Stralsund until their relief by a Russian force in 1758. In the course of the following, renewed Swedish incursion into Prussian territory, the small Prussian fleet was destroyed and areas as far south as Neuruppin were occupied, yet the campaign was aborted in late 1759 when the undersupplied Swedish forces succeeded neither in taking the major Prussian fortress of Stettin (now Szczecin) nor in combining with their Russian allies.

A Prussian counter-attack of Swedish Pomerania in January 1760 was repelled, and throughout the year Swedish forces again advanced into Prussian territory as far south as Prenzlau before again withdrawing to Swedish Pomerania in the winter. Another Swedish campaign into Prussia started in the summer of 1761, but was soon aborted due to shortage of supplies and equipment. The final encounters of the war took place in the winter of 1761/62 near Malchin and Neukalen in Mecklenburg, just across the Swedish Pomeranian border, before the parties agreed on the Truce of Ribnitz on 7 April 1762. When on 5 May a Russo-Prussian alliance eliminated Swedish hopes for future Russian assistance, and instead posed the threat of a Russian intervention on the Prussian side, Sweden was forced to make peace.

The war was formally ended on 22 May 1762 by the Peace of Hamburg between Prussia, Mecklenburg and Sweden. The hopes of the Swedish Hats party to recover territories lost to Prussia in 1720 were thwarted, and the unpopular and costly war contributed to their subsequent downfall.

==Background==
The main cause for the Swedish intervention in the Seven Years&#x27; War was that the Hats faction then in power in Sweden believed Frederick II of Prussia would succumb to his many enemies, thus affording Sweden a risk-free opportunity to recapture its possessions in Pomerania that it had ceded to Prussia in 1720, towards the end of the Great Northern War. Angered and frightened by the attempted monarchial revolution of 1756, the Hats also wanted to cause Frederick&#x27;s downfall and to humiliate and destroy the Swedish queen Louisa Ulrika of Prussia, Frederick&#x27;s sister. The Hats faction was also encouraged to declare war by France, whose wishes were central to the Hats&#x27; actions.

Frederick&#x27;s invasion of Saxony in 1756 was used as a pretext for war, being denounced by both Sweden and France as a violation of the Treaty of Westphalia of 1648, of which they were both guarantors. On March 21, 1757 the governments of France and Austria agreed to a convention in which Sweden and France explained that they had to maintain Germany&#x27;s freedom in line with the treaty. France promised financial backing for such a war and in June the same year the decision was made to send 20,000 Swedish troops to Germany to emphasise their commitment. On September 13 that force invaded Prussian Pomerania.

To avoid this invasion appearing as a war of aggression (no war of aggression could be started without the consent of the estates), the Swedes issued no declaration of war and presented the incursion to the German parliament as aimed solely at restoring peace. Only after hostilities had begun did the promised financial support from France and its allies arrive and only then, on 22 September 1757, did the Swedish government state its conditions and declare war.
However, the Hats had seriously overestimated the strength of the Swedish army, as the soldiers were badly trained, poorly equipped, and in every way unprepared for war.

==Course==
===1757–1758===
The Swedish army sent to Germany was only sufficient for taking possession of what had already been conquered by the Allies, but made the all necessary preparations to go on the offensive despite not having the necessary funds. The army&#x27;s very premise, to suppress Frederick, was found false—on being notified of his victory at Rossbach on 5 November 1757, the Swedish commander Marshal Mattias Alexander von Ungern-Sternberg dared not obey the orders from his government and the French agent Marc René de Montalembert to lead his ill-equipped army in a march on Berlin, instead returning in November 1757 to Swedish Pomerania, where the Swedes were being besieged by the Prussians at Stralsund and Rügen.

Von Ungern-Sternberg relinquished command on 21 December 1757 to Gustaf von Rosen, but von Rosen too was forced to lie idle, blockaded by the Prussians. This blockade was lifted by an invading Russian army on 18 June 1758, but von Rosen had grown tired of his thankless task and handed command over to Gustav David Hamilton. Augustin Ehrensvard captured Peenemünde hill on July 27, and Hamilton sent 16,000 men to support the Russians, who were besieging Küstrin. However, after their defeat at Zorndorf he decided instead to march to Saxony to join up with the Austrians. However, he got no further than Neuruppin in Brandenburg. A detachment he sent from there suffered a heavy defeat on 26 September at the Battle of Tornow, but Major was able to reach Fehrbellin with 800 men to defend it from about 5,000 Prussians at a battle fought there on 28 September.

After the failure of the Austrian invasion of Saxony, Hamilton left Neuruppin on 10 October and headed for the River Oder, in the hopes of joining up with the Russians. He failed in this and the Swedish force had to go into winter quarters, with Hamilton returning to Swedish Pomerania. The government blamed him for the force&#x27;s failure and pressured him into resigning his command, which Hamilton did on 23 November 1758. Hamilton was replaced as commander on 19 December the same year with Jacob Albrecht von Lantingshausen.

===1759===
Early in 1759, a superior Prussian force forced him to retreat to Stralsund, losing the garrisons at Demmin, Anklam and Peenemünde after hard fighting. The Russian advance in May liberated Swedish Pomerania, but lack of money and supplies meant the Swedish commander could only start campaigning that August. His goal was to besiege Stettin and in preparation for this Lantingshausen allowed Axel von Fersen to take 4,000 men to capture Usedom and Wollin—this objective was met after the Battle of Frisches Haff ensured Swedish naval supremacy in September—while Lantingshausen took the main body of the army to advance deep into Prussian Pomerania, where he then remained still for a long while. However, due to a lack of cooperation from his allies, he was unable to besiege Stettin and in late autumn withdrew into Swedish Pomerania.

===1760–1762===
The Prussians then invaded Swedish Pomerania on 20 January 1760, but this time they were repulsed and on 28 January Swedish troops penetrated as far as Anklam and captured the Prussian general Heinrich von Manteuffel. However, despite these successes and despite the Prussian army&#x27;s attention mainly being elsewhere, Lantingshausen and his 15,000 troops were under-supplied and only able to invade Prussia in August, mainly in order to find supplies. He pushed forward to Prenzlow (now Prenzlau) in Brandenburg with his main force of 6,000 troops, leaving Augustin Ehrensvard with a detachment in Pasewalk. There he was attacked by the enemy and fought back bravely, but Ehrensvard was wounded and had to resign his command.

Then many officers left to participate in parliament and the resulting shortage of officers forced Lantingshausen to return to Swedish Pomerania, where he remained for the whole winter without being attacked by the Prussians. Although his commands exceeded any expectations, Lantingshausen tired of the immense difficulties and in June 1761 resigned. Only in July was his successor Augustin Ehrensvard able to raise 7,000 men to invade the enemy&#x27;s country. Although superior to the Prussian army that tried to prevent his advance, they were so poorly equipped that the advance did not get far and the campaign saw only minor engagements. In September he sent two regiments under count Frederick William von Hessenstein to support the Russians, who had been besieging Kolberg since 1759. However, Hessenstein soon had to withdraw and in October the whole Swedish force returned to Swedish Pomerania. When the Prussians began to worry about their borders, he sent Jacob Magnus Sprengtporten with light troops (the so-called Sprengtportenska) to Mecklenburg and on 23 December defeated a Prussian force at Malchin on 23 December. However, there he was surrounded by a superior Prussian force, though Ehrensvard was able to break through and rescue him. An advance guard under De Carnall defeated the Prussians at Neukalen (2 January 1762) who were trying to block the road and Ehrensvard marched into Malchin. However, he then immediately returned to Swedish Pomerania and on 7 April came to a truce on his own initiative—this truce of Ribnitz lasted until the peace.

==Results==
In Sweden, the unpopularity of this costly and futile war meant that the Hats&#x27; control on government began to falter and the confusion the war caused led to a deficit which resulted in their fall in 1765. The death of Elizabeth of Russia in January 1762 changed the whole political situation in Europe. A Russo-Prussian alliance, formalized on 5 May, threatened to make Russia an enemy not an ally of Sweden. The secret committee thus decided on March 13 that year that Sweden would seek a separate peace. Via the queen&#x27;s mediation, the Swedes signed the peace of Hamburg with Prussia and Mecklenburg on 22 May, accepting their defeat—Prussia and Sweden were restored to the status quo ante bellum.

<text>St Mary&#x27;s Church (), known also as St Mary&#x27;s Pro-Cathedral or simply the Pro-Cathedral, the Chapel in Marlborough Street or the Pro, is a pro-cathedral and is the episcopal seat of the Catholic Archbishop of Dublin and Primate of Ireland.

== Status ==


The city of Dublin possesses two cathedrals, but unusually, both belong to one church, the minority Church of Ireland, which had been the Established Church in Ireland until 1871. In contrast, the majority religion in Ireland, Roman Catholicism, has no cathedral in Ireland&#x27;s capital city and has not had one since the Protestant Reformation. As the official church, the Church of Ireland took control of most church property, including the Cathedral of the Holy Trinity (generally known as Christchurch) and St Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral.

These two churches had long shared the role of cathedral of Dublin, controversially at first, then under an agreement of 1300, &quot;Pacis Compositio&quot;, which gave Christchurch formal precedence, including the right to enthrone the Archbishop and to hold his cross, mitre and ring after death, but with deceased Archbishops of Dublin to be buried alternately in each of the two cathedrals, unless they personally willed otherwise, and the two cathedrals to act as one, and &quot;shared equally in their freedoms&quot;.

Even though Christchurch has been in the possession of the Church of Ireland for nearly five hundred years, it is still viewed by the Roman Catholic Church as the primary official Dublin cathedral, since it was so designated by the pope at the request of the then Archbishop of Dublin, St Laurence O&#x27;Toole in the 12th century. Unless the pope either formally revokes Christchurch&#x27;s designation or grants cathedral status to another church, the main Roman Catholic church in Dublin will continue to be designated a &quot;pro-cathedral&quot; (meaning &quot;provisional&quot; or &quot;acting&quot; cathedral), a title officially given to St Mary&#x27;s Church in 1886, though it used that title unofficially since the 1820s.

== History ==
The Pro-Cathedral owes its origins to the Penal Laws which restricted Catholicism (and other non-Church of Ireland faiths) until the early nineteenth century. For centuries, Roman Catholics could not celebrate Mass or the sacraments in public and were subject to severe penalties (hence the word &quot;penal&quot;). While these laws ebbed and flowed in terms of the severity with which they were applied, Catholic churches if they were built at all, were built down narrow, difficult-to-find roadways. By the early nineteenth century, many of the Penal Laws had either been repealed or were no longer enforced; an unsuccessful attempt had already been made to grant Catholic Emancipation. As a result, Catholicism began to abandon its previous status as an &quot;underground&quot; religion.

In 1803, a committee formed by then Archbishop John Thomas Troy bought Lord Annesley&#x27;s townhouse on the corner of Marlborough Street and Elephant Lane (now called Cathedral Street), within sight of the city&#x27;s premier thoroughfare, Sackville Street (now O&#x27;Connell Street) as the location for the planned new pro-cathedral, pending the erection, when funds and the law allowed, of a full Roman Catholic cathedral. In 1814 a public competition had been announced by Archbishop Troy, inviting designs for the new church.

In June 1814 the demolition of the house took place. Constructed between 1815 and 1825, pro-cathedral combines a number of styles. The exterior is in Greek revival style, while the interior is more Renaissance style, based on the Church of Saint-Philippe du Roule of Paris. Archbishop of Dublin, Daniel Murray, celebrated the new pro-cathedral&#x27;s completion on 14 November 1825, the feast of Dublin&#x27;s patron saint, St Laurence O’Toole.

Though not a full cathedral, the new building became a symbol of the Irish nationalist spirit in the era following the ending of the Penal Laws. Daniel O&#x27;Connell, the leader of Irish nationalism and the first Roman Catholic MP elected to the British House of Commons, was present at a special thanksgiving High Mass in the Pro-Cathedral in 1829 following the granting of Catholic Emancipation, which among other things had allowed Catholics to be elected to parliament. In 1841, as the first Catholic Lord Mayor of Dublin in centuries, O&#x27;Connell formally celebrated his election by travelling in state to &quot;the Pro&quot; for High Mass. After he died in 1847, his remains were laid in state on a great catafalque in the Pro-Cathedral.

St Mary&#x27;s baptism register contains quite a few entries for children born in the nearby Rotunda hospital; they were probably baptised quite quickly due to the feared infant mortality rates of the 19th century.

===Plans for a full cathedral===
The Pro-Cathedral was never intended to be other than a temporary acting cathedral, pending the availability of funds to build a full cathedral. Various locations for the new cathedral were discussed. W. T. Cosgrave, President of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State (prime minister) from 1922 to 1932 and a deeply religious Catholic, suggested that the burnt-out shell of the General Post Office, the location of the 1916 Rising, be turned into a cathedral, but the idea was not acted on, and the GPO was restored for use as a post office.

John Charles McQuaid, who served as archbishop from the 1940s to the early 1970s, bought the gardens in the centre of Merrion Square and announced plans to erect a cathedral there, but to the relief of Dubliners, who preferred a garden in the centre of the city, his plans never came to pass and the gardens were eventually handed over by his successor to Dublin Corporation and opened to the public. While it is suggested periodically that the Church of Ireland, which has a relatively small membership, might hand over one of its cathedrals to the Catholic Church, no serious proposals have been made for such an arrangement. The Dean of St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral (which serves as the &quot;national cathedral&quot; of the Church of Ireland - Christchurch is treated as the diocesan cathedral of Dublin) did suggest allowing Catholic Masses to be celebrated in St. Patrick&#x27;s but the idea was dropped after opposition within the Church of Ireland. Though theoretically, the possibility of erecting a new Catholic cathedral remains on the agenda, in reality, most of the funds collected for the building of a new cathedral have been spent erecting new churches in what was for a lengthy period a rapidly growing archdiocese.

===State ceremony in the Pro-Cathedral===

The Pro-Cathedral remains a focal point of religious and state ceremonial activity. Up until 1983, incoming presidents of Ireland traditionally attended, prior to their civil inauguration, a religious ceremony in either St Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral (if they were members of the Church of Ireland) or the Pro-Cathedral (if they were Roman Catholic). Whereas up to 1973, those ceremonies were exclusively denominational, the ceremonies for the inaugurations of President Childers in 1973, President Ó Dálaigh in 1974 and President Hillery in 1976, were multidenominational, with representatives of the Roman Catholic, Church of Ireland, Presbyterian, Methodist and the Jewish faith taking part in the ceremony. (In 1973 it took place in St Patrick&#x27;s, in 1974 and 1976 in the Pro-Cathedral.) In 1983 a multidenominational service was included as part of the civil inauguration in Dublin Castle.

The major faiths held religious ceremonies in their main cathedral or pro-cathedral to mark the beginning of the law term or a session of parliament, which would be attended by the President of Ireland, the Taoiseach, ministers, the opposition, parliamentarians and members of the Diplomatic Corps. State funerals of major figures including Michael Collins and former presidents Seán T. O&#x27;Kelly, Éamon de Valera, Patrick Hillery and Lord Mayor of Dublin Kathleen Clarke took place there. A painting of the funeral of Michael Collins hangs in Áras an Uachtaráin, the president&#x27;s residence.

Pope Francis visited the Pro-Cathedral on 25 August 2018 during an apostolic visit to Ireland.

==Layout==
Internally, the Pro-Cathedral is dramatically different from the two main cathedrals of Dublin. Its mixture of Greek and Roman styles has proved controversial, being variously described as an artistic gem and an eyesore. Its main aisle leads up to an altar, behind which a stained glass window of the Blessed Virgin Mary (the Saint Mary of its name) is visible. For most of its existence, it possessed a massive Victorian altar and reredos by Peter Turnerelli, a Belfast-born sculptor of Italian parentage. In the late 1970s, this was removed, as part of a re-ordering to bring its sanctuary in line with changes that followed the introduction of the revision of the Mass. The reredos was completely removed, leaving just the tabernacle, though the front panel of the original altar was reinstated in the new altar, which was moved to the centre of a new paved area in an expanded sanctuary. The altar rails were also removed. The pulpit was moved as well, to a position in a corner of the building. A large contingent of Italian artisans were employed by the church, to decorate the interior of the cathedral.

The Pro-Cathedral caught fire in the early 1990s. Though the fire was extinguished before it caught hold of the building, considerable smoke damage was done to one corner of the building around the monument to Cardinal Cullen, perhaps the most famous of all the nineteenth-century Archbishops, and the first Archbishop of Dublin to be made a cardinal.

=== Organ ===

The original organ in the Pro-Cathedral was built by the Dublin organ builder, John White, in the late 19th century, and the present instrument contains some of White&#x27;s original pipework. The present facade of the organ dates from William Hill&#x27;s rebuild of the organ around 1900. Subsequent work was carried out by Henry Willis &amp; Co. in the 1930s, before J.W. Walker&#x27;s major rebuild of 1971 under the administrator Monsignor John Moloney and the most recent refurbishment of the instrument, by the same firm which was completed in the autumn of 1995. The newly refurbished instrument was inaugurated in a gala concert given by Olivier Latry on 20 March 1996.

The swell of the organ is built into the back wall of the Church. The shutters of the swell are in line with the rest of the wall. The organ console itself was moved in a general redevelopment of the church in 1995. This was to facilitate the direction of the choir.

This organ has become regarded as one of the finest examples in Ireland of the late nineteenth-century grand Romantic organ, and has since its original installation featured prominently in the many great liturgical occasions which have graced the pro-cathedral church. More recently many of the great organ recitalists of our time have performed on it: Daniel Chorzempa, Xavier Darasse, Sir David Lumsden, Daniel Roth, Dame Gillian Weir, Arthur Wills, Olivier Latry, and others. The Titular Organist of Saint Mary&#x27;s Pro-Cathedral, Gerard Gillen, was appointed to the position in 1976. David Grealy was appointed Associate Organist in September 2017.

A chancel organ built by the Dublin organ builder, John White, is located on the epistle (right) side of the High Altar. It fell into disuse on the reordering of the sanctuary c.1980. Its mechanism and pipework are stored in the bowels of the Pro-Cathedral. In the early 2000s, a three-stop portable continuo organ was acquired, which provides accompaniment for sanctuary services such as Vespers/Evening Prayer, and is also used for continuo purposes in appropriate choral and orchestral repertoire.

===Choir===
The church is known for its Palestrina Choir, the resident choir of Saint Mary&#x27;s Pro-Cathedral. It had its origins in a boys&#x27; choir formed in the 1890s by Vincent O&#x27;Brien, then a music teacher at St Mary&#x27;s Place Christian Brothers School in Dublin. It was at a performance of Palestrina&#x27;s Missa Papae Marcelli at St. Teresa&#x27;s Carmelite Church in Clarendon Street in 1898 that this choir came to the attention of Edward Martyn, their founding sponsor. Martyn wished to promote the music of Palestrina which was espoused by Pope Pius X as a standard to which liturgical music should aspire. The Palestrina Choir was constituted and installed in the Pro-Cathedral on 1 January 1903 with O&#x27;Brien as director.

In the century since its foundation, the choir has had seven directors. Vincent O&#x27;Brien, director until 1946, was succeeded by his son, Oliver. In 1978, Fr Seán O hEarcaigh took over the baton from Oliver O&#x27;Brien. He was succeeded in 1982, by Ite O&#x27;Donovan and in 1996 by Comdt Joseph Ryan. Órla Barry was the director from the end of 1996 to 2001. As of 2013, the director was Blánaid Murphy. Over the years, the Palestrina Choir has attracted notable singers, including John McCormack who was a member of the choir from 1904 to 1905. The choir has travelled widely, singing at several cathedrals and venues throughout Ireland, Europe, and North America.

During the school term, the Palestrina Choir sing at Sunday morning Solemn Latin Mass (Novus Ordo), Friday evening Vespers &amp; Benediction of the Most Blessed Sacrament (5.15pm) and Mass (5.45pm). A girls&#x27; choir was formed in 2009.

<doc id="210265" wikidata="Q2605825" url="?curid=210265" title="Garbage Pail Kids">
<text>Garbage Pail Kids is a series of sticker trading cards produced by the Topps Company, originally released in 1985 and designed to parody the &quot;Cabbage Patch Kids&quot; dolls, which were popular at the time.

Each sticker card features a Garbage Pail Kid character having some comical abnormality or deformity, or suffering a terrible fate or death. The characters have humorous names involving word play (Adam Bomb) or alliteration (Blasted Billy). Two versions of each card were produced, with variations featuring the same artwork but a different character name, differentiated by an &quot;a&quot; or &quot;b&quot; letter following the card number. The sticker fronts are die-cut so that just the character with its nameplate and the &quot;GPK&quot; logo can be peeled from the backing. Many of the card backs feature puzzle pieces that form giant murals, while other flip-side subjects vary greatly among the various series, from humorous licenses and awards to comic strips and, in more recent releases, humorous Facebook profiles.

Fifteen original series (&quot;OS&quot;) of regular trading cards were released in the United States, with various sets released in other countries. Two large-format card editions were also released, as well as a set of fold-out posters. &quot;All-New Series&quot; (&quot;ANS&quot;) sets were introduced in 2003, &quot;Flashback&quot; re-releases began in 2010 and a &quot;Brand-New Series&quot; (&quot;BNS&quot;) was announced for 2012 with &quot;Brand New Series 2&quot;, &quot;Chrome S1&quot;, and &quot;BNS3&quot; following in 2013. A new format was released in 2014 using the year to designate the edition, followed by the release name of &quot;Series 1&quot;, which had an Olympics-style format. In 2016, the format was changed again to themed sets that spoofed different pop culture topics.

==History==
The series was the brainchild of cartoonist Art Spiegelman, then a consultant for Topps. He came up with the product idea after the success of his earlier creations &quot;Garbage Can-dy&quot; and &quot;Wacky Packages&quot;. The concept originally began as an unreleased &quot;Wacky Packages&quot; sticker for a 1985 series, but the management at Topps thought it would be a good idea for a separate spin-off series. Spiegelman and fellow cartoonist Mark Newgarden worked together as the editors and art directors of the project, Len Brown was the manager and the first run of the cards was drawn exclusively by artist John Pound. They were first issued in 1985. Following the initial success of the cards, several additional artists and writers were brought in to contribute to the series, including Jay Lynch, Tom Bunk and James Warhola, among others.

==International versions==
The cards were also known as &quot;Bukimi Kun&quot; [/&quot;Mr. Creepy&quot;] in Japan, &quot;The Garbage Gang&quot; in Australia and New Zealand, &#x27; [&quot;The Garbage Gang&quot;] in Spain, &quot;Havurat Ha-Zevel&quot; [&#x27;/&quot;The Garbage Gang&quot;] in Israel, &#x27; [&quot;Trashlings&quot;] in Latin America, &quot;/&quot; [&quot;Trash Gang&quot;/&quot;Crazymania&quot;] in Brazil, &#x27; [&quot;Snotlings&quot;] in Italy, &#x27; [&quot;The Filthies&quot;] in France and Belgium and &#x27; [&quot;The Totally Broken Kids&quot;] in Germany and other German speaking countries, e.g. Austria.

===Variations===
A smaller-sized card format was released in Australia and New Zealand. Each pack contained three stickers and the &quot;peel here&quot; arrow pointed to the top left area since there was no die-cut scoring. Initially in New Zealand, a &quot;Series 6&quot; of the Garbage Pail Kids was released as a market test (this version was a mix of the United States &quot;Series 6&quot; and &quot;7&quot;). After this success, &quot;Series 1&quot; was released in Australia and New Zealand known as &quot;The Garbage Gang&quot; and was identical to the United States version (albeit smaller in size). The first series was released in Australia and New Zealand in 1989 with different versions: the Australian stickers were darker, had a different banner and some of the names were changed to reflect cultural differences. From &quot;Series 2&quot; onward, the same version was released in Australia and New Zealand. &quot;Series 4&quot; was the last release of &quot;The Garbage Gang&quot;.

==Commercial success==
The commercial success of the trading cards led to the production of a live-action movie, &quot;The Garbage Pail Kids Movie&quot;, in 1987. An animated television series was also created in 1987, but its initial scheduled broadcast in the U.S. was postponed due to parental complaints. The show did make a brief appearance on U.S. television years after it was originally intended to air and was also briefly aired in Europe. The movie was released on DVD by MGM Home Entertainment on July 12, 2005 (the original VHS had been distributed by Paramount), and the animated TV series was later also released on DVD by CBS Home Entertainment on April 4, 2006 (again with distribution by Paramount). A similar set of 160 trading cards, called &quot;The Sloppy Slobs&quot;, was released in Italy in 1993.

==Controversies and lawsuit==
===School ban===
During the height of the cards&#x27; popularity, &quot;Garbage Pail Kids&quot; were banned in many schools. One of the main reasons for the ban was that teachers cited them as distractions during class.

===Mexican ban===
Since 1988, any export and import of &quot;Garbage Pail Kids&quot; is banned in Mexico due to the approval of a reform to the Export and Import Law, banning all representations of minors &quot;in a degrading or ridiculous manner, in attitudes of incitement to violence, self-destruction or in any other form of antisocial behavior&quot;, citing &quot;Garbage Pail Kids&quot; as an example.

They are also prohibited from being imported into Australia.

===Trademark infringement lawsuit===
Topps was sued by the rightsholders of &quot;Cabbage Patch Kids&quot;, Original Appalachian Artworks, for trademark infringement. As part of the out-of-court settlement, Topps agreed to modify the appearance of the Garbage Pail Kids to remove the resemblance between the characters and to change the logo design. Production of the cards themselves continued, but by 1988 sales had dwindled and a planned &quot;Series 16&quot; was never produced.

===BTS Bruisers===
In March 2021, Topps released a sticker card depicting a Whac-A-Mole game with members of K-pop group BTS being severely beaten with a Grammy award. After public backlash due to the card&#x27;s perceived anti-Asian tone, the company apologized and withdrew the card.

==&quot;All-New Series&quot; sets==

In 2003, Topps reintroduced &quot;Garbage Pail Kids&quot; with all-new artwork, dubbed the &quot;All-New Series&quot; (&quot;ANS&quot;). &quot;ANS1&quot; was entirely made up of artwork intended for release in the 1980s as &quot;Series 16&quot;, but 2004&#x27;s &quot;ANS2&quot; featured brand-new and original concepts. Unique numbers on the backs of silver foil and gold foil insert cards could be redeemed online at the official Garbage Pail Kids website, where visitors could build and &quot;gross out&quot; their own Garbage Pail Kids; as the number of unique code numbers applied to the character increased, the grosser it became. Less than six months later, &quot;ANS3&quot; was released.

In 2005, Topps celebrated the 20th anniversary of the GPK franchise with special &quot;Sketch Card&quot; original art inserts for its &quot;ANS4&quot; set. These were limited to one randomly inserted card per hobby-exclusive box (available only from speciality retailers) and featured original artwork by series regulars John Pound, Tom Bunk and Jay Lynch, as well as guest artists Strephon Taylor, John Czop, Don Perlin and Justin Green. Although a regular to the series with over 35 paintings, Luis Diaz was not involved in the sketch cards due to a previous financial dispute with Topps from years earlier.

In 2006, &quot;ANS5&quot; was released with 40 more new kids (each with an a/b twin), followed by &quot;ANS6&quot; in early 2007. January 2008 saw the release of &quot;ANS7&quot; which expanded the base set to 55 new characters and was the last set to feature new artwork until 2010&#x27;s &quot;Flashback Series 1&quot; subset of six previously unpublished &quot;lost&quot; kids.

The &quot;ANS&quot; cards differ from the original series (&quot;OS&quot;) in a number of ways, the most obvious being the upgraded quality of the card stock with a glossy protective surface. The &quot;ANS&quot; releases also changed the card numbering format: &quot;OS&quot; cards used a continuous numbering pattern so that each new set would pick up where the last one ended (e.g. &quot;OS1&quot; ended at #41a/b and &quot;OS2&quot; picked up at #42a/b, while &quot;ANS&quot; reset the numbering back to #1a/b with each subsequent release). Each &quot;ANS&quot; also featured special chase cards randomly inserted in packs; for example, foil cards show characters from the original series (with modified artwork due to the lawsuit), &quot;Scratch &#x27;n Stink&quot; cards, collectible card game cards, temporary tattoos, 3D pop-up cards, alphabet cards, activity cards, magnets, lenticular &quot;Loco Motion&quot; cards and die-cut jigsaw puzzle cards, along with special bonus cards available only at participating retailers in either &quot;bonus boxes&quot; or rack-packs; these bonus stickers were the first cards not to have a twin set.

==&quot;Flashback&quot; re-releases==
Topps released a 25th-anniversary &quot;Flashback&quot; set on February 24, 2010, featuring reprints of characters from the original 1985–87 &quot;GPK&quot; series (eight each from &quot;OS1&quot; to &quot;OS8&quot;) plus six previously unpublished &quot;lost&quot; characters and 10 &quot;Where Are They Now?&quot; cards, the latter showing classic GPKs drawn as they would have appeared if they had been released at that time. Packs contained randomly inserted chase cards, including lenticular &quot;Loco Motion&quot; cards, authentic printing plates, four levels of parallels and hand-drawn artist sketches by pop-culture artists, including Layron DeJarnette, Brent Engstrom, Dave Gross, Mark Pingitore, Joe Simko, Colin Walton, Neil Camera, Fred Wheaton, Jeff Zapata and veteran &quot;GPK&quot; artists Tom Bunk and Jay Lynch.

A second &quot;Flashback&quot; set was released on February 23, 2011, with 65 more &quot;OS&quot; reprints from &quot;Series 1&quot; to &quot;9&quot; plus five more &quot;lost&quot; kids, 10 new &quot;Where Are They Now?&quot; cards, five 3D cards (resembling holograms but in full color), unique artist sketches and 10 &quot;Adam Mania&quot; cards showing variants of Adam Bomb&#x27;s iconic mushroom cloud, plus parallels of the base and &quot;Adam Mania&quot; sets.

&quot;GPK Flashback Series 3&quot; followed on November 2, 2011, with 65 &quot;OS&quot; reprints, four more &quot;lost&quot; kids, 10 new &quot;WATN?&quot; cards, five more 3D cards, 10 more &quot;Adam Mania&quot; cards, plus artist sketches and parallels.

==Book==

Topps and Abrams Books released a hardcover book that showcases the first five series. The cover depicts a wrapper from the very first series released back in 1985. Each card is displayed with the &quot;a&quot; name and the &quot;b&quot; name on the bottom corner of the page. It also included four new chase cards that were wrapped in cellophane and adhered to the inside back cover of the book, but were easily removable without running the risk of damaging the book.

==&quot;Brand-New Series&quot; sets==

In 2012, Topps announced it would reboot the Garbage Pail Kids franchise with new character and content themes more reminiscent of the original 1980s series in a set called &quot;Brand-New Series 1&quot; (&quot;BNS1&quot;). The set was released on October 24, 2012. &quot;BNS1&quot; features 55 new &quot;GPK&quot; characters, a reality TV subset, motion cards, mix &#x27;n&#x27; match stickers, parallels, artist sketch cards and code cards redeemable for a chance to be painted as a GPK in the next &quot;BNS&quot;. &quot;BNS2&quot; was released in March and features 55 new characters, 18 reimagined characters, lenticular cards, glow-in-the-dark cards and folded cards. Unlike the &quot;All-New Series&quot; set and like the old series sets, the numbering of &quot;BNS&quot; continues where the previous series ended. They have now announced that there will be a &quot;BNS3&quot; released in the middle of October, after the release of the &quot;Chrome&quot; edition in August.

==&quot;Chrome Series&quot; sets==
In October 2013, Topps re-released the original &quot;Series 1&quot; as a metallic chromium card set containing all 41 kids, plus 14 previously unpublished &quot;lost&quot; kids.

On July 30, 2014, Topps re-released 1985&#x27;s original &quot;Series 2&quot; set, plus 13 returning characters from &quot;Series 2&quot; characters that have been reimagined in previous &quot;Garbage Pail Kids&quot; sets also as a set of metallic chromium cards. &quot;Chrome Series&quot; cards are thicker than the original cards and are not stickers.

==&quot;2014 Series 1&quot;==
Topps released a series of all-new cards with brand-new artwork for 2014. Like the older cards, these have activities on the back of the cards, including checklists, puzzles and Facebook profiles.

==&quot;30th Anniversary Series&quot;==
In July 2015, Topps released the &quot;30th Anniversary Series&quot; with 110 a/b cards (220 cards total). The numbering differed from previous series in that, instead of ranging from #1–110a/b, it had several themed subsets, each of which started at #1 a/b with the subsets being checklist cards featuring variations of Adam Bomb (#1–2a/b), including &quot;Adam Bomb: Don&#x27;t Push My Button&quot;, featuring classic &quot;GPK&quot; characters pressing Adam Bomb&#x27;s button (#1–10a/b), &quot;Artistic Impression&quot;, featuring historical art as &quot;GPK&quot; characters (#1–10a/b), &quot;Artistic Interpretation&quot;, featuring characters drawn by guest artists (#1–5a/b), &quot;Comic Book Covers&quot;, featuring art from the comic books (#1–7a/b), &quot;Cutting Room Floor&quot;, featuring rejected concepts (#1–5a/b), &quot;Garbage Pail Kids&#x27; Kids&quot;, featuring the children of classic GPKs (#1–10a/b), &quot;Garbage Pail Pets&quot;, featuring animals as Garbage Pail Kids (#1–10a/b), &quot;Garbage Pail Presidents&quot;, featuring 10 former U.S. Presidents as Garbage Pail Kids (#1–10a/b), &quot;Lost Original Art&quot;, featuring the original paintings of classic GPKs which were never before published (#1–6a/b), &quot;Zoom Out&quot;, featuring zoomed-out GPKs showing what happened in the background (#1–10a/b) and &quot;″80s Spoofs&quot;, featuring parodies of things that were popular in the 1980s (#1–25a/b).

== Yearly themed series ==
After the &quot;30th Anniversary Series&quot;, Topps began using a new formula that structured each series with an overall theme divided into subsets focusing on particular topics. In January 2016, &quot;As American as Apple Pie In Your Face!&quot; put GPKs in situations that parodied American culture. A second 2016 series followed in April called &quot;Prime Slime Trashy TV&quot; with humorous takes on popular television shows. The first series for 2017 was January&#x27;s &quot;Adam-geddon&quot;, which put the Garbage Pail Kids (including some classic kids) in perilous end-times scenarios. Topps announced that the second series for 2017 will arrive in October and be called &quot;Battle of the Bands&quot;, caricaturing popular music acts and album covers. The yearly themed series, along with their timing around the 2016 presidential elections, provided Topps with a perfect opportunity to spoof American politics. In July 2015, they released the “Thirtieth Anniversary” series, which featured ten additional “Garbage Pail Presidents.” This was followed in January 2016 by “The 2016 Presidential Candidates,” and in September 2016, they launched &quot;DisgRace to the White House.&quot; The series culminated with &quot;Best of the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election&quot; and the &quot;2017 Presidential Inaug-Hurl Ceremony&quot; in January 2017.

==Movies==
===&quot;The Garbage Pail Kids Movie&quot;===

On August 21, 1987, a live-action film based on the card characters was released. Its campy production made it both a critical and commercial flop, opening poorly in 374 theaters with initial receipts of $661,512 and total gross receipts of $1,576,615, making a 60% profit on its $1 million budget. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 0% critic rating. The film is considered one of the worst films ever made. Topps featured advertisements for the movie on the original &quot;Series 9&quot; and &quot;10&quot; box-topper poster and variant wrapper.

===Cancelled remake===
On March 12, 2012, it was announced that Michael Eisner&#x27;s Tornante Company would be producing a new movie based on the Garbage Pail Kids, likely with computer-generated character imagery. Michael Vukadinovich was hired to write the screenplay for the film and PES has been hired to direct.

==Television==
In May 2021, it was announced that a new animated series is in the works at HBO Max, and would be co-produced by Topps, Tornante Company and Danny McBride&#x27;s production company Rough House Pictures. In October 2023, director David Gordon Green confirmed the series is still in development.

<text>The Škoda 100 mm Model 16/19 (oficially 10 cm horská houfnice vz. 16/19) was a mountain howitzer modified by Škoda Works from the design of the M.16, and its most notable difference was the longer barrel. It is unclear if they were newly built, or rebuilt from older howitzers. The Czechoslovak Army used this gun in both its 100 mm and 105 mm variants. After 1938, the guns were used by the Wehrmacht as 10 cm GebH 16/19(t) and 10.5 cm GebH(t). In addition, some of these guns were also used by Italy and Turkey, although this needs confirmation. The gun broke down into 3 loads for transport. The gun crew was protected by an armoured shield.

<doc id="210269" wikidata="Q502781" url="?curid=210269" title="Intervertebral disc">
<text>An intervertebral disc (British English), also spelled intervertebral disk (American English), lies between adjacent vertebrae in the vertebral column. Each disc forms a fibrocartilaginous joint (a symphysis), to allow slight movement of the vertebrae, to act as a ligament to hold the vertebrae together, and to function as a shock absorber for the spine.

==Structure==

Intervertebral discs consist of an outer fibrous ring, the &quot;anulus (or annulus) fibrosus disci intervertebralis&quot;, which surrounds an inner gel-like center, the &quot;nucleus pulposus&quot;. 

The &quot;anulus fibrosus&quot; consists of several layers (laminae) of fibrocartilage made up of both type I and type II collagen. Type I is concentrated toward the edge of the ring, where it provides greater strength. The stiff laminae can withstand compressive forces. 

The fibrous intervertebral disc contains the &quot;nucleus pulposus&quot; and this helps to distribute pressure evenly across the disc. This prevents the development of stress concentrations which could cause damage to the underlying vertebrae or to their endplates. The nucleus pulposus contains loose fibers suspended in a mucoprotein gel. The nucleus of the disc acts as a shock absorber, absorbing the impact of the body&#x27;s activities and keeping the two vertebrae separated. It is the remnant of the notochord.

There is one disc between each pair of vertebrae, except for the first cervical segment, the &quot;atlas&quot;. The &quot;atlas&quot; is a ring around the roughly cone-shaped extension of the &quot;axis&quot; (second cervical segment). The axis acts as a post around which the atlas can rotate, allowing the neck to swivel. There are 23 discs in the human spine: 6 in the neck (cervical) region, 12 in the middle back (thoracic) region, and 5 in the lower back (lumbar) region. 

Discs are named by the vertebral body above and below. For example, the disc between the fifth and sixth cervical vertebrae is designated &quot;C5-6&quot;.

===Development===
During development and at birth, vertebral discs have some vascular supply to the cartilage endplates and the anulus fibrosus. These quickly deteriorate leaving almost no direct blood supply in healthy adults.

===Intervertebral disc space===
The &quot;intervertebral disc space&quot; is typically defined on an X-ray photograph as the space between adjacent vertebrae. In healthy patients, this corresponds to the size of the intervertebral disc. The size of the space can be altered in pathological conditions such as discitis (infection of the intervertebral disc).

==Function==
The intervertebral disc functions to separate the vertebrae from each other and provides the surface for the shock-absorbing gel of the nucleus pulposus. The nucleus pulposus of the disc functions to distribute hydraulic pressure in all directions within each intervertebral disc under compressive loads. The nucleus pulposus consists of large vacuolated notochord cells, small chondrocyte-like cells, collagen fibrils, and aggrecan, a proteoglycan that aggregates by binding to hyaluronan. Attached to each aggrecan molecule are glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains of chondroitin sulfate and keratan sulfate. Increasing the amount of negatively charged aggrecan increases oncotic pressure, resulting in a shift of extracellular fluid from the outside to the inside of the nucleus pulposus. The amount of glycosaminoglycans (and hence water) decreases with age and degeneration.

==Clinical significance==
Anything arising from the intervertebral disc may be termed &quot;discogenic&quot; in particular when referring to associated pain as &quot;discogenic pain&quot;.

===Herniation===
A spinal disc herniation, commonly referred to as a slipped disc, can happen when unbalanced mechanical pressures substantially deform the anulus fibrosus, allowing part of the nucleus to obtrude. These events can occur during peak physical performance, during traumas, or as a result of chronic deterioration (typically accompanied with poor posture), and has been associated with a &quot;Propionibacterium acnes&quot; infection. Both the deformed anulus and the gel-like material of the nucleus pulposus can be forced laterally or posteriorly, distorting local muscle function and putting pressure on the nearby nerve. This can give symptoms typical of nerve root entrapment, which can vary between paresthesia, numbness, chronic and/or acute pain, either locally or along the dermatome served by the entrapped nerve, loss of muscle tone and decreased homeostatic performance. The disc is not physically slipped; it bulges, usually in just one direction.

Another kind of herniation, of the nucleus pulposus, can happen as a result of the formation of Schmorl&#x27;s nodes on the intervertebral disc. This is referred to as &quot;vertical disc herniation&quot;.

===Degeneration===
Before age 40, approximately 25% of people show evidence of disc degeneration at one or more levels. Beyond age 40, more than 60% of people show evidence of disc degeneration at one or more levels on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These degenerative changes are a normal part of the ageing process and do not correlate to pain.

One effect of aging and disc degeneration is that the nucleus pulposus begins to dehydrate and the concentration of proteoglycans in the matrix decreases, thus limiting the ability of the disc to absorb shock. This general shrinking of disc size is partially responsible for the common decrease in height as humans age. The anulus fibrosus also becomes weaker with age and has an increased risk of tearing. In addition, the cartilage endplates begin thinning, fissures begin to form, and there is sclerosis of the subchondral bone. Since the fissures are formed in the anulus fibrosus due to osteo-arthritic bones or degeneration in general, the inner nucleus pulposus can seep out and put pressure on any number of vertebral nerves. A herniated disc can cause mild to severe pain such as sciatica and treatment for herniated discs range from physical therapy to surgery.(see also: Intervertebral disc arthroplasty) Other degeneration of the vertebral column includes diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH) which is the calcification or ossification of the ligaments surrounding the vertebrae. This degeneration causes stiffness and sometimes even curvature in the lumbar and thoraco-lumbar spinal region.
Burgeoning evidence suggests that long-term running may mitigate age-related degeneration within lumbar intervertebral discs 

===Scoliosis===

While this may not cause pain in some people, in others it may cause chronic pain. Other spinal disorders can affect the morphology of intervertebral discs. For example, patients with scoliosis commonly have calcium deposits (ectopic calcification) in the cartilage endplate and sometimes in the disc itself.
Herniated discs are also found to have a higher degree of cellular senescence than non-herniated discs. In addition to scoliosis, which is the lateral &#x27;S&#x27; curvature of the spine, the fused vertebrae can also experience other abnormalities such as kyphosis (hunchback) which shows in old age, or lordosis (swayback), which is often present in pregnancy and obesity.

== Etymology ==
The Latin word &quot;anulus&quot; means &quot;little ring&quot;; it is the diminutive of &quot;anus&quot; (&quot;ring&quot;). However, modern English also spells the word more phonetically &quot;annulus&quot;, as with the term annular eclipse, where the moon blocks the sun except for a bright ring around it.

<doc id="210279" wikidata="Q1508" url="?curid=210279" title="Makati">
<text>Makati ( ; ), officially the City of Makati (), is a highly urbanized city in the National Capital Region of the Philippines, known for being one of the leading financial centers in the country. As of 2013, the city has the highest concentration of multinational and local corporations in the Philippines. Major banks, corporations, department stores as well as foreign embassies are based in Makati. Makati is also known for being a major cultural and entertainment hub in Metro Manila. According to the 2020 census, it had a population of 629,616 people, making it the 47th most populous city in the country and 8th most populous in Metro Manila. Makati is one of the most densely populated city proper areas globally, ranking 8th worldwide and 2nd in the Philippines, after Manila, with a population density of 28,975 inhabitants per square kilometer (75,044 inhabitants per square mile). 

In 2023, the ten Embo barangays were removed from Makati&#x27;s jurisdiction as a result of the Makati–Taguig boundary dispute ruling, resulting in a reduction of the city&#x27;s population to about 292,743. The daytime population of the city is estimated to be more than three million during a typical working day because of the large number of people who go to the city to work, shop, and do business.

==Etymology==
The name of Makati originates from the Tagalog word &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;[of the] low tide&quot; or &quot;[of the] ebb tide&quot;, attributing to the tidal movements of the adjacent Pasig River. Alternatively, the word may also mean &quot;itchy&quot;, attributed to the &quot;lipang kalabaw&quot; plant (Dendrocnide meyeniana) that once grew in the area.

Previously, it was named San Pedro [de] Macati, a name stylized in Spanish. The first part of the name is derived from Spanish for Saint Peter, the then-town&#x27;s patron saint, chosen by his namesake, Spanish captain Pedro de Brito, as the patron of his &quot;encomienda&quot; &quot;Hacienda Pedro&quot; (now part of the present-day city). Having been named as such, residents corrupted the name to “Sampiro,” which used to refer to both the then-town and its namesake church.

==History==

===Early history===
Parts of Makati were once subject to the pre-Hispanic Kingdom of Namayan, whose capital is now in the Santa Ana district of Manila. 

===Spanish colonial era===
Parts of Makati became a &quot;visita&quot; of the then-town of Santa Ana de Sapa in 1578, during the Spanish colonial era. In 1589, Captain Pedro de Brito, then an aide to the Spanish Army chief of staff, purchased a land encompassing the present-day Poblacion with a public bid of 1,400 pesos, and established his &quot;encomienda&quot; named &quot;Hacienda Pedro&quot;. In 1608, he and his wife Ana de Herrera donated half of land to the Jesuits, with the condition of building a church in honor of his namesake, Saint Peter the Apostle, and endowed 14,000 pesos for its construction. The church, later known as San Pedro Macati Church, was completed in 1620.

====Establishment and early development====
While under the jurisdiction of the Franciscan friars during the 17th century, it was established as a town on June 1, 1670 under the name &quot;San Pedro Macati&quot; out of Santa Ana de Sapa. The nearby Nuestra Señora de Gracia Church, changed into the &quot;Our Lady of Guadalupe&quot; church, welcomed an image of the Virgin Mary and devotees from Mexico, and one person from a family in Makati, the Montes De Oca family, which produced Isidoro Montes de Oca, who became pivotal in the Mexican war of Independence against Spain. This parish had a large spiritual jurisdiction in the province of Tondo (later known as Manila), extending up to the present-day Muntinlupa.

In 1851, Don José Bonifacio Roxas, an ancestor of the Zóbel de Ayala family, purchased the estate from the Jesuits for 52,800 pesos and named it &quot;Hacienda San Pedro de Macati&quot;. Since then, the development of Makati has remained linked with the Zóbel de Ayala family and their company, Ayala Corporation. In 1890, San Pedro de Macati was proclaimed as a public town of Manila province.

===American occupation===

In 1901, San Pedro Macati was incorporated into the newly established province of Rizal. On February 28, 1914, the name of the town was shortened to its present name of &quot;Makati&quot;, under Philippine Legislature Act No. 2390.
As of 1934, Makati had 14 barangays according to the Rizal provincial directory, namely: Poblacion, Comandante Carmona, Culiculi (present-day Pio del Pilar), Guadalupe, Fort McKinley, Malapadnabato (present-day West Rembo), Masilang (present-day South Cembo), Kasilawan, Olimpia (Olympia), Palanan, Pinagkaisajan (Pinagkaisahan), Rural, Sampalukan, and Tejeros. Fort McKinley, Malapadnabato, and Masilang were previously parts of Pateros.

===Japanese occupation===

On January 1, 1942, Makati was one of the municipalities of Rizal merged alongside Manila and Quezon City to form the City of Greater Manila as an emergency measure by President Manuel L. Quezon. It regained its pre-war status as a municipality of Rizal when the City of Greater Manila was dissolved by President Sergio Osmeña effective August 1, 1945.

===Post-war Era===
After the destruction that the Second World War brought upon Manila, and the subsequent closure of Nielson Field, the town grew rapidly, and real estate values boomed. The first of the planned communities (in what are now the barangays Forbes Park, Urdaneta, San Lorenzo, and Bel-Air established during those times) were established in the 1950s with the efforts of its landowner, Ayala y Compañía. At the same time, Fort McKinley, then renamed Fort Bonifacio, and the then Philippine Army headquarters, became the starting point for the building up of seven more communities by military families who worked in the base area. New office buildings were built on what is now the Makati Central Business District (CBD). Since the late 1960s, Makati has transformed into the financial and commercial capital of the country. In December 1972, two barrios (later barangay) of Makati were established at the Inner Fort Bonifacio area: Post Proper Northside and Post Proper Southside. 

On November 7, 1975, Makati was separated from Rizal province to become part of the National Capital Region as a component municipality.

===Martial Law and Corazon Aquino eras===
The beginning months of the 1970s marked a period of turmoil and change in the Philippines, particularly for the areas near the capital. A sudden glut of debt driven public works projects in the late 1960s led the Philippine economy to a sudden downward turn known as the 1969 Philippine balance of payments crisis, which in turn led to a period of economic difficulty and social unrest. With only a year left in his last constitutionally allowed term as president Ferdinand Marcos placed the Philippines under Martial Law in September 1972 and thus retained the position for fourteen more years. This period in Philippine history is remembered for the Marcos administration&#x27;s record of human rights abuses, particularly targeting political opponents, student activists, journalists, religious workers, farmers, and others who fought against the Marcos dictatorship.

Makati was the setting of what is believed to be the single biggest case of involuntary disappearance during martial law – the case of the &quot;Southern Tagalog 10&quot; – ten activists from the nearby Southern Tagalog region, mostly in their twenties, who were abducted in late July 1977 at the Makati Medical Center.

Following the assassination of opposition senator Benigno Aquino Jr. on August 21, 1983, Makati became a nexus for protests against the dictatorship of President Ferdinand Marcos. Known as the &quot;Confetti Revolution&quot;, the demonstrations held in the central business district were led partly by employees of major corporations based in the area, culminating in the 1986 People Power Revolution that toppled Marcos&#x27; 20-year authoritarian regime. His political rival and successor, Corazon Aquino–the wife of the deceased senator Aquino–became the eleventh and first female president of the Philippines. After Mayor Nemesio Yabut succumbed to an illness on February 25, 1986, coinciding with the last day of the People Power Revolution, Aquino appointed Jejomar Binay as acting mayor of Makati two days later; he was subsequently elected as mayor in 1988.

In January 1986, by virtue of Presidential Proclamation No. 2475, s. 1986, the Fort Bonifacio Military Reservation, including the Embo barangays of Cembo, South Cembo, West Rembo, East Rembo, Comembo, Pembo and Pitogo were declared as part of Makati. The proclamation was contested by Taguig because it altered the municipality&#x27;s boundaries unconstitutionally, which resulted in a three-decade long territorial dispute.

During the 1989 Philippine coup attempt, the Makati central business district was occupied by Reform the Armed Forces Movement forces seeking to overthrow President Corazon Aquino. The resulting standoff lasted from December 2 to 9 and contributed to massive financial losses incurred due to the paralysis in the economic hub.

===Cityhood===
On January 2, 1995, President Fidel V. Ramos signed Republic Act No. 7854, making Makati the seventh city in Metro Manila. The law was approved by a plebiscite one month later, on February 2, 1995, by majority of voters.

===Contemporary===
On May 17, 2000, at 5:02 p.m. PHT, the Glorietta mall located inside the Ayala Center was bombed, injuring 13 persons. According to local authorities, the homemade bomb originated from the restroom of a restaurant and affected an adjacent video arcade. The bombing was said to be the precursor of the May 21, 2000 SM Megamall bombing and the Rizal Day bombings.

On October 19, 2007, an explosion in Glorietta 2 left eleven people dead and injured more than a hundred. Initially, authorities said that it was caused by a liquefied petroleum gas explosion at a restaurant, but later began investigating the possibility that the explosion may have been a C-4 bomb.

In April 2022, Makati lost in the three decades-long territorial dispute with Taguig, which was ruled with finality a year later in April 2023. The city was ordered to refrain from exercising jurisdiction over the ten Embo barangays, which were reintegrated to Taguig. Makati lost an estimated 300,000 people from its population following the lost of the Embo barangays. The city also lost its boundaries with Pasig and Pateros, while the city borders of Taguig were extended up to Mandaluyong. Makati&#x27;s 2nd Congressional District was put it into limbo in the aftermath of losing the Embo barangays, as it does not meet the constitutional requirement of 250,000 people since 10 out of 13 barangays are now under Taguig. There is a possibility that Makati may be reduced back to a single congressional district but pending legislation, the status quo of its existence is expected to prevail.

==Geography==

Makati is located within the circle of 14′40″ °N and 121′3″ °E right at the center of Metro Manila. The city is bounded on the north by the Pasig River, facing Mandaluyong, on the east by Taguig, on the southwest by Pasay, and on the northwest by the city of Manila. Creeks such as the Estero de Tripa de Gallina mostly on the west, Maricaban Creek on the south, and San Jose Creek on the east, form parts of Makati&#x27;s city boundary. Makati has a total land area of . Its territory also surrounds the Manila South Cemetery, an exclave of San Andres district of Manila. 

===Barangays===
Makati is politically subdivided into 23 barangays. These barangays are group into two congressional districts, with each district being represented by a congressman in the House of Representatives. The 1st Congressional District is composed of the barangays straddling EDSA, the barangays to the north and west of them, while excluding Guadalupe Viejo, while the 2nd Congressional District is to the south and east of the 1st District, including the aforementioned barangay. The districts elect the sixteen members of the city council, eight from each of the two councilor districts that are coextensive with the congressional districts.

From 1986 to 2023, Cembo, South Cembo, West Rembo, East Rembo, Comembo, Pembo, Pitogo, Post Proper Northside, Post Proper Southside, and Rizal, which collectively known as the Embo barangays, were declared as part of Makati by virtue of Proclamation No. 2475 issued by President Ferdinand Marcos in 1986. The Proclamation unconstitutionally placed Fort Bonifacio and the Embo barangays as part of Makati, where they were represented by Makati&#x27;s 2nd Congressional District until 2023. They were reintegrated to Taguig by the 2022 Supreme Court ruling regarding the territorial dispute between Makati and Taguig that was ruled with finality in 2023, declaring that the entirety of Fort Bonifacio, including the Embo barangays, are part of Taguig.

===Climate===
Under the Köppen climate classification system, the city features a tropical monsoon climate. Together with the rest of the Philippines, Makati lies entirely within the tropics. Its proximity to the equator means that the temperature range is very small, rarely going lower than or going higher than . However, humidity levels are usually very high which makes it feel much warmer. It has a distinct, albeit relatively short dry season from January through May, and a relatively lengthy wet season from June through December.

=== Climate change ===
The Global Climate Risk Index 2021 lists the Philippines as one of countries most affected by catastrophes due to extreme weather events. Makati is a low-lying, coastal city vulnerable to natural calamities intensified by climate change, such as typhoons, floods, and landslides. The city&#x27;s disaster risk reduction and management office noted a rise in rainfall experienced by the city over the years, particularly during the rainy season.

In August 2022, the city government declared a climate emergency, amid rising sea levels and global temperature changes.

Makati undertakes climate adaptation programs to address vulnerabilities to climate change, which include health services to residents, emergency response, and environmental management and protection. It intends to increase projects to address climate change, including a planned purchase of more electric vehicles, installation of solar panels in public schools and government offices, and improvement of public transport to lessen greenhouse gas emissions.

===Cityscape===

==Demographics==
As of the 2020 census, Makati had a population of 629,616. The count was later reduced to 292,743 in 2023 based on the same census when the Embo barangays were transferred to Taguig as a result of the cities&#x27; territorial dispute ruling. Makati currently ranks 14th in population size within Metro Manila. A majority of Makati residents identified their religious affiliation as Roman Catholic. Other groups having large number of members in the city are the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Members Church of God International, Evangelical Christians, Iglesia ni Cristo, Protestantism, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism and Judaism.

Based on the city&#x27;s Transport and Traffic Improvement Plan 2004–2014, the city&#x27;s daytime population is estimated to be 3.7 million during weekdays, owing to the large number of people who come to work, do business, or shop.

The daily influx of people into the city provides the skilled labor force that allows Makati to handle the service requirements of domestic as well as international transactions; it also serves as the base of a large consumer market that fuels the retail and service trade in the city. At the same time, however, the large tidal population flows exert pressure on Makati&#x27;s environment, services, and utilities, most noticeably causing large traffic volumes along the major road corridors leading to the city as well as within and at the periphery of the central business district.

==Economy and infrastructure==
The economy of Makati is diverse and multifaceted. Makati is the home to the Ayala Triangle in the Makati Central Business District, which is home to many multinational companies, banks, and other major businesses. A few upscale boutiques, restaurants, and a park called Ayala Triangle Gardens are also located in the area. The Makati Business Club has over 800 chief executive officers and senior executives, which represents 450 of the country&#x27;s biggest corporations. The biggest trading floor of the Philippine Stock Exchange used to be situated along the city&#x27;s Ayala Avenue, before the stock exchange moved their headquarters to the Bonifacio Global City in Taguig. The city has an office space supply of as of end-2021, making it a dominant office market in Metro Manila alongside Taguig and Pasig. As of 2023, Taguig had the highest share of existing office supply in Metro Manila at 26 percent, followed by Makati at 20 percent. 

Makati is the second top revenue earner in the National Capital Region, following Quezon City at first place. The city has not increased its tax rates since its new Revenue Code took effect in 2006, and has been free of deficit for about three decades.

Most of the tallest skyscrapers in Metro Manila and the Philippines are located in Makati. Among them are the PBCom Tower, Trump Tower Manila and Gramercy Residences in Century City, Discovery Primea, Shang Salcedo Place, and G.T. International Tower. PBCom Tower along Ayala Avenue was the country&#x27;s tallest office building from 2001 to 2017, with a total ground-to-architectural-top height of . It was surpassed in 2017 by the Metrobank Center in Taguig with a total architectural height of .

In addition, Evangelista Street in Barangay Bangkal is known for being the site of automobile repair shops, replacement automobile parts stores, tire and wheel stores, car air-conditioning unit repair shops, and car tint stores, almost similar to Banawe Street in Quezon City.

===Shopping centers===

Makati is one of the most well-known shopping hubs of Metro Manila. Various shopping centers, offering both international and local retail shops, high-end boutiques, dining outlets and entertainment facilities can be found around the city.

The Ayala Center is a major commercial development operated by Ayala Land located in the Makati CBD. The center is known for its wide array of shopping, entertainment, and cultural offerings, making it a premier shopping and cultural district in the metropolis. It is a vast walkable complex with high-end malls that houses cinemas, local and international shops, homegrown restaurants and international food chains. The shopping malls that are located at the Ayala Center include Greenbelt, Glorietta, Park Square, The Link, and Ayala Malls One Ayala. The Ayala Center is also home to three department stores, namely: SM Makati, Rustan&#x27;s, and The Landmark.

Other shopping centers in Makati include Power Plant Mall at Rockwell Center, Century City Mall at Century City, Ayala Malls Circuit at Circuit Makati, Cash &amp; Carry Mall, Walter Mart Makati, Makati Central Square (formerly Makati Cinema Square), Guadalupe Commercial Center, Paseo de Magallanes, and pocket malls at various high-rise residential condominiums or office buildings in the city.

==Education==

The University of Makati, a public, non-profit university, is the city&#x27;s flagship university located in West Rembo, its former barangay that is now part of Taguig. Other institutions of higher education located in the city include the Asian Institute of Management (AIM), iAcademy, Asian Seminary of Christian Ministries (ASCM), Don Bosco Technical Institute of Makati, Assumption College San Lorenzo, Saint Paul College of Makati, Our Lady of Guadalupe Minor Seminary, and Asia Pacific College.

Several higher education institutions headquartered outside the city have established branch or satellite campuses in Makati. These include the Ateneo de Manila University (Ateneo Professional Schools), De La Salle University, Far Eastern University, Mapúa University, Lyceum of the Philippines University, Centro Escolar University, and AMA Computer College Colleges, among others.

Australian Catholic University, a foreign institution, maintains an extension program in Makati. 

As of 2024, the Schools Division Office (SDO) of Makati City oversees 23 public schools: 16 elementary schools and 7 high schools. In 2023, as a result of the Makati–Taguig boundary dispute ruling, 14 public elementary and high schools, including the Makati Science High School, were transferred from the SDO of Makati City to the SDO of Taguig City and Pateros. Makati later appealed to the national Department of Education to retain the management of Makati Science High School, Fort Bonifacio Elementary School, and Fort Bonifacio High School, but the city&#x27;s appeal was denied, leaving the city without a science high school.

Rafael Palma Elementary School, which is under the jurisdiction of the neighboring city of Manila&#x27;s Division of City Schools, is located in Barangay La Paz, near the Makati–Manila boundary.

==Culture and sports==
Makati is home to a number of fine art museums, colonial-era churches, and recreation areas. Along the south-eastern border of Makati in Forbes Park are the Manila Golf Club and the Manila Polo Club. The Manila Golf Club features an 18-hole golf course. The Manila Polo Club counts among its polo enthusiasts some of the country&#x27;s wealthiest people. The Makati Sports Club in Salcedo Village is another popular place for sports. The Makati Coliseum is another famous sports landmark in the city, where some of the biggest sports gatherings are held.

The city&#x27;s only professional sports team was the Makati OKBet Kings, which joined the Maharlika Pilipinas Basketball League in its second season.

In the northwest, the Blue Pitch at Circuit Makati is a multi-use stadium, used not just for football games but since 2017 serves as the primary hub of the Philippine-American Football League. The site of Circuit Makati was also previously occupied by the Santa Ana Park, a racetrack whose operations were transferred to Naic, Cavite, in 2009. The University of Makati Stadium, now part of Taguig, was the home venue of Philippines Football League club Kaya F.C.–Makati until the team&#x27;s move to Iloilo City. 
The Ayala Museum is a private fine arts and history museum housing various exhibitions such as the &quot;Gold of Ancestors,&quot; an exhibition of more than one thousand golden pre-Hispanic artifacts. Other popular museums also in Makati also include the Yuchengco Museum and the Museo ng Makati.

Makati has several Spanish-era churches, such as the Saints Peter and Paul Parish, Our Lady of Guadalupe Parish, and the Nuestra Señora de Gracia Church (Our Lady of Grace) in the old town. At the Greenbelt Park stands the modern domed Sto. Niño de Paz Greenbelt Chapel. Located in Forbes Park is the Santuario de San Antonio, a popular church for weddings in the Makati area. The National Shrine of the Sacred Heart is located in San Antonio Village. Makati also houses the country&#x27;s only Jewish synagogue, Beth Yaacov.

There is a red-light district around Padre Burgos Street in Barangay Poblacion.

==Future development==
Ayala Land and the Makati Tourism Foundation launched a year-long campaign titled &quot;Make It Happen, Make it Makati&quot; to increase Makati&#x27;s visibility as an arts and culture destination. The campaign is part of Ayala&#x27;s ongoing redevelopment masterplan for Makati, which began in 2011 and divides the city into six distinct hubs for business, lifestyle, entertainment and transport.

==Transportation==
Major roads in Metro Manila surround Makati, such as Epifanio de los Santos Avenue (EDSA), located in the southwestern part of the city, the Osmeña Highway and South Luzon Expressway (SLEX), collectively known as South Superhighway (SSH), and the Skyway, which is built on top of both roads.

===Land===

Two of Metro Manila&#x27;s main arteries pass through Makati. The Epifanio de los Santos Avenue (EDSA) pass along the city&#x27;s southeast part and connects it with the cities of Mandaluyong and Pasay. The South Luzon Expressway (SLEX) starts in southwestern Makati and connects it with southern Metro Manila and Southern Luzon. The Skyway is an elevated expressway that connects with NLEX and SLEX, providing residents coming from Northern Luzon, Northern Metro Manila, Southern Luzon and other cities of Southern Metro Manila a fast way to reach Makati. SLEX and EDSA intersect at the Magallanes Interchange, which is the most complex system of elevated roadways in Metro Manila.

The areas of Guadalupe and of Ayala Center are considered as major transport hubs. Ayala Center hosts One Ayala, a complex with an intermodal transport hub, and various public transportation stops. The BGC Bus also connects the city to Bonifacio Global City, with a terminal at the McKinley Exchange Corporate Center near Ayala Center. Provincial and city buses, including Premium Point-to-Point Bus Service, ply the city through EDSA, Osmeña Highway, Kalayaan Avenue, or the central business/financial district towards other parts of Metro Manila and Southern Luzon. Jeepneys ply Makati&#x27;s inner roads and connect the city to its surrounding towns and cities. Tricycles are also used for shorter distances except at most of the Central Business District, exclusive villages, and some major roads.

The country&#x27;s first-ever e-jeepney and hybrid bus services were piloted in Makati. The buses are parallel electric hybrids, powered by an electric motor and a Euro 3 diesel motor. The hybrid buses ply the route from Gil Puyat Avenue (Tramo area) to Kalayaan Avenue (near C-5), which are considered among the busiest in the city&#x27;s central business district, cutting through other major roads like Osmeña Highway; Chino Roces, Ayala and Makati Avenues; Paseo de Roxas and EDSA.

Other major roads in the city include Gil Puyat Avenue, which connects EDSA and SLEX in the north; Ayala Avenue, an important street that runs through the Makati CBD; McKinley Road, which connects the city to Bonifacio Global City; Arnaiz Avenue, which connects the city to Pasay; Osmeña Highway, which connects SLEX to the city of Manila; Makati Avenue, which connects the Makati CBD to Poblacion, also extending north to the Makati–Mandaluyong Bridge; and J. P. Rizal Avenue, the oldest main thoroughfare of Makati which connects it to the cities of Manila and Taguig. At the center of Makati is the Ayala Triangle, a park built on the former Nielson Air Base. According to the city&#x27;s Department of Engineering and Public Works, the city had of concrete roads and of asphalt roads prior to the transfer of Embo barangays to Taguig.

===Railways===

Manila Metro Rail Transit System Line 3 (MRT Line 3) on EDSA has four stations located in Makati: Guadalupe, Buendia, Ayala and Magallanes.

The Philippine National Railways has three stations in the city: Dela Rosa, Pasay Road and EDSA. Pasay Road, formerly known as Culi-culi and Pio del Pilar, is the first railway station in Makati, having been initially opened in 1908. Dela Rosa replaced the old Buendia station in 2017. All aforementioned stations are part of the PNR South Main Line. The operations of PNR Metro Commuter Line, which serves the South Main Line, is currently suspended due to the construction of North–South Commuter Railway, which will have stations at Buendia and EDSA.

In 2013, the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) worked on a feasibility study for a $1.75 billion monorail project. The proposed elevated monorail is envisioned to connect Makati, Bonifacio Global City and Pasay through MRT Line 3, as well as Ninoy Aquino International Airport. The present alignment being considered starts from the Guadalupe MRT station, enters Bonifacio Global City through the north gate and ends at Ninoy Aquino International Airport Terminal 3.

In 2015, NEDA approved the Public-Private Partnership project for the Makati-Pasay-Taguig Mass Transit System Loop which will have stations at key points in Makati, namely: Buendia MRT station, Ayala-EDSA, Ayala Triangle, Makati Post Office and PNR-Buendia. The project was later shelved and partially revived in 2018 as the Makati Intra-City Subway which inherits most of the stations in Makati. The Intra-City Subway project was later stalled in 2023 due to the transfer of the Embo barangays to Taguig, which won the territorial dispute with Makati.

===Water===
The Pasig River is located north of Makati. The Pasig River Ferry Service has one station in Makati located in Valenzuela.

==Government==
===Local government===

Makati is classified as a highly urbanized city (HUC). The city government is based at the Makati City Hall complex in Poblacion, with the new Makati City Hall building serving as its main seat. The mayor is the chief executive and is a member of the Metro Manila Council. The mayor is assisted by the vice mayor, who presides over a legislative council consisting of 18 members: 8 councilors from the 1st district, 8 councilors from the 2nd district, the President of the Sangguniang Kabataan (Youth Council) Federation representing the youth sector, and the President of the Association of Barangay Chairmen (ABC) as barangay sectoral representative.

Current district representatives of the city to the House of Representatives are Romulo &quot;Kid&quot; Peña Jr., representing the 1st district, and Luis Jose Angel Campos Jr., husband of Abby Binay, for the 2nd district.

===Mayors===
===Seal of Makati===

The current seal of Makati, adopted in August 1995, composes of the old outline map of Makati containing 33 rays, green buildings, a church, and a river. Those were first used on Makati&#x27;s final municipal seal from 1990 to 1995.

The map of Makati is in golden yellow color which represents wealth and prosperity. The rays represent the 33 barangays of Makati (including the 10 Embo barangays ceded to Taguig in 2023) which are described to be &quot;surging forward to a brighter future&quot;. The color of the buildings symbolizes life which is described to reflect a &quot;new progressive&quot; Makati. The church represents the oldest church of Makati, the Nuestra Señora de Gracia, which was used by Filipino revolutionaries against the Spaniards in 1896 and the Americans in 1898. The waves represent the tide which came from the phrase &quot;Makati na, Kumakati na&quot; which means ebbing tide in Tagalog.

<doc id="210280" wikidata="Q560188" url="?curid=210280" title="Exposure value">
<text>In photography, exposure value (EV) is a number that represents a combination of a camera&#x27;s shutter speed and f-number, such that all combinations that yield the same exposure have the same EV (for any fixed scene luminance). Exposure value is also used to indicate an interval on the photographic exposure scale, with a difference of 1 EV corresponding to a standard power-of-2 exposure step, commonly referred to as a stop.

The EV concept was developed by the German shutter manufacturer Friedrich Deckel in the 1950s (Gebele 1958; Ray 2000, 318). Its intent was to simplify choosing among equivalent camera exposure settings by replacing combinations of shutter speed and f-number (e.g., 1/125 s at ) with a single number (e.g., 15).

On some lenses with leaf shutters, the process was further simplified by allowing the shutter and aperture controls to be linked such that, when one was changed, the other was automatically adjusted to maintain the same exposure. This was especially helpful to beginners with limited understanding of the effects of shutter speed and aperture and the relationship between them. But it was also useful for experienced photographers who might choose a shutter speed to stop motion or an f-number for depth of field, because it allowed for faster adjustment—without the need for mental calculations—and reduced the chance of error when making the adjustment.

The concept became known as the Light Value System (LVS) in Europe; it was generally known as the Exposure Value System (EVS) when the features became available on cameras in the United States (Desfor 1957).

Because of mechanical considerations, the coupling of shutter and aperture was limited to lenses with leaf shutters; however, various automatic exposure modes now work to somewhat the same effect in cameras with focal-plane shutters.

The proper EV was determined by the scene luminance and film speed; it was intended that the system also include adjustment for filters, exposure compensation, and other variables. With all of these elements included, the camera would be set by transferring the single number thus determined.

Exposure value has been indicated in various ways. The ASA and ANSI standards used the quantity symbol &quot;E&quot;v, with the subscript &quot;v&quot; indicating the logarithmic value; this symbol continues to be used in ISO standards, but the acronym EV is more common elsewhere. The Exif standard uses Ev (CIPA 2016).

Although all camera settings with the same EV nominally give the same exposure, they do not necessarily give the same picture. The f-number (relative aperture) determines the depth of field, and the shutter speed (exposure time) determines the amount of motion blur, as illustrated by the two images at the right (and at long exposure times, as a second-order effect, the light-sensitive medium may exhibit reciprocity failure, which is a change of light sensitivity dependent on the irradiance at the film).

==Formal definition==

Exposure value is a base-2 logarithmic scale defined by (Ray 2000, 318):

formula_1

where

* is the f-number; and
* is the exposure time (&quot;shutter speed&quot;) in seconds

The second line is just applying the quotient identity of logarithms to the first line.

EV 0 corresponds to an exposure time of 1 s and an aperture of .
If the EV is known, it can be used to select combinations of exposure time and f-number, as shown in Table 1.
Each increment of 1 in exposure value corresponds to a change of one &quot;step&quot; (or, more commonly, one &quot;stop&quot;) in exposure, i.e., half as much exposure, either by halving the exposure time or halving the aperture area, or a combination of such changes. Greater exposure values are appropriate for photography in more brightly lit situations, or for lower ISO speeds.

==Camera settings vs. luminous exposure==

&quot;Exposure value&quot; indicates combinations of camera settings rather than the luminous exposure (aka photometric exposure), which is given by (Ray 2000, 310)

:formula_2

where

* &quot;H&quot; is the luminous/photometric exposure (lux seconds)
* &quot;E&quot; is the image-plane illuminance (lux or lumens/m²)
* &quot;t&quot; is the exposure time (&quot;shutter speed&quot;) (seconds)

The illuminance &quot;E&quot; is controlled by the f-number but also depends on the scene luminance. To avoid confusion, some authors (Ray 2000, 310) have used camera exposure to refer to combinations of camera settings. The 1964 ASA standard for automatic exposure controls for cameras, ASA PH2.15-1964, took the same approach, and also used the more descriptive term camera exposure settings.

Common practice among photographers is nonetheless to use &quot;exposure&quot; to refer to camera settings as well as to photometric exposure.

=== Relationship of camera settings to luminous exposure ===

The image-plane illuminance is directly proportional to the area of the aperture, and hence inversely proportional to the square of the lens f-number; thus

:formula_3

for constant lighting conditions, the exposure is constant as long as the ratio &quot;t&quot;/&quot;N&quot;2 is constant. If, for example, the f-number is changed, an equivalent exposure time can be determined from

:formula_4

Performing this calculation mentally is tedious for most photographers, but the equation is easily solved with a calculator dial on an exposure meter (Ray 2000, 318) or a similar dial on a standalone calculator. If the camera controls have detents, constant exposure can be maintained by counting the steps as one control is adjusted and counting an equivalent number of steps when adjusting the other control.

=== Representing camera settings: EV ===
The ratio &quot;t&quot;/&quot;N&quot;2 could be used to represent equivalent combinations of exposure time and f-number in a single value. But for many such combinations used in general photography, the ratio gives a fractional value with a large denominator; this is notationally inconvenient as well as difficult to remember. Inverting this ratio and taking the base-2 logarithm allows defining a quantity &quot;E&quot;v such that

:formula_5

resulting in a value that progresses in a linear sequence as camera exposure is changed in power-of-2 steps. For example, beginning with 1 s and , decreasing exposure

gives the simple sequence

:0, 1, 2, 3, ..., 14, 15, ...

The last two values shown frequently apply when using ISO 100 speed imaging media in outdoor photography.

This system provides its greatest benefit when using an exposure meter (or table) calibrated in EV with a camera that allows settings to be made in EV, especially with coupled shutter and aperture; the appropriate exposure is easily set on the camera, and choosing among equivalent settings is made by adjusting one control.

Current cameras do not allow direct setting of EV, and cameras with automatic exposure control generally obviate the need for it. EV can nonetheless be helpful when used to transfer recommended exposure settings from an exposure meter (or table of recommended exposures) to an exposure calculator (or table of camera settings).

==EV as an indicator of camera settings==

Used as an indicator of camera settings, EV corresponds to actual combinations of shutter speed and aperture setting. When the actual EV matches that recommended by the light level and the ISO speed, these settings should result in the &quot;correct&quot; exposure.


==Relationship of EV to lighting conditions==

&quot;Correct&quot; exposure is obtained when the f-number and exposure time match those &quot;recommended&quot; for given lighting conditions
and ISO speed; the relationship is given by the exposure equation prescribed by ISO 2720:1974:
:formula_6

where

* &quot;N&quot; is the relative aperture (f-number)
* &quot;t&quot; is the exposure time (&quot;shutter speed&quot;) in seconds
* &quot;L&quot; is the average scene luminance
* &quot;S&quot; is the ISO arithmetic speed
* &quot;K&quot; is the reflected-light meter calibration constant

Applied to the right-hand side of the exposure equation, exposure value is

:formula_7

If the common value of is used, an EV of zero (e.g., an aperture of and a shutter time of 1 sec) for corresponds to a luminance of (). At EV = 15 (the &quot;sunny sixteen&quot; amount of light) the luminance is ().

Camera settings also can be determined from incident-light measurements, for which the exposure equation is

:formula_8

where

* &quot;E&quot; is the illuminance in lux or lumens/m²
* &quot;C&quot; is the incident-light meter calibration constant

In terms of exposure value, the right-hand side becomes

:formula_9

When applied to the left-hand side of the exposure equation, EV denotes actual combinations of camera settings; when applied to the right-hand side, EV denotes combinations of camera settings required to give the nominally &quot;correct&quot; exposure. The formal relationship of EV to luminance or illuminance has limitations. Although it usually works well for typical outdoor scenes in daylight, it is less applicable to scenes with highly atypical luminance distributions, such as city skylines at night. In such situations, the EV that will result in the best picture often is better determined by subjective evaluation of photographs than by formal consideration of luminance or illuminance.

For a given luminance and film speed, a greater EV results in less exposure, and for fixed exposure (i.e., fixed camera settings),
a greater EV corresponds to greater luminance or illuminance.

Illuminance is measured using a flat sensor; if the common value of is used, an EV of zero (e.g., an aperture of and a shutter time of 1 sec) for corresponds to an illuminance of (). At EV = 15 (the &quot;sunny sixteen&quot; amount of light) the illuminance is (). For general photography, incident-light measurements are usually taken with a hemispherical sensor; the readings cannot be meaningfully related to illuminance.

==Tabulated exposure values==

An exposure meter may not always be available, and using a meter to determine exposure for some scenes with unusual lighting distribution may be difficult. However, natural light, as well as many scenes with artificial lighting, is predictable, so that exposure often can be determined with reasonable accuracy from tabulated values.


Exposure values in Table 2 are reasonable general guidelines, but they should be used with caution. For simplicity, they are rounded to the nearest integer, and they omit numerous considerations described in the ANSI exposure guides from which they are derived. Moreover, they take no account of color shifts or reciprocity failure. Proper use of tabulated exposure values is explained in detail in the ANSI exposure guide, ANSI PH2.7-1986.

The exposure values in Table 2 are for ISO 100 speed (&quot;EV100&quot;). For a different ISO speed formula_10, increase the exposure values (decrease the exposures) by the number of exposure steps by which that speed is greater than ISO 100, formally

:formula_11

For example, ISO 400 speed is two steps greater than ISO 100:

:formula_12

To photograph outdoor night sports with an ISO 400–speed imaging medium, search Table 2 for &quot;Night sports&quot; (which has an EV of 9 for ISO 100), and add 2 to get .

For lower ISO speed, decrease the exposure values (increase the exposures) by the number of exposure steps by which the speed is less than ISO 100. For example, ISO 50 speed is one step less than ISO 100:

:formula_13

To photograph a rainbow against a cloudy sky with an ISO 50–speed imaging medium, search Table 2 for &quot;Rainbows-Cloudy sky background&quot; (which has an EV of 14), and subtract 1 to get .

The equation for correcting for ISO speed can also be solved for EV100:

:formula_14

For example, using ISO 400 film and setting the camera for EV 11 allows shooting night sports at a light level of EV100 = 9, in agreement with the example done the other way around above. An online calculator that implemented this calculation was available at dpreview.com.

==Setting EV on a camera==


On most cameras, there is no direct way to transfer an EV to camera settings; however, a few cameras, such as some Voigtländer and Braun models or the Kodak Pony II shown in the photo, allowed direct setting of exposure value.

Some medium-format cameras from Rollei (Rolleiflex, Rolleicord models) and Hasselblad allowed EV to be set on the lenses. The set EV could be locked, coupling shutter and aperture settings, such that adjusting either the shutter speed or aperture made a corresponding adjustment in the other to maintain a constant exposure (Ray 2000, 318). On some lenses the locking was optional, so that the photographer could choose the preferred method of working depending on the situation. Use of EV on some meters and cameras is discussed briefly by Adams (1981, 39). He notes that, in some cases, the EV indication from the meter may need to be adjusted for film speed.

==Exposure compensation in EV==

Many current cameras allow for exposure compensation, and usually state it in terms of EV (Ray 2000, 316). In this context, EV refers to the &quot;difference&quot; between the indicated and set exposures. For example, an exposure compensation of +1 EV (or +1 step) means to increase exposure, by using either a longer exposure time or a smaller f-number.

The sense of exposure compensation is opposite that of the EV scale itself. An &quot;increase&quot; in exposure corresponds to a &quot;decrease&quot; in EV, so an exposure compensation of +1 EV results in a smaller EV; conversely, an exposure compensation of −1 EV results in a greater EV. For example, if a meter reading of a lighter-than-normal subject indicates EV 16, and an exposure compensation of +1 EV is applied to render the subject appropriately, the final camera settings will correspond to EV 15.

==Meter indication in EV==

Some light meters (e.g., Pentax spot meters) indicate directly in EV at ISO 100. Some other meters, especially digital models, can indicate EV for the selected ISO speed. In most cases, this difference is irrelevant; with the Pentax meters, camera settings usually are determined using the exposure calculator, and most digital meters directly display shutter speeds and f-numbers.

Recently, articles on many web sites have used &quot;light value&quot; (LV) to denote EV at ISO 100. However, this term does not derive from a standards body, and has had several conflicting definitions.

==EV and APEX==

The &quot;Additive system of Photographic EXposure&quot; (APEX) proposed in the 1960 ASA standard for monochrome film speed, ASA PH2.5-1960, extended the concept of exposure value to all quantities in the exposure equation by taking base-2 logarithms, reducing application of the equation to simple addition and subtraction. In terms of exposure value, the left-hand side of the exposure equation became

:formula_15

where Av (aperture value) and Tv (time value) were defined as:

:formula_16

and

:formula_17

with

* A the relative aperture (f-number)
* T the exposure time (&quot;shutter speed&quot;) in seconds

Av and Tv represent the numbers of stops from and 1 second, respectively.

Use of APEX required logarithmic markings on aperture and shutter controls, however, and these never were incorporated in consumer cameras. With the inclusion of built-in exposure meters in most cameras shortly after APEX was proposed, the need to use the exposure equation was eliminated, and APEX saw little actual use.

Though it remains of little interest to the end user, APEX has seen a partial resurrection in the Exif standard, which calls for storing exposure data using APEX values. See Use of APEX values in Exif for additional discussion.

==EV as a measure of luminance and illuminance==

For a given ISO speed and meter calibration constant, there is a direct relationship between exposure value and luminance (or illuminance). Strictly, EV is not a measure of luminance or illuminance; rather, an EV corresponds to a luminance (or illuminance) for which a camera with a given ISO speed would use the indicated EV to obtain the nominally correct exposure. Nonetheless, it is common practice among photographic equipment manufacturers to express luminance in EV for ISO 100 speed, as when specifying metering range (Ray 2000, 318) or autofocus sensitivity. And the practice is long established; (Ray 2002, 592) cites Ulffers (1968) as an early example. Properly, the meter calibration constant as well as the ISO speed should be stated, but this seldom is done.

Values for the reflected-light calibration constant K vary slightly among manufacturers; a common choice is 12.5 (Canon, Nikon, and Sekonic). Using , the relationship between EV at ISO 100 and luminance L is then

:formula_18

Values of luminance at various values of EV based on this relationship are shown in Table 3. Using this relationship, a reflected-light exposure meter that indicates in EV can be used to determine luminance.

As with luminance, common practice among photographic equipment manufacturers is to express illuminance in EV for ISO 100 speed when specifying metering range.

The situation with incident-light meters is more complicated than that for reflected-light meters, because the calibration constant C depends on the sensor type. Two sensor types are common: flat (cosine-responding) and hemispherical (cardioid-responding). Illuminance is measured with a flat sensor; a typical value for C is 250 with illuminance in lux. Using , the relationship between EV at ISO 100 and illuminance E is then

:formula_19

Values of illuminance at various values of EV based on this relationship are shown in the table to the right. Using this relationship, an incident-light exposure meter that indicates in EV can be used to determine illuminance.

Although illuminance measurements may indicate appropriate exposure for a flat subject, they are less useful for a typical scene in which many elements are not flat and are at various orientations to the camera. For determining practical photographic exposure, a hemispherical sensor has proven more effective. With a hemispherical sensor, typical values for C are between 320 (Minolta) and 340 (Sekonic) with illuminance in lux. If illuminance is interpreted loosely, measurements with a hemispherical sensor indicate &quot;scene illuminance&quot;.

Exposure meter calibration is discussed in detail in the Light meter article.

<text>A semi-presidential republic, or dual executive republic, is a republic in which a president exists alongside a prime minister and a cabinet, with the latter two being responsible to the legislature of the state. It differs from a parliamentary republic in that it has an executive president independent of the legislature; and from the presidential system in that the cabinet, although named by the president, is responsible to the legislature, which may force the cabinet to resign through a motion of no confidence.

While the Weimar Republic (1919–1933) and Finland (from 1919 to 2000) exemplified early semi-presidential systems, the term &quot;semi-presidential&quot; was first introduced in 1959 in an article by the journalist Hubert Beuve-Méry and popularized by a 1978 work written by the political scientist Maurice Duverger. Both men intended to describe the French Fifth Republic (established in 1958).

Maurice Duverger&#x27;s original definition of semi-presidentialism stated that the president had to be elected, possess significant power, and serve for a fixed term. Modern definitions merely declare that the head of state has to be elected and that a separate prime minister that is dependent on parliamentary confidence has to lead the legislative.

== Subtypes ==
There are two distinct subtypes of semi-presidentialism: premier-presidentialism and president-parliamentarism.

Under the premier-presidential system, the prime minister and cabinet are exclusively accountable to parliament. The president may choose the prime minister and cabinet, but only the parliament may approve them and remove them from office with a &quot;vote of no confidence&quot;. This system is much closer to pure parliamentarism. This subtype is used in: Burkina Faso, Cape Verde, East Timor, France, Lithuania, Madagascar, Mali, Mongolia, Niger, Georgia (2013–2018), Poland (&quot;de facto&quot;, however, according to the Constitution, Poland is a parliamentary republic), Portugal, Romania, São Tomé and Príncipe, Sri Lanka, Turkey (&quot;de facto&quot; between 2014 and 2018, until the constitutional amendment to switch the government to presidential from parliamentary), and Ukraine (since 2014; previously, between 2006 and 2010).

Under the president-parliamentary system, the prime minister and cabinet are dually accountable to the president and the parliament. The president chooses the prime minister and the cabinet but must have the support of a parliamentary majority for his choice. To remove a prime minister, or the whole cabinet, from power, the president can either dismiss them, or the parliament can remove them through a &quot;vote of no confidence&quot;. This form of semi-presidentialism is much closer to pure presidentialism. It is used in: Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique, Russia, and Taiwan. It was also used in Ukraine (first between 1996 and 2005; then from 2010 to 2014), Georgia (from 2004 to 2013), South Korea under the Fourth and Fifth republics, and in Germany during the Weimar Republic.

== Cohabitation ==

In a semi-presidential system, the president and the prime minister may sometimes be from different political parties. This is called &quot;cohabitation&quot;, a term which originated in France after the situation first arose in the 1980s. Cohabitation can create either an effective system of checks and balances, or a period of bitter and tense stonewalling, depending on the attitudes of the two leaders, the ideologies of themselves/their parties, and the demands of their supporters.

== Division of powers ==
The distribution of power between the president and the prime minister can vary greatly between countries.

In France, for example, in the case of cohabitation, the president oversees foreign policy and defence policy (these are generally called &quot;les prérogatives présidentielles&quot;, presidential prerogatives) and the prime minister is in charge of domestic policy and economic policy. In this case, the division of responsibilities between the prime minister and the president is not explicitly stated in the constitution, but has evolved as a political convention based on the constitutional principle that the prime minister is appointed (with the subsequent approval of a parliament majority) and dismissed by the president. On the other hand, whenever the president and the prime minister represent the same political party, which leads the cabinet, they tend to exercise &quot;de facto&quot; control over all fields of policy via the prime minister. However, it is up to the president to decide how much autonomy is left to said prime minister.

In most cases, cohabitation results from a system in which the two executives are not elected at the same time or for the same term. For example, in 1981, France elected both a Socialist president and legislature, which yielded a Socialist premier. But while the president&#x27;s term of office was for seven years, the National Assembly only served for five. When, in the 1986 legislative election, the French people elected a right-of-centre assembly, Socialist president François Mitterrand was forced into cohabitation with right-wing premier Jacques Chirac.

However, in 2000, amendments to the French constitution reduced the length of the French president&#x27;s term to five years. This has significantly lowered the chances of cohabitation occurring, as parliamentary and presidential elections may now be conducted within a shorter span of each other.

== Advantages and disadvantages ==
The incorporation of elements from both presidential and parliamentary republics can bring certain advantageous elements; however, it also creates disadvantages, often related to the confusion produced by mixed authority patterns. It can be argued that a semi-presidential republic is more likely to engage in democratic backsliding and power struggles, especially ones with a president-parliamentary system.

Advantages
* Parliament can remove an unpopular prime minister, therefore maintaining stability throughout the president&#x27;s fixed term.
* In most semi-presidential systems, important segments of bureaucracy are taken away from the president, creating additional checks and balances where the running of the day-to-day government and its issues are separate from the head of state, and as such, its issues tend to be looked at on their own merits, with their ebbs and flows and not necessarily tied to who the head of state is.
* Having a separate head of government who needs to command the confidence of the parliament is seen as being more in tune to the political and economic development of the country. Because the head of government is elected from the parliament, there is little potential for political gridlock to occur, since the parliament has the power to remove the head of government if needed.

Disadvantages
* The system provides cover for the president, as unpopular policies could be blamed on the prime minister, who runs the day-to-day operations of the government.
* It creates a sense of confusion towards accountability, as there is no relatively clear sense of who is responsible for policy successes and failures.
* It creates both confusion and inefficiency in the legislative process, since the capacity of votes of confidence makes the prime minister respond to the parliament.

<text>A birth certificate is a vital record that documents the birth of a person. The term &quot;birth certificate&quot; can refer to either the original document certifying the circumstances of the birth or to a certified copy of or representation of the ensuing registration of that birth. Depending on the jurisdiction, a record of birth might or might not contain verification of the event by a healthcare professional such as a midwife or doctor.

The United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 17, an integral part of the 2030 Agenda, has a target to increase the timely availability of data regarding age, gender, race, ethnicity, and other relevant characteristics which documents like a birth certificate have the capacity to provide.

==History and contemporary times==
The documentation of births is a practice widely held throughout human civilization. The original purpose of vital statistics was for tax purposes and for the determination of available military manpower. In England, births were initially registered with churches, who maintained registers of births. This practice continued into the 19th century. The compulsory registration of births with the United Kingdom government is a practice that originated at least as far back as 1853. The entire United States did not get a standardized system until 1902.

Most countries have statutes and laws that regulate the registration of births. In all countries, it is the responsibility of the mother&#x27;s physician, midwife, hospital administrator, or the parent(s) of the child to see that the birth is properly registered with the appropriate government agency.

The actual record of birth is stored with a government agency. That agency will issue certified copies or representations of the original birth record upon request, which can be used to apply for government benefits, such as passports. The certification is signed and/or sealed by the registrar or other custodian of birth records, who is commissioned by the government.

The right of every child to a name and nationality, and the responsibility of national governments to achieve this are contained in Articles 7 and 8 in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child: &quot;The child shall be registered immediately after birth and shall have the right from birth to a name, the right to acquire a nationality...&quot; (CRC Article 7) and &quot;States Parties undertake to respect the right of the child to preserve his or her identity, including nationality, name and family relations...&quot; (CRC Article 8).

Despite 191 countries ratifying the convention, the births of millions of children worldwide go unregistered. By their very nature, data concerning unregistered children are approximate. About 29% of countries do not have available or sufficient data to assess global progress toward the SDG goal of universal coverage. However, from the data that is available, UNICEF estimates that more than a quarter of children under 5 worldwide are unregistered. The lowest levels of birth registration are found in sub-Saharan Africa (43 percent). This phenomenon disproportionately impacts poor households and indigenous populations. Even in many developed countries, it contributes to difficulties in fully accessing civic rights.

Birth registration opens the door to rights to children and adults which many other human beings take for granted: to prove their age; to prove their nationality; to receive healthcare; to go to school; to take exams; to be adopted; to protection from underage military service or conscription; to marry; to open a bank account; to hold a driving licence; to obtain a passport; to inherit money or property; and to vote or stand for elected office.

There are many reasons why births go unregistered, including social and cultural beliefs and attitudes; alternative documents and naming ceremonies; remote areas, poor infrastructure; economic barriers; lack of office staff, equipment and training; legal and political restrictions; fear of discrimination and persecution; war, conflict and unrest or simply the fact that there is no system in place.

Retrospective registration may be necessary where there is a backlog of children whose births have gone unregistered. In Senegal, the government is facilitating retrospective registration through free local court hearings and the number of unregistered children has fallen considerably as a result.
In Sierra Leone, the government gave the National Office of Births and Deaths special permission to issue birth certificates to children over seven. In Bolivia, there was a successful three-year amnesty for the free registration of young people aged between 12 and 18.

Statelessness, or the lack of effective nationality, impacts the daily lives of some 1112 million people around the world. Perhaps those who suffer most are stateless infants, children, and adolescents. Although born and raised in their parents&#x27; country of habitual residence, they lack formal recognition of their existence.

==Algeria==

The establishment of the first birth certificates in Algeria dates from the 1830s, during the French colonial era. Full copies are issued only by the commune of birth. However, birth certificates can be issued by any municipality or consulate on presentation of a family record book and are valid for 10 years.

In 2020, the government launched an online service for requesting civil status documents.

The secure birth certificate, known as 12S (in ), is an extract of birth certificate issued once in a lifetime on a special and secured paper, this document is mandatory for the issuance of the biometric ID and passport.

==Australia==

States and territories of Australia are responsible for the issuance of birth certificates, through agencies generally titled &quot;Registry of Births Deaths and Marriages&quot; or similar.

Initially registering a birth is done by a hospital through a &quot;Birth Registration Statement&quot; or similar, signed by appropriately licensed and authorized health professionals, and provided to the state or territory registry. Home births are permitted, but a statement is required from a registered midwife, doctor or 2 other witnesses other than the parent(s). Unplanned births require in some states that the baby be taken to a hospital within 24 hours. Once registered, a separate application (sometimes it can be done along with the Birth Registration Statement) can be made for a birth certificate, generally at a cost. The person(s) named or the parent(s) can apply for a certificate at any time. Generally, there is no restriction on re-applying for a certificate at a later date, so it could be possible to legally hold multiple original copies.

The Federal government requires that births be also registered through a &quot;Proof of Birth Declaration&quot; similarly signed as above by a doctor or midwife. This ensures the appropriate benefits can be paid, and the child is enrolled for Medicare.

The state or territory issued birth certificate is a secure A4 paper document, generally listing: Full name at birth, sex at birth, parent(s) and occupation(s), older sibling(s), address(es), date and place of birth, name of the registrar, date of registration, date of issue of certificate, a registration number, with the signature of the registrar and seal of the registry printed and/or embossed. Most states allow for stillbirths to be issued a birth certificate. Some states issue early pregnancy loss certificates (without legal significance if before 20 weeks). Depending on the state or territory, amendments on the certificate are allowed to correct an entry, add ascendant, recognize same-sex relationship, changing the sex of the holder is possible in all states and territories.

The full birth certificate in Australia is an officially recognized identity document generally in the highest category. The birth certificate assists in establishing citizenship. Shorter and/or commemorative birth certificates are available; however, they are not generally acceptable for identification purposes.

Birth certificates in Australia can be verified online by approved agencies through the Attorney-General&#x27;s Department Document Verification Service and can be used to validate identity digitally, e.g. online.

== Canada ==

In Canada, the issuance of birth certificates is a function of the provinces and territories. In 2008, provinces and territories started rolling out new polymer certificates to new applicants.

Canadian birth certificates may be obtained from the following:

* Alberta – A registry agent authorised by the Province
* British Columbia – British Columbia Vital Statistics Agency
* Manitoba – Manitoba Vital Statistics Agency
* New Brunswick – Service New Brunswick
* Newfoundland and Labrador – Service NL
* Northwest Territories – Health Services Administration Office
* Nova Scotia – Access Nova Scotia
* Nunavut – Registrar-General of Vital Statistics
* Ontario – ServiceOntario
* Prince Edward Island – Vital Statistics Registry
* Quebec – Director of Civil Status &quot;(Directeur de l&#x27;état civil)&quot;
* Saskatchewan – eHealth Saskatchewan
* Yukon – Vital Statistics, Government of Yukon

===Types issued===

There are three forms of birth certificates issued:

* Certified true copy/photostat – contains all information available on the birth of a person.
* Long-form – contains name, place and date of birth, parental information, date of issue, date of registration, registration number, certificate number, and authorised signature(s).
* Short-form – as with long-form, except for parental information. Previously in card format.

Residents of Quebec born elsewhere can have their non-Quebec birth record inserted into Quebec&#x27;s birth register. Quebec birth certificates issued with regard to a birth that occurred outside of Quebec are referred to as &quot;semi-authentic&quot; under paragraph 137 of the Civil Code of Québec, until their full authenticity is recognised by a Quebec court. Inserting one&#x27;s birth record into the Quebec register is a prerequisite for anyone born outside of Quebec to apply for a legal name and/or legal gender change in the province. Semi-authentic birth certificates are issued in the long-form only.

=== Languages ===

Depending on the province, certificates are in English, French or both languages. Birth certificates from Canadian territories are in English and French, as well as Inuktitut in Nunavut (though individual data is in the Roman alphabet only, not in Inuktitut syllabics). The Northwest Territories previously issued certificates bearing Inuktitut.

=== DND 419 birth certificates ===
In 1963, the Department of National Defence started issuing birth certificates to dependents of Canadian Forces members born overseas. These certificates were never accorded legal status, but served as a convenient substitute for the original record of birth from the country of birth. In November 1979, production of these certificates ceased.

Today, the DND 419 is recognised as a proof of age, but not of citizenship. At least two Canadians have had Canadian passports withheld on the basis of their DND 419 birth certificates.

==China==

Due to the one-child policy, there are an estimated 8 million people whose birth went unregistered, mostly women, called &quot;Heihaizi&quot;. They are not allowed to go to school or otherwise participate in the public sphere. The People&#x27;s Republic of China issued its first medical birth certificate on 1 January 1996. Persons born prior to that date can obtain a birth certificate from a Chinese notary public by way of presenting their hukou and other supporting documents. The notary then proceeds to issue a notarial birth certificate based on the information contained in the said documentation. This notarial birth certificate is acceptable for immigration purposes.

The fifth-generation medical birth certificate was adopted nationwide on 1 January 2014. Still, China is amongst those countries with no globally comparable data, presenting challenges to researchers who wish to assess global and regional progress towards universal birth registration.

== Cuba ==
In Cuba, birth certificates are issued by the local civil registries.

With the passage of &quot;Extraordinary Official Gazette Number 9 of 2020,&quot; issued by the Cuban Ministry of Justice, birth certificates (as with all other vital records, excepting certificates of single status) will no longer expire after a certain amount of time.

Children born to Cuban citizens abroad may have the details of their birth transcribed in a Cuban civil registry through a Cuban overseas mission. This is known as a &quot;Birth Certificate Transcript.&quot; Because of the considerable difficulty of obtaining Cuban vital records for individuals residing outside of Cuba – even where Cuban overseas missions have been delegated to provide these services – private services such as the Massachusetts-based &quot;Cuba City Hall&quot; offer retrieval services, wherein they apply for a certificate from a Cuban civil registry on behalf of an overseas individual. These services have been called overpriced.

==Czech Republic==
The Czech Republic maintains a registry of vital records, including births, of people, regardless of nationality, or birthplace. Every citizen of the Czech Republic will need to register their birth if born abroad, effectively granting a foreign born person two birth certificates. The Czech Republic will also register foreigners in some cases. The office that registers births is colloquially called &#x27;matrika&#x27;.

== Denmark ==
In Denmark, the authority responsible for registering births is the Registrar of the Church of Denmark.

There are three types of Danish birth certificates:

* Personattest (Certificate of Personal Data): issued to persons born in (or baptised in) Denmark.
* Foedsels- og Daabsattest (Birth and Baptism Certificate): issued to persons born in Denmark and baptised in the Church of Denmark.
* Foedsels- og Navneattest (Birth and Naming Certificate): issued to persons born in Denmark but not baptised in the Church of Denmark.

== France ==
Civil records in France have been compulsory since the 1539 ordinance of Villers-Cotterêts, in which the King Francis I ordered the parishes to record baptisms, marriages and sepultures. Then in 1667 the parishes were asked to issue two registers in two different places in order to avoid the loss of data. Jews and Protestants were allowed to have their own records by Louis XVI in 1787. In 1792, the registers were fully secularized (birth, civil marriage and death replaced baptism, religious marriage and sepulture, plus an official kept the records instead of a priest), and the Code civil did create the compulsory birth certificate in 1804 (in its articles 34, 38, 39 et 57). This document should be completed at one&#x27;s marriage since 1897, at one&#x27;s divorce since 1939, at one&#x27;s death since 1945 and at one&#x27;s civil union since 2006. A note is added on the certificate for all these events.

== Hong Kong ==
In Hong Kong, the system is similar to England and Wales, wherein the government keeps a birth register book, and the birth certificate is actually a certified copy of the birth register book entry.

Currently, the Immigration Department is the official birth registrar. All parents need to register their children&#x27;s birth within 42 days. Birth certificates issued between 1 July 1997 and 27 April 2008 recorded whether or not the child&#x27;s Hong Kong permanent resident status was established at birth. Birth certificates issued after the latter date record which provision of the Immigration Ordinance the said status has been established under.

== India ==
Traditionally births were poorly recorded in India.

For official purposes, other proofs are accepted in India in lieu of the birth certificate, such as matriculation certificates. Facilities are available to produce a birth certificate from a passport.

By law since 1969, registration of births is compulsory as per provisions of Registration of Births &amp; Deaths Act. Birth certificates are issued by the Government of India or the municipality concerned. Specific rules vary by state, region and municipality.

In Delhi, for example, births must be registered within 21 days by the hospital or institution, or by a family member if the birth has taken place at home. After registration, a birth certificate can be obtained by applying to the relevant authority. Certificates can also be issued under special provisions to adopted children, and undocumented orphans. Overseas births can also be registered.

Some municipalities, such as the Greater Chennai Corporation, allow for fully digital birth certificates to be applied for, printed, and verified online.

== Indonesia ==
The current legislation governing the registration of births is the 2006 Act No 23 on the Administration of Civil Status (&quot;UU No. 23 Tahun 2006 tentang Administrasi Kependudukan),&quot; as amended by 2013 Act No 24 on Amendments to 2006 Act No 23.

=== Births outside Indonesia ===
Pursuant to Chapter 29 of the Act, Indonesian citizens born overseas must register their births with the local civil registrar using a foreign birth certificate upon returning to Indonesia, and receive a Report of Birth Abroad &quot;(Tanda Bukti Laporan Kelahiran)&quot;. If born in a jurisdiction which does not register the births of non-citizens, they will instead be issued a regular Birth Certificate by the local Indonesian overseas mission.

=== Births within Indonesia ===

Within Indonesia, local civil registrars are responsible for issuing birth certificates (&quot;akta kelahiran).&quot;

The following &quot;Staatsbladen&quot; (state gazettes), enacted by the Dutch colonial government, were supplanted by the Act:

* 1849 Staatsblad 25 for persons of European descent
* 1917 Staatsblad 130 for persons of Chinese descent
* 1920 Staatsblad 751 for persons of Indigenous descent
* 1923 Staatsblad 75 for persons of Indigenous descent professing the Christian faith

Prior to 1986, persons not born in any of the above groups had to be registered through court order. This changed by a 1986 decree of the Minister of Home Affairs, resulting in a jolt in the number of births being registered. In 1989, a subsequent decree was effected by the Minister, allowing those born between 1986 and 1989 to have their births registered.

There are several types of birth certificates issued to Indonesian-born individuals, per the Denpasar Civil Registry:

* General Birth Certificate (&quot;Akta Kelahiran Umum)&quot;
* Delayed Birth Certificate (&quot;Akta Kelahiran Terlambat)&quot;
* Birth Certificate for a Child Born to a Single Mother (&quot;Akta Kelahiran Anak Seorang Ibu)&quot;

Pursuant to the Act&#x27;s domicile principle, a birth certificate is issued by the Civil Registry of the parents&#x27; home regency or city, as determined from their Indonesian identity card. This is not always the same place as the actual regency or city of birth of the child.

There is no such thing as a certified copy of the original birth registration form; all Indonesian birth certificates are abstracts in nature and list an individual&#x27;s nationality, name, place and date of birth, birth order, parents&#x27; names and marital status only. Indonesian birth certificates are typically laminated like Malaysian and Singaporean ones; however, unlike Malaysia and Singapore, it is not done at the time of issuance by the civil registry. The Indonesian government recommends against lamination, as it may render the certificate unacceptable for use overseas (laminated certificates cannot be legalised).

In 2019, Indonesian local civil registrars began to issue birth certificates with QR codes in lieu of the traditional authenticating signature and stamp. Widodo, director of civil registry services for the Bengkulu Civil Registry, is quoted as saying that &quot;this is by decree of the Minister of Home Affairs, and will help simplify things for the general public as they will no longer be required to go through the hassle of getting [birth certificates] legalised.&quot; In July 2020, Indonesia phased out birth certificates printed on security paper, and started allowing Indonesian-born people to print out their own birth certificates on regular A4 paper; these certificates have the same legal value as birth certificates printed on security paper. The move reportedly helped the central government save 450 billion rupiahs in the 2020 fiscal year.

== Iran ==
A &quot;shenasnameh&quot; (شناسنامه), or birth certificate is issued by the National Organization for Civil Registration. It includes the name and surname of the infant, place and date of birth, gender, information relating to the parents including their names and residences, and the &quot;registration documentation (witness or physician&#x27;s certificate). A newer format was introduced in 2015. Those eligible to replication include newborn babies, people who are changing their names, those who have lost their original birth certificates, and those born before 2001 who have reached the age of 15 and need to change their cards to add the photograph. Those applying for a new certificate must show their old certificate.

== Japan ==
In Japan, the household registration document (jp: 戸籍, &quot;koseki&quot;) is generally used in lieu of a birth certificate.

Since a koseki also acts as proof of Japanese citizenship, only Japanese citizens can hold one. Anyone born in Japan, including children born to non-Japanese parents, can obtain a Certificate of Matters Stated In a Written Notification (jp: 出生届記載事項証明書, &quot;shusshō todoke kisai jikō shōmeisho&quot;). A Certificate of Matters Stated In a Written Notification may be obtained from the city/ward/town office the birth was reported to, and is the equivalent of a birth certificate. This is to be distinguished from a Certificate of Acceptance of Birth Notification (jp: 出生届受理証明書, &quot;shusshō todoke juri shōmeisho),&quot; which, according to the Australian Embassy at Tokyo, only constitutes a receipt proving that a birth registration has been lodged with a city/ward/town office.

Birth records for children born to non-Japanese parents in Japan are not maintained permanently; usually only for the duration of ten years from the date of lodgement, but this varies from one city/ward/town office to another.

== Malaysia ==
In Malaysia, the National Registration Department (&quot;Jabatan Pendaftaran Negara&quot;) is responsible for the registration of births, and for issuing birth certificates (&quot;sijil kelahiran).&quot;

In 2011, the department started colour-coding birth certificates. Henceforth, citizens at birth would receive a pale-green birth certificate, while those who do not acquire Malaysian citizenship at birth would be given a red birth certificate. Then-director Datin Jariah Mohd Said was reported as saying that &quot;it [would] address the wrong impression among foreign parents that their children automatically become Malaysians by virtue of them having the pale green certificate.&quot;

Malaysian birth certificates are laminated at the time of issuance, forming an exception to most countries&#x27; need for an unlaminated document (e.g. the United Kingdom when applying for a passport).

==Morocco==

In Morocco, there are 3 birth documents: the &quot;Extrait d&#x27;acte de naissance&quot; (proof of Moroccan citizenship), a &quot;Fiche individuelle de naissance&quot; and an &quot;Acte de naissance&quot;. All of them are valid for 3 months. In 2017, the government opened requests for birth certificates online.

==New Zealand==
The Department of Internal Affairs is responsible for issuing birth certificates in New Zealand. Certain historical records including historical birth certificates are available online in a searchable format on the Birth, Death and Marriage Historical Records website. The available records are for births recorded at least one hundred years ago.
Citizenship information is recorded on New Zealand birth certificates for births after 1 January 2006, as this was when the country formally ended its practice of jus soli.

==Nigeria==
The birth certificate in Nigeria is a document that entails the date of birth, location (Town, L.G.A and state) and details of the parents. It is issued by the National Population Commission for every child and is usually issued at the hospital where the child is born and it is compulsory for everyone.
The National Population Commission (NPC) formed in 1992, is the only body responsible for registering births, and issuing certificates in the country.

For those who were not issued a certificate at birth, it is possible to apply for one up until their 18th birthday. However, only people aged 18 and below are issued a birth certificate. 
People above age 18 are issued an &#x27;Age Declaration Affidavit&#x27;. Although now in Nigeria, you will have to provide an attestation letter issued by the NPC as the &#x27;Age Declaration Affidavit&#x27; is no longer a sufficient document.

An attestation letter is a written document given as backup for the &#x27;Age Declaration Affidavit&#x27;.

However, in terms of legal value and effect, the attestation of a birth certificate is equal to a birth certificate. 
The NPC Act states that only people born after 1992 are eligible to apply for birth certificate since that was when the NPC was formed. Also only birth certificate issued at birth or 60 days after birth is free any scenario after birth would require you to pay.

==Philippines==
A birth certificate in the Philippines is a document issued by the Philippine Statistics Authority and has lifetime validity. In almost all cases, this document is required by other government agencies as a primary requirement for getting service or benefits.

==Poland==

Birth records are created and kept by the registry office [Urząd stanu cywilnego (USC)] where the birth took place, records are regulated by &quot;Prawo o aktach stanu cywilnego (ustawa 2014)&quot;.

From 2015 to 2024, birth records were computerized in SRP (System Rejestrów Państwowych).

=== Types of certified copies ===

* Complete (long) format certificates are copies of the original entry in the birth register, giving all the recorded details. Information includes: first name, second name, additional names, surname, sex, date, place, and country of birth of the child, parents&#x27;: names, surnames and family name, date and place of birth.
* Short format certificates show the child&#x27;s full first name, second name, additional names, surname, sex, date, place, and country of birth, parents&#x27;: names, and family name.
* Multilingual short format certificates, according to ICCS Convention (No.16) on the issue of multilingual extracts from civil-status records. Information includes: country, date and place of birth, name, forename, sex, parents&#x27;: names and forenames.
==Russia==
Russian birth certificates were previously issued in a booklet format, similar to that of internal passports; today, they are issued on numbered and watermarked A4 security paper. They are typically issued in the Russian language only; however, if a birth is recorded in one of the Russian republics with federal subject status, the resulting birth certificate may be bilingual (Russian and the official language of the said republic).

===Filling a birth certificate===
A Russian birth certificate may either be filled out in type or print. It is then signed and sealed by a qualified officer of the public authority issuing the certificate (a local civil registry or Russian overseas mission). By default, information on the parents&#x27; ethnic origins is no longer recorded – however, it may be recorded upon request.

===Obtaining a birth certificate===
A Russian birth certificate may be applied for by the person named on the certificate if they are of full age, their parents if still vested with parental rights, their guardian(s) and/or caregiver(s). If the certificate is lost, the public authority that issued the original document issues a replacement on application.

== Singapore ==
In Singapore, the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority is the registrar of births. All births in the country must be registered at a gazetted birth registration centre by the parents or by authorised proxy. A &quot;Certificate of Registration of Birth&quot; is received after the registration of birth; a &quot;Certificate of Extract from Register of Births&quot; is issued for all subsequent requests for birth certificates.

The ICA annotates birth certificates with citizenship information; a child born without a claim to Singapore citizenship will have a remark on their birth certificate stating &quot;&quot;this child is not a citizen of Singapore at the time of birth&quot;. Conversely, a child born with a claim to Singapore citizenship will have &quot;this child is a citizen of Singapore at the time of birth&quot;&quot; on theirs.

Singaporean birth certificates are laminated at the time of issuance, forming an exception to most foreign countries&#x27; need for an unlaminated document (e.g. the United Kingdom when applying for a passport). This practice began on 1 January 1967.
== Somalia ==
In Somalia, many births go unregistered – owing to the large nomadic population in the country.

Prior to 1991, the Siad Barre government issued birth certificates (Somali: &quot;shahaadada dhalashada&quot; or &quot;warqadda dhalashada&quot;) for events occurring in urban areas. Subsequent to the collapse of said government, Somalia ceased to have a functioning birth registration system. As of January 2014, it has been reported by the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs that Somalia has once again started issuing birth certificates, primarily for Somali citizens to be able to obtain the new Somali passport. In Mogadishu, this function is fulfilled by the Mayor of Mogadishu.

Somali autonomous regions, such as Jubaland, Puntland, and Somaliland, have separate, functioning birth registration systems for those born within their respective jurisdictions. In Somaliland, birth certificates are routinely issued only to babies born at a hospital. Home births are registered by way of affidavit with the Somaliland Ministry of Religious Affairs at Hargeisa.

==Sweden==
Sweden no longer issues birth certificates. Instead, the Swedish Tax Agency will issue a Personbevis (Extract from the Population Register) for individuals born in Sweden. This takes the place of both birth and marriage certificates for international purposes. The Extract contains, &quot;inter alia,&quot; place and date of birth, parental information, marriage status, and current registered address.

==Syria==
In Syria, the father is primarily responsible for registering the birth of a child. Due to the ongoing civil war, many births have gone unregistered.

==South Korea==
Birth certificates are not issued in Korea. When a foreign embassy requests a birth certificate, Koreans submit a basic certificate containing the place of birth, date of birth, etc., and a family relations certificate containing their parents&#x27; resident registration number and name.

==United Kingdom==

=== England and Wales ===
In England and Wales, the description &quot;birth certificate&quot; is used to describe a certified copy of an entry in the birth register.

Civil registration of births, marriages and deaths in England and Wales started on 1 July 1837. Registration was not compulsory until 1875, following the Registration of Births and Deaths Act 1874, which made registration of a birth the responsibility of those present at the birth. When a birth is registered, the details are entered into the register book at the local register office for the district in which the birth took
place and is retained permanently in the local register office. A copy of each entry in the birth register is sent to the General Register Office (GRO).

====Pre-1837 birth and baptism records====
Before the government&#x27;s registration system was created, evidence of births and/or baptisms (and also marriages and death or burials) was dependent on the events being recorded in the records of the Church of England or in those of other various churches – not all of which maintained such records or all types of those records. Copies of such records are not issued by the General Register Office; but can be obtained from these churches, or from the local or national archive, which usually now keeps the records in original or copy form.

==== Types of certified copies issued in England and Wales ====
Long format certificates are copies of the original entry in the birth register, giving all the recorded details. Information includes; name, sex, date, and place of birth of the child, parents&#x27; name, place of birth and occupation. Certificates for births registered before 1 April 1969 do not show the parents&#x27; places of birth, and those before 1984 do not show mother&#x27;s occupation.

Short format certificates show the child&#x27;s full name, sex, date, and place of birth. They do not give any detail(s) of the parent(s); they therefore do not prove parentage. Both versions of a certificate can be used in the verification of identity by acting as a support to other information or documentation
provided. Where proof of parentage is required, only a full certificate will be accepted.

The original registrations are required by law to be issued in the form of certified copies to any person who identifies an index entry and pays the prescribed fee. They can be ordered by registered users from the General Register Office Certificate Ordering Service or by postal or telephone ordering from the General Register Office or by post or in person from local registrars. If the birth was registered within the past 50 years, detailed information is required before a certificate will be issued. The General Register Office draws on several registers for the issuance of birth certificates: the Register of Live Births, the Register of Stillbirths, the Abandoned Children Register, the Adopted Children Register, the Parental Order Register, and the Gender Recognition Register (for holders of Gender Recognition Certificates).

The General Register Office also issues birth certificates relating to births on UK-registered aircraft, vessels, and births of His Majesty&#x27;s Armed Forces dependents. This authority is delegated to the Office by the Registry of Shipping and Seamen, part of the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, for births aboard UK-flagged ships; and by the Civil Aviation Authority for births aboard UK-flagged aircraft.

=== Rest of the British Isles ===
In the rest of the British Isles, there are several different birth registration authorities:

* In Scotland, the National Records of Scotland. 
* In Northern Ireland, the General Register Office Northern Ireland (GRONI). 
* In Guernsey, the Greffe of the Royal Court of Guernsey. 
* In Jersey, the Office of the Superintendent Registrar. 
* In the Isle of Man, the Civil Registry. The registration of births became mandated in 1878 on the Isle.
=== Other cases ===
Consular birth registration is available for those who establish entitlement to British nationality at birth overseas. This is especially helpful when the jurisdiction in question does not allow multiple citizenship or the registration of an illegitimate child&#x27;s birth. Prior to 1983, such registrations were accepted as proof of British nationality alone. Pursuant to a Reform Order by the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, new consular birth registrations issued for children born after 1 January 1983, and certificates for people born before that date re-issued starting 1 January 2014, are no longer accepted as stand-alone proof of British nationality.

In addition, certificates of birth issued under the Registration of Births, Deaths and Marriages (Special Provisions) Act 1957 (registered on HM Forces bases overseas), are also not recognised as proof of nationality status alone. Such births would also have to be registered in the local authority where the birth took place, and the parents would have to apply for a foreign certificate as proof of citizenship.

British Overseas Territories have their own independent regimes for issuance of a birth certificate. Additionally, as a result of Argentina&#x27;s claim over the Falkland Islands, Falklander-born people may also apply for an Argentine birth certificate.
==United States==
In the U.S., the issuance of birth certificates is a function of the vital statistics agency or equivalent of the state, federal district, territory or former territory of birth. Birth in the U.S. typically confers citizenship by birth (non-citizen nationality in American Samoa), so a U.S. birth certificate doubly serves as evidence of United States citizenship or non-citizen nationality. U.S. birth certificates are therefore commonly provided to the federal government to obtain a U.S. passport.

The U.S. State Department issues a Consular Report of Birth Abroad (which does not technically certify birth but often substitutes for a birth certificate) for children born to U.S. citizens or non-citizen nationals (who are also eligible for citizenship or non-citizen nationality), including births on military bases in foreign territory. Children who do not receive the certificate at the time of birth may apply for it anytime until the age of 18. Natural-born citizens of the United States born abroad may receive a USCIS Certificate of Citizenship instead to prove their citizenship status.

The federal and state governments have traditionally cooperated to some extent to improve vital statistics. From 1900 to 1946 the U.S. Census Bureau designed standard birth certificates, collected vital statistics on a national basis, and generally sought to improve the accuracy of vital statistics. In 1946 that responsibility was passed to the U.S. Public Health Service. Unlike the British system of recording all births in &quot;registers&quot;, the states file an individual document for each and every birth.

The U.S. National Center for Health Statistics creates standard forms that are recommended for use by the individual states to document births. However, states are free to create their own forms. As a result, neither the appearance nor the information content of birth certificate forms is uniform across states. These forms are completed by the attendant at birth or a hospital administrator, which are then forwarded to a local or state registrar, who stores the record and issues certified copies upon request.

=== Birth certificates for individuals born in or adopted to the United States ===

According to the Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General, there were more than 6,000 entities issuing birth certificates. The Inspector General report stated that according to the staff at the Immigration and Naturalization Service&#x27;s Forensics Document Laboratory the number of legitimate birth certificate versions in use exceeded 14,000.

====Short-form birth certificates and acceptance thereof====

In the case of applying for a U.S. passport, not all legitimate government-issued birth certificates are acceptable:

The U.S. State Department has paid close attention to abstract certificates from both Texas and California. There have been reports of a high incidence of midwife registration fraud along the border region between Texas and Mexico, and the Texas abstract certificate form does not list the name or occupation of the attendant. The California Abstract of Birth did not include an embossed seal, was no longer considered a secure document, and have not been issued in California since 2001.

====Souvenir birth certificates====
Most hospitals in the U.S. issue a souvenir birth certificate which may include the footprints of the newborn. However, these birth certificates are not legally accepted as proof of age or citizenship, and are frequently rejected by the Bureau of Consular Affairs during passport applications. Many Americans believe the souvenir records to be their official birth certificates when, in reality, they hold little legal value.

==== Birth certificates after adoption ====

When an adoption is finalized in the U.S., most states and the District of Columbia seal the original birth certificate. In its place, a replacement or amended birth certificate is issued, with the adoptee&#x27;s new name and adoptive parents listed &quot;as if&quot; the adoptee was born to the adoptive parents. Adopted persons in ten states have an unrestricted right to obtain a copy of the original birth certificate when they are adults: Alabama, Alaska, Colorado, Connecticut, Kansas, Maine, New Hampshire, New York, Oregon, and Rhode Island. The remaining states and the District of Columbia either require a court order to release a copy of the original birth certificate or have other restrictions, such as permission of biological parent(s) or redaction of information upon request of a biological parent.

For foreign-born intercountry adoptees, U.S. jurisdictions may issue a Certificate of Foreign Birth that serves as documentary evidence of the child&#x27;s birth and the child&#x27;s legal relationship to the adoptive United States parents. These certificates, however, do not serve as evidence of U.S. citizenship and must be supplemented by another document to prove citizenship, such as a Certificate of Citizenship, a United States passport or a Certificate of Naturalization.

=== Consular reports of birth for individuals born overseas ===
Prior to 1990, the Vital Records Section of the Department&#x27;s Passport Services office was responsible for certifying American births overseas, and issued form FS-545, formally known as a Certification of Birth Abroad of a Citizen of the United States of America. In 1990, the department changed its policy to make clear that a report issued by them is only supplementary to, and does not substitute for a locally issued birth certificate; the report, however, does serve as &quot;prima facie&quot; documentary evidence of the acquisition of United States citizenship or non-citizen nationality at birth. The department contends that the issuance of birth certificates is a function that is expressly reserved to local vital statistics authorities and may not be assumed by a consular officer.

Notwithstanding the Department&#x27;s position, however, a consular report of birth is often the only government-issued record of birth for certain individuals. For example, those born on a U.S. Armed Forces base in Germany do not have their births registered with the local German registrar, but only with the Department of State. Because they cannot receive a German birth certificate, their CRBA is their &quot;de facto&quot; birth certificate. Between 1990 and December 2010, the department issued form DS-1350, formally known as a Certification of Report of Birth of a United States Citizen; and form FS-240, formally known as the Consular Report of Birth Abroad of a Citizen of the United States of America. Since January 2011, the Department of State has issued only form FS-240. 

== Ukraine ==
In Ukraine, a child&#x27;s birth must be registered at the Civil Registry Office located either at the place of the child&#x27;s birth or at the place of registration of the parents (mother and/or father). If a child is born in a hospital, a medical certificate serves as proof of the place of birth. In cases where a child is born at home, in transport, or in other settings, alternative evidence may be required. The parents&#x27; place of registration is verified by a stamp in their passports. If the residence and registration locations differ, the local Civil Registry Office may still register the child at the parents&#x27; registered address.

However, due to the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine, many births occurring after the onset of the conflict have gone unregistered.

==Controversy==
In countries such as the United States, the use of the birth certificate to enforce racial segregation, policies of white supremacy, as part of Indigenous erasure, and allotment of Indigenous identity and lands has a history in the Jim Crow era and the 1924 Racial Integrity Act. Problems stemming from the history of adoptions laws, especially the practice of amending the original birth certificate and replacing the information with the adoptive parents &quot;as if&quot; they were the child&#x27;s birth parents and sealing the original, has prompted a number of recent debates. The use of birth certificates to enforce gender identity has also garnered attention regarding transgender rights.

<doc id="210294" wikidata="Q199507" url="?curid=210294" title="Ulna">
<text>The ulna or ulnar bone (: ulnae or ulnas) is a long bone in the forearm stretching from the elbow to the wrist. It is on the same side of the forearm as the little finger, running parallel to the radius, the forearm&#x27;s other long bone. Longer and thinner than the radius, the ulna is considered to be the smaller long bone of the lower arm. The corresponding bone in the lower leg is the fibula.

==Structure==
The ulna is a long bone found in the forearm that stretches from the elbow to the wrist, and when in standard anatomical position, is found on the medial side of the forearm. It is broader close to the elbow, and narrows as it approaches the wrist.

Close to the elbow, the ulna has a bony process, the olecranon process, a hook-like structure that fits into the olecranon fossa of the humerus. This prevents hyperextension and forms a hinge joint with the trochlea of the humerus. There is also a radial notch for the head of the radius, and the ulnar tuberosity to which muscles attach.

Close to the wrist, the ulna has a styloid process.

=== Near the elbow ===
Near the elbow, the ulna has two curved processes, the olecranon and the coronoid process; and two concave, articular cavities, the semilunar and radial notches.

The olecranon is a large, thick, curved eminence, situated at the upper and back part of the ulna. It is bent forward at the summit so as to present a prominent lip which is received into the olecranon fossa of the humerus in extension of the forearm. Its base is contracted where it joins the body and the narrowest part of the upper end of the ulna. Its posterior surface, directed backward, is triangular, smooth, subcutaneous, and covered by a bursa. Its superior surface is of quadrilateral form, marked behind by a rough impression for the insertion of the triceps brachii; and in front, near the margin, by a slight transverse groove for the attachment of part of the posterior ligament of the elbow joint. Its anterior surface is smooth, concave, and forms the upper part of the semilunar notch. Its borders present continuations of the groove on the margin of the superior surface; they serve for the attachment of ligaments: the back part of the ulnar collateral ligament medially, and the posterior ligament laterally. From the medial border a part of the flexor carpi ulnaris arises; while to the lateral border the anconeus is attached.

The coronoid process is a triangular eminence projecting forward from the upper and front part of the ulna. Its base is continuous with the body of the bone, and of considerable strength. Its apex is pointed, slightly curved upward, and in flexion of the forearm is received into the coronoid fossa of the humerus. Its upper surface is smooth, concave, and forms the lower part of the semilunar notch. Its antero-inferior surface is concave, and marked by a rough impression for the insertion of the brachialis. At the junction of this surface with the front of the body is a rough eminence, the tuberosity of the ulna, which gives insertion to a part of the brachialis; to the lateral border of this tuberosity the oblique cord is attached. Its lateral surface presents a narrow, oblong, articular depression, the radial notch. Its medial surface, by its prominent, free margin, serves for the attachment of part of the ulnar collateral ligament. At the front part of this surface is a small rounded eminence for the origin of one head of the flexor digitorum superficialis; behind the eminence is a depression for part of the origin of the flexor digitorum profundus; descending from the eminence is a ridge which gives origin to one head of the pronator teres. Frequently, the flexor pollicis longus arises from the lower part of the coronoid process by a rounded bundle of muscular fibers.

The semilunar notch is a large depression, formed by the olecranon and the coronoid process, and serving as articulation with the trochlea of the humerus. About the middle of either side of this notch is an indentation, which contracts it somewhat, and indicates the junction of the olecranon and the coronoid process. The notch is concave from above downward, and divided into a medial and a lateral portion by a smooth ridge running from the summit of the olecranon to the tip of the coronoid process. The medial portion is the larger, and is slightly concave transversely; the lateral is convex above, slightly concave below.

The radial notch is a narrow, oblong, articular depression on the lateral side of the coronoid process; it receives the circumferential articular surface of the head of the radius. It is concave from before backward, and its prominent extremities serve for the attachment of the annular ligament.

=== Body ===
The body of the ulna at its upper part is prismatic in form, and curved so as to be convex behind and lateralward; its central part is straight; its lower part is rounded, smooth, and bent a little lateralward. It tapers gradually from above downward, and has three borders and three surfaces.

;Borders
* The volar border (&quot;margo volaris; anterior border&quot;) begins above at the prominent medial angle of the coronoid process, and ends below in front of the styloid process. Its upper part, well-defined, and its middle portion, smooth and rounded, give origin to the flexor digitorum profundus; its lower fourth serves for the origin of the pronator quadratus. This border separates the volar from the medial surface.
* The dorsal border (&quot;margo dorsalis; posterior border&quot;) begins above at the apex of the triangular subcutaneous surface at the back part of the olecranon, and ends below at the back of the styloid process; it is well-marked in the upper three-fourths, and gives attachment to an aponeurosis which affords a common origin to the flexor carpi ulnaris, the extensor carpi ulnaris, and the flexor digitorum profundus; its lower fourth is smooth and rounded. This border separates the medial from the dorsal surface.
* The interosseous crest (&quot;crista interossea; external or interosseous border&quot;) begins above by the union of two lines, which converge from the extremities of the radial notch and enclose between them a triangular space for the origin of part of the supinator; it ends below at the head of the ulna. Its upper part is sharp, its lower fourth smooth and rounded. This crest gives attachment to the interosseous membrane, and separates the volar from the dorsal surface.

;Surfaces
* The volar surface (&quot;facies volaris; anterior surface&quot;), much broader above than below, is concave in its upper three-fourths, and gives origin to the flexor digitorum profundus; its lower fourth, also concave, is covered by the pronator quadratus. The lower fourth is separated from the remaining portion by a ridge, directed obliquely downward and medialward, which marks the extent of origin of the pronator quadratus. At the junction of the upper with the middle third of the bone is the nutrient canal, directed obliquely upward.
* The dorsal surface (&quot;facies dorsalis; posterior surface&quot;) directed backward and lateralward, is broad and concave above; convex and somewhat narrower in the middle; narrow, smooth, and rounded below. On its upper part is an oblique ridge, which runs from the dorsal end of the radial notch, downward to the dorsal border; the triangular surface above this ridge receives the insertion of the anconeus, while the upper part of the ridge affords attachment to the supinator. Below this the surface is subdivided by a longitudinal ridge, sometimes called the perpendicular line, into two parts: the medial part is smooth, and covered by the extensor carpi ulnaris; the lateral portion, wider and rougher, gives origin from above downward to the supinator, the abductor pollicis longus, the extensor pollicis longus, and the extensor indicis proprius.
* The medial surface (&quot;facies medialis; internal surface&quot;) is broad and concave above, narrow and convex below. Its upper three-fourths give origin to the flexor digitorum profundus; its lower fourth is subcutaneous.

=== Near the wrist ===
Near the wrist, the ulnar, with two eminences; the lateral and larger is a rounded, articular eminence, termed the head of the ulna; the medial, narrower and more projecting, is a non-articular eminence, the ulnar styloid process.
* The head of the ulna presents an articular surface, part of which, of an oval or semilunar form, is directed downward, and articulates with the upper surface of the triangular articular disk which separates it from the wrist-joint; the remaining portion, directed lateralward, is narrow, convex, and received into the ulnar notch of the radius.
* The styloid process projects from the medial and back part of the bone; it descends a little lower than the head, and its rounded end affords attachment to the ulnar collateral ligament of the wrist-joint.

The head is separated from the styloid process by a depression for the attachment of the apex of the triangular articular disk, and behind, by a shallow groove for the tendon of the extensor carpi ulnaris.

===Microanatomy===
The ulna is a long bone. The long, narrow medullary cavity of the ulna is enclosed in a strong wall of cortical tissue which is thickest along the interosseous border and dorsal surface. At the extremities the compact layer thins. The compact layer is continued onto the back of the olecranon as a plate of close spongy bone with lamellae parallel. From the inner surface of this plate and the compact layer below it trabeculae arch forward toward the olecranon and coronoid and cross other trabeculae, passing backward over the medullary cavity from the upper part of the shaft below the coronoid. Below the coronoid process there is a small area of compact bone from which trabeculae curve upward to end obliquely to the surface of the semilunar notch which is coated with a thin layer of compact bone. The trabeculae at the lower end have a more longitudinal direction.

===Development===

The ulna is ossified from three centers: one each for the body, the wrist end, and the elbow end, near the top of the olecranon.
Ossification begins near the middle of the body of the ulna, about the eighth week of fetal life, and soon extends through the greater part of the bone.

At birth, the ends are cartilaginous. About the fourth year or so, a center appears in the middle of the head, and soon extends into the ulnar styloid process. About the tenth year, a center appears in the olecranon near its extremity, the chief part of this process being formed by an upward extension of the body. The upper epiphysis joins the body about the sixteenth, the lower about the twentieth year.

==Function==

===Joints===
The ulna forms part of the wrist joint and elbow joints. Specifically, the ulna joins (articulates) with:
* trochlea of the humerus, at the right side elbow as a hinge joint with semilunar trochlear notch of the ulna.
* the radius, near the elbow as a pivot joint, this allows the radius to cross over the ulna in pronation.
* the distal radius, where it fits into the ulnar notch.
* the radius along its length via the interosseous membrane that forms a syndesmosis joint

===Muscle attachments===

==Clinical significance==

===Fractures===

Specific types of ulna fracture include:
* Monteggia fracture - a fracture of the proximal third of the ulna with the dislocation of the head of the radius
* Hume fracture - a fracture of the olecranon with an associated anterior dislocation of the radial head
Conservative management is possible for ulnar fractures when they are located in the distal two-thirds, only involve the shaft, with no shortening, less than 10° angulation and less than 50% displacement. In such cases, a cast should be applied that goes above the elbow.

==Other animals==

In four-legged animals, the radius is the main load-bearing bone of the lower forelimb, and the ulna is important primarily for muscular attachment. In many mammals, the ulna is partially or wholly fused with the radius, and may therefore not exist as a separate bone. However, even in extreme cases of fusion, such as in horses, the olecranon process is still present, albeit as a projection from the upper radius.

In birds and other dinosaurs, the ulna forms a surface of attachment for the secondary feathers. These often leave osteological evidence in the form of quill knobs, allowing for identification of feathers in fossils that otherwise lack integumentary information.

<text>Roberto Clemente Coliseum (Spanish: &quot;Coliseo Roberto Clemente&quot;) is a sports and concert arena located in San Juan, Puerto Rico. It was, for many years, Puerto Rico&#x27;s largest indoor event facility, and remains one of the largest.

== General information ==
The Coliseum is named after baseball hall of famer Roberto Clemente, who died in a plane crash off Isla Verde International Airport in Carolina in 1972, while flying with relief articles to be given to victims of the Nicaragua earthquake. Construction of the facility began in the early 1970s, it was finished in January 1973, and inaugurated in February of that year by the Fania All-Stars.

The coliseum has been host to a variety of events, including world championship boxing and basketball, business expos, circus, concerts and other things.

Many Puerto Rican and international performers have been at the arena, among others.

Concerts that have been held there include:

Van Halen were scheduled to perform during their III Tour on September 20 and December 11, 1998, but the shows were cancelled.

It has been the home of three different BSN professional basketball teams and the BSN has also used it as a neutral site for their most important games, including game 7 of the championship finals, several times.

The Coliseum has also been used by religious leaders for conferences and religious services.

Most of the world championship boxing bouts fought in Puerto Rico during the late 1970s and early 1980s were fought at the Roberto Clemente coliseum, including Roberto Durán&#x27;s world title defense versus Mexican Leoncio Ortiz, Wilfredo Gómez&#x27;s knockout win against Carlos Zarate, many of Samuel Serrano&#x27;s title defenses, and the fight where Muhammad Ali defended his title against Jean Pierre Coopman, the only time a world Heavyweight championship fight has been held in Puerto Rico. George Foreman had his last fight (and experienced the vision that led him to become a born-again Christian in one of its dressing rooms) before announcing his first retirement there, and Julio César Chávez had one of his first important fights there, on the undercard of Edwin Rosario&#x27;s world Lightweight championship win against José Luis Ramírez. Because of all the boxing action going on during that era, many observers call the period from the middle 1970s to the middle 1980s as the &quot;golden age of boxing in Puerto Rico&quot;.

The arena also hosted the final phase of the 1974 World Basketball championship.

The Coliseum has also been the place of large political rallies, and Puerto Rico&#x27;s &quot;electoral commission&quot; uses its facilities to count votes after each election, and also hosted Miss Universe 2002, won by Oxana Fedorova of Russia. The Van Halen concert was cancelled due to a hurricane. Some days later the band sent a cargo plane with care packages.

<doc id="210299" wikidata="Q6144161" url="?curid=210299" title="Light value">
<text>In photography, light value has been used to refer to a &quot;light level&quot; for either incident or reflected light, often on a base-2 logarithmic scale. The term does not derive from a published standard, and has had several different meanings:

# An arbitrary value indicated by an exposure meter such as the Weston Master V, discussed in Adams (1948, 14–18). This may have been the origin of the term. The indicated light value was transferred to the meter&#x27;s exposure calculator, which then was used to determine camera settings. Ray (2000) uses the term, with the acronym &#x27;LV&#x27;, in this sense. The Honeywell/Pentax 1°/21° spot meter indicated in &quot;light level&quot; (&quot;LL&quot;), with LL essentially exposure value (EV) for ISO 100 film speed. The later Pentax Spotmeter V and Digital Spotmeter indicated directly in EV for ISO 100, but they made no mention of &quot;light level&quot;, &quot;light value&quot;, or LV.
# A synonym for incident light value, from the Additive system of Photographic EXposure (APEX). Zakia and Stroebel (1993) and Stroebel, Compton, Current, and Zakia (2000) used the term in this sense. They used the APEX symbol formula_1, normally used for luminance value.
# An apparent synonym for luminance value, from APEX. Stroebel, Compton, Current, and Zakia (2000) referred to &quot;scene illuminance&quot; in the text of the article, but the example used units of luminance. The defining equation used the symbol formula_2. The table at the end of the article used units of illuminance and the symbol formula_1, as noted above.
# A synonym for exposure value (EV) (e.g., Kyoritsu calibrated light sources, for which the luminance ranges are specified in terms of &quot;LV at ISO 100&quot;. Kyoritsu specify the luminance ranges of their multi-function camera testers in EV, presumably at ISO 100).
# A synonym for &quot;EV at ISO 100 film speed&quot;. This usage appears on many web pages, usually without attribution of an authoritative source. Eads (2000) proposed a revised APEX in which luminance value was equal to EV for ISO 100 speed, but he did not use the term &quot;light value&quot;.
# Literally speaking, the English term &quot;light value&quot; could be translated as &quot;Lichtwert&quot; in German language, however, this is &quot;not&quot; what the term &quot;Lichtwert&quot;, as it was introduced by the German shutter manufacturer Friedrich Deckel in 1954 and defined as &quot;Belichtungswert&quot; in DIN 19010, is used for in German-speaking countries. Instead, the established term &quot;Lichtwert&quot; (abbreviated as &quot;LW&quot;) describes what became known as exposure value (EV) elsewhere.

In APEX, luminance value and incident light value are numerically equal, so that for a given &quot;light value&quot;, either meaning 2 or 3 would result in the same camera settings.

<text>Esso () is a trading name for ExxonMobil. Originally, the name was primarily used by its predecessor Standard Oil of New Jersey after the breakup of the original Standard Oil company in 1911. The company adopted the name &quot;Esso&quot; (the phonetic pronunciation of Standard Oil&#x27;s initials, &#x27;S&#x27; and &#x27;O&#x27;), to which the other Standard Oil companies would later object.

Standard Oil of New Jersey started marketing its products under the Esso brand in 1926. In 1972, the name Esso was largely replaced in the U.S. by the Exxon brand after the Standard Oil of New Jersey bought Humble Oil, while the Esso name remained widely used elsewhere. In most of the world, the Esso brand and the Mobil brand are the primary brand names of ExxonMobil, while the Exxon brand is used only in the United States alongside Mobil.

== History ==

In 1911, Standard Oil was broken up into 34 companies, some of which were named Standard Oil and had the rights to that brand in certain states (the other companies had no territorial rights). The name Esso is the phonetic pronunciation of the initials &#x27;S&#x27; and &#x27;O&#x27; in the name Standard Oil. Standard Oil Company (New Jersey; &quot;Jersey Standard&quot;) had the rights in that state, plus in Maryland, West Virginia, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and the District of Columbia. By 1941, it had also acquired the rights in Pennsylvania, Delaware, Arkansas, Tennessee, and Louisiana.

It also used the Esso brand in New York and the six New England states, where the Standard Oil Company of New York (Socony-Vacuum, later Socony Mobil) had the rights, but did not object to the New Jersey company&#x27;s use of the trademark (the two companies did not merge until November 1999). However, in the other states, the other Standard Oil companies objected and, via a 1937 U.S. federal court injunction, forced Jersey Standard to use other brand names. In most states the company used the Enco (&quot;Energy Company&quot;) brand name, and in a few, the Humble brand name. The objections were mostly made by Standard Oil of Ohio and, in the 1960s, Standard Oil of California (now Chevron Corporation) after their acquisition of former Esso jobber Standard Oil of Kentucky. The other major Standard Oil spinoff, Standard Oil of Indiana (which became Amoco) largely did not object due to the Midwestern United States being a weaker market for Esso. Likewise, The Ohio Oil Company, which eventually became Marathon Oil, did not market its downstream assets under the Standard name due to Sohio and Amoco owning the rights to the name in its core Midwestern territory.

The other Standard companies likewise were &quot;Standard&quot; or some variant on that name in their home states, and another brand name in other states. Esso ranked 31st among American corporations in the value of World War II production contracts.

During the years of racial segregation in the United States, Esso franchises gave out &quot;The Negro Motorist Green Book: An International Travel Guide&quot;.

In 1973, Standard Oil of New Jersey renamed itself Exxon Corporation, and adopted the Exxon brand name throughout the country. It maintained the trademark rights to the Standard and Esso brands in the states where it held those rights by selling Esso Diesel in those states at stations that sell diesel fuel, thus preventing the trademark from being declared abandoned.

It retained the Esso brand in Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands until 2008, when it sold its stations there to TotalEnergies.

The Enco brand name was used on locations in the Midwest until 1977, when they were sold to Cheker Oil Co. (now part of 7-Eleven); Exxon continues to have a presence in southern Ohio today (as it does throughout much of Appalachia in general), though Mobil is the company&#x27;s primary brand in the Midwest.
In February 2016, ExxonMobil successfully asked a U.S. federal court to lift the 1930s, trademark injunction that banned it from using the Esso brand in some states. By this time, as a result of numerous mergers and rebranding, most of the remaining Standard Oil companies that had objected to the Esso name had been acquired by BP. ExxonMobil cited trademark surveys in which there was no longer possible confusion with the Esso name as it was more than seven decades before. Neither BP nor Chevron (which had minimized the use of the Standard name in the 1970s) had any objection to lifting the ban.

ExxonMobil did not specify whether they would now open new stations in the U.S. under the Esso name; they were primarily concerned about the additional expenses of having separate marketing, letterheads, packaging, and other materials that omit Esso. The Esso name did return to minor station signage at both Exxon and Mobil stations, which also had the effect of ExxonMobil de facto claiming the Standard trademark in Colorado, Kentucky, Montana, North Dakota, Oklahoma and Wyoming as Chevron withdrew from Kentucky in 2010 and BP gradually withdrew sales from the other states.

== United Kingdom ==

In 1888, the Anglo American Oil Company opened its head office in London, which eventually became a part of Esso. In August 1998, Tesco announced a partnership with Esso, opening chains of Tesco Express stores located within forecourts, which continues today. In February 2000, the two companies were opening one new store a month, creating 4,000 jobs.
=== Esso Blue ===
Esso Blue was the brand name of Esso&#x27;s paraffin oil (kerosene) for domestic heaters in countries such as the United Kingdom. Their television advertising song from the 1950s, through to the 1970s, was the famous &quot;Bom, Bom, Bom, Bom, Esso Blue!&quot;

One campaign used the well-known song tune of &quot;Smoke Gets in Your Eyes&quot; reworded as: &quot;They asked me how I knew, it was Esso Blue, I of course replied, with lower grades one buys, smoke gets in your eyes. The non-smoking paraffin&quot;.
The track was released as a flexi disk which was given away free in hardware stores.

=== Cleveland ===
In the 1930s, Esso acquired Cleveland, an independent company based in North East England. Its founder and principal shareholder, Norman Davis, had spent some of World War I with his brother Manuel in Cleveland, Ohio. Cleveland&#x27;s products included a benzole blend and an alcohol blend called &quot;Discol&quot;. The Esso and Cleveland names continued in use until 1973, when the Cleveland filling stations were re-branded as Esso.

===Northern Ireland===
Esso traded in Northern Ireland up until the early 2000s. Their forecourts were re-branded as Maxol and Texaco and some remained private.

===Euro Garages===
45 of Euro Garages&#x27; forecourts were bought from Esso in 2013, and are operated under the Esso brand. They plan to roll out partner brands such as Starbucks and Spar, replacing the Esso branded shops.

=== Esso ROC / On the Run / Snack and Shop===
ROC used self-branded stores under the &quot;Snack and Shop&quot; and &quot;On the Run&quot; branding depending on the size and the larger sites featured a Costa Cafe. ROC was the name for Esso&#x27;s self-operated forecourts.

By 2015, ROC UK had sold all their sites to operators such as Rontec and Euro Garages, leaving no forecourts directly operated by Esso in the UK.

== Affiliates ==

=== Australia ===

In Australia, Esso is an affiliate of ExxonMobil; it operates oil and gas production. Its retail petrol stations were acquired by Mobil Australia in 1990.

=== Canada ===

In Canada, the Esso brand is used on stations supplied by Imperial Oil, which is 69.8% owned by ExxonMobil. The stations are owned by third-party retailers such as:
* Couche-Tard (mostly Ontario and Quebec, with stores primarily operating under the Circle K, Couche-Tard and Mac&#x27;s brands),
* 7-Eleven (mostly Alberta and British Columbia),
* Parkland Fuel,
* Harnois Groupe pétrolier (mostly in Quebec, with a few stations in Ontario, and one each in Alberta, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia as of August 2023),
* Husky Energy (which were sold to Parkland Fuel and Federated Co-operatives (&quot;Co-op&quot;) in 2022), and
* Wilson Fuel in Nova Scotia and Newfoundland (which were sold to Couche-Tard in 2021).
Imperial Oil began to sell the majority of its company-owned stations in 2016.

Esso also provides aviation fuel services at 80 airport locations in Canada (Aviation and Avitat).

=== Caribbean ===
Esso has sold most of its assets in the Caribbean. In 2008 it sold its retail operations in Puerto Rico, the United States Virgin Islands and Jamaica to TotalEnergies. Those were converted to the Total brand. In 2014, Sol Petroleum purchased Esso operations in The Bahamas, Barbados, Bermuda, Cayman Islands, Dominican Republic, Guadeloupe and Martinique. Rights to continue to operate in those countries under the Esso name were included.

=== France ===
Esso S.A.F. is the French subsidiary of ExxonMobil, operating several hundred filling stations and two refineries in France.

=== Japan ===

Established as Esso Standard Sekiyu K.K. in 1962, following the dissolution of the Standard Vacuum Oil Company. It became Esso Sekiyu K.K. in 1982. After the Exxon and Mobil merger in 1999, the Japanese subsidiaries were reorganized as ExxonMobil Y.K. in 2002, which spun off its downstream business to EMG Marketing G.K. in 2012, and acquired as a subsidiary by TonenGeneral Sekiyu K.K. in the same year. In 2016, JX Holdings and the TonenGeneral Group merged into JXTG Holdings (now Eneos Holdings), leading to the dissolution and absorption of EMG Marketing into a subsidiary of the new company, JXTG Nippon Oil &amp; Energy (now Eneos), in 2017. In 2019, the company began to phase out the Esso and Mobil brands in Japan, replacing it with JX&#x27;s Eneos EneJet banner.

=== South America ===

Standard Oil of New Jersey started business in Argentina in 1911, acquiring the &quot;Compañía Nacional de Aceites&quot; (National Company of Oil), which had been founded in 1906 by entrepreneur Emilio Schiffner in Campana, Buenos Aires to produce kerosene. It became the first oil refinery in Latin America, doing business as &quot;Compañía Nativa de Petróleo&quot;. Soon after, it merged with another foreign company operating in Argentina, West India Oil Co. (mostly known as &quot;WICO&quot;). The first petrol pump was placed in the Plaza del Congreso of Buenos Aires, while the first service station opened in 1927 in the city of Santa Fe. The company opened other refineries in Neuquén and Jujuy provinces. The company also introduced its motor oil line, &quot;Essolube&quot; in 1936. By 1943, Esso produced the 60% of petroleum in Argentina.

In 2011, local consortium Bridas Corporation (formed by Bridas Energy Holdings Limited and Chinese CNOOC International Limited) acquired rights to the Esso brand in Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay. As a result, all the Esso stations were rebranded as &quot;Axion Energy&quot;. At the time of the acquisition, Esso had 520 stations (with 450 under franchises), being the third largest producer of Argentine after YPF and Shell, with a 12% market share.

== Branding ==
Esso is ExxonMobil&#x27;s primary motor fuel brand worldwide except in Australia, Guam, Mexico, Nigeria, and New Zealand, where the Mobil brand is used exclusively. In Canada (since 2017), Colombia, Egypt, and formerly Malaysia (until 2013, when Petron (the former Esso Philippines) acquired ExxonMobil&#x27;s Malaysian operations) and Japan (until 2019), both the Esso and Mobil brands are used. In Hong Kong and Singapore, Mobil brand is applied on Esso fuel tank after Mobil service stations began to merge with Esso between 2003 and 2007.

Mobil is ExxonMobil&#x27;s primary retail motor fuel brand in California, Florida, New York, New England, the Great Lakes and the Midwest. Exxon is the primary brand in the rest of the United States, with the highest concentration of retail outlets located in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Texas and in the Mid-Atlantic and Southeastern states.

== Advertising campaigns ==

In the 1960s, campaigns featuring heavy spending in different mass media channels became more prominent. Esso spent hundreds of millions of dollars on a brand awareness campaign built around the simple and alliterative theme, &quot;Put a Tiger in Your Tank&quot;, which was invented by Emery Smith in 1959.

The North American and later European campaign featured extensive television and radio and magazine ads, including photos with tiger tails supposedly emerging from car gas tanks, in England there were faux tiger tails with pink ribbons to tie round underneath the cap of the petrol tank so as to look as if there was a tiger in the tank: these were often seen on the road in the 1960s; at one time in England there was a television advertisement where a sombre man labelled as the advertising manager said that they were no longer going to have the tiger, followed a short while later with advertisements for the save the tiger campaign, promotional events featuring real tigers, billboards, and in Europe station pump hoses &quot;wrapped in tiger stripes&quot; as well as pop music songs. Tiger imagery can still be seen on the pumps of successor firm ExxonMobil.

==Commercial automotive and motorcycle partnerships==

Esso, along with its sister brands Exxon and Mobil, are official long-term recommended gasoline of two Volkswagen Group marques (mainly Bentley and Porsche), all Toyota Group marques and subsidiaries (including Toyota, Lexus, Daihatsu, Hino, and Perodua, shared with Petron) and General Motors marques and subsidiaries (including Chevrolet, Cadillac, Buick, Holden, SAIC-GM-Wuling and former GM marques such as Opel and Vauxhall) for automobiles. They are also recommended fuels for KTM motorcycles.

== Motorsports ==
Formula One team Lotus had Esso sponsorship from 1962 until 1967 while sponsoring Indianapolis 500 winner and Formula One world champion Jim Clark as well as Brabham from 1964 until 1973. From 2002 to 2009, Esso sponsored Toyota F1, as well as Jordan and its successor, Midland in 2005 and 2006, after Esso became ExxonMobil&#x27;s global primary fuel brand through the merger of Exxon with Mobil in 1999. Williams F1 had one season of Esso sponsorship in 2009 when Petrobras left F1 in 2008 before they returned in 2014. The Esso brand was used in McLaren Formula One cars along with Mobil from 2014 despite Esso actually partnering and supplying fuels for McLaren team from 2015 to 2016 seasons, as well as Exxon from 2015 in United States Grand Prix only, as they are currently ExxonMobil brands after the merger. In 2017, ExxonMobil switched to Red Bull Racing, as well as Faenza-based sister team Scuderia Toro Rosso for one season only.

Enco, as sister brand of Esso before both renamed as Exxon in 1973, had sponsored three Indianapolis 500 winning cars in 1965, 1967 and 1968, won by Jim Clark, A. J. Foyt and Bobby Unser, powered by Ford for 1965 and 1967 seasons, and Offenhauser for 1968 season.

Esso is also active in 24 Hours of Le Mans and various endurance racing, sponsoring Martini Lancia from 1982 to 1986, Le Mans-winning Peugeot 905 from 1990 to 1993, and Toyota GT-One in 1998–99. Since 1996 Esso currently supplying fuels for all Porsche Mobil 1 Supercup entrants under Mobil brand as ExxonMobil increased its fuel partnership role with Porsche Mobil 1 Supercup as Esso since the 2015 season.

<doc id="210314" wikidata="Q25950" url="?curid=210314" title="Apodiformes">
<text>The Apodiformes is an order, or taxonomic grouping, of birds which traditionally contained three living families—the [[Apodiformes|Apodidae]] (swifts), the [[Apodiformes|Hemiprocnidae]] (treeswifts), and the [[Apodiformes|Trochilidae]] (hummingbirds); however, in the Sibley-Ahlquist taxonomy, this order is elevated to the superorder Apodimorphae, in which hummingbirds are separated into a new order, the [[Trochiliformes]]. With nearly 450 species identified to date, it is the most diverse order of birds after the [[Apodiformes|Passeriformes]] (the &quot;perching&quot; birds).

==Description, etymology and taxonomy==
As the name &quot;apodiforme&quot;—meaning &quot;footless&quot; in Greek—suggests, the legs of hummingbirds, swifts and treeswifts (or &#x27;crested&#x27; swifts) are rather small and offer limited functional uses, aside from perching; their feet are covered with bare skin, rather than the scutes seen on many birds. Another commonality amongst Apodiformes is their evolving longer wings with short and stout humerus bones, a development which has provided the hummingbirds, in particular, with the ideal wings for hovering.

Together, the hummingbirds, swifts and treeswifts share several anatomical commonalities with their likely-closest extant relatives in the genus &quot;Aegotheles&quot;—the owlet-nightjars; in particular, similarities are noted between the birds&#x27; skull structures. 

The owlet-nightjars are, apparently, convergent with the closely-related Caprimulgiformes (nightjars), which form a clade known as Cypselomorphae together with the Apodiformes and the frogmouths, oilbirds and potoos.

==Evolution==
The Apodiformes evolved in the Northern Hemisphere. &quot;Eocypselus&quot;, a primitive genus known from the Late Paleocene or Early Eocene of north-central Europe, is somewhat difficult to assign; it is considered a primitive hemiprocnid. This would suggest that the major apodiform lineages diverged shortly after the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary. However, the perching adaptation of the foot of &quot;Eocypselus&quot; on which this theory rests may just as well be a symplesiomorphy.
Most researchers believe that presently this genus cannot be unequivocally assigned to either the Apodiformes or the Caprimulgiformes. 

The Early Eocene &quot;Primapus&quot;, found in England, is similar to both a primitive swift and the aegialornithids, which are in some aspects intermediate between swifts and owlet-nightjars. Fossil evidence demonstrates the existence of swifts during that period in Europe. At that time, most of Europe had a humid, subtropical climate, possibly comparable to modern-day southern China. For a map of Early–Middle Eocene Earth, see the Paleomap project; here note that both the Caucasus Mountains and the Alps did not exist yet and aegialornithids were possibly present in North America.
By the late Eocene (around 35 MYA), primitive hummingbirds started to diverge from the related jungornithids; the Middle Eocene &quot;Parargornis&quot; (Messel, Germany) and the Late Eocene &quot;Argornis&quot;, found in today&#x27;s southernmost Russia, belong to this lineage. &quot;Cypselavus&quot; (Late Eocene – Early Oligocene of Quercy, France) was either a primitive hemiprocnid or an aegialornithid.

The placement of the Aegialornithidae is not quite clear. Various analyses place them sufficiently close to the Apodiformes to be included here, or into the unique owlet-nightjar lineage in the Cypselomorphae.

<doc id="210315" wikidata="Q1365684" url="?curid=210315" title="Sesamoid bone">
<text>In anatomy, a sesamoid bone () is a bone embedded within a tendon or a muscle. Its name is derived from the Greek word for &#x27;sesame seed&#x27;, indicating the small size of most sesamoids. Often, these bones form in response to strain, or can be present as a normal variant. The patella is the largest sesamoid bone in the body. Sesamoids act like pulleys, providing a smooth surface for tendons to slide over, increasing the tendon&#x27;s ability to transmit muscular forces.

==Structure==
Sesamoid bones can be found on joints throughout the human body, including:

* In the knee—the patella (within the quadriceps tendon). This is the largest sesamoid bone.
* In the hand—two sesamoid bones are commonly found in the distal portions of the first metacarpal bone (within the tendons of adductor pollicis and flexor pollicis brevis). There is also commonly a sesamoid bone in distal portions of the second metacarpal bone and fifth metacarpal bone.
* In the wrist—The pisiform of the wrist is a sesamoid bone (within the tendon of flexor carpi ulnaris). It begins to ossify in children ages 9–12.
* In the foot—the first metatarsal bone usually has two sesamoid bones at its connection to the big toe (both within the tendon of flexor hallucis brevis). One is found on the lateral side of the first metatarsal while the other is found on the medial side. In some people, only a single sesamoid is found on the first metatarsal bone.

==Common variants==
* One or both of the sesamoid bones under the first metatarsophalangeal joint (of the great toe) can be multipartite – in two or three parts (mostly bipartite – in two parts). 
* The fabella is a small sesamoid bone found in some mammals embedded in the tendon of the lateral head of the gastrocnemius muscle behind the lateral condyle of the femur. It is a variant of normal anatomy and present in humans in 10% to 30% of individuals. The fabella can also be mutipartite or bipartite.
* The cyamella is a small sesamoid bone embedded in the tendon of the popliteus muscle. It is a variant of normal anatomy. It is rarely seen in humans, but has been described more often in other primates and certain other animals.

==Clinical significance== 
* A common foot ailment in dancers is sesamoiditis (an inflammation of the sesamoid bones under the first metatarsophalangeal joint of the big toe). This is a form of tendinitis which results from the tendons surrounding the sesamoid becoming inflamed or irritated.
* Sesamoid bones generally have a very limited blood supply, rendering them prone to avascular necrosis (bone death from lack of blood supply), which is very difficult to treat.

==Other animals==
In equine anatomy, the term sesamoid bone usually refers to the two sesamoid bones found at the back of the fetlock or metacarpophalangeal and metatarsophalangeal joints in both hindlimbs and forelimbs. Strictly these should be termed the proximal sesamoid bones whereas the navicular bone should be referred to as the distal sesamoid bone. The patella is also a form of sesamoid bone in the horse.

Although many carnivores have radial sesamoid bones, the giant panda and red panda independently evolved to have an enlarged radial sesamoid bone. This evolution has caused the two species to diverge from other carnivores. The red panda likely originally evolved the &quot;pseudo-thumb&quot; in order to assist in arboreal locomotion. When the red panda later evolved to consume a bamboo diet, the enlarged bone underwent exaptation to assist in grasping bamboo. The giant panda, however, evolved the enlarged radial sesamoid bone around the same time as it evolved a bamboo diet. In the giant panda, the bone allows for a pincer-like motion and is used in grasping the bamboo. In these two panda species, &quot;DYNC2H1&quot; gene and &quot;PCNT&quot; gene have been identified as possible causes for the pseudo-thumb development.

Recently, the enlarged radial sesamoid bone of cotton rats has been studied. Their enlarged radial sesamoid bone and that of the giant panda have a similar morphology and size relative to the rest of the hand. The reason for this evolutionary change is still unknown; however, it may be to assist in grasping small objects and thin branches.

Elephants have similarly enlarged sesamoid bones in both their forelimbs and hindlimbs, referred to as the prepollex and prehallux, respectively. These sesamoids function as &quot;sixth toes&quot;, helping to distribute the animals&#x27; weight. In contrast to other sesamoids in elephants, which ossify at three to seven years of age, the ossification of the prepollex and prehallux is delayed and is known to not have yet occurred in animals in excess of 20 years of age. The prehallux is further divided into two elements; the more proximal of these is fixed, whilst the more distal is mobile. Evidence of these &quot;predigits&quot; has also been found in certain fossil proboscideans.

The forepaws of moles also possess a prepollex consisting of an enlarged, sickle-shaped sesamoid.

<doc id="210316" wikidata="Q1514846" url="?curid=210316" title="Gerry (2002 film)">
<text>Gerry is a 2002 American drama film written and directed by Gus Van Sant, and starring and co-written by Matt Damon and Casey Affleck. It is the first installment of Van Sant&#x27;s &quot;Death Trilogy&quot;, three films based on deaths that occurred in real life and is succeeded by &quot;Elephant&quot; (2003) and &quot;Last Days&quot; (2005).

&quot;Gerry&quot; follows two hiking companions who both go by the name &quot;Gerry&quot;. &quot;Gerry&quot; is also a slang term, used by both protagonists throughout the misadventure, meaning &quot;to screw up&quot;. Van Sant revealed in interviews that Damon, Affleck, and his brother Ben had already coined the term prior to the title being chosen.

The plot shares some commonalities with the events surrounding the death of David Coughlin, who was killed after he and a friend became lost in Rattlesnake Canyon in New Mexico. The style was largely inspired by the work of Hungarian filmmaker Béla Tarr, namely its use of extended scenes playing out in uncut master shots. There are a few direct visual quotations from Tarr&#x27;s &quot;Sátántangó&quot; (1994), such as a shot following the two protagonists while tumbleweeds blow around them that mimics a shot in Tarr&#x27;s film where two men walk through a town as a windstorm blows around leaves and trash.

Besides the work of Tarr, the video game &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; was cited as an influence on the style. Van Sant had mentioned that he had not had much experience with video games and was struck by the fact that the lack of the ability to cut away from the action in video games meant having to stay with the characters during travel that would normally be glossed over in films. In an interview with &quot;Filmmaker Magazine&quot;, Van Sant stated &quot;In some ways, Gerry is Béla Tarr fused with &quot;Tomb Raider&quot;!&quot;

&quot;Gerry&quot; is frequently cited as an example of non-narrative cinema.

==Plot==
The characters drive to a remote location to hike at a site marked &quot;Wilderness Trail&quot;. As they start, they see some other hikers passing by. In order to not be bothered by these hikers, they decide to go off-trail. After some walking, talking, and an impromptu foot race, they decide to head back. Before long, they realize that they are lost. That night, they build a campfire.

Over the next couple of days, the two hikers wander through the wilderness without food or water. They try to split up for a while, retrace their steps and follow some animal tracks, all to no avail. They grow increasingly irritated with each other as the situation becomes dire.

They eventually find themselves slowly walking mostly in silence through a desert. They finally collapse due to fatigue and dehydration. The weaker of the two (Affleck) proclaims that he is &quot;leaving&quot; and reaches towards Damon&#x27;s character. Damon&#x27;s character rolls on top of Affleck and wordlessly strangles him before collapsing again.

After some time, Damon&#x27;s character awakens and realizes that a highway is not far away. In the final sequence, he is badly sunburned but watches the passing landscape from the car of the father and son who have seemingly rescued him.

==Production==
The inspiration for the film was the real-life murder of David Coughlin, which Damon related to Van Sant, in which Coughlin and his best friend got lost in the desert, with the latter eventually killing Coughlin. Van Sant deliberately chose not to look up more information on the event because &quot;we didn&#x27;t want to do their story,&quot; instead deciding it would be &quot;an inspirational aside&quot;.

Besides the news item, other influences include Van Sant&#x27;s own experience getting lost as well as Chantal Akerman&#x27;s &quot;Jeanne Dielman, 23 quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles&quot; (1975). Initially Van Sant planned to shoot the film with digital video, which he said would have resembled &quot;a John Cassavetes film in the desert&quot;. Casey Affleck eventually convinced him to use 35 mm film instead, with Van Sant noting, &quot;once we did that, everything changed&quot;. From this decision he began incorporating influences from the film work of Béla Tarr, specifically his use of long takes.

The film is notable for its lack of dialogue. Initially Van Sant &quot;thought we were definitely going to have a lot of long bits of soul-searching dialogue.&quot; During shooting this never came to pass, and Van Sant asserted that the long silences were &quot;our version&quot; of such dialogue. Van Sant wanted the spare dialogue not to cover things for the audience&#x27;s sake; he explained, &quot;When [Matt and Casey] are talking, they&#x27;re just talking and not pointing out stuff that we&#x27;re supposed to know. If they&#x27;re talking about something, and we don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re talking about, then that&#x27;s okay. So long as they know what they&#x27;re talking about.&quot;

Van Sant hoped to shoot the film in Argentina to avoid a possible Actors Guild strike, but the location proved colder than anticipated. He then looked to Wadi Rum in Jordan, but he was dissuaded from going there because a travel advisory was in effect due to potential terrorist activities. The team finally settled on Death Valley, California. Although the film had a script, it was used as more of an outline, and the team regularly disregarded it. They were unsure of how the film would end if the film was shot in sequence.

<doc id="210318" wikidata="Q181490" url="?curid=210318" title="Teri Hatcher">
<text>Teri Lynn Hatcher (born December 8, 1964) is an American actress best known for her portrayals of Lois Lane on the television series &quot;Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman&quot; (1993–1997). She also played Paris Carver in the &quot;James Bond&quot; film &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot; (1997), Mel Jones and the Beldam in &quot;Coraline&quot; (2009) and Susan Mayer on the television series &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; (2004–2012), for which she won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Musical or Comedy and three Screen Actors Guild Awards (one as lead female actor, two as part of Best Ensemble), and was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series.

==Early life==
Hatcher was born on December 8, 1964, in Palo Alto, California, the only child of Esther Beshur, a computer programmer who worked for Lockheed Martin and Owen Walker Hatcher Jr., a nuclear physicist and electrical engineer. Her father is of Welsh ancestry, while her mother is of French, German and Syrian ancestry.

Hatcher took ballet lessons at the San Juan School of Dance in Los Altos and grew up in Sunnyvale, California. At De Anza College she studied mathematics and engineering.

In March 2006, she alleged that she was sexually abused from the age of five by Richard Hayes Stone, an uncle by marriage who was later divorced by Hatcher&#x27;s aunt. She said her parents were unaware of the abuse. In 2002, she assisted Santa Clara County prosecutors with their indictment of Stone for a more recent sexual offense that led his female victim to commit suicide at 14. Stone pleaded guilty to four counts of child sexual abuse and was sentenced to 14 years in prison. Hatcher said she told the prosecutors about her own abuse because she was haunted by thoughts of the 14-year-old girl who shot herself, and feared Stone might escape conviction. Stone died of colon cancer on August 19, 2008, after serving six years of his sentence.

==Career==
===1984–1992: Early work===
Hatcher studied acting at the American Conservatory Theater. One of her early jobs (in 1984) was as an NFL cheerleader with the San Francisco 49ers. From September 1985 to May 1986, she joined the cast of the TV series &quot;The Love Boat&quot; as Amy, one of the Mermaid showgirls. It mainly involved dancing and singing as part of the Mermaids show routine, but she had short comedic lines in some episodes, and in one episode was part of one of three storylines opposite a male guest star. From 1986 to 1989, she appeared in six episodes of the TV series &quot;MacGyver&quot; as talkative but naive Penny Parker opposite Richard Dean Anderson&#x27;s eponymous hero.

In 1987, she played the sensible, intelligent 18-year-old daughter of Patty Duke&#x27;s lead character in the short-lived Fox comedy &quot;Karen&#x27;s Song,&quot; and had a guest-star role in an episode of &quot;Night Court&quot;. In 1988, she made a short guest appearance in the &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; episode &quot;The Outrageous Okona&quot; as Lt. Robinson. In 1989, she guest-starred in an episode of &quot;Quantum Leap,&quot; &quot;Star Crossed&quot;, as the main character&#x27;s mathematician/scientist future wife; and guest-starred as a nude beauty pageant winner in an episode of &quot;L.A. Law&quot;. That year she also made her motion picture debut with a minor role as a young opportunistic actress in &quot;The Big Picture,&quot; starring Kevin Bacon. She then played Sylvester Stallone&#x27;s younger sister, a dancer, in the big-budget police action-comedy &quot;Tango and Cash&quot;, also starring Kurt Russell; it was a critical and box office disappointment.

After a short guest appearance in an episode of &quot;Murphy Brown&quot; in 1990, Hatcher&#x27;s next TV series role, in 1991, was in the Norman Lear creation &quot;Sunday Dinner&quot;, a comedy. She co-starred as 30-year-old lawyer in a mostly physical relationship with a widowed businessman twice her age, played by Robert Loggia. The series had a brief run on CBS that summer but was not renewed. She also acted in the television crime movie &quot;Dead in the Water&quot; (1991) in which she plays Bryan Brown&#x27;s lawyer&#x27;s young, attractive temptress secretary, and in the low-budget erotic thriller &quot;The Cool Surface&quot; (not released until 1994), wherein she plays a young actress who has an ill-fated romance with an enigmatic, unsettled screenwriter. In late 1991 Hatcher was featured as Michael Bolton&#x27;s love interest in the music video for Bolton&#x27;s hit song &quot;Missing You Now&quot;. In 1992, Hatcher tried out for the role of Jamie Buchman on &quot;Mad About You&quot; and made it to the final two choices, but lost the part to Helen Hunt.

===1993–1997: Breakthrough===

Hatcher made a much-discussed guest appearance on a 1993 episode of &quot;Seinfeld&quot;, in which her character, Sidra, breaks up with Jerry because she believes Jerry sent his friend Elaine into a sauna to find out if Sidra&#x27;s breasts are natural or enhanced by surgery. The episode concludes with Sidra saying to Jerry, &quot;By the way, they&#x27;re real, and they&#x27;re spectacular&quot; as she leaves his apartment. Hatcher returned to play Sidra in brief scenes in two subsequent episodes: &quot;The Pilot&quot;, the fourth season finale, and &quot;The Finale (Part 2)&quot;, the series finale.

Hatcher landed a starring role in the ABC television series &quot;Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman&quot; as the &quot;Daily Planet&quot; reporter Lois Lane (opposite Dean Cain as Superman/Clark Kent) from 1993 to 1997. At the height of the show&#x27;s popularity in 1995, a picture of Hatcher wearing nothing but Superman&#x27;s iconic red cape was reportedly the most downloaded image on the Internet for several months. &quot;It&#x27;s a great shot,&quot; she said. &quot;Not so much because it&#x27;s me. It&#x27;s just cool looking.&quot; Hatcher also co-wrote an episode for season three called &quot;It&#x27;s A Small World After All&quot; about a former classmate who shrinks and kidnaps her classmate&#x27;s spouses and traps them in a dollhouse.

Hatcher hosted NBC&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in 1996. Hatcher won the role of Paris Carver (beating Monica Bellucci) in the 1997 James Bond film &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot;. Hatcher was three months pregnant at the filming&#x27;s start. A publicist said the pregnancy did not affect the production schedule. 
She was voted the world&#x27;s sexiest woman by readers of popular men&#x27;s magazine &quot;FHM&quot; in spring 1997 after having been number four in 1996 and was number 15 in 1998; she also made the list&#x27;s top 100 in 1999 and 2000. Celebrity Sleuth ranked her as its Sexiest Woman for 1997, the only year it ranked her in its Top 25 list. The Australian version of &quot;FHM&quot; began a 100 Sexiest Women list in 1998 and Hatcher placed 25th on the list, but she did not make the next list published in 2000.

Hatcher also appeared in films such as &quot;Spy Kids&quot; (2001), and played a villain in two crime dramas, the ensemble &quot;2 Days in the Valley&quot; (1996), a moderate box office success, and &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Prisoners&quot; (1996), co-starring Alec Baldwin, which failed at the box office.

Hatcher appeared in a series of RadioShack television commercials alongside National Football League player Howie Long.

===2004–2012: Commercial success with &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot;===

She beat four other actresses for one of the lead roles on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot;, in which she starred as Susan Mayer, a role for which she won the Best Actress in a Musical or Comedy Golden Globe Award in January 2005. Later that year, Hatcher won the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) award in the same category. In July 2005, she was nominated for an Emmy award as Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series, along with co-stars Marcia Cross and Felicity Huffman.

Hatcher again made FHM&#x27;s world&#x27;s sexiest woman list in 2005 and 2006, placing at 63 and 81 those years, respectively. The US version of FHM ranked her in its US&#x27;s 100 Sexiest Woman list five times between its inaugural edition in 2000 and 2007, with peaks of number 7 in 2005 and number 10 in 2006. and she was on the cover of the magazine&#x27;s February 2005 edition. Hatcher also re-entered the FHM Australia&#x27;s Top 100 Sexiest Women list in 2005 and 2006 ranking 19 and 50 those years. She made similar lists in the German and Portuguese versions of FHM those years. Maxim Magazine placed her in its Top 100 listing of Sexiest Women of 2006 (a listing they began in 1999) at number 73.

As of April 2006, Hatcher was one of the highest paid television actresses in the United States, reportedly being paid $285,000 per episode of &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot;. That year she was one of the three nominees for Favorite Television Performer for the People&#x27;s Choice Awards and was again nominated for a Golden Globe as Lead Actress in a television comedy program. In May 2006, she released her first book, &quot;Burnt Toast: And Other Philosophies of Life&quot;.
Hatcher performed The Beatles song &quot;Good Night&quot; on the 2006 charity album &quot;Unexpected Dreams – Songs From the Stars&quot;.
On April 9, 2008, Hatcher appeared on &quot;Idol Gives Back&quot;, singing Carrie Underwood&#x27;s &quot;Before He Cheats&quot;. She voiced the Other Mother, a mysterious, button-eyed figure, as well as Coraline&#x27;s mother Mel Jones, who constantly shows Coraline &quot;tough love,&quot; both in the 2009 film &quot;Coraline&quot;, which received critical acclaim.

In 2010, Hatcher made a return to the Superman franchise, with a special guest role in the final season of &quot;Smallville&quot; as Ella Lane, the mother of Erica Durance&#x27;s Lois Lane. The episode continued a tradition of former Lois Lane actresses portraying the character&#x27;s mother many years later. Noel Neill appeared as Lois&#x27; mother in the 1978 film &quot;Superman: The Movie&quot;, and Phyllis Coates made a similar appearance on &quot;Lois &amp; Clark&quot;.
A report in November 2010 suggested that Hatcher, along with co-star Felicity Huffman, would be quitting &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot;, but ABC denied the claim. Hatcher later addressed the rumors of her departure from &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot;, saying that &quot;[t]here are not enough adjectives to describe how stupid, off base, and ridiculously untrue this is&quot;. However, after the show concluded in 2012, media sources revealed an apparent rift with her co-stars. It has been widely speculated that the cast did not get along well with Hatcher. Eva Longoria, Felicity Huffman, Marcia Cross, and Vanessa Williams gave thank-you gifts to the crew from the show which included a message with their names inscribed at the end, and Hatcher&#x27;s name was distinctly absent. &quot;TV Guide&quot; source, William Keck, revealed that &quot;something went down&quot; between Hatcher and the cast that caused a rift, and also observed how Hatcher would physically distance herself from the others during breaks in filming. On her end, Hatcher said to TV Guide that &quot;I will never disclose the true and complicated journey of us all, but I wish everyone on the show well.&quot;

In 2011, &quot;Men&#x27;s Health&quot; magazine named Hatcher #38 on their &quot;Hottest Women of All Time&quot; list.

===2013–present: Post-&quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; work===
Hatcher voiced Dottie in the films &quot;Planes&quot; (2013) and &quot;&quot; (2014). In 2016, Hatcher had a recurring role as Charlotte, a successful single mother who becomes Oscar&#x27;s (Matthew Perry) love interest in the second season of the comedy series &quot; The Odd Couple&quot;. In 2017, Hatcher appeared as Queen Rhea of Daxam in a recurring role on The CW series &quot;Supergirl&quot;.

In 2018, Hatcher debuted a YouTube channel called Hatching Change. After 132 segments, it ceased updating in 2022. Hatcher, an enthusiastic baker who took cooking lessons, won the Food Network celebrity episode of &quot;Chopped&quot;. She also won the &quot;Stand Up to Cancer&quot; episode of &quot;The Great British Bake Off&quot; episode in 2018. Teri Hatcher narrated the &quot;Hidden Worlds: The Films of LAIKA&quot; exhibit at the Museum of Pop Culture in Seattle.

In 2024, Hatcher portrayed Ruth Finley in the Lifetime film &quot;The Killer Inside: The Ruth Finley Story&quot;.

==Personal life==

Hatcher married Marcus Leithold, of Butler, Pennsylvania, on June 4, 1988; they divorced the following year. On May 27, 1994, she married actor Jon Tenney; they had a daughter, Emerson, born in 1997. They divorced in March 2003.

<text>The Great Belt (, ) is a strait between the major islands of Zealand (&quot;Sjælland&quot;) and Funen (&quot;Fyn&quot;) in Denmark. It is one of the three Danish Straits.

Effectively dividing Denmark in two, the Belt was served by the Great Belt ferries from the late 19th century until the islands were connected by the Great Belt Fixed Link in 1997–98.

==Geography==

The Great Belt is the largest and most important of the three Danish Straits that connect the Baltic Sea to the Kattegat strait and Atlantic Ocean. The others are the Øresund and the Little Belt straits.

The Great Belt is long and wide. It flows around two major islands: Samsø in the north and Langeland to the south. At Sprogø the Great Belt divides into the East Channel and the West Channel. Both are traversed by the Great Belt Fixed Link, but a tunnel also runs under the East Channel.

==Geology==
In pre-glacial times a river, which the Baltic Sea basin then contained and which geologists call the Eridanos, must have passed near the region as the rise of South Swedish Dome in Neogene times diverted it south from its previous path across central Sweden.

The Great Belt originated as Dana River that was eroded into existence 9000–8900 years ago when post-glacial rebound made the Ancylus Lake that occupied the Baltic depression lose its outlets around Gothenburg tipping over in the south. The forming of the Dana River is thought to have caused a dramatic erosion of sediments, peatlands and forests along its way. This led initially to a relatively rapid fall in the lake level over hundreds of years to then continue falling at a lower pace. Rising sea levels allowed the sea to break through the Dana River forming the Great Belt as a proper seaway. In the processes the Ancylus Lake became the Littorina Sea as salt water entered the Baltic depression.

==Biology==
The Great Belt is home to some popular fish: flatfish, sea trout, Atlantic cod, Atlantic mackerel and garfish, which are fished avidly for sport and for sale. A large and rising population of harbour porpoises lives in the Belts.

==International waterway==
The Great Belt was historically navigable to ocean-going vessels. It still is used, despite a few collisions and near collisions with the Great Belt Bridge. The Danish navy monitors maritime traffic in the waters around the Great Belt.

In the reign of king Eric of Pomerania the Danish government began to receive a large part of its income from the so-called &#x27;Sound Dues&#x27; toll on international merchant ships passing through the Øresund. Non-Danish vessels were restricted to the Øresund channel. Merchants paid the tax under threat of having their vessels sunk or confiscated.

During the middle of the 19th century, this practice became a diplomatic liability and the Danish government agreed to terminate it, achieving an international financial compensation in return. Danish waterways were consequently opened to foreign shipping. The eastern half of the Great Belt is an international waterway, legally based on the 1857 Copenhagen Convention. The western half of the Great Belt (between Funen and Sprogø) and all other parts of the Danish straits are Danish territorial waters and subject to Danish jurisdiction.

In 1991, Finland instituted proceedings before the International Court of Justice against Denmark, which was planning to build a fixed traffic connection over the Great Belt (later Great Belt Fixed Link), including a bridge that Finland alleged would prevent the passage of certain ships to and from Finland: Finnish-built mobile offshore drilling units would be unable to pass beneath the bridge. The case was discontinued in 1992, before the Court had to rule on the merits, because Finland and Denmark reached a negotiated settlement. The two countries negotiated a financial compensation of 90 million Danish kroner, and Finland withdrew the lawsuit.

On 4 April 2024, the Danish Maritime Authority ordered the closure of an area of the strait south-west of Korsør to shipping and aviation after a missile launcher aboard HDMS &quot;Niels Juel&quot; malfunctioned during a naval exercise.

<text>The swallows, martins, and saw-wings, or Hirundinidae are a family of passerine songbirds found around the world on all continents, including occasionally in Antarctica. Highly adapted to aerial feeding, they have a distinctive appearance. The term &quot;swallow&quot; is used as the common name for &quot;Hirundo rustica&quot; in the UK and Ireland. Around 90 species of Hirundinidae are known, divided into 21 genera, with the greatest diversity found in Africa, which is also thought to be where they evolved as hole-nesters. They also occur on a number of oceanic islands. A number of European and North American species are long-distance migrants; by contrast, the West and South African swallows are nonmigratory.

This family comprises two subfamilies: [[Pseudochelidoninae]] (the river martins of the genus &quot;Pseudochelidon&quot;) and Hirundininae (all other swallows, martins, and saw-wings). In the Old World, the name &quot;martin&quot; tends to be used for the squarer-tailed species, and the name &quot;swallow&quot; for the more fork-tailed species; however, this distinction does not represent a real evolutionary separation. In the New World, &quot;martin&quot; is reserved for members of the genus &quot;Progne&quot;. (These two systems are responsible for the same species being called sand martin in the Old World and bank swallow in the New World.)

==Taxonomy and systematics==
The family Hirundinidae was introduced (as Hirundia) by the French polymath Constantine Samuel Rafinesque in 1815. The Hirundinidae are morphologically unique within the passerines, with molecular evidence placing them as a distinctive lineage within the Sylvioidea (Old World warblers and relatives). Phylogenetic analysis has shown that the family Hirundinidae is sister to the cupwings in the family Pnoepygidae. The two families diverged in the early Miocene around 22 million years ago.

Within the family, a clear division exists between the two subfamilies, the Pseudochelidoninae, which are composed of the two species of river martins, and the Hirundininae, into which the remaining species are placed. The division of the Hirundininae has been the source of much discussion, with various taxonomists variously splitting them into as many as 24 genera and lumping them into just 12. Some agreement exists that three core groups occur within the Hirundininae: the saw-wings of the genus &quot;Psalidoprocne&quot;, the core martins, and the swallows of the genus &quot;Hirundo&quot; and their allies. The saw-wings are the most basal of the three, with the other two clades being sister to each other. The phylogeny of the swallows is closely related to evolution of nest construction; the more basal saw-wings use burrows as nest, the core martins have both burrowing (in the Old World members) and cavity adoption (in New World members) as strategies, and the genus &quot;Hirundo&quot; and its allies use mud nests.

The genus level cladogram shown below is based on a molecular phylogenetic study by Drew Schield and collaborators that was published in 2024. The choice of genera and the number of species is taken from the list of birds maintained by Frank Gill, Pamela C. Rasmussen and David Donsker on behalf of the International Ornithological Committee (IOC).
=== Fossil record ===
The oldest known fossil swallow is &quot;Miochelidon eschata&quot; from the Early Miocene of Siberia; it is the only record of Hirundinidae from the Miocene. It is likely a basal member of the family.

== Description ==
The Hirundinidae have an evolutionarily conservative body shape, which is similar across the clade, but is unlike that of other passerines. Swallows have adapted to hunting insects on the wing by developing a slender, streamlined body and long, pointed wings, which allow great maneuverability and endurance, as well as frequent periods of gliding. Their body shapes allow for very efficient flight; the metabolic rate of swallows in flight is 49–72% lower than equivalent passerines of the same size.
Swallows have two in each eye, giving them sharp lateral and frontal vision to help track prey. They also have relatively long eyes, with their length almost equaling their width. The long eyes allow for an increase in visual acuity without competing with the brain for space inside of the head. The morphology of the eye in swallows is similar to that of a raptor.

Like the unrelated swifts and nightjars, which hunt in a similar way, they have short bills, but strong jaws and a wide gape. Their body lengths range from about and their weight from about . The smallest species by weight may be the Fanti sawwing, at a mean body mass of while the purple martin and southern martin, which both weigh in excess of on average, rival one another as the heaviest swallows. The wings are long, pointed, and have nine primary feathers. The tail has 12 feathers and may be deeply forked, somewhat indented, or square-ended. A long tail increases maneuverability, and may also function as a sexual adornment, since the tail is frequently longer in males. In barn swallows, the tail of the male is 18% longer than those of the female, and females select mates on the basis of tail length.

Their legs are short, and their feet are adapted for perching rather than walking, as the front toes are partially joined at the base. Swallows are capable of walking and even running, but they do so with a shuffling, waddling gait. The leg muscles of the river martins (&quot;Pseudochelidon&quot;) are stronger and more robust than those of other swallows. The river martins have other characteristics that separate them from the other swallows. The structure of the syrinx is substantially different between the two subfamilies; and in most swallows, the bill, legs, and feet are dark brown or black, but in the river martins, the bill is orange-red and the legs and feet are pink.

The most common plumage is glossy dark blue or green above and plain or streaked underparts, often white or rufous. Species that burrow or live in dry or mountainous areas are often matte brown above (e.g. sand martin and crag martin). The sexes show limited or no sexual dimorphism, with longer outer tail feathers in the adult male probably being the most common distinction.

The chicks hatch naked and with closed eyes. Fledged juveniles usually appear as duller versions of the adult.

==Distribution and habitat==
The family has a worldwide cosmopolitan distribution, breeding on every continent except Antarctica. One species, the Pacific swallow, occurs as a breeding bird on a number of oceanic islands in the Pacific Ocean, the Mascarene martin breeds on Reunion and Mauritius in the Indian Ocean, and a number of migratory species are common vagrants to other isolated islands and even to some sub-Antarctic islands and Antarctica. Many species have enormous worldwide ranges, particularly the barn swallow, which breeds over most of the Northern Hemisphere and winters over most of the Southern Hemisphere.
The family uses a wide range of habitats. They are dependent on flying insects, and as these are common over waterways and lakes, they frequently feed over these, but they can be found in any open habitat, including grasslands, open woodland, savanna, marshes, mangroves, and scrubland, from sea level to high alpine areas. Many species inhabit human-altered landscapes, including agricultural land and even urban areas. Land-use changes have also caused some species to expand their range, most impressively the welcome swallow, which began to colonise New Zealand in the 1920s, started breeding in the 1950s, and is now a common landbird there.

Species breeding in temperate regions migrate during the winter when their insect prey populations collapse. Species breeding in more tropical areas are often more sedentary, although several tropical species are partial migrants or make shorter migrations. In antiquity, swallows were thought to have hibernated in a state of torpor, or even that they withdrew for the winter under water. Aristotle ascribed hibernation not only to swallows, but also to storks and kites. Hibernation of swallows was considered a possibility even by as acute an observer as Rev. Gilbert White, in his &quot;The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne&quot; (1789, based on decades of observations). This idea may have been supported by the habit of some species to roost in some numbers in dovecotes, nests and other forms of shelter during harsh weather, and some species even entering torpor. There were several reports of suspected torpor in swallows from 1947, such as a 1970 report that white-backed swallows in Australia may conserve energy this way, but the first confirmed study that they or any passerine entered torpor was a 1988 study on house martins.

==Behaviour and ecology==
Swallows are excellent flyers and use these skills to feed and attract mates. Some species, such as the mangrove swallow, are territorial, whereas others are not and simply defend their nesting sites. In general, the male selects a nest site, and then attracts a female using song and flight and (dependent on the species) guards his territory. The size of the territory varies depending on the species of swallow; in colonial-nesting species, it tends to be small, but it may be much larger for solitary nesters. Outside the breeding season, some species may form large flocks, and species may also roost communally. This is thought to provide protection from predators, such as sparrowhawks and hobbies. These roosts can be enormous; one winter-roosting site of barn swallows in Nigeria attracted 1.5 million individuals. Nonsocial species do not form flocks, but recently fledged chicks may remain with their parents for a while after the breeding season. If a human being gets too close to their territory, swallows attack them within the perimeter of the nest. Colonial species may mob predators and humans that are too close to the colony.

===Diet and feeding===
For the most part, swallows are insectivorous, taking flying insects on the wing. Across the whole family, a wide range of insects is taken from most insect groups, but the composition of any one prey type in the diet varies by species and with the time of year. Individual species may be selective; they do not scoop up every insect around them, but instead select larger prey items than would be expected by random sampling. In addition, the ease of capture of different insect types affects their rate of predation by swallows. They also avoid certain prey types; in particular, stinging insects such as bees and wasps are generally avoided. In addition to insect prey, a number of species occasionally consume fruits and other plant matter. Species in Africa have been recorded eating the seeds of &quot;Acacia&quot; trees, and these are even fed to the young of the greater striped swallow.

The swallows generally forage for prey on the wing, but they on occasion snap prey off branches or on the ground. The flight may be fast and involve a rapid succession of turns and banks when actively chasing fast-moving prey; less agile prey may be caught with a slower, more leisurely flight that includes flying in circles and bursts of flapping mixed with gliding. Where several species of swallows feed together, they separate into different niches based on height off the ground, some species feeding closer to the ground and others feeding at higher levels. Similar separation occurs where feeding overlaps with swifts. Niche separation may also occur with the size of prey chosen.

===Breeding===
The more primitive species nest in existing cavities, for example in an old woodpecker nest, while other species excavate burrows in soft substrate such as sand banks. Swallows in the genera &quot;Hirundo&quot;, &quot;Ptyonoprogne&quot;, &quot;Cecropis&quot;, &quot;Petrochelidon&quot;, &quot;Atronanus&quot; and &quot;Delichon&quot; build mud nests close to overhead shelter in locations that are protected from both the weather and predators. The mud-nesters are most common in the Old World, particularly Africa, whereas cavity-nesters are more common in the New World. Mud-nesting species in particular are limited in areas of high humidity, which causes the mud nests to crumble. Many cave-, bank-, and cliff-dwelling species of swallows nest in large colonies. Mud nests are constructed by both males and females, and amongst the tunnel diggers, the excavation duties are shared, as well. In historical times, the introduction of man-made stone structures such as barns and bridges, together with forest clearance, has led to an abundance of colony sites around the globe, significantly increasing the breeding ranges of some species. Birds living in large colonies typically have to contend with both ectoparasites and conspecific nest parasitism. In barn swallows, old mated males and young unmated males benefit from colonial behaviour, whereas females and mated young males likely benefit more from nesting by themselves.

Pairs of mated swallows are monogamous, and pairs of nonmigratory species often stay near their breeding area all year, though the nest site is defended most vigorously during the breeding season. Migratory species often return to the same breeding area each year, and may select the same nest site if they were previously successful in that location. First-year breeders generally select a nesting site close to where they were raised. The breeding of temperate species is seasonal, whereas that of subtropical or tropical species can either be continuous throughout the year or seasonal. Seasonal species in the subtropics or tropics usually time their breeding to coincide with the peaks in insect activity, which is usually the wet season, but some species, such as the white-bibbed swallow, nest in the dry season to avoid flooding in their riverbank nesting habitat. All swallows defend their nests from egg predators, although solitary species are more aggressive towards predators than colonial species. Overall, the contribution of male swallows towards parental care is the highest of any passerine bird.
The eggs of swallows tend to be white, although those of some mud-nesters are speckled. The typical clutch size is around four to five eggs in temperate areas and two to three eggs in the tropics. The incubation duties are shared in some species, and in others the eggs are incubated solely by the females. Amongst the species where the males help with incubation, their contribution varies amongst species, with some species such as the cliff swallow sharing the duties equally and the female doing most of the work in others. Amongst the barn swallows, the male of the American subspecies helps (to a small extent), whereas the European subspecies does not. Even in species where the male does not incubate the eggs, he may sit on them when the female is away to reduce heat loss (this is different from incubation as that involves warming the eggs, not just stopping heat loss). Incubation stints last for 5–15 minutes and are followed by bursts of feeding activity. From laying, swallow eggs take 10–21 days to hatch, with 14–18 days being more typical.

The chicks of swallows hatch naked, generally with only a few tufts of down. The eyes are closed and do not fully open for up to 10 days. The feathers take a few days to begin to sprout, and the chicks are brooded by the parents until they are able to thermoregulate. On the whole, they develop slowly compared to other passerine birds. The parents do not usually feed the chicks individual insects, but instead feed a bolus of food comprising 10–100 insects. Regardless of whether the species has males that incubate or brood the chicks, the males of all hirundines help feed the chicks. When the young fledge is difficult to determine, as they are enticed out of the nest after three weeks by parents, but frequently return to the nest afterwards to roost.

===Calls===

Swallows are able to produce many different calls or songs, which are used to express excitement, to communicate with others of the same species, during courtship, or as an alarm when a predator is in the area. The songs of males are related to the body condition of the bird and are presumably used by females to judge the physical condition and suitability for mating of males. Begging calls are used by the young when soliciting food from their parents. The typical song of swallows is a simple, sometimes musical twittering.

==Status and conservation==

Species of hirundine that are threatened with extinction are generally endangered due to habitat loss. This is presumed to be the reason behind the decline of the critically endangered white-eyed river martin, a species that is only known from a few specimens collected in Thailand. The species presumably breeds in riverbanks, a much diminished habitat in Southeast Asia. As the species has not been reliably seen since 1980, it may already be extinct. Two insular species, the Bahama swallow and golden swallow, have declined due to forest loss and also competition with introduced species such as starlings and sparrows, which compete with these swallows for nesting sites. The golden swallow formerly bred on the island of Jamaica, but was last seen there in 1989 and is now restricted to the island of Hispaniola.

==Relationship with humans==

Swallows coexist well with humans because of their beneficial role as insect eaters, and some species have readily adapted to nesting in and around human habitation. The barn swallow and house martin now rarely use natural sites. The purple martin is also actively encouraged by people to nest around humans and elaborate nest boxes are erected. Enough artificial nesting sites have been created that the purple martin now seldom nests in natural cavities in the eastern part of its range.

Because of the long human experience with these conspicuous species, many myths and legends have arisen as a consequence, particularly relating to the barn swallow. Roman historian Pliny the Elder described a use of painted swallows to deliver a report of the winning horses at a race. There is also the Korean folktale of Heungbu and Nolbu, which teaches a moral lesson about greed and altruism through the mending of a swallow&#x27;s broken leg.

During the 19th century, Jean Desbouvrie attempted to tame swallows and train them for use as messenger birds, as an alternative to war pigeons. The swallows would have a light load of course, as a laden swallow could only travel about half as far as an unladen swallow in the same trip. He succeeded in curbing the migratory instinct in young birds and persuaded the government of France to conduct initial testing, but further experimentation stalled. Subsequent attempts to train homing behaviour into swallows and other passerines had difficulty establishing a statistically significant success rate, although the birds have been known to trap themselves in a cage repeatedly to get to the bait.

According to a sailing superstition, swallows are a good omen to those at sea. This probably arose from the fact that swallows are land-based birds, so their appearance informs a sailor that he or she is close to shore.
An old term of venery for swallows is a &quot;flight&quot; or &quot;sweep&quot;.

<text>Count Erik Jönsson Dahlbergh (10 October 1625 – 16 January 1703) was a Swedish military engineer, Governor-general and Field marshal. He rose to the level of nobility through his military competence. According to Cathal Nolan, Count Dahlberg was a highly innovative military engineer in the 17th and 18th century, often referred to as the &quot;Swedish Vauban&quot;. He was expert in both building and destroying fortifications. In warfare he won several sieges, including Copenhagen and Kronborg. He famously led a Swedish army across the frozen Great and Little Belts to attack Copenhagen. Dahlberg commanded Swedish engineers in several wars and his historic influence was ensured via his skill at map-making, the fortresses he designed, and his widely read writings on military architecture. Today he is well known through his &quot;Suecia Antiqua et Hodierna&quot;, a collection of engravings of topographical research.

== Biography ==

Erik Dahlbergh was born in Stockholm, Sweden. His early studies involved the science of fortification. Orphaned at an early age, Dahlbergh&#x27;s studies qualified him as a scribe and in 1641 he found employment in Hamburg with Gerdt Rehnskiöld (1610−1658), senior accountant for Pommern and Mecklenburg. Over a six year period, he was taught the fundamentals in draughtsmanship. While learning these skills, he also studied mathematics, architecture, perspective and map drawing.

He saw service as an engineer officer during the latter years of the Thirty Years&#x27; War. In 1650, the military command dispatched Dahlbergh to Frankfurt to recoup war indemnity awarded to Sweden following the Treaty of Westphalia. Dahlbergh also contacted the publishing firm of Merian and provided topographical maps.

While studying art in Italy, news reached him of a coming war between Sweden and Poland-Lithuania and he saw the potential for a military career. In his military career, Dahlbergh saw service in Poland as adjutant-general and engineering adviser to Charles X of Sweden. He participated in March across the Belts and at the sieges of Copenhagen and Kronborg where he directed the engineers during the Northern Wars.

In spite of his distinguished service, Dahlbergh remained a lieutenant-colonel for many years. His talents were later recognized and in 1676, he became director-general of fortifications for the Swedish crown. As director, Dahlbergh rendered distinguished service over the next twenty-five years.

At Helsingborg in 1677, he was a key operative in the Great Northern War at Dunamünde, and in 1700 he was instrumental in the defense of the two sieges of Riga. His work in repairing the fortresses of his own country earned for him the title of the &quot;Vauban of Sweden&quot;. He was also the founder of the Swedish engineer corps. He retired while in the rank of field marshal in 1702 and died the following year.

== Legacy ==
In modern times, Erik Dahlbergh best known for compiling the collection of engravings called &quot;Suecia Antiqua et Hodierna&quot; published 1660–1716, and for assisting Samuel Pufendorf in his &quot;Histoire de Charles X Gustave&quot;. He also wrote a memoir of his life ( Svenska Bibliotek, 1757) and an account &quot;Of the campaigns of Charles X&quot; (ed. Lundblad, Stockholm, 1823).

<doc id="210336" wikidata="Q4944109" url="?curid=210336" title="Booty bass">
<text>The term booty bass can refer to several different, loosely related genres of music:

*Miami bass – largely based in Miami, but also found throughout Florida and elsewhere in the south. It is essentially the second form of hip hop to come into existence, but was relatively unknown until the 1990s, when the music had become stigmatized because of its explicit lyrics; notable acts include 2 Live Crew
*Ghetto house – refers to later period Dance
Mania Records recording artists. This is a brand of new school house music performers who loop often X-rated lyrics over house beats. Chicago ghetto house and Juke Music have started becoming very popular in other parts of the world.

*Baltimore club – Also known as Baltimore breaks, this genre is popular mostly in Maryland, and sounds somewhat similar to Chicago ghetto house, with the exception of being based on breakbeats instead of house music. The tempos are far faster than either genre, and it maintains the repetitive nature of modern post-rave global electronic dance music.
*Hyphy – emerged out of the San Francisco Bay Area, particularly Oakland, and draw from genres like G-funk and Crunk. It is characterized by a heavy bass line and high energy.</text><links>

<doc id="210337" wikidata="Q211008" url="?curid=210337" title="Little Belt">
<text>The Little Belt (, ) is a strait between the island of Funen and the Jutland Peninsula in Denmark. It is one of the three Danish Straits that drain and connect the Baltic Sea to the Kattegat strait, which drains west to the North Sea and Atlantic Ocean.

==Geography==

The Little Belt is about long and to wide, and its deepest point is at Marens Hul west of the island of Fænø, at , which makes it deeper than its sister strait, the Great Belt. Numerous small Danish islands lie within the belt. In part because of its depth, 10% of the water moving between the inner Baltic Sea and the Kattegat flows through the Little Belt.

The Little Belt stretches from the town of Juelsminde in the north to the island of Als in the south, with a winding course in between. The northern end is the widest at over . From there it runs southwest, narrowing to about at a place called &quot;Snævringen&quot; (The Narrows), where the two Little Belt Bridges are located. South of Fænø, the strait widens to about until it reaches the Baltic Sea near Als and the South Funen Archipelago.

The Little Belt&#x27;s western coastline is largely broken up by irregular inlets called fjords, and both sides feature steep sand bluffs.

== Geology ==
The area around the Little Belt is shaped by numerous glacial moraines, the first of which was formed during the early Weichsel glaciation approximately 22-25,000 years ago. Approximately 14-15,000 years ago, during the late Weichsel glaciation, ice arrived from the south and southeast, one part of which became the Little Belt Glacier, causing hilly terrain with deep fjords. The notable tunnel valleys were formed by meltwater. The terminal moraines from the northeast ice&#x27;s glacial maximum are some of the oldest in Denmark.

== Nature ==

The Little Belt is a protected wetland under the Ramsar Convention and a particularly important spot for breeding and migrating birds. Protected species in the area include whooper swans, white-tailed eagles, western marsh harriers, spotted crakes, corn crakes, pied avocets, ruffs, short-eared owls, common terns, Arctic terns, little terns, greater scaups, common eiders, common goldeneyes, and red-breasted mergansers.

The Little Belt has the highest known density of harbour porpoises in the world, and is home to several thousand individuals. It is the only resident cetacean in the inner Danish waters. Observation tours are accessible nearby as well. Other species such as minke, humpback, and fin whales visit the waters rather sporadically. The deep waters attract many species of fish, including cod, herring, and sea trout, and the Little Belt is a destination for recreational fishing.

==History==

=== Prehistoric settlements ===
Human populations lived around the Little Belt during the Stone Age, hunting aurochs, reindeer, and other game in the tunnel valleys and forests. Climate and geological changes brought new plants and animals to the area and made the fishery in the fjords and neighboring archipelagoes into an important food source. Around 4000 BC, temperatures rose again, and the Funnelbeaker culture was active in the area. There are many archaeological sites from the Funnelbeaker culture and other Neolithic cultures in the area.

Throughout the Bronze Age, Iron Age, and Viking Age, trade with other populations increased, and settlements became larger and more permanent. In the 14th century, the towns of Kolding and Vejle received merchant town privileges, and today they are the area&#x27;s two largest towns.

===Porpoise hunting===

From the Middle Ages until the end of the 19th century, local fishermen were also involved in harbour porpoise hunting. Harbor porpoises winter in Danish waterways, and fishermen would wait in the narrow parts of the belt and drive them to the shallows where they would be slaughtered. Porpoise oil, a type of whale oil, was in widespread use as a lamp oil until the spread of electric lighting undermined the porpoise hunting economy. In the winter of 1854-55, 1,742 porpoises were captured, but otherwise, the catch from most winters was around 700-800 porpoises. Porpoise hunting was regulated by laws dating to at least 1593. The law was overturned by a royal resolution on May 4, 1899, although shortages during World War I and II caused short-lived resurgences in porpoise hunting.

===Modern era===

In 1801 the Danish Navy launched a 22-gun warship named &quot;Lillebælt&quot; for the strait. After the 1807 Battle of Copenhagen she was surrendered to the British Royal Navy, where her name was anglicized to &quot;HMS Little Belt&quot;, and she took part in the then notorious &quot;Little Belt&quot; affair in North American waters. Later the Royal Navy bestowed the name &quot;Little Belt&quot; on another ship, which had no Danish antecedents.

19th century proponents of German unification advocated considering the Little Belt (German: &quot;Kleiner Belt&quot;) as the northern border of Germany, and the Belt is mentioned in this context in Ernst Mortiz Arndt&#x27;s &quot;Was ist des Deutschen Vaterland?&quot; (1813) and the &quot;Deutschlandlied&quot; (1841), the third stanza of which is the current German national anthem. This reflects the fact that the Denmark-Germany border has shifted several times over the centuries, so that the current Danish region of Southern Jutland was once part of the Duchy of Schleswig.

The Little Belt has historically been an important shipping channel. In the present day, it is popular among divers for its archaeological sites and shipwrecks.

== Infrastructure ==
Various ferry services have crossed the Little Belt over the years, including the Snoghøj-Middelfart ferry, followed by the Fredericia-Strib ferry, which became Denmark&#x27;s first train ferry in 1872. Ferry crossings were replaced by the Old Little Belt Bridge in 1935 and the New Little Belt Bridge in 1970. Today, the old bridge carries local traffic and train lines, while the new bridge carries the E20 motorway.

Two power lines also previously crossed the Little Belt, the first of which was dismantled and replaced by an undersea cable in 2013.

<text>Miami bass (also known as booty music or booty bass) is a subgenre of hip hop music that became popular in the 1980s and 1990s. The use of drums from the Roland TR-808, sustained kick drum, heavy bass, raised dance tempos, and frequently sexually explicit lyrical content differentiate it from other hip hop subgenres. Music author Richie Unterberger has characterized Miami bass as using rhythms with a &quot;stop-start flavor&quot; and &quot;hissy&quot; cymbals with lyrics that &quot;reflected the language of the streets, particularly Miami&#x27;s historically black neighborhoods such as Liberty City, Goulds, and Overtown&quot;.

Despite Miami bass never having consistent mainstream acceptance, early national media attention in the 1980s resulted in a profound impact on the development of hip hop, dance music, and pop.

==History==

===1980s origins===

During the 1980s, the focus of Miami bass tended to be on DJs and record producers, rather than individual performers. Record labels such as Pandisc, HOT Records, 4-Sight Records and Skyywalker Records released much material of the genre. Unterberger has referred to James (Maggotron) McCauley (also known as DXJ, Maggozulu Too, Planet Detroit and Bass Master Khan) as the &quot;father of Miami bass&quot;, a distinction McCauley denies, choosing to confer that status on producer Amos Larkins.

DJ Kurtis Mantronik (Mantronix) was a key influence on Miami bass. In particular, Mantronik&#x27;s single &quot;Bass Machine&quot; (1986), featuring rap vocals by T La Rock, was pivotal to the development of Miami bass.

MC ADE&#x27;s &quot;Bass Rock Express&quot;, with music and beats produced by Amos Larkins, is often credited as being the first Miami bass record to gain underground popularity on an international scale.

The single &quot;Throw The D&quot; by the group 2 Live Crew in 1986 gave a permanent blueprint to how future Miami bass songs were written and produced.

===Popularity===
2 Live Crew (Christopher Wong &quot;Fresh Kid Ice&quot; Won, Luther &quot;Luke Skyywalker&quot; Campbell and David &quot;Mr. Mixx&quot; Hobbs) played a key role in popularizing Miami bass in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The group&#x27;s 1986 release, &quot;The 2 Live Crew Is What We Are&quot;, became controversial for its sexually explicit lyrics. 1989&#x27;s &quot;As Nasty As They Wanna Be&quot;, along with its hit single &quot;Me So Horny&quot;, proved more controversial still, leading to legal troubles for both 2 Live Crew and retailers selling the album. All charges were eventually overturned on appeal.

For the better part of the mid-&#x27;80s and early &#x27;90s, DJs such as Luke Skyywalker&#x27;s Ghetto Style DJs, Norberto Morales&#x27; Triple M DJs, Super JD&#x27;s MHF DJs, Space Funk DJs, Mohamed Moretta, DJ Nice &amp; Nasty, Felix Sama, DJ Spin, Ramon Hernandez, Bass Master DJs, DJ Laz, Earl &quot;The Pearl&quot; Little, Uncle Al, Ser MC, Raylo &amp; Dem Damn Dogs, DJ Slice, K-Bass, Jam Pony Express and others were heavily involved in playing Miami bass at local outdoor events to large audiences at area beaches, parks, and fairs.

Clubs in South Florida, including Pac-Jam, Superstars Rollertheque, Bass Station, Studio 183, Randolphs, Nepenthe, Video Powerhouse, Skylight Express, Beat Club and Club Boca, were hosting bass nights on a regular basis. Miami radio airplay and programming support was strong in the now defunct Rhythm 98, as well as WEDR and WPOW (Power 96).

Contribution and promotion of Miami bass also came out of Orlando. 102 Jamz (WJHM), a prominent Orlando radio station in the late &#x27;80s, featured Miami bass and helped its popularity rise in and around Central Florida.

Florida breaks was heavily influenced by Miami bass in addition to elements of house, and deep bass that eventually created &quot;The Orlando Sound&quot;. Thus, Miami bass quickly became a Florida staple.

===1990s===
By the mid-1990s, the influence of Miami bass had spread outside South and Central Florida to all areas of Florida and the Southern United States. In the mid-1990s, it saw a commercial and mainstream resurgence, with Miami bass influenced artists such as L&#x27;Trimm, 95 South, Tag Team, 69 Boyz, Quad City DJ&#x27;s and Freak Nasty all scoring big Miami bass hits. Examples of these songs are &quot;Whoomp! (There It Is)&quot; by Tag Team in 1993, &quot;Tootsee Roll&quot; by 69 Boyz in 1994, &quot;C&#x27;mon N&#x27; Ride It (The Train)&quot; by the Quad City DJ&#x27;s in 1996 and &quot;Whoot, There It Is&quot; by 95 South in 1993.

These songs all reached the top 20 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart and exposed Miami bass nationally. These artists generally used a Miami bass sound and production but did it in a far less explicit and far more accessible way than had been previously done by Campbell and the 2 Live Crew.

Miami bass is closely related to the electronic dance music genres of ghettotech and booty house, genres which combine Detroit techno and Chicago house with the Miami bass sound. Ghettotech follows the same sexually oriented lyrics, hip-hop bass lines and streetwise attitude, but with harder, uptempo Roland TR-909 techno-style kick beats. In 2007, contemporary hip-hop and R&amp;B songs became more dance oriented, showing influences of Miami bass and techno, and are typically sped up to a &quot;chipmunk&quot; sound for faster tempos for dances such as juking, wu-tanging and bopping, usually only done in Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach Counties in south Florida.

===Subgenres===

Miami bass has been influenced by the cultural history of its wide-ranging community with the evolution of Cuban, Dominican, and Afro-Brazilian-fused sub-genres that include Baltimore club and funk carioca.

Another subgenre of Miami bass is &quot;car audio bass&quot;, which features an even more stripped down bass-heavy sound, tending to focus on either extremely hard 909 kicks combined with sine waves or the classic 808 kick, or sometimes simply the sine wave by itself. Some artist examples would be DJ Laz, DJ Magic Mike, Afro-Rican (as Power Supply), Techmaster P.E.B., DJ Billy E, Bass 305 and Bass Patrol.

== Stylistic differences ==

=== In African music ===

Gqom, an African electronic dance genre that originated in Durban, South Africa, in the early 2010s, is sometimes conflated with Miami bass due to perceived similarities between Durban&#x27;s cityscape and Miami&#x27;s South and North Beach areas as well as car culture, with enhanced car sound systems, with an emphasis on bass. However, gqom and miami bass are distinct in their origins and their production styles.

<text>Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi (; ; 10 December 1804 – 18 February 1851) was a German mathematician who made fundamental contributions to elliptic functions, dynamics, differential equations, determinants and number theory.

== Biography ==
Jacobi was born of Ashkenazi Jewish parentage in Potsdam on 10 December 1804. He was the second of four children of a banker, Simon Jacobi. His elder brother, Moritz, would also become known later as an engineer and physicist. He was initially home schooled by his uncle Lehman, who instructed him in the classical languages and elements of mathematics. In 1816, the twelve-year-old Jacobi went to the Potsdam Gymnasium, where students were taught all the standard subjects: classical languages, history, philology, mathematics, sciences, etc. As a result of the good education he had received from his uncle, as well as his own remarkable abilities, after less than half a year Jacobi was moved to the senior year despite his young age. However, as the University would not accept students younger than 16 years old, he had to remain in the senior class until 1821. He used this time to advance his knowledge, showing interest in all subjects, including Latin, Greek, philology, history and mathematics. During this period he also made his first attempts at research, trying to solve the quintic equation by radicals.

In 1821 Jacobi went to study at Berlin University, where he initially divided his attention between his passions for philology and mathematics. In philology, he participated in the seminars of Böckh, drawing the professor&#x27;s attention with his talent. Jacobi did not follow a lot of mathematics classes at the time, finding the level of mathematics taught at Berlin University too elementary. He continued, instead, with his private study of the more advanced works of Euler, Lagrange and Laplace. By 1823 he understood that he needed to make a decision between his competing interests and chose to devote all his attention to mathematics. In the same year he became qualified to teach secondary school and was offered a position at the Joachimsthal Gymnasium in Berlin. Jacobi decided instead to continue to work towards a university position. In 1825, he obtained the degree of Doctor of Philosophy with a dissertation on the partial fraction decomposition of rational fractions defended before a commission led by Enno Dirksen. He followed immediately with his habilitation and at the same time converted to Christianity. Now qualifying for teaching university classes, the 21-year-old Jacobi lectured in 1825/26 on the theory of curves and surfaces at the University of Berlin.

In 1826, Jacobi became a private lecturer, in the next year an extraodinary professor, and in finally 1829, a tenured professor of mathematics at Königsberg University, and held the chair until 1842.
He suffered a breakdown from overwork in 1843. He then visited Italy for a few months to regain his health. On his return he moved to Berlin, where he lived as a royal pensioner, apart from a very brief interim, until his death. During the Revolution of 1848 Jacobi was politically involved and unsuccessfully presented his parliamentary candidature on behalf of a Liberal club. This led, after the suppression of the revolution, to his royal grant being cut off – but his fame and reputation were such that it was soon resumed, thanks to the personal intervention of Alexander von Humboldt.

Jacobi died in 1851 from a smallpox infection. His grave is preserved at a cemetery in the Kreuzberg section of Berlin, the Friedhof I der Dreifaltigkeits-Kirchengemeinde (61 Baruther Street). His grave is close to that of Johann Encke, the astronomer. The crater Jacobi on the Moon is named after him.

== Scientific contributions ==
One of Jacobi&#x27;s greatest accomplishments was his theory of elliptic functions and their relation to the elliptic theta function. This was developed in his great treatise &quot;Fundamenta nova theoriae functionum ellipticarum&quot; (1829), and in later papers in Crelle&#x27;s Journal. Theta functions are of great importance in mathematical physics because of their role in the inverse problem for periodic and quasi-periodic flows. The equations of motion are integrable in terms of Jacobi&#x27;s elliptic functions in the well-known cases of the pendulum, the Euler top, the symmetric Lagrange top in a gravitational field, and the Kepler problem (planetary motion in a central gravitational field).

He also made fundamental contributions in the study of differential equations and to classical mechanics, notably the Hamilton–Jacobi theory.

It was in algebraic development that Jacobi&#x27;s particular power mainly lay, and he made important contributions of this kind in many areas of mathematics, as shown by his long list of papers in Crelle&#x27;s Journal and elsewhere from 1826 onwards. He is said to have told his students that when looking for a research topic, one should &#x27;Invert, always invert&#x27; (German original: &quot;man muss immer umkehren&quot;), reflecting his belief that inverting known results can open up new fields for research, for example inverting elliptic integrals and focusing on the nature of elliptic and theta functions.

In his 1835 paper, Jacobi proved the following basic result classifying periodic (including elliptic) functions:
He discovered many of the fundamental properties of theta functions, including the functional equation and the Jacobi triple product formula, as well as many other results on q-series and hypergeometric series.

The solution of the Jacobi inversion problem for the hyperelliptic Abel map by Weierstrass in 1854 required the introduction of the hyperelliptic theta function and later the general Riemann theta function for algebraic curves of arbitrary genus. The complex torus associated to a genus formula_1 algebraic curve, obtained by quotienting formula_2 by the lattice of periods is referred to as the Jacobian variety. This method of inversion, and its subsequent extension by Weierstrass and Riemann to arbitrary algebraic curves, may be seen as a higher genus generalization of the relation between elliptic integrals and the Jacobi or Weierstrass elliptic functions.

Jacobi was the first to apply elliptic functions to number theory, for example proving Fermat&#x27;s two-square theorem and Lagrange&#x27;s four-square theorem, and similar results for 6 and 8 squares.

His other work in number theory continued the work of Gauss: new proofs of quadratic reciprocity, and the introduction of the Jacobi symbol; contributions to higher reciprocity laws, investigations of continued fractions, and the invention of Jacobi sums.

He was also one of the early founders of the theory of determinants. In particular, he invented the Jacobian determinant formed from the &quot;n&quot;2 partial derivatives of &quot;n&quot; given functions of &quot;n&quot; independent variables, which plays an important part in changes of variables in multiple integrals, and in many analytical investigations. In 1841 he reintroduced the partial derivative ∂ notation of Legendre, which was to become standard.

He was one of the first to introduce and study the symmetric polynomials that are now known as Schur polynomials, giving the so-called bialternant formula for these, which is a special case of the Weyl character formula, and deriving the Jacobi–Trudi identities. He also discovered the Desnanot–Jacobi formula for determinants, which underlie the Plücker relations for Grassmannians.

Students of vector fields, Lie theory, Hamiltonian mechanics and operator algebras often encounter the Jacobi identity, the analog of associativity for the Lie bracket operation.

Planetary theory and other particular dynamical problems likewise occupied his attention from time to time. While contributing to celestial mechanics, he introduced the Jacobi integral (1836) for a sidereal coordinate system. His theory of the &quot;last multiplier&quot; is treated in &quot;Vorlesungen über Dynamik&quot;, edited by Alfred Clebsch (1866).

He left many manuscripts, portions of which have been published at intervals in Crelle&#x27;s Journal. His other works include &quot;Commentatio de transformatione integralis duplicis indefiniti in formam simpliciorem&quot; (1832), &quot;Canon arithmeticus&quot; (1839), and &quot;Opuscula mathematica&quot; (1846–1857). His &quot;Gesammelte Werke&quot; (1881–1891) were published by the Berlin Academy.

<text>Kryptobaatar, also known as Gobibaatar or Tugrigbaatar, is an extinct mammalian genus dating from the Upper Cretaceous Period and identified in Central Asia. This animal was a member of the extinct order of Multituberculata within the suborder Cimolodonta, and was a member of the family Djadochtatheriidae. It lived contemporaneously with some of the dinosaurs. Its skull had a length of perhaps 3 cm.

The generic name &quot;Kryptobaatar&quot; is derived from Greek : &quot;kruptós&quot;, &quot;hidden,&quot; (alludes to the ventral position of infraorbital foramen) and Mongolian : &quot;baatar&quot;, &quot;hero&quot; (alludes to the name of the capital of Mongolia, Ulan Baatar). The specific name &quot;dashzevegi&quot; is named in honour of Mongolian palaeontologist Demberelyin Dashzeveg. The derivation of its synonym &quot;Gobibaatar parvus&quot; is Gobi (occurring in the Gobi Desert, Mongolia) and baatar (&quot;a hero&quot;, the same as &quot;Kryptobaatar&quot;). Another synonym &quot;Tugrigbaatar saichanensis&quot; is a generic name derived from the Toogreeg and Ulan Baatar, and a specific name derived from a Gurvan Saykhan mountain range.

==Species identified==
* &quot;Kryptobaatar dashzevegi&quot; . At Djadokhta Formation, Ukhaa Tolgod, Tögrög Shiree and Bayan Zag or Baruungoyot Formation, Red beds of Hermiin Tsav, Mongolia. Stage: lower Campanian or Upper Cretaceous. The skull has a length of perhaps 3 cm. The front teeth look impressively sharp and not much like those of a strict vegetarian. &quot;Gobibaatar parvus&quot; and &quot;Tugrigbaatar saichanensis&quot; are now treated as synonyms of &quot;K. dashzevegi&quot; by Kielan-Jaworowska &quot;et al.&quot; (2003).
* &quot;Kryptobaatar mandahuensis&quot; . At Bayan Mandahu Formation, Urad Houqi Banner, Inner Mongolia, China. Based on several well-preserved skulls. This location is about the same stage as the Djadokhta Formation of Mongolia, Campanian (Upper Cretaceous).

==Biology==
&quot;Kryptobaatar&quot; was a hopping species, similar to a modern Jerboa. It is thought to have been a carnivory-oriented omnivore.

<text>William Prout FRS (; 15 January 1785 – 9 April 1850) was an English chemist, physician, and natural theologian. He is remembered today mainly for what is called Prout&#x27;s hypothesis.

==Biography==
Prout was born in Horton, Gloucestershire in 1785 and educated at 17 years of age by a clergyman, followed by the Redland Academy at Bristol and Edinburgh University, where he graduated in 1811 with an MD. His professional life was spent as a practising physician in London, but he also occupied himself with chemical research. He was an active worker in biological chemistry and carried out many analyses of the secretions of living organisms, which he believed were produced by the breakdown of bodily tissues. In 1823, he discovered that stomach juices contain hydrochloric acid, which can be separated from gastric juice by distillation. In 1827, he proposed the classification of substances in food into sugars and starches, oily bodies, and albumen, which would later become known as carbohydrates, fats, and proteins.

Prout is better remembered, however, for his researches into physical chemistry. In 1815, based on the tables of atomic weights available at the time, he anonymously hypothesized that the atomic weight of every element is an integer multiple of that of hydrogen, suggesting that the hydrogen atom is the only truly fundamental particle (which he called protyle), and that the atoms of the other elements are made of groupings of various numbers of hydrogen atoms. While Prout&#x27;s hypothesis was not borne out by later more-accurate measurements of atomic weights, it was a sufficiently fundamental insight into the structure of the atom that in 1920, Ernest Rutherford chose the name of the newly discovered proton to, among other reasons, give credit to Prout.

Prout contributed to the improvement of the barometer, and the Royal Society of London adopted his design as a national standard.

He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1819. He delivered the Goulstonian Lecture to the Royal College of Physicians in 1831 on the application of chemistry to medicine.

Prout wrote the eighth &quot;Bridgewater Treatise&quot;, &quot;Chemistry, Meteorology, and the Function of Digestion, considered with reference to Natural Theology&quot;. It was in this work that he coined the term &quot;convection&quot; to describe a type of energy transfer.

In 1814, Prout married Agnes Adam, daughter of Alexander Adam, of Edinburgh, Scotland, and together they had six children. Prout died in London in 1850 and was buried in Kensal Green Cemetery.

The &quot;Prout&quot; is a unit of nuclear binding energy, and is 1/12 the binding energy of the deuteron, or 185.5 keV. It is named after William Prout. &quot;Proutons&quot; was an early candidate for the name of what are now called protons.

<text>The Wairau Affray of 17 June 1843, also called the Wairau Massacre and the Wairau Incident, was the first serious clash of arms between British settlers and Māori in New Zealand after the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi and the only one to take place in the South Island. The incident was sparked when a magistrate and a representative of the New Zealand Company, who held a duplicitous deed to land in the Wairau Valley in Marlborough in the north of the South Island, led a group of European settlers to attempt to arrest Ngāti Toa chiefs Te Rauparaha and Te Rangihaeata. Fighting broke out and 22 British settlers were killed, nine after their surrender. Four Māori were killed, including Te Rongo, who was Te Rangihaeata&#x27;s wife.

The incident heightened fears among settlers of an armed Māori insurrection. It created the first major challenge for Governor Robert FitzRoy, who took up his posting in New Zealand six months later. FitzRoy investigated the incident and exonerated Te Rauparaha and Te Rangihaeata, for which he was strongly criticised by settlers and the New Zealand Company. In 1944 a land claims commission investigation determined that the Wairau Valley had not been legally sold. The government was to pay compensation to the Rangitāne iwi, determined to be the original owners (until the early 1830s, when Te Rauparaha had driven them from the area).

==Background==
The New Zealand Company established a settlement at Nelson in the north of the South Island in 1841. It had planned to occupy , but, even as allotments were being sold in England, the company&#x27;s agents in New Zealand were having difficulty in identifying available land to form the settlement, let alone buying it from local Māori.

Captain Arthur Wakefield had been dispatched by the New Zealand Company to lead the first group of settlers to Nelson. He was the younger brother of Edward Gibbon Wakefield, one of the principal officers of the company, and Colonel William Wakefield. Arthur wrote to Edward that he had located the required amount of land at Wairau. William Wakefield had bought a deed to the land in 1839 from Heni Te Huahua, a widow of whaling captain John William Dundas Blenkinsop. Blenkinsop had also been married to Te Rongo.

Arthur Wakefield wrote to the company in March 1843, &quot;I rather anticipate some difficulty with the natives.&quot; The source of the likely difficulty was simple: the chiefs Te Rauparaha and Te Rangihaeata, along with their kinsmen of Ngāti Toa, believed that they owned the land and had not been paid for it. They had controlled the area since the early 1830s, after they defeated the previous occupants, the Rangitāne iwi. Ngāti Toa believed that under British law they were the rightful owners and had not sold the land. They had asked for the surveying to stop until the investigation into the Blenkinsop Indenture (the deed) by Land Commissioner William Spain was concluded. 

In January 1843, Nohorua, the older brother of Te Rauparaha, led a delegation of chiefs to Nelson to protest about British activity in the Wairau Plains. Two months later Te Rauparaha and Te Rangihaeata arrived in Nelson, urging that the issue of the land ownership be left to William Spain. Based in Wellington, he had begun investigating all the claimed purchases of the New Zealand Company. Spain later wrote that during that visit, Arthur Wakefield &quot;wished to make them a payment for the Wairau, but they positively refused to sell it, and told him they would never consent to part from it.&quot; 

Arthur Wakefield rejected the request to wait for Spain&#x27;s enquiry, informing Te Rauparaha that if local Māori interfered with company surveyors on the land, he would lead 300 constables to arrest him. Wakefield duly despatched three parties of surveyors to the land. They were promptly warned off by local Māori, who damaged the surveyors&#x27; tools but left the men unharmed.

Te Rauparaha and Nohorua wrote to Spain on 12 May, urgently asking him to travel to the South Island to settle the company&#x27;s claim to Wairau. Spain replied that he would do so when his business in Wellington was complete. A month later, with still no sign of Spain, Te Rauparaha led a party to Wairau, where they destroyed all the surveyors&#x27; equipment and shelters that had been made with products of the land. They burned down roughly built thatched huts that contained surveying equipment. The surveyors were rounded up and sent unharmed back to Nelson.

== Confrontation ==
Bolstered by a report in the Nelson &quot;Examiner&quot; newspaper of &quot;Outrages by the Maori at Wairoo&quot;, Wakefield assembled a party of men, including Police Magistrate and Native Protector Henry Augustus Thompson, magistrate Captain R. England, Crown prosecutor and newspaper editor G.R. Richardson and about 50 men press-ganged into service, swearing them in as special constables. Thompson issued a warrant for the arrest of Te Rauparaha and Te Rangihaeata for arson. Wakefield referred to the chiefs in a letter as a pair of &quot;traveling bullies&quot;.

Thompson commandeered the government brig, which was in Nelson at the time. On the morning of 17 June the party, its size swelled to between 49 and 60 men, including chief surveyor Frederick Tuckett and others who had joined the party after landing, approached the Māori camp. The New Zealand Company&#x27;s storekeeper James Howard issued the British men with cutlasses, bayonets, pistols and muskets. At the path on the other side of a stream, Te Rauparaha stood surrounded by about 90 warriors, as well as by women and children. He allowed Thompson and five other men to approach him, but requested the rest of the British party to remain on their side of the stream.

Thompson refused to shake hands with Te Rauparaha and said that he had come to arrest him, not over the land issue but for burning the huts. Te Rauparaha replied that the huts had been made from rushes grown on his own land, and thus he had burnt his own property. Thompson insisted on arresting Te Rauparaha, produced a pair of handcuffs, and called out to the men on the far side of the stream, ordering them to fix bayonets and advance. As they began to cross, one of the British fired a shot (apparently by accident). Te Rangihaeata&#x27;s wife Te Rongo was killed in one of the first volleys, sparking gunfire from both sides. The British retreated across the stream, scrambling up the hill under fire from the Ngāti Toa. Several people from both sides were killed.

Te Rauparaha ordered the Ngāti Toa warriors to cross the stream in pursuit. Those British who had not escaped were quickly overtaken. Wakefield called for a ceasefire and surrendered, along with Thompson, Richardson and ten others. The Maori killed two of the British immediately. Te Rangihaeata demanded &quot;utu&quot; (revenge) for the death of his wife Te Rongo. The Maori killed all the remaining captives, including Thompson, Samuel Cottrell, a member of the original survey team; interpreter John Brooks, and Captain Wakefield. Four Māori died and three were wounded in the incident. The British lost 22 dead and five wounded. 

Te Rongo is sometimes stated to also be Te Rauparaha&#x27;s daughter but was probably his relation in a different way, she was a chief &#x27;in her own right&#x27; and Ngāti Mutunga on her father&#x27;s side. Her first husband was Captain John Blenkinsop, the man who created the deed that Wakefield purchased and that gave rise to the fighting.

Some survivors fled to Nelson to raise the alarm and a search party, including Wellington magistrates and a group of sailors, returned to Wairau and buried the bodies where they were found. Thirteen were put in one grave and the rest were buried in smaller groups.

Historian Michael Belgrave described the British attempt to survey the land as illegal, inopportune and ultimately disastrous.

==Aftermath==
Reverberations of a reported massacre were felt as far away as England, where the New Zealand Company was almost ruined by the news of &quot;British citizens being murdered by barbarous natives&quot;. Land sales almost halted, and it became obvious the company was being less than honest in its land purchasing tactics, and reports on the events in local newspapers were far from accurate.

In the Nelson area, settlers became increasingly nervous. One group sent a deputation to the Government complaining that those who had died had been discharging their &quot;duty as magistrates and British subjects ... the persons by whom they were killed are murderers in the eyes of common sense and justice&quot;.
In late January or early February 1844, a month after taking up his post, incoming Governor Robert FitzRoy visited Wellington and Nelson in a bid to quell the hostility between Māori and British, particularly in the wake of the Wairau Affray. So many conflicting statements had been published that it was impossible for him to decide who had been at fault. But he immediately upbraided New Zealand Company representatives and the editor of a Wellington newspaper, &quot;The New Zealand Gazette&quot;, for their aggressive attitude towards Māori, warning that he would ensure that &quot;not an acre, not an inch of land belonging to the natives shall be touched without their consent&quot;.

He also demanded the resignation of the surviving magistrates who had issued the arrest warrants for the Māori chiefs. &quot;&#x27;Arson,&#x27; said the Governor, &#x27;is burning another man&#x27;s house, it is not arson to burn your own house. The natives had never sold the Wairau, the hut which was burned was built on ground which belonged to the natives, and of materials which belonged to them also; consequently no arson was committed and therefore the warrant was illegal.&#x27;&quot;

From Nelson, FitzRoy and his officials sailed to Waikanae in the North Island, where he conducted a one-man inquiry into the incident. He opened proceedings by telling a meeting of 500 Māori: 
&quot;When I first heard of the Wairau massacre ... I was exceedingly angry ... My first thought was to revenge the deaths of my friends, and the other Pākehā who had been killed, and for that purpose to bring many ships of war ... with many soldiers; and had I done so, you would have been sacrificed and your pa destroyed. But when I considered, I saw that the Pakeha had in the first instance been very much to blame; and I determined to come down and inquire into all the circumstances and see who was really in the wrong.&quot;

Te Rauparaha, Te Rangihaeata and other Māori present were invited to recount their version of events, while FitzRoy took notes and interrupted with further questions. He concluded the meeting by addressing the gathering again, to announce he had made his decision: &quot;In the first place, the white men were in the wrong. They had no right to survey the land ... they had no right to build the houses on the land. As they were, then, first in the wrong, I will not avenge their deaths.&quot;

But FitzRoy, who had a background as a humanitarian, told the chiefs they had committed &quot;a horrible crime, in murdering men who had surrendered themselves in reliance on your honour as chiefs. White men never kill their prisoners&quot;. He urged British and Māori to live peaceably, with no more bloodshed.

Settlers and the New Zealand Company were incensed by the Governor&#x27;s finding, but it had been both prudent and pragmatic; Māori outnumbered settlers 900 to one. Many &quot;iwi&quot; had been amassing weapons for decades, giving them the capacity to annihilate settlements in the Wellington and Nelson areas. FitzRoy knew it was highly improbable that troops would be despatched by the British Government to wage war on the Māori or defend the settlers. FitzRoy&#x27;s report was endorsed by Colonial Secretary Lord Stanley, who said the actions of the party led by Thompson and Wakefield had been &quot;manifestly illegal, unjust and unwise&quot;, and that their deaths had occurred as a &quot;natural and immediate sequence&quot;. William Williams, a leading Church Missionary Society missionary, also clearly apportioned blame to &quot;our countrymen, who began with much indiscretion &amp; gave much provocation to the natives&quot;.

The effect of the massacre and the passive reaction of FitzRoy set in train a chain of events that still rumble through the New Zealand courts today. Its immediate effect was to alarm settlers in New Plymouth, who had insecure title to land purchased under similar circumstances to Wairau. FitzRoy was very unpopular and was recalled to be replaced by Governor George Grey.

After the massacre, Te Rauparaha was captured in 1846 for organising an uprising in the Hutt Valley and was imprisoned on in Auckland without charges being brought. Author Ranginui Walker has claimed the arrest was delayed punishment for the Wairau killings. The Ngāti Toa &quot;iwi&quot; sold the Wairau land while Te Rauparaha was held in captivity. After his release, Te Rauparaha returned to the Wairau Valley and was there during the 1848 earthquake.

This &quot;rohe&quot; (area) has been the subject of a lengthy but successful land/compensation claim by the original Rangitane iwi, which had been displaced in the 1820s by Te Rauparaha&#x27;s &quot;heke.&quot; The Rangitāne iwi are recognised as the &quot;tangata whenua&quot; (people of the land). In 1944 a government investigation established that the Wairau land had never been legally sold to the settlers. Compensation of some $2 million is to be paid by the government of New Zealand.

==Memorial==
In 1869 the Nelson community erected a memorial at Tuamarina Cemetery to commemorate the European casualties of the incident, with their names and the occupations listed on the inscription. The plaque had to be replaced shortly after when numerous spelling errors were discovered.

In 2008, Midler signed a contract with Caesars Palace in Las Vegas for a residency, &quot;Bette Midler: The Showgirl Must Go On&quot;, which ended in 2010. She starred in the Broadway revival of &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot;, which began previews in March 2017 and premiered at the Shubert Theatre in April 2017. The show was her first leading role in a Broadway musical. Midler received the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical for her performance.

==Early life==
Bette Midler was born in Honolulu, Hawaii, where her family was one of the few Jewish families in a mostly Asian neighborhood. Her mother, Ruth (née Schindel), was a seamstress and housewife, and her father, Fred Midler, worked at a U.S. Navy base in Hawaii as a painter, and also painted houses. Both parents were born in New Jersey. She was named after actress Bette Davis, although Davis pronounced her first name in two syllables (phonetically like &quot;Betty&quot;) and Midler uses one syllable (phonetically like &quot;bet&quot;). She was raised in Aiea and attended Radford High School in Honolulu. She was voted &quot;Most Talkative&quot; in the 1961 school Hoss Election, and &quot;Most Dramatic&quot; in her senior year (class of 1963). 

Midler majored in drama at the University of Hawaii at Manoa but left after three semesters. She performed as an extra in the 1966 film &quot;Hawaii&quot;, playing an uncredited seasick passenger named Miss David Buff.

Midler relocated to New York City in the summer of 1965, using money from her work in the film &quot;Hawaii&quot;. She studied theatre at HB Studio under Uta Hagen. She landed her first professional onstage role in Tom Eyen&#x27;s off-off-Broadway plays in 1965, &quot;Miss Nefertiti Regrets&quot; and &quot;Cinderella Revisited&quot;, a children&#x27;s play by day and an adult show by night. In October 1966, she joined the Broadway company of &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot;, playing the ensemble role of Rivka and understudying the oldest daughter Tzeitel. She assumed the role of Tzeitel in February 1967, and played the role until February 1970. After &quot;Fiddler&quot;, she joined the original cast of &quot;Salvation&quot; in 1969.

In the summer of 1970, Midler began singing at the Continental Baths, a gay bathhouse in the basement of the Ansonia Hotel. During this time, she became close to her piano accompanist, Barry Manilow—also a regular performer at the Continental Baths—who produced her first album in 1972, &quot;The Divine Miss M.&quot; It was during her time at the Continental Baths that she built up a core following. In the late 1990s, during the release of her album &quot;Bathhouse Betty&quot; (1998), Midler commented on her time performing there, &quot;Despite the way things turned out [with the AIDS crisis], I&#x27;m still proud of those days. I feel like I was at the forefront of the gay liberation movement, and I hope I did my part to help it move forward. So, I kind of wear the label of &#x27;Bathhouse Betty&#x27; with pride.&quot;

Midler starred in the first professional production of the Who&#x27;s rock opera &quot;Tommy&quot; in 1971, with director Richard Pearlman and the Seattle Opera. It was during the run of &quot;Tommy&quot; that Midler first appeared on &quot;The Tonight Show.&quot;

===1972–1980: &quot;The Divine Miss M&quot; and success===

Midler released her debut album, &quot;The Divine Miss M,&quot; on Atlantic Records in December 1972. The album was co-produced by Barry Manilow, who was Bette&#x27;s arranger and music conductor at the time. It reached Billboard&#x27;s Top 10 and became a million-selling Platinum-certified album, earning Midler the 1973 Grammy Award for Best New Artist. It featured three hit singles—&quot;Do You Wanna Dance?&quot;, &quot;Friends&quot;, and &quot;Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy&quot;—the third of which became Midler&#x27;s first No. 1 Adult Contemporary hit. &quot;Bugle Boy&quot; became a successful cover of the classic swing tune originally introduced and popularized in 1941 by the Andrews Sisters, to whom Midler has repeatedly referred as her idols and inspiration, as far back as her first appearances on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;. Midler told Carson in an interview that she always wanted to move like the sisters, and Patty Andrews remembered: &quot;When I first heard the introduction on the radio, I thought it was our old record. When Bette opened at the Amphitheater in Los Angeles, Maxene and I went backstage to see her. Her first words were, &#x27;What else did you record? During another Midler concert, Maxene went on stage and presented her with an honorary bugle. Bette recorded other Andrews Sisters hits, including &quot;In the Mood&quot; and &quot;Lullaby of Broadway&quot;.
Her self-titled follow-up album was released at the end of 1973. Again, the album was co-produced by Manilow. It reached Billboard&#x27;s Top 10 and eventually sold close to a million copies in the United States alone. Midler returned to recording with the 1976 and 1977 albums, &quot;Songs for the New Depression&quot; and &quot;Broken Blossom.&quot; In 1974, she received a Special Tony Award for her contribution to Broadway, with &quot;Clams on the Half Shell Revue&quot; playing at the Minskoff Theater. From 1975 to 1978, she also provided the voice of Woody the Spoon on the PBS educational series &quot;Vegetable Soup.&quot; In 1977, Midler&#x27;s first television special, whose title, &quot;Ol&#x27; Red Hair is Back&quot;, was a takeoff on Frank Sinatra&#x27;s &quot;Ol&#x27; Blue Eyes Is Back&quot;, premiered, featuring guest stars Dustin Hoffman and Emmett Kelly. It went on to win the &quot;Emmy Award&quot; for Outstanding Special – Comedy-Variety or Music. In 1977 she also released her first live album, &quot;Live at Last&quot;, a double album taken from concert performances in Cleveland, Ohio.

Midler made her first motion picture in 1979, starring in the 1960s-era rock and roll tragedy &quot;The Rose&quot;, as a drug-addicted rock star modeled after Janis Joplin. That year, she also released her fifth studio album, &quot;Thighs and Whispers.&quot; Midler&#x27;s first foray into disco was a commercial and critical failure and went on to be her all-time lowest charting album, peaking at No. 65 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; album chart. Soon afterward, she began a world concert tour, with one of her shows in Pasadena being filmed and released as the concert film &quot;Divine Madness&quot; (1980).

Her performance in &quot;The Rose&quot; earned her a nomination for Academy Award for Best Actress, a role for which she won the Golden Globe for Best Actress (Comedy or Musical). The film&#x27;s acclaimed soundtrack album sold over two million copies in the United States alone, earning a Double Platinum certification. The single version of the title song, which Amanda McBroom had written and composed, held the No. 1 position on Billboard&#x27;s Adult Contemporary chart for five consecutive weeks and reached No. 3 on Billboard&#x27;s Hot 100. It earned Midler her first Gold single and won the Grammy award for Best Pop Vocal Performance, Female.

===1981–1989: &quot;Wind Beneath My Wings&quot;, &quot;Beaches&quot;, and chart comeback===

Midler worked on the troubled comedy project &quot;Jinxed!&quot; in 1981. However, during production, there was friction with co-star Ken Wahl and the film&#x27;s director, Don Siegel. Released in 1982, the film was a major flop. Midler did not appear in any other films until 1986; however, she was an early choice for Miss Hannigan in the 1982 film &quot;Annie&quot;. During those four years, she concentrated on her music career and in 1983, released the album &quot;No Frills&quot;, produced by Chuck Plotkin, who was best known for his work with Bob Dylan and Bruce Springsteen. The album included three single releases: the ballad &quot;All I Need to Know&quot;, a cover of Detroit native Marshall Crenshaw&#x27;s &quot;You&#x27;re My Favorite Waste of Time&quot;—which Midler fell in love with after flipping his 45 of &quot;Someday Someway&quot;—and Midler&#x27;s take on the Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;Beast of Burden&quot;. She also released an all-comedy album (with a few songs tied into the comedy) called &quot;Mud Will Be Flung Tonight&quot; in 1985.

Midler performed on USA for Africa&#x27;s 1985 fund-raising single &quot;We Are the World&quot;, and participated at the Live Aid event at JFK Stadium in Philadelphia. Also in 1985, she signed a multi-picture deal with the Walt Disney Studios, where she starred in a string of successful films produced by the studio&#x27;s newly formed Touchstone Pictures division. She also produced them through her production banner, All Girl Productions with producing partner Bonnie Bruckheimer. She was subsequently cast by director Paul Mazursky in &quot;Down and Out in Beverly Hills&quot;, beginning a successful comedic acting career. She followed that role with several more Touchstone comedies, &quot;Ruthless People&quot; (1986), &quot;Outrageous Fortune&quot; (1987), and &quot;Big Business&quot; (1988). Later in 1988, Midler lent her voice to the animated character Georgette, a snobbish poodle, in Disney&#x27;s &quot;Oliver &amp; Company&quot;, and had a hit with &quot;Beaches&quot;, co-starring Barbara Hershey. The accompanying soundtrack remains Midler&#x27;s all-time biggest selling disc, reaching No. 2 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s album chart and with U.S. sales of four million copies. It featured her biggest hit, &quot;Wind Beneath My Wings&quot;, which went to No. 1 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Hot 100, achieved Platinum status, and won Midler her third Grammy Award – for Record of the Year – at the 1990 telecast.

===1990–1999: Further acting career, and television appearances===
Midler&#x27;s 1990 cover of the Julie Gold song &quot;From a Distance&quot;, the first offering from her seventh studio album &quot;Some People&#x27;s Lives&quot; (1990), topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Adult Contemporary charts and achieved platinum status in the US. The same year, she starred along with Trini Alvarado as the title character in John Erman&#x27;s drama film &quot;Stella&quot;. The third feature film adaptation of the 1920 novel &quot;Stella Dallas&quot; by Olive Higgins Prouty, Midler portrayed a vulgar single mother living in Watertown, New York, who, determined to give her daughter all the opportunities she never had, ultimately makes a selfless sacrifice to ensure her happiness. The movie scored mediocre reviews, while Midler received her first Razzie Award nomination for Worst Actress.

She co-starred with Woody Allen in the 1991 film &quot;Scenes from a Mall&quot;, again for Paul Mazursky. In the film, Allen&#x27;s character reveals to his author wife Deborah, played by Midler, after years of a happy marriage, that he has had an affair, resulting in her request for divorce. The movie performed poorly, and received a mixed reception by critics. Midler fared somewhat better with her other 1991 project &quot;For the Boys&quot;, on which she reteamed with &quot;The Rose&quot; director Mark Rydell. A historical musical drama, it tells the story of 1940s actress and singer Dixie Leonard, played by Midler, who teams up with Eddie Sparks, a famous performer, to entertain American troops. While the film received a mixed reception from critics, Midler earned rave reviews for her portrayal. The following year she was awarded her second Golden Globe and received her second Academy Award nomination for Best Actress.

Midler turned down the lead role in the musical comedy &quot;Sister Act&quot; in 1992, which instead went to Whoopi Goldberg. Midler won an Emmy Award in 1992 for her performance on the penultimate episode of &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; in May 1992, during which she sang an emotion-laden &quot;One for My Baby (and One More for the Road)&quot; to Johnny Carson. During the show, Midler began singing &quot;Here&#x27;s That Rainy Day&quot;, Carson&#x27;s favorite song; Carson joined in a few lyrics later. In 1993, she starred with Sarah Jessica Parker and Kathy Najimy in the Walt Disney Halloween comedy fantasy film, &quot;Hocus Pocus&quot;. Midler played the lead role of Winifred ‘Winnie’ Sanderson, the head witch and eldest of the fictional Sanderson Sisters; the sisters are a trio of convicted colonial-era witches who were executed by hanging during the Salem Witch Trials, and then magically brought back to life in the 1990s by teenagers who recite a mysterious spell. Released to initially mixed reviews, through various outlets (such as strong DVD sales and annual record-breaking showings on 13 Nights of Halloween), the film has achieved cult status over the years. In relation to &quot;Hocus Pocus&quot;, every year Midler hosts her annual Hulaween costume party, which benefits the New York Restoration Project. Her television work includes an Emmy-nominated version of the stage musical &quot;&quot; and a guest appearance as herself in Fran Drescher&#x27;s &quot;The Nanny&quot;.

Midler appeared on &quot;Seinfeld&quot; in &quot;The Understudy&quot; episode, that show&#x27;s sixth-season finale in May 1995. That same year, she had a supporting role in &quot;Get Shorty&quot;. Her 1997 HBO special &quot;Diva Las Vegas&quot; earned her a third Emmy Award, for Outstanding Performance in a Variety or Music Program. Midler&#x27;s other 1990s films include &quot;The First Wives Club&quot; (1996). In 1997, Midler, along with her co-stars from &quot;The First Wives Club&quot;, Goldie Hawn and Diane Keaton, was a recipient of the Women in Film Crystal Award, which honors &quot;outstanding women who, through their endurance and the excellence of their work, have helped to expand the role of women within the entertainment industry&quot;.

In 1998, Midler released her ninth studio album, &quot;Bathhouse Betty&quot;, named after the nickname she was given for performing at bathhouses early in her career. In 1999, she appeared in an episode of the CBS sitcom &quot;Murphy Brown&quot; and was featured in the animated musical film &quot;Fantasia 2000&quot;.

===2000–2005: &quot;Bette&quot; sitcom, tribute albums, and &quot;Kiss My Brass&quot; tour===
Midler starred in her own sitcom in 2000, &quot;Bette&quot;, which featured Midler playing a version of herself, a divine celebrity who is adored by her fans. Airing on CBS, initial ratings were high, marking the best sitcom debut for the network in more than five years, but viewers percentage soon declined, resulting in the show&#x27;s cancellation in early 2001. Midler openly griped about the show&#x27;s demanding shooting schedule, while the show itself was also reportedly rocked by backstage turmoil, involving the replacement of co-star Kevin Dunn whose departure was attributed by the media to his behind-the scenes bickering with Midler. However, Midler, critically praised, was awarded a People&#x27;s Choice Award for her performance in the show and received a Golden Globe Award nomination the following year. Also in 2000, Midler made an uncredited cameo appearance in Nancy Meyers&#x27; fantasy rom–com &quot;What Women Want&quot;, starring Mel Gibson and Helen Hunt. In the film, she portrayed a therapist who realizes that central character Nick, played by Gibson, is able to understand women&#x27;s thoughts. Released to generally mixed reviews, it became the then-most successful film ever directed by a woman, taking in $183 million in the United States, and grossing upward of $370 million worldwide.

The same year Midler starred in &quot;Isn&#x27;t She Great&quot; and &quot;Drowning Mona&quot;. In Andrew Bergman&#x27;s &quot;Isn&#x27;t She Great&quot;, a highly fictionalized account of the life and career of author Jacqueline Susann, she played alongside Nathan Lane and Stockard Channing, portraying Susann with her early struggles as an aspiring actress relentlessly hungry for fame, her relationship with press agent Irving Mansfield, her success as the author of &quot;Valley of the Dolls&quot;, and her battle with and subsequent death from breast cancer. The dramedy garnered largely negative reviews by critics, who dismissed it as &quot;bland material [that] produces entirely forgettable comic performances.&quot; For her performance in the film, Midler received her second Golden Raspberry Award nomination for Worst Actress at the 21st ceremony. In Nick Gomez&#x27;s dark comedy &quot;Drowning Mona&quot;, Midler appeared along with Danny DeVito and Jamie Lee Curtis, playing title character Mona Dearly, a spiteful, loud-mouthed, cruel and highly unpopular woman, whose mysterious death is investigated. Another critical fiasco, reviewers noted that the film &quot;drowns itself in humor that never rises above sitcom level.&quot;

After nearly three decades of erratic record sales, Midler was dropped from the Warner Music Group in 2001. Following a reported long-standing feud with Barry Manilow, the two joined forces after many years in 2003 to record &quot;Bette Midler Sings the Rosemary Clooney Songbook&quot;. Now signed to Columbia Records, the album was an instant success, being certified gold by RIAA. One of the &quot;Clooney Songbook&quot; selections, &quot;This Ole House&quot;, became Midler&#x27;s first Christian radio single shipped by Rick Hendrix and his positive music movement. The album was nominated for a Grammy the following year.

Throughout 2003 and 2004, Midler toured the United States in her new show, &quot;Kiss My Brass&quot;, to sell-out audiences. Also in 2004, she appeared in a supporting role in Frank Oz&#x27; science fiction satire &quot;The Stepford Wives&quot;, a remake of the 1975 film of the same name also based on the Ira Levin novel. Also starring Nicole Kidman, Matthew Broderick, Christopher Walken and Glenn Close, Midler played Bobbie Markowitz, a writer and recovering alcoholic. The project underwent numerous production problems that occurred throughout its shooting schedule, with reports of problems on-set between director Oz and the actors being rampant in the press. Oz later blamed Midler—who was amid recording her next album and rehearsing for her tour—for being under a lot of stress by other projects and making &quot;the mistake of bringing her stress on the set.&quot; While the original book and film had tremendous cultural impact, the remake was marked by poor reviews by many critics, and a financial loss of approximately $40 million at the box office.

Midler joined forces again with Manilow for another tribute album, &quot;Bette Midler Sings the Peggy Lee Songbook&quot;. Released in October 2005, the album sold 55,000 copies the first week of release, returned Midler to the top ten of US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and was nominated for a Grammy Award.

===2006–2011: Albums, Vegas show and appearances===
Midler released a new Christmas album titled &quot;Cool Yule&quot; in 2006, which featured a duet of Christmastime pop standards &quot;Winter Wonderland&quot;/&quot;Let It Snow&quot; with Johnny Mathis. Well-received, the album garnered a Grammy Award nomination for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album in 2007. The same year, Midler returned to the big screen, appearing in &quot;Then She Found Me&quot;, Helen Hunt&#x27;s feature film directorial debut. Also starring Hunt along with Matthew Broderick and Colin Firth, the comedy-drama film tells the story of a 39-year-old Brooklyn elementary school teacher, who after years is contacted by the flamboyant host of a local talk show, played by Midler, who introduces herself as her biological mother. Critical response to the film was mixed; whereas some critics praised the film for having strong performances, others felt the film was bogged down by a weak script and technical issues.
Midler debuted her Vegas show titled &quot;Bette Midler: The Showgirl Must Go On&quot; at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace on February 20, 2008. It comprised The Staggering Harlettes, 20 female dancers called The Caesar Salad Girls and a 13-piece band. The show played its final performance on January 31, 2010, and was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Variety, Music, or Comedy Special in 2011. Also in 2008, another compilation album by Midler, &quot;&quot;, was released. It reached number 66 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, and number six in the United Kingdom, where it was certified platinum for sales of over 300,000 copies. As her only film appearance that year, Midler had a small role in Diane English&#x27;s comedy film &quot;The Women&quot;, starring Meg Ryan, Annette Bening and Eva Mendes among others. An updated version of the George Cukor-directed 1939 film of the same name based on a 1936 play by Clare Boothe Luce, the film was widely panned by critics, who found it &quot;...a toothless remake of the 1939 classic, lacking the charm, wit and compelling protagonists of the original.&quot;

Midler appeared on the Bravo TV show &quot;My Life on the D-List&quot; with Kathy Griffin in an episode that aired in June 2009. In December of the same year, she appeared in the &quot;Royal Variety Performance&quot;, an annual British charity event attended by Queen Elizabeth II. Midler performed &quot;In My Life.&quot; The film was a success, grossing $112 million worldwide. In November 2010, Midler released &quot;Memories of You&quot;, another compilation of lesser known tracks from her catalog. Midler was one of the producers of the Broadway production of the musical &quot;Priscilla, Queen of the Desert&quot;, which opened in February 2011.

===2012–present: Return to Broadway===
Midler received the Sammy Cahn Lifetime Achievement Award at the Songwriters Hall of Fame in June 2012, recognizing how she &quot;captivated the world&quot; with her &quot;stylish presentation and unmistakable voice.&quot; The same year, she co-starred alongside Billy Crystal in the family film &quot;Parental Guidance&quot;, playing a couple of old school grandparents trying to adapt to their daughter&#x27;s 21st-century parenting style. Despite generally negative reviews by critics, who felt the film was &quot;sweet but milquetoast&quot;, box office totals for the movie were higher than initially expected.

Midler portrayed Hollywood super-agent Sue Mengers in the play &quot;I&#x27;ll Eat You Last: A Chat with Sue Mengers&quot;, dramatized by John Logan, opening April 24, 2013, at the Booth Theatre, her first time on Broadway in three decades. After the show&#x27;s success in New York, recouping its initial $2.4 million investment, the play transferred to Los Angeles at the Geffen Playhouse. A December 2013 announcement cast Midler as actress Mae West in an HBO biopic written by Harvey Fierstein and directed by William Friedkin. (The project remains unproduced over a decade later.)
She performed at the 2014 Academy Awards at the Dolby Theatre, singing &quot;Wind Beneath My Wings&quot; during the tribute. In November the same year, Midler released &quot;It&#x27;s the Girls!&quot; through Warner Bros. Records, her 25th album. The album spans seven decades of famous girl groups, from 1930s trios The Boswell Sisters and The Andrews Sisters to 1990s R&amp;B legends such as TLC and their single &quot;Waterfalls&quot;.

She returned to the stage in the title role of &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot; for the 2017 Broadway revival, earning her a Tony Award. In 2017, she also appeared in the role of Muv in the 2017 film &quot;Freak Show&quot;. Midler continued in &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot; through January 2018, then returned in July to close out the run of the successful revival.

Midler performed the song &quot;The Place Where Lost Things Go&quot; from &quot;Mary Poppins Returns&quot; at the 91st Annual Academy Awards ceremony on February 24, 2019. Midler voiced the character of Grandmama, Gomez and Fester&#x27;s mother, in the animated film version of &quot;The Addams Family&quot; released in October 2019. She reprised the role in the 2021 sequel &quot;The Addams Family 2&quot;.

Midler portrayed Bella Abzug in &quot;The Glorias&quot;, a 2020 biographical film revolving around the life of Gloria Steinem, directed by Julie Taymor. She also starred in the second season of &quot;The Politician&quot; after previously guest starring in the first.

Midler has written several books, including &quot;The Saga of Baby Divine&quot; and &quot;A View from a Broad&quot;. She published the children&#x27;s book &quot;The Tale of the Mandarin Duck&quot; in 2020, based on the 2018 story of a rare duck spotted in Central Park.

She played Miriam Nessler, a retired teacher from New York, in HBO&#x27;s &quot;Coastal Elites&quot; by Paul Rudnick.

Midler received the Kennedy Center Honor for a lifetime of achievement in the performing arts, with the medallion ceremony held at the Library of Congress on December 4, 2021. She attended the gala performance at the Kennedy Center the following day. Later that month, Midler came under fire when criticizing Joe Manchin for not supporting Joe Biden&#x27;s Build Back Better Plan. While criticizing Manchin, Midler also criticized the State of West Virginia with a tweet where Midler stated, &quot;What #JoeManchin, who represents a population smaller than Brooklyn, has done to the rest of America, who wants to move forward, not backward, like his state, is horrible. He sold us out. He wants us all to be just like his state, West Virginia. Poor, illiterate and strung out.&quot; She later apologized for the remarks.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bette Midler walks back W.Va. remarks amid anti-Manchin rant – msn news – Christie D&#x27;Zurilla on Manchin/Midler comments&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Midler reprised her role as Winifred Sanderson in &quot;Hocus Pocus 2&quot; for Disney+ in October 2022. In 2023, she starred in the comedy-drama film &quot;Sitting in Bars with Cake&quot;.

==Personal life==
Midler married artist Martin von Haselberg on December 16, 1984. The two have one daughter, actress Sophie von Haselberg, born on November 14, 1986.

==Charity work==
In 1991, Midler was an early sponsor of the Adopt-a-Highway, paying $2,000 a month for a crew to clean up a section of the Ventura Freeway in Burbank, California. Signs at both ends of the section read &quot;Litter Removal Next 2 Miles, Bette Midler.&quot; The location was so prominent that it became fodder for her 1993 guest appearance on the &quot;Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Krusty Gets Kancelled&quot;, where she is seen picking up trash along a stretch of highway she has adopted and causes car crashes for drivers who deliberately litter. In 1995, she carried the same idea to the east coast, adopting a section of the Long Island Expressway and Bronx River Parkway.

Midler founded the New York Restoration Project (NYRP) in 1995, a non-profit organization with the goal of revitalizing neglected neighborhood parks in economically disadvantaged neighborhoods of New York City. These include Highbridge Park, Fort Washington Park, and Fort Tryon Park in upper Manhattan and Roberto Clemente State Park and &quot;Bridge Park&quot; in the Bronx.

When the city planned in 1991 to auction 114 community gardens for commercial development, Midler led a coalition of green organizations to save them. NYRP took ownership of 60 of the most neglected plots. Since then, Midler and her organization have worked with local volunteers and community groups to ensure that these gardens are kept safe, clean and vibrant. In 2003, Midler opened Swindler Cove Park, a new public park on the Harlem River shore featuring specially designed educational facilities and the Peter Jay Sharp Boathouse, the first community rowing facility to be built on the Harlem River in more than 100 years. The organization offers free in-school and after-school environmental education programming to students from high-poverty Title I schools.

In 2001 after 9/11, she established programs run by her foundation which help wounded service members and their families by providing them resources, including custom homes. One of these programs helps service members recovering from trauma, injury, and loss. Also, since the first Gulf War she visits the USO and military bases to show her gratitude to service members by serving them meals just before deployment.

Bette Midler pledged to match Pink with a donation of $500,000 to help Australia during the wildfires in 2020.

<text>Taeniolabidoidea is a group of extinct mammals known whose fossils can be found in North America and Asia. They were the largest members of the extinct order Multituberculata, as well as the largest non-therian mammals. &quot;Lambdopsalis&quot; even provides direct fossil evidence of mammalian fur in a fairly good state of preservation for a 60-million-year-old animal. Some of these animals were large for their time; &quot;Taeniolabis taoensis&quot; is the largest known multituberculate and though smaller, &quot;Yubaatar&quot; is the largest known Mesozoic Asian multituberculate. &quot;T. taoensis&quot; averaged a body mass of .

The group was initially established as a suborder, before being assigned the rank of a superfamily by McKenna and Bell in 1997. Two families are recognised: the primarily North American Taeniolabididae, composed of &quot;Taeniolabis&quot; and &quot;Kimbetopsalis&quot;, and the exclusively Asian [[Lambdopsalidae]], composed of &quot;Lambdopsalis&quot;, &quot;Sphenopsalis&quot; and &quot;Prionessus&quot;, with &quot;Valenopsalis&quot; being a basal form outside of either clade. Some of the fossils are well-preserved. Though the possible taeniolabidoid &quot;Bubodens&quot; is known from the Lancian Late Cretaceous deposits of South Dakota, and &quot;Yubaatar&quot; is known from Late Cretaceous deposits in the Henan Province, the clade is otherwise only clearly represented in Paleocene strata.

Members of this group have dental formulas of or . Russell notes that the taeniolabidoids had ever-growing, self-sharpening incisors, much like modern rodents, and the premolars that are usually characteristic of multituberculates are sometimes lost in this family.

Derived characteristics of the taxon (apomorphies) include: &quot;snout short and wide with anterior part of zygomatic arches directed transversely, resulting in a square-like shape of the skull (shared with Kogaionidae); frontals small, pointed posteriorly, almost or completely excluded from the orbital rim&quot;.

<text>The Russo-Swedish War of 1741–1743 (also known as The War of the Hats) was instigated by the Hats, a Swedish political party that aspired to regain the territories lost to Russia during the Great Northern War, and by French diplomacy, which sought to divert Russia&#x27;s attention from supporting its long-standing ally the Habsburg monarchy in the War of the Austrian Succession. The war was a disaster for Sweden, which lost more territory to Russia.

==Swedish preparations==
Swedish officer Malcolm Sinclair undertook a trip with the aim of trying to arrange a safer way of diplomatic communications between Sweden and the Ottoman Empire in 1738. He brought an extra copy of a letter intended for the Swedish ministers in Constantinople on the subject of negotiations with the Ottoman Empire on a possible alliance against Russia. Although the diplomatic mission was kept in high secrecy the Russian Minister Plenipotentiary in Stockholm, Bestuzhev-Ryumin, became aware of it and forwarded the information to the Russian government. Sinclair accomplished his mission and at the beginning of April 1739 left Constantinople. On 17 June, between Grüneberg (Zielona Góra) and Neustadt (Prudnik), he was overtaken by two Russian officers, captain Kütler and lieutenant Lewitzki, who were dispatched by Münnich with an order to &quot;catch up&quot; the envoy. The officers took away from Sinclair his diplomatic papers, pulled him out of the coach and took him aside to a forest where he was killed and looted. The Russian government denied the responsibility for the assassination. In Sweden the assassination brought tremendous resentment around the country and hatred towards Russia.

In the summer of 1740, the commander of Swedish forces in Finland, General , was removed from his post due to his opposition to the planned war and Charles Emil Lewenhaupt was elevated to the vacant position. However, Finnish defenses had fallen into disrepair as most of the funds for their support were used elsewhere in the kingdom. Neither had any preparations been made as a result of what had taken place in the Great Northern War. In the end what funds that were allocated for Finland were used for preparations for offensive war instead of strengthening the defenses.

The Swedish war plan was to first capture Vyborg and then advance further towards Saint Petersburg. The objective of these maneuvers was to threaten Saint Petersburg and to set the stage for a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; engineered by French and Swedish diplomats and aimed at toppling the pro-Austrian regime of Anna Leopoldovna. The coup did take place in December, but the new empress, Elizaveta Petrovna, reneged on her promises to return the Baltic provinces to Sweden and continued the vigorous prosecution of the war, under the guidance of her pro-Austrian chancellor, Aleksey Bestuzhev.

While Swedish troops were being deployed at the Russian border, near Villmanstrand () and Frederikshamn (), Swedish naval forces consisting of ten ships of the line and four frigates under Admiral Tomas von Rajalin and 20 galley strong rowing fleet under Admiral Abraham Falkengren moved on 20 May 1741 to the islands near the border. While standing idle an epidemic broke out in the fleet largely paralyzing it and claiming the life of Admiral von Rajalin. The Swedish declaration of war in late July had been intended to coincide with the invasion but now it failed to do so since the fleet was unable to take action and concentration of the ground forces had not yet been carried out. The situation was not improved by the fact that Lewenhaupt arrived in Finland two months after the declaration of war and command of the army fell to General Henrik Magnus von Buddenbrock.

== War ==
=== 1741 ===

Due to Swedish inaction, the Russians seized the initiative and struck first with an army of 16,000 men under Field-Marshal Peter Lacy advancing from Vyborg (, ) towards Villmanstrand (). Using nearly fourfold superiority in numbers, the Russians inflicted in the Battle of Villmanstrand a major defeat on the Swedish garrison led by General Carl Henrik Wrangel. Blame for the defeat at Villmanstrand was placed on General von Buddenbrock who had not believed that the Russians were seriously attacking and did not move to aid Wrangel.

Lewenhaupt, who arrived ten days after the defeat, tried to organize a joint operation by both land and naval forces towards Vyborg but Admiral Aron Sjöstierna, who took von Rajalin&#x27;s position, made it clear that the fleet would not be able to do it. The Russian fleet had also fallen into disrepair and was unable to take part in the fighting in 1741. Sjöstierna sailed home on 22 September and the commander of the remaining Swedish vessels ignored Lewenhaupt&#x27;s attempts to persuade him to sail to Beryozovye Islands (, ) and instead sailed back to Sweden on 27 October. Operations on the land front also came to a halt when an armistice was agreed to with Russia in early December.

=== 1742 ===

The Russians reneged on their ceasefire agreement early in March 1742, but a harsh winter made it impossible for the main armies to operate. Light Russian cavalry forces (cossacks and hussars) raided the Swedish side of the border but were often repulsed by local populations. In March, the Russians, under the command of Woldemar Lowendal, also attempted to raid the Swedish anchorage near Frederikshamn over ice, but the harsh weather made it impossible. Swedish General Lewenhaupt planned to renew the attack against Vyborg in the spring of 1742. Swedish naval units required to support the attack started to arrive in mid May. However, since the naval commanders had been ordered to patrol between Reval and Helsingfors they refused to follow Lewenhaupt&#x27;s orders.

The main Swedish fleet arrived on 3 June from Sweden under Admiral Sjöstierna and consisted of fifteen ships of the line and five frigates. The fleet sailed to Äspö () (25 km SSE from modern-day Kotka). A week later, a galley fleet commanded by Admiral Falkengren joined the main fleet, bringing 25 galleys and some support ships. However, unlike in the previous year, the Russian fleet was also active with a galley fleet of 45 galleys under General and an open sea fleet of at least 12 ships of the line under Admiral . Regardless, Lewenhaupt held a council of war on 5 June in an attempt to get naval units to sail to the Beryozovye Islands (, ) but the naval commanders judged the risk for the fleet to be too great and Lewenhaupt was forced to back down from his plan.

Since the Swedish army remained inactive, the Russians again seized the initiative and moved onto the offensive. With the support of the Russian galley fleet, a 30,000 men strong Russian army under the command of Field-Marshal Lacy marched from Vyborg. It crossed the border on 13 June and then continued advancing towards Frederikshamn. The Swedes had prepared a strong defensive position outside of Frederikshamn, at Mäntlahti. The Swedish colonel defending the position had become aware of the Russian approach and withdrew all his forces from the fortified positions to Frederikshamn a day before the Russian attack, which was to take place on 25 June. However, the abandoned position was critical for the town&#x27;s defense and by 28 June, the Swedish army under Lewenhaupt set the town on fire and started withdrawing.

Co-operation with Swedish naval and land forces did not go smoothly and instead of supporting the army, the bulk of the fleet sailed directly to Hangö when the army started its withdrawal. Galleys sailed to Pellinge (). This in turn cut off the army from its supply lines and Lewenhaupt started withdrawing further towards the army&#x27;s supply depots at Borgå. Russians followed the withdrawing Swedes but no real action between the armies, apart from skirmishes between the Swedish rearguard and Russian cavalry patrols, took place. On 18 July after learning that Swedish garrisons further inland had left their posts, Lewenhaupt and the army council judged it to be best to withdraw to Helsingfors to prepare its defenses.

The Swedes started to dismantle and transport away the food and supply stores concentrated in Borgå. On 27 July Russians arrived in the vicinity and moved into Borgå on 30 July, which the Swedish army had abandoned one day earlier. The Swedish withdrawal, which had lasted nearly two months, finally ended in Helsingfors on 11 August. A couple of days later, the Russians had managed to completely surround the town on land. The Swedish galley fleet was stationed east of Helsingfors but judged its position to be untenable and withdraw into the town as well, allowing the Russian galley fleet to complete encirclement of the town after 20 August.

Before the town was completely cut off, on 19 August General Lewenhaupt and General Buddenbrock were summoned to proceed immediately to Stockholm for an inquiry into their actions. Both generals were imprisoned on their arrival and they were placed on trial. The deputy commander of Swedish forces, General Jean Louis Bousquet, signed a surrender document on 24 August. According to the terms of the document, the Finnish men were released from the army while the Swedish men were allowed to sail back home. All guns, supplies, and even fodder stores were to be given over to the Russians. All Swedish naval forces returned to Sweden in early September 1742. The Russians advanced all the way to Åland and cut Finland off from the rest of the Sweden. At about this time a small Swedish detachment attacked a Russian cavalry detachment at Kemi. All of Finland fell under Russian occupation (1742–1743) which became later known as the &quot;Lesser Wrath&quot; (). 

=== 1743 ===
The Swedish army retook Åland in March 1743 and at the start of May, a fleet of 16 ships of the line and 5 frigates under Admiral Jean von Utfall arrived to block the coastal sea route past Hangö. Admiral Falkengren&#x27;s galley fleet was sent to Åland. The task of these naval forces was to prevent Russian forces from reaching Sweden. However, before the Swedish forces arrived, a Russian galley fleet under General James Francis Edward Keith passed Hangö. The Swedish galley fleet attacked the Russian galley fleet at the narrows of Korpoström, just south of the island of Korpo, where the Swedish attack was repulsed. Falkengren returned to Åland.

The Swedish open sea fleet at Hangö still blocked the passage of Field-Marshal Peter Lacy&#x27;s 50 galley strong coastal fleet. However, on 7 June, a Russian fleet led by Admiral Nikolai Fedorovich Golovin managed to draw the Swedish fleet out of its anchorage while not actually engaging in a fight. This allowed the Russian galley fleet to safely pass the cape. The result was overwhelming Russian naval superiority in south-western Finland and areas near Åland, which forced the Swedish fleet to move to the west of Åland and hastened the peace negotiations. Admiral Golovin later faced a military tribunal for his refusal to engage the Swedish squadron of equal strength but was cleared when he referred to an edict from Peter the Great which stated that a Russian fleet should not engage in battle unless having 3:2 superiority or better. Swedish generals Lewenhaupt and Buddenbrock were both beheaded primarily as scapegoats for the failed war-policy of the ruling &quot;Hat&quot; faction.

==Treaty of Åbo==

As soon as hostilities ceased and the Russian army entered Turku (), the statesmen Alexander Rumyantsev and arrived at the city in order to discuss a peace settlement. The Tsarina promised to evacuate her army from Finland on the condition that Adolf Frederick of Holstein-Gottorp—that is, the uncle of her own heir apparent—was named as the heir to the throne of Sweden. (The latter had been offered the crown of Finland by the local &quot;lantdag&quot;). The Hats acquiesced in her proposal in the hope that Adolf Frederick would be able to obtain better terms from her. Elizabeth also wanted Russian forces to occupy Sweden in order to ensure Adolf Frederick&#x27;s peaceful election, but this plan aroused the vehement opposition of the Swedish representatives and was abandoned.

While peace negotiations lumbered on Lacy—who had distinguished himself in similar operations during the Great Northern War—embarked from Kronstadt in order to effect a landing in Sweden proper. When the Baltic Fleet was approaching Umeå, news came that the Treaty of Åbo () had been finalized, with Sweden ceding to Russia the towns of Lappeenranta and Hamina and a strip of Finland to the northwest of Saint Petersburg. The Kymi River was to form part of the border between the two powers. The treaty marked the further decline of Sweden as a great power in Northern Europe.

The territory ceded to Russia was added to the Russian gains in the Treaty of Nystad () in 1721, under the Governorate of Vyborg. This was later incorporated into the Russian Grand Duchy of Finland in 1812.

<doc id="210373" wikidata="Q640821" url="?curid=210373" title="Catopsalis">
<text>Catopsalis is a genus of extinct mammal from the Paleocene of North America. This animal was a relatively large member of the extinct order of Multituberculata. Most multituberculates were much smaller.

At one time, the genus was also formally reported from the upper Cretaceous of Mongolia. However, that material was subsequently referred to the genera of &quot;Djadochtatherium&quot; and &quot;Catopsbaatar&quot;. &quot;Catopsalis&quot; is within the suborder of Cimolodonta and a member of the superfamily Taeniolabidoidea.

Recent research suggests that &quot;Catopsalis&quot; is actually a paraphyletic assemblage, and one species, &quot;C. joyneri&quot;, has been moved to its own genus, &quot;Valenopsalis&quot;.

== Species ==
The species &quot;Catopsalis foliatus&quot; was named by Cope E.D. in 1882. It has also been known as &quot;C. johnstoni&quot; (Fox R.C. 1989) and &quot;Polymastodon foliatus&quot; (Cope 1884). This species has been found in Puercan (Paleocene)-age strata of the San Juan Basin of New Mexico and in the Ravenscrag Formation of Canada. &quot;C. johnstoni&quot;, from Saskatchewan, is also in the Alberta collection.

The species &quot;Catopsalis fissidens&quot; was named by Cope E.D. in 1884. It has also been known as &quot;C. utahensis&quot; (Gazin C.L., 1939) and &quot;Polymastodon fissidens&quot; (Cope, 1884). It has been found in the Torrejonian (Paleocene)-age beds in the San Juan Basin of New Mexico and Utah. The University of Wyoming boasts a possible specimen.

The species &quot;Catopsalis calgariensis&quot; was named by Russell L.S. in 1926. Remains were found in Paleocene-age strata of Wyoming and Alberta, Canada. The holotype, collected in 1924, is in the collection of Alberta University. Further material is in the possession of Wyoming University.

The species &quot;Catopsalis alexanderi&quot; was named by Middleton M.D. in 1982. It is found in the Puercan (Paleocene)-age Littleton Local Fauna of Colorado, Montana and Wyoming (United States), dating from 66 - 63 million years ago. Specimens are included in the collections of the American Museum of Natural History in New York and the Peabody Museum of Natural History at Yale University.

The species &quot;Catopsalis waddleae&quot; was named by Buckley G.A. in 1995. It has been found in the Puercan age beds of the Simpson Quarry of Montana. Relative to the other species it is an extreme heavyweight. Remains of this species have also recently been discovered in the Idaho panhandle region.

==Personal life==
Asher met Paul McCartney on 18 April 1963 at Royal Albert Hall in London, and began a five-year relationship with him. In December 1963, McCartney took up residence at Asher&#x27;s family Wimpole Street townhouse and stayed there until the couple moved into McCartney&#x27;s own home in St John&#x27;s Wood in 1966. McCartney wrote several Beatles songs inspired by Asher, including &quot;And I Love Her&quot;, &quot;We Can Work It Out&quot;, &quot;You Won&#x27;t See Me&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Looking Through You&quot;, &quot;What You&#x27;re Doing&quot;, &quot;Things We Said Today&quot; and &quot;For No One&quot;. The couple announced on Christmas Day 1967 that they were engaged to be married, and Asher accompanied the Beatles and their partners to Rishikesh in early 1968 to attend an advanced transcendental meditation training session with the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. In mid-1968, she returned to London from an acting assignment in Bristol earlier than expected and allegedly discovered McCartney in bed with Francie Schwartz. Shortly afterwards, Margaret Asher drove to Cavendish Avenue to collect her daughter&#x27;s things.

On 20 July 1968, Asher announced to the BBC that her engagement had been called off. McCartney soon after started dating Linda Eastman, whom he married in 1969. A problem in the relationship had been McCartney&#x27;s drug use and close relationship with John Lennon. Asher confided to Beatles&#x27; biographer Hunter Davies that McCartney had &quot;changed so much. He was on LSD, which I hadn&#x27;t shared. I was jealous of all the spiritual experiences he&#x27;d had with John. There were fifteen people dropping in all day long. The house had changed and was full of stuff I didn&#x27;t know about.&quot;

Asher attended the 1970 London premiere of the Beatles&#x27; movie &quot;Let It Be&quot;, along with Lennon&#x27;s ex-wife Cynthia.

In 1971, Asher met illustrator Gerald Scarfe. They married in 1981 and have three children. Asher dislikes discussing her relationship with McCartney; she said in 2004: &quot;I&#x27;ve been happily married for 30-something years. It&#x27;s insulting.&quot;

<doc id="210383" wikidata="Q2551944" url="?curid=210383" title="Northern Wars">
<text>&quot;Northern Wars&quot; is a term used for a series of wars fought in northern and northeastern Europe from the 16th to the 18th century, primarily between the territorial rivals of the Swedish Empire, Tsardom of Russia, Poland–Lithuania, and Denmark–Norway. The Great Northern War is generally considered to have concluded the Northern Wars with the decline of Sweden and establishment of the Russian Empire as the principal power of the region, however there are different scholarly opinions on which war constitutes the First Northern War and an internationally agreed-on nomenclature for these wars has not yet been devised.

==Conflicts of the Northern Wars==
Depending upon what date is chosen for the starting point, the Northern Wars comprise:

*The Russo-Swedish War (1554–1557), &quot;First Northern War&quot; according to Arvo Viljanti
*The Livonian War (1558–1583), &quot;First Northern War&quot; according to Klaus Zernack
**The Northern Seven Years&#x27; War (1563–1570), &quot;First Northern War&quot; according to some Polish historians
*The Russo-Polish War (1654–1667), also known as the &quot;Thirteen Years&#x27; War&quot;; &quot;First Northern War&quot; according to some Russian historians
*The Second Northern War (1655–1660), &quot;First Northern War&quot; according to traditional English, German, Russian and Scandinavian historiography, in Poland known as Swedish Deluge
*The Scanian War (1674–1679), also called &quot;Swedish-Brandenburgian War&quot; by German historians
*The Great Northern War (1700–1721), also &quot;Third Northern War&quot; or &quot;Second Northern War&quot;
