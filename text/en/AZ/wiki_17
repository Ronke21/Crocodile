<text>William Booth (10 April 1829 – 20 August 1912) was an English Methodist preacher who, along with his wife, Catherine, founded the Salvation Army and became its first General (1878–1912). The Christian movement with a quasi-military structure and government founded in 1865 has spread from London to many parts of the world. It is known for being one of the largest distributors of humanitarian aid.

==Early life==
William Booth was born in Sneinton, Nottingham, the second son of five children born to Samuel Booth and his second wife, Mary Moss. His birthplace is now a museum. Booth&#x27;s father was a nailmaker and builder from Belper in Derbyshire but, during William&#x27;s childhood, the family descended into poverty. In 1842, Samuel Booth, who could no longer afford his son&#x27;s school fees, apprenticed the 13-year-old William to a pawnbroker. Samuel Booth died on 23 September 1842.

Two years into his apprenticeship Booth had a religious conversion. He then read extensively and trained himself in writing and in speech, becoming a Methodist local preacher. Booth was encouraged to be an evangelist primarily through his best friend, Will Sansom. Both Sansom and Booth began in the 1840s to preach to the poor and the sinners of Nottingham, and Booth would probably have remained as Sansom&#x27;s partner in his new Mission ministry, as Sansom titled it, if Sansom had not died of tuberculosis, in 1849.

When his apprenticeship ended in 1848, Booth was unemployed and spent a year looking in vain for work. In 1849, Booth reluctantly left his family and moved to London, where he found work with a pawnbroker. Booth tried to continue lay preaching in London, but the small amount of preaching work that came his way frustrated him, and so he resigned as a lay preacher and took to open-air evangelising in the streets and on Kennington Common.

== Methodist ministry ==

In 1851, Booth joined the Methodist Reform Church, formed in 1849 by a breakaway from the Wesleyan Methodist Church. On 10 April 1852, his 23rd birthday, he left pawnbroking and became a full-time preacher at their headquarters at Binfield Chapel in Clapham. William styled his preaching after the revivalist American James Caughey, who had made frequent visits to England and preached at Broad Street Chapel, Nottingham, where Booth was a member. Just over a month after he started full-time preaching, on 15 May 1852, William Booth became formally engaged to Catherine Mumford.

Interested in the Congregationalist approach, Booth consulted David Thomas at Stockwell about the ministry. Through Thomas, he met John Campbell and then James William Massie. The recommendation was training under Rev. John Frost; but Booth disliked Frost&#x27;s school, and soon left. In November 1853, he was invited to become the Reformers&#x27; minister at Spalding in Lincolnshire. He married Catherine Mumford on 17 June 1855 at Stockwell Green Congregational Church in London.

In the summer of 1857 the Booth family moved to Brighouse in the West Riding of Yorkshire, where he was appointed preacher at the Bethel Chapel. William and Catherine campaigned against the employment of seven-year-old girls in a local mill. On the former chapel in Bethel Street, which is now a Wetherspoons pub, there is a blue plaque commemorating that Booth served there. By 1859 he and his wife had moved to Gateshead.

Though Booth was now a prominent Methodist evangelist, he was unhappy that the annual conference of the denomination kept assigning him to a pastorate, the duties of which he had to neglect to respond to the frequent requests that he do evangelistic campaigns. At the Liverpool conference in 1861, after having spent three years at Gateshead, his request to be freed for evangelism full-time was refused yet again, and Booth resigned from the ministry of the Methodist New Connexion.

Soon he was barred from campaigning in Methodist congregations, so he became an independent evangelist. His doctrine remained much the same, though; he preached that eternal punishment was the fate of those who do not believe the Gospel of Jesus Christ and the necessity of repentance from sin, and the promise of holiness. He taught that this belief would manifest itself in a life of love for God and mankind. The &quot;Ethical&quot; characteristic of Booth&#x27;s business ventures was evident in the manufacture of boxes of Salvation Army matches which bore the slogan &quot;Lights in darkest England, Security from fire, Fair wages for fair work&quot;. His match factory on Old Ford paid 4 pence a gross, while the larger firms only paid 2 1/2 pence.

==The Christian Mission==
The tent was set up on an old Quaker burial ground on Mile End Waste in Whitechapel, with an initial goal to deliver the Good News to all.

By 1865, Booth and his wife had opened &#x27;The Christian Revival Society&#x27; in the East End of London, which held regular evening meetings to share the repentance that Booth believed Christian salvation could bring both the poor and marginalised. The Christian Revival Society was renamed The Christian Mission, subsequently to become the &quot;East London Christian Mission&quot;.
The Christian Mission&#x27;s slow growth was hard work for Booth; his wife writes that he would &quot;stumble home night after night haggard with fatigue, often his clothes were torn and bloody bandages swathed his head where a stone had struck&quot;.

Evening meetings were held in an old warehouse where urchins threw stones and fireworks through the window. Outposts were established throughout the city, attracting converts, but the Christian Mission remained just one of the five hundred charitable groups working in London&#x27;s East End.

Booth practised various types of charity himself, such as opening &quot;Food for the Million&quot; (soup kitchens).

==The Salvation Army==

Having been founded as the &quot;East London Christian Mission&quot; in 1865, the name &quot;The Salvation Army&quot; developed from an incident in May 1878. William Booth was dictating a letter to his secretary George Scott Railton and said, &quot;We are a volunteer army.&quot; Bramwell Booth heard his father and said, &quot;Volunteer, I&#x27;m no volunteer, I&#x27;m a regular!&quot; Railton was instructed to cross out the word &quot;volunteer&quot; and substitute the word &quot;salvation&quot;.(The printer&#x27;s proof copy of the Missions&#x27; report for 1878 declared &quot;The Christian Mission Is A Volunteer Army&quot;, but the corrected proof read &quot;The Christian Mission Is ... A Salvation Army&quot;) The Salvation Army was modelled after the military, with its own flag (or colours) and its own music, often with Christian words to popular and folkloric tunes sung in the pubs. Booth and the other soldiers in &quot;God&#x27;s Army&quot; would wear the army&#x27;s own uniform, &#x27;putting on the armour,&#x27; for meetings and ministry work. He became the &quot;General&quot; and his other ministers were given appropriate ranks as &quot;officers&quot;. Other members became &quot;soldiers&quot;.

Though the early years were lean ones, with the need of money to help the needy an ever growing issue, Booth and The Salvation Army persevered. In the early 1880s, operations were extended to other countries, notably the United States, France, Switzerland, Sweden and others, including to most of the countries of the British Empire: Australia, Canada, India, Cape Colony, New Zealand, Jamaica, etc.

Often the beginnings in other countries occurred through &quot;salvationist&quot; activities by non-officers who had emigrated. With some initial success they would contact London to &#x27;send officers.&#x27;

In other cases, like in Argentina, a non-salvationist told Booth that there were thousands of British people there who needed salvation. The four officers sent in 1890 found that those British were scattered all over the pampas. But the missionaries started ministry in the Spanish language and the work spread throughout the country – initially following the rail-road development, since the British in charge of building the rail-roads were usually sympathetic to the movement.

During his lifetime, William Booth established Army work in 58 countries and colonies, travelling extensively and holding, &quot;salvation meetings.&quot;

Booth regularly published a magazine and was the author of a number of books; he also composed several songs. His book &quot;In Darkest England and the Way Out&quot; not only became a best-seller after its 1890 release, it set the foundation for the army&#x27;s modern social welfare approach. It compared what was considered &quot;civilised&quot; England with &quot;Darkest Africa&quot; – a land then considered poor and backward. What Booth suggested was that much of London and greater England after the Industrial Revolution was not better off in the quality of life than those in the underdeveloped world. He proposed a strategy to apply the Christian Gospel and work ethic to the problems. The book speaks of abolishing vice and poverty by establishing homes for the homeless, farm communities such as Hadleigh Farm where the urban poor can be trained in agriculture, training centres for prospective emigrants, homes for fallen women and released prisoners, aid for the poor, and help for drunkards. He also lays down schemes for poor men&#x27;s lawyers, banks, clinics, industrial schools and even a seaside resort.

==Opposition==

During its early years The Salvation Army faced opposition, especially from those in the alcohol-selling industry who were concerned that the activities of Booth and his followers would persuade the poorer classes to stop drinking. One group opposed to Booth and The Salvation Army was the Skeleton Army, a diffuse group, particularly in Southern England, that opposed and disrupted The Salvation Army&#x27;s marches against alcohol from the early 1880s until about 1892. Clashes between the two groups led to the deaths of several Salvationists and injuries to many others. During 1882 alone, 662 Salvation Army soldiers were assaulted: 251 of them were women and 23 of them were under fifteen years of age.

Other accusations centred around the fact that Booth appointed his own children to posts for which others were better qualified, leading to claims that The Salvation Army was a Booth family business. For example, he appointed his daughter Emma Booth as the Principal of the Officers&#x27; Training Home, The Salvation Army&#x27;s first training school for women when she was just 19. While William Booth had once said to his children that &quot;The Salvation Army does not belong to you, or to me, it belongs to the world&quot; and was very wary of the leadership of the army becoming a dynasty, others believed that Booth was creating a dynasty, as was suggested by the fact that he insisted that his sons-in-law added &#x27;Booth&#x27; to their own names (see Frederick Booth-Tucker and Arthur Booth-Clibborn). This was further borne out when Booth appointed his son, Bramwell Booth, as his successor as General in his will.

The press was often hostile to Booth and The Salvation Army as well because their methods and message were widely misinterpreted. The army&#x27;s motto &quot;Blood &amp; Fire&quot;, which had theological meaning representing the saving &quot;blood of Jesus&quot; and the sanctifying &quot;fire of the Holy Spirit&quot;, was erroneously thought to mean the blood of sinners and the fire of hell. There was also suspicion about the army&#x27;s motives, with Booth often portrayed as a charlatan only out to make money.

The Church of England was at first hostile to the activities of Booth and The Salvation Army. The philanthropist, politician, and evangelist Lord Shaftesbury even went so far as to describe Booth as the &quot;Anti-Christ&quot;. One of the main complaints against Booth was his &quot;elevation of women to man&#x27;s status&quot;. Many found him dictatorial and hard to work with. Some of his own children denounced him as their leader and turned their backs on The Salvation Army, including his daughter Kate Booth and his sons Herbert and Ballington Booth, the latter founding a separate organisation, the Volunteers of America with himself as &quot;General&quot;. The evangelist Rodney &quot;Gipsy&quot; Smith left him because of his rigidity and Dwight L. Moody would not support him because he felt there was a threat to the local church.

==Later years==
Opinion of The Salvation Army and William Booth eventually changed to that of favour. In his later years, he was received in audience by kings, emperors and presidents. The mass media began to use his title of &#x27;General&#x27; with reverence.

In 1899, Booth suffered from blindness in both eyes, but with a short rest, was able to recover his sight. In 1904 he took part in a motor tour when he was driven around Great Britain, stopping off in cities, towns and villages to preach to the crowds from his open-top car. In 1906 Booth was made a Freeman of the City of London, and was awarded an honorary degree from the University of Oxford. In 1902 he was invited to attend the coronation of Edward VII and Alexandra.

He made his last visit to North America in 1907, and in 1909 he embarked on a six-month motor tour of the United Kingdom. During this tour he discovered he was blind in his right eye and the sight in his left eye was dimmed by cataracts. The rest of the tour had to be cancelled. On 21 August 1909 a surgeon at Guy&#x27;s Hospital removed his right eye. Despite this setback, in 1910 Booth campaigned in the Netherlands, Denmark, Germany, Switzerland and Italy. On his return to England, he embarked on his seventh and last motor tour.

William Booth died at age 83 on 20 August 1912 (or, in Salvationist parlance, was Promoted to Glory) at his home in Hadley Wood, London. His body lay in state for three days at Clapton Congress Hall where 150,000 people filed past his casket. On 27 August 1912, Booth&#x27;s funeral service was held at Olympia London where 40,000 people attended, including Queen Mary, who sat almost unrecognised far to the rear of the great hall. In a letter to Bramwell Booth, King George V wrote: &quot;The nation has lost a great organizer and the poor a whole-hearted and sincere friend.&quot; United States President William Taft wrote &quot;[Booth&#x27;s] long life and great talents were dedicated to the noble work of helping the poor and weak and giving them another chance to attain success and happiness.&quot; Media agencies around the world reported on Booth&#x27;s death, including the &quot;Daily Express&quot; in the United Kingdom, &quot;The South African&quot; in South Africa, the &quot;Globe and Mail&quot; in Canada, and the &quot;New York Times&quot; in the United States.

Booth&#x27;s funeral procession began at the Salvation Army&#x27;s international headquarters as 10,000 uniformed Salvationists fell in behind. Forty Salvation Army brass bands played the &quot;Dead March&quot; from Handel&#x27;s &quot;Saul&quot; as the vast procession set off. He was buried with his wife Catherine (died 1890) in Abney Park Cemetery, the main London burial ground for 19th-century non-conformists.

Upon Booth&#x27;s death, his son, Bramwell Booth, became the second General of The Salvation Army. It was William Booth&#x27;s intention to have each general choose his successor. However, Generals of the Salvation Army are now elected by the High Council of The Salvation Army.

==Legacy==

In Booth&#x27;s honour, Vachel Lindsay wrote the poem &quot;General William Booth Enters into Heaven&quot;. Charles Ives, who had been Evangeline Booth&#x27;s neighbour, set the poem to music. In 1990 a diesel locomotive in the British Rail fleet was named &#x27;The William Booth&#x27;.

The William Booth rose, developed by Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, was named in his honour. William Booth Memorial Training College in Denmark Hill, London, the College for Officer Training of The Salvation Army in the United Kingdom, is named after him, as is the William Booth Primary School in his native Nottingham and William Booth Lane in central Birmingham. Many Salvation Army training colleges, schools, orphanages, hospitals and other institutions around the world bear his name.

Statues of each of the Booths by George Edward Wade were erected on Champion Hill in London, next to the Salvation Army&#x27;s training college in London in 1929. Replicas of these statues stand in the Mile End Road, close to the site of the first Salvation Army meeting: that of William was unveiled in 1979, and that of Catherine in 2015.

Mount William Booth in Alberta, Canada was named after Booth.

William is remembered (with Catherine) in the Church of England with a commemoration on 20 August.

<doc id="201083" wikidata="Q369596" url="?curid=201083" title="Nông Đức Mạnh">
<text>Nông Đức Mạnh (; born 11 September 1940) is a Vietnamese politician who served as General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam, the most powerful position in the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, from 22 April 2001 to 19 January 2011. His parents were Tày peasants. Nông Đức Mạnh was born in Cường Lợi, Na Rì District, Bắc Kạn Province. He is father to Nông Quốc Tuấn, party secretary for Bắc Giang Province.

==Background==
It has long been rumoured that Nông Đức Mạnh is the illegitimate son of Hồ Chí Minh (1890–1969) and Nông Thị Trưng (1921–2003), Hồ&#x27;s housekeeper from 1941–42. This story may have been a factor in his selection as party leader. In a profile of Mạnh published in the official press immediately after he gained this position, Nông Thị Trưng was identified as his mother.

Nông Đức Mạnh&#x27;s official biography gives his date of birth as 11 September 1940 and states that he was born to a peasant family from the Tày ethnic minority when Hồ Chí Minh was still in China. Ho returned to Vietnam in February 1941 and met Trưng in July. Hồ wrote a four-line poem for Trưng in 1944, and gave her a notebook as &quot;a token of my love&quot;.

This poem was later taught to elementary school students. In April 2001, shortly after Nông Đức Mạnh was named as General Secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam, a reporter at a news conference asked him to confirm or deny the rumor. He responded, &quot;All Vietnamese people are the children of Uncle Hồ.&quot; When asked again about the rumor in January 2002 by a &quot;Time Asia&quot; reporter, he denied he was Hồ&#x27;s son and stated that his father was named Nông Văn Lại and his mother Hoàng Thị Nhị.

==Early life and political career==
In 1958–61, Nông Đức Mạnh attended the Hanoi Higher School. From 1962–63, he worked as a forestry supervisory technician in the Bắc Kạn Forestry Service. He joined the Communist Party on 5 July 1963 and received full membership on 10 July 1964. From 1963–65, Mạnh was the deputy chief of the Bạch Thông wood exploitation team; he later returned to his studies, learning Russian at the Hanoi Foreign Languages College (from 1965–66). He traveled to Leningrad, where he studied at the Forestry Institute until 1971. After returning to Vietnam, he became the deputy head of the Bắc Thái provincial forestry inspection board.
From 1973–74, Nông Đức Mạnh served as director of the Phú Lương State Forestry Camp in Bắc Thái province. From 1974–76, he studied at the Nguyễn Ái Quốc High-Level Party School. From 1976–80, he served as the deputy director of the provincial forestry service and director of the construction company of the provincial forestry service. Rising through the party ranks, Mạnh was a member of the Bắc Thái Provincial Party Committee from 1976–83. In 1984, he was named deputy secretary of the committee, and in November 1986, the secretary of the committee. At the 6th National Congress he was elected as an alternate member of the Central Committee. At the sixth party plenum in March 1989, he was elevated to full central committee member. Since 1991, he has been in the politburo. From 23 September 1992, he was Chairman of the National Assembly of Vietnam, thereby being one of the youngest when standing on the stage of honor of a Chairman of the National Assembly of Vietnam.

Nông Đức Mạnh was selected General Secretary of the Communist Party in April 2001. His term was renewed in April 2006. He retired on 19 January 2011 after 11th National Congress of the Communist Party of Vietnam. He is the first Vietnamese party head with a university degree. He announced his plans for Vietnam&#x27;s future as an industrialised country, to be completed by 2020.

==Awards and honors==
** Order of José Martí (6 March 2004)
** Order of Friendship (7 February 2000)
** Medal of Pushkin (28 February 2008)

<text>The 1938 Irish presidential election was the first Irish presidential election, held to fill the new office of President of Ireland.

==Procedure==
The office of president was established by Article 12 of the new Constitution of Ireland, which came into force on 29 December 1937. Article 57 of the Constitution provided that the president would enter office not later than 180 days after that date. Until the inauguration of the first president, the powers and functions of the office were carried out by a Presidential Commission consisting of the Chief Justice, the President of the High Court and the Ceann Comhairle.

On 14 April 1938, Minister for Local Government and Public Health Seán T. O&#x27;Kelly made an order under section 6 of the Presidential Elections Act 1937 opening nominations, with noon on 4 May as the deadline for nominations, and 31 May set as the date for a poll (if any).

Under Article 12, candidates could be nominated by:
*at least twenty of the 198 serving members of the Houses of the Oireachtas, or
*at least four of 31 councils of the administrative counties, including county boroughs.

All Irish citizens on the Dáil electoral register were eligible to vote.

==Nomination process==
The first candidate to seek a nomination was Alfie Byrne, who had been serving as Lord Mayor of Dublin since 1930, and would continue in that position until 1939.

On 21 April, representatives of the two major parties, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, met and agreed to nominate Douglas Hyde for the office. The following day, Labour Party leader William Norton expressed his approval in the Dáil of the nomination of Hyde, and Alfie Byrne issued a statement ending his nomination campaign.

At the close of nominations, Hyde was the only nominated candidate, with two separate nomination forms received on behalf of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael Oireachtas members. Accepting the nominations and his election to office on 4 May, Hyde said, &quot;I accept this office willingly, but with humility. I will do my best to carry out my duties in the future&quot;.

==Result==
After the close of nominations on 4 May, the election scheduled for 31 May was cancelled as superfluous, and 1 June was set as the date of Hyde&#x27;s inauguration as President. However, on 27 May, the 9th Dáil was dissolved and a general election called for 17 June. Since the Constitution mandates that members of the Dáil be present when the President takes his oath of office, the inauguration was postponed until 25 June.

<text>Woolsthorpe-by-Colsterworth (to distinguish it from Woolsthorpe-by-Belvoir in the same county) is a hamlet in the South Kesteven district of Lincolnshire, England, within the civil parish of Colsterworth. It is best known as the birthplace of Sir Isaac Newton.

Woolsthorpe-by-Colsterworth is northwest of the village of Colsterworth on the A1 road. Woolsthorpe is three miles from the county boundary with Leicestershire and four miles from the county boundary with Rutland.

Woolsthorpe lies in rural surroundings. It sits on Lower Lincolnshire Limestone, below which are the Lower Estuarine Series and the Northampton sand of the Inferior Oolite Series of the Jurassic period. The Northampton Sand here is cemented by iron and in the 20th century the hamlet was almost surrounded by strip mining for iron ore. In 1973 the local quarries closed due to competition from imported iron ore. The same year the Great Northern Railway&#x27;s High Dyke branch line closed it was opened in 1916 to carry iron ore, and lay to the north of the village. There was an unsuccessful attempt to preserve the line. 

Woolsthorpe Manor, Newton&#x27;s birthplace, is a typical 17th-century yeoman farmer&#x27;s limestone house, with later farmyard buildings. It is owned by the National Trust and is open to the public.

<text>The 1945 Irish presidential election was held on Thursday, 14 June 1945. It was Ireland&#x27;s first contested presidential election. Outgoing president Douglas Hyde, who had served since 1938, decided not to seek a second term. Fianna Fáil nominated its deputy leader, Tánaiste Seán T. O&#x27;Kelly, as its candidate. Fine Gael nominated Seán Mac Eoin. Independent republican Patrick McCartan sought and failed to receive the necessary four nominations from local councils, but secured a nomination from Oireachtas members.

O&#x27;Kelly won on the second count but the degree of voting transfers between the two opposition candidates, and O&#x27;Kelly&#x27;s failure to win on the first count, showed the depth of growing opposition to Éamon de Valera&#x27;s government and the potential that existed for cooperation among various opposition groups. De Valera&#x27;s government was defeated in the subsequent 1948 general election and replaced by the first inter-party government.

The election took place on the same date as the 1945 local elections. Electoral law was amended to allow administrative counties and county boroughs to be used as constituencies instead of using Dáil constituencies, as previously required. This was to facilitate sorting and counting of ballots with ballots for the local elections.

==Nomination process==
Under Article 12 of the Constitution of Ireland, candidates could be nominated by:
*at least twenty of the 198 serving members of the Houses of the Oireachtas, or
*at least four of 31 councils of the administrative counties, including county boroughs, or
*themselves, in the case of a former or retiring president.

All Irish citizens on the Dáil electoral register were eligible to vote.

The first candidate nominated was Seán Mac Eoin, a Fine Gael TD who was nominated on 5 May by 17 members of his own party, as well as three independent TDs, Alfie Byrne, Tom O&#x27;Reilly and Richard Anthony. Seán T. O&#x27;Kelly was nominated by Fianna Fáil Oireachtas members on 15 May. On the date before nominations closed on 16 May, the administrative council of the Labour Party voted to allow its Oireachtas members to sign the nomination form of Patrick McCartan, and Clann na Talmhan voted that its Oireachtas members would sign his nomination form, together guaranteeing his position on the ballot.

==Result==


===Results by local authority===
Results were announced by county councils and county borough corporations rather than by constituency.

<text>Earl J. Doherty (born 1941) is a Canadian author of &quot;The Jesus Puzzle&quot; (1999), &quot;Challenging the Verdict&quot; (2001), and &quot;Jesus: Neither God Nor Man&quot; (2009). Doherty argues for a version of the Christ myth theory, the thesis that Jesus did not exist as a historical figure. Doherty says that Paul thought of Jesus as a spiritual being executed in a spiritual realm.

==Education==
Doherty has stated he has a bachelor&#x27;s degree in Ancient History and Classical Languages, but no completed advanced degrees. His undergraduate studies gave him knowledge of Greek and Latin, to which he has added a basic knowledge of Hebrew and Syriac.

==Writings==
Doherty was introduced to the idea of a mythical origin of Jesus by, among other things, the work of G. A. Wells, who has authored a number of books arguing a moderate form of the &quot;Christ myth&quot; theory. In 1999, Doherty&#x27;s book &quot;The Jesus Puzzle: Did Christianity Begin with a Mythical Christ?&quot; was published by Canadian Humanist Publications. He self-published a 2005 re-release of &quot;The Jesus Puzzle&quot; under his own imprint, Age of Reason Publications, along with two other books. &quot;Challenging the Verdict&quot; (2001) is a critique of &quot;The Case for Christ&quot;, a book of Christian apologetics by author Lee Strobel. &quot;Jesus: Neither God Nor Man - The Case for a Mythical Jesus&quot; (2009) is a revised and expanded version of &quot;The Jesus Puzzle&quot;. In 2012, Doherty published &quot;The End of an Illusion: How Bart Ehrman&#x27;s&quot; &quot;Did Jesus Exist?&quot; &quot;Has Laid the Case for an Historical Jesus to Rest.&quot;

Doherty asserts that Christianity began with a belief in a spiritual, mythical figure, that the Gospels are essentially allegory and fiction, and that no single identifiable person named Jesus lay at the root of the Galilean preaching tradition.&quot; Doherty argues in &quot;The Jesus Puzzle&quot; (2005) and &quot;Jesus: Neither God nor Man—The Case for a Mythical Jesus&quot; (2009) that Jesus originated as a myth derived from Middle Platonism with some influence from Jewish mysticism, and that belief in a historical Jesus emerged only among Christian communities in the 2nd century.

According to Doherty, none of the major Christian apologists before 180 AD, except for Justin and Aristides of Athens, included an account of a historical Jesus in their defenses of Christianity. Instead Doherty suggests that the early Christian writers describe a Christian movement grounded in Platonic philosophy and Hellenistic Judaism, reaching the worship of a monotheistic Jewish god and what he calls a &quot;logos-type Son&quot;. Doherty further argues that Theophilus of Antioch (c. 163–182), Athenagoras of Athens (c. 133–190), Tatian the Assyrian (c. 120–180), and Marcus Minucius Felix (writing around 150–270) offer no indication that they believed in a historical figure crucified and resurrected, and that the name Jesus does not appear in any of them.

===&quot;The Jesus Puzzle&quot;===
Doherty has used the title &quot;The Jesus Puzzle&quot; for four different works.

* In Fall 1997, the &quot;Journal of Higher Criticism&quot; published his article, &quot;The Jesus Puzzle: Pieces in a Puzzle of Christian Origins.&quot; 
* Around the same time he created a website under the same title, in which he developed the material which he was later to publish in book form. His method was to publish a fairly crude first draft, and then omit material that proved untenable, while retaining the general direction of argument. The site continued to be used for additional commentary and responses to reviews and criticisms of his work. 
* Doherty&#x27;s non-fiction book &quot;The Jesus Puzzle: Did Christianity Begin with a Mythical Christ?&quot; was published two years later.
* He also used the title for a novel which he provided for download on his website.

In all four of these works, Doherty presents views on the origins of Christianity, specifically promoting the view that Jesus is a mythical figure rather than a historical person. Doherty argues that Paul and other writers of the earliest existing proto-Christian Gnostic documents did not believe in Jesus as a person who incarnated on Earth in a historical setting. Rather, they believed in Jesus as a heavenly being who suffered his sacrificial death in the lower spheres of heaven at the hands of the demon spirits, and was subsequently resurrected by God. This Christ myth was not based on a tradition reaching back to a historical Jesus, but on the Old Testament exegesis in the context of Jewish-Hellenistic religious syncretism heavily influenced by Middle Platonism, and what the authors believed to be mystical visions of a risen Jesus.

Doherty says that the Jesus myth was given a historical setting only by the second generation of Christians, somewhere between the 1st and 2nd century. He further says that even the author of the Gospel of Mark probably did not consider his gospel to be a literal work of history, but an allegorical midrashic composition based on the Old Testament prophecies. In the widely supported two-source hypothesis, the story of Mark was later fused with a separate tradition of anonymous sayings embodied in the Q document into the other gospels. According to Doherty, the Q-authors may have regarded themselves as &quot;spokespersons for the Wisdom of God,&quot; with Jesus being the embodiment of this Wisdom. In time, the gospel-narrative of this embodiment of Wisdom became interpreted as the literal history of the life of Jesus. Doherty denies any historical value of the Acts of the Apostles, and refers to works by John Knox, Joseph B. Tyson, J.C. O&#x27;Neill, Burton L. Mack and Richard Pervo in dating Acts into the 2nd century and regarding it as largely based on legend.

In 2009, Doherty self-published a revised edition of his book, with a new title of &quot;Jesus: Neither God nor Man&quot;, expanded by incorporating the rebuttals to criticisms received since 1999 and accumulated on his website.

==Reception==
Among authors sympathetic to the view that Jesus never existed, Doherty&#x27;s work has received mixed reactions. &quot;The Jesus Puzzle&quot; has received favorable reviews from fellow mythicists Robert M. Price and Richard Carrier. Frank Zindler, former editor of &quot;American Atheist&quot;, in a review of &quot;The Jesus Puzzle&quot; described it as &quot;the most compelling argument against the historical Jesus published in my life-time&quot;.

George Albert Wells, who now argues a more moderate form of the Christ myth and who rejects Doherty&#x27;s view that the mythical Jesus of Paul did not also descend to Earth, has nonetheless described &quot;The Jesus Puzzle&quot; as an &quot;important book&quot;. R. Joseph Hoffmann considers that there are &quot;reasons for scholars to hold&quot; the view that Jesus never existed, but considers Doherty &quot;A &#x27;disciple&#x27; of Wells&quot; who &quot;has rehashed many of the former’s views in &quot;The Jesus Puzzle&quot; (Age of Reason Publications, 2005) which is qualitatively and academically far inferior to anything so far written on the subject&quot;. Doherty has responded that his work owes very little to Wells.

Writers who do not necessarily support the hypothesis that Jesus did not exist have found merit in some of Doherty&#x27;s arguments. Hector Avalos has written that &quot;&quot;The Jesus Puzzle&quot; outlines a plausible theory for a completely mythical Jesus.&quot;

Bart Ehrman, an expert on textual criticism of the NT and Early Christianity, has dismissed &quot;Jesus, Neither God nor Man&quot; as &quot;filled with so many unguarded and undocumented statements and claims, and so many misstatements of fact, that it would take a 2,400-page book to deal with all the problems... Not a single early Christian source supports Doherty&#x27;s claim that Paul and those before him thought of Jesus as a spiritual, not a human being, who was executed in the spiritual, not the earthly realm.&quot;

In a book criticizing the Christ myth theory, New Testament scholar Maurice Casey describes Doherty as &quot;perhaps the most influential of all the mythicists&quot;, but one who is unable to understand the ancient texts he uses in his arguments.

<text>In the 1952 Irish presidential election the outgoing president Seán T. O&#x27;Kelly was re-elected without a contest.

==Procedure==
Under Article 12 of the Constitution of Ireland, candidates could be nominated by:
*at least twenty of the 207 serving members of the Houses of the Oireachtas, or
*at least four of 31 councils of the administrative counties, including county boroughs, or
*themselves, in the case of a former or retiring president.

All Irish citizens on the Dáil electoral register were eligible to vote.

==Nomination process==
On 25 April 1952, Minister for Local Government made an order under section 6 of the Presidential Elections Act 1937 opening nominations, with noon on 16 May as the deadline for nominations, and 10 June set as the date for a poll (if any).

President Seán T. O&#x27;Kelly nominated himself as a candidate, and when no other candidate was nominated, he was declared elected on 16 May. This was the first occasion on which a president nominated themselves for a second term.

==Result==

O&#x27;Kelly was inaugurated for his second term as President of Ireland on 25 June 1952.

<text>The 1959 Irish presidential election was held on Wednesday,
17 June 1959. Éamon de Valera, then Taoiseach, was elected as president of Ireland. A referendum proposed by de Valera to replace the electoral system of proportional representation by means of the single transferable vote with first-past-the-post voting which was held on the same day was defeated by 48.2% to 51.8%.

==Nomination process==
Under Article 12 of the Constitution of Ireland, a candidate for president may be nominated by:
*at least twenty of the then 207 serving members of the Houses of the Oireachtas, or
*at least four of 31 councils of the administrative counties, including county boroughs, or
*themselves, in the case of a former or retiring president.

Outgoing president Seán T. O&#x27;Kelly had served two terms and was ineligible to serve again. On 27 April, the Minister for Local Government signed the ministerial order opening nominations, with noon on 19 May as the deadline for nominations, and 17 June set as the date for a contest. All Irish citizens on the Dáil electoral register were eligible to vote.

Éamon de Valera, who had served as President of Dáil Éireann and President of the Irish Republic from 1919 to 1922 during the Irish revolutionary period, as President of the Executive Council from 1932 to 1937, and as Taoiseach from 1937 to 1948, from 1951 to 1954, and again from 1957 until he was elected president, was nominated by Fianna Fáil on 12 May. He had served as Fianna Fáil&#x27;s leader since its foundation in 1926.

Seán Mac Eoin, a Fine Gael TD who had been the party&#x27;s candidate in the 1945 presidential election, was nominated again by the party on 15 May.

During the campaign, the far-right micro-party Lia Fáil called on its followers to support Seán Mac Eoin over de Valera. The party gave 25 reasons for this position, with some of those reasons being that de Valera &quot;was an alien&quot; (de Valera had been born in the United States, but had been raised and living in Ireland since the age of 2), was a puppet of the British, that he was &quot;the darling&quot; of Protestants, Freemasons and the British Army, and that &quot;his satanic lust for power motivates every act of his life&quot;. The paper&#x27;s reasons for supporting Mac Eoin were because he was &quot;an honest-to-God Irishman of our flesh and blood whose father and mother we know&quot; and his military background.

Patrick McCartan, who had also been a candidate in the 1945 election and had served as a senator for Clann na Poblachta from 1948 to 1951, was nominated by two county councils only, short of the four required for nomination. Eoin O&#x27;Mahony also sought and failed to secure a nomination by county councils.

Éamon de Valera was inaugurated as president on 25 June.

<text>The 1966 Irish presidential election was held on Wednesday 1 June 1966, and was contested between the incumbent president Éamon de Valera, representing Fianna Fáil, and Tom O&#x27;Higgins of Fine Gael. De Valera, one of the most prominent figures in 20th-century Irish politics and figurehead of Ireland&#x27;s , sought a second term at the age of 83, while O&#x27;Higgins represented a younger generation seeking political change. The election was notable for its extremely narrow outcome, with de Valera winning by a slim margin of just 10,717 votes (50.5% to 49.5%). The election held symbolic significance, occurring not only on the 50th anniversary of the 1916 Easter Rising (an event in which de Valera had been a prominent leader) but also in the wake of the 1960 United States presidential election, where the young, charismatic Irish-American Catholic John F. Kennedy was the victor. Both events influenced the election and helped shape the narrative that the election was a battle between Ireland&#x27;s different generations. 

==Nomination process==
Under Article 12 of the Constitution of Ireland, a candidate for president may be nominated by:
*at least twenty of the 204 serving members of the Houses of the Oireachtas, or
*at least four of 31 councils of the administrative counties, including county boroughs, or
*themselves, in the case of a former or retiring president.

On 27 April, the Minister for Local Government made the order for the presidential election, with noon on 10 May as the date for nominations, and 1 June as the date of polling.

===Fianna Fáil===
As president, Éamon de Valera had the right to nominate himself for a second term, but he chose to be nominated by Fianna Fáil, the party he had led from 1926 until his election in 1959. Then Fianna Fáil leader and Taoiseach Seán Lemass had urged de Valera not to retire, as he had been considering. De Valera&#x27;s campaign manager was Charles Haughey, later to become Fianna Fáil leader and Taoiseach.

===Fine Gael===

Before the election, O&#x27;Higgins unsuccessfully proposed that Fine Gael nominate Seán MacBride to challenge the incumbent, Éamon de Valera. MacBride was not a member of Fine Gael but had worked with the party during the 1950s, serving as Minister for External Affairs in the Inter-Party Government led by Fine Gael’s John A. Costello. MacBride&#x27;s involvement with Fine Gael had been strategic, allowing him to advance his policy agenda while maintaining his independence from the party’s core ideology. MacBride’s background was firmly rooted in Irish republicanism: he was a prominent figure in the Irish Republican Army (IRA) during the 1920s and the son of Maud Gonne and John MacBride, both influential figures in the independence movement. This background gave him significant republican credentials, which some in Fine Gael saw as an asset for countering Éamon de Valera’s own republican legacy. By suggesting MacBride as a candidate, O’Higgins and others within Fine Gael aimed to present a challenger who could contend with de Valera on Irish nationalism. However, the idea of Fine Gael running a republican was inherently a fundamentally contentious one, and was rejected. 

After the MacBride suggestion was declined, O&#x27;Higgins encouraged former Taoiseach John A. Costello to enter the race before ultimately being persuaded to stand as Fine Gael&#x27;s candidate himself. Gerard Sweetman served as his election director.

Although O&#x27;Higgins was seen as a young liberal, his family background was steeped in Fine Gael tradition and conservativism. His father Thomas F. O&#x27;Higgins, his brother Michael, his sister-in-law Brigid Hogan-O&#x27;Higgins, and his uncle Kevin had all been elected to the Dáil for Fine Gael or its predecessor Cumann na nGaedheal. Both his father and uncle had also served as cabinet ministers. Additionally, one of his great-grandfathers, Timothy Daniel Sullivan, was a Fenian poet and nationalist. 

===Independent Bids===
Independent broadcaster and genealogist Eoin &quot;the Pope&quot; O&#x27;Mahony, who had sought and failed to be nominated in 1959, tried again, unsuccessfully. He wrote to local authorities and was allowed to address eleven. He fell short of the requisite four nominations: only North Tipperary County Council vote in his favour, and later reversed the decision; Wicklow County Council fell one vote short.

==Campaign==
===RTÉ decision not to cover campaign===
O&#x27;Higgins&#x27; campaign was met with immediate difficulty when, at the outset, de Valera declared that he would not conduct a campaign himself, believing that the office of President should be above party politics. In response, Ireland&#x27;s national radio and television broadcaster RTÉ decided it could not (or would not), cover O&#x27;Higgins campaigning as this would be unbalanced in their view. Fine Gael leader Liam Cosgrove responded by arguing that this was unjust, as although de Valera was not formally campaigning, he regularly appeared on RTÉ radio and television in his capacity as president. RTÉ, however, did not change its position.

===JFK-influenced O&#x27;Higgins campaign===
O&#x27;Higgins carried out a grassroots campaign that saw him attend over 130 public meetings across the Republic of Ireland, covering an estimated 22,000 miles around the country over 5 weeks, reportedly attending as many as 3 rallies a night. Fine Gael presented O&#x27;Higgins and his wife Terry as Irish analogues of John Fitzgerald Kennedy and his wife Jackie Kennedy, emphasising their comparative youth to the elderly de Valera. Campaign ads for O&#x27;Higgins prominently featured images of O&#x27;Higgins surrounded by Terry and their 7 children in shots designed to evoke the spirit of Camelot that had earned the Kennedys much popularity earlier in the decade. The general thrust of the O&#x27;Higgins campaign was that O&#x27;Higgins represented the future in contrast to the nostalgia of de Valera. Campaign manager Gerald Sweetman described the O&#x27;Higgins campaign as expressing &quot;the need for a youthful, forward looking president to personify the real Ireland and what it can best contribute to modern civilisation&quot;. 

An example of the O&#x27;Higgins attempting to emulate modern American politics could be seen on 28 May 1966, when a small light aircraft dropped ballons with Fine Gael slogans on them down onto the city of Limerick during an O&#x27;Higgins motorcade procession. Observing these new tactics, the journalist John Healy of &quot;the Irish Times&quot; observed &quot;The Fine Gael tail is up. It is running as it has not run for a long time. It will be an interesting finish indeed&quot;. 

===De Valera response===
Polling was not yet a feature of Irish politics in 1966; instead parties still generally relied on their constituency branches to provide a sense of grassroots sentiment. When Fianna Fáil received feedback from their branches about the O&#x27;Higgins campaign, they became highly concerned. Although de Valera remained officially committed to not campaigning, he began to make several public appearances on the pretence of commemorating 1916. De Valera&#x27;s campaign manager was then Minister for Agriculture and future leader of Fianna Fáil Charles Haughey. Responding to the momentum of the O&#x27;Higgins campaign, Haughey announced £5.5 million in spending targeted at farmers just five days before voting began. Fianna Fáil leader and de Valera protege Sean Lemass declared that a de Valera victory would be &quot;an affirmation by the people that the aims for our country which have directed him throughout his life remain constant, and that patriotism is as relevant in the island of 1966 as it was in 1916&quot;.

==Result==



==Aftermath==
The President expressed his satisfaction at securing victory in his final election, remarking, &quot;even though it was only by a short head,&quot; and explained his decision not to nominate himself. He emphasised that doing so would have been disingenuous, as no one could realistically expect to win the presidency without the support of a political party or organisation. Seán Lemass interpreted the result as a &quot;tribute to a man who had rendered exceptional national service&quot; and a clear indication of the people&#x27;s confidence in his ability to carry out the presidential duties in a manner that would reflect positively on the nation.

In his autobiography, &quot;A Double Life&quot;, O&#x27;Higgins reflected decades later on his performance in the 1966 presidential race: He believed he had conducted himself honourably and maintained his integrity throughout the contest. He wrote that the election was &quot;a close-run thing&quot;, invoking the words used by the Duke of Wellington to describe his victory at Waterloo.

<doc id="201103" wikidata="Q78513" url="?curid=201103" title="Otto Weininger">
<text>Otto Weininger (; 3 April 1880 – 4 October 1903) was an Austrian philosopher who lived in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. In 1903, he published the book &quot;Geschlecht und Charakter&quot; (&quot;Sex and Character&quot;), which gained popularity after his suicide at the age of 23. Parts of his work were adapted for use by the Nazi regime. Weininger had a strong influence on Ludwig Wittgenstein, August Strindberg, and, via his lesser-known work &quot;Über die letzten Dinge&quot;, on James Joyce.

== Life ==

Otto Weininger was born on 3 April 1880 in Vienna, a son of the Jewish goldsmith Leopold Weininger and his wife Adelheid. After attending primary school and graduating from secondary school in July 1898, Weininger registered at the University of Vienna in October of the same year. He studied philosophy and psychology but took courses in natural sciences and medicine as well. Weininger learned Greek, Latin, French and English very early, later also Spanish and Italian, and acquired passive knowledge of Swedish, Danish and Norwegian. While he was at the university, he would attend the Philosophical Society, where he heard, among others, Richard Wagner&#x27;s son-in-law Houston Stewart Chamberlain, who was regarded as an outsider but an original thinker. 

In the autumn of 1901, Weininger tried to find a publisher for his work &quot;Eros and the Psyche: A biological-psychological study&quot;, which he submitted to his professors Friedrich Jodl and as his thesis in 1902. He met Sigmund Freud, who did not, however, recommend the text to a publisher. His professors accepted the thesis and Weininger received his Ph.D. degree in July 1902. Shortly thereafter he became a Protestant.

In 1902 Weininger went to Bayreuth, where he witnessed a performance of Richard Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Parsifal&quot;, which impressed him deeply. Via Dresden and Copenhagen he made his way to Christiania (Oslo), where he saw for the first time Henrik Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;Peer Gynt&quot; on stage. Upon his return to Vienna, Weininger suffered from fits of deep depression. The decision to take his own life gradually took shape; after a long discussion with his friend Artur Gerber, however, Weininger realized that &quot;it is not yet time&quot;.

In June 1903, after months of concentrated work, his book &quot;Sex and Character: A Fundamental Investigation&quot; – an attempt &quot;to place sex relations in a new and decisive light&quot; – was published by the Vienna publishers Braumüller &amp; Co. The book contained his thesis to which three vital chapters were added: (XII) &quot;The Nature of Woman and her Relation to the Universe&quot;, (XIII) &quot;Judaism&quot;, (XIV) &quot;Women and Humanity&quot;.

Although the book&#x27;s reception was not negative, it did not create the expected stir. Weininger was attacked by Paul Julius Möbius, professor in Leipzig and author of the book &quot;On the Physiological Deficiency of Women&quot; and was accused of plagiarizing. Deeply disappointed and seemingly depressed, Weininger left for Italy.

Back in Vienna, he spent his last five days with his parents. On 3 October, he took a room in the house at Schwarzspanierstraße 15, where Ludwig van Beethoven had died. He told the landlady that he was not to be disturbed before morning, since he planned to work and then to go to bed late. That night he wrote two letters, one to his father and the other to his brother Richard, telling them that he was going to shoot himself.

On 4 October, Weininger was found mortally wounded, having shot himself in the chest. He died in the Wiener Allgemeines Krankenhaus (Vienna General Hospital) and was buried in the Matzleinsdorf Protestant Cemetery in Vienna.

==&quot;Sex and Character: A Fundamental Investigation&quot;==

===Masculinity and femininity===
&quot;Sex and Character&quot; argues that all people are composed of a mixture of male and female substance, and attempts to support this view scientifically. The male aspect is active, productive, conscious and moral/logical, while the female aspect is passive, unproductive, unconscious and amoral/alogical. Weininger argues that emancipation is only possible for the &quot;masculine woman&quot;, for example some lesbians, and that the female life is consumed with the sexual function, both with the act, as a prostitute, and the product, as a mother. The woman is a &quot;matchmaker&quot;. By contrast, the duty of the male, or the masculine aspect of personality, is to strive to become a genius and to forgo sexuality for an abstract love of the absolute, God, which he finds within himself.

A significant part of his book is about the nature of genius. Weininger argues that genius never applies solely to a specific field such as mathematics or music, but there is only the universal genius, in whom everything exists and makes sense. He reasons that this quality is probably present in all people to some degree. &quot;Sex and Character&quot; became popular in Italy as an alternative to Freudian psychoanalysis due to the interest it generated among Italian intellectuals such as Steno Tedeschi, who translated the text to Italian.

===Jewish versus Christian character===
In a separate chapter, Weininger, himself a Jew who had converted to Christianity in 1902, analyzes the archetypal Jew as feminine, and thus profoundly irreligious, without true individuality (soul), and without a sense of good and evil. Christianity is described as &quot;the highest expression of the highest faith&quot;, while Judaism is called &quot;the extreme of cowardliness&quot;. Weininger decries the decay of modern times, and attributes much of it to feminine (or identically, &quot;Jewish&quot;) character. By Weininger&#x27;s reckoning &quot;everyone&quot; shows some femininity, and what he calls &quot;Jewishness&quot;.

In the chapter titled &quot;Judaism&quot; in his book &quot;Sex and Character&quot; Weininger, who has himself often been considered a paragon of the &quot;Self-hating Jew&quot; stereotype, writes:
I must, however, make clear what I mean by Judaism; I mean neither a race nor a people nor a recognised creed. I think of it as a tendency of the mind, as a psychological constitution which is a possibility for all mankind, but which has become actual in the most conspicuous fashion only amongst the Jews. ... Thus the fact is explained that the bitterest Antisemites are to be found amongst the Jews themselves. (pp. 303-304)

Further:
The true conception of the State is foreign to the Jew, because he, like the woman, is wanting in personality; his failure to grasp the idea of true society is due to his lack of a free intelligible ego. Like women, Jews tend to adhere together, but they do not associate as free independent individuals mutually respecting each other&#x27;s individuality. 
As there is no real dignity in women, so what is meant by the word &quot;gentleman&quot; does not exist amongst the Jews. The genuine Jew fails in this innate good breeding by which alone individuals honour their own individuality and respect that of others. There is no Jewish nobility, and this is the more surprising as Jewish pedigrees can be traced back for thousands of years. (pp. 307-308)

A subsequent paragraph continues: 
The faults of the Jewish race have often been attributed to the repression of that race by Aryans, and many Christians are still disposed to blame themselves in this respect. But the self-reproach is not justified. Outward circumstances do not mould a race in one direction, unless there is in the race the innate tendency to respond to the moulding forces; the total result comes at least as much from a natural disposition as from the modifying circumstances. ... 
The Jew is not really anti-moral. But, none the less, he does not represent the highest ethical type. He is rather non-moral, neither very good nor very bad. ...
So also in the case of the woman. ...
In the Jew and the woman, good and evil are not distinct from one another. 
Jews, then, do not live as free, self-governing individuals, choosing between virtue and vice in the Aryan fashion. (pp. 308-309)

===Critique of the &quot;Zeitgeist&quot;===
On Jewishness, decadence and femininity:Our age is not only the most Jewish, but also the most effeminate of all ages; an age in which art only provides a sudarium for its moods and which has derived the artistic urge in humans from the games played by animals; an age of the most credulous anarchism, an age without any appreciation of the state and law, an age of species ethics, an age of the shallowest of all imaginable interpretations of history (historical materialism); the age of capitalism, an age of capitalism and marxism, and age for which history, life, science, everything, has become nothing but economics and technology; an age that has declared genius to be a form of madness, but which no longer has one great artist or one great philosopher, an age that is most devoid of originality, but which chases most frantically after originality; an age that has replaced the idea of virginity with the cult of demivierge. &quot;This age has also the distinction of being the first to have not only affirmed and worshipped sexual intercourse, but to have practically made it a duty&quot;, not as a way of achieving oblivion, as the Romans or the Greeks did in their bacchanals, but in order to find itself and to give its own dreariness a meaning.

===Translations into English===
&quot;Sex and Character&quot; has been translated into English twice, in 1906 and in 2005; the two translations are listed below under &quot;Sources&quot;. According to Allan Janik, the 1906 translation is &quot;truly wretched,&quot; &quot;bowdlerized,&quot; &quot;truncated,&quot; and &quot;distorted,&quot; &quot;concealing considerably more than it revealed about Weininger.&quot; Janik adds that Ludwig Wittgenstein condemned it as &quot;beastly&quot;. The 2005 translation, by contrast, Janik finds &quot;exemplary.&quot;

==Reactions to suicide==
Weininger&#x27;s suicide in the house where Beethoven had diedthe man he considered one of the greatest geniuses of allmade him a &quot;cause célèbre&quot;, inspired several imitation suicides, and generated interest in his book. The book received glowing reviews by Swedish author August Strindberg, who wrote that it had &quot;probably solved the hardest of all problems&quot;, the &quot;woman problem&quot;. The book furthermore attracted the attention of Russian philosopher Nikolai Berdyaev, who claimed that &quot;after Nietzsche there was nothing already in this [contemporary German] fleeting culture so remarkable.&quot;

== Influence on Wittgenstein ==
Ludwig Wittgenstein read the book as a schoolboy and was deeply impressed by it, later listing it as one of his influences and recommending it to friends. Wittgenstein is recalled as saying that he thought Weininger was &quot;a great genius&quot;. However, Wittgenstein&#x27;s deep admiration of Weininger&#x27;s thought was coupled with a fundamental disagreement with his position. Wittgenstein writes to G. E. Moore: &quot;It isn&#x27;t necessary or rather not possible to agree with him but the greatness lies in that with which we disagree. It is his enormous mistake which is great.&quot; In the same letter to Moore, Wittgenstein added that if one were to add a negation sign before the whole of &quot;Sex and Character&quot;, one would have expressed an important truth.

== Weininger and the Nazis ==
Isolated parts of Weininger&#x27;s writings were used by Nazi propaganda, despite the fact that Weininger actively argued against the ideas of race that came to be identified with the Nazis. In his private conversations, Hitler recalled a remark his mentor Dietrich Eckart made about Weininger: &quot;I only knew one decent Jew and he committed suicide on the day when he realized that the Jew lives upon the decay of peoples...&quot;

More generally, Weininger&#x27;s views are considered an important step in attempts to exclude women and Jews from society based on methodical philosophy, in an era valuing human equality and scientific thought.

In her book &quot;Nazi Ideology Prior to 1933&quot;, Barbara Miller Lane shows how Nazi ideologists such as Dietrich Eckart disregarded Weininger&#x27;s deprecation of accusations against individual Jews, and instead simply stated that Jews, like women, lacked a soul and have a belief in immortality, and that &quot;Aryans&quot; must guard themselves from &quot;Jewishness&quot; within, since this internal &quot;Jewishness&quot; is the source of evil.

== Weininger and &quot;Jewish self-hatred&quot; ==
Allan Janik, in &quot;Viennese Culture and the Jewish Self-Hatred Hypothesis: A Critique&quot;, questions the validity of the concept of &quot;Jewish self-hatred&quot;, even when applied to Weininger, reputedly &quot;the thinker who nearly everyone has taken to represent the very archetype of the self-hating Viennese Jewish intellectual&quot;. Janik places responsibility for this reputation upon Peter Gay. Janik doubts that such a concept as &quot;Jewish self-hatred&quot; is applicable to Weininger in any case, because, although he was of Jewish descent, &quot;it is less than clear that he had a Jewish identity&quot; to reject. In Janik&#x27;s view, Gay misunderstands the role of religion in Jewish identity and &quot;seems to smuggle in a whole lot of covert theological baggage in secularized form&quot;, resulting in &quot;a piece of covert metaphysics parading as social science&quot;.

== Portrayals ==
Weininger is played by Paulus Manker in Ildikó Enyedi&#x27;s &quot;My 20th Century&quot; (1989).

<doc id="201105" wikidata="Q6365528" url="?curid=201105" title="Kanto (music)">
<text>Kanto () is a popular genre of Turkish music.

==Terminology==
Italian opera and theater had a profound effect on Turkish culture during the early 20th century. The terminology of music and theater derived from Italian. In the argot of the improvisational theater of Istanbul the stage was called &quot;sahano&quot;, backstage was referred to as &quot;koyuntu&quot;, backdrops depicting countryside as &quot;bosko&quot;, the applause as &quot;furi&quot;, and the songs sung as solos or duets between the acts and plays were called &quot;kanto&quot;. As was the case with their Italian counterparts, the Turkish troupe members played songs and music before the show and between the acts to pique people&#x27;s interest and draw in customers. Kanto were based on traditional eastern makam but performed with Western instruments.

==Theatrical origins==
The improvised theatrical pieces were stage adaptations of the Karagöz (shadow puppet) and (form of Turkish theatre performed in the open air) traditions, although in a simplified form. The themes explored in these traditional theater arts (as well as their stereotypes) were used as the framework for the new extemporaneous performances of the tuluat (&quot;improvised&quot;) theater. In this way, kanto may be considered as the unifying feature of all tuluat theater.

==Periods==
Kanto is usually divided into two periods. The division, particularly in terms of musical structure, is clear between the early kanto (1900s–1923) and the kanto of the Post-Republican period (especially after the mid-1930s). It is further possible to identify two styles within the early period: Galata and Direklerarası (after the neighbourhoods of Old Istanbul).

===Early period: 1900s–mid-1930s===
The early period kanto tradition was nourished in Istanbul. The same was also true in the Post-Republican period. The city&#x27;s large and diverse population provided the themes that were the mainstay of kanto. Kanto was heavily influenced by musical theatre, Balkan and Byzantine or Anatolian music (Karsilamas) (which was however often a subject of satire in kanto songs) and Greek music (Kalamatiano, Ballos, Syrtos) (especially the Istanbul Rum who were so fond of urban forms of entertainment). In other words, kanto was the result of cultural exchange and almost all the early kanto singers were either Rum or Armenian: Pepron, Karakas, Haim, Shamiram Kelleciyan, and Peruz Terzekyan (all of them performed during the period following 1903).

====Galata and Direklerarası====
Galata was the part of Istanbul where sailors, rowdies, and roustabouts used to frequent. Ahmet Rasim Bey gives a vivid picture of the Galata theaters in his novel Fuhs-i Akit &quot;An Old Whore&quot;:

&quot;Everyone thought Peruz was the most flirtatious, most skillful and the most provocative. The seats closest to the stage were always crammed full... They said of Peruz, &#x27;she is a trollop who has ensnared the heart of many a young man and has made herself the enemy of many. &#x27;Her songs would hardly be finished when chairs, flowers, bouquets and beribboned letters. Come flying from the boxseats. It seemed the building would be shaken to the ground.&quot;

Direklerarası in comparison to Galata was a more refined center of entertainment. Direklerarası was said to be quite lively at night during the month of Ramadan (or Ramazan in Turkish). It was there that the troupes of Kel Hasan and Abdi Efendi and later that of Neshid gained popularity. Under the influence of these masters kanto had its golden years.

The troupes&#x27; orchestras featured instruments such as the trumpet, the trombone, the violin, the trap drum and cymbals. The orchestra would start to play contemporary popular songs and marches about an hour before the beginning of main show. This intermission music ended up with the well known İzmir Marşı (Izmir March); a sign that the show time was approaching. The play began as soon as the musicians had taken their places at the side of the stage.

Prominent artists include: Peruz, Shamran, Kamelya, Eleni, Küçük and Büyük Amelya, Mari Ferha and Virjin.

====1923–mid-1930s: decline in popularity====
After the 1923 formation of the Turkish Republic, there were changes in the cultural life of Turkey. It was a period of rapid transformation and its effects were widespread. Turkish women had finally won the freedom to appear on the stage, breaking the monopoly previously held by Rûm (Istanbul Greek) and Armenian women who performed both in musical and non-musical theatre. Institutions such as Darulbedayi (Istanbul City Theatre) and Darulelhan (Istanbul Conservatory of Music) had trained musicians that turned out to work as kanto artists.

Before the 1930s, Western lifestyle and western art had put pressure on the traditional Turkish formats which were marginalized. The operetta, the tango and later the charleston, and the foxtrot overshadowed kanto. Kanto&#x27;s popularity began to fade, the centers of entertainment shifted and the theaters of Galata and Direklerarası were eventually closed. Turkish female artists who were not receptive to kanto&#x27;s typical ribaldry chose to turn away from it.

====Themes====
The kanto singers of this period were also composers. The songs had simple melodies combined with lyrics that described the tensions between men and women, or explored love themes, or just reflected local events of the time. The compositions were in well-known makams such as Rast, Hüzzam, Hicaz, Hüseyni and Nihavent. Kanto songs are remembered both by the names of their interpreters and their creators.

===Late 1930s and beyond===
There occurred a new change of trends after the late 1930s: there was a revival of interest in the kanto form. Although rather far from its fundamental principles a new type of kanto was once again popular. Kanto was not anymore exclusively limited to stage performances; there began to exist records produced in studios. While the lyrics began to include satirical takes on contemporary cultural trends and fashion. The songs were recorded with the 78 rpm phonograph. Columbia was the leading record label that commissioned kanto from Kaptanzade Ali Rıza Bey, Refik Fersan, Dramalı Hasan, Sadettin Kaynak, Cümbüş Mehmet and Mildan Niyazi Bey. The makams were the same but the instrumentation had changed. Kanto were now accompanied by cümbüş (a fretlees banjo-like instrument) the ud (a fretless lute), and calpara (castanets). Foxtrot, charleston, and rumba rhythms were combined with the typical kanto forms.

Female soloists from this period include: Makbule Enver, Mahmure, and Neriman; Beşiktaşlı Kemal Senman was the most sought after male singer for duets.

====Themes====
Among the themes explored by the new kantocu (singer(s) or composer(s) of kanto), the most frequent subject of satire was the new role of women after the formation of the Republic. Songs like &quot;Sarhoş Kızlar&quot; (Drunken Girls) or &quot;Şoför Kadınlar&quot; (Female Drivers) were written in revenge for all the suffering women had endured at the hands of men in the past. Other songs with similar themes include &quot;Daktilo&quot; (The Typewriter) (which brought to mind the newly formed Secretaires Society), &quot;Bereli Kız&quot; (The Girl with the Beret), &quot;Kadın Asker&quot;, and &quot;Olursa&quot; (If Women Were Soldiers).

===Contemporary use of the term===
Kanto had a tremendous impact on contemporary Turkish popular music. However, the word Kanto eventually became more of a generalized umbrella term than a precise definition of a musical genre. Any tune that does not follow any conventions, or any song that appealed to the trends and tastes of the time it is released is labeled kanto. Any music instrumented in a novel way is also labeled kanto.

Nurhan Damcıoğlu is an example of a contemporary (post 1980s) artist labeled as a kanto singer.

=== Rhythms ===
Most rebetiko songs are based on traditional Greek or Anatolian dance rhythms. Most common are:
* Syrtos, a general name for many Greek dances (including the Nisiotika), (mostly a meter in various forms)
* Zeibekiko, a or a meter, in its various forms
* Sirtaki, including various kinds of Greek music. It is also the fast version of &quot;Chasapiko&quot; (like and meter)
* Hasapiko, a meter and the fast version &quot;Hasaposerviko&quot; in a meter
* Antikristos or &quot;Karsilamas&quot; and &quot;Argilamas&quot; (a meter)
* Kamilierikos, a meter) and Aptalikos, broken down in two sixteenths, (slow version a and fast version a meter in various forms)
* Tsifteteli, a dance of women, (a )

<text>The 1973 Irish presidential election was held on Wednesday, 30 May 1973. The outgoing president Éamon de Valera was ineligible for re-election after serving two terms in office. Former Tánaiste Erskine H. Childers, nominated by Fianna Fáil, was elected as president of Ireland, defeating Fine Gael deputy leader, Tom O&#x27;Higgins, who had come within 1% of defeating Éamon de Valera in the 1966 presidential election.

==Nomination process==
Under Article 12 of the Constitution of Ireland, a candidate for president could be nominated by:
*at least twenty of the 204 serving members of the Houses of the Oireachtas, or
*at least four of 31 councils of the administrative counties, including county boroughs.

On 25 April, the Minister for Local Government made the order for the presidential election, with noon on 8 May as the date for nominations, and 30 May as the date of polling.

==Campaign==
O&#x27;Higgins was approved as the Fine Gael candidate on 31 January. Childers was approved as the Fianna Fáil candidate on 6 April. George Colley was director of elections for Childers. O&#x27;Higgins was the early favourite to win, with odds of 1/2, against 6/4 for Childers.

==Result==

<doc id="201108" wikidata="Q4376800" url="?curid=201108" title="1974 Irish presidential election">
<text>The 1974 Irish presidential election resulted from the sudden death in office of President Erskine H. Childers. Cearbhall Ó Dálaigh was elected unopposed as the fifth president of Ireland.

==Nomination process==
Childers died on 17 November 1974. On 21 November, the Minister for Local Government issued a ministerial order setting 3 December as the date for close of nominations and 18 December as the date of the election.

Under Article 12 of the Constitution of Ireland, a candidate for president could be nominated by:
*at least twenty of the 204 serving members of the Houses of the Oireachtas, or
*at least four of 31 councils of the administrative counties, including county boroughs.

==Agreed candidate==
Initially all parties privately agreed to nominate the late president&#x27;s widow, Rita Childers. Before she was informed of the plan, however, a mix-up led to the collapse of the arrangement. A partially deaf Fine Gael Teachta Dála, identified in some reports as Tom O&#x27;Donnell, confirmed the secret arrangement upon mishearing a journalist&#x27;s question asking about the decision of a local council&#x27;s nomination of Childers as president, having assumed that the cross-party decision was made public. Fianna Fáil leader Jack Lynch, thinking the party was set up, subsequently withdrew from the agreement and nominated Cearbhall Ó Dálaigh instead. The parties agreed to the new arrangement due to a number of external factors, including a sluggish economy and The Troubles.

Ó Dálaigh had served as Attorney General from 1951 to 1953, as a judge of the Supreme Court from 1953 to 1973, as Chief Justice from 1961 to 1973, and had been serving as a judge of the European Court of Justice from 1973 at the time of his nomination. All parties agreed to Ó Dálaigh&#x27;s nomination. As no other candidate was nominated, it was not necessary to proceed to a ballot for his election.

==Result==
Ó Dálaigh was inaugurated as president on Thursday, 19 December 1974.

<text>The 1976 Irish presidential election was precipitated by the resignation of President Cearbhall Ó Dálaigh in October 1976. Patrick Hillery was elected unopposed as the sixth president of Ireland.

==Background to the election==
Cearbhall Ó Dálaigh resigned as president soon after an attack on him by Paddy Donegan, the Minister for Defence, in which the minister called the President a &quot;thundering disgrace&quot; for having referred the Emergency Powers Bill 1976 to the Supreme Court. Ó Dálaigh resigned on 22 October after Dáil Éireann supported the minister in a motion of no confidence.

==Nomination process==
Under Article 12 of the Constitution of Ireland, a candidate for president could be nominated by:
*at least twenty of the 204 serving members of the Houses of the Oireachtas, or
*at least four of 31 councils of the administrative counties, including county boroughs, or
*Themselves, if a former or incumbent president.

Fianna Fáil leader Jack Lynch proposed as the party&#x27;s presidential election candidate Patrick Hillery, retiring European Commissioner for Social Affairs and former Minister for External Affairs. Charles Haughey, a critic of Lynch, proposed Joseph Brennan, TD for Donegal–Leitrim and a former Minister for Social Welfare. Hillery easily won the party nomination.

The government parties, Fine Gael and the Labour Party, did not nominate a candidate due to the row over Ó Dálaigh&#x27;s resignation and the government&#x27;s role in it. As no other candidate was nominated, it was not necessary to proceed to a ballot for the election.

==Result==

Patrick Hillery was inaugurated as president on Friday, 3 December.

<text>In the 1983 Irish presidential election outgoing President Patrick Hillery agreed under enormous political pressure to seek a second term. Though former Nobel Peace Prize and Lenin Peace Prize winner Seán MacBride made it known in the &quot;Sunday Press&quot; that he wanted to contest the office, only Hillery was nominated and was declared re-elected without the need for a poll.

==Procedure==
Under Article 12 of the Constitution of Ireland, candidates could be nominated by:
*at least twenty of the 226 serving members of the Houses of the Oireachtas, or
*at least four of 31 councils of the administrative counties, including county boroughs, or
*themselves, in the case of a former or retiring president.

All Irish citizens on the Dáil electoral register were eligible to vote.

==Result==
The Minister for the Environment made the order opening nominations on 7 October, with noon on 21 October as the deadline for nominations, and 23 November set as the date for a contest. The only candidate nominated was Patrick Hillery, who had the right to nominate himself, and he was declared elected at the close of nominations.

Hillery was inaugurated for his second term as President of Ireland on Saturday, 3 December 1983.

<doc id="201112" wikidata="Q708853" url="?curid=201112" title="Mario Bunge">
<text>Mario Augusto Bunge ( ; ; September 21, 1919 – February 24, 2020) was an Argentine-Canadian philosopher and physicist. His philosophical writings combined scientific realism, systemism, materialism, emergentism, and other principles.

He was an advocate of &quot;exact philosophy&quot; and a critic of existentialist, hermeneutical, phenomenological philosophy, and postmodernism. He was popularly known for his opinions against pseudoscience.

==Early and personal life==
Bunge was born on September 21, 1919, in Florida Oeste, Buenos Aires. His mother, Marie Herminie Müser, was a German nurse who left Germany just before the beginning of World War I. His father, Augusto Bunge, also of some German descent, was an Argentine physician and socialist legislator. Mario, who was the couple&#x27;s only child, was raised without any religious education, and enjoyed a happy and stimulating childhood in the outskirts of Buenos Aires.

Bunge had four children: Carlos Federico and Mario Augusto Julio, with ex-wife Julia Delfina Molina y Vedia, and Eric R. and Silvia A., with his wife of over 60 years, the Argentine mathematician Marta Cavallo. Mario lived with Cavallo in Montreal from 1966 until his death, with one-year sabbaticals in other countries.

== Studies and career ==
Bunge began his studies at the National University of La Plata, graduating with a PhD in physico-mathematical sciences in 1952. He was professor of theoretical physics and philosophy, 1956–1966, first at La Plata then at University of Buenos Aires. His international debut was at the 1956 Inter-American Philosophical Congress in Santiago, Chile. He was particularly noticed there by Willard Van Orman Quine, who called Bunge the star of the congress. He was, until his retirement at age 90, the Frothingham Professor of Logic and Metaphysics at McGill University in Montreal, where he had been since 1966.

In a review of Bunge&#x27;s 2016 memoirs, &quot;Between Two Worlds: Memoirs of a Philosopher-Scientist&quot;, James Alcock saw in Bunge &quot;a man of exceedingly high confidence who has lived his life guided by strong principles about truth, science, and justice&quot; and one who is &quot;[impatient] with muddy thinking&quot;.

He became a centenarian in September 2019. A &quot;Festschrift&quot; was published to mark the occasion, with essays by an international collection of scholars. He died in Montreal, Canada, on February 24, 2020, at the age of 100.

== Political views ==
Bunge defined himself as a left-wing liberal and democratic socialist, in the tradition of John Stuart Mill and José Ingenieros. He was a supporter of the Campaign for the Establishment of a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly, an organisation which advocates for democratic reform in the United Nations, and the creation of a more accountable international political system.

==Work==
=== Philosophy ===
Bunge was a prolific intellectual, having written more than 400 papers and 80 books, notably his monumental &quot;Treatise on Basic Philosophy&quot; in eight volumes (1974–1989), a comprehensive and rigorous study of those philosophical aspects Bunge takes to be the core of modern philosophy: semantics, ontology, epistemology, philosophy of science and ethics. In his &quot;Treatise&quot;, Bunge developed a comprehensive scientific outlook which he then applied to the various natural and social sciences.

His work is based on global systemism, emergentism, rationalism, scientific realism, materialism and consequentialism. Bunge repeatedly and explicitly denied being a logical positivist, and wrote on metaphysics.

A variety of scientists and philosophers influenced his thought. Among those thinkers, Bunge explicitly acknowledged the direct influence of his own father, the Argentine physician Augusto Bunge, the Czech physicist Guido Beck, the Argentine mathematician Alberto González Domínguez, the Argentine mathematician, physicist and computer scientist Manuel Sadosky, the Italian sociologist and psychologist Gino Germani, the American sociologist Robert King Merton, and the French-Polish epistemologist Émile Meyerson.

Among many frameworks that Bunge proposed was a five-stage model of the maturation of science from immature to mature : see .

Popularly, he is known for his remarks considering psychoanalysis as an example of pseudoscience. He was critical of the ideas of well known scientists and philosophers such as Karl Popper, Richard Dawkins, Stephen Jay Gould, and Daniel Dennett.

Bunge appreciated some aspects of Popper&#x27;s critical rationalism but found it insufficient as a comprehensive philosophy of science, and instead formulated his own account of scientific realism.
John R. Wettersen, who defined &quot;critical rationalism&quot; more broadly than Popper&#x27;s work, called Bunge&#x27;s theory of science &quot;a version of critical rationalism&quot;.

==== Philosophy of social sciences ====
Bunge addressed issues of theory and method in the social sciences starting with his &quot;Treatise on Basic Philosophy&quot; and later in his career wrote two books entirely focused on the social sciences: &quot;Finding Philosophy in Social Science&quot; (1996) and &quot;Social Science under Debate: A Philosophical Perspective&quot; (1998). In these works he argued for an approach to the study of societies that he called systemism, an alternative to holism and individualism. He was an advocate for what he called mechanismic explanations and defended the view that social mechanisms are processes &quot;in a concrete system, such that it is capable of bringing about or preventing some change in the system as a whole or in some of its subsystems&quot;.

<doc id="201114" wikidata="Q4376802" url="?curid=201114" title="1990 Irish presidential election">
<text>The 1990 Irish presidential election was the tenth presidential election to be held in Ireland, the fifth to be contested by more than one candidate, and the first to have a female candidate and winner. It was held on Wednesday, 7 November 1990 and was won by Mary Robinson on a joint Labour Party and Workers&#x27; Party ticket. The election was the first time in history a Fianna Fáil candidate failed to win the presidency. It was also the first time the Labour Party had contested a presidential election. The election had one of the tightest margins of victory in Irish presidential elections history, and the final leg of the campaign was characterised by intense internal turmoil within the Fianna Fáil party as well as personal attacks on the candidates from competing political parties. The election was considered a political failure for the Fine Gael party and would cause their leader, Alan Dukes, to resign in the immediate aftermath.

One of the central issues during the campaign was whether the role of the President should be expanded or not, with Robinson and Currie arguing it should while Lenihan argued against it. In the years following Robinson&#x27;s election, she would transform the position into a much more visible and influential position in Irish politics.

==Nomination procedure==
Under Article 12 of the Constitution of Ireland, a candidate for president could be nominated by:
*at least twenty of the 226 serving members of the Houses of the Oireachtas, or
*at least four of 31 county councils or county boroughs, or
*a former or retiring president, on their own nomination.

The outgoing president, Patrick Hillery, had served the maximum of two terms, and no other former president was living.

The deadline for nominations was 16 October 1990.

==Nomination campaigns==
===Labour and the Workers&#x27; Party===
In January 1990, Labour leader Dick Spring publicly stated his belief that the Labour Party needed to run a serious candidate in the election and that if no other candidate could be found, he himself would run.

The first viable candidate Labour sought was Mary Robinson; with her background in both the Seanad and her legal work, both of which saw her fighting for causes such as women&#x27;s and minority rights, Robinson seem to have excellent credentials for the role of President. However, a major stumbling block towards recruiting Robinson was her reluctance to rejoin/reaffiliate with the Labour Party. This delay in the recruitment of Robinson allowed for a second contender to emerge in the Labour camp: Dr Noel Browne.

Noël Browne was a politician who had first emerged into Irish politics as a member of Clann na Poblachta and a Minister for Health in his very first term as a Teachta Dala as part of the first &quot;interparty&quot; government of 1948. Browne was initially lauded for his successful crusade against Tuberculous in Ireland, but his plan to introduce the Mother and Child Scheme was a major component in bringing down the government. From that time on, Browne was a persistent figure in Irish national politics but frequently found himself unable to integrate himself into party politics. After moving through a number of parties in the 1950s and 1960s, Browne was part of Labour for 14 years between 1963 and 1977. He would eventually leave the party in a bitter dispute over forming a formal electoral alliance with Fine Gael.

Spring&#x27;s announcement in January had piqued Browne&#x27;s interest and that of his supporters (which included Labour members such as Michael D. Higgins and Emmet Stagg). They quickly moved to explore options for how Browne could stand in elections, which led to Browne having an inconclusive meeting with the Workers&#x27; Party at the end of January. Browne&#x27;s manoeuvring caught the attention of the Irish news media, who began to openly speculate about the prospect of a Browne candidacy, almost to the exclusion of Robinson. On 26 March, Browne was able to secure the endorsement of the Labour Women&#x27;s National Council, a sub-organisation within the Labour Party with former ties to Robinson.

However, the Spring-Robinson talks continued to progress in parallel to Browne&#x27;s movements, and on 4 April, Spring held a meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party to discuss each candidate. A vote proposing Noel Browne as Labour&#x27;s candidate was defeated by a 4 to 1 ratio, while a subsequent vote proposing Robinson succeeded.

Browne was bitterly disappointed to not receive the nomination and would for the remainder of his life hold a caustic view of Robinson. Nevertheless, it has been suggested that many of his supporters transferred their allegiance to Robinson once she became Labour&#x27;s nominee and that they were a key component in her campaign.

Although Robinson had secured the Labour Party&#x27;s nomination, she was not yet eligible to formally enter the race as the Labour Party consisted of only 15 Teachtaí Dála and 4 senators, and the support of 20 members of the Oireachtas was required to enter the race. In order to secure the final signatures required, the Labour Party worked together with the Workers&#x27; Party, who had 7 TDs.

By May 1990, Robinson was the formal joint Labour and Workers&#x27; Party nominee, and the first candidate to enter the race.

===Fine Gael===

At the 1990 Fine Gael Ard Fheis, party leader Alan Dukes promised that he would find a &quot;candidate of vigour and stature&quot; to contest the election. However, Dukes had great difficulty in trying to secure a candidate from his party&#x27;s ranks, primarily due to their perception that Fianna Fáil&#x27;s Brian Lenihan would be a runaway favourite to win. Dukes attempted to secure the candidacies of former Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald and former Tánaiste Peter Barry but failed.

With his options dwindling, Dukes turned to the newly elected Teachta Dala Austin Currie. Currie had only entered the Dáil for the first time 15 months previously following the 1989 general election. However, Currie had an extensive background as a political activist in Northern Ireland as part of the civil rights movement in Northern Ireland and as a former member of the Social Democratic and Labour Party.

After Dukes convinced Currie to stand, Currie&#x27;s nomination was confirmed by a unanimous vote of Fine Gael&#x27;s parliamentary party on 12 September. By that point, it was already well known to the public that Brian Lenihan would be frontrunner for the Fianna Fáil nomination.

===Fianna Fáil===
On 17 September 1990, Fianna Fáil selected their candidate by holding a vote amongst members of their parliamentary party. Two members put their names forward: Brian Lenihan Snr, the Tánaiste and Minister for Defence and John Wilson, Minister for the Marine. Lenihan won the vote 51 to 19.

===Failed Independent bid by Carmencita Hederman===
On 15 October (the day before the nomination deadline) recently elected Senator and former Lord Mayor of Dublin Carmencita Hederman asked Dublin City Council to support her and to give her a nomination towards the presidency. However, the motion was defeated by 31 votes to 5. Councillors from Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, the Progressive Democrats and the Workers&#x27; Party cited that they could not support her bid, as their parties had already given their support to other candidates or ruled themselves neutral. Hederman&#x27;s bid was supported by Independent TDs such as Tony Gregory and Seán Dublin Bay Rockall Loftus as well Green TD Roger Garland. Hederman did not petition any additional councils following her failure to secure a nomination from Dublin City Council.

Hederman asserted on 15 October that the Progressive Democrats had promised to support her bid contingent on her securing 20,000 signatures of public support, but pulled their pledge at the last moment. Mary Harney denied this, and stated she had told Hederman her support was contingent on Hederman securing the backing of 11 other TDs. Ultimately, the Progressive Democrats declared &quot;neutrality&quot; in the election, and did not officially support any candidate.

==Campaign and issues==
When Lenihan entered the race in mid-September, he was considered the odds-on favourite; no Fianna Fáil candidate had ever lost a presidential election.

===Role of the President===
Immediately upon his selection as the Fianna Fáil candidate on 17 September, Lenihan stated that he felt that expanding the role of the President was &quot;not an issue in this campaign&quot; and suggested it was not possible for any candidate to, by themselves, expand the role. Lenihan were in response to previous comments by both Robinson and Currie suggesting they could and would develop the presidency into a more active role in Irish politics. From as early as April 1990, Robinson made clear her ambitions to expand the role of the presidency.

===Broad party support for Robinson===
On October 11, the Green Party announced that it had held a ballot of its members and they had overwhelmingly voted to officially support Robinson&#x27;s campaign bid. Robinson welcomed the announcement and stated her belief that environmentalism was an area in which the office of President could provide leadership.

In addition to enjoying the formal support of 3 separate political parties and their canvassers, many Fine Gael canvassers choose to provide support for Robinson over Currie. Polling carried out by &quot;The Irish Times&quot; by 16 October showed that half of those who considered themselves Fine Gael supporters favoured Robinson over Currie. Following the end of the campaign, Currie would cite the fact that many Fine Gael activists choose to support Robinson over himself as damaging his own campaign.

Furthermore, although their party was officially &quot;neutral&quot;, many Progressive Democrats activists were broadly sympathetic to Robinson&#x27;s social views and were also attracted to offering her support. This support intensified following Michael McDowell&#x27;s robust defence of Robinson in the face of personal attacks by Fianna Fáil&#x27;s Padraig Flynn &quot;(See Flynn personal remarks about Robinson below for more)&quot;.

===&quot;Red Scare&quot; tactics===
The early and strong support amongst Fine Gael voters for Robinson alarmed the Fine Gael camp, who reacted by engaging in Red Scare tactics against Robinson rather than focusing on the favourite Lenihan. Immediately upon the confirmation that Currie was in the race, prominent members of Fine Gael, such as Jim Mitchell and Michael Noonan, suggested that Robinson would be the &quot;acceptable face of Socialism in Ireland&quot; and that a victory for Robinson would be a victory for the Workers&#x27; Party.

Members of Fianna Fáil would repeat similar accusations as the polls tightened and it became apparent that Robinson was a credible threat to Lenihan&#x27;s campaign.

===Robinson &quot;Hot Press&quot; interview===
In September 1990, the magazine &quot;Hot Press&quot; conducted a 90-minute interview with Robinson. The audio was recorded and certain portions were later transcribed in order to be used in print. Two weeks passed between the actual interview and its eventual appearance in the October edition of the monthly magazine. Upon the release of the interview, the Fianna Fáil affiliated newspaper &quot;The Irish Press&quot; lead that day with a front-page headline reading &quot;LONGEST SUICIDE NOTE IN HISTORY&quot; and an article by Emily O’Reilly focusing on Robinson responding &quot;Yes&quot; when asked in the interview if she would, as president, officiate the opening of a stall selling contraceptives in a Virgin Megastore. Both Lenihan and Currie accused Robinson of making a political gaffe with this response. The Robinson camp initially claimed Robinson had been misquoted, but when Liam Fay, the journalist for &quot;Hot Press&quot;, was able to produce the audio recording of the interview, his transcription was proven correct. The Robinson camp changed tack, and claimed that Robinson had not meant &quot;Yes, I would&quot;, but simply that because of her legal background, she was in the habit of advancing dialogue by saying &quot;Yes&quot; as an interjection. Robinson would henceforth deny that she would preside over any illegal activity should she win the election.

===The Lenihan tape===

Although Lenihan was the initial favourite to win the election, his campaign was derailed when he confirmed in an on-the-record interview with freelance journalist and academic researcher Jim Duffy that he had been involved in controversial attempts to pressurise President Patrick Hillery not to dissolve the Dáil in 1982. After the contrast between his public denials during the campaign and his eventual confirmation of his role during his earlier interview recorded in May the Progressive Democrats, then in coalition with Fianna Fáil, threatened to support an opposition motion of no confidence unless Lenihan was dismissed from the government or an inquiry into the 1982 events was set up. The incident caused Lenihan&#x27;s support to drop from 43% to 32% with Robinson going from 38% to 51%. Taoiseach Charles Haughey privately asked Lenihan to resign, and sacked him on 31 October—a week before the election—when he refused to do so leading to a sympathy vote for Lenihan; his support in the polls going from 32% on 29 October to 42% on 3 November (with Robinson&#x27;s support dropping from 51 to 42%).

===Flynn personal remarks about Robinson===

On 3 November, just days before voting was due to take place, cabinet minister Pádraig Flynn of Fianna Fáil made an appearance on the RTÉ Radio 1 show &quot;Saturday View&quot; alongside Michael McDowell of the Progressive Democrats and Brendan Howlin of the Labour Party. During the segment, Flynn launched a personal attack on Mary Robinson, accusing her of &quot;having a new-found interest in her family&quot; as part of a new public persona introduced for the campaign. An infuriated McDowell, whose party had been broadly sympathetic to Lenihan and Fianna Fáil until that moment, excoriated Flynn, immediately calling the remarks a &quot;disgrace&quot;, called upon Flynn to withdraw them and told him to &quot;learn some manners&quot;. Similarly, an incensed Howlin called the remarks typical of a Fianna Fáil campaign in which &quot;no dirt was too awful, no smear too great&quot;, and accused Flynn of outright lying about Robinson. Flynn did not withdraw the remark during the course of the programme, however, following an immediate and powerful public backlash, Flynn hurried to publicly withdraw the remark later the same day.

Flynn&#x27;s attack was a fatal blow to Lenihan&#x27;s campaign, causing many female supporters of Lenihan to vote for Robinson in a gesture of support.

==Result==
Lenihan received a relative majority of first-preference votes. Robinson received more than twice as many votes as Currie, and 76.73% of Currie&#x27;s votes transferred to Robinson, beating Lenihan into second place and electing Robinson as Ireland&#x27;s first female president.


===Results by constituency===


==Aftermath==
Both the immediate and long-term reactions to Robinson&#x27;s election were to declare it a turning point in Irish social and political history. &quot;The Irish Press&quot;, a national newspaper staunchly aligned with Fianna Fáil, immediately stated that the election &quot;signals a change in Irish society and a shift away from traditional attitudes and allegiances&quot;.
The result obtained by Austin Currie for Fine Gael, just 17%, was considered a terrible result for the party and immediately undermined the credibility of party leader Alan Dukes. Dukes resigned his position as party leader on 20 November 1990.

<doc id="201116" wikidata="Q132480" url="?curid=201116" title="Kantō region">
<text>The is a geographical region of Honshu, the largest island of Japan. In a common definition, the region includes the Greater Tokyo Area and encompasses seven prefectures: Chiba, Gunma, Ibaraki, Kanagawa, Saitama, Tochigi, and Tokyo. Slightly more than 45 percent of the land area within its boundaries is the Kantō Plain. The rest consists of the hills and mountains that form land borders with other regions of Japan.

As the Kantō region contains Tokyo, the capital and largest city of Japan, the region is considered the center of Japan&#x27;s politics and economy. According to the official census on October 1, 2010, by the Statistics Bureau of Japan, the population was 42,607,376, amounting to approximately one third of the total population of Japan.

== Other definitions ==
The assembles the prefectural governors of Ibaraki, Tochigi, Gunma, Saitama, Chiba, Tokyo, Kanagawa, Yamanashi, Nagano, and Shizuoka.

The of the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism in the national government is responsible for eight prefectures generally (Ibaraki, Tochigi, Gunma, Saitama, Chiba, Tokyo, Kanagawa, Yamanashi) and parts of the waterways in two others (Nagano and Shizuoka).

The is responsible for eleven prefectures: Ibaraki, Tochigi, Gunma, Saitama, Chiba, Tokyo, Kanagawa, Niigata, Yamanashi, Nagano and Shizuoka.

In the police organization of Japan, the is responsible for the Prefectural police departments of Ibaraki, Tochigi, Gunma, Saitama, Chiba, Kanagawa, Niigata, Yamanashi, Nagano and Shizuoka. Tokyo is not part of Kantō or any NPA region, its police has a dedicated liaison office with the national agency of its own.

== Geography ==
The surface geology of the Kantō Plain is the Quaternary alluvium and diluvium. The low mountain vegetation at an altitude of about 500 to 900 m in and around the plain is an evergreen broad-leaved forest zone. The distribution height range of laurel forests is 900 m in Hakone, about 800 m in Tanzawa and Takao, about 700 m in Okutama, Oku Musashi and Oku Chichibu, about 600 m in Nishijoshu, Akagiyama, Ashio Mountains and Tsukuba Mountains and about 500 m in Kitage and Nasu Mountains.

Over the evergreen broad-leaved forest are deciduous broad-leaved forests such as beech, birch, and &quot;Quercus crispula&quot;. In addition, coniferous forests such as &quot;Abies veitchii&quot; and &quot;Betula ermanii&quot; spread above the deciduous broad-leaved forest from an altitude of about 1100 m higher than the lower limit of the deciduous broad-leaved forest.

Mountains are spread out such as the Taishaku Mountains, Mt. Takahara, Mt. Nasu, and Mt. Yamizo. The Kantō Plain, which is the largest plain in Japan. Just north of the Enna Hills is Japan&#x27;s largest alluvial fan Nasuno at the foot of Mt. The Kujukuri Plain. The southern part of Chiba Prefecture is the Boso hills. The area around Kasumigaura in Ibaraki Prefecture is the Joso plateau and Hitachi plateau. Gunma Prefecture and the Chichibu region of Saitama Prefecture are basins. Rivers such as the Arakawa and Edo rivers pour into Tokyo Bay, and the Kinugawa and Tone rivers flow into the Pacific Ocean in Inubōsaki.

Tokyo Bay is surrounded by the Boso Peninsula and the Miura Peninsula, facing the west side of Chiba Prefecture, a part of Tokyo and the east side of Kanagawa Prefecture, and borders the Pacific Ocean from Uraga Suido. The coastal area is an industrial area. The south side of Kanagawa Prefecture faces Sagami Bay and Sagami Nada. The southern coast of Ibaraki Prefecture faces Kashima Nada. The Sagami Trough, which was the epicenter of the two Kanto earthquakes, passes through Sagami Bay. Efforts are being made to take safety measures against earthquakes in various places.

The highest point is the summit of Mt. Nikko-Shirane (Mt. Oku-Shirane) on the border between Nikko City, Tochigi Prefecture and Katashina Village, Gunma Prefecture. It is the eighth highest point in Japan&#x27;s prefectures. It is also the highest point north of Kanto (Kanto, Tohoku, Hokkaido). The highest points of the prefectures are Mt. Sanpo (2,483 m) in Saitama, Mt. Kumotori (2,017 m) in Tokyo, Mt. Hiru (1,673 m) in Kanagawa, Mt. Yamizo (1,022 m) in Ibaraki, and Mt. Atago (408 m) in Chiba. Atagoyama in Chiba Prefecture is the lowest among the highest peaks in each prefecture.

The region experiences a humid subtropical climate with a summer to fall precipitation maximum (&quot;Cfa/Cwa&quot;).

== History ==
The heartland of feudal power during the Kamakura period.

Kamakura is the political capital and it served as the seat of the Kamakura shogunate from 1185 to 1333, established by Minamoto no Yoritomo. 
It was the first military government in Japan&#x27;s history. Kamakura flourished until the fall of the Kamakura Shogunate, and its political functions returned to Kyoto in 1392.

In 1591, Tokugawa Ieyasu gave up control of his five provinces (Mikawa, Tōtōmi, Suruga, Shinano, and Kai) and moved all his soldiers and vassals to his new eight provinces in the Kantō region. The proclamation of this decision happened on the same day Toyotomi Hideyoshi, the de facto ruler of Japan at that time, entered Odawara castle following the surrender of the Hōjō clan after the Siege of Odawara (1590). The moment Ieyasu appointed to rule Kantō, he immediately assign his premier vassals such as Ii Naomasa, Honda Tadakatsu, Sakakibara Yasumasa, and Sakai Ietsugu, son of Sakai Tadatsugu, each to control large area of the former Hōjō clan territories in Kantō. Historian such as Kawamura saw this step was meant to bring order the newly subdued population of the area, while also to guard the eastern domains from the influence or threat from the Satomi clan which was not yet submit to the rule of Toyotomi at that time. The governors of Kantō region under Ieyasu rule:


Meanwhile, Ieyasu himself establish his personal new seat of power on Edo town, which at that time was an underdeveloped town in Kantō.

In the Edo period, Kanto became the center of modern development. Within the Greater Tokyo Area and especially the Tokyo-Yokohama metropolitan area, Kanto houses not only Japan&#x27;s seat of government but also the nation&#x27;s largest group of universities and cultural institutions, the greatest population and a large industrial zone. Although most of the Kanto plain is used for residential, commercial or industrial construction, it is still farmed. Rice is the principal crop, although the zone around Tokyo and Yokohama has been landscaped to grow garden produce for the metropolitan market.

In between January 1918 and April 1920, Japan was afflicted by Spanish flu pandemic, which claimed more than 400,000 Japanese lives.

A watershed moment of Japan&#x27;s modern history took place in the late Taishō period: the Great Kantō earthquake of 1923. The quake, which claimed more than 100,000 lives and ravaged Greater Tokyo area, occurred at a time when Japan was still reeling from the economic recession in reaction to the high-flying years during World War I.

Operation Coronet, part of Operation Downfall, the proposed Allied invasion of Japan during World War II, was scheduled to land on the Kantō Plain.

The name Kanto literally means &quot;East of the Barrier&quot;. The name &quot;Kanto&quot; is nowadays generally considered to mean the region east (東) of the Hakone Barrier (箱根関). An antonym of Kanto, &quot;West of the Barrier&quot; means the Kansai region, which lies western Honshu and was the center of feudal Japan.

After the Great Kanto earthquake (1923), many people in Kanto started creating art with different varieties of colors. They made art of earthquake and small towns to symbolize the small towns destroyed in the quake.

== Subdivisions ==
=== North and South ===
The most often used subdivision of the region is dividing it to , consisting of Ibaraki, Tochigi, and Gunma prefectures, and , consisting of Saitama (sometimes classified North), Chiba, Tokyo Metropolis (sometimes singulated), and Kanagawa prefectures. South Kantō is often regarded as synonymous with the Greater Tokyo Area. As part of Japan&#x27;s attempts to predict earthquakes, an area roughly corresponding to South Kantō has been designated an &#x27;Area of Intensified Observation&#x27; by the Coordinating Committee for Earthquake Prediction.

The Japanese House of Representatives&#x27; divides it into the electorate which consists of Ibaraki, Tochigi, Gunma, and Saitama prefectures, Tokyo electorate, and the electorate which consists of Chiba, Kanagawa, and Yamanashi prefectures (note that Yamanashi is out of the Kantō region in the orthodox definition).

Keirin&#x27;s consists of Chiba, Kanagawa, and Shizuoka prefectures.

=== East and West ===
This division is not often but sometimes used.

* : Ibaraki, Tochigi, and Chiba prefectures.
* : Gunma, Saitama, Tokyo, Kanagawa (and sometimes Yamanashi) prefectures.

=== Inland and Coastal ===
This division is sometimes used in economics and geography. The border can be modified if the topography is taken for prefectural boundaries.

* : Tochigi, Gunma, Saitama (and sometimes Yamanashi) prefectures.
* : Ibaraki, Chiba, Tokyo, and Kanagawa prefectures.

=== Greater Kantō ===
The Japanese national government defines the as the Kantō region plus Yamanashi Prefecture. Japan&#x27;s national public broadcaster NHK uses involving Yamanashi, Nagano, and Niigata prefectures for regional programming and administration.

=== Cities ===
The Kantō region is the most highly developed, urbanized, and industrialized part of Japan. Tokyo and Yokohama form a single industrial complex with a concentration of light and heavy industry along Tokyo Bay. Other major cities in the area include Kawasaki (in Kanagawa Prefecture); Saitama (in Saitama Prefecture); and Chiba (in Chiba Prefecture). Smaller cities, farther away from the coast, house substantial light and automotive industries. The average population density reached 1,192 persons per square kilometer in 1991.

== Economy ==
The Kantō region largely corresponds to the Tokyo Metropolitan Area with the exception that it does not contain Yamanashi prefecture.

The Tokyo Metropolitan Area has the largest city economy in the world and is one of the major global center of trade and commerce along with New York City, Los Angeles, Shanghai, Paris, Seoul, and London.

===GDP (purchasing power parity)===
The agglomeration of Tokyo is the world&#x27;s largest economy, with the largest gross metropolitan product at purchasing power parity (PPP) in the world according to a study by PricewaterhouseCoopers.

===Kanto Region Metropolitan Employment Area===

== Population ==

The population of Kantō region is very similar to that of the Greater Tokyo Area except that it does not contain Yamanashi Prefecture and contains the rural populations throughout the region.

Per Japanese census data, and the Kantō region&#x27;s data, population has continuously grown but the population growth rate has slowed since early 1992.

The Kantō region at the 2020 census had a population of 43.65 million people.

<doc id="201118" wikidata="Q1165458" url="?curid=201118" title="University of Northern British Columbia">
<text>The University of Northern British Columbia (UNBC) is a university serving the northern region of the Canadian province of British Columbia. The main campus is located in Prince George, with additional campuses located in Prince Rupert, Terrace, Quesnel, and Fort St. John. Because of its northern latitude, UNBC is a member of the University of the Arctic. In the 2020–21 academic year, 4,253 students were enrolled at UNBC.

In 2022, &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; magazine ranked UNBC as the number one university of its size in Canada, in the Primarily Undergraduate category. UNBC also finished first in the rankings in 2015 and 2016 and routinely finishes in the top three in its category. In 2023, UNBC placed second in its category. In 2007, the university obtained the trademark for &quot;Canada&#x27;s Green University&quot;.

==History==
In response to a grass-roots movement spearheaded by the Interior University Society, the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia established the university when it passed Bill 40, the University of Northern British Columbia Act, on June 22, 1990. UNBC offered a limited number of courses in rented office space in 1992 and 1993, but its campus was opened officially by Elizabeth II, Queen of Canada, on 17 August 1994. Some 1,500 students were enrolled that year, upon the completion two years of construction and the opening of the Prince George campus. 

The university gained attention with the introduction of the Northern Medical Program (NMP), a collaboration with the University of British Columbia. Through this arrangement, several academic physicians have been attracted to the city, which has led to an emerging academic medical community.

==Organization and administration==
The governance was modeled on the provincial &quot;University of Toronto Act 1906&quot;, which established a bicameral system of university government comprising a Senate (composed of members of the faculty), responsible for academic policy, and a Board of Governors (composed of members of the community), which exercises exclusive control over financial policy and having formal authority in all other matters. The President, appointed by the board, was to provide a link between the two bodies and to perform institutional leadership. The founding President, in post until 1995, was Geoffrey R. Weller.

==Campus==
The Prince George campus is located on Cranbrook Hill, overlooking the city of Prince George from the west, and is widely renowned for its innovative architecture. The award-winning Wood Innovation and Design Centre, designed by Michael Green Architecture, was the world’s tallest modern all-timber structure upon completion and serves as a facility for the research and education on the uses of wood. The Wood Innovation Research Lab is an example of Passive House design in a northern climate.

The separate buildings are linked by an agora that is partially below ground level. It is the efficient heating system connected to all the core campus buildings that permits UNBC to pursue its goal of heating the university by the gasification of clean-burning, renewable wood pellets collected from the waste of pine trees killed by the mountain pine beetle epidemic.

The buildings at UNBC are designed to represent the northern landscape. The Canfor Winter Garden area has a flowing blue staircase below a ceiling of wooden lattices, representing the west coast rain forests. The cafeteria has a lighthouse design that represents the rugged coastline of northern British Columbia. Another structural feature, a pair of triangular glass peaks, represents mountains and functions as skylights above the UNBC Bookstore.

On October 13, 2010, UNBC was co-awarded the Campus Sustainability Leadership Award by the Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education (AASHE) for its bio-energy project, which targets a reduction in fossil fuel use by supplying 85% of the heating needs at UNBC.

===University Hospital of Northern British Columbia===
The University Hospital of Northern British Columbia is a Level III trauma centre in Northern BC.

==Culture==

===Motto===
The UNBC motto,&quot; &#x27;En cha huná,&quot; directly translates as &quot;that person also lives&quot; in the Nak&#x27;azdli (Fort St. James) dialect of the Indigenous language Dakelh (Carrier). It is interpreted in English as &quot;respecting all forms of life&quot;.

===Student life===
The Northern Undergraduate Student Society, known colloquially as NUGSS, represents the undergraduate student body at the University of Northern British Columbia. A non-profit organization, NUGSS serves and represents all undergraduate students at all UNBC campuses. The Society governs student-led organizations on campus, provides the health and dental plan, advocates for student needs in local transit, and hosts various events. Annual NUGSS events include Backyard BBQ, Jump Back to NYE, and Final Affair.

UNBC&#x27;s Student Life department is dedicated to student success, and aims to raise student engagement in the UNBC community. Led by community leaders known as &quot;student ambassadors&quot;, Student Life hosts regular events, workshops, and volunteer opportunities for all UNBC students. The Student Life department is also in charge of UNBC&#x27;s Orientation and Weeks of Welcome.

The Northern British Columbia Graduate Student Society (NBCGSS), represents about 750 full-time and part-time graduate students. It was founded in the year of 1997, less than a decade after UNBC was founded. Every year NBCGSS holds events like winter/semi formals, a ski trip and a summer trip. NBCGSS is a member of the British Columbia Federation of Students (BCFS).

The UNBC First Nations Centre provides support services for indigenous students, including bringing in elders, counselling, and events such as talking circles and sweat lodges. The Northern Pride Centre or (also known as the &quot;PC&quot;) offers a safe space, support, and resources to the LGBT and ally community, including a new Positive Space Campaign designed by UNBC

<doc id="201120" wikidata="Q3586594" url="?curid=201120" title="1997 Irish presidential election">
<text>The 1997 Irish presidential election was held on Thursday, 30 October 1997. It was the eleventh presidential election to be held in Ireland, and only the sixth to be contested by more than one candidate. It was held ahead of schedule when incumbent Mary Robinson resigned to assume her new appointment as the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.

==Candidates==
The Minister for the Environment and Local Government made the order opening nominations on 15 September, with 30 September as the deadline for nominations. Five people received nominations, the highest number contesting to that point, and more remarkably, four of the five were women.

===Mary McAleese===
Mary McAleese was selected by Fianna Fáil as their candidate for the presidency. Born in Belfast, she was formerly a journalist with broadcaster, RTÉ, and at the time of her nomination, she was Pro-Vice Chancellor of Queen&#x27;s University Belfast. Two other candidates, Albert Reynolds and Michael O&#x27;Kennedy, had also sought the Fianna Fáil nomination. Reynolds was a former Taoiseach while O&#x27;Kennedy was a former cabinet minister having served in the Finance and Foreign Affairs portfolios. Both were also sitting TDs which was seen as an advantage. In the first round of voting, Reynolds received 49 votes, McAleese 42, and O&#x27;Kennedy 21. In the second round, McAleese won, with 62 votes to Reynolds&#x27;s 48. McAleese was later also endorsed by the Progressive Democrats, the smaller party in the coalition government with Fianna Fáil.

===Mary Banotti===
Mary Banotti was nominated by Fine Gael. She was the grand-niece of the former Irish leader, Michael Collins, and sister of the deputy leader of the party, Nora Owen. She defeated colleague Avril Doyle for the party nomination in a very close contest. Banotti, who was an MEP at the time, was the only serving politician among the five presidential candidates.

===Adi Roche===
Adi Roche, who had founded Chernobyl Children International in 1991, was nominated by the Labour Party. Roche was later endorsed by Democratic Left and the Green Party. At 42 years of age, she was and is the youngest person to stand in an Irish presidential election.

===Dana Rosemary Scallon===
Dana Rosemary Scallon received the nominations of five county councils: Donegal, Kerry, Longford, North Tipperary and Wicklow. Scallon was a singer, the winner of the 1970 Eurovision Song Contest, and a family values campaigner. She was the first candidate in any Irish presidential election to have been nominated by local authorities, rather than by Oireachtas members.

===Derek Nally===
Derek Nally was the fifth candidate to join the presidential race and the only male candidate. He was a retired Garda and victims&#x27; rights campaigner. He also received the nominations of five county councils: Carlow, Clare, Kildare, South Dublin and Wexford.

<doc id="201122" wikidata="Q7865337" url="?curid=201122" title="UNIVAC FASTRAND">
<text>FASTRAND was a magnetic drum mass storage system built by Sperry Rand Corporation (later Sperry Univac) for their UNIVAC 1100 series and 418/490/494 series computers. A FASTRAND subsystem consisted of one or two Control Units and up to eight FASTRAND units. A dual-access FASTRAND subsystem included two complete control units, and provided parallel data paths that allowed simultaneous operations on any two FASTRAND units in the subsystem. Each control unit interfaced to one (optionally two) 1100 Series (36-bit), or 490 Series (30-bit), parallel I/O channels.

A voice coil actuator moved a bar containing multiple single track recording heads, so these drums operated much like moving head disk drives with multiple disks. The heads &quot;flew&quot; on self-acting hydrodynamic air bearings. The drums had a plated magnetic recording surface. An optional feature called Fastband included 24 additional tracks with fixed read/write heads. This feature provided rapid access (35 ms. average access time), and a write lockout feature.

The Fastrands were very heavy (5,000 pounds) and large, approximately 8&#x27; long. Due to their weight, FASTRAND units were usually not installed on &quot;false floor&quot;, and required special rigging and mounts to move and/or install. There were reported cases of drum bearing failures that caused the machine to tear itself apart and send the heavy drum crashing through walls.

At the time of their introduction the storage capacity exceeded any other random access mass storage disk or drum.
There were three models of FASTRAND drives:
* FASTRAND I had a single drum. The large mass of the rotating drum caused gyroscopic precession of the unit, making it tend to spin on the computer room floor as the Earth rotated under it. Very few of these devices were delivered.
* FASTRAND II (the majority of units produced) had two counter-rotating drums to eliminate the gyroscopic effect. One actuator bar with heads was located between the drums.
* FASTRAND III, introduced in 1970, was physically identical to the FASTRAND II, but increased the recording density by 50%.

==Specifications (FASTRAND II)==
Storage capacity: 22,020,096 36-bit words = 132,120,576 6-bit FIELDATA characters = 99 megabytes (8-bit bytes) per device&lt;br&gt;
Drum rotation rate: 880 RPM (14.7 rotations per second)&lt;br&gt;
Heads: 64&lt;br&gt;
Sector size: 28 36-bit words&lt;br&gt;

Average Access time (seek time plus rotational latency): 92 milliseconds&lt;br&gt;
Data transfer rate: 26,283 36-bit words per second = 118 kilobytes per second (8-bit bytes) on 1100 series machines&lt;br&gt;
Recording density, one-dimensional: 1,000 bits per inch (along one track)&lt;br&gt;
Recording density, two-dimensional: 105,000 bits per square inch of drum surface&lt;br&gt;

Weight per FASTRAND device: 4,500 pounds&lt;br&gt;
Weight per kilobyte: 

==Storage allocation==
Despite the name, FASTRAND was slow. The head positioning time was significant, so software allocated storage by tracks (1,792 words, 10,752 characters or 8,064 eight-bit bytes) or &quot;positions&quot;, a group of 64 tracks (114,688 words, 688,128 characters or 510,096 eight-bit bytes) which were under the heads at a single time. This storage allocation method remained on the 1100 series machines long after drums had been replaced by disks.

The track storage units were checkboarded so that, with precise computation of the program&#x27;s processing time, one could create software with processing time per unit of Fastrand blocks that resulted in a program running in synchronism with the data transfer rate of the drum. Further, the track-to-track head movement time afforded an additional processing speed coordination possibility that permitted the computational rate to match the data transfer rate for large (for the time) data sets without being delayed by losing synchronism with the mass storage transfers.

<doc id="201123" wikidata="Q7711725" url="?curid=201123" title="2004 Irish presidential election">
<text>The 2004 Irish presidential election was scheduled for Friday, 22 October 2004. However, nominations closed at noon on 1 October and the incumbent president, Mary McAleese, who had nominated herself in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution, was the only candidate nominated. Accordingly, she was re-elected for a second seven-year term of office without the need to hold an election. This was the third time a president was returned unopposed, following Seán T. O&#x27;Kelly in 1952, and Patrick Hillery in 1983. McAleese was inaugurated for her second term on Thursday, 11 November 2004.

==Nomination procedure==
Under Article 12 of the Constitution of Ireland, a candidate for president could be nominated by:
*at least twenty of the 226 serving members of the Houses of the Oireachtas, or
*at least four of 34 county or city councils, or
*a former or retiring president, on their own nomination.

The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government made the order opening nominations on 13 September, with noon on 1 October as the deadline for nominations, and 22 October set as the date for a contest, if any.

==Nomination by Mary McAleese==
Mary McAleese nominated herself as a candidate on 24 September.

McAleese had the support of the government parties Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats, who had nominated her in the 1997 election. She also had the support of opposition parties Fine Gael and Sinn Féin, while the Labour Party and the Green Party had considered contesting the election, but ultimately voted against doing so (see below).

==Other potential candidates==
===Dana Rosemary Scallon===
Dana Rosemary Scallon had contested the 1997 presidential election and had served as an MEP from 1999 until her defeat in 2004. Scallon sought a nomination from local authorities, as she had done in 1997, but received only the nomination of Galway City Council. After failing to secure a nomination from local authorities, she wrote to every member of the Oireachtas seeking a nomination. She had the support for a time of Independent TD Jerry Cowley, but he later withdrew his support. Scallon made an appeal to the President of the High Court on the day of the close of nominations, but was unsuccessful. A challenge by a lay litigant to extend the time for nomination to allow for Dana to be nominated failed in the High Court.

===Labour Party===
In early 2003, the Labour Party stated that it would run a candidate, irrespective of the attitudes of other parties, and even in the event of the president seeking a second term. But party leader Pat Rabbitte appeared less committed during a television interview in November 2003, pointing out that all the party&#x27;s attentions were focused on the two Irish elections already set for 2004, the European Parliament election and the local elections to be held on 11 June 2004. However, former Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht Michael D. Higgins expressed in interest in contesting the election for the Labour Party.

On 15 September 2004, the party&#x27;s parliamentary party recommended not running a candidate. The final decision was taken by the party&#x27;s executive body, the National Executive, on 17 September 2004, which decided by 13 votes to 12 against running a candidate.

===Green Party===
Green Party TD Eamon Ryan let it be known that he was interested in seeking a nomination to run. However, practical difficulties included a lack of support from non-Green Party parliamentarians (fourteen of whom would be needed to nominate, as well as the six Green Party TDs), Mary McAleese&#x27;s personal popularity, and funding issues. Having been endorsed by the party leadership, Ryan subsequently withdrew his name before a meeting of the Green Party National Council and the Green Party ultimately did not run a candidate.

==Result==
The only candidate nominated was Mary McAleese and she was declared elected at the close of nominations on 1 October.

<text>An invasion is a military offensive of combatants of one geopolitical entity, usually in large numbers, entering territory controlled by another similar entity, often involving acts of aggression. Generally, invasions have objectives of conquering, liberating or reestablishing control or authority over a territory; forcing the partition of a country; altering the established government or gaining concessions from said government; or a combination thereof. An invasion can be the cause of a war, be a part of a larger strategy to end a war, or it can constitute an entire war in itself. Due to the large scale of the operations associated with invasions, they are usually strategic in planning and execution.

==History==

Archaeological evidence indicates that invasions have been frequent occurrences since prehistory. In antiquity, before radio communications and fast transportation, the only way for a military to ensure adequate reinforcements was to move armies as one massive force. This, by its very nature, led to the strategy of invasion. With invasion came cultural exchanges in government, religion, philosophy, and technology that shaped the development of much of the ancient world.

Before the days of package tours and cut-price airlines, military invasions functioned as a standard major form of proto-tourism – bringing large numbers of foreign visitors into new environments, with the consequential social, cultural and economic impacts on indigenous populations and on the invaders.

==Defenses==
States with potentially hostile neighbors typically adopt defensive measures to delay or forestall an invasion. In addition to utilizing geographical barriers such as rivers, marshes, or rugged terrain, these measures have historically included fortifications. Such a defense can be intended to actively prevent invading forces from entering the country by means of an extended and well-defended barrier; the Great Wall of China, Hadrian&#x27;s Wall, and the Danewerk are famous examples. Such barriers have also included trench lines and, in more modern times, minefields, cameras, and motion-sensitive sensors. However, these barriers can require a large military force to provide the defense, as well as maintain the equipment and positions, which can impose a great economic burden on the country. Some of those same techniques can also be turned against defenders, used to keep them from escape or resupply. During Operation Starvation, Allied forces used airdropped mines to severely disrupt Japanese logistical operations within their own borders.
Alternatively, the fortifications can be built up at a series of sites, such as castles or forts placed near a border. These structures are designed to delay an invasion long enough for the defending nation to mobilize an army of a size sufficient for defense or, in some cases, counter-invasion—such as, for example, the Maginot Line. Forts can be positioned so that the garrisons can interdict the supply lines of the invaders. The theory behind these spaced forts is that the invader cannot afford to bypass these defenses, and so must lay siege to the structures.

In modern times, the notion of constructing large-scale static defenses to combat land-based threats has largely become obsolete. The use of precision air campaigns and large-scale mechanization have made lighter, more mobile defenses desirable to military planners. The obsolescence of large fortifications was displayed by the failure of the Maginot Line in the beginning of World War Two. Nations defending against modern invasions normally use large population centers such as cities or towns as defensive points. The invader must capture these points to destroy the defender&#x27;s ability to wage war. The defender uses mobile armored and infantry divisions to protect these points, but the defenders are still very mobile and can normally retreat. A prominent example of the use of cities as fortifications can be seen in the Iraqi Army&#x27;s stands in the 2003 invasion of Iraq at Baghdad, Tikrit, and Basra in the major combat in the Iraq War. A defender can also use these mobile assets to precipitate a counteroffensive like the Soviet Red Army at the Battle of Kursk or the Northern Alliance in Afghanistan.

However, static emplacements remain useful in both defense against naval attacks and defense against air attacks. Naval mines are still an inexpensive but effective way to defend ports and choke off supply lines. Large static air defense systems that combine antiaircraft guns with missile launchers are still the best way to defend against air attacks. Such systems were used effectively by the North Vietnamese around Hanoi. Also, the United States has invested considerable time and money into the construction of a National Missile Defense system, a static defense grid intended to intercept nuclear intercontinental ballistic missiles.

Island nations, such as the United Kingdom or Japan, and continental states with extensive coasts, such as the United States, have utilized a significant naval presence to forestall an invasion of their country, rather than fortifying their border areas. A successful naval defense, however, usually requires a preponderance of naval power and the ability to sustain and service that defense force.

In particularly large nations, the defending force may also retreat to facilitate a counterattack by drawing the invaders deeper into hostile territory. One effect of this tactic is that the invading force becomes too spread out, making supply difficult and making the lines more susceptible to attack. This tactic, although costly, helped the Soviets stop the German advance at Stalingrad. It can also cause the invading force to extend too far, allowing a pincer movement to cut them off from reinforcements. This was the cause of the British defeat at the Battle of Cowpens during the American Revolutionary War. Finally, sending too many reinforcements can leave too few defenders in the attackers&#x27; territory, allowing a counter-invasion from other areas, as happened in the Second Punic War.

==Methods==

There are many different methods by which an invasion can take place, each method having arguments both in their favour and against. These include invasion by land, sea, or air, or any combination of these methods.

===By land===
Invasion over land is the straightforward entry of armed forces into an area using existing land connections, usually crossing borders or otherwise defined zones, such as a demilitarized zone, overwhelming defensive emplacements and structures. Although this tactic often results in a quick victory, troop movements are relatively slow and subject to disruption by terrain and weather. Furthermore, it is hard to conceal plans for this method of invasion, as most geopolitical entities take defensive positions in areas that are the most vulnerable to the methods mentioned above.

In modern warfare, invasion by land often takes place after, or sometimes during, attacks on the target by other means. Air strikes and cruise missiles launched from ships at sea are a common method of &quot;softening&quot; the target. Other, more subtle, preparations may involve secretly garnering popular support, assassinating potentially threatening political or military figures, and closing off supply lines where they cross into neighboring countries. In some cases, those other means of attack eliminate the need for ground assault; the 1945 atomic-bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki ultimately made it unnecessary for the Allies to invade the Japanese home islands with infantry troops. In cases such as this, while some ground troops are still needed to occupy the conquered territory, they are allowed to enter under the terms of a treaty and as such are no longer invaders. As unmanned, long-range combat evolves, the instances of basic overland invasion become fewer; often the conventional fighting is effectively over before the infantry arrives in the role of peacekeepers (see &quot;Applications regarding non-state combatants&quot; in this article).

===By sea===
Invasion by sea is the use of a body of water to facilitate the entry of armed forces into an area, often a landmass adjoining the body of water or an island. This is generally used either in conjunction with another method of invasion, and especially before the invention of flight, for cases in which there is no other method to enter the territory in question. Arguments in favor of this method usually consist of the ability to perform a surprise attack from sea, or that naval defenses of the area in question are inadequate to repel such an attack. However, the large amount of specialized equipment, such as amphibious vehicles and the difficulty of establishing defenses—usually with a resulting high casualty count—in exchange for a relatively small gain, are often used as arguments against such an invasion method. Underwater hazards and a lack of good cover are very common problems during invasions from the sea. At the Battle of Tarawa, Marine landing craft became hung up on a coral reef and were shelled from the beach. Other landers were sunk before they could reach the shore, and the tanks they were carrying were stranded in the water. Most of the few survivors of the first wave ended up pinned down on the beach. The island was conquered but at a heavy cost, and the loss of life sparked mass protests from civilians in the United States.

===By air===
Invasion by air is an invention of the 20th century and modern warfare. The idea involves sending military units into a territory by aircraft. The aircraft either land, allowing the military units to debark and attempt their objective, or the troops exit the aircraft while still in the air, using parachutes or similar devices to land in the territory being invaded. Many times air assaults have been used to pave the way for a ground- or sea-based invasion, by taking key positions deep behind enemy lines such as bridges and crossroads, but an entirely air-based invasion has never succeeded. Two immediate problems are resupply and reinforcement. A large airborne force cannot be adequately supplied without meeting up with ground forces; an airborne force too small simply places themselves into an immediate envelopment situation. Arguments in favor of this method generally relate to the ability to target specific areas that may not necessarily be easily accessible by land or sea, a greater chance of surprising the enemy and overwhelming defensive structures, and, in many cases, the need for a reduced number of forces due to the element of surprise. Arguments against this method typically involve capacity to perform such an invasion—such as the sheer number of planes that would be needed to carry a sufficient number of troops—and the need for a high level of intelligence in order for the invasion to be successful.

The closest examples to a true air invasion are the Battle of Crete, Operation Thursday (the Chindits second operation during the Burma Campaign) and Operation Market Garden. The latter was an assault on the German-occupied Netherlands conducted in September 1944. Nearly 35,000 men were dropped by parachute and glider into enemy territory in an attempt to capture bridges from the Germans and make way for the Allies&#x27; advance. However, even with such a massive force taking the Germans completely by surprise, the assault was a tactical failure and after 9 days of fighting the Allies managed only to escape back to their own lines, having sustained over 18,000 casualties. In the 21st century, as vast improvements are made in anti-aircraft defenses, it seems that the air invasion is a strategy whose time may never come.

===Pacification===

Once political boundaries and military lines have been breached, pacification of the region is the final, and arguably the most important, goal of the invading force. After the defeat of the regular military, or when one is lacking, continued opposition to an invasion often comes from civilian or paramilitary resistance movements. Complete pacification of an occupied country can be difficult, and usually impossible, but popular support is vital to the success of any invasion.

Media propaganda such as leaflets, books, and radio broadcasts can be used to encourage resistance fighters to surrender and to dissuade others from joining their cause. Pacification, often referred to as &quot;the winning of hearts and minds&quot;, reduces the desire for civilians to take up resistance. This may be accomplished through reeducation, allowing conquered citizens to participate in their government, or, especially in impoverished or besieged areas, simply by providing food, water, and shelter. Sometimes displays of military might are used; invading forces may assemble and parade through the streets of conquered towns, attempting to demonstrate the futility of any further fighting. These displays may also include public executions of enemy soldiers, resistance fighters, and other conspirators. Particularly in antiquity, the death or imprisonment of a popular leader was sometimes enough to bring about a quick surrender. However, this has often had the unintended effect of creating martyrs around which popular resistance can rally. For example, Bobby Sands, who died during a hunger strike in Long Kesh prison, became a symbol of the Provisional Irish Republican Army.

==Support==

===Logistics===

Without a steady flow of supplies, an invading force will soon find itself retreating. Before his invasion of Greece, Xerxes I spent three years amassing supplies from all over Asia; Herodotus wrote that the Persian army was so large it &quot;drank the rivers dry&quot;.

In most invasions, even in modern times, many fresh supplies are gathered from the invaded territories themselves. Before the laws of war, invaders often relied heavily on the supplies they would win by conquering towns along the way. During the Second Punic War, for example, Hannibal diverted his army to conquer cities simply to gather supplies; his strategy in crossing the Alps necessitated traveling with as few provisions as possible, expecting the Roman stores to sustain them when they had breached the border. The scorched earth tactics used in Russia forced Napoleon to withdraw his forces due to lack of food and shelter. Today, the Law of land warfare forbids looting and the confiscation of private property, but local supplies, particularly perishables, are still purchased when possible for use by occupying forces, and airplanes often use parachutes to drop supplies to besieged forces. Even as rules become stricter, the necessities of war become more numerous; in addition to food, shelter, and ammunition, today&#x27;s militaries require fuel, batteries, spare mechanical parts, electronic equipment, and many other things. In the United States, the Defense Logistics Agency employs over 22,000 civilians with the sole task of logistics support, and 30,000 soldiers graduate from the U.S. Army Logistics Management College each year.

===Communication===

Another consideration is the importance of leadership being able to communicate with the invasion force. In ancient times, this often meant that a king needed to lead his armies in person to be certain his commands were timely and followed, as in the case of Alexander the Great (356–323 BCE). At that time, the skills needed to lead troops in battle were as important as the skills needed to run a country during peacetime. When it was necessary for the king to be elsewhere, messengers would relay updates back to the rear, often on horseback or, in cases such as the Battle of Marathon (490 BCE), with swift runners.

When possible, sloops and cutters were used to relay information by sea. brought Britain the first news that Nelson had defeated the French forces at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805.

The development of Morse Code, and later of voice communications by radio and satellite, have allowed even small units of skirmishers to remain in contact with a larger invasion force, to verify orders or to call for artillery support and air strikes. These communications were critical to the German blitzkrieg strategy, as infantry commanders relayed defensive positions to tanks and bombers.

=== Public relations ===

In diplomatic, public relations and propaganda terms, it may help an invader (or a potential invader) to have an invitation as an excuse to intervene with a view to &quot;restoring order&quot; or &quot;righting wrongs&quot;. Dissident groups, fifth columns or official circles may conspire to &quot;call in&quot; foreign assistance. Cases include:
* From the point of view of the Byzantine Empire, the First Crusade&#x27;s invasion and conquest of the Levant (1096–1099) resulted from an invitation issued by Emperor Alexios I Komnenos in 1095, seeking assistance against the Turks in Anatolia.
* English barons opposed to King John invited the French Prince Louis to undertake a French invasion of England in the First Barons&#x27; War of 1215–1217.
* In 1688 an invitation to William of Orange to invade Britain helped the Glorious Revolution.
* Wolfe Tone asked for French intervention (the unsuccessful Expédition d&#x27;Irlande, 1796) in the lead-up to the Irish Rebellion of 1798.
* Some members of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia allegedly called for Soviet intervention during the Prague Spring of 1968, which ended with the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in August 1968.

National foundation-legends can echo the theme of inviting foreign warriors to come and rule a people: note the traditional account in the &quot;Tale of Bygone Years&quot; of how Varangian invaders came establish long-term rule in Novgorod (and subsequently throughout Russia).

In contrast, in modern times, a defender can improve public relations with a right message: Ukrainanian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy&#x27;s popularity was suffering after years of his presidency, but during the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022 his popularity improved dramatically, while Putin&#x27;s image of a calculating strategist was damaged and Russia was growingly being seen as a pariah in the international stage.

==Applications regarding non-state combatants==
In the 20th and 21st centuries, questions arose regarding the effectiveness of the invasion strategy in neutralizing non-state combatants, a type of warfare sometimes referred to as &quot;fourth generation warfare&quot;. In this case, one or more combatant groups are controlled not by a centralized state government but by independent leadership, and these groups may be made up of civilians, foreign agents, mercenaries, politicians, religious leaders, and members of the regular military. These groups act in smaller numbers, are not confined by borders, and do not necessarily depend on the direct support of the state. Groups such as these are not easily defeated by straightforward invasion, or even constant occupation; the country&#x27;s regular army may be defeated, the government may be replaced, but asymmetric warfare on the part of these groups can be continued indefinitely. Because regular armed forces units do not have the flexibility and independence of small covert cells, many believe that the concept of a powerful occupying force actually creates a disadvantage.

An opposing theory holds that, in response to extremist ideology and unjust governments, an invasion can change the government and reeducate the people, making prolonged resistance unlikely and averting future violence. This theory acknowledges that these changes may take time—generations, in some cases—but holds that immediate benefits may still be won by reducing membership in, and choking the supply lines of, these covert cells. Proponents of the invasion strategy in such conflicts maintain the belief that a strong occupying force can still succeed in its goals on a tactical level, building upon numerous small victories, similar to a war of attrition.

Contemporary debate on this issue is still fresh; neither side can claim to know for certain which strategies will ultimately be effective in defeating non-state combatants. Opponents of the invasion strategy point to a lack of examples in which occupying or peacekeeping forces have met with conclusive success. They also cite continuing conflicts such as Northern Ireland, Israel, Chechnya, and Iraq, as well as examples which they claim ultimately proved to be failures, such as Lebanon, and Afghanistan. Supporters of the invasion strategy hold that it is too soon to call those situations failures, and that patience is needed to see the plan through. Some say that the invasions themselves have, in fact, been successful, but that political opponents and the international media skew the facts for sensationalism or political gain.

==Outcomes==
The outcomes of an invasion may vary according to the objectives of both invaders and defenders, the success of the invasion and the defense, and the presence or absence of an agreed settlement between the warring parties. The most common outcome of a successful invasion is the loss of territory from the defender, generally accompanied by a change in government and often the loss of direct control of that government by the losing faction. This sometimes results in the transformation of that country into a client state, often accompanied by requirements to pay reparations or tribute to the victor. In other cases the results of a successful invasion may simply be a return to the status quo; this can be seen in wars of attrition, when the destruction of personnel and supplies is the main strategic objective, or where a nation previously subdued and currently occupied by an aggressive third party is restored to control of its own affairs (i.e. Western Europe following the Normandy landings in 1944, or Kuwait following the defeat of Iraq in 1991). In some cases, the invasion may be strategically limited to a geographical area, which is carved into a separate state as with the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971.

<text>Sir Keith Jacka Holyoake (11 February 1904 – 8 December 1983) was a New Zealand politician who served as the 26th prime minister of New Zealand, serving for a brief period in 1957 and then from 1960 to 1972, and also as the 13th governor-general of New Zealand, serving from 1977 to 1980. He is the only New Zealand politician to have held both positions.

Holyoake was born near Pahiatua in the Wairarapa. He left formal education at the age of 12 to help on the family farm. Before entering politics, he was active in various local farming associations. He was first elected to Parliament in 1932 for the Motueka electorate, representing the conservative Reform Party. Having played an instrumental role in the formation of the National Party in 1936, he lost his seat two years later. However, he was then earmarked for the safe seat of Pahiatua, which he held from 1943.

Following National&#x27;s first election victory, Holyoake entered Cabinet in 1949. In 1954, he was appointed the first deputy prime minister of New Zealand, under Sidney Holland. Holyoake became leader of the National Party and prime minister two months before the , after Holland&#x27;s resignation due to ill health. Following an election defeat, he served as the leader of the Opposition for three years before National returned to power in 1960.

Holyoake&#x27;s government rewrote the criminal legal code, passing the Crimes Act 1961. One of the main features of that act was the abolition of capital punishment, though only ten National MPs voted for its abolition. Among many conservative reforms, his government introduced a form of &quot;voluntary unionism&quot;. In foreign policy, Holyoake supported the United States and sent troops to Vietnam. He led his party to four consecutive election victories (not since surpassed). In 1972, he resigned as prime minister to ease the succession for his deputy and friend, Jack Marshall.

In 1977, the National government of Robert Muldoon created controversy by appointing Holyoake as governor-general. Opponents argued that a former politician should not hold the non-partisan position. Holyoake&#x27;s term was limited to three years, not the normal five. In 1980, he became a Knight Companion of the Order of the Garter, a rare honour.

Holyoake is the third-longest-serving New Zealand prime minister (just under 12 years), surpassed only by Richard Seddon&#x27;s 13 years and William Massey&#x27;s close to 13 years. Holyoake was also the first to be born in the 20th century. Known for his diplomatic style and &quot;&quot; voice, he was also fondly (or mockingly) known as &quot;Kiwi Keith&quot;, a name given to him in childhood to distinguish him from an Australian cousin with the same name.

==Early life==
Holyoake was born at Mangamutu, a short distance from Pahiatua, a town in New Zealand&#x27;s Wairarapa region, the son of Henry Victor Holyoake and Esther Eves. Keith Holyoake&#x27;s great-grandparents, Richard and Eliza Holyoake, settled at Riwaka near Motueka in 1843, and his maternal great-grandparents, William and Sarah Eves, arrived in Nelson in 1842. Relatives of the 19th-century secularist George Holyoake, the Holyoakes ran a small general store at Mangamutu, and then lived for a time in both Hastings and Tauranga, before settling on the family farm at Riwaka, following the death of Keith&#x27;s grandfather in 1913.

Holyoake was raised in the Plymouth Brethren church, and his social life as a child was very restricted. From the age of 12, having left school after his father&#x27;s death, Holyoake worked on the family hop and tobacco farm in Riwaka. His mother had trained as a school teacher, and continued his education at home. After taking over the management of the farm, he became involved in various local farming associations, something that increased his interest in politics.

==Early political career==






The Reform Party, which had strong rural support, selected Holyoake as its candidate for the Motueka seat in the . The incumbent MP, George Black, held the seat, but died the following year. Holyoake was the Reform Party&#x27;s candidate in the resulting by-election in 1932, and was successful. He became the youngest Member of Parliament at the time, at the age of 28. In 1935, he was awarded the King George V Silver Jubilee Medal.

In the , Holyoake retained his seat under the motto &quot;Follow England and Vote Holyoake&quot; despite a massive swing against the United–Reform Coalition. In the aftermath of this election, he played a key role in transforming the coalition into the modern National Party. He very quickly gained considerable respect from his colleagues, and was regarded as a rising star in the new party. The 1937 electoral redistribution was unfavourable for him and, when the boundary changes applied at the , Holyoake lost his seat to a rising star of the governing Labour Party, Jerry Skinner. Holyoake had been discussed as a possible successor to the party&#x27;s conscientious but lack-lustre leader, Adam Hamilton but, because Holyoake was no longer an MP, that ceased to be an option.

In 1943, Holyoake returned to Parliament as MP for Pahiatua, having been lined up by National for that nomination. In 1946, he became the party&#x27;s deputy Leader.

==First National Government: 1949–1957==
When National won the and formed the First National Government, new Prime Minister Sidney Holland appointed Holyoake as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Agriculture. Holyoake was also for a year (1949–50) Minister for Scientific and Industrial Research, and was Minister of Marketing until the department was abolished in 1953.

As Minister of Agriculture for eight years Holyoake enhanced his reputation as a level-headed good administrator. Farm mechanisation was encouraged, the &quot;extermination policy&quot; achieved nearly eliminated the rabbit pest. Dismantling of marketing producer controls was completed.

Holyoake twice went to London to re-negotiate price levels on meat and wool products, and in 1955 attended the Food and Agriculture Organization conference in Rome. On his return to New Zealand he visited India and the Soviet Union to seek alternative markets for New Zealand, although his trip bore little fruit. In 1957, he led a delegation seeking to protect New Zealand&#x27;s access to the British market, without notable success.

As Deputy leader of the National Party, Holyoake was acting prime minister whenever Holland was overseas. In recognition of that, he was made a member of the Privy Council in 1954. After the , Holland made him the first person to be formally appointed Deputy Prime Minister.

In 1953, in partnership with his friend Theodore Nisbet Gibbs and Gibbs&#x27; son Ian, Holyoake purchased a block of land on the northern shore of Lake Taupō from Ian&#x27;s employer. The land, which had previously been purchased from Ngāti Tūwharetoa iwi in 1884, was a block of 5,385 acres largely covered in scrub and fern. Holyoake and Gibbs subsequently developed the land into a town called Kinloch, which became a holiday destination. On his deathbed, Holyoake said that Kinloch was his proudest achievement.

===First period as prime minister===
Holyoake became Prime Minister two months before the , when incumbent Prime Minister Sidney Holland retired due to ill-health. Holland had been in declining health since 1954, and had never recovered from a mild heart attack or stroke in 1956. Holyoake also became Minister of Māori Affairs on the retirement of Ernest Corbett. 

Holyoake had little time to establish himself, and lost to the Walter Nash-led Labour Party by a margin of two seats. Holyoake became Leader of the Opposition for the next three years.

==Second National Government: 1960–1972==
In the , the National Party returned to power and formed the Second National Government. Historians attribute the victory to Holyoake&#x27;s skilful campaigning, particularly his attacks on Minister of Finance Arnold Nordmeyer&#x27;s so-called &quot;Black Budget&quot; of 1958, which had increased taxes on petrol, cigarettes and liquor. He also served as his own Minister of Foreign Affairs.

===Second period as prime minister===
The Holyoake government implemented numerous reforms of the public services and government institutions: for example, it created the Office of the Ombudsman and numerous quasi-autonomous non-governmental organisations, and strengthened parliamentary scrutiny of the executive. Public broadcasting was removed from direct government oversight and placed under corporation control. Holyoake&#x27;s government rewrote the criminal legal code, passing the Crimes Act 1961; the Act abolished capital punishment, though only ten National MPs voted for its abolition. In 1969, the Security Intelligence Service (SIS) was formally acknowledged to exist, and its minister, the prime minister, publicly acknowledged. That same year the New Zealand Parliament passed an Act covering the agency&#x27;s functions and responsibilities: the &quot;New Zealand Security Intelligence Service Act&quot;.

In 1960, the Holyoake government published the &quot;Hunn Report&quot;, a wide-ranging summary of Māori assets, and the state of Māori in New Zealand at the time. The report was a damning indictment of past governments&#x27; neglect of Māori within society, and Holyoake endeavoured to act on its findings. By embracing the &quot;No Maoris – No Tour&quot; cause, Holyoake ended the practice of an apartheid sporting body dictating the racial composition of New Zealand rugby teams touring in South Africa. In a 1966 speech directed at the South African authorities, Holyoake delicately defended the principle of racial equality, stating &quot;in this country we are one people; as such we cannot as a nation be truly represented in any sphere by a group chosen on racial lines&quot;.

Holyoake accepted the post-war political consensus; he believed in the necessity of a mixed economy, championing a Keynesian strategy of public investment to maintain demand. However, as an anti-socialist, Holyoake sought to reduce the role of trade unions in industrial relations. The National government introduced a form of voluntary unionism, though the majority of industrial workplaces remained unionised; the policy was hotly debated within caucus, with Holyoake&#x27;s deputy, Jack Marshall, and Tom Shand, favouring the retention of compulsory unionism. His government&#x27;s industrial policy brought Holyoake into conflict with union leaders, such as Fintan Patrick Walsh.

Holyoake&#x27;s government was comfortably re-elected for a second consecutive term in 1963. Holyoake&#x27;s second term featured by a long period of prosperity and economic expansion. However, moves by the United Kingdom to join the European Economic Community challenged his government. Holyoake deliberately played down the issue, and chose not to vocally oppose British membership of the EEC. A significant step towards diversification was a limited free trade agreement with Australia, negotiated in 1965 by Holyoake&#x27;s minister of overseas trade, Jack Marshall, who later also negotiated the terms of the arrangements for New Zealand under which Britain joined the EEC.
More controversial were the Holyoake government&#x27;s relations with the United States at the start of the Vietnam War. The National government&#x27;s initial response was carefully considered and characterised by Holyoake&#x27;s cautiousness towards the entire Vietnam question. The fundamental issues, Holyoake said, were simple: &quot;Whose will is to prevail in South Vietnam the imposed will of the North Vietnamese communists and their agents, or the freely expressed will of the people of South Vietnam?&quot; His government preferred minimal involvement, with other South East Asian deployments already having a strain on the New Zealand Defence Force. New Zealand&#x27;s alliance with the United States was an issue in the , which the National Party won on the back of.

Beginning in mid-1960s, the New Zealand government protested against French nuclear weapons testing in the Pacific region. In 1963, Holyoake announced the policy of banning the storage or testing of nuclear weapons within New Zealand territory.

As the prime minister during the Apollo 11 Moon landing, he contributed to messages from 73 world leaders that were etched into a silicon disk left on the surface of the Moon. The disk was left in the Sea of Tranquility by Buzz Aldrin.

Holyoake led his party to a narrow and unexpected victory in the . Two years prior Holyoake appointed a rising backbencher, Robert Muldoon as Minister of Finance in 1967, although ranked him lowly in his Cabinet. In response to falling wool prices and balance of payment problems, Muldoon introduced mini-budgets with Holyoake&#x27;s approval.
The National government was humiliated in early 1970 in a disastrous by-election for the once-safe National seat of Marlborough, triggered by the death of longtime minister Tom Shand. Having already received the customary appointment as Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour, Holyoake was knighted as a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George in the 1970 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours. Political commentators speculated about when Holyoake would retire, and by the early 1970s his closest allies, including Jack Marshall, were privately encouraging him to step down. The government was increasingly perceived as careworn and unfocused—two of its strongest ministers, Shand and Ralph Hanan, had died in 1969, and the party caucus was increasingly divided. After more than a decade in power and almost four decades in Parliament, Holyoake&#x27;s dogged conservatism appeared out of touch with an increasingly liberal society. It was not until 1972, just before a statutory general election, that he finally resigned. By then, he had become the senior statesman of the Commonwealth. Marshall succeeded him in the ensuing leadership ballot, and Holyoake remained in Cabinet as Minister of Foreign Affairs until National lost office at the end of the year.

==Retirement==

When National under Marshall was defeated at the , Holyoake remained prominent in opposition. Marshall retained him on the frontbench and appointed him Shadow Minister of Foreign Affairs. He became doubtful of Marshall&#x27;s chance to regain government with time and threw his influence with the caucus behind Marshall&#x27;s deputy Muldoon. In 1974 Marshall resigned as leader after realising that many of his colleagues (including Holyoake) no longer had confidence in him and Muldoon was elected in his place. Holyoake played an active part in the campaign for the , which saw National regain power again under Muldoon. Muldoon appointed Holyoake to the specially-created sinecure of Minister of State.

==Governor-general==

In 1977, Holyoake was unexpectedly and controversially appointed Governor-General of New Zealand by Queen Elizabeth II on the advice of the then Prime Minister Robert Muldoon. The announcement was made by the Queen at the end of her tour of New Zealand on 7 March 1977, from the Royal Yacht HMY &quot;Britannia&quot; in Lyttelton Harbour.

This choice was deemed controversial by some, as Holyoake was a sitting Cabinet minister and a former prime minister. Many opponents of Muldoon&#x27;s government claimed that it was a political appointment. The Leader of the Opposition, Bill Rowling (himself a former prime minister) stated that he would remove Holyoake as governor-general if the Labour Party won the , and openly suggested that he would have appointed Sir Edmund Hillary as governor-general. That suggestion was, in turn, criticised by the government, as Hillary had backed Labour in 1975 as part of the &quot;Citizens for Rowling&quot; campaign.

As a result of the appointment, Holyoake resigned from Parliament, leading to the Pahiatua by-election of 1977. He was succeeded from his seat by John Falloon.

Holyoake&#x27;s conduct while in office, however, was acknowledged to be fair and balanced. In particular, Holyoake refused to comment on the 1978 general election, which gave Labour a narrow plurality of votes but a majority of seats in parliament to National. Social Credit leader Bruce Beetham said Holyoake as governor-general had &quot;...a scrupulous impartiality that confounded the critics of his appointment&quot;. His term as governor-general was only for three years, on account of his age. Usually, governors-general serve for five years, but Holyoake was the oldest governor-general to date (at 73 years old). His term ended in 1980.

==Personal life==
Holyoake twice married Norma Janet Ingram: first in a civil ceremony on 24 September 1934, and again on 11 January 1935 at their Presbyterian church in Motueka. The couple had five children: two sons and three daughters. His daughter Diane married National MP Ken Comber. In the 1980 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, Norma, Lady Holyoake, was appointed a Dame Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George, for public services since 1935.

Holyoake also had a very close and somewhat paternalistic friendship with Marilyn Waring, National&#x27;s youngest female MP during her tenure. Holyoake cared for her deeply. They first met in 1974 when she, annoyed by the refusal of Labour Prime Minister, Norman Kirk, to support National MP Venn Young&#x27;s bill to decriminalise homosexuality, joined the National Party. She quickly entered the Opposition Research Unit as a part-time advisor under George Gair, the Shadow Minister of Housing. At age 22, she expressed some interest in standing for the party in the seat of Raglan, a very safe National seat that contained her hometown of Huntly. Holyoake, so overjoyed that a woman was willing to run for National in a safe &quot;blue&quot; seat, personally arrived within the hour to Parliament House and offered her the selection without even formally introducing himself. The two thereafter became very close, to the extent that on one occasion she kissed Holyoake on the lips in front of cameras. She is thought to have helped soften Holyoake&#x27;s ambivalent views on LGBT rights. After she was involuntarily outed by the New Zealand Truth in 1978, Holyoake worked with Prime Minister, Robert Muldoon, to quickly downplay the tabloid reports and to protect their friend.

==Death==
Holyoake died on 8 December 1983, aged 79, in Wellington. His state funeral took place on 13 December 1983 in Wellington Cathedral of St Paul.

<doc id="201127" wikidata="Q1514741" url="?curid=201127" title="Set (abstract data type)">
<text>In computer science, a set is an abstract data type that can store unique values, without any particular order. It is a computer implementation of the mathematical concept of a finite set. Unlike most other collection types, rather than retrieving a specific element from a set, one typically tests a value for membership in a set.

Some set data structures are designed for static or frozen sets that do not change after they are constructed. Static sets allow only query operations on their elements — such as checking whether a given value is in the set, or enumerating the values in some arbitrary order. Other variants, called dynamic or mutable sets, allow also the insertion and deletion of elements from the set.

A [[multiset]] is a special kind of set in which an element can appear multiple times in the set.

==Type theory==
In type theory, sets are generally identified with their indicator function (characteristic function): accordingly, a set of values of type formula_1 may be denoted by formula_2 or formula_3. (Subtypes and subsets may be modeled by refinement types, and quotient sets may be replaced by setoids.) The characteristic function formula_4 of a set formula_5 is defined as:
:formula_6

In theory, many other abstract data structures can be viewed as set structures with additional operations and/or additional axioms imposed on the standard operations. For example, an abstract heap can be viewed as a set structure with a codice_1 operation that returns the element of smallest value.

==Operations==

=== Core set-theoretical operations ===
One may define the operations of the algebra of sets:
* codice_2: returns the union of sets &quot;S&quot; and &quot;T&quot;.
* codice_3: returns the intersection of sets &quot;S&quot; and &quot;T&quot;.
* codice_4: returns the difference of sets &quot;S&quot; and &quot;T&quot;.
* codice_5: a predicate that tests whether the set &quot;S&quot; is a subset of set &quot;T&quot;.

=== Static sets ===
Typical operations that may be provided by a static set structure &quot;S&quot; are:
* codice_6: checks whether the value &quot;x&quot; is in the set &quot;S&quot;.
* codice_7: checks whether the set &quot;S&quot; is empty.
* codice_8 or codice_9: returns the number of elements in &quot;S&quot;.
* codice_10: returns a function that returns one more value of &quot;S&quot; at each call, in some arbitrary order.
* codice_11: returns a list containing the elements of &quot;S&quot; in some arbitrary order.
* codice_12: creates a set structure with values &quot;x&quot;1,&quot;x&quot;2...,&quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;.
* codice_13: creates a new set structure containing all the elements of the given collection or all the elements returned by the given iterator.

=== Dynamic sets ===
Dynamic set structures typically add:
* codice_14: creates a new, initially empty set structure.
** codice_15: creates a new set structure, initially empty but capable of holding up to &quot;n&quot; elements.
* codice_16: adds the element &quot;x&quot; to &quot;S&quot;, if it is not present already.
* codice_17: removes the element &quot;x&quot; from &quot;S&quot;, if it is present.
* codice_18: returns the maximum number of values that &quot;S&quot; can hold.

Some set structures may allow only some of these operations. The cost of each operation will depend on the implementation, and possibly also on the particular values stored in the set, and the order in which they are inserted.

=== Additional operations ===
There are many other operations that can (in principle) be defined in terms of the above, such as:
* codice_19: returns an arbitrary element of &quot;S&quot;, deleting it from &quot;S&quot;.
* codice_20: returns an arbitrary element of &quot;S&quot;. Functionally, the mutator codice_21 can be interpreted as the pair of selectors codice_22 where codice_23 returns the set consisting of all elements except for the arbitrary element. Can be interpreted in terms of codice_24.
* codice_25: returns the set of distinct values resulting from applying function &quot;F&quot; to each element of &quot;S&quot;.
* codice_26: returns the subset containing all elements of &quot;S&quot; that satisfy a given predicate &quot;P&quot;.
* codice_27: returns the value &quot;A&quot;|&quot;S&quot;| after applying codice_28 for each element &quot;e&quot; of &quot;S,&quot; for some binary operation &quot;F.&quot; &quot;F&quot; must be associative and commutative for this to be well-defined.
* codice_29: delete all elements of &quot;S&quot;.
* codice_30: checks whether the two given sets are equal (i.e. contain all and only the same elements).
* codice_31: returns a hash value for the static set &quot;S&quot; such that if codice_32 then codice_33

Other operations can be defined for sets with elements of a special type:
* codice_34: returns the sum of all elements of &quot;S&quot; for some definition of &quot;sum&quot;. For example, over integers or reals, it may be defined as codice_35.
* codice_36: given a set of sets, return the union. For example, codice_37. May be considered a kind of codice_38.
* codice_39: given a set consisting of sets and atomic elements (elements that are not sets), returns a set whose elements are the atomic elements of the original top-level set or elements of the sets it contains. In other words, remove a level of nesting – like codice_40 but allow atoms. This can be done a single time, or recursively flattening to obtain a set of only atomic elements. For example, codice_41.
* codice_42: returns the element of &quot;S&quot; that is closest in value to &quot;x&quot; (by some metric).
* codice_1, codice_44: returns the minimum/maximum element of &quot;S&quot;.

==Implementations==
Sets can be implemented using various data structures, which provide different time and space trade-offs for various operations. Some implementations are designed to improve the efficiency of very specialized operations, such as codice_45 or codice_46. Implementations described as &quot;general use&quot; typically strive to optimize the codice_47, codice_48, and codice_49 operations. A simple implementation is to use a list, ignoring the order of the elements and taking care to avoid repeated values. This is simple but inefficient, as operations like set membership or element deletion are &quot;O&quot;(&quot;n&quot;), as they require scanning the entire list. Sets are often instead implemented using more efficient data structures, particularly various flavors of trees, tries, or hash tables.

As sets can be interpreted as a kind of map (by the indicator function), sets are commonly implemented in the same way as (partial) maps (associative arrays) – in this case in which the value of each key-value pair has the unit type or a sentinel value (like 1) – namely, a self-balancing binary search tree for sorted sets (which has O(log n) for most operations), or a hash table for unsorted sets (which has O(1) average-case, but O(n) worst-case, for most operations). A sorted linear hash table may be used to provide deterministically ordered sets.

Further, in languages that support maps but not sets, sets can be implemented in terms of maps. For example, a common programming idiom in Perl that converts an array to a hash whose values are the sentinel value 1, for use as a set, is:

my %elements = map { $_ =&gt; 1 } @elements;
Other popular methods include arrays. In particular a subset of the integers 1..&quot;n&quot; can be implemented efficiently as an &quot;n&quot;-bit bit array, which also support very efficient union and intersection operations. A Bloom map implements a set probabilistically, using a very compact representation but risking a small chance of false positives on queries.

The Boolean set operations can be implemented in terms of more elementary operations (codice_21, codice_51, and codice_48), but specialized algorithms may yield lower asymptotic time bounds. If sets are implemented as sorted lists, for example, the naive algorithm for codice_2 will take time proportional to the length &quot;m&quot; of &quot;S&quot; times the length &quot;n&quot; of &quot;T&quot;; whereas a variant of the list merging algorithm will do the job in time proportional to &quot;m&quot;+&quot;n&quot;. Moreover, there are specialized set data structures (such as the union-find data structure) that are optimized for one or more of these operations, at the expense of others.

== Language support ==
One of the earliest languages to support sets was Pascal; many languages now include it, whether in the core language or in a standard library.
* In C++, the Standard Template Library (STL) provides the codice_54 template class, which is typically implemented using a binary search tree (e.g. red–black tree); SGI&#x27;s STL also provides the codice_55 template class, which implements a set using a hash table. C++11 has support for the codice_56 template class, which is implemented using a hash table. In sets, the elements themselves are the keys, in contrast to sequenced containers, where elements are accessed using their (relative or absolute) position. Set elements must have a strict weak ordering.
* The Rust standard library provides the generic codice_57 and codice_58 types.
* Java offers the interface to support sets (with the class implementing it using a hash table), and the sub-interface to support sorted sets (with the class implementing it using a binary search tree).
* Apple&#x27;s Foundation framework (part of Cocoa) provides the Objective-C classes codice_59, codice_60, codice_61, codice_62, and codice_63. The CoreFoundation APIs provide the CFSet and CFMutableSet types for use in C.
* Python has built-in codice_64 and codice_65 types since 2.4, and since Python 3.0 and 2.7, supports non-empty set literals using a curly-bracket syntax, e.g.: codice_66; empty sets must be created using codice_67, because Python uses codice_68 to represent the empty dictionary.
* The .NET Framework provides the generic codice_57 and codice_70 classes that implement the generic codice_71 interface.
* Smalltalk&#x27;s class library includes codice_72 and codice_73, using equality and identity for inclusion test respectively. Many dialects provide variations for compressed storage (codice_74, codice_75), for ordering (codice_76, codice_70, etc.) or for weak references (codice_78).
* Ruby&#x27;s standard library includes a codice_64 module which contains codice_72 and codice_70 classes that implement sets using hash tables, the latter allowing iteration in sorted order.
* OCaml&#x27;s standard library contains a codice_72 module, which implements a functional set data structure using binary search trees.
* The GHC implementation of Haskell provides a codice_83 module, which implements immutable sets using binary search trees.
* The Tcl Tcllib package provides a set module which implements a set data structure based upon TCL lists.
* The Swift standard library contains a codice_72 type, since Swift 1.2.
* JavaScript introduced codice_72 as a standard built-in object with the ECMAScript 2015 standard. 
* Erlang&#x27;s standard library has a codice_86 module.
* Clojure has literal syntax for hashed sets, and also implements sorted sets.
* LabVIEW has native support for sets, from version 2019.
* Ada provides the codice_87 and codice_88 packages.
As noted in the previous section, in languages which do not directly support sets but do support associative arrays, sets can be emulated using associative arrays, by using the elements as keys, and using a dummy value as the values, which are ignored.

==Multiset==
A generalization of the notion of a set is that of a multiset or bag, which is similar to a set but allows repeated (&quot;equal&quot;) values (duplicates). This is used in two distinct senses: either equal values are considered &quot;identical,&quot; and are simply counted, or equal values are considered &quot;equivalent,&quot; and are stored as distinct items. For example, given a list of people (by name) and ages (in years), one could construct a multiset of ages, which simply counts the number of people of a given age. Alternatively, one can construct a multiset of people, where two people are considered equivalent if their ages are the same (but may be different people and have different names), in which case each pair (name, age) must be stored, and selecting on a given age gives all the people of a given age.

Formally, it is possible for objects in computer science to be considered &quot;equal&quot; under some equivalence relation but still distinct under another relation. Some types of multiset implementations will store distinct equal objects as separate items in the data structure; while others will collapse it down to one version (the first one encountered) and keep a positive integer count of the multiplicity of the element.

As with sets, multisets can naturally be implemented using hash table or trees, which yield different performance characteristics.

The set of all bags over type T is given by the expression bag T. If by multiset one considers equal items identical and simply counts them, then a multiset can be interpreted as a function from the input domain to the non-negative integers (natural numbers), generalizing the identification of a set with its indicator function. In some cases a multiset in this counting sense may be generalized to allow negative values, as in Python.

* C++&#x27;s Standard Template Library implements both sorted and unsorted multisets. It provides the codice_89 class for the sorted multiset, as a kind of associative container, which implements this multiset using a self-balancing binary search tree. It provides the codice_90 class for the unsorted multiset, as a kind of unordered associative container, which implements this multiset using a hash table. The unsorted multiset is standard as of C++11; previously SGI&#x27;s STL provides the codice_91 class, which was copied and eventually standardized.
* For Java, third-party libraries provide multiset functionality:
** Apache Commons Collections provides the codice_92 and codice_93 interfaces, with implementing classes like codice_94 and codice_95.
** Google Guava provides the codice_96 interface, with implementing classes like codice_97 and codice_98.
* Apple provides the codice_61 class as part of Cocoa, and the codice_100 and codice_101 types as part of CoreFoundation.
* Python&#x27;s standard library includes codice_102, which is similar to a multiset.
* Smalltalk includes the codice_92 class, which can be instantiated to use either identity or equality as predicate for inclusion test.

Where a multiset data structure is not available, a workaround is to use a regular set, but override the equality predicate of its items to always return &quot;not equal&quot; on distinct objects (however, such will still not be able to store multiple occurrences of the same object) or use an associative array mapping the values to their integer multiplicities (this will not be able to distinguish between equal elements at all).

Typical operations on bags:
* codice_104: checks whether the element &quot;x&quot; is present (at least once) in the bag &quot;B&quot;
* codice_105: checks whether each element in the bag &quot;B&quot;1 occurs in &quot;B&quot;1 no more often than it occurs in the bag &quot;B&quot;2; sometimes denoted as &quot;B&quot;1 ⊑ &quot;B&quot;2.
* codice_106: returns the number of times that the element &quot;x&quot; occurs in the bag &quot;B&quot;; sometimes denoted as &quot;B&quot; # &quot;x&quot;.
* codice_107: given a natural number &quot;n&quot;, returns a bag which contains the same elements as the bag &quot;B&quot;, except that every element that occurs &quot;m&quot; times in &quot;B&quot; occurs &quot;n&quot; * &quot;m&quot; times in the resulting bag; sometimes denoted as &quot;n&quot; ⊗ &quot;B&quot;.
* codice_108: returns a bag containing just those values that occur in either the bag &quot;B&quot;1 or the bag &quot;B&quot;2, except that the number of times a value &quot;x&quot; occurs in the resulting bag is equal to (&quot;B&quot;1 # x) + (&quot;B&quot;2 # x); sometimes denoted as &quot;B&quot;1 ⊎ &quot;B&quot;2.

===Multisets in SQL===
In relational databases, a table can be a (mathematical) set or a multiset, depending on the presence of unicity constraints on some columns (which turns it into a candidate key).

SQL allows the selection of rows from a relational table: this operation will in general yield a multiset, unless the keyword codice_109 is used to force the rows to be all different, or the selection includes the primary (or a candidate) key.

In ANSI SQL the codice_110 keyword can be used to transform a subquery into a collection expression:

SELECT expression1, expression2... FROM table_name...

is a general select that can be used as &quot;subquery expression&quot; of another more general query, while

MULTISET(SELECT expression1, expression2... FROM table_name...)

transforms the subquery into a &quot;collection expression&quot; that can be used in another query, or in assignment to a column of appropriate collection type.

<text>Sourcery is a fantasy novel by British writer Terry Pratchett, the fifth book in his &quot;Discworld&quot; series, published in 1988. 

==Premise==
On the Discworld, &quot;sourcerers&quot;—wizards who are sources of magic, and thus immensely more powerful than normal wizards—were the main cause of the Great Mage Wars that left areas of the Disc uninhabitable. As eight is a powerful magical number on Discworld, men born as the eighth son of an eighth son are commonly wizards. Since sourcerers are born the eighth son of an eighth son &quot;of an eighth son&quot;, they are &quot;wizards squared&quot;. To prevent the creation of sourcerers, therefore, wizards are not allowed to marry or have children.

There are many references to &quot;geasa&quot; in the text, which are idiosyncratic curses, vows or obligations placed upon a person (usually a hero, such as Cúchulainn in Irish mythology).

== Synopsis ==
A dying wizard who flouted the rule against having children makes a bargain with Death that allows his spirit to inhabit his staff, which he passes on to his eighth son, who is born a sourcerer. Under the influence of the staff, this child prodigy travels to Ankh-Morpork and initiates a plan for wizards to rule the Discworld, with himself at their head. Because the sourcerer&#x27;s power is threatening to destroy the Discworld altogether, a small band—Rincewind the Wizard, Nijel the Destroyer and Conina the Hairdresser, daughter of Cohen the Barbarian—attempt to thwart those plans.

==Plot==
Death comes to collect the soul of Ipslore the Red, a wizard who was banished from Unseen University for marrying and having children. Bitter over his exile and the death of his wife, Ipslore vows revenge upon the wizards through his eighth son, Coin. As the eighth son of a wizard who himself is an eighth son, Coin is born a sourcerer, a wizard who generates new magic rather than drawing it from the world, effectively making him the most powerful wizard on the Disc. At the moment of his death, Ipslore transfers his spirit into his wizard&#x27;s staff, which is passed to Coin, preventing Death from collecting Ipslore&#x27;s soul (since damaging the staff to do so would kill Coin) and allowing Ipslore to influence his son.

Eight years later, Virrid Wayzygoose, the Archchancellor-designate of Unseen University in Ankh-Morpork, is murdered before his induction by Coin, who then forces his way into the university&#x27;s Great Hall. After Coin bests one of the top wizards in the University, he is welcomed by the majority of the wizards. Rincewind, The Luggage and the Librarian miss Coin&#x27;s arrival, having fled the University shortly beforehand after the foreboding departure of all of its magically-influenced pest populations. While they are at the Mended Drum, Conina, a professional thief and a daughter of Discworld legend Cohen the Barbarian, arrives holding a box containing the Archchancellor&#x27;s hat, which she has procured from the room of Wayzygoose, and which possesses a kind of sentience as a result of being worn by hundreds of Archchancellors. Under the direction of the hat, which sees Coin as a threat to wizardry and the very world, Conina forces Rincewind to come with her and take a boat to the city of Al Khali, where the hat claims there is someone fit to wear it.

In Ankh-Morpork, the wizards are made more powerful due to Coin&#x27;s presence drawing more magic into the Discworld. Under Coin&#x27;s direction, the wizards take over Ankh-Morpork—transforming it into a pristine city and turning the Patrician, Lord Vetinari, into a newt—and make plans to take over the world. Elsewhere, Rincewind, Conina and the Luggage end up in the company of Creosote, the seriph of Al Khali, and Abrim, his treacherous vizier. The trio are eventually separated; Rincewind is thrown into the snake pit, where he meets Nijel the Destroyer, a barbarian hero in training. Conina is taken to Creosote&#x27;s harem, where the Seriph has his concubines tell him stories. The Luggage, having been scorned by Conina, runs away and gets drunk, before killing and eating several creatures in the desert.

Coin eventually declares Unseen University and the various wizarding orders obsolete and orders the Library to be burnt down, claiming that Wizardry no longer requires such things. A group of wizards then attack Al Khali, with the sheer amount of magic created by their arrival temporarily putting Rincewind into a trance and enabling him to use magic, allowing him and Nijel to escape the snake pit. They join up with Creosote and Conina, the latter immediately falling in love with Nijel, and they encounter Abrim, who had put on the Archchancellor&#x27;s hat hoping to gain power from it, only to be possessed instead. Having the experience of many previous Archchancellors, the hat proves an even match for Sourcery-empowered wizards, fighting off a group of them and enlisting others to its cause. As this takes place, Rincewind, Conina, Nijel and Creosote find a magical flying carpet in the palace&#x27;s treasury, and use it to escape the palace as it gets destroyed by the possessed Abrim building his own tower.

With the orders no longer around to keep the wizards in check, wizards across the Discworld go to war with one another, threatening to destroy the world completely. Upon hearing Creosote express anti-wizard sentiments, an angry and humiliated Rincewind abandons the group, taking the flying carpet and making his way to the University, where he learns that the Librarian has saved the library books by hiding them in the ancient Tower of Art. The Librarian convinces Rincewind to stop Coin, and he goes off to face the Sourcerer with a sock containing a half-brick. Back in Al Khali, the Luggage, blaming the Archchancellor&#x27;s hat for everything it has endured, forces its way into Abrim&#x27;s tower. Distracted by the Luggage, the possessed vizier is killed by the Ankh-Morpork wizards, with the tower and the Archchancellor&#x27;s hat getting destroyed in the process.

Despite his victory, Coin becomes concerned when he is told that wizards rule under the Discworld Gods. He traps the gods in an alternate reality, which shrinks to become a large pearl, unknowingly causing the Ice Giants, a race of beings who had been imprisoned by the gods, to escape their prison, whereupon they begin strolling across the Discworld, freezing everything in their path. Rincewind confronts Coin soon after this. The Sourcerer is amused, but unthreatened, by Rincewind attempting to fight him, prompting Ipslore to try to force Coin to kill him. Rincewind eventually convinces Coin to throw the staff away, but Ipslore&#x27;s power is channelled against that of his son. The other wizards leave the tower as Rincewind rushes forward, grabbing the child and sending both of them to the Dungeon Dimensions while Death strikes the staff and takes Ipslore&#x27;s soul. Rincewind orders Coin to return to the University and, using his other sock filled with sand, attacks the Creatures from the Dungeon Dimensions as a distraction to ensure Coin&#x27;s escape. The Gods are subsequently set free, stopping the march of the Ice Giants. As the Librarian helps Coin escape, the Luggage charges into the Dungeon Dimensions after Rincewind.

Coin returns the University and Ankh-Morpork to the way they were before he came. After Conina and Nijel travel to the University looking for Rincewind, Coin uses his magic to make them forget him and live happily ever after together. Recognising that he is too powerful to remain in the world, Coin steps into a dimension of his own making and is not seen on the Discworld again. The Librarian takes Rincewind&#x27;s battered hat, which was left behind when he went into the Dungeon Dimensions, and places it on a pedestal in the Library. The narrator states, &quot;A wizard...will always come back for his hat&quot;.

==Adaptations==
In 2010, Terry Pratchett stated that &quot;Sourcery&quot; would be the fifth Discworld novel to be adapted for Sky One, although he had initially wanted to adapt &quot;Making Money&quot;. However, he thought that it might work better as a film, and that he could have fun with characters like Nijel the Destroyer.

==Reception==
Critical reception for the novel was positive. &quot;Toronto Star&quot;″s Paul Stuewe writes that Pratchett &quot;demonstrates a flair for as well as slapstick comedy.&quot; 

A reviewer from &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; felt that &quot;Sourcery&quot; was skillfully written, stating &quot;Pratchett does not merely play with words, he juggles shrewd observations with .&quot; The reviewer added that &quot;the author never takes himself or his message too seriously, and maintains a feather-light touch throughout.&quot; 

Tom Hutchinson, writing for &quot;The Times&quot;, thought that &quot;Sourcery&quot; presents a &quot;memorable account of how we adapt power before it adapts us&quot; and &quot;may well be considered [Pratchett&#x27;s] masterpiece.&quot; 

Thomas M. Wagner from SF Reviews.net gave the book a 3.5/5 rating, commenting that the story &quot;has Pratchett&#x27;s trademark lightning pacing, and it fires gags and one-liners at you as if from a fully automatic Uzi.&quot; He stated that though he found most of &quot;Sourcery&quot; funny, &quot;it was very evident to me that Pratchett was, at this early stage of the series, barely scratching the surface of what his considerable wit is capable of.&quot;

<text>The Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance was an honor presented to recording artists for quality instrumental rock performances at the Grammy Awards, a ceremony that was established in 1958 and originally called the Gramophone Awards. Honors in several categories are presented at the ceremony annually by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences of the United States to &quot;honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position&quot;.

The award was first presented at the 1980 Grammy Awards to Paul McCartney and Wings for &quot;Rockestra Theme&quot;. From 1986 to 1989, the category was known as Best Rock Instrumental Performance (Orchestra, Group or Soloist). According to the category description guide for the 2010 awards, the award is presented to artists &quot;for newly recorded rock, hard rock or metal instrumental performances&quot;.

Jeff Beck holds the records for the most wins, with six. Sting has received three awards, twice as a member of The Police—although he had no part in the band&#x27;s &quot;Behind My Camel&quot;, the 1982 award winner which he did not write and on which he refused to play.

Two-time recipients include Eric Clapton, Carlos Santana (once as a member of the band Santana), The Flaming Lips, Steve Vai, and brothers Jimmie Vaughan and Stevie Ray Vaughan (each once as part of the duo Vaughan Brothers). At the 2009 awards, the tribute act Zappa Plays Zappa (led by Dweezil Zappa, son of Frank Zappa) earned an award for their performance of Frank&#x27;s instrumental song &quot;Peaches en Regalia&quot;. Dweezil and Frank have both received multiple nominations and even competed against one another in 1988. Joe Satriani holds the record for the most nominations (as well as the record for the most nominations without a win), with fourteen.

The award was discontinued before the 2012 awards due to a major overhaul of Grammy categories. All instrumental performances in the rock category were shifted to either the newly formed Best Rock Performance or Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance categories.

<doc id="201140" wikidata="Q1483126" url="?curid=201140" title="Flapper">
<text>Flappers were a subculture of young Western women prominent after the First World War and through the 1920s who wore short skirts (knee height was considered short during that period), bobbed their hair, listened to jazz, and flaunted their disdain for prevailing codes of decent behavior. Flappers have been seen as brash for wearing excessive makeup, drinking alcohol, smoking cigarettes in public, driving automobiles, treating sex in a casual manner, and otherwise flouting social and sexual norms. As automobiles became more available, flappers gained freedom of movement and privacy.

Flappers are icons of the Roaring Twenties, a period of postwar social and political turbulence and increased transatlantic cultural exchange, as well as of the export of American jazz culture to Europe. More conservative people, who belonged mostly to older generations, reacted with claims that the flappers&#x27; dresses were &quot;near nakedness&quot; and that flappers were &quot;flippant&quot;, &quot;reckless&quot;, and unintelligent.

While primarily associated with the United States, this &quot;modern girl&quot; archetype was a worldwide phenomenon that had other names depending on the country, such as &quot;joven moderna&quot; in Argentina or &quot;garçonne&quot; in France or &quot;moga&quot; in Japan, although the American term &quot;flapper&quot; was the most widespread internationally.

== Etymology ==
The slang term &quot;flapper&quot; may derive from an earlier use in northern England to mean &quot;teenage girl&quot;, referring to one whose hair is not yet put up and whose plaited pigtail &quot;flapped&quot; on her back, or from an older word meaning &quot;prostitute&quot;. The slang word &quot;flap&quot; was used for a young prostitute as early as 1631. By the 1890s, the word &quot;flapper&quot; was used in some localities as slang both for a very young prostitute, and, in a more general and less derogatory sense, of any lively mid-teenage girl.

The standard non-slang usage appeared in print as early as 1903 in England and 1904 in the United States, when novelist Desmond Coke used it in his college story of Oxford life, &quot;Sandford of Merton&quot;: &quot;There&#x27;s a stunning flapper&quot;. In 1907, English actor George Graves explained it to Americans as theatrical slang for acrobatic young female stage performers. The flapper was also known as a dancer, who danced like a bird—flapping her arms while doing the Charleston move. This move became quite a competitive dance during this era.

By 1908, newspapers as serious as &quot;The Times&quot; used the term, although with careful explanation: &quot;A &#x27;flapper&#x27;, we may explain, is a young lady who has not yet been promoted to long frocks and the wearing of her hair &#x27;up. In April 1908, the fashion section of London&#x27;s &quot;The Globe and Traveller&quot; contained a sketch entitled &quot;The Dress of the Young Girl&quot; with the following explanation: Americans, and those fortunate English folk whose money and status permit them to go in freely for slang terms ... call the subject of these lines the &#x27;flapper.&#x27; The appropriateness of this term does not move me to such whole-hearted admiration of the amazing powers of enriching our language which the Americans modestly acknowledge they possess ..., [and] in fact, would scarcely merit the honour of a moment of my attention, but for the fact that I seek in vain for any other expression that is understood to signify that important young person, the maiden of some sixteen years. The sketch is of a girl in a frock with a long skirt, &quot;which has the waistline quite high and semi-Empire, ... quite untrimmed, its plainness being relieved by a sash knotted carelessly around the skirt.&quot;

By November 1910, the word was popular enough for A. E. James to begin a series of stories in the &quot;London Magazine&quot; featuring the misadventures of a pretty fifteen-year-old girl and titled &quot;Her Majesty the Flapper&quot;. By 1911, a newspaper review indicates the mischievous and flirtatious &quot;flapper&quot; was an established stage-type.

By 1912, the London theatrical impresario John Tiller, defining the word in an interview he gave to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, described a &quot;flapper&quot; as belonging to a slightly older age group, a girl who has &quot;just come out&quot;. Tiller&#x27;s use of the phrase &quot;come out&quot; means &quot;to make a formal entry into &#x27;society&#x27; on reaching womanhood&quot;. In polite society at the time, a teenage girl who had not come out would still be classed as a child. She would be expected to keep a low profile on social occasions and ought not to be the object of male attention. Although the word was still largely understood as referring to high-spirited teenagers, gradually in Britain it was being extended to describe any impetuous immature woman. By late 1914, the British magazine &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; was reporting that the Flapper was beginning to disappear in England, being replaced by the so-called &quot;Little Creatures.&quot;

A &quot;Times&quot; article on the problem of finding jobs for women made unemployed by the return of the male workforce, following the end of World War One, was titled &quot;The Flapper&#x27;s Future&quot;. Under this influence, the meaning of the term changed somewhat, to apply to &quot;independent, pleasure-seeking, khaki-crazy young women&quot;.

In his lecture in February 1920 on Britain&#x27;s surplus of young women caused by the loss of young men in war, Dr. R. Murray-Leslie criticized &quot;the social butterfly type... the frivolous, scantily-clad, jazzing flapper, irresponsible and undisciplined, to whom a dance, a new hat, or a man with a car, were of more importance than the fate of nations&quot;. In May of that year, Selznick Pictures released &quot;The Flapper&quot;, a silent comedy film starring Olive Thomas. It was the first film in the United States to portray the &quot;flapper&quot; lifestyle. By that time, the term had taken on the full meaning of the flapper generation style and attitudes.

The use of the term coincided with a fashion among teenage girls in the United States in the early 1920s for wearing unbuckled galoshes, and a widespread false etymology held that they were called &quot;flappers&quot; because they flapped when they walked, as they wore their overshoes or galoshes unfastened, showing that they defied convention in a manner similar to the 21st century fad for untied shoelaces. Another suggestion to the origin of the term, in relation to fashion, comes from a 1920s fashion trend in which young women left their overcoat unbuttoned to allow it to flap back and forth as they walked, appearing more independent and freed from the tight, Victorian Era style clothing.

By the mid-1930s in Britain, although still occasionally used, the word &quot;flapper&quot; had become associated with the past. In 1936, a &quot;Times&quot; journalist grouped it with terms such as &quot;blotto&quot; as outdated slang: &quot;[blotto] evokes a distant echo of glad rags and flappers ... It recalls a past which is not yet &#x27;period&#x27;.&quot;

== Influences ==
One cause of the change in young women&#x27;s behavior was World War I, which ended in November 1918. The death of large numbers of young men in the war, and the Spanish flu pandemic which struck in 1918 killing between 20–40 million people, inspired in young people a feeling that life is short and could end at any moment. Therefore, young women wanted to spend their youth enjoying their life and freedom rather than staying at home and waiting for a man to marry them.

Political changes were another cause of the flapper culture. World War I reduced the grip of the class system on both sides of the Atlantic, encouraging different classes to mingle and share their sense of freedom. Women finally won the right to vote in the United States on August 26, 1920. Women wanted to be men&#x27;s social equals and were faced with the difficult realization of the larger goals of feminism: individuality, full political participation, economic independence, and &#x27;sex rights&#x27;. They wanted to have freedoms like men and go smoking and drinking. In addition, many women had more opportunities in the workplace and had even taken traditionally male jobs such as doctors, lawyers, engineers and pilots. The rise of consumerism also promoted the ideals of &quot;fulfilment and freedom&quot;, which encouraged women to think independently about their garments, careers, social activities.

Society changed quickly after World War I. For example, customs, technology, and manufacturing all moved quickly into the 20th century after the interruption of the war. The rise of the automobile was an important factor in flapper culture, as cars meant a woman could come and go as she pleased, travel to speakeasies and other entertainment venues, and use the large vehicles of the day for heavy petting or even sex. Also, the economic boom allowed more people the time and money to play golf and tennis and to take vacations, which required clothing adapted to these activities; the flapper&#x27;s slender silhouette was very suitable for movement.

== Evolution of the image ==
The first appearance of the flapper style in the United States came from the popular 1920 Frances Marion film &quot;The Flapper&quot;, starring Olive Thomas. Thomas starred in a similar role in 1917, though it was not until &quot;The Flapper&quot; that the term was used. In her final movies, she was seen as the flapper image. Other actresses, such as Clara Bow, Louise Brooks, Colleen Moore and Joan Crawford would soon build their careers on the same image, achieving great popularity.

F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote of Crawford:

In the United States, popular contempt for Prohibition was a factor in the rise of the flapper. With legal saloons and cabarets closed, back alley speakeasies became prolific and popular. This discrepancy between the law-abiding, religion-based temperance movement and the actual ubiquitous consumption of alcohol led to widespread disdain for authority. Flapper independence was also a response to the Gibson Girls of the 1890s. Although that pre-war look does not resemble the flapper style, their independence may have led to the flapper wisecracking tenacity 30 years later.

Writers in the United States such as F. Scott Fitzgerald and Anita Loos and illustrators such as Russell Patterson, John Held Jr., Ethel Hays and Faith Burrows popularized the flapper look and lifestyle through their works, and flappers came to be seen as attractive, reckless, and independent. Among those who criticized the flapper craze was writer-critic Dorothy Parker, who penned &quot;Flappers: A Hate Song&quot; to poke fun at the fad. In 1922, Secretary of Labor James J. Davis denounced the &quot;flippancy of the cigarette smoking, cocktail-drinking flapper&quot;. A Harvard psychologist reported that flappers had &quot;the lowest degree of intelligence&quot; and constituted &quot;a hopeless problem for educators&quot;.

Another writer, Lynne Frame, said in her book that a large number of scientists and health professionals have analyzed and reviewed the degree of femininity of flappers&#x27; appearance and behavior, given the &quot;boyishness&quot; of the flapper look and behavior. Some gynecologists gave the opinion that women were less &quot;marriageable&quot; if they were less &quot;feminine&quot;, as the husband would be unhappy in his marriage. In Frame&#x27;s book, she also wrote that the appearance of flappers, like the short hair and short dress, distracted attention from feminine curves to the legs and body. These attributes were not only a fashion trend but also the expression of a blurring of gender roles.

=== Image of youth ===
The flapper stands as one of the more enduring images of youth and new women in the 20th century and is viewed by modern-day Americans as something of a cultural heroine. However, back in the 1920s, many Americans regarded flappers as threatening to conventional society, representing a new moral order. Although most of them were the daughters of the middle class, they flouted middle-class values. Lots of women in the United States were drawn to the idea of being a flapper. There were rival organizations of flappers – the National Flapper Flock and the Royal Order of the Flapper. Flappers shrugged off their chaperones, danced suggestively, and openly flirted with boys. &quot;Flappers prized style over substance, novelty over tradition, and pleasure over virtue.&quot; Ruth Gillettes, a 1920s singer, had a song titled &quot;Oh Say! Can I See You Tonight?&quot; which expresses the new behavior of girls in the 1920s. Before the 1920s, for a woman to call a man to suggest a date would be impossible. However, in the 1920s, many girls seemed to play a leading role in relationships, actively asking boys out or even coming to their homes.

==Magazines==

In 1922, a small-circulation magazine – &quot;The Flapper&quot;, located in Chicago – celebrated the flapper&#x27;s appeal. On the opening page of its first issue, it proudly declared flappers&#x27; break with traditional values. Also, flappers defended them by contrasting themselves with earlier generations of women whom they called &quot;clinging vines&quot;. They mocked the confining fashions and demure passivity of older women and reveled in their own freedom. They did not even acknowledge that the previous generation of female activists had made the flappers&#x27; freedom possible.

In 1923, the flapper magazine &quot;Experience&quot; included an article on police reform, possibly indicating a concern for societal issues.

In the 1920s, new magazines appealed to young German women with a sensuous image and advertisements for the appropriate clothes and accessories they would want to purchase. The glossy pages of &quot;Die Dame&quot; and &quot;Das Blatt der Hausfrau&quot; displayed the &quot;Girl&quot;—the flapper. She was young and fashionable, financially independent, and was an eager consumer of the latest fashions. The magazines kept her up to date on fashion, arts, sports, and modern technology such as automobiles and telephones.

Although many young women in the 1920s saw flappers as the symbol of a brighter future, some also questioned the flappers&#x27; more extreme behavior. Therefore, in 1923, the magazine began asking for true stories from its readers for a new column called &quot;Confessions of a Flapper&quot;. Some of these were lighthearted stories of girls getting the better of those who underestimated them, but others described girls betraying their own standards of behavior in order to live up to the image of flappers. There were several examples: a newlywed confessed to having cheated on her husband, a college student described being told by a boyfriend that she was not &quot;the marrying kind&quot; because of the sexual liberties she had permitted him, and a minister&#x27;s daughter recounted the humiliation of being caught in the lie of pretending she was older and more sophisticated than she was. Many readers thought that flappers had gone too far in their quest for adventure. One 23-year-old &quot;ex-vamp&quot; declared: &quot;In my opinion, the average flappers from 15 to 19 were brainless, inconsiderate of others, and easy to get into serious trouble.&quot;

So, among the readers of &quot;The Flapper&quot;, parts of them were celebrated for flappers&#x27; spirit and appropriation of male privilege, while parts of them acknowledged the dangers of emulating flappers too faithfully, with some even confessing to violating their own codes of ethics so as to live up to all the hype.

== Behavior ==
Flappers&#x27; behavior was considered outlandish at the time and redefined women&#x27;s roles. In the English media, they were stereotyped as pleasure-loving, reckless and prone to defying convention by initiating sexual relationships. Some have suggested that the flapper concept as a stage of life particular to young women was imported to England from Germany, where it originated &quot;as a sexual reaction against the over-fed, under-exercised monumental woman, and as a compromise between pederasty and normal sex&quot;. In Germany, teenage girls were called &quot;&quot;Backfisch&quot;&quot;, which meant a young fish not yet big enough to be sold in the market. Although the concept of &quot;Backfisch&quot; was known in England by the late 1880s, the term was understood to mean a very demure social type unlike the flapper, who was typically rebellious and defiant of convention. The evolving image of flappers was of independent young women who went by night to jazz clubs such as those in Harlem, which were viewed as erotic and dangerous, where they danced provocatively, smoked cigarettes and dated freely, perhaps indiscriminately. They were active, sporting, rode bicycles, drove cars, and openly drank alcohol, a defiant act in the American period of Prohibition. With time, came the development of dance styles such as the Charleston, the Shimmy, the Bunny Hug, and the Black Bottom, which were considered shocking, but were a symbolic badge of the flapper&#x27;s rejection of traditional standards.

=== Overturning of Victorian roles ===
Flappers also began working outside the home and challenging women&#x27;s traditional societal roles and the monolithic historical idea of women being powerless throughout social history.

They were considered a significant challenge to traditional Victorian gender roles, devotion to plain-living, hard work and religion. Increasingly, women discarded old, rigid ideas about roles and embraced consumerism and personal choice, and were often described in terms of representing a &quot;culture war&quot; of old versus new. Flappers also advocated voting and women&#x27;s rights.

In this manner, flappers were a result of larger social changes – women were able to vote in the United States in 1920, and religious society had been rocked by the Scopes trial.

For all the concern about women stepping out of their traditional roles, however, many flappers were not engaged in politics. In fact, older suffragettes, who fought for the right for women to vote, viewed flappers as vapid and in some ways unworthy of the enfranchisement they had worked so hard to win. Dorothy Dunbar Bromley, a noted liberal writer at the time, summed up this dichotomy by describing flappers as &quot;truly modern&quot;, &quot;New Style&quot; feminists who &quot;admit that a full life calls for marriage and children&quot; and also &quot;are moved by an inescapable inner compulsion to be individuals in their own right&quot;.

=== Petting parties ===
&quot;Petting&quot; (&quot;making out&quot; or foreplay or non-penetrative sex) became more common than in the Victorian era, for example, with the rise in popularity of &quot;petting parties&quot;. At these parties, promiscuity became more commonplace, breaking from the traditions of monogamy or courtship with their expectations of eventual marriage. This was typical on college campuses, where young people &quot;spent a great deal of unsupervised time in mixed company&quot;.

Carolyn Van Wyck wrote a column for &quot;Photoplay&quot;, an upmarket magazine that featured articles on pop culture, advice on fashion, and even articles on helping readers channel their inner celebrity. In March 1926, an anonymous young woman wrote in describing petting as a problem, explaining, &quot;The boys all seem to do it and don&#x27;t seem to come back if you don&#x27;t do it also. We girls are at our wits&#x27; end to know what to do. ... I&#x27;m sure that I don&#x27;t want to marry anyone who is too slow to want to pet. But I want to discover what is right. Please help me.&quot; Van Wyck sympathized with the problem the writer faced and added, &quot;It seems to me much better to be known as a flat tire and keep romance in one&#x27;s mind than to be called a hot date and have fear in one&#x27;s heart.&quot;

In the 1950s, &quot;Life&quot; magazine depicted petting parties as &quot;that famed and shocking institution of the &#x27;20s&quot;, and, commenting on the Kinsey Report, said that they have been &quot;very much with us ever since&quot;. In the Kinsey Report of 1950, there was an indicated increase in premarital intercourse for the generation of the 1920s. Kinsey found that of women born before 1900, 14 percent acknowledged premarital sex before the age of 25, while those born after 1900 were two and a half times more likely (36 percent) to have premarital intercourse and experience an orgasm.

=== Slang ===
Flappers were associated with the use of a number of slang words, including &quot;junk&quot;, &quot;necker&quot;, &quot;heavy petting&quot;, and &quot;necking parties&quot;, although these words existed before the 1920s. Flappers also used the word &quot;jazz&quot; in the sense of anything exciting or fun. Their language sometimes reflected their feelings about dating, marriage and drinking habits: &quot;I have to see a man about a dog&quot; at this period often meant going to buy whiskey, and a &quot;handcuff&quot; or &quot;manacle&quot; was an engagement or wedding ring. Moreover, flappers invented slang terms like &quot;hush money&quot;, which meant the allowance from a father or &quot;dropping the pilot&quot;, which meant getting a divorce. Also reflective of their preoccupations were phrases to express approval, such as &quot;That&#x27;s so Jake&quot; (okay), &quot;She/he&#x27;s the &quot; (a superb person), &quot;Cake-eater&quot; (a ladies&#x27; man), and the popular &quot;the &quot; (anything wonderful).

There were two more slang terms that reflected flappers&#x27; behaviors or lifestyles, which were &quot;treating&quot; and &quot;charity girls&quot;. In the social context of dating, treating was the practice of providing companionship and intimate activity in exchange for entertainment outings, gifts, and other items of monetary value. The activity was prevalent in the large urban areas of the United States from the 1890s to the 1940s and was most commonly engaged in by young working-class women. As treating became more widespread, the activity acquired the label &quot;charity,&quot; and the young women who engaged in the more risqué aspects of the practice were often called charity girls.

== Appearance ==
In addition to their irreverent behavior, flappers were known for their style, which largely emerged as a result of French fashions, especially those pioneered by Coco Chanel, the effect on dress of the rapid spread of American jazz, and the popularization of dancing that accompanied it. Called &quot;garçonne&quot; in French (&quot;boy&quot; with a feminine suffix), flapper style made girls look young and boyish: short hair, flattened breasts, and straight waists accentuated it. By at least 1913, the association between slim adolescence and a certain characteristic look became fixed in the public&#x27;s mind. Lillian Nordica, commenting on New York fashions that year, referred to


At this early date, it seems that the style associated with a flapper already included the boyish physique and close-fitting hat, but a hobble skirt rather than one with a high hemline.

Although the appearance typically associated now with flappers (straight waists, short hair and a hemline above or around the knee) did not fully emerge until 1925, there was an early association in the public mind between unconventional appearance, outrageous behavior, and the word &quot;flapper&quot;. A report in &quot;The Times&quot; of a 1915 Christmas entertainment for troops stationed in France described a soldier in drag burlesquing feminine flirtatiousness while wearing &quot;short skirts, a hat of Parisian type and flapper-like hair&quot;.

Despite the scandal flappers generated, their look became fashionable in a toned-down form among respectable older women. Significantly, the flappers removed the corset from female fashion, raised skirt and gown hemlines, and popularized short hair for women. Among actresses closely identified with the style were Tallulah Bankhead, Olive Borden, Clara Bow, Louise Brooks, Joan Crawford, Bebe Daniels, Billie Dove, Leatrice Joy, Helen Kane, Laura La Plante, Dorothy Mackaill, Colleen Moore, Norma Shearer, Norma Talmadge, Olive Thomas, and Alice White.

Beginning in the early 1920s, flappers began appearing in newspaper comic strips; Blondie Boopadoop and Fritzi Ritz – later depicted more domestically, as the wife of Dagwood Bumstead and aunt of Nancy, respectively – were introduced as flappers.

=== Apparel ===
Flapper dresses were straight and loose, leaving the arms bare (sometimes no straps at all) and dropping the waistline to the hips. Silk or rayon stockings were held up by garters. Skirts rose to just below the knee by 1927, allowing flashes of leg to be seen when a girl danced or walked through a breeze, although the way they danced made any long loose skirt flap up to show their legs. To enhance the view, some flappers applied rouge to their knees. Popular dress styles included the robe de style. High heels also came into vogue at the time, reaching 2–3 inches (5–8 cm) high. Favored shoe styles were Mary Janes and T-straps in classic black, gold, silver, or nude shades.

==== Lingerie ====
Flappers did away with corsets and pantaloons in favor of &quot;step-in&quot; panties. Without the old restrictive corsets, flappers wore simple bust bodices to restrain their chest when dancing. They also wore new, softer and suppler corsets that reached to their hips, smoothing the whole frame, giving women a straight up and down appearance as opposed to the old corsets that slenderized the waist and accented the hips and bust.

The lack of curves of a corset promoted a boyish look. Adding an even more boyish look, the Symington Side Lacer was invented and became a popular essential as an everyday bra. This type of bra was made to pull in the back to flatten the chest. Other women envied flappers for their flat chests and bought the Symington Side Lacer to enhance the same look; large breasts were commonly regarded as a trait of unsophistication. Hence, flat chests became appealing to women, although flappers were the most common to wear such bras.

=== Hair and accessories ===
Boyish cuts were in vogue and released the weight of the tradition of women being required to grow their hair long, through popular cuts such as the bob cut, Eton crop, and shingle bob. Finger waving was used as a means of styling. Hats were still required wear, and popular styles included the newsboy cap and cloche hat.

Jewelry usually consisted of art deco pieces, especially many layers of beaded necklaces. Pins, rings, and brooches came into style. Horn-rimmed glasses were also popular.

=== Cosmetics ===

As far back as the 1890s, French actress Polaire pioneered a look which included short, disheveled hair, emphatic mouth and huge eyes heavily outlined in kohl. The evolving flapper look required &quot;heavy makeup&quot; in comparison to what had previously been acceptable outside of professional usage in the theater. With the invention of the metal lipstick container as well as compact mirrors, bee-stung lips came into vogue. Dark eyes, especially kohl-rimmed, were the style. Blush came into vogue now that it was no longer a messy application process. Women shaped their eyebrows needle-thin and penciled them in dark, emulating such actresses as Clara Bow.

Originally, pale skin was considered most attractive. However, tanned skin became increasingly popular after Coco Chanel showed off a tan after a holiday – it suggested a life of leisure, without the onerous need to work. Women wanted to look fit, sporty, and, above all, healthy.

=== American banks and &quot;flapper&quot; employees ===
According to a report in 1922, some banks across the United States started to regulate the dress and deportment of young female employees who were considered to be &quot;flappers&quot;. It began with a complaint of a mother in New Jersey who felt dissatisfied because her son did business only with a young female employee, whom she considered illegally attractive. The incident was duly reported to the officials of the bank, and rules adopted regarding requirements in dress for female employees. Those rules included that the dress should not have a pattern, it should be bought from a specific store, it must be worn in either black, blue or brown, its sleeves must not be shortened above the elbow, and its hem must not be worn higher than 12 inches from the ground. After that, the anti-flapper code soon spread to the Federal Reserve, where female employees were firmly told that there was no time for them to beautify themselves during office hours.

== Semiotics of the flapper ==

Being liberated from restrictive dress, from laces that interfered with breathing, and from hoops that needed managing suggested liberation of another sort. The new-found freedom to breathe and walk encouraged movement out of the house, and the flapper took full advantage. The flapper was an extreme manifestation of changes in the lifestyles of American women made visible through dress.

Changes in fashion were interpreted as signs of deeper changes in the American feminine ideal. The short skirt and bobbed hair were likely to be used as a symbol of emancipation. Signs of the moral revolution consisted of premarital sex, birth control, drinking, and contempt for older values. Before the War, a lady did not set foot in a saloon; after the War, a woman, though no more &quot;a lady&quot;, entered a speakeasy as casually as she would go into a railroad station. Women had started swearing and smoking publicly, using contraceptives, raising their skirts above the knee and rolling their hose below it. Women were now competing with men in the business world and obtaining financial independence and, therefore, other kinds of independence from men.

The New Woman was pushing the boundaries of gender roles, representing sexual and economic freedom. She cut her hair short and took to loose-fitting clothing and low cut dresses. No longer restrained by a tight waist and long trailing skirts, the modern woman of the 1920s was an independent thinker, who no longer followed the conventions of those before her. The flapper was an example of the prevailing conceptions of women and their roles during the Roaring 1920s. The flappers&#x27; ideal was motion with characteristics of intensity, energy, and volatility. She refused the traditional moral code. Modesty, chastity, morality, and traditional concepts of masculinity and femininity were seemingly ignored. The flapper was making an appeal to authority and was being attached to the impending &quot;demoralization&quot; of the country.

The Victorian American conception of sexuality and other roles of men and women in society and to one another were being challenged. Modern clothing was lighter and more flexible, better suiting the modern woman such as the flapper who wanted to engage in active sport. Women were now becoming more assertive and less willing to keep the home fires burning. The flappers&#x27; costume was seen as sexual and raised deeper questions of the behavior and values it symbolized.

== End of the flapper era ==
An obituary for the &quot;Flapper&quot; ran on the front page of &quot;The New York Times&quot; at the end of 1928, suggesting that she was being replaced by the &quot;Siren&quot;, a mysterious, stylish, &quot;vaguely European&quot; ideal woman. The flapper lifestyle and look disappeared and the roaring &#x27;20s era of glitz and glamour came to an end in America after the Wall Street Crash of 1929.
Unable to afford the latest trends and lifestyle, the once-vibrant flapper women returned to their dropped hemlines, and the flapper dress disappeared. A sudden serious tone washed over the public with the appearance of the Great Depression. The high-spirited attitude and hedonism were less acceptable during the economic hardships of the 1930s. When hemlines began to rise again, numerous states took action, making laws that restricted women to wear skirts with hemlines no shorter than three inches (7.5 centimeters) above the ankle. The ever-popular bobbed haircut was the cause for some women being fired from their jobs.

Transitioning into the 1930s was no easy task. Campaigns such as the &quot;Make Do and Mend&quot; slogan were becoming prevalent to ensure there was no overconsumption throughout society.
Fabric choices were among the many items to be cut back during this poverty-stricken time. Artificial fabrics were used instead of elegant fabrics such as silk, which were so popular in the early 1900s. No longer were party dresses adorned with decorative embellishments or made brightly colored. Instead, women headed to work to take over roles of men at war. The physically demanding jobs called for the creation and social acceptance of women&#x27;s trousers in society.

<text>Divide and conquer ()(lit. &quot;divide and rule&quot;) in politics refers to an entity gaining and maintaining political power by using divisive measures. This includes the exploitation of existing divisions within a political group by its political opponents, and also the deliberate creation or strengthening of such divisions.

== Definition ==
The phrase &quot;divide and conquer&quot; (from the latin &quot;divide et impera&quot;) first appeared in English around 1600.

The strategy of division and rule has been attributed to sovereigns, ranging from Louis XI of France to the House of Habsburg. Edward Coke denounces it in Chapter I of the Fourth Part of the &quot;Institutes of the Lawes of England&quot;, reporting that when it was demanded by the Lords and Commons what might be a principal motive for them to have good success in Parliament, it was answered: &quot;Eritis insuperabiles, si fueritis inseparabiles. Explosum est illud diverbium: Divide, &amp; impera, cum radix &amp; vertex imperii in obedientium consensu rata sunt.&quot; (&quot;You would be invincible if you were inseparable. This proverb, Divide and rule, has been rejected, since the root and the summit of authority are confirmed by the consent of the subjects.&quot;)

In a minor variation, Sir Francis Bacon wrote the phrase as &quot;separa et impera&quot; in a letter to James I of 15 February 1615. James Madison made this recommendation in a letter to Thomas Jefferson of 24 October 1787, which summarized the thesis of &quot;Federalist No. 10&quot;: &quot;Divide et impera, the reprobated axiom of tyranny, is under certain (some) qualifications, the only policy, by which a republic can be administered on just principles.&quot;

&quot;Divide et impera&quot; is the third of three political maxims in Immanuel Kant&#x27;s &quot;Perpetual Peace&quot; (1795), &quot;Appendix I&quot;, the others being &quot;Fac et excusa&quot; (&quot;Act now, and make excuses later&quot;) and &quot;Si fecisti, nega&quot; (&quot;If you commit a crime, deny it&quot;): Kant refers this tactic when describing the traits of a &quot;political moralist.&quot;

== Politics ==

In politics, the concept refers to a strategy that breaks up existing power structures, and especially prevents smaller power groups from linking up, causing rivalries and fomenting discord among the people to prevent a rebellion against the elites or the people implementing the strategy. The goal is either to pit the lower classes against themselves to prevent a revolution, or to provide a desired solution to the growing discord that strengthens the power of the elites.

The principle &quot;&quot;divide et impera&quot; is cited as a common in politics by Traiano Boccalini in &quot;La bilancia politica&quot;.

=== Economics ===

In economics, the concept is also mentioned as a strategy for market segmentation to get the most out of the players in a competitive market.

== Historical examples ==

===Asia===

While the Mongols imported Central Asian Muslims to serve as administrators in China, the Mongols also sent Han Chinese and Khitans from China to serve as administrators over the Muslim population in Bukhara in Central Asia, using foreigners to curtail the power of the local peoples of both lands.

Some Indian historians, such as politician Shashi Tharoor, assert that the British Raj frequently used this tactic to consolidate their rule and prevent the emergence of the Indian independence movement, citing Lord Elphinstone who said that &quot;Divide et impera&quot; was the old Roman maxim, and it should be ours.&quot; A &quot;Times Literary Supplement&quot; review by British historian Jon Wilson suggests that although this was broadly the case a more nuanced approach might be closer to the facts. On the other hand, Proponents of Hindutva, the ideology of the current and recent Indian governments over the years, stress strongly Hindu-Muslim conflict going back centuries before the arrival of the British. 

The classic nationalist position was expressed by the Indian jurist and supporter of Indian reunification Markandey Katju, who wrote in the Pakistani paper &quot;The Nation&quot; in 2013:
Historian John Keay takes a contrary position regarding British policy, writing:

General S.K. Sinha, former Vice-Chief of Army Staff, writes that contrary to what the notion of divide and rule would predict, the British Indian Army was effectively integrated:

=== French Algeria ===
=== Ottoman Empire ===
The Ottoman Empire often used a divide-and-rule strategy, pitting Armenians and Kurds against each other. This strategy no longer worked in the Republic of Turkey because the Armenians were eliminated in the Armenian genocide.

=== Europe ===
* Athenian historian Thucydides in his book History of the Peloponnesian War claimed that Alcibiades recommended to Persian statesman Tissaphernes, to weaken both Athens and Sparta for his own Persian&#x27;s benefit. Alcibiades, suggested to Tissaphernes that &quot;&#x27;The cheapest plan was to let the Hellenes wear each other out, at a small share of the expense and without risk to himself&quot;.
* During the Gallic Wars, Caesar was able to use a divide and conquer strategy to easily defeat the Gauls, exploiting their fractious nature of their tribal society. Although the remaining Gauls were later united under Vercingetorix their resistance was not enough to stop the conquest.
* In Revolutions of 1848, the governments which were being revolted against used this tactic to counter the rebels.
* The colonial authorities in British Cyprus often stirred up the Turkish minority in order to neutralize agitation from the Greek majority. This policy intentionally cultivated further animosity between the already divided Greek majority and the Turkish minority (which consists of 18% of the population) in the island that remains divided to this day after an invasion by Turkey to establish the state of North Cyprus (which is only diplomatically recognized by Turkey).
*The partition of Ireland in 1921 has been claimed as an intentional implementation of this strategy by David Lloyd George, although the religious divisions in Ireland were notorious and of long standing. The Stanford historian Priya Satia claims that the partition of Ireland was in ways a patch-test for the partition of India in 1947.

===Colonialism===

According to Richard Morrock, four tactics of divide and rule practiced by Western colonialists are:

# The manufacture of differences within the targeted population; 
# The amplification of existing differences; 
# The use of these differences for the benefit of the colonial empire; and 
# The carry over of these differences into the post-colonial period.

== Foreign policy ==

=== United States ===

Some analysts assert that the United States is practicing the strategy in the 21st-century Middle East through their supposed escalation of the Sunni–Shia conflict. British journalist Nafeez Ahmed cited a 2008 RAND Corporation study for the U.S Armed Forces which recommended &quot;divide and rule&quot; as a possible strategy against the Muslim world in &quot;the Long War&quot;.

=== Israel ===


Professor Avner Cohen, a former Israeli religious affairs official, publicly acknowledged that Hamas was &quot;Israel&#x27;s creation.&quot; Similar statesments have been made by Yasser Arafat.

Assertions of Israeli support for Hamas date back to the late 1970s and early 1980s, a period marked by significant political upheaval in the Middle East. Former Israeli officials have openly acknowledged Israel&#x27;s role in providing funding and assistance to Hamas as a means of undermining secular Palestinian factions such as the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). Brigadier General Yitzhak Segev, who served as the Israeli military governor in Gaza during the early 1980s, admitted to providing financial assistance to the Muslim Brotherhood, the precursor of Hamas, on the instruction of the Israeli authorities. The aim of the support was to weaken leftist and secular Palestinian organizations.

Israel contributed to the construction of parts of Islamist politician Ahmed Yassin&#x27;s network of mosques, clubs, and schools in Gaza, as well as the expansion of these institutions.

Shlomo Brom, retired general and former deputy to Israel&#x27;s national security adviser, believes that an empowered Hamas helps Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu avoid negotiatings over a Palestinian state, suggesting that there is no viable partner for peace talks. Bezalel Smotrich, a far-right lawmaker and finance minister under Netanyahu Government, called the Palestinian Authority a &quot;burden&quot; and Hamas an &quot;asset&quot;.

=== Russia ===

Some consider that contemporary Russian affairs also have characteristics of a &quot;divide and rule&quot; strategy. Applied domestically to secure Vladimir Putin&#x27;s power in Russia, it is used abroad in Russian disinformation campaigns to achieve &quot;regime security, predominance in Russia’s near abroad, and world-power status for Russia&quot;.

<doc id="201154" wikidata="Q671298" url="?curid=201154" title="Divide-and-conquer algorithm">
<text>In computer science, divide and conquer is an algorithm design paradigm. A divide-and-conquer algorithm recursively breaks down a problem into two or more sub-problems of the same or related type, until these become simple enough to be solved directly. The solutions to the sub-problems are then combined to give a solution to the original problem.

The divide-and-conquer technique is the basis of efficient algorithms for many problems, such as sorting (e.g., quicksort, merge sort), multiplying large numbers (e.g., the Karatsuba algorithm), finding the closest pair of points, syntactic analysis (e.g., top-down parsers), and computing the discrete Fourier transform (FFT).

Designing efficient divide-and-conquer algorithms can be difficult. As in mathematical induction, it is often necessary to generalize the problem to make it amenable to a recursive solution. The correctness of a divide-and-conquer algorithm is usually proved by mathematical induction, and its computational cost is often determined by solving recurrence relations.

== Divide and conquer ==
The divide-and-conquer paradigm is often used to find an optimal solution of a problem. Its basic idea is to decompose a given problem into two or more similar, but simpler, subproblems, to solve them in turn, and to compose their solutions to solve the given problem. Problems of sufficient simplicity are solved directly. 
For example, to sort a given list of &quot;n&quot; natural numbers, split it into two lists of about &quot;n&quot;/2 numbers each, sort each of them in turn, and interleave both results appropriately to obtain the sorted version of the given list (see the picture). This approach is known as the merge sort algorithm.

The name &quot;divide and conquer&quot; is sometimes applied to algorithms that reduce each problem to only one sub-problem, such as the binary search algorithm for finding a record in a sorted list (or its analogue in numerical computing, the bisection algorithm for root finding). These algorithms can be implemented more efficiently than general divide-and-conquer algorithms; in particular, if they use tail recursion, they can be converted into simple loops. Under this broad definition, however, every algorithm that uses recursion or loops could be regarded as a &quot;divide-and-conquer algorithm&quot;. Therefore, some authors consider that the name &quot;divide and conquer&quot; should be used only when each problem may generate two or more subproblems. The name decrease and conquer has been proposed instead for the single-subproblem class.

An important application of divide and conquer is in optimization, where if the search space is reduced (&quot;pruned&quot;) by a constant factor at each step, the overall algorithm has the same asymptotic complexity as the pruning step, with the constant depending on the pruning factor (by summing the geometric series); this is known as prune and search.

Early examples of these algorithms are primarily decrease and conquer – the original problem is successively broken down into &quot;single&quot; subproblems, and indeed can be solved iteratively.

Binary search, a decrease-and-conquer algorithm where the subproblems are of roughly half the original size, has a long history. While a clear description of the algorithm on computers appeared in 1946 in an article by John Mauchly, the idea of using a sorted list of items to facilitate searching dates back at least as far as Babylonia in 200 BC. Another ancient decrease-and-conquer algorithm is the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor of two numbers by reducing the numbers to smaller and smaller equivalent subproblems, which dates to several centuries BC.

An early example of a divide-and-conquer algorithm with multiple subproblems is Gauss&#x27;s 1805 description of what is now called the Cooley–Tukey fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm, although he did not analyze its operation count quantitatively, and FFTs did not become widespread until they were rediscovered over a century later.

An early two-subproblem D&amp;C algorithm that was specifically developed for computers and properly analyzed is the merge sort algorithm, invented by John von Neumann in 1945.

Another notable example is the algorithm invented by Anatolii A. Karatsuba in 1960 that could multiply two &quot;n&quot;-digit numbers in formula_1 operations (in Big O notation). This algorithm disproved Andrey Kolmogorov&#x27;s 1956 conjecture that formula_2 operations would be required for that task.

As another example of a divide-and-conquer algorithm that did not originally involve computers, Donald Knuth gives the method a post office typically uses to route mail: letters are sorted into separate bags for different geographical areas, each of these bags is itself sorted into batches for smaller sub-regions, and so on until they are delivered. This is related to a radix sort, described for punch-card sorting machines as early as 1929.

== Advantages ==

=== Solving difficult problems ===
Divide and conquer is a powerful tool for solving conceptually difficult problems: all it requires is a way of breaking the problem into sub-problems, of solving the trivial cases, and of combining sub-problems to the original problem. Similarly, decrease and conquer only requires reducing the problem to a single smaller problem, such as the classic Tower of Hanoi puzzle, which reduces moving a tower of height formula_3 to move a tower of height formula_4.

=== Algorithm efficiency ===
The divide-and-conquer paradigm often helps in the discovery of efficient algorithms. It was the key, for example, to Karatsuba&#x27;s fast multiplication method, the quicksort and mergesort algorithms, the Strassen algorithm for matrix multiplication, and fast Fourier transforms.

In all these examples, the D&amp;C approach led to an improvement in the asymptotic cost of the solution. For example, if (a) the base cases have constant-bounded size, the work of splitting the problem and combining the partial solutions is proportional to the problem&#x27;s size formula_3, and (b) there is a bounded number formula_6 of sub-problems of size ~ formula_7 at each stage, then the cost of the divide-and-conquer algorithm will be formula_8.

For other types of divide-and-conquer approaches, running times can also be generalized. For example, when a) the work of splitting the problem and combining the partial solutions take formula_9 time, where formula_3 is the input size and formula_11 is some constant; b) when formula_12, the algorithm takes time upper-bounded by formula_11, and c) there are formula_14 subproblems where each subproblem has size ~ formula_15. Then, the running times are as follows:

* if the number of subproblems formula_16, then the divide-and-conquer algorithm&#x27;s running time is bounded by formula_17.
* if the number of subproblems is exactly one, then the divide-and-conquer algorithm&#x27;s running time is bounded by formula_18.

If, instead, the work of splitting the problem and combining the parital solutions take formula_19 time, and there are 2 subproblems where each has size formula_15, then the running time of the divide-and-conquer algorithm is bounded by formula_21.

=== Parallelism ===
Divide-and-conquer algorithms are naturally adapted for execution in multi-processor machines, especially shared-memory systems where the communication of data between processors does not need to be planned in advance because distinct sub-problems can be executed on different processors.

=== Memory access ===
Divide-and-conquer algorithms naturally tend to make efficient use of memory caches. The reason is that once a sub-problem is small enough, it and all its sub-problems can, in principle, be solved within the cache, without accessing the slower main memory. An algorithm designed to exploit the cache in this way is called &quot;cache-oblivious&quot;, because it does not contain the cache size as an explicit parameter. Moreover, D&amp;C algorithms can be designed for important algorithms (e.g., sorting, FFTs, and matrix multiplication) to be &quot;optimal&quot; cache-oblivious algorithms–they use the cache in a probably optimal way, in an asymptotic sense, regardless of the cache size. In contrast, the traditional approach to exploiting the cache is &quot;blocking&quot;, as in loop nest optimization, where the problem is explicitly divided into chunks of the appropriate size—this can also use the cache optimally, but only when the algorithm is tuned for the specific cache sizes of a particular machine.

The same advantage exists with regards to other hierarchical storage systems, such as NUMA or virtual memory, as well as for multiple levels of cache: once a sub-problem is small enough, it can be solved within a given level of the hierarchy, without accessing the higher (slower) levels.

=== Roundoff control ===
In computations with rounded arithmetic, e.g. with floating-point numbers, a divide-and-conquer algorithm may yield more accurate results than a superficially equivalent iterative method. For example, one can add &quot;N&quot; numbers either by a simple loop that adds each datum to a single variable, or by a D&amp;C algorithm called pairwise summation that breaks the data set into two halves, recursively computes the sum of each half, and then adds the two sums. While the second method performs the same number of additions as the first and pays the overhead of the recursive calls, it is usually more accurate.

== Implementation issues ==

=== Recursion ===
Divide-and-conquer algorithms are naturally implemented as recursive procedures. In that case, the partial sub-problems leading to the one currently being solved are automatically stored in the procedure call stack. A recursive function is a function that calls itself within its definition.

=== Explicit stack ===
Divide-and-conquer algorithms can also be implemented by a non-recursive program that stores the partial sub-problems in some explicit data structure, such as a stack, queue, or priority queue. This approach allows more freedom in the choice of the sub-problem that is to be solved next, a feature that is important in some applications — e.g. in breadth-first recursion and the branch-and-bound method for function optimization. This approach is also the standard solution in programming languages that do not provide support for recursive procedures.

=== Stack size ===
In recursive implementations of D&amp;C algorithms, one must make sure that there is sufficient memory allocated for the recursion stack, otherwise, the execution may fail because of stack overflow. D&amp;C algorithms that are time-efficient often have relatively small recursion depth. For example, the quicksort algorithm can be implemented so that it never requires more than formula_22 nested recursive calls to sort formula_3 items.

Stack overflow may be difficult to avoid when using recursive procedures since many compilers assume that the recursion stack is a contiguous area of memory, and some allocate a fixed amount of space for it. Compilers may also save more information in the recursion stack than is strictly necessary, such as return address, unchanging parameters, and the internal variables of the procedure. Thus, the risk of stack overflow can be reduced by minimizing the parameters and internal variables of the recursive procedure or by using an explicit stack structure.

=== Choosing the base cases ===
In any recursive algorithm, there is considerable freedom in the choice of the &quot;base cases&quot;, the small subproblems that are solved directly in order to terminate the recursion.

Choosing the smallest or simplest possible base cases is more elegant and usually leads to simpler programs, because there are fewer cases to consider and they are easier to solve. For example, a Fast Fourier Transform algorithm could stop the recursion when the input is a single sample, and the quicksort list-sorting algorithm could stop when the input is the empty list; in both examples, there is only one base case to consider, and it requires no processing.

On the other hand, efficiency often improves if the recursion is stopped at relatively large base cases, and these are solved non-recursively, resulting in a hybrid algorithm. This strategy avoids the overhead of recursive calls that do little or no work and may also allow the use of specialized non-recursive algorithms that, for those base cases, are more efficient than explicit recursion. A general procedure for a simple hybrid recursive algorithm is &quot;short-circuiting the base case&quot;, also known as &quot;arm&#x27;s-length recursion&quot;. In this case, whether the next step will result in the base case is checked before the function call, avoiding an unnecessary function call. For example, in a tree, rather than recursing to a child node and then checking whether it is null, checking null before recursing; avoids half the function calls in some algorithms on binary trees. Since a D&amp;C algorithm eventually reduces each problem or sub-problem instance to a large number of base instances, these often dominate the overall cost of the algorithm, especially when the splitting/joining overhead is low. Note that these considerations do not depend on whether recursion is implemented by the compiler or by an explicit stack.

Thus, for example, many library implementations of quicksort will switch to a simple loop-based insertion sort (or similar) algorithm once the number of items to be sorted is sufficiently small. Note that, if the empty list were the only base case, sorting a list with formula_3 entries would entail maximally formula_3 quicksort calls that would do nothing but return immediately. Increasing the base cases to lists of size 2 or less will eliminate most of those do-nothing calls, and more generally a base case larger than 2 is typically used to reduce the fraction of time spent in function-call overhead or stack manipulation.

Alternatively, one can employ large base cases that still use a divide-and-conquer algorithm, but implement the algorithm for predetermined set of fixed sizes where the algorithm can be completely unrolled into code that has no recursion, loops, or conditionals (related to the technique of partial evaluation). For example, this approach is used in some efficient FFT implementations, where the base cases are unrolled implementations of divide-and-conquer FFT algorithms for a set of fixed sizes. Source-code generation methods may be used to produce the large number of separate base cases desirable to implement this strategy efficiently.

The generalized version of this idea is known as recursion &quot;unrolling&quot; or &quot;coarsening&quot;, and various techniques have been proposed for automating the procedure of enlarging the base case.

=== Dynamic programming for overlapping subproblems ===
For some problems, the branched recursion may end up evaluating the same sub-problem many times over. In such cases it may be worth identifying and saving the solutions to these overlapping subproblems, a technique which is commonly known as memoization. Followed to the limit, it leads to bottom-up divide-and-conquer algorithms such as dynamic programming.

<text>Lotfi Aliasker Zadeh (; ; ; 4 February 1921 – 6 September 2017) was a mathematician, computer scientist, electrical engineer, artificial intelligence researcher, and professor of computer science at the University of California, Berkeley. 
Zadeh is best known for proposing fuzzy mathematics, consisting of several &quot;fuzzy&quot;-related concepts: fuzzy sets, fuzzy logic, fuzzy algorithms, fuzzy semantics, fuzzy languages, fuzzy control, fuzzy systems, fuzzy probabilities,&lt;ref name=&quot;doi10.1016/0306-45738490067-0&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; fuzzy events, and fuzzy information.
Zadeh was a founding member of the Eurasian Academy.

==Early life and career==
=== Azerbaijan ===
Zadeh was born in Baku, Azerbaijan SSR, as Lotfi Aliaskerzadeh. His father was Rahim Aleskerzade, an Iranian Muslim Azerbaijani journalist from Ardabil on assignment from Iran, and his mother was Fanya (Feyga) Korenman, a Jewish pediatrician from Odesa, Ukraine, who was an Iranian citizen. The Soviet government at this time courted foreign correspondents, and the family lived well while in Baku. Zadeh attended elementary school for three years there, which he said &quot;had a significant and long-lasting influence on my thinking and my way of looking at things.&quot;

=== Iran ===
In 1931, when Stalin began agricultural collectivization, and Zadeh was ten, his father moved his family back to Tehran, Iran. Zadeh was enrolled in Alborz High School, a missionary school, where he was educated for the next eight years, and where he met his future wife, Fay (Faina) Zadeh, who said that he was &quot;deeply influenced&quot; by the &quot;extremely decent, fine, honest and helpful&quot; Presbyterian missionaries from the United States who ran the college. &quot;To me they represented the best that you could find in the United States – people from the Midwest with strong roots. They were really &#x27;Good Samaritans&#x27; – willing to give of themselves for the benefit of others. So this kind of attitude influenced me deeply. It also instilled in me a deep desire to live in the United States.&quot; During this time, Zadeh was awarded several patents.

Zadeh sat for the Iran national university exams and placed third in the nation. As a student, he ranked first in his class in his first two years. In 1942, he graduated from the University of Tehran with a degree in electrical engineering, one of only three students in that field to graduate that year, due to the turmoil created by World War II, when the United States, Britain and the Soviet Union invaded Iran. Over 30,000 American soldiers were based there, and Zadeh worked with his father, who did business with them as a contractor for hardware and building materials.

=== United States ===
In 1943, Zadeh decided to leave for the United States to continue his education. He travelled to Philadelphia by way of Cairo after months of delay waiting first for the proper papers and later for the right ship to appear. He arrived in mid-1944, lived in New York and worked for an electronic association, and entered the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) as a graduate student in September that year. While in the United States, he shortened his family name, creating a new middle name from the part he removed, and was thenceforth known as Lotfi Aliasker Zadeh. He received an MS degree in electrical engineering from MIT in 1946.

In 1947, as his parents had settled in New York City, Zadeh went to work as an engineer at Columbia University. Zadeh then applied to Columbia University. Columbia admitted him as a doctoral student and offered him an instructorship as well. He received his PhD in electrical engineering from Columbia in 1949 and became an assistant professor the next year. Zadeh taught for ten years at Columbia and was promoted to full professor in 1957.

The chairman of the electronic engineering department at the University of California, wrote and offered him work. In 1959, Zadeh joined the Electrical Engineering faculty at the University of California, Berkeley. During his lengthy research career, Zadeh made important scientific contributions in two distinct areas: (1) linear system theory and classical control systems, and (2) fuzzy sets, fuzzy logic, and related science and technology.

Zadeh was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1967 for Natural Sciences in Applied Mathematics.
Zadeh&#x27;s first important research contribution, well known among scholars of his generation in the electrical engineering community, was in the area of classical control systems. His pioneer work, co-authored with Charles Desoer, &quot;Linear System Theory: The State Space Approach,&quot; laid a critical foundation for all modern approaches to system analysis and control. The second and more well-known contribution of Zadeh&#x27;s research is his lifelong dedication to the creation, enhancement and the real-world impacts of a broad collection of science and technology based on fuzzy sets and fuzzy logic. He published his seminal work on fuzzy sets in 1965, in which he described the motivation of replicating human-like reasoning and detailed the mathematics of fuzzy set theory.

In 1973 he proposed his theory of fuzzy logic. Together, fuzzy sets and fuzzy logic provide the necessary foundations for a broad class of related innovations, including (but not limited to):
* fuzzy control – a practical approach to non-linear control using fuzzy if-then rules in fuzzy logic
* fuzzy pattern recognition – a generalization of conventional pattern recognition techniques using fuzzy sets (e.g., fuzzy k-means generalizes k-means clustering)
* fuzzy database – generalizes classical database query language using fuzzy sets and fuzzy logic
* fuzzy mathematics – generalizes conventional mathematics using fuzzy sets and fuzzy logic
* neuro-fuzzy systems – a synergistic combination of fuzzy logic and neural networks, providing the first interpretable AI system based on neural network learning

He was also on the Board of Governors for International Neural Network Society (INNIS) in 2003.

==Impacts to higher education==
Zadeh became the Chair of Department of Electrical Engineering at the University of California, Berkeley, in 1963. One of the lasting impacts of his leadership in this role is the expansion and the integration of computer science. He initiated and completed (in 1968) the transformation of the Electrical Engineering department at UC Berkeley to the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS). This strategic move not only led UC Berkeley&#x27;s advancement into the top ranks of computer science education and research, but also led other research universities globally to add computer science to their electrical engineering departments.

In 1973, Lotfi Zadeh received the prestigious (Institute of Electronic and Electrical Engineers) IEEE Education Award, largely in recognition of his performance as chair of EE and then EECS. Other important services to UC Berkeley include his Academic Senate committee memberships: Academic Planning &amp; Resource Allocation (1992–95); Committees (1969–70; 1980–81); Courses of Instruction (1975–80); and Faculty Awards (1990–92). Professor Zadeh graduated more than 50 PhD students, many of whom went on to become leaders in various areas of engineering, management and information sciences.

==Personal life and beliefs==

 Zadeh was called &quot;quick to shrug off nationalism, insisting there are much deeper issues in life&quot;, and was quoted as saying in an interview: &quot;The question really isn&#x27;t whether I&#x27;m American, Russian, Iranian, Azerbaijani, or anything else. I&#x27;ve been shaped by all these people and cultures, and I feel quite comfortable among all of them.&quot; He noted in the same interview: &quot;Obstinacy and tenacity, not being afraid to get embroiled in controversy – that&#x27;s very much a Turkish tradition. That&#x27;s part of my character, too. I can be very stubborn. That has probably been beneficial for the development of fuzzy logic.&quot; He described himself as &quot;an American, mathematically oriented, electrical engineer of Iranian descent, born in Russia.&quot;

He and his wife Fay Zadeh had two children, Stella and Norman Zada. His wife wrote a book, &quot;My Life and Travels with the Father of Fuzzy Logic&quot; about their travels and experiences together, visiting &quot;exotic places&quot; and meeting interesting people around the world.

Zadeh died in his home in Berkeley, California, on 6 September 2017, at the age of 96. He was buried at the First Alley of Honors, on 29 September 2017 in Baku, Azerbaijan, the city in which he was born. His funeral was well attended by &quot;highly respected people.&quot; A month prior to his death, the University of Tehran had released an erroneous report that Zadeh had died, but withdrew it several days later.

== Work ==

According to Google Scholar, as of November 2021, Zadeh&#x27;s work has been cited at least 269,091 times in scholarly works, with the 1965 &quot;Fuzzy sets&quot; paper receiving at least 122,743 citations.

=== Fuzzy sets and systems ===
Zadeh, in his theory of fuzzy sets, proposed using a membership function (with a range covering the interval [0,1]) operating on the domain of all possible values. He proposed new operations for the calculus of logic and showed that fuzzy logic was a generalisation of classical and Boolean logic. He also proposed fuzzy numbers as a special case of fuzzy sets, as well as the corresponding rules for consistent mathematical operations (fuzzy arithmetic).

=== Fuzzy logic and artificial intelligence ===
Zadeh&#x27;s research career has had a lasting impact on artificial intelligence (AI). Fuzzy sets and fuzzy logic are both motivated by our understanding of human cognition: that we are comfortable with concepts that have vague boundaries. This is well aligned with the Physical symbol system assumption in AI (by Allen Newell and Herbert A. Simon), inspired by another aspect of human cognition: that humans are comfortable with concepts that are described by symbols.

The concept of a linguistic variable in fuzzy logic connects a symbol that is typically a predicate in classical logic (e.g., &quot;John is Bold&quot;, or in predicate logic – Bold(John)) – to linguistic values (e.g., &quot;John is somewhat bold.&quot; or in fuzzy logic – Bold(John)=Somewhat ) – which generalizes the binary value of predicate logic in two ways. 
First, the two possible values (True or False) in predicate logic are generalized to a continuum (typically from 0, which corresponds to False, to 1, which corresponds to True). This allows the expression of Bold(John)= 0.5, which indicates that John is midway between being devoid of boldness and being entirely bold.

The second generalization enabled by fuzzy logic is to use a fuzzy set such as &quot;somewhat bold&quot; to describe a person&#x27;s boldness level in a way that is more natural to human understanding and communication. Without this generalization, we can only describe the value of a person&#x27;s boldness as a number (e.g., 0.5) or as an interval (e.g., [0.25, 0.75]). With this generalization, one can express the semantic meaning of &quot;somewhat bold&quot; as a fuzzy set in the domain of 0 and 1.

Zadeh was also an active contributor to the AI community, including at the Dartmouth Workshop that coined the term &quot;artificial intelligence&quot;. He was subsequently a frequent contributor to leading AI conferences such as AAAI and IJCAI, as well as other top venues such as AI Magazine.

=== Other contributions ===
Zadeh is credited, along with John R. Ragazzini, in 1952, with having pioneered the development of the Z-transform method in discrete time signal processing and analysis. These methods are now standard in digital signal processing, digital control, and other discrete-time systems used in industry and research. He was an editor of the &quot;International Journal of Computational Cognition&quot;.

Zadeh&#x27;s work also included computing with words and perceptions. His later papers include &quot;From Search Engines to Question-Answering Systems&quot; and &quot;Toward a Generalized Theory of Uncertainty (GTU)—An Outline&quot;.

==Legacy==
In 2014, the IEEE Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Society established the &quot;Lotfi A. Zadeh Pioneer Award&quot;, which is given to honour a person or persons with &quot;outstanding and pioneering contributions to academic and/or industrial research in systems science and engineering, human-machine systems, and/or cybernetics.&quot; The award is funded from a $100,000 donation from Zadeh&#x27;s son, Norm Zadeh, and is administered by the IEEE. Nominees must have &quot;pioneered and developed innovative research, executed in either academe or industry,&quot; that has resulted in major scientific advances in &quot;systems science and engineering, human-machine systems, and/or cybernetics.&quot; Contributions must have been made at least 15 years prior to the award date.

In February 2019, ADA University in Baku, Azerbaijan presented the first &quot;Lotfi Zadeh Scholarships&quot;, which honour the academic success of undergraduate students in the university&#x27;s School of IT and Engineering. Winners of the scholarship receive a complete tuition waiver for the semester or semester-equivalent in which they achieved a 4.0 average.

On 4 February 2021, the IEEE Computational Intelligence Society and the International Fuzzy Systems Association (IFSA) jointly celebrated the centenary of Zadeh&#x27;s birth.

On 30 November 2021, Google honored Zadeh with a Google Doodle. His seminal paper &quot;Fuzzy sets&quot; was submitted for publication on this day in 1964.

<text>Adolfo Bioy Casares (; 15 September 1914 – 8 March 1999) was an Argentine fiction writer, journalist, diarist, and translator. He was a friend and frequent collaborator with his fellow countryman Jorge Luis Borges. He is the author of the Fantastique novel &quot;The Invention of Morel&quot;.

==Biography==
Adolfo Bioy Casares was born on September 15, 1914, in Buenos Aires, the only child of Adolfo Bioy Domecq and Marta Ignacia Casares Lynch. He was born in Recoleta, a neighborhood of Buenos Aires traditionally inhabited by upper-class families, where he would reside the majority of his life. Due to his family&#x27;s high social class, he was able to dedicate himself exclusively to literature and, at the same time, distinguish his work from the traditional literary medium of his time. He wrote his first story (&quot;Iris y Margarita&quot;) at the age of eleven. He began his secondary education in the Instituto Libre de Segunda Enseñanza at the Universidad de Buenos Aires. Later, he started but did not end up finishing degrees in law, philosophy, and literature. Fueled by disappointment with the university atmosphere, he moved to a family ranch where, when he didn&#x27;t have visitors, he devoted himself almost entirely to his study of literature. By the time he reached his late twenties, he maintained proficiency in Spanish, English, French (which he spoke from the age of 4) and German. Between 1929 and 1937 Bioy Casares published a number of books (&quot;Prólogo&quot;, &quot;17 disparos contra lo porvenir&quot;, &quot;Caos&quot;, &quot;La nueva tormenta&quot;, &quot;La estatua casera&quot;, &quot;Luis Greve, muerto&quot;) that he would later disdain, restricting additional publications and refusing to discuss them, labeling all his work previous to 1940 as &#x27;horrible&#x27;.

In 1932 he met Jorge Luis Borges at Villa Ocampo, a house in San Isidro belonging to Victoria Ocampo. There, she often hosted different international figures and organized cultural celebrations, one of which brought Borges and Bioy Casares together. Bioy Casares recalled that on that particular occasion, the two writers stepped away from the rest of the guests, only to be reprimanded by Ocampo. This reproach provoked them to leave the gathering and return to the city together. The journey sealed a lifelong friendship and many influential literary collaborations. Under the pseudonyms H. Bustos Domecq and Benito Suárez Lynch, the two teamed up on a variety of projects from short stories (&quot;Seis problemas para don Isidro Parodi&quot;, &quot;Dos fantasías memorables&quot;, &quot;Un modelo para la muerte&quot;), to screenplays (&quot;Los orilleros&quot;, &quot;Invasión&quot;), and fantastic fiction (&quot;Antología de la literatura fantástica&quot;, &quot;Cuentos breves y extraordinarios&quot;). Between 1945 and 1955, they directed &quot;El séptimo círculo&quot; (&quot;The Seventh Circle&quot;), a collection of translations of popular English detective fiction, a genre that Borges greatly admired. In 2006, &quot;Borges&quot;, a biographical volume of more than 1600 pages from Bioy Casares&#x27; journals, revealed many additional details of the friendship shared by the two writers. Bioy Casares had already prepared and corrected the texts some time previously, but he never was able to publish them himself.

In 1940, he published the short novel &quot;The Invention of Morel&quot;, which marked the beginning of his literary maturity. The novel&#x27;s introduction was written by Borges, in which he comments on the absence of precursors to science fiction in Spanish literature, presenting Bioy Casares as the pioneer of a new genre. The novella was very well accepted and received the Primer Premio Municipal de Literatura (First Municipal Prize of Literature) in 1941. During this same time, in collaboration with Borges and Silvina Ocampo, he published two anthologies: &quot;Antología de la literatura fantástica&quot; (1940) y &quot;Antología poética argentina&quot; (1941).

In 1940, Bioy Casares married Silvina Ocampo, Victoria&#x27;s sister, who was a painter as well as a writer. In 1954, one of Bioy Casares&#x27; mistresses gave birth in the United States to his daughter, Marta, who was subsequently adopted by his wife Silvina. Marta was killed in an automobile accident just three weeks after Silvina Ocampo&#x27;s death, leaving Adolfo with two children. The estate of Silvina Ocampo and Adolfo Bioy Casares was awarded by a Buenos Aires court to yet another love child of Adolfo Bioy Casares, Fabián Bioy. Fabián Bioy died, aged 40, in Paris, France, on 11 February 2006.

Bioy won several awards, including the Gran Premio de Honor of SADE (the Argentine Society of Writers, 1975), the French Legion of Honour (1981), the Diamond Konex Award of Literature (1994) the title of Illustrious Citizen of Buenos Aires (1986), and the Miguel de Cervantes Prize (awarded to him in 1991 in Alcalá de Henares). Adolfo Bioy Casares is buried in La Recoleta Cemetery, Buenos Aires.

==Works==
The best-known novel by Bioy Casares is &quot;La invención de Morel&quot; (&quot;The Invention of Morel&quot;). It is the story of a man who, evading justice, escapes to an island said to be infected with a mysterious fatal disease. Struggling to understand why everything seems to repeat, he realizes that all the people he sees there are actually recordings, made with a special machine, invented by Morel, which is able to record not only three-dimensional images, but also voices and scents, making it all indistinguishable from reality. The story mixes realism, fantasy, science fiction and terror. Borges wrote an introduction in which he called it a work of &quot;reasoned imagination&quot; and linked it to H. G. Wells&#x27; &quot;oeuvre&quot;. Both Borges and Octavio Paz described the novel as &quot;perfect&quot;. The story is held to be the inspiration for Alan Resnais&#x27;s &quot;Last Year at Marienbad&quot; and an influence on the TV series &quot;Lost&quot;.

<doc id="201164" wikidata="Q1139460" url="?curid=201164" title="Undertow (Tool album)">
<text>Undertow is the debut studio album by the American rock band Tool, released on April 6, 1993, by Zoo Entertainment. Produced by the band and Sylvia Massy and recorded from October to December 1992 at Sound City Studios in Van Nuys and Grandmaster Recorders in Hollywood, the album includes some tracks omitted from the band&#x27;s debut EP &quot;Opiate&quot; and is their only album to feature original bassist Paul D&#x27;Amour.

According to AllMusic, &quot;Undertow&quot; helped heavy metal remain prominent as a mainstream musical style, and allowed several later bands to break through to the mainstream. It was released at a time when grunge was at the height of its popularity, and pop punk was slowly beginning to gather mainstream attention. AllMusic saw the album&#x27;s success in the &quot;striking, haunting visuals that complemented the album&#x27;s nihilistic yet wistful mood.&quot;

As of 2020, &quot;Undertow&quot; has been certified triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America for selling over 3 million copies in the United States.

==Background==
Comedian Bill Hicks is noted as &quot;inspiration&quot; in the album&#x27;s liner notes. &quot;Undertow&quot; is the only Tool album released while he was still alive. Hicks&#x27;s presence would feature prominently on Tool&#x27;s next album, &quot;Ænima&quot;.

Chris Haskett, then with the Rollins Band, is credited in the liner notes with &quot;sledge hammer&quot;, probably relating to the &quot;three pianos and shotguns smashed with sledgehammers&quot; on &quot;Disgustipated&quot;. Adam Jones recalls a story in which the band purchased two second-hand pianos with the intention of blasting them with shotguns in the indoor parking lot of Grand Master Studio and putting the resulting sounds to tape. Apparently the woman running the studio was happy as long as they cleaned up the mess afterwards. Since the incident, Tool has been approached by other bands claiming to have seen the shotgun holes left by them in the carpark wall.

==Artwork==
The album art was designed by Adam Jones. Photos in the liner notes of a nude obese woman, a nude thin man, and the band members with pins in the sides of their heads generated controversy, resulting in the album being removed from stores such as Kmart and Walmart. The band reacted by releasing another version, which depicted a giant barcode on a white background. This version of the album included a note from the band:
The message on the photographs of the band members reads &quot;Trust me trust me trust me trust me trust me I just want to start this over say you won&#x27;t go this is love I&#x27;ll make weapons out of my imperfections lay back and let me show you another way only this one holy medium brings me peace of mind cleanse and purge me in the water twice as loud as reason euphoria I&#x27;ve been far too sympathetic no one told you to come I hope it sucks you down life feeds on life this is necessary.&quot; The songs the lyrics contained in the passage are from appear in this order: &quot;Sober&quot;, &quot;Crawl Away&quot;, &quot;4°&quot;, &quot;Prison Sex&quot;, &quot;Flood&quot;, &quot;Undertow&quot;, &quot;Intolerance&quot;, &quot;Swamp Song&quot;, &quot;Disgustipated&quot;. The only quote missing from the album is &quot;I&#x27;ll make weapons out of my imperfections&quot;, a line from Maynard&#x27;s original lyrics for &quot;Bottom&quot; before they were modified by guest Henry Rollins.

In some versions of the album, when the black CD tray is removed from the case, a picture of a cow licking what appears to be its genital region is revealed. In other versions of the album, released internationally, the picture of the cow licking the genital region is viewable without problems under the transparent backing of the disc case. The photo of the cow is accredited in the album&#x27;s liner notes to have been taken by Danielle Bregman. The ribcage is also on the front cover of the album, but the obese woman is absent from the booklet; only the members of the band are depicted.

Adam Jones&#x27; pet pig, Moe, appears on the back cover amid an array of forks standing on end.

==Reception==
AllMusic gave the album a positive review, stating &quot;With its technical brilliance, musical complexities, and aggressive overtones, &quot;Undertow&quot; not only paved the way for several bands to break through to the mainstream adolescent mall-rage demographic, it also proved that metal could be simultaneously intelligent, emotional, and brutal.&quot; In &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s review of the album, David Browne said &quot;Like many of its brethren in the alternative-metal corps—Alice in Chains, Stone Temple Pilots, and Helmet—Tool can crunch and lumber about with the best of them. What put this L.A. band a notch above the rest are better songs (with actual verses, choruses, and hooks-check out the terrific &quot;Prison Sex&quot;) and the hints of vulnerability in singer Maynard James Keenan&#x27;s voice&quot;.

In a Dotdash bibliographical article of the band, reviewer Tim Grierson called the album the &quot;Essential Tool Album&quot; and stated &quot;It may be impossible to describe the impact that &quot;Undertow&quot; had at the time of its release in 1993. Searching, angry, liberating and scary, Tool&#x27;s full-length debut emerged during a period in rock music when Seattle bands like Nirvana and Pearl Jam were expressing alienation through grunge riffs, inspiring lots of copycat artists. &quot;Undertow&quot; expressed alienation, too, but the album&#x27;s imposing waves of misery and dread seemed to come from an entirely different planet than grunge, providing a startling counterpoint to the trendy sounds of the era&quot;. A less positive review came from &quot;Select&quot; writer Andrew Perry, who said &quot;[B]ereft of the irony, danger and maverick punkiness of grunge&#x27;s finest, Tool ultimately will only help Alice In Chains reassert the trad metal market. Which really isn&#x27;t what we deserve.&quot;

==Accolades==


==Track listing==

Note
* &quot;Disgustipated&quot; is track 69 on most pressings in North America (tracks 10–68 are silent; tracks 10–67 are one second each in length, and track 68 is two seconds). It also appears as track 39, track 10 (mostly in Europe and Australia) or as a hidden track following &quot;Flood&quot; on track nine. On certain Japanese imports, &quot;Disgustipated&quot; is track 70 and the tracklist is removed from the back. In most cases, however, it is listed as track 10 on the album itself.

==Release history==


# The promotional vinyl did not include the final track &quot;Disgustipated&quot; so that the entire album could fit onto one disc. Because it is promotional, it is possible that it was released before the regular pressing, therefore, only the year is listed.
# The year 1996 represents the year that Volcano Entertainment began using its own logo on releases which formerly used the Zoo Entertainment logo. In reality, 1996 reissues with the Volcano logo may not have actually been widely distributed until early in 1997.
# The year 1999 represents the year that Tool&#x27;s Tool Dissectional label was used in conjunction with Volcano. Strong evidence supports a North American reissue date of July 1, 1999, however, the European ones are unknown. To be cautious, only the year is given for all releases of this nature.
# The year 2004 represents the year that Sony BMG was created. These reissues contain artwork that depicts Sony BMG as the distributor. Since Sony BMG&#x27;s pressing schedule is not known, the actual release date may be sometime in 2004 or 2005.

<doc id="201167" wikidata="Q1503756" url="?curid=201167" title="Opiate (EP)">
<text>Opiate is an EP by the American rock band Tool. It was produced and engineered by Sylvia Massy and Steve Hansgen. Released in 1992, it was the result of two years of the band playing together after their formation in 1990. &quot;Opiate&quot; preceded Tool&#x27;s first full-length release, &quot;Undertow&quot;, by a year. It is named after a quote by Karl Marx: &quot;religion ... is the opiate of the masses&quot;. It was certified platinum by the RIAA. The EP charted on several international charts when Tool released their catalog to online streaming in August 2019.

==Background and recording==
&quot;Opiate&quot; features seven songs spanning six tracks, two of which are live recordings. Most versions of the EP (all except the cassette) feature the hidden seventh song titled &quot;The Gaping Lotus Experience&quot;. On CD versions, the song is hidden at the end of the last track of the album, &quot;Opiate&quot;, and begins approximately 6 minutes and 10 seconds into the track after &quot;Opiate&quot; has concluded. Vinyl copies of the EP featured a double groove on the second side; one which contained &quot;Cold and Ugly&quot;, with the second containing &quot;The Gaping Lotus Experience&quot; and a small period of silence. Both grooves led into &quot;Jerk-Off&quot;.

The song &quot;Sweat&quot; was featured on the &quot;Escape from L.A.&quot; soundtrack.

&quot;Cold and Ugly&quot; and &quot;Jerk-Off&quot; were recorded specially for the album at the Jellö Loft on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1991 with a live audience. As a result, these two songs have never been available as true &quot;studio&quot; recordings except for the band&#x27;s 1991 demo tape &quot;72826&quot;. This demo tape also featured early versions of &quot;Hush&quot; and &quot;Part of Me&quot; (as well as &quot;Crawl Away&quot; and &quot;Sober&quot;, which would eventually make it on &quot;Undertow&quot;), and was used to get the band signed. All four songs were re-recorded for this album.

In the original CD inserts for the album there is a collage of photos of the band members as children, among various items and trinkets, and also includes a picture of someone engaging in necrophilia with a well-decomposed cadaver. In reality, it is a friend of the band joking around in prop maker Stan Winston&#x27;s studio.

A black and white music video was made for the track &quot;Hush&quot;, the band&#x27;s first. The Canadian music channel MuchMusic played it regularly.

==Music and lyrics==
Along with &quot;Undertow&quot;, many Tool fans consider &quot;Opiate&quot; to be the band&#x27;s heaviest album. The connection fans have to the EP was addressed on the song &quot;Hooker with a Penis&quot; from their third release and second LP &quot;Ænima&quot;. The EP features straightforward song structures in place of the progressive traits the band became known for later in their career. In a 2013 interview, guitarist Adam Jones stated &quot;I love metal, but I love the other stuff that&#x27;s been contributed by the band. When we started out, the record company said that we had to pick our heaviest songs, because that&#x27;s the impact - you&#x27;re metal and that&#x27;s really important.&quot;

Lyrical subjects explored on &quot;Opiate&quot; include censorship and organized religion.

==2013 reissue==
On March 26, 2013 the band released a special 21st anniversary limited edition package of the album, which includes bonus features, such as new artwork. The artist Adi Granov provided the illustrations for the packaging and It was limited to only 5,000 copies. The packaging was also done with an old fashioned Heidelberg Cylinder Press.

<doc id="201170" wikidata="Q934638" url="?curid=201170" title="Lake Winnipegosis">
<text>Lake Winnipegosis is a large (5,370 km2) lake in central North America, in Manitoba, Canada, some 300 km northwest of Winnipeg. It is Canada&#x27;s eleventh-largest lake.

The lake&#x27;s name derives from that of Lake Winnipeg, with a diminutive suffix. Winnipeg means &#x27;big muddy waters&#x27; and Winnipegosis means &#x27;little muddy waters&#x27;.

It appears as Winipgassish on the Fidler map of 1820, while modern spelling dates from as early as 1811.

== Geography ==
The elongated 195-kilometre-long lake is the second-largest of three large lakes in central Manitoba; the other two are Lake Winnipeg, the largest, and Lake Manitoba. All three lakes are on the floor of the prehistoric glacial Lake Agassiz (as are nearby Cedar Lake and the Lake of the Woods). The lake&#x27;s watershed extends over some 49,825 km2 in Manitoba and Saskatchewan. It receives most of its waters from the Manitoba Escarpment.

Lake Winnipegosis is separated from Cedar Lake by a 6 km (3.7 miles) wide (minimum width) land barrier at the north end and from Lake Manitoba by a 3 km (1.9 miles) wide (minimum width) land barrier at the southeast end at Meadow Portage.

Birch Island is the largest island on Lake Winnipegosis. The island, located near the middle of the lake, is part of Birch Island Provincial Park, created in 2010, and is adjacent to the Chitek Lake Park Reserve on the eastern shore.

=== Outflows ===
The lake drains through the Waterhen River into Lake Manitoba, and is thus part of the Lake Winnipeg, Nelson River, and Hudson Bay watersheds. From Long Island Bay at the southeast end of the lake the West Waterhen and Little Waterhen rivers flow north about 16 km (10 miles) into Waterhen Lake then the Waterhen River flows south 22 km (13.5 miles) into Lake Manitoba.

=== Tributaries ===
Tributaries include the Mossey River (from Dauphin Lake), Point River, Pine River, North Duck River, Pelican River (from Pelican Lake), Shoal River (from Swan Lake), Steeprock River, Red Deer River, and the Overflowing River.

== Communities ==
The communities of Winnipegosis, Camperville, Pine Creek, Duck Bay, Salt Point and Meadow Portage are south of Birch Island while Shoal River, Pelican Rapids, Dawson Bay and Denbeigh Point are to the north of the island.

== Fisheries ==
The lake supports a commercial fishery of walleye and other freshwater species. Northern pike and mullet together now account for over 80 percent of its commercial fishing.

<doc id="201174" wikidata="Q860442" url="?curid=201174" title="Sunset Boulevard">
<text>Sunset Boulevard is a boulevard in the central and western part of Los Angeles, California, United States, that stretches from the Pacific Coast Highway in Pacific Palisades east to Figueroa Street in downtown Los Angeles. It is a major thoroughfare in the cities of Beverly Hills and West Hollywood (including a portion known as the Sunset Strip), as well as several districts in Los Angeles.

== Geography ==
Approximately in length, the boulevard roughly traces the arc of mountains that form part of the northern boundary of the Los Angeles Basin, following the path of a 1780s cattle trail from the Pueblo de Los Angeles to the ocean.

From Downtown Los Angeles, the boulevard heads northwest, to Hollywood, through which it travels due west for several miles before it bends southwest towards the ocean. It passes through or near Echo Park, Silver Lake, Los Feliz, Hollywood, West Hollywood, Beverly Hills, and Holmby Hills. In Bel-Air, Sunset Boulevard runs along the northern boundary of UCLA&#x27;s Westwood campus. The boulevard continues through Brentwood to Pacific Palisades, where it terminates at the Pacific Coast Highway intersection.

The boulevard has curvaceous winding stretches, and can be treacherous for unalert drivers in some sections. Sunset Boulevard is at least four lanes wide along its entire route. Sunset is frequently congested with traffic loads beyond its design capacity.

Sunset Boulevard historically extended farther east than it does now, starting at Alameda Street near Union Station and beside Olvera Street in the historic section of Downtown. The portion of Sunset Boulevard east of Figueroa Street was renamed Cesar Chavez Avenue in 1994, along with Macy Street and Brooklyn Avenue, in honor of the late Mexican-American union leader and civil rights activist.

==History==
In 1877, Harvey Henderson Wilcox, one of the earlier real estate owners from &quot;back East&quot;, decided to subdivide more than of land (mostly orchards and vineyards) along Sunset Boulevard, including what is today Hollywood and Vine.

In 1890, Belgian diplomat Victor Ponet bought of the former Rancho La Brea land grant. His son-in-law, Francis S. Montgomery, inherited this property and created Sunset Plaza.

According to a 1901 article in the &quot;Los Angeles Herald&quot;, Sunset only extended from Hollywood in the west to Marion Avenue in the Echo Park district in the east. The Board of Public Works proposed to extend Sunset east to Main Street in the Plaza by routing the road over the existing section of Bellevue Avenue, but the plan was delayed until approximately 1904, due to active opposition by affected land owners. According to the 1910 Baist Real Estate Survey Atlas, Sunset Boulevard reached the Plaza by that time, but it did so by two short and narrow segments which were not aligned with each other and thus did not provide a proper thoroughfare to it. In late 1912, several properties along the route were condemned so that the boulevard could be changed in both its width and its alignment. With these changes completed, Sunset Boulevard now reached North Main Street and continued as Marchessault along the northern end of the Plaza. This section, variously marked and signed as Marchessault Street or East Sunset Boulevard, remained open to traffic until the late 1960s or early 1970s. At that time, Sunset was realigned one block north and Marchessault was closed to motor traffic.

In 1921, a westward expansion of Sunset began, extending the road from the then-current terminus at Sullivan Canyon toward the coast. This land, a portion of the original 1838 holdings of Francisco Marquez, stretched across a mesa and became known as the &quot;Riviera section&quot;. Will Rogers, who had bought much of this land as an investment, later donated it to the State of California creating Will Rogers State Historic Park. , Sunset was a paved road from Horn Avenue to Havenhurst Avenue.

The westernmost stretch of Sunset Boulevard in Pacific Palisades runs through an area devastated by the January 2025 Southern California wildfires. Many homes, businesses, and landmarks along the boulevard, such as the Pacific Palisades Business Block, were burned down.

== Cultural aspects ==
The Sunset Strip portion of Sunset Boulevard in West Hollywood has been famous for its active nightlife since at least the 1950s.

In contrast to other American cities where it referred to a concentration of radio retailers, in Los Angeles, Radio Row was understood in the 1940s–1950s as the area around the intersection of Sunset Boulevard and Vine Street in Hollywood, where the broadcasting facilities of all four major radio networks were located.

In the 1970s, the area between Gardner Street and Western Avenue was a center for street prostitution. Shortly after a much publicized incident in late June 1995, police raids drove out the majority of prostitutes on the Boulevard.

Part of Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood is also sometimes called &quot;Guitar Row&quot; due to the large number of guitar stores and music industry-related businesses, including the recording studios Sunset Sound Studios and United Western Recorders.

The portion of Sunset Boulevard that passes through Beverly Hills was once named Beverly Boulevard.

The boulevard is commemorated in Billy Wilder&#x27;s film &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; (1950), the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical of the same name, and the 1950s television series &quot;77 Sunset Strip&quot;. Jan and Dean&#x27;s 1960s hit song &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Curve&quot; refers to a section of the road near Bel Air estates just north of UCLA&#x27;s Drake Stadium where Jan Berry almost died in an automobile accident in 1966. The Buffalo Springfield song &quot;For What It&#x27;s Worth&quot; was written about a riot at Pandora&#x27;s Box, a Sunset Strip club, in 1966.

Metro Local lines 2, 4 and 602 operate on Sunset Boulevard, with Line 2 running through most of Sunset Boulevard between Echo Park and UCLA, Line 4 between Sunset Junction and Downtown LA, and Line 602 from UCLA west. The Metro B Line operates a subway station at Vermont Avenue.

At 4334 W. Sunset Boulevard lies the wall featured on the cover of the late singer-songwriter Elliott Smith&#x27;s 2000 album &quot;Figure 8&quot;. Since Smith&#x27;s death in 2003, the wall has become a memorial for the artist; fans have left many personal messages there over the years.

<doc id="201176" wikidata="Q334845" url="?curid=201176" title="Muromachi period">
<text>The , also known as the , is a division of Japanese history running from approximately 1336 to 1573. The period marks the governance of the Muromachi or Ashikaga shogunate ( or ), which was officially established in 1338 by the first Muromachi &quot;shōgun&quot;, Ashikaga Takauji, two years after the brief Kenmu Restoration (1333–1336) of imperial rule was brought to a close. The period ended in 1573 when the 15th and last shogun of this line, Ashikaga Yoshiaki, was driven out of the capital in Kyoto by Oda Nobunaga.

From a cultural perspective, the period can be divided into the Kitayama and Higashiyama cultures (later 15th – early 16th centuries).

The early years from 1336 to 1392 of the Muromachi period are known as the or Northern and Southern Court period. This period is marked by the continued resistance of the supporters of Emperor Go-Daigo, the emperor behind the Kenmu Restoration. The Sengoku period or Warring States period, which begins in 1465, largely overlaps with the Muromachi period. The Muromachi period is succeeded by the Azuchi–Momoyama period (1568–1600), the final phase of the Sengoku period, and later by the Edo period (1603–1867).

== Muromachi bakufu ==
Emperor Go-Daigo&#x27;s brief attempt to restore imperial power in the Kenmu Restoration alienated the samurai class, and Ashikaga Takauji deposed Emperor Go-Daigo with their support. In 1338 Takauji was proclaimed &quot;shōgun&quot; and established his government in Kyoto. However, Emperor Go-Daigo escaped from his confinement and revived his political power in Nara. The ensuing period of Ashikaga rule (1336–1573) was called Muromachi after the district of Kyoto in which its headquarters – the – were relocated by the third &quot;shōgun&quot; Ashikaga Yoshimitsu, in 1378. What distinguished the Ashikaga shogunate from that of Kamakura was that, whereas Kamakura had existed in equilibrium with the imperial court, Ashikaga took over the remnants of the imperial government. Nevertheless, the Ashikaga shogunate was not as strong as Kamakura had been, and was greatly preoccupied with civil war. Not until the rule of Ashikaga Yoshimitsu (as &quot;shōgun&quot;, 1368–94, and chancellor, 1394–1408) did a semblance of order emerge.

Yoshimitsu allowed the constables, who had had limited powers during the Kamakura period, to become strong regional rulers, later called &quot;daimyōs&quot;. In time, a balance of power evolved between the &quot;shōgun&quot; and the &quot;daimyōs&quot;; the three most prominent &quot;daimyō&quot; families rotated as deputies to the &quot;shōgun&quot; at Kyoto. Yoshimitsu was finally successful in reunifying the Northern and Southern courts in 1392, but despite his promise of greater balance between the imperial lines, the Northern Court maintained control over the throne thereafter. The line of shoguns gradually weakened after Yoshimitsu and increasingly lost power to the &quot;daimyōs&quot; and other regional strongmen. The &quot;shōgun&quot;″s influence on imperial succession waned, and the &quot;daimyōs&quot; could back their own candidates.

In time, the Ashikaga family had its own succession problems, resulting finally in the Ōnin War (1467–77), which left Kyoto devastated and effectively ended the national authority of the &quot;bakufu&quot;. The power vacuum that ensued launched a century of anarchy.

== Economic and cultural developments ==

The Japanese contact with the Ming dynasty (1368–1644) began when China was renewed during the Muromachi period after the Chinese sought support in suppressing Japanese pirates in coastal areas of China. Japanese pirates of this era and region were referred to as &quot;wokou&quot; by the Chinese (Japanese &quot;wakō&quot;). Wanting to improve relations with China and to rid Japan of the wokou threat, Yoshimitsu accepted a relationship with the Chinese that was to last for half a century. In 1401 he restarted the tribute system, describing himself in a letter to the Chinese Emperor as &quot;Your subject, the King of Japan&quot;. Japanese wood, sulfur, copper ore, swords, and folding fans were traded for Chinese silk, porcelain, books, and coins, in what the Chinese considered tribute but the Japanese saw as profitable trade.

During the time of the Ashikaga bakufu, a new national culture, called Muromachi culture, emerged from the bakufu headquarters in Kyoto to reach all levels of society, strongly influenced by Zen Buddhism.

=== Zen Buddhism === 
Zen played a central role in spreading not only religious teachings and practices but also art and culture, including influences derived from paintings of the Chinese Song (960–1279), Yuan, and Ming dynasties. The proximity of the imperial court to the bakufu resulted in a co-mingling of imperial family members, courtiers, daimyō, samurai, and Zen priests. During the Muromachi period, the re-constituted &quot;Blue Cliff Record&quot; became the central text of Japanese Zen literature; it still holds that position today.

Art of all kinds—architecture, literature, Noh drama, Kyōgen (comedy), poetry, sarugaku (folk entertainment), the tea ceremony, landscape gardening, and flower arranging—all flourished during Muromachi times.

=== Shinto ===

There was renewed interest in Shinto, which had quietly coexisted with Buddhism during the centuries of the latter&#x27;s predominance. Shinto, which lacked its own scriptures and had few prayers, had, as a result of syncretic practices begun in the Nara period, widely adopted Shingon Buddhist rituals. Between the eighth and fourteenth centuries, Shinto was nearly totally absorbed by Buddhism, becoming known as Ryōbu Shinto (Dual Shinto).

The Mongol invasions in the late thirteenth century, however, evoked a national consciousness of the role of the kamikaze in defeating the enemy. Less than fifty years later (1339–43), Kitabatake Chikafusa (1293–1354), the chief commander of the Southern Court forces, wrote the &quot;Jinnō Shōtōki&quot;. This chronicle emphasized the importance of maintaining the divine descent of the imperial line from Amaterasu to the current emperor, a condition that gave Japan a special national polity (kokutai). Besides reinforcing the concept of the emperor as a deity, the &quot;Jinnōshōtōki&quot; provided a Shinto view of history, which stressed the divine nature of all Japanese and the country&#x27;s spiritual supremacy over China and India. Buddhism, arriving in the 6th century, impacted education but did not replace Shinto.

=== Education ===
Confucianism began to be recognized as essential to the education of a daimyo in the Muromachi period. When Genju Keian, who returned from the Ming dynasty, traveled around Kyushu, he was invited by the Kikuchi clan in Higo Province and the Shimazu clan in Satsuma Province to give a lecture; and later, he established the Satsunan school (school of Neo-Confucianism in Satsuma). In Tosa, Baiken Minamimura, who lectured on Neo-Confucianism, became known as the founder of Nangaku (Neo-Confucianism in Tosa); in Hokuriku region, Nobutaka Kiyohara lectured on Confucianism for various daimyo such as the Hatakeyama clan in Noto Province, the Takeda clan in Wakasa Province, and the Asakura clan in Echizen Province.

Meanwhile, in the eastern part of Japan, Norizane Uesugi re-established the Ashikaga Gakko, Japan&#x27;s oldest surviving academic institution, by adding a collection of books and so priests and warriors from all over the country gathered there to learn. For the Ashikaga Gakko, the Gohojo clan in Odawara provided protection later. Francis Xavier, a missionary of the Society of Jesus, who propagated Christianity in Japan, described that &quot;the Ashikaga Gakko is the biggest and most famous academy of Bando in Japan (the university of eastern Japan).&quot; Shukyu Banri, a priest and a composer of Chinese-style poems, went down to Mino Province in the Onin War, and then left for Edo at Dokan Ota&#x27;s invitation. He traveled all over the Kanto region, Echigo Province, and Hida Province. The above-mentioned Sesshu visited the Risshaku-ji Temple in Yamagata City, Dewa Province.

In this period, local lords and local clans considered it indispensable to acquire skills of reading, writing, and arithmetic for the management of their territories. A growing number of land deeds were written by peasants, which means that literacy was widespread even among the commoner class. The Italian Jesuit, Alessandro Valignano (1539–1606), wrote:&quot;The people are white (not dark-skinned) and cultured; even the common folk and peasants are well brought up and are so remarkably polite that they give the impression that they were trained at court. In this respect they are superior to other Eastern peoples but also to Europeans as well. They are very capable and intelligent, and the children are quick to grasp our lessons and instructions. They learn to read and write our language far more quickly and easily than children in Europe. The lower classes in Japan are not so coarse and ignorant as those in Europe; on the contrary, they are generally intelligent, well brought up and quick to learn.&quot;&quot;Teikin Orai&quot; (Home Education Text Book), &quot;Joe-shikimoku&quot; (legal code of the Kamakura shogunate), and &quot;Jitsugokyo&quot; (a text for primary education) were widely used in shrines and temples as textbooks for the education of children of the warrior class. It was in the Sengoku Period that the following books were published: &quot;Setsuyoshu&quot; (a Japanese-language dictionary in iroha order) written by Soji MANJUYA, and &quot;Ishotaizen&quot; (The Complete Book of Medicine), a medical book in Ming&#x27;s language, translated by Asai no Sozui, who was a merchant in Sakai City and a physician.

=== Ink painting ===
The new Zen monasteries, with their Chinese background and the martial rulers in Kamakura sought to produce a unique cultural legacy to rival the Fujiwara tradition. Hence, Chinese painter-monks were frequently invited to the monasteries while Japanese monks travelled back and forth. This exchange led to the creation of Muromachi ink painting which often included Chinese themes, Chinese ink-washing techniques, fluid descriptive lines, dry brushes, and almost invisible facial features. Despite the initial creative restrictions, Japanese Zen ink painting soon achieved poetic and indigenous expression as elements were rearranged in a Japanese manner, and brushstrokes became gentle, fluid and more impulsive.

== Provincial wars and foreign contacts ==
The Ōnin War (1467–77) led to serious political fragmentation and obliteration of domains: a great struggle for land and power ensued among &quot;bushi&quot; chieftains and lasted until the mid-sixteenth century. Peasants rose against their landlords and samurai against their overlords as central control virtually disappeared. The imperial house was left impoverished, and the &quot;bakufu&quot; was controlled by contending chieftains in Kyoto. The provincial domains that emerged after the Ōnin War were smaller and easier to control. Many new small &quot;daimyō&quot; arose from among the samurai who had overthrown their great overlords. Border defenses were improved, and well fortified castle towns were built to protect the newly opened domains, for which land surveys were made, roads built, and mines opened. New house laws provided practical means of administration, stressing duties and rules of behavior. Emphasis was put on success in war, estate management, and finance. Threatening alliances were guarded against through strict marriage rules. Aristocratic society was overwhelmingly military in character. The rest of society was controlled in a system of vassalage. The &quot;shōen&quot; (feudal manors) were obliterated, and court nobles and absentee landlords were dispossessed. The new daimyō directly controlled the land, keeping the peasantry in permanent serfdom in exchange for protection.

=== Economic effect of wars between states ===
Most wars of the period were short and localized, although they occurred throughout Japan. By 1500 the entire country was engulfed in civil wars. Rather than disrupting the local economies, however, the frequent movement of armies stimulated the growth of transportation and communications, which in turn provided additional revenues from customs and tolls. To avoid such fees, commerce shifted to the central region, which no daimyō had been able to control, and to the Inland Sea. Economic developments and the desire to protect trade achievements brought about the establishment of merchant and artisan guilds.

=== Western influence ===
By the end of the Muromachi period, the first Europeans had arrived. The Portuguese landed in Tanegashima south of Kyūshū in 1543 and within two years were making regular port calls, initiating the century-long Nanban trade period. In 1551, the Navarrese Roman Catholic missionary Francis Xavier was one of the first Westerners who visited Japan. Francis described Japan as follows:

The Spanish arrived in 1587, followed by the Dutch in 1609. The Japanese began to attempt studies of European civilization in depth, and new opportunities were presented for the economy, along with serious political challenges. European firearms, fabrics, glassware, clocks, tobacco, and other Western innovations were traded for Japanese gold and silver. Significant wealth was accumulated through trade, and lesser daimyō, especially in Kyūshū, greatly increased their power. Provincial wars became more deadly with the introduction of firearms, such as muskets and cannons, and greater use of infantry.

=== Christianity ===
Christianity affected Japan, largely through the efforts of the Jesuits, led first by the Spanish Francis Xavier (1506–1552), who arrived in Kagoshima in southern Kyūshū in 1549. Both daimyō and merchants seeking better trade arrangements as well as peasants were among the converts. By 1560 Kyoto had become another major area of missionary activity in Japan. In 1568 the port of Nagasaki, in northwestern Kyūshū, was established by a Christian daimyō and was turned over to Jesuit administration in 1579. By 1582 there were as many as 150,000 converts (two percent of the population) and 200 churches. But &quot;bakufu&quot; tolerance for this alien influence diminished as the country became more unified and openness decreased. Proscriptions against Christianity began in 1587 and outright persecutions in 1597. Although foreign trade was still encouraged, it was closely regulated, and by 1640, in the Edo period, the exclusion and suppression of Christianity became national policy.

<text>HMS &quot;Ark Royal&quot; (pennant number 91) was an aircraft carrier of the Royal Navy that was operated during the Second World War.

Designed in 1934 to fit the restrictions of the Washington Naval Treaty, &quot;Ark Royal&quot; was built by Cammell Laird at Birkenhead, England, and completed in November 1938. Her design differed from previous aircraft carriers. &quot;Ark Royal&quot; was the first ship on which the hangars and flight deck were an integral part of the hull, instead of an add-on or part of the . Designed to carry a large number of aircraft, she had two hangar deck levels. She was used during a period that first saw the extensive use of naval air power; several carrier tactics were developed and refined aboard &quot;Ark Royal&quot;.

&quot;Ark Royal&quot; operated in some of the most active naval theatres of the Second World War. She was involved in the first aerial U-boat kills of the war, operations off Norway, the search for the German battleship , and the Malta Convoys. &quot;Ark Royal&quot; survived several near misses and gained a reputation as a &#x27;lucky ship&#x27;. She was torpedoed on 13 November 1941 by the and sank the following day. One of her 1,488 crew members was killed. Her sinking was the subject of several inquiries, with investigators keen to know how the carrier was lost in spite of efforts to save the ship and tow her to the naval base at Gibraltar. They found that several design flaws contributed to the loss, which were rectified in new British carriers.

The wreck was discovered in December 2002 by an American underwater survey company using sonar mounted on an autonomous underwater vehicle, under contract from the BBC for the filming of a documentary about the ship, at a depth of about and approximately from Gibraltar.

==Design==
In 1923, the Admiralty prepared a 10-year building programme which included an aircraft carrier and 300 aircraft for the Fleet Air Arm. The economic downturn following the First World War caused it to be postponed. In 1930, the Director of Naval Construction, Sir Arthur Johns, began to update the plans for the carrier by incorporating recently developed technology. His aim was to increase the number of aircraft carried by shortening the landing and take-off distances of aircraft using arrestor gear and compressed steam catapults respectively, which would make more deck space available for storage and aircraft preparation. Along with the inclusion of two hangar decks, this allowed &quot;Ark Royal&quot; to carry up to 72 aircraft, although the development of larger and heavier aircraft during the carrier&#x27;s construction meant that the actual number carried was between 50 and 60. &quot;Ark Royal&quot; featured an enclosed hangar design where the flight deck was the &#x27;strength deck&#x27; and was strongly built with .75in (19mm) thick Ducol steel plating. The two hangar decks were thus enclosed within the hull girder, which also gave splinter protection to the hangars. The machinery spaces were protected by belt armour. Three lifts moved aircraft between the hangars and the flight deck.
Another feature was the length and height of the flight deck. At , the flight deck was longer than the keel; the latter dictated by the length of Royal Navy drydocks in Gibraltar and Malta. Due to the twin hangar decks, the flight deck rose to above the waterline.

The Washington and London Naval treaties had restricted warship displacement for a number of nations after the end of the Great War and were both to expire by the end of 1936. With a potential naval arms race developing between Britain, Japan and Italy, the British government sought a second treaty, which included limiting the maximum displacement of an aircraft carrier to . &quot;Ark Royal&quot; would have to fit this anticipated limit; to conserve weight, armour plating was limited to the belt, engine rooms, and magazines, while welding instead of rivetting 65% of the hull saved . Installation of an armoured flight deck was not possible, as the weight would have placed &quot;Ark Royal&quot; above the proposed limit, while reducing her endurance and stability. The ship was designed with a three-layer side protection system based upon a void-liquid-void scheme very similar to that used on the &quot;King George V&quot;-class battleships, and was designed to protect against torpedoes with up to a warhead.

The ship was fitted with six boilers, which powered three Parsons geared turbines. The turbines were connected via three driveshafts to three propellers in diameter, to produce a maximum theoretical speed of . Speed was important, as with catapults and arrestor gear, &quot;Ark Royal&quot; would have to turn into the wind to launch and recover aircraft. To avoid endangering other ships with the frequent course changes associated with flight operations, &quot;Ark Royal&quot; would have to break away from accompanying ships, and catch up on completion. Additionally, as the carrier was not armed for ship-to-ship combat, speed was her main protection against enemy warships.

==Construction==
The deteriorating international situation by 1933, typified by Germany&#x27;s rearmament and the expansion of Japan and Italy, convinced the British to announce funds for the carrier&#x27;s construction in the 1934 budget proposals. The plans were finished by November 1934 and were tendered in February 1935 to Cammell Laird and Company Ltd., which calculated the cost of the hull at £1,496,250 (equivalent to £ in ) and the main machinery at approximately £500,000 (equivalent to £ in ). The overall cost was estimated to be over £3 million (equivalent to £ in ), making &quot;Ark Royal&quot; the most expensive non-battleship ordered by the Royal Navy. Construction began on Job No. 1012 when &quot;Ark Royal&quot;″s keel was laid down on 16 September 1935.
&quot;Ark Royal&quot; spent nearly two years in the builder&#x27;s yard before being launched on 13 April 1937 by Lady Maud Hoare, wife of Sir Samuel Hoare, then First Lord of the Admiralty. The bottle of champagne thrown against &quot;Ark Royal&quot;″s bows did not smash until the fourth attempt. The carrier spent a year fitting out, was handed over to her first commander, Captain Arthur Power, on 16 November 1938, and was commissioned on 16 December. Although intended for the Far East, events in Europe during the carrier&#x27;s construction, including the Italian invasion of Abyssinia in 1935 and the Spanish Civil War in 1936, caused the Admiralty to mark her for deployment with the Home and Mediterranean Fleets. After her crew joined at the end of 1938, &quot;Ark Royal&quot; underwent sea trials to prepare for service, during which the carrier proved capable of sailing above her theoretical speed, reaching over 31 knots (57.4 km/h; 35.6 mph) and in trials during May 1938 &quot;Ark Royal&quot; achieved with at a deep displacement of .

==Armament and aircraft==
&quot;Ark Royal&quot;″s armament was designed with anti-aircraft warfare in mind, as aircraft were expected to be the main threat; ships and submarines could be outrun or dealt with by escorts. Her main armament was sixteen quick-firing dual purpose guns in eight twin turrets, four on each side of the hull, controlled by four Directors using the High Angle Control System. The original design placed the turrets low on the hull, but was later altered to locate them just below the flight deck, which increased each turret&#x27;s field of fire. Six 8-barrelled 2-pounder () &quot;pom-pom&quot; guns were located on the flight deck, in front of and behind the superstructure island, while eight 4-barrelled machine guns were installed on small projecting platforms to the front and rear of the flight deck.

Sixteen Fleet Air Arm squadrons were posted aboard &quot;Ark Royal&quot; during her career; an average of five squadrons at any time. On entering service, most of &quot;Ark Royal&quot;″s squadrons were equipped with either Blackburn Skuas—used as fighters and dive bombers—or Fairey Swordfish, for reconnaissance and torpedo bombing. From April 1940, squadrons equipped with Skuas were upgraded to Fairey Fulmars; like their predecessors, these were used as fighters and bombers. On occasion, the carrier operated Blackburn Roc fighter-bombers (from April 1939 – October 1940) and Fairey Albacore torpedo bombers (during October 1941); these were replacement aircraft used to boost squadron numbers. In June 1940, &quot;Ark Royal&quot; was host to 701 Naval Air Squadron, a training squadron which operated Supermarine Walrus reconnaissance amphibians.

==Service history==

===With the hunter-killer groups===
The outbreak of the Second World War on 1 September 1939 had been presaged by Germany&#x27;s U-boat fleet taking up positions off the British coast, where they could intercept British shipping. Within hours of the war starting, the passenger ship was torpedoed by , the first of over 65,000 tons of shipping sunk by U-boats during the first week of the war. &quot;Ark Royal&quot; was deployed with the Home Fleet in the North Western Approaches as part of a &quot;hunter-killer&quot; group, consisting of a flotilla of destroyers and other anti-submarine vessels grouped around an aircraft carrier; either , or &quot;Ark Royal&quot;. Carrier-borne aircraft could increase the area searched for U-boats, but made the carriers tempting targets.

On 14 September, &quot;Ark Royal&quot; received a distress call from , which was away under pursuit from the surfaced &quot;U-30&quot;. &quot;Ark Royal&quot; launched aircraft to aid the merchant ship, but was spotted by , which launched two torpedoes. Lookouts spotted the torpedo tracks and &quot;Ark Royal&quot; turned towards the attack, reducing her cross-section and causing the torpedoes to miss and explode harmlessly astern. Three F-class destroyers escorting the carrier began to depth charge &quot;U-39&quot;, and forced her to the surface. The German crew abandoned ship before &quot;U-39&quot; sank—the first U-boat lost during the war. &quot;Ark Royal&quot;″s aircraft reached &quot;Fanad Head&quot;, which was in the hands of a German boarding party. The Skuas unsuccessfully attacked &quot;U-30&quot;: two crashed when caught by the blast of their own bombs. The U-boat escaped after rescuing the boarding party and the pilots of the downed aircraft (both observers had drowned), and torpedoing the &quot;Fanad Head&quot;.

&quot;Ark Royal&quot; returned to base in Loch Ewe, where she and her crew were inspected by Winston Churchill. The sinking of &quot;U-39&quot; was hailed as important to morale. However, the failed attack on &quot;Ark Royal&quot;, and the successful attack on &quot;Courageous&quot; on 17 September, convinced the Admiralty it was too dangerous to risk aircraft carriers in this way, and carrier-centred hunter-killer groups were abandoned.

===Another near miss===

On 25 September 1939, &quot;Ark Royal&quot; helped rescue the submarine , which had been damaged by German warships off Horn Reefs, in the Kattegat. While returning to port with &quot;Spearfish&quot; and the battleships and on 26 September, the ships were located by three &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; Dornier Do 18 seaplanes. &quot;Ark Royal&quot; launched three Blackburn Skuas to disperse them; one Dornier was shot down in an event propagandised as first British aerial kill of the war (later it was learned that the pilot of a Fairey Battle achieved the first kill).

The air commander aboard &quot;Ark Royal&quot;—aware that the surviving Dorniers would report the location of the British ships—ordered the aircraft to be secured and the anti-aircraft weapons readied. Four Junkers Ju 88 bombers of the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; bomber wing KG 30 soon appeared: three were driven away by anti-aircraft fire, but the fourth launched a bomb at the carrier. &quot;Ark Royal&quot; turned hard to starboard, heeling over and avoiding the bomb, which landed in the ocean off her starboard bow and sent a spout of water over the ship. The German pilots did not see if the carrier had been hit, and a reconnaissance flight later located the two battleships, but not &quot;Ark Royal&quot;. Based on this information, the Germans incorrectly claimed that &quot;Ark Royal&quot; had sunk. To prove the German propaganda false before it had a negative effect on Britain&#x27;s allies, Winston Churchill reassured United States President Franklin Delano Roosevelt that the carrier was undamaged and invited the US naval attaché to view &quot;Ark Royal&quot; in dock. The British naval attaché in Rome was instructed to assure Italian Prime Minister Benito Mussolini that the ship was still in service. This was an embarrassment for Goebbels and Nazi propaganda.

===Hunting the &quot;Graf Spee&quot;===
In October 1939, &quot;Ark Royal&quot; was redeployed to Freetown to operate off the African coast in the hunt for the German commerce raider . The carrier was assigned to Force K, and sailed with the battlecruiser to the South Atlantic. On 9 October, aircraft from &quot;Ark Royal&quot; spotted the , which supplied &quot;Graf Spee&quot;. The tanker was disguised as the US vessel &quot;Delmar&quot;, which fooled the British into passing her by. On 5 November, &quot;Ark Royal&quot; captured the German merchant , which was attempting to reach Germany. The ship was later taken into British service as a cargo ship and renamed &quot;Empire Ability&quot;. Several neutral merchant ships were also spotted by the carrier&#x27;s aircraft, twice causing crews to believe they were under attack and abandon ship. A note explaining the situation was dropped in a bag to a Norwegian vessel&#x27;s crew, and they re-boarded; an attempt to repeat this exercise with a Belgian crew failed when the bag was dropped down the ship&#x27;s funnel.

On 14 December 1939, &quot;Graf Spee&quot; had put into Montevideo to repair damage received during the battle of the River Plate. Two Royal Navy cruisers followed the raider, and patrolled the harbour entrance while reporting &quot;Graf Spee&quot;″s position to the fleet. &quot;Ark Royal&quot; and &quot;Renown&quot; were dispatched to join the British ships outside the harbour, but as they were 36 hours away, the British naval attaché came up with a plan to make the Germans believe that the two capital ships had already arrived. An order for fuel for &quot;Ark Royal&quot; was placed at Buenos Aires, west of Montevideo. This was leaked to the press, passed on to the German embassy in Montevideo, and given to &quot;Graf Spee&quot;″s captain, Hans Langsdorff. This contributed to Langsdorff&#x27;s decision to scuttle his ship.

===Return to the fleet===
With &quot;Graf Spee&quot; sunk, &quot;Ark Royal&quot; remained in the Atlantic for a short time before escorting the damaged heavy cruiser back to Devonport Dockyard, where they arrived in February. Following this, &quot;Ark Royal&quot; proceeded to Portsmouth to take on supplies and personnel, before sailing to Scapa Flow. On arrival, she transferred her Blackburn Skuas to Naval Air Station &quot;Hatston&quot; to strengthen the anchorage&#x27;s defences. &quot;Ark Royal&quot; was then assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet for exercises, departing Scapa Flow on 31 March 1940 and heading for Alexandria with the aircraft carrier . The carriers arrived in the Eastern Mediterranean on 8 April, but the exercises were cancelled a day later. The ships sailed to Gibraltar to await orders.

German forces had invaded Norway as part of Operation Weserübung on 9 April, and had secured sections of the coast. Attempts by the Royal Navy to operate in support of British troops were unsuccessful; air attacks had overwhelmed the ships, sinking and nearly sinking . Realising that the British ships required air cover, but aware that the Norwegian coast was outside the range of British land-based aircraft, the Admiralty recalled &quot;Ark Royal&quot; and &quot;Glorious&quot; from the Mediterranean on 16 April.

===Norwegian campaign===
&quot;Ark Royal&quot; and &quot;Glorious&quot; arrived at Scapa Flow on 23 April 1940 and were immediately redeployed as part of Operation DX, sailing to Norway with the cruisers and and screened by the destroyers , , , , and . This was the first time the Royal Navy had deployed carriers with the primary purpose of providing fighter protection for other warships. The ships took up position on 25 April off the coast; &quot;Ark Royal&quot; positioned offshore to reduce the chance of air attacks. The carrier&#x27;s aircraft conducted anti-submarine patrols, provided fighter support for other ships, and carried out strikes against shipping and shore targets. &quot;Ark Royal&quot; returned to Scapa Flow on 27 April to refuel and replace lost and damaged aircraft, before heading back on the same day with the battleship as escort. During the return, &quot;Ark Royal&quot; came under air attack from German Junkers Ju 88 and Heinkel He 111 bombers operating from Norway. The carrier was undamaged, and resumed position on 29 April.
By this point, the British high command had realised that they could not hold the Germans in southern Norway. The evacuation of Allied troops from Molde and Åndalsnes began, with &quot;Ark Royal&quot; providing air cover from 30 April. On 1 May, the Germans tried to sink the carrier, with numerous air attacks through the day. &quot;Ark Royal&quot;″s fighters and a heavy anti-aircraft barrage drove off the enemy, and although several bombs were dropped at the carrier, none hit. The evacuations of Molde and Andalsnes were completed on 3 May, and the carrier was recalled to Scapa Flow to refuel and rearm. While in port, Captain Arthur Power left the ship for a promotion to the Admiralty, and was replaced by Captain Cedric Holland. On return to Norway, &quot;Ark Royal&quot; was told to provide air cover for operations around Narvik, including the landing of French troops on 13 May. She was joined on 18 May by the carriers &quot;Glorious&quot; and &quot;Furious&quot;.

Despite these efforts, it was clear by the end of May that French forces were on the verge of collapse and Norway was a sideshow compared to the German advance to the English Channel. Operation Alphabet was instigated to move Allied troops from Narvik to Britain. &quot;Ark Royal&quot; and &quot;Glorious&quot;—screened by the destroyers , , , , and —sailed from Scapa Flow on 1 June to cover the evacuation, which commenced the next day. &quot;Ark Royal&quot; carried out air patrols and bombing raids from 3–6 June, before redeploying to Narvik on 7 June. The next day, &quot;Glorious&quot;, &quot;Acasta&quot; and &quot;Ardent&quot; were sunk by the German battleships and while heading back to Britain. &quot;Ark Royal&quot;″s aircraft failed to locate the German ships, which had returned to Trondheim.

The last evacuation convoy left Narvik on 9 June. Before the British ships could withdraw, a raid on Trondheim located &quot;Scharnhorst&quot;. An attack by &quot;Ark Royal&quot;″s Skuas took place at midnight on 13 June. The attack was a disaster: the escort destroyers and collided while &quot;Ark Royal&quot; was launching aircraft in fog and returned to England for repairs, eight of the fifteen attacking Skuas were shot down, while &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; escaped damage. &quot;Ark Royal&quot; returned to Scapa Flow the following day, and was reassigned to the Mediterranean Fleet.

===Mediterranean deployment===
&quot;Ark Royal&quot; left Scapa Flow with the battlecruiser and three destroyers, arriving at Gibraltar on 23 June 1940. Here she joined Force H, under Sir James Somerville. After the capitulation of France there was concern that a French fleet at Mers-el-Kébir might fall under Axis control and tip the balance of power in the Mediterranean. &quot;Ark Royal&quot;″s captain, Cedric Holland, had been the British naval attaché in Paris, and was sent to negotiate the surrender or scuttling of the French fleet. Force H was deployed outside the harbour, and when the French admirals refused to agree to the offered terms, opened fire on the French ships. During the attack on Mers-el-Kébir, &quot;Ark Royal&quot;″s aircraft provided targeting information for the British ships. The escaped, despite attacks by Swordfish from &quot;Ark Royal&quot;. Two days after the attack, aircraft from &quot;Ark Royal&quot; incapacitated the , which had been beached in the initial attack.
Having reduced the possibility of a French challenge in the Mediterranean, Force H prepared for attacks on Italian targets, and sailed from Gibraltar on 8 July. The force was attacked by Italian bombers within eight hours of departing, and although Force H escaped damage, Somerville cancelled the raids and ordered the fleet to Gibraltar. During July, the British colony of Malta came under attack from the Italian air force, with Force H ordered to deliver Hawker Hurricanes to reinforce the island&#x27;s air defences. Force H was deployed from 31 July – 4 August, with the carrier used to deliver the aircraft, while &quot;Ark Royal&quot; provided air cover for the fleet. On 2 August, &quot;Ark Royal&quot; launched a successful air attack against the Italian air base at Cagliari.

Force H remained at Gibraltar until 30 September, when it escorted reinforcements for Admiral Andrew Cunningham&#x27;s fleet to Alexandria. En route, diversionary attacks were planned on Italian air bases at Elmas and Cagliari to direct attention from both the reinforcement operation and a supply convoy sailing to Malta. The attacks were successfully carried out on 1 October, and the fleet reached Alexandria without significant attention from the Italian air force. From Alexandria, &quot;Ark Royal&quot; was detached and sent to West Africa to support British attempts to encourage Vichy French colonies to switch allegiance to the Free French. During negotiations, several Free French aircraft flew from &quot;Ark Royal&quot;, but their aircrews were arrested at Dakar. Negotiations failed, and bombers from &quot;Ark Royal&quot; were directed against military installations during the unsuccessful British attempt to take Dakar by force. &quot;Ark Royal&quot; then returned to Britain for refit, docking in Liverpool on 8 October after being escorted by , and . The refit—which lasted until 3 November—included repairs to her machinery and the installation of a new flight deck barrier.
Next, &quot;Ark Royal&quot;—accompanied by , &quot;Berwick&quot; and —sailed for Gibraltar, arriving on 6 November. They were deployed with the rest of Force H to escort convoys from Gibraltar to Alexandria and Malta, performing several runs before being assigned to Operation Collar, one of 35 convoys to support Malta between 1940 and 1942, on 25 November. An Italian fleet—led by the battleships and —was dispatched to intercept the convoy. The Italian fleet was detected by a reconnaissance aircraft from &quot;Ark Royal&quot; and the carrier launched Swordfish torpedo bombers while the capital ships of Force H turned to meet the enemy. During the engagement, the Battle of Cape Spartivento, the was damaged, although it is uncertain if torpedoes from the bombers or British gunfire were responsible. The British mistook &quot;Lanciere&quot; for a cruiser, while the Italian commanders received incorrect reports that the cruiser had been hit. British attacks failed to damage any other Italian ships or sink the disabled destroyer, and a retaliatory attack by the Italian air force saw &quot;Ark Royal&quot; as the subject of multiple bombing runs, none of which hit. The battle had no clear result, although the British convoy reached its destination unscathed.

On 14 December 1940, &quot;Ark Royal&quot; and Force H were redeployed from Gibraltar to the Atlantic to search the Azores for commerce raiders. &quot;Ark Royal&quot; returned to the Mediterranean on 20 December, and escorted the battleship and merchant ships from Malta until 27 December. Force H then became involved in Operation Excess, a plan to move convoys through the Mediterranean to support the Western Desert Force, which was trying to push Italian land forces from Egypt into Libya. Over the next month, British control of the Mediterranean theatre was weakened, particularly by the entry of the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; and the near-loss of the aircraft carrier . The Mediterranean Fleet was under pressure from Axis forces in the Eastern Mediterranean, while the British port at Gibraltar was likely to be lost if the Spanish chose to ally with the Germans instead of remaining neutral. To relieve the Mediterranean Fleet, while demonstrating British strength to the Spanish, the Admiralty and Admiral Cunningham planned to use &quot;Ark Royal&quot;″s Swordfish bombers in raids against Italian targets, supported by bombardment from heavy fleet units. The first bombing, on 2 January against the Tirso Dam in Sardinia, was unsuccessful but &quot;Ark Royal&quot;″s Swordfish bombers were more successful on 6 January, when they bombed the port city of Genoa. The carrier&#x27;s aircraft also covered the battlecruiser &quot;Renown&quot; and battleship &quot;Malaya&quot; while they shelled the port in Operation Grog. On 9 January, &quot;Ark Royal&quot; launched aircraft to bomb an oil refinery at La Spezia, and to lay mines in the harbour. Both operations were successful.

===Searching for &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; and &quot;Gneisenau&quot;===
In early February 1941, the battleships &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; and &quot;Gneisenau&quot; headed into the Atlantic during Operation Berlin on the orders of Grand Admiral Erich Raeder, commander of the German Navy. They were to disrupt Allied shipping and draw capital ships from other areas. On 8 March, Force H and &quot;Ark Royal&quot; were ordered to the Canary Islands to search for the battleships, and to cover convoys crossing from the United States. &quot;Ark Royal&quot; used her aircraft to search for captured ships returning to Germany under the control of prize crews. Three ships were located on 19 March: two scuttled themselves, while the third—SS &quot;Polykarp&quot;— reached France.

On the evening of 21 March 1941 a Fairey Fulmar from &quot;Ark Royal&quot; stumbled across &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; and &quot;Gneisenau&quot; at sea. Because of a radio malfunction, the crew had to return to &quot;Ark Royal&quot; to report, by which time the German ships had escaped under fog. The next day, &quot;Ark Royal&quot; re-established air patrols in the hope of re-locating the raiders. During the day, a catapult malfunction destroyed a Fairey Swordfish; flinging the fuselage into the sea ahead of the carrier. Unable to stop, &quot;Ark Royal&quot; ran over the Swordfish and was overhead when the aircraft&#x27;s depth charges detonated. &quot;Scharnhorst&quot; and &quot;Gneisenau&quot; reached Brest without British harassment, while &quot;Ark Royal&quot; returned to Gibraltar for repairs, arriving on 24 March.

===Malta convoys and Operation Tiger===

&quot;Ark Royal&quot; spent April alternating between covering convoys and delivering aircraft to Malta and forays into the Atlantic to hunt commerce raiders. By May 1941, Erwin Rommel&#x27;s &quot;Afrika Korps&quot; were driving through North Africa towards the Suez Canal, pushing the Western Desert Force before them. With British forces close to collapse and strategic locations threatened, the British High Command risked sending a reinforcement convoy across the Mediterranean to Alexandria. The convoy consisted of five large transport ships, escorted by &quot;Ark Royal&quot;, the battlecruiser &quot;Renown&quot;, the battleship , the cruisers , , , and , and screened by destroyers of the 5th Destroyer Flotilla. Prior to &quot;Ark Royal&quot;″s departure, Captain Holland left to recuperate from stress and poor health, and was replaced by Captain Loben Maund. The convoy left Gibraltar on 6 May, and was detected by Italian aircraft. The convoy—limited to and escorted by so many capital ships—was such a tempting target that Italian and German aircraft were mobilised.
The British convoy came under air attack on 8 May, first by the Italian air force, then the German &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;. Over the day, 12 of &quot;Ark Royal&quot;″s Fairey Fulmars (the maximum number available) drove off over 50 aircraft, with the assistance of targeting information from &quot;Sheffield&quot;″s radar and anti-aircraft fire from the escorts. During the initial waves, one Fulmar was lost, killing Flight Lieutenant Rupert Tillard and Lieutenant Mark Somerville; another was destroyed with the aircrew recovered, while several others were damaged. Consequently, only seven were able to face the main &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; force of 34 aircraft, while an attack just before dark was driven off by two aircraft and heavy fire from the ships. The convoy survived without serious damage: the only casualties were to mines, with the &quot;Empire Song&quot; sunk and &quot;New Zealand Star&quot; damaged but able to reach port. &quot;Ark Royal&quot; underwent another aerial attack on 12 May, during her return to Gibraltar. Later that month, she and fellow aircraft carrier &quot;Furious&quot; delivered Hawker Hurricanes to support Malta.

===Hunting the &quot;Bismarck&quot;===

On 18 May 1941, the German battleship and heavy cruiser began Operation Rheinübung by breaking into the Atlantic to raid shipping. After sinking the battlecruiser &quot;Hood&quot; and damaging the battleship during the Battle of the Denmark Strait, &quot;Bismarck&quot; shook off her pursuers and headed for the French Atlantic coast. &quot;Ark Royal&quot;, &quot;Renown&quot;, and &quot;Sheffield&quot;—accompanied by destroyers , &quot;Foresight&quot;, &quot;Forester&quot;, &quot;Fortune&quot;, , and &quot;Fury&quot;—were dispatched to the Atlantic on 23 May to search for the battleship. On 26 May, a Swordfish from &quot;Ark Royal&quot; located &quot;Bismarck&quot; and began to shadow her, while the Home Fleet was mobilised to pursue.
At the time of detection, the British ships were away and would not catch &quot;Bismarck&quot; before she reached Saint-Nazaire, putting her safely under the air cover of the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; once in range and while being repaired at the Normandie drydock. Fifteen Swordfish bombers were armed with torpedoes and sent to delay the ship. &quot;Sheffield&quot;, also shadowing &quot;Bismarck&quot;, was between &quot;Ark Royal&quot; and &quot;Bismarck&quot;. The aircraft mistook the British cruiser for their target and fired torpedoes. The torpedoes were fitted with unreliable magnetic detonators, which caused most to explode on contact with the water, while &quot;Sheffield&quot; evaded the rest. After realising his mistake, one of the pilots signalled &#x27;Sorry for the kipper&#x27; to &quot;Sheffield&quot;.

On return to the carrier, the Swordfish were re-armed with contact-detonator warhead torpedoes, and launched at 19:15 for a second attack; locating and attacking &quot;Bismarck&quot; just before sunset. Three torpedoes hit the battleship: two detonated forward of the engine rooms, while the third struck the starboard steering compartment and jammed her rudder in a 15° port turn. &quot;Bismarck&quot; was forced to sail in circles until a combination of alternating propeller speeds was found which would keep her on a reasonably steady course which, in the prevailing force 8 wind and sea state, forced her to sail towards the British warships with almost no manoeuvring capability. The German battleship was harassed by British destroyers during the night of 26–27 May and suffered heavy attack the next morning, finally sinking at 10:39 hours on 27 May.

===Escorting the Malta convoys===
&quot;Ark Royal&quot; and the ships of Force H returned to Gibraltar on 29 May 1941. Despite the boost in Allied morale from the sinking of the battleship &quot;Bismarck&quot;, the war in the Mediterranean was going against the Allies. Greece and Crete had fallen to the Axis Powers, and the &quot;Afrika Korps&quot; was preparing to launch a final push into Egypt. Malta remained an important stronghold in the Mediterranean, but was coming under increased pressure from Italian and German air attacks, and could no longer be supplied from the east since the Battle of Crete.

&quot;Ark Royal&quot; was pressed into service, delivering aircraft to Malta during several supply runs throughout June and July, and escorting the convoys of Operation Substance in July and Operation Halberd in September. Despite some losses, the convoys succeeded in keeping Malta supplied and fighting. The continued Allied presence in Malta was a considerable problem for Rommel in Africa, who was losing as much as ⅓ of his supplies from Italy to submarines and bombers based there. Adolf Hitler decided to send a flotilla of U-boats into the Mediterranean to attack Allied shipping, against the advice of &quot;Großadmiral&quot; Raeder.

==Final voyage and sinking==
On 10 November 1941, &quot;Ark Royal&quot; ferried more aircraft to Malta before returning to Gibraltar. Admiral Somerville had been warned of U-boats off the Spanish coast, and reminded Force H to be vigilant. Also at sea was Friedrich Guggenberger&#x27;s , which had received a report that Force H was returning to Gibraltar.

On 13 November, at 15:40, the sonar operator aboard the destroyer detected an unidentified sound, but assumed it was the propellers of a nearby destroyer. One minute later, &quot;Ark Royal&quot; was struck amidships by a torpedo, between the fuel bunkers and bomb store, and directly below the bridge island. The explosion caused &quot;Ark Royal&quot; to shake, hurled loaded torpedo-bombers into the air, and killed 44 year old Able Seaman Edward Mitchell, the only man to die in the sinking. The torpedo punched a hole in the ship&#x27;s bottom and starboard side below the water-line after running deep and hitting the bilge keel, inboard of the side protection system. The hit caused flooding of the starboard boiler room, main switchboard, oil tanks, and over of the ship&#x27;s starboard bilge. The explosion knocked out all internal communications and the starboard power train, causing the rear half of the ship to lose power.
Immediately after the torpedo strike, Captain Maund ordered the engines to full stop, but with the communications knocked out had to send a runner to the engine room. The ship&#x27;s continued motion enlarged the hole in the hull, and by the time &quot;Ark Royal&quot; stopped she had taken on a great deal of water and begun to list to starboard, reaching 18° from centre within 20 minutes. Considering the list of &quot;Ark Royal&quot;, and the fact that other carriers, including &quot;Courageous&quot; and &quot;Glorious&quot;, had sunk rapidly with heavy loss of life, Maund gave the order to abandon ship. The crew were assembled on the flight deck to determine who would remain on board to try to save the ship while &quot;Legion&quot; came alongside to take off the rest. As a result, comprehensive damage control measures were not initiated until 49 minutes after the attack. The flooding spread unchecked, exacerbated by covers and hatches left open during evacuation of the lower decks.

Water spread to the centreline boiler room, which started to flood from below, and power was lost shipwide when the boiler uptakes became choked; &quot;Ark Royal&quot; had no backup diesel generators. About half an hour after the explosion, the carrier appeared to stabilise. Admiral Somerville, determined to save &quot;Ark Royal&quot;, ordered damage control parties back to the carrier before taking the battleship &quot;Malaya&quot; to Gibraltar to organise salvage efforts. The damage control parties re-lit a boiler, restoring power to the bilge pumps. The destroyer came alongside to provide power and additional pumps, while Swordfish aircraft from Gibraltar flew overhead to supplement anti-submarine patrols. The tug arrived from Gibraltar at 20:00 and attached a tow line to &quot;Ark Royal&quot;, but the flooding had caused the ship to list more severely. Rising water reached the boiler room fan flat, an uninterrupted compartment running the width of the ship. This forced the shutdown of the restored boiler.
The list reached 20° between 02:05 and 02:30, and when &#x27;abandon ship&#x27; was declared again at 04:00, had reached 27°. &quot;Ark Royal&quot;″s complement had been evacuated to &quot;Legion&quot; by 04:30; with the exception of Mitchell, there were no fatalities. The 1,487 officers and crew were transported to Gibraltar. The list reached 45° before &quot;Ark Royal&quot; capsized and sank at 06:19 on 14 November. Witnesses reported the carrier rolling to 90°, where she remained for three minutes before inverting. &quot;Ark Royal&quot; then broke in two, the aft sinking within a couple of minutes, followed by the bow.

===Investigation===
A Board of Inquiry was established to investigate the loss. Based on its findings, Captain Loben Maund was court-martialled in February 1942. He was found guilty on two counts of negligence: one of failing to ensure that properly constituted damage control parties had remained on board after the general evacuation, and one of failing to ensure the ship was in a sufficient state of readiness to deal with possible damage. The board tempered their judgement with an acknowledgement that a high standard was being expected of Maund, and that he was primarily concerned with the welfare of his crew.

The Bucknill Committee, which had been set up to investigate the loss of major warships, also produced a report. This report said that the lack of backup power sources was a major design failure, which contributed to the loss: &quot;Ark Royal&quot; depended on electricity for much of her operation, and once the boilers and steam-driven dynamos were knocked out, the loss of power made damage control difficult. The committee recommended the design of the bulkheads and boiler intakes be improved to decrease the risk of widespread flooding in boiler rooms and machine spaces, while the uninterrupted boiler room flat was criticised. The design flaws were rectified in the - and s, under construction at the time.

The Board of Inquiry closed its report with the observation that &quot;Ark Royal&quot; had sunk east of Europa Point, the southernmost tip of Gibraltar. This was accepted as the wreck location for 60 years.

==Rediscovery==
The location of the wreck was undetermined until mid-December 2002, when the wreck was discovered by an underwater survey company, C &amp; C Technologies, Inc, using a sonar-equipped autonomous underwater vehicle, from Gibraltar, at about depth. The company had been contracted by the BBC as part of a documentary on maritime archaeology related to major battles of the Royal Navy. The &quot;Ark Royal&quot; wreck lies in two main pieces with the stern section sitting upright and the bow section upside down. of the bow is separated from the rest of the ship&#x27;s hull. A large debris field, which includes the funnel and bridge island, parts of the ship that came loose as the carrier sank, and aircraft from the hangars, lies between the two hull sections. Analysis revealed that the port side of the ship hit the seabed first.

The wreck was found further east than expected. Researchers originally thought the wreck had been carried by currents farther into the Mediterranean as she sank—that the ship had travelled eastwards underwater before reaching the seabed. The presence near the hull pieces of other debris, including a Swordfish bomber that was tipped off the flight deck before the ship rolled, proved this false. If the current had pushed the hull pieces any significant distance sideways as they sank, debris would have been spread over a much wider area. It seems though that eastward currents had affected her progress towards Gibraltar during the time she was under tow.

Study of the wreck also showed that restarting the engines to provide power increased the stresses placed on the hull, adding to the flooding. Once power was then lost, it was impossible to prevent the ship from sinking—her fate was more the result of design flaws than of the actions of her captain.

<text>Need for achievement is a person&#x27;s desire for significant accomplishment, mastery of skills, control, or high standards. The psychometric device designed to measure need-for-achievement, N-Ach, was popularized by the psychologist David McClelland. A need for achievement figures as a secondary or psychogenic need in Henry Murray&#x27;s system of needs.

==Theory==
The pioneering research work of the Harvard Psychological Clinic in the 1930s, summarized in &quot;Explorations in Personality&quot;, provided the starting point for future studies of personality, especially those relating to needs and motives. David McClelland and his collaborators John William Atkinson, Russell A. Clark and Edgar L. Lowell later investigated achievement motivation.

== N-Ach measure ==
Using results based on the Thematic Apperception Test, McClelland concluded in a 1958 study that individuals in a society can be grouped into high achievers and low achievers based on their scores on what he called &quot;N-Ach&quot;. McClelland also found that high-need-for-achievers will accept risk only to the degree they believe their personal contributions will make a difference in the outcome.

N-Ach is characterized by an enduring and consistent concern with setting and meeting high standards of achievement. This concern is influenced by an internal drive for action (intrinsic motivation), and by the pressure exerted by the expectations of others (extrinsic motivation). Measured with the thematic apperception test (TAT), need for achievement motivates an individual to succeed in competition, and to excel in activities important to them.

N-Ach is related to the difficulty of tasks people choose to undertake. Those with low N-Ach may choose very easy tasks, in order to minimize risk of failure, or highly difficult tasks, such that a failure would not be embarrassing. Those with high N-Ach tend to choose moderately difficult tasks, feeling that they are challenging, but within reach.

McClelland’s research led him to formulate psychological characteristics of people with strong need for achievement. According to McClelland and David Winter (&quot;Motivating Economic Achievement&quot;), the following features accompany high level of achievement motivation:

* Moderate risk propensity; 
* Undertaking innovative and engaging tasks; 
* Internal locus of control and responsibility for own decisions and behaviors; 
* Need for precise goal setting.
A 1982 study conducted by McClellan and coauthors found that high need for achievement (N-Ach) was linked to success in lower-level management roles, in which promotions were influenced by individual contributions. At higher management levels where promotions were based on demonstrated leadership ability, high N-Ach was not associated with success.

<text>Charles Wade Barkley (born February 20, 1963) is an American former professional basketball player who is a television analyst on TNT and CBS Sports. Nicknamed &quot;Sir Charles&quot;, &quot;the Bread Truck&quot;, and &quot;the Round Mound of Rebound&quot;, Barkley played 16 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA). Though shorter than the typical power forward, he used his strength and aggression to become one of the NBA&#x27;s best rebounders and scorers. Barkley was an 11-time NBA All-Star, 11-time member of the All-NBA Team, and the 1993 NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP). He was named to the NBA&#x27;s 50th and 75th anniversary teams.

An All-American at Auburn University, Barkley was drafted as a junior by the Philadelphia 76ers with the fifth pick of the 1984 NBA draft. In his rookie season, Barkley was named to the All-Rookie First Team in 1985. In the 1986–87 season, Barkley led the league in rebounding average and earned his first rebounding title. He was named the All-Star Game MVP in 1991, and in 1993 with the Phoenix Suns, he was voted the league&#x27;s MVP while leading the team to the NBA Finals. He also competed in the 1992 and 1996 Olympic Games, winning two gold medals as a member of the U.S. national team. In 2000, Barkley retired as the fourth player in NBA history to achieve 20,000 points, 10,000 rebounds, and 4,000 assists. Barkley is a two-time inductee into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, inducted in 2006 for his individual career and in 2010 as a member of the 1992 Olympic &quot;Dream Team&quot;.

Barkley was popular with the fans and media and made the NBA&#x27;s All-Interview Team for his last 13 seasons in the league. He was frequently involved in on- and off-court fights and sometimes stirred national controversy, such as in March 1991 when he spat on a young girl while attempting to spit at a heckler, and 1993 when he declared that sports figures should not be considered role models. Since retiring as a player, Barkley has had a successful career as an NBA analyst. He works for TNT on &quot;Inside the NBA&quot; alongside Shaquille O&#x27;Neal, Kenny Smith, and Ernie Johnson as a studio pundit for its coverage of NBA games (for which he has won five Sports Emmy Awards). In addition, Barkley has written several books and has shown an interest in politics.

==Early life==
Barkley was born and raised in Leeds, Alabama, east of Birmingham. He was the first black baby born at a segregated, all-white town hospital and was in the first group of black students at his elementary school. His parents divorced when he was young after his father abandoned the family, which included younger brother Darryl Barkley. His mother remarried and they had a son, John Glenn. Another brother, Rennie, died in infancy. His stepfather was killed in an accident when Charles was 11 years old.

Barkley attended Leeds High School. As a junior, he stood and weighed . He failed to make the varsity team and was named as a reserve. However, during the summer Barkley grew to and earned a starting position on the varsity as a senior. He averaged 19.1 points and 17.9 rebounds per game and led his team to a 26–3 record en route to the state semi-finals. Despite his improvement, Barkley garnered no attention from college scouts until the state high school semi-finals, where he scored 26 points against Alabama&#x27;s most highly recruited player, Bobby Lee Hurt. An assistant to Auburn University&#x27;s head coach, Sonny Smith, was at the game and reported seeing, &quot;a fat guy... who can play like the wind&quot;. Barkley was soon recruited by Smith and majored in business management while attending Auburn University.

==College career==
Barkley played collegiate basketball for the Auburn Tigers for three seasons. Although he struggled to control his weight, he excelled as a player and led the SEC in rebounding each year. He became a popular crowd-pleaser, exciting the fans with dunks and blocked shots that belied his lack of height and overweight frame. It was not uncommon to see the hefty Barkley grab a defensive rebound and, instead of passing, dribble the entire length of the court and finish at the opposite end with a two-handed dunk. His physical size and skills ultimately earned him the nickname &quot;The Round Mound of Rebound&quot; and the &quot;Crisco Kid&quot;.

During his college career, Barkley played the center position, despite being shorter than the average center. His height, officially listed as , is stated as in his book, &quot;I May Be Wrong but I Doubt It&quot;. He became a member of Auburn&#x27;s All-Century team and still holds the Auburn record for career field goal percentage with 62.6%. He received numerous awards, including Southeastern Conference (SEC) Player of the Year (1984), three All-SEC selections and one Second Team All-American selection. Later, Barkley was named the SEC Player of the Decade for the 1980s by the &quot;Birmingham Post-Herald&quot;.

In Barkley&#x27;s three-year college career, he averaged 14.1 points on 62.6% field goal shooting, 9.6 rebounds, 1.6 assists, and 1.7 blocks per game. In 1984, he led the Tigers to their first NCAA tournament in school history and finished with 23 points on 80% field goal shooting, 17 rebounds, four assists, two steals, and two blocks. Auburn retired Barkley&#x27;s No. 34 jersey on March 3, 2001.

He was one of 74 college players invited to the spring tryouts for the 1984 U.S. Olympic team coached by Bob Knight. Barkley made the initial cut in April to the final 20, but was one of four released in May (with John Stockton, Terry Porter, and Maurice Martin) in the penultimate cut to 16 players.

In 2010, Barkley admitted that he asked for, and had been given, money from sports agents during his career at Auburn. Barkley called the sums he had requested from agents &quot;chump change&quot;, and went on to say, &quot;Why can&#x27;t an agent lend me some money and I&#x27;ll pay him back when I graduate?&quot; According to Barkley, he paid back all of the money he had borrowed after signing his first NBA contract.

==Professional career==
===Philadelphia 76ers (1984–1992)===
Barkley left before his final year at Auburn and made himself eligible for the 1984 NBA draft. He was selected with the fifth pick in the first round by the Philadelphia 76ers, two slots after the Chicago Bulls drafted Michael Jordan. He joined a veteran team that included Julius Erving, Moses Malone, and Maurice Cheeks, players who had taken Philadelphia to the 1983 NBA championship. Under the tutelage of Malone, Barkley was able to manage his weight and learned to prepare and condition himself properly for a game; Barkley cited Malone as the most influential player of his career, and he often referred to him as &quot;Dad&quot;. He averaged 14.0 points and 8.6 rebounds per game during the regular season and earned a berth on the All-Rookie Team. In the postseason, the Sixers advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals but were defeated in five games by the Boston Celtics. As a rookie in the postseason, Barkley averaged 14.9 points and 11.1 rebounds per game.

During his second year, Barkley improved his game under the leadership of Moses Malone during the off-season with his workouts, in the process he became the team&#x27;s leading rebounder and number two scorer, averaging 20.0 points and 12.8 rebounds per game. He became the Sixers&#x27; starting power forward and helped lead his team into the playoffs, averaging 25.0 points on .578 shooting from the field and 15.8 rebounds per game. Despite his efforts, Philadelphia was defeated 4–3 by the Milwaukee Bucks in the Eastern Conference Semifinals. He was named to the All-NBA Second Team.
Before the 1986–87 season, Moses Malone was traded to the Washington Bullets and Barkley began to assume control as the team leader. On November 4, 1986, Barkley recorded 34 points, 10 rebounds, and a career-high 14 assists in a 125–121 loss to the Indiana Pacers. On March 20, 1987, Barkley recorded 26 points, 25 rebounds (including a career-high-tying 16 offensive rebounds), and nine assists in a 116–106 win over the Denver Nuggets. He earned his first and only rebounding title, averaging 14.6 rebounds per game, and also led the league in offensive rebounds with 5.7 per game. He averaged 23.0 points on .594 shooting, earning his first trip to an NBA All-Star game and All-NBA Second Team honors for the second straight season. In the playoffs, Barkley averaged 24.6 points and 12.6 rebounds in a losing effort, for the second straight year, to the Bucks in a five-game first-round playoff series.

The following season, Julius Erving announced his retirement and Barkley became the Sixers&#x27; franchise player. On November 30, 1988, Barkley recorded 41 points, 22 rebounds, five assists, and six steals in a 114–106 win over the Blazers. Playing in 80 games and getting 300 more minutes than his nearest teammate, Barkley had his most productive season, averaging 28.3 points on .587 shooting and 11.9 rebounds per game. He appeared in his second All-Star Game and was named to the All-NBA First Team for the first time in his career. His celebrity status as the Sixers&#x27; franchise player led to his first appearance on the cover of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;. For the first time since the 1974–75 season, however, the 76ers failed to make the playoffs. In the 1988–89 season, Barkley continued to play well, averaging 25.8 points on .579 shooting and 12.5 rebounds per game. He earned his third straight All-Star Game appearance and was named to the All-NBA First team for the second straight season. Despite Barkley contributing 27.0 points on .644 shooting, 11.7 rebounds, and 5.3 assists per game, the 76ers were swept in the first round of the playoffs by the New York Knicks.

During the 1989–90 season, despite receiving more first-place votes, Barkley finished second in MVP voting behind the Los Angeles Lakers&#x27; Magic Johnson. He was named Player of the Year by &quot;The Sporting News&quot; and &quot;Basketball Weekly&quot;. He averaged 25.2 points and 11.5 rebounds per game and a career-high .600 shooting. He was named to the All-NBA First Team for the third consecutive year and earned his fourth All-Star selection. He helped Philadelphia win 53 regular-season games, only to lose to the Chicago Bulls in a five-game Eastern Conference Semi-finals series. Barkley averaged 24.7 points and 15.5 rebounds in another postseason loss. His exceptional play continued into his seventh season, where he averaged 27.6 points on .570 shooting and 10.1 rebounds per game. His fifth straight All-Star Game appearance proved to be his best yet. He led the East to a 116–114 win over the West with 17 points and 22 rebounds, the most rebounds in an All-Star Game since Wilt Chamberlain recorded 22 in 1967. Barkley was presented with Most Valuable Player honors at the All-Star Game and, at the end of the season, named to the All-NBA First Team for the fourth straight year. That year, when the &quot;New York Times&quot; asked the San Antonio Spurs center David Robinson if he would choose Barkley or Jordan for his side in a hypothetical pickup game, Robinson said, &quot;I would pick Barkley. When he is on his game, I think he has the biggest impact ever.&quot; In the playoffs, Philadelphia lost again to Jordan&#x27;s Chicago Bulls in the Eastern Conference Semi-finals, with Barkley contributing 24.9 points and 10.5 rebounds per game.

The 1991–92 season was Barkley&#x27;s final year in Philadelphia. In his last season, he wore number 32 instead of his 34 to honor Magic Johnson, who had announced prior to the start of the season that he was HIV-positive. Although the 76ers had initially retired the number 32 in honor of Billy Cunningham, it was unretired, with Cunningham&#x27;s approval, for Barkley to wear. Following Johnson&#x27;s announcement, Barkley also apologized for having made light of his condition. Responding to concerns that players may contract HIV by contact with Johnson, Barkley stated, &quot;We&#x27;re just playing basketball. It&#x27;s not like we&#x27;re going out to have unprotected sex with Magic.&quot;

In his final season with the Sixers, averaging 23.1 points on .552 shooting and 11.1 rebounds per game, Barkley earned his sixth straight All-Star appearance and was named to the All-NBA Second Team, his seventh straight appearance on either the first or second team. He ended his 76ers career ranked fourth in team history in total points (14,184), third in scoring average (23.3 ppg), third in rebounds (7,079), eighth in assists (2,276) and second in field-goal percentage (.576). He led Philadelphia in rebounding and field-goal percentage for seven consecutive seasons and in scoring for six straight years. However, Barkley was said to have demanded a trade out of Philadelphia after the Sixers failed to make the postseason with a 35–47 record. This was later refuted by Charles Barkley himself, who said that he had not demanded a trade, but was not happy and wanted out. Rather than wait until his contract ran out and lose their superstar for nothing, the 76ers traded him. Barkley was initially traded to the Los Angeles Lakers before the end of the season, but the 76ers wound up retracting their deal a few hours later. On July 17, 1992, he was officially traded to the Phoenix Suns in exchange for Jeff Hornacek, Tim Perry and Andrew Lang.

During Barkley&#x27;s eight seasons in Philadelphia, he became a household name and was one of the few NBA players to have an action figure produced by Kenner&#x27;s Starting Lineup toy line. He also had his own signature shoe line with Nike. His outspoken and aggressive play, however, resulted in some on-court incidents, notoriously a fight with Detroit Pistons center Bill Laimbeer in 1990, which drew a record total $162,500 fine.

====Spitting incident====
On March 26, 1991, during a game versus the New Jersey Nets, Barkley attempted to spit on a fan who was allegedly heckling him with racial slurs, but the result was that his spit hit a young girl. Rod Thorn, the NBA&#x27;s president of operations at the time, suspended Barkley, without pay, for one game and fined him $10,000 for spitting and for verbally abusing the fan. It became a national story, and Barkley was vilified for it. Barkley, however, eventually developed a friendship with the girl and her family. He apologized and, among other things, provided them with tickets to future games.

Upon retirement, Barkley was later quoted as stating, in regard to his career, &quot;I was fairly controversial, I guess, but I regret only one thing– the spitting incident. But you know what? It taught me a valuable lesson. It taught me that I was getting way too intense during the game. It let me know I wanted to win way too bad. I had to calm down. I wanted to win at all costs. Instead of playing the game the right way and respecting the game, I only thought about winning.&quot;

===Phoenix Suns (1992–1996)===
The trade to Phoenix in the 1992–93 season went well for both Barkley and the Suns. In his first game with the Suns, Barkley almost recorded a triple-double, racking up 37 points, 21 rebounds (12 of them offensive), and 8 assists in a 111–105 victory over the Los Angeles Clippers. He averaged 25.6 points on .520 shooting, 12.2 rebounds and a career-high 5.1 assists per game, leading the Suns to an NBA-best 62–20 record. For his efforts, Barkley won the league&#x27;s Most Valuable Player Award, and was selected to play in his seventh straight All-Star Game. He became the third player ever to win league MVP honors in the season immediately after being traded, established multiple career highs and led Phoenix to their first NBA Finals appearance since 1976. Despite Barkley&#x27;s proclamation to Jordan that it was &quot;destiny&quot; for the Suns to win the title, they were defeated in six games by the Chicago Bulls. He averaged 26.6 points and 13.6 rebounds per game during the whole postseason, including 27.3 points, 13.0 rebounds and 5.5 assists per game in the championship series. In the fourth game of the Finals, Barkley recorded a triple-double, collecting 32 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists.

As a result of severe back pains, Barkley began to speculate that the 1993–94 season would be his last in Phoenix. Playing through the worst injury problems of his career, Barkley managed 21.6 points on .495 shooting and 11.2 rebounds per game. He was selected to his eighth consecutive All-Star Game, but did not play because of a torn right quadriceps tendon, and was named to the All-NBA Second Team. With Barkley fighting injuries, the Suns still managed a 56–26 record and made it to the Western Conference Semifinals. Despite holding a 2–0 lead in the series, the Suns lost in seven games to the eventual champions, the Houston Rockets, who were led by Hakeem Olajuwon. Despite his injuries, in Game 3 of a first-round playoff series against the Golden State Warriors, Barkley hit 23 of 31 field-goal attempts and finished with 56 points, the then-third-highest total ever in a playoff game. After contemplating retirement in the off-season, Barkley returned for his eleventh season and continued to battle injuries. He struggled during the first half of the season, but gradually managed to improve, earning his ninth consecutive appearance in the All-Star Game. He averaged 23 points on .486 shooting and 11.1 rebounds per game, while leading the Suns to a 59–23 record. In the playoffs, despite having a 3–1 lead in the series, the Suns once again lost to the defending and eventual two-time champion Houston Rockets in seven games. Barkley averaged 25.7 points on .500 shooting and 13.4 rebounds per game in the postseason, but was limited in Game 7 of the semi-finals by a leg injury.

The 1995–96 season was Barkley&#x27;s last with the Phoenix Suns. He led the team in scoring, rebounds and steals, averaging 23.3 points on .500 shooting, 11.6 rebounds and a career high .777 free throw shooting. He earned his tenth appearance in an All-Star Game as the top vote-getter among Western Conference players and posted his 18th career triple-double on November 22. He also became just the tenth player in NBA history to reach 20,000 points and 10,000 rebounds in their career. In the postseason, Barkley averaged 25.5 points and 13.5 rebounds per game in a four-game first round playoff loss to the San Antonio Spurs. After the Suns closed out the season with a 41–41 record and a first-round playoff loss, Barkley was traded to Houston in exchange for Sam Cassell, Robert Horry, Mark Bryant, and Chucky Brown.

During his career with the Suns, Barkley excelled, earning All-NBA and All-Star honors in each of his four seasons.

====Role model controversy====
Throughout his career, Barkley argued that athletes should not be considered role models. He stated, &quot;A million guys can dunk a basketball in jail; should they be role models?&quot; In 1993, his argument prompted national news when he wrote the text for his &quot;I am not a role model&quot; Nike commercial. Dan Quayle, the former Vice President of the United States, called it a &quot;family-values message&quot; for Barkley&#x27;s oft-ignored call for parents and teachers to quit looking to him to &quot;raise your kids&quot; and instead be role models themselves.

Barkley&#x27;s message sparked a great public debate about the nature of role models. He argued: I think the media demands that athletes be role models because there&#x27;s some jealousy involved. It&#x27;s as if they say, this is a young black kid playing a game for a living and making all this money, so we&#x27;re going to make it tough on him. And what they&#x27;re really doing is telling kids to look up to someone they can&#x27;t become, because not many people can be like we are. Kids can&#x27;t be like Michael Jordan.

===Houston Rockets (1996–2000)===
The trade to the Houston Rockets in the 1996–97 season was Barkley&#x27;s last chance at capturing an NBA championship title. He joined a veteran team that included two of the NBA&#x27;s 50 Greatest Players, Hakeem Olajuwon and Clyde Drexler. To begin the season, Barkley was suspended for the season opener and fined $5,000 for fighting Charles Oakley during an October 25, 1996 preseason game. After Oakley committed a flagrant foul on Barkley, Barkley responded by shoving Oakley. In his first game with the Houston Rockets, Barkley had a career-high 33 rebounds. He continued to battle injuries throughout the season and played only 53 games, missing 14 because of a laceration and bruise on his left pelvis, 11 because of a sprained right ankle, and four due to suspensions. He became the team&#x27;s second-leading scorer, averaging 19.2 points on .484 shooting; the first time since his rookie year that he averaged below 20 points per game. With Olajuwon taking most of the shots, Barkley focused primarily on rebounding, averaging 13.5 per game, the second-best in his career. The Rockets ended the regular season with a 57–25 record and advanced to the Western Conference Finals, where they were defeated in six games by the Utah Jazz. Barkley averaged 17.9 points and 12.0 rebounds per game in another postseason loss.

The 1997–98 season was another injury-plagued year for Barkley. He averaged 15.2 points on .485 shooting and 11.7 rebounds per game. The Rockets ended the season with a 41–41 record and were eliminated in five games by the Utah Jazz in the first round of the playoffs. Limited by injuries, Barkley played four games in the series and averaged career lows of 9.0 points and 5.3 rebounds in 21.8 minutes per game. During the lockout-shortened season, Barkley played 42 regular-season games and managed 16.1 points on .478 shooting and 12.3 rebounds per game. He became the second player in NBA history, following Wilt Chamberlain, to accumulate 23,000 points, 12,000 rebounds and 4,000 assists in his career. The Rockets concluded the shortened season with a 31–19 record and advanced to the playoffs. In his last postseason appearance, Barkley averaged 23.5 points on .529 shooting and 13.8 rebounds per game in a first-round playoff loss to the Los Angeles Lakers. He concluded his postseason career averaging 23 points on .513 shooting, 12.9 rebounds and 3.9 assists per game in 123 games.

The 1999–2000 season was Barkley&#x27;s final year in the NBA. Initially, Barkley averaged 14.5 points on .477 shooting and 10.5 rebounds per game. Along with Shaquille O&#x27;Neal, Barkley was ejected from a November 10, 1999 game against the Los Angeles Lakers. After O&#x27;Neal blocked a layup by Barkley, O&#x27;Neal shoved Barkley, who then threw the ball at O&#x27;Neal. Barkley&#x27;s season and career seemingly ended prematurely at the age of 36 after rupturing his left quadriceps tendon on December 8, 1999, in Philadelphia, where his career began. Refusing to allow his injury to be the last image of his career, Barkley returned after four months for one final game. On April 19, 2000, in a home game against the Vancouver Grizzlies, Barkley scored a memorable basket on an offensive rebound and putback, a common trademark during his career. He accomplished what he set out to do after being activated from the injured list, and walked off the court to a standing ovation. He stated, &quot;I can&#x27;t explain what tonight meant. I did it for me. I&#x27;ve won and lost a lot of games, but the last memory I had was being carried off the court. I couldn&#x27;t get over the mental block of being carried off the court. It was important psychologically to walk off the court on my own.&quot; After the basket, Barkley immediately retired and concluded his sixteen-year Hall of Fame career.

==Olympics==
Barkley was invited by Bob Knight to try out for United States men&#x27;s basketball team for the 1984 Summer Olympics. He made it all the way to final cuts, but was not selected for the team, despite outplaying almost all of the front-court players there. According to Knight, Barkley was cut because of poor defense.

Barkley competed in the 1992 and 1996 Olympic Games and won two gold medals as a member of the United States men&#x27;s basketball team. International rules that previously prevented NBA players from playing in the Olympics were changed in 1992, allowing Barkley and fellow NBA players to compete in the Olympics for the first time. The team was nicknamed the &quot;Dream Team&quot; and went 6–0 in the Olympic qualifying tournament and 8–0 against Olympic opponents. The team averaged an Olympic record 117.3 points a game and won games by an average of 43.8 points, only surpassed by the 1956 U.S. Olympic team. Barkley led the team with 18.0 points on 71.1% field goal shooting and set a then-Olympic single-game scoring record with 30 points in a 127–83 victory over Brazil. He also set a U.S. Men&#x27;s Olympic record for highest three-point field goal percentage with 87.5% and added 4.1 rebounds and 2.6 steals per game. During the game versus Angola, Barkley elbowed Herlander Coimbra in the chest and was unapologetic after the game, claiming he was hit first. Barkley was called for an intentional foul on the play. Coimbra&#x27;s resulting free throw was the only point scored by Angola during a 46–1 run by the U.S.

At the 1996 Atlanta Summer Olympic Games, Barkley led the team in scoring, rebounds, and field goal percentage. He averaged 12.4 points on 81.6% field goal shooting, setting a U.S. Men&#x27;s Olympic record. In addition, he also contributed 6.6 rebounds per game. Under Barkley&#x27;s leadership, the team once again compiled a perfect 8–0 record and captured gold medal.

==Player profile==
Barkley played the power forward position, but occasionally played small forward and center. He was known for his unusual build as a basketball player, stockier than most small forwards, yet shorter than most power forwards he faced. However, Barkley was still capable of outplaying both taller and quicker opponents because of his unusual combination of strength and agility.

Barkley was a prolific scorer who averaged 22.1 points per game during the regular season for his career and 23.0 points per game in the playoffs for his career. Barkley was an incredibly efficient offensive force, leading the NBA in 2-point field goal percentage every season from the 1986–87 season to the 1990–91 season. He led the league in effective field goal percentage in both the 1986–87 and 1987–88 seasons as well, and also led the league in offensive rating in both the 1988–89 and 1989–90 seasons. He was one of the NBA&#x27;s most versatile players and accurate scorers capable of scoring from anywhere on the court and established himself as one of the NBA&#x27;s premier clutch players. During his NBA career, Barkley was a constant mismatch because he possessed a very uncommon combination of skills and could play in a variety of positions. He would use all facets of his game in a single play; as a scorer, he had the ability to score from the perimeter and the post, using an array of spin moves and fadeaways, or finishing a fast break with a powerful dunk. He was one of the most efficient scorers of all time, scoring at 54.13% total field goal percentage for his season career and 51.34% total field goal shooting for his playoff career (including a career-high season average of 60% during the 1989–90 NBA season).

Barkley is the shortest player in NBA history to lead the league in rebounding when he averaged a career-high 14.6 rebounds per game during the 1986–87 season. His tenacious and aggressive form of play built into an undersized frame that fluctuated between and helped cement his legacy as one of the greatest rebounders in NBA history, averaging 11.7 rebounds per game in the regular season for his career and 12.9 rebounds per game in his playoff career and totaling 12,546 rebounds for his season career. Barkley topped the NBA in offensive rebounding for three straight years and was most famous among very few power forwards who could control a defensive rebound, dribble the length of the court and finish at the rim with a powerful dunk.

Barkley also possessed considerable defensive talents led by an aggressive demeanor, foot speed and his capacity to read the floor to anticipate for steals, a reason why he established his career as the second All-Time leader in steals for the power forward position and leader of the highest all-time steal per game average for the power forward position. Despite being undersized for both the small forward and power forward positions, he also finished among the all-time leaders in blocked shots. His speed and leaping ability made him one of the few power forwards capable of running down court to block a faster player with a chase-down block.

In a &quot;SLAM&quot; magazine issue ranking NBA greats, Barkley was ranked among the top 20 players of All-Time. In the magazine, NBA Hall-of-Famer Bill Walton commented on Barkley&#x27;s ability. Walton stated, &quot;Barkley is like Magic [Johnson] and Larry [Bird] in that they don&#x27;t really play a position. He plays everything; he plays basketball. There is nobody who does what Barkley does. He&#x27;s a dominant rebounder, a dominant defensive player, a three-point shooter, a dribbler, a playmaker.&quot;

==Legacy==

During his 16-year NBA career, Barkley was regarded as one of the most controversial, outspoken and dominating players in the history of basketball. His impact on the sport went beyond his rebounding titles, assists, scoring and physical play. His confrontational mannerisms often led to technical fouls and fines on the court, and his larger than life persona sometimes gave rise to national controversy off of it, such as when he was featured in ads that rejected pro athletes as role models and declared, &quot;I am not a role model.&quot; Although his words often led to controversy, according to Barkley his mouth was never the cause because it always spoke the truth. He stated, &quot;I don&#x27;t create controversies. They&#x27;re there long before I open my mouth. I just bring them to your attention.&quot;

Besides his on-court fights with other players, he has exhibited confrontational behavior off-court. He was arrested for breaking a man&#x27;s nose during a fight after a game with the Milwaukee Bucks and also for throwing a man through a plate-glass window in Orlando, after being struck with a glass of ice. Barkley continues to be popular with the fans and media.

As a player, Barkley was a perennial All-Star who earned league MVP honors in 1993. He employed a physical style of play that earned him the nicknames &quot;Sir Charles&quot; and &quot;The Round Mound of Rebound&quot;. He was named to the All-NBA team eleven times and earned two gold medals as a member of the United States Olympic Basketball team. He led both teams in scoring and was instrumental in helping the 1992 &quot;Dream Team&quot; and 1996 Men&#x27;s Basketball team compile a perfect 16–0 record. He retired as one of only four players in NBA history to record at least 20,000 points, 10,000 rebounds and 4,000 assists in their career. As of 2023, he has the 12th highest PER in NBA history and is 14th in win shares.

In 1996, Barkley, as part of the NBA&#x27;s 50th Anniversary, was honored as one of the 50 greatest players of all time by being named to the NBA&#x27;s 50th Anniversary Team. In recognition of his collegiate and NBA achievements, Barkley&#x27;s number 34 jersey was officially retired by Auburn University on March 3, 2001. In the same month, the Philadelphia 76ers also officially retired Barkley&#x27;s number 34 jersey. On March 20, 2004, the Phoenix Suns honored Barkley as well by including him in the &quot;Suns Ring of Honor&quot;. In recognition of his achievements as a player, Barkley was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2006. In October 2021, as part of the NBA&#x27;s 75th Anniversary, Barkley was honored as one of the 75 greatest players of all time by being named to the NBA&#x27;s 75th Anniversary Team. To commemorate the NBA&#x27;s 75th Anniversary &quot;The Athletic&quot; ranked their top 75 players of all time, and named Barkley as the 22nd greatest player in NBA history.

==Television==

=== Sports analyst ===

Since 2000, Barkley has served as a studio analyst for Turner Network Television (TNT). He appears on the network&#x27;s NBA coverage during pre-game and halftime shows, in addition to special NBA events. He also occasionally works as an onsite game analyst. He is part of the crew on &quot;Inside the NBA&quot;, a post-game show during which Barkley, Ernie Johnson Jr., Kenny Smith and Shaquille O&#x27;Neal recap and comment on NBA games that have occurred during the day and also on general NBA affairs. Barkley has won five Sports Emmy Awards for &quot;Outstanding Studio Analyst&quot; for his work on TNT.

During the broadcast of a game, in which Barkley was courtside with Marv Albert, Barkley poked fun at NBA official Dick Bavetta&#x27;s age. Albert replied to Barkley, &quot;I believe Dick would beat you in a footrace.&quot; In response to that remark, Barkley went on to challenge Bavetta to a race at the 2007 NBA All-Star Weekend for $5,000. The winner was to choose a charity to which the money would be donated. The NBA agreed to pitch in an additional $50,000, and TNT threw in $25,000. The pair raced for three and a half lengths of the basketball court until Barkley ultimately won. After the event, the two kissed in a show of good sportsmanship.

Barkley was also known for being the first-ever celebrity guest picker for College GameDay, in 2004.

Since 2011, Barkley has served as a studio analyst for the joint coverage of the NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament between Turner Sports and CBS. Barkley has broadcast every Final Four since 2011.

He also served as a guest commentator for NBC&#x27;s coverage of the NFL Wild Card playoffs on January 7, 2012; the same night he hosted &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, which is taped next door to the &quot;Football Night in America&quot; studio in Manhattan&#x27;s GE Building.

Barkley announced in November 2012 that he was contemplating retirement from broadcasting. &quot;[N]ow I&#x27;m like, &#x27;Dude, you have been doing this for 13 years and if I make it to the end of the contract, it will be 17 years.&#x27; Seventeen years is a long time. It&#x27;s a lifetime in broadcasting. I personally have to figure out the next challenge for me&quot;, he said. After repeating that he planned to retire in 2016, he signed another contract with Turner Sports. He later stated that he wanted to retire when he turned 60 in 2023.

In October 2022, Barkley signed a 10-year contract extension with Warner Bros. Discovery Sports, owner of TNT, to remain as an analyst on &quot;Inside the NBA&quot;.

In June 2024, Barkley also was a guest of Game 2 of the 2024 Stanley Cup Finals as a Studio analyst broadcast by ABC, and produced by ESPN.

In June 2024, Barkley announced his intention to retire from television following the conclusion of the 2024–25 NBA season. He later reversed this decision in August, deciding to stay with TNT Sports on his ten-year, $210 million contract.

=== Other television work ===
From 2002 to 2003, Barkley hosted a sports and general topics talk show with guests on TNT called &quot;Listen Up! Charles Barkley with Ernie Johnson&quot;. In July 2016, it was announced that Barkley would host a six-episode unscripted show called &quot;The Race Card&quot;. The show was renamed to &quot;American Race&quot;, and premiered on TNT on May 11, 2017.

In the fall of 2023, Barkley would begin co-hosting a news discussion program called &quot;King Charles&quot; alongside Gayle King on CNN. It was a limited-run series that aired on Wednesdays at 10pm. &quot;King Charles&quot; ended in April the following year.

==Personal life==
A DNA test read by George Lopez on &quot;Lopez Tonight&quot; revealed Barkley to be of 14% Native American, 11% European, and 75% African descent.

===Marriage and family===
Barkley and Maureen Blumhardt reportedly first met in the mid to late 1980s when Barkley was playing for the Philadelphia 76ers. They got married in 1989. Barkley and Maureen reside in Scottsdale, Arizona. His wife is an honorary member of the Phoenix-based organization, Fresh Start Women&#x27;s Foundation.

Their daughter, named Christiana, was born in 1989. Barkley said she was named after a mall called Christiana Mall in Delaware. She is married and has two children.

===Gambling===
Barkley is known for his compulsive gambling. In a 2007 interview with ESPN&#x27;s Trey Wingo, Barkley revealed that he had lost approximately $10 million through gambling. In addition, he also admitted to losing $2.5 million &quot;in a six-hour period&quot; while playing blackjack. Although Barkley openly admits to his problem, he claims it is not serious since he can afford to support the habit. When approached by fellow TNT broadcaster Ernie Johnson about the issue, Barkley replied, &quot;It&#x27;s not a problem. If you&#x27;re a drug addict or an alcoholic, those are problems. I gamble for too much money. As long as I can continue to do it I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a problem. Do I think it&#x27;s a bad habit? Yes, I think it&#x27;s a bad habit. Am I going to continue to do it? Yes, I&#x27;m going to continue to do it.&quot;

Despite suffering big losses, Barkley also claims to have won on several occasions. During a trip to Las Vegas, he claims to have won $700,000 from playing blackjack and betting on the Indianapolis Colts to defeat the Chicago Bears in Super Bowl XLI. He went on to state, however, &quot;No matter how much I win, it ain&#x27;t a lot. It&#x27;s only a lot when I lose. And you always lose. I think it&#x27;s fun, I think it&#x27;s exciting. I&#x27;m gonna continue to do it, but I have to get to a point where I don&#x27;t try to break the casino &#x27;cause you never can.&quot;

In May 2008, the Wynn Las Vegas casino filed a civil complaint against Barkley, alleging that he failed to pay a $400,000 debt stemming from October 2007. Barkley responded by taking blame for letting time lapse on the repayment of the debt and promptly paid the casino. After repaying his debt, Barkley stated during a pregame show on TNT, &quot;I&#x27;ve got to stop gambling... I am not going to gamble anymore. For right now, the next year or two, I&#x27;m not going to gamble... Just because I can afford to lose money doesn&#x27;t mean I should do it.&quot;

===Golf===
Barkley began playing golf during his NBA career, later staying with the sport as it was a way to remain in competition after his basketball career ended. He is a regular competitor at the American Century Championship pro-am tournament, regularly finishing near the bottom of the leaderboard. He is widely regarded as a poor golfer with a particularly bad swing; he later underwent training to improve his swing, which led to an improved performance in the 2021 American Century Championship.

Barkley participated in &quot;Champions for Change&quot;, the third iteration of &quot;The Match&quot;. As part of a team with Phil Mickelson, Barkley pulled off a major upset defeating Peyton Manning and Stephen Curry by a score of 4–3.

===Politics===

Barkley spoke for many years of his Republican Party affiliation. In 1995, he considered running as a Republican candidate for Alabama&#x27;s governorship in the 1998 election. However, in 2006, he altered his political stance, stating &quot;I was a Republican until they lost their minds.&quot; At a July 2006 meeting of the Southern Regional Conference of the National School Boards Association in Destin, Florida, Barkley lent credence to the idea of running for Governor of Alabama, stating: I&#x27;m serious. I&#x27;ve got to get people to realize that the government is full of it. Republicans and Democrats want to argue over stuff that&#x27;s not important, like gay marriage or the war in Iraq or illegal immigration... When I run—if I run—we&#x27;re going to talk about real issues like improving our schools, cleaning up our neighborhoods of drugs and crime and making Alabama a better place for all people.

In September 2006, Barkley once again reiterated his desire to run for governor. He noted, &quot;I can&#x27;t run until 2014 ... I have to live there for seven years, so I&#x27;m looking for a house there as we speak.&quot; In July 2007, he made a video declaring his support for Barack Obama in the 2008 presidential election. In September 2007, during a broadcast on Monday Night Football, Barkley announced that he bought a house in Alabama to satisfy residency requirements for a 2014 campaign for governor. In addition, Barkley declared himself an Independent and not a Democrat as previously reported. &quot;The Republicans are full of it&quot;, Barkley said, &quot;The Democrats are a little less full of it.&quot;

In February 2008, Barkley announced that he would be running for Governor of Alabama in 2014 as an Independent. On October 27, 2008, he officially announced his candidacy for Governor of Alabama in an interview with CNN, stating that he planned to run in the 2014 election cycle, but he began to back off the idea in a November 24, 2009 interview on &quot;The Jay Leno Show&quot;. In 2010, he confirmed that he was not running in 2014. In August 2015, Barkley announced his support for Republican John Kasich in the 2016 presidential election. On Lance Armstrong&#x27;s podcast in 2019, he confirmed that he would not be running for office.

Barkley supports LGBT rights. In 2006, he told Fox Sports: &quot;I&#x27;m a big advocate of gay marriage. If they want to get married, God bless them.&quot; Speaking to Wolf Blitzer on CNN two years later, he said: &quot;Every time I hear the word &#x27;conservative,&#x27; it makes me sick to my stomach, because they&#x27;re really just fake Christians, as I call them. That&#x27;s all they are. ... I think they want to be judge and jury. Like, I&#x27;m for gay marriage. It&#x27;s none of my business if gay people want to get married. I&#x27;m pro-choice. And I think these Christians, first of all, they&#x27;re not supposed to judge other people. But they&#x27;re the most hypocritical judge of people we have in the country. And it bugs the hell out of me. They act like they&#x27;re Christians. They&#x27;re not forgiving at all.&quot; During a 2011 Martin Luther King Jr. Day double-header on TNT, Barkley responded to a statement made by Dr. King&#x27;s daughter Bernice, by saying, &quot;People try to make it about black and white. [But] he talked about equality for every man, every woman. We have a thing going on now, people discriminating against homosexuality in this country. I love the homosexuality people. God bless the gay people. They are great people.&quot; Barkley has stated on several occasions that he has played with multiple gay players. In 2013, in response to Celtics player Jason Collins coming out, Barkley stated, “I think anybody who thinks they never played with a gay player is an idiot.&quot; In 2022, a video surfaced of Barkley speaking at an event where he made comments vehemently in favor of the LGBT community: &quot;I want to say this. If you&#x27;re gay and transgender, I love you. And if anybody gives you sh-t, you tell them Charles said &#x27;f--k you.&#x27;&quot; He spoke out against the 2023 Bud Light boycott in the United States, mainly by conservatives who oppose the brand&#x27;s endorsements by transgender actress Dylan Mulvaney; he said that he would buy Bud Light for the crowd at a celebrity golf tournament in Lake Tahoe, and condemned the boycotters as &quot;rednecks&quot;.

Commenting on the Ferguson unrest, Barkley called the Ferguson looters &quot;scumbags&quot;, praised the police officers who work in black neighborhoods, and said that he supports the decision made by the grand jury not to indict officer Darren Wilson in the Michael Brown shooting. Previously, in 2013, Barkley expressed his agreement with the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the Trayvon Martin shooting.

In 2014, when Barkley was asked about the rumor that Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson was being accused for not being &quot;black enough&quot; on the radio show &quot;Afternoons&quot; with Anthony and Rob Ellis, he said:

Unfortunately, as I tell my white friends, we as black people, we&#x27;re never going to be successful, not because of you white people, but because of other black people. When you&#x27;re black, you have to deal with so much crap in your life from other black people. It&#x27;s a dirty, dark secret; I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s coming out. One of the reasons we&#x27;re never going to be successful as a whole, because of other black people. And for some reason we are brainwashed to think, if you&#x27;re not a thug or an idiot, you&#x27;re not black enough. If you go to school, make good grades, speak intelligent, and don&#x27;t break the law, you&#x27;re not a good black person. And it&#x27;s a dirty, dark secret. There are a lot of black people who are unintelligent, who don&#x27;t have success. It&#x27;s best to knock a successful black person down because they&#x27;re intelligent, they speak well, they do well in school, and they&#x27;re successful... We&#x27;re the only ethnic group who say, &#x27;Hey, if you go to jail, it gives you street cred.&#x27; It&#x27;s just typical BS that goes on when you&#x27;re black, man.

Barkley has also been known as a critic of President Donald Trump from as early as his Republican nomination in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Before Trump won the Republican primaries that year, Barkley stated his disgust towards the words and messages that Trump was promoting throughout the presidential race. In September 2017, when President Trump called out former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick for his kneeling during the U.S. National Anthem during the 2016 NFL season, Barkley expressed his complete disappointment in President Trump (however, Barkley has stated that he does not support athletes kneeling during the National Anthem as a form of protest). In December 2017, Barkley mocked President Trump&#x27;s tax bill, stating &quot;Thank you Republicans, I knew I could always count on y&#x27;all to take care of us rich people, us one percenters. Sorry, poor people. I&#x27;m hoping for y&#x27;all, but y&#x27;all ain&#x27;t got no chance.&quot;

In his response to the controversy generated by the removal of Confederate monuments as highlighted by the August 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, Barkley stated:


Barkley supported Democrat Doug Jones in the 2017 United States Senate special election in Alabama. During Alabama&#x27;s Senate election, Barkley noted that Jones&#x27; competitor, Roy Moore, was a complete embarrassment to the state.

While Barkley supports police and prison reforms, he spoke out against defunding the police in 2020, saying &quot;Who are black people supposed to call? The Ghostbusters?&quot;. After the killing of Breonna Taylor, Barkley said that &quot;I feel sad that this young lady lost her life.&quot;, but added that &quot;we do have to take into account that her boyfriend shot at the cops and shot a cop.&quot;, making her situation not &quot;like George Floyd or Ahmaud Arbery&quot;.

Also in 2020, Barkley expressed concern that sports were becoming too political, saying that &quot;My concern is turning this into a circus instead of trying to do some good stuff.&quot; and that &quot;The last thing they want to do is turn on the television and hear arguments all the time.&quot;

During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Barkley said that &quot;You&#x27;d have to be a fool to think your kids will be safe in school right now&quot;, but argued that keeping children at home would widen the gap between the rich and the poor. He also expressed optimism about the NBA&#x27;s planned restart to the 2019-2020 season in the NBA bubble, but worried about some players testing positive for COVID-19.

In an interview with Brandon &#x27;Scoop B&#x27; Robinson on the Scoop B Radio podcast, Barkley said if he ruled the world for one day, he would get rid of both Republicans and Democrats because &quot;They&#x27;re both awful&quot;, adding: &quot;They fight all of the time like little kids.&quot;

===Books===
In 1991, Barkley and sportswriter Roy S. Johnson collaborated on the autobiographical work &quot;Outrageous&quot;. Editorial choices made by Johnson in the book led to Barkley famously quipping that he had been misquoted in his own autobiography. In 2000, Barkley wrote the foreword for &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; columnist Rick Reilly&#x27;s book &quot;The Life of Reilly&quot;. In it, Barkley quipped, &quot;Of all the people in sports I&#x27;d like to throw through a plate glass window, Reilly&#x27;s not one of them. It&#x27;s a shame though, skinny white boys look &quot;real&quot; aerodynamic.&quot; In 2002, Barkley released the book &quot;I May Be Wrong, But I Doubt It&quot;, which included editing and commentary by close friend Michael Wilbon. Three years later, Barkley released &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of a Large Black Man?&quot;, which is a collection of interviews with leading figures in entertainment, business, sports, and government. Michael Wilbon also contributed to this book and was present at many of the interviews.

===Acting===
He played himself in the 1996 film &quot;Space Jam&quot;. He made a brief appearance in the TV series &quot;Suits&quot;, in episode 3 of the fifth season. He was seen taking pictures with a client that was stolen from Jack Soloff, by the great Harvey Specter. Charles also appeared in the eighth season of &quot;Modern Family&quot;. He also voices animated versions of himself in &quot;&quot; and &quot;We Bare Bears&quot;. In 2019, he appeared in &quot;The Piña Colada Song&quot; episode of &quot;The Goldbergs&quot; as a gym teacher and alien conspiracy theorist briefly trained as a prospective replacement for the departing Coach Mellor. Barkley hosted &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; on four separate occasions between 1993 and 2018.

===DUI conviction===
On December 31, 2008, Barkley was pulled over in Scottsdale, Arizona for running a stop sign. The officer smelled alcohol on Barkley&#x27;s breath and proceeded to administer field sobriety tests, which he failed. He was arrested on drunk driving charges and had his vehicle impounded. Barkley refused to submit a breath test and was given a blood test. He was then cited and released. Gilbert police noted Barkley was cooperative and respectful during the entire incident, adding that he was treated no differently than anyone arrested on DUI charges. The police report of the incident stated that Barkley told the police he was in a hurry to receive oral sex from his female passenger when he ran through a stop sign early Wednesday. Test results released by the police showed that Barkley had a blood-alcohol level at .149, nearly twice the legal limit of .08 in Arizona. Two months after his arrest, Barkley pleaded guilty to two DUI-related counts and one count of running a red light. He was sentenced to ten days in jail and fined $2,000. The sentence was later reduced to three days after Barkley entered an alcohol treatment program.

As part of the fallout of his arrest, Barkley took a two-month from his commentating duties for TNT. During his absence, T-Mobile elected not to air previously scheduled ads that featured Barkley. On February 19, 2009, Barkley returned to TNT and spent the first segment of the NBA pregame show discussing the incident and his experiences. Shortly after his return, T-Mobile once again began airing ads featuring Barkley.

===WeightWatchers===
In 2011, Barkley became a spokesman for WeightWatchers, promoting their &quot;Lose Like a Man&quot; program and appearing in both television and online ads.

<text>Count Theodosius (; died 376), Flavius Theodosius or Theodosius the Elder (), was a senior military officer serving Valentinian I () and the Western Roman Empire during Late Antiquity. Under his command the Roman army defeated numerous threats, incursions, and usurpations. Theodosius was patriarch of the imperial Theodosian dynasty () and father of the emperor Theodosius the Great ().

Appointed &quot;comes rei militaris per Britannias&quot; (commander of mobile military forces for the Diocese of the Britains) by Valentinian, Theodosius put down the Great Conspiracy (367–368) and the usurpation of Valentinus. After restoring order in Britain he returned to continental Europe and fought against the Alemanni; as Valentinian&#x27;s &quot;magister equitum&quot; (Master of Horse) he successfully invaded Alemannic territory (371 or 370). In 372 Theodosius led a successful campaign against the Sarmatians. Within the same year Firmus, a Mauritanian prince, rebelled against Roman rule with the help of African tribes like the Abanni and Caprarienses. Theodosius was sent to Africa and in two hard-fought campaigns (373–374) put down the insurrection. In 376, after the death of emperor Valentinian, he was arrested and executed, presumably as he was seen as a threat to the new western emperors Gratian and Valentinian II.

Theodosius&#x27;s title in Latin was &quot;comes rei militaris&quot; (&quot;viz.&quot; &quot;companion [&quot;of the emperor&quot;] for military affairs&quot;; the word &quot;comes&quot; is the origin of the medieval European feudal title of count and its homologues.

==Military career==
Theodosius is first mentioned in historical records by Ammianus Marcellinus with reference to his appointment to the command to restore order in Britain. According to Hughes,
It is clear that prior to his appointment to such an important military enterprise Theodosius must have been well known to Valentinian and that his military ability was respected, but unfortunately how he had earned such respect is unknown.

Other scholars agree with the supposition that Theodosius won the trust of Valentinian I in his earlier career.

===The Great Conspiracy===

In 368, Theodosius was raised to the high Roman military rank of &quot;comes rei militaris&quot; and sent to northern Gaul and Britannia to recover the lands lost to the Great Barbarian Conspiracy in the previous year. Theodosius was given command of part of Valentinian&#x27;s &quot;comitatensis&quot; (the Imperial Field Army) and early in the year he marched on Bononia (Boulogne-sur-Mer), Rome&#x27;s harbour on the Channel. Taking advantage of a break in the weather, Theodosius crossed the Channel, leaving the bulk of his troops in Bononia to await clearer weather. He landed at Rutupiae (Richborough), and started gathering intelligence on the situation in Britain; he found out that the troops in Britain had either refused to fight against an enemy superior in numbers, or had been on furlough when the invasion began. Furthermore, he found out that the enemy had broken up their forces into small raiding parties which were plundering at will. When his army finally crossed the Channel with the onset of favorable spring weather, Theodosius had made his plans and was ready to move. The Roman army marched on Londinium (London) and re-established Imperial control of Britain&#x27;s largest city. Using Londinium as his base of operations, Theodosius divided his army into detachments and sent them to attack bands of marauders within reach of the city. The Romans quickly killed or captured many of the small enemy raiding parties, relieving them of their booty, supplies and prisoners. Theodosius also sent messengers offering pardon to deserters and ordering them to make their way to Londinium.

Over the winter of 368–369, large numbers of troops drifted back into their units, bringing vital intelligence that would help Theodosius plan the next phase of his campaign. In 369 Theodosius campaigned all through Roman Britain, restoring its &#x27;chief towns&#x27; and hunting down enemy war parties and traitors. Ammianus Marcellinus records that he put down a rebellion by the Pannonian Valentinus. At the end of the campaigning season he sent a message to Valentinian to inform him that the provinces of Britain had been restored to the Empire. He also informed the emperor that he had created a new province which he had named Valentia (probably for Valentinian).

Known to have been with him on this expedition were his son Theodosius, and the future emperor Magnus Maximus, possibly a relative.

===Magister Equitum Praesentalis===
On his return from Britain Theodosius succeeded Jovinus as the &quot;magister equitum praesentalis&quot; at the court of the Emperor Valentinian I, in which capacity he prosecuted another successful campaign (370/371) against the Alemanni. In 372 Theodosius was deployed to Illyricum and led an army against the Sarmatians; he appears to have secured a victory in battle and successfully brought the campaign to an end.

In the same year, Firmus, a Mauretanian prince, rebelled against Roman rule and plunged the Diocese of Africa into disarray. Valentinian decided to give Theodosius the command of the expedition to suppress the rebellion. Theodosius&#x27; son was made &quot;dux&quot; of the province of Moesia Prima, replacing his father as commander in Illyricum, while Theodosius himself started mustering his troops at Arles. In the spring of 373 Theodosius sailed to Africa and led a successful campaign against the rebels in the east of Mauritania. At the end of the campaigning season, when he led his army into western Mauritania, he suffered a major setback. In 374 Theodosius invaded western Mauritania again. This time he was more successful, defeating the rebels and capturing Firmus.

In 375, when the Emperor Valentinian suddenly died, Theodosius was still in Africa. Orders arrived for Theodosius to be arrested; he was taken to Carthage, and put to death in early 376. The reasons for this are not clear, but it is thought to have resulted from a factional power struggle in Italy after the sudden death of Emperor Valentinian in November 375. Shortly before his death, which he accepted calmly, Theodosius received Christian baptism — delaying the rite until the end of one&#x27;s life was common practice at the time, even for lifelong Christians.

==Legacy==

At the fall of his father, the younger Theodosius retired to his estates in the Iberian Peninsula, where he married Aelia Flaccilla in 376. According to Ambrose, those who had killed the elder Theodosius had also plotted against the safety of his son during his retirement. The younger Theodosius had returned to the Danube frontier by 378 when he was appointed &quot;magister equitum&quot;. Following his successes in the field he was elevated at Sirmium (Sremska Mitrovica) to the rank of &quot;augustus&quot; by the emperor Gratian () on 19 January 379.

After the accession of his son, Theodosius the Elder was deified and given the &quot;consecratio&quot; in , and statues of him were set up.

Theodosius I joined himself with the ruling Valentinianic dynasty () by wedding Galla, daughter of Valentinian the Great and his second wife Justina, and sister of Theodosius&#x27;s co-&quot;augustus&quot; Gratian. He went on to establish an imperial dynasty of his own, making Count Theodosius the progenitor and patriarch of a line of Roman emperors and empresses.

<text>Anthony van Hoboken ( , ; 23 March 1887 – 1 November 1983) was a Dutch musical collector, bibliographer, and musicologist. He became especially well known for his scholarship on the music of Joseph Haydn and in particular for being the creator of the Hoboken catalogue, the standard scholarly catalogue of Haydn&#x27;s works.

==Life==
===1887–1919===
Hoboken was born in Rotterdam to a family that was successful in business, banking, and shipping. He was personally very well off and throughout life his choices were generally made without regard to the need to earn a living. He trained as an engineer (1906–1909) at the Technical College of Delft. Switching to music, he enrolled in 1909 in the Hoch Conservatory in Frankfurt, where he studied harmony with Bernhard Sekles and composition with Iwan Knorr. In 1917 he moved to Munich, where he built his own villa in 1919 and lived in bohemian and intellectual circles.

===His collection of musical documents===
Hoboken&#x27;s wealth enabled him to collect early editions and manuscripts of music from Bach to Brahms. This collection, begun in 1919 under the guidance of the composer Otto Vrieslander, eventually amounted to over 5,000 items, including over 1000 by Haydn. Among the Haydn items were the string quartets Op. 17, 20, 64, and 77; the piano sonata H XVI:49; and seven of the twelve &quot;London&quot; symphonies. Much later (1971), the collection was purchased by the Austrian state and now resides in the Austrian National Library in Vienna.

===Marriage and studies with Schenker===
In 1922 Hoboken married Annemarie Seidel (1895–1959), an actress whom he had rescued from ill health resulting from living in the dank basement apartment of her former lover. With Hoboken&#x27;s wealth the couple led a pleasant lifestyle. Hoboken&#x27;s friend and teacher Heinrich Schenker later reported a social evening with Hoboken in his Vienna apartment:
At 9 o&#x27;clock, to Hoboken (we stay there until 3:45!) ... The Tautenhayn ensemble plays! Not until 11 o&#x27;clock does Hoboken tell me that his wife is lying in the hospital, however the matter is not serious. The evening passed extremely well; the complete naturalness in the social gathering, and in our relationship to the musicians; the rooms; the beautiful, sumptuous meal and its presentation (for which we offered the chef a toast, with applause): these made an exceptional impression on us all.
The friendship with Schenker had begun around 1924 (their families vacationed together), and in 1925 Hoboken moved his family to Vienna so he could begin formal study with Schenker. He attended lessons twice a week beginning that year and extending through 1932.

Hoboken&#x27;s wealth permitted him to provide subventions facilitating the publication of a number of Schenker&#x27;s works. He was also able to afford 
his own librarian to maintain his collection of first editions and autographs. For this post he chose Otto Erich Deutsch, another friend of Schenker, who achieved musicological eminence in his own right. Deutsch worked for Hoboken from 1926 to 1935.

===The Meister-Archiv project===
In 1927 Schenker and Hoboken undertook a project on behalf of the Austrian National Library to create an archive containing photographic copies of the musical manuscripts of the great composers (&quot;Archiv für Photogramme musikalischer Meisterhandschriften&quot;; &quot;Archive for Photographic Images of Musical Master Manuscripts&quot;). Their appeal to other libraries for participation emphasized two points. First, contemporary editions of the music were rife with interpolated material not in the original (&quot;see Urtext edition&quot;) and the availability of photographic copies would facilitate the preparation of more accurate editions. Second, they noted that historical manuscripts are vulnerable to destruction or loss. The latter point was prescient, as the Second World War, which broke out twelve years later, resulted in extensive damage and theft in the scholarly archives of Europe; a number of documents survive today solely as a result of the Meister-Archiv project.

===1932–1983===
In 1932 Hoboken divorced his first wife Seidel (with whom there had been no children) and around 1934 married again to , a dancer and author whose stage name was Eva Boy; the couple had one child (Anthony Jr., 1937). The financial strains of alimony and a new household lessened what Hoboken could spend on projects involving Schenker, including the photographic archive, and their relationship &quot;soured&quot;. Hoboken did, however, write a warm tribute obituary after Schenker&#x27;s death in 1935.

The Haydn catalog that now bears Hoboken&#x27;s name (see below) was begun in card format in 1934; work continued until the publication of the third and final book volume in 1978.

When Austria was taken over by Nazi Germany in 1938 (the &quot;Anschluss&quot;), Hoboken moved to Switzerland and remained there for the rest of his life. He lived with his family first in the home of the conductor Wilhelm Furtwängler in St. Moritz; from 1940 to 1950 he lived in Lausanne, and from 1951 to 1977 in Ascona. In 1977 he moved to Zürich, where he died in 1983 at the age of 96.

==The Hoboken catalog==
His greatest accomplishment, the work of over forty years, was the &quot;Hoboken catalog&quot;, or more formally &quot;Joseph Haydn, Thematisch-bibliographisches Werkverzeichnis&quot;. This is a catalogue, nearly 2000 pages in length, that brought order to the incompletely-grasped musical output of Joseph Haydn. The catalog proved influential and Haydn&#x27;s works today are often referred to by the &quot;Hoboken number&quot; (usually abbreviated to &quot;Hob&quot; or just &quot;H&quot;) by which they are designated in this catalogue.

King and Gemert offer assessment of the work in the &quot;New Grove&quot;:
The first volume, devoted to the instrumental works, was criticized for lack of information about manuscript sources. Nevertheless, Hoboken&#x27;s protracted study established the corpus of Haydn&#x27;s huge output, dealt with the problem of arrangements and supposititious works and generally brought order and identity to a vast area where much confusion, contention and uncertainty reigned for 150 years. All future Haydn scholarship will be in Hoboken&#x27;s debt. He achieved for Haydn what Köchel did for Mozart [see &quot;Köchel catalogue&quot;] and this too in a generation of vastly higher bibliographical standards.
==Honors==
Hoboken&#x27;s services to scholarship were recognized early on in 1932, when he received the Grosse Silberne Ehrenzeichen from the government of Austria; later on would follow multiple honorary degrees, a knighthood, and so on.

==Influence==
Proksch attributes some influence to Hoboken in the revival of Haydn&#x27;s critical reputation in the 20th century, not only as a result of the systematizing work of his catalog, but also in his influence on his teacher Schenker (whose own influence on musical scholarship in general was very substantial). Schenker in his earliest Haydn studies had relied on inaccurate editions and benefited from his free access to Hoboken&#x27;s collection of Haydn manuscripts. When Hoboken wrote to Schenker in 1927 that he had finished the boxing and indexing of his Haydn collection, Schenker replied with a deeply appreciative letter that foretold the later rise of Haydn&#x27;s critical fortunes:
You may take well-earned satisfaction in having so advanced Haydn&#x27;s cause with your very beautiful collection of first editions. Would God but grant that strokes of good luck kept pace with what you are striving for, which we all still owe Haydn -- where on earth could his things be hiding! ... No doubt that Haydn who today has sunk to the level of child-performers, will one day rise again from the children to the adults, as basically the rarest and most adult people of all belong to his circle.

<text>Carlos Santiago Nino (3 November 194329 August 1993) was an Argentine moral, legal and political philosopher.

==Biography==
Nino studied law at the University of Buenos Aires and at the University of Oxford, where he received his Ph.D. in 1977 with a thesis directed by John Finnis and Tony Honoré.

Nino began his academic activity in the early 1970s, concentrating on some traditional issues in jurisprudence, such as the concept of a legal system, the interpretation of the law, the debate between legal positivism and natural law, and the concept of validity. After realizing the need to clarify the normative problems involved in some of those issues, he was led to embrace a model based on the explicit adoption of principles of justice and social morality, rejecting the predominant German-inspired &quot;dogmatic&quot; approach. This signaled the beginning of his philosophical investigations, which were always oriented to practical issues, and marked by a distinctively analytical approach. His need to provide a liberal justification for criminal law practice thus lead him to moral philosophy, and to the development of an original &quot;consensual&quot; theory of punishment which combined the merits of the retributive and utilitarian (see deterrence) varieties while avoiding their respective difficulties. Similarly, the problems presented by the characterization of criminal conduct stimulated his work in the field of philosophy of action.

During the early 1980s, after the restoration of democracy, Nino became engaged in politics, serving as personal assistant to President Raúl Alfonsín and as coordinator of his newly created &quot;Consejo para la consolidación de la democracia&quot;, a special committee for the study and design of institutional reforms. His theoretical activities, however, were not forgotten: in 1984 he published his monumental &quot;Ética y derechos humanos&quot;, dedicated to Alfonsín, where he provided a comprehensive exposition of his moral thought; divided in three parts, it dealt with normative and applied ethics, as well as with meta-ethics. This last field he expanded in a separate volume, where he adopted a constructivist approach that attempted to derive his fundamental ethical principles from the presuppositions of moral discourse, in a manner that put him, as he said, &quot;between Rawls and Habermas&quot;. These substantive principles, comprising the nucleus of a theory that aspired to capture the essential components of political liberalism, were the principle of autonomy, the principle of inviolability, and the principle of dignity. The first expressed Nino&#x27;s conception of the good: those things, and those things only, that were valued by the individual in question. The second imposed deontological restrictions to the pursuit of that good, prohibiting the sacrifice of some to achieve the benefit of others. The third principle allowed for individual consent, thus permitting persons to waive the rights recognized by the second one.

With this solid normative foundation, Nino went to tackle some practical issues, such as abortion, capital punishment, and drug regulation. On the former, he proposed a gradualist approach similar to the American one, recognizing rights to the fetuses only when they showed the cognitive and affective capacities necessary for considering them moral persons. As regards death penalty, he was firmly opposed to it—as he was to the criminalization of drug consumption.

While on trip to La Paz, Bolivia in 1993 to work on the reform of the Bolivian constitution, Nino had an asthma attack and subsequently died. This tragedy killed a man who appeared to be at the peak of his productivity: the year before he had published two books, served as editor to two others, and had given the manuscripts of a couple more to his friend Owen Fiss, who assumed the responsibility of readying them for publication. &quot;The Constitution of Deliberative Democracy&quot; and &quot;Radical Evil on Trial&quot; saw the light in 1996. In the first he developed his &quot;epistemic justification&quot; of deliberative democracy, arguing that democratic deliberation provides better reasons to believe in the validity of moral norms than private reflection. The second is a moving personal description of the military junta trials; it provides a testimony to his unique ability to approach public affairs with both philosophical sophistication and political commitment.

<text>The black-winged kite (Elanus caeruleus), also known as the black-shouldered kite (not to be confused with the closely-related Australian species of the same name), is a small diurnal bird of prey in the family Accipitridae best known for its habit of hovering over open grasslands in the manner of the much smaller kestrels. This Palearctic and Afrotropical species was sometimes combined with the Australian black-shouldered kite (&quot;Elanus axillaris&quot;) and the white-tailed kite (&quot;Elanus leucurus&quot;) of North and South America which together form a superspecies. This kite is distinctive, with long wings; white, grey and black plumage; and owl-like forward-facing eyes with red irises. The owl-like behaviour is even more pronounced in the letter-winged kite (&quot;Elanus scriptus&quot;), a nocturnal relative in Australia. Although mainly seen on plains, they are sometimes seen on grassy slopes of hills in the higher elevation regions of Asia. They are not migratory, but show nomadism in response to weather and food availability. They are well adapted to utilize periodic upsurges in rodent populations and can raise multiple broods in a single year unlike most birds of prey. Populations in southern Europe have grown in response to human activities, particularly agriculture and livestock rearing. Now present in SouthWest France

The black-winged kite was described by the French naturalist René Louiche Desfontaines in 1789 and given the binomial name &quot;Falco caeruleus&quot;. It is now one of four species in the genus &quot;Elanus&quot; which was introduced in 1809 by the French zoologist Jules-César Savigny. The genus &quot;Elanus&quot; is distinctive in having very small scales covering the foot and on the underside, scutellate scales are found only under the terminal phalanges. The claw lacks a groove on the underside. The word &quot; Elanus&quot; is from Ancient Greek for a &quot;kite&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;caeruleus&quot; is the Latin for &quot;blue&quot;.

There are three subspecies:
* &quot;E. c. caeruleus&quot; (Desfontaines, 1789) – southwest Iberian Peninsula, Africa, southwest Arabia
* &quot;E. c. vociferus&quot; (Latham, 1790) – Pakistan to east China, Malay Peninsula and Indochina. The underwing secondaries are smoky grey and nearly white in the nominate subspecies.
* &quot;E. c. hypoleucus&quot; Gould, 1859 – Greater and Lesser Sunda Islands, the Philippines, Sulawesi and New Guinea

== Description ==

This long-winged raptor is predominantly grey or white with black shoulder patches, wing tips and eye stripe. The long falcon-like wings extend beyond the tail when the bird is perched. In flight, the short and square tail is visible and it is not forked as in the typical kites of the genus &quot;Milvus&quot;. When perched, often on roadside wires, it often adjusts its wings and jerks its tail up and down as if to balance itself. The sexes are alike in plumage. Their large forward-facing eyes placed under a bony shelf that shades them is distinctive; their velvety plumage and zygodactyl feet are characters shared with owls and the genus has been considered as a basal group within the Accipitridae. They are thought to have been adapted for living in savanna habitats where seasonal rodent population peaks occur. Such food resources are also favoured by the owls. The inner vanes of the feathers have velvety barbules. They have a diploid chromosome number of 68 (some older studies claimed 64 for &quot;E.c.caeruleus&quot; and 66 for &quot;E.c.vociferus&quot;) with a distinct karyotype with resemblances to the kites and honey buzzards and suggesting a basal position within the diurnal birds of prey.

==Distribution and habitat==
The black-winged kite is a species primarily of open land and semi-deserts in sub-Saharan Africa and tropical Asia, but it has a foothold within Europe in Spain and Portugal. The species range appears to be expanding in southern Europe and, more recently, also to West Asia. The first records of breeding in Europe were in the 1860s and since then they have become more widespread and populations are on the rise. It is thought that land-use changes, particularly agriculture and pastureland have helped the species. The species has expanded its range in southern Europe and vagrants from Switzerland and England indicate that the species is moving north.
Several geographic populations have been named as subspecies and these include the nominate subspecies which occurs in Spain, Africa and Arabia. The subspecies &quot;vociferus&quot; is found east of this range across South Asia and into Southeast Asia. Along Sumatra, Java, Borneo and the Philippines subspecies &quot;hypoleucus&quot; (sometimes considered a full species) includes the population &quot;wahgiensis&quot; described from New Guinea. The subspecies &quot;sumatranus&quot; is not always recognized. The white-tailed kite and the black-shouldered kite were formerly included with this species but have since been treated as separate species.

Although found mainly on the plains they have been seen at higher altitudes in Sikkim (), the Nilgiris (Doddabetta, ) and Nagaland ().

They are said to be winter visitors in some parts of their range such as the Western Ghats.

==Behaviour and ecology==

The black-winged kite breeds at different times of the year across its range. Although nesting has been noted throughout the year in India, they appear not to breed in April and May. Males establish territories and defend them from competition. Females move into the territories of males. Studies in Africa found that males were more numerous than females. Courtship is noisy and involves chases and once the pair is formed they copulate frequently. The nest is a loose platform of twigs in which 3 or 4 eggs are laid. The female spends more effort in the construction of the nest than the male. The eggs are pale creamy with spots of deep red. Both parents incubate but when the chicks hatch, the male spends more time on foraging for food. Females initially feed the young, sometimes hunting close to the nest but will also receive food from the male. After fledging the young birds continue to be dependent for food on the male parent for about 80 days, initially transferring food at perch and later in the air. Young birds have reddish brown feathers on the upperparts and on the breast. The reddish colour is derived from porphyrins and is thought to provide the young birds some camouflage. Once breeding is complete females often move on to new territories sometimes deserting before the young fledge, leaving males to feed and raise the young. Both males and females show considerable nomadism. Unlike most birds of prey, they are capable of raising multiple broods in a year, and young birds are known to disperse widely, adaptations that helps them utilize periodic rodent population surges. Their opportunistic breeding capabilities are also accompanied by irregular patterns of moult. Young birds show &quot;arrested&quot; moult, retaining feathers for a season and then rapidly moulting them in a serial descendent pattern, where more than one primary feather is moulted at the same time. The adult plumage is found after two years.

Their prey includes grasshoppers, crickets and other large insects, lizards, and rodents. Injured birds, small snakes and frogs have also been reported. The black-winged kite flies slowly during hunting like a harrier, but it will also hover like a kestrel. It has on rare occasions been known to hunt prey in flight. Perches are used for hunting and for feeding but large prey may sometimes be handled on the ground. In southern Africa, they appear to favour roadside verges for foraging and are sometimes killed by collisions with vehicles.

These birds roost communally with groups of 15 to 35 (larger numbers in Europe) converging at a large leafy tree. They are extremely silent and the calls recorded include a high-pitched squeal or a soft whistle. They call mainly during the breeding season and at the roost site.
A species of nematode, &quot;Physaloptera acuticauda&quot;, has been recorded as a parasite of the species in South Africa. A trematode species, &quot;Neodiplostomum elani&quot;, has been described from a black-winged kite type host from Chandigarh. A feather louse &quot;Degeeriella elani&quot; is known from the species.

The soft feathers of black-winged kites can lead to adherence with some grass seeds which may be dispersed by the species. However such seeds can pose the risk of entangling their wings.

<text>Cabernet Franc is one of the major black grape varieties worldwide. It is principally grown for blending with Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot in the Bordeaux style, but can also be vinified alone, as in the Loire&#x27;s Chinon. In addition to being used in blends and produced as a varietal in Canada, Lake Erie AVA in Pennsylvania, and across the United States and Argentina, it is sometimes made into ice wine in those regions.

Cabernet Franc is lighter than Cabernet Sauvignon, making a bright pale red wine that contributes finesse and lends a peppery perfume to blends with more robust grapes. Depending on the growing region and style of wine, additional aromas can include tobacco, raspberry, bell pepper, cassis, and violets.

Records of Cabernet Franc in Bordeaux go back to the end of the 18th century, although it was planted in Loire long before that time. DNA analysis indicates that Cabernet Franc is one of two parents of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and Carménère.

==History==

Cabernet Franc is believed to have been established in the Libournais region of southwest France sometime in the 17th century, when Cardinal Richelieu transported cuttings of the vine to the Loire Valley. They were planted at the Abbey of Bourgueil under the care of an abbot named Breton, whose name became associated with the grape. By the 18th century, plantings of Cabernet Franc (known as Bouchet) were found throughout Fronsac, Pomerol and St-Emilion, making quality wines. As Cabernet Sauvignon grew more popular in the 18th and 19th centuries, the close similarity of the two grapes was observed and theories emerged as to the extent of their relationship. In 1997, DNA evidence emerged to show that Cabernet Franc had crossed with Sauvignon Blanc to produce Cabernet Sauvignon.

==Viticulture==

In general, Cabernet Franc is very similar to Cabernet Sauvignon, but buds and ripens at least a week earlier. This trait allows the vine to thrive in slightly cooler climates than Cabernet Sauvignon, such as the Loire Valley. In Bordeaux, plantings of Cabernet Franc are treated as an &quot;insurance policy&quot; against inclement weather close to harvest that may damage plantings of Cabernet Sauvignon. Its early budding does pose the viticultural hazard of coulure early in the growing season. The vine is vigorous and upright, with dark-green, 5-lobed leaves. The winged bunches are elongated and small-medium in size. The berries are quite small and blue-black in color, with fairly thin skins. The Cabernet Franc grapevine is more prone to mutation than Cabernet Sauvignon, less so than Pinot noir.

Cabernet Franc can adapt to a wide variety of vineyard soil types but seems to thrive in sandy, chalk soils, producing heavier, more full bodied wines there. In the Loire Valley, &quot;terroir&quot; based differences can be perceived between wines made from grapes grown in gravel terraces versus tuffeau slopes. The grape is highly yield sensitive, with over-cropping producing wines with more green, vegetal notes.

==Wine regions==
Across the world Cabernet Franc is one of the twenty most widely planted grape varieties. Plantings are found throughout Europe, in the New World, China and Kazakhstan. In many regions, it is planted as a component of a Bordeaux-style blend such as Meritage, playing secondary role to Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot. In parts of northeast Italy, Anjou-Saumur, Touraine and the right bank region of Bordeaux, Cabernet Franc both plays a more prominent role in blends and is vinted as a varietal.

===France===

In France, Cabernet Franc is found predominantly in the Loire Valley and in the Libournais region of Bordeaux. As of 2000, it was the sixth most widely planted red grape variety in the country. Other areas with significant plantings include the Bergerac and Madiran &quot;Appellation d&#x27;origine contrôlée&quot; (AOCs). By the early 20th century, there were nearly equal plantings of Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc in Bordeaux with around by the late 1960s. Most of these plantings were along the right bank of the Gironde in the Fronsac, St-Emilion and Pomerol regions. Towards the end of the 20th century, even though plantings of Cabernet Sauvignon had rapidly increased in Bordeaux to a 2 to 1 ratio in proportion to Cabernet Franc, plantings there were over of the latter, nearly half of the country&#x27;s total .

In the Loire Valley, Cabernet is widely planted in the Anjou, Bourgueil, Chinon, and Saumur-Champigny regions.

===Italy===
By 2000 there were over of Cabernet Franc in Italy. However, the grape variety is commonly confused with both Cabernet Sauvignon and the ancient Bordeaux grape Carmenere, so the true acreage may not be known until more vineyards have been surveyed by ampelographers. It is mostly planted in the far northeast of Italy, particularly in Friuli, but it is also found in the vineyards of the Veneto (where it is known as Bordo), and is found as part of some Chianti blends, even as far south as Apulia. Plantings of Cabernet Franc in Tuscany have been increasing in recent years, particularly in the Bolgheri and Maremma region where the grape is prized for the balance and elegance that it brings to blends. Italian wines often labelled simply as &quot;Cabernet&quot; tend to be primarily Cabernet Franc or a blend of Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon.
=== Hungary ===

Cabernet Franc in Hungary had gained attention by the end of the 1990s when in some wine producing regions climate and growing conditions proved to be not optimal for Cabernet Sauvignon to reach its full ripeness. Successful varietal examples from Villány and Szekszárd show great potential, some international experts declared that Cabernet Franc &quot;found its new home in Villány region&quot;. Hungarian varietal Cabernet Franc is a typically full-bodied, moderately or highly tannic wine with rich aromas of spices, blue flowers and red/black berry fruits with a reasonably good aging potential of about 10 years. These wines typically undergo 12 to 18 months of aging in new Hungarian oak barrels.

In addition to being found in Villány and Szekszárd, Cabernet Franc is also present in Eger, and in South Balaton and Sopron vineyards, to a lesser extent. Cabernet Franc often complements Bordeaux-style blends from these regions and occasionally plays a role in rosé production.

===Other European regions===
Outside France and Italy, sizable plantings of Cabernet Franc are found in Greece (where it is known as tsapournakos), Bulgaria, Slovenia, Croatia particularly in the Savudrija part of Istria, Croatia. This variety of grape is not very common in Spain, and is grown mainly in Catalonia, where it is an authorized variety in four DOPs: Catalunya (DO), Costers del Segre, Empordà, Pla de Bages, and Priorat. It is also grown Valencia and Castilla-La Mancha. In 2015, Spain grew of Cabernet Franc.

===Canada===
Cabernet Franc is becoming more popular in Canada, being planted in Ontario&#x27;s Niagara Peninsula, Prince Edward County, the north shore of Lake Erie, Pelee Island, and the Okanagan Valley in British Columbia. While it is most often used in blends, it is gaining some popularity as a single varietal and as icewine. Ripening about two weeks earlier than Cabernet Sauvignon, it often fares better in Canada&#x27;s cooler climate than other red wine grape varieties. Ontario Cabernet Francs often add a characteristic vegetal, raspberry like flavor to a wine with moderate acidity.

===United States===

Interest in the grape started with California wine makers, who wanted to replicate the Bordeaux blend (now marketed as Meritage). In the early to mid 20th century, some plantings of Cabernet Franc were mistaken for Merlot. In the 1980s, heightened interest in Cabernet Franc led to an increase in plantings that helped push the total acreage of Cabernet Franc in California to , most of which is in Napa and Sonoma counties. In 1986, Casa Nuestra Winery in Napa Valley initiated the first Cabernet Franc program in the United States, winning a Double Gold and Best of Class Medal in the Los Angeles Times Wine Competition for their first vintage. The program continues today.

More recently the grape has caught the attention of growers in cooler areas such as Long Island and the Finger Lakes of New York, the Grand Valley AVA of Colorado, the Shawnee Hills AVA of southern Illinois, Pennsylvania, all sub-regions in Ohio, Michigan&#x27;s west coast, Washington state and in the Monticello wine region in the Virginia Piedmont as well as the Roanoke metropolitan area, increasing planting in Missouri and Rocky Knob AVA areas of Southwestern Virginia. Michigan State University conducts research on Cabernet Franc at their agricultural research center in Benton Harbor, Michigan. In the Great Lakes Region and Virginia, Cabernet Franc is valued for its ability to ripen more reliably than other red &quot;Vitis vinifera&quot; and to produce wines of better quality than most hybrid grapes.

In Washington State, the first plantings of Cabernet Franc were cultivated in experimental blocks by Washington State University in the Columbia Valley during the 1970s. In 1985, Cabernet Franc was planted in the Red Willow Vineyard for use in Bordeaux style blends. The first varietal Cabernet Franc in Washington was released in 1991 by Columbia Winery followed by Chateau Ste Michelle in 1992 with grapes planted from their Cold Creek Vineyard. In the 1990s, Chinook Winery introduced the state&#x27;s first Cabernet Franc &quot;rosé&quot;. Today it is the fourth most widely planted grape in the state behind Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and Syrah. Washington Cabernet Franc is distinctive for its fruit forward style with blueberry and raspberry fruit. The characteristic vegetal notes are toned down in Washington, with the wines tending to show more notes of ground coffee and olives.

=== Argentina ===
Cabernet Franc plantings in Argentina have been producing top quality wines in recent years, and the varietal has been claimed as having the most potential in the country after Malbec. &quot;Squeeze Magazine&quot; has called it &quot;the new, handsome superhero of Mendoza&#x27;s wine scene&quot;. In 2014, the highest scoring Argentine wine in Robert Parker&#x27;s &quot;Wine Advocate&quot; was a Cabernet Franc scored at 97 points. Cabernet Franc can be bottled alone, making lighter-bodied wines than the country&#x27;s typical Malbecs (with wines scoring up to 95 points in Tim Atkin&#x27;s report in 2016), or either as a majority or minority in blends.

===Other New World regions===

In the New World, Cabernet is used predominantly as a blending component and is found in scant amounts in Australia, South Africa, Chile and New Zealand. As with so many grapes, Cabernet Franc came to Australia in James Busby&#x27;s collection of 1832. It predominantly grows in cool, cool to warm and warm climates such as North-Eastern Victoria, McLaren Vale, the Adelaide Hills and the Clare Valley. In New Zealand, many winemakers have found that the cool climate of their &quot;terroir&quot; contributes to Cabernet Franc-like flavors in their Cabernet Sauvignon and plantings of true Cabernet Franc have remained limited with only around planted as of 2006. In South Africa, Cabernet Franc has become a favorite of some of the country&#x27;s &quot;boutique&quot; wineries and acreage has slowly been increasing to nearly by the mid-2000s. In Chile there were around planted by the early 21st century.

==Wines==

Cabernet Franc shares many of the same phenolic and aroma compounds as Cabernet Sauvignon but with some noticeable differences. Cabernet Franc tends to be more lightly pigmented and produces wines with the same level of intensity and richness. Cabernet Franc tends to have a more pronounced perfume with notes of raspberries, blackcurrants, violets and graphite. It is often characterized by a green, vegetal strike that can range from leaves to green bell peppers. It has slightly less tannins than Cabernet Sauvignon and tends to produce a wine with a smoother mouthfeel. New World examples of Cabernet Franc tend to emphasize the fruit more and may delay harvesting the grapes to try to minimize the green leafy notes.

<text>The is a period of Japanese history that marks the governance by the Kamakura shogunate, officially established in 1192 in Kamakura by the first &quot;shōgun&quot; Minamoto no Yoritomo after the conclusion of the Genpei War, which saw the struggle between the Taira and Minamoto clans. The period is known for the emergence of the samurai, the warrior caste, and for the establishment of feudalism in Japan.

There are various theories as to the year in which the Kamakura period and Kamakura shogunate began. In the past, the most popular theory was that the year was 1192, when Minamoto no Yoritomo was appointed . Later, the prevailing theory was that the year was 1185, when Yoritomo established the , which controlled military and police power in various regions, and the , which was in charge of tax collection and land administration. Japanese history textbooks as of 2016 do not specify a specific year for the beginning of the Kamakura period, as there are various theories about the year the Kamakura shogunate was established.

During the early Kamakura period, the shogunate continued warfare against the Northern Fujiwara which was only defeated in 1189. Then, the authority to the Kamakura rulers waned in the 1190s and power was transferred to the powerful Hōjō clan in the early 13th century with the head of the clan as regent (Shikken) under the shogun which became a powerless figurehead. The later Kamakura period saw the invasions of the Mongols in 1274 and again in 1281. To reduce the amount of chaos, the Hōjō rulers decided to decentralize power by allowing two imperial lines – Northern and Southern court, to alternate the throne. In the 1330s, the Southern court under Emperor Go-Daigo revolted and eventually led to the Siege of Kamakura in 1333 which ended the rule of the shogunate. With this, the Kamakura period ended. There was a short re-establishment (1333–1336) of imperial rule under Go-Daigo assisted by Ashikaga Takauji and Nitta Yoshisada but would later lead to direct rule under Ashikaga, forming the Ashikaga shogunate in the succeeding Muromachi period.

Several significant administrative achievements were made during the Hōjō regency. These provided the opportunities for other military lords to exercise judicial and legislative authority and the government established a council centered around collective leadership. The period saw the adoption of Japan&#x27;s first military code of law in 1232. There was an expansion of Buddhist teachings into Old Buddhism (&quot;Kyū Bukkyō&quot;) and New Buddhism (&quot;Shin Bukkyō&quot;).

== Shogunate and Hōjō regency ==

The Kamakura period marked Japan&#x27;s transition to a land-based economy and the concentration of advanced military technologies in the hands of a specialized fighting class. Lords required the loyal services of vassals, who were rewarded with fiefs of their own; the fief holders then exercised local military rule. Once Minamoto no Yoritomo had consolidated his power, he established a new government at his family home in Kamakura. He called his government a , but because he was given the ancient high military title by Emperor Go-Toba, the government is often referred to in Western literature as the Shogunate. Yoritomo followed the Fujiwara form of house government and had an , a , and a . After confiscating estates in central and western Japan, he appointed stewards for the estates and constables for the provinces. As , Yoritomo was both the steward and the constable general.

The Kamakura shogunate was not a national regime, however, and although it controlled large tracts of land, there was strong resistance to the stewards. The regime continued warfare against the Northern Fujiwara, but never brought either the north or the west under complete military control. However, the fourth leader of the Northern Fujiwara Fujiwara no Yasuhira was defeated by Yoritomo in 1189, and the 100-year-long prosperity of the north disappeared. The old court resided in Kyoto, continuing to hold the land over which it had jurisdiction, while newly organized military families were attracted to Kamakura.

Despite a strong beginning, Yoritomo failed to consolidate the leadership of his family on a lasting basis. Intrafamily contention had long existed within the Minamoto, although Yoritomo had eliminated most serious challengers to his authority. When he died suddenly in 1199, his son Minamoto no Yoriie became and nominal head of the Minamoto, but Yoriie was unable to control the other eastern warrior families. By the early 13th century, a regency had been established by Hōjō Tokimasa—a member of the Hōjō clan, a branch of the Taira that had allied itself with the Minamoto in 1180. The head of Hōjō was installed as a regent for the ; the regent was termed the during the period, although later positions were created with similar power such as the and the . Often the was also the and . Under the Hōjō, the became a powerless figurehead.

With the protection of the Emperor, a figurehead himself, strains emerged between Kyoto and Kamakura, and in 1221 the Jōkyū War broke out between the cloistered Emperor Go-Toba and the second regent Hōjō Yoshitoki. The Hōjō forces easily won the war, and the imperial court was brought under the direct control of the shogunate. The &#x27;s constables gained greater civil powers, and the court was obliged to seek Kamakura&#x27;s approval for all of its actions. Although deprived of political power, the court retained extensive estates.

Several significant administrative achievements were made during the Hōjō regency. In 1225 the third regent Hōjō Yasutoki established the Council of State, providing opportunities for other military lords to exercise judicial and legislative authority within the Kamakura regime. The Hōjō regent presided over the council, which was a successful form of collective leadership. The adoption of Japan&#x27;s first military code of law—the —in 1232 reflected the profound transition from court to militarized society. While legal practices in Kyoto were still based on 500-year-old Confucian principles, the new code was a highly legalistic document that stressed the duties of stewards and constables, provided means for settling land disputes, and established rules governing inheritances. It was clear and concise, stipulated punishments for violators of its conditions, and parts of it remained in effect for the next 635 years.

As might be expected, the literature of the time reflected the unsettled nature of the period. The describes the turmoil of the period in terms of the Buddhist concepts of impermanence and the vanity of human projects. The narrated the rise and fall of the Taira clan, replete with tales of wars and samurai deeds. A second literary mainstream was the continuation of anthologies of poetry in the , of which twenty volumes were produced between 1201 and 1205.

== Expansion of Buddhist teachings ==
During the Kamakura period six new Buddhist schools (classified by scholars as &quot;New Buddhism&quot; or &quot;Shin Bukkyo&quot;) were founded:
* Hōnen (1133–1212) founded the Japanese Pure Land school or Jōdo-shū.
* Eisai (1141–1215) founded the Rinzai school of Zen.
* Shinran (1173–1263) founded the sect.
* Dōgen (1200–1253) founded the Sōtō school of Zen.
* Nichiren (1222–1282) founded the Nichiren school.
* Ippen (1239–1289) founded the Ji-shū branch of Pure Land Buddhism.

During this time the pre-existing schools of Tendai, founded by Saichō (767–822), Shingon, founded by Kūkai (774–835), and the great temples of Nara, collectively classified by scholars as &quot;Old Buddhism&quot; or &quot;Kyū Bukkyo&quot;, continued to thrive, adapt, and exert influence. For example, all of the above six reformers had studied at the Tendai Mt. Hiei at some point in their lives.

=== &quot;Old Buddhism&quot; &quot;(Kyū Bukkyō)&quot; ===
Throughout the Kamakura period, older Buddhist sects including Shingon, Tendai, and the Nara temple schools such as Kegon, Hossō, Sanron, and Ritsu continued to thrive and adapt to the trend of the times.

At the start of the Kamakura period, the Mount Hiei monasteries had become politically powerful, appealing primarily to those capable of systematic study of the sect&#x27;s teachings. The Shingon sect and its esoteric ritual continued to enjoy support largely from the noble families in Kyoto. However, with the increasing popularity of the new Kamakura schools, the older schools partially eclipsed as the newer &quot;Kamakura&quot; schools found followers among the new Kamakura government, and its samurai.

The times that gave way to the Kamakura period were marked by political and military conflict, natural disasters, and social malaise attributed to the perceived arrival of the Latter Day of the Law. The new social order of a declining aristocracy and ascending military and peasant classes resulted in new forms of religion, both indigenous and Buddhist while Indian and Chinese influence continued. Furthermore, the Shōen manor system which had taken root in this era resulted in the increased prosperity and literacy of peasants which in turn provided more financial support for Buddhist teachers and their studies.

=== &quot;New Buddhism&quot; &quot;(Shin Bukkyō)&quot; ===
The first originators of Kamakura Buddhism schools were Hōnen and Shinran who emphasized belief and practice over formalism.

In the latter part of the 12th-century Dōgen and Eisai traveled to China and upon their return to Japan founded, respectively, the Sōtō and Rinzai schools of Zen. Dōgen rejected affiliations with the secular authorities whereas Eisai actively sought them. Whereas Eisai thought that Zen teachings would revitalize the Tendai school, Dōgen aimed for an ineffable absolute, a pure Zen teaching that was not tied to beliefs and practices from Tendai or other orthodox schools and with little guidance for leading people how to live in the secular world.

The final stage of Kamakura Buddhism, occurring some 50 years after Hōnen, was marked by new social and political conditions as the aristocracy declined, the military class asserted new influence, and Buddhist-infused local &quot;kami&quot; practice among peasants flourished. These changing conditions created a climate that encouraged religious innovation. Nichiren and Ippen attempted at this time to create down-to-earth teachings that were rooted in the daily concerns of people. Nichiren rejected the focus on &quot;next-worldly&quot; salvation such a rebirth in a Pure Land and instead aimed for &quot;this-worldly&quot; personal and national liberation through a simple and accessible practice. Ippen emphasized a popularized form of nenbutsu recitation with an emphasis on practice rather than concentrating on an individual&#x27;s underlying mental state.

=== Legacy of Kamakura Buddhism ===
As time evolved the distinctions between &quot;Old&quot; and &quot;New&quot; Buddhisms blurred as they formed &quot;cultic centers&quot; and various forms of founder worship. The medieval structures of these schools evolved into hierarchical head temple-branch temple structures with associated rituals and forms of worship. This culminated in the state-sanctioned formalized schools of the Tokugawa period.

== Mongol invasions ==
The repulsions of two invasions by the Mongol-led Yuan dynasty were momentous events in Japanese history. Nichiren had predicted these invasions years earlier, in his &quot;Rissho Ankoku Ron&quot;, a letter to the regency. Japanese relations with China had been terminated in the mid-ninth century after the deterioration of the Tang dynasty and the turning inward of the Heian court. Some commercial contacts were maintained with the Southern Song dynasty in later centuries, but Japanese pirates made the open seas dangerous. At a time when the shogunate had little interest in foreign affairs and ignored communications from China and the Goryeo dynasty, news arrived in 1268 of a new Mongol-led regime in Beijing. Its leader, Kublai, demanded that the Japanese pay tribute to the new Yuan dynasty and threatened reprisals if they failed to do so. Unused to such threats, Kyoto raised the diplomatic counter of Japan&#x27;s divine origin, rejected the Yuan demands, dismissed the Goryeo messengers, and started defensive preparations.

After further unsuccessful entreaties, the first Mongol invasion took place in 1274. More than 600 ships carried a combined ethnic Mongol, Han, and Korean force of 23,000 troops armed with catapults, combustible missiles, and bows and arrows. In fighting, these soldiers grouped in close cavalry formations against samurai, who were accustomed to one-on-one combat. Local Japanese forces at Hakata, on northern Kyūshū, defended against the advantageous mainland force, which, after one day of fighting was destroyed by the onslaught of a sudden typhoon. Kublai realized that nature, not military incompetence, had been the cause of his forces&#x27; failure so, in 1281, he launched a second invasion. Seven weeks of fighting took place in northwestern Kyūshū before another typhoon struck, again destroying the Yuan fleet, which was mostly composed of hastily acquired, flat-bottomed Chinese ships especially vulnerable to powerful typhoons.

Although Shinto priests attributed the two defeats of the Mongols to a &quot;divine wind&quot; or kamikaze, a sign of heaven&#x27;s special protection of Japan, the invasion left a deep impression on the shogunate leaders. Long-standing fears of the Chinese threat to Japan were reinforced. The victory also convinced the warriors of the value of the shogunate form of government.

The Yuan invasions had been a drain on the economy, and new taxes had to be levied to maintain defensive preparations for the future. The invasions also caused disaffection among those who expected recompense for their help in defeating the Yuan dynasty. There were no lands or other rewards to be given, however, and such disaffection, combined with overextension and the increasing defense costs, led to a decline of the Kamakura bakufu. Additionally, inheritances had divided family properties, and landowners increasingly had to turn to moneylenders for support. Roving bands of rōnin further threatened the stability of the shogunate.

== Civil war ==
The Hōjō reacted to the ensuing chaos by trying to place more power among the various great family clans. To further weaken the Kyoto court, the bakufu decided to allow two contending imperial lines—known as the Southern Court or junior line and the Northern Court or senior line—to alternate on the throne. The method worked for several successions until a member of the Southern Court ascended to the throne as Emperor Go-Daigo. Go-Daigo wanted to overthrow the shogunate, and he openly defied Kamakura by naming his own son his heir. In 1331 the shogunate exiled Go-Daigo, but loyalist forces, including Kusunoki Masashige, rebelled. They were aided by Ashikaga Takauji, a constable who turned against the Kamakura when dispatched to put down Go-Daigo&#x27;s rebellion. At the same time, Nitta Yoshisada, another eastern chieftain, rebelled against the shogunate, which quickly disintegrated, and the Hōjō were defeated.

In the swell of victory, Go-Daigo endeavored to restore imperial authority and tenth-century Confucian practices. This period of reform, known as the Kenmu Restoration, aimed at strengthening the position of the emperor and reasserting the primacy of the court nobles over the warriors&#x27; caste. The reality, however, was that the forces who had arisen against Kamakura had been set on defeating the Hōjō, not on supporting the emperor. Ashikaga Takauji finally sided with the Northern Court in a civil war against the Southern Court represented by Go-Daigo. The long &quot;War Between the Courts&quot; lasted from 1336 to 1392. Early in the conflict, Go-Daigo was driven from Kyoto, and the Northern Court contender was installed by Ashikaga, who established a new line of shoguns.

== Events ==
*1185: the rival Taira clan is defeated at sea at the Battle of Dan-no-ura by Yoritomo&#x27;s brother Minamoto no Yoshitsune.
*1192: The Emperor Go-Toba appoints Yoritomo as &quot;shōgun&quot; (military leader) with a residence in Kamakura, establishing the &quot;bakufu&quot; system of government.
*1199: Minamoto no Yoritomo dies.
*1207: Hōnen and his followers are exiled from Kyoto or executed. This inadvertently spread the Pure Land doctrine to a wider audience.
*1221: The Kamakura army defeats the imperial army in the Jōkyū Disturbance, thereby asserting the supremacy of the Kamakura shogunate (Hōjō regents) over the emperor.
*1227: The Sōtō sect of Zen Buddhism is introduced to Japan by monk Dōgen Zenji.
*1232: The &quot;Jōei Shikimoku&quot; code of law is promulgated to enhance control by the Hōjō regents.
*1271: Nichiren is banished to Sado Island.
*1274 &amp; 1281: The Mongols of Kublai Khan try to invade Japan but are repelled by a typhoon.
*1293: On May 27, a major earthquake and tsunami hit Sagami Bay and Kamakura, killing 23,034 people. It followed a 1241 and 1257 earthquake/tsunami in the same general area, which both were of magnitude 7.0.
*1333: Nitta Yoshisada conquers and destroys Kamakura during the Siege of Kamakura ending the Kamakura shogunate.

<text>Reprise Records is an American record label founded in 1960 by Frank Sinatra. It is owned by Warner Music Group, and operates through Warner Records, one of its flagship labels.

Artists currently signed to Reprise Records include Green Day, Enya, Michael Bublé, Eric Clapton, Stevie Nicks, Neil Young, Deftones, Mastodon, Lindsey Buckingham, Josh Groban, Disturbed, Idina Menzel, My Chemical Romance, Gerard Way, Dwight Yoakam, Never Shout Never, and Billy Strings.

==Company history==
===Beginnings===

Reprise Records was formed in 1960 by Frank Sinatra in order to allow more artistic freedom for his own recordings. Soon thereafter, he garnered the nickname &quot;The Chairman of the Board&quot;. Because of dissatisfaction with Capitol Records, and after trying to buy Norman Granz&#x27;s Verve Records, the first album Sinatra released on Reprise was &quot;Ring-a-Ding-Ding!&quot; As CEO of Reprise, Sinatra recruited several artists for the fledgling label, such as fellow Rat Pack members Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr. The original roster from 1961 to 1963 included Bing Crosby, Jo Stafford, Rosemary Clooney, Duke Ellington, Nancy Sinatra, Esquivel and stand-up comedian Redd Foxx. The original Reprise LP label had four different logos, depending on the genre: a riverboat for Pop records (pictured), a cherub for Jazz records, an owl for Spoken Word/Comedy records, and a picture of Sinatra for his records.
One of the label&#x27;s founding principles under Sinatra&#x27;s leadership was that each artist would have full creative freedom, and at some point complete ownership of their work, including publishing rights. This is the reason why recordings of early Reprise artists (Dean Martin, Jimi Hendrix, the Kinks, etc.) are (in most cases) currently distributed through other labels. In Martin&#x27;s case, his Reprise recordings were out of print for nearly 20 years before a deal was struck with Capitol Records. Reprise continued to reissue the Sinatra catalog until 2013 when it was sold to Capitol.

===Sale to Warner Bros.===
In August 1963, as part of a film deal, Warner Bros. purchased Reprise (which had been losing money) from Frank Sinatra, who nonetheless retained a 1/3 interest in the label. Many of the older artists on the label were dropped by Warner Bros. Records. Reprise president Mo Ostin was retained as the head of the label and he went on to play a very significant role in the history of the Warner group of labels over the next four decades. Warner-Reprise executives began targeting younger acts, beginning by securing the American distribution rights to the Pye Records recordings by the Kinks in 1964. Reprise soon added teen-oriented pop acts like Dino, Desi &amp; Billy to the roster. As well, Sinatra&#x27;s own daughter Nancy (who began recording for the label in 1961) was retained by Ostin, becoming a major pop star from late 1965. The label moved almost exclusively to rock-oriented music in the late 1960s, although Frank Sinatra continued to record for the label until the 1980s.

Through direct signings or distribution deals, by the 1970s the Reprise roster grew to include Lee Hazlewood, Jill Jackson, Jimi Hendrix, the early Joni Mitchell recordings, Neil Young, the Electric Prunes, Donna Loren, Arlo Guthrie, Norman Greenbaum, Tom Lehrer, Kenny Rogers and The First Edition, Tiny Tim, Ry Cooder, Captain Beefheart, John Sebastian, Family, the early 1970s recordings by Frank Zappa and the Mothers, Gram Parsons, Emmylou Harris, Nico&#x27;s &quot;Desertshore&quot;, the Fugs, Jethro Tull, Pentangle, T. Rex, the Meters, John Cale, Gordon Lightfoot, Michael Franks, Richard Pryor, Al Jarreau, Fleetwood Mac, Fanny, and the Beach Boys.

===Dormancy===
In 1976, the Reprise label was deactivated by Warner Bros. and all of its roster (except Frank Sinatra and Neil Young) was moved to the main Warner Bros. label. Although older catalog albums continued to be manufactured with the Reprise logo, and albums by the Beach Boys on Brother Records were issued in the Reprise catalog numbering sequence, aside from Sinatra and Young (and the Sylvia Syms album &quot;Syms by Sinatra&quot;, which Sinatra conducted and co-produced) there were no new releases on Reprise for several years.

===Revival and Reprise today (1985–present)===
In late 1985, some copies of the Dream Academy&#x27;s hit single &quot;Life in a Northern Town&quot; were pressed on the Warner Bros. label bearing the Reprise logo. 1986 saw releases bearing Reprise labels from the Dream Academy as well as Dwight Yoakam. In summer 1987, Warner Bros. Records chairman Mo Ostin and label president Lenny Waronker officially announced the reactivation of Reprise, including its own separate promotions department, and former Warner Bros. Vice President of Promotion Rich Fitzgerald was appointed as label vice president. In the time since, Warner Bros. has often elevated the stature of Reprise to the rank of secondary parent label, as many of its subsidiary labels (such as Straight and Kinetic) have had their records released in conjunction with Reprise.

As of 2017, it is home to such artists as Enya, Michael Bublé, Eric Clapton, Green Day, Stevie Nicks, Neil Young, Deftones, Josh Groban, Disturbed, Idina Menzel, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, Gerard Way and Never Shout Never.

It was formerly home to Jimi Hendrix and the Barenaked Ladies&#x27; catalogs in the U.S. When the Bee Gees back catalog was remastered by Rhino Records in the 2000s, their CDs were issued under the Reprise label (they appeared on sister labels Atco and Warner Bros. in the past).

Neil Young stated in a documentary about his life that Charles Manson was turned down by Reprise.

In 2010, Reprise opened a country music division, operating as part of Warner Music Group Nashville, featuring Blake Shelton, the JaneDear Girls, Michelle Branch and Frankie Ballard as part of its roster.

In September 2011, several layoffs took place at Reprise Records and other Warner labels.

In 2017, Reprise released Enya&#x27;s albums on vinyl. Some of them were pressed on this format for the first time.
