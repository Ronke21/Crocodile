<text>William Edward Simon (November 27, 1927 – June 3, 2000) was an American businessman and philanthropist who served as the 63rd United States Secretary of the Treasury. He became the Secretary of the Treasury on May 9, 1974, during the Nixon administration. After Nixon resigned, Simon was reappointed by President Gerald Ford and served until 1977 when President Jimmy Carter took office. Outside of government, he was a successful businessman and philanthropist. The William E. Simon Foundation carries on this legacy. He styled himself as a strong advocate of laissez-faire capitalism. He wrote, &quot;There is only one social system that reflects the sovereignty of the individual: the free-market, or capitalist, system&quot;.

==Early life and career==
Simon was born in Paterson, New Jersey, on November 27, 1927, the son of Eleanor (née Kearns) and Charles Simon Jr., an insurance executive. He attended Blair Academy and graduated from Newark Academy, where he focused more on sports than scholastic pursuits. 

After service in the infantry of the United States Army, he received his B.A. in 1952 from Lafayette College in Easton, Pennsylvania, where he was a member of Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity (Rho Chapter). In his later life, Simon was a member of the board of trustees from 1972 to 1973.

==Career==
Simon began his career with Union Securities in 1952. He later served as vice president of Weeden &amp; Co. before being named senior partner in charge of the government and municipal bonds at Salomon Brothers, where he was a member of the firm&#x27;s seven-man executive committee.

===Federal government service===

At the time of his nomination as Treasury Secretary, Simon was serving as Deputy Secretary of the Treasury, a post he held since January 22, 1973. As Deputy Secretary, Simon supervised the Nixon administration&#x27;s program to restructure and improve U.S. financial institutions. Beginning December 4, 1973, he served as the first administrator of the Federal Energy Office, and simultaneously launched and administered the Federal Energy Administration at the height of the oil embargo. As such he became known as the high-profile &quot;Energy Czar&quot;, and represented a revitalization of the &quot;czar&quot; term in U.S. politics. He chaired the President&#x27;s Oil Policy Committee and was instrumental in revising the mandatory oil import program in April 1973. Simon was a member of the President&#x27;s Energy Resources Council and continued to have major responsibility for coordinating both domestic and international energy policy.

In August 1974, only three months after Simon became U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, President Nixon resigned. President Gerald Ford, Nixon&#x27;s successor, asked Simon to continue serving as Treasury Secretary, and Ford later appointed him chairman of the Economic Policy Board and chief spokesman for the Ford administration on economic issues.

On April 8, 1975, President Ford also named him chairman of the newly created East-West Foreign Trade Board, established under the authority of the Trade Act of 1974.

In 1977, Simon received the Alexander Hamilton Award, the Treasury Department&#x27;s highest honor. In 1976, while serving as Secretary of the Treasury, President Anwar Sadat of Egypt presented Simon with the Collar of the Republic/Order of the Nile. Simon&#x27;s term as Secretary of the Treasury ended on January 20, 1977.

As Treasury Secretary, Simon claimed to support free markets and to spurn government policies that either subsidized or penalized businesses. In Simon&#x27;s own words:

Throughout the last century the attachment of businessmen to free enterprise has weakened dramatically as they discovered they could demand – and receive – short-range advantages from the state ... I watched with incredulity as businessmen ran to the government in every crisis, whining for handouts or protection from the very competition that has made this system so productive.

===Private sector career===
Simon attempted to purchase controlling interest in the Baltimore Orioles from Jerold Hoffberger for $12 million, but it aroused fears that he was going to move the franchise to Washington, D.C. Negotiations which began in the summer of 1978 ended when he withdrew his offer on February 5, 1979. He bitterly complained, &quot;Mr. Hoffberger wants to play both ends against the middle. Well, he can forget this end. I think at this point and at this time the game is over. He has damaged the merchandise and acted in bad faith. I think I&#x27;ve been played dirty pool everywhere to Sunday.&quot; The Orioles were acquired at the same price six months later on August 2 by Edward Bennett Williams who had represented Simon in those negotiations.

Simon was a pioneer of the leveraged buyout (LBO) in the 1980s. Following government service, Simon was a Vice Chairman at Blyth Eastman Dillon for three years, He and his partner, then co-founded with Ray Chambers, a tax accountant, Wesray Capital Corporation (Simon contributing the &quot;Wes&quot; and Chambers contributing the &quot;ray&quot; based on his initials), an LBO firm that bought and sold, among others, the Gibson Greeting Card Company, Anchor Glass, and the Simmons Mattress Company, typically investing tiny fractions of their own money and including significant debt to complete the purchase from prior shareholders, and then selling the companies whole or piecemeal after making changes that &quot;often included job cutbacks and other short-term cost-reduction measures.&quot;. In 1982, Wesray invested approximately $1 million in equity capital (with Simon contributing $330,000) and borrowed another $79 million to take private a Cincinnati-based greeting card company, Gibson Greetings, for $80 million. Eighteen months later, the company was taken public again, with a value of $290 million, and Simon&#x27;s $330,000 investment was worth $66 million.

In 1984, he launched WSGP International, which concentrated on investments in real estate and financial service organizations in the western United States and on the Pacific Rim. In 1988, together with sons William E. Simon Jr. and J. Peter Simon, he founded William E. Simon &amp; Sons, a global merchant bank with offices in New Jersey, Los Angeles, and Hong Kong. The firm is now extensively involved in providing venture capital. In 1990, he partnered with several investors to form Catterton-Simon Partners, a private equity firm focused on beverages and other consumer products, which today is known as Catterton Partners.

In the Anchor Glass case, Simon made millions more through deals with the company wherein the company leased its land, buildings, and equipment from Simon. Wesray also received banking fees for handling the subsequent purchase by Anchor of Midland Glass Company. Anchor Glass also bought casualty, liability, employee health and benefit insurance from a brokerage firm partially owned by Simon. The Anchor Glass corporate headquarters in Tampa was leased from Simon. Anchor Glass later admitted in an SEC filing, that &quot;these arrangements ... were not the result of arm&#x27;s length bargaining ... [and] were not ... favorable to the company&quot;. Anchor Glass was finally bought by a Mexican company, Vitro, S.A.

Simmons Mattress Company, a company founded in 1886, was bought by Wesray and partners bought in 1986 for $120 million and sold it in 1989 for $241 million.

By the late 1980s, Forbes magazine was estimating Simon&#x27;s wealth at $300 million.

During his business career, Simon served on the boards of over thirty companies including Xerox, Citibank, Halliburton, Dart &amp; Kraft, and United Technologies.

In 2017, William E. Simon &amp; Sons merged with Massy Quick &amp; Company in an all-equity transaction.

===Non-profit positions===
Simon was an active member of the United States Olympic Committee, serving as treasurer from 1977 to 1981 and as president from 1981 to 1985, where he oversaw the 1984 Winter Olympics in Sarajevo and the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. He chaired the U.S. Olympic Foundation, created with the profits of the Los Angeles games, from 1985 through 1997, and was inducted into the U.S. Olympic Hall of Fame in 1991. An additional athletics-related honor came on October 11, 1975, when Simon threw out the first pitch of the 1975 World Series at Boston&#x27;s Fenway Park on behalf of President Ford.

Simon received numerous awards during his career in sports. Among them are the Olympic Torch, issued by the U.S. Olympic Committee, and the Olympic Order, issued by the International Olympic Committee. Simon served as an officer or on the board of the Jesse Owens Foundation, the Basketball Hall of Fame, the National Tennis Foundation and Hall of Fame, the U.S. Amateur Boxing Foundation, the Women&#x27;s Sports Foundation, and the World Cup &#x27;94 organizing and executive committees.

==Personal life==
Simon was a resident of Harding Township, New Jersey. The superyacht &quot;Itasca&quot; was owned by Simon; it was the first such yacht to pass through the Northwest Passage, followed by a visit to Antarctica.

He was married first to Carol Girard in 1950. William and Carol Simon had two sons and five daughters (Bill, J. Peter, Mary Beth, Carol Leigh, Aimee, Julie Ann, and Johanna) and 27 grandchildren. She died in 1995. Simon married his second wife, Tonia Adams Donnelley, in 1996.

==Death==
Simon died on June 3, 2000, at age 72, in Santa Barbara, California, from complications of pulmonary fibrosis. He is interred at Laurel Grove Memorial Park in Totowa, New Jersey. In 2002, one of his sons, Bill Simon, was the Republican nominee for governor of California. A daughter, Mary Beth Simon, was married to Dana Streep, brother of actress Meryl Streep.

==Legacy==
At the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, Simon established the William E. Simon Center for the Professional Military Ethic and at the U.S. Air Force Academy, he established the William E. Simon Center for Strategic Studies and a Simon professorship.

In 1976, Simon received the U.S. Senator John Heinz Award, named for former U.S. Senator John Heinz, for the &quot;Greatest Public Service by an Elected or Appointed Official&quot;, an award given out annually by Jefferson Awards.

In 1978, Simon and Irving Kristol founded The Institute For Education Affairs, which merged with the Madison Center to become the Madison Center for Educational Affairs in 1990.

Simon served as president of the John M. Olin Foundation and as trustee of The John Templeton Foundation. He has also served on the boards of many of the nation&#x27;s premier think tanks, including The Heritage Foundation and the Hoover Institution. He was the author of two best-selling books, &quot;A Time for Truth&quot; in 1978 (ghostwritten by libertarian author Edith Efron) and &quot;A Time for Action&quot; in 1980.

In 1986, in recognition of his leadership in business, finance, and public service, the Graduate School of Management at the University of Rochester was renamed the William E. Simon Graduate School of Business Administration. The same year, Simon received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.

On October 26, 2007, a profile on Simon&#x27;s son William Simon Jr. in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; described Simon Sr. as &quot;a legendary architect of the modern conservative movement&quot; but also describes him as being &quot;legendarily mean.&quot; The profile quotes Simon Sr.&#x27;s friend, Edwin Feulner, president of The Heritage Foundation, who described Simon Sr. as &quot;a mean, nasty, tough bond trader who took no BS from anyone.&quot; It relates as an example of this aspect of his character that Simon Sr. &quot;would awaken his children on weekend mornings by dousing their heads with buckets of cold water.&quot; &quot;The Washington Post&quot;&#x27;s profile of Simon Jr. analysizes the lasting impact of Watergate on Simon Sr. this way: 
 ... Simon [Sr.] came away from the experience of Watergate with a disgust for the partisan character of the affair, and the capital. The experience of [Nixon&#x27;s] impeachment convinced him [...] not that partisanship was necessarily poisonous, but that his opponents were far better at partisanship than his side was. [...] Simon would spend the remainder of his life helping to redress the balance ...

Since 2001, the William E. Simon Prize for Philanthropic Leadership has been awarded to distinguished living donors, including John T. Walton, John Templeton, and Phil Anschutz.

In 2004, the Intercollegiate Studies Institute dedicated a $40,000 cash prize in honor of Secretary Simon. Each year since, the William E. Simon Fellowship for Noble Purpose has been awarded to a college senior desiring to live a life dedicated to serving humanity.

=== William E. Simon Scholarship Fund ===

Simon Scholarship Fund provides financial assistance for academically highly qualified students of the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, &quot;Angelicum&quot; who live in Rome who would otherwise lack the resources to cover their educational expenses.

<text>Simon Business School (formerly known as the William E. Simon Graduate School of Business Administration) is the business school of the University of Rochester. It is located on the university&#x27;s River Campus in Rochester, New York. It was renamed in 1986 after William E. Simon (1927–2000), the 63rd United States Secretary of the Treasury. The school&#x27;s current dean is Sevin Yeltekin.

Simon Business School offers full-time, part-time, and executive Master of Business Administration (MBA) programs (based in either Rochester or Switzerland), as well as Master of Science (MS) and Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) programs.

==History==
The University of Rochester started as a small business program in 1958, and awarded its first MBA degree in 1962, but the School&#x27;s impact in the business world can be traced to a later decision by then University President W. Allen Wallis to create a first-class business school in Rochester. In 1964, he was recruited as dean. 

William H. Meckling - who would remain dean for 19 years - was a noted economist known for his analysis and leadership in support of an all-volunteer U.S. armed service. As dean, he committed the school to an economics-based approach to problem solving, recruited a faculty for researches at school, initiated new finance and accounting journals that incorporated economics, eliminated boundaries between functional departments, and transformed what had been a small, undergraduate and evening business school into a graduate business program.

As a result of work by Meckling and Michael C. Jensen - one of the faculty members he recruited - and other faculty members, the school became known for its contributions to the areas of finance, accounting, and organizational theory. The faculty&#x27;s contributions, in turn, helped shape the research agenda of a generation of business scholars around the world, influencing teaching in graduate business programs and changing how many companies and executives in the US and abroad conduct business.

In 1986, another milestone in the school&#x27;s history occurred when the school was renamed to the &quot;William E. Simon Graduate School of Business Administration&quot;. William E. Simon, a financial entrepreneur and former U.S. Treasury Secretary, believed in the principles and ideals of the school. He offered his name and an enduring financial commitment to the school&#x27;s continued success. He chaired the Executive Advisory Committee from its inception in 1986 until his death in June 2000.

Today, Sevin Yeltekin, who succeeded Andrew Ainslie in 2020, serves as dean of Simon Business School. Yeltekin, the first woman to lead the Simon School, previously served as senior associate dean and professor at Carnegie Mellon’s Tepper School of Business.

==MBA programs==
===Full-time MBA program===
The Full-Time Master of Business Administration (MBA) program is two-year in duration and begins in August. With an average full-time MBA enrollment of 100 students per class, 

=== Rankings ===
In 2023, the school was ranked 25th in the U.S. by Bloomberg Businessweek. The MBA program also ranked 27th on the U.S. News &amp; World Report&#x27;s 2024 ranking of best graduate-level business schools. QS World University Rankings ranked Simon&#x27;s MBA program as #36 in the United States.

===Executive MBA programs===
Simon&#x27;s Executive MBA program is offered on the Rochester campus (as well as in Bern, Switzerland), in conjunction with the Institut für Finanzmanagement at the Universität Bern. The Bern program is equivalent to the Rochester program and is taught by Simon School faculty and European scholars. Students are typically sponsored by their organizations and earn a University of Rochester degree. Like Rochester&#x27;s Executive MBA students, the students of the Rochester-Bern Executive MBA program in Switzerland come from a wide variety of countries and cultures. Bern students spend their four-week summer term in Rochester studying alongside American students.

==MS programs==
Simon Master of Science (MS) programs generally only require one year of full-time study. Students also have the opportunity to take some classes with MBA candidates, work on multicultural teams, and participate in a variety of extracurricular activities. The school offers MS programs in accountancy, business analytics, finance, health care management, management, marketing analytics, and medical management.

The University of Rochester&#x27;s Hajim School of Engineering and Applied Sciences also offers a Master of Technical Entrepreneurship and Management (T.E.A.M.) program, with some courses completed at Simon Business School.

==MS in Health Care Management in New York City==
The MS in Health Care Management curriculum is designed for working professionals who want to develop the skills to better evaluate their organizations, optimize care delivery, and prepare for the next round of fundamental industry change.

Simon Business School&#x27;s NYC home is located in the Tribeca area of lower Manhattan. 

==PhD program==
Introduced in 1965, Simon Business School offers a PhD programs with a variety of concentrations.

The most common majors are Accounting, Finance, Marketing, Computer Information Systems, and Operations Management. Regardless of the major, all students&#x27; first-year studies include a core program designed to build a firm foundation of mathematics, statistics, and economics. While the majority of the courses are taken in common by all the incoming students, there is some specialization. This specialization gets more specific in the second year when the students concentrate on their major and minor fields of study.

<text>The family Threskiornithidae includes 36 species of large wading birds. The family has been traditionally classified into two subfamilies, the [[ibis]]es and the [[spoonbill]]s; however recent genetic studies have cast doubt on this arrangement, and have found the spoonbills to be nested within the Old World ibises, and the New World ibises as an early offshoot.

==Taxonomy==
The family Threskiornithidae was formerly known as Plataleidae. The spoonbills and ibises were once thought to be related to other groups of long-legged wading birds in the order Ciconiiformes. A recent study found that they are members of the order Pelecaniformes. In response to these findings, the International Ornithological Congress (IOC) recently reclassified Threskiornithidae and their sister taxa Ardeidae under the order Pelecaniformes instead of the previous order of Ciconiiformes. Whether the two subfamilies are reciprocally monophyletic is an open question. The South American Checklist Committee&#x27;s entry for the Threskiornithidae includes the following comment &quot;Two subfamilies are traditionally (e.g., Matheu &amp; del Hoyo 1992) recognized: Threskiornithinae for ibises and Plataleinae for spoonbills; because the main distinction has to do with bill shape, additional information, especially genetic, is required to recognize a major, deep split in the family.&quot;

A study of mitochondrial DNA of the spoonbills plus the sacred and scarlet ibises found that the spoonbills formed a clade with old world genus &quot;Threskiornis&quot;, with &quot;Nipponia nippon&quot; and &quot;Eudocimus&quot; as progressively earlier offshoots and more distant relatives, and hence casts doubt on the arrangement of the family into ibis and spoonbill subfamilies. Subsequent studies have supported these findings, the spoonbills forming a monophyletic clade within the &quot;widespread&quot; clade of ibises, including &quot;Plegadis&quot; and &quot;Threskiornis&quot;, while the &quot;new World Endemic&quot; clade is formed by the genera restricted to the Americas such as &quot;Eudocimus&quot; and &quot;Theristicus&quot;.

Ibises are a rather old group, with well-preserved definitive fossils known as far back as the Eocene (&quot;Rhynchaeites&quot;), and potential members dating as far back as the Late Paleocene (&quot;Dakotornis&quot;).

==Description==
Members of the family have long, broad wings with 11 primary feathers and about 20 secondaries. They are strong fliers and, rather surprisingly, given their size and weight, very capable soarers. The body tends to be elongated, the neck more so, with rather long legs. The bill is also long, decurved in the case of the ibises, straight and distinctively flattened in the spoonbills. They are large birds, but mid-sized by the standards of their order, ranging from the dwarf olive ibis (&quot;Bostrychia bocagei&quot;), at and , to the giant ibis (&quot;Thaumatibis gigantea&quot;), at and .

==Distribution and ecology==
They are distributed almost worldwide, being found near almost any area of standing or slow-flowing fresh or brackish water. Ibises are also found in drier areas, including landfills.

The Llanos are notable in that these wetland plains support seven species of ibis in the one region.

All ibises are diurnal; spending the day feeding on a wide range of invertebrates and small vertebrates: ibises by probing in soft earth or mud, spoonbills by swinging the bill from side to side in shallow water. At night, they roost in trees near water. They are gregarious, feeding, roosting, and flying together, often in formation.

Nesting is colonial in ibises, more often in small groups or singly in spoonbills, nearly always in trees overhanging water, but sometimes on islands or small islands in swamps. Generally, the female builds a large structure out of reeds and sticks brought by the male. Typical clutch size is two to five; hatching is asynchronic. Both sexes incubate in shifts, and after hatching feed the young by partial regurgitation. Two or three weeks after hatching, the young no longer need to be brooded continuously and may leave the nest, often forming creches but returning to be fed by the parents.

<text>Freedom of Choice (stylized as F R E E D O M O F C H O I C E) is the third studio album by the American new wave band Devo, released in May 1980 on Warner Bros. Records. The album contained their biggest hit, &quot;Whip It&quot;, which hit No. 8 and No. 14 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Club Play Singles and Pop Singles charts, respectively. &quot;Freedom of Choice&quot; peaked at No. 22 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Pop Albums chart.

==Background==
Devo had amassed a sizeable following after the release of their first two studio albums with Warner Bros. However, after the band&#x27;s second album &quot;Duty Now for the Future&quot; (1979) was not as well received, the label presented the band with a &quot;make or break&quot; ultimatum for their forthcoming third album. Warner Bros. told the band that if sales did not increase with the new album&#x27;s release, the label would terminate their contract. Devo frontman Mark Mothersbaugh later contended that Warner Bros. threatened the band&#x27;s manager Elliot Roberts with litigation if Devo did not achieve chart success with the album.

While the material on Devo&#x27;s first two albums mostly consisted of old songs written between 1974 and 1977, the band decided to compose all new material for the upcoming crucial third album. The songs were written after the band had completed their second world tour.

The creation of &quot;Freedom of Choice&quot; saw the band now living in Los Angeles and choosing to start from scratch. The band rented a space on Wilcox Avenue in Hollywood that had been converted from old abandoned storefronts in which they would compose and rehearse new material.

==Composition==
&quot;Freedom of Choice&quot; was informed by bassist Gerald Casale&#x27;s and guitarist Bob Mothersbaugh&#x27;s mutual love of R&amp;B music. The band decided that heading in a more funk-oriented direction with their new songs would satisfy both themselves and Warner Bros. DJ Pangburn of &quot;Sound on Sound&quot; later observed that the album &quot;is far from R&amp;B, although it&#x27;s funky and moves in a way that its two predecessors do not.&quot; The band members all fully committed to the new artistic direction and were later in agreement that it was their best album, strongest set of songs and most enjoyable experience in the studio, due to their positive working relationship. However, Casale has said that the band&#x27;s fanbase were very critical of this stylistic departure.

The songs on &quot;Freedom of Choice&quot; were more mainstream and accessible than its two predecessors. Casale recalled that &quot;This was a self-imposed challenge. Can we write songs? Because we always thought that was a little bit beneath [who] Devo was, but in the end, not really. You have to be able to deliver.&quot; Author Evie Nagy recounted that Mark Mothersbaugh claimed he was incapable of intentionally writing a hit song. Casale added that &quot;We were mutating ourselves on purpose, with that purpose being to make something bolder and funkier, still with guitars and energy, and still maintain the energy of our stage show&quot;.

===Songs===
The lyrics of &quot;Whip It&quot; were originally written by Casale in one night &quot;as an imitation of Thomas Pynchon&#x27;s parodies in his book &quot;Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow&quot;&quot;. Mark Mothersbaugh also viewed it as a Dale Carnegie-esque inspirational song for then-U.S. President Jimmy Carter. The music originated as four different demo pieces, largely written by Mark Mothersbaugh and later assembled and arranged by Casale. The riff was based on Roy Orbison&#x27;s &quot;Oh, Pretty Woman&quot;.

The lyrics of the title track were written by Casale about the United States&#x27; conservative political shift preceding the election of Ronald Reagan.

&quot;Gates of Steel&quot; was written after sessions concluded for the band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Q. Are We Not Men? A: We Are Devo!&quot; (1978), and began as an instrumental demo recorded by Mark Mothersbaugh with Debbie Smith and Sue Schmidt of the band Chi-Pig. Casale liked the progression and, during rehearsals for &quot;Freedom of Choice&quot;, melded it with some standalone lyrics he had written. &quot;Cold War&quot; was a rare collaboration between Casale and Bob Mothersbaugh, developed after hours in the studio circa November 1979.

&quot;That&#x27;s Pep!&quot; features lyrics taken from the poem &quot;Pep&quot; by Grace G. Bostwick, which was published in &quot;The American Magazine&quot; in 1919, prior to U.S. copyright law. The music was written by Mark Mothersbaugh and, according to Nagy, is &quot;outside any of the structure [or] lexicon of sounds and beats of rock &amp; roll&quot;, despite its incorporation of a Bo Diddley beat. Nagy compares &quot;Ton o&#x27; Luv&quot; to &quot;Whip It&quot; in that it is a &quot;parody of cloying American optimism that is blind to the industrial realities around it.&quot;

==Production==
Devo had not enjoyed the experience of working with their previous producer, Ken Scott, and after the band&#x27;s sales decreased with the resulting album, &quot;Duty Now for the Future&quot;, they decided to find a new producer. Mark Mothersbaugh later stated that, while the band admired Bootsy Collins, Prince and Motown, they had difficulty figuring out how to reflect those influences in their own music. The band decided to approach electronic music pioneer Robert Margouleff, due to his work with Stevie Wonder and Tonto&#x27;s Expanding Head Band (featuring the TONTO synthesizer), as well as in underground cinema. Mark Mothersbaugh recalled that Margouleff satisfied both his love of technology and Casale&#x27;s interest in achieving a more radio-friendly sound. Pangburn observed that, &quot;with Margouleff at the mixing desk, Devo produced a catchy synth pop album that proved to be their mainstream breakthrough.&quot;

The album was demoed at Modern Music Recording Studio in 1980, and these tracks were later released on the compilation album &quot;Recombo DNA&quot; in 2000. This demo version lacks &quot;It&#x27;s Not Right&quot;, &quot;Ton o&#x27; Luv&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t You Know&quot; and &quot;Freedom of Choice&quot;, but it includes demos of the &quot;Whip It&quot; B-side &quot;Turn Around&quot; and three unreleased tracks (&quot;Luv &amp; Such&quot;, &quot;Time Bomb&quot; and &quot;Make Me Move&quot;). The lyrics of &quot;Luv &amp; Such&quot; were later rewritten and the song became &quot;Mr. B&#x27;s Ballroom&quot;. In 2009, another demo titled &quot;Red Shark&quot; surfaced, an early version of &quot;It&#x27;s Not Right&quot; with alternate lyrics that was offered as a download-only track for fans who purchased tickets to the &quot;Freedom of Choice&quot; album concerts.

Margouleff initially met the band&#x27;s proposal with trepidation but was convinced after hearing these demos. He had been looking for an interesting project to pursue, now that his work with Wonder had concluded, and knew the band aligned with his experiences in electronic music. He also cited Devo&#x27;s &quot;strong political message&quot; as another motivating factor for him to work with the band.

Margouleff frequently visited the band&#x27;s rehearsal sessions and Mark Mothersbaugh found him to be &quot;interested, engaged and engaging&quot; as well as &quot;super optimistic&quot;, likening him to the band&#x27;s General Boy character. Margouleff recalled that Devo rehearsed the material for several weeks and continued to write in the studio even after the proper album sessions began.

==Recording==
&quot;Freedom of Choice&quot; was recorded and mixed in six weeks at the Record Plant in Los Angeles using a 24-track machine, with Margouleff co-producing the sessions with the band and co-engineering with Howard Seigel. Bass, drums and guitars were all recorded live together, while synths and vocals were overdubbed later. Bob Mothersbaugh recalled that Margouleff &quot;created a good atmosphere to play live&quot;. Margouleff also encouraged the band to pursue a more raw production sound, stripping away effects and layers. He experimented with different mic placements and recording methods for every track and left the tapes constantly rolling in the hopes of capturing something spontaneous.

Margouleff paid particular focus to the sound of the rhythm section:

Casale opted to use a Moog bass synthesizer on the album, inspired by Margouleff&#x27;s work with Wonder, and Margouleff suggested he use the same amplifier he had used in rehearsals in order to get the same &quot;thick&quot; sound as the band&#x27;s demo sessions. Other synthesizers used on the album include a Minimoog, a Moog Liberation, an ElectroComp 500 (for the whip crack sounds on &quot;Whip It&quot;) and a custom-made Moog called a &quot;Devobox&quot;. Music historian Andy Zax noted that, on &quot;Freedom of Choice&quot;, &quot;synthesizers had now been upgraded to a starring role, while an increasingly sophisticated pop sensibility infiltrated the group&#x27;s new songs.&quot;

Much like Margouleff&#x27;s work with Wonder, the album was mixed drily, and Margouleff recalled, &quot;I was always striving to get the band as close as possible, falling off the proscenium arch and into the audience, so that the listeners would feel like they&#x27;re moving inside the band.&quot;

==Artwork and title==
The cover features the band wearing silver suits made of Naugahyde, designed by Casale and inspired by suits worn by Black R&amp;B groups of the 1950s. The band&#x27;s red &quot;energy dome&quot; hats were inspired by Art Deco light fixtures Casale remembered from the grade school he had attended, which was built in the 1920s. The hats were designed by Brent Scrivner and fashioned from vacuform ABS white plastic, spray-painted with Chinese red lacquer. The band also wore black boat neck shirts, which were popular with beach-goers in the 1960s.

The title &quot;Freedom of Choice&quot; was chosen because Mark Mothersbaugh and Casale had been fond of that track. Other proposed titles for the album included &quot;Time for Devo&quot; and &quot;You R It&quot;.

==Promotion==
&quot;Freedom of Choice&quot; was released on May 16, 1980.

&quot;Girl U Want&quot; was the initial single chosen by Warner Bros., and Nagy theorized that its similar feel to the Knack&#x27;s &quot;My Sharona&quot; made the label think it had commercial potential. The single failed to chart, and after the band began their concert tour, Florida record promoter Kal Rudman urged southeastern DJs to play &quot;Whip It&quot;, whose popularity then spread to New York and the rest of the U.S., including gay dance clubs. &quot;Whip It&quot; was formally released as a single on August 13, 1980, and became a genuine hit, peaking at No. 14 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 for the week of November 15, 1980. Warner Bros. then gave the band an infusion of cash to make a promo video for the song. Despite its success, Casale later expressed that the band had not viewed the song any differently than any other song on the record.

The video for &quot;Whip It&quot; was based on a 1962 issue of &quot;Dude&quot; magazine that Mark Mothersbaugh had found in an antique store, which contained a story about a dude ranch where the owner would whip his wife&#x27;s clothes off. The video also played on radio programmers&#x27; popular misconception that the song was about masturbation and sadomasochism. It was shot in Devo&#x27;s rehearsal studio for $15,000.

Promo videos were then shot for both &quot;Freedom of Choice&quot; and &quot;Girl U Want&quot;, both of which featured skateboarders from Santa Monica and their friends. The former featured professional skateboarders Tony Alva and Stacy Peralta. Some of the males who appeared in the latter video were dressed in drag. Casale had wanted Warner Bros. to select &quot;Freedom of Choice&quot; as the next single but the label passed on it. Instead, Warner Bros. chose to continue promoting &quot;Whip It&quot; and have the band focus on completing their next album, &quot;New Traditionalists&quot;, which they had already begun recording by January 1981.

Devo made an appearance on &quot;The Merv Griffin Show&quot; and three appearances on the show &quot;Fridays&quot;. A planned appearance on &quot;The Midnight Special&quot; in 1981 was canceled when host Lily Tomlin saw the video for &quot;Whip It&quot; and objected to the content.

The press kit for the album included an insert called &quot;Devo Meets the Press&quot;, which featured the band giving largely facetious answers to frequently asked questions. The band appeared in an ad campaign for the Moog Liberation synthesizer, which they also used in promo shots at the time.

==Reception==
===Commercial===
&quot;Freedom of Choice&quot; became Devo&#x27;s commercial breakthrough, although its success would not be replicated on subsequent records. The album was the band&#x27;s biggest seller and is their most successful album to date. It peaked at No. 22 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, while &quot;Whip It&quot; peaked at No. 14 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and No. 8 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Dance Club Songs chart. Both the album and &quot;Whip It&quot; single sold over a million copies. The album was awarded platinum status by the Recording Industry Association of America on May 13, 1986.

===Critical===
In a 1981 review, Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; quipped that &quot;if they ever teach a rhythm box to get funky, a Mothersbaugh will be there to plug it in.&quot; Writing in &quot;Trouser Press&quot;, critics Scott Isler and Ira Robbins described the album as &quot;the band&#x27;s most evocative pairing of words and music&quot;. In a retrospective review for AllMusic, Steve Huey praised the album, calling it &quot;their most cohesive, consistent material to date&quot;.

&quot;Record World&quot; described a live version of &quot;Gates of Steel&quot; saying that &quot;its wall-of-sound guitar grind and Mark Mothersbaugh&#x27;s vocal frenzy should satisfy AOR listeners.&quot;

==Tour==
For the tour, Devo donned their red energy domes, as well as white paper jumpsuits sprayed with gray fabric paint, adorned with red gaffer tape as a shoulder piece and waistband. The stage featured five light panels at the back which were fashioned from plywood with metal frames, and for the second part of the show, the panels were laid down, lit from underneath and used as a stage. The tour included several dates in Japan, including Osaka, Tokyo, Fukuoka and Sendai. Some performances featured the band wearing &quot;goodwill outfits&quot;, including white short-sleeved shirts with shoulder pads and black trim, and white pants with black stripes.

The tour was captured on several different commercial releases. The first was a promotional LP of an almost complete gig from August 16 at the Warfield Theatre in San Francisco, recorded for the &quot;King Biscuit Flower Hour&quot; radio show and issued as part of the ongoing &quot;Warner Bros. Music Show&quot; series. Shortly thereafter, six tracks from the album appeared as the &quot;DEV-O Live&quot; mini-album, and in 2000, Rhino Handmade issued a limited edition CD of &quot;DEV-O Live&quot;, containing both the mini-album and the LP on one disc. In 2005, a performance from the Phoenix Theater in Petaluma, California from the following night was issued as &quot;Devo Live 1980&quot; in DualDisc format, with one side containing the show in DVD format and the other containing an edited version of the show&#x27;s audio in CD format.

The evening show at Raincross Square in Riverside, California on August 19 was cancelled, due to a light bank malfunctioning during the afternoon show, which led ticket holders to riot. However, the show was made up a week later, on August 25.

Following the success of the &quot;Whip It&quot; single, concerts in the middle of the band&#x27;s tour had to be rescheduled to accommodate larger venues. Gerald Casale later recalled, &quot;We were in the middle of a small club tour – maximum 900 seats – and within two weeks we had to rebook everything for 3,000-5000-seat places because &#x27;Whip It&#x27; became so big, so fast.&quot; This included a three-night run at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium.

==Legacy==
On September 16, 2009, Warner Bros. and Devo announced vinyl and deluxe CD re-releases of both &quot;Q: Are We Not Men? A: We Are Devo!&quot; and &quot;Freedom of Choice&quot;, as well as a tour in which they would perform both albums on back-to-back nights in selected cities. On December 22, 2009, the &quot;Ultra Devo-Lux Ltd. Edition&quot; box set was released, which featured the remastered versions of &quot;Q: Are We Not Men?&quot; and &quot;Freedom of Choice&quot; with bonus tracks, a DVD of the 2009 &quot;Q: Are We Not Men?&quot; HMV Forum concert, a DVD of music videos, a 7-inch single and a poster.

In 2008, Richard Buskin of &quot;Sound on Sound&quot; observed that &quot;Devo and Robert Margouleff crafted a record that was not only more musically cohesive than the first two albums, but also boasted a greater level of sophistication, as the synthesizers blended with guitars to create a more dehumanised yet less dissonant sound.&quot; In 2015, David Chiu of PopMatters commented on &quot;Whip It&quot;&#x27;s &quot;surrealist and now-iconic video that was a staple of MTV during the then-fledging channel&#x27;s early years&quot;. He added, &quot;The fact that &quot;The Simpsons&quot; even paid homage to both the song and the video in an episode demonstrates how much &#x27;Whip It&#x27; has transcended pop culture.&quot; Also that year, Nagy wrote a book on the making of the album for the 33⅓ series, including interviews with Casale and Mark and Bob Mothersbaugh, a song by song breakdown and a foreword by Fred Armisen.

<doc id="210395" wikidata="Q212712" url="?curid=210395" title="Liberal International">
<text>Liberal International (LI or Libintern) is a worldwide organization of liberal political parties. The political international was founded in Oxford in 1947 and has become the pre-eminent network for liberal and progressive democratic parties aiming to strengthen liberalism and democratic values around the world. Its headquarters are within the National Liberal Club. The Oxford Manifesto describes the basic political principles of the Liberal International, which is currently made up of 111 parties and organizations.

== Aims ==
The Liberal International Constitution (2005) gives its purposes as: The principles that unite member parties from Africa, America, Asia and Europe are respect for human rights, free and fair elections and multi-party democracy, social justice, tolerance, market economy, free trade, environmental sustainability and a strong sense of international solidarity.

The aims of Liberal International are also set out in a series of seven manifestos, written between 1946 and 1997, and are furthered by a variety of bodies including a near-yearly conference for liberal parties and individuals from around the world.

== Bureau ==
The bureau of Liberal International is elected every 18 months by the delegates of the congress.

Former Presidents include Hans Van Baalen MEP, John, Lord Alderdice, Dutch politician and former European Commissioner Frits Bolkestein, German politician Otto Graf Lambsdorff, and Spain&#x27;s first democratically elected prime minister after Francoist Spain, Adolfo Suárez. The 14th president of Liberal International was Hakima el Haite of the Mouvement Populaire (Morocco), is a former Minister of Environment, UN climate champion, and climate scientist. Madam El Haite succeeded Dr Juli Minoves, formerly Andorra&#x27;s foreign minister and representative to the United Nations.

The secretary-general of Liberal International is Gordon Mackay, a former Member of the National Assembly of South Africa. Other members of the bureau include Deputy President Prof. Karl-Heinz Paque; and Vice Presidents Cellou Dalein Diallo (Guinea), Kitty Monterrey (Nicaragua), Abir al-Sahlani (Sweden), Kiat Sittheamorn (Thailand) and Robert Woodthorpe Browne (United Kingdom). There are two elected treasurers, Judith Pallares MP (Andorra) and Minister Omar Youm (Senegal).

== Awards ==
Liberal International awards prizes to individuals in the areas of human rights and liberalism.

Prize for Freedom:

The Liberal International Prize for Freedom is LI&#x27;s most prestigious human rights award. Conveyed annually since 1984 to an individual of liberal conviction who has made outstanding efforts for the defence of freedom and human rights, recipients include Maria Corina Machado of Venezuela, Senator Leila de Lima of the Philippines, Raif Badawi of Saudi Arabia, Waris Dirie of Somalia and Václav Havel of Czechoslovakia and the Czech Republic.

Medal of Liberalism:

The Liberal International Medal of Liberalism is awarded to individuals who have worked to advance liberal values on a local, national and international level. Recipients include President Alassane Ouattara of Ivory Coast, Prime Minister Xavier Bettel of Luxembourg, President Tsai Ing-wen of Taiwan and Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe leader Sir Graham Watson of the United Kingdom.

== Publications ==
The &quot;LI Human Rights Bulletin&quot; is published three times per year and consists of opinion articles, video interviews and digest of the work of the LI human rights committee.

Thematic publications are published online and in print on an &quot;ad hoc&quot; basis. Recent texts have offered a liberal perspective on issues ranging from freedom of belief to the responsibility to protect.

== History ==
=== Before establishment ===
Because inter-war International Entente of Radical and Similar Democratic Parties ceased to operate in the beginning of the World War II, on 16 June 1946 representatives of the Liberal Party of Belgium, British Liberal Party, French Republican, Radical and Radical-Socialist Party, Danish Social Liberal Party, Freedom Party of the Netherlands, Free Democratic Party of Switzerland, People&#x27;s Party of Sweden, Italian Liberal Party and the representatives of Spanish Liberals in exile assembled in Brussels and adopted the Declaration of Brussels, which called for creation of world liberal organization.

=== Oxford Manifesto ===
The Oxford Manifesto, drawn up in April 1947 at Wadham College in Oxford by representatives from 19 liberal political parties from South Africa, Germany, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Cyprus, Spain, Estonia, United Kingdom, United States, Finland, France, Hungary, Italy, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, Czechoslovakia and Turkey is a document describing the basic political principles of the Liberal International. Creation of its main principles were led by Salvador de Madariaga.

The Oxford Manifesto was inspired by the ideas of William Beveridge and is regarded as one of the defining political documents of the 20th century.

Fifty years on, in 1997, Liberal International returned to Oxford and issued a supplement to the original manifesto, &quot;The Liberal Agenda for the 21st century&quot;, describing Liberal policies in greater detail. The second Oxford Manifesto was adopted by the 48th Congress of Liberal International, which was held on 27–30 November 1997 in the Oxford Town Hall. In 2017, the global federation marked its 70th anniversary with the adoption of the Andorra Liberal Manifesto for the twenty-first century (ALM). A three-year project across numerous continents initiated by then president Juli Minoves, the ALM embodied the widest consultation of views undertaken by Liberal International in order to compile a policy document.

== Organisation ==
===Presidents===
== Members ==
=== Incumbent heads of state and government ===
=== Full members ===

<doc id="210396" wikidata="Q2411730" url="?curid=210396" title="The Great Adventures of Slick Rick">
<text>The Great Adventures of Slick Rick is the debut studio album by hip hop recording artist Slick Rick, released on November 1, 1988.

It topped &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart for five nonconsecutive weeks and peaked at number 31 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

==Reception==

&quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; called &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Crazy&quot; &quot;one of the year&#x27;s most jolting, exciting pieces of music.&quot; The &quot;Orange County Register&quot; concluded that &quot;Rick&#x27;s goofy rap style makes him seem less a braggart than a beleaguered Everyman and, with its wickedly sharp production, &quot;The Great Adventures of Slick Rick&quot; sounds great.&quot;

In 1998, &quot;The Great Adventures of Slick Rick&quot; was selected as one of &quot;The Source&quot;″s &quot;100 Best Albums&quot;. The album was retrospectively awarded a perfect &quot;five-mic&quot; score by the magazine in 2002. In 2012, it was ranked at number 99 on &quot;Slant Magazine&quot;″s list of &quot;The 100 Best Albums of the 1980s&quot;. In VH1&#x27;s 2008 ranking of the &quot;100 Greatest Hip Hop Songs&quot;, the single &quot;Children&#x27;s Story&quot; placed at number 61.

Hip hop artist Nas cites &quot;The Great Adventures of Slick Rick&quot; as one of his favorite albums. In 2009, fellow rapper Busta Rhymes said of the album:

<text>Bemmel is a town in the eastern Netherlands, in the province of Gelderland. It is located in the Betuwe region, and falls under the municipality of Lingewaard. The town is situated between the major cities of Arnhem and Nijmegen, and is bordered by the Waal river in the south. Bemmel has a population of 12,161 (as of 1 January 2020).

==History==
The former municipality of Bemmel merged in 2001 with the former municipalities Huissen and Gendt. In 2003 this merged municipality was renamed Lingewaard. The municipal building of Lingewaard is located in Bemmel.

From 1990 to 2006, Bemmel was considerably expanded with three new housing estates: Klaverkamp, Klein Rome, and Essenpas. The hamlets of Doornik and De Pas are also included with Bemmel. The hamlet of Vossenpels is partly included with Bemmel and partly included with Lent; which became part of the municipality of Nijmegen in 1998.

==Landscape==

Bemmel is located within the catchment area of the rivers Waal and Linge. It contains mainly fertile soils of nutrient-rich river deposits. The area is well suited for horticulture; it features many greenhouses and orchards.

In the south of Bemmel (outside the dykes) lies Dutch rewilding area the Gelderse Poort, which is managed by Staatsbosbeheer. The area contains typical habitats of the Dutch riverscapes, including: kolks, riparian forests and grasslands. There is a mining company located in the area, which extracts sand and gravel out of the ground.
Along and through the most western part of Bemmel runs Park Lingezegen. This is a Dutch landscape park, located between the cities of Arnhem and Nijmegen. The most notable part of Park Lingezegen that runs through Bemmel is the estate of Doornik. It is an important area for rare Dutch meadow birds, including the grey partridge, yellowhammer, and Eurasian skylark.

==Annual festivals==
Notable annual festivals and events in Bemmel include:
* International Four Days Marches Nijmegen - A multiple day marching event in mid-July, which comes through Bemmel. Depending on the edition, it will be on the first or the fourth day.
* &quot;Bemmelse Dweildag&quot; - An international festival for marching bands in Bemmel, on the second Sunday in June.
* Horse Days of Bemmel (Dutch: &quot;Bemmelse Paardendagen&quot;) - The annual pony market and horserace of the town, around the second Sunday in August.

==Notable people==

Notable residents in Bemmel include: 
* Joop Puntman (1934–2013), Dutch ceramist and sculptor
* Cayfano Latupeirissa (born 1991), Dutch professional football player
* Jesse Schuurman (born 1998), Dutch professional football player

== Trivia ==
* Bemmel is often called &quot;Bemmely Hills&quot; by its younger residents. This nickname for the town is often used on social media and is probably derived from the name of the American city Beverly Hills.
* The alternative name of Bemmel during carnaval is: &quot;&#x27;t Kaokelnest&quot; (English: &quot;The Cackle Nest&quot;)

<doc id="210399" wikidata="Q335086" url="?curid=210399" title="Henry Briggs (mathematician)">
<text>Henry Briggs (1 February 1561 – 26 January 1630) was an English mathematician notable for changing the original logarithms invented by John Napier into common (base 10) logarithms, which are sometimes known as Briggsian logarithms in his honour. The specific algorithm for long division in modern use was introduced by Briggs 1600 AD.

Briggs was a committed Puritan and an influential professor in his time.

== Personal life ==

Briggs was born at Daisy Bank, Sowerby Bridge, near Halifax, in Yorkshire, England. After studying Latin and Greek at a local grammar school, he entered St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, in 1577, and graduated in 1581. In 1588, he was elected a Fellow of St John&#x27;s. In 1592, he was made reader of the physical lecture founded by Thomas Linacre; he also read some of the mathematical lectures. During this period, he took an interest in navigation and astronomy, collaborating with Edward Wright.

In 1596, he became first professor of geometry in the recently founded Gresham College, London, where he also taught astronomy and navigation. He lectured there for nearly 23 years, and made Gresham College a centre of English mathematics, from which he supported the new ideas of Johannes Kepler.

He was a friend of Christopher Heydon, a writer on astrology, though Briggs himself rejected astrology for religious reasons. He once called astrology, &quot;a mere system of groundless conceits&quot;.

At this time, Briggs obtained a copy of &quot;Mirifici Logarithmorum Canonis Descriptio&quot;, in which Napier introduced the idea of logarithms. It has also been suggested that he knew of the method outlined in &quot;Fundamentum Astronomiae&quot; published by the Swiss clockmaker Jost Bürgi, through John Dee. Napier&#x27;s formulation was awkward to work with, but the book fired Briggs&#x27; imagination – in his lectures at Gresham College he proposed the idea of base 10 logarithms in which the logarithm of 10 would be 1; and soon afterwards he wrote to the inventor on the subject. Briggs was active in many areas, and his advice in astronomy, surveying, navigation, and other activities like mining was frequently sought. Briggs in 1619 invested in the London Company, and he had two sons: Henry, who later emigrated to Virginia, and Thomas, who remained in England.

Briggs died on 26 January 1630, and was buried in the chapel of Merton College, Oxford. Dr Smith, in his &quot;Lives of the Gresham Professors&quot;, characterizes him as a man of great probity, a condemner of riches, and contented with his own station, preferring a studious retirement to all the splendid circumstances of life. The lunar crater Briggs is named in his honour.

== Mathematical contributions ==
In 1616 Briggs visited Napier at Edinburgh in order to discuss the suggested change to Napier&#x27;s logarithms. The following year he again visited for a similar purpose. During these conferences the alteration proposed by Briggs was agreed upon; and on his return from his second visit to Edinburgh, in 1617, he published the first chiliad of his logarithms, giving 14-digit common logarithms of the integers from 1 to 1000.

In 1619 he was appointed Savilian Professor of Geometry at the University of Oxford, and resigned his professorship of Gresham College in July 1620. Soon after his settlement at Oxford he was incorporated Master of Arts.

In 1622 he published a small tract on the &quot;Northwest Passage to the South Seas, through the Continent of Virginia and Hudson Bay&quot;. The tract is notorious today as the origin of the cartographic myth of the Island of California. In it Briggs stated he had seen a map that had been brought from Holland that showed the Island of California. The tract was republished three years later (1625) in Pvrchas His Pilgrimes (vol 3, p848).
In 1624 his &quot;Arithmetica Logarithmica&quot; was published, in folio, a work containing the logarithms of thirty thousand natural numbers to fourteen decimal places (1-20,000 and 90,001 to 100,000).
The remaining logarithms of the numbers 20,001 to 90,000 were later calculated by Adriaan Vlacq in his table of logarithms of the numbers 1 to 100,000 being accurate to 10 places. Alexander John Thompson published a table of logarithms of the numbers 1 to 100,000 accurate to 20 places in 1952. Briggs was one of the first to use finite-difference methods to compute tables of functions.
He also completed a table of logarithmic sines and tangents for the hundredth part of every degree to fourteen decimal places, with a table of natural sines to fifteen places, and the tangents and secants for the same to ten places; all of which were printed at Gouda in 1631 and published in 1633 under the title of &quot;Trigonometria Britannica&quot;; this work was probably a successor to his 1617 &quot;Logarithmorum Chilias Prima&quot; (&quot;The First Thousand Logarithms&quot;), which gave a brief account of logarithms and a long table of the first 1000 integers calculated to the 14th decimal place.

English translations of Briggs&#x27;s &quot;Arithmetica&quot; and the first part of his &quot;Trigonometria Britannica&quot; are available on the web.

<text>The Wetteraukreis is a &quot;Kreis&quot; (district) in the middle of Hesse, Germany. Neighbouring districts are Landkreis Gießen, Vogelsbergkreis, Main-Kinzig-Kreis, district-free Stadt Frankfurt, Hochtaunuskreis and Lahn-Dill-Kreis.

==History==
The district was created in 1972 when the two districts Friedberg and Büdingen were merged.

==Geography==

The district is located between the Taunus mountains and the Vogelsberg volcanic mountain. The main rivers of the district are the Nidda River and the Wetter River.

==Coat of arms==
The imperial eagle in the top of the coat of arms was chosen because the Wetterau was imperial possession in the past. The bars in the bottom derive from the lords of Isenburg-Büdingen, who owned most of the area. The wavy line depicts the river Wetter which flows through the capital Friedberg.

<text>Gerald Anthony Scarfe (born 1 June 1936) is an English satirical cartoonist and illustrator. He has worked as editorial cartoonist for &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; and illustrator for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;.

His other work includes graphics for rock group Pink Floyd, particularly on their 1979 album &quot;The Wall&quot;, its 1982 film adaptation, and tour (1980–81), as well as the music video for &quot;Welcome to the Machine&quot;. From 1980 through to 1987, Scarfe also provided the opening animated titles and end credit illustrations for &quot;Yes Minister&quot; and &quot;Yes, Prime Minister&quot; for BBC Television. Also, Scarfe was the production designer on the Disney animated feature &quot;Hercules&quot; (1997).

==Early life==
Scarfe was born in St John&#x27;s Wood, London. As Scarfe was severely asthmatic as a child, he spent many of his early years bed-ridden, so drawing became a means of entertainment as well as a creative outlet. Scarfe speculated that the dark and grotesque images that often characterise his work are a result of his loneliness and asthma. Scarfe has stated that the irreverence apparent in much of his work can be traced back to &quot;dodgy treatments&quot; and a reliance on what he feels were incompetent doctors.

The cartoonist Ronald Searle was an early influence for Scarfe. At the age of 14 and now living in Hampstead, North London, Scarfe decided it would be easy to cycle to Bayswater and visit Searle. He went several times but never rang the doorbell. It would be decades before he would actually meet Searle in 2005. Scarfe attended Saint Martin&#x27;s School of Art (now part of the University of the Arts London) in Holborn, London. He also attended the London College of Printing, and East Ham Technical College (now Newham College of Further Education).

==Career==

===Early work===
After briefly working in advertising, a profession he grew to dislike intensely, Scarfe&#x27;s early caricatures of public figures were published in satirical magazine &quot;Private Eye&quot; throughout the 1960s and 1970s. Beginning in 1960, he produced illustrations for &quot;Punch&quot;, &quot;The Evening Standard&quot; and &quot;The Daily Sketch&quot;. &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; magazine assigned Scarfe to cover the 1964 US presidential election. He continued to work for &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; for two years, also producing several cover illustrations for &quot;Time&quot; magazine, including caricatures of The Beatles in 1967.

In the mid-1960s he took a job at the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; following a Dutch auction for his services with the &quot;Daily Express&quot;. His decision to work for the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; led to his estrangement from fellow cartoonist Ralph Steadman, alongside whom he had studied art at East Ham Technical College. Soon after, Steadman was commissioned to illustrate Scarfe and &quot;produced an image that was half saint and half Superman, but with a disconnected heart&quot;. Scarfe spent only one year working for the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, during which time he was sent to provide illustrations from the Vietnam War.

===Pink Floyd and Roger Waters===
Scarfe was approached to work with Pink Floyd after Roger Waters and Nick Mason both saw his animated BBC film &quot;A Long Drawn Out Trip&quot;. Pink Floyd&#x27;s 1974 programme for their tour in the UK and US, in the form of a comic, included a centre-spread caricature of the band. Scarfe later produced a set of animated short clips used on the 1977 &quot;In The Flesh&quot; tour, including a full-length music video for the song &quot;Welcome to the Machine&quot;.

Scarfe also drew the illustrations for their 1979 album &quot;The Wall&quot; and provided animation and stage props, including enormous inflatable characters for the subsequent 1980–1981 concert tour in support of that album. In 1982, he worked on the film version of &quot;The Wall&quot;, although he and Roger Waters fell out with director Alan Parker during the latter stages of editing. As well as the artwork, Scarfe contributed 15 minutes&#x27; worth of elaborate animation to the film, including a sequence depicting the German bombing campaign over England during World War II, set to the song &quot;Goodbye Blue Sky&quot;. Some of the animated footage was not original to the film, having been produced for and used in the 1980–81 concert tour, as well as being featured in the 1979 music video for &quot;Another Brick in the Wall: Part 2&quot;.

Scarfe continued to work with Roger Waters after the latter left Pink Floyd, creating the graphics and animation for Waters&#x27; solo album &quot;The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking&quot; (1984) and its supporting tour. Scarfe was also involved in subsequent theatrical adaptations of &quot;The Wall&quot;, including The Wall Concert in Berlin (1990), and Waters&#x27; worldwide The Wall Live (2010-2013) tour, where his animations were projected on a vast scale. Scarfe&#x27;s collaboration with Waters was marked in 2008 by the release of a signed limited-edition eight-print series, &quot;Scarfe on the Wall&quot;, which contained a monograph book with an extended new interview with Scarfe and was signed by Roger Waters. Early editions of &quot;Scarfe on The Wall&quot; (by date of pre-order, not issue number) came with an additional print giving a total of nine in the set – making these the rarest and most valuable sets. In 2010, Scarfe&#x27;s book &quot;The Making of Pink Floyd: The Wall&quot; was published, detailing the artist&#x27;s work with Pink Floyd and Roger Waters from 1974 to 2010. The book contains contributions from Floyd members Roger Waters, Nick Mason, and David Gilmour, as well as director of the film, Alan Parker.

===&quot;The Fall And Rise of Reginald Perrin&quot;===
He designed the &#x27;Grot&#x27; logo for the BBC TV series &quot;The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin&quot;.

===&quot;Yes Minister&quot;===
He provided caricatures of Paul Eddington, Sir Nigel Hawthorne and Derek Fowlds (as their respective characters) for the opening and closing sequences of &quot;Yes Minister&quot; and &quot;Yes, Prime Minister&quot;.

===&quot;Hercules&quot;===
Scarfe was approached to work on the 1997 Disney film &quot;Hercules&quot; by Ron Clements and John Musker, longtime fans who had risen to prominence within Disney following the success of &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;. Scarfe worked as a conceptual character artist, designing almost all of the characters and then supervising the 900 Disney artists charged with adapting his designs for the film.

===Postage stamps===
The Royal Mail used Scarfe&#x27;s artwork for a set of five commemorative postage stamps, issued on 23 April 1998. Honoring English comedians, the stamps feature Scarfe caricatures of Tommy Cooper, Eric Morecambe, Joyce Grenfell, Les Dawson and Peter Cook.

===Millennium Dome sculpture===
He was invited to create a sculpture for the Millennium Dome, which was entitled &quot;Self Portrait&quot;. The Dome&#x27;s chief executive PY Gerbeau said &quot;it mirrors what we like – and what we don&#x27;t – about our nation&quot;.

===Theatre/stage design===
Scarfe has designed sets for a number of operatic productions, including Tobias Picker&#x27;s &quot;Fantastic Mr. Fox&quot;. Following a chance meeting at a BBC prom he worked with Peter Hall on his version of Mozart&#x27;s &quot;The Magic Flute&quot;, which drew critical acclaim. He is lined up to provide animation for &quot;Jim Steinman&#x27;s Bat Out of Hell&quot;, a stage show featuring Steinman&#x27;s music. Scarfe designed the sets and costumes for the English National Opera&#x27;s 1988 production of &quot;Orpheus in the Underworld&quot;; among the costumes Scarfe designed were those of the characters Orpheus, Eurydice, and the Gods of Mount Olympus. He also produced all the costume and scenery designs for the 2002 Christopher Hampson production of &quot;The Nutcracker&quot;, for the English National Ballet. 

===Heroes and Villains===
In 2003 Scarfe collaborated with the National Portrait Gallery and BBC Four to make caricatures of a number of famous Britons, to depict (along with guest commentary) their heroic and villainous attributes. Amongst the over 30 portraits he depicted included caricatures of Henry VIII, Winston Churchill, Queen Elizabeth I, Pete Best, Richard Branson, Adam Smith, William Blake, The Beatles, Agatha Christie and Diana, Princess of Wales. In 2009, he also created a caricature of James May out of Lego which was shown in episode 5 of &quot;James May&#x27;s Toy Stories&quot; for BBC Two. Scarfe and Jane Asher also appeared in the episode. 

===Netanyahu cartoon===
In its edition of 27 January 2013 (Britain&#x27;s Holocaust Memorial Day), London&#x27;s &quot;Sunday Times&quot; published a cartoon by Scarfe depicting Israel&#x27;s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu paving a wall with the blood and bodies of Palestinians, captioned &quot;Israeli elections—will cementing peace continue?&quot; The cartoon&#x27;s timing and content was criticised by groups including the European Jewish Congress and the Board of Deputies of British Jews, with accusations of antisemitism leveled against Scarfe.

Unaware the cartoon would appear on Holocaust Memorial Day, Scarfe argued that the cartoon was clearly aimed specifically at Netanyahu and his policies, and were in response to his election, rather than being related to Holocaust Memorial Day. The newspaper&#x27;s proprietor, Rupert Murdoch, apologised for the cartoon on Twitter, and acting editor Martin Ivens promised to be more vigilant in future.

The cartoon was published in the Israeli newspaper &quot;Haaretz&quot;, where Anshel Pfeffer discusses the cartoon in great detail, giving four reasons why, in his opinion, the cartoon is not antisemitic. Writer Howard Jacobson claimed the cartoon was not antisemitic. British Chief Rabbi Lord Sacks condemned the cartoon.

===&quot;Recycled Radio&quot;===
Since June 2013, Scarfe has presented a programme on BBC Radio 4 called &quot;Recycled Radio&quot;, which is described as &quot;the chopped-up, looped-up, sped-up world...where old programmes are reused to explore a series of weighty subjects&quot;.

===Bristol Charity Auction===

In October 2013 Scarfe donated his time to decorate one of the large Wallace &amp; Gromit statues to be auctioned for the Bristol hospital charity that was featured live on the BBC. His contribution finally ending up being sold to an internet bidder from Miami Florida where the statue was exported into a private collection, ultimately topping all estimates on value with a bid second highest only to the Pixar statue contribution.

===Scarfe&#x27;s Bar===

In 2014, Scarfe&#x27;s Bar was opened in the Covent Garden area of London, in the Rosewood London, where his &quot;distinctive caricatures not only decorate the walls but also influence the creative thrust behind their menus.&quot;

== Personal life ==
He is married to actress Jane Asher, whom he met in 1971. The couple wed in 1981 and have a daughter and two sons.

<text>Cannon Street station, also known as London Cannon Street, is a central London railway terminus and connected London Underground station in Travelcard zone 1 located on Cannon Street in the City of London and managed by Network Rail. It is one of two London termini of the South Eastern Main Line, the other being , while the London Underground station is on the Circle and District lines, between Monument and Mansion House stations. The station runs services by Southeastern, mostly catering for commuters in southeast London and Kent, with occasional services further into the latter.

The station was built on a site of the medieval steelyard, the trading base in England of the Hanseatic League. It was built by the South Eastern Railway in order to have a railway terminal in the City and compete with the rival London, Chatham and Dover Railway. This required a new bridge across the River Thames, which was constructed between 1863 and 1866. The station was initially a stop for continental services from Charing Cross, and that route was convenient for travel between the City and the West End, until the construction of the District Railway. It remained popular with commuters, though its off-peak services were discontinued in the early 20th century, leading to it being closed on Sundays for almost 100 years. The original hotel on the station was unsuccessful, and eventually closed. The station was controversially renovated in the late 1950s by John Poulson, while further construction on top of the station building occurred during the City&#x27;s 1980s property boom. The Poulson building was replaced in 2007 as part of a general renovation of the station to make it more accessible. As part of the Thameslink Programme development in the 2010s, it was re-opened on Sundays and began to offer more long-distance services in place of Charing Cross.

==Location==

Cannon Street is a terminal station, approached across the River Thames by the Cannon Street Railway Bridge. Its approach by rail is through a triangular connection to both and . It is one of eighteen stations in the country that are managed by Network Rail.

There were originally eight platforms; a refurbishment in the late 1990s removed the original platform 1. It has entrances on Cannon Street itself and Dowgate Hill. It is located near London Stone (to the north of the station).

London Buses routes 15 and 17 and night routes N15 and N199 serve the station.

==History==

===Original structure===
Cannon Street station was built on a site where the Hanseatic merchants&#x27; Steelyard had been based from the 10th century until 1598. The site was proposed in 1860 by the South Eastern Railway (SER) in response to its rival, the London, Chatham &amp; Dover Railway (LC&amp;DR), extending a line into the City of London as far north as Ludgate Hill. The SER had already made plans to extend its line towards , but decided that it should complement this with a terminus in the City.

In 1861, the company obtained an act of Parliament for a station in Cannon Street, a short distance from Mansion House and the Bank of England. In addition to taking traffic from the LC&amp;DR, the new station would provide a direct railway link between the City and the West End, over which a journey could be made in a fraction of the time taken travelling by road. The approach was a branch of the line to Charing Cross, west of London Bridge. Work started on the station and its approach in July 1863. The construction work was undertaken by Lucas Brothers.

The station was opened on 1 September 1866 at a cost of £4 million (now £ million). The original building was designed by Sir John Hawkshaw and John Wolfe-Barry and was characterised by its two Christopher Wren-style towers, square and high, which faced on to the River Thames. The towers supported an iron train shed, long and crowned by a high single arch, almost semicircular, of glass and iron. The station is carried over Upper Thames Street on a brick viaduct, long and containing 27 million bricks. Below this viaduct exist the remains of a number of Roman buildings, which form a scheduled monument. The bridge was open to pedestrians between 1872 and 1877; they paid a toll of ½d.
The five-storey City Terminus Hotel, which fronted the station, was opened in May 1867. It was an Italianate style hotel and forecourt, designed by E. M. Barry, and it provided many of the station&#x27;s passenger facilities, as well as an appropriate architectural frontispiece to the street. This arrangement was very similar to that put in place at Charing Cross. The hotel was also built by Lucas Brothers. The hotel was not profitable, and was over £47,000 (now £) in debt by 1870. The City Terminus Hotel was renamed the Cannon Street Hotel in 1879. In July 1920, the hotel was the venue for the Foundation Congress of the Communist Party of Great Britain. Most of the hotel was closed in 1931, but the public rooms were kept open for meetings. The rest were converted into offices and renamed Southern House. The hotel is referred to in The Fire Sermon section of T. S. Eliot&#x27;s &quot;The Waste Land&quot;.

Upon its opening Cannon Street station was a stopping point for all services to and from Charing Cross, including boat trains to Continental Europe. A shuttle service between the two stations ran every 20 minutes and became a popular way of travelling between the City and the West End. However, the opening of the District Railway as far as Blackfriars caused traffic to decline, and its extension to Mansion House the following year reduced it further. The SER&#x27;s route could not compete with the Underground, which was more direct and reliable, but suburban traffic to Cannon Street remained popular, and the bridge was widened to in the late 1880s, allowing ten tracks with sidings. The rebuilt bridge was opened on 13 February 1892. The signal boxes outside the station were upgraded the following year.

The SER merged with the LC&amp;DR in 1899 to form the South Eastern and Chatham Railway (SECR). The following year, the station was earmarked for part-time closures as it relied primarily on business travel, but this was rejected. A further proposal was a monorail running between London Bridge and Cannon Street, at an estimated cost of £100,000; this was also abandoned. The London and Southwestern Railway (LSWR) became interested in using Cannon Street as a terminus, as it would allow a connection between Waterloo and the City.

===War years===

Work on strengthening the bridge, by the addition of six new girders in between the existing ones, was completed in 1913.

Most Cannon Street train services ceased during World War I. Continental boat trains were stopped on 15 November 1914 and rerouted to Victoria. The station stopped being served by through services from Charing Cross on 31 December 1916, and was closed on Sundays. Services were reduced further on 1 May 1918, when it was closed after 3 p.m. on Saturdays and between 11 a.m. and 4 p.m. Mondays to Fridays. This allowed Cannon Street to be used as a goods depot for war supplies.

Between 5 and 28 June 1926, the station was closed to allow the Southern Railway to carry out various works, including the rebuilding of the platforms, relaying of the tracks and installation of a new system of electrical signalling – the four-aspect colour light scheme. The station was also renovated and the glass roof cleaned. The number of platforms was reduced from nine to eight, with five set aside for the new electric trains. The signal box spanning the width of the railway bridge was removed. In July 1939, Cannon Street was closed for a week following a fire in Borough Market which prevented any trains accessing it.

The station, which had been subject to structural neglect prior to World War II, suffered extensive bomb damage and was hit by several incendiary devices which damaged the roof. A high explosive also hit platform 8. The original glass roof had been removed before the war, in an attempt to save it; however, the factory in which the roof was stored was itself badly bombed, destroying the roof.

===Redevelopment===

Following nationalisation of the railways in 1948, the station was managed by the Southern Region of British Railways. The station&#x27;s prime location coupled with the property boom of the 1950s and the need for British Rail to seek alternative revenue streams made war-damaged Cannon Street a key target for property developers. Steam trains stopped running from Cannon Street in 1961 

Various plans were mooted for the reconstruction of the station, from the installation of a new ticket hall and concourse under Southern House in 1955 as part of British Rail&#x27;s Modernisation Plan to the construction of a car park estimated to cost £125,000 (now £) and even a helipad. In 1962, the British Transport Commission entered into an agreement with Town &amp; Country Properties for the construction of a multi-storey office building above the station with of floor space. The cost of the development was £2.35 million (now £ million) and it was scheduled for completion by June 1965.

In preparation for redevelopment, the remains of the train shed roof had been demolished in 1958, and Barry&#x27;s hotel (which had been used as offices since 1931) soon followed in 1960. The architect selected to design the new building was John Poulson who was good friends with Graham Tunbridge, a British Rail surveyor whom he had met during the war. Poulson took advantage of this friendship to win contracts for the redevelopment of various British Rail termini. He paid Tunbridge a weekly income of £25 and received in return building contracts, including the rebuilding of Waterloo and East Croydon stations. At his trial in 1974, Poulson admitted that, shortly before receiving the Cannon Street building contract, he had given Tunbridge a cheque for £200 and a suit worth £80. Poulson was later found guilty of corruption charges and given a seven-year concurrent sentence; Tunbridge received a 15-month suspended sentence and a £4,000 fine for his role in the affair.

All that now remains of the original station architecture are the twin yellow brick towers at the country-end and parts of the low flanking walls.

===Modern era===

The station&#x27;s twin brick towers were listed Grade II in 1972. In 1974, the station was closed for five weeks from 2 August to 9 September to enable alterations to be made to the track and the approaches to London Bridge to be resignalled. Traffic was diverted to London Bridge, Charing Cross and . On 4 March 1976, a Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) bomb of about 10 lb (4.5 kg) exploded on an empty commuter train leaving Cannon Street, injuring eight people on another train travelling alongside.

On 15 February 1984, it was reported in &quot;The Times&quot; that Cannon Street was to close. At the time, the station had been closed for weekends and evenings, and the publication of British Rail&#x27;s new timetable for 1984–1985 revealed that it would lose all its direct off-peak services to the south-east. Services from Sevenoaks, , , , , , , Lewisham and Greenwich would instead terminate at except during peak hours. This was denied by British Rail (Southern)&#x27;s manager David Kirby, who pointed out that it had invested £10 million in redecking the railway bridge, and that passengers travelling from the south-east during off-peak hours would most likely be visiting the West End and not the City.

In 1986, the twin towers were restored in a project costing £242,000 (now £). The works revealed that the east tower still contained a large water tank which was used during the days of steam traction to replenish locomotives and to power the station&#x27;s hydraulic systems. The brickwork was repaired, cleaned and repointed, and the weather vanes gilded to complement the dome of nearby St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. This work was one of the Railway Heritage Trust&#x27;s first projects and coincided with an exhibition held in the station in August of the same year to mark its 150th anniversary.
In the 1980s, there was another property boom and British Rail again began looking into further commercial uses of the Cannon Street landspace, including of office space. The air rights over the platforms to the rear of Poulson&#x27;s office were sold to Speyhawk which appointed Bovis Construction to build a free-standing structure comprising two office blocks on a 6,000 tonne steel deck constructed over the station&#x27;s eight platforms. The Cannons Club, a sports club, was founded beneath the station&#x27;s arches around this time, and quickly became one of the most prestigious squash clubs in the country. InterCity, the high-speed arm of British Rail, subsequently sponsored the National Squash Championships and National Squash Challenge.

The larger office block, the &quot;Atrium building&quot;, provides of office space on six floors and is linked to the smaller building, the &quot;River building&quot;, via a glazed link raised through a central glazed atrium. The River building, which has two storeys, is built on the steel deck and contained within the station&#x27;s two flank walls, which were rebuilt, providing of office space. This building projects slightly beyond the restored twin towers which form the riverside boundary to the development. The Atrium building was later let to the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange (Liffe). The River building has a roof garden. The project cost around £500,000 and was laid to comply with planning restrictions which required the building to be low and flat to maintain the sight lines from St Paul&#x27;s to Tower Bridge.
Planning permission was granted in March 2007 to replace the Poulson building, with a new air rights building designed by Foggo Associates. Hines, the US developer, led a £360 million project involving the demolition of Poulson&#x27;s office block, replacing it with a mixed-use development containing more than of office space alongside of station retail space. The redevelopment was part of a larger regeneration programme undertaken by Network Rail to modernise and &quot;unlock the commercial potential&quot; of the main London termini; and were also redeveloped. Network Rail&#x27;s director of commercial property said that the finished station would be &quot;less congested and more accessible for passengers.&quot; Cannon Street won the award for &quot;Major Station of the Year&quot; at the 2013 National Rail Awards.

In January 2015, the station&#x27;s opening hours were extended to 0500–0100 Monday to Sunday (prior to this, the station had been closed on Sundays and during the evenings), and several services which previously terminated at Charing Cross were diverted to Cannon Street as a result of Thameslink Programme works. Some of these services reverted to terminating at Charing Cross following the completion of the works, while services from the Greenwich line and from New Cross and St Johns will permanently run to Cannon Street due to the removal of the Spa Road Junction.

==National Rail==

The station connects the south side of the City to south and south-east London via station. Some services run directly into Cannon Street from Kent and East Sussex, but generally only during peak hours. Occasionally during the weekends when track maintenance is in progress, the station serves as an intermediate station between London Bridge and . Either trains reverse at the station or rail passengers change trains here. From 1918 to 2015, the station was closed on Sundays; this changed with Southeastern&#x27;s introduction of a new timetable from January 2015 which resulted in the station&#x27;s opening hours being extended over the entire week, except when engineering works require its closure and most services diverted to Charing Cross. In the same way, many trains can be diverted to Cannon Street if engineering works affect Charing Cross.

===Services===
All services at London Cannon Street are operated by Southeastern using , , , and EMUs.

The typical off-peak service in trains per hour is:
* 2 tph to via 
* 2 tph to via , returning to London Cannon Street via and 
* 2 tph to Slade Green via Greenwich and Woolwich Arsenal, returning to London Cannon Street via Bexleyheath
* 2 tph to via and Woolwich Arsenal

During peak hours, there are also additional services to , , and , and to and via .

===Accidents and incidents===
*On 26 December 1867, seven passengers and three train crew members were injured when, &quot;during a very thick fog&quot;, a train arriving at Cannon Street from Greenwich collided with another from Waterloo due to a signaller&#x27;s error.
*On 27 June 1914, one person was killed and 20 were injured in a collision and subsequent derailment at Cannon Street. A train departing for was in a side-long collision with a train arriving, across its path, from and, although the collision occurred at low speed, part of the Plumstead service was derailed and one of its carriages overturned. The driver of the Plumstead service was blamed for a failure to observe, and a misreading of, signals which took his train into the path of the Hastings-bound service. An investigation found the man who died was likely leaning out of the window at the moment his carriage overturned, and he might have avoided serious injury had he been seated.
*On 16 July 1919, 75 people were injured or left shaken when a train arriving from hit the buffers at the end of Cannon Street&#x27;s platform seven. Twelve of the injured required hospital treatment. A Board of Trade report into the incident blamed &quot;an error of judgment&quot; on the driver&#x27;s part while he was braking on his approach to the platform end.
*On 11 May 1941, the station was bombed in a Luftwaffe air raid. SR V class 4-4-0 No. 934 &quot;St. Lawrence&quot; was severely damaged.
*On 20 March 1951, a diesel electric multiple unit and an electric multiple unit were in a side-long collision when the driver of the latter misread signals.
*On 5 April 1957, the signal box was destroyed by a fire due to an electrical fault. The station was consequently put out of action. Using hand signals, a skeleton service was put in place on 8 April. A temporary signal box was erected which came into operation on 5 May. Steam locomotives were temporarily banned from using the station, with Hastings Units being introduced into service earlier than planned. A full service was resumed from 6 May. Construction of a new signal box began on 19 April and it came into service on 16 December.
*On 20 March 1961, a side-long collision and partial derailment resulted in injury to 12 people aboard an arriving service whose driver inadvertently passed a red signal and ran into an empty train as it left Cannon Street.
*On 4 March 1976, a bomb exploded on an empty electric multiple unit at the station. Eight people in an adjacent train were injured.
* On 20 August 1989, the &quot;Marchioness&quot; pleasure boat sank close to Cannon Street Railway Bridge, killing 51 people.
*On 8 January 1991, two people were killed and hundreds were injured when an electric multiple unit failed to stop on a dead-end platform and collided with the buffers.

==London Underground==

The London Underground station is sub-surface, situated immediately below the main line station. It is served by the District and Circle lines. Entrances are located on Cannon Street, Dowgate Hill, and on the main line concourse upstairs at the National Rail station, providing an interconnection for commuters. Since 2018, out of station interchange has been permitted between Cannon Street and Bank stations.

===History===
By 1876, the Metropolitan Railway (MR) and District Railway (DR) had constructed the majority of the Inner Circle (now the Circle line), reaching and respectively. The companies were in dispute over the completion of the route as the DR was struggling financially and the MR was concerned that completion would affect its revenues through increased competition from the DR in the City area. In 1874, city financiers who were keen to see the line completed established the Metropolitan Inner Circle Completion Railway (MICCR) to link Mansion House to Aldgate. Forced into action, the MR bought out the company, and it and the DR began construction of the final section of the Inner Circle in 1879.

On 6 October 1884, the final section of the Inner Circle was opened, along with Cannon Street station. Initially, the station was served by trains of both companies as part of the circular Inner Circle service, but various operational patterns have been used during the station&#x27;s life. The Inner Circle service achieved a separate identity as the Circle line in 1949, although its trains were still provided by the District or Metropolitan lines.

A station here was part of the abandoned phase two expansion of the Fleet line (now Jubilee line). It had originally been planned in 1943, and was revived as a major transport plan in 1965. London Transport spent £10m (now £m) in 1972 safeguarding the route underneath Cannon Street and building reinforcements for laying a tube in the water-bearing ground around the station. The plan was abandoned in the early 1980s in favour of the current extension further south.

The Underground station underwent major reconstruction at the same time as the main line station, with the work being completed in 2012. From 14 December 2014, the station&#x27;s opening hours changed significantly, with the station opening on Sundays and no longer closing early in the evenings. The station previously had restricted opening hours because it primarily served the local financial services sector, so there was low demand for services outside office hours. However, with the main line station&#x27;s opening hours being extended due to the Thameslink Programme, the Underground station&#x27;s opening hours were changed to accommodate the additional passengers.

<text>Charing Cross (; sometimes informally abbreviated as Charing +, Charing X, CHX or CH+) is a London Underground station at Charing Cross in the City of Westminster. The station is served by the Bakerloo and Northern lines and provides an interchange with Charing Cross mainline station. On the Bakerloo line, the station is between Piccadilly Circus and Embankment stations. On the Charing Cross branch of the Northern line, it is between Leicester Square and Embankment stations. The station is in fare zone 1.

Charing Cross was originally two separate stations, known for most of their existence as Trafalgar Square (on the Bakerloo line) and Strand (on the Northern line). The Bakerloo line platforms were opened by the Baker Street and Waterloo Railway in 1906 and the Northern line platforms by the Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railway in 1907. In the 1970s, in preparation for the opening of the Jubilee line, the two earlier stations were connected together with new below ground passageways. When the Jubilee line platforms opened in 1979, the combined station was given the current name. Jubilee line services ended in 1999 when the line was extended to Stratford.

The station has entrances in Trafalgar Square, Strand, Villiers Street, Adelaide Street, William IV Street and in the mainline station. It is close to the National Gallery, the National Portrait Gallery, Admiralty Arch, St Martin-in-the-Fields, Canada House, South Africa House, the Savoy Hotel, The Mall, Northumberland Avenue and Whitehall.

As of , Charing Cross is the station on the London Underground with million passengers using it per year.

==History==
===Planning===
From the 1860s to the 1900s numerous schemes for underground railways through central London were proposed, often using similar routes. Many of the schemes submitted to Parliament for approval as private bills included proposals for lines through the Charing Cross area with stations serving the South Eastern Railway&#x27;s (SER&#x27;s) Charing Cross mainline terminus and the area around Trafalgar Square.

====1860s and 1870s====

The first proposal came before Parliament in 1864, a year after the opening of the Metropolitan Railway, the world&#x27;s first underground railway, and the year the mainline station opened. The North Western and Charing Cross Railway (NW&amp;CCR) proposed a line in a cut-and-cover tunnel between the London and North Western Railway&#x27;s terminus at Euston and Charing Cross. The was to have its own station on the north side of Strand before it came to the surface alongside the main line station and connected to the tracks on Hungerford Bridge. The railway was approved in July 1864.

The following year, the Waterloo and Whitehall Railway (W&amp;WR) received permission to construct a short railway between Waterloo station and a station at the western end of Great Scotland Yard at the junction with Whitehall. The line was to be a pneumatic railway with the carriages sucked and pushed through the tunnels like a piston by fans at Waterloo. Construction works began for the ends of the cut and cover tunnels on each side of the River Thames and part of the cast-iron cylinder that was to be sunk into a trench dredged into the bed of the river.

Progress on both railways was halted in the Panic of 1866, a major crash in the London and international stock markets that led to the collapse of a number of banks and prevented funds being raised to continue the works. The was liquidated in 1868, and the plans were abandoned in 1869.

The plans were revived with minor changes by the Euston, St Pancras and Charing Cross Railway in 1870. A station was planned at the same location as the . Parliamentary approval was granted in 1871 and the company changed its name to the London Central Railway, but the scheme was again unable to raise sufficient funds. It was abandoned in 1874.

====1880s====

In 1881, the Central Metropolitan Railway proposed a cut-and-cover line running from Parliament Square to St Pancras. At the southern end, the line was to run under Whitehall, Trafalgar Square and St Martin&#x27;s Lane, though the location of the station was not recorded. The section under Whitehall was opposed by the government and it was removed so that the line was to terminate at Charing Cross, but the whole scheme was rejected by Parliament in 1882.

Another proposal in 1881 was the Charing Cross and Waterloo Electric Railway (CC&amp;WER). The proposal was similar to the 17 years earlier; a short line running in iron pipes sunk into the river bed connecting Waterloo station to the north side of the river, this time to a station under Trafalgar Square. The scheme was the first in the UK to propose the use of electric traction for its trains and was supported by Sir William Siemens whose electrical engineering company Siemens Brothers was to provide the electrical equipment. The was approved in August 1882. A proposal to extend the route to the City of London was submitted to Parliament later that year, but was withdrawn the following year as the company struggled to raise funds. In 1883, the London Central Electric Railway, proposed an extension of the ; this time from the Charing Cross end with the line running to the General Post Office at St Martin&#x27;s Le Grand. The plan was rejected. William Siemens died in 1883 and the plan was abandoned in 1885.

In 1884, proposals were made for two cut-and-cover lines to link Charing Cross with one of the northern terminals. The first proposal, the Charing Cross and Euston Railway, proposed a line between those two stations. At Charing Cross a terminal station was to be provided under Villiers Street which was to be closed to allow a separate branch to rise to the surface to cross the river on a new bridge adjacent to Hungerford bridge before connecting to the tracks south of the river. The bill was withdrawn in February 1885. The second proposal, the London Central Subway, proposed connecting Charing Cross and King&#x27;s Cross. The station at Charing Cross was to be beneath the south side of Trafalgar Square below ground. The government&#x27;s Office of Works objected to the proposed alignment on the north side of Trafalgar Square because it believed the tunnels would compromise the foundations of the National Gallery. The bill was withdrawn in April 1885.

Also in 1884, the King&#x27;s Cross, Charing Cross and Waterloo Subway submitted a proposal to construct a line linking the three mainline terminals in its name. Unlike the earlier schemes and those of the Charing Cross and Euston Railway and London Central Subway, the company planned to construct its line at a deeper level with the tunnels constructed using a tunnelling shield and lined with cast-iron segments. The stations were to be constructed using the cut-and-cover technique with one platform above the other. Two stations were to be constructed close to Charing Cross: one to the south at the junction of Northumberland Avenue and Northumberland Street and one to the north in St Martin&#x27;s Place. The bill was withdrawn in May 1885.

In 1889, the North and South London Subway was proposed. It was to connect Camden Town and Elephant &amp; Castle, and proposed a station north of the National Gallery at the junction of Charing Cross Road and Green Street (now Irving Street). The bill was announced, but was not submitted to parliament.

====1890s====

Following the successful opening in 1890 of the City and South London Railway (C&amp;SLR), the first deep-level tube railway and the first underground railway using electric traction, a number of railways were proposed in London to be constructed and operated by similar means. In 1891, two bills were submitted for tube railways that were to serve Charing Cross: the Baker Street &amp; Waterloo Railway (BS&amp;WR) and the Hampstead, St Pancras &amp; Charing Cross Railway (HStP&amp;CCR).

The was to connect Baker Street and Waterloo station and the was to connect Hampstead with Charing Cross with a branch to Euston, St Pancras and King&#x27;s Cross. The former company&#x27;s station was to be under Trafalgar Square and the latter&#x27;s was to be at the junction of King William Street (now William IV Street) and Agar Street with a pedestrian subway under Strand to the forecourt of the mainline station. After a committee sat to consider these and the various other railways being proposed, the BS&amp;WR was approved in March 1893 and the , renamed to the Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railway (CCE&amp;HR), was approved in August 1893. The and the would become the first two lines through Charing Cross to be completed, though it was several years before construction began on either line.

In 1896, the City and West End Railway proposed a route running between Cannon Street in the City of London and Hammersmith via the West End and Knightsbridge. A station for Charing Cross was to be provided at King William Street. The company&#x27;s east–west route would have been competition for a number of other lines that had been permitted but which had not yet opened: the under construction Central London Railway (CLR), the Metropolitan District Railway&#x27;s (MDR&#x27;s) proposed deep level line and the Brompton and Piccadilly Circus Railway&#x27;s (B&amp;PCR&#x27;s) line. Lobbying from these companies led to the City and West End Railway bill being rejected in April 1897.

The final new scheme of the 1890s was the Paddington and Charing Cross Railway&#x27;s proposal in 1897 to link these two mainline stations. Its station at Charing Cross was to be under and parallel with Craven Street on the south side of the main line station. When the bill was first considered in January 1898, the promoters failed to attend Parliament to support it and the bill was declared &quot;dead&quot;.

Also in 1897, the submitted a bill to change the route of the final section of its line. Instead of turning east at the end of Charing Cross Road to Agar Street and Strand, the route was revised to run south past Trafalgar Square to end at a station under Craven Street. The change was approved in July 1898 and the previous routing was abandoned.

====1900s====
Like the opening of the ten years earlier, the successful opening of the in 1900 spurred another set of proposals for new lines with routes criss-crossing London.

=====1901=====

Proposals for the 1901 parliamentary session that planned to serve Charing Cross included three new lines and the extension of one already approved.

The Charing Cross, Hammersmith and District Railway (CCH&amp;DR) proposed a line from just north of Charing Cross to Hammersmith via Knightsbridge and Kensington. Two stations were planned around Trafalgar Square: one to the north-east at Bedfordbury with its entrance probably to be located at the junction of Agar Street and Strand; the other on the south side of the Square.

The Piccadilly and City Railway (P&amp;CR) proposed a line from Piccadilly Circus to Cannon Street. It planned to connect to other companies&#x27; lines at each end. The P&amp;CR&#x27;s station at Charing Cross was to be on the east side of Adelaide Street at the junction with Strand.

The Victoria, City and Southern Electric Railway proposed a line from Pimlico to Peckham Rye connecting Victoria with the City, Southwark and south-east London. Its tunnels would have run between Whitehall and Strand with a station to the south-west of the mainline station. The promoters failed to appear before the parliamentary committee and the bill was declared &quot;dead&quot; in January 1901.

The submitted a bill for an extension of its approved route south from Charing Cross to Westminster and Victoria.

To review all these bills and the others submitted for underground lines in London, Parliament established a joint committee under Lord Windsor. By the time the committee had produced its report, the 1901 parliamentary session was almost over so the promoters of the bills were asked to resubmit them for the 1902 session.

=====1902=====

The 1902 session saw an increase in the number of bills submitted for tube railways in London. The , and bills from 1901 were resubmitted along with new bills from the , the and the and from a newcomer, the London United Electric Railway (LUER). To manage the workload of reviewing all of the bills, two joint committees were established, one under Lord Windsor and the other under Lord Ribblesdale.

The Ribblesdale Committee considered the bills and rejected the extension to Victoria as being not in compliance with Commons standing orders. The new bill proposed a short extension of the line southwards beneath the station to the Charing Cross station (now Embankment) to provide an interchange with that line and the . It was approved in November 1892.

The other bills affecting Charing Cross were considered by the Windsor Committee. Several of these involved tunnels between Charing Cross and Piccadilly Circus and, either independently or in conjunction with other companies&#x27; proposals, formed parts of routes connection Charing Cross to Hammersmith. Although it did not plan a station in the vicinity of Strand or Trafalgar Square, the proposal for a short line to connect its planned station at Piccadilly Circus and the planned deep-level platforms at its Charing Cross station would have required tunnels to run one above the other, south under Adelaide Street and Craven Street on the south-west side of the mainline station before turning east into Northumberland Avenue and north under Victoria Embankment to connect to the planned tunnels. The link was rejected on engineering grounds.

The proposal was for a second line to connect its two existing termini at Shepherds&#x27; Bush and Bank via a more southerly route to form a deep-level loop. At Charing Cross, the new line would have run under Strand, then north-west past Trafalgar Square towards Piccadilly Circus. The bill reintroduced its Charing Cross to Hammersmith scheme from the previous year and proposed an additional connection to the at Agar Street. The entirety of the scheme and the majority of the scheme, including all of the southern loop line, were rejected by parliament.

The proposal was amended from the previous year to run beyond Piccadilly Circus to Hammersmith. This required its platforms at Charing Cross to be deeper than in its previous scheme. The was promoted by the London United Tramways (LUT) and also planned to run between Hammersmith and Charing Cross. Approaching from the west beneath The Mall, at Charing Cross the line was to form a loop running from the Duke of York Column at the south end of Waterloo Place, under Trafalgar Square to the corner of Duncannon Street and Strand before turning south to run under the mainline station to the junction of Northumberland Avenue and Whitehall Place before running west to complete the loop. Its station would have been located on the loop.

Mergers and amalgamations led to the and the routes being joined into a combined scheme, the London Suburban Railway (LSR). The proposals were modified in a number of ways before bills were ready at the end of July 1902 for a third and final reading. At Charing Cross, a station building to be shared with the was to be located on the north side of Strand at the junction with Adelaide Street with a pedestrian subway under Strand connecting to the mainline station. While the bills were awaiting their final readings, the was taken over by Speyer Brothers, the financiers of the rival Underground Electric Railways Company of London (UERL). The planned route was similar to that of the -owned . Under Speyer Brothers&#x27; control, the withdrew the bill and the remainder of the proposals failed.

=====1903–1906=====
Fewer tube railway bills were proposed for the 1903 parliamentary session. Three bills included Charing Cross in their plans and were submitted by the , the and the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway (GNP&amp;BR). The bill provided for the purchase of additional land for its station. The resubmitted its previous loop line bill unaltered expecting that the collapse of the plans would improve its chance of success.

The proposed a modification of the previous year&#x27;s for a branch southwards from Piccadilly Circus. This time the branch would run under Leicester Square with platforms under King William Street and a station building at the junction of Agar Street and Strand. The tunnels would then turn eastwards under Strand to continue to Mansion House in the City of London where it would connect to the deep-level line. Between Piccadilly Circus and Ludgate Circus, the route was similar to the loop line proposal.

Neither of the bills proceeded as the Royal Commission on London Traffic was established on 10 February 1903 to consider future development of transport in London. During its deliberations consideration of any new proposals was suspended. After the Commission issued its report on 17 July 1905, an attempt was made to revive a bill that had been submitted too late for the 1903 session and had been waiting parliament&#x27;s consideration since February 1903. The Hammersmith, City &amp; North East London Railway (HC&amp;NELR) was a re-presentation of the and schemes running from Hammersmith to Palmers Green. A station was planned between Agar Street and Bedford Street. The bill was rejected for not complying with standing orders in 1905, and resubmitted for the 1906 session with the station moved to the junction of Agar Street and Strand. Again the bill was rejected for procedural reasons and it was not presented again.

===Construction and opening===

Construction of the began in August 1898, with the boring of the tunnels under the River Thames beginning in February 1899. At the end of 1900, the collapse of the parent company, London &amp; Globe Finance Corporation, put the railway company in financial difficulties. Tunnelling stopped in May 1901 with most of the running tunnels complete between Waterloo and the south end of Regent Street. At Trafalgar Square, the station tunnels had been excavated. In March 1902, the was taken over by a consortium of investors led by Charles Yerkes. Works restarted under the new owners and 80 per cent of the tunnels were complete by March 1903.

Construction of the began in September 1903. Tunnelling under the mainline station was done in compressed air to prevent any damage from ground movements. The railway had permission to construct the underground station&#x27;s ticket hall under part of the station&#x27;s forecourt, but it was to be done from below to avoid disrupting the station. In December 1905, the roof of the mainline station collapsed and the station closed for three months for rebuilding. During this period, the was given permission to excavate the forecourt for six weeks. Works to construct a lift shaft and form the walls around the ticket hall were carried out with a grid of steel beams placed across the site onto which the forecourt surface was reconstructed. Excavation of the ticket hall and a second lift shaft were carried out from the roofed-over space.

Trafalgar Square station was provided with two long platforms. There was nowhere to place a surface building, so the station had a sub-surface ticket hall under the square. The ticket hall had three entrances: one at the south-east corner of the central area of the square, one on the corner of Strand and one on the east side of the square. Lifts manufactured by the Otis Elevator Company and a spiral stair connected the platforms and ticket hall. Platform tiling at Trafalgar Square station was started in early 1904. The station had two long platforms with the lifts again provided by Otis.

Trafalgar Square station opened when the opened between Baker Street and Kennington Road on 10 March 1906. Charing Cross station opened as the southern terminus of the on 22 June 1907.

===Extension and modifications===

The and stations were not connected below ground. To make interchanging between the lines easier, on 6 April 1914, the was extended south under the mainline station to provide an interchange with the and the . For the opening of the extension, the station was renamed &quot;Charing Cross (Strand)&quot; with the new station to the south being named &quot;Charing Cross (Embankment)&quot;. On 9 May 1915, these were changed again with the former Charing Cross station becoming &quot;Strand&quot; (causing a nearby station of the to change its name from &quot;Strand&quot; to &quot;Aldwych&quot;) and the other becoming &quot;Charing Cross&quot;.

Beginning in 1924, a number of central London stations were modernised with escalators being provided to replace lifts. At Trafalgar Square, two Otis escalators came into use on 13 April 1926, doubling the capacity of the station. The ticket hall was modernised and extended to use the space previously occupied by the lifts and a passage was constructed to a new entrance in Cockspur Street on the south side of the square. The improvements to the ticket hall included the installation of automatic ticket machines. Strand station retained its lifts.

===War and new plans===
In September 1938 during the Sudeten Crisis, when it appeared that war with Germany was imminent, the tunnels of the Bakerloo and Northern lines under the River Thames were closed and sealed with concrete to protect the system from flooding that might be caused by a bomb falling in the river and breaching the tunnels. As a consequence, between 27 September 1938 and 8 October 1938 both Trafalgar Square and Strand stations were closed. After the crisis was resolved and the concrete seals were removed, works began on installing flood gates to protect the lines each side of the river. Following Germany&#x27;s ultimatum to Poland on the Polish Corridor, the Northern line tunnels were again plugged on 1 September 1939 and were not reopened until 17 December 1939, once the flood gates had been installed.

On 12 October 1940, a German bomb fell on Trafalgar Square station killing seven people sheltering from the Blitz.
In 1944, The &quot;County of London Plan&quot; recommended replacing the mainline station with one below ground served by two routes: Route A, running between Clapham and New Cross via Victoria station, Blackfriars, Cannon Street and Wapping and Route B, a loop line linking Waterloo, Charing Cross, Blackfriars, Cannon Street and London Bridge. The location of the station was not specified.

A post-war report in 1946 rejected the idea of moving the mainline station entirely underground, but did propose several new lines running in tunnels within the central area including two serving Charing Cross. Route 5 (running between Hither Green and Old Oak Common) and Route 9 (running between Raynes Park and Clapton) were mainline routes proposed to connect to existing surface lines to allow main line trains to cross London without using the terminals. A third route, Route 12A, was a London Underground route running between Golders Green and Waterloo. It was to run beneath the existing Northern line tunnels to relieve congestion on the line.

None of these proposals were developed by the mainline railway companies, the London Passenger Transport Board or their successor organisations.

In 1956, the London County Council planned to construct pedestrian subways from the ticket hall of Strand station under Strand to Duncannon Street and Adelaide Street with a travelator in the main passage from the station and escalators from the subways to street level. A separate subway from the north side of Strand to the ticket hall and another to connect to the subways from Trafalgar Square station were also proposed. The works were not carried-out.

===Reconstruction and integration for the Jubilee line===

Throughout the 1950s and early 1960s consideration was given to various routes connecting north-west and south-east London via the West End and the City of London including proposals to extend the Bakerloo line south-east from Elephant &amp; Castle to Camberwell and beyond. Planning of the Victoria line had the greater priority and it was not until after construction of that line started that detailed planning began for the new line, first called the Fleet line in 1965 as it was planned to run in an east–west direction along Fleet Street to the City of London and then south of the River Thames to Lewisham. Lack of funding meant that only the first stage of the proposed line, from Baker Street to Charing Cross, received royal assent in July 1969; funding was agreed in August 1971.

Tunnelling began in February 1972 and was completed by the end of 1974. In 1977, during construction of the stations, the name of the line was changed to the Jubilee line, to mark the Queen&#x27;s Silver Jubilee that year.

At Charing Cross, the tunnels for the Jubilee line were aligned east–west beneath Strand with the running tunnels passing under the Bakerloo line and Northern line tunnels and the new Jubilee line platforms between the two. A cross-over junction to the west of the platforms enabled trains to terminate and start from both platforms. In preparation for the second stage of the line continuing to Aldwych and beyond, the running tunnels were continued east of the new platforms at Charing Cross, running beneath Strand to end at Wellington Street. The original Strand station ticket hall beneath the forecourt of the mainline station was enlarged under the forecourt and under Strand itself. To enable this, piles were installed in the forecourt in January 1973 to support a steel umbrella structure erected over the area during the Easter weekend in 1973. The foundations of the Eleanor cross in the station forecourt also needed to be underpinned to avoid it being damaged during the excavations. With the enlargement of the ticket hall, linking subways were constructed to new entrances in Villiers Street, on the north side of Strand, in Adelaide Street and in William IV Street.

The new platforms were connected to both of the original stations, forming one new station. Strand station closed on 16 June 1973 so that an escalator shaft could be constructed diagonally through the original lift shafts down to an intermediate concourse. From here passages to and from the Northern line platforms branch off and a second set of three escalators descend to the eastern end of the Jubilee line platforms, which are below street level. At Trafalgar Square station, the existing concourse at the bottom of the 1926 escalator shaft was enlarged to connect to a new passage which ran eastwards towards another concourse at the top of a second set of two escalators and a fixed stair down to the western end of the Jubilee line platforms. To carry out the work on the station and the running tunnels, a site on the north-western corner of Trafalgar Square at Whitcomb Street was used to construct a pair of access shafts deep from which long passages were excavated beneath Trafalgar Square to the existing below ground concourses. Although not originally intended for passenger use, part of one of these became the interchange passage between the Bakerloo and Northern lines. A new electrical sub-station to supply the line was installed at the bottom of one of Strand station&#x27;s redundant escalator shafts. Once the structural work to enlarge the ticket hall was completed, the umbrella structure was removed in October 1975.

Work on fitting out the tunnels and stations began at the end of 1975, but serious delays in the progress of the work prevented the line from opening in 1978 as intended. Tracks and signals were commissioned and trial running of trains on the line began on 14 August 1978, but work on the station was delayed by industrial action at the escalator contractor.

The official opening of the line by Prince Charles took place on 30 April 1979, starting with a train journey from Green Park to Charing Cross. The Jubilee line opened to the public on 1 May 1979. On the same day the Northern line service was reinstated and the combined station was named Charing Cross.

The new Northern line and Jubilee line ticket hall was decorated in lime green and blue moulded plastic panels with black tiles. Lime green was also used for the wall tiling of the Jubilee line platforms which was combined with decorative panels featuring images of Lord Nelson and Trafalgar Square by David Gentleman. Gentleman also designed the decorative scheme for the Northern line platforms. These have panels featuring a continuous mural illustrating, in the style of black and white woodcuts, the construction of the Eleanor Cross. The Bakerloo line platforms and ticket hall were not redecorated at the same time as those of the other two lines. This was carried out in 1983 when decorative panels for the platforms featuring artwork from the National Gallery and National Portrait Gallery were installed.

===Closure of Jubilee line platforms===
Although permission had been granted in 1971 and 1972, work on the Fleet line&#x27;s stages 2 and 3 did not proceed and it was not until 1992 that an alternative route was approved. The Jubilee line extension took the line south of the River Thames via Waterloo. Due to the tightness of the curves required and speed restrictions that would have been needed it was impractical to reach Waterloo from Charing Cross. New tunnels branching from the original route south of Green Park would be constructed, and the line to Charing Cross would be closed. Tunnelling began in May 1994 and the new extension opened in stages starting at Stratford in the east, with services to Charing Cross ending on 19 November 1999 and the final section between Green Park and Waterloo opening the following day. The Jubilee line platforms were closed and walls constructed across the intermediate concourses at the top of the two banks of escalators.

The Jubilee line platforms are still used by Jubilee line trains as sidings to reverse trains from southbound to northbound. To do so southbound trains terminate and disembark passengers at Green Park station and run empty to one of the Charing Cross platforms. In August 2023, a miscommunication resulted in a train being sent down the wrong track. Not all passengers were able to disembark at Green Park before the train arrived at the abandoned platforms. London Transport Museum also runs guided tours of the disused platforms, corridors, and concourse as part of its Hidden London programme, which takes the public to closed-off parts of the Underground network.

===Proposal for connection to Docklands Light Railway===
In July 2005, a report, &quot;DLR Horizon 2020 Study&quot;, for the Docklands Light Railway (DLR) examined &quot;pragmatic development schemes&quot; to expand and improve the DLR network between 2012 and 2020. One of the proposals was an extension of the DLR from Bank to Charing Cross. The unused tunnels under Strand would be enlarged to accommodate the larger DLR trains. In 2011, the DLR published a proposal to continue the extension to Victoria via Green Park. No further work has been done on these proposals.

===Ticket hall refurbishment and closure of subways===

In 2016 and 2017, the two ticket halls were separately closed for refurbishment. In each one, interior finishes and lighting were replaced and new ticket barriers were installed. The Northern line ticket hall closed in September 2016 and was scheduled to reopen in July 2017, but reopened a month earlier. Following its reopening, Northern line Night Tube services began stopping at the station on 30 June 2017. They had been introduced on the line in November 2016, but did not serve Charing Cross until the Northern line ticket hall reopened.

In June 2020 a planning approval was granted to close the subways to Adelaide Street, William IV Street and the north side of Strand and convert the space to office and retail use linked to the building above.

<text>The International Democracy Union (IDU; known as the International Democrat Union until September 2023) is an international alliance of centre-right to right-wing political parties. Headquartered in Munich, Germany, the IDU consists of 84 full and associate members from 65 countries. It is chaired by Stephen Harper, former prime minister of Canada. It has two affiliated international organizations (International Young Democrat Union and International Women&#x27;s Democracy Union) and six affiliated regional organizations (Union of Latin American Parties, Asia Pacific Democrat Union, Caribbean Democrat Union, Democrat Union of Africa, European People&#x27;s Party and European Conservatives and Reformists Party).

The IDU allows &quot;centre-right&quot; conservative political parties around the world to establish contacts and discuss different views on public policy and related matters. Their stated goal is the promotion of &quot;democracy and [of] centre-right policies around the globe&quot;. The IDU has some overlap of member parties with the Centrist Democrat International (CDI), but the CDI is more centrist, Christian democrat and communitarian than the IDU.

The group was founded in 1983 as the umbrella organisation for the European Democrat Union (EDU), Caribbean Democrat Union (CDU), and the Asia Pacific Democrat Union (APDU). Created at the instigation of the Konrad Adenauer Foundation and U.S. Vice President George H. W. Bush, the organisation was founded at a joint meeting of the EDU and APDU in London, United Kingdom.

==Founding==
The IDU was founded in London on 24 June 1983. According to Richard V. Allen, to be admitted as a member, a party must qualify as a &quot;mainstream conservative&quot; party influenced by classical liberalism.

The founding declaration was signed by 19 persons:

<text>Evangelista Torricelli ( ; ; 15 October 160825 October 1647) was an Italian physicist and mathematician, and a student of Galileo. He is best known for his invention of the barometer, but is also known for his advances in optics and work on the method of indivisibles. The torr is named after him.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Torricelli was born on 15 October 1608 in Rome, the firstborn child of Gaspare Ruberti and Giacoma Torricelli. His family was from Faenza in the Province of Ravenna, then part of the Papal States. His father was a textile worker and the family was very poor. Seeing his talents, his parents sent him to be educated in Faenza, under the care of his uncle, Giacomo (James), a Camaldolese monk, who first ensured that his nephew was given a sound basic education. He then entered young Torricelli into a Jesuit College in 1624, possibly the one in Faenza itself, to study mathematics and philosophy until 1626, by which time his father, Gaspare, had died. The uncle then sent Torricelli to Rome to study science under the Benedictine monk Benedetto Castelli, professor of mathematics at the Collegio della Sapienza (now known as the Sapienza University of Rome). Castelli was a student of Galileo Galilei. &quot;Benedetto Castelli made experiments on running water (1628), and he was entrusted by Pope Urban VIII with hydraulic undertakings.&quot; There is no actual evidence that Torricelli was enrolled at the university. It is almost certain that Torricelli was taught by Castelli. In exchange he worked for him as his secretary from 1626 to 1632 in a private arrangement. Because of this, Torricelli was exposed to experiments funded by Pope Urban VIII. While living in Rome, Torricelli became also the student of the mathematician Bonaventura Cavalieri, with whom he became great friends. It was in Rome that Torricelli also became friends with two other students of Castelli, Raffaello Magiotti and Antonio Nardi. Galileo referred to Torricelli, Magiotti, and Nardi affectionately as his &quot;triumvirate&quot; in Rome.

===Career===

In 1632, shortly after the publication of Galileo&#x27;s &quot;Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems&quot;, Torricelli wrote to Galileo of reading it &quot;with the delight ... of one who, having already practiced all of geometry most diligently ... and having studied Ptolemy and seen almost everything of Tycho Brahe, Kepler and Longomontanus, finally, forced by the many congruences, came to adhere to Copernicus, and was a Galileian in profession and sect&quot;. (The Vatican condemned Galileo in June 1633, and this was the only known occasion on which Torricelli openly declared himself to hold the Copernican view.)

Aside from several letters, little is known of Torricelli&#x27;s activities in the years between 1632 and 1641, when Castelli sent Torricelli&#x27;s monograph of the path of projectiles to Galileo, then a prisoner in his villa at Arcetri. Although Galileo promptly invited Torricelli to visit, Torricelli did not accept until just three months before Galileo&#x27;s death. The reason for this was that Torricelli&#x27;s mother, Caterina Angetti died. &quot;(T)his short intercourse with the great mathematician enabled Torricelli to finish the fifth dialogue under the personal direction of its author; it was published by Viviani, another pupil of Galileo, in 1674.&quot; After Galileo&#x27;s death on 8 January 1642, Grand Duke Ferdinando II de&#x27; Medici asked Torricelli to succeed Galileo as the grand-ducal mathematician and chair of mathematics at the University of Pisa. Right before the appointment, Torricelli was considering returning to Rome because of there being nothing left for him in Florence, where he had invented the barometer. In this new role he solved some of the great mathematical problems of the day, such as finding a cycloid&#x27;s area and center of gravity. As a result of this study, he wrote the book the &quot;Opera Geometrica&quot; in which he described his observations. The book was published in 1644.

Little was known about Torricelli in regard to his works in geometry when he accepted the honorable position, but after he published &quot;Opera Geometrica&quot; two years later, he became highly esteemed in that discipline. &quot;He was interested in Optics, and invented a method whereby microscopic lenses might be made of glass which could be easily melted in a lamp.&quot; As a result, he designed and built a number of telescopes and simple microscopes; several large lenses, engraved with his name, are still preserved in Florence. On 11 June 1644, he famously wrote in a letter to Michelangelo Ricci: 

However his work on the cycloid involved him in a controversy with Gilles de Roberval, who accused him of plagiarizing his earlier solution of the problem of its quadrature. Although it appears that Torricelli reached his solution independently, the matter was still in dispute up to his death.

===Death===

Torricelli died of fever, most likely typhoid, in Florence on 25 October 1647, 10 days after his 39th birthday, and was buried at the Basilica of San Lorenzo. He left all his belongings to his adopted son Alessandro. &quot;Belonging to that first period are his pamphlets on Solidi spherali, Contatti and the major part of the propositions and sundry problems which were gathered together by Viviani after Torricelli&#x27;s death. This early work owes much to the study of the classics.&quot; Sixty-eight years after Torricelli had died, his genius still filled his contemporaries with admiration, as evidenced by the anagram below the frontispice of Lezioni accademiche d&#x27;Evangelista Torricelli published in 1715: En virescit Galileus alter, meaning &quot;Here blossoms another Galileo.&quot;

===Honours===
In Faenza, a statue of Torricelli was created in 1868 in gratitude for all that Torricelli had done in advancing science during his short lifetime.

The asteroid 7437 Torricelli and a crater on the Moon were named in his honour.

The mountain range Torricelli Mountains on New Guinea carry his name.

In 1830, botanist Augustin Pyramus de Candolle published &quot;Torricellia&quot;, which is a genus of flowering plants from Asia belonging to the family Torricelliaceae. They were named in Evangelista Torricelli&#x27;s honour.

== Torricelli&#x27;s work in physics ==
The perusal of Galileo&#x27;s &quot;Two New Sciences&quot; (1638) inspired Torricelli with many developments of the mechanical principles there set forth, which he embodied in a treatise &quot;De motu&quot; (printed amongst his &quot;Opera geometrica&quot;, 1644). Its communication by Castelli to Galileo in 1641, with a proposal that Torricelli should reside with him, led to Torricelli traveling to Florence, where he met Galileo, and acted as his amanuensis during the three remaining months of his life.

===Suction pumps and the invention of the barometer ===

Torricelli&#x27;s work led to first speculations about atmospheric pressure, and to the corollary invention of the mercury barometer (from the Greek word baros, meaning weight) -- the principle of which was described as early as 1631 by René Descartes, although there is no evidence that Descartes ever built such an instrument.

The barometer arose from the need to solve a theoretical and practical problem: a suction pump could only raise water up to a height of 10 metres (34 ft) (as recounted in Galileo&#x27;s &quot;Two New Sciences&quot;). In the early 1600s, Torricelli&#x27;s teacher, Galileo, argued that suction pumps were able to draw water from a well because of the &quot;force of vacuum.&quot; This argument, however, failed to explain the fact that suction pumps could only raise water to a height of 10 metres.

After Galileo&#x27;s death, Torricelli proposed, rather, that we live in a &quot;sea of air&quot; that exerts a pressure analogous in many ways to the pressure of water on submerged objects. According to this hypothesis, at sea level, the air in the atmosphere has weight that roughly equals the weight of a 10-meter column of water. When a suction pump creates a vacuum inside a tube, the atmosphere no longer pushes on the water column below the piston but still pushes down on the surface of the water outside, thus causing the water to rise until its weight counterbalances the weight of the atmosphere. This hypothesis might have led him to a striking prediction: That a suction pump might only raise mercury, which is 13 times heavier than water, to 1/13 the height of the water column (76 centimeters) in a similar pump. (It is possible however that Torricelli carried out the mercury experiment first, and then formulated his sea of air hypothesis).

In 1643, Torricelli filled a meter-long tube (with one end sealed off) with mercury—thirteen times denser than water—and set the open end of the tube into a basin of the liquid metal and raised the sealed end so the tube stood vertically. The mercury level in the tube fell until it was about above the surface of the mercury basin, producing a Torricellian vacuum above. This was also the first recorded incident of creating permanent vacuum.
A second unambiguous prediction of Torricelli&#x27;s sea of air hypothesis was made by Blaise Pascal, who argued, and proved, that the mercury column of the barometer should drop at higher elevations. Indeed, it dropped slightly on top of a 50-meter bell tower, and much more so at the peak of a 1460-meter mountain.

As we know now, the column&#x27;s height fluctuates with atmospheric pressure at the same location, a fact which plays a key role in weather forecasting. Baseline changes in the column&#x27;s height at different elevations, in turn, underlie the principle of the altimeter. Thus, this work laid the foundations for the modern concept of atmospheric pressure, the first barometer, an instrument that would later play a key role in weather forecasting, and the first pressure altimeter, which measures altitude and is often used in hiking, climbing, skiing, and aviation.

The solution to the suction pump puzzle and the discovery of the principle of the barometer and altimeter have perpetuated Torricelli&#x27;s fame with terms such as &quot;Torricellian tube&quot; and &quot;Torricellian vacuum&quot;. The torr, a unit of pressure used in vacuum measurements, is named after him.

===Torricelli&#x27;s law===
Torricelli also discovered a law, regarding the speed of a fluid flowing out of an opening, which was later shown to be a particular case of Bernoulli&#x27;s principle. He found that water leaks out a small hole in the bottom of a container at a rate proportional to the square root of the depth of the water. So if the container is an upright cylinder with a small leak at the bottom and &quot;y&quot; is the depth of the water at time &quot;t&quot;, then
:formula_1

for some constant &quot;k&quot; &gt; 0.

===Torricelli&#x27;s principle===
The concept of center of gravity was discovered by Archimedes. Torricelli, following in his footsteps, discovered an important new principle, Torricelli&#x27;s principle, which says: if any number of bodies be so connected that, by their motion, their centre of gravity can neither ascend nor descend, then those bodies are in equilibrium. This is essentially a version of the principle of virtual work. This principle was later used by Christiaan Huygens to study pendulum motion.

===The study of projectiles===
Torricelli studied projectiles and how they traveled through the air. &quot;Perhaps his most notable achievement in the field of projectiles was to establish for the first time the idea of an envelope: projectiles sent out at [...] the same speed in all directions trace out parabolas which are all tangent to a common paraboloid. This envelope became known as the &quot;parabola di sicurezza&quot; (parabola of safety).&quot;

===Cause of wind===
Torricelli gave the first scientific description of the cause of wind:

== Torricelli&#x27;s work in mathematics ==
Torricelli is also famous for the discovery of the &quot;Torricelli&#x27;s trumpet&quot; (also - perhaps more often - known as Gabriel&#x27;s Horn) whose surface area is infinite, but whose volume is finite. This was seen as an &quot;incredible&quot; paradox by many at the time, including Torricelli himself, and prompted a fierce controversy about the nature of infinity, also involving the philosopher Hobbes.

Torricelli was also a pioneer in the area of infinite series. In his &quot;De dimensione parabolae&quot; of 1644, Torricelli considered a decreasing sequence of positive terms formula_2 and showed the corresponding telescoping series formula_3 necessarily converges to formula_4, where &quot;L&quot; is the limit of the sequence, and in this way gives a proof of the formula for the sum of a geometric series.

Torricelli developed further the method of indivisibles of Cavalieri. Many 17th century mathematicians learned of the method through Torricelli whose writing was more accessible than Cavalieri&#x27;s.

==Italian submarines==

Several Italian Navy submarines were named after Evangelista Torricelli:

* A &quot;Micca&quot; class submarine, built in 1918, stricken in 1930
* An &quot;Archimede&quot; class submarine (1934), transferred to Spain in 1937 and renamed &quot;General Mola&quot;, stricken in 1959
* A &quot;Benedetto Brin&quot; class submarine (1937), sank in the Red Sea due to the British Navy in 1940
* &quot;Evangelista Torricelli&quot;, the former USS &quot;Lizardfish&quot;, transferred to Italy in 1960 and decommissioned in 1976

== Selected works ==
His original manuscripts are preserved at Florence, Italy. The following have appeared in print:

* &quot;Trattato del moto&quot; (before 1641)
* &quot;Opera geometrica&quot; (1644)
* &quot;Lezioni accademiche&quot; (Firenze, 1715)

<text>Embankment is a London Underground station in the City of Westminster, known by various names during its history. It is served by four lines: Bakerloo, Circle, District and Northern. On the Bakerloo line and the Charing Cross branch of the Northern line, the station is between Charing Cross and Waterloo stations. On the Circle and District lines, it is between Westminster and Temple stations. It is located in Travelcard Zone 1. The station has two entrances, one on Victoria Embankment and the other on Villiers Street. The station is adjacent to Victoria Embankment Gardens and is close to Charing Cross station, Embankment Pier, Hungerford Bridge, Cleopatra&#x27;s Needle, the Royal Air Force Memorial, the Savoy Chapel and Savoy Hotel and the Playhouse and New Players Theatres.

The station is in two parts: sub-surface platforms opened on 30 May 1870 by the District Railway (DR) as part of the company&#x27;s extension of the &quot;Inner Circle&quot; eastwards from Westminster to Blackfriars and deep-level platforms opened in 1906 by the Baker Street and Waterloo Railway (BS&amp;WR) and 6 April 1914 by the Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railway (CCE&amp;HR). A variety of underground and main line services have operated over the sub-surface tracks and the CCE&amp;HR part of the station was reconstructed in the 1920s.

==History==

===Sub-surface station===
The station was opened on 30 May 1870 by the DR (now the District line) when the railway extended its line from Westminster to Blackfriars. The construction of the new section of the DR was planned in conjunction with the building of the Victoria Embankment and was achieved by the cut and cover method of roofing over a trench. Due to its proximity to the South Eastern Railway&#x27;s Charing Cross station, the station was originally called &quot;Charing Cross&quot;.

The DR connected to the MR (now the Metropolitan line) at South Kensington and, although the two companies were rivals, each company operated its trains over the other&#x27;s tracks in a joint service known as the &quot;Inner Circle&quot;. On 1 February 1872, the DR opened a northbound branch from its station at Earl&#x27;s Court to connect to the West London Extension Joint Railway (WLEJR, now the West London Line) at Addison Road (now Kensington (Olympia)). From that date the &quot;Outer Circle&quot; service began running over the DR&#x27;s tracks. The service was run by the North London Railway (NLR) from its terminus at Broad Street (now demolished) in the City of London via the North London Line to Willesden Junction, then the West London Line to Addison Road and the DR to Mansion House – at that time the eastern terminus of the DR.

From 1 August 1872, the &quot;Middle Circle&quot; service also began operations through South Kensington, running from Moorgate along the MR&#x27;s tracks on the north side of the Inner Circle to Paddington, then over the Hammersmith &amp; City Railway (H&amp;CR) track to Latimer Road, then, via a now demolished link, on the WLEJR to Addison Road and the DR to Mansion House. The service was operated jointly by the H&amp;CR and the DR.

On 30 June 1900, the Middle Circle service was shortened to terminate at Earl&#x27;s Court, and, on 31 December 1908, the Outer Circle service was withdrawn from the DR tracks. In 1949, the Metropolitan line-operated Inner Circle route was given its own identity on the tube map as the Circle line.

===Deep-level station===
In 1897 the DR obtained parliamentary permission to construct a deep-level tube railway running between Gloucester Road and Mansion House beneath the sub-surface line. The new line was to be an express route using electric trains to relieve congestion on the sub-surface tracks. Only one intermediate station was planned, at Charing Cross, below the sub-surface platforms. No immediate work was carried out on the deep-level line, and the subsequent take over of the DR by the Underground Electric Railways Company of London (UERL) and the resignalling and electrification of the DR&#x27;s routes between 1903 and 1905 meant that congestion was relieved without needing to construct the deep-level line. The plan was dropped in 1908.

On 10 March 1906, the BS&amp;WR (now the Bakerloo line) opened with its deep-level platforms beneath and at ninety degrees to the platforms of the DR. Although an interchange was provided between the two separate railways, the BS&amp;WR named its station differently as &quot;Embankment&quot;.

On 6 April 1914, the CCE&amp;HR (now a part of the Northern line) opened a one stop extension south from its terminus at Charing Cross. The extension was constructed to facilitate a better interchange between the BS&amp;WR and CCE&amp;HR. Both lines were owned by the UERL which operated two separate and unconnected stations at the northern end of main line station – &quot;Trafalgar Square&quot; on the BS&amp;WR and &quot;Charing Cross&quot; on the CCE&amp;HR (both now part of a combined Charing Cross station). The CCE&amp;HR extension was constructed as a single track tunnel running south from Charing Cross as a loop under the River Thames and back. A single platform was constructed on the northbound return section of the loop, and escalators were installed between both sets of deep-level platforms and the sub-surface station. The interchange time was reduced from three minutes fifteen seconds to one minute and forty-five seconds.

A new station building was constructed that Sir John Betjeman described as &quot;the most charming of all the Edwardian and neo-Georgian Renaissance stations.&quot; For the opening of the CCE&amp;HR extension, the deep-level parts of the station were named &quot;Charing Cross (Embankment)&quot; although the sub-surface platforms remained as &quot;Charing Cross&quot;. In 1915, this was rectified by changing the name of the whole station to &quot;Charing Cross&quot;. The CCE&amp;HR station to the north was renamed &quot;Strand&quot; at the same time (causing a nearby station of the GNP&amp;BR to change its name from &quot;Strand&quot; to &quot;Aldwych&quot;).

In the 1920s, as part of the construction of what is now the Northern line, the CCE&amp;HR was extended south to Waterloo and Kennington where it was connected to the City &amp; South London Railway. The loop tunnel under the river was abandoned (although the present northbound Northern line platform follows its course) and two new tunnels were bored south. To this day the southbound Northern line platform is the only one of the four deep level platforms that is not connected to any of the others by deep level walkways, being accessible only from the &quot;mid concourse level&quot;. The new extension was opened on 13 September 1926.

The loop itself still exists, although it was penetrated by a bomb and flooded during the Blitz in the Second World War. The loop had been sealed off years before. In September 1938, during the Sudeten Crisis, when war appeared imminent, the Bakerloo and Northern line tunnels at Embankment were temporarily sealed with concrete to protect against flooding through bombing. The blockage was removed after little more than a week once the crisis had passed. At the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, the tunnels were blocked again until electrically powered emergency doors could be installed in the tunnel mouths. The tunnels reopened in December 1939.

On 4 August 1974, the station was once again renamed &quot;Charing Cross Embankment&quot;. Then, on 12 September 1976, it became &quot;Embankment&quot;, so that the merged &quot;Strand&quot; and &quot;Trafalgar Square&quot; stations could be named Charing Cross.

In 1984–5 the station was upgraded, and public art in the form of coloured lines, by the artist Robyn Denny, were installed on the platforms and passageways of the station.

From January until November 2014, access to the Bakerloo and Northern Line was closed whilst the replacement of the 80-year-old escalators took place

Embankment&#x27;s northbound Northern line platform remains the only place on the network where Oswald Laurence&#x27;s &#x27;Mind the gap&#x27; announcement can still be heard, having been reinstated in 2013 at the request of Laurence&#x27;s widow.

===Fatal accident===

At about 09:55 on 17 May 1938, an eastbound Inner Circle train collided with an eastbound Ealing Broadway–Barking District line train to the east of the station. The Barking train had been stopped at an automatic signal on its way to Temple station. Six passengers were killed and 43 injured. The cause of the accident was a faulty signal, which showed a green &quot;proceed&quot; aspect to the second train even though the line ahead was not clear. This was a result of a wrong connection made during the previous night when some minor alterations to wiring were made.

==Services==
Embankment station is on the Bakerloo, Circle, District and Northern lines in London fare zone 1. On the Circle and District lines, the station is between Westminster and Temple. On the Bakerloo line and the Charing Cross branch of the Northern line, it is between Charing Cross and Waterloo. The Circle and District lines share the same platforms at Embankment, but the Bakerloo and Northern lines each have their own platforms.

<text>Karel Reisz (21 July 1926 – 25 November 2002) was a Czech-born British filmmaker and film critic, one of the pioneers of the new realist strain in British cinema during the 1950s and 1960s. Two of the best-known films he directed are &quot;Saturday Night and Sunday Morning&quot; (1960), a classic of kitchen sink realism, and the romantic period drama &quot;The French Lieutenant&#x27;s Woman&quot; (1981).

==Early life==
Reisz was born in Ostrava, Czechoslovakia, to a family of Jewish ancestry. His father was a lawyer. Reisz became a refugee, one of the 669 children rescued and evacuated from the country by Sir Nicholas Winton.

He was transported to England in 1938, speaking almost no English, and he eradicated his foreign accent as quickly as possible. After attending Leighton Park School, he joined the Royal Air Force toward the end of the war. After the war ended, he learned that both his parents were murdered at Auschwitz. Following his war service, Reisz read Natural Sciences at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, and began to write for film journals, including &quot;Sight and Sound&quot;. He co-founded &quot;Sequence&quot; in 1947 with Lindsay Anderson and Gavin Lambert.

==Career==
===Free Cinema===
Reisz was a founder member of the Free Cinema documentary film movement. His book &quot;The Technique of Film Editing&quot; was first published in 1953, and became a standard textbook in the field.

His first short film, &quot;Momma Don&#x27;t Allow&quot; (1955), co-written and co-directed with Tony Richardson, was included in the first Free Cinema program shown at the National Film Theatre in February 1956. The next year he produced &quot;Every Day Except Christmas&quot; (1957), directed by Lindsay Anderson, followed by &quot;Band Wagon&quot; (1958).

Reisz and Anderson produced and directed &quot;March to Aldermaston&quot; (1959). Reisz alone directed &quot;We Are the Lambeth Boys&quot; (1959), a naturalistic depiction of the members of a South London boys&#x27; club, unusual in showing the leisure life of working-class teenagers, with skiffle music and cigarettes, cricket, drawing, and discussion groups. The film was chosen to represent Britain at the Venice Film Festival. (The BBC made two follow-up films about the same people and youth club, broadcast in 1985.) Reisz also produced &quot;I Want to Go to School&quot; (1959), directed by John Krish.

===Early features===
Reisz&#x27;s first feature film, &quot;Saturday Night and Sunday Morning&quot; (1960), was based on the social-realism novel by Alan Sillitoe, and used many of the same techniques as his earlier documentaries. In particular, scenes filmed at the Raleigh factory in Nottingham have the look of a documentary, and give the story a vivid sense of verisimilitude. The film won the Grand Award for Best Feature Film at the 1961 Mar del Plata International Film Festival. It was successful at the box office and made a film star of Albert Finney.

Reisz directed a TV series, &quot;Adventure Story&quot; (1961). He produced Anderson&#x27;s feature directorial debut &quot;This Sporting Life&quot; (1963), then he and Finney reunited on &quot;Night Must Fall&quot; (1964).

Reisz directed &quot;Morgan – A Suitable Case for Treatment&quot; (1966) adapted by David Mercer from his 1962 television play.

His fourth feature as director was &quot;Isadora&quot; (1968), a biography of dancer Isadora Duncan, with a screenplay by Melvyn Bragg that starred Vanessa Redgrave.

Reisz joined the British Film Institute&#x27;s Board of Governors in 1969 with the aim of bolstering support for independent British directors, but left the role after only a year.

===Hollywood===
Reisz&#x27;s first film shot in America was &quot;The Gambler&quot; (1974) with James Caan.

He made &quot;Who&#x27;ll Stop the Rain&quot; (1978) with Nick Nolte and Tuesday Weld. He was meant to follow it with an adaptation of Brian Moore&#x27;s novel &quot;The Doctor&#x27;s Wife&quot; based on a script by Joe Eszterhas, but the film was never made.

Back in London, Reisz directed &quot;The French Lieutenant&#x27;s Woman&quot; (1981), which was perhaps the most successful of his later films. Adapted from the John Fowles novel by Harold Pinter, it starred Jeremy Irons and Meryl Streep. In 1982, Reisz directed John Guare&#x27;s &quot;Gardenia Dreams&quot; on stage in Boston.

He directed &quot;Sweet Dreams&quot; (1985), based on the life of country singer Patsy Cline, starring Jessica Lange. After it, he made a script about Libby Holman for Ray Stark, but it was never produced.

===Later career===
Reisz&#x27;s last feature was &quot;Everybody Wins&quot; (1990), with a screenplay by Arthur Miller, and based on his play.

From 1991 to 2001, Reisz focused on theatre directing in London, Dublin and Paris. He directed an adaptation of &quot;The Deep Blue Sea&quot; (1994) for British TV. In 1995, he directed &quot;Moonlight&quot; by Harold Pinter, starring Jason Robards and Blythe Danner. At a Beckett festival at the Lincoln Center in 1996, he directed &quot;Happy Days&quot;. In 1999, he did Pinter&#x27;s &quot;Ashes to Ashes (play)Ashes to Ashes&quot;, featuring Lindsay Duncan and David Strathairn, with the Roundabout Theater Company. At the Pinter Festival at the Lincoln Center in 2001, he staged &quot;A Kind of Alaska&quot; and &quot;Landscape&quot;. When the Gate Theatre filmed all Beckett&#x27;s stage plays, Reisz did &quot;Act Without Words I&quot; (2001).

==Personal life==

Reisz had three sons by his first wife Julia Coppard, whom he later divorced. Reisz wed Betsy Blair, the former wife of Gene Kelly, in 1963, and remained married to her until his death.

<doc id="210425" wikidata="Q28647560" url="?curid=210425" title="Cheeta">
<text>Cheeta (sometimes billed as Cheetah, Cheta, and Chita) is a chimpanzee character that appeared in numerous Hollywood Tarzan films of the 1930s–1960s, as well as the 1966–1968 television series, as the ape sidekick of the title character, Tarzan. Cheeta has usually been characterized as male, but sometimes as female, and has been portrayed by chimpanzees of both sexes.

While the character of Cheeta is inextricably associated in the public mind with Tarzan, no chimpanzees appear in the original Tarzan novels by Edgar Rice Burroughs that inspired the films. The closest analog to Cheeta in the Burroughs novels is Tarzan&#x27;s monkey companion Nkima, who appears in several of the later books in the series.

==Role==
Cheeta&#x27;s role in the Tarzan films and TV series is to provide comic relief, convey messages between Tarzan and his allies, and occasionally lead Tarzan&#x27;s other animal friends to the ape-man&#x27;s rescue.

==Portrayers of the character==
The character of Cheeta was a composite role created through the use of numerous animal actors, over a dozen according to one source. According to journalist R. D. Rosen, &quot;In each Tarzan movie, the Cheeta role [was] played by more than one chimp, depending on what talents the scene called for.&quot; Known and alleged performers of the role are given in the following table (see the comments following the table for the sources of the data).

More details about these performers:

* Jiggs, a male chimpanzee born about 1929 owned and trained by Tony and Jacqueline Gentry, originated the role and appeared in the first two Johnny Weissmuller Tarzan films, &quot;Tarzan the Ape Man&quot; (1932) and &quot;Tarzan and His Mate&quot; (1934), as well as the Tarzan serials &quot;Tarzan the Fearless&quot; (1933), starring Buster Crabbe, and &quot;The New Adventures of Tarzan&quot; (1935), starring Herman Brix, which was also released in feature-film form as &quot;Tarzan and the Green Goddess&quot; (1938). In the Brix films, which were more faithful to Edgar Rice Burroughs&#x27; original stories than the Weissmuller ones, Jiggs was cast as Nkima, not Cheeta. He also appeared in the Laurel and Hardy film &quot;Dirty Work&quot; (1933), and &quot;Her Jungle Love&quot; (1938), starring Dorothy Lamour, his last film. Jiggs died on February 28, 1938 or March 1, 1938 at age 9, of pneumonia, and was buried March 2, 1938, in the Los Angeles Pet Cemetery. Not to be confused with Captain Jiggs, a well-known contemporary chimpanzee owned by Gertrude Davies Lintz, or with Mr. Jiggs, an orangutan who appeared in &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; (1942) and numerous other films, that was retired in May, 1943.
* Jacky I, a male chimpanzee owned by Gertrude Davies Lintz for two years before appearing with Johnny Weissmuller in the latter&#x27;s first Tarzan film
* David Holt, who as a six-year-old child actor appeared uncredited as a human double for the role in &quot;Tarzan the Fearless&quot; (1933).
* Cheetah-Mike (also known as Org) was a male chimpanzee owned by Suncoast Primate Sanctuary after being donated from Noell&#x27;s Chimp Farm in Palm Harbor, Florida. Alleged to have been born about 1931 (claimed age in February 2008 was 77), to have been acquired from the estate of Johnny Weissmuller in 1957, and to have been &quot;one of the original &#x27;Cheetahs&#x27; from Johnny Weissmuller&#x27;s &quot;Tarzan&quot; movies.&quot; It has been speculated that this chimpanzee, if he indeed has any connection to Weissmuller, may actually have come from a Florida tourist attraction the actor once launched that included chimpanzees, rather than having appeared in any of his Tarzan films. According to journalist Andrew Woods, this Cheeta was also known as Org. He died in Palm Harbor, Florida, of kidney failure on December 24, 2011.
* Jiggs, Jr. (also known as Jiggs II) was a male chimpanzee born about 1935 owned and trained by Tony and Jacqueline Gentry, alleged to have appeared in a number of &quot;Tarzan&quot; films and possibly other movies. He was stated to have gone to the Baltimore Zoo when Gentry went into the service in World War II. His ultimate fate is unknown.
* Unknown 1 was a chimpanzee stated to have been a juvenile understudy to Jiggs in one of the Weissmuller Tarzan films, that on one occasion accompanied Weissmuller and a 14-foot boa constrictor on a visit to newspaper columnist Nelson B. Bell.
* Skippy was a chimpanzee that reportedly &quot;took over when Jiggs died in the late 1930s.&quot;
* Unknown 2 was a chimpanzee stated to have portrayed Cheeta for 10 years from around 1933 until retirement in 1943, possibly the same as the above. This Cheeta&#x27;s last film was presumably &quot;Tarzan&#x27;s Desert Mystery&quot; (1943), as the first film of its successor was &quot;Tarzan and the Amazons&quot; (1945).
* Jacky III was a male chimpanzee formerly owned by Gertrude Davies Lintz, that appeared &quot;in the &#x27;Tarzan&#x27; film released in early 1942&quot; (presumably &quot;Tarzan&#x27;s Secret Treasure&quot;, released December 1, 1941, or &quot;Tarzan&#x27;s New York Adventure&quot;, released in May 1942).
* Cheta was a chimpanzee of undetermined sex born about 1937 trained by George Emerson, stated to be the current chimpanzee under contract by Metro for the Tarzan films in March, 1943.
* Unknown 3 was a chimpanzee stated to have replaced the 1933–1943 Cheeta, cast in 1944 with a trainer from the St. Louis Zoo hired as handler for &quot;Tarzan and the Amazons&quot; (1945).
* Unknown 4 was a chimpanzee trained by Albert Antonucci that had apparently played Cheeta for three years as of April, 1949; Antonucci is known to have been Cheeta&#x27;s trainer for the films &quot;Tarzan and the Huntress&quot; (1947) and &quot;Tarzan&#x27;s Magic Fountain&quot; (1949), so presumably this Cheeta played in these films and the intervening &quot;Tarzan and the Mermaids&quot; (1948); Antonucci himself was stated to be slated for an acting role in the next Tarzan film, to be titled &quot;Tarzan and the Golden Lion&quot;, presumably a working title for the actual next film in the series, &quot;Tarzan and the Slave Girl&quot; (1950), but if so, his role was uncredited or performed under a stage name. Whether he continued to serve as Cheeta&#x27;s handler in that film, or indeed whether &quot;his&quot; Cheeta was the one who appeared in it, is unknown.
* Harry was a male chimpanzee born about 1944, possibly the same as the above, stated to be playing Cheeta in the Tarzan films in May, 1948.
* Cheeta was a chimpanzee owned and trained by Pinky Jackson, who made personal appearances in promotion of the Tarzan films at six Sidney Lust theaters in Maryland in early December, 1950. Possibly, he was the Cheeta that appeared in the then-current Tarzan film, &quot;Tarzan and the Slave Girl&quot; (1950), or may have been retained only for the promotional appearances.
* Cheeta, a female chimpanzee born about 1948 owned by Ed Rogers, is stated to have appeared in 42 films, including Tarzan films as Cheeta and the television program &quot;Truth or Consequences&quot; as Beaulah. She died at age 9 on September 6, 1957, in Cypress, California, shot by deputy sheriffs after breaking out of her cage, attacking her owner, and charging at a group of children.
* Zippy was a male chimpanzee born about 1951, owned and trained by Ralph Quinlan, and is stated to have appeared as Cheeta in Tarzan films of the mid-1950s, including the Gordon Scott film &quot;Tarzan&#x27;s Hidden Jungle&quot; (1955).
* Dinky was a female chimpanzee that appeared under that name in &quot;Tarzan and the Valley of Gold&quot; (1966) and as Cheeta in the &quot;Tarzan and the Great River&quot; (1967); both movies were filmed in 1965. She bit Mike Henry, the actor playing Tarzan, during the filming of the latter, after which she was put down; Henry later sued the producers for this accident and other unsafe working conditions on his three &quot;Tarzan&quot; films.
* Cheetah was the chimpanzee appearing with Ron Ely in the 1966–1968 &quot;Tarzan&quot; TV series, said to be the only trained animal on the show.
* C.J., a male orangutan, is stated to have played Cheeta in the 1981 remake &quot;Tarzan, the Ape Man&quot;, and (more famously) Clyde in the 1978 Clint Eastwood film &quot;Every Which Way But Loose&quot;; however, the Clyde role has elsewhere been attributed to Manis, a different orangutan.
* Cheeta (also known as Jiggs IV) was a male chimpanzee born about 1960, formerly owned by Tony Gentry and had resided at the C.H.E.E.T.A. Primate Sanctuary (Creative Habitats and Enrichment for Endangered and Threatened Apes) in Palm Springs, California. He was claimed by Gentry to have been born in 1932 or later in the 1930s, and to have portrayed Cheeta in most of the Johnny Weissmuller and Lex Barker &quot;Tarzan&quot; films, and for that reason long celebrated as the longest-lived chimpanzee on reaching the supposed age of 64 in 1996 (chimpanzees typically live to be 35 in the wild). Both claims were debunked by journalist R. D. Rosen in 2008 in an article that settled the animal&#x27;s true age and established that he had not appeared in any movies, let alone in the role of Cheeta. However, he did appear as Cheeta in the TV movie &quot;07 Spaceys&quot; and a news segment featuring his &quot;75th&quot; birthday, both in 2007, and the documentary &quot;See No Evil&quot; in 2014. According to journalist Andrew Woods, who &quot;interviewed&quot; this Cheeta in 2008, his &quot;offstage&quot; name is Jiggs IV. Following Gentry&#x27;s death in 1991, Jiggs IV was adopted by his nephew Dan Westfall. On May 5, 2022, Jiggs IV died at the C.H.E.E.T.A. sanctuary in Palm Springs, California.

==Tony Gentry&#x27;s Cheeta hoax==
Late in his life, Tony Gentry, who had been the co-owner and trainer of the original Cheeta (Jiggs), made extravagant claims in regard to another chimpanzee he owned and its connection with the Cheeta role. This animal, known as both Cheeta and Jiggs IV, was falsely alleged by Gentry to have been the primary animal actor portraying Cheeta in the Tarzan movies over the years. He also greatly exaggerated the age of the animal to support this claim. For a number of years both before and after Gentry&#x27;s death this story passed unexamined and became a matter of general belief.

===Gentry&#x27;s allegations===
Tony Gentry made various claims regarding Cheeta&#x27;s (Jiggs IV) age, origins, and supposed movie roles. Some of these claims conflicted with each other.

In the usually related account, Gentry originally acquired the animal by purchase from Henry Trefflich, a New York animal importer and dealer. Cheeta was supposedly born in the wild in Liberia some months prior to 9 April 1932, which is celebrated as his birthday because it is the date he is said to have arrived in the United States, in New York City. Other accounts of Cheeta&#x27;s origins from Gentry include having found the animal himself in the Belgian Congo in 1932 or having bought him in Santa Monica about 1938 or in the late 1940s.

Gentry&#x27;s acquaintances and fellow animal trainers Hubert Wells, Stewart Raffill, and Cheryl Shawver have disputed all of these accounts, stating that &quot;Tony got that chimp from Wally Ross ... one of the managers of Pacific Ocean Park on the pier in Santa Monica&quot; when the park closed in 1967. According to them, Cheeta was only about 6 or 7 years old at that time, which would put his birthdate around 1960 or 1961 rather than 1932.

Gentry claimed Cheeta/Jiggs IV was the primary animal actor used in the role of Cheeta in the Tarzan movies. His first appearance as Cheeta is usually stated to have been in the second Johnny Weissmuller Tarzan film, &quot;Tarzan and His Mate&quot; (1934), uncredited as a young chimpanzee riding on the back of the older chimp (Jiggs) who originated the role. He was then allegedly cast in the role himself in the other Weissmuller Tarzans that followed, as well as the succeeding Lex Barker Tarzan films. Journalist R. D. Rosen, who investigated this story, counters that this animal in fact never appeared in any Tarzan film.

Besides his supposed role as Cheeta in the Tarzan films, Cheeta/Jiggs IV reputedly appeared as other chimpanzee characters in unrelated films, including Ramona the Chimp in &quot;Bela Lugosi Meets a Brooklyn Gorilla&quot; (1952) and Chee-Chee in &quot;Doctor Dolittle&quot; (1967) with Rex Harrison, supposedly his last role before retirement. However, according to Wells, Raffill, and Shawver, as reported by R. D. Rosen, Cheeta never appeared in any movies; Rosen himself confirmed that the animal could not have been the Chee-Chee in the Dolittle film.

===Later life of Cheeta/Jiggs IV as a celebrity===
In the mid-1980s, the myth of Tony Gentry&#x27;s chimp Cheeta/Jiggs IV being the original Cheeta from the movies was unexpectedly perpetuated when a film studio employee, looking for an opportunity to make headlines, stumbled on the (false) story of this supposedly very long-lived chimp and decided to create an extravagant fundraiser, complete with amateur New Wave cover bands and cash bar, to pay for installation of a star on Hollywood&#x27;s Walk of Fame for Cheeta. Unfortunately for the inexperienced organizers of this unofficial &quot;charitable&quot; event, the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce outright denied the application for the star (as well as many previous and subsequent applications), and eventually the funds from the 1985 marathon party were donated to Gentry, who then lived in the Los Angeles suburb of Thousand Oaks, for the care of Cheeta/Jiggs IV. The final result of the probably well-meaning efforts by this &quot;useful idiot&quot; was a party in Hollywood enjoyed by many, a good sum of money raised and donated to Gentry, and perpetuation of the dual myths that Cheeta/Jiggs IV was indeed the former movie star chimp, and was now in his mid-50s.

In 1991, whatever the truth of his origins and prior life, Cheeta/Jiggs IV was given by Gentry to his distant cousin Dan Westfall, who served as the animal&#x27;s caretaker for the remainder of its life. Gentry died two years later. In Westfall&#x27;s care, Cheeta lived at a primate sanctuary called Creative Habitats and Enrichment for Endangered and Threatened Apes (or CHEETA) in Palm Springs, California, where he reportedly watched television, made abstract paintings which were sold to benefit primate-related charities, and often watched &quot;his&quot; old films with his grandson, Jeeter. He also leafed through books and &quot;played&quot; the piano.

His birthdays, calculated from the date of his supposed 1932 arrival in the United States, were regularly celebrated. In 2006, coinciding with his &quot;74th&quot; birthday, Cheeta received an award for his supposed film career from the International Film Festival of Peñíscola Comedy. Later that year, the 4 October 2006, edition of the Palm Springs newspaper, &quot;The Desert Sun&quot;, reported that he had received his first-ever visit from famed primatologist Jane Goodall the previous day. His &quot;75th&quot; birthday was covered by &quot;National Geographic&quot;. His &quot;76th&quot; birthday was celebrated on 9 April 2008, at his &quot;Casa de Cheeta&quot; in Palm Springs at an event hosted by Dan Westfall and Diane Weissmuller, (Johnny Weissmuller, Jr.&#x27;s widow). The press and many Palm Springs celebrities attended.

On the basis of his fictitious history, Cheeta was cited by the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; as the world&#x27;s oldest nonhuman primate. An equally fictitious purported ghost-written &quot;autobiography&quot; of the chimp, &quot;Me Cheeta&quot;, was published in the U.K. in October 2008. The American edition was published on March 3, 2009.

On May 5, 2022, Cheeta/Jiggs IV died at the C.H.E.E.T.A. sanctuary in Palm Springs, California.

==Honors==

In March 1995, the character of Cheeta was honored with a Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs, California, Walk of Stars.

Since 2004, unsuccessful attempts have been made to secure a star for Cheeta on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and as of 2008, filmmaker Matt Devlen was continuing the effort. Attempting for the seventh time to get a sidewalk star, the handlers of Cheeta/Jiggs IV launched an online petition to get supporters to urge the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce to give a star in 2009. The petition was unsuccessful.

== Influences==
The character of Chemistry, from the Doc Savage stories, is said to have been inspired by Cheeta.

<text>Brook Taylor (18 August 1685 – 29 December 1731) was an English mathematician and barrister best known for several results in mathematical analysis. Taylor&#x27;s most famous developments are Taylor&#x27;s theorem and the Taylor series, essential in the infinitesimal approach of functions in specific points. 

== Life and work ==
Brook Taylor was born in Edmonton (former Middlesex). Taylor was the son of John Taylor, MP of Patrixbourne, Kent and Olivia Tempest, the daughter of Sir Nicholas Tempest, Baronet of Durham.

He entered St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, as a fellow-commoner in 1701, and took degrees in LL.B. in 1709 and LL.D. in 1714. Taylor studied mathematics under John Machin and John Keill, leading to Taylor obtaining a solution to the problem of &quot;center of oscillation&quot;. Taylor&#x27;s solution remained unpublished until May 1714, when his claim to priority was disputed by Johann Bernoulli.

Taylor&#x27;s &quot;Methodus Incrementorum Directa et Inversa&quot; (1715) (&quot;Direct and Indirect Methods of Incrementation&quot;) added a new branch to higher mathematics, called &quot;calculus of finite differences&quot;. Taylor used this development to determine the form of movement in vibrating strings. Taylor also wrote the first satisfactory investigation of astronomical refraction. The same work contains the well-known Taylor&#x27;s theorem, the importance of which remained unrecognized until 1772, when Joseph-Louis Lagrange realized its usefulness and termed it &quot;the main foundation of differential calculus&quot;. 

In Taylor&#x27;s 1715 essay &quot;Linear Perspective&quot;, Taylor set forth the principles of perspective in a more understandable form, but the work suffered from brevity and obscurity problems which plagued most of his writings, meaning the essay required further explanation in the treatises of Joshua Kirby (1754) and Daniel Fournier (1761).

Taylor was elected as a fellow in the Royal Society in 1712. In the same year, Taylor sat on the committee for adjudicating the claims of Sir Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz. He acted as secretary to the society from 13 January 1714 to 21 October 1718. 

From 1715 onward, Taylor&#x27;s studies took a philosophical and religious bent. He corresponded with the Comte de Montmort on the subject of Nicolas Malebranche&#x27;s tenets. Unfinished treatises written on his return from Aix-la-Chapelle in 1719, &quot;On the Jewish Sacrifices&quot; and &quot;On the Lawfulness of Eating Blood&quot;, were afterwards found among his papers.

Taylor was one of few English mathematicians, along with Isaac Newton and Roger Cotes, who was capable of holding his own with the Bernoullis, but a lack of clarity affected a great part of his demonstrations and Taylor lost brevity through his failure to express his ideas fully and clearly.

His health began to fail in 1717 after years of intense work.

Taylor married Miss Brydges of Wallington, Surrey in 1721 without his father&#x27;s approval. The marriage led to an estrangement with his father, which improved in 1723 after Taylor&#x27;s wife died in childbirth while giving birth to a son. Taylor&#x27;s son did not survive.

He spent the next two years with his family at Bifrons, and in 1725 he married with his father&#x27;s approval, Sabetta Sawbridge of Olantigh, Kent. She died in childbirth in 1730, though his only daughter, Elizabeth, survived. 

Taylor&#x27;s father died in 1729, leaving Taylor to inherit the Bifrons estate. 

Taylor died at the age of 46, on 29 December 1731, at Somerset House, London.

==Selected writings==

Taylor&#x27;s grandson, Sir William Young, printed a posthumous work entitled &quot;Contemplatio Philosophica&quot; for private circulation in 1793, (2nd Bart., 10 January 1815). The work was prefaced by a biography, and had an appendix containing letters addressed to him by Bolingbroke, Bossuet, and others.

Several short papers by Taylor were published in &quot;Phil. Trans.,&quot; vols. xxvii to xxxii, which including accounts of experiments in magnetism and capillary attraction. In 1719, Brook issued an improved version of his work on perspective, &quot;New Principles of Linear Perspective&quot;, which was revised by John Colson in 1749. A French translation was published in 1757. It was reprinted, with a portrait and short biography, in 1811.

<text>Charing Cross railway station (also known as London Charing Cross) is a central London railway terminus between the Strand and Hungerford Bridge in the City of Westminster. It is the terminus of the Southeastern Main Lines to Dover via Ashford and Hastings via Tunbridge Wells. All trains are operated by Southeastern, which provides the majority of commuter and regional services to south-east London and Kent. It is connected to Charing Cross Underground station and is near to Embankment Underground station and Embankment Pier.

The station was originally opened by the South Eastern Railway in 1864. It takes its name from its proximity to the road junction Charing Cross, the notional &quot;centre of London&quot; from which distances from the city are measured. During the 19th century the station became the main London terminus for continental traffic via boat trains, and served several prestigious international services. It was badly damaged by a roof collapse in 1905 and extensively rebuilt, subsequently becoming an important meeting point for military and government traffic during World War I. By this time, Charing Cross station was seen as out of date by some politicians and proposals were made to replace Hungerford Bridge with a road bridge or road/rail combination, with the station moving to the south bank of the River Thames in the case of a road-only replacement. The station was bombed several times during World War II, and was rebuilt afterwards, re-opening in 1951. In the late 1980s, the station complex was redesigned by Terry Farrell and rebuilt to accommodate a modern office block, now known as Embankment Place.

==Location==
Charing Cross station is located at the western end of the Strand in the City of Westminster, east of Trafalgar Square and northeast of Whitehall. It is close to the Embankment Pier, providing river services along the River Thames. The railway leads directly out onto Hungerford Bridge and across the river towards the London Borough of Lambeth.

The station code is CHX. It is one of twenty stations in Great Britain that are managed by Network Rail and is the 15th busiest station in the country. A number of key bus routes run in the area, and are designated &quot;Trafalgar Square for Charing Cross&quot;.

== History ==

The station was planned as the London terminus of the South Eastern Railway (SER). They had wanted to extend the line from Bricklayers Arms towards Hungerford Bridge, but a bill presented in 1846 was unsuccessful. In 1857, they proposed to Parliament that they would build a railway terminus in the West End, hoping to use Victoria, before reaching an agreement with the London, Brighton &amp; South Coast Railway to build a line west from .

Later in the year, the SER secretary Samuel Smiles looked for potential routes and decided the best location would be on the site of the former Hungerford Market adjacent to The Strand, and that the line should be directly connected to Waterloo, allowing a link with London and South Western Railway services. The Charing Cross Railway Company was formed in 1859 in order to build the extension, and the SER paid £300,000 (now £) in capital to help build this. The line towards Charing Cross was expensive to build as it traversed a heavily built-up area, which was exacerbated in 1862 when the company chose to upgrade the two running lines to three, and doubled the capacity over the bridge to four tracks. The bridge replaced the original suspension bridge designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel which opened in 1845. Work began in June 1860 and took around three years. The old suspension bridge remained open until the new bridge was suitable to carry foot traffic. A trial run over the new line took place on 1 December 1863.
The station was designed by Sir John Hawkshaw, and featured a single span wrought iron roof, long and wide, arching over the six platforms on its relatively cramped site. It was built on a brick arched viaduct, the level of the rails above the ground varying up to . The space underneath the line was used as wine cellars. The roof above the tracks is a single wide great arch, rising to at its highest point. The station was built by Lucas Brothers.

Charing Cross station opened on 11 January 1864. The Charing Cross Railway was absorbed into the SER on 1 September, shortly after the station opened.

The , designed by Edward Middleton Barry, and built by Lucas Brothers, opened on 15 May 1865 and gave the station an ornate frontage in the French Renaissance style. It had 250 bedrooms spread over seven floors and extended along Villiers Street as well as the front of the Strand. The public rooms had balconies overlooking the main station concourse. It quickly became popular and was profitable, leading to a 90-bedroom annexe on the other side of Villiers Street opening in 1878. A bridge over the street connected the two parts of the hotel together.

In 1887, Hungerford Bridge was widened to in order to provide three more tracks into the station. On 1 January 1899, the SER merged with the London, Chatham &amp; Dover Railway to form the South Eastern &amp; Chatham Railway (SECR), which took over operations at Charing Cross.

=== Eleanor Cross ===
Contemporary with the Charing Cross Hotel was a replica of the Eleanor Cross in Red Mansfield stone, also designed by Edward Middleton Barry, that was erected in the station forecourt. It was based on the original Whitehall Cross built in 1291, that had been demolished in 1647 by order of Parliament. Distances in London are officially measured from the original site of the cross, now the statue of Charles I facing Whitehall, and not from this replica.

The cross deteriorated over time until it was in such a vulnerable condition that it was placed on English Heritage&#x27;s &quot;Heritage At Risk Register&quot; in 2008. A ten-month project to repair and restore the cross was completed in August 2010. This work included recreating and attaching almost 100 missing ornamental features including heraldic shields, an angel, pinnacles, crockets and finials; securing weak or fractured masonry with stainless steel pins and rods and re-attaching decorative items which had previously been removed after becoming loose.

=== International services ===
After opening, Charing Cross became the main terminus of all SER services instead of London Bridge, including boat trains to Continental Europe. Along with Victoria, it became the main departure point from London to abroad, and was called &quot;the Gates of the World&quot; by Percy Fitzgerald. Thomas Cook established a travel office on the corner of the station forecourt. The SER route became the shortest from London to Dover after a diversion at Sevenoaks was built in 1868, and by 1913 it was possible to travel from Charing Cross to Paris in six and a half hours.

Owing to its international connections, Charing Cross played an important part in World War I as the main departure point for both the military and government towards the Western Front. All civilian and public boat services were suspended on 3 August 1914. Return journeys from Dover carried the sick and wounded towards Charing Cross and hence to hospitals around the country. Over the course of the war, 283 journeys departed from the station. On 26 December 1918, shortly after the war, the US President Woodrow Wilson met King George V at Charing Cross. Commercial cross-Channel services resumed to Ostend on 18 January 1919, Boulogne on 3 February and Calais on 8 January 1920, but by this time, Victoria had been expanded to accommodate the strict wartime immigration and customs checks, and Charing Cross ceased to be important as an international terminal.

=== 1905 roof collapse ===

A length of the original roof structure, comprising the two end bays at the south of the station, and part of the western wall collapsed at 3:57 p.m. on 5 December 1905. A gang of men were employed at the time in repairing, glazing and painting the section of roof which fell. Shortly after 3:45 p.m, the roof emitted a loud noise, which was when someone noticed that one of the main tie rods had broken and was hanging down. Part of the roof began to sag and the western wall began to crack.

It was another 12 minutes before the collapse occurred, which enabled trains and platforms to be evacuated and incoming trains to be held back. The roof, girders and debris fell across four passenger trains, blocking all tracks. The part of the western wall that fell had crashed through the wall and roof of the neighbouring Royal Avenue Theatre (now the Playhouse Theatre) in Northumberland Avenue, which was being reconstructed at the time. Six people died (two workmen on the roof, a W.H. Smith bookstall vendor and three workmen on the Royal Avenue Theatre site).

At the Board Of Trade Inquiry into the accident, expert witnesses expressed doubts about the design of the roof, even though the cause of the failure was attributed to a faulty weld in a tie rod. Though the SECR believed the roof had a lifespan of at least forty more years, they decided not to repair it but to replace it entirely. A travelling timber gantry had to be constructed to take the remainder of the station roof down safely. The replacement was a utilitarian post and girder structure supporting a ridge and furrow roof. The curve of the original roof design can still be seen on the interior brickwork. The station was partially re-opened on 19 March 1906.

The old booking offices were demolished and the various rooms on the ground floor were rearranged. A new booking hall was constructed, along with a separate ladies&#x27; waiting-room. The additional remedial work was completed in 1913.
=== Proposed closure and relocation ===
By the late-19th century, Charing Cross was seen as being inconveniently placed. In 1889, the newly formed London County Council&#x27;s John Burns proposed that the station and its approach should be demolished, with a road bridge put in place. The idea gained support within the council as it would allow the Strand to be widened and put a road crossing over the Thames that could bypass Whitehall. When the SECR went to Parliament asking for an act to strengthen the bridge in 1916, Burns suggested the station was in the wrong place and should be rebuilt on the south side of the Thames. The following year, an act was passed to reconstruct the bridge, with strict conditions about its appearance and a ban on enlarging the station building itself.

Ownership of Charing Cross passed to the Southern Railway (SR) in 1923 following the Big Four grouping. The line was electrified in 1926 to cater for suburban services. The lighter load of multiple-unit electric trains was found to put far less strain on the bridge, and so traffic was redesigned so that local services ran on the older section, with mainline services using the 1887 extension.

In 1926, the Royal Commission on Cross River Traffic proposed that Hungerford Bridge should be replaced by a double deck road / rail bridge, and a new Charing Cross station built to the east of the old one. The SR approved the idea as it would allow them to expand the station. Two years later, a proposal appeared again to build just a road bridge and relocate the station south of the Thames, as it was significantly cheaper. The Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin urged the SR to accept the proposal, as &quot;a matter of national importance&quot;, but the bill failed in 1930 after the select committee did not accept building a new Charing Cross on the south bank. The proposal was formally rejected in 1936 by the London &amp; Home Counties Traffic Advisory Committee, which revived the double-deck bridge option. The plans were all abandoned following the outbreak of World War II.

=== World War II ===
Charing Cross sustained substantial damage in air-raids during the war. On 8 October 1940, a train was hit during a daylight raid on Whitehall. On the evening of 16/17 April 1941, the hotel was damaged by fire and explosives, four trains caught fire and there were several fires on the bridge. A parachute mine landed next to platform 4. The station was closed to repair the damage and defuse the mine. A further raid took place on the night of 10/11 May, leading to the station&#x27;s closure again. On 18 June 1944, a bomb took out a span of the bridge. Normal operation did not resume until 4 December.

Following the war, the hotel received extensive repairs in 1951. This consisted of a whole new set of top floors, while the mansard roof of the upper floors of the hotel was rebuilt in a plain neo-Georgian white brick.

=== Modernisation ===
The booking hall and ticket offices were modernised in 1974. Electronic ticket printing was first trialled at the station in 1983.

In 1986, redevelopment began over most of the area above the platforms. The new buildings were named Embankment Place, a postmodern office and shopping complex designed by Terry Farrell and Partners. This development led to the replacement of almost the whole of the 1906 roof. The rear two spans of this structure – immediately adjacent to the existing concourse roof – were retained as part of an enlarged waiting area. In addition the original retaining side walls of the station which once supported it remain in near complete condition. The works were completed in November 1990. Most of the Embankment Place complex is office space, with a selection of restaurants on the ground floor.

== Services ==

The station has six platforms. All trains call at Waterloo East and London Bridge.

All services at London Charing Cross are operated by Southeastern using , , , , and EMUs.

The typical off-peak service in trains per hour is:
* 4 tph to via of which 2 continue to 
* 1 tph to Dartford via 
* 4 tph to via 
* 2 tph to via 
* 1 tph to 
* 1 tph to via 
* 2 tph to via (1 semi-fast, 1 stopping)
* 1 tph to via 



== London Underground ==
The station is served by two London Underground stations, both within walking distance of the mainline terminal and sited at each end: Charing Cross (to the north), and Embankment (to the south). Both stations have an Oyster Out of Station Interchange, which allows passengers to change lines while still being charged as a single journey.

Numerous proposals for underground connections for the mainline station were considered in the decades after its opening. Almost as soon as work was complete on the station, the SER wanted to build a connection from Charing Cross to the railway terminals further north. Soon after Charing Cross station opened, the North Western and Charing Cross Railway Act was passed, a joint act between the SER and the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) that proposed a shallow sub-surface line to . The scheme collapsed in 1866 due to a shortage of funding caused by a banking crisis. The scheme was revived with the London Central Railway, that proposed to link Charing Cross to Euston and , but was again abandoned in 1874.

The first underground railway to serve Charing Cross was the District Railway (now the District line), which opened its station at Charing Cross on 30 May 1870.

In 1884, bills were submitted to parliament by the Charing Cross and Euston Railway and the London Central Subway for sub-surface underground lines between Charing Cross and Euston and Charing Cross and King&#x27;s Cross respectively and by the King&#x27;s Cross, Charing Cross and Waterloo Subway for a deep-level railway linking the three terminals in its name. None of the three plans proceeded.

The Baker Street and Waterloo Railway (now the Bakerloo line) constructed a deep-level tube line on the west side of the station in the late 19th century, which opened on 10 March 1906 with a new station in Trafalgar Square and an interchange with the District Railway&#x27;s station. The link between Charing Cross and Euston was finally built by the Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railway (now part of the Northern line) as a deep-level tube line in 1906 which opened its station under the forecourt of the mainline station on 22 June 1907.

Originally, Embankment tube station was called Charing Cross, while the present Charing Cross tube station was the separate Trafalgar Square (Bakerloo line) and Strand (Northern line) stations. The two northern stations were combined under the current name when connected by the development of the Jubilee line. New below ground passageways were constructed linking the platforms so that an interchange could be made. The Northern line&#x27;s Strand station was temporarily closed from 1974 to enable new escalators to be installed and it reopened along with the opening of the Jubilee line on 1 May 1979. The Jubilee line platforms were closed on 20 November 1999, following the extension of the Jubilee line where it was diverted to Westminster and onwards south of the River Thames.

== Accidents and incidents ==
On 25 October 1913, two trains collided in thick fog at Waterloo junction, killing three people. On 31 July 1925, there was a minor side-on collision near platform 2.

In May 1927, a trunk was deposited in Charing Cross station&#x27;s cloakroom that contained the five severed body parts of Minnie Alice Bonati. She was later identified as having been murdered in Rochester Row by John Robinson, who was convicted of the Charing Cross Trunk Murder, for which he was later executed.

On 19 September 1928, a train formed of two 3SUB electric multiple units and a trailer set ran into the buffers. Sixty-eight people were injured, 45 of whom were treated at the Charing Cross Hospital.

== Cultural references ==
The Maggie Hambling statue &quot;A Conversation with Oscar Wilde&quot; is directly opposite the station. It was erected in 1998 and designed for people to sit on the monument and have a virtual conversation with Oscar Wilde.

Charing Cross is referenced in numerous Sherlock Holmes stories. In &quot;The Adventure of the Abbey Grange&quot;, Holmes and Watson catch a train from the station towards the fictional Abbey Grange in Kent, while in &quot;The Adventure of the Golden Pince-Nez&quot;, they travel to from the station.

<text>Waleed Mohammed al-Shehri (; December 20, 1978 – September 11, 2001) was a Saudi terrorist hijacker. He was involved in the September 11 attacks against the United States in 2001. He was one of the five hijackers who took control of American Airlines Flight 11, which was then flown into the North Tower of the World Trade Center.

Born in Saudi Arabia, al-Shehri had been a student until he accompanied his mentally ill brother to Medina. Later, he and his brother Wail went to Chechnya, where they fought in support of a jihadist insurgency against Russia. However, they were soon redirected to Taliban-controlled Afghanistan, where they were recruited to carry out the September 11 attacks. After their selection, the brothers were moved to a safehouse in Pakistan before flying out to the United Arab Emirates and starting the process to enter the United States.

In April 2001, al-Shehri arrived in the United States on a tourist visa. On the day of the attacks, al-Shehri, his brother, and the other hijackers took control of American Airlines Flight 11, following which Mohamed Atta flew the plane into the North Tower in a suicidal attack.

==Early life and education==
Al-Shehri was born in ʿAsir Province, Saudi Arabia, on December 20, 1978. Growing up in a poor region of the country, near the border with Yemen, he studied to become a teacher in the footsteps of Wail al-Shehri, his elder brother. As his family adhered to Wahhabism, a fundamentalist movement within Islam, al-Shehri grew up in a very conservative household; he was forbidden to indulge in music and did not have any contact with non-&quot;mahram&quot; females until he was old enough for an arranged marriage. His family also did not have access to satellite television or the Internet.

Early media accounts state that al-Shehri had earned his pilot&#x27;s certificate in the United States, graduating from Embry–Riddle Aeronautical University in 1997. However, after a short investigation, Embry–Riddle was discovered to have not had any involvement in the flight training of the September 11 hijackers. One of the institution&#x27;s former students shared the same name as one of the hijackers, but has not been found to have any connections to al-Qaeda.

==Career==

===2000===
Waleed al-Shehri left his studies to accompany his brother&#x27;s leave of absence after his brother complained of a mental symptom that had caused him grief, telling their father that he intended to seek aid from a religious healer in Medina.

The brothers arrived at the Al Farouq training camp in Afghanistan, where they met Ahmed al-Nami and Saeed al-Ghamdi. Before arriving at Al-Farouq, the four reportedly pledged themselves to jihad in Spring of 2000, in a ceremony presided over by Wail al-Shehri, who had dubbed himself &quot;Abu Mossaeb al-Janubi&quot; after one of Muhammad&#x27;s companions.

Waleed al-Shehri later served in the security forces at Kandahar International Airport with Saeed al-Ghamdi. After being selected for the operation, he trained with the other hijackers at al-Matar complex under Abu Turab al-Urduni.

Al-Shehri returned to Saudi Arabia with his brother in the fall of 2000 so they could obtain clean passports and U.S. visas, which they did on 3 October and 24 October, respectively.

Locals reported that he and his brother disappeared from Khamis Mushayt in the south of Saudi Arabia in December.

In mid-November, the 9/11 Commission believes that three of the future muscle hijackers, Wail al-Shehri, Waleed ak-Shehri, and Ahmed al-Nami, all of whom had obtained their U.S. visas in late October, traveled in a group from Saudi Arabia to Beirut, Lebanon and then onward to Iran where they could travel through to Afghanistan without getting their passports stamped. This probably followed their return to Saudi Arabia to get &quot;clean&quot; passports. An associate of a senior Hezbollah operative is thought to have been on the same flight, although this may have been a coincidence.

===2001===
After training, he would have moved to a safehouse in Karachi, Pakistan before travelling to the United Arab Emirates (UAE). From the UAE, the muscle hijackers came to the U.S. between April and June 2001. Waleed al-Shehri may have arrived in the U.S. on 23 April. Some sources report that al-Shehri &quot;at times&quot; stayed at lead hijacker Mohamed Atta&#x27;s apartment in Hamburg, Germany at some period between 1998 and 2001. Others place him with Zacarias Moussaoui in London.

Ramzi bin al-Shibh says that Osama bin Laden had given a message to Waleed al-Shehri for conveyance to Mohamed Atta earlier that spring, indicating that bin Laden preferred to attack the White House instead of the Capitol.

On 4 May, he applied for and received a Florida driver&#x27;s license. The next day, he filled out a change-of-address form to receive a duplicate license. Five other suspected hijackers also received duplicate Florida licenses in 2001. Some have speculated that this was to allow multiple persons to use the same identity. On 19 May, al-Shehri and Satam al-Suqami flew from Fort Lauderdale to Freeport, Bahamas, where they had reservations at the Bahamas Princess Resort where al-Shehri and al-Suqami rented two cars, a black Buick Regal and a gray Ford Taurus. The two were turned away by Bahamian officials on arrival, however, because they lacked visas; they returned to Florida that same day. The 9/11 Commission felt that they likely took this trip to renew al-Suqami&#x27;s immigration status, as al-Suqami&#x27;s legal stay in the United States ended on 21 May.

He was one of nine hijackers to open a SunTrust bank account with a cash deposit around June 2001. While living in Boynton, neighbors reported that he seemed to be an enthusiastic fan of the Florida Marlins.

On 16 July, both Wail and Waleed were staying at a hotel in Salou, Spain where they were visited by Mohamed Atta. On 30 July, al-Shehri traveled alone from Fort Lauderdale to Boston. He flew to San Francisco the next day, where he stayed one night before returning via Las Vegas.

According to librarian Kathleen Hensmen, Wail and Waleed al-Shehri used the Internet access at Delray Beach Public Library in August, where they may have been looking at information on crop dusting; they reportedly left the library with a third Middle Eastern man thought to be Marwan al-Shehhi, who Hensmen said asked her for the name of a local restaurant. 

On September 5, Wail and Waleed al‐Shehri traveled together on Delta Air Lines Flight 2462 from Fort Lauderdale to Boston. They checked in together at the Park Inn Hotel in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts, staying in room 432. Abdulaziz al-Omari, may have also spent a night at the Park Inn before leaving with Mohamed Atta for Portland, Maine on September 10. When they checked out, the brothers may have left a discarded sheet of instructions on how to fly a transcontinental jetliner in their hotel room.

===September 11 attacks===
Waleed al-Shehri, his brother Wail, and Satam al-Suqami arrived together at Logan Airport at 06:45 on the morning of September 11, 2001, having left their Ford Focus rental car in the airport parking facility. Upon check-in, Wail al-Shehri was selected by the Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System (CAPPS), as was his brother Waleed, and Flight 11 hijacker Satam al-Suqami. Mohamed Atta, the pilot hijacker on Flight 11 had also been selected in Portland. Being selected by CAPPS meant that their checked baggage were subject to extra screening. As the CAPPS was only for luggage, the three hijackers did not undergo any extra scrutiny at the passenger security checkpoint.

By 7:40 a.m., all five hijackers were aboard the flight, which was scheduled to depart at 7:45 a.m. Wail and Waleed al-Shehri sat together in first class in seats 2A and 2B respectively. The aircraft taxied away from Gate 26 and departed Logan International Airport at 7:59 a.m. from runway 4R after a 14-minute delay. The hijacking of Flight 11 began at approximately 08:14, which is when the pilot stopped responding to air traffic control. It is suspected that the brothers stabbed two flight attendants in the hijacking. At 08:46:40, Mohamed Atta deliberately crashed Flight 11 into the northern facade of the North Tower (Tower 1) of the World Trade Center. The damage caused to the North Tower destroyed any means of escape from above the impact zone, trapping 1,344 people. The North Tower collapsed at 10:28, after burning for 102 minutes.

==Aftermath==

===Reports after 9/11 attacks===
On September 23, 2001, &quot;BBC News&quot; reported that al-Shehri was &quot;alive and well&quot; in Casablanca, Morocco, and was talking to multiple media organizations; however, due to confusion over the man&#x27;s identity and some editorial concerns over conspiracy theories, &quot;BBC News&quot; later modified the 23 September report by inserting &quot;A man called ... &quot; &quot;BBC News&quot; considers the 23 September report superseded by an 5 October 2001 report that lists Waleed as one of the alleged hijackers believed by the FBI to be responsible for the 11 September attacks.

Waleed and Wail were both reported to have been initially found, in error, by a Saudi newspaper editor as the sons of Ahmed Alshehri, a senior Saudi diplomat stationed in Bombay, India. On September 16, 2001, the diplomat Ahmed Alshehri denied that he was the father of the two hijackers. Wail claims he &quot;did&quot; attend Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Daytona Beach, Florida 
— but was the victim of mistaken identity, since he used that training to secure his current position with a Moroccan airline company. Saudi Arabia has confirmed his story, and suggested he was the victim of identity theft.

Muhammad Ali al-Shehri, the Shehri brothers&#x27; true father, was identified prior to September 17, 2001, and told Arab News that he had not heard from his sons in 10 months prior to September 2001. An &quot;ABC News&quot; story in March 2002 repeated this, and during a report entitled &quot;A Saudi Apology&quot; for &quot;Dateline NBC&quot; on August 25, 2002, &quot;NBC&quot; reporter John Hockenberry traveled to &#x27;Asir, where he interviewed the third brother, Salah, who agreed that his two brothers were dead and claimed they had been &quot;brainwashed&quot;.

Furthermore, another article explains that the pilot who lives in Casablanca was named Walid al-Shri (not Waleed M. al-Shehri) and that much of the &quot;BBC&quot; information regarding &quot;alive&quot; hijackers was incorrect according to the same sources used by &quot;BBC&quot;. In September 2007, a video recording of his last testament was released to mark the 6th anniversary of the attacks.

<text>Commercial art is the art of creative services, referring to art created for commercial purposes, primarily advertising. Commercial art uses a variety of platforms (magazines, websites, apps, television, etc.) for viewers with the intent of promoting the sale and interest of products, services, and ideas. It relies on the iconic image (pictorial representations that are recognized easily to members of a culture) to enhance recall and favorable recognition for a product or service. An example of a product could be a magazine ad promoting a new soda through complementary colors, a catchy message, and appealing illustrative features. Another example could be promoting the prevention of global warming by encouraging people to walk or ride a bike instead of driving in an eye catching poster. It communicates something specific to an audience.

People can obtain training, certifications, and degrees that incorporate commercial arts in many exercises, activities, and programs.

== History ==
Commercial art emerged during the Industrial Revolution in the 18th century. Rapid technological improvements brought about a boom in mass production, and design for the purpose of advertising and selling this mass amount of product became a thriving industry. Designers created with the intention of capturing consumers&#x27; attention, and achieved this through large letters and a variety in fonts all printed in highly contrasting colors.

As technologies continued to advance, chromolithography became a useful tool for designers creating commercial art. Advertisements transformed from text-only designs to highly detailed, colorful illustrations. These illustrative advertisements were popular among travelling circuses, carnivals, and theatrical shows. The addition of color also revolutionized branding and labels and attention-grabbing packaging became a large sector of commercial art.

==Skills ==
Commercial artists have the ability to organize information and knowledge of fine arts, visualization and media in a way to reach an audience&#x27;s attention. Some of these skills may include the following:

* Attention to detail
* Ability to communicate effectively
* Experience or skills in the fine arts (drawing, painting, photography, etc.)
* Knowledgeable of certain computer software programs (graphics, editing, etc.) and ability to use them
* Marketing skills
* Advertising skills
* Coordination skills
* Animation skills

==Genres==
Commercial art can include many genres of art and categories of art technique, including:

* Illustration
* Graphic design
* Industrial design
* Motion graphic design
* Photography
* Television commercials
* Music videos
* Animation
* Computer art
* Fashion designer
* Store art
* Decorative 
* Ornamental

== Consumerism within commercial art ==
Commercial art is art that is created for commercial purposes to promote services or products to viewers. In the process of creating commercial art, an audience is taken into consideration when designing and/or forming the goods that are being advertised/promoted. An example of this can be seen in the recognized works of American painter and consumer ad designer, Andy Warhol. Using Campbell&#x27;s soup and Coca-Cola bottles as everyday products of consumers, he recreated a visually stimulating design through pop art that advertises the products through consumption habits of consumers. Consumerism was present when pop art was popular. Pop art could contain mass cultural objects and/or celebrities (popular culture and mass media) to endorse markets and goods.

<doc id="210434" wikidata="Q1356920" url="?curid=210434" title="U-Roy">
<text>Ewart Beckford OD (21 September 1942 – 17 February 2021), known by the stage name U-Roy, was a Jamaican vocalist and pioneer of toasting. U-Roy was known for a melodic style of toasting applied with a highly developed sense of timing.

==Early life==
Ewart Beckford was born in Jones Town, Saint Andrew Parish, Kingston, Jamaica, on 21 September 1942. He was raised within a religious and musical family; his mother was an organist for the choir at a local Seventh-day Adventist church. The sobriquet U-Roy originated from a younger member of his family who found it difficult to pronounce his first name. Beckford attended Denham Town High School in Kingston. As a young man Beckford listened to the music of Louis Prima, James Brown, Ruth Brown, Fats Domino, Rufus Thomas, Smiley Lewis and was especially influenced by the vocal phrasing of Louis Jordan.

==Career==
Inspired by Count Matchuki, U-Roy started his professional career as a deejay in 1961 on Dickie Wong&#x27;s sound system (originally called Doctor Dickies later changed to Dickies Dynamic) moving later to the Sir George the Atomic sound system. He then worked on Sir Coxsone Dodd&#x27;s sound system where he ran the number two set while King Stitt &quot;The Ugly One&quot; ran the main set. This was followed by a period with Sir Percy before he moved to King Tubby&#x27;s Hometown Hi-Fi sound system. His first single &quot;Dynamic Fashion Way&quot; (1969) was a Keith Hudson production. It was followed by the Lee &quot;Scratch&quot; Perry production &quot;Earth&#x27;s Rightful Ruler&quot; with Peter Tosh.

In 1970, Jamaican singer John Holt (lead vocalist of the Paragons) heard U-Roy toasting over a Duke Reid track at a dance. Holt told Reid about the performance and on his recommendation Reid asked him to come and see him and an informal recording deal was arranged. His first two singles on Duke Reid&#x27;s Treasure Isle label in 1970, &quot;Wake the Town&quot; and &quot;Wear You to the Ball&quot;, were Jamaican hits and established his reputation as one of Jamaica&#x27;s most popular toasters. He went on to work with other major producers on the island including Lee &quot;Scratch&quot; Perry, Bunny Lee, Phil Pratt, Sonia Pottinger, Rupie Edwards, Alvin Ranglin and Lloyd Daley. 1971 saw the release of his deejay version of The Paragons&#x27; &quot;The Tide Is High&quot;. He first toured the UK in 1972 with the artists Roy Shirley and Max Romeo. The tour was organized by Rita and Benny King, the owners of R &amp; B Records based in Stamford Hill, London.

U-Roy&#x27;s album &quot;Dread In A Babylon&quot; was released in the US, Europe and Jamaica by Virgin Records in 1975. The album achieved significant sales in the UK, due in part to the ongoing expansion of the Virgin label and stores. The track &quot;Runaway Girl&quot; from the album was released as a single in Europe that same year. The success of &quot;Dread In A Babylon&quot; led to a series of Tony Robinson produced albums: &quot;Natty Rebel&quot; (1976), &quot;Rasta Ambassador&quot; (1977) and &quot;Jah Son Of Africa&quot; (1978). His international popularity led to the album &quot;Natty Rebel&quot; being released in 1976 on Virgin&#x27;s Front Line label in Nigeria as well as in France on Virgin and Polydor.

U-Roy started his own sound system in 1978, which he named Stur Gav after his sons. The sound system would launch the careers of a younger generation of toasters and singers including Ranking Joe, Jah Screw, Charlie Chaplin and Josey Wales. The pop group Blondie had a world-wide hit with a cover of &quot;The Tide Is High&quot; in 1980, prompting Virgin to re-release the original Paragons&#x27; recording from 1967 and the 1971 U-Roy version as a single that same year. His album &quot;Pray Fi Di People&quot; was released in 2012.

U-Roy was featured on the album &quot;True Love&quot; by Toots and the Maytals, which won the Grammy Award in 2004 for Best Reggae Album, and showcased many notable musicians including Willie Nelson, Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, Trey Anastasio, Gwen Stefani / No Doubt, Ben Harper, Bonnie Raitt, Manu Chao, The Roots, Ryan Adams, Keith Richards, Toots Hibbert, Paul Douglas, Jackie Jackson, Ken Boothe, and The Skatalites.

He was awarded the Order of Distinction in 2007 by the Jamaican government for his contribution to music.

His last recording was the song &quot;The Coming of Jah Jah&quot; for the project &quot;The Deejay Battle: Sly &amp; Robbie vs Roots Radics&quot; released in April 2023 produced by the Grammy nominated musician and producer Hernan &quot;Don Camel&quot; Sforzini.

===U-Roy&#x27;s music and Rastafari===
Rastafari has been a feature of U-Roy&#x27;s lyrics from his earliest singles to his latest album &quot;Pray Fi Di People&quot;. Beckford&#x27;s second single &quot;Rightful Ruler&quot; (1969) opens with a profession of Rastafari faith given in the Ethiopian language Amharic:

&lt;poem&gt;
Kibir amlak (Glory to Jah)
Qedamawi ras fetari (First creator)
Qedamawi iyesus kristos (Holy Jesus Christ)
Lebdama mabrak isad
Tenayistilgn (Greetings)
&lt;/poem&gt;

His &quot;Joyful Locks&quot; (1975) is a DJ version of Linval Thompson&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Cut Off Your Dreadlocks&quot;; an encouragement to others to keep their dreadlocks and to &quot;let it grow&quot;. The original song and U-Roy&#x27;s DJ version both allude to the biblical Samson who as a Nazarite was expected to make certain religious vows including the ritual treatment of his hair as described in Chapter Six of the Book of Numbers:

All the days of the vow of his separation there shall no razor come upon his head: until the days be fulfilled, in the which he separateth himself unto the Lord, he shall be holy, and shall let the locks of the hair of his head grow.
==Death==
Beckford&#x27;s death was confirmed on 17 February 2021 when his partner, Marcia Smikle, told the Jamaican newspaper &quot;The Gleaner&quot;. Trojan Records was also informed about his death. While no cause of death was made public at the time, he suffered from diabetes, hypertension, and problems with his kidneys prior to his death, and had been undergoing surgery at the hospital.

==Legacy==
Beckford was preceded by the toasters Count Matchuki, King Stitt and Sir Lord Comic who themselves were influenced by the &quot;jive talk&quot; of the US disc jockeys that they heard on American radio stations whose broadcasts reached the Caribbean. Beckford was the first toaster to popularize the form through a series of successful releases on the Duke Reid label gaining a wider audience for toasting. This approach to production and the remixing of previously recorded tracks with a new vocal influenced the early hip-hop pioneers. Kool Herc states:

&quot;Hip-hop….the whole chemistry of that came from Jamaica…..In Jamaica all you needed was a drum and a bass. So what I did was go right to the ‘yoke’. I cut off all the anticipation and just played the beats. I’d find out where the break in the record was and prolonged it and people would love it. So I was giving them their own taste and beat percussion wise….cause my music is all about heavy bass.&quot;

Many internationally known dancehall deejays have acknowledged U-Roy as an influence on their careers, including Sean Paul and Shabba Ranks.

<doc id="210447" wikidata="Q509731" url="?curid=210447" title="Prionessus">
<text>Prionessus is a genus of extinct mammal from the Paleocene of what is now Central Asia. It was a member of the extinct order Multituberculata within the suborder Cimolodonta and superfamily Taeniolabidoidea. The genus was named by William Diller Matthew and Walter Granger in 1925, and is based on a single species &quot;P.lucifer&quot;.

Kielan-Jarowoska and Hurum believe that members of the Taeniolabidoidea, such as &quot;Prionessus&quot;, are all quite similar. For example, they all share a short wide snout and a blocky head so it is probably instructive to look at a close and more commonly occurring relative, &quot;Lambdopsalis bulla&quot;, a likely burrower. Matthew and Granger noted in their discovery that &quot;P.lucifer&quot; had a robust lower incisor, supportive of this similarity.

Fossil remains have been found in the Late Paleocene Nomogen and Khashat Formations of Gashato, Naran and Nomogen in Bayan Ulan of Mongolia and China.
&quot;Prionessus&quot; fossils range from 59-55 million years ago, through the Thanetian age of the late Paleocene. They were estimated to have had a body mass of about .

<text>The Black Eyed Peas are an American musical group formed in Los Angeles in 1995, composed of rappers will.i.am, apl.de.ap and Taboo. The group&#x27;s lineup during the height of their popularity in the 2000s featured Fergie, who left the group in 2018. They have sold an estimated 80 million records, making them one of the best-selling musical acts of all time, and were ranked 12th on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s 2000s Decade-End Artist of the Decade Chart and 7th on the Hot 100 Artists of the Decade.

Originally forming as an alternative hip hop trio, they signed with Interscope Records to release two albums—&quot;Behind the Front&quot; (1998) and &quot;Bridging the Gap&quot; (2000)—before rebranding to a more marketable pop-rap act; their third album, &quot;Elephunk&quot; (2003), yielded the group&#x27;s mainstream breakthrough. Its lead single, &quot;Where Is the Love?&quot; (featuring Justin Timberlake), peaked atop music charts in 13 countries, including the United Kingdom, where it spent seven weeks at number one and became the country&#x27;s biggest-selling single of that year. Their fourth album, &quot;Monkey Business&quot; (2005), was met with continued commercial success; it received triple platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and peaked at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

The group&#x27;s fifth album, &quot;The E.N.D.&quot; (2009), yielded their furthest commercial success; it peaked atop the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and spawned three &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100-number one singles: &quot;Imma Be&quot;, &quot;Boom Boom Pow&quot; and &quot;I Gotta Feeling&quot;. For one week, the latter two songs made the group one of the 11 musical acts to have simultaneously held the top two spots on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, where they remained for a then-record 26 consecutive weeks. Two other singles from the album, &quot;Rock That Body&quot; and &quot;Meet Me Halfway&quot;, peaked within the top ten of the chart. &quot;I Gotta Feeling&quot; became the first single to sell over than one million downloads in the United Kingdom. At the 52nd Grammy Awards ceremony, the group won three awards from six nominations. The group&#x27;s sixth album, &quot;The Beginning&quot; (2010), released the following year, and spawned the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100-top five singles &quot;The Time (Dirty Bit)&quot; and &quot;Just Can&#x27;t Get Enough&quot;. In February 2011, they performed in the Super Bowl XLV halftime show. 

In 2011, the Black Eyes Peas announced they would be going on indefinite hiatus to pursue other activities, briefly reuniting in 2015. Fergie was announced to have left the group in 2018, and J. Rey Soul joined the group as a touring member that same year. Soul also appeared as a featured artist on select tracks on the group&#x27;s seventh album, &quot;Masters of the Sun Vol. 1&quot; (2018), which failed to chart. They followed this with the albums &quot;Translation&quot; (2020) and &quot;Elevation&quot; (2022), which delved into reggaeton and Latin influences.

==History==
===1988–2001: Formation, &quot;Behind the Front&quot; and &quot;Bridging the Gap&quot;===
In 1988, while attending two different high schools, William James Adams Jr and Allan Pineda Lindo met at the all-ages dance venue Club What? in Los Angeles. They formed a hip-hop dance and music crew named Tribal Nation. Adams took the stage name Will 1X while Pineda Lindo adopted the name apl.de.ap. Their friends joined the group – Dante Santiago and Mooky Mook, followed shortly by DJ Motiv8. Actor David Faustino opened an all-ages club named Balistyx in 1991 inside the old Whisky a Go Go, and Tribal Nation played there. Rapper Eazy-E caught their show and signed the group to Ruthless Records, changing the group name to Atban Klann. Their first album project, &quot;Grass Roots&quot;, was shelved at the end of 1993, never to be released. They released a promo song &quot;Let Me Get Down&quot; in 1994, billed as being produced by the Black Eyed Peas: the production team of DJ Motiv8 and Will 1X. Mooky Mook left the group in 1995, and Eazy-E died of HIV/AIDS. The group&#x27;s contract with Ruthless was stalled, so Santiago also left the group. Will 1X changed his stage name to will.i.am.

In 1995, will.i.am and apl.de.ap formed a new group named Black Eyed Pods with Jaime Gomez (Taboo), and Kim Hill, a singer who featured on a selected number of their tracks. They later changed &quot;Pods&quot; to &quot;Peas&quot;. Unlike the &quot;gangsta rap&quot; sounds of Los Angeles–based hip hop acts at the time, the trio performed with a live band and adopted a conscious musical and appearance style. After being signed to Interscope Records and releasing their debut, &quot;Behind the Front&quot; (1998) the group (and their accompanying live band) earned critical acclaim. One of the singles from the album was &quot;Joints &amp; Jam&quot;, and was featured on the &quot;Bulworth&quot; soundtrack. Singer Sierra Swan appeared as a guest on the 1998 song &quot;Fallin&#x27; Up&quot;. Their second album, &quot;Bridging the Gap&quot; (2000), produced the singles &quot;Weekends&quot; featuring Esthero and &quot;Request + Line&quot; featuring R&amp;B singer Macy Gray. Hill left the band while producing the album, but was still featured on the album tracks for &quot;Hot&quot; and &quot;Tell Your Mama Come&quot; as well as in the video for &quot;Weekends&quot;.

===2002–2008: Addition of Fergie, &quot;Elephunk&quot; and &quot;Monkey Business&quot;===

In 2002, Stacy Ferguson was chosen as the lead singer, after being introduced to the band by Santiago. Their new album, &quot;Elephunk&quot;, indicated a shift to a polished pop sound designed to attract mass audiences. In a positive review of the Black Eyed Peas&#x27; new-found style, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; noted that after the group &quot;hired a blond bombshell named Stacy &#x27;Fergie&#x27; Ferguson and gave up their pursuit of backpack-rapper cred, they have made a kind of spiritual practice of recording futuristic songs – a total aesthetic commitment that extends from their garish wardrobes to their United Colors of Benetton worldview.&quot;

From &quot;Elephunk&quot; came &quot;Where Is the Love?&quot;, which became the Black Eyed Peas&#x27; first major hit, peaking at No. 8 on the U.S. Hot 100. It was more successful abroad, topping the charts in several other countries, including seven weeks at No. 1 in the United Kingdom, where it became the biggest-selling single of 2003. The single had similar results in Australia, staying at No. 1 for six weeks. In an interview with TalkofFame.com, Taboo shared that Justin Timberlake&#x27;s split with Britney Spears impacted the recording of &quot;Where Is the Love?&quot;. The album subsequently spawned &quot;Shut Up&quot;, which peaked at No. 2 in the UK and topped the charts and went gold and platinum in the U.S., UK, Germany, and other European markets. The third single from the album, although significantly restyled from the original &quot;Elephunk&quot; version, &quot;Hey Mama&quot; hit the top 5 in Australia and the top 10 in the UK, Germany and other European countries and reached No. 23 in the U.S. The song received even more exposure in 2003 when it was featured in the first &quot;silhouette&quot; television commercial for the iPod. The fourth single from the album was &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Retarded&quot;. It won a 2005 Grammy for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group and also received two nominations for Record of the Year and Best Rap Song. In 2004, the Black Eyed Peas embarked on their international Elephunk Tour, touring many countries in Europe, Africa, and Asia.
Their fourth album, &quot;Monkey Business&quot;, was recorded through 2004 and was released on May 25, 2005. Much of the pre-production writing was performed on the John Lennon Educational Tour Bus while on the Black Eyed Peas tour of 2004. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Don&#x27;t Phunk with My Heart&quot;, was a hit in the U.S., reaching number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. This &quot;Billboard&quot; status was the highest peak yet of their career in the U.S. (this was later broken when &quot;Boom Boom Pow&quot; peaked at the top spot of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100) and earned them another Grammy for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group. The song reached three in the UK, and five in Canada, and stayed at number one for three weeks in Australia. Some radio stations, concerned about complaints of obscenity, played an alternative version, &quot;Don&#x27;t Mess with My Heart&quot;. &quot;Don&#x27;t Lie&quot;, the second single from the album, saw success on the U.S. Hot 100, reaching No. 14, although becoming somewhat more successful in the UK and Australia, reaching a peak of No. 6 in both countries. &quot;My Humps&quot;, another song from the album, immediately achieved commercial success in the U.S. and also garnered fairly substantial radio play despite the sexually suggestive lyrics. It reached number three on the U.S. Hot 100 and number one in Australia, making it their fourth Australian number one single. However, many mocked the song for its poor lyrical content. For instance, John Bush, writing for AllMusic, described it as &quot;one of the most embarrassing rap performances of the new millennium&quot;. Despite this, the album &quot;Monkey Business&quot; debuted at number two on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 albums chart, selling over 295,000 copies in its first week and was later certified 3× platinum by the RIAA. Their next and final commercially released single from the album was &quot;Pump It&quot;, which borrows much of its sound from &quot;Misirlou&quot;, specifically Dick Dale&#x27;s version. The track peaked at number 8 in Australia and number 18 in the U.S.
In September 2005, the Black Eyed Peas released an &quot;iTunes Originals&quot; playlist of their greatest hits, as well as some that were re-recorded specially available for purchase through iTunes. The playlist includes popular songs such as &quot;Don&#x27;t Lie&quot;, &quot;Shut Up&quot;, and a new version of &quot;Where Is the Love?&quot;. It has small stories containing info and commentary about the songs and how the group first met. In autumn 2005, the Black Eyed Peas set off to tour with Gwen Stefani as supporting act. In December 2005, they embarked on the &quot;European Tour&quot;, which toured multiple countries in Europe. The European leg which opened in Tel Aviv, Israel, continued onto Ireland, the UK, France and Germany.
After heading to Europe and Asia, they toured the U.S. again. The tour concluded in South America. In addition to touring, the Black Eyed Peas also headlined the halftime show at the Grey Cup on November 27, 2005.

The Black Eyed Peas starred in a series of web shorts for Snickers, called &quot;Instant Def&quot;, appearing as a group of hip-hop superheroes. On March 21, 2006, the Black Eyed Peas released a remix album, titled &quot;&quot; to iTunes. It features remixed versions of &quot;Ba Bump&quot;, &quot;My Style&quot;, &quot;Feel It&quot;, &quot;Disco Club&quot;, &quot;They Don&#x27;t Want Music&quot;, &quot;Audio Delite at Low Fidelity&quot; plus the standard version and video of &quot;Like That&quot;. The following week, the iTunes compilation was released on CD (without the music video). Participants on the EP included DJ Premier, Pete Rock, Erick Sermon, DJ Jazzy Jeff, and Large Professor. In March 2006, the Black Eyed Peas hit the road again as the featured headliner for the 6th Annual Honda Civic Tour with supporting bands Flipsyde and the Pussycat Dolls. They again brought the John Lennon Educational Tour Bus on the tour with them to craft new songs for Fergie&#x27;s solo debut album. In 2006, they went on tour with the Pussycat Dolls.

In 2007, the Black Eyed Peas embarked on the Black Blue &amp; You World Tour, visiting more than 20 countries, including: Macau, Sweden, Poland, Romania, Hungary, South Africa, South Korea, Malaysia, India, Indonesia, Israel, Singapore, China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Australia, Nigeria, Mexico, Thailand, Venezuela, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Argentina, the Philippines, El Salvador and Brazil. This tour was presented by Pepsi, in conjunction with the new &quot;Pepsi More&quot; advertising campaign, featuring the Black Eyed Peas. They recorded the song &quot;More&quot; for the new Pepsi spot. On December 31, 2006, the Black Eyed Peas&#x27;s tour concluded at Ipanema Beach in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil for more than 1 million people, being their biggest concert ever. The Black Eyed Peas performed at the UK leg of Live Earth on July 7, 2007, at Wembley Stadium, London. will.i.am performed a new song, &quot;Help Us Out&quot;, at the event, which would appear on his album, &quot;Songs About Girls&quot;, as &quot;S.O.S. (Mother Nature)&quot;. They headlined the main Ocean Stage at the Summer Sonic Festival in Tokyo, Japan on August 11, and in Osaka, Japan on August 12, 2007.

===2009–2011: &quot;The E.N.D&quot;, &quot;The Beginning&quot; and hiatus===

The group&#x27;s fifth studio album, &quot;The E.N.D&quot;, title that stands for &quot;The Energy Never Dies&quot;, was released on June 3, 2009. The overall sound of the album has a more electro hop beat rather than the usual hip pop/R&amp;B feeling of their previous albums. Following its release, will.i.am remarked that the album had been inspired by a trip to Australia, specifically the sound of The Presets&#x27; &quot;My People&quot;. &quot;The energy on the Presets&#x27; small little stage was crazy energy. That song My People – that shit is wild,&quot; will.i.am said, &quot;That&#x27;s the reason why this record sounds the way it does – my three months in Australia.&quot; In its first week, the album sold 304,000 copies and debuted at number 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. In the United States, the album became the ninth album to top the one million mark in sales in 2009. The album spent 38 weeks within the top 10 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. &quot;The E.N.D&quot; was the 7th bestselling album of 2009 in the U.S. It also debuted at number one in Australia, number two in New Zealand and three in the United Kingdom. Three additional singles, &quot;Imma Be&quot;, &quot;Alive&quot;, and &quot;Meet Me Halfway&quot;, were released through the iTunes Store in the three weeks running up to the album&#x27;s release.

The first single &quot;Boom Boom Pow&quot; was released on March 30, 2009, in the U.S. on iTunes. The single sold 465,000 downloads in its first week of digital release, the third-largest number of download sales in a single week overall, and the largest single-week and debut-download totals by a group in the history of digital-download sales, reaching No. 1 on the U.S. The single also reached the top spot in &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and Pop 100. being the group&#x27;s first U.S. No. 1, holding the spot for twelve consecutive weeks. It also reached number 1 in Australia, Canada, and the UK. On May 21, the Black Eyed Peas released &quot;I Gotta Feeling&quot; (produced by David Guetta) as the official second single from the album. The single charted at number three and then went to number one on the UK Singles Chart. It debuted at number 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 behind &quot;Boom Boom Pow&quot; and later surpassed it, taking the number 1 spot.

<text>Williams syndrome (WS), also Williams–Beuren syndrome (WBS), is a genetic disorder that affects many parts of the body. Facial features frequently include a broad forehead, underdeveloped chin, short nose, and full cheeks. Mild to moderate intellectual disability is observed, particularly challenges with visual spatial tasks such as drawing. Verbal skills are relatively unaffected. Many people have an outgoing personality, a happy disposition, an openness to engaging with other people, increased empathy and decreased aggression. Medical issues with teeth, heart problems (especially supravalvular aortic stenosis), and periods of high blood calcium are common.
Williams syndrome is caused by a genetic abnormality, specifically a deletion of about 27 genes from the long arm of one of the two chromosome 7s. Typically, this occurs as a random event during the formation of the egg or sperm from which a person develops. In a small number of cases, it is inherited from an affected parent in an autosomal dominant manner. The different characteristic features have been linked to the loss of specific genes. The diagnosis is typically suspected based on symptoms and confirmed by genetic testing.
Interventions include special education programs and various types of therapy. Surgery may be done to correct heart problems. Dietary changes or medications may be required for high blood calcium. The syndrome was first described in 1961 by New Zealander John C. P. Williams. Williams syndrome affects between one in 20,000 and one in 7,500 people at birth. Life expectancy is less than that of the general population, mostly due to the increased rates of heart disease.

==Signs and symptoms==

The most common symptoms of Williams syndrome are heart defects and unusual facial features. Other symptoms include failure to gain weight appropriately in infancy and low muscle tone. People with WS tend to have widely spaced teeth, a long philtrum, and a flattened nasal bridge. Microcephaly is present in one-third of affected individuals.

Most people with WS are highly verbal relative to their intelligence, and are often very sociable, having what has been described as a &quot;cocktail party&quot;-type personality. People with Williams syndrome hyperfocus on the eyes of others in social engagements.

===Physical===
People with Williams syndrome experience many cardiac problems, commonly heart murmurs and the narrowing of major blood vessels, as well as supravalvular aortic stenosis. Other symptoms may include gastrointestinal problems, such as severe or prolonged colic, abdominal pain and diverticulitis, nocturnal enuresis (bed wetting) and urinary difficulties, dental irregularities and defective tooth enamel, and hormone problems, the most common being hypercalcemia. Hypothyroidism has been reported to occur in children, although no proof has been found of it occurring in adults; adults with WS have a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes, with some cases apparent as young as 21 years old.

People with WS often have hyperacusia and phonophobia, which resembles noise-induced hearing loss; however, this may be due to a malfunctioning auditory nerve. People with WS also tend to demonstrate a love of music, and they appear significantly more likely to possess absolute pitch. Also, higher prevalences of left-handedness and left-eye dominance seem to occur.

Ophthalmologic issues are common among people with WS. Up to 75% of subjects in some studies have strabismus (ocular misalignment), particularly esotropia, due to inherent subnormal binocular visual function
and cognitive deficits in visuospatial construction. People with WS have problems with visual processing, but this is related to difficulty in dealing with complex spatial relationships rather than depth perception&quot; per se&quot;.

===Nervous system===
Because of missing multiple genes, many effects on the brain are seen, including abnormalities in the cerebellum, right parietal lobe, and left frontal cortical regions. This pattern is consistent with the visual-spatial disabilities and problems with behavioral timing often seen in WS.

Frontal-cerebellar pathways, involved in behavioral timing, are often abnormally developed in people with WS, which may be related to their deficits in coordination and execution of fine motor tasks such as drawing and writing. In addition, people with WS often exhibit gross motor difficulties, including trouble walking downstairs, overactive motor reflexes (hyperreflexia), and hyperactive, involuntary movement of the eyes (nystagmus).

Williams syndrome is also noteworthy for exhibiting abnormalities in the parietal-dorsal areas of the neocortex, but not the ventral areas. The parietal-dorsal area handles visual processing that supports visual-spatial analysis of the environment, while the ventral is related to semantic recognition of visual stimuli, and the recognition of faces. Thus, people with WS are often able to visually identify and recognize whole objects, and refer to them by name, but struggle with visuospatial construction (seeing an object as being composed of many smaller parts, and recreating it) and orienting themselves in space.

People with WS are often affable and hyperverbal, demonstrating the decreased inhibition ability that stems from dorsal-frontal deficits. Some studies suggest that the amygdala of a person with Williams syndrome has greater volume than the average person&#x27;s (though it is smaller than average in childhood).
In general, neuroimaging studies demonstrate that people with WS have diminished amygdala reactivity in response to socially frightening stimuli (such as disapproving faces), but demonstrate hyperreactivity in the amygdala when presented with nonsocial fear stimuli (such as frightening animals). This may partially account for the apparent absence of social inhibition observed in people with the syndrome, as well as the prevalence of anxious symptoms (but see fear for details on the relationship between the amygdala and fear response). Also, some evidence indicates that people with WS exhibit amygdalal hyperactivity when viewing happy facial expressions. They are talkative and eager to please.

Increased volume and activation of the left auditory cortex has been observed in people with WS, which has been interpreted as a neural correlation of patients&#x27; rhythm propensity and fondness of music. Similar sizes of the auditory cortex have been previously reported only in professional musicians.

===Development===

The earliest observable symptoms of Williams syndrome include low birth weight, failure to thrive, breastfeeding difficulties, nocturnal irritability, and gastroesophageal reflux. Facial dysmorphies thought to be characteristic of the syndrome are also present early in development, as are heart murmurs. Research on the development of the syndrome suggests that congenital heart disease is typically present at an early age, often at the infant&#x27;s first pediatric appointment. Heart problems in infancy often lead to the initial diagnosis of WS.

Developmental delays are present in most cases of WS, and include delay of language abilities and delayed motor-skill development. People with WS develop language abilities quite late relative to other children, with the child&#x27;s first word often occurring as late as 3 years of age. Language abilities are often observed to be deficient until adolescence, in terms of semantics, morphology, and phonology, though not in vocabulary.

Williams syndrome is also marked by a delay in the development of motor skills. Infants with WS develop the ability to lift their heads and sit without support months later than typically developing children. These delays continue into childhood, where patients with WS are delayed in learning to walk. In young children, the observed motor delay is around 5–6 months, though some research suggests that children with WS have a delay in development that becomes more extreme with age. Children with motor delays as a result of WS are particularly behind in the development of coordination, fine motor skills such as writing and drawing, response time, and strength and dexterity of the arms. Impaired motor ability persists (and possibly worsens) as children with WS reach adolescence.

Adults and adolescents with Williams syndrome typically achieve a below-average height and weight, compared with unaffected populations. As people with WS age, they frequently develop joint limitations and hypertonia, or abnormally increased muscle tone. Hypertension, gastrointestinal problems, and genitourinary symptoms often persist into adulthood, as well as cardiovascular problems. Adults are typically limited in their ability to live independently or work in competitive employment settings, but this developmental impairment is attributed more to psychological symptoms than physiological problems.

===Social and psychological===

People with Williams syndrome report higher anxiety levels as well as phobia development, which may be associated with hyperacusis (high sensitivity to certain frequencies of sound). Compared with other children with delays, those with Williams syndrome display a significantly greater number of fears. 35% of these children met the DSM definition of having a phobia as compared with 1–4.3% for those with other types of developmental delays. Williams syndrome is also strongly associated with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and related psychological symptoms such as poor concentration, hyperactivity, and social disinhibition.

Furthermore, cognitive abilities (IQs) of people with WMS typically range from mild to moderate levels of intellectual disability. One study of 306 children with Williams syndrome found IQ scores ranging from 40 to 112 with a mean of 69.32 (the mean IQ score of the general population is 100). IQ scores above this range have been reported in people with smaller genetic deletions. In particular, people with Williams syndrome experience challenges in visual-motor skills and visuospatial construction. Most affected people are unable to spatially orient themselves and many experience difficulty when given a task that requires even the most basic visual problem-solving. Many adults with Williams syndrome cannot complete a simple six-piece puzzle designed for young children, for example. These visuospatial deficits may be related to damage to the dorsal cortical pathway for visual processing.

Despite their physical and cognitive deficits, people with Williams syndrome exhibit impressive social and verbal abilities. WS patients can be highly verbal relative to their IQ. When children with Williams syndrome are asked to name an array of animals, they may well list a wild assortment of creatures such as a koala, saber-toothed cat, vulture, unicorn, sea lion, yak, ibex and Brontosaurus, a far greater verbal array than would be expected of children with IQs in the 60s. Some other strengths that have been associated with Williams syndrome are auditory short-term memory and facial recognition skills. The language used by people with Williams syndrome differs notably from unaffected populations, including people matched for IQ. People with Williams syndrome tend to use speech that is rich in emotional descriptors, high in prosody (exaggerated rhythm and emotional intensity), and features unusual terms and strange idioms.

Among the hallmark traits of people with Williams syndrome is an apparent lack of social inhibition. Dykens and Rosner (1999) found that 100% of those with Williams syndrome were kind-spirited, 90% sought the company of others, 87% empathize with others&#x27; pain, 84% are caring, 83% are unselfish/forgiving, 75% never go unnoticed in a group, and 75% are happy when others do well. Infants with Williams syndrome make normal and frequent eye contact, and young children with Williams will often approach and hug strangers. People affected by Williams syndrome typically have high empathy, showing relative strength in reading people&#x27;s eyes to gauge intentions, emotions, and mental states. The level of friendliness observed in people with Williams is often inappropriate for the social setting, however, and teens and adults with Williams syndrome often experience social isolation, frustration, and loneliness despite their clear desire to connect to other people.

While these children often come off as happy due to their sociable nature, often there are internal drawbacks to the way they act. 76–86% of these children were reported as believing that they either had few friends or problems with their friends. This is possibly due to the fact that although they are very friendly to strangers and love meeting new people, they may have trouble interacting on a deeper level. 73–93% were reported as unreserved with strangers, 67% highly sensitive to rejection, 65% susceptible to teasing, and the statistic for exploitation and abuse was unavailable. There are external problems as well. 91–96% demonstrate inattention, 75% impulsivity, 59–71% hyperactivity, 46–74% tantrums, 32–60% disobedience, and 25–37% fighting and aggressive behavior.

In one experiment, a group of children with Williams syndrome showed no signs of racial bias, unlike children without the syndrome. They did show gender bias, however, to a similar degree to children without the syndrome.

==Cause==

Williams syndrome is a microdeletion syndrome caused by the spontaneous deletion of genetic material from the chromosomal region 7q11.23. This is a heterozygous deletion, which results in haploinsufficient expression of the 25–27 genes in this region. &quot;CLIP2&quot;, &quot;ELN&quot;, &quot;GTF2I&quot;, &quot;GTF2IRD1&quot;, and &quot;LIMK1&quot; are among the genes typically deleted. Haploinsufficiency for the &quot;ELN&quot; gene, which codes for the extracellular matrix protein elastin, is associated with connective-tissue abnormalities and cardiovascular disease (specifically supravalvular aortic stenosis and supravalvular pulmonary stenosis). Elastin insufficiency may also contribute to distinct facies, harsh or hoarse voice, hernias, and bladder diverticula often found in those with Williams syndrome. Haploinsufficiency in &quot;LIMK1&quot;, &quot;GTF2I&quot;, &quot;GTF2IRD1&quot;, and perhaps other genes may help explain the characteristic difficulties with visual–spatial tasks. Additionally, some evidence shows that haploinsufficiency in several of these genes, including &quot;CLIP2&quot;, may contribute to the unique behavioral characteristics, learning disabilities, and other cognitive difficulties seen in WS.

==Diagnosis==
According to the Williams Syndrome Association, its diagnosis begins with the recognition of physical symptoms and markers, which is followed by a confirmatory genetic test. The physical signs that often indicate a suspected case of WS include puffiness around the eyes, a long philtrum, and a pattern in the iris. Physiological symptoms that often contribute to a WS diagnosis are cardiovascular problems, particularly aortic or pulmonary stenosis, and feeding disturbance in infants. Developmental delays are often taken as an initial sign of the syndrome, as well.

If a physician suspects a case of WS, the diagnosis is confirmed using one of two possible genetic tests: Micro-array analysis or the fluorescent &quot;in situ&quot; hybridization test, which examines chromosome 7 and probes for the existence of two copies of the elastin gene. Since 98-99% of individuals with WS lack half of the 7q11.23 region of chromosome 7, where the elastin gene is located, the presence of only one copy of the gene is a strong sign of WS. This confirmatory genetic test has been validated in epidemiological studies and has been demonstrated to be a more effective method of identifying WS than previous methods, which often relied on the presence of cardiovascular problems and facial features (which, while common, are not always present).

Reliance on facial features to identify WS may cause a misdiagnosis of the condition. Among the more reliable features suggestive of WS are congenital heart disease, periorbital fullness (&quot;puffy&quot; eyes), and the presence of a long, smooth philtrum. Less reliable signs of the syndrome include anteverted nostrils, a wide mouth, and an elongated neck. Even with significant clinical experience, reliably identifying Williams syndrome based on facial features alone is difficult.

This is particularly the case in individuals of non-white backgrounds, where typical WS facial features (such as full lips) are more prevalent. 

==Treatment==
No cure for Williams syndrome has been found. Suggested treatments include avoidance of extra calcium and vitamin D, and treating high levels of blood calcium. Blood-vessel narrowing can be a significant health problem and is treated on an individual basis.
Physical therapy is helpful to patients with joint stiffness and low muscle tone. Developmental and speech therapy can also help children and increase the success of their social interactions. Other treatments are based on a patient&#x27;s particular symptoms.

The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends annual cardiology evaluations for individuals with WS. Other recommended assessments include ophthalmologic evaluations, an examination for inguinal hernia, objective hearing assessment, blood-pressure measurement, developmental and growth evaluation, orthopedic assessments on joints and muscle tone, and ongoing feeding and dietary assessments to manage constipation and urinary problems.

Behavioral treatments have been shown to be effective. In regard to social skills, it may be effective to channel their nature by teaching basic skills. Some of these are the appropriate way to approach someone, how and when to socialize in settings such as school or the workplace, and warning of the signs and dangers of exploitation. For phobias, cognitive-behavioral approaches, such as therapy, are the recommended treatments. One of the things to be careful of with this approach is to make sure that the patients&#x27; &quot;charming&quot; nature does not mask any underlying feelings.

Perhaps the most effective treatment for those with WS is music. Those affected have shown relative strength in regards to music, albeit only in pitch and rhythm tasks. Not only do they show strength in the field, but also a particular fondness for it. Music may help with the internal and external anxiety with which these people are more likely to be afflicted. Notably, the typical person processes music in the superior temporal and temporal gyri. Those with WS have reduced activation in these areas, but an increase in the right amygdala and cerebellum.

People affected by WS are supported by multiple organizations, including the Canadian Association for Williams Syndrome and the Williams Syndrome Registry.

==Epidemiology==
Williams syndrome has historically been estimated to occur in roughly one in every 20,000 live births, but more recent epidemiological studies have placed the occurrence rate at closer to one in every 7,500 live births, a significantly larger prevalence. As increasing evidence suggests WS is more common than originally noted (about 6% of all genetic cases of developmental disability), researchers have begun to hypothesize a previous underdiagnosis of the syndrome. One suggested factor in the increase in epidemiological prevalence estimates is that a substantial minority of individuals with the genetic markers of WS lack the characteristic facial features or the diminished intelligence considered to be diagnostic of the syndrome, and often are not immediately recognized as having the syndrome.

==History==
Williams syndrome was first described by J. C. P. Williams and his colleagues, who wrote in 1961 of four patients with supravalvular aortic stenosis, mental disability, and facial features including a broad forehead, large chin, low-set, &quot;drooping&quot; cheeks, widely spaced eyes, and wide-set mouth. A year after this report, German physician A. J. Beuren described three new patients with the same presentation. This led to the syndrome&#x27;s full original name, Williams-Beuren syndrome, which is still used in some medical publications. From 1964 to 1975, small research reports broadened medical knowledge of this syndrome&#x27;s cardiovascular problems. Then in 1975, K. Jones and D. Smith produced a large-scale report on numerous patients with WS, ranging in age from infancy to adulthood, and described the behavioral and observable physical symptoms in greater detail than previously recorded.

==Society and culture==
The adjective &quot;elfin&quot; may have originated to describe the facial features of people with WS; before its scientific cause was understood, people believed that individuals with the syndrome, who have exceptionally charming and kind personalities, had extraordinary, even magical, powers. This has been proposed to be the origin of the folklore of elves, fairies, and other forms of the &#x27;good people&#x27; or &#x27;wee folk&#x27; present in English folklore.

In a review of the symptoms and features of the syndrome, Laskari, Smith, and Graham emphasized that many family members of individuals with WS reject use of terminology such as &quot;elfin&quot;, as well as descriptions of social symptoms as &quot;cocktail party syndrome&quot;. Physicians, family members of individuals with WS syndrome, and WS associations alike have called for the curtailment of such terms.

One notable person with the syndrome is Gabrielle Marion-Rivard, a Canadian actress and singer who won the Canadian Screen Award for Best Actress in 2014 for her performance in the film &quot;Gabrielle&quot;. Another is Jeremy Vest, member of the &quot;How&#x27;s Your News?&quot; team, featured in the US TV series and film of the same name.

<text>The Velveteen Rabbit (or How Toys Become Real) is a British children&#x27;s book written by Margery Williams (also known as Margery Williams Bianco) and illustrated by William Nicholson. It chronicles the story of a stuffed rabbit&#x27;s desire to become real through the love of his owner. The story was first published in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot; in 1921 featuring illustrations from Williams&#x27; daughter Pamela Bianco. It was published as a book in 1922 and has been republished many times since.

&quot;The Velveteen Rabbit&quot; was Williams&#x27; first children&#x27;s book. It has been awarded the IRA/CBC Children&#x27;s Choice award. Based on a 2007 online poll, the National Education Association voted the book #28 on the &quot;Teachers&#x27; Top 100 Books for Children&quot;.

== Plot summary ==
A stuffed rabbit sewn from velveteen is given as a Christmas present to a small boy. The boy plays with his other new presents and forgets the velveteen rabbit for a time. These presents are modern and mechanical; they snub the old-fashioned, velveteen rabbit. The wisest and oldest toy in the nursery is the Skin Horse, which was owned by the boy&#x27;s uncle, and who tells the rabbit (whom he feels sorry for) about toys being made Real by the love of children: &quot;Real isn&#x27;t how you are made... It&#x27;s a thing that happens to you. When a child loves you for a long, long time - not just to play with, but REALLY loves you - then you become Real&quot;. The rabbit is awed by this idea, but his chances of achieving this wish are slight.

One night, the boy&#x27;s nanny gives the rabbit to the boy to sleep with; in place of a lost toy. The rabbit becomes the boy&#x27;s favorite toy; enjoying picnics with him in the spring, and the boy regards the rabbit as Real. Time passes and the rabbit becomes older and shabbier, but remains happy. He meets some real rabbits in the summer, and they learn that the velveteen rabbit cannot hop as they do, and they say that he is not a real rabbit.

One day, the boy comes down with scarlet fever, and the rabbit sits with him as he recovers. The doctor orders that the boy should be taken to the seaside and that his room should be disinfected — all his books and toys burnt; including the velveteen rabbit. The rabbit is bundled into a sack and left out in the garden overnight, where he reflects sadly on his life with his boy. The toy rabbit cries, a real tear drops onto the ground, and a marvelous flower appears. A fairy steps out of the flower and comforts the velveteen rabbit, introducing herself as the Nursery Magic Fairy. She says that because he has become Real to the boy who truly loves him, she will take him away with her and &quot;turn [him] into Real&quot; to everyone.

The fairy takes the rabbit to the forest, where she meets the other rabbits and she kisses the velveteen rabbit. The velveteen rabbit changes into a real rabbit and joins the other rabbits in the forest. The next spring the rabbit returns to look at the boy, and the boy sees a resemblance to his old velveteen rabbit and enjoys seeing the rabbit out in the wild.

<doc id="210456" wikidata="Q764917" url="?curid=210456" title="Sphenopsalis">
<text>Sphenopsalis is a genus of extinct mammal from the Paleocene of what is now Central Asia. It was a member of the extinct order Multituberculata, and lies within the suborder Cimolodonta and the superfamily Taeniolabidoidea. The genus was named by William Diller Matthew, W. Granger and George Gaylord Simpson in 1928.

Many workers believe that members of the Taeniolabidoidea, such as &quot;Sphenopsalis&quot;, are all quite similar. For example, they all share a short wide snout and a blocky head so it is probably instructive to look at a close and more commonly occurring relative, &quot;Lambdopsalis bulla&quot;, a likely burrower.

This organism is found in the fossil record from 59-55 million years ago, during the Thanetian age. One distinguishing feature of this genus is a single rooted 4th premolar (P4). Based on the structure of their teeth, &quot;Sphenopsalis&quot; appears to have been a leaf eater (foliovore). They and/or their close relatives may have been partially adapted to a digging (fossorial) lifestyle.

The one known species, &quot;Sphenopsalis nobilis&quot;, was also named by Matthew, Granger and Simpson in 1928. It has been found in the Late Paleocene Nomogen and Khashat Formation of Mongolia and China. For many years, this species was only known from a handful of fragmentary teeth and bones, but Mao et al discovered additional specimens in 2016 that allowed for more detailed analysis. The American Museum of Natural History in New York City has several fragmentary specimens in its collection.

<doc id="210458" wikidata="Q375" url="?curid=210458" title="Waffle">
<text>A waffle is a dish made from leavened batter or dough that is cooked between two plates that are patterned to give a characteristic size, shape, and surface impression. There are many variations based on the type of waffle iron and recipe used. Waffles are eaten throughout the world, particularly in Belgium, which has over a dozen regional varieties. Waffles may be made fresh or simply heated after having been commercially cooked and frozen.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;waffle&quot; first appears in the English language in 1725: &quot;Waffles. Take flower, cream...&quot; It is directly derived from the Dutch , which itself derives from the Middle Dutch .

While the Middle Dutch is first attested to at the end of the 13th century, it is preceded by the French in 1185. Both are from the Frankish word (&quot;honeycomb&quot; or &quot;cake&quot;).

Other spellings throughout modern and medieval Europe include waffe, wafre, wafer, wâfel, waufre, iauffe, gaufre, goffre, gauffre, wafe, waffel, wåfe, wāfel, wafe, vaffel, and våffla.

==History==
===Medieval origins===
In ancient times, the Greeks cooked flat cakes, called , between hot metal plates. As they spread throughout medieval Europe, the cakes—made from a mixture of flour, water or milk, and often eggs—became known as wafers and were also cooked over an open fire between iron plates with long handles.

Waffles are preceded, in the early Middle Ages, around the period of the 9th–10th centuries, with the simultaneous emergence of / (communion wafer irons) and (wafer irons). While the communion wafer irons typically depicted imagery of Jesus and his crucifixion, the featured more trivial Biblical scenes or simple, emblematic designs. The format of the iron itself was almost always round and considerably larger than those used for communion.

The oublie was, in its basic form, composed only of grain flour and water—just as the communion wafer was. It took until the 11th century, when the Crusades brought new culinary ingredients to Western Europe, for flavorings such as orange blossom water to be added to oublies; however, locally sourced honey and other flavorings may have already been in use before that time.

Oublies (which formally received this name ) spread throughout northwestern continental Europe. Their spread eventually led to the formation of the guild in 1270. Oublieurs/obloyers were responsible for producing not only oublies but also a number of other contemporaneous and subsequent (light pastries), including the waffles that were soon to arise.

===14th–16th centuries===
In the late 14th century, the first known waffle recipe was penned in an anonymous manuscript, , written by a husband as a set of instructions to his young wife. While it technically contains four recipes, all are a variation of the first: &quot;Beat some eggs in a bowl, season with salt and add wine. Toss in some flour, and mix. Then fill, little by little, two irons at a time with as much of the paste as a slice of cheese is large. Then close the iron and cook both sides. If the dough does not detach easily from the iron, coat it first with a piece of cloth that has been soaked in oil or grease&quot;. The other three variations explain how cheese is to be placed between two layers of batter, grated and mixed into the batter, or left out, along with the eggs. However, this was a waffle / in name only, as the recipe contained no leavening.
Though some have speculated that waffle irons first appeared in the 13th–14th centuries, it was not until the 15th century that a true physical distinction between the oublie and the waffle began to evolve. Notably, while a recipe like the fourth in was only flour, salt, and wine—indistinguishable from common oublie recipes of the time—what emerged was a new shape to many of the irons being produced. Not only were the newly fashioned ones rectangular, taking the form of the , but some circular oublie irons were cut down to create rectangles. It was also in this period that the waffle&#x27;s classic grid motif appeared clearly in a French and a Belgian —albeit in a more shallowly engraved fashion—setting the stage for the more deeply gridded irons that were about to become commonplace throughout Belgium.
By the 16th century, paintings by and clearly depict the modern waffle form. Bruegel&#x27;s work, in particular, not only shows waffles being cooked, but fine detail of individual waffles. In those instances, the waffle pattern can be counted as a large 12x7 grid, with cleanly squared sides, suggesting the use of a fairly thin batter, akin to contemporary Brussels waffles ().

The earliest of the 16th century waffle recipes, —from the Dutch &quot;KANTL 15&quot; manuscript ()—is only the second-known waffle recipe after the four variants described in . For the first time, partial measurements were given, sugar was used, and spices were added directly to the batter: &quot;Take grated white bread. Take with that the yolk of an egg and a spoonful of pot sugar or powdered sugar. Take with that half water and half wine, and ginger and cinnamon.&quot;

Alternately attributed to the 16th and 17th centuries, from the Belgian was published as the first recipe to use leavening (beer yeast): &quot;Take white flour, warm cream, fresh melted butter, yeast, and mix together until the flour is no longer visible. Then add ten or twelve egg yolks. Those who do not want them to be too expensive may also add the egg white and just milk. Put the resulting dough at the fireplace for four hours to let it rise better before baking it.&quot; Until this time, no recipes contained leavening, and dough could therefore be easily cooked in the thin . , in its use of leavening, was the genesis of contemporary waffles and validates the use of deeper irons () depicted in the and paintings of the time.
By the mid-16th century, there were signs of waffles&#x27; mounting French popularity. I, king from 1494 to 1547, who, it was said, (loved them a lot), had a set of waffle irons cast in pure silver. His successor, enacted the first waffle legislation in 1560 in response to a series of quarrels and fights that had been breaking out between oublieurs. As a result of the legislation, oublieurs were required &quot;&quot; (to be no less than four yards from one to the other).

===17th–18th centuries===
By the 17th century, unsweetened or honey-sweetened waffles and oublies—often made of non-wheat grains—were the type generally accessible to the average citizen. The wheat-based and particularly the sugar-sweetened varieties, while present throughout Europe, were prohibitively expensive for all but the monarchy and bourgeoisie. Even for the Dutch, who controlled much of the mid-century sugar trade, a kilogram of sugar was worth half an ounce of silver (the equivalent of ~$7 for a 5 lb. bag, 01/2016 spot silver prices), while, elsewhere in Europe, it fetched twice the price of opium. Wealthier families&#x27; waffles, often known as , were &quot;&quot;smaller, thinner and above all more delicate, being composed of egg yolks, sugar, and the finest of the finest flour, mixed in white wine&quot; and were served &quot;like dessert pastry.&quot;&quot;

By the dawn of the 18th century, expansion of Caribbean plantations had cut sugar prices in half. Waffle recipes abounded and became decadent in their use of sugar and other rare ingredients. For instance, Menon&#x27;s from included a livre of sugar for a demi-livre of flour.

Germany became a leader in the development and publication of waffle recipes during the 18th century, introducing coffee waffles, the specific use of beer yeast, cardamom, nutmeg, and a number of (sugar waffles). At the same time, the French introduced whipped egg whites to waffles, along with lemon zests, Spanish wine, and cloves. Joseph Gillier even published the first chocolate waffle recipe, featuring three ounces of chocolate grated and mixed into the batter, before cooking.

A number of 18th century waffle recipes took on names to designate their country or region/city of origin—, and, most famous of all the 18th century varieties, , which were first recorded in 1740. These (Flemish waffles / ) were the first French recipe to use beer yeast, but unlike the Dutch and German yeasted recipes that preceded them, use only egg whites and over a pound of butter in each batch. They are also the oldest named recipe that survives in popular use to the present day, produced regionally and commercially by Meert.

The 18th century is also when the word &quot;waffle&quot; first appeared in the English language, in a 1725 printing of &quot;Court Cookery&quot; by Robert Smith. Recipes had begun to spread throughout England and America, though essentially all were patterned after established Dutch, Belgian, German, and French versions. Waffle parties, known as &quot;wafel frolics&quot;, were documented as early as 1744 in New Jersey, and the Dutch had earlier established waffles in New Amsterdam (New York City).
 waffles, the most popular contemporary Belgian waffle variety, are rumored to have been invented during the 18th century, as well, by the chef to the prince-bishop of . However, there are no German, French, Dutch, or Belgian cookbooks that contain references to them in this period – by any name – nor are there any waffle recipes that mention the waffle&#x27;s distinctive ingredients, brioche-based dough and pearl sugar. It is not until 1814 that publishes a recipe in where brioche dough is introduced as the base of the waffle and (crushed block sugar) is used as a garnish for the waffles, though not worked into the dough. , the famous Parisian pastry chef, is the first to incorporate into several waffle variations named in his 1822 work, . Then, in 1834, Leblanc publishes a complete recipe for (hail waffles), where is mixed in. A full recipe does not appear until 1921.

===19th–21st centuries===

Waffles remained widely popular in Europe for the first half of the 19th century, despite the 1806 British Atlantic naval blockade that greatly inflated the price of sugar. This coincided with the commercial production of beet sugar in continental Europe, which, in a matter of decades, had brought the price down to historical lows. Within the transitional period from cane to beet sugar, Florian Dacher formalized a recipe for the Brussels Waffle, the predecessor to American &quot;Belgian&quot; waffles, recording the recipe in 1842/43. (Dutch syrup wafels), too, rose to prominence in the Netherlands by the middle of the century. However, by the second half of the 1800s, inexpensive beet sugar became widely available, and a wide range of pastries, candies and chocolates were now accessible to the middle class, as never before; waffles&#x27; popularity declined rapidly.

By the early 20th century, waffle recipes became rare in recipe books, and only 29 professional waffle craftsmen, the oublieurs, remained in Paris. Waffles were shifting from a predominantly street-vendor-based product to an increasingly homemade product, aided by the 1918 introduction of GE&#x27;s first electric commercial waffle maker. By the mid-1930s, dry pancake/waffle mix had been marketed by a number of companies, including Aunt Jemima, Bisquick, and a team of three brothers from San Jose, Calif. – the Dorsas. It is the Dorsas who would go on to innovate commercial production of frozen waffles, which they began selling under the name &quot;Eggo&quot; in 1953. Manufacturers are now testing the production of waffles with potato starch, which increase the stability of the waffle and protect them from sticking to the iron.

Belgian-style waffles were showcased at Expo 58 in Brussels. Another Belgian introduced Belgian-style waffles to the United States at the 1962 Seattle World&#x27;s Fair, but only really took hold at the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair, when another Belgian entrepreneur introduced his &quot;Bel-Gem&quot; waffles. In practice, contemporary American &quot;Belgian waffles&quot; are actually a hybrid of pre-existing American waffle types and ingredients and some attributes of the Belgian model.

Even as most of the original recipes have faded from use, a number of the 18th and 19th century varieties can still be easily found throughout Northern Europe, where they were first developed.

==Varieties==
===Brussels===
Brussels waffles are prepared with an egg-white-leavened or yeast-leavened batter, traditionally an ale yeast; occasionally both types of leavening are used together. They are lighter, crisper and have larger pockets compared to other European waffle varieties, and are easy to differentiate from Liège Waffles by their rectangular sides. In Belgium, most waffles are served warm by street vendors and dusted with confectioner&#x27;s sugar, though in tourist areas they might be topped with whipped cream, soft fruit or chocolate spread. 

Variants of the Brussels waffles – with whipped and folded egg whites cooked in large rectangular forms – date from the 18th century. However, the oldest recognized reference to &quot;Gaufres de Bruxelles&quot; (Brussels Waffles) by name is attributed from 1842/43 to Florian Dacher, a Swiss baker in Ghent, Belgium, who had previously worked under pastry chefs in central Brussels. Philippe Cauderlier would later publish Dacher&#x27;s recipe in the 1874 edition of his recipe book &quot;La Pâtisserie et la Confiture&quot;. Maximilien Consael, another Ghent chef, had claimed to have invented the waffles in 1839, though there&#x27;s no written record of him either naming or selling the waffles until his participation in the 1856 Brussels Fair. Neither man created the recipe; they simply popularized and formalized an existing recipe as the Brussels waffle.

===Liège===

The Liège waffle is a richer, denser, sweeter, and chewier waffle. Native to the greater Wallonia region of Eastern Belgium – and alternately known as &quot;gaufres de chasse&quot; (hunting waffles) – they are an adaptation of brioche bread dough, featuring chunks of pearl sugar which caramelize on the outside of the waffle when baked. It is the most common type of waffle available in Belgium and prepared in plain, vanilla and cinnamon varieties by street vendors across the nation. In the United States, they are best known for being sold at ski resorts, mostly in the Northeast, under the Waffle Cabin brand.

===Flemish===
Flemish waffles, or Gaufres à la Flamande, are a specialty of northern France and portions of western Belgium. The original recipe, published in 1740 by Louis-Auguste de Bourbon in &quot;Le Cuisinier Gascon&quot;, is as follows: Take &quot;deux litrons&quot; (1.7 liters or 7 cups) of flour and mix it in a bowl with salt and one ounce of brewer&#x27;s yeast barm. Moisten it completely with warm milk. Then whisk fifteen egg whites and add that to the mixture, stirring continuously. Incorporate &quot;un livre&quot; (490 grams or 1.1 pounds) of fresh butter, and let the batter rise. Once the batter has risen, take your heated iron, made expressly for these waffles, and wrap some butter in a cloth and rub both sides of the iron with it. When the iron is completely heated, make your waffles, but do so gently for fear of burning them. Cooked, take them out, put them on a platter, and serve them with both sugar and orange blossom water on top.

===American===
American waffles vary significantly. Generally denser and thinner than the Belgian waffle, they are often made from a batter leavened with baking powder, which is sometimes mixed with pecans, chocolate drops or berries and may be round, square, or rectangular in shape. Like American pancakes they are usually served as a sweet breakfast food, topped with butter and maple syrup, bacon, and other fruit syrups, honey, or powdered sugar. They are also found in many different savory dishes, such as fried chicken and waffles or topped with kidney stew. They may also be served as desserts, topped with ice cream and various other toppings. A large chain (over 1,900 locations) of waffle specialty diners, Waffle House, is ubiquitous in the southern United States.

===Belgian===
Belgian waffles are based on a simplified version of the Brussels waffle. Recipes are typically baking soda leavened, though some are yeast-raised. They are distinguished from standard American waffles by their use of 1 ½&quot; depth irons. Belgian waffles take their name from the &quot;Bel-Gem brand&quot;, which was promoted by waffle vendor Maurice Vermersch, who came from Brussels, Belgium. The thicker style was also popularized at the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair.

===Bergische===
Bergische waffles, or Waffles from Berg county, are a specialty of the German region of Bergisches Land. The waffles are crisp and less dense than Belgian waffles, always heart shaped, and served with cherries, cream and optionally rice pudding as part of the traditional afternoon feast on Sundays in the region.

===Hong Kong===
Hong Kong style waffle, in Hong Kong called a &quot;grid cake&quot; or &quot;grid biscuits&quot; (格仔餅), is a waffle usually made and sold by street hawkers and eaten warm on the street. It is similar to a traditional waffle but larger, round in shape and divided into four quarters. It is usually served as a snack. Butter, peanut butter and sugar are spread on one side of the cooked waffle, and then it is folded into a semicircle to eat. Eggs, sugar and evaporated milk are used in the waffle recipes, giving them a sweet flavor. They are generally soft and not dense. Traditional Hong Kong style waffles are full of the flavor of yolk. Sometimes different flavors, such as chocolate and honey melon, are used in the recipe and create various colors. Another style of Hong Kong waffle is the eggette or gai daan jai (鷄蛋仔), which have a ball-shaped pattern.

===Pandan===
Pandan waffles originate from Vietnam and are characterized by the use of pandan flavoring and coconut milk in the batter. The pandan flavoring results in the batter&#x27;s distinctive spring green color. When cooked, the waffle browns and crisps on the outside and stays green and chewy on the inside. Unlike most waffles, pandan waffles are typically eaten plain. In Vietnam they are relatively cheap and so are popular among children. They are a popular street food made in either cast iron molds heated with charcoal or in electric waffle irons.

===Croffle===
Croffle (a compound word of croissant and waffle) bakes croissant dough in a waffle pan and eaten with ice cream or maple syrup. It is a popular dessert in Korea. On the Internet, jokes about &quot;the greatest invention of the Covid-19 Age&quot; spread. There are various types of croffles that utilize various toppings such as basil, corn, cheese and so on. It is also popular with people because it is easy to make and eat at home. The beginning of Croffle is the cafe &quot;Le Petit Parisian&quot; in Dublin, Ireland. According to the Irish newspaper Dublin Gadget (reported on July 20, 2017), Louise Lenox, a baker at the café in Camden Street, Dublin, first created a menu item called Croffle.


===Kue gapit===
Kue gapit is an Indonesian &quot;kue kering&quot; (dry snack) which originates from West Java. Generally made from tapioca flour, its name comes from the cooking process, in which it is grilled between iron molds like a waffle. The snack comes in a variety of shapes and flavors.

===Scandinavian===
Scandinavian style waffles, common throughout the Nordic countries, are thin and made in a round waffle iron. The batter is similar to other varieties, but does not contain sugar. The most common style are heart-shaped slices with a sweet topping such as cream or jam.

* In Norway, &quot;brunost&quot; and gomme are also popular toppings. As with crèpes, there are those who prefer a salted style with various mixes, such as blue cheese.
* In Finland, savory toppings are uncommon; instead jam, sugar, whipped cream or vanilla ice cream are usually used.
* In Iceland, the traditional topping is either rhubarb or blueberry jam with whipped cream on top. Syrup and chocolate spread are also popular substitutes for the jam.
* The Swedish tradition dates at least to the 15th century, and there is even a particular day for the purpose, Våffeldagen (waffle day), which sounds like &quot;Vårfrudagen&quot; (&quot;Our Lady&#x27;s Day&quot;), and is therefore used for the purpose. This is March 25 (nine months before Christmas), the Christian holiday of Annunciation. They are usually topped with strawberry jam, bilberry jam, cloudberry jam, raspberry jam, bilberry and raspberry jam, sugar and butter, vanilla ice cream and whipped cream. Other, savory, toppings include salmon roe, cold-smoked salmon and cream fraiche.

=== Gofri===
Gofri (singular gofre) are waffles in Italy and can be found in the Piedmontese cuisine: they are light and crispy in texture, contain no egg or milk (according to the most ancient recipe) and come both in sweet and savory versions. Central Italian cuisine also features waffle-like cookies, which are locally known as pizzelle, &quot;ferratelle&quot; (in Abruzzo) or &quot;cancelle&quot; (in Molise).
===Stroopwafel===
Stroopwafels are thin waffles with a syrup filling, which originated from the Dutch city of Gouda. The stiff batter for the waffles is made from flour, butter, brown sugar, yeast, milk, and eggs. Medium-sized balls of batter are put on the waffle iron. When the waffle is baked and while it is still warm, it is cut into two halves. The warm filling made from syrup is spread in between the waffle halves, which glues them together. They are popular in the Netherlands and Belgium and sold in pre-prepared packages in shops and markets.

===Galettes===
Galettes campinoises/Kempense galetten are a type of waffle popular in Belgium. They are rigid and crunchy, but are buttery, crumbly and soft in the mouth.

===Hotdog===
Hotdog waffles (or waffle dogs) are cylindrical waffles with a hot dog cooked inside them, similar to a corn dog. It is made with specialized waffle irons with cylindrical hotdog-bun shaped molds.

They originate from Hawaii where it was first served at the KC Drive Inn in 1934, owned by the Japanese American Jiro Asato (who later legally changed his name to KC Jiro Asato). The original version has a distinctive shape, with an oblong middle section (containing the hotdog) surrounded by flattened square edges. It is served plain or with a combination of ketchup, mustard, and pickle relish. Its popularity spread to the continental United States, the Philippines (then an American colony), and throughout the rest of the Pacific Islands. Waffle dogs remain an iconic part of Hawaiian culture, though it has waned in popularity in the rest of the US. 

It has also remained popular as a street food item in the Philippines, where variants can use other savory fillings like ham, bacon, &quot;longganisa&quot;, tuna, or cheese; as well as sweet fillings like ube, chocolate, or yema custard. The Filipino versions are also more uniformly cylindrical, with a grid pattern, and are usually served on bamboo skewers. The Filipino fast food chain Waffle Time, founded in 1998, specializes in hotdog waffles as well as other savory and sweet fillings.

In modern times, it has also gained popularity in Thailand and the rest of Southeast Asia, where it is served with ketchup, mayonnaise, or both.

<doc id="210463" wikidata="Q2346186" url="?curid=210463" title="Sylvia Robinson">
<text>Sylvia Robinson (née Vanterpool; May 29, 1935 – September 29, 2011), known mononymously as Sylvia, was an American singer and record producer. Robinson achieved success as a performer on two R&amp;B chart toppers: as half of Mickey &amp; Sylvia with the 1957 single &quot;Love Is Strange&quot;, and her solo record &quot;Pillow Talk&quot; in 1973. She later became known for her work as founder and CEO of the pioneering hip hop label Sugar Hill Records.

Robinson is credited as the driving force behind two landmark singles in the hip hop genre: &quot;Rapper&#x27;s Delight&quot; (1979) by the Sugarhill Gang, and &quot;The Message&quot; (1982) by Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five, both of which she produced. At the 11th Annual Rhythm and Blues Awards Gala in 2000, she received a Pioneer Award for her career in singing and for founding Sugarhill Records. Several publications have dubbed her the &quot;Mother of Hip Hop&quot;. In 2022, she was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in the Ahmet Ertegun Award category for being a major influence on the creative development of hip-hop&#x27;s early successes, and she is the first woman to receive the award unaccompanied by another person.

== Life and career ==

=== Early life ===

Robinson was born as Sylvia Vanterpool on May 29, 1935, in Harlem, New York, United States, to Herbert, who worked for General Motors, and Ida Vanterpool. Robinson attended Washington Irving High School until dropping out at the age of 14, and began recording music in 1950 for Columbia Records under the stage name &quot;Little Sylvia&quot;.

=== Early career ===

In 1954, she began teaming up with Kentucky guitarist Mickey Baker, who taught her how to play guitar. In 1956, the duo now known as Mickey &amp; Sylvia recorded the Bo Diddley and Jody Williams-penned rock single, &quot;Love Is Strange&quot;, which topped the R&amp;B chart and reached number eleven on the &quot;Billboard&quot; pop chart in early 1957. After several more releases including the modestly successful &quot;There Oughta Be a Law&quot;, Mickey &amp; Sylvia split up in 1958 and she later married Joseph Robinson. Sylvia restarted her solo career shortly after her initial split from Baker, first under the name Sylvia Robbins. In 1960, Robinson produced the record &quot;You Talk Too Much&quot; by Joe Jones, but she did not receive credit.

In 1961, Mickey &amp; Sylvia recorded more songs together for various labels including their own. Their label was called Willow Records and was distributed by King Records of Cincinnati. That year, Baker provided vocals and Robinson played guitar on Ike &amp; Tina Turner&#x27;s hit single &quot;It&#x27;s Gonna Work Out Fine&quot; which earned Ike &amp; Tina their first Grammy nomination. &quot;I paid for the session, taught Tina the song; that&#x27;s me playing guitar,&quot; Robinson said in a 1981 interview with &quot;Black Radio Exclusive&quot;.

In 1964, frustrated with the music business, Baker moved to Paris.

In 1966, the Robinsons moved to New Jersey where they formed a soul music label, All Platinum Records, the following year, with artist Lezli Valentine, formerly of the Jaynetts, bringing the label its first hit with &quot;I Won&#x27;t Do Anything&quot;. In 1968, the duo signed a Washington, D.C. act named The Moments, who immediately found success with &quot;Not on the Outside&quot;. Within a couple of years and with a new lineup, the group scored their biggest hit with &quot;Love on a Two-Way Street&quot; (1970), which Sylvia co-wrote and produced with Bert Keyes and (uncredited) lyrics by Lezli Valentine. Other hits on the label and its subsidiaries, including Stang and Vibration, included Shirley &amp; Company&#x27;s &quot;Shame, Shame, Shame&quot; (1975), The Moments&#x27; &quot;Sexy Mama&quot; and &quot;Look at Me (I&#x27;m in Love)&quot;, Retta Young&#x27;s &quot;(Sending Out An) S.O.S.&quot; (1975), and the Whatnauts/Moments collaboration, &quot;Girls&quot;. Robinson co-wrote and produced many of the tracks, although later she was supported by two members of The Moments, Al Goodman and Harry Ray, as well as locally based producers, George Kerr and Nate Edmonds.

=== Solo career ===

In 1972, Robinson sent a demo of a song she had written called &quot;Pillow Talk&quot; to Al Green. When Green passed on it due to his religious beliefs, Robinson decided to record it herself, returning to her own musical career. Billed simply as Sylvia, the record became a major hit, reaching number-one on the R&amp;B chart and crossing over to reach the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 (#3), while also reaching #14 on the UK Singles Chart in the summer of 1973. She was awarded a gold disc by the R.I.A.A. in May 1973, and earned a nomination for the Grammy Award for Best Female R&amp;B Vocal Performance at the 1974 Grammy Awards. &quot;Pillow Talk&quot;&#x27;s subtly orgasmic gasps and moans predated those of the 1975 Donna Summer song &quot;Love to Love You Baby&quot;. (Both were preceded by Serge Gainsbourg&#x27;s 1967 &quot;Je t&#x27;aime... moi non plus,&quot; first recorded with Brigitte Bardot, then the following year with Jane Birkin.) Reviewing Robinson&#x27;s 1973 debut LP (also titled &quot;Pillow Talk&quot;), Robert Christgau wrote in &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981) that it is &quot;&quot;Let&#x27;s Get It On&quot; without production values. Call it underdeveloped if you want; I&#x27;ll mention that it&#x27;s unaffected. Including the best peace lyric heard lately, entitled &#x27;Had Any Lately?&#x27;&quot;

Robinson recorded four solo albums on the Vibration subsidiary and had other R&amp;B hits including &quot;Sweet Stuff&quot; and &quot;Pussy Cat&quot;. &quot;Pillow Talk&quot; was a soulful medium dance number.

=== Sugar Hill Records ===

In the 1970s, the Robinsons founded Sugar Hill Records. The company was named after the culturally rich Sugar Hill area of Harlem, an affluent African-American neighborhood in Manhattan, New York City, known as a hub for artists and performers in the early and mid-1900s. The song &quot;Rapper&#x27;s Delight&quot; (1979), performed by The Sugar Hill Gang, brought rap into the public music arena by attaining one of the first commercially successful hip hop songs and revolutionized the music industry by introducing rap, scratch, and breakdance. Later acts signed to Sugar Hill Records included all-female rap/funk group The Sequence, featuring a teenage Angie Stone (recording as &quot;Angie B&quot;), who had a million-selling hit in early 1980 with &quot;Funk U Up&quot;.

In 1982 Sylvia Robinson with Grandmaster Melle Mel produced the record &quot;The Message&quot;, which was performed by Grandmaster Flash and The Furious Five. The record discussed life in the ghetto and became one of the most influential tracks of the hip-hop genre. On December 5, 2012, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; selected &quot;The Message&quot; as one of the &quot;50 Greatest Hip-Hop Songs of All Time&quot;. In order for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; to compose this list, the publication asked 33 different artists and experts from every genre of music including Busta Rhymes, Boots Riley, from the Coup, Mike Diamond, from the Beastie Boys and Talib Kweli. Once the votes were in, &quot;The Message&quot; was placed in the number 1 spot on the list. Grandmaster Flash stated, &quot;And when that project was on the slate to be done--The Message, I&#x27;m talking about--she would ask us for a period of time about doing a record having to do with the real life things that happen in the &#x27;hood. And we kind of ducked it for a minute.&quot; Without Sylvia Robinson&#x27;s insistence and pressure there would be no &quot;The Message&quot;. This was the first record of its kind, where the DJ who was the cornerstone of hip hop at the time (1980s) was not involved in creating a track that they performed.

Sugar Hill Records folded in 1985 due to changes in the music industry, the competition of other hip-hop labels such as Profile and Def Jam and also financial pressures. Robinson, who had by now divorced Joe Robinson, continued her efforts as a music executive, forming Bon Ami Records in 1987. The label was noted for signing the act The New Style, who later left and found success as Naughty by Nature.

== Personal life ==

Robinson was married to businessman Joseph Robinson Sr. from May 1959 until their amicable divorce in the late 1980s. Together they had three children, sons Joseph &quot;Joey&quot; Robinson Jr. (1962–2015), Leland Robinson (b. 1965 or 1966) and Rhondo &quot;Scutchie&quot; Robinson (1970–2014). Robinson owned a bar in Harlem, New York named &quot;Joey&#x27;s Place&quot; after her husband in the 1960s. Robinson also owned another New York bar and nightclub named the Blue Morocco during the mid-1960s.

== Death ==

Robinson died on the morning of September 29, 2011, at the age of 76, at Meadowlands Hospital in Secaucus, New Jersey due to congestive heart failure.

== In popular culture ==

* In 2003 American electronic musician Moby sampled her song &quot;Sunday&quot; for his song &quot;Sunday (The Day Before My Birthday)&quot;.
* In the &quot;Drunk History&quot; episode &quot;American Music&quot; (2014), Sylvia Robinson was portrayed by Retta.
* Sylvia Robinson is one of the inspirations for the character Cookie Lyon (portrayed by Taraji P. Henson) on the popular Fox television show &quot;Empire&quot;.
* Robinson is featured on the documentary series &quot;Profiles of African-American Success&quot;.
* In a March 2015 piece in &quot;The New York Times&quot; debating U.S. copyright laws, writer M. K, Asante cited the need for artists to return to Robinson&#x27;s mantra of &quot;Don&#x27;t copy things that are out there... come up with something new, something different.&quot;

=== Biopic ===

In 2014, producer Paula Wagner acquired the film rights to Robinson&#x27;s life story from her son, Joey Robinson, an executive at Sugar Hill Records. Joey (who died in July 2015) was scheduled to executive produce and serve as a consultant on the project, along with rapper Grandmaster Melle Mel, while music executive Robert Kraft was to co-produce the film along with Stephanie Allain. In October 2015, Warner Bros. announced that it would be the studio producing the film, and that Malcolm Spellman and Carlito Rodriguez, two of the writers on &quot;Empire&quot;, were writing the script. In October 2018, it was announced that Wagner and Warner Bros. were still moving forward with the film, Spellman and Rodriguez had been joined by Tracy Oliver in completing the script, Justin Simien had been attached as the director, and that Oliver would join Robinson&#x27;s son Leland as executive producers.

<text>Lonnie Rashid Lynn (born March 13, 1972), known professionally as Common (formerly known as Common Sense), is an American rapper and actor. The recipient of three Grammy Awards, an Academy Award, a Primetime Emmy Award, and a Golden Globe Award, he signed with the independent label Relativity Records at the age of 20 to release his debut studio album &quot;Can I Borrow a Dollar?&quot; (1992) along with its follow-ups, &quot;Resurrection&quot; (1994) and &quot;One Day It&#x27;ll All Make Sense&quot; (1997). He maintained an underground following into the late 1990s, and achieved mainstream success through his work with the Black music collective, Soulquarians.

After attaining a major label record deal, he released his fourth and fifth albums, &quot;Like Water for Chocolate&quot; (2000) and &quot;Electric Circus&quot; (2002), to continued acclaim and modest commercial response. His guest performance on fellow Soulquarian, Erykah Badu&#x27;s 2003 single, &quot;Love of My Life (An Ode to Hip-Hop)&quot;, won Best R&amp;B Song at the 45th Annual Grammy Awards. He signed with fellow Chicago rapper Kanye West&#x27;s record label GOOD Music, in a joint venture with Geffen Records to release his sixth album &quot;Be&quot; (2005), which was met with both critical and commercial success and yielded a Grammy nomination for Best Rap Album. His seventh album, &quot;Finding Forever&quot; (2007), became his first to debut atop the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, while a song from the album, &quot;Southside&quot; (featuring Kanye West) won Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group at the 50th Annual Grammy Awards. His eighth album, &quot;Universal Mind Control&quot; (2008), was met with mixed critical reception and served as his final release with GOOD. Common&#x27;s own label imprint, Think Common Entertainment, was founded in 2011 and entered a joint venture with Warner Bros. Records to release his ninth album, &quot;The Dreamer/The Believer&quot; (2011), and later No I.D.&#x27;s ARTium Recordings, an imprint of Def Jam Recordings to release his tenth album, &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Smiling&quot; (2014). Both received critical praise and further discussed social issues in Black America; his eleventh album, &quot;Black America Again&quot; (2016) saw widespread critical acclaim and served as his final release on a major label.

Lynn won the Academy Award for Best Original Song for his song &quot;Glory&quot; (with John Legend), which he released for the film &quot;Selma&quot; (2014), wherein he co-starred as civil rights leader James Bevel. His other film roles include &quot;Smokin&#x27; Aces&quot; (2006), &quot;Street Kings&quot; (2008), &quot;American Gangster&quot; (2007), &quot;Wanted&quot; (2008), &quot;Date Night&quot; (2010), &quot;Just Wright&quot; (2010), &quot;Happy Feet Two&quot; (2011), &quot;Run All Night&quot; (2015), &quot;John Wick: Chapter 2&quot; (2017), and &quot;Smallfoot&quot; (2018). In television, he starred as Elam Ferguson in AMC western series &quot;Hell on Wheels&quot; from 2011 to 2014, and has played a supporting role in the Apple TV+ science fiction series &quot;Silo&quot; since 2023. His song &quot;Letter to the Free&quot; was released for the Ava DuVernay-directed Netflix documentary &quot;13th&quot; (2017), for which he won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Original Music and Lyrics. He made his Broadway acting debut on the play &quot;Between Riverside and Crazy&quot; (2023), which won a Pulitzer Prize for Drama.

== Early life ==
Common was born on March 13, 1972, at the Chicago Osteopathic Hospital in Chicago&#x27;s Hyde Park neighborhood. He is the son of educator and former principal of John Hope College Preparatory High School, Mahalia Ann Hines, and former ABA basketball player turned youth counselor Lonnie Lynn. Lynn shares the same first name as his father, grandfather, great-grandfather and great-great-grandfather. He is known by his middle name, Rashid, to his family and friends. Lynn&#x27;s godfather is basketball player Spencer Haywood who was a teammate of his father on the Denver Rockets.

Lynn was raised in the Calumet Heights neighborhood. His father left the family because of his drug and alcohol addictions while Lynn was young. When he was aged two, Lynn&#x27;s father attempted to take him and his mother to Seattle where he had arranged a tryout with the Seattle SuperSonics. His father was arrested when the family stopped at a motel in Wisconsin and charged with false imprisonment.

Lynn&#x27;s parents divorced when he was six years old, resulting in his father moving to Denver, Colorado. This left Lynn to be raised by his mother; however, his father remained active in his life, and was able to get him a job with the Chicago Bulls as a teenager. Lynn attended Florida A&amp;M University for two years under a scholarship and majored in business administration.

== Music career ==

=== 1987–1996: Career beginnings ===
Lynn began rapping in the late 1980s, while a student at Luther High School South in Chicago, when he, along with two of his friends, formed C.D.R., a rap trio that opened for acts such as N.W.A and Big Daddy Kane. When C.D.R dissolved by 1991, Lynn began a solo career under the stage name of Common Sense. After being featured in the Unsigned Hype column of &quot;The Source&quot; magazine, he debuted as a solo artist in 1992 with the single &quot;Take It EZ&quot;, followed by the album &quot;Can I Borrow a Dollar?&quot;.

With the 1994 release of &quot;Resurrection&quot;, Common Sense achieved a much larger degree of critical acclaim which extended beyond the Chicago music scene. The album sold relatively well and received a strong positive reaction among alternative and underground hip hop fans at the time. &quot;Resurrection&quot; was Common Sense&#x27;s last album produced almost entirely by his long-time production partner, No I.D., who would later become a mentor to a young Kanye West.

In 1996, Common Sense appeared on the Red Hot Organization&#x27;s compilation CD, America Is Dying Slowly (A.I.D.S.), alongside Biz Markie, Wu-Tang Clan, and Fat Joe, among many other prominent hip hop artists. The CD, meant to raise awareness of the AIDS epidemic among African American men, was heralded as &quot;a masterpiece&quot; by The Source magazine. He would later also contribute to the Red Hot Organization&#x27;s Fela Kuti tribute album, Red Hot and Riot in 2002. He collaborated with Djelimady Tounkara on a remake of Kuti&#x27;s track, &quot;Years of Tears and Sorrow&quot;.

The song &quot;I Used to Love H.E.R.&quot; from &quot;Resurrection&quot; ignited a feud with West Coast rap group Westside Connection. The lyrics of the song criticized the path hip hop music was taking, utilizing a metaphor of a woman to convey hip hop and were interpreted by some as directing blame towards the popularity of West Coast gangsta rap. Westside Connection first responded with the 1995 song &quot;Westside Slaughterhouse,&quot; with the lyrics &quot;Used to love H.E.R., mad cause I f*cked her&quot;. &quot;Westside Slaughterhouse&quot; also mentioned Common Sense by name, prompting the rapper to respond with the scathing Pete Rock-produced attack song &quot;The Bitch in Yoo&quot;. Common Sense and Westside Connection continued to insult each other back and forth before finally meeting with Louis Farrakhan and setting aside their dispute. Following the popularity of &quot;Resurrection&quot;, Common Sense was sued by an Orange County-based reggae band with the same name, and was forced to shorten his moniker to simply Common.

=== 1996–1999: &quot;One Day It&#x27;ll All Make Sense &quot; ===
Initially scheduled for an October 1996 release, Common released his third album, &quot;One Day It&#x27;ll All Make Sense&quot;, in September 1997. The album took a total of two years to complete and included collaborations with artists such as Lauryn Hill, De La Soul, Q-Tip, Canibus, Black Thought, Chantay Savage, and Questlove – a future fellow member of the Soulquarians outfit. The album, which made a point of eschewing any gangsterism (in response to questions about his musical integrity), was critically acclaimed and led to a major label contract with MCA Records. In addition to releasing &quot;One Day&quot;, Common&#x27;s first child, daughter Omoye Assata Lynn, was born shortly after the release of the album.

As documented by hip-hop journalist Raquel Cepeda, in the liner notes for the album, this event had a profound spiritual and mental effect on Common and enabled him to grow musically while becoming more responsible as an artist. She writes:

:Rashid found out that he was going to become a daddy in about 8 months. Stunned and confused, Rashid had life-altering decisions to make with his girlfriend, Kim Jones. The situation led to the composition of his favorite cut on &quot;One Day...&quot; that offers a male slant on abortion. &quot;Retrospect for Life&quot;, produced by James Poyser and No I.D. featuring Lauryn Hill (who was due on the same day as Rashid&#x27;s girlfriend), is the song that is the driving force behind the project. Rashid listens to &quot;Retrospect for Life&quot; today at the mastering session geeked as if it were for the first time. He tells me as we listen to L-Boogie wail the chorus, &quot;when I listen to the song now, I think about how precious her (Omoye&#x27;s) life is&quot;.

Common addresses family ethics several times on &quot;One Day...&quot;, and the album sleeve is decorated with old family photos, illustrating the rapper&#x27;s childhood, as well a quote from 1 Corinthians 13:11, which summarizes the path to manhood:

=== 1999–2003: Soulquarians era ===

Following &quot;One Day...&quot;, Common signed a major label record deal with MCA Records and relocated from Chicago to New York City in 1999. He began recording almost exclusively with a loose collective of musicians and artists (dubbed the &quot;Soulquarians&quot; by central figure Questlove) throughout 1999, and made a few sporadic guest appearances on The Roots&#x27; &quot;Things Fall Apart&quot;, and the Rawkus Records compilation, &quot;Soundbombing 2&quot;.

In 2000, his fourth album, &quot;Like Water for Chocolate&quot;, was released to mass critical acclaim. Executive produced by Questlove and featuring significant contributions by J Dilla, (who helmed every track except – &quot;Cold Blooded&quot;, &quot;Geto Heaven Part II&quot;, &quot;A Song For Assata&quot;, &quot;Pop&#x27;s Rap Part 3...All My Children&quot; &amp; the DJ Premier-produced track &quot;The 6th Sense&quot;), &quot;Like Water for Chocolate&quot; transpired to be a considerable commercial breakthrough for Common, earning the rapper his first gold record, and greatly expanding his fanbase among critics and listeners alike.

With both artists hailing from the Great Lakes region of the United States (Chicago and Detroit, respectively), Common and J Dilla established their chemistry early on. Both became members of the Soulquarians collective, and collaborated on numerous projects together, even placing one song, &quot;Thelonius&quot;, on both the Slum Village album &quot;Fantastic, Vol. 2&quot;, and Common&#x27;s &quot;Like Water for Chocolate&quot;. As Dilla&#x27;s health began to decline from the effects of Lupus Nephritis, he relocated to Los Angeles, and asked Common to make the move with him as a roommate (Dilla would later lose his battle with the rare disease).

This album saw Common exploring themes (musically and lyrically), which were uncommon for a hip-hop record, as he does on the song &quot;Time Travelin&#x27; (A Tribute To Fela)&quot;; a homage to Nigerian music legend, and political activist Fela Kuti. The most popular single from the album &quot;The Light&quot; was nominated for a Grammy Award.

In 2002, Common released his fifth album, &quot;Electric Circus&quot;. The album was highly anticipated and praised by many critics for its ambitious vision. However, it was not as commercially successful as his previous album, &quot;Like Water for Chocolate&quot;, selling under 300,000 copies. An eclectic album, &quot;Electric Circus&quot; featured fusions of several genres such as hip hop, pop, rock, electronic, and neo-soul. The album&#x27;s style tended to divide critics; some praised its ambitious vision while others criticized it for the same reason. Most of the criticism tended to revolve around the album&#x27;s experimental nature; some felt Common had strayed too far from his previous sound. This was Common&#x27;s second and last album for MCA, and the label&#x27;s final release prior to its absorption into Geffen Records.

Around this time, Common appeared as a guest performer on singer and fellow Soulquarian Bilal&#x27;s &quot;Love for Sale&quot; album, recording a remake of the 1977 Fela Kuti song &quot;Sorrow, Tears &amp; Blood&quot;. Bilal also featured on &quot;Electric Circus&quot;, the first of many future collaborations with Common.

=== 2004–2011: GOOD Music era ===
In early 2004, Common made an appearance on fellow Chicagoan Kanye West&#x27;s multi-platinum debut album, &quot;The College Dropout&quot; (on the song &quot;Get Em High&quot;), and announced his signing to West&#x27;s then-newfound label GOOD Music. West had been a longtime fan of Common and the two even participated in a friendly on-air MC battle, where West took jabs at his lyrical idol for &quot;going soft&quot; and wearing crochet pants (as he does for his appearance in the video for the Mary J. Blige song &quot;Dance for Me&quot;). The pair worked together on Common&#x27;s next album, &quot;Be&quot;, almost entirely produced by Kanye West, with some help from Common&#x27;s longtime collaborator James Yancey (J Dilla) – also a favorite of West. The album was released in May 2005, and performed very well, boosted by Kanye&#x27;s involvement and the singles &quot;The Corner&quot;, and &quot;Go&quot;. &quot;Be&quot; earned Common the second gold record of his career, with sales topping out at around 800,000 copies. &quot;The Source&quot; magazine gave it a near-perfect 4.5 mic rating, &quot;XXL&quot; magazine gave it their highest rating of &quot;XXL&quot;, and AllHipHop gave the album 4 stars. The album was also nominated for four Grammy Awards in 2006.

Following the release of &quot;Be&quot; in 2005, several mixed-race artists from the UK hip-hop scene took exception to Common&#x27;s comments about interracial relationships on the song &quot;Real People.&quot; Yungun, Doc Brown and Rising Son recorded a track over an instrumental version of &quot;The Corner&quot; named &quot;Dear Common (The Corner Dub).&quot; Common states that he has heard of the track but never actually taken the time to listen to it, and has not retaliated in song.

Common&#x27;s seventh LP titled &quot;Finding Forever&quot; was released on July 31, 2007. For this album, he continued his work with Kanye West, as well as other producers such as Will.i.am, Devo Springsteen, Derrick Hodge, and Karriem Riggins, as well as the only J Dilla-produced track, &quot;So Far To Go&quot;. The album features guest spots from artists such as Dwele, Bilal, D&#x27;Angelo, and UK pop starlet Lily Allen. The first single from the album was &quot;The People&quot; b/w &quot;The Game&quot;. West predicted that &quot;Finding Forever&quot; would win the 2008 Grammy Award for Best Rap Album. The album was nominated for Best Rap Album, but did not win, losing to West&#x27;s &quot;Graduation&quot;; however, Common did win his second Grammy for &quot;Southside,&quot; which won the 2008 Grammy for Best Rap Performance by Duo or Group.
On July 31, 2007, Common performed a free concert in Santa Monica, California, on the 3rd Street Promenade to promote the release of &quot;Finding Forever&quot;. Common explained to the audience that the title &quot;Finding Forever&quot; represented his quest to find an eternal place in hip-hop and also his wishes to be an artist for the rest of his life. The album debuted at #1 on the national &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 charts.

In an August 2007 interview with &quot;XXL&quot;, rapper Q-Tip of the group A Tribe Called Quest stated that he and Common were forming a group called &#x27;The Standard&#x27;, and were planning to record an album to be produced by Q-Tip; however, this never came to fruition.

Common was instrumental in bridging the trans-Atlantic gap by signing UK&#x27;s Mr. Wong and J2K to Kanye West&#x27;s Getting Out Our Dreams recording outfit. Common met the pair during his tour in the UK earlier on in the year. It is speculated that the deal is not only to bring the UK and US hip hop genres together but that to rival Syco Music&#x27;s cross-Atlantic success with Leona Lewis. He also has a deal with Zune mp3 players. In 2008 Common made an estimated 12 million dollars, making him equal in earnings to Eminem and Akon, tied for the 13th highest grossing Hip-Hop artist.

The eighth album from Chicago hip-hop artist Common was originally scheduled to be released on June 24, 2008, under the name &quot;Invincible Summer&quot;, but he announced at a Temple University concert that he would change it to &quot;Universal Mind Control&quot;. The release date was pushed back to September 30, 2008, due to Common filming &quot;Wanted&quot;. The release date was set for November 11, 2008, however, it was once again pushed back to December 9, 2008.

The album&#x27;s eponymous lead single &quot;Universal Mind Control&quot;, was officially released on July 1, 2008, via the US iTunes Store as part of &quot;The Announcement EP&quot; (sold as &quot;Universal Mind Control EP&quot; in the UK). The song features Pharrell, who also produced the track. &quot;The Announcement EP&quot; included an additional track titled &quot;Announcement&quot;, also featuring Pharrell. The video for the lead single was filmed in September by director Hype Williams. In 2009, Common was prominently featured throughout his GOOD Music label-mate Kid Cudi&#x27;s debut album &quot;Man on the Moon: The End of Day&quot;, as a narrator and featured artist. In late 2009, it was revealed Common was nominated for two Grammys at the 52nd Annual Grammy Awards, including Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group for &quot;Make Her Say&quot;, alongside Kid Cudi and Kanye West, as well as Best Rap Album for &quot;Universal Mind Control&quot;.

=== 2011–present: Think Common Ent. ===

==== &quot;The Dreamer/The Believer&quot; and feud with Drake ====
American producer No I.D., stated that he and Kanye West would be producing Common&#x27;s album &quot;The Dreamer/The Believer&quot;. In July 2011, it was announced that No I.D. would be the album&#x27;s sole producer. Common made an appearance on The Jonas Brothers&#x27; most recent album, &quot;Lines, Vines and Trying Times&quot; as a guest rapper for the group&#x27;s 2009 song, &quot;Don&#x27;t Charge Me for the Crime.&quot;

On July 6, 2011, Common released his first single, titled &quot;Ghetto Dreams&quot;, from his next album. A second single, &quot;Blue Sky&quot;, was released on October 4, 2011. On December 20, 2011, Common released his ninth solo album, titled &quot;The Dreamer, The Believer&quot;. Although he left GOOD Music in 2011, Common was featured on the label&#x27;s first compilation album, 2012&#x27;s &quot;Cruel Summer&quot;. Common released a song entitled &quot;Sweet&quot;, from &quot;The Dreamer/The Believer&quot;, which included lyrics critical of rappers who sing, although this criticism was not aimed specifically at Canadian recording artist Drake. Drake took offense and responded by releasing &quot;Stay Schemin&#x27;&quot;, a song with Rick Ross and French Montana. Common fans only had to wait two-and-a-half days for him to respond to Drake&#x27;s diss track. On February 13, 2012, Common commented on the feud by saying &quot;It&#x27;s over. But it was all in the art of hip hop. He said some things to me so I had to say some things back...I wouldn&#x27;t say [he started it] but I know I heard something that I felt was directed to me so I addressed it. That&#x27;s all. But you know, thank God we were able to move forward from it and all is good.&quot;

==== Artium Recordings and further albums ====
After a quiet 2012, Common announced he would release an extended play (EP) in January 2013, and his first mixtape in April. In February 2013, Common announced his tenth solo studio album would be released in September 2013 and will feature Kanye West and production from Kanye West and No I.D. Later on September 8, 2013, he gave an update to his projects saying the previously announced EP would be released soon, and would feature a song with new Def Jam signee Vince Staples. He also told HipHopDX, his tenth solo studio album would be released in early 2014.

On January 6, 2014, Common announced his tenth studio album to be titled &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Smiling&quot; and would be produced entirely by longtime collaborator &#x27;No I.D.&#x27;. The album, which Common revealed was originally going to be an EP, is set to feature Vince Staples, James Fauntleroy and &quot;some new artists from Chicago.&quot; The concept of the album was inspired by his troubled hometown of Chicago: &quot;We came up with this concept &#x27;nobody&#x27;s smiling.&#x27; It was really a thought that came about because of all the violence in Chicago,&quot; he says. &quot;It happens in Chicago, but it&#x27;s happening around the world in many ways.&quot; He continues, &quot;We was talking about the conditions of what&#x27;s happening, when I say &#x27;nobody&#x27;s smiling.&#x27; But it&#x27;s really a call to action.&quot; On June 4, 2014, it was announced Common signed a recording contract with Def Jam Recordings and No I.D.&#x27;s Artium Records. It was also announced &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Smiling&quot; would be released July 22, 2014. Lonnie &quot;Pops&quot; Lynn was to be featured on this album as well but the recording fell through as Lonnie&#x27;s health declined. A recording was indeed made and is in process of being released on Dirty Laboratory Productions featuring production by AwareNess. 
In 2016 Common released his eleventh studio album titled Black America Again under Def Jam Recordings, the album featured guest appearances by Stevie Wonder, Bilal, Marsha Ambrosius, BJ The Chicago Kid, John Legend, PJ, Syd, Elena &amp; Tasha Cobbs. The album was primarily produced by Karriem Riggins alongside many other contributors including Robert Glasper.

In 2018, Common also announced he would be forming a jazz group called August Greene with Karriem Riggins &amp; Robert Glasper, shortly after this announcement an August Greene album was released through a partnership with Amazon Music. The album featured guest vocals (credited and uncredited) by male singer Samora Pinderhughes and featured award-winning singer Brandy Norwood on two songs titled &quot;Optimistic&quot; and &quot;Time&quot; respectively. On August 30, 2019, Common released his twelfth solo studio album titled Let Love, the album was released by Loma Vista Recordings and Concord Records. The album features guest appearances from Samora Pinderhughes, Daniel Caesar, Swizz Beatz, Leikeli47, BJ the Chicago Kid, A-Trak, Jill Scott, Leon Bridges and Jonathan McReynolds and production of the album was primarily handled by Karriem Riggins and the song titled &quot;HER Love (feat. Daniel Caesar was produced by J. Dilla.

=== Writing ===
Common was invited by First Lady Michelle Obama to appear at a poetry reading on May 11, 2011, at the White House. His poetry was found to be greatly influenced by Maya Angelou&#x27;s works. This invitation caused furor with the New Jersey State Police and their union, who cited some of Common&#x27;s previous lyrical content, most notably the song &quot;A Song For Assata&quot; about Assata Shakur, a member of the Black Liberation Army (and step-aunt of deceased rapper Tupac Shakur) who was convicted in 1977 of the first-degree murder of New Jersey state trooper Werner Foerster. At another poetry reading, Common had stated, &quot;flyers say &#x27;free Mumia&#x27; on my freezer&quot;, a reference to Mumia Abu-Jamal, who murdered Philadelphia Police Officer Daniel Faulkner in 1981.

Jay Carney, the White House Press Secretary at the time, stated that President Obama opposed these particular lyrics, but supported what Common stood for more broadly. Common responded by saying: &quot;I guess Sarah Palin and Fox News doesn&#x27;t like me.&quot; On Facebook, he also stated, &quot;The one thing that shouldn&#x27;t be questioned is my support for the police officers and troops that protect us every day.&quot; Common later discussed the matter with Jon Stewart during a September 14, 2011, appearance on Comedy Central&#x27;s &quot;The Daily Show&quot;.
In September 2011, Common published his memoir, &quot;One Day It&#x27;ll All Make Sense&quot;, through Atria Books. As the book details how his close relationship with his mother influenced his life, it is partially narrated by her.

Common released his second memoir, &quot;Let Love Have The Last Word&quot;, in May 2019. The book highlights his relationship with his daughter Omoye, romantic relationships, his parents, and his struggle to cement his perspective in the concept of love.

=== Activism ===
Common is a vegan and he is a supporter of animal rights and PETA. He appeared in a print advertisement for PETA titled &quot;Think Before You Eat,&quot; and in a documentary titled &quot;Holistic Wellness for the Hip-Hop Generation&quot; where he promoted vegetarianism.

Common is also part of the &quot;Knowing Is Beautiful&quot; movement, which supports HIV/AIDS awareness. He is featured in the video for &quot;Yes We Can,&quot; a song in support of the candidacy of Barack Obama, which made its debut on the internet on February 2, 2008. Common pledged to stop using anti-gay lyrics in his music.

Common is the founder of the Common Ground Foundation, a non-profit that seeks to empower underprivileged youth to be contributing citizens and strong leaders in the world. The foundation includes programs dedicated to leadership development &amp; empowerment, educational development, creative expression, as well as a book club. In 2014, Common Ground inaugurated the AAHH! Fest music festival in Chicago&#x27;s Union Park. After a one-year hiatus, AAHH! Fest returned in 2016, but was canceled one week before showtime in 2017. An official announcement stated the fest would return September 15, 2018.

In 2017, Common performed concerts in several California prisons, as well as on the grounds of the California State Capitol. This concert tour inspired him to found Imagine Justice, another non-profit organization.

In May 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Common launched a social media campaign through Imagine Justice, dubbed #WeMatterToo, with dozens of advocacy and activist groups calling attention to the threat that the pandemic poses for incarcerated men and women and intended to create greater public awareness about conditions facing incarcerated populations. The campaign includes the production of short films that will include recordings of inmates expressing their concern about the coronavirus spreading inside prisons.

Along with other rappers and activists, Common appeared in the award-winning documentary short film &quot;#Bars4Justice&quot;, which was shot in Ferguson, Missouri and produced by &quot;Nation19&quot; Magazine. Common performed with Andra Day in the opening musical performance for the March for Our Lives anti-gun violence rally in Washington, D.C., on March 24, 2018. He also performed at the 50th anniversary of Martin Luther King&#x27;s death in Memphis, at an event co-hosted by the labor union UNITE HERE. Common was later accused of joining anti-union efforts by crossing a UNITE HERE picket line in Boston.

<text>Common Sense is a 47-page pamphlet written by Thomas Paine in 1775–1776 advocating independence from Great Britain to people in the Thirteen Colonies. Writing in clear and persuasive prose, Paine collected various moral and political arguments to encourage common people in the Colonies to fight for egalitarian government. It was published anonymously on January 10, 1776, at the beginning of the American Revolution and became an immediate sensation.

It was sold and distributed widely and read aloud at taverns and meeting places. In proportion to the population of the colonies at that time (2.5 million), it had the largest sale and circulation of any book published in American history. As of 2006, it remains the all-time best-selling American title and is still in print today.

&quot;Common Sense&quot; made public a persuasive and impassioned case for independence, which had not yet been given serious intellectual consideration in either Britain or the American colonies. In England, John Cartwright had published &quot;Letters on American Independence&quot; in the pages of the &quot;Public Advertiser&quot; during the early spring of 1774 advocating legislative independence for the colonies while in Virginia, Thomas Jefferson had penned &quot;A Summary View of British America&quot; three months later. Neither, however, went as far as Paine in proposing full-fledged independence. Paine connected independence with common dissenting Protestant beliefs as a means to present a distinctly American political identity and structured &quot;Common Sense&quot; as if it were a sermon. Historian Gordon S. Wood described &quot;Common Sense&quot; as &quot;the most incendiary and popular pamphlet of the entire revolutionary era.&quot;

The text was translated into French by Antoine Gilbert Griffet de Labaume in 1791.

==Publication==

Paine arrived in the American colonies in November 1774, shortly before the Battles of Lexington and Concord. Though the colonies and Great Britain had commenced hostilities against one another, the thought of independence was not initially entertained. Writing in 1778 of his early experiences in the colonies, Paine &quot;found the disposition of the people such, that they might have been led by a thread and governed by a reed. Their attachment to Britain was obstinate, and it was, at that time, a kind of treason to speak against it. Their ideas of grievance operated without resentment, and their single object was reconciliation.&quot; Paine quickly engrained himself in the Philadelphia newspaper business, and began writing &quot;Common Sense&quot; in late 1775 under the working title of &quot;Plain Truth&quot;. Though it began as a series of letters to be published in various Philadelphia papers, it grew too long and unwieldy to publish as letters, leading Paine to select the pamphlet form.

Benjamin Rush recommended the publisher Robert Bell, promising Paine that although other printers might balk at the content of the pamphlet, Bell would not hesitate or delay its printing. The pamphlet was first published on January 10, 1776. Bell zealously promoted the pamphlet in Philadelphia&#x27;s papers, and demand grew so high as to require a second printing. Paine, overjoyed with its success, endeavored to collect his share of the profits and donate them to purchase mittens for General Montgomery&#x27;s troops, then encamped in frigid Quebec. However, when Paine&#x27;s chosen intermediaries audited Bell&#x27;s accounts, they found that the pamphlet actually had made zero profits. Incensed, Paine ordered Bell not to proceed on a second edition, as he had planned several appendices to add to &quot;Common Sense&quot;. Bell ignored that and began advertising a &quot;new edition.&quot;

While Bell believed that the advertisement would convince Paine to retain his services, it had the opposite effect. Paine secured the assistance of the Bradford brothers, publishers of &quot;The Pennsylvania Evening Post&quot;, and released his new edition, featuring several appendices and additional writings. Bell began working on a second edition. This set off a month-long public debate between Bell and the still-anonymous Paine, conducted within the pages and advertisements of the &quot;Pennsylvania Evening Post&quot;, with each party charging the other with duplicity and fraud. Paine and Bell published several more editions through the end of their public squabble. 

The publicity generated by the initial success and compounded by the publishing disagreements propelled the pamphlet to incredible sales and circulation. Following Paine&#x27;s own estimate of the pamphlet&#x27;s sales, some historians claim that &quot;Common Sense&quot; sold almost 100,000 copies in 1776, and according to Paine, 120,000 copies were sold in the first three months. One biographer estimates that 500,000 copies were sold in the first year (in both America and Europe, predominantly France and Britain), and another writes that Paine&#x27;s pamphlet went through 25 published editions in the first year alone. However, some historians dispute these figures as implausible because of the literate population at the time and estimated the far upper limit as 75,000 copies.

Aside from the printed pamphlet itself, there were many handwritten summaries and whole copies circulated. Paine also granted publishing rights to nearly every imprint which requested them, including several international editions. It was immensely popular in France, where it was published without its diatribes against monarchy. At least one newspaper printed the entire pamphlet: the &quot;Connecticut Courant&quot; in its issue of February 19, 1776. Writing in 1956, Richard Gimbel estimated, in terms of circulation and impact, that an &quot;equivalent sale today, based on the present population of the United States, would be more than six-and-one-half million copies within the short space of three months&quot;.

For nearly three months, Paine managed to maintain his anonymity, even during Bell&#x27;s potent newspaper polemics. His name did not become officially connected with the independence controversy until March 30, 1776. Paine never recouped the profits that he felt were due to him from Bell&#x27;s first edition. Ultimately, he lost money on the Bradford printing as well, and because he decided to repudiate his copyright, he never profited from &quot;Common Sense&quot;.

==Sections==
The first and subsequent editions divided the pamphlet into four sections.

===I. Of the Origin and Design of Government in General, With Concise Remarks on the English Constitution===
In his first section, Paine related common Enlightenment theories of the state of nature to establish a foundation for republican government. Paine began the section by making a distinction between society and government and argues that government is a &quot;necessary evil.&quot; He illustrates the power of society to create and maintain happiness in man through the example of a few isolated people who find it easier to live together rather than apart, thus creating society. As society continues to grow, a government becomes necessary to prevent the natural evil Paine saw in man.

To promote civil society through laws and account for the impossibility of all people meeting centrally to make laws, representation and elections become necessary. As that model was clearly intended to mirror the situation of the colonists at the time of publication, Paine went on to consider the English constitution.

Paine found two tyrannies in the English constitution: monarchical and aristocratic tyranny in the king and peers, who rule by heredity and contribute nothing to the people. Paine criticized the English constitution by examining the relationship between the king, the peers, and the commons.

===II. Of Monarchy and Hereditary Succession===
The second section considers monarchy first from a biblical perspective and then from a historical perspective. He begins by arguing that since all men are equal at creation, the distinction between kings and subjects is a false one. Paine then quotes a sequence of biblical passages to refute the divine right of Kings. After citing , he highlights Gideon&#x27;s refusal to heed the people&#x27;s call to rule, citing . He then reproduces the majority of (wherein Samuel relays God&#x27;s objections to the people&#x27;s demand for a king) and concludes: &quot;the Almighty hath here entered his protest against monarchical government...&quot;

Paine then examines some of the problems that kings and monarchies have caused in the past and concludes:
Paine also attacks one type of &quot;mixed state,&quot; the constitutional monarchy promoted by John Locke, in which the powers of government are separated between a Parliament or Congress, which makes the laws, and a monarch, who executes them. The constitutional monarchy, according to Locke, would limit the powers of the king sufficiently to ensure that the realm would remain lawful rather than easily becoming tyrannical. According to Paine, however, such limits are insufficient. In the mixed state, power tends to concentrate into the hands of the monarch, eventually permitting him to transcend any limitations placed upon him. Paine questions why the supporters of the mixed state, since they concede that the power of the monarch is dangerous, wish to include a monarch in their scheme of government in the first place.

===III. Thoughts on the Present State of American Affairs===
In the third section, Paine examines the hostilities between Britain and the American colonies and argues that the best course of action is independence. Paine proposes a &quot;Continental Charter&quot; (or &quot;Charter of the United Colonies&quot;) that would be an American &quot;Magna Carta&quot;. Paine writes that a Continental Charter &quot;should come from some intermediate body between the Congress and the people&quot; and outlines a Continental Conference that could draft a Continental Charter. Each colony would hold elections for five representatives at large, who would be accompanied by two members of the house of assembly of each colony and two members of Congress from each colony, for a total of nine representatives from each colony in the Continental Conference. The Conference would then meet and draft a Continental Charter that would secure &quot;freedom and property to all men, and… the free exercise of religion&quot;. The Continental Charter would also outline a new national government, which Paine thought would take the form of a Congress.

During the American Revolutionary War, the British implemented several policies which allowed fugitive slaves fleeing from American enslavers to find refuge within British lines. Writing in response to these policies, Paine wrote in the third section that Britain &quot;hath stirred up the Indians and the Negroes to destroy us&quot;.

Paine suggested that a congress may be created in the following way: each colony should be divided in districts, and each district would &quot;send a proper number of delegates to Congress.&quot; Paine thought that each colony should send at least 30 delegates to Congress and that the total number of delegates in Congress should be at least 390. The Congress would meet annually and elect a president. Each colony would be put into a lottery; the president would be elected, by the whole congress, from the delegation of the colony that was selected in the lottery. After a colony was selected, it would be removed from subsequent lotteries until all of the colonies had been selected, at which point the lottery would start anew. Electing a president or passing a law would require three-fifths of the congress.

===IV. Of the Present Ability of America, With Some Miscellaneous Reflections===
The fourth section of the pamphlet includes Paine&#x27;s optimistic view of America&#x27;s military potential at the time of the revolution. For example, he spends pages describing how colonial shipyards, by using the large amounts of lumber available in the country, could quickly create a navy that could rival the Royal Navy.

==Response and impact==

In response to &quot;Common Sense&quot;, Rev. Charles Inglis, then the Anglican cleric of Trinity Church in New York, responded to Paine on behalf of colonists loyal to the Crown with a treatise entitled &quot;The True Interest of America Impartially Stated&quot;. He pronounced &quot;I find no common sense in this pamphlet, but much uncommon frenzy.&quot; He denounced the radical democracy promoted by &quot;Common Sense&quot; and proclaimed that &quot;Limited monarchy is the form of government which is most favourable to liberty - which is best adapted to the genius and temper of Britons; although here and there among us a crack-brained zealot for democracy or absolute monarchy, may be sometimes found.&quot;

Loyalist officer James Chalmers published &quot;Plain Truth&quot; under the pen name &quot;Candidus&quot;. Chalmers defended the British Constitution, and claimed that without the Monarchy, the Thirteen Colonies would descend into a radical democracy. On the Radical democratic society promoted by &quot;Common Sense&quot;, Chalmers quoted Montesquieu in saying that &quot;No government is so subject to &quot;Civil Wars&quot; and &quot;Intestine Commotions&quot;. The pamphlet ends with the pronouncement: &quot;Independence And Slavery Are Synonymous Terms&quot;&quot;.

John Adams, who would succeed George Washington to become the new nation&#x27;s second president, in his &quot;Thoughts on Government&quot; wrote that Paine&#x27;s ideal sketched in &quot;Common Sense&quot; was &quot;so democratical, without any restraint or even an attempt at any equilibrium or counter poise, that it must produce confusion and every evil work.&quot; Others, such as the writer calling himself &quot;Cato,&quot; denounced Paine as dangerous and his ideas as violent. Paine was also an active and willing participant in what would become essentially a six-month publicity tour for independence. Writing as &quot;The Forester,&quot; he responded to Cato and other critics in the pages of Philadelphian papers with passion and declared again in sweeping language that their conflict was not only with Great Britain but also with the tyranny inevitably resulting from monarchical rule.

Heavy advertisement by both Bell and Paine and the immense publicity created by their publishing quarrel made &quot;Common Sense&quot; an immediate sensation not only in Philadelphia but also across the Thirteen Colonies. Early &quot;reviewers&quot; (mainly letter excerpts published anonymously in colonial newspapers) touted the clear and rational case for independence put forth by Paine. One Marylander wrote to the &quot;Pennsylvania Evening Post&quot; on February 6, 1776, that &quot;if you know the author of COMMON SENSE, tell him he has done wonders and worked miracles. His stile is plain and nervous; his facts are true; his reasoning, just and conclusive&quot;.

The author went on to claim that the pamphlet was highly persuasive in swaying people towards independence. The mass appeal, one later reviewer noted, was caused by Paine&#x27;s dramatic calls for popular support of revolution, &quot;giv[ing] liberty to every individual to contribute materials for that great building, the grand charter of American Liberty&quot;. Paine&#x27;s vision of a radical democracy, unlike the checked and balanced nation later favored by conservatives like John Adams, was highly attractive to the popular audience which read and reread &quot;Common Sense&quot;. In the months leading up to the Declaration of Independence, many more reviewers noted that the two main themes (direct and passionate style and calls for individual empowerment) were decisive in swaying the Colonists from reconciliation to rebellion. The pamphlet was also highly successful because of a brilliant marketing tactic planned by Paine. He and Bell timed the first edition to be published at around the same time as a proclamation on the colonies by King George III, hoping to contrast the strong, monarchical message with the heavily anti-monarchical &quot;Common Sense&quot;. Luckily for Paine, the speech and the first advertisement of the pamphlet appeared on the same day within the pages of &quot;The Pennsylvania Evening Post&quot;.

While Paine focused his style and address towards the common people, the arguments he made touched on prescient debates of morals, government, and the mechanisms of democracy. That gave Common Sense a &quot;second life&quot; in the very public call-and-response nature of newspaper debates made by intellectual men of letters throughout Philadelphia. Paine&#x27;s formulation of &quot;war for an idea&quot; led to, as Eric Foner describes it, &quot;a torrent of letters, pamphlets, and broadsides on independence and the meaning of republican government... attacking or defending, or extending and refining Paine&#x27;s ideas&quot;.

Later scholars have assessed the influence of &quot;Common Sense&quot; in several ways. Some, like A. Owen Aldridge, emphasize that &quot;Common Sense&quot; could hardly be said to embody a particular ideology, and that &quot;even Paine himself may not have been cognizant of the ultimate source of many of his concepts.&quot; They make the point that much of the pamphlet&#x27;s value came as a result of the context in which it was published. Eric Foner wrote that the pamphlet touched a radical populace at the height of their radicalism, which culminated in Pennsylvania with a new constitution aligned along Paine&#x27;s principles. Many have noted that Paine&#x27;s skills were chiefly in persuasion and propaganda and that no matter the content of his ideas, the fervor of his conviction and the various tools he employed on his readers (such as asserting his Christianity when he really was a Deist), &quot;Common Sense&quot; was bound for success. Still others emphasized the uniqueness of Paine&#x27;s vision, with Craig Nelson calling him a &quot;pragmatic utopian&quot; who de-emphasized economic arguments in favor of moralistic ones, thus giving credence to the argument that &quot;Common Sense&quot; was propaganda.

<doc id="210472" wikidata="Q44541" url="?curid=210472" title="Pancake">
<text>A pancake, also known as a hotcake, griddlecake, or flapjack, is a flat cake, often thin and round, prepared from a starch-based batter that may contain eggs, milk, and butter, and then cooked on a hot surface such as a griddle or frying pan. It is a type of batter bread. Archaeological evidence suggests that pancakes were probably eaten in prehistoric societies.

The pancake&#x27;s shape and structure varies worldwide. In England, pancakes are often unleavened and resemble a crêpe. In Scotland and North America, a leavening agent is used (typically baking powder) creating a thick fluffy pancake. A &quot;crêpe&quot; is a thin pancake of Breton origin cooked on one or both sides in a special pan or crepe maker to achieve a lacelike network of fine bubbles. A well-known variation originating from southeast Europe is palatschinke, a thin moist pancake fried on both sides and filled with jam, cream cheese, chocolate, or ground walnuts, but many other fillings—sweet or savoury—can also be used.

Commercially prepared pancake mixes are available in some countries. Like waffles, commercially prepared frozen pancakes are available from companies like Eggo. When buttermilk is used in place of or in addition to milk, the pancake develops a tart flavor and becomes known as a buttermilk pancake, which is common in Scotland, Ireland and the US. Buckwheat flour can be used in a pancake batter, making for a type of buckwheat pancake, a category that includes blini, kaletez, ploye, and memil-buchimgae. When potato is used as a major portion of the batter, the result is a potato pancake. 

Pancakes may be served at any time of the day or year with a variety of toppings or fillings, but they have developed associations with particular times and toppings in different regions. In North America, they are typically considered a breakfast food and serve a similar function to waffles. In Britain and the Commonwealth, they are associated with Shrove Tuesday, commonly known as &quot;Pancake Day&quot;, when, historically, perishable ingredients had to be used up before the fasting period of Lent.

==History==

The Ancient Greeks made pancakes called τηγανίτης (&quot;tēganitēs&quot;), ταγηνίτης (&quot;tagēnitēs&quot;) or ταγηνίας (&quot;tagēnias&quot;), all words deriving from τάγηνον (&quot;tagēnon&quot;), &quot;frying pan&quot;. The earliest attested references to &quot;tagenias&quot; are in the works of the 5th-century BC poets Cratinus and Magnes. Tagenites were made with wheat flour, olive oil, honey, and curdled milk, and were served for breakfast. Another kind of pancake was σταιτίτης (&quot;staititēs&quot;), from σταίτινος (&quot;staitinos&quot;), &quot;of flour or dough of spelt&quot;, derived from σταῖς (&quot;stais&quot;), &quot;flour of spelt&quot;. Athenaeus mentions, in his Deipnosophistae, &quot;staititas&quot; topped with honey, sesame, and cheese. The Middle English word &quot;pancake&quot; appears in English in the 15th century.

The Ancient Romans called their fried concoctions &quot;alia dulcia&quot;, Latin for &quot;other sweets&quot;. These were much different from what are known as pancakes today.

==Regional varieties==
===Africa===

====Horn of Africa====
Pancakes in the Horn of Africa (Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia and Somalia) are known as &quot;injera&quot; (sometimes transliterated as &quot;enjera&quot;, &quot;budenaa&quot; (Oromo), or &quot;canjeero&quot; (Somali)). &quot;Injera&quot; is a yeast-risen flatbread with a unique, slightly spongy texture. Traditionally, it is made out of teff flour and is a national dish in Ethiopia and Eritrea. &quot;Canjeero&quot;, also known as &quot;lahooh&quot; or &quot;lahoh&quot;, is a similar kind of flatbread eaten in Somalia and Yemen.

In Eritrea and Ethiopia, &quot;injera&quot; are usually served with one or more stews known as &quot;wat&quot; or with salads (especially, for instance, during periods of Ethiopian Orthodox fasting) or with other injera (&quot;injera firfir&quot;). The right hand is used to tear small pieces from the &quot;injera&quot; to use to pick up and eat the stews or salads. The &quot;injera&quot; under these stews soaks up juices and flavours and, after the stews and salads are finished, is also consumed. &quot;Injera&quot; thus acts simultaneously as food, eating utensil, and plate. When the &quot;tablecloth&quot; formed by the &quot;injera&quot; is finished, the meal is over.

&quot;Lahoh&quot; is a pancake-like bread originating in Somalia, Djibouti and Yemen. It is often eaten along with honey, ghee and tea. During lunch, &quot;lahoh&quot; is sometimes consumed with curry, soup or stew.

====Kenya====
In Kenya, pancakes are eaten for breakfast as an alternative to bread. They are served plain with the sugar already added to the batter to sweeten them. Kenyan pancakes are similar to English pancakes and French crepes.

====South Africa====
A &quot;pancake&quot; in South Africa is a crêpe. In Afrikaans, it is known as a &quot;pannekoek&quot; (plural &quot;pannekoeke&quot;) and, traditionally, is prepared on gas stoves and eaten on wet and cold days. &quot;Pannekoeke&quot; are usually served with cinnamon-flavoured sugar (and, sometimes, lemon juice) that is either allowed to dissolve into and soften them or, if their crispy texture is to be retained, eaten immediately. They are a staple at Dutch Reformed Church fêtes.

&quot;Plaatkoekies&quot; (&quot;flapjacks&quot;, or lit. &quot;plate cookies&quot;) are American-style &quot;silver dollar&quot; pancakes.

====Uganda====
In Uganda, pancakes are locally made with bananas (one of the staple foods of the country) and usually served as a breakfast or as a snack option.

===East Asia===
====China====
Chinese pancakes may be either savoury or sweet, and are generally made with dough rather than batter. The dough mostly consists of water, flour, and vegetable oil. The dish can be served as a side, usually alongside duck, or as a snack, topped with scallions along with hot and sour sauce.

====Japan====

In Japan, &quot;okonomiyaki&quot; are made from flour, egg, cabbage and a choice of ingredients. &quot;Oyaki&quot; are pancakes often stuffed with anko, eggplant, or nozawana. &quot;Dorayaki&quot; are a sort of sandwich made from Western-style pancakes and anko. Sweet crepes are also very popular.

The Japanese have also created a soufflé-style cooked-in rings-pancake, which is taller and fluffier than the American pancakes it is inspired by, and found in Singapore, Toronto, Australia, and the United Kingdom.

====Korea====
In Korea, pancakes include savoury &quot;buchimgae&quot; (Korean pancakes) and &quot;jeon&quot; (egged and battered pan-fries, sometime pancakes), &quot;bindae-tteok&quot; (pan-friend mung bean cakes), as well as sweet &quot;hotteok&quot; (filled sweet pancake). These may be served during all times of the day as side dishes or just snacks. Variants of the dish use the batter of the pancake to make deep fried vegetables, meat, or fish.

===South Asia===
====India====
India has many styles of pancake. Variations range from their taste to the main ingredient used. All are made without the use of added raising agents. Pancakes prepared using a north Indian cooking style are known as &quot;cheela&quot;. Sweet &quot;cheela&quot; are made using sugar or jaggery with a wheat flour-based batter. North Indian salty pancakes are made using batter prepared from gram flour or green gram paste (&quot;moong daal&quot;) and are sometimes garnished with &quot;paneer&quot;, a cottage-style cheese. 

&quot;Dosa&quot;, &quot;appam&quot;, &quot;neer dosa&quot; and &quot;uttapam&quot; are pancakes made in a south Indian cooking style. They are prepared by fermenting rice batter and split-skinned urad bean (black lentil) blended with water. &quot;Meetha pooda&quot; – sweet pancakes often eaten with pickles and chutney – are a common breakfast food item in the Punjab. Most of the &quot;pitha&quot; in Assam are types of pancakes served on occasions such as Bihu festivals. The Bengali semi-sweet pancake &quot;pati-shapta&quot; is stuffed with grated coconut or thickened milk.

In Western India, the multi-grain &quot;thalipeeth&quot; is popular. In Goa, a traditional crêpe-like pancake known as &quot;alebele&quot; or &quot;alle belle&quot; is eaten at tea-time. It is usually filled with jaggery and coconut. In Eastern India, &quot;malpuas&quot; are sometimes prepared in the form of pancakes. In some regions of Middle India, thin green Cheelas are made with ginger or garlic leaves&#x27; paste, and rice flour batter. Other ingredients included are salt, cummin seeds, green chili, oil, curry leaves and coriander leaves.

====Nepal====
In Nepal, the Newar people have a savoury rice pancake called &quot;chataamari&quot; cooked with meat or eggs on top. This dish is also known as the &quot;Newari Pizza&quot;, as it is served and eaten similarly to American pizza. Besides being served with meat or eggs, it can also be served plain.

Bangladesh

Chitoi pitha is a popular Bangladeshi steamed pancake made from rice flour. It&#x27;s a traditional dish often enjoyed during festivals and special occasions. The batter is typically made with a blend of rice flour, water, and sometimes other ingredients like coconut milk or jaggery. The batter is then poured into a heated pan or mold and steamed until cooked through. Chitoi pitha is often served with sweet toppings like jaggery or molasses, or savory accompaniments like lentil curry or fish curry.

====Pakistan====
In Pakistani cuisine, &quot;rishiki&quot; is a pancake, slightly thicker than a crepe, which is made from whole wheat flour, water and eggs and usually served with honey. It is widely consumed in the far north and is a staple of Chitrali cuisine.

====Sri Lanka====
Sri Lankan Coconut Pancakes or පොල් පැණි පෑන්කේක් (&quot;pol pani pancake&quot;) are spiced sweet coconut filling wrapped in a thin crepe, which is made from flour, eggs and coconut milk, with turmeric added to give a yellow color.

===Southeast Asia===
Banana pancakes are a menu item in backpacker-oriented cafes in Southeast Asia. This has given rise to the term &quot;Banana Pancake Trail&quot; or &quot;Banana Pancake Circuit&quot;, given to the growing routes travelled by backpackers across Malaysia, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam.

====Indonesia====
Pancakes in Indonesia are called &quot;panekuk&quot;. The Indonesian pancake &quot;serabi&quot; is made from rice flour and coconut milk. The dish is often served with &quot;kinca&quot;, a thick, brown-colored coconut sugar syrup. Other toppings may include sugar, ground peanuts, sliced bananas, jackfruit, and other fruits, and chocolate. Other variations include cheddar cheese, corned beef, shredded chicken, and sausage.

Other types of pancakes in Indonesia are &quot;burgo&quot;, &quot;dadar gulung&quot;, &quot;kue ape&quot;, &quot;kue apem&quot;, &quot;kue cubit&quot;, &quot;kue cucur&quot;, &quot;kue leker&quot;, &quot;kue terang bulan&quot;, &quot;laklak&quot;, &quot;martabak&quot;, &quot;pannenkoek&quot;, &quot;poffertjes&quot;, &quot;roti canai&quot;, and &quot;roti jala&quot;.

====Malaysia ====
The traditional Malay pancake in Malaysia is called Pek Nga or &quot;Lempeng Kelapa&quot;. Cooked very similarly to an American or Canadian –style pancake, albeit without a rising agent, it is a savoury pancake usually served during the breakfast hours with fish curry, coconut sticky rice, dried fish, &quot;rendang&quot;, or &quot;sambal&quot;.

==== Myanmar (Burma) ====
The traditional Burmese pancake is called bein mont, and is a traditional Burmese snack or &quot;mont&quot;. The pancake is baked in a rice flour batter immersed in jaggery, coconut shavings and garnished with sesame seeds, peanuts and poppy seeds.

====Philippines====
In the Philippines, traditional dessert pancakes include &quot;salukara&quot;, a rice pancake made from glutinous rice, eggs, and coconut milk. The batter is placed in a clay pot or pan lined with banana leaves or greased with oil (traditionally lard), and is baked over hot coals. &quot;Salukara&quot; is a subtype of &quot;bibingka&quot; (Philippine baked rice cakes). &quot;Panyalam&quot;, a similar rice pancake from Mindanao, is deep-fried rather than baked.

Traditional savory pancakes in the Philippines include &quot;pudpod&quot; (smoked fish flake pancakes) and &quot;okoy&quot; (a pancake made of battered shrimp, pumpkin, or sweet potatoes).

The American style of pancakes is also a common offering in fast-food establishments in the Philippines, usually as a breakfast fare, as well as in specialty restaurants like IHOP and the local restaurant brand Pancake House. The inexpensive local counterpart, called &quot;hotcakes&quot;, aside from being commonly prepared for breakfast, is also prepared as an afternoon snack, with street kiosks selling small hotcakes topped with the choice of margarine, sugar, or condensed milk and flavored syrups.

==== Vietnam ====
In Vietnamese cuisine there is a variety of dishes that are called pancakes (&quot;bánh xèo&quot;, &quot;bánh khọt&quot;, which are sometimes called Vietnamese pancakes), as well as similar dishes such as &quot;bánh căn&quot; and &quot;bánh khoái&quot; in central Vietnam.

===Europe===
====Austria, Czech Republic, and Romania, Slovakia, and former Yugoslavia====
In Austria, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia, pancakes are called &quot;palatschinke&quot;, &quot;palačinka&quot; and &quot;palacinka&quot;, respectively (plural: &quot;palatschinken&quot;, &quot;palačinky&quot;, and &quot;palacinky&quot;). &quot;Kaiserschmarrn&quot; is an Austrian pancake including raisins, almonds, apple jam or small pieces of apple, split into pieces, and sprinkled with powdered sugar. In Romania, they are called &quot;clătită&quot; (plural: &quot;clătite&quot;). In countries of former Yugoslavia, they are called &quot;palačinka&quot; (plural: &quot;palačinke&quot;). In these languages, the word derives from the Latin &quot;placenta&quot;, meaning &quot;cake&quot;. These pancakes are thin and filled with apricot, plum, lingonberry, apple or strawberry jam, chocolate sauce, or hazelnut spread. Eurokrem, Nutella, and Lino-Lada fillings are favourite among the younger population. A traditional version includes filling pancakes with cheese, pouring yoghurt over them, and then baking in an oven.

====Eastern Europe====

Eastern-Slavic cuisines have a long tradition of pancake cooking and include a variety of pancake types. In Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine, pancakes may be breakfast food, appetizers, main courses, or desserts.

&quot;Blini&quot; () or &quot;mlynci&quot; () are thin pancakes, somewhat thicker than crêpes, made from wheat or buckwheat flour, butter, eggs, and milk, with yeast added to the batter. The preparation of blini/mlynci dates back to pagan traditions and feasts, which are reflected in today&#x27;s &quot;pancake week&quot; celebrated in the winter before the Great Lent. In pre-Christian times, blini and mlynci were symbolically considered by early Slavic peoples as a symbol of the sun, due to their round form.
Blintzes ( &quot;blinchiki&quot;) are thin crêpes made without yeast. Filled blintzes are also referred to as &quot;nalysnyky&quot; (), &quot;nalistniki&quot; () or &quot;nalesniki&quot; (). A filling such as jam, fruits, quark, or cottage cheese, potato, cooked ground meat or chicken, and even chopped mushrooms, bean sprouts, cabbage, and onions, is rolled or enveloped into a pre-fried blintz and then the blintz is lightly re-fried, sautéed, or baked.

Traditionally, Ashkenazi Jews who, prior to 1945, lived in what is today Poland, portions of the Czech Republic, Hungary, and other portions of the former Pale of Settlement also created blintzes, with the key difference of always using a kosher cheese filling with no rennet. The majority of recipes are sweet and are often served with berries or sour cream. These crepe-like dishes would often be served during Shavuot, and today the recipe still survives in places like Israel and New York. Latkes, potato pancakes with finely shredded or grated potato, can be eaten as part of the celebration of Hanukkah.

Small thick pancakes are called &quot;oladyi&quot; () or &quot;oladky&quot; (). The batter may contain various additions, such as apple and raisins.

There also exists a style of pancake made out of quark called syrniki.

====Denmark====
&quot;Æbleskiver&quot; are traditional Danish pancakes made in a distinctive spherical shape. (The name literally means &quot;apple slices&quot; in Danish, although apples are not an ingredient.) &quot;Æbleskiver&quot; are cooked on the stove top by baking in a special cast iron pan with several hemispherical indentations. Batter is poured into the oiled indentations and as the &quot;æbleskiver&quot; begin to cook, they are turned with a knitting needle, skewer or fork to give the cakes their characteristic spherical shape. &quot;Æbleskiver&quot; are not sweet themselves but are traditionally served dipped in raspberry, strawberry, lingonberry or blackberry jam and sprinkled with powdered sugar.

====Finland====

Finnish pancakes greatly resemble &quot;plättar&quot; (see the description in the Sweden section below) and are called &quot;lettu&quot;, &quot;lätty&quot;, &quot;räiskäle&quot; or &quot;ohukainen&quot;. In Finland pancakes are usually eaten as dessert with whipped cream or pancake-jam, sugar or vanilla ice cream. Besides the plain &quot;lettu&quot;, there is also a version with stinging nettle added (&quot;nokkoslettu&quot;, pl. &quot;nokkosletut&quot;). In Finnish, &quot;lettu&quot; and &quot;pannukakku&quot; (literally &quot;pancake&quot;) have different meanings, the latter having a structurally closer resemblance to a hotcake, and is baked in an oven instead of using a frying pan. &quot;Ålandspannkaka&quot;, literally &quot;pancake of Åland&quot;, is an extra thick variety of oven-made pancake that includes the addition of cardamom and either rice pudding or semolina porridge to the dough; it is only served in Åland and usually on its Autonomy Day. Besides the sweet &quot;lettu&quot;, which is eaten as a dessert, there are savory spinach pancakes (&quot;pinaattilettu&quot;, pl. &quot;pinaattiletut&quot;), which are eaten as a main course, typically with boiled potatoes and lingonberry jam. These are available ready-made from multiple brands.

====France, Belgium, Italy, Portugal, and Switzerland====
&quot;Crêpes&quot;, popular in France, Belgium, Switzerland and Portugal, are made from flour, milk, and eggs. They are thin pancakes and are served with a sweet (fruit, ice cream, jam, chocolate spread, powdered sugar) or savoury filling (cheese, ham, seafood, spinach). In Francophone Europe, crêpes are often sold in special stands.
In Italy there is a similar dish called &quot;crespella&quot; or &quot;scrippella&quot;. In this country are also popular some traditional waffle cookies called pizzelle and in some part of Tuscany there are typical thin crispy pancakes named &quot;brigidini&quot;, made with aniseed.
In Brittany, a &quot;galette&quot; (or &quot;galette bretonne&quot;) is a large thin pancake made of buckwheat flour, often cooked on one side only.

Crêpes are popular in many South American countries such as Argentina, Brazil, and Chile. They are consumed with sweet fillings (marmalade, dulce de leche) or with salty fillings (ground meat (Brazil), vegetables, tomato sauce, cheese).

They have also become popular East Asian countries, including Japan, South Korea and China, and Southeast Asian countries, such as the Philippines and Thailand, where they are sold in crêpe stands and kiosks. They are often served with whipped cream and fruits, or non-sweet spreads such as vegetables.

&quot;Farinata&quot; are popular in Mediterranean regions, including Nice. Also called &quot;socca&quot;, these are pancakes made from chickpea flour and seasoned with black pepper. They are popular street food in Nice.

====Germany====

German pancakes are known as &quot;Pfannkuchen&quot; (from the German &quot;Pfanne&quot; and &quot;Kuchen&quot; meaning &quot;pan&quot; and &quot;cake&quot;) except in Berlin, Brandenburg and Saxony, where &quot;Pfannkuchen&quot; are Berliner pastries and pancakes are known as &quot;Eierkuchen&quot;. They are generally thicker than French-style crêpes and usually served with sweet or, occasionally, savoury fillings. Usage of a leavening agent or yeast is uncommon. Fried apple rings covered by pancake dough and served with sugar and cinnamon are called &quot;Apfelküchle&quot;. &quot;Kaiserschmarrn&quot;, a thick but light caramelized pancake popular in Bavaria and regions of the former Austria-Hungary, is usually split into pieces, filled with fruits or nuts, sprinkled with powdered sugar and served with a fruit sauce.

In Swabia, pancakes sliced into ribbons (&quot;Flädle&quot;) are often served in soup.

====Great Britain====

=====England=====
English pancakes have three key ingredients: plain flour, eggs, and milk, though Gervase Markham&#x27;s 1615 version in &quot;The English Huswife&quot; used water instead of milk, and added sweet spices. The batter is runny and forms a thin layer on the bottom of the frying pan when the pan is tilted. It may form some bubbles during cooking, which results in a pale pancake with dark spots where the bubbles were, but the pancake does not rise. English pancakes are similar to French crêpes and Italian crespelle. They may be eaten as a sweet dessert with the traditional topping of lemon juice and sugar, drizzled with golden syrup, or wrapped around savoury stuffings and eaten as a main course. On Shrove Tuesday, it is customary to eat pancakes with one of the usual toppings. Yorkshire pudding is made from a similar recipe, but baked instead of fried. This batter rises because the air beaten into the batter expands, without the need for baking powder; the result is eaten as part of the traditional roast beef dinner. Staffordshire oatcakes are a savoury variety of pancake particularly associated with that county.

A variation of pancake is the crumpet, made from a batter leavened with yeast (or with both yeast and baking powder) and fried in butter to produce a slightly raised flat cake. They are also eaten in the rest of the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, and certain areas of the Commonwealth.
=====Scotland=====
Pancakes (also called &quot;Scotch pancakes&quot; or &quot;Scottish pancakes&quot;) are more like the American type. In parts of Scotland they are also referred to as &quot;drop scones&quot; or &quot;dropped scones&quot;. They are made from flour, eggs, sugar, buttermilk or milk, salt, bicarbonate of soda and cream of tartar. Smaller than American or English pancakes at about in diameter, they are made by the traditional method of dropping batter onto a griddle (a &quot;girdle&quot; in Northumberland or in Scots). They can be served with jam and cream or just with butter. In Scotland pancakes are generally served at teatime.

=====Wales=====
Welsh pancakes, known as &quot;crempog&quot;, &quot;ffroes&quot; and other names, vary considerably. Generally, they are thick and layered on top of each other to form a tall mock-cake, but some are very much like American pancakes, others may be made with yeast (called &quot;crempog furum&quot;) or oatmeal (although this is also true of American pancakes) and some are like Scotch pancakes. &quot;Crumpets&quot; and &quot;pikelets&quot; are sometimes considered a variety of pancake.

====Greece and Cyprus====
Greek pancakes are called &quot;teganites&quot; ( and are smaller sized pancakes that can be either sweet or savoury. Their main ingredients are flour, olive oil or butter, milk and eggs. They are usually drizzled with plain sugar or honey and cinnamon and sometimes topped with cheese, nuts, fruits or vegetables. Teganites can be served for breakfast or dessert, and in some places like Corfu and Patras are customarily served in the feast days of Saint Spyridon and Saint Andrew. 

In Cyprus, pancakes are also called teganites and are used in an alternative dish called Genoese cannelloni, which includes ground meat with tomato sauce, cheese and occasionally bechamel sauce.

====Hungary====
In Hungary, pancakes known as &quot;palacsinta&quot; (derived from the Latin &quot;placenta&quot;) are made from flour, milk or soda water, sugar, and eggs. Sweet wine may be added to the batter. The filling is usually jam, sugared and ground walnuts or poppy seeds, sugared cottage cheese, sugared cocoa, or cinnamon powder, but meat and mushroom fillings are also used (see &quot;Hortobágyi palacsinta&quot;). &quot;Gundel palacsinta&quot; is a Hungarian pancake stuffed with walnuts, zest, raisins and rum that is served in chocolate sauce and is often flambéed. Hungarian pancakes are served as a main dish or as a dessert.

====Iceland====
Icelandic crepe-like pancakes are called &quot;pönnukaka&quot; (pl. &quot;pönnukökur&quot;), whereas smaller, thicker and denser pancakes resembling North American pancakes are called &quot;lumma&quot; or &quot;skonsa&quot;. The pancakes are usually a bit browner than traditional Swedish ones. &quot;Pönnukökur&quot; are usually cooked on a special Icelandic pancake pan, which is made to get the pancake as thin as possible, which is traditionally never washed or rinsed, not even with water. &quot;Pönnukökur&quot; are traditionally served rolled up with sugar or folded with jam and whipped cream, but if eaten at a café they might contain ice cream instead. Pönnukökur are also a popular dessert in North America among people of Icelandic descent.

In Iceland, North American-style pancakes are cut in half and used as sandwich bread, similar to Icelandic flatbread.

====Netherlands====
In the Netherlands, pancakes are known as &quot;pannenkoeken&quot; and are mostly eaten at lunch and dinner time. Pancake restaurants are popular with families and serve many sweet, savoury, and stuffed varieties. Pannenkoeken are slightly thicker than crêpes and usually quite large, or so in diameter. The batter is egg-based and fillings include such items as sliced apples, cheese, ham, bacon, and candied ginger, alone or in combination.

&quot;Stroop&quot;, a thick molasses-like sugar beet-based syrup is also popular, particularly in a classic filling of bacon and stroop.

&quot;Poffertjes&quot; are another Dutch quick bread, similar to American pancakes but sweeter and much smaller. Made in a specially dimpled copper or cast iron pan, they are flipped once with a fork. Unlike Dutch pancakes, the batter for poffertjes contains baking powder and therefore they have a softer interior than pancakes.

A spekdik is a pancake-like food which is traditionally eaten in the provinces Groningen and Drenthe in the Netherlands around New Year. Unlike pancakes, a spekdik is cooked with a waffle iron. The main ingredients of a spekdik are syrup, eggs and rye-flour, and some varieties include bacon.

====Poland====
In Poland, thin crêpe-style pancakes are called &quot;naleśniki&quot; (pronounced ). They are usually rolled and served with a variety of savoury or sweet fillings as a main dish or a dessert. Sweet fillings include fresh fruits (e.g. bilberries), jams (often apple jam), and soft white cheese with sugar. Savoury fillings include fried vegetables, fried chicken, minced meat, spinach, and a variety of added ingredients such as potatoes, mushrooms, cabbage or ham. Another Polish dish reassembling pancakes are &quot;racuchy&quot;. They are smaller and thicker than &quot;naleśniki&quot; and can be stuffed with apple slices.

====Spain and Portugal====
Iberian pancakes are called &quot;frixuelos&quot; or &quot;filloas&quot; and are very popular in Portugal and the north-west of Spain. They are made from flour, milk, and eggs. They are thin and are usually served with a large amount of sugar or honey. They are a typical Carnival sweet dessert in Portugal, Galicia, Asturias and León.

====Sweden and Norway====
Nordic pancakes are similar to French-style crêpes. In some Nordic countries, they are served with jam or fruit, often lingonberry or strawberry jam as a dessert with a variety of savoury fillings. Traditional Swedish variations can be exotic. Besides the usual thin pancakes, called &quot;pannkakor&quot;, which resemble the French crêpes and, often served with whipped cream and jam, are traditionally eaten for lunch on Thursdays with pea soup, the Swedish cuisine also has &quot;plättar&quot; — very small pancakes, which resemble tiny English pancakes, and are usually fried in a special pan called a &quot;plättlagg&quot;, a sort of frying pan with indentations to allow for several (normally seven) to be made at once. Another type of pancake is the &quot;ugnspannkaka&quot; (oven pancake), which is very thick and resembles German pancakes and is baked in the oven. There is also a variant that includes fried pork in the batter, &quot;fläskpannkaka&quot; (pork pancake).

Potato pancakes called &quot;raggmunk&quot; contain shredded raw potato, and may contain other vegetables (sometimes the pancake batter is omitted, producing &quot;rårakor&quot;). &quot;Raggmunk&quot; and &quot;rårakor&quot; are traditionally eaten with pork rinds and lingonberry jam. A special Swedish pancake is &quot;saffron pancake&quot; from Gotland, made with saffron and rice, baked in the oven. It is common to add lemon juice to the sugar for extra taste. The pancakes are often served after a soup. Another special &quot;Swedish pancake&quot; is the &quot;äggakaka&quot; (eggcake), also called &quot;skånsk äggakaka&quot; (Scanian eggcake), which is almost like an ordinary Swedish pancake but it is a lot thicker and also much more difficult to make due to the risk of burning it. It is made in a frying pan, is about thick, and is served with lingonberries and bacon. The Norwegian variety is commonly eaten for dinner, traditionally with bacon, jam (typically bilberry) or sugar.

===North America===

====Costa Rica====
Costa Rican &quot;chorreadas&quot; are similar to &quot;cachapas&quot;.

====Guatemala====
Guatemalan pancakes are called &quot;panqueques&quot;. They are made with the same ingredients as American pancakes. The toppings are usually fruits and honey. They are a very popular breakfast meal in Guatemala. Depending on the region, the &quot;panqueque&quot; can be thin as a crêpe or as fluffy as a North American pancake.

====Mexico====
Mexican &quot;hotcakes&quot; are similar to American pancakes. Crêpes became popular toward the end of the 19th century after their introduction by the French sometime between the First French Intervention (1838) and the Second French Intervention in Mexico (1861–67). Hotcakes are often made with cornmeal, as well as, or instead of wheat flour. Hotcakes are popular breakfast items at restaurants throughout the country and are often sold by street vendors in cities and during the local celebrations of towns throughout the day. They are also sold during fairs; the vendors sell a single hotcake topped with different sauces such as condensed milk, fruit jam or a sweet goat milk spread called &quot;cajeta&quot;.

====United States and Canada====

American and Canadian pancakes (sometimes called &quot;hotcakes&quot;, &quot;griddlecakes&quot;, or &quot;flapjacks&quot;) are usually served at breakfast, in a stack of two or three, topped with maple syrup or table syrup, and butter. They are often served with other items such as bacon, toast, eggs or sausage. Other popular topping alternatives include jam, peanut butter, nuts, fruit, honey, powdered sugar, whipped cream, cane syrup, cinnamon and sugar, and molasses. In addition, when a pancake is occasionally served as a dessert, toppings such as ice cream, chocolate syrup, and various fruits are often used.

The thick batter contains eggs, flour, milk, and a leavening agent such as baking powder. The batter can have ingredients such as buttermilk, blueberries, strawberries, bananas, apples, chocolate chips, cheese, or sugar added. Spices such as cinnamon, vanilla and nutmeg can also be used. Yogurt may be used to give the pancakes a relatively moist consistency. Pancakes may be thick and are typically between in diameter.

&quot;Bannock&quot; is a Scottish version made from oatmeal. The bannock of native North Americans was made of corn, nut meal and plant bulb meal. Each region had its own variation of flour and fruit. Today, bannock is most often deep-fried, pan-fried and oven-baked.

&quot;Johnnycake&quot; (also &quot;jonnycake&quot;, &quot;johnny cake&quot;, &quot;journey cake&quot; or &quot;Johnny Bread&quot;) is a cornmeal flatbread that was an early American staple food, and is still eaten in the West Indies and Bermuda. The modern johnnycake is stereotypically identified with today&#x27;s Rhode Island foods, though they are a cultural staple in all of the northern US. A modern johnnycake is fried cornmeal gruel, which is made from yellow or white cornmeal mixed with salt and hot water or milk, and frequently lightly sweetened.

&quot;Yaniqueques&quot; or &quot;yanikeke&quot; are a Dominican Republic version of the johnnycake. They are a fried bread rather than a pancake, and are a popular beach food.

Sourdough was used by prospectors and pioneers to make pancakes without having to buy yeast. Prospectors would carry a pot of sourdough to make pancakes and bread, as it could last indefinitely, needing only flour and water to replenish it. Sourdough pancakes are now a particular speciality in Alaska. They are also found in many American pancake houses and restaurants elsewhere in America.

A &quot;silver dollar pancake&quot; refers to a pancake about in diameter, or just a bit bigger than the pre-1979 silver dollar coins in the United States. This is usually made by frying a small spoonful of the same batter as any other pancake. One serving usually consists of five to ten silver dollar pancakes.

&quot;German pancakes&quot; or &quot;Dutch baby pancakes&quot; served in American pancake houses are bowl-shaped. They are eaten with lemons and powdered sugar, jam, or caramelized apples, as well as fritters. A David Eyre&#x27;s pancake is a variation on the German pancake named for the American writer and editor David W. Eyre (1912–2008).

&quot;Toutons&quot; are small, tall pancakes traditional in Newfoundland. They are usually served with dark molasses.

===Oceania===

====Australia and New Zealand====
In Australia and New Zealand, small pancakes (about in diameter) known as &quot;pikelets&quot; or &quot;drop scones&quot; are also eaten. They are traditionally served with jam or jam and whipped cream, or solely with butter, at afternoon tea, but can also be served at morning tea. They are made with milk, self-raising flour, eggs, and sometimes a small amount of icing sugar.

In some circles in New Zealand, very thin, crêpe-like or English pancake-like pancakes (around in diameter) are served with butter, or butter and lemon, sugar, and then rolled up and eaten.

American-style pancakes are also popular. They are eaten for breakfast or as a dessert, with lemon juice and sugar, butter and maple syrup, fruits (sometimes stewed) such as strawberries and cream, ice cream, or mascarpone.

===South America===

====Brazil====
 (), () or () are cassava (manioc) starch flour unleavened pancakes. They are slightly thicker than crêpes and can be eaten plain or with sweet or savoury toppings. Tapioca flour must be moistened and strained through a sieve to become a coarse flour. The heat of an ungreased hot griddle or pan makes the starchy grains fuse into a flatbread which resembles a grainy pancake. Popular toppings include molten butter and dried, shredded coconut.

 () are generally made from cow&#x27;s milk and refined wheat flour, and generally eaten with savoury fillings as rolls (although dessert also exist). For those with celiac disease, corn starch might substitute for the wheat flour. Common fillings include shredded, seasoned chicken breast with tomato paste/sauce, and ground beef, seasoned with fried onion cubes or fried salted smashed garlic (), and often bell pepper cubes and tomato paste/sauce. Both kinds are generally topped with Parmesan cheese. Vegan recipes also exist, with texturized soy protein (, ) being particularly popular. Savoury is generally eaten for lunch or dinner, accompanied of white rice and salad, and less often pulses (prominently the beans Brazilian cuisine is famous for).

The exotic Brazilian pancake () is made from a mixture of coconut milk (, ) and (), a paste extracted from fermented cassava, most prominent in the cuisines of the Northern and Northeastern regions and relatively unknown elsewhere. The resulting product is significantly more watery, filling and strongly flavored than the unfermented , and care should be taken in rolling the pancakes if desired because it breaks very easily. Common toppings include molten butter and common sorts of savoury filling, but creative recipes might arise, such as fake lasagne.

==== Colombia and Venezuela ====
Cachapas are corn pancakes, popular in Venezuelan cuisine.

In Colombia a similar preparation to cachapas is &quot;arepa de choclo&quot; (sweetcorn arepa).

==== Argentina and Uruguay ====
In Argentina and Uruguay pancakes are called &quot;panqueques&quot; and are usually sweet preparations filled with dulce de leche or whipped cream and strawberries. In savory preparations, pancakes are used to make cannelloni.

==Restaurant chains==
In the US, Mexico and Canada, the franchised restaurant chain International House of Pancakes (IHOP) serves pancakes all day. The Original Pancake House is another chain of pancake restaurants across the US, and Walker Brothers is a series of pancake houses in the Chicago area that developed as a franchised spin-off of The Original Pancake House.

The popularity of pancakes in Australia has spawned the Pancake Parlour and Pancakes on the Rocks franchised restaurants. In British Columbia and Alberta, Canada, the restaurant chain De Dutch serves Dutch and Flemish-style pannenkoeken.

==Syndrome==
Pancake syndrome is an allergic reaction which some people have after eating pancakes in tropical regions where certain mites can contaminate the flour in pancakes.

==Day==
Pancakes are traditionally eaten on Shrove Tuesday, which is known as &quot;Pancake Day&quot; in Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, New Zealand, and Australia, and &quot;Pancake Tuesday&quot; in Ireland and Scotland. (Shrove Tuesday is better known in the United States, France, and other countries as Mardi Gras or Fat Tuesday.) Historically, pancakes were made on Shrove Tuesday so that the last of the fat or lard was used up before Lent. No meat products should be eaten during Lent.

Charity and school events are organized on Pancake Day: in a &quot;pancake race&quot; each participant carries a pancake in a frying pan. All runners must toss their pancakes as they run and catch them in the frying pan. This event is said to have originated in Olney, England in 1445 when a housewife was still busy frying pancakes to eat before the Lenten fast when she heard the bells of St Peter and St Paul&#x27;s Church calling her to the Shriving Service. Eager to get to church, she ran out of her house still holding the frying pan complete with pancake, tossing it to prevent it from burning, and still wearing her apron and headscarf. Every Shrove Tuesday since 1950, the towns of Olney and Liberal, Kansas have competed in the International Pancake Race. Only local women may compete; they race, and their times are compared to determine the international winner. In Olney the main women&#x27;s race is augmented by races for local schoolchildren and for men.

The Rehab UK Parliamentary Pancake Race takes place every Shrove Tuesday, with teams from the British lower house (the House of Commons), the upper house (the House of Lords), and the Fourth Estate, contending for the title of Parliamentary Pancake Race Champions. The fun relay race is to raise awareness of the work of the national brain injury charity, Rehab UK, and the needs of people with acquired brain injury.

<text>Taeniolabis (&quot;banded incisor&quot;)
is a genus of extinct multituberculate mammal from the Paleocene of North America.

==Description==
 
&quot;Taeniolabis&quot; is a member of the Taeniolabidoidea, a superfamily of multituberculates that are known for their highly derived teeth, and a short wide snout with a blocky head. The teeth modifications were likely an adaptation for herbivory that may have resulted from rapid diversification of angiosperms at the very end of the Cretaceous, which would thus have created opportunities for novel specialization in herbivores. &quot;T. taoensis&quot; possessed an elongate, gently curved cochlear canal and an enlarged vestibule. It is the largest known multituberculate, as well as the largest allotherian mammal, with &quot;T. taoensis&quot; weighing up to . Species under this genus have been known under other names.
&quot;Taeniolabis taoensis&quot; is found frequently enough and in a very limited time range that it can be used as an index fossil for the Puercan faunal stage within Danian aged fossil deposits.

==Taxonomy==
=== History ===
It is within the suborder of Cimolodonta and is a member of the superfamily Taeniolabidoidea. The genus was named by Edward Drinker Cope in 1882. Species have also been placed with the genera &quot;Catopsalis&quot; and &quot;Polymastodon&quot;. 

=== Species ===
* &quot;Taeniolabis lamberti&quot; was named by Nancy Simmons in 1987. It has been found in the Danian aged Tullock Formation of Montana. It is not quite as large as &quot;T. taoensis&quot;, but still a hefty size for a multituberculate, weighing around .
* &quot;Taeniolabis taoensis&quot; was originally named &quot;Taeniolabis sulcatus&quot; by Cope in 1882 as the type species of the genus. It was later renamed as &quot;T. taoensis&quot;. Known fossils date to approximately 64 million years of age. They are found in Danian aged deposits of the Nacimiento Formation of New Mexico, the Ravenscrag Formation of Saskatchewan and the Denver Formation of Colorado. This species likely had a roughly long skull and had an average body mass of , which is approximately the size of a modern beaver. The species was once considered to have had a body mass of up to 100 kg and sized like a sheep or larger by extrapolating body size on the basis of their huge teeth. However, improved analyses and the realization that the teeth were extraordinarily robust due to herbivory rather has generally disproved that.

<text>Ronald James &quot;Ronnie&quot; Kray (24 October 193320 March 1995) and Reginald &quot;Reggie&quot; Kray (24 October 19331 October 2000) were English gangsters or organised crime figures and identical twin brothers from Haggerston who were prominent from the late 1950s until their arrest in 1968. 

Their gang, known as the Firm, was based in Bethnal Green, where the Kray twins lived. They were involved in murder, armed robbery, arson, protection rackets, gambling and assaults. At their peak in the 1960s, they gained a certain measure of celebrity status by mixing with prominent members of London society, being photographed by David Bailey and interviewed on television.

The Krays were arrested on 8 May 1968 and convicted in 1969 as a result of the efforts of detectives led by Detective Superintendent Leonard &quot;Nipper&quot; Read. Each was sentenced to life imprisonment. Ronnie, upon being certified insane, was committed to Broadmoor Hospital in 1979 and remained there until his death on 17 March 1995 from a heart attack; Reggie was released from prison on compassionate grounds in August 2000, five weeks before he died of cancer.

== Early life ==
Ronald James and Reginald Kray were born on 24 October 1933 in Haggerston, East London, to Charles David Kray (1907–1983) and Violet Annie Lee (1909–1982). The Krays were thorough Eastenders – Charles from Shoreditch and Violet from Bethnal Green – and were apparently of mixed Irish, Austrian Jewish and Romanichal descent, although this has been disputed. The brothers were identical twins, with Reggie born 10 minutes before Ronnie. Their parents already had a six-year-old son, Charles James (1927–2000). A sister, Violet (born 1929), died in infancy. The twins contracted diphtheria when they were three years old.

The Kray household was dominated by their mother, who remained the brothers&#x27; most important influence during their childhood. Their father was a rag-and-bone man with a fondness for heavy drinking; his work led him to live a semi-nomadic lifestyle as he travelled all over southern England looking for junk to sell, and even when he was in London he frequented pubs more often than his home. The Kray twins first attended Wood Close School in Brick Lane and then Daniel Street School, Bethnal Green. In 1938 the family moved from Stean Street in Haggerston to 178 Vallance Road in Bethnal Green.

Mrs. Kray was regarded as a minor celebrity in Bethnal Green for giving birth to and raising a healthy pair of twins at a time when the child mortality rate was high among the British working class. In the interwar period, it was normal that one of the twins born into working-class families would die before adulthood, and it was most unusual that both the Kray twins survived, making their mother the object of much admiration in Bethnal Green, perhaps contributing to her perceived inflated ego. There was a feeling within Bethnal Green that there was an almost unnatural emotional closeness between the twins and their mother, who shunned the company of others.

Ronnie later stated about his childhood: &quot;We had our mother, and we had each other, so we never needed no one else&quot;. One of the Krays&#x27; cousins who attended school with them, Billy Wilshire, recalled: &quot;It&#x27;s hard to say exactly what it was, but they weren&#x27;t like other children&quot;. The Krays&#x27; biographer, John Pearson, argued that their mother planted the seeds of the malignant narcissism that the twins would display as adults by encouraging her sons to think of themselves as being extraordinary while spoiling their every whim.

During the Second World War, Mr. Kray deserted from the British Army, having been conscripted in September 1939. He spent the next 15 years living as a fugitive, being finally arrested in 1954. During this period, he was only irregularly involved in raising his family. Meanwhile, the twins were evacuated to East House in Hadleigh, Suffolk, with their mother and their older brother. The family remained in Hadleigh for about one year before moving back to London, as Mrs. Kray missed her friends and family. While they were in Hadleigh, the twins attended Bridge Street Boys&#x27; School.

In a 1989 interview, Ronnie described Hadleigh as the twins&#x27; first time in the countryside, recalling that both were attracted to the &quot;quietness, the peacefulness of it, the fresh air, nice scenery, nice countryside – different from London. We used to go to a big &#x27;ill called Constitution Hill and used to go sledging there in the winter-time.&quot;

The influence of their maternal grandfather, Jimmy &quot;Cannonball&quot; Lee, caused the brothers to take up amateur boxing, then a popular pastime for working-class boys in the East End. Sibling rivalry spurred them on, and each achieved some success. Ronnie was considered to be the more aggressive of the twins, constantly getting into street fights as a teenager. The British scholar Jonathan Raban wrote that he had a &quot;low IQ&quot; but that he was an avid reader who especially liked books about T. E. Lawrence, Orde Wingate, and Al Capone. Raban attributed much of Ronnie&#x27;s &quot;savage petulance&quot; as a teenager to his rage over having to hide his bisexual tendencies. As well as this the Kray brothers hung around in the Blind Beggar pub in Whitechapel in East London. 

=== Military service ===
The Kray twins were called up to do National Service in the British Army in March 1952. Although the pair reported to the depot of the Royal Fusiliers at the Tower of London, they attempted to leave after only a few minutes. When the corporal in charge tried to stop them, he was seriously injured by Ronnie when he punched him on the jaw. The Krays walked back to their East End home where they were arrested the next morning by police and turned over to the army.

In September, while absent without leave (AWOL) again, the twins assaulted a police constable who tried to arrest them. They became among the last prisoners to be held at the Tower of London before being transferred to Shepton Mallet military prison in Somerset for a month to await court-martial. After they were convicted, both were sent to the Buffs&#x27; Home Counties Brigade Depot jail in Canterbury, Kent.

However, when it became clear that they would both be dishonourably discharged from the army, the Krays&#x27; behaviour worsened. They dominated the exercise areas outside their one-man cells, threw tantrums, emptied a latrine bucket over a sergeant, dumped a canteen full of hot tea on another guard, handcuffed yet another guard to their prison bars with a pair of stolen cuffs, and set their bedding on fire. Eventually they were moved to a communal cell where they assaulted their guard with a vase and escaped. After being quickly recaptured, they spent their last night in military custody in Canterbury drinking cider, eating crisps and smoking cigarillos courtesy of the young national servicemen acting as their guards. The next day the Krays were transferred to a civilian prison to serve sentences for the crimes they committed while AWOL. Raban wrote that prison psychiatrists who examined Ronnie found him to be &quot;educationally subnormal, psychopathic, schizophrenic and insane&quot;.

Despite their brief and disastrous military career, upon release the Krays adopted an extremely militaristic style as Ronnie took to calling himself &quot;the Colonel&quot; while their home at 178 Vallance Road was dubbed &quot;Fort Vallance&quot;.

== Criminal careers ==
=== Nightclub owners ===
The Kray twins&#x27; criminal records and dishonourable discharges ended their boxing careers, and the brothers turned to crime full-time. They bought a run-down snooker club in Mile End where they started several protection rackets. By the end of the 1950s, the Krays were working for Jay Murray from Liverpool and were involved in truck hijacking, armed robbery, and arson, through which they acquired other clubs and properties. In 1960, Ronnie was imprisoned for 18 months for running a protection racket. While he was in prison, Peter Rachman, head of a landlord operation, sold Reggie a nightclub called Esmeralda&#x27;s Barn to ward off threats of further extortion. The location is where the Berkeley Hotel now stands.

Ownership of Esmeralda&#x27;s Barn increased the Krays&#x27; influence in the West End by making them celebrities as well as criminals. The twins adopted a norm according to which anyone who failed to show due respect would be severely punished. Both brothers notoriously laundered money through dog and horse tracks as well as through businesses, which led to several others being investigated during the mid-1960s for their co-operation with the crimes. The twins were assisted by a banker named Alan Cooper who wanted protection against the Krays&#x27; South London rivals, the Richardson Gang.

Raban called Ronnie the &quot;dimmer&quot; of the two twins, writing that he was &quot;a man whose grasp on reality was so slight and pathologically deranged that he was able to live out a crude, primarily coloured fiction, twisting the city into the shape of a bad thriller&quot;. Ronnie quite consciously modelled the style of &quot;the Firm&quot; after what he read about the Chicago underworld in Capone&#x27;s time, for example having his own personal barber visit his flat to work on his hair because he read somewhere that was the normal practice with Chicago gangsters in the 1920s.

=== Celebrity status ===
In the 1960s, the Kray twins were widely seen as prosperous and charming celebrity nightclub owners and were part of the Swinging London scene. A large part of their fame was due to their non-criminal activities as popular figures on the celebrity circuit, being photographed by David Bailey on more than one occasion and socialising with lords, MPs, socialites and show business characters, including Frank Sinatra, Peter Sellers, Joan Collins, Judy Garland, Diana Dors, George Raft, Sammy Davis Jr., Shirley Bassey, Liza Minnelli, Cliff Richard, Dusty Springfield, Jayne Mansfield, Richard Harris, Danny La Rue, and Barbara Windsor.

Part of the Krays&#x27; newfound celebrity status was due to the widespread perception that the twins were men who had risen out of poverty into positions of great wealth and power due to their own efforts. They were seen as an example, albeit a perverse one, of the &quot;meritocracy&quot; that was to replace the traditional class system. Furthermore, the 1960s was a time when many social norms were being questioned, and the Krays were widely seen as &quot;rebels&quot; against what were perceived as sanctimonious and hypocritical traditional British values. The scholars Chris Jenks and Justin Lorentzen wrote that there was &quot;a popular mistrust of the Establishment&quot; in the 1960s and that as many young people &quot;laughed Prime Minister Macmillan and President Johnson, their teachers and university lecturers and priests and moralists off the stage&quot;, the Krays were seen as folk heroes. This was a period of intense debates arising about consumerism, social mobility, sexuality, style, and social tolerance, and the Krays were involved in all of them as symbols, either bad or good, about the changes taking place in British society.

The Kray twins greatly valued their image and cultivated the media by inviting journalists to take photographs of them with other celebrities at nightclubs or in donating to charity. They went about in an obsessive way managing and promoting the image that they wanted, namely as benefactors who gave generously to charity and as men who had risen up from poverty to become rich and powerful. The sociologist Dick Hebdige wrote that the Krays had &quot;a sophisticated awareness of the importance of public relations matched only in the image-conscious field of American politics ... As we have seen, certain of the Krays&#x27; projects, when closely examined, take on a bizarre aspect more appropriate to the theatre than to the rational pursuit of profit by crime&quot;. In 1960, gambling in clubs was legalised in the United Kingdom, which for the first time allowed &#x27;decent&#x27; people to gamble openly outside of betting on horse racing. The Krays were the owners of four nightclubs where gambling was permitted, which not only allowed them to be seen as successful businessmen but also to socialise with &#x27;decent&#x27; people who would have previously shunned the company of gangsters running a &#x27;gambling den&#x27;.

The Krays made a point of promoting a &quot;gangster chic&quot; image as both dressed in a style that countless films had associated with gangsters, namely wearing &quot;discreet, dark, double-breasted suits with tight-knotted ties and shoulder-padded overcoats. Combined with garish jewellery such as large gold rings, gold bracelet watches, and diamond cuff links, the Krays conveyed a redoubtable image&quot;. The British scholar Ruth Penfold-Mounce described the twins as a classic example of the social bandit, criminals who became folk heroes because of the belief that they were standing up to a corrupt Establishment while also paradoxically being seen as upholding the better part of society&#x27;s values. The twins were viewed in certain quarters as &quot;Robin Hood&quot;-type criminals whose crimes were seen as acceptable. Penfold-Mounce noted they combined an air of menace and violence together with an image of &quot;a romanticised air of heroic gentlemanliness, generosity, and the apparent reinforcement of traditional social order parameters of conservatism and restraint&quot;. Within this context, the Krays made a point of stressing that there were limits to the values that they were willing to violate while promoting the image of themselves as the benefactors of society. For example, they made a great point of stressing the image of being respectful towards women as they knew that the British public did not like men who were disrespectful towards women. One former member of &quot;the Firm&quot;, Tony Lambrianou, stated that the positive image of the Krays was a &quot;myth&quot;, maintaining that the only people the brothers ever cared about were themselves.

Jenks and Lorentzen noted the image of the Krays had little to do with who the brothers actually were, as they described the twins as considerably more vicious and selfish than the popular &quot;folk hero&quot; image of them would allow. Admirers of the brothers stress their supposed &quot;Robin Hood&quot; characteristics, with the Krays alleged to have given away much of their ill-gotten wealth to the deserving poor of the East End; their respect for women; and as a force for order who engaged in only what were considered socially acceptable crimes such as theft while punishing those who engaged in what were considered socially unacceptable crimes such as rape. The East End at the time had its own informal rules, such as a deep distrust of the Metropolitan Police as exemplified by the popular saying &quot;thou shalt not grass&quot;, which led to police complaining of a &quot;wall of silence&quot;. Within the East End, where &quot;roguery&quot; was widely admired, Jenks and Lorentzen noted &quot;symbolic heroes are elected through excess. The most audacious thefts, the most sadistic violence and an almost philosophical quest for glory in infamy are topmost in people&#x27;s minds. An elision of style and brutality can emerge, as it did in the form of the Krays&quot;.

Conversely, the Krays were seen in other quarters as symbols of moral decay and evil, with the famous photographs of the brothers taken by David Bailey being viewed as &quot;the phrenological archetypes of proletarian villainy&quot;. Jenks and Lorentzen wrote the twins became symbols in the public mind of British organised crime itself as the brothers were associated with &quot;tales of excessive and gratuitous violence and to a time when London criminality appeared not only as organised as never before, but also integrated into the Establishment and the vanguard of popular culture&quot;. Jenks and Lorentzen further maintained that the Krays&#x27; close association with the East End, an area viewed as a centre of &quot;social disorganisation and moral decay&quot;, further contributed to the negative picture of the brothers.

At least some critics of the Krays made xenophobic arguments that the twins were not of English stock but were instead the products of a mixture of Ashkenazi Jewish and Romany descent. In this context, the Krays were presented as typical of the East End, which was viewed in certain quarters as an impoverished and lawless area that attracted many immigrants. There is no evidence of the Krays having any Jewish or Romany origins, a claim that seems to have been made only to associate the Krays with their supposed familial homelands in Eastern Europe and to distance them from English society. Finally, Jenks and Lorentzen argued that the rareness of identical twins made the brothers seem especially malevolent, giving them the &quot;freak show&quot; image as many found viewing two men who looked and sounded precisely the same to be disturbing and unnerving.

The closeness of the Krays made them seem sinister as Lambrianou recalled in 1995: &quot;You were never, ever on solid ground with them ... They played a little game of their own. There was an unspoken language; it was what they didn&#x27;t say as much as what they did say. There&#x27;s a myth that the Krays took care of their own, but I never saw it. The Krays &quot;were&quot; their own.&quot; Alongside this &quot;freak show&quot; image were suggestions of what was viewed at the time as perverted sexuality. At a time when homosexuality was widely considered abnormal – especially in the underworld of the East End – Ronnie made a point of flaunting his relationships with men, which was considered to be quite shocking during the period. Reggie was ostensibly heterosexual, but he had only one known relationship with a woman and was only briefly married; there were also rumours that he had boyfriends as a teenager. The Krays were not asexual, but the indeterminate nature of their sexuality contributed to their popular image of being in some vague way very perverse. The fact that the twins were successful gangsters while not subscribing to the standard heteronormative &quot;hard men&quot; or &quot;lovable rogue&quot; stereotypes associated with their criminal peers, while also rejecting the popular effeminate stereotype of gay men, led to a sense there was something unnatural about them. The &quot;sordid facts&quot; that were presented during the Krays&#x27; trial for murder led to their &quot;folk hero&quot; image being eclipsed by a &quot;folk villain&quot; image.

=== Lord Boothby and Tom Driberg ===
Tom Driberg, a Labour MP and gossip columnist for the &quot;Daily Express&quot;, was well acquainted with the Conservative peer Lord Boothby through dinner parties hosted by Lord Beaverbrook, the proprietor of the newspaper. Through his friend, the theatre director Joan Littlewood, Driberg had met Reginald Kray, who in turn introduced Boothby to Ronnie. Ronnie and Boothby entered into a homosexual relationship, in which the masochistic Boothby enjoyed being dominated by Ronnie, a sexual sadist. This aspect of Boothby&#x27;s life was unknown to the general public, who knew him as a celebrity peer who frequently represented the Conservative Party on talk shows. For the purposes of blackmail and the sense of power that came from associating with powerful men, Ronnie hosted parties for Boothby and other upper-class gay men where working class &quot;rent boys&quot; were made available for sex. 
In July 1964, an exposé in the &quot;Sunday Mirror&quot; insinuated that Ronnie had begun a homosexual relationship with Boothby, at a time when sex between men was still a criminal offence in the United Kingdom. Police had leaked to the &quot;Sunday Mirror&quot; several photographs featuring Ronnie and Boothby posing together, along with photographs of them with Boothby&#x27;s chauffeur Leslie Holt and Teddy Smith, a member of &quot;the Firm&quot; who was also the lover of Driberg. The photographs were not printed, but were alluded to in the headline &quot;The Pictures We Must Not Print&quot; along with the subtitle &quot;Peer and Gangster: Yard Inquiry&quot;. Although no names were printed in the piece, the Krays threatened the journalists involved and Boothby threatened to sue the newspaper with the help of Labour leader Harold Wilson&#x27;s solicitor, Arnold Goodman. In the face of this, the &quot;Sunday Mirror&quot; backed down, sacking its editor, printing an apology and paying Boothby £40,000 in an out-of-court settlement. Because of this, other newspapers were unwilling to expose the Krays&#x27; criminal activities. Decades later, Channel 4 established the truth of the allegations and released a documentary on the subject called &quot;The Gangster and the Pervert Peer&quot; (2009).

Boothby called the £40,000 (over £1 million in 2024 values) he was awarded from the &quot;Sunday Mirror&quot; &quot;tainted money&quot;, and though he professed to have donated the majority of the money to charity, it appears the Krays took the bulk of the award. One of Boothby&#x27;s first actions following the suit was to write a cheque for £5,000 to Ronnie. Ronnie had also launched a libel action of his own against &quot;Sunday Mirror&quot; columnist Cecil Harmsworth King for calling him a &quot;homosexual thug&quot; in one of his columns, but the judge dismissed the suit under the grounds that it was a &quot;fair comment&quot;. Ronnie was furious about the dismissal, raging to a group of journalists: &quot;Proves what I always said. One law for the fucking rich and another for the poor&quot;.

Police investigated the Krays on several occasions, but the twins&#x27; reputation for violence made witnesses afraid to testify. There was also a problem for both main political parties. The Conservatives were unwilling to press the police to end the Krays&#x27; power for fear that the Boothby connection would again be publicised, and Labour – having gained control of the House of Commons with an extremely thin majority and the prospect of a snap election in the very near future – did not want connections between Ronnie and Driberg to get into the public realm.

===Alliance with the American Mafia===
During the 1960s, the Kray twins formed an alliance with the Commission, the governing body of the American Mafia. The brothers were in contact with Meyer Lansky and Angelo Bruno, two New York &quot;mafiosi&quot; who were looking to invest in London&#x27;s nightclubs and casinos to engage in money laundering. Similar establishments in Havana had long served that purpose, but after the Cuban Revolution in 1959 led to their closure, the Mafia considered London as an alternative. The belief that the Krays were able to influence the British government by blackmailing political figures such as Boothby made them attractive as prospective partners. Both Lansky and Bruno were considered to be diplomatic figures by the standards of American organised crime, and were felt to be the most qualified to negotiate with the mercurial and irascible Krays.

The conduit between Lansky and the Krays was George Raft, a declining Hollywood actor whom the Krays idolised for his performance as the hitman Guino Rinaldo in the film &quot;Scarface&quot; (1932). With his career essentially over, Raft had moved to London in 1965 with the hope of finding roles in European films. Lansky had opened the Colony Sports Club in London and installed Raft as its nominal owner, partly to avoid the attention of British authorities and partly to gain the attention of gamblers. The club was marketed not so much at British gamblers but rather at older, wealthy American tourists. The Krays were hired to provide &quot;protection&quot; at the club, being paid £500 per week to provide thugs from &quot;the Firm&quot; to act as security. An attempted meeting between Ronnie, Lansky, and Bruno in New York was aborted when US immigration authorities denied him entry.

The following year, a Montreal branch of the Royal Bank of Canada was robbed of C$50,000 in bearer bonds. Similar robberies in Montreal resulted in a haul totaling C$1 million. The Montreal-based Cotroni crime family, the Canadian satellite of New York&#x27;s Bonanno crime family, decided to sell the stolen bonds in Britain through the Krays. The twins sent over a corrupt businessman, Leslie &quot;the Brain&quot; Payne, to pick up the bonds for transport. Payne was able to cash the stolen bonds at a London brokerage house, netting a handsome profit for &quot;the Firm&quot;. The success of the deal made the Krays the preferred British partners of the American Mafia, who used the twins a number of times afterwards in similar arrangements.

The business of redeeming the stolen bonds in London ultimately led to a break between Payne and the Krays. Payne charged that since he was the one taking all the risks to smuggle and redeem the bonds, he was entitled to a larger share of the profits. The Krays refused Payne&#x27;s demand, which caused him to leave &quot;the Firm&quot;. Payne did not contact the authorities, but the mere possibility that he might one day become a prosecution witness led the Krays to plot his murder. Payne, who fought in the Battle of Monte Cassino in 1944, ridiculed their threats of violence, which only made the twins angrier. Lacking the necessary connections with the City to keep redeeming the stolen bonds on their own, the Krays turned to Alan Bruce Cooper, a disreputable American businessman living in London.

=== George Cornell ===

Ronnie shot and killed George Cornell, a member of the Richardson Gang, at the Blind Beggar pub in Whitechapel on 9 March 1966. The day before, there had been a shoot-out at Mr. Smith&#x27;s, a nightclub in Catford, involving the Richardsons and Richard Hart, an associate of &quot;the Firm&quot; who was shot dead. The shooting led to the arrest of nearly all the Richardson Gang. Cornell, by chance, was not present at Mr. Smith&#x27;s and was not arrested.

Ronnie was drinking in another pub when he learned of Cornell&#x27;s whereabouts. He went to the Blind Beggar with his driver, &quot;Scotch Jack&quot; John Dickson, and his assistant, Ian Barrie. Ronnie entered the pub with Barrie, walked straight to Cornell and shot him in the head in public view. Barrie, confused by what happened, fired five shots in the air warning onlookers not to report what had happened to police. Cornell died at 3:30a.m. in hospital.

According to some sources, Ronnie killed Cornell because he referred to him as a &quot;fat poof&quot; (a derogatory term for a gay man) during a confrontation between the Krays and the Richardsons at the Astor Club on Christmas Day 1965. Richardson member Frankie Fraser was tried for the murder of Hart at Mr. Smith&#x27;s, but was acquitted. Richardson member Ray &quot;the Belgian&quot; Cullinane testified that he saw Cornell kicking Hart. Witnesses would not co-operate with the police due to intimidation, and the trial ended inconclusively without pointing to any suspect in particular. In his 1988 memoir, Ronnie wrote: &quot;I felt fucking marvellous. I have never felt so good, so bloody alive, before or since. Twenty years on and I can recall every second of the killing of George Cornell. I have replayed it in my mind millions of times&quot;.

The Krays&#x27; Mafia associates were unhappy about the Cornell murder, feeling that it was reckless on the part of Ronnie to shoot someone in public instead of assigning the task to a junior associate. With the help of Raft, Reggie was able to maintain the alliance, arguing &quot;the Firm&quot; was still the best business partners the Mafia could turn to in London. Raft and Reggie used the fact that none of the witnesses at the Blind Beggar were willing to testify against Ronnie as evidence of the degree of fear that the Krays inspired. Shortly afterwards, Raft was prevented from returning to the UK when a Home Office order listed him as an &quot;undesirable&quot;, thereby costing the Krays their strongest ally within the Mafia.

=== Frank Mitchell ===
On 12 December 1966, the Krays helped Frank Mitchell, &quot;the Mad Axeman&quot;, to escape from Dartmoor Prison. Ronnie had befriended Mitchell while they served time together in Wandsworth Prison. Mitchell felt that the authorities should review his case for parole, so Ronnie thought that he would be doing him a favour by getting him out of Dartmoor, highlighting his case in the media and forcing the authorities to act. Once Mitchell had escaped, the Krays held him at a friend&#x27;s flat in Barking Road, East Ham. He was a large man with a mental disorder, and he was difficult to control. He disappeared, but the Krays were acquitted of his murder. Freddie Foreman, a friend of the Krays, claimed in his autobiography &quot;Respect&quot; that he shot Mitchell dead as a favour to the twins and disposed of his body at sea.

=== Jack &quot;the Hat&quot; McVitie ===
In October 1967, four months after the suicide of his wife Frances, Reggie was allegedly encouraged by his brother to kill Jack &quot;the Hat&quot; McVitie, a minor member of the Kray gang who had failed to fulfill a £1,000 contract, £500 of which had been paid to him in advance, to kill their former financial adviser, Leslie Payne. McVitie was lured to a basement flat in Evering Road, Stoke Newington, on the pretence of a party. Upon entering the premises, he saw Ronnie seated in the front room. Ronnie approached, letting loose a barrage of verbal abuse and cutting McVitie below his eye with a piece of broken glass. It is believed that an argument then broke out between the twins and McVitie. As the argument got more heated, Reggie pointed a handgun at McVitie&#x27;s head and pulled the trigger twice, but the gun failed to discharge.

McVitie was then held in a bear hug by the twins&#x27; cousin, Ronnie Hart, and Reggie was handed a carving knife. He then stabbed McVitie in the face and stomach, driving the blade into his neck while twisting the knife, not stopping even as McVitie lay on the floor dying. Reggie had committed a very public murder, against someone who many members of the Firm felt did not deserve to die. In an interview in 2000, shortly after Reggie&#x27;s death, Freddie Foreman revealed that McVitie had a reputation for leaving carnage behind him due to his habitual consumption of drugs and heavy drinking, and his having threatened to harm the twins and their family.

Tony and Chris Lambrianou and Ronnie Bender helped clear up the evidence of this crime, and attempted to assist in the disposal of the body. With McVitie&#x27;s corpse being too big to fit in the boot of the car, it was wrapped in an eiderdown and put in the back seat. Tony Lambrianou drove the car with the body and Chris Lambrianou and Bender followed behind. Crossing the Blackwall tunnel, Chris lost Tony&#x27;s car and spent up to 15 minutes looking around Rotherhithe area. They found Tony, outside St Mary&#x27;s Church, where he had run out of fuel, McVitie&#x27;s body still inside the car. The body was left in the car and the three gangsters returned home. Bender then went on to phone Charlie Kray informing them that it had been dealt with. When the Krays heard where they had left McVitie&#x27;s corpse, the twins were livid and desperately phoned Foreman, who was then running a pub in Southwark, to see if he could dispose of the body. With dawn breaking, Foreman found the car, broke into it and drove the body to Newhaven where, with the help of a trawlerman, the body was bound with chicken wire and dumped in the English Channel. This event started turning many people against the Krays, and some were prepared to testify to Scotland Yard as to what had happened, fearing that what happened to McVitie could easily happen to them.

=== Arrest, prosecution and imprisonment ===

Detective Chief Superintendent Leonard &quot;Nipper&quot; Read of Scotland Yard was promoted to the Murder Squad and his first assignment was to bring down the Kray twins. During the first half of 1964, Read had been investigating their activities but publicity and official denials of Ron&#x27;s relationship with Boothby made the evidence that he collected useless. Read went after the twins again in 1967 but frequently came up against the East End &quot;wall of silence&quot; which discouraged anyone from providing information to the police. They were represented in court by Nemone Lethbridge.

By the end of 1967 Read had built up enough evidence against the Krays. Early in 1968, the Krays employed Alan Bruce Cooper who sent Paul Elvey to Glasgow to buy explosives for a car bomb. Elvey was a radio engineer who put the pirate radio station Radio Sutch on the air in 1964, later renamed Radio City. After police detained him in Scotland, he confessed to being involved in three murder attempts. The evidence was weakened by Cooper, who claimed that he was an agent for the US Treasury Department investigating links between the American Mafia and the Kray gang. The attempted murders were his attempt to put the blame on the Krays.

Eventually Scotland Yard decided to arrest the Krays on the evidence already collected, in the hope that other witnesses would be forthcoming once the Krays were in custody. On 8 May 1968 the Krays and 15 members of the Firm were arrested. Exceptional measures were used to stop collusion between the accused. Nipper Read then secretly interviewed each of the arrested and offered each member of the Firm a deal if they testified against the others. Reggie Kray&#x27;s right-hand man, Albert Donoghue, told the twins directly that he was not prepared to be cajoled into pleading guilty, to the anger of the twins. He then informed Read via his mother that he was ready to cooperate.

Ronnie Hart had initially not been arrested, and was not a name initially sought after by the police. With Donoghue&#x27;s testimony, Hart was arrested. Offered the same terms as the others, Hart then told Read everything that had happened during McVitie&#x27;s murder, although he did not know anything about what happened to the body. Although Read knew for certain that Ronnie Kray had murdered George Cornell in the Blind Beggar pub, no one had been prepared to testify against the twins out of fear. Upon finding out the twins intended to cajole him, &#x27;Scotch Jack&#x27; Dickson also turned in everything he knew about Cornell&#x27;s murder. Although not a witness to the murder he was an accessory, having driven Ronnie Kray and Ian Barrie to the pub. The police still needed a witness to the murder. Frank Mitchell&#x27;s escape and disappearance were much harder to obtain evidence for, since the majority of those arrested were not involved with his planned escape and disappearance.

The twins&#x27; defence under their counsel John Platts-Mills consisted of flat denials of all charges and discrediting witnesses by pointing out their criminal past. Justice Melford Stevenson said: &quot;In my view, society has earned a rest from your activities&quot;. The trial, which lasted from January to March 1969, was a media sensation. Such was the demand to attend the trial that a black market emerged for seats, with the price being £5 a day for a seat in the public gallery section of the courthouse. It was the longest murder hearing in the history of British criminal justice, during which Stevenson stated of the sentences: &quot;I recommend [they] should not be less than thirty years&quot;. In March 1969, both were sentenced to life imprisonment (death having been abolished four years earlier as the mandatory sentence for murder), with a non-parole period of 30 years for the murders of Cornell and McVitie. Their brother Charlie was imprisoned for ten years for his part in the murders.

=== Later years ===
Ronnie and Reggie Kray were allowed, under a large police guard, to attend the funeral service of their mother Violet on 11 August 1982, following her death from cancer a week earlier. They were not allowed to attend her burial in the Kray family plot at Chingford Mount Cemetery. The funeral was attended by celebrities including Diana Dors and underworld figures known to the Krays. To avoid the publicity that had surrounded their mother&#x27;s funeral, the twins did not ask for permission to attend their father&#x27;s funeral in March 1983.

Ronnie Kray was a Category A prisoner, denied almost all liberties and not allowed to mix with other prisoners. He was eventually certified insane, his paranoid schizophrenia being tempered with constant medication; in 1979 he was committed and lived the remainder of his life in Broadmoor Hospital in Crowthorne, Berkshire. Reggie Kray was locked up in Maidstone Prison for eight years (Category B). In 1997, he was transferred to Wayland Prison, a Category C prison, in Norfolk.

In 1985 officials at Broadmoor Hospital discovered a business card of Ronnie&#x27;s that led to evidence that the twins, from separate institutions, were operating Krayleigh Enterprises (a &quot;lucrative bodyguard and &#x27;protection&#x27; business for Hollywood stars&quot;) together with their older brother Charlie Kray and an accomplice at large. Among their clients was Frank Sinatra, who hired 18 bodyguards from Krayleigh Enterprises on his visit to the 1985 Wimbledon Championships. Documents released under freedom of information laws revealed that although officials were concerned about this operation, they believed that there was no legal basis to shut it down.

== Personal lives ==

=== Ronnie ===
In his autobiography &quot;My Story&quot; (1993) and a comment to writer Robin McGibbon on &quot;The Kray Tapes&quot;, Ronnie stated: &quot;I&#x27;m bisexual, not gay. Bisexual.&quot; In the 1960s, he also planned to marry a woman named Monica whom he had dated for nearly three years. He called her &quot;the most beautiful woman he had ever seen.&quot; This is mentioned in Reggie&#x27;s book &quot;Born Fighter&quot;. Also, extracts are mentioned in Ronnie&#x27;s own book, &quot;My Story&quot;; and in Kate Kray&#x27;s books, &quot;Sorted&quot;; &quot;Murder, Madness and Marriage&quot;; and &quot;Free at Last&quot;.

Ronnie was arrested before he had the chance to marry Monica, and although she married his ex-boyfriend, 59 letters sent to her between May and December 1968 when he was imprisoned show Ronnie still had feelings for her, and his love for her was very clear. He referred to her as &quot;my little angel&quot; and &quot;my little doll&quot;. She also still had feelings for Ronnie. These letters were auctioned in 2010.

A letter Ronnie sent to his mother Violet from prison in 1968 also refers to Monica: &quot;if they let me see Monica and put me with Reg, I could not ask for more.&quot; He went on to say, &quot;Monica is the only girl I have liked in my life. She is a lovely little person as you know. When you see her, tell her I am in love with her more than ever.&quot; Ronnie subsequently married twice, marrying Elaine Mildener in 1985 at Broadmoor chapel (with Joey Pyle as best man) before the couple divorced in 1989, following which he married Kate Howard, whom he divorced in 1994. Kate Howard lived for a number of years in Headcorn Kent, in Forge Lane.

In an interview with author John Pearson, Ronnie indicated he identified with the 19th-century soldier Charles George Gordon: &quot;Gordon was like me, homosexual, and he met his death like a man. When it&#x27;s time for me to go, I hope I do the same.&quot;

In his biography of the twins, &quot;The Profession of Violence&quot;, Pearson claims that Ronnie Kray admitted that he and Reggie discovered they were both gay in their adolescence and would often have sex together, an activity which continued into their later life.

=== Reggie ===
Reggie married Frances Shea in 1965. It was thought she took her own life in 1967, but only two days after her death Ronnie confessed to Reggie that he had murdered her. Reggie only told this to a few people, one of whom was a fellow inmate, Bradley Allardyce. In 1997 Reggie married Roberta Jones, whom he met while still in prison. She was helping to publicise a film she was making about Ronnie, who had died in the hospital two years earlier.

== Controversies ==
There was a long-running campaign, with some minor celebrity support, to have the twins released from prison, but successive Home Secretaries vetoed the idea, largely on the grounds that both Krays&#x27; prison records were marred by violence toward other inmates. The campaign gathered momentum after the release of a film based on their lives called &quot;The Krays&quot; (1990). Produced by Ray Burdis, it starred Spandau Ballet brothers Martin and Gary Kemp, who played the roles of Reggie and Ronnie respectively. Ronnie, Reggie and Charlie Kray received £255,000 for the film.

Reggie wrote: &quot;I seem to have walked a double path most of my life. Perhaps an extra step in one of those directions might have seen me celebrated rather than notorious.&quot; Others point to Reggie&#x27;s violent prison record when he was being detained separately from Ronnie and argue that in reality, the twins&#x27; temperaments were little different.

Reggie&#x27;s marriage to Frances Shea (1943–1967) in 1965 lasted eight months when she left, although the marriage was never formally dissolved. An inquest came to the conclusion that she had committed suicide, but in 2002 an ex-lover of Reggie Kray&#x27;s came forward to allege that Frances was murdered by a jealous Ronnie. Bradley Allardyce spent three years in Maidstone Prison with Reggie and explained, &quot;I was sitting in my cell with Reg and it was one of those nights where we turned the lights down low and put some nice music on and sometimes he would reminisce. He would get really deep and open up to me. He suddenly broke down and said &#x27;I&#x27;m going to tell you something I&#x27;ve only ever told two people and something I&#x27;ve carried around with me&#x27; – something that had been a black hole since the day he found out. He put his head on my shoulder and told me Ronnie killed Frances. He told Reggie what he had done two days after.&quot;

A television documentary, &quot;The Gangster and the Pervert Peer&quot; (2009), claimed that Ronnie Kray was a rapist of men. The programme also detailed his relationship with Conservative peer Bob Boothby as well as a &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; investigation into Lord Boothby&#x27;s dealings with the Kray brothers.

==The Kray legend==
Jenks and Lorentzen argued that the Krays have entered the realm of a popular myth. The definition of &#x27;myth&#x27; used by Jenks and Lorentzen is that formulated by Peter Burke in a 1989 essay &quot;History as a Social Memory&quot;, where he defined a &#x27;myth&#x27; as follows: &quot;I am incidentally, using that slippery term &#x27;myth&#x27; not in the positivist sense of &#x27;inaccurate history&#x27;, but in the richer, more positive sense of a story with symbolic meanings, made up of stereotyped incidents and involving characters who are larger than life, whether they are heroes or villains&quot;. Jenks and Lorentzen argued the Krays have become the embodiment of &quot;a particular version of East End history&quot; and as a symbol of a &quot;dark criminal past&quot; associated with the East End.

The relative rarity of identical twins made the Krays stand out as there were numerous other gangster brother teams in the East End in the 1950s–1960s such as the Richardson brothers, the Nash brothers, the Dixon brothers, the Wood brothers, the Malone brothers, the Webb brothers and the Lambrianou brothers, but only the Krays live on in popular memory with the rest forgotten. The fame/infamy of the Krays is such that as Jenks and Lorentzen noted that even today a &quot;vast number&quot; of East Enders &quot;continue to claim an association with the Twins or their family (often despite impossible biographical or temporal discrepancies)&quot;. Jenks and Lorentzen argued the Krays have become a &#x27;myth&#x27; because in the popular memory the Krays have &quot;became a distillation of the violence, the horror, and the misery that the cultural compass of the East End has meant to the conventional moral order&quot;.

The American scholar Homer Pettey noted that there have been more films made about the Krays than other British gangsters. Pettey argued that popularity of the Krays as cinematic subjects reflected the image of the twins as the embodiment of the &quot;dark sides of British national identity&quot;, as symbols of a streak of national perversity, ferocity and cruelty that stands in marked contrast to the normal positive images of the national identity of Britain presented in films. Pettey wrote &quot;To extrapolate from their careers elements of British national identity, however, is not so far-fetched as it might seem. The Kray twins not only cultivated these popular cultural icons of their era, but they also wanted to become media icons ... These sadistic twins initiated and accepted media practices that re-presented, re-mythologized and re-contextualized their lives&quot;. However, the fact that the Krays&#x27; criminal career came to an end with their convictions in 1969 allows their story, however unsavory and unpleasant it might be, to be presented on a reassuring note as the forces of law and order finally did triumph.

Part of the appeal of the legend of the Krays is that their story ended with the &quot;dark side&quot; of life that they represented being vanquished. Pettey wrote: &quot;In general, twins&#x27; lives fascinate because of their rarity in culture; their singularity forms the stuff of foundational myths, and lends itself to speculations about repetition, dualities and paradoxes. For Ron and Reggie Kray, local East End and London media lore hinted at two personalities, the gangster and the gentleman, the schizophrenic sadist and the clear-headed businessman, and the promiscuous homosexual and the monogamous married man.&quot;

== Deaths ==
Ronnie suffered a heart attack at Broadmoor Hospital on 15 March 1995, and died two days later at the age of 61 at Wexham Park Hospital in Slough, Berkshire. Reggie was allowed out of prison in handcuffs to attend the funeral.

Charlie Kray, Ronnie and Reggie&#x27;s older brother, was released from prison in 1975, after serving seven years of his 10-year sentence for his role in their gangland crimes. Charlie was sentenced to 12 years&#x27; imprisonment in 1997 for conspiracy to smuggle cocaine in an undercover drug sting. He died in prison of natural causes on 4 April 2000, aged 72, with Reggie allowed out of prison to attend his older brother&#x27;s funeral.

During his incarceration, Reggie Kray became a born-again Christian. He was diagnosed with terminal bladder cancer in 2000. He was released from Wayland Prison on 26 August 2000 on compassionate grounds, at the direction of Home Secretary Jack Straw. Reggie died from terminal cancer aged 66 on 1 October 2000. The final weeks of his life were spent with his wife of three years, Roberta, in a suite at the Townhouse Hotel at Norwich, after he left the Norfolk and Norwich Hospital on 22 September 2000. Ten days after his death he was buried beside his brother Ronnie in Chingford Mount Cemetery. During the funeral, crowds of thousands lined up to applaud.

===Theatre===

Two plays were produced in the 1970s that were based on thinly-veiled versions of the Krays:
* &quot;Alpha Alpha&quot;, by Howard Barker in 1972
* &quot;England England&quot;, a musical by Snoo Wilson with music by Kevin Coyne and directed by Dusty Hughes in 1977, starring Bob Hoskins and Brian Hall in the lead roles.
===Music===
* The song &quot;Last of the Famous International Playboys&quot; (1989) by English musician Morrissey was inspired by what he saw as media glamourization of the Krays, and refers to both brothers by name in the lyrics. Reggie Kray mentioned the song in his autobiography, stating: &quot;I liked the tune, but the lyrics in their entirety were lacking a little.&quot; Morrissey responded: &quot;I can&#x27;t get away from critics.&quot;

<text>A SIM lock, simlock, network lock, carrier lock or (master) subsidy lock is a technical restriction built into GSM and CDMA mobile phones by mobile phone manufacturers for use by service providers to restrict the use of these phones to specific countries and/or networks. This is in contrast to a phone (retrospectively called SIM-free or unlocked) that does not impose any SIM restrictions.

Generally phones can be locked to accept only SIM cards with certain International Mobile Subscriber Identities (IMSIs); IMSIs may be restricted by:

* Mobile country code (MCC; e.g., will only work with SIM issued in one country)
* Mobile network code (MNC; e.g., AT&amp;T Mobility, T-Mobile, Vodafone, Bell Mobility etc.)
* Mobile subscriber identification number (MSIN; i.e., only one SIM can be used with the phone)

Additionally, some phones, especially Nokia phones, are locked by group IDs (GIDs), restricting them to a single Mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) of a certain operator.

Most mobile phones can be unlocked to work with any GSM network provider, but the phone may still display the original branding and may not support features of the new carrier. Besides the locking, phones may also have firmware installed on them which is specific to the network provider. For example, a Vodafone or Telstra branded phone in Australia will display the relevant logo and may only support features provided by that network (e.g. Vodafone Live!). This firmware is installed by the service provider and is separate from the locking mechanism. Most phones can be &quot;unbranded&quot; by reflashing a different firmware version, a procedure recommended for advanced users only. The reason many network providers SIM lock their phones is that they offer phones at a discount to customers in exchange for a contract to pay for the use of the network for a specified time period, usually between one and three years. This business model allows the company to recoup the cost of the phone over the life of the contract. Such discounts are worth up to several hundred US dollars. If the phones were not locked, users might sign a contract with one company, get the discounted phone, then stop paying the monthly bill (thus breaking the contract) and start using the phone on another network or even sell the phone for a profit. SIM locking curbs this by prohibiting change of network (using a new SIM). 
In some countries, SIM locking is very common if subsidized phones are sold with prepaid contracts. It is important to note, however, that the technology associated with the phone must be compatible with the technology being used by the network carrier. A GSM cell phone will only work with a GSM carrier and will not work on a CDMA network provider. Likewise, a CDMA cell phone will only work with a CDMA carrier and will not work on a GSM network provider. Note that newer (2013+) high end mobile phones are capable of supporting both CDMA and GSM technologies, allowing customers to use their mobile devices on any network. Examples of these mobile devices are the Apple iPhone 5c, 6 and newer, Motorola&#x27;s G4, G5, X Pure, Samsung&#x27;s Galaxy S6, S7, S8 smart phones, mostly phones based on a Qualcomm Snapdragon chipset or radio.

In some jurisdictions, such as Canada, Chile, China, Israel, Singapore, and the United States it is illegal for providers to sell SIM locked devices. In other countries, carriers may not be required to unlock devices or may require the consumer to pay a fee for unlocking.

Unlocking the phone, however, is almost universally legal. Additionally, it is often legal for carriers to force SIM locks for certain amounts of time, varying by region.

== Unlocking technology ==
A handset can be unlocked by entering a code provided by the network operator. Alternative mechanisms include software running on the handset or a computer attached to the handset, hardware devices that connect to the handset or over-the-air by the carrier. Usually the unlock process is permanent. The code required to remove all locks from a phone is referred to as the &quot;master code&quot;, &quot;network code key&quot;, or &quot;multilock code&quot;. 
If the phone is network locked it will typically display one of the following messages: SIM network PIN blocked, Enter lock PIN.

There can also be multiple levels of locks placed on the phone by networks, which block the use of other networks&#x27; SIM cards. These are usually referred to as &quot;Network Control Key&quot; (NCK) and &quot;Service Provider Control Key&quot; (SPCK), additionally, a Regional lock exists which is specific to Europe and it is called &quot;Region Control Key&quot; (RGCK).

Typically, a locked handset will display a message if a restricted SIM is used, requesting the unlock code. On recent phone models running Android software, the phone will display a message saying &quot;SIM network unlock PIN&quot; or &quot;Enter Network Lock Control Key&quot; if network locked. Windows phones will display the message, &quot;This SIM card can only be used on specific networks. Contact your customer service center for the unlock code&quot;. Other handsets may display different messages such as &quot;Enter special code&quot; or &quot;Enter unlocking code,&quot; or in some cases the handset will simply display a message stating that it is locked. Once a valid code is entered, the handset will display &quot;Network unlocked&quot; or &quot;Network unlock successful&quot;.

The unlock code is verified by the handset and is generated by the manufacturer, typically by an algorithm such as a one way hash or trapdoor function. Sometimes big telecom providers change the original factory unlock codes as an extra layer of security against unlocking services. For various big brands such as Samsung and Motorola there is no algorithm but just a random code generator where the unlock codes are programmed in the phone itself and then saved in a big database managed by the manufacturer. For the other brands where the unlock codes are still based on algorithms those are based on the IMEI number and the MCC code and have been reverse-engineered, stolen or leaked. Some handsets can be unlocked using software that generates an unlock code from an IMEI number and country and operator details using the algorithm specific to the handset. Other manufacturers have taken a more cautious approach, and embed a random number in the handset&#x27;s firmware that is retained by the manufacturer and the network on whose behalf the lock was applied. These handsets can still be unlocked by online services that have access to either inside people with the manufacturer or with the telecom networks, or they need to be connected to the computer with a cable where specific software will bypass the security and SIM-unlock the phone. Sometimes this is done by advanced calculations to bypass the security the official way and other times using exploits or overwriting parts of the firmware where the lock status is kept, and often even recover a phone that is bricked or completely damaged in the software sense.

Most handsets have security measures built into their firmware that protects them from repeated attempts to guess the unlock code. After entering more than a certain number of incorrect codes the phone becomes &quot;frozen&quot;. This is a state where the phone will display a security message that the phone needs a service. Older phones could no longer be used at all at this point, however modern smartphones often keep working with the original SIM but require extra work to then unlock them correctly. In extreme situations physical access to internal hardware via in-circuit debugging may be utilised (for example, via JTAG headers on a circuit board). Such access may be required to modify initialization software used for booting.

=== Hardlocked phones ===
A hardlocked phone is one in which a telecom provider has modified the firmware on the phone to make it impossible to manually enter the unlock codes in any way. The only solution to SIM-unlock such a phone is to change the firmware to a firmware which has not been modified by any telecom provider, a so-called &quot;unbranded firmware&quot;.

=== Economics ===
Handset manufacturers have economic incentives both to strengthen SIM lock security (which placates network providers and enables exclusivity deals) and to weaken it (broadening a handset&#x27;s appeal to customers who are not interested in the service provider that offers it). Also, making it too difficult to unlock a handset might make it less appealing to network service providers who have a legal obligation to provide unlock codes for certain handsets or in certain countries.

In some cases, a SIM-locked handset is sold at a substantially lower price than an unlocked one, because the service provider expects income through its service. SIM locks are employed on cheaper (pay-as-you-go) handsets, while discounts on more expensive handsets require a subscription that provides guaranteed income. Unlocked handsets have a higher market value, even more so if they are debranded. Debranding involves reflashing or replacing the firmware to remove the operator logo or any limitations or customizations that have been imposed on the handset by the operator, and is usually accomplished with software designed for a particular handset model, however, most smart-phones can be debranded and unlocked solely with the use of special software.

The main reason to unlock a handset is to be able to use it with a different SIM card. Consumers may wish to continue using their previous provider with a new handset or when traveling abroad they may wish to connect to a foreign network with a prepaid subscription.

Nevertheless, the fundamental principle of GSM and its successors, is open interfaces which encourage competition among multiple vendors. This is the reason a mobile phone is, in fact, a combination of a phone and the subscriber identity module (SIM). Locking the phone to a network is not much different from having the SIM built into the mobile phone. Network operators in many industrialized countries are not bound by law to give the phone unlocking code to subscribers even after the expiry of the contract period.

=== Box breaking ===
A practice known as &quot;box breaking&quot; is common in the United Kingdom and other markets. This involves purchasing subsidized handsets (usually pay-as-you-go) from retail stores, unlocking the phones, and then selling them (often abroad) for a higher price than the subsidised retail price. The SIM card that came with the handset is then either thrown away, sold, or used elsewhere. This practice is legal in the UK and provides a de facto limit to the extent to which networks are willing to subsidize pay-as-you-go handsets. While the act of &quot;box breaking&quot; is legal, some businesses are also engaging in illegal activities such as exporting the box-broken phones to other countries, to sell as grey market goods without paying import duties (known as carousel fraud) or substituting counterfeit batteries and chargers.

=== Unlocking services ===
Some companies offer an online unlocking service. This service requires that individuals who wish to unlock a handset provide their IMEI number and sometimes also country and operator details to the company, either via email or a website. The company will then provide the unlock code for the handset. For some brands such as Nokia and Samsung various services also offer special remote-unlocking software with instructions, where a cable is needed to remove the SIM lock at home. Such companies may email the unlocking code or software which will remotely unlock the device. Some companies also offer unlocking services that require sending the handset&#x27;s IMEI number. Other companies sell unlocking hardware, including devices which fit between the SIM card and the phone to spoof the original network identifier during registration and devices to read and edit the handset&#x27;s firmware. The pricing for unlocking a device will vary depending on the network it is locked to and the handset model itself, as each unlock code is unique to each individual handset.

==== Unlock code generators ====
There are online services that will provide an IMEI unlocking service for DCT4 and DCT3 Nokia mobile phones. This method of unlock requires the user to know which carrier the mobile phone is locked to, and also needs to provide an IMEI. Generally, older model Nokia unlock codes are free and instantly retrievable by these services. The unlock codes retrieved must be entered into the mobile phone using the keypad.

For DCT4 and DCT3 Nokia, unlock codes consist of a &quot;#&quot; key, followed by &quot;pw+&quot;, 10 (DCT3) or 15 (DCT4) digits, &quot;+&quot;, and another number ranging from 1-7, and finally ends with a &quot;#&quot;. Depending on the carrier which the phone is locked to, only some codes will work with the mobile phone. Most phones respond to the unlock codes ending in +1# or +7#, however some phones are configured to allow only one of the seven codes to work. The following is an example of a DCT4/DCT3 unlock code:
DCT4 and DCT3 Nokia will only allow a maximum of five unlock attempts using the unlock code method. After five incorrect codes have been inputted, the phone will not allow the user to try any more codes (even if it is correct) and will require the owner to try other unlock methods.

== Laws and practices ==

Many countries listed below have some form of SIM-locking laws specifying the period of SIM locking and the cost of obtaining unlocking codes.

===Andorra===
In Andorra, the state-owned communications mobile company Mobiland does not sell SIM-locked phones. As there is no competition, consumers usually buy standard mobile phones that are not locked to any specific carrier.

===Austria===
In Austria, unlocking is allowed at any time by the owner of the device. A lawsuit was decided in favor of a mobile operator who encouraged the unlocking of phones by providing links to free/cheap unlocking services.

T-Mobile Austria charges 150 euros to unlock the iPhone for prepaid subscribers and in contract subscribers. For subscribers who have finished their 2-year iPhone contract, T-Mobile Austria charges 50 euros to unlock the iPhone.

=== Australia ===
In Australia, carriers can choose whether to SIM/Network Lock handsets or not, however in practice, is rarely performed except in limited cases. Almost all handsets available on the Australian market have no such restriction.

One law professor, Dale Clapperton, gave a talk stating that bundling iPhone and mobile phone service could be violating the Trade Practices Act. However, no other legal professional or academic has come out in support of this viewpoint. This also doesn&#x27;t address SIM locking &quot;per se&quot;, only as applied to subsidised iPhone purchases, and persistence of the lock beyond the contractual period.

=== Belgium ===
Until 2007, Belgium had laws prohibiting bundling, but they were challenged as violating European Directive 2005/29/EC The Unfair Commercial Practices Directive. On April 23, 2009, the European Court of Justice ruled against Belgium and struck down Belgium&#x27;s anti-bundling law. The Belgian government was given until May 2009 to change the law, failing which the European Commission would commence proceedings against Belgium. This leaves Canada, China, Singapore, and Israel as the only countries in the world that forbid SIM locking and contract/phone bundling outright. Chile initiated a ban as of January 1, 2012.

=== Brazil ===
In Brazil, SIM locks are not prohibited. However, the mobile carrier must inform the consumer of the existence of a SIM lock. Anatel, Brazil&#x27;s telecom regulator, requires the carrier to unlock free of charge the mobile phone if required by the user. After this regulation most telecom operators started voluntarily unlocking the devices as soon as it was purchased so one could leave the store with an unlocked phone.

=== Canada ===
Under revisions to the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) Wireless Code of Conduct effective 1 December 2017, all new devices must be sold unlocked, and carriers must offer to unlock phones purchased prior to this date free of charge. Fees may be required if the customer was not under a contract or prepaid plan with the carrier.

After the implementation of this rule, Bell Canada initially refused to offer unlocks for users who were not customers of the carrier (in contrast to Rogers and Telus), but reversed course in February 2018 due to public backlash. In a filing to the CRTC in August 2018, Bell also stated that it had begun to reimplement SIM locks on unsold phones as an anti-theft and safety measure (the phones are unlocked during the activation process when sold to a customer), citing increases in theft from store stocks since the implementation of the prohibition.

Under the original version of the Wireless Code implemented 2013, carriers were required to offer unlocks no later than 90 calendar days from the start of a contract for subsidized devices, or immediately upon purchase of an unsubsidized device. The Code, however, did not expressly prohibit carriers from charging an unlock fee.

Prior to the introduction of the Wireless Code, New Democratic Party MP Bruce Hyer first attempted to mandate SIM unlocking at the end of cell phone contracts when he introduced a private member&#x27;s bill entitled the Cell Phone Freedom Act in 2010. The act would not have banned SIM locking but would have required wireless carriers to unlock phones at no charge at the end of a cell phone contract. The bill was introduced in two sessions of parliament but failed to pass either time.

=== China ===
Under a regulation enacted by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, locking phones to a specific carrier is prohibited if other carriers are also using the same type of network technology. Therefore, all phones approved to be sold in China are never locked to begin with regardless of whether the consumer purchased the phone under a contract or not. However, since all three Chinese carriers each uses a different network technology after the adoption of 3G, carriers started to ask phone manufacturers to disable support for network technologies not used by such carrier even if the phone has been originally designed to be capable of supporting those network technologies. Such a move does not result in violation of the ban on phone locking. For example, an iPhone 6 was designed to be capable of supporting LTE FDD, LTE TD, CDMA, and WCDMA technologies but China Mobile reached a deal with Apple to create a special model for China Mobile in addition to the off-contract retail model sold by Apple and third party vendors with the capability to support LTE FDD, CDMA, WCDMA, which are the technologies not used by China Mobile, disabled, effectively making such special contract model incompatible with the 3G and 4G networks of other carriers even though such phones are never locked.

=== Colombia ===
Starting October 1, 2011, all the mobile telephone services providers, must sell to all users unlocked devices and provide free of charge support to unlock previously sold devices. This regulation was ordered to enable mobile number portability and to facilitate the reduction on costs ordered simultaneously.

=== Chile ===
Since 1 January 2012, newly sold phones must be unlocked. Previously bought locked phones had to be unlocked for free. The regulation was put in place in order to implement mobile number portability. However, the law only requires phones to be usable with all Chilean providers. It does not cover international unlocking for use outside Chile, so users may have to pay for the unlocking service.

A new related issue is present since 23 September 2017, every IMEI have to be registered so the phone works in the country. For local carriers, they do the process, but to use a phone from outside the country, each user has to register it. IMEI Registration.

=== Croatia ===
In Croatia, for devices bought on contract, the mobile operator must provide the unlock code on the user&#x27;s request free of charge. Such request can be made immediately after buying the phone, and the operator has a 15-day period to fulfill the request. For devices bought on a prepaid plan, the user has to wait at least 12 months before submitting such request.

=== Denmark ===
The carrier can choose to bind contracts up to 6 months from the contract&#x27;s start. Many of the carriers choose not to lock the phones. Only Hi3G (&quot;3&quot;) lock their phones, but can only do so for six months. If the phone needs to be unlocked within the first six months, the carrier can charge DKK 500 (~ €67) for the unlock. After six months, the carrier is obliged by law to unlock the phone free of charge. But the consumer needs to contact the original supplier, and provide the IMEI and original phone number for which the phone was sold.

=== Ecuador ===
Although there is no specific law preventing SIM locking, as of December 2009 Ecuador&#x27;s two biggest carriers, Porta and Movistar, unlock phones previously sold by them, without charge.

===European Union===
Countries in the European Union (EU) each have their own legislation on SIM locking, but must comply with the EU Unfair Commercial Practices Directive (Directive 2005/29/EC of 2005). As noted above, this directive has been successfully applied in Belgium to overturn that country&#x27;s previous ban on bundling phones with contracts. However, carriers in many countries in the EU do not necessarily associate a phone&#x27;s SIM lock status to the customer&#x27;s tie-in contract status.

=== Finland ===
In Finland, carriers are not allowed to sell SIM-locked GSM phones, nor are they allowed to offer tie-in sales on GSM equipment. Under Finnish law, a tie-in sale is defined as selling the equipment for a discounted price contingent on the consumer also acquiring a new service contract from the seller. Under the terms of a provisional exception, valid from 2006 until 2009, tie-in sales were permitted with 3G handsets, and 3G equipment which is purchased under such tie-in sales may be SIM-locked. The SIM lock must be removed free of charge at the conclusion of the tie-in contract, within a maximum duration of 2 years. In 2008, the Finnish government was preparing to extend the exception, and at the same time, was considering reducing the duration of tie-in contracts to one year.

=== France ===
In France, SIM locks are not prohibited. However, the mobile operator must inform the consumer of the existence of a SIM lock, and the subscriber has the right to request that the lock be removed at any time. No later than three months after the subscription of the contract, the mobile operator must &quot;systematically and free of charge&quot; provide the subscriber with a procedure to deactivate the SIM lock. Proposal to shorten the time that operators may charge a fee for removing the SIM lock prior from six-month to the three-month deadline.

=== Germany ===
In Germany, there does not appear to be any effective law regulating SIM locking. For example, the iPhone was initially offered for sale in Germany exclusively through T-Mobile, and it was locked to T-Mobile&#x27;s network. They began to provide unlocking codes for that phone after they were sued by Vodafone and a temporary injunction was issued requiring T-Mobile to do so. Vodafone&#x27;s injunction was later overturned, and the iPhone is again available exclusively locked to T-Mobile. While T-Mobile Germany told the court that they would unlock the iPhone after the contract, they were doing it voluntarily.

While SIM locking is legal, a court ruled in 2012 that providers must clearly inform potential customers about the SIM lock.

As of 2015, usually only prepaid mobile phones are sold with a SIM lock. Phones sold with a contract stipulating monthly payments are not typically locked (as the monthly payments are due no matter what network the phone is used on). Also, most providers will unlock the phone on demand. Usually a fee is charged during the first two years after purchase; afterwards the unlocking is free. As of 2022, new phones are rarely distributed with a SIM lock; old phones however may still be locked.

=== Honduras ===
In Honduras, there is a general law applicable to all consumer relations engaged in the national territory and provided by natural or legal persons, public or private. This law is called &quot;Ley de Proteccion al Consumidor&quot; or &quot;Consumer Protection Act of Honduras&quot;, approved by Legislative Decree No.24-2008, and it regulates the activities of any goods and services providers stating the principles that they must follow in order to operate in this country.

Article 20 of this law states the prohibitions that sellers are obliged to abide when selling a good or providing a service to people. Paragraph 7 of this article states that it is prohibited to a provider to &quot;place seals, adhesives, duct tapes or analogous mechanisms, which prevent the consumer to make free use of the product, except those mechanisms used by the manufacturer for warranty purposes&quot;.

Even though the existence of this law, local carriers continue to apply SIM restrictions to the phones they sell. For example, the iPhone is sold by Claro in Honduras and is SIM-locked. which suggests that this general consumer protection law does not prohibit SIM locking of cell phones

=== Hong Kong ===
In Hong Kong, carriers are not allowed to SIM-lock a phone for the sole purpose of tying customers to their network. But Hong Kong carriers can SIM-lock a phone to protect the handset subsidy, to enforce mobile plan contracts or to protect from theft. After the initial purchase subsidy has been recovered, or the full cost of the equipment has been paid up under a rental or installment agreement, the carrier must provide a detailed procedure for unlocking the equipment free of charge upon request.

=== India ===
SIM locking is not common in India. Initially, each state in India had a different mobile network operator and roaming across states was prohibitive. It was cheaper to change the SIM card than pay high roaming charges. The number of inter-state travelers demanded unlocked phones. Usually, phones and SIM cards are sold separately. Mobile phone manufacturers sell phones directly to customers rather than through network operators. Dual SIM phones are quite common in use, with users choosing to make calls using a cheaper operator suitable for the particular call and time of the day from a Dual SIM phone without even switching it off. This along with other factors, encouraged competition among network operators and brought down the mobile phone call charges in from the initial 32 (US$0.75) in 1996 to 0.50 (US$0.005 approx.) in 2011. The rates still differ from one service provider to another and across different tariff schemes provided by the same operator. Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) is the independent regulator of the telecommunications business in India, established to check call rates and resolve all communication related issues and holds the upper hand in fixing call rates.

=== Israel ===
According to the Arrangements Law passed on December 29, 2010, Israeli carriers are banned from locking handsets sold by them, and are obligated to unlock any handset previously sold at no charge.

=== Italy ===
Italy has SIM locking laws requiring that carriers must specify the amount of subsidies, and allow subscribers to obtain unlocking codes after nine months by paying half of the listed subsidies. After 18 months, the SIM lock must be removed.

===Japan===
Japan&#x27;s Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications has legislated that all smartphones and tablets released after May 1, 2015, by NTT DoCoMo, au/Okinawa Cellular and SoftBank Mobile (the three major carriers in Japan) must be sold without a SIM lock upon request from customers and without any cost to the customer involved. Before that, from 2011 until 2015, only NTT DoCoMo and au/Okinawa Cellular would remove the SIM lock from phones with a SIM unlock function after the phone is kept or used at least six months after purchase.

===Monaco===
In Monaco, the partially state-owned communications mobile company Monaco Telecom does not sell SIM-locked phones. As there is no competition, consumers usually buy standard mobile phones that are not locked to any specific carrier.

=== Netherlands ===
Dutch mobile carriers have an agreement with the Netherlands&#x27; telecom regulator, OPTA, to establish a code of conduct with respect to SIM locking — specifically, unlocking fees can be charged within the first 12 months and SIM lock cannot last longer than 12 months.

In a 2002 letter to the Dutch Secretary of State of Economic Affairs, OPTA stated that the telecom regulator has decided to start working on the formalization of the voluntary code of conduct into legislation. However, a 2006 report written by the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs, stated that competition in the Dutch mobile market is sufficient and the formalization of the voluntary code of conduct into legislation is not needed. Thus there are no SIM locking laws in the Netherlands.

=== New Zealand ===
Locking was planned in New Zealand before May 2008 when Vodafone New Zealand announced they would begin locking handsets. The company had planned to charge $50 to unlock them, but then relented. It is speculated that the intention to lock was prompted by Telecom New Zealand building their new mobile network based on UMTS technology, allowing handsets to change networks for the first time. Until that point in time, Telecom&#x27;s network (the only other mobile network at that time) was based on CDMA technology, meaning that it was not possible to change networks. 2degrees were also building a mobile network based on UMTS at this time. 
After pressure from the Commerce Commission, Vodafone relented on its locking policy, and will unlock any locked phones for free once they have been owned for nine months. You can pay to have it unlocked prior to this.

Following speculation of a new lower cost, MNVO of Telecom XT details were leaked regarding the Skinny Mobile Network, which would SIM lock handsets.

As of 2015, Vodafone, Spark, Skinny, and 2Degrees all charged a $30 unlock fee for phones owned for less than 9 months.
As of 2020, Spark charges a $30 unlock fee for phones owned for less than 9 months, unless the customer is on a Pay Monthly 24 Month Plan.
2Degrees dropped its fees for unlocking phones.

=== Norway ===
Phones sold with a subscription are usually SIM locked to Norwegian carriers. The fee varies depending on how long it has been since you purchased your mobile phone. After 12 months, you can enter the operator lock code yourself without paying for it.

=== Pakistan ===
Ufone has started SIM Locking with the release of its new smartphone named Smart U5 developed by Emitac Services, UAE. U5 comes SIM locked to Ufone only. No other SIM can be used on the U5.

=== Peru ===
According to OSIPTEL Peru&#x27;s telecom regulator, article 23 of the Terms of use, mobile carriers can sell phones locked for a lower price for 12, 18 or 24-month contracts, but also must sell unlocked devices for the full price. The same article dictates the customer can request the unlock code for free after 12 months from the purchase date, no matter if the contract is still in place. The sole exception is if the customer cancels the contract before its end and pays the remaining cost, at which point the customer can request the device be unlocked at any time. OSIPTEL plans to reduce the time customers must wait to remove their SIM locks to 6 months.

=== Portugal ===
A 2006 study sponsored by the Portugal regulator, ANACOM, on handset subsidies and SIM locking concluded that there are no special regulatory concerns on offering subsidized SIM-locked equipment in exchange for signing a contract tying a customer to a particular network. Network providers are allowed to apply SIM locks as they see fit, and they may voluntarily remove them if they choose to do so. In the paper, the author stated that the average unlocking fee charged by Portuguese carriers is 90-100 euros.
A recently approved law requires network operators to unlock a device free of charge if the respective contract has already expired (But they refuse to do so charging at least 10 euros). It also establishes limits to the fees that operators may charge to unlock a device while it is still under contract.

=== Romania ===
Romanian telecom regulator ANCOM signed a code of conduct with several Romanian carriers providing that as of September 1, 2009 mobile operators selling handsets locked within their own network have to inform clients whether the handset is locked and provide unlocking upon request. It is &quot;self-regulation&quot; by the carriers to prevent the regulator from actually imposing regulations on them. If the handset is not purchased together with other electronic communications services, the mobile telephony operator that sells it will bear the unlocking costs and will not bind the terminal unlocking by the purchase of other services or by the payment of other fees.

If the handset is purchased as part of a promotional package or at a preferential price and the customer requires the unlocking before the expiry of the minimum period provided in the contract for communications services concluded with the operator, the customer will have to pay both the unlocking fee and the penalty for the anticipated unlocking of the handset. The price charged to unlock handsets will not exceed the costs of this operation and operators are obliged to meet unlocking requests within 15 days.

=== Russia ===
SIM locking is not common in Russia, but they have huge potentials to sell unlocked phones. Most mobile phones sold in Russia doesn&#x27;t have extensive bundlings, customizations as well as the carrier-specific bloatware. Beeline-branded phones are always locked to their network operator.

=== Serbia ===
In telecommunication contracts it is frequent the practice to lock the use of a sim card of one operator with a phone acquired through the same mobile operator. Obstructing the unlocking of the phone may be illegal if the consumer is entitled to it.

=== Singapore ===
In 1997, Singapore&#x27;s then-telecommunications regulator, Telecommunication Authority of Singapore (now Infocomm Media Authority of Singapore) enforced a legislation where telcos (Singtel, StarHub, M1, Circles.Life, MyRepublic, TPG Telecom and Zero1) are not allowed to SIM-lock devices, such as phones, tablets and smartwatches that are imported and sold in Singapore. In August 1997, TAS warned at least one operator, M1, for selling SIM-locked phones.

=== Spain ===
In 1998, the then-Spanish telecom regulator, &quot;Tribunal de Defensa de la Competencia&quot; (now &quot;Comisión Nacional de los Mercados y la Competencia&quot;), saw that Spanish mobile carriers already provided unlocking codes voluntarily for a fee within the first 12 months and for free after 12 months, so it decided not to establish any legal framework in Spain. CMT has not revisited this decision since then, therefore there are no SIM-locking laws in Spain.

=== Sweden ===
In Sweden, carriers are required to unlock handsets after 12 months since purchase. This applies both to on-contract and pay as you go phones. All carriers will charge a fee of 300 SEK (approximately $45) or 350 SEK (approximately $50), depending on carrier, to unlock the handset. However, as of 2016, most carriers have stopped locking phones altogether.

=== Switzerland ===
SIM locking may be particularly common in Switzerland. Swisscom began lifting SIM lock since July 2013. Sunrise prepaid mobile phones have a SIM lock for 2 years from purchase.

=== Thailand ===

Thailand is also another country that forbids outright SIM locking and as a result, no phones are sold in the market are subsidized by carriers. Up until recently mobile phone manufacturers have their own store fronts and mobile carriers are only the service providers.

=== Turkey ===
SIM locking is forbidden by the regulatory authority in Turkey since 2013. There are conflicting and varying reports about former practices of SIM locking by operators. A newspaper column from 1997 criticizes Telsim&#x27;s SIM locking policy: &quot;... you cannot quit Telsim until the phone becomes waste, the only way to quit Telsim is buying a new phone.&quot; Turkcell&#x27;s SIM locking policy has been subject to a lawsuit in 2001, resulting in Turkcell being fined. BlackBerry phones sold by Turkcell and Vodafone were SIM locked, however, could be unlocked on request without any conditions. Yet, the SIM locking practice was only confined to phones sold by operators and it is not clear if operators enforced SIM locking on the phones sold by them tightly or not and if the practice was widespread. Phones sold by other channels were strictly unlocked. Three major mobile network operators, Turkcell, Türk Telekom and Vodafone still offer phones with long term contracts, however these phones are sold unlocked.

=== United Kingdom ===
In the United Kingdom, mobile phone network providers are not obliged to provide unlocking, even after the end of the contract. Ofcom, UK&#x27;s telecom regulator, allowed 3 to sell a mobile phone with the SIM card permanently superglued to the phone. Most operators offer some form of unlocking service, depending on the state of the contract and the model of phone, but usually for a charge. The full Oftel 2002 SIM-lock position paper specifies that there is no SIM-locking law in the UK; the regulator wants only &quot;consumer awareness&quot;. The examples within the position paper are just &quot;examples&quot; of current carrier practices for illustration purposes, but do not reflect any official Oftel regulation. The main networks often agree to unlock handsets for a charge, either at the end of a contract or, for prepaid handsets, after several months. Some Blackberry handsets supplied by Vodafone (e.g., Storm) are examples of a UK carrier not offering unlocking codes. As of April 2011 O2 will unlock any of their pay-monthly phones for free, even if they&#x27;re still in contract, with the exception of handsets made exclusively for them, such as their Palm devices.
Carphone Warehouse, one of the largest UK phone retailers, offers unlocked phones with most PAYG deals.
As of January 1, 2014, all phones sold by 3 UK are unlocked. Phones bought before this date will be unlocked for free.

On 17 December 2019, Ofcom announced that it would explore a mandate banning SIM locking. On 27 October 2020, The UK&#x27;s mobile networks are to be forbidden from selling phones locked to their services from December 2021.

=== United States ===
One of the two American GSM carriers, T-Mobile, will unlock handsets for those with active account in good standing for at least 40 days and no unlock code request in the last 90 days. The other, AT&amp;T Mobility, is required to do so upon request (with some exceptions and requirements) after ninety days of active service under the terms of a class action settlement. Prior to the settlement, AT&amp;T would usually do so once one has concluded their contract, and in some other situations. AT&amp;T had in the past stated that it would not unlock iPhones under any circumstances, regardless of the legality of doing so, even after customers are out of contract. However, AT&amp;T has since announced that starting April 8, 2012, it will begin unlocking off-contract iPhones, provided that the customer&#x27;s account is in good standing. AT&amp;T also has an unannounced policy of unlocking iPhones for United States service members who are deployed overseas—even if they are still under contract.

Before carriers began voluntarily providing unlock codes for all phone models, in 2010 the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) successfully convinced the United States Copyright Office to allow an exemption to the general prohibition on circumvention of copyright protection systems under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 for unlocking of phones through user self-help (sometimes referred to as &quot;hacking&quot;). This exemption has become less important now that most carriers are voluntarily providing unlock codes.

According to a ruling effective October 28, 2012, it will be illegal to unlock phones purchased 90 days after this date or later without the carrier&#x27;s permission. In other words, users can already unlock phones they already own, and phones purchased before January 29, 2013, but phones purchased after this point can only be unlocked with the carrier&#x27;s permission.

In March 2013, the Obama administration and the Federal Communications Commission said consumers should also be able to switch carriers and keep their actual phones.

On August 1, 2014, President Obama signed into law the Unlocking Consumer Choice and Wireless Competition Act (S. 517; 113th Congress), a bill legalizing unlocking cellphones in the US. The bill passed in the United States Senate on July 15, 2014, and in the United States House of Representatives on July 25, 2014.

Sprint agreed to allow domestic unlocking on all mobile devices launched after February 15, 2015.

It is possible to buy unlocked phones in the U.S. Some online retailers sell phones that come unlocked from the manufacturer, that is, they were never locked in the first place.

<text>Gulls, or colloquially seagulls, are seabirds of the subfamily Larinae. They are most closely related to terns and skimmers, distantly related to auks, and even more distantly related to waders. Until the 21st century, most gulls were placed in the genus &quot;Larus&quot;, but that arrangement is now considered polyphyletic, leading to the resurrection of several genera. An older name for gulls is mews; this still exists in certain regional English dialects and is cognate with German , Danish &#x27;, Swedish&#x27;, Dutch &#x27;, Norwegian&#x27;, and French &quot;&quot;.

Typically medium to large in size, gulls are usually grey or white, often with black markings on the head or wings. They normally have harsh wailing or squawking calls; stout, longish bills; and webbed feet. Most gulls are ground-nesting piscivores or carnivores which take live food or scavenge opportunistically, particularly the &quot;Larus&quot; species. Live food often includes crustaceans, molluscs, fish and small birds. Gulls have unhinging jaws that provide the flexibility to consume large prey. Gulls are typically coastal or inland species, rarely venturing far out to sea, except for the kittiwakes and Sabine&#x27;s gull. The large species take up to four years to attain full adult plumage, but two years is typical for small gulls. Large white-headed gulls are usually long-lived birds, with a maximum age of 49 years recorded for the European herring gull.

Gulls nest in large, densely packed, noisy colonies. They lay two or three speckled eggs in nests composed of vegetation. The young are precocial, born with dark mottled down and mobile upon hatching. Gulls are resourceful, inquisitive, and intelligent, the larger species in particular, demonstrating complex methods of communication and a highly developed social structure. For example, many gull colonies display mobbing behaviour, attacking and harassing predators and other intruders. Certain species, such as the herring gull, have exhibited tool-use behaviour, for example using pieces of bread as bait with which to catch goldfish. Many species of gulls have learned to coexist successfully with humans and thrive in human habitats. Others rely on kleptoparasitism to get their food. Gulls have been observed preying on live whales, landing on the whale as it surfaces and pecking out pieces of flesh.

==Description and morphology==

Gulls range in size from the little gull, at and , to the great black-backed gull, at and . They are generally uniform in shape, with heavy bodies, long wing, and moderately long necks. The tails of all but three species are rounded; the exceptions being Sabine&#x27;s gull and swallow-tailed gulls, which have forked tails, and Ross&#x27;s gull, which has a wedge-shaped tail. Gulls have moderately long legs, especially when compared to the similar terns, with fully webbed feet. The bill is generally heavy and slightly hooked, with the larger species having stouter bills than the smaller species. The bill colour is often yellow with a red spot for the larger white-headed species and red, dark red or black in the smaller species.

Gulls are a generalist species that can thrive in various environments and survive on a widely varied diet. They are the least specialised of all the seabirds, and their morphology allows for equal adeptness in swimming, flying, and walking. They are more adept walking on land than most other seabirds, and the smaller gulls tend to be more manoeuvrable while walking. The walking gait of gulls includes a slight side to side motion, something that can be exaggerated in breeding displays. In the air, they are able to hover and they are also able to take off quickly with little space.

The general pattern of plumage in adult gulls is a white body with a darker mantle; the extent to which the mantle is darker varies from pale grey to black. A few species vary in this, the ivory gull is entirely white, and some like the lava gull and Heermann&#x27;s gull have partly or entirely grey bodies. The wingtips of most species are black, which improves their resistance to wear and tear, usually with a diagnostic pattern of white markings. The head of a gull may be covered by a dark hood or be entirely white. The plumage of the head varies by breeding season; in nonbreeding dark-hooded gulls, the hood is lost, sometimes leaving a single spot behind the eye, and in white-headed gulls, nonbreeding heads may have streaking.

==Distribution and habitat==
Gulls have a worldwide cosmopolitan distribution. They breed on every continent, including the margins of Antarctica, and are even found in the high Arctic. They are less common in the tropics, although a few species do live on tropical islands such as the Galapagos and New Caledonia. Many species breed in coastal colonies, with a preference for islands; one particular species, the grey gull, breeds in the interior of dry deserts far from water. Considerable variety exists in the Laridae family, and species may breed and feed in marine, freshwater, or terrestrial habitats.

Most gull species are migratory, with birds moving to warmer habitats during the winter, but the extent to which they migrate varies by species. Some migrate long distances, notably Sabine&#x27;s gull, which migrates from the Arctic coasts to wintering grounds off the west coasts of South America and southern Africa, and Franklin&#x27;s gull, which migrates from Canada to winter off the west coast of South America. Other species move much shorter distances and may simply disperse along the coasts near their breeding sites.

A big influence on non-breeding gull distribution is the availability of food patches. Human fisheries especially have an impact, since they often provide an abundant and predictable food resource. Two species of gulls dependent on human fisheries are Audouin&#x27;s gull (&quot;Ichthyaetus audouinii&quot;) and lesser black-backed gulls (&quot;Larus fuscus)&quot;; their breeding distributions (especially the black-backed gull) are heavily impacted by human fishing discards and fishing ports.

Other environmental drivers that structure bird habitat and distribution are human activity and climate impacts. For example, waterbird distribution in Mediterranean wetlands is influenced by changes in salinity, water depth, water body isolation and , all of which have been observed to affect the bird community structure in both a species- and guild-specific way. Gulls in particular have high associations with salinity levels, which were found to be the main environmental predictor for waterbird assemblage.

==Behaviour==
===Diet and feeding===
Charadriiform birds drink salt water, as well as fresh water, as they possess exocrine glands located in supraorbital grooves of the skull by which salt can be excreted through the nostrils to assist the kidneys in maintaining electrolyte balance.
Gulls are highly adaptable feeders that take a wide range of prey opportunistically. The food taken by gulls includes fish, and marine and freshwater invertebrates, both alive and already dead; terrestrial arthropods and invertebrates such as insects and earthworms; rodents, eggs, carrion, offal, reptiles, amphibians, seeds, fruit, human refuse, and even other birds. No gull species is a single-prey specialist, and no gull species forages using only a single method. The type of food depends on circumstances; terrestrial prey, e.g. seeds, fruit and earthworms, is more common during the breeding season, while marine prey is more common in the nonbreeding season when birds spend more time on large bodies of water.
Gulls not only take a wide range of prey, they also display great versatility in how they obtain it; prey can be caught in the air, on water, or on land. A number of hooded species are able to hawk insects on the wing, although the larger species perform this feat more rarely. Gulls on the wing snatch items both off the water and off the ground, and they are able to plunge-dive into water to catch prey. Smaller species are more manoeuvrable and better able to hover-dip fish from the air. Dipping is common when birds are sitting on the water, and gulls may swim in tight circles or foot paddle to bring marine invertebrates up to the surface. 

Food is also obtained by searching the ground, often on the shore among sand, mud or rocks. Larger gulls tend to do more feeding in this way. Gulls may also engage in foot paddling in shallow water for invertebrates or on wet grass for earthworms. One method of obtaining prey involves dropping heavy shells of clams and mussels onto hard surfaces. Gulls may fly some distance to find a suitable surface on which to drop shells, and there is evidently a learned component to the task because older birds are more successful than younger birds. While overall feeding success is a function of age, the diversity in both prey and feeding methods is not. The time taken to learn foraging skills may explain the delayed maturation in gulls.

Gulls have only a limited ability to dive below the water surface to feed on deeper prey. To obtain prey from a greater depth, many species of gulls feed in association with other animals, where marine hunters drive prey to the surface when hunting. Examples of such associations include four species of gulls that feed around plumes of mud brought to the surface by feeding grey whales, and also between orcas (the largest dolphin species) and kelp gulls (among other seabirds).

Looking at the effect of humans on gull diet, overfishing of target prey such as sardines have caused a shift in diet and behaviour. Analysis of the yellow-legged gull&#x27;s (&quot;Larus michahellis)&quot; pellets off the northwest coast of Spain has revealed a shift from a sardine to crustacean-based diet. This shift was linked to higher fishing efficiency and thus overall fish stock depletion. Lastly, closure of nearby open-air landfills limited food availability for the gulls, further creating a stress on their shift in diet. From 1974 to 1994, yellow-legged gull populations on Berlenga Island, Portugal, increased from 2600 to 44,698 individuals. Analyzing both adult and chick remains, researchers found a mixture of both natural prey and human refuse. The gulls relied substantially on the Henslow&#x27;s swimming crab (&quot;Polybius henslowii&quot;). Yet, in times when local prey availability is low, the gulls shift to human-related food. These temporal shifts from marine to terrestrial prey highlight the resilience of adult gulls and their ability to keep chick condition consistent. Human disturbance has also been shown to have an effect on gull breeding, in which hatching failure is directly proportional to the amount of disturbance in a given plot. Certain gull breeds have been known to feast on the eyeballs of baby seals and directly pilfer milk from the elephant seal&#x27;s teat.
===Breeding===


Gulls are monogamous and colonial breeders that display mate fidelity which normally lasts for the life of the pair. Divorce of mated pairs does occur, but it apparently has a social cost that persists for a number of years after the break-up. Gulls also display high levels of site fidelity, returning to the same colony after breeding there once and even usually breeding at the same location within that colony. Gull colonies can vary from just a few pairs to over a hundred thousand pairs, and may be exclusive to that gull species or shared with other seabird species. A few species nest singly, and single pairs of band-tailed gulls may breed in colonies of other bird species. Within colonies, gull pairs are territorial, defending an area of varying size around the nesting site from others of their species. This area can be as large as a radius around the nest in the European herring gull to just a tiny area of cliff ledge in the kittiwakes.

Most gulls breed once a year and have predictable breeding seasons lasting for three to five months. Gulls begin to assemble around the colony for a few weeks prior to occupying it. Existing pairs re-establish their pair-bonds, and unpaired birds begin courting. Pairs then move back into their territories, and new males establish new territories and attempt to court females. Gulls defend their territories from rivals of both sexes using calls and aerial attacks.

Nest building is an important part of the pair-bonding process. Most gull nests are mats of matter with a central nest cup. Nests are usually built on the ground, but a few species establish their nests on cliffs (the usual preference for kittiwakes), and some choose to nest in trees and high places (e.g. Bonaparte&#x27;s gulls). Species that nest in marshes need to construct a nesting platform to keep the nest dry, particularly species that nest in tidal marshes. Both sexes gather nesting material and build the nest, but the division of labour is not always exactly equal. In coastal towns, many gulls nest on rooftops and can be observed by nearby human residents.

Clutch size is typically three eggs, although some of the smaller gulls only lay two, and the swallow-tailed gull produces a single egg. Birds synchronise their laying within colonies, with a higher level of synchronisation in larger colonies. The eggs of gulls are usually dark tan to brown or dark olive with dark splotches and scrawl markings, and they are well camouflaged. Both sexes incubate the eggs; incubation bouts last between one and four hours during the day, and one parent incubates through the night. Research on various bird species, including gulls, suggests that females form pair bonds with other females to obtain alloparental care for their dependent offspring, a behaviour seen in other animal species, such as elephants, wolves, and the fathead minnow.

Lasting between 22 and 26 days, incubation begins after the first egg is laid but is not continuous until after the second egg is laid, meaning that the first two chicks hatch at about the same time, and the third some time later. Young chicks are brooded by their parents for about one or two weeks, and often at least one parent stays behind to guard the chicks until they fledge. Although the chicks are fed by both parents, early on in the rearing period the male does most of the feeding and the female most of the brooding and guarding.

==Taxonomy==
The family Laridae was introduced (as Laridia) by the French polymath Constantine Samuel Rafinesque in 1815. The taxonomy of gulls is confused by their widespread distribution zones of hybridisation leading to gene flow. Some have traditionally been considered ring species, but research has suggested that this assumption is questionable. Before the 21st century, most gulls were placed in the genus &quot;Larus&quot;, but this arrangement is now known to be polyphyletic, leading to the resurrection of the genera &quot;Ichthyaetus&quot;, &quot;Chroicocephalus&quot;, &quot;Leucophaeus&quot;, &quot;Saundersilarus&quot;, and &quot;Hydrocoloeus&quot;. Some English names refer to species complexes within the group:

* Large white-headed gull is used to describe the 18 or so herring gull-like species, from California gull to lesser black-backed gull in the taxonomic list below.
* White-winged gull is used to describe the four pale-winged, high Arctic-breeding taxa within the former group; these are Iceland gull, glaucous gull, Thayer&#x27;s gull, and Kumlien&#x27;s gull.

In common usage, members of various gull species are often referred to as &#x27;sea gulls&#x27; or &#x27;seagulls&#x27;; however, this is a layperson&#x27;s term and is not used by most ornithologists and biologists. The name is used informally to refer to a common local species (or all gulls in general) and has no fixed taxonomic meaning. In common usage, gull-like seabirds that are not technically gulls (e.g. albatrosses, fulmars, terns, and skuas) may also be referred to as &#x27;seagulls&#x27; by the layperson.

The American Ornithologists&#x27; Union combines the Sternidae, Stercorariidae, and Rhynchopidae as subfamilies in the family Laridae, but early 21st-century research shows this to be incorrect.

A molecular phylogenetic study published in 2022 found the following relationships between the genera, including the most recent generic change: the placement of Saunders&#x27;s gull in its own genus &quot;Saundersilarus&quot;.
==List of species==
This is a list of the 54 gull species, presented in taxonomic sequence.

==Evolutionary history==
The Laridae are known from not-yet-published fossil evidence since the Early Oligocene, some 30–33 million years ago. Three gull-like species were described by Alphonse Milne-Edwards from the early Miocene of Saint-Gérand-le-Puy, France. A fossil gull from the Middle to Late Miocene of Cherry County, Nebraska, US, is placed in the prehistoric genus &quot;Gaviota&quot;; apart from this and the undescribed Early Oligocene fossil, all prehistoric species were tentatively assigned to the modern genus &quot;Larus&quot;. Among those of them that have been confirmed as gulls, Milne-Edwards&#x27; &quot;&quot;Larus&quot; elegans&quot; and &quot;&quot;L.&quot; totanoides&quot; from the Late Oligocene/Early Miocene of southeast France have since been separated in &quot;Laricola&quot;.

<text>Atalanta Bergamasca Calcio, commonly referred to as Atalanta, is a professional football club based in Bergamo, Lombardy, Italy, who compete in Serie A, the top tier of the Italian league system. 

Founded in 1907, Atalanta holds the record for having played the most Serie A seasons (63) without being based in a regional capital and without having won the league title. Furthermore, the club also holds the record for most promotions to the Serie A and the joint-most Serie B titles, alongside Genoa. 

Atalanta won the Coppa Italia in 1963 and the UEFA Europa League in 2023–24. The club qualified for the UEFA Champions League four times, reaching the quarter-finals in 2020, and participated in six seasons of the UEFA Europa League (previously known as the UEFA Cup). Atalanta also reached the semi-finals of the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup in 1988, when it was competing in Serie B. This is still the joint-best performance ever by a non-first division club in a major UEFA competition. 

The club plays its home games at the Gewiss Stadium and its main kit colors are black and blue. Atalanta has a long-standing rivalry with nearby club Brescia. The club is also famed for its youth academy, which has produced several notable talents who have played in the top leagues of Europe.

==History==
===Founding and establishment in Serie A (1907–1959)===

Atalanta was founded on 17 October 1907 by students of the Liceo Classico Paolo Sarpi and was named after the female athlete of the same name from Greek mythology. Though it immediately established a football sector, it was not the first football association based in Bergamo: &quot;Football Club Bergamo&quot; was founded by Swiss emigrants in 1904 and was absorbed into another club, &quot;Bergamasca&quot;, in 1911. The Italian Football Federation did not recognize Atalanta until 1914, and in 1919 announced that it would only allow one club from Bergamo to compete in the highest national league (then called the Prima Categoria). As Atalanta and Bergamasca were rivals and did not come to an agreement, admission to the Prima Categoria was decided by a playoff match; Atalanta won this match 2–0. A merger between the two clubs nevertheless occurred in 1920, forming the new club &quot;Atalanta Bergamasca di Ginnastica e Scherma 1907&quot; (shortened to &quot;Atalanta Bergamasca Calcio&quot;) and establishing its black and blue (&quot;nerazzurri&quot;) colors.

Atalanta competed in the Seconda Divisione, the second tier, during the early 1920s. In the 1927–28 season, the club won its group and subsequently defeated Pistoiese in the playoffs to win promotion and its first second division league triumph. The club inaugurated its current home stadium in the Borgo Santa Caterina neighborhood in 1928, and was admitted to Serie B, the second tier of the restructured Italian league, in 1929. After almost a decade in Serie B, Atalanta achieved its first promotion to Serie A in 1937 under coach Ottavio Barbieri, though was relegated at the end of the season. The club returned to Serie A in 1940 as champion of Serie B.

During the 1940s, Atalanta performed consistently in the top flight, though the national league was halted between 1943 and 1945 due to World War II. Atalanta achieved a fifth-place finish in the 1947–48 Serie A under coach Ivo Fiorentini, its highest league finish until 2017. The club earned a reputation as the &quot;provinciale terribile&quot; (terrible provincial team) during this time as a result of its successes against well-known metropolitan teams such as the &quot;Grande Torino&quot;, who won Serie A five times during the 1940s. Atalanta achieved mid-table finishes during much of the 1950s and remained in Serie A until 1958, when it was relegated due to accusations of match fixing. These accusations were found to be false a year later, after the club returned to Serie A by winning its second Serie B title.

===Coppa Italia victory, decline, and reemergence in Europe (1959–1994)===
Atalanta won the Coppa Italia in 1963, defeating Torino 3–1 in the final thanks to a hat-trick by striker Angelo Domenghini. This was the senior team&#x27;s first major trophy. During the early 1960s, the club made its debut in European competitions, among them the 1961–62 Mitropa Cup, the Coppa dell&#x27;Amicizia, and the Coppa delle Alpi. As domestic cup winners, the club qualified for the 1963–64 European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, its first major UEFA competition, though was eliminated by Portuguese club Sporting CP in the first round. The club made a few more appearances in international (though not UEFA) cups during the 1960s, though was relegated in 1969 after a decade in the top flight.

During the 1970s, Atalanta experienced several movements between Serie A and Serie B, and was in the second tier for four consecutive seasons between 1973 and 1977. Despite playing in Serie B at the time, the club developed several young players who moved on to historically bigger clubs and won the 1982 FIFA World Cup with Italy. Several difficult seasons then saw Atalanta fall into Serie B in 1980 and Serie C1 in 1981, when for the first time in its history, the club would play outside the top two tiers. This was a blow that revitalized the club, from which many changes in management followed.

Under new management, Atalanta comfortably won Group A of Serie C1 in 1982, returning to Serie B the next season and then to Serie A in 1984, where it would remain until 1987. Atalanta reached its second Coppa Italia final in 1987, though lost 4–0 to Napoli over two legs. As Napoli also won Serie A that season and therefore qualified for the European Cup, Atalanta qualified for its second European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup. This was a turning point for the club; Emiliano Mondonico was appointed as coach and the club would achieve promotion after only one season in Serie B. In the Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, Atalanta lost its first match against Welsh club Merthyr Tydfil, but won the return fixture and went on to reach the semi-finals, where it would be eliminated 4–2 on aggregate by Belgian club K.V. Mechelen, who would eventually win the tournament. In doing so, Atalanta achieved the best finish in a UEFA competition of a club playing outside its country&#x27;s top flight league. With a sixth-place finish in the 1988–89 Serie A, Atalanta qualified for its first UEFA Cup, though was eliminated by Russian club Spartak Moscow in the first round. Atalanta then finished seventh in the 1989–90 Serie A and reached the quarterfinals of the 1990–91 UEFA Cup, losing to local rival and eventual winner Internazionale.
===Fluctuating performances (1994–2016)===
After several upper mid-table finishes and a narrowly missed UEFA cup qualification in 1993, the club was relegated in 1994 after several investments to raise the club&#x27;s goals failed, though would return to Serie A in 1995. In the 1995–96 season, Atalanta reached the Coppa Italia final again, losing against Fiorentina. In 1996–97 season, striker Filippo Inzaghi scored 24 league goals and became the first (and so far only) Atalanta player to be named &quot;capocannoniere&quot; (Serie A top scorer). The club then sold several key players, causing it to struggle and return to Serie B in 1998; it would remain there until 2000, when coach Giovanni Vavassori revitalized the team with youth academy players in a successful promotion campaign.

In the 2000s, Atalanta experienced more divisional movements: it was relegated in 2002–03 (despite finishing seventh two years prior) and 2004–05, but achieved promotion to Serie A after only one season in Serie B both times, winning the 2005–06 edition. After a tumultuous 2009–10 season, which saw the club change coach three times, the club was once again relegated; after this relegation, entrepreneur Antonio Percassi became the club&#x27;s new president. and Stefano Colantuono returned as coach. The club won Serie B in 2011 and thus immediately returned to Serie A. Despite this success, club captain Cristiano Doni was named among the suspects in a match-fixing scandal (also known as &quot;Calcioscommesse&quot;); Doni was handed a three-and-a-half-year ban from football and the club was docked six points in the 2011–12 league table and two points in the 2012–13 league table. Throughout the early and mid-2010s, Atalanta generally lingered in lower-midtable in Serie A.

===New heights under Gasperini (2016–present)===

Former Genoa coach Gian Piero Gasperini was appointed before the 2016–17 season. Despite initial difficulties, the club&#x27;s results steadily improved throughout the season. Gasperini integrated players from the club&#x27;s youth sector and led the club to a fourth-place league finish with 72 points, besting its previous records and qualifying for the 2017–18 UEFA Europa League after a 26-year absence from UEFA competitions. In the Europa League, the club reached the round of 32, losing 4–3 on aggregate to Borussia Dortmund. In 2017–18, Atalanta finished seventh in the league, entering the qualifying rounds for 2018–19 UEFA Europa League, though was eliminated in a penalty shootout by Danish club Copenhagen. Despite a difficult start to the 2018–19 season, Atalanta achieved many positive results and finished third in Serie A, its best ever league finish; with this result, the club qualified for the UEFA Champions League group stage for the first time in its history. Atalanta also reached the Coppa Italia final, though lost 2–0 to Lazio.

In the 2019–20 season, Atalanta lost its first three Champions League matches, but went on to qualify for the round of 16. Atalanta then defeated Spanish club Valencia in both legs of the round of 16, reaching the quarterfinals, where it would be eliminated by French champion Paris Saint-Germain. The club also repeated its third-place finish in Serie A and achieved a second consecutive Champions League qualification, breaking several club records. In the 2020–21 season, Atalanta reached the round of 16 in the Champions League for the second time, following an away victory over Ajax. The later secured Champions League qualification and third place in Serie A for the third consecutive time, and reached the Coppa Italia final for the second time in three years, though lost 2–1 to Juventus.

On 19 February 2022, a US-based consortium led by Stephen Pagliuca acquired a 55% stake of La Dea srl, the controlling company of Atalanta, previously wholly owned by the Percassi family. Under the new agreement, Pagliuca was named co-chairman, with Antonio Percassi staying on as chairman. Atalanta finished eighth in Serie A in 2022, failing to qualify for European competitions, though rebounded the next season with a fifth-place finish in Serie A and qualification to the Europa League. On 4 August 2023, Atalanta established a reserve team in Serie C, becoming the second Italian club to do so. In the 2023–24 season, Atalanta reached the 2024 Coppa Italia final, losing to Juventus 1–0, and made its debut appearance in a European final, the UEFA Europa League final. In that match, the team defeated Bayer Leverkusen 3–0, thanks to a hat-trick by Ademola Lookman, to claim its first trophy since 1963; this was the first time an Italian club won the competition since it changed the name and format. In addition, Atalanta qualified for the 2024–25 UEFA Champions League after a three-year absence from the competition.

==Colours, kits, and crest==

=== Colours and kits ===
The first kits adopted by Atalanta after its founding featured thin black and white vertical stripes. These were Atalanta&#x27;s colours until 1920, when the club merged with local rival Bergamasca (which had blue and white kits) in order to compete in the Italian league. Following the merger, the common colour white was eliminated, leaving black and blue (&quot;nerazzurri&quot;) as the colours of the newly-formed Atalanta Bergamasca Calcio. In the first years following this merger, the club&#x27;s kits featured black and blue quarters. Atalanta adopted its classic black and blue vertical stripes several years later.

Atalanta&#x27;s home kits have characteristically had black and blue vertical stripes since their adoption in the 1920s. Slight variations in thickness of the stripes have existed over the years, though the club never strayed far from the classic design for its home kits. Atalanta&#x27;s away kits have traditionally been mostly white, with various touches of black and blue and other details. The club&#x27;s third kits and goalkeeper kits have not historically adhered to any strict pattern; many colours (among them green, red, light blue, and black) have been used for these over the years.

Since 2010, Atalanta plays its final home match of the calendar year, a &quot;Christmas Match&quot;, in specially designed kits. The kits are then auctioned to raise money for charity.

====Kit suppliers and shirt sponsors====
===Crest===
Atalanta has had five crests since its foundation, all of which depict some combination of the team&#x27;s name (except between 1984 and 1993), colours, and (since 1963) the Greek mythological athlete Atalanta, from whom the club derives its name as well as its nickname &quot;La Dea&quot;.The club&#x27;s first three crests were shields featuring the name Atalanta on top, coloured stripes on the left, and another symbolic representation on the right. The original crest dates back to 1907 and had the club&#x27;s original black and white stripes alongside a blue patch. In 1963, after the club won the Coppa Italia, the crest was redesigned to feature black and blue stripes alongside a running girl representing Atalanta. The crest&#x27;s colours and representation of Atalanta changed again in the 1970s, though followed the same basic shape as the 1963 version.

In 1984, the crest underwent a major redesign: the club&#x27;s name and the running girl&#x27;s body were removed from the crest and its shape was changed from a shield to a circle. This &quot;classic&quot; crest featured a white silhouette of Atalanta&#x27;s head on a black and blue background, enclosed in three concentric white, black, and golden yellow circles. Black, blue, and white were retained—as the club&#x27;s colours—while yellow was added to represent the golden apples, which according to mythology, Hippomenes tossed to Atalanta to distract her and defeat her in a footrace.

The club&#x27;s modern crest was designed in 1993. It incorporates the 1984 crest into its design, though tilts Atalanta&#x27;s head and lacks the yellow circle. The name Atalanta and founding year 1907 were added respectively above and below the circle, which is enclosed in an ellipse featuring the same split black and blue background as the 1984 design.

==Stadium==

Atalanta has played at its current stadium, the 24,950-seater Gewiss Stadium in the Borgo Santa Caterina neighborhood of Bergamo, since 1928. Prior to its opening, Atalanta played at several other grounds in Bergamo. Between its founding in 1907 and recognition by the FIGC in 1914, the club did not have a dedicated playing field and only played friendly matches in public spaces—the Piazza d&#x27;Armi and the Campo di Marte in Bergamo. In 1914, Atalanta&#x27;s first playing field was established on the Via Maglio del Lotto, near the Bergamo–Milan railway. It measured and had a seated capacity of 1,000 spectators. Due to financial hardship during World War I, though, Atalanta was forced to sell the land containing its field, leaving it without a home ground. As a solution, entrepreneur and philanthropist Betty Ambiveri sold the Clementina field, an older venue in Seriate that hosted sporting events such as cycling, to the club. The new field was inaugurated as the &quot;Atalanta Stadium&quot; and it hosted 14,000 spectators in its first match against &quot;La Dominante&quot; of Genoa.

With the growth of football in the 1920s, Atalanta needed a new stadium. The new stadium was constructed on Viale Margherita (now Viale Giulio Cesare), replacing a hippodrome that once occupied the site. Construction of the new stadium took one year; it opened in 1928 and cost 3.5 million lire. The stadium was named after fascist Mario Brumana; this was common naming practice in fascist Italy. The Brumana stadium was much larger than the Clementina field, having a seated capacity of 12,000 spectators in two &quot;tribune&quot; (side stands) and a larger field measuring ; it also featured a running track, as it was planned to form part of a larger complex. On 1 November 1928, Atalanta played its first unofficial match at the stadium (a 4–2 victory against Triestina); the stadium was then officially inaugurated on 23 December 1928, when Atalanta defeated &quot;La Dominante Genova&quot; 2–0 in front of over 14,000 spectators.
After World War II, the stadium was renamed the &quot;Stadio Comunale&quot; (&quot;Municipal Stadium&quot;), as fascism no longer existed in Italy. Expansion of the stadium began in the years following the war: the construction of a south stand (the &quot;Curva Sud&quot;) began in 1949, and a second stand at the north end (the &quot;Curva Nord&quot;) followed during the 1960s, opening in 1971. Later, in 1984, the running track was removed in order to expand the stadium&#x27;s capacity upon Atalanta&#x27;s return to Serie A after five years. The club&#x27;s first match in the 1984–85 Serie A, a 1–1 draw against Inter, had an attendance of over 43,000 spectators, a record attendance for the Stadio Comunale.

The &quot;Tribuna Giulio Cesare&quot; underwent modernization during the early 1990s, and the stadium was renamed the &quot;Stadio Atleti Azzurri d&#x27;Italia&quot; (&quot;Blue Athletes of Italy&quot;) in 1994. In 1997, following the death of 22-year-old forward Federico Pisani in a car accident, the &quot;Curva Nord&quot; was nicknamed the &quot;Curva Pisani&quot; in his honor. Similarly, the &quot;Curva Sud&quot; was nicknamed the &quot;Curva Morosini&quot; in 2012 to posthumously honor 25-year-old youth academy player Piermario Morosini, who died following collapse on the field during a Serie B match between Pescara and Livorno. In 2015, the stadium also expanded its side stands to offer pitchside views only several meters (feet) from the benches, a revolutionary feature of Italian stadiums at the time.

On 10 May 2017, Atalanta announced the acquisition of the stadium from the &quot;comune&quot; for 8.6 million euros, becoming one of only four Serie A clubs to own its home stadium. This acquisition allowed the club to authorize a renovation project for the stadium, for like many Italian stadiums, much of its structure and facilities were considered outdated. This renovation project was also necessary to upgrade the stadium to meet UEFA standards for hosting matches in UEFA competitions. Because the stadium was not ready at the time, Atalanta had to play its Europa League home matches at the Mapei Stadium in Reggio Emilia and its Champions League home matches in its debut season at San Siro in Milan.

Following a sponsorship agreement with electronics company Gewiss lasting at least until 2025, the stadium was renamed the Gewiss Stadium on 1 July 2019. On 6 October 2019, the renovated &quot;Curva Nord&quot; was inaugurated for Atalanta&#x27;s home match against Lecce; it has covered seating for over 9,000 spectators. A year later, both side stands underwent modernization and the &quot;Curva Sud&quot; had temporary seats installed on the concrete. These upgrades allowed Atalanta to play its Champions League matches in Bergamo starting in the 2020–21 season. The final phase will feature a rebuilt &quot;Curva Sud&quot; (mirroring the rebuilt &quot;Curva Nord&quot;), which will increase the stadium&#x27;s capacity to about 25,000, as well as construction of a new underground parking garage and other improvements to the stadium&#x27;s surroundings. It was originally expected to be completed in 2021, though following several delays, the start of construction its completion is expected by August 2024, with demolition of the &quot;Curva Sud&quot; beginning in June 2023. Atalanta will still be able to play its home matches at the Gewiss Stadium during construction, though the stadium will have a capacity of 3,500 fewer spectators.

The stadium in Bergamo has also been used as a home ground by local Serie C club AlbinoLeffe from 2003 to 2019 (when it moved to Gorgonzola), a period during which AlbinoLeffe spent nine years in Serie B and met Atalanta on several occasions. On occasion, Atalanta&#x27;s youth team also plays competitive matches at the Gewiss Stadium, most recently the Supercoppa Primavera in 2021.

===Training ground===
Atalanta trains at the Centro Sportivo Bortolotti in , a complex first constructed during the community&#x27;s development in the 1960s, before being acquired for Atalanta by president Achille Bortolotti and inaugurated in 1977. The complex is used by the senior team for training and some friendlies, and the youth teams for training and home matches in youth competitions such as the Campionato Primavera 1. Atalanta&#x27;s renowned youth academy (&quot;Scuola di Calcio&quot;; see below) is also based in Zingonia, and has been a continuous point of investment for the club since its establishment.

==Supporters==

, Atalanta is the 9th-most supported club in Italy, with an estimated 314,000 supporters. Although Atalanta supporters are vastly outnumbered in Italy by fans of more titled clubs, the club&#x27;s performances in recent years have drawn additional support, especially among younger generations. An increase of 43% was reported since 2019, peaking at about 350,000 in 2021, and decreasing by 10% after the club failed to qualify for European competitions in 2022. The club has also worked to grow its fanbase with the &quot;Neonati Atalantini&quot; initiative, implemented in 2010 by president Percassi, which gifts a free Atalanta replica shirt to all newborns born within the city limits of Bergamo. , over 36,000 shirts have been distributed; similar programs have been more recently adopted by other Italian clubs as well.

Most of the club&#x27;s fans reside within the Province of Bergamo; conversely, there are very strong ties between Atalanta and Bergamo&#x27;s residents, who often gather together in close-knit groups in support of the club. Atalanta supporters (&quot;tifosi&quot;) are considered to be among the most passionate and loyal fans in Italy. Atalanta&#x27;s Ultras gather mostly in the &quot;Curva Nord&quot; as the unified group Curva Nord 1907, formed from members of various Ultras groups under the leadership of Claudio &quot;Il Bocia&quot; Galimberti during the early 2000s. The &quot;Curva Nord&quot; Ultras were historically leftist but are now apolitical. A separate Ultras group, Forever Atalanta, gathers in the &quot;Curva Sud&quot;, and is believed to still be leftist. Atalanta Ultras have a reputation as one of the most violent Ultras groups in Italy, self-describing as &quot;we hate everybody&quot;, and indeed having few friends and many strong rivalries. The club and its Ultras have been punished on multiple occasions by the Italian Football League for violent or racist conduct.
On match days, the &quot;Curva Nord&quot; often features flares, fireworks, and choreography, and sometimes is covered by a large black-and-blue striped flag (see image). During the 2018–19 season, Atalanta matches had an average home attendance of 18,248, of whom an estimated 15,676 were season ticket holders.

Since 2002, Atalanta supporters have organized &quot;La Festa della Dea&quot; (the Festival of the Goddess), a multi-day festival to celebrate the club, almost every summer. The celebration features music, local cuisine, and reverence for the club&#x27;s history, management, and players (both former and current players). Some contemporary players and coaches also have appeared at the celebration, most recently in 2018.
===Friendships and rivalries===
Atalanta supporters have a long-standing friendship (&quot;gemellaggio&quot;; twinning) with supporters of Ternana. The friendship between the two clubs&#x27; supporters is one of the oldest and strongest in Italy, persevering since the 1980s. Historically, both clubs&#x27; Ultras were brought together by shared political views, and they frequently visit the other club&#x27;s &quot;Curva&quot;. Supporters of the club also have a historical twinning with supporters of German club Eintracht Frankfurt, a friendship similarly rooted in shared political views. There are also friendly relations between fans of Atalanta and fans of Spezia (since Atalanta&#x27;s run in the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup in 1988), Cosenza, Cavese, and Austrian club Wacker Innsbruck.

Atalanta supporters share their most intense with supporters of nearby club Brescia. Meetings between the two clubs are sometimes known as the &quot;Derby Lombardo&quot; (Lombard Derby). This rivalry has its roots in a historical feud between Bergamo and Brescia dating back to the Middle Ages, beginning in 1126 when Bergamo expanded its territory by acquiring land put up for sale by Brescia; this led to a series of territorial disputes and armed conflicts between the two cities, among them the Battle of Cortenuova in 1237. Although armed conflict eventually ended and both cities were unified under the Kingdom of Italy in 1861, the cities&#x27; historical rivalry has defined the atmosphere of matches between Atalanta and Brescia for the entirety of the clubs&#x27; history. In 1993, tension between the clubs&#x27; supporters escalated further following a match (won 2–0 by Brescia) that was suspended three times due to violence in the stands, which resulted in over 20 spectators being hospitalized.

Since at least 1977, a heartfelt rivalry has existed between fans of Atalanta and Torino. There have been various altercations between the clubs&#x27; Ultras during matches between the clubs, though some fans share a mutual respect or consider each other &quot;respected enemies&quot;. The Atalanta–Torino rivalry also gave rise to a short-lived friendship (lasting until the early 1980s) between supporters of Atalanta and Juventus—Torino&#x27;s city rival—though Atalanta supporters now also consider Juventus a hated rival. In addition to Juventus, there are also strong rivalries between Atalanta and Italy&#x27;s other well-supported clubs: Roma, Milan, Inter, Napoli, and Lazio, and Fiorentina. The rivalry between Atalanta and Roma emerged in 1984 after once-friendly relations between the two clubs&#x27; Ultras deteriorated. Milan and Atalanta have had a long-standing rivalry fueled by the friendship between fans of Brescia and Milan as well as a controversial episode during a Coppa Italia match in 1990 that infuriated the Atalanta fans. Matches between Inter and Atalanta have seen violence among Ultras since the early 1970s, fueled by political differences as well as the clubs&#x27; shared black and blue colors. Atalanta&#x27;s rivalry with Lazio has been historically characterized by opposing political views—respectively far left against far right—though greatly intensified following Lazio&#x27;s Coppa Italia triumph over Atalanta in 2019. The rivalry between Atalanta and Fiorentina has intensified during Gian Piero Gasperini&#x27;s tenure as Atalanta manager (also corresponding to Atalanta&#x27;s qualification to European competitions); multiple tense episodes have occurred during and after matches between the two clubs. There are also strong rivalries between supporters of Atalanta and supporters of Bologna, Como (a regional rivalry since the 1980s), Genoa, Hellas Verona, Pisa, and Vicenza, as well as Croatian club Dinamo Zagreb.

==Managers==
Atalanta&#x27;s current manager (head coach) is Gian Piero Gasperini, who assumed the role on 14 June 2016. The club has had a total of 59 managers (including player-managers, assistants acting as head coach, and caretaker managers) since the club hired its first professional coach, Cesare Lovati, in 1925. Current manager Gasperini, who led the club to its highest league finishes and UEFA Champions League qualification between 2019 and 2021, has the most appearances as manager in the club&#x27;s history (387 ) and the longest uninterrupted tenure as Atalanta manager (seven consecutive seasons). The club&#x27;s second-longest-serving manager is Emiliano Mondonico, who oversaw 299 matches in all competitions—including a European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup and a UEFA Cup—in two spells (1987–90 and 1994–98). Stefano Colantuono, who also was manager on two different occasions (2005–07 and 2010–15), is the club&#x27;s third-longest serving manager, with 281 appearances in total.

===Presidential history===
Atalanta have had several presidents (chairmen) ( or ) over the course of their history. Some of them have been the main shareholder of the club. The longest-serving chairman is Ivan Ruggeri, who was relieved of his duties after he suffered a stroke in January 2008, being replaced by his son Alessandro who was named chairman of Atalanta in September 2008. Alessandro&#x27;s father was unable to manage the team due to the consequences of the stroke.
In June 2010, after another relegation to Serie B, Alessandro Ruggeri sold his share of the club to Antonio Percassi, who became the new chairman of Atalanta.

==Youth system==
The Atalanta youth system consists of four men&#x27;s teams that participate in separate national leagues (Primavera, Allievi Nazionali A and B, and Giovanissimi Nazionali) and two that participate at a regional level (Giovanissimi Regionali A and B).

The first person who was committed to set up the Atalanta youth teams was Giuseppe Ciatto. Every organisational aspect was dealt with and resolved by him, and he also took care to train the various teams. In 1949 Atalanta won the &quot;Campionato Ragazzi&quot;.

In the late 1950s former Atalanta player Luigi Tentorio (then Special Commissioner of the club) felt the need to start investing more systematically in youth: he decided to create a real youth sector, with its own independent structure from the first team. The youth sector was entrusted to Giuseppe Brolis, who created a partnership with various clubs in the Veneto and Friuli regions, building a network of scouts and young coaches.

A crucial step in the history of the Bergamo youth sector took place in the early 1990s when the president Antonio Percassi implemented a new investment policy, especially at the youth level. He managed to convince Fermo Favini to leave Como and entrusted him with the responsibility of the youth sector.

The Atalanta youth system not only continued to increase the production of players for the first team, but began to win several honours in the most important national leagues. From 1991 to 2014, the various youth teams have won 17 national titles.

Apart from successes at youth level, the Atalanta youth system is also one of the most highly regarded in Europe: according to a ranking by the study centre in Coverciano, Atalanta have the top youth system in Italy and the sixth in Europe, behind Real Madrid, Barcelona and three French teams. The parameters used were the number of first division players produced by the club. In the 2007–08 season, 22 players from Atalanta&#x27;s youth played in Serie A, 32 in Serie B and 3 abroad.

In 2014, a global study of the &quot;CIES Football Observatory&quot;, placed the Atalanta youth system eighth place in the world, with 25 former youth players who play in the top 5 European leagues.

On 4 August 2023, Atalanta established a reserve team in Serie C, becoming the second Italian club to do so.

<text>Wynton Learson Marsalis (born October 18, 1961) is an American trumpeter, composer, and music instructor, who is currently the artistic director of Jazz at Lincoln Center. He has been active in promoting classical and jazz music, often to young audiences. Marsalis has won nine Grammy Awards, and his oratorio &quot;Blood on the Fields&quot; was the first jazz composition to win the Pulitzer Prize for Music. Marsalis is the only musician to have won a Grammy Award in both jazz and classical categories in the same year.

==Early years==
Marsalis was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, on October 18, 1961, and grew up in the suburb of Kenner. He is the second of six sons born to Dolores Ferdinand Marsalis and Ellis Marsalis Jr., a pianist and music teacher. He was named after jazz pianist Wynton Kelly. Branford Marsalis is his older brother and Jason Marsalis and Delfeayo Marsalis are younger. All three are jazz musicians. While sitting at a table with trumpeters Al Hirt, Miles Davis, and Clark Terry, his father jokingly suggested that he might as well get Wynton a trumpet, too. Hirt volunteered to give him one, so at the age of six Marsalis received his first trumpet.

Although he owned a trumpet when he was six, he did not practice much until he was 12. He attended Benjamin Franklin High School and the New Orleans Center for Creative Arts. He studied classical music at school and jazz at home with his father. He played in funk bands and a marching band led by Danny Barker. He performed on trumpet publicly as the only black musician in the New Orleans Civic Orchestra. After winning a music contest at fourteen, he performed Joseph Haydn&#x27;s trumpet concerto with the New Orleans Philharmonic. Two years later he performed Brandenburg Concerto No. 2 in F Major by Bach. At seventeen, he was one of the youngest musicians admitted to Tanglewood Music Center. Marsalis applied to only two music colleges, the Juilliard School and Northwestern University. He was accepted to both schools and chose to attend the former.

==Career==

In 1979, he moved to New York City to attend the Juilliard School for a Bachelor of Music in trumpet performance, leaving in 1981 without earning a degree. He intended to pursue a career in classical music. In 1980, he toured Europe as a member of the Art Blakey band, becoming a member of The Jazz Messengers and remaining with Blakey until 1982. He changed his mind about his career and turned to jazz. He has said that years of playing with Blakey influenced his decision. He recorded for the first time with Blakey and one year later he went on tour with Herbie Hancock. After signing a contract with Columbia, he recorded his first solo album. In 1982, he established a quintet with his brother Branford Marsalis, Kenny Kirkland, Charnett Moffett, and Jeff &quot;Tain&quot; Watts. When Branford and Kenny Kirkland left three years later to record and tour with Sting, Marsalis formed another quartet, this time with Marcus Roberts on piano, Robert Hurst on double bass, and Watts on drums. After a while, the band expanded to include Wessell Anderson, Wycliffe Gordon, Eric Reed, Herlin Riley, Reginald Veal, and Todd Williams.

When asked about influences on his playing style, he cites Duke Ellington, Miles Davis, Harry Sweets Edison, Clark Terry, Dizzy Gillespie, Jelly Roll Morton, Charlie Parker, Wayne Shorter, Thelonious Monk, Cootie Williams, Ray Nance, Maurice André, and Adolph Hofner. Other influences include Clifford Brown, Freddie Hubbard, and Adolph Herseth.

Marsalis has established himself as a lecturer and musical ambassador, a &quot;21st-century Leonard Bernstein&quot; according to one writer.

==Jazz at Lincoln Center==

In 1987, Marsalis helped start the Classical Jazz summer concert series at Lincoln Center in New York City. The success of the series led to Jazz at Lincoln Center becoming a department at Lincoln Center, then to becoming an independent entity in 1996 alongside organizations such as the New York Philharmonic and the Metropolitan Opera. Marsalis became artistic director of the center and the musical director of the band, the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra. The orchestra performs at its home venue, Rose Hall, goes on tour, visits schools, appears on radio and television, and produces albums through its label, Blue Engine Records.

In 2011, Marsalis and rock guitarist Eric Clapton performed together in a Jazz at Lincoln Center concert. The concert was recorded and released as the album &quot;Play the Blues: Live from Jazz at Lincoln Center&quot;.

==Other work==
In 1995, he hosted the educational program &quot;Marsalis on Music&quot; on public television, while during the same year National Public Radio broadcast his series &quot;Making the Music&quot;. Both programs won the George Foster Peabody Award, the highest award given in journalism.

In 2005, Marsalis played at Apple&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s Showtime&quot; Special Event on October 12, where the new iMac with Front Row, and iPod with Video were introduced. Following this, Marsalis also appeared in an iPod TV ad with his song &quot;Sparks&quot; in 2006.

In December 2011, Marsalis was named cultural correspondent for &quot;CBS This Morning&quot;. He is a member of the CuriosityStream Advisory Board. He serves as director of the Juilliard Jazz Studies program. In 2015, Cornell University appointed him A.D. White Professor-at-Large.

Marsalis was involved in writing, arranging, and performing music for the 2019 Daniel Pritzker film &quot;Bolden&quot;.

In addition to Jazz at Lincoln Center, Marsalis has also worked with the Philadelphia Orchestra as a composer for modern classical music. The orchestra premiered a Violin Concerto he composed in 2015, and a Tuba Concerto of his in 2021.

==Debate on jazz==
Marsalis is generally associated with straight-ahead jazz, jazz that kept to the original instruments used in jazz and eschewed electronica that gained prominence in the 1970s and 1980s. In &quot;The Jazz Book&quot;, the authors list what Marsalis considers to be the fundamentals of jazz: blues, standards, a swing beat, tonality, harmony, craftsmanship, and mastery of the tradition beginning with New Orleans jazz up to Ornette Coleman. Tara Hall has written that Marsalis&#x27;s &quot;selective knowledge of jazz history (considering post-1965 avant-garde playing to be outside of jazz and 1970s fusion to be barren) is unfortunately influenced by the somewhat eccentric beliefs of Stanley Crouch.&quot;. In &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1997, pianist Keith Jarrett said Marsalis &quot;imitates other people&#x27;s styles too well ... His music sounds like a high school trumpet player to me&quot;.

Bassist Stanley Clarke said, &quot;All the guys that are criticizing—like Wynton Marsalis and those guys—I would hate to be around to hear those guys playing on top of a groove!&quot; But Clarke also said, &quot;These things I&#x27;ve said about Wynton are my criticism of him, but the positive things I have to say about him outweigh the negative. He has brought respectability back to jazz.&quot;

When he met Miles Davis, one of his idols, Davis said, &quot;So here&#x27;s the police ...&quot;. For his part, Marsalis compared Miles Davis&#x27;s embrace of rock and pop music (most notably in his 1970 album &quot;Bitches Brew&quot;) to &quot;a general who has betrayed his country.&quot; Marsalis has called rap &quot;hormone driven pop music&quot; and said that hip hop &quot;reinforces destructive behavior at home and influences the world&#x27;s view of the Afro American in a decidedly negative direction.&quot;

Marsalis responded to criticism by saying, &quot;You can&#x27;t enter a battle and expect not to get hurt.&quot; He has said that losing the freedom to criticize is &quot;to accept mob rule, it is a step back towards slavery.&quot;

==Personal life==
Marsalis is the son of the late jazz musician Ellis Marsalis Jr. (pianist), grandson of Ellis Marsalis Sr., and brother of Branford (saxophonist), Delfeayo (trombonist and producer), and Jason (drummer). Marsalis&#x27;s son, Jasper Armstrong Marsalis, is a music producer known professionally as Slauson Malone 1.

Marsalis was raised Catholic.

==Awards and honors==
In 1983, at the age of 22, he became the only musician to win Grammy Awards in jazz and classical music during the same year. At the award ceremonies the next year, he won again in both categories.

After his first album came out in 1982, Marsalis won polls in &quot;DownBeat&quot; magazine for Musician of the Year, Best Trumpeter, and Album of the Year. In 2017, he was one of the youngest members to be inducted into the &quot;DownBeat&quot; Hall of Fame.

In 1997, he became the first jazz musician to win the Pulitzer Prize for Music for his oratorio &quot;Blood on the Fields&quot;. In a note to him, Zarin Mehta wrote, &quot;I was not surprised at your winning the Pulitzer Prize for &quot;Blood on the Fields&quot;. It is a broad, beautifully painted canvas that impresses and inspires. It speaks to us all...I&#x27;m sure that, somewhere in the firmament, Buddy Bolden, Louis Armstrong and legions of others are smiling down on you.&quot;

Wynton Marsalis has won the National Medal of Arts, the National Humanities Medal, and been named an NEA Jazz Master. In 2001, he was also named a UN Messenger of Peace.

Approximately seven million copies of his recordings have been sold worldwide. He has toured in 30 countries and on every continent except Antarctica.

He was given the Louis Armstrong Memorial Medal and the Algur H. Meadows Award for Excellence in the Arts. He was inducted into the American Academy of Achievement and was dubbed an Honorary Dreamer by the I Have a Dream Foundation. The New York Urban League awarded Marsalis the Frederick Douglass Medallion for distinguished leadership. The American Arts Council presented him with the Arts Education Award.

He won the Dutch Edison Award and the French Grand Prix du Disque. The Mayor of Vitoria, Spain, gave him the city&#x27;s gold medal, its most coveted distinction. In 1996, Britain&#x27;s senior conservatoire, the Royal Academy of Music, made him an honorary member, the academy&#x27;s highest decoration for a non-British citizen. The city of Marciac, France, erected a bronze statue in his honor for the key role he played in the story of the festival. The French Ministry of Culture gave him the rank of Knight in the Order of Arts and Literature. In 2008, he received France&#x27;s highest distinction, the insignia Chevalier of the Legion of Honour. In 2023, he won the Praemium Imperiale.

He has received honorary degrees from the Frost School of Music at the University of Miami (1994), University of Scranton (1996), Kenyon College (2019), New York University, Columbia, Connecticut College, Harvard, Howard, Northwestern, Princeton, Vermont, the State University of New York, and the University of Michigan (2023).

<text>The Fatback Band (later, simply Fatback) is an American funk and disco band that was popular in the 1970s and 1980s. The Fatback Band is most known for their R&amp;B hits: &quot;(Do the) Spanish Hustle&quot;, &quot;I Like Girls&quot;, &quot;Gotta Get My Hands on Some (Money)&quot;, &quot;Backstrokin&#x27;&quot; and &quot;I Found Lovin&#x27;&quot;.

Their 1979 single &quot;King Tim III (Personality Jock)&quot; is generally considered the first commercially released hip hop single.

==History==
Formed in New York City in 1970, the Fatback Band was the concept of Bill Curtis, an experienced session drummer, inspired to merge the &quot;fatback&quot; jazz beat of New Orleans into a funk band. In addition to Curtis, the band&#x27;s initial line-up included guitarist Johnny King, bassist Johnny Flippin, trumpet player George Williams, saxophonist Earl Shelton, flautist George Adams, and keyboardist Gerry Thomas. The band specialized in playing &quot;street funk&quot;. The group also later included conga player Wayne Woolford, vocalists Jayne and Gerry, Deborah Cooper saxophonist Fred Demerey, guitarist Louis Wright and George Victory.

The Fatback Band signed to Perception Records and had a hit single that summer with &quot;Street Dance&quot;. The single reached the top 30 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B chart, but failed to cross over to the Pop chart, a pattern the group would follow for the rest of their career. The band released the albums &quot;Let&#x27;s Do It Again&quot;, &quot;People Music&quot;, and &quot;Feel My Soul&quot; before signing to Event Records in 1974.

In the mid-1970s, the band incorporated jazz elements and moved more towards a disco sound resulting in the singles, &quot;Keep On Steppin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;Yum, Yum (Give Me Some)&quot;, and &quot;(Are You Ready) Do the Bus Stop&quot;. The singles proved popular in dance clubs, but did not do as well on the R&amp;B chart until the spring of 1976 when &quot;(Do The) Spanish Hustle&quot; came close to the top ten.

Now recording for Spring/Polydor, the group continued with the singles &quot;Party Time&quot;, &quot;The Booty&quot;, and &quot;Double Dutch&quot;. Late 1977 brought a name change to Fatback, and in 1978 they found their first top ten single with &quot;I Like Girls&quot;. The song &quot;King Tim III (Personality Jock)&quot; is often considered to be the first commercially released rap single, having shipped just a week before the Sugarhill Gang&#x27;s &quot;Rapper&#x27;s Delight&quot; in October 1979.

In 1980, Fatback had a pair of their biggest hits with &quot;Gotta Get My Hands on Some (Money)&quot; and &quot;Backstrokin&#x27;&quot;. Also finding the charts in the 1980s were &quot;Take It Any Way You Want It&quot;, &quot;I Found Lovin&#x27;&quot; and &quot;Spread Love&quot;, with singer Evelyn Thomas, in 1985. Whilst American pop success proved elusive, the group made regular appearances on the UK Singles Chart, including the top ten twice with &quot;(Do The) Spanish Hustle&quot; and &quot;I Found Lovin&#x27;&quot;; the latter also covered by British disc jockey Steve Walsh, reached the top ten at the same time as the original version.

Keyboardist Gerry Thomas was simultaneously a member of the Jimmy Castor Bunch, so the band elected to remain close to the New York area instead of extensive touring. They had substantial success in UK. As recent as 2019, the Fatback Band performed at multiple concerts and festivals in London and other cities in England. Their 2020 tour was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. They have a new album to be released in 2021 and have performances scheduled in July 2021.
