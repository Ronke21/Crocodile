<text>Eric Daniel Pierre Cantona (; ; born 24 May 1966) is a French actor and former professional footballer. A large, physically strong, hard-working and tenacious player, Cantona combined technical skill and creativity with power and goalscoring ability. Mostly utilised as a deep-lying forward, he was also capable of playing as a centre-forward, as an out-and-out striker, as an attacking midfielder, or as a central midfielder. In 2004, he was named by Pelé in the FIFA 100 list of the world&#x27;s greatest living players.

Cantona played for Auxerre, Martigues, Marseille, Bordeaux, Montpellier, Nîmes and Leeds United, before ending his career at Manchester United, with whom he won four Premier League titles in five years, including two League and FA Cup Doubles. He wore the iconic number 7 shirt at Manchester United and was known for turning up his collar. He is affectionately nicknamed &quot;King Eric&quot; by Manchester United fans. Cantona won league championships in England and France in seven of his last eight full seasons as a professional, and at least one trophy in eight of his last nine. At international level, he played for the France national team and scored 20 goals in 45 matches. He appeared at UEFA Euro 1992 and, in preparation for Euro 96, was appointed captain.

In 2003, Cantona was voted as Manchester United&#x27;s greatest-ever player by &quot;Inside United&quot; magazine. He was an inaugural inductee into the English Football Hall of Fame in 2002. At the Premier League 10 Seasons Awards in 2003, he was voted the Overseas Player of the Decade. Cantona was inducted into the Premier League Hall of Fame in 2021. Charismatic and outspoken, Cantona&#x27;s achievements in football were set against fallings out with coaches and team-mates, and a poor disciplinary record throughout his career, including a 1995 conviction for an assault on an abusive spectator, for which he received a two-week prison sentence, reduced to community service on appeal, and an eight-month suspension from football.

In 1997, Cantona unexpectedly announced his retirement from football at the age of 30. He pursued a career in cinema and had roles in the 1998 film &quot;Elizabeth&quot;, starring Cate Blanchett; the 2008 film &quot;French Film&quot;; and the 2009 film &quot;Looking for Eric&quot;. In 2010, he debuted as a stage actor in &quot;Face au Paradis&quot;, a play directed by his wife, Rachida Brakni. Cantona took an interest in the sport of beach soccer; as player-manager of the France national beach soccer team, he won the 2005 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup.

==Early life==
Cantona was born in Marseille on 24 May 1966, the son of dressmaker Éléonore Raurich, and nurse and painter Albert Cantona. His mother was Spanish and came from Barcelona, while his paternal grandfather was Italian and had emigrated to Marseille from Ozieri in Sardinia. While fighting the armies of General Franco in the Spanish Civil War in 1938, Cantona&#x27;s maternal grandfather, Pere Raurich, suffered a serious injury to his liver and had to retreat to France for medical treatment with his wife. They stayed in Saint-Priest, Ardèche, before settling in Marseille.

The Cantona family home was a cave in one of the hills in the Les Caillols area of Marseille, between the city&#x27;s 11th and 12th arrondissements, and it was rumoured to have been used as a lookout post for the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; towards the end of the Second World War. The site was chosen in the mid-1950s by Cantona&#x27;s paternal grandmother, whose husband was a stonemason. By the time Cantona was born in 1966, the hillside cave had become little more than a room in the family&#x27;s house, which was now up to a habitable standard. Cantona has two brothers: Jean-Marie, who is four years older, and Joël, who is 17 months younger.

==Club career==
===Early career===
Cantona began his football career with SO Caillolais, his local team and one that had produced such talent as Roger Jouve and had players such as Jean Tigana and Christophe Galtier within its ranks. Originally, Cantona began to follow in his father&#x27;s footsteps and often played as a goalkeeper, but his creative instincts began to take over and he would play up front more and more often. In his time with SO Caillolais, Cantona played in more than 200 matches.

===Auxerre===
Cantona&#x27;s first professional club was Auxerre, where he spent two years in the youth team before making his debut on 5 November 1983, in a 4–0 league victory over Nancy. In 1984 his footballing career was put on hold as he carried out his national service. On 14 May 1985, Cantona scored his first goal for Auxerre, scoring an open goal to put his team 2–0 up against Rouen in an important match to put pressure on AS Monaco. On the final matchday of the season, Auxerre played Strasbourg, with Auxerre needing one point to secure qualification for the following seasons&#x27; UEFA Cup; 1–0 down at half-time, Cantona scored the equalising goal from 25 yards out and showed his talent to a wider audience for the first time. After his discharge he was loaned out to Martigues in the French Second Division before rejoining Auxerre and signing a professional contract in 1986. His performances in the First Division earned him his first full international cap.

The following year, Cantona was again in trouble because of a dangerous kung-fu tackle on Nantes player Michel Der Zakarian, resulting in a three-month suspension, this was later reduced to a two-month suspension as his club Auxerre threatened to make the player unavailable for selection in the national team. He was part of the France under-21 side that won the 1988 U21 European Championship, scoring a hat-trick in a quarter-final against the England under-21 side, and shortly after he transferred to Marseille for a French record fee (FF22m). Cantona had grown up as a Marseille fan.

===Marseille===
In January 1989 during a friendly game against Torpedo Moscow he kicked the ball at the crowd, then ripped off and threw away his shirt after being substituted. His club responded by banning him for a month. Just a few months earlier, he had been banned from international matches for one year after insulting the national coach Henri Michel on TV.

====Loans to Bordeaux and Montpellier====

Having struggled to settle at Marseille, Cantona moved to Bordeaux on a six-month loan and then to Montpellier on a year-long loan. At Montpellier, he was involved in a fight with team-mate Jean-Claude Lemoult and threw his boots in Lemoult&#x27;s face. The incident led to six players demanding that Cantona be sacked, but with the support of team-mates such as Laurent Blanc and Carlos Valderrama, the club retained his services, although they banned him from the ground for ten days. Cantona was instrumental as the team went on to win the French Cup and his form persuaded Marseille to take him back.

====Return to Marseille, transfer to Nîmes====
Back at Marseille, Cantona initially played well under coach Gerard Gili and his successor Franz Beckenbauer. However, the Marseille chairman Bernard Tapie was not satisfied with the results and replaced Beckenbauer with Raymond Goethals; Cantona was continually at odds with Goethals and Tapie and, despite helping the team win the French Division 1 title, he was transferred to Nîmes the following season, for a fee of 10 million francs, signing a three-year contract.

In December 1991, during a match for Nîmes, he threw the ball at the referee, having been angered by one of his decisions. He was summoned to a disciplinary hearing by the French Football Federation and was banned for one month. Cantona responded by walking up to members of the hearing committee in turn and calling each of them an &quot;idiot&quot;. His ban was increased to two months and Cantona subsequently announced his retirement from football on 16 December 1991. The France national team coach, Michel Platini, was a fan of Cantona and persuaded him to make a comeback. On the advice of Gérard Houllier as well as his psychoanalyst, he moved to England to restart his career: &quot;He [my psychoanalyst] advised me not to sign for Marseille and recommended that I should go to England.&quot;

====Departure and move to England====
On 6 November 1991, after Liverpool&#x27;s 3–0 victory over Auxerre in a UEFA Cup second round, second leg tie at Anfield, Liverpool manager Graeme Souness was met by Frenchman Michel Platini at the end of the game, who told him that Cantona was available for sale to Liverpool. Souness thanked Platini, but declined the offer, citing dressing room harmony as his reason. After being turned down by Liverpool, Cantona was given a trial at Sheffield Wednesday when Wednesday manager Trevor Francis was approached by Platini and Francis&#x27; former agent, Dennis Roach. In a 2012 interview Francis explained that he had agreed to take Cantona on as a favour to Roach and Platini, who he knew from his time playing in Italy, and that it was intended as an opportunity for Cantona to put himself in the &quot;shop window&quot;: Wednesday had only recently been promoted back to the top flight, with most of the squad still being on Second Division-level wages, and the club could not afford to sign him. Cantona spent two days with Wednesday, training and playing in an indoor tournament at Sheffield Arena.

===Leeds United===
====1991–92 season====
Cantona&#x27;s arrival at Leeds United was announced in January 1992. Leeds would pay £100,000 to Nîmes to take him on loan until 15 April, after which they would have to pay another £900,000 to sign him permanently. Cantona made his debut for Leeds in a 2–0 loss at Oldham Athletic on 8 February 1992. At Leeds, he was part of the team that won the final Football League First Division title before it was replaced by the Premier League as the top division in English football. He made 15 appearances, and despite only scoring three goals, he was instrumental in their title success, primarily with assists for leading goalscorer Lee Chapman. Cantona scored his first goal for Leeds in a 2–0 win at home to Luton Town on 29 February and set up the other goal for Chapman. Having played little football in the six weeks before signing for Leeds, Cantona struggled to find a place in an established line-up, with manager Howard Wilkinson preferring to put him on against tiring defences. Against Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane on 7 March, Cantona came off the bench to set up a goal for Gary McAllister, securing a win that moved Leeds two points ahead of Manchester United, who had a game in hand, in the title race. Cantona was deployed as a part of a front three, along with Chapman and Rod Wallace, in a 5–1 thrashing of Wimbledon at Elland Road on 14 March, scoring Leeds&#x27; fourth goal of the game.

Leeds&#x27; title ambitions survived the difficult tests of Arsenal at Highbury (a 1–1 draw with Cantona denied a late winner by David Seaman) and West Ham (a 0–0 draw with Cantona being denied a first-half goal through a dubious offside decision); however, they lost 4–0 to Manchester City on 4 April at Maine Road, allowing Manchester United to take pole position in the title race again. Against Chelsea on 11 April, Cantona came on for Wallace with 20 minutes to go and Leeds leading 1–0; he then set up Chapman&#x27;s 20th goal of the season before rounding off the scoring with a lob over Chelsea defender Paul Elliott. Two days later, Wilkinson announced that Leeds intended to complete Cantona&#x27;s transfer from Nîmes for £900,000. Cantona was paid a generous £7,000 a week, a huge cost in an era without television or European football revenue. Starting with that Chelsea match, Leeds went unbeaten in their final five games, securing the league title on the penultimate weekend with a 3–2 win over Sheffield United after Manchester United had lost to Liverpool.

====1992–93 season====
In the 1992 FA Charity Shield that August, with Leeds missing several key players, Cantona scored a hat-trick in a 4–3 victory over Liverpool, the first hat-trick in the Charity Shield since Tommy Taylor in 1957. Cantona&#x27;s hat-trick places him among the small group of players to have scored three or more goals in games at Wembley Stadium. Leeds started their title defence with a 2–1 win over Wimbledon on 15 August; Cantona started alongside Chapman up front, but had a quiet game, although he did pick up his first yellow card in English football, after 17 games. After Cantona scored his first league goal of the season in a 4–1 defeat at Middlesbrough and followed it up with another hat-trick, the first in the newly created Premier League in a 5–0 win over Tottenham on 25 August. Cantona then flew to Paris to join the France national team for a friendly against Brazil on the very same day, due to newly installed manager Gérard Houllier&#x27;s desire to have the whole squad present for his first match.

Leeds slipped towards mid-table with a pair of 2–2 draws despite excellent performances by Cantona, drawing two excellent saves from a young David James against fellow title challengers Liverpool on 29 August and scoring a brace against Oldham Athletic three days later. Leeds then fell 2–0 to Manchester United at Old Trafford on 6 September, with Cantona coming off the bench and nearly scoring with a bicycle kick. Leeds&#x27; first foray into the European Cup since 1974–75 started poorly with a 3–0 defeat at Stuttgart on 16 September; Cantona, struggling with a hamstring injury, had a pass intercepted that led to Stuttgart&#x27;s opening goal, exacerbating a growing rift with manager Wilkinson. Cantona missed the next two games, a 1–1 draw at Southampton and a 4–1 win over Scunthorpe United in the League Cup, through injury but returned immediately to help Leeds win their first league game in six, a 2–0 victory over Everton on 26 September.

Four days later, Leeds faced Stuttgart in the return leg of the European Cup. Dubbed the &#x27;Mission Impossible&#x27;, Cantona and Gordon Strachan combined to set up Gary Speed, who scored with a left-footed volley. Andreas Buck equalised for Stuttgart in the 34th minute, the away goal meaning that Leeds needed another four to progress. McAllister scored a penalty just before half-time to make it 2–1 to Leeds before Cantona&#x27;s looping shot in the 66th minute was deflected into his own net by Günther Schäfer. Chapman&#x27;s header at the near post made it 4–1 in the 78th minute but Stuttgart remained firm and denied Leeds the decisive fifth goal. However, Leeds received a stroke of luck when it emerged after the match that Stuttgart&#x27;s coach, Christoph Daum, had fielded four &#x27;foreign&#x27; players, one more than allowed. Leeds were awarded a 3–0 victory by UEFA and a play-off match was ordered at the neutral Camp Nou in Barcelona on 9 October.

An exhausted Leeds then stumbled to a 4–2 defeat at Ipswich Town, with Cantona&#x27;s form dipping through fatigue and injury. He had a poor game as Leeds won the play-off against Stuttgart 2–1. A return to national duty then saw Cantona and Jean-Pierre Papin score in a 2–0 victory over Austria. He brought his revived form back to England, helping in a 3–1 victory against Sheffield United in October. This game would, however, be Cantona&#x27;s last win while with Leeds.

Leeds were drawn against Rangers in the European Cup, a tie billed as &#x27;The Battle of Britain&#x27; by the press. Despite McAllister&#x27;s first-minute goal, Cantona and Leeds struggled and fell 2–1 amid a hostile Ibrox crowd. Cantona walked straight to the dressing room after being substituted, which was interpreted by Wilkinson as disrespectful to the other players. Leeds also lost the return leg 2–1, Rangers scoring through Mark Hateley and Ally McCoist, before Cantona scored a late consolation goal. In between the two games, Cantona was an unused substitute when Leeds travelled to Queens Park Rangers as Wilkinson, favouring a more direct approach, found no room for him. Leeds lost 2–1, with Cantona leaving for France after being granted leave on the morning of the match. Wallace was preferred to start over Cantona in a fighting 2–2 draw at home to Coventry City. Managing just one win in four, Leeds&#x27; title defence had imploded in October, just as Arsenal&#x27;s had in the previous season.

Cantona did however start in the 4–0 defeat at Manchester City on 7 November, but put in a hapless performance along with the rest of the team. Cantona was then guilty of &quot;two dreadful misses&quot; as Watford knocked them out of the League Cup on 10 November. Despite suffering along with his team, Wilkinson, rather than Cantona, was held responsible, after having to reinvigorate a side with a number of ageing stars. Despite Cantona scoring (with his shoulder) for France against Finland four days later, Wilkinson kept him out of the team, citing an unconvincing excuse of a &quot;groin strain&quot;, as Leeds pulled off an improbable but resounding 3–0 win over Arsenal, ending the Gunners&#x27; six-game winning run. Furious at being dropped, Cantona refused to report for training and faxed a transfer request to the club on 24 November, stating a preference to join Manchester United, Liverpool or Arsenal.

===Manchester United===
====Transfer from Leeds United====
The news of Cantona&#x27;s impending transfer from Leeds to fierce rivals Manchester United was met with hostility from Leeds fans. The transfer was, however, seen as a good piece of business by most football pundits, removing a turbulent player from the team.

Cantona left Leeds for Manchester United for £1 million on 26 November 1992. Leeds chairman Bill Fotherby had telephoned Manchester United chairman Martin Edwards to enquire about the availability of Denis Irwin. Edwards was in a meeting with manager Alex Ferguson at the time and both agreed that Irwin was not for sale. Ferguson had identified that his team was in need of a striker, having recently made unsuccessful bids for David Hirst, Matt Le Tissier and Brian Deane, and instructed his chairman to ask whether Cantona was for sale. Fotherby had to consult with Wilkinson, but within a few days the deal was complete.

====1992–93 season====

Cantona had arrived too late to register to play in United&#x27;s 1–0 win at Arsenal on 28 November, but was in the crowd at Highbury as his new team secured a vital win. He made his first appearance for the club on 1 December 1992 in a friendly match against Benfica in Lisbon to mark Eusébio&#x27;s 50th birthday, wearing the number 10 shirt. He made his competitive debut as a second-half substitute against Manchester City at Old Trafford on 6 December. United won 2–1, though Cantona made little impact that day.
United&#x27;s season had been disappointing up to Cantona&#x27;s signing. They were falling behind the likes of big-spending Aston Villa and Blackburn Rovers in the race for the first Premier League title, as well as surprise challengers including Norwich City and Queens Park Rangers. Goalscoring had been a problem since the halfway point of the previous season – when it had cost them the league title as they suffered defeats or were held to draws at the hands of teams they had been expected to beat. Ferguson had first tried to sign Alan Shearer from Southampton during the 1992 close season, but lost out to Blackburn Rovers. He then spent £1 million on Dion Dublin, who suffered a broken leg a few games into the season and was out of action for six months. A £3 million bid for Sheffield Wednesday striker David Hirst was turned down and by 7 November, United were eighth in the Premier League.

Cantona quickly settled into the team, slotting in alongside Mark Hughes, while Brian McClair was switched to midfield. Cantona contributed greatly to a quick upturn in the team&#x27;s fortunes, not only scoring goals but also creating chances for the other players. His first United goal came in a 1–1 draw against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on 19 December 1992 and his second came on Boxing Day in a 3–3 draw against Sheffield Wednesday at Hillsborough, where they claimed a point after being 3–0 down by the hour mark. However, controversy was never far away and on his return to Elland Road to play Leeds a few weeks later, he spat at a fan and was fined £1,000 by The Football Association. United only lost twice in the league after Cantona&#x27;s arrival and finished the season 10 points clear at the top of the table, finishing as champions for the first time in 26 years, which made Cantona the first player to win consecutive English top-division titles with different clubs. He had won a domestic league title with different clubs for three successive seasons, having helped Marseille win the French league title in 1991.

====1993–94 season====

United retained the Premier League and Cantona&#x27;s two penalties helped them to a 4–0 win over Chelsea in the 1994 FA Cup Final. He also collected a runners-up medal in the Football League Cup, which the team lost 3–1 to Aston Villa. He was also voted PFA Player of the Year for that season and finished as United&#x27;s top scorer with 25 goals in all competitions; however, the season was not without its moments of controversy: Cantona was sent off as the team exited the Champions League against Galatasaray and was also dismissed in successive league games in March 1994, firstly against Swindon Town and then against Arsenal. The two successive red cards saw Cantona banned for five matches, including an FA Cup semi-final clash with Oldham Athletic, which United drew 1–1. Cantona was available for the replay and helped them win 4–1.

1993–94 was the first season of squad numbers in the Premier League. Cantona was issued with the number 7 shirt, a squad number he kept for the rest of his United career and that already had iconic status, having previously been worn by club legends including George Best and Bryan Robson; however, squad numbers were not set for the Champions League matches and Cantona wore the number 9 shirt in the four fixtures home and away against Kispest Honvéd and Galatasaray. On 19 December 1993, he scored two against Aston Villa, the previous season&#x27;s runners-up, in a 3–1 victory that put United 13 points clear at the top of the league. They extended their lead to 16 points soon after and eventually finished eight points ahead of runners-up Blackburn. Cantona was United&#x27;s top scorer with 26 goals in all competitions.

====1994–95 season, &#x27;kung-fu&#x27; incident and ban from football====
In the 1994–95 season, United looked to win a third successive league title, and for the first half of the season, things went smoothly enough for player and club. The season began with a 2–0 Wembley win over Blackburn in the Charity Shield, in which Cantona scored a penalty. Cantona frequently scored for Manchester United, who put intense pressure on a Blackburn side that led the table for much of the season, particularly with a 4–2 win at Ewood Park in late October, in which Cantona was on the scoresheet. He was also on the scoresheet in a memorable 5–0 derby win over Manchester City in November. On 22 January 1995, he scored the winning goal in a 1–0 home win over Blackburn that made the title race even tighter and brought Cantona&#x27;s tally of league goals for that season to 12. He scored a further goal in an FA Cup third round win at Sheffield United, and a second double was possible. The arrival of striker Andy Cole from Newcastle United on 10 January further boosted these hopes, even though Cole was cup-tied for FA Cup fixtures.

On 25 January 1995, he was involved in an incident that attracted headlines and controversy worldwide. In an away match against Crystal Palace, Cantona was sent off by the referee for kicking Palace defender Richard Shaw, after Shaw had frustrated Cantona throughout the game by closely marking him. As he was walking towards the tunnel, Cantona launched a &#x27;kung-fu&#x27; style kick into the crowd, directed at Palace supporter Matthew Simmons, who had run down 11 rows of stairs to confront and shout abuse at Cantona. Simmons was alleged to have used the words &quot;Fuck off back to France, you French bastard&quot;. Cantona followed the kick with a series of punches.

At a press conference called later, Cantona said, in a slow and deliberate manner:

Cantona then got up from his seat and abruptly left, leaving behind him a packed media room surprised and baffled – some roared with laughter – with those in the room trying to decipher his cryptic words.

Cantona was faced with a criminal charge of assault, which he admitted to on 23 March, resulting in a two-week prison sentence, although he was freed on bail pending an appeal. This was overturned in the appeal court a week later and instead he was sentenced to 120 hours of community service, which was spent coaching children at United&#x27;s training ground. The fan that Cantona kicked, Simmons, went on trial separately where he claimed that he only shouted &quot;Off! Off! Off! It&#x27;s an early bath for you, Mr Cantona!&quot;, but was found guilty of abusive behavior and handed a £500 fine and banned from the stadium for a year. Immediately after the verdict was proclaimed, Simmons then assaulted prosecutor Jeffrey McCann, for which he was sentenced to a week in jail, plus an additional £500 fine as well as £200 in legal costs.

As well as criminal proceedings, there was also disciplinary action from his club and The FA. A lengthy ban from the game was regarded as inevitable, with some critics calling for Cantona to be deported and never allowed to play football in England again, while others called for him to be banned from football for life. In accordance with The FA&#x27;s wishes, United&#x27;s initial action was to fine Cantona £20,000 for the assault and to confirm that he would not play for the first team for the rest of the season, although United were still in the hunt for a second double. The FA then increased the ban to eight months, up to and including 30 September 1995, and fined him a further £10,000.

The FA Chief Executive Graham Kelly described his attack as &quot;a stain on our game&quot; that brought shame on football. FIFA then confirmed the suspension as worldwide, meaning that Cantona could not escape the ban by being transferred or loaned to a foreign club. He was stripped of the captaincy of the France national team by coach Aimé Jacquet, and never played for the France national team again, and his club lost the title to Blackburn Rovers.

There had been media speculation that Cantona would leave United to play for a foreign club when his suspension finished and many observers felt he would not be able to cope with the inevitable goading from rival players and supporters. Ferguson persuaded him to stay in Manchester, despite interest from Italian club Inter Milan, who had managed to lure his team-mate Paul Ince to Italy that year.

Even after signing his new contract, Cantona was frustrated by the terms of his ban, which did not even allow him to play in friendly matches behind closed doors. On 8 August, he handed in a request for his contract to be terminated, as he no longer wanted to play football in England. This came after United had been censured by the FA for fielding Cantona in a match against another club at the club&#x27;s training ground, which was defined as a friendly match despite the club organising the match as being within the context of training – as his suspension allowed him to play in this type of match only. The request was turned down and two days later, following a meeting in Paris with Ferguson, he declared that he would remain at the club.

In 2011, Cantona said that the attack on Simmons was &quot;a great feeling&quot; and a memory he is happy for fans to treasure, but &quot;... it was a mistake&quot;. In 2002, the notoriety of the Kung fu kick saw it ranked number 12 on Channel 4&#x27;s poll of the 100 Greatest Sporting Moments. In retrospect, Simmons&#x27; behavior that provoked Cantona&#x27;s kick would a decade later be regarded as racial abuse which almost certainly would have forced the partial or full closure of Crystal Palace&#x27;s stadium, as well as meriting Simmons a considerably lengthier sentence. More recently when Paul Pogba&#x27;s Manchester United team-mate Marcus Rashford was racially abused on social media, and ex-footballer Garth Crooks said that &quot;[i]f something drastic is not done soon…&quot; there could be an incident between a player and a fan, similar to Cantona&#x27;s kung-fu kick on the offensive fan in 1995.

====1995–96 season====

In his comeback game against arch rivals Liverpool on 1 October 1995, Cantona set up a goal for Nicky Butt two minutes into the game and then scored a penalty to secure a point for United in a 2–2 home draw. However, eight months without competitive football had taken its toll and Cantona struggled for form prior to Christmas; by 24 December, the gap between United and league leaders Newcastle had increased to 10 points and eventually 12.

However, after defeat to Tottenham on New Year&#x27;s Day, which by that point, Man Utd faced with a 12-point deficit, United went unbeaten for 12 consecutive league matches, including Cantona&#x27;s first visit to Selhurst Park since he was banned, during which he scored twice in a 4–2 win over Wimbledon. Victory over Arsenal on 20 March, with Cantona scoring the only goal of the game with a 25-yard half-volley, saw United overtake Newcastle in the title race, where they would remain for the rest of the season. The goal came as part of a personal scoring run of six consecutive league matches for Cantona, four of which saw him score the game&#x27;s only goal. He scored the fifth in a 5–0 win over Nottingham Forest on the penultimate day of the season, a result that meant that United realistically only needed to avoid defeat at Middlesbrough on the final day; they won 3–0 to secure their third league title in four years. Cantona finished the season as the club&#x27;s top scorer with 14 goals from 30 league appearances.

Cantona&#x27;s ban meant he was not eligible to appear in their League Cup or UEFA Cup campaigns, but he did score in four of United&#x27;s six matches on the way to the 1996 FA Cup Final against Liverpool, their third in a row in the competition. In the absence of regular captain Steve Bruce due to injury, Cantona wore the armband for the final and took on the captain&#x27;s responsibility by volleying in the only goal of the game from the edge of the penalty area in the 86th minute after Liverpool had failed to clear a corner. United&#x27;s victory made them the first club to win the Double twice and Cantona the first FA Cup-winning captain from outside the British Isles.

====1996–97 season====

Cantona was named as United&#x27;s captain for the 1996–97 season following the departure of Bruce to Birmingham City. United retained the league in the 1996–97 season; Cantona had won four league titles in five years with the team, and six in seven years including those won with Marseille and Leeds, the exception being the 1994–95 season which he had missed the second half of through suspension.

At the end of the season he announced that he was retiring from football at the age of 30. His final competitive game came against West Ham on 11 May 1997, and his final appearance before retiring was five days later on 16 May in a testimonial for David Busst (whose career had been ended by an injury suffered against United the previous year) against Coventry City at Highfield Road. Cantona scored a total of 64 league goals for United, 13 in domestic cup competitions, and 5 in the Champions League, bringing his tally to 82 goals in less than five years.

===After leaving===
In 1998, the Football League, as part of its centenary season celebrations, included Cantona on its list of 100 League Legends. Cantona&#x27;s achievements in the English League were further marked in 2002 when he was made an inaugural inductee of the English Football Hall of Fame. Later in 1998, Cantona organised a match of Manchester United players against other players from around the world in what was originally designed to be a memorial for the victims of the Munich air disaster in 1958 and their families, but which was merged with a testimonial for Cantona himself.
In his 1999 autobiography &quot;Managing My Life&quot;, Alex Ferguson claimed that Cantona had informed him of his decision to retire from playing within 24 hours of Manchester United&#x27;s Champions League semi-final defeat to Borussia Dortmund, though the decision was not made public for almost a month afterwards. During that time, there had been speculation about his future at Manchester United, including talk of a move to Real Zaragoza of Spain. Returning to Britain in 2003 to pick up the Overseas Player of the Decade Award at the Premier League 10 Seasons Awards, Cantona said of his premature retirement, &quot;When you quit football it is not easy, your life becomes difficult. I should know because sometimes I feel I quit too young. I loved the game but I no longer had the passion to go to bed early, not to go out with my friends, not to drink, and not to do a lot of other things, the things I like in life.&quot; In 2004, Cantona was quoted as saying, &quot;I&#x27;m so proud the fans still sing my name, but I fear tomorrow they will stop. I fear it because I love it. And everything you love, you fear you will lose.&quot;

He was interviewed in a &quot;Number 7s&quot; issue of Manchester United&#x27;s official magazine, &quot;United&quot;, in August 2006, stating he would only return to United as &#x27;Number 1&#x27; (meaning not return as assistant manager or coach) and would create a team like no other and play the way he thinks football should be played; however, Cantona opposed the ownership of Manchester United by the Glazer family and stated that he would not return to the club, even as a manager, while they were in charge.

In March 2014, Cantona was arrested and cautioned for an act of common assault on Regent&#x27;s Park Road in Camden, North London. The victim did not require medical attention.

Cantona received the UEFA President&#x27;s Award in August 2019. Dressed in a flat cap, he began by quoting William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;King Lear&quot; – &quot;As flies to wanton boys we are for the gods&quot; – before referencing science, war and crime. Similar to the response to his &quot;seagulls&quot; press conference in 1995, the puzzled audience watched in silence.

==International career==
Cantona was given his full international debut against West Germany in August 1987 by national team manager Henri Michel. In September 1988, angered after being dropped from the national team, Cantona referred to Michel as a &quot;bag of shit&quot; in a post-match TV interview and was indefinitely banned from all international matches. However, Michel was sacked shortly after that, having failed to qualify for the 1990 FIFA World Cup. The new coach was Michel Platini and one of his first acts was to recall Cantona. Platini stated that whilst he was coach, Cantona would be selected for France as long as he was playing competitive top-class football; it was also Platini who had initiated Cantona&#x27;s move to England to restart his career. France qualified for UEFA Euro 1992 held in Sweden, but failed to win a single game despite the strike partnership of Cantona and Jean-Pierre Papin. Platini resigned after the finals to be replaced by Gérard Houllier.

Under Houllier, France failed to qualify for the 1994 FIFA World Cup in the United States after losing the final game 2–1 at home to Bulgaria, when a draw would have sufficed. Houllier resigned and Aimé Jacquet took over. Jacquet began to rebuild the national team in preparation for Euro 96 and appointed Cantona as captain. Cantona remained captain until the Selhurst Park incident in January 1995 that led to his ban and captaincy being stripped. In addition, he lost his place to Zinedine Zidane, as Jacquet had revamped the squad with new players. Cantona, Papin and David Ginola lost their places in the squad and were never selected for the French team again, thus missing Euro 96.

Though there was media criticism about Cantona&#x27;s omission, as he was playing his best football in the Premier League, Jacquet stated that the team had done well without Cantona and that he wanted to keep faith with the players who had taken them so far. In a 2015 interview with French radio network France Info, Cantona stated that had he still been involved with the national side, he would have extended his career to feature in the 1998 FIFA World Cup, held in Cantona&#x27;s home nation. Cantona still harbours resentment for the people at the head of his national team but also admiration for his adopted football country; at UEFA Euro 2004 and the 2006 FIFA World Cup, he supported England and not France.

==Post-playing career==

===Acting career===

Cantona focused his later career mostly as an actor in French cinema, having had his first role as a rugby player in &quot;Le bonheur est dans le pré&quot;, shot during his 1995 suspension from football. In the late 1990s, he accepted a role as a French ambassador in the English film &quot;Elizabeth&quot; (1998). In 2002, he directed a short film, &quot;Apporte-moi ton amour&quot;. He guest-starred as a mysterious barroom philosopher in independent British film &quot;Jack Says&quot;, released to DVD in September 2008. He co-starred as director Thierry Grimandi in &quot;French Film&quot; (2009), and was co-producer and a lead actor in Ken Loach&#x27;s Palme d&#x27;Or-nominated film &quot;Looking for Eric&quot; (2009). He stars as The Corsican in the Danish western &quot;The Salvation&quot;, which premiered at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival on 17 May 2014.

In January 2020, Cantona played The King in the music video for Liam Gallagher&#x27;s single &quot;Once&quot;.

====Work with Nike and other companies====
Cantona has frequently appeared in commercials for the sportswear company Nike. In 1994, he was involved in a Nike advertising campaign which featured a black and white image of himself in front of the English flag, with the caption: &quot;&#x27;66 was a great year for English football. Eric was born.&quot; In 1996, he was the central figure in a Nike commercial titled &quot;Good vs Evil&quot; in a gladiatorial game set in a Roman amphitheatre. Appearing alongside football players from around the world, including Ronaldo, Paolo Maldini, Luís Figo, Patrick Kluivert and Jorge Campos, they defend &quot;the beautiful game&quot; against a team of demonic warriors, which ends with Cantona receiving the ball from Ronaldo, pulling up his shirt collar in his trademark style, and delivering the final line, &quot;Au Revoir&quot;, before striking the ball which punches right through the demon goalkeeper.

Since his retirement from professional football in 1997, Cantona has continued to appear in Nike commercials, often in a non-playing role. In 1997, he starred in Nike&#x27;s &quot;Park Life&quot; commercial, set to the song &quot;Parklife&quot; by Blur, in which a group of pub league players playing amateur football at Hackney Marshes in east London are suddenly joined by top Premier League footballers, including Cantona, Ian Wright, David Seaman and Robbie Fowler. In 2000, &quot;Park Life&quot; was ranked number 15 in Channel 4&#x27;s poll of the 100 Greatest TV Ads.

In a global Nike advertising campaign in the run-up to the 2002 FIFA World Cup entitled &quot;Secret Tournament&quot;, Cantona starred as the organiser of &quot;underground&quot; games (branded by Nike as &quot;Scorpion KO&quot;) in a commercial directed by Terry Gilliam, which takes place between football players such as Thierry Henry, Ronaldinho, Francesco Totti, Roberto Carlos and Hidetoshi Nakata. In a Nike campaign ahead of the 2006 FIFA World Cup, Cantona appeared as the lead spokesman for the Joga Bonito organisation, an association attempting to eliminate acting and fake play from football. He also starred in a Eurostar commercial in 1996, and an Irish EuroMillions advertisement in 2004. In 2009, he featured in a British television advertisement for a new model of the Renault Laguna.

===Beach soccer===

Shortly after his departure from Manchester United in 1997, Cantona became captain of the France national beach soccer team, gaining an interest in the sport through his brother Joel who was already a part of the France national side travelling the world to play matches. Cantona continued his interest in beach soccer games in southern Asia and at the Inaugural Kronenbourg Beach Soccer Cup in 2002, in the city of Brighton, England.

As a recognisable figure, Cantona was key to beach soccer&#x27;s growth during the sports early years, being a magnet for drawing in fans to beach soccer events, and also helping to promote the sport, saying in 2002, &quot;Physically it is difficult, technically it is difficult, and tactically it&#x27;s difficult too. We must work very hard, and train regularly together. Beach Soccer has got everything needed to be a great sport.&quot;

He found considerable success as he managed and played in the French team which won their first European title at the 2004 Euro Beach Soccer League. At the inaugural FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup in Rio de Janeiro in 2005, he was player-manager of the team and scored one goal in a 7-4 win against Spain. France ended up winning the tournament. This was Cantona&#x27;s final year as a player. However, he continued to coach the France national team at the 2006 Beach Soccer World Cup, which finished third. In 2007, Cantona enjoyed another successful year as manager, taking France to fourth place in the World Cup and narrowly missing out on a second European title, finishing runners-up to Portugal after a 7–6 loss in the final of the 2007 Euro Beach Soccer League. The World Cup was held in France for the first time in 2008; however, Cantona was unable to make the top four after losing to Italy in the quarter-finals.

After failing, as manager, to qualify France to the World Cup for the first time in 2009, Cantona&#x27;s demise as head coach was sealed in 2010 as not only did France fail to qualify for the upcoming World Cup again, but Cantona also lead the national team to relegation from the top division of the Euro Beach Soccer League down to Division B. These series of disappointments lead to Cantona resigning as manager of France in 2011, after almost 15 years involved in the team. In 2019, the magazine France Football placed Cantona fourth in an article named &quot;10 Legends of Beach Soccer&quot;.

===Brief stint with New York Cosmos===

New York Cosmos announced the Frenchman&#x27;s return to football as their Director of Soccer on 18 January 2011. On arrival, Cantona described his role to the press as to help Cosmos &quot;regain the number one position in the United States and then... to become one of the best clubs in the world over the coming years.&quot; Cantona was later fired by the club after a confrontation with a photographer, and in May 2015, he sued the Cosmos for nearly $1 million in back pay and a promised 4% equity share. Cosmos rejected his claims, insisting that his role as Director of Soccer was largely ceremonial and that Cantona&#x27;s true job was as &quot;a promoter and brand ambassador&quot;. The two parties later agreed to dismiss the lawsuit, though terms of a settlement were not disclosed.

==Style of play==
Regarded by pundits as one of the best players of his generation, one of the greatest Premier League players of all time, and as one of France&#x27;s and Manchester United&#x27;s greatest players ever, Cantona was nicknamed by Manchester United fans as &quot;King Eric&quot;. A large, physically strong, hard-working and tenacious player, Cantona was a forward who combined technical skill and creativity with power and goalscoring ability. Despite his height and imposing physique, he was a skilful player on the ball, due to his long torso, which gave him a lower centre of gravity than most players of his stature, and who possessed good technique and ball control, as well as an excellent first touch.

He was renowned for his vision, passing, intelligence and playmaking skills, in addition to his eye for goal and powerful and accurate striking ability, which often saw him score from spectacular strikes and volleys. As such, he often played in a free, creative role between the midfield and forward lines throughout his career, acting as a deep-lying forward behind the main striker, due to his tendency to drop deep into midfield to retrieve the ball and orchestrate attacking plays, as well as his ability both to score goals and provide assists for team-mates. However, Cantona was also capable of playing as a centre-forward, due to his ability to hold-up the ball with his back to goal, although this was not his favoured position, as an out–and–out striker, as an attacking midfielder, or even as a central midfielder on occasion. He was also an accurate penalty and free kick taker.

Due to his height, physique, positional sense and heading accuracy, he was strong in the air. He was known for being both mentally and physically tough, and was highly regarded for his strong, commanding and charismatic personality, as well as his leadership qualities and bravery, which helped to alleviate pressure from his team-mates. Cantona was known for turning up his collar during matches. Wayne Barton notes that he first wore his collar up in a Manchester derby match on 7 November 1993, following United&#x27;s elimination from Europe at the hands of Galatasary, commenting: &quot;one wonders if, in his own superstitious way, this was Cantona&#x27;s way of calming that fire inside him after the trip to Turkey, a way to focus his thoughts on moving forward.&quot; When asked about the reason behind his famous on-field appearance, he commented: &quot;I didn&#x27;t plan it. During one game it was cold and my collar just stayed up. We won, so it became a habit to play with my collar up.&quot;

Cantona was a hard-working player, who also stood out for his defensive contribution off the ball, as well as his ability to start attacking plays after winning back possession. He also drew praise in the media for his discipline and dedication in training. Despite his talent and ability, he was also notorious for his aggression, confrontational behaviour, volatile temper and lack of discipline on the pitch, as well as his tendency to commit hard challenges, which made him a highly controversial figure in world football. While was known for being outspoken on a number of issues, he was also accused in media of being arrogant. When he was asked whether Zidane or Platini was the greatest French player of all time, for example, he said: &quot;No, it is me.&quot; He drew criticism from certain pundits for being inconsistent at times, and for his disappointing performances at international level and in European club competitions, as well as his lack of significant speed, which was particularly evident in his later career with his advancing age.

==Political views==
Cantona called for a social revolution against the banks and encouraged customers of the major retail banks to withdraw their money on 7 December 2010 in protest at the 2008 financial crisis. This proposal then became the base for an online campaign calling for a bank run.

In January 2012, Cantona began trying to gather the 500 signatures from elected officials necessary for a bid for the French presidential election, in order to draw support for the homeless charity and campaign group Emmaus.

In June 2012, he signed a petition for the release of Palestinian footballer Mahmoud Sarsak: imprisoned without conviction by Israel in July 2009 and released on 10 July 2012.

==Personal life==
Cantona married Isabelle Ferrer in 1987. They have two children together. They divorced in 2003. He married actress Rachida Brakni in 2007. They have two children together.

Cantona&#x27;s brother, Joël, is a former footballer who retired at a young age and went into acting. His cousin, Sacha Opinel, is a footballer. His nephew, Martin Cantona, is goalkeeper for a Montreal university team.

<text>Arnold Machin OBE RA FRSS (; 30 September 1911 – 9 March 1999) was a British artist, sculptor, and coin and postage stamp designer.

==Biography==
Machin was born Stoke-on-Trent in 1911. He started work at the age of 14 as an apprentice china painter at the Minton Pottery. During the Depression he learnt to sculpt at Stoke-on-Trent College of Art, which was opposite the Minton factory. In the 1930s he moved to Derby, where he worked at Royal Crown Derby and met his wife Patricia. He went on to study at the Royal College of Art in London.

After imprisonment in the Second World War as a conscientious objector, he returned to modelling and sculpture, and created many notable ceramics which are now prized collectors&#x27; items. In 1947 he was elected an associate member of the Royal Academy of Arts, was a Master of Sculpture from 1959 to 1966 and became the longest-serving member of the Academy. He was elected an Academician in 1956 and a Fellow of the Royal British Society of Sculptors. From 1951, he was a tutor at the Royal College of Art. Machin was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1965 New Year Honours.

After retirement, Machin lived in his home, Garmelow Manor, Eccleshall, Stafford Borough, Staffordshire, until his death in 1999, aged 87.

==Stamp and coin designs==
In 1964 Machin was chosen to design a new image of Queen Elizabeth II for the decimal coinage, which was to be introduced from 1968. This was used for all British coins until 1984 and was also used on the coins of Rhodesia in 1964, coins of Canada from 1965 to 1989, Australia from 1966 to 1984 and New Zealand from 1967 to 1985.

In 1966 the Queen approved Machin&#x27;s similar design for an effigy of her to be used on what came to be known as the &quot;Machin series&quot; of British definitive postage stamps. Machin produced a bas-relief in clay which, when combined with a different coloured background, is reminiscent of the overlaid decoration of potteries such as Wedgwood. The design was first used on the 4d stamp which was issued in June 1967, and was used on all British definitive stamps (except more recent regional issues) since. It is thought that this design is one of the most reproduced works of art in history with approximately 320 billion copies produced.

On several occasions the Queen was approached with suggestions for the replacement of the Machin stamp portrait. Although she considered alternatives, she never approved any new design, stipulating that any such replacement would have to be &quot;a work of real quality&quot;.

In 2007 the Machin-designed stamp was still in use at its 40th anniversary and to mark the occasion, the Royal Mail issued a commemorative stamp featuring a photograph of Machin. It was also available for sale in a miniature sheet which incorporated another stamp with a reproduction of a Machin series stamp, as well as two £1 Machins in different colours.

In 2017, the 50th anniversary was celebrated by Royal Mail with a large number of products including miniature sheets, presentation packs, first day covers, a retail stamp booklet, a prestige stamp booklet, a medal cover, and new post and go faststamps.

==Conservation==

In the year 1956, while resident at number 15 The Villas, Stokeville, an estate of 24 Victorian houses in Stoke-upon-Trent, he received publicity in the national press when he chained himself to an old metal lamp-post, in protest at its planned removal.
Machin&#x27;s protest, &quot;against the destruction of all the beautiful things which is going on in this country&quot; did not prevent the lamp-post from being replaced by a concrete one; however, it was given to him for his own garden and his wife Patricia unlocked him. The lamp has since been restored to its original position.

==Family==
Machin and his wife, (the author and painter Patricia), had a son, Francis (1949–2007), who was also an artist, and an architect.
After Francis died, some of his father&#x27;s possessions, from his house near Eccleshall in rural Staffordshire, were sold at auction. These included the fourth of the known final plasters made to create the Machin stamp series, the three others being kept in the Royal Mail archives.

Minor planet 3109 Machin is named in his honour.

<text>William Fulton Beith Mackay (12 August 1922 – 6 June 1987) was a Scottish actor and playwright, best known for his role as prison officer Mr Mackay in the 1970s television sitcom &quot;Porridge&quot;.

==Early life==
Mackay was born in Paisley, Renfrewshire, Scotland. He was brought up in Clydebank by a widowed aunt after the death of his mother from diabetes. His father was employed by the NAAFI.

On leaving school, Mackay trained as a quantity surveyor and later volunteered for the Royal Air Force in 1941, but was not accepted because of a perforated eardrum. He then enlisted with the Black Watch and he served for five years during the Second World War, which included three years spent in India.

==Career==

===Theatre work===
After being demobbed, Mackay began training as an actor at RADA. His first work was with the Citizens&#x27; Theatre, Glasgow, where he performed in nine seasons between 1949 and 1958. He also worked at the Royal Lyceum Theatre, Edinburgh before gaining notice at the Arts Theatre Club, London, where in 1960, he played the part of Oscar in &quot;The Naked Island&quot;, a play about POWs in Singapore.

In 1962, Mackay appeared at the same theatre, in Russian playwright Maxim Gorki&#x27;s play &quot;The Lower Depths&quot; for the Royal Shakespeare Company. He then acted with the Old Vic company and the National Theatre, performing in such productions as &quot;Peer Gynt&quot; and &quot;The Alchemist&quot;. Other roles for the RSC included Mr Squeers in &quot;Nicholas Nickleby&quot; and the drunken gaoler in &quot;Die Fledermaus&quot;. In 1972, he played the part of Hughie in the Royal Lyceum Theatre Company&#x27;s production of Bill Bryden&#x27;s play, &quot;Willie Rough&quot;.

Mackay was a director of the Scottish Actors&#x27; Company and, in 1981, a founder of the Scottish Theatre Company, playing Willie Souden in the company&#x27;s production of Bill Bryden&#x27;s play, &quot;Civilians&quot;, set in wartime Greenock. 

===Television work===
Mackay was acknowledged as a strong character actor in various television series. He is best remembered for his namesake role from 1973 to 1977 as the comically ferocious prison officer, Mr Mackay, in the British sitcom &quot;Porridge&quot;, alongside Ronnie Barker. He also appeared in the film version of the series. The ensemble playing of Mackay, Barker, Richard Beckinsale and Brian Wilde, and the writing by Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais, made &quot;Porridge&quot; one of the most successful comedy series of the 1970s. He returned to the role of Mr Mackay, now nearing retirement from HM Prison Service, in the first episode of &quot;Going Straight&quot; (1978), the sequel series to &quot;Porridge&quot;.

Before coming to prominence in &quot;Porridge&quot;, Mackay made several appearances in &quot;The Avengers&quot;, one particular episode being &quot;Return of the Cybernauts&quot; in which he played Professor Chadwick; he also played Det. Supt., later Det. Chief Supt. Inman in &quot;Special Branch&quot; (1969–71). His other work included &quot;Coronation Street&quot; and &quot;Z-Cars&quot;. He appeared as RAF psychiatrist Fowler in an episode of &quot;Some Mothers Do &#x27;Ave &#x27;Em&quot; and as a doctor in &quot;Doctor at Large&quot; in 1971.

Mackay played John Everett in &quot;The Saint&quot; (1968) &quot;The Best Laid Schemes&quot;&quot; and Willie, a poacher in &quot;The Saint&quot; (1966) - Episode (S5, E6) &quot;The Convenient Monster&quot;&quot;. He was cast as misguided scientist Doctor John Quinn in the 1970 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; story &quot;Doctor Who and the Silurians&quot; and was later seriously considered by producer Barry Letts to play the Fourth Doctor when Jon Pertwee announced he was leaving the role in 1974.

Mackay played a regular officer running a training course in the &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot; episode &quot;We Know Our Onions&quot; (1973), a doctor in &quot;The Miser&#x27;s Hoard&quot; (1977), and a detective in a &quot;Wodehouse Playhouse&quot; episode (1978).

Mackay often stayed true to his Scottish roots, acting in productions such as &quot;Play for Today&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Three Tales of Orkney&quot;, in 1971, and &quot;The Master of Ballantrae&quot;, and as former Prime Minister Bonar Law in the 1981 TV series &quot;The Life and Times of David Lloyd George&quot;. He played the Captain in the British version of the Jim Henson children&#x27;s series, &quot;Fraggle Rock&quot; (1984–1987). In one of his last performances, Mackay portrayed an art forger in the &quot;Lovejoy&quot; episode &quot;Death and Venice&quot;.

===Film work===
Despite his status, he appeared in few films. After his screen debut in the film &quot;I&#x27;m a Stranger&quot; (1952), his most notable roles were those in &quot;Gumshoe&quot; (1971), &quot;Britannia Hospital&quot; (1982), &quot;Local Hero&quot; (1983), and &quot;Defence of the Realm&quot; (1985).

===Playwriting===
Under the pseudonym of Aeneas MacBride, Mackay wrote plays for the BBC. His &quot;Dalhousie&#x27;s Luck&quot;, a drama set at the time of the siege of Aberdeen by the Marquess of Montrose in 1644, produced by Pharic Maclaren and with Brian Cox in the title role, was broadcast as part of the Play for Today series on 3rd August 1980.

==Personal life==

Mackay was married to Irish actress Sheila Manahan.

Mackay did much work for the Glasgow children&#x27;s charity Child and Family Trust.

In 1984, Mackay was awarded an OBE. He greatly enjoyed oil painting.

Mackay died from stomach cancer on 6 June 1987, at the age of 64. He was buried at East Sheen Cemetery in southwest London. His widow, Sheila, died in 1988 and was buried with her husband.

<doc id="199940" wikidata="Q1457669" url="?curid=199940" title="Massive compact halo object">
<text>A MAssive Compact Halo Object (MACHO) is a kind of astronomical body that might explain the apparent presence of dark matter in galactic halos. A MACHO is a body that emits little or no radiation and drifts through interstellar space unassociated with any planetary system (and may or may not be composed of normal baryonic matter). Since MACHOs are not luminous, they are hard to detect. MACHO candidates include black holes or neutron stars as well as brown dwarfs and unassociated planets. White dwarfs and very faint red dwarfs have also been proposed as candidate MACHOs. The term was coined by astrophysicist Kim Griest.

==Detection==
A MACHO may be detected when it passes in front of or nearly in front of a star and the MACHO&#x27;s gravity bends the light, causing the star to appear brighter in an example of gravitational lensing known as gravitational microlensing. Several groups have searched for MACHOs by searching for the microlensing amplification of light. These groups have ruled out dark matter being explained by MACHOs with mass in the range solar masses (0.3 lunar masses) to 100 solar masses. One group, the MACHO collaboration, claimed in 2000 to have found enough microlensing to predict the existence of many MACHOs with mean mass of about 0.5 solar masses, enough to make up perhaps 20% of the dark matter in the galaxy.
This suggests that MACHOs could be white dwarfs or red dwarfs which have similar masses. However, red and white dwarfs are not completely dark; they do emit some light, and so can be searched for with the Hubble Space Telescope and with proper motion surveys. These searches have ruled out the possibility that these objects make up a significant fraction of dark matter in our galaxy. Another group, the EROS2 collaboration, does not confirm the signal claims by the MACHO group. They did not find enough microlensing effect with a sensitivity higher by a factor 2. Observations using the Hubble Space Telescope&#x27;s NICMOS instrument showed that less than one percent of the halo mass is composed of red dwarfs. This corresponds to a negligible fraction of the dark matter halo mass. Therefore, the missing mass problem is not solved by MACHOs.

==Types ==
MACHOs may sometimes be considered to include black holes. Isolated black holes without any matter around them are truly black in that they emit no light and any light shone upon them is absorbed and not reflected. 
A black hole can sometimes be detected by the halo of bright gas and dust that forms around it as an accretion disk being pulled in by the black hole&#x27;s gravity. Such a disk can generate jets of gas that are shot out away from the black hole because it cannot be absorbed quickly enough. An isolated black hole, however, would not have an accretion disk and would only be detectable by gravitational lensing.
Cosmologists doubt non-direct collapse black holes make up a majority of dark matter because the black holes are at isolated points of the galaxy. The largest contributor to the missing mass must be spread throughout the galaxy to balance the gravity. A minority of physicists, including Chapline and Laughlin, believe that the widely accepted model of the black hole is wrong and needs to be replaced by a new model, the dark-energy star; in the general case for the suggested new model, the cosmological distribution of dark energy would be slightly lumpy and dark-energy stars of primordial type might be a possible candidate for MACHOs.

Neutron stars, unlike black holes, are not heavy enough to collapse completely, and instead form a material rather like that of an atomic nucleus called neutron matter. After sufficient time these stars could radiate away enough energy to become cold enough that they would be too faint to see. Likewise, old white dwarfs may also become cold and dead, eventually becoming black dwarfs, although the universe is not thought to be old enough for any stars to have reached this stage.

Brown dwarfs have also been proposed as MACHO candidates. Brown dwarfs are sometimes called &quot;failed stars&quot; as they do not have enough mass for nuclear fusion to begin once their gravity causes them to collapse. Brown dwarfs are about thirteen to seventy-five times the mass of Jupiter. The contraction of material forming the brown dwarf heats them up so they only glow feebly at infrared wavelengths, making them difficult to detect. A survey of gravitational lensing effects in the direction of the Small Magellanic Cloud and Large Magellanic Cloud did not detect the number and type of lensing events expected if brown dwarfs made up a significant fraction of dark matter.

==Theoretical considerations==
Theoretical work simultaneously also showed that ancient MACHOs are not likely to account for the large amounts of dark matter now thought to be present in the universe. The Big Bang as it is currently understood could not have produced enough baryons and still be consistent with the observed elemental abundances, including the abundance of deuterium. Furthermore, separate observations of baryon acoustic oscillations, both in the cosmic microwave background and large-scale structure of galaxies, set limits on the ratio of baryons to the total amount of matter. These observations show that a large fraction of non-baryonic matter is necessary regardless of the presence or absence of MACHOs; however, MACHO candidates such as primordial black holes could be formed of non-baryonic matter (from pre-baryonic epochs of the early Big Bang).

<text>Lois Ann Lowry (; née Hammersberg; born March 20, 1937) is an American writer. She is the author of several books for children and young adults, including &quot;The Giver Quartet&quot;, &quot;Number the Stars&quot;, and &quot;Rabble Starkey&quot;. She is known for writing about difficult subject matters, dystopias, and complex themes in works for young audiences.

Lowry has won two Newbery Medals: for &quot;Number the Stars&quot; in 1990 and &quot;The Giver&quot; in 1994. Her book &quot;Gooney Bird Greene&quot; won the 2002 Rhode Island Children&#x27;s Book Award.

Many of her books have been challenged or even banned in some schools and libraries. &quot;The Giver&quot;, which is common in the curricula in some schools, has been prohibited in others.

==Life==
Lowry was born on March 20, 1937, in Honolulu, Territory of Hawaii, to Katherine Gordon Landis and Robert E. Hammersberg. Her maternal grandfather, Merkel Landis, a banker, created the Christmas Club savings program in 1910. Initially, Lowry&#x27;s parents named her &quot;Cena&quot; for her Norwegian grandmother, but upon hearing the news, her grandmother telegraphed and instructed Lowry&#x27;s parents that the child should have an American name.

Lowry was the middle child. She had an older sister named Helen, and a younger brother named Jon. Helen died of cancer in 1962, but Lowry and her brother still share a close relationship.

Lowry&#x27;s father was an army dentist, whose work moved the family all over the United States and to many parts of the world. Lowry and her family moved from Hawaii to Brooklyn, New York, in 1940, when Lowry was three years old. They relocated in 1942 to her mother&#x27;s home town in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, when Lowry&#x27;s father was deployed to the Pacific during World War II. Lowry began reading at three years old, and after first grade, she skipped second at the Franklin School in Carlisle.

After World War II ended, Lowry moved with her family to Tokyo, Japan, where her father was stationed from 1948 to 1952. Lowry attended seventh and eighth grades at the American School in Japan, a school for dependents of those involved in the military. She returned to the United States when the Korean War began in 1950. Lowry and her family lived in Carlisle again in 1950, where she attended her freshman year in high school before moving to Governors Island, New York, when her father was assigned to First Army Headquarters there. Lowry briefly attended Curtis High School, on Staten Island, then graduated from high school at Packer Collegiate Institute in Brooklyn Heights, New York, attending from 1952 to 1954. She then attended Pembroke College, which became fully merged with Brown University in 1971. There she met her future husband, Donald Grey Lowry.

Lowry left the university in 1956 after her marriage to Donald Grey Lowry, a U.S. Navy officer. The couple moved several times from San Diego to New London, Connecticut, to Key West, Florida, to Charleston, South Carolina, to Cambridge, Massachusetts and finally to Portland, Maine. They had two daughters, Alix and Kristin, and two sons, Grey and Benjamin. 
While raising her children, Lowry completed her degree in English literature at the University of Southern Maine in Portland, Maine, in 1972. After earning her bachelor of arts, she continued at the university to pursue graduate studies.

In 1977, at 40 years old, Lowry&#x27;s first book, &quot;A Summer to Die&quot;, was published. In the same year, she and Donald Lowry were divorced. Two years later she met Martin Small in Boston and was in a relationship with him for over 30 years, until his death in 2011. From 2014 she has been in a relationship with Howard Corwin, a retired physician.

Lowry&#x27;s son Grey, a USAF major and flight instructor, was killed in the crash of his fighter plane in 1995. Lowry acknowledged that it was the most difficult day of her life, and she said, &quot;His death in the cockpit of a warplane tore away a piece of my world, but it left me, too, with a wish to honor him by joining the many others trying to find a way to end conflict on this very fragile earth.&quot;

As of 2023, Lowry divides her time between Maine and Naples, Florida, and she still remains an active writer and speaker.

==Writing career==
Lowry first began her career as a freelance journalist. In the 1970s, she submitted a short story to &quot;Redbook&quot; magazine, which was intended for adult audiences, but was written from a child&#x27;s perspective. An editor working at Houghton Mifflin who read the Redbook story suggested to Lowry that she should write a children&#x27;s book. Lowry agreed and wrote her first book &quot;A Summer to Die,&quot; which was later published by Houghton Mifflin in 1977 when she was 40 years old. The book featured the theme of terminal illness, which is based on Lowry&#x27;s own experiences with her sister Helen.

Lowry continued to write about difficult topics in her next publication, &quot;Autumn Street&quot; (1979), which explores themes of coping with racism, grief, and fear at a young age. The novel is told from the perspective of a young girl who is sent to live with her grandfather during World War II, which is also based on her own experiences of having her father deployed during World War II. Of all the books she has published, &quot;Autumn Street&quot; is considered to be her most autobiographical.

In the same year of publishing &quot;Autumn Street&quot;, Lowry also published her novel &quot;Anastasia Krupnik&quot;, the first installment in the Anastasia series. The series, which touches on serious themes with a humorous approach, continued through to 1995.

Lowry published &quot;Number the Stars&quot; in 1989, which received multiple awards, including the 1990 Newbery Medal. Lowry received another Newbery in 1994, for &quot;The Giver&quot; (1993). After publishing &quot;The Giver&quot;, she went on to publish another three companion novels that take place in the same universe: &quot;Gathering Blue&quot; (2000), &quot;Messenger&quot; (2004), and finally &quot;Son&quot; (2012), which tied all three of the previous books together. Collectively, they are referred to as &quot;The Giver Quartet&quot;. The &quot;New York Times&quot; described the quartet as &quot;less a speculative fiction than a kind of guide for teaching children (and their parents, if they&#x27;re listening carefully) how to be a good person.&quot;

In early 2020, she released a book of poetry, called &quot;On the Horizon&quot;, charting her childhood memories of life in Hawaii and Tokyo, and the lives lost during the attack on Pearl Harbor and the bombing of Hiroshima.

During the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, American publishing company Scholastic Corporation asked Lowry to write a new introduction to &quot;Like the Willow Tree&quot;, a story of a young girl living in Portland, Maine, who was orphaned during the 1918 Spanish flu epidemic. The book was first published in 2011, before being reissued by Scholastic in September 2020.

===Critical reception and banning===
Throughout her works, Lowry has explored several complex issues, including racism, terminal illness, murder, the Holocaust, and the questioning of authority, among other challenging topics. Her writing on such matters has accumulated both praise and criticism. The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; has said a theme running through all of her work is &quot;the importance of human connections.&quot;

By 2000, eight of her books had been challenged in schools and libraries in the United States. In particular, &quot;The Giver&quot; received a diversity of reactions from schools in America after its release in 1993. While some schools adopted it as a part of the mandatory curriculum, others prohibited the book&#x27;s inclusion in their classroom studies. According to the &quot;New York Times&quot; in 2012, &quot;The Giver&quot; had been perennially near the top of the America Library Association&#x27;s list of banned and challenged books since its publication. In a 2012 review of &quot;Son&quot;, the &quot;New York Times&quot; said the 1993 publication of &quot;The Giver&quot; had &quot;shocked adult and child sensibilities alike&quot;. In 2020, &quot;Time&quot; magazine described &quot;The Giver&quot; as &quot;a staple of both middle school curricular and banned book lists.&quot;

According to biographer Joel Chaston, Lowry&#x27;s most critically acclaimed works are &quot;Rabble Starkey&quot;, &quot;Number the Stars&quot;, and &quot;The Giver&quot;.

== Impact ==
Biographer Joel Chaston described her as &quot;clearly one of the most important twentieth-century American writers for children&quot;.

Robin Wasserman, a writer for &quot;The&quot; &quot;New York Times&quot;, said &quot;In many ways, Lowry invented the contemporary young adult dystopian novel&quot;, pointing out that in 1993 it was &quot;unusual and unsettling&quot; for children&#x27;s literature to address topics of political oppression, euthanasia, suicide, or murder.

== Awards ==
Lowry won the Newbery Medal in 1990 for her novel &quot;Number the Stars&quot;, and again in 1994 for &quot;The Giver&quot;. For &quot;Number the Stars&quot;, Lowry has also received the National Jewish Book Award in 1990, in the Children&#x27;s Literature category, and the Dorothy Canfield Fisher Children&#x27;s Book Award in 1991.

In 1994, Lowry was awarded the Regina Medal.

In 2002, her book &quot;Gooney Bird Greene&quot; won the Rhode Island Children&#x27;s Book Award.

Lowry has been nominated three times for the biennial international Hans Christian Andersen Award, the highest recognition available to creators of children&#x27;s books. She was a finalist in 2000, a U.S. nominee in 2004, and a finalist in 2016.

In 2007, she received the Margaret Edwards Award from the American Library Association for her contributions writing for teens. The ALA Margaret Edwards Award recognizes one writer and a particular body of work for &quot;significant and lasting contribution to young adult literature&quot;. Lowry won the annual award in 2007 for &quot;The Giver&quot; (published 1993). The citation observed that &quot;&quot;The Giver&quot; was one of the most frequently challenged books from 1990 to 2000&quot; — that is, the object of &quot;a formal, written attempt to remove a book from a library or classroom.&quot; According to the panel chair, &quot;The book has held a unique position in teen literature. Lowry&#x27;s exceptional use of metaphors and subtle complexity make it a book that will be discussed, debated and challenged for years to come...a perfect teen read.&quot;

She&#x27;s also won a Boston Globe-Hornbook Award, an Anne V. Zarrow Award, a Golden Kite Award, and a Hope S. Dean Memorial Award.

In 2011 she gave the May Hill Arbuthnot Lecture; her lecture was titled &quot;UNLEAVING: The Staying Power of Gold&quot;. She has been awarded honorary degrees from six universities, including a Doctorate of Letters by Brown University in 2014,St. Mary&#x27;s College, University of Southern Maine, Elmhurst College, Wilson College, and Lesley University.

<doc id="199946" wikidata="Q622813" url="?curid=199946" title="Newbery Medal">
<text>The John Newbery Medal, frequently shortened to the Newbery, is a literary award given by the Association for Library Service to Children (ALSC), a division of the American Library Association (ALA), to the author of &quot;the most distinguished contributions to American literature for children&quot;. The Newbery and the Caldecott Medal are considered the two most prestigious awards for children&#x27;s literature in the United States. Books selected are widely carried by bookstores and libraries, the authors are interviewed on television, and master&#x27;s theses and doctoral dissertations are written on them.
Named for John Newbery, an 18th-century English publisher of juvenile books, the winner of the Newbery is selected at the ALA&#x27;s Midwinter Conference by a fifteen-person committee. The Newbery was proposed by Frederic G. Melcher in 1921, making it the first children&#x27;s book award in the world. The physical bronze medal was designed by Rene Paul Chambellan and is given to the winning author at the next ALA annual conference. Since its founding there have been several changes to the composition of the selection committee, while the physical medal remains the same.

Besides the Newbery Medal, the committee awards a variable number of citations to leading contenders, called Newbery Honors or Newbery Honor Books; until 1971, these books were called runners-up. As few as zero and as many as eight have been named, but from 1938 the number of Honors or runners-up has been one to five. To be eligible, a book must be written by a United States citizen or resident and must be published first or simultaneously in the United States in English during the preceding year. Six authors have won two Newbery Medals each, several have won both a Medal and Honor, while a larger number of authors have won multiple Honors, with Laura Ingalls Wilder having won five Honors without ever winning the Medal.

==History==
The Newbery Medal was established on June 22, 1921, at the annual conference of the American Library Association (ALA). Proposed by &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; editor Frederic G. Melcher, the proposal was well received by the children&#x27;s librarians present and then approved by the ALA Executive Board. The award was administered by the ALA from the start, but Melcher provided funds that paid for the design and production of the medal. The Newbery Medal was inaugurated in 1922, considering books published in 1921. According to &quot;The Newbery and Caldecott Awards&quot; Melcher and the ALA Board agreed to establish the award for several reasons that related to children&#x27;s librarians. They wanted to encourage quality, creative children&#x27;s books and to demonstrate to the public that children&#x27;s books deserve recognition and praise. In 1932 the committee felt it was important to encourage new writers in the field, so a rule was made that an author would win a second Newbery only if the vote was unanimous. The rule was in place until 1958. Joseph Krumgold became the first winner of a second Newbery in 1960. Another change, in 1963, made it clear that joint authors of a book were eligible for the award. Several more revisions and clarifications were added in the 1970s and 1980s. Significantly in 1971, the term &quot;Newbery Honor&quot; was introduced. Runners-up had been identified annually from the start, with a few exceptions only during the 1920s; all those runners-up were named Newbery Honor Books retroactively.

=== Medal ===

The physical medal was designed by Rene Paul Chambellan and depicts an author giving his work (a book) to a boy and a girl to read on one side and on the other side the inscription, &quot;For the most distinguished contribution to American literature for children&quot;. The bronze medal retains the name &quot;Children&#x27;s Librarians&#x27; Section&quot;, the original group responsible for awarding the medal, despite the sponsoring committee having changed names four times and now including both school and public librarians. Each winning author gets their own copy of the medal with their name engraved on it. Currently the Association for Library Service to Children (ALSC) is responsible for the award.

=== Committee ===
As Barbara Elleman explained in &quot;The Newbery and Caldecott Awards&quot;, the original Newbery was based on votes by a selected jury of Children&#x27;s Librarian Section officers. Books were first nominated by any librarian, then the jury voted for one favorite. Hendrik van Loon&#x27;s non-fiction history book &quot;The Story of Mankind&quot; won with 163 votes out of 212. In 1924 the process was changed, and instead of using popular vote it was decided that a special award committee would be formed to select the winner. The award committee was made up of the Children&#x27;s Librarian Section executive board, their book evaluation committee and three members at large. In 1929 it was changed again to the four officers, the chairs of the standing committees and the ex-president. Nominations were still taken from members at large.

In 1937 the American Library Association added the Caldecott Award, for &quot;the artist of the most distinguished American picture book for children published in the United States&quot;. That year an award committee selected the Medal and Honor books for both awards. In 1978 the rules were changed and two committees were formed of fifteen people each, one for each award. A new committee is formed every year, with &quot;eight elected, six appointed, and one appointed Chair&quot;.
The Newbery Medal was named for eighteenth-century British bookseller John Newbery. It is awarded annually by the Association for Library Service to Children, a division of the American Library Association, to the author of the most distinguished contribution to American literature for children.

==Selection process==
Committee members are chosen to represent a wide variety of libraries, teachers and book reviewers. They read the books on their own time, then meet twice a year for closed discussions. Any book that qualifies is eligible; it does not have to have been nominated. The Newbery is given to the &quot;author of the most distinguished contribution to American literature for children published by an American publisher in the United States in English during the preceding year.&quot; Newbery winners are announced at the Midwinter Meeting of the American Library Association, held in January or February. The Honor Books must be a subset of the runners-up on the final ballot, either the leading runners-up on that ballot or the leaders on one further ballot that excludes the winner.
The results of the committee vote are kept secret, and winners are notified by phone shortly before the award is announced. In 2015, K. T. Horning of the University of Wisconsin–Madison&#x27;s Cooperative Children&#x27;s Book Center proposed to ALSC that old discussions of the Newbery and Caldecott be made public in the service of researchers and historians. This proposal was met with both support and criticism by former committee members and recognized authors.

==Criticism==

In October 2008, Anita Silvey, a children&#x27;s literary expert, published an article in the &quot;School Library Journal&quot; criticizing the committee for choosing books that are too difficult for children. Lucy Calkins, of the Reading and Writing Project at Columbia University&#x27;s Teachers College, agreed with Silvey: &quot;I can&#x27;t help but believe that thousands, even millions, more children would grow up reading if the Newbery committee aimed to spotlight books that are deep and beautiful and irresistible to kids&quot;. Then-ALSC President Pat Scales responded, &quot;the criterion has never been popularity. It is about literary quality. How many adults have read all the Pulitzer Prize-winning books and... liked every one?&quot;
John Beach, associate professor of literacy education at St. John&#x27;s University in New York, compared the books that adults choose for children with the books that children choose for themselves and found that in the 30 years before 2008 there was only a five percent overlap between the Children&#x27;s Choice Awards (International Reading Association) and the Notable Children&#x27;s Books list (American Library Association). He has also stated that &quot;the Newbery has probably done far more to turn kids off to reading than any other book award in children&#x27;s publishing.&quot;

<doc id="199947" wikidata="Q2828706" url="?curid=199947" title="Airedale">
<text>Airedale is a valley, or dale, in North Yorkshire and West Yorkshire, England. It is named after the River Aire, which flows through it. The upper valley, from Malham Cove to Airton, is known as Malhamdale, named after the village of Malham. At Airton the valley widens and becomes Airedale proper. The river flows past Skipton on to Keighley, Bingley, Shipley, and Leeds.

Airedale, in conjunction with the Ribble Valley, provides low-altitude passes from Yorkshire to Lancashire through the Aire Gap. It is therefore an important transport route and was a strategically important area historically.

== History ==
The upper Aire valley was formed 12,000 years ago by a retreating glacier. A moraine formed in the Cononley area and the lake stretched as far north as Gargrave. Colonisation by man developed later on, especially during the Iron Age. The peoples that occupied the Aire Valley (and much of north eastern England) were called Brigantes by the Romans.

Transport improved in the 18th and 19th centuries with the building of the Aire and Calder Navigation and the Leeds and Liverpool Canal. The railways arrived from the 1830s onwards and during the twentieth century the roads were vastly improved in the valley.

Airedale was wholly within the West Riding of Yorkshire until the reform of local government in 1974.

== Description ==

The upper valley is within the Yorkshire Dales and Yorkshire Dales National Park. From Aire Springs the river flows past Skipton and Keighley, through Bingley, Saltaire, Shipley and into Leeds. Until this point the river is essentially swift flowing and fed by streams and becks.

The broad definition of Airedale includes all the areas adjacent to the River Aire and its tributaries. The Aire Catchment Flood Management Plan (CFMP), which takes into account all the becks and streams that feed the river, lists the Worth Valley and most of Bradford City as part of Airedale. Similarly, the Airedale Partnership&#x27;s Masterplan, which is sponsored by Bradford Council, shows the same boundaries as the Aire CFMP.

== Geology ==

The upper section between Malham and Skipton is largely upfaulted Carboniferous limestone. The middle section between Skipton and Knottingley is peat and gritstone, with steep valley walls crested with moorland prevalent between Skipton and Shipley. The sandstone deposits between Skipton and Leeds have characterised the buildings within this part of Airedale, whilst the deposits of Limestone, Coal, Fireclay and Ironstone fuelled industrial developments.

== Tourism ==
Airedale is notable for several tourist sites and the World Heritage Site of Saltaire village. Other attractions include the Keighley and Worth Valley Railway, Bingley Five Rise Locks, the Shipley Glen Tramway, East Riddlesden Hall, Rodley Nature Reserve, Kirkstall Abbey, the Royal Armouries (Leeds), St Aidan&#x27;s Nature Reserve and Fairburn Ings Nature Reserve.

== Industry ==
Many of the former woollen and cotton mills of the dale have been demolished or converted into housing. The heavy industry east of Leeds is still in existence and two of the three coal fired powers stations in the lower section take their water from the River Aire. Industry that lies alongside the Aire includes Ferrybridge, Eggborough and Drax power stations, Eggborough Saint Gobain glassworks, Stolze and Allied Glass in Knottingley and Kellingley Colliery.

Leeds City Council have an enterprise zone that covers 400 acres of regenerated land along the Aire Valley from the city centre up to junction 45 of the M1 (known as Gateway 45). This houses several manufacturing and food companies.

== Eponyms ==
The names Aire and Airedale are associated with many things and areas. Most notable in the valley are Airedale General Hospital, Aireborough (a region comprising mostly Wharfedale towns) and Airedale, a suburb of Castleford.

The area gives its name to the Airedale Terrier, the largest of the terrier group of dogs. They were first bred in the area in the nineteenth century.

<text>Jacques Nicolas Augustin Thierry (10 May 179522 May 1856; also known as Augustin Thierry) was a French historian. Although originally a follower of Henri de Saint-Simon, he later developed his own approach to history. A committed liberal, his approach to history often introduced a romantic interpretation, although he did engage in research of primary sources. He nevertheless was recognised as a significant historian of the evolution of communal governance.

==Early life==
He was born in Blois, Loir-et-Cher, and was the elder brother of Amédée Thierry. He had no advantages of birth or fortune, but was distinguished at the Blois Grammar School, and entered the École Normale Supérieure in 1811. In 1813 he was sent as a professor to Compiègne, but stayed there a very short time.

==Career==

Thierry enthusiastically embraced the ideals of the French Revolution and Saint Simon&#x27;s vision of an ideal future society. He briefly became Saint-Simon&#x27;s secretary and &quot;adopted son&quot;. Initially he had been put off by what he perceived as the elitism of &quot;Mémoire sur le science de l&#x27;homme&quot;. However, by 1814, having no teaching position he accepted a position as Saint-Simon&#x27;s secretary. He collaborated with Saint-Simon on &quot;De la réorganisation de la société européenne&quot; – a tract calling for the unification of Europe on the basis of a single constitution. However, by 1817 Thierry relinquished this position to Auguste Comte. But whereas most of Saint-Simon&#x27;s followers applied his theories to present-day matters of political economy, Thierry trod an independent path and turned to history instead.

Thierry was also inspired by Romantic literature, such as Chateaubriand&#x27;s &quot;Les Martyrs&quot;, and Walter Scott&#x27;s novels. Though Thierry did not actually write romances, his conception of history recognised the dramatic element (for instance, &quot;Les Martyrs&quot; dramatises the clash of the Roman Empire with Early Christianity).

Thierry&#x27;s main ideas on the Germanic invasions, the Norman Conquest, the formation of the Communes, the gradual ascent of the nations towards free government and parliamentary institutions, are set forth in the articles he contributed to the &quot;Censeur européen&quot; (1817–20), and later in his &quot;Lettres sur l&#x27;histoire de France&quot; (1820). From Claude Charles Fauriel he learned to use primary sources; and by the aid of the Latin chronicles and the collection of Anglo-Saxon laws, he wrote &quot;Histoire de la Conquête de l&#x27;Angleterre par les Normands&quot; (History of the Conquest of England by the Normans), the appearance of which was greeted with great enthusiasm (1825). It was written in a style at once precise and picturesque, and was dominated by a theory of Anglo-Saxon liberty resisting the invasions of northern barbarians, and eventually reviving in the parliamentary monarchy. Notably, it is in this work that Thierry voices the belief that Robin Hood was a leader of the Anglo-Saxon resistance. His artistic talent as a writer makes the weaknesses and deficiencies of his scholarship less obvious. This work, the preparation of which had required several years of hard work, cost Thierry his eyesight; in 1826 he was obliged to engage secretaries and eventually became quite blind. Notwithstanding, he continued to write.

In 1827, he republished his &quot;Lettres sur l&#x27;histoire de France&quot;, with the addition of fifteen new ones, in which he described some of the more striking episodes in the history of the rise of the medieval communes. The chronicles of the 11th and 12th centuries and a few communal charters provided him with materials for a solid work. For this reason his work on the communes has not become so out of date as his Norman Conquest; but he was too apt to generalise from the facts furnished by a few striking cases which occurred in a small portion of France, and helped to spread among the public, and even among professional historians, mistaken ideas concerning one of the most complex problems relating to the social origins of France.

Thierry ardently supported the July Revolution and the triumph of liberal ideas; at this time, too, his brother Amédée was appointed prefect, and he went to live with him for four years. He now re-edited, under the title of &quot;Dix ans d&#x27;études historiques&quot;, his first essays in the &quot;Censeur européen&quot; and &quot;Le Courrier français&quot; (1834), and composed his &quot;Récits des temps mérovingiens&quot;, in which he vividly presented some of the stories of Gregory of Tours. These &quot;Récits&quot; appeared first in the &quot;Revue des deux mondes&quot;; when collected in volume form, they were preceded by long &quot;Considerations sur l&#x27;histoire de France&quot;.

From 7 May 1830, Thierry had already been a member of the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles Lettres; in 1841, on the motion of Villemain, the Académie française awarded him the first Prix Gobert. He continued to receive this prize for the next fifteen years. Moreover, he had been asked to edit a volume of the series &quot;Documents inédits&quot; containing a selection of acts bearing on the history of the Third Estate. Helped by collaborators (including Bourquelot and Louandre) he compiled, in four volumes, &quot;Recueil des monuments inédits de l&#x27;histoire du Tiers Etat&quot; (1850–70), which, however, bear only on the northern part of France. The preface appeared afterwards in a separate volume under the title of &quot;Histoire du Tiers Etat&quot;.

==Later years and legacy==
To Thierry belongs the credit for inaugurating in France the really critical study of the communal institutions. The last years of his life were clouded by domestic griefs and by illness. In 1844 he lost his wife, Julie de Querengal, who had been a capable and devoted collaborator in his studies. The Revolution of 1848 inflicted on him a final blow by overturning the regime of the Liberal bourgeoisie, whose triumph he had hailed and justified as the necessary outcome of the whole course of French history. Thierry began to abandon the strict rationalism that had hitherto estranged him from the Catholic Church. When Catholic writers criticised the &quot;historical errors&quot; in his writings he promised to correct them, and in the final edition of his &quot;Histoire de la Conquête&quot; his severe judgments of Vatican policies are eliminated. Though he did not renounce his liberal friends, he sought the company of enlightened priests, and just before his death seems disposed to reentering the Church. He died in Paris in 1856.

<text>The many-minds interpretation of quantum mechanics extends the many-worlds interpretation by proposing that the distinction between worlds should be made at the level of the mind of an individual observer. The concept was first introduced in 1970 by H. Dieter Zeh as a variant of the Hugh Everett interpretation in connection with quantum decoherence, and later (in 1981) explicitly called a many or multi-consciousness interpretation. The name &quot;many-minds interpretation&quot; was first used by David Albert and Barry Loewer in 1988.

==History==

===Interpretations of quantum mechanics===

The various interpretations of quantum mechanics typically involve explaining the mathematical formalism of quantum mechanics, or to create a physical picture of the theory. While the mathematical structure has a strong foundation, there is still much debate about the physical and philosophical interpretation of the theory. These interpretations aim to tackle various concepts such as:

# Evolution of the state of a quantum system (given by the wavefunction), typically through the use of the Schrödinger equation. This concept is almost universally accepted, and is rarely put to debate.
# The measurement problem, which relates to what is called wavefunction collapse – the collapse of a quantum state into a definite measurement (i.e. a specific eigenstate of the wavefunction). The debate on whether this collapse actually occurs is a central problem in interpreting quantum mechanics.

The standard solution to the measurement problem is the &quot;Orthodox&quot; or &quot;Copenhagen&quot; interpretation, which claims that the wave function collapses as the result of a measurement by an observer or apparatus external to the quantum system. An alternative interpretation, the Many-worlds Interpretation, was first described by Hugh Everett in 1957 (where it was called the relative state interpretation, the name &quot;Many-worlds&quot; was coined by Bryce Seligman DeWitt starting in the 1960s and finalized in the 1970s). His formalism of quantum mechanics denied that a measurement requires a wave collapse, instead suggesting that all that is truly necessary of a measurement is that a quantum connection is formed between the particle, the measuring device, and the observer.

===The many-worlds interpretation===
In the original relative state formulation, Everett proposed that there is one universal wavefunction that describes the objective reality of the whole universe. He stated that when subsystems interact, the total system becomes a superposition of these subsystems. This includes observers and measurement systems, which become part of one universal state (the wavefunction) that is always described via the Schrödinger Equation (or its relativistic alternative). That is, the states of the subsystems that interacted become &quot;entangled&quot; in such a way that any definition of one must necessarily involve the other. Thus, each subsystem&#x27;s state can only be described relative to each subsystem with which it interacts (hence the name relative state).

Everett suggested that the universe is actually indeterminate as a whole. For example, consider an observer measuring some particle that starts in an undetermined state, as &quot;both&quot; spin-up &quot;and&quot; spin-down, that is – a superposition of both possibilities. When an observer measures that particle&#x27;s spin, however, it always registers as &quot;either&quot; up &quot;or&quot; down. The problem of how to understand this sudden shift from &quot;both up and down&quot; to &quot;either up or down&quot; is called the Measurement problem. According to the many-worlds interpretation, the act of measurement forced a “splitting” of the universe into two states, one spin-up and the other spin-down, and the two branches that extend from those two subsequently independent states. One branch measures up. The other measures down. Looking at the instrument informs the observer which branch he is on, but the system itself is indeterminate at this and, by logical extension, presumably any higher level.

The “worlds” in the many worlds theory is then just the complete measurement history up until and during the measurement in question, where splitting happens. These “worlds” each describe a different state of the universal wave function and cannot communicate. There is no collapse of the wavefunction into one state or another, but rather an observer finds itself in the world leading up to what measurement it has made and is unaware of the other possibilities that are equally real.

===The many-minds interpretation===
The many-minds interpretation of quantum theory is many-worlds with the distinction between worlds constructed at the level of the individual observer. Rather than the worlds that branch, it is the observer&#x27;s mind that branches.

The problem with this interpretation is that it implies the observer must be in a superposition with herself, and that seems strange. In their 1988 paper, Albert and Loewer argued that the mind of an observer cannot be in an indefinite state because an observer must answer the question about which state of a system he has observed with complete certainty. If the observer&#x27;s mind were in a superposition of states, then it could not attain such certainty. To overcome this contradiction, they suggest that a mind must always be in a definite state and only the “bodies” of the minds are in a superposition.

Accordingly, when an observer measures a quantum system and becomes entangled with it, the result is a larger quantum system. In regards to each possibility within this greater wave function, a mental state of the brain corresponds. Ultimately, only one of these mental states is experienced, leading the others to branch off and become inaccessible, albeit real. In this way, every sentient being possesses an infinity of minds, whose prevalence correspond to the amplitude of the wavefunction. As an observer checks a measurement, the probability of realizing a specific measurement directly correlates to the number of minds they have where they see that measurement. It is in this way that the probabilistic nature of quantum measurements are obtained by the Many-minds Interpretation.

==Quantum non-locality in the many-minds interpretation==
Consider an experiment that measures the polarization of two photons. When the photon is created, it has an indeterminate polarization. If a stream of these photons is passed through a polarization filter, 50% of the light is passed through. This corresponds to each photon having a 50% chance of aligning with the filter and thus passing, or being misaligned (by 90 degrees relative to the polarization filter) and being absorbed. Quantum mechanically, this means the photon is in a superposition of states where it is either passed or absorbed. Now, consider the inclusion of another photon and polarization detector. Now, the photons are created in such a way that they are entangled. That is, when one photon takes on a polarization state, the other photon will always behave as if it has the same polarization. For simplicity, take the second filter to either be perfectly aligned with the first, or to be perfectly misaligned (90 degree difference in angle, such that it is absorbed). If the detectors are aligned, both photons are passed (i.e. they are said to &quot;agree&quot;). If they are misaligned, only the first passes and the second is absorbed (now they &quot;disagree&quot;). Thus, the entanglement causes perfect correlations between the two measurements – regardless of separation distance, making the interaction non-local. This sort of experiment is further explained in Tim Maudlin&#x27;s &quot;Quantum Non-Locality and Relativity&quot;, and can be related to Bell test experiments. Now, consider the analysis of this experiment from the many minds point of view:

===No sentient observer===
Consider the case where there is no sentient observer, i.e. no mind present to observe the experiment. In this case, the detector will be in an indefinite state. The photon is both passed and absorbed, and will remain in this state. The correlations are withheld in that none of the possible &quot;minds&quot;, or wave function states, correspond to non correlated results.

===One sentient observer===
Now expand the situation to have one sentient being observing the device. Now, they too enter the indefinite state. Their eyes, body, and brain are seeing both spins at the same time. The mind however, stochastically chooses one of the directions, and that is what the mind sees. When this observer views the second detector, their body will see both results. Their mind will choose the result that agrees with the first detector, and the observer will see the expected results. However, the observer&#x27;s mind seeing one result does not directly affect the distant state – there is just no wave function in which the expected correlations do not exist. The true correlation only happens when they actually view the second detector.

===Two sentient observers===
When two people look at two different detectors that scan entangled particles, both observers will enter an indefinite state, as with one observer. These results need not agree – the second observer&#x27;s mind does not have to have results that correlate with the first&#x27;s. When one observer tells the results to the second observer, their two minds cannot communicate and thus will only interact with the other&#x27;s body, which is still indefinite. When the second observer responds, his body will respond with whatever result agrees with the first observer&#x27;s mind. This means that both observer&#x27;s minds will be in a state of the wavefunction that always get the expected results, but individually their results could be different.

===Non-locality of the many-minds interpretation===
As we have thus seen, any correlations seen in the wavefunction of each observer&#x27;s minds are only concrete after interaction between the different polarizers. The correlations on the level of individual minds correspond to the appearance of quantum non-locality (or equivalently, violation of Bell&#x27;s inequality). So the many world is non-local, or it cannot explain EPR-GHZ correlations.

==Support==
There is currently no empirical evidence for the many-minds interpretation. However, there are theories that do not discredit the many-minds interpretation. In light of Bell&#x27;s analysis of the consequences of quantum non-locality, empirical evidence is needed to avoid inventing novel fundamental concepts (hidden variables). Two different solutions of the measurement problem then appear conceivable: von Neumann&#x27;s collapse or Everett&#x27;s relative state interpretation. In both cases a (suitably modified) psycho-physical parallelism can be re-established.

If neural processes can be described and analyzed then some experiments could potentially be created to test whether affecting neural processes can have an effect on a quantum system. Speculation about the details of this awareness-local physical system coupling on a purely theoretical basis could occur, however experimentally searching for them through neurological and psychological studies would be ideal.

==Objections==
Nothing within quantum theory itself requires each possibility within a wave function to complement a mental state. As all physical states (i.e. brain states) are quantum states, their associated mental states should be also. Nonetheless, it is not what one experiences within physical reality. Albert and Loewer argue that the mind must be intrinsically different than the physical reality as described by quantum theory. Thereby, they reject type-identity physicalism in favour of a non-reductive stance. However, Lockwood saves materialism through the notion of supervenience of the mental on the physical.

Nonetheless, the many-minds interpretation does not solve the mindless hulks problem as a problem of supervenience. Mental states do not supervene on brain states as a given brain state is compatible with different configurations of mental states.

Another serious objection is that workers in no collapse interpretations have produced no more than elementary models based on the definite existence of specific measuring devices. They have assumed, for example, that the Hilbert space of the universe splits naturally into a tensor product structure compatible with the measurement under consideration. They have also assumed, even when describing the behaviour of macroscopic objects, that it is appropriate to employ models in which only a few dimensions of Hilbert space are used to describe all the relevant behaviour.

Furthermore, as the many-minds interpretation is corroborated by our experience of physical reality, a notion of many unseen worlds and its compatibility with other physical theories (i.e. the principle of the conservation of mass) is difficult to reconcile. According to Schrödinger&#x27;s equation, the mass-energy of the combined observed system and measurement apparatus is the same before and after. However, with every measurement process (i.e. splitting), the total mass-energy would seemingly increase.

Peter J. Lewis argues that the many-minds interpretation of quantum mechanics has absurd implications for agents facing life-or-death decisions.

In general, the many-minds theory holds that a conscious being who observes the outcome of a random zero-sum experiment will evolve into two successors in different observer states, each of whom observes one of the possible outcomes. Moreover, the theory advises one to favour choices in such situations in proportion to the probability that they will bring good results to one&#x27;s various successors. But in a life-or-death case like an observer getting into the box with Schrödinger&#x27;s cat, the observer will only have one successor, since one of the outcomes will ensure the observers death. So it seems that the many-minds interpretation advises one to get in the box with the cat, since it is certain that one&#x27;s only successor will emerge unharmed. See also quantum suicide and immortality.

Finally, it supposes that there is some physical distinction between a conscious observer and a non-conscious measuring device, so it seems to require eliminating the strong Church–Turing hypothesis or postulating a physical model for consciousness.

<text>Amédée Simon Dominique Thierry (2 August 1797, Blois, Loir-et-Cher27 March 1873, Paris), French journalist and historian, was the younger brother of Augustin.

== Biography ==
Amédée Thierry began life as a journalist (after an essay, like his brother, at schoolmastering). Connected with the romantic harbinger &quot;Globe&quot;, he obtained a small government clerkship. His first book was a brief history of Guienne in 1825, and three years later appeared the first volume of the &quot;Histoire des Gaulois&quot;, which was received with much favour, and obtained him, from the royalist premier Martignac, a history professorship at Besançon. He was, however, thought too liberal for the government of Charles X, and his lectures were stopped, with the result of securing him, after the revolution, the important post of prefect of the Haute-Saône, which he held eight years.

During this time he published nothing. In 1838 he was transferred to the council of state as master of requests, which post he held through the revolution of 1848 and the &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; till 1860, when he was made senator—a paid office, it must be remembered, and, in effect, a lucrative sinecure. He also passed through all the ranks of the Legion of Honour, became a member of the &quot;Academie des Inscriptions&quot; in 1841, and in 1862 received the honorary degree of D.C.L. at Oxford. He had, except during the time of his prefecture, never intermitted his literary work, being a constant contributor to the &quot;Revue des deux mondes&quot;, his articles (usually worked up afterwards into books) almost all dealing with Roman Gaul and its period.

== Works ==
*&quot;Histoire des Gaulois&quot;, 3 vols. (1828, 1834, 1845; the 8th edition of vol. i. appeared in 1870)
*&quot;Histoire de la Gaule sous l&#x27;administration romaine&quot; (3 vols., 1840–47; 2nd ed. 1871)
*&quot;Histoire d&#x27;Attila, de ses fils et successeurs jusqu&#x27;à l&#x27;établissement des Hongrois en Europe&quot; (1856; 5th ed. in 1874)
*&quot;Tableau de l&#x27;Empire romain&quot; (1862; 5th ed. in 1871; now quite out of date)
*&quot;Récits de l&#x27;histoire romaine au Ve siecle: la lutte contre les Barbares, et les luttes religieuses&quot; (1860; 2nd ed. in 6 vols. 1880).

His son, Gilbert Augustin Thierry (1843–1915), who began a literary career by articles on &quot;Les Révolutions d&#x27;Angleterre&quot; (1864) and some &quot;Essais d&#x27;histoire religieuse&quot; (1867), afterwards confined himself to the writing of novels.

The journalist and writer Charles Canivet was his secretary.

<doc id="199956" wikidata="Q553864" url="?curid=199956" title="Robert Catesby">
<text>Robert Catesby ( – 8 November 1605) was the leader of a group of English Catholics who planned the failed Gunpowder Plot of 1605. Born in Warwickshire, Catesby was educated at Oxford University. His family were prominent recusant Catholics, and presumably to avoid swearing the Oath of Supremacy he left college before taking his degree. He married a Protestant in 1593 and fathered two children, one of whom survived birth and was baptised in a Protestant church. In 1601 he took part in the Essex Rebellion but was captured and fined, after which he sold his estate at Chastleton.

The Protestant James I, who became King of England in 1603, was less tolerant of Catholics than many persecuted Recusants had hoped. Catesby therefore planned a decapitation strike which he considered tyrannicide, aimed at the Government of England; by blowing up the King and the House of Lords with gunpowder during the State Opening of Parliament. The assassination of the King was to be the prelude to a popular uprising aimed at regime change, through which a Catholic monarch would be seated upon the English throne. Early in 1604, Catesby began to recruit other Catholics to his cause, including Thomas Wintour, John Wright, Thomas Percy, and Guy Fawkes. Over the following months, Fawkes helped to recruit a further eight conspirators into the plot, which, against the pleas of underground Jesuit superior Fr. Henry Garnet to cancel the plot, was scheduled to be carried out on 5 November 1605. Concerns about possible collateral damage caused an anonymous letter of warning to be sent to William Parker, 4th Baron Monteagle, who alerted the authorities. On the night before the planned explosion, Fawkes was arrested underneath the House of Parliament while guarding 38 barrels of gunpowder. News of his arrest caused the other plotters to flee London, warning Catesby along their way.

With a much-diminished group of followers, Catesby made a last stand at Holbeche House in Staffordshire (the modern-day Kingswinford suburb of Wall Heath), against a 200-strong Sheriff&#x27;s posse led by Richard Walsh. Catesby was mortally wounded by gunfire and later found dead inside Holbeche Hall, where he had died while contemplating a holy card of the Virgin Mary. As a warning to other potential regicides, Catesby&#x27;s body was exhumed, posthumously executed, and his severed head on a spike was displayed outside the Houses of Parliament.

==Early life==
===Origins===

He was born after 1572, the third and only surviving son and heir of Sir William Catesby of Lapworth in Warwickshire, by his wife Anne Throckmorton, a daughter of Sir Robert Throckmorton (c.1513–1581), KG, of Coughton Court in Warwickshire (by his second wife, Elizabeth Hussey). He was a lineal descendant of William Catesby (1450–1485), the influential councillor of King Richard III who was captured at the Battle of Bosworth and executed. His parents were prominent recusant Catholics; his father had suffered years of imprisonment for his faith, and in 1581 had been tried in Star Chamber alongside William Vaux, 3rd Baron Vaux of Harrowden, and his brother-in-law Sir Thomas Tresham, for harbouring the Jesuit priest Edmund Campion. The head of the Throckmortons, Sir Thomas Throckmorton, was also fined for his recusancy, and spent many years in prison. Another relation, Sir Francis Throckmorton, had been executed in 1584 for his involvement in a plot to free Mary, Queen of Scots.

===Education===
In 1586 Robert was educated at Gloucester Hall in Oxford, a college noted for its Catholic intake. Those either studying at university or wishing to take public office could not do so without first swearing the Oath of Supremacy, an act which would have compromised Catesby&#x27;s Catholic faith. Presumably to avoid this consequence, he left without taking his degree, and may then have attended the seminary college of Douai.

In 1588, at the time of the Spanish Armada, Robert was allegedly imprisoned at Wisbech Castle along with Francis Tresham.

===Adulthood===
On 8 May 1592 he married Katherine Leigh, daughter of Sir Thomas Leigh of Stoneleigh Abbey in Warwickshire (1530–1626) and Katherine Spencer (1544–1626), and granddaughter of Sir Thomas Leigh of Stoneleigh Abbey and his wife Alice Barker, sometimes known as Coverdale, who was an heiress, thanks to her uncle Sir Rowland Hill, publisher of the Geneva Bible.

Katherine came from wealthy and respected Protestant dynasties and brought with her a dowry of £2,000, but also a religious association that offered Robert some respite from the recusancy laws then in effect.

On the death of his grandmother Katherine the following year he came into the family property at Chastleton, in Oxfordshire. The couple&#x27;s first son William died in infancy, but their second son Robert survived, and was baptised at Chastleton&#x27;s Anglican parish church on 11 November 1595. When Catesby&#x27;s father died in 1598, his estates at Ashby St Ledgers were left to his wife for life, while Catesby and his family remained at Chastleton. Catesby had seemed happy to remain a Church Papist but after his wife&#x27;s death later that year he further embraced Catholicism.

In 1601 Catesby was involved in Essex&#x27;s Rebellion. The Earl of Essex&#x27;s purpose might have lain in furthering his own interests rather than those of the Catholic Church, but Catesby hoped that if Essex succeeded, there might once more be a Catholic monarch. The rebellion was a failure, however, and the wounded Catesby was captured, imprisoned at the Wood Street Counter, and fined 4,000 marks (approximately ) by Elizabeth I. Sir Thomas Tresham helped pay some of Catesby&#x27;s fine, following which Catesby sold his estate at Chastleton. Several authors speculate about Catesby&#x27;s movements as Elizabeth&#x27;s health grew worse; he was probably among those &quot;principal papists&quot; imprisoned by a government fearing open rebellion, and in March 1603 he possibly sent Christopher Wright to Spain to see if Philip III would continue to support English Catholics after Elizabeth&#x27;s death. Catesby funded the activities of some Jesuit priests, and while visiting them made occasional use of the alias Mr Roberts.

==Gunpowder Plot==
===Background===
Catholics had hoped that the persecution they suffered during Elizabeth&#x27;s reign would end when she was succeeded in 1603 by James I. His mother, Mary, Queen of Scots (executed in 1587), had been a devout Catholic, and James&#x27;s attitude appeared moderate, even tolerant towards Catholics. Protestant rulers across Europe had, however, been the target of several assassination attempts during the late 16th century, and until the 1620s some English Catholics believed that regicide was justifiable to remove &#x27;tyrants&#x27; from power. Much of James&#x27;s political writing was concerned with such matters, and the &quot;refutation of the [Catholic] argument that &#x27;faith did not need to be kept with heretics. Shortly after he discovered that his wife Anne – who had been raised Lutheran and had abstained from the Anglican communion at her English coronation – had been sent a rosary from Pope Clement VIII, James exiled all Jesuits and other Catholic priests, and reimposed the collection of anti-Catholic fines. Catesby soon began to lose patience with the new dynasty.

British author and historian Antonia Fraser describes Catesby&#x27;s mentality as &quot;that of the crusader who does not hesitate to employ the sword in the cause of values which he considers are spiritual&quot;. Writing after the events of 1604–1606, the Jesuit priest Father Tesimond&#x27;s description of his friend was favourable: &quot;his countenance was exceedingly noble and expressive ... his conversation and manners were peculiarly attractive and imposing, and that by the dignity of his character he exercised an irresistible influence over the minds of those who associated with him.&quot; Fellow conspirator Ambrose Rookwood, shortly before his own death, said that he &quot;loved and respected him [Catesby] as his own life&quot;, while Catesby&#x27;s friend, Father John Gerard, claimed he was &quot;respected in all companies of such as are counted there swordsmen or men of action&quot;, and that &quot;few were in the opinions of most men preferred before him and he increased much his acquaintance and friends.&quot; Author Mark Nicholls suggests that &quot;bitterness at the failure of Essex&#x27;s design nevertheless seems to have sharpened an already well-honed neurosis.&quot;

===Early stages===

Despite the ease with which Catesby seems to have inspired his fellow conspirators, that it was he and not Fawkes (today most often associated with 5 November) who devised what became known as the Gunpowder Plot has largely been forgotten. The precise date on which he set events in motion is unknown, but he first likely had the idea early in 1604. Sometime around June of the previous year he was visited by his friend Thomas Percy. A great-grandson of the 4th Earl of Northumberland, Percy was reported to have had a &quot;wild youth&quot; before he became a Catholic, and during Elizabeth&#x27;s final years had been entrusted by the 9th Earl with a secret mission to James&#x27;s court in Scotland, to plead with the king on behalf of England&#x27;s Catholics. He now complained bitterly about what he considered to be James&#x27;s treachery and threatened to kill him. Catesby replied, &quot;No, no, Tom, thou shalt not venture to small purpose, but if thou wilt is a traitor thou shalt be to some great advantage.&quot; Percy listened while Catesby added, &quot;I am thinking of the surest way and I will soon let thee know what it is.&quot; During Allhallowtide on 31 October he sent for his cousin Thomas Wintour, who was at Huddington Court in Worcestershire with his brother Robert. Thomas was educated as a lawyer and had fought for England in the Low Countries, but in 1600 had converted to Catholicism. Following the Earl of Essex&#x27;s failed rebellion, he had travelled to Spain to raise support for English Catholics, a mission which the authorities would later describe as comprising part of a &#x27;Spanish Treason&#x27;. Although Thomas declined his invitation, Catesby again invited him in February the next year.

When Wintour responded to the summons he found his cousin with the swordsman John Wright. Catesby told him of his plan to kill the king and his government by blowing up &quot;the Parliament House with Gunpowder ... in that place have they done us all the mischief, and perchance God hath designed that place for their punishment&quot;. Wintour at first objected to his cousin&#x27;s scheme, but Catesby, who said that &quot;the nature of the disease required so sharp a remedy&quot;, won him over. Despite Catholic Spain&#x27;s moves toward diplomacy with England, Catesby still harboured hopes of foreign support and a peaceful solution. Wintour, therefore, returned to the continent, where he tried unsuccessfully to persuade the affable Constable of Castile to press for good terms for English Catholics in forthcoming peace negotiations. He then turned to Sir William Stanley, an English Catholic and veteran commander who had switched sides from England to Spain, and the exiled Welsh spy Hugh Owen; both cast doubt on the plotters&#x27; chances of receiving Spanish support. Owen did, however, introduce Wintour to Guy Fawkes, whose name Catesby had already supplied as &quot;a confidant gentleman&quot; who might enter their ranks. Fawkes was a devout English Catholic who had travelled to the continent to fight for Spain in the Dutch War of Independence. Wintour told him of their plan to &quot;doe somewhat in England if the pece with Spaine helped us nott&quot;, and thus in April 1604 the two men returned home. Wintour told Catesby that despite positive noises from the Spanish, he feared that &quot;the deeds would not answer&quot;. This was a response that in Nicholls&#x27;s opinion came as no surprise to Catesby, who wanted and expected nothing less. 

On Sunday 20 May in the well-to-do Strand district of London, Catesby met Thomas Wintour, John Wright, Thomas Percy and Guy Fawkes, at an inn called the Duck and Drake. Percy had been introduced to the plot several weeks after Wintour and Fawkes&#x27;s return to England. Alone in a private room, all swore an oath of secrecy on a prayer book, and then in another room celebrated Mass with the Jesuit priest (and friend to Catesby) John Gerard. Robert Keyes was admitted to the group in October 1604, and was charged with looking after Catesby&#x27;s Lambeth house, where the gunpowder and other supplies were to be stored. Two months later Catesby recruited his servant, Thomas Bates, into the plot, after the latter accidentally became aware of it, and by March 1605 three more were admitted: Thomas Wintour&#x27;s brother Robert, John Grant and John Wright&#x27;s brother Christopher.

===Further recruitment===
Although the State Opening of Parliament was planned for February 1605, concern over the plague delayed it until 3 October. A contemporaneous government account has the plotters engaged in digging a tunnel beneath Parliament by December 1604, but no other evidence exists to prove this, and no trace of a tunnel has since been found. If the story is true, the plotters ceased their efforts when the tenancy to the undercroft beneath the House of Lords became available. Several months later, early in June 1605, Catesby met the principal Jesuit in England, Father Henry Garnet, on Thames Street in London. While discussing the war in Flanders, Catesby asked about the morality of &quot;killing innocents&quot;. Garnet said that such actions could often be excused, but according to his own account during a second meeting in July he showed Catesby a letter from the pope which forbade rebellion. Catesby replied, &quot;Whatever I mean to do, if the Pope knew, he would not hinder for the general good of our country.&quot; Father Garnet&#x27;s protestations prompted Catesby&#x27;s next reply, &quot;I am not bound to take knowledge by you of the Pope&#x27;s will.&quot; Soon after, Father Tesimond told Father Garnet that while taking Catesby&#x27;s confession he had learned of the plot. Father Garnet met with Catesby a third time on 24 July at White Webbs in Enfield Chase, the home of Catesby&#x27;s wealthy relative Anne Vaux, and a house long suspected by the government of harbouring Jesuit priests. Without acknowledging that he was aware of the precise nature of the plot, the priest tried in vain to dissuade Catesby from his course.
By 20 July 1605, 36 barrels of gunpowder had been stored in the undercroft, but the ever-present threat of the plague yet again prorogued the opening of Parliament, this time until 5 November 1605. Catesby had borne much of the scheme&#x27;s financial cost thus far, and was running out of money. As their plans moved closer to fruition, during a secret meeting at Bath in August at which he, Percy and Thomas Wintour were present, the plotters decided that &quot;the company being yet but few&quot; he was to be allowed to &quot;call in whom he thought best&quot;. Catesby soon added Ambrose Rookwood, a staunch Catholic who was both young and wealthy, but who most importantly owned a stable of fine horses at Coldham. For the plan to work Rookwood and his horses needed to be close to the other conspirators, and so Catesby persuaded him to rent Clopton House at Stratford-upon-Avon. Francis Tresham was brought into the plot on 14 October. Also descended from William Catesby, Tresham was Robert&#x27;s cousin, and as young children the two had often visited White Webbs. Although his account of the meeting is weighted with hindsight (when captured he sought to distance himself from the affair), he asked Catesby what support for the Catholics would be forthcoming once the king had been killed. Catesby&#x27;s answer, &quot;The necessity of the Catholics [was such that] it must needs be done&quot;, in Fraser&#x27;s opinion this demonstrates his unwavering view on the matter, held at least since his first meeting with Thomas Wintour early in 1604. The final conspirator to be brought in was Everard Digby, on 21 October, at Harrowden. Catesby confided in Digby during a delayed Feast of Saint Luke. Like Rookwood, Digby was young and wealthy, and possessed a stable of horses. Catesby told him to rent Coughton Court near Alcester, so that he would &quot;the better to be able to do good to the cause [kidnap Princess Elizabeth]&quot;.

The day after Tresham&#x27;s recruitment, Catesby exchanged greetings in London with Fawkes&#x27;s former employer, Lord Montagu, and asked him &quot;The Parliament, I think, brings your lordship up now?&quot; Montagu told him that he was visiting a relative, and that he would be at Parliament in a few weeks&#x27; time. Catesby replied &quot;I think your Lordship takes no pleasure to be there&quot;. Montague, who had already been imprisoned for speaking out in the House of Lords against anti-Catholic legislation, and who had no inclination to be present while more laws were introduced, agreed. Following the plot&#x27;s failure he became a suspect and was arrested, but after intense lobbying he was released some months later.

The recruitment of Rookwood, Tresham, and Digby coincided with a series of meetings in various taverns across London, during which the last remaining details were worked out. Fawkes would light the fuse, and escape by boat across the Thames. An uprising would start in the Midlands, during which Princess Elizabeth was to be captured. Fawkes would escape to the continent and explain to the Catholic powers what had happened in England.

===Monteagle letter===
Several of the conspirators expressed worries about fellow Catholics who would be caught up in the planned explosion; Percy was concerned for his patron, Northumberland, and when the young Earl of Arundel&#x27;s name was mentioned Catesby suggested that a minor wound might keep him from the chamber on that day. Keyes&#x27;s suggestion to warn the Earl of Peterborough was, however, derided. On 26 October William Parker, 4th Baron Monteagle (Tresham&#x27;s brother-in-law) received an anonymous letter while at his house in Hoxton, warning him not to attend Parliament, and forecasting that &quot;they shall receive a terrible blow this Parliament; and yet they shall not see who hurts them&quot;. Uncertain of its meaning he delivered it to Secretary of State Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury. In an extraordinary act of bravado Catesby had planned to go hunting with James, but was warned of the betrayal by Monteagle&#x27;s servant. He immediately suspected that Tresham was responsible for the letter, a view which was shared by Thomas Wintour. Together the two confronted the recently recruited conspirator, and threatened to &quot;hang him&quot;, but Tresham managed to convince the pair that he had not written the letter, and the next day urged them to abandon the plot.

Catesby waited for Percy&#x27;s return from the north, before making his decision. He thought the letter too vague to constitute any meaningful threat to the plan, and decided to forge ahead. As Fawkes made a final check on the gunpowder, other conspirators took up their positions in the Midlands. Salisbury, already aware of certain stirrings before he received the letter, did not yet know the exact nature of the plot or who exactly was involved. He elected to wait, to see how events unfolded. On 3 November, Catesby met with Wintour and Percy in London. Although the nature of their discussion is unknown, Fraser theorises that some adjustment of their plan to abduct Princess Elizabeth may have occurred, as later accounts told how Percy had been seen at the Duke of York&#x27;s lodgings, enquiring as to the movements of the king&#x27;s daughter. Nicholls mentions that a week earlier—on the same day that Monteagle received his letter—Catesby was at White Webbs with Fawkes, to discuss kidnapping Prince Henry rather than Princess Elizabeth.

==Death==
Late on Monday 4 November, Catesby, John Wright and Bates left for the Midlands, ready for the planned uprising. That night Fawkes was discovered guarding the gunpowder in the undercroft beneath the House of Lords. As news of his arrest spread, the next day most of the conspirators still in London fled. Catesby&#x27;s party, ignorant of what was happening in London, paused at Dunstable when his horse lost a shoe. When Rookwood caught them up and broke to them the news of Fawkes&#x27;s arrest, the group, which now included Rookwood, Catesby, Bates, the Wright brothers and Percy, rode toward Dunchurch. At about 6:00 pm that evening they reached Catesby&#x27;s family home at Ashby St Ledgers, where his mother and Robert Wintour were staying. To keep his mother ignorant of their situation, Catesby sent a message asking Wintour to meet him at the edge of the town. The group continued to Dunchurch, where they met Digby and his hunting party and informed them that the king and Salisbury were dead, thus persuading them to continue with the plan.

On 6 November they raided Warwick Castle for supplies, taking cavalry horses from the stables to aid their escape, before continuing to Norbrook to collect stored weapons. From there they continued their journey to Huddington. Catesby gave Bates a letter to deliver to Father Garnet and the other priests at Coughton Court, informing them of what had transpired, and asking for their help in raising an army in Wales, where Catholic support was believed to be strong. The priest begged Catesby and his followers to stop their &quot;wicked actions&quot;, and to listen to the pope&#x27;s preachings. Father Garnet fled, and managed to evade capture for several weeks. Catesby and the others arrived at Huddington at about 2:00 pm, and were met by Thomas Wintour. Terrified of being associated with the fugitives, family members and former friends showed them no sympathy.
Back in London, under pain of torture Fawkes had started to reveal what he knew, and on 7 November the government named Catesby as a wanted man. Early that morning at Huddington, the remaining outlaws went to confession, before taking the sacrament—in Fraser&#x27;s opinion, a sign that none of them thought they had long to live. The party of fugitives, which included those at the centre of the plot, their supporters and Digby&#x27;s hunting party, by now had dwindled to only thirty-six in number. They continued through pouring rain to Hewell Grange, home of the young Lord Windsor. He was absent however, so they helped themselves to further arms, ammunition, and money. The locals were unsupportive; on hearing that Catesby&#x27;s party stood for &quot;God and Country&quot;, they replied that they were for &quot;King James as well as God and Country&quot;. The party reached Holbeche House, on the Staffordshire boundary, at about 10:00 pm. Tired and desperate, they spread in front of the fire some of the wet gunpowder taken from Hewell Grange, to dry out. Although gunpowder does not explode (unless physically contained), a spark from the fire landed on the powder and the resultant flames engulfed Catesby, Rookwood, Grant, and another man.
Catesby survived, albeit scorched. Digby left, ostensibly to give himself up, as did John Wintour. Thomas Bates fled, along with Robert Wintour. Remaining were Catesby (described as &quot;reasonably well&quot;), Rookwood, the Wright brothers, Percy and John Grant, who had been so badly injured that his eyes were &quot;burnt out&quot;. They resolved to stay in the house and wait for the arrival of the king&#x27;s men. Catesby, believing his death to be near, kissed the gold crucifix he wore around his neck and said he had given everything for &quot;the honour of the Cross&quot;. He refused to be taken prisoner, &quot;against that only he would defend himself with his sword&quot;.

Richard Walsh, Sheriff of Worcester, and his company of 200 men besieged Holbeche House at about 11:00 am on 8 November. While crossing the courtyard Thomas Wintour was hit in the shoulder. John Wright was shot, followed by his brother, and then Rookwood. Catesby and Percy were reportedly both dropped by a single lucky shot, while standing near the door. Catesby managed to crawl inside the house, where his body was later found, clutching a picture of the Virgin Mary. This and his gold crucifix were sent to London, to demonstrate what &quot;superstitious and Popish idols&quot; had inspired the plotters. The survivors were taken into custody and the dead buried near Holbeche. On the orders of the Earl of Northampton, the bodies of Catesby and Percy were exhumed and decapitated. John Harington made an opportune study of the heads while &quot;en route&quot; to London, and later reflected: &quot;more terrible countenances were never looked upon&quot;. Placed on &quot;the side of the Parliament House&quot;, Catesby&#x27;s head on a spike became one of the &quot;sightless spectators of their own failure&quot;. Catesby and the other plotters were declared guilty by an Act of Attainder passed by Parliament in 1605 (without a trial). All their property was thus forfeit to the Crown and could not be passed by will. Robert Catesby&#x27;s mother Anne was able to remain in Ashby St Legers due to her life interest, but after her death that property also passed to James I.

==Notable relatives==
Modern actor and producer Kit Harington is reputed to be a direct descendant of Robert Catesby, but others report the direct line died out with the younger Robert Catesby. He, along with co-creators Ronan Bennett and Daniel West, produced a three-part dramatization called &quot;Gunpowder&quot; with the BBC delving into his ancestor&#x27;s role as the mastermind of the Gunpowder Plot, with Harington himself starring as Catesby.

==In popular culture==

Nicola Cornick&#x27;s novel &quot;The Winter Garden&quot; (HarperCollins, 2022) is a time slip novel in which Catesby and his wife and mother are characters.

<doc id="199958" wikidata="Q724736" url="?curid=199958" title="V engine">
<text>A V engine, sometimes called a Vee engine, is a common configuration for internal combustion engines. It consists of two cylinder banks—usually with the same number of cylinders in each bank—connected to a common crankshaft. These cylinder banks are arranged at an angle to each other, so that the banks form a &quot;V&quot; shape when viewed from the front of the engine.

V engines typically have a shorter length than equivalent inline engines, however the trade-off is a larger width. V6, V8 and V12 engines are the most common layout for automobile engines with 6, 8 or 12 cylinders respectively.

==History==
The first V engine, a two-cylinder V-twin, was designed by Wilhelm Maybach and used in the 1889 Daimler Stahlradwagen automobile.

The first V8 engine was produced in 1903, in the form of the Antoinette engine designed by Léon Levavasseur for racing boats and airplanes. The first V12 engine was produced the following year by Putney Motor Works in London, again for use in racing boats. The first V6 engine to reach production appeared soon after in 1908, by the Deutz Gasmotoren Fabrik in Germany for use as a generator for gasoline-electric railway engines. However, it was not until 1950 that the V6 engine was used in series production automobiles, with the first example being the Lancia V6 engine. This V6 engine used a 60-degree V angle and separate crankpins for each cylinder, to reduce the vibration issues experienced by earlier attempts at production V6 engines.

==Characteristics==
Compared with an equivalent inline engine (the most common configuration for engines with less than six cylinders), a V engine has a shorter length but is wider. This effect increases with the number of cylinders in the engine; the length difference between V-twin and straight-twin engines might be insignificant, however V8 engines have a significantly smaller length than straight engines. Compared with the less common flat engine, a V engine is narrower, taller and has a higher center of mass.
The &quot;V-angle&quot; (or &quot;included angle&quot;) between the cylinder banks varies significantly between engines. Some engines have used a V-angle of 180 degrees (the same angle as a flat engine), such as several Ferrari V12 engines. At the other end of the scale, the 1922-1976 Lancia V4 engine and the 1991–present Volkswagen VR6 engine use V-angles as small as 10 degrees, along with a single cylinder head used by both banks of cylinders.

The engine balance of a V12 engine is that of perfect primary and secondary balance. For V engines with fewer cylinders, the engine balance will depend on factors such as the firing interval, crankshaft counterweights and whether balance shafts are present.

The crankpins on a V engine are usually shared by two cylinders from opposing banks, with an offset between the two cylinders. Alternative configurations are separate crankpins per cylinder (such as several V-twin engines) or articulated connecting rods.

=== Inverted engines ===
Some airplanes of the 1920s and 1930s used inverted engines, whereby the crankshaft is located at the top of the engine and the cylinder heads are at the bottom. Advantages include better visibility in a single-engined airplane, a higher thrust line, and resultant increased ground clearance for the propeller. Examples include the 1928 Argus As 10 V8 engine and the 1935 Daimler-Benz DB 601 V12 engines.
==Specific configurations==

It is common practice for V engines to be described with &quot;V&quot;#&quot;&quot; notation, where &quot;#&quot; represents the number of cylinders. Configurations of V engines which have reached production are as follows:

*V-twin (also known as &quot;V2&quot;)

<text>Alternating caps, also known as studly caps, sticky caps (where &quot;caps&quot; is short for capital letters), or  (in reference to the &quot;Mocking Spongebob&quot; internet meme) is a form of text notation in which the capitalization of letters varies by some pattern, or arbitrarily (often also omitting spaces between words and occasionally some letters). An example of this would be spelling &quot;alternating caps&quot; as &quot;aLtErNaTiNg CaPs&quot;.

== History ==
According to the Jargon File, the origin and significance of the practice is obscure. The term &quot;alternating case&quot; has been used as early as the 1970s, in several studies on word identification.

Arbitrary variation found popularity among adolescent users during the BBS and early WWW eras of online culture, as if in parody of the marginally less idiosyncratic capitalization found in common trade and service marks of the time. This method was extensively used since the 1980s in the BBS-world and warez scene (for example in FILE_ID.DIZ and .nfo files) to show &quot;elite&quot; (or elitist) attitude, the often used variant was using small-caps vowels and capitalised consonants (&quot;THiS iS aN eXCePTioNaLLy eLiTe SeNTeNCe.&quot;) or reversed capitals (&quot;eXTENDED kEY gENERATOR pRO&quot;).
The iNiQUiTY BBS software based on Renegade had a feature to support two variants of this automatically: either all vowels would be uppercase or all vowels would be lowercase, with the consonants as the other case.

A meme known as &quot;Mocking SpongeBob&quot; more broadly popularized using alternating caps to convey a mocking tone starting in May 2017, leading to alternating caps becoming a mainstream method of conveying mockery in text.

== Usage and effect ==

Alternating caps are typically used to display mockery in text messages.

The randomized capitalization leads to the flow of words being broken, making it harder for the text to be read as it disrupts word identification even when the size of the letters is the same as in uppercase or lowercase.

Unlike the use of all-lowercase letters, which suggests laziness as a motivation, alternating caps requires additional effort to type, either by holding and releasing the shift key with one hand while hunting-and-pecking, by intermittently pressing one shift key or the other while touch typing, or by using an online tool to convert existing text.

<doc id="199961" wikidata="Q175632" url="?curid=199961" title="Nuneaton">
<text>Nuneaton ( ) is a market town in Warwickshire, England, close to the county border with Leicestershire to the north-east. Nuneaton&#x27;s population at the 2021 census was 88,813, making it the largest town in Warwickshire. Nuneaton&#x27;s urban area, which also includes the large villages of Bulkington and Hartshill, had a population of 99,372 at the 2021 census.

Nuneaton gained its name from a medieval nunnery which was established in the 12th century, when it became a small market town. It later developed into an important industrial town due to ribbon weaving and coal mining.

The author George Eliot was born on a farm on the Arbury Estate just outside Nuneaton in 1819 and lived in the town for much of her early life. Her novel &quot;Scenes of Clerical Life&quot; (1858) depicts Nuneaton. The George Eliot Hospital is named after her, and there is also a statue of her in the town centre.

==History==
===Early history===

Nuneaton was originally an Anglo-Saxon settlement known as &#x27;Etone&#x27; or &#x27;Eaton&#x27;, which translates literally as &#x27;settlement by water&#x27;, referring to the River Anker. &#x27;Etone&#x27; was listed in the Domesday Book as a small farming settlement with a population of around 150. In the early 12th century, the settlement came under the control of the Beaumont family, and in around 1155 Robert de Beaumont granted his manor of Etone to the French Abbey of Fontevraud, who established a Benedictine nunnery here, which became known as Nuneaton Priory. This led to Etone becoming known as Nuneaton. A document from 1272 referred to the town as &quot;Nunne Eton&quot;. The nunnery was closed in 1539 during King Henry VIII&#x27;s dissolution of the monasteries, and subsequently fell into ruin. However part of the Abbey church was rebuilt in the 19th and early 20th centuries.

Nuneaton obtained a market charter in around 1160 from Henry II which was reconfirmed in 1226, causing Nuneaton to develop into a market town and become the economic focal point of the local villages.

In 1485, the Battle of Bosworth, the last significant battle of the Wars of the Roses, was fought around to the north-west of Nuneaton, across the border in nearby Leicestershire.

King Edward VI School was established in 1552 by a royal charter by King Edward VI. The school was originally a fee-paying school, although the county council provided some scholarships, and became non-fee-paying as a result of the Education Act of 1944. The voluntary aided school had around 400 boys in the 1960s. In 1974 the grammar school closed and was re-established as a sixth form college.

In 1543, Nuneaton was recorded as containing 169 houses, with a population of around 800. By 1670 this had grown to 415 households, with a population of 1,867, and by 1740 the population had risen further to 2,480.

===The growth of industry===
====Ribbon weaving====
In the mid-17th century, a silk ribbon weaving industry became established in the local area which included Nuneaton, Bedworth, Coventry and much of North Warwickshire. This industry was enhanced by the arrival of French Huguenot immigrants in the latter part of the century, who brought with them new techniques. This industry operated as a cottage industry, with the weavers working from top-shops; a type of building which was specific to the local area, and had living space in the two lower floors, and a workshop with very large windows on the top floor. This industry flourished for nearly two centuries, albeit with periodic booms and slumps. However, by the early 19th century the industry was struggling to compete against the factory produced textiles from northern manufacturers, and the local weavers strongly resisted adopting factory production methods as they valued their independence. Nevertheless, in 1851 46% of Nuneaton&#x27;s workforce was still employed by the ribbon trade. The industry was finally wiped out after 1860 by cheap imports, following the Cobden–Chevalier Treaty, which removed duties on imported French silks. This caused a slump in the local economy which lasted nearly two decades.

====Coal mining====
Another major industry which grew in the local area was coal mining. Nuneaton was located in the Warwickshire coalfield, and mining was recorded locally as early as 1338. However the lack of efficient transport and the primitive mining techniques kept the industry on a small scale. Mining did not start to develop on a larger scale until the 17th century, with the dawn of the Industrial Revolution, which led to greater demand for fuel and technical advancement. A major problem was the drainage of water from coal pits as they were dug deeper. The use of a waterwheel to drive drainage pumps was recorded as early as 1683. The first recorded use of an atmospheric engine; a primitive form of steam engine, to pump water from coal pits was recorded at Griff Colliery in 1714; this was the first recorded use of a steam engine in Warwickshire. Another major problem facing the industry was poor transport. Sir Roger Newdigate, who owned several local coal mines, developed a turnpike road to Coventry in the 1750s, which partially resolved this problem. Early on Newdigate recognised the potential of canals as a means for transporting bulk cargoes. He developed a system of private canals on his land on the Arbury Estate from 1764 to transport coal, and helped promote the Coventry Canal, which opened from Coventry to Nuneaton in 1769, before being finally completed to Staffordshire in 1790. He also helped promote the Oxford Canal. Ironically, the new canal system led to a decline in the Warwickshire coal industry after 1800, as it was exploited by Staffordshire coal producers to capture the local market. The local coal industry was not exploited to its maximum potential until the development of the railway network in the 19th century.

The first railway to reach Nuneaton was the Trent Valley Railway which opened in 1847, linking Nuneaton to the growing national railway network at Rugby and Stafford. This was followed by a branch line to Coventry in 1850. In 1864 a line was opened from Birmingham to Leicester via Nuneaton, and this proved to be the most important for the local economy, as it linked Nuneaton with the rapidly growing town (later city) of Birmingham. Due largely to this, the local coal industry expanded rapidly in the latter half of the 19th century, with production from the Warwickshire coalfield expanding nearly tenfold between 1860 and 1913 from around 545,000 tons to over five million tons. The industry peaked in the early 20th century; in 1911 one third of the male workforce in Nuneaton were employed as miners. The industry, however, declined rapidly in the 1950s and 1960s, with the last coal mine in Nuneaton closing in 1968, although Newdigate colliery at Bedworth lasted until 1982. The last Warwickshire coal mine at nearby Daw Mill closed in 2013.

====Other industries====
Nuneaton underwent a period of rapid growth from the 1880s onwards with the rapid development of an array of industries. These included brick and tile making, brewing, the production of hats and leather goods. and engineering. At the time of the first national census in 1801 Nuneaton was one of the largest towns in Warwickshire, with a population of 5,135. By 1901 this had grown to 24,996.

===Civic history===
Nuneaton was an ancient parish, which covered the hamlets of Attleborough and Stockingford as well as the town itself. The parish was made a local board district in 1850, which was Nuneaton&#x27;s first modern form of local government; previously it had been governed by its vestry and manorial court. The local board&#x27;s main responsibilities were to provide the town with infrastructure such as paved roads, clean drinking water, street lighting and sewerage. The neighbouring parish of Chilvers Coton was made a separate local board district at the same time.

The two local board districts of Nuneaton and Chilvers Cotton were merged in 1893. The following year, all such districts were converted into urban districts. The Nuneaton and Chilvers Coton Urban District was elevated to become a municipal borough in 1907 under the single name of Nuneaton. The borough was enlarged several times, notably in 1931 when it absorbed the neighbouring parish of Weddington. In 1974, the Municipal Borough of Nuneaton was merged with Bedworth Urban District to create a non-metropolitan district with borough status which was initially called Nuneaton, but changed its name to Nuneaton and Bedworth in 1980.

===Second World War===
Nuneaton suffered severe bomb damage during The Blitz in the Second World War between 1940 and 1942. The heaviest bombing raid on Nuneaton took place on 17 May 1941, when 130 people were killed, 380 houses were destroyed, and over 10,000 damaged.

===Postwar to present===
In 1947 the architect and town planner Frederick Gibberd was appointed to create a masterplan to redevelop the bomb damaged town centre. The redevelopment, which continued until the 1960s included the features typical of town planning from that era, including a new ringroad, indoor shopping centre, administrative centre and library.

Nuneaton continued to expand in the latter 20th century. In the early postwar years the need arose for low-cost housing, and in response to this around 2,500 council houses were built during the 1950s, the largest such development was at Camp Hill, where 1,400 new houses were built by 1956, while around 1,100 new council houses were built at new estates at Hill Top, Caldwell and Marston Lane by 1958. Following this, Nuneaton&#x27;s expansion was largely driven by private developments at Weddington, St Nicolas Park, Whitestone and Stockingford.

===Historic population===
==Geography==
Nuneaton is north of Coventry, east of Birmingham and south-west of Leicester.

The town centre lies south-west of the Leicestershire border (which is defined by the A5 road the former Roman Watling Street), south-east of Staffordshire, and south-south-east from Derbyshire’s southernmost point.

Nuneaton lies very close to the geographic centre of England, which since 2002 has been recognised as being at Lindley Hall Farm, about north of Nuneaton, across the county border in Leicestershire.

The River Anker runs through the town. Nuneaton town centre was historically prone to regular flooding from the Anker, with especially bad floods in 1932 and 1968. This was relieved in 1976 by the construction of a flood relief channel.

Nuneaton forms the largest part of the Nuneaton built-up area which also includes the large villages of Hartshill and Bulkington. It had a population of 132,236 at the 2001 Census. In the 2011 Census it had a considerably lower population of 92,698 because Hinckley ceased to be defined as part of the urban area. In the 2021 Census the urban area was recorded as having a population of 99,372, and comprising Nuneaton, Bulkington and Hartshill.

On 19 July 2022, it recorded its highest ever temperature of 38 °C during the 2022 United Kingdom heat wave.

Towns close to Nuneaton include Bedworth, Atherstone and Hinckley, with Tamworth, Rugby, Coleshill and Lutterworth a little further afield.

==Politics==
===National===

Nuneaton is part of the constituency of the same name in the House of Commons. The constituency is currently represented by the Labour Party Member of Parliament (MP), Jodie Gosling who was first elected in the 2024 general election. 

From 1935 to 1983, Nuneaton was a safe Labour seat, but it has become more marginal. Between 1983 and 1992, the Conservative Party held the seat, until losing it back to Labour. For the next 18 years, the Labour Party (in the form of Bill Olner) was the local representative at Parliament, until his retirement. The Conservatives won it back at the 2010 general election, with Marcus Jones holding the seat until 2024.

===Local===
There are two-tiers of local government covering Nuneaton; Nuneaton and Bedworth Borough Council as the lower tier and Warwickshire County Council as the upper tier. Nuneaton is an unparished area and so there is no tier of administration below the Borough council. Nuneaton and Bedworth council was once solidly controlled by the Labour Party, but has in more recent years become more volatile: It was Labour controlled from its creation in 1974, until the 2008 local elections, when the Conservatives gained control, ending 34 years of Labour rule. However, the period of Conservative control was relatively short lived. The Labour Party won two seats from the Conservative Party in the 2010 local elections, giving no party overall control of the council (but leaving the Labour Party as the largest grouping). In 2012 Labour gained a further 8 seats to regain overall control which they lost again to no overall control in 2018. In the May 2021 elections, the Conservatives once more gained a majority; winning ten seats from Labour and one from an independent. However, the pendulum swung back again in the May 2024 elections, when Labour again won back control of the council, winning 15 seats.

==Economy==

Nuneaton&#x27;s traditional industries like textiles, mining and manufacturing have declined significantly in the post-war years. Due to its transport links, Nuneaton is to some extent a commuter town for nearby Coventry and Birmingham. However a relatively large number of businesses involved in the automotive, aerospace and engineering supply chains industries are active in the area. MIRA Limited, formerly the Motor Industry Research Association, is based on a disused wartime airfield on the A5, to the north of the town.

One of the biggest developments in the town&#x27;s history, the multimillion-pound Ropewalk Shopping Centre, opened in September 2005 in the hope that it will give the town extra income from the shopping, attract more visitors and retailers, and attract shoppers as an alternative to larger retail centres such as Birmingham, Coventry, Leicester and Solihull. An older shopping centre, the Abbeygate Shopping Centre in the town centre was first opened in the 1960s, and was formerly known as Heron Way.

The European headquarters of Holland &amp; Barrett are based in the town, as is the UK head office of FedEx. While Bermuda Park, which is south of Nuneaton, is the location of the national distribution centres of Dairy Crest and RS Components. Nuneaton is also the location of several international online marketing companies.

In 2017 the Nuneaton and Bedworth borough was less prosperous than the rest of Warwickshire, reflecting the long established north–south divide in the county. The average annual workplace wage in Nuneaton and Bedworth was £21,981, the lowest in the county and below the Warwickshire average of £28,513 (and UK £28,296) although the productivity gap had narrowed with the rest of Warwickshire since 2009.

==Religion==

Nuneaton&#x27;s name reflects the effect that Christianity has had upon the town&#x27;s history. Although the Benedictine nunnery which gave the town its name was destroyed at the time of the Reformation, the remaining fragments were incorporated into the Anglican church building now known as the Abbey Church of St Mary the Virgin in Manor Court Road. This is a Victorian construction.

===Church of England===
Near the town centre, but unusually not a part of it and outside the ring road, lies the medieval church of St. Nicolas – a grade I listed building. Chilvers Coton contains All Saints&#x27; Church, where Mary Ann Evans (George Eliot) worshipped and Justin Welby, later Archbishop of Canterbury, served as a curate. This was badly damaged by bombing during the Second World War, and rebuilt largely by German prisoners of war. There are also Anglican churches in Weddington (St James&#x27;s), Attleborough (Holy Trinity), Stockingford (St Paul&#x27;s), Galley Common (St Peter&#x27;s), Abbey Green (St Mary&#x27;s), and more recently built (1954), in Camp Hill St Mary&#x27;s and St John&#x27;s.

===Roman Catholic Church===
There are two parishes in the town serving the Catholic community in Nuneaton. Our Lady of the Angels on Coton Road, was opened in 1838 (originally as St Mary&#x27;s). The building, designed by Joseph Hansom, was extensively remodeled in 1936. The Parish of St Anne&#x27;s, Chapel End, Nuneaton was created in 1949 out of the Parish of Our Lady of the Angels (which originally covered the whole town). The original church building was replaced with the existing church, which was opened in 2000.

===Other Christian traditions===
In the town, Baptist, Methodist, Wesleyan Reform Union, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Pentecostal, the Salvation Army, United Reformed and Christadelphian churches serve their respective congregations.

A Kingdom Hall of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses is located in the Stockingford area and Christadelphians in Whitestone.

===Other religions===
In addition to Christianity, there are also followers of Islam, Sikhism and Hinduism. There is a mosque on Frank Street, Chilvers Coton, and two gurdwaras (Sikh temples): the Nuneaton Guru Nanak Gurdwara in Park Avenue, Attleborough, and the Shri Guru Tegh Bahadur Gurdwara in Marlborough Road, Chilvers Coton. There are also two Hindu temples in Nuneaton: the Shree Hindu Gujrati Samaj on Upper Abbey Street, and a second Hindu temple, the Watford Kantha Swami Hindu Temple, which opened in 2021, using a converted former Methodist Chapel in Stockingford.

In addition to these, there is an active Bahá&#x27;i Faith group in Nuneaton.

Several Eastern European Jewish families settled in the area after the First World War, due to the economic vitality of the town at the time. Economic migrants seeking technical and agricultural opportunities in North Warwickshire relocated to Nuneaton in the 1920s and 1930s, worshipping and paying for membership seats in the Spon End Synagogue in Coventry and the Orthodox Synagogue in Leicester. Prior to World War Two, hundreds of children gained passage to the UK via the Kindertransport, with a number of children being fostered in Nuneaton and subsequently settling in the immediate area, North Warwickshire and Market Bosworth. Provincial Jewish life in Nuneaton and Bedworth has waned since the 1970s, with the majority of the community leaving for larger Jewish centres of Britain, with remaining members being elderly and non-observant.

==Demographics==
At the 2021 census, there were 88,813 residents in Nuneaton. In terms of ethnicity in 2021:

*87.3% of Nuneaton residents were White 
*8.4% were Asian

==Transport==
===Road===
The town is near the M6, the M42 and M69 motorways and the main A5 trunk road (Watling Street), which also acts as a border with Leicestershire and the neighbouring town of Hinckley. The A444 provides a high-speed dual-carriageway route into the town from the south and also acts as the often busy town centre ring road. The A47 links the town with neighbouring Hinckley and onwards to Leicester, and the A4254 – Eastern Relief Road – provides direct access from the east of Nuneaton to the south, avoiding the town centre.

===Railway===

The town has two railway stations. The main Nuneaton railway station, located near the town centre, is an important railway junction and is served by the West Coast Main Line running from London to the North West, the cross-country Birmingham to Peterborough Line and by a line to Coventry via Bedworth. A new railway station at Bermuda Park was opened south of the town centre in 2016 on the line towards Coventry, as part of the NUCKLE (Nuneaton, Coventry, Kenilworth and Leamington) rail upgrade scheme.

Historically, Nuneaton was also served by Chilvers Coton station, Abbey Street station and Stockingford station. Chilvers Coton station was located on the Coventry line, a short distance north of the new Bermuda Park station, and was closed in 1965. Abbey Street station and Stockingford station were on the line towards Birmingham and were both closed in 1968. In January 2017, there were proposals to open a new station at Stockingford, at a different location from the former one, which could open by 2023. Warwickshire County Council have also proposed a new &quot;Nuneaton Parkway&quot; station between Nuneaton and Hinckley, which could open by 2034.

===Bus===
The principal operator around Nuneaton is Stagecoach in Warwickshire and the depot is located next to the fire station on Newtown Road, just west from the bus station. Arriva Midlands also operate a number of routes around Nuneaton with buses running to Tamworth, Hinckley, Barwell, Leicester. MIRA, and Coventry. Arriva Midlands also operate service 78 to Walsgrave Hospital, a service operated by Travel de Courcey until the company entered administration in 2020.

In January 2020 NX Coventry announced an extension to Nuneaton on their 20 route from Coventry to Bedworth.

===Canal===
The Coventry Canal passes through Nuneaton, while the Ashby Canal skirts the town&#x27;s south-eastern outskirts.

==Recreation and culture==

Nuneaton has two non-league football teams: Nuneaton Borough and Nuneaton Griff who both play in the Midland Football League. Sunday League football is played in the town, with teams from Nuneaton, Bedworth and North Warwickshire competing in the Nuneaton &amp; District Sunday Football League (NDSFL).

There are three rugby union clubs: Nuneaton R.F.C. (nicknamed &quot;the Nuns&quot;), who play in National 3 Midlands, Nuneaton Old Edwardians of Midlands 2 West (South) division and Manor Park of the Midlands 3 West (South) league.

The town is also the location of Nuneaton Bowling club, where flat green bowls is played.

There are three main leisure centres and one stadium in the town owned by Nuneaton and Bedworth Borough Council and managed by Everyone Active on the council&#x27;s behalf (after a competitive tender process):

Nuneaton has a museum and art gallery in the grounds of Riversley Park adjacent to the town centre. The museum includes a display on George Eliot. Eliot&#x27;s family home Griff House is now a restaurant and hotel on the A444.

The Abbey Theatre is Nuneaton&#x27;s only theatre and hosts a wide variety of performances including visiting opera and ballet companies, touring shows, musicals, pantomime and drama. Run solely by volunteers, the Abbey Theatre seats 250 plus space for wheelchair patrons.

Also located in Nuneaton on Abbey Street is the Ritz Cinema. It is Grade-II listed due to its Art Deco style. 

Historically, Nuneaton used to take part in the Britain in Bloom competition and in 2000, Nuneaton and Bedworth was a national finalist. It is the location of Nuneaton Carnival, the largest carnival in Warwickshire, which takes place every June.

Nuneaton was home to the smallest independent newspaper in Britain (the &quot;Heartland Evening News&quot;) until it was purchased in 2006 by life News &amp; Media.

Public art in Nuneaton includes a statue of George Eliot on Newdegate Square, and the Gold Belt.

*Milby (town and parish church, based on Nuneaton and St Nicolas parish church);
*Shepperton (based on Chilvers Coton);
*Paddiford Common (based on Stockingford, which at the time had a large area of common land including its parish Church of St Paul&#x27;s);

==Landmarks==
A major local landmark in Nuneaton, which can be seen for many miles is Mount Judd which is a conical shaped former spoil heap, high made from spoil from the former Judkins Quarry. It is also known locally as the &quot;Nuneaton Nipple&quot;. In May 2018 it was voted the best UK landmark in an online poll for the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; newspaper, beating competition from the likes of the Angel of the North and Big Ben.

Another well known landmark is the Roanne Fountain, also known as the Dandelion Fountain, which sits in the middle of a roundabout in the town centre, it was built in 2000, and features 385 spraying arms which spray out 50,000 gallons of water per hour. In 2016 it was voted the &#x27;UK Roundabout of the Year&#x27; by the Roundabout Appreciation Society, who stated that the town should feel &quot;very proud for achieving such a high roundabout accolade.&quot;

<text>A V10 engine is a ten-cylinder piston engine where two banks of five cylinders are arranged in a V configuration around a common crankshaft. V10 engines are much less common than V8 and V12 engines. Several V10 diesel engines have been produced since 1965, and V10 petrol engines for road cars were first produced in 1991 with the release of the Dodge Viper.

== Design ==
The V10 configuration does not have perfect engine balance, since an unbalanced rocking couple is caused by each cylinder bank functioning as a straight-five engine. Therefore, balance shafts are sometimes used to reduce the vibrations in a V10 engine.

== Diesel engines ==
One of the first known V10 engines was used in the 1936 &quot;Busch-Sulzer ICRR 9201&quot; prototype locomotive, of which three examples were produced in the United States.

The 1965–1984 Leopard 1 armored tank was powered by the &quot;MTU MB 838 CaM 500&quot; V10 diesel engine.

Daimler-Benz produced three V10 diesel engine models (OM403, OM423 and OM443) for Mercedes-Benz NG and Neoplan buses in 1970s–1980s.

Four Japanese commercial vehicle manufacturers (Isuzu, Hino, Mitsubishi Fuso and Nissan Diesel) produced V10 diesel engines for their heavy duty trucks and coaches in 1970s–2000s.

The 1983–2023 Tatra 815 truck was available with a V10 engine.

The Volkswagen V10 TDI is a turbocharged V10 engine which was produced from 2002 to 2010 for use in the &quot;Volkswagen Phaeton&quot; luxury sedan and &quot;Volkswagen Touareg&quot; SUV.

== Petrol engines ==
=== Production vehicles ===

V10 engines are less common than V8 and V12 engines, a V12 is only slightly more complicated and runs more smoothly, while a V8 is less complex and more economical. Nevertheless, modern engineering has made it possible to use V10 engines for applications where a V8 would produce insufficient power and a V12 would be too complicated or bulky. V10s have been used in select luxury cars, sports cars and commercial vehicles.

An early V10 petrol engine was used in the 1987 Lamborghini P140, however this prototype sports car did not reach production.

Dodge developed an early V10, originally designing a version of its LA series small block for use in trucks. The Dodge engine saw its first production use in substantially revised form in the Dodge Viper while the truck version of the engine was used starting in 1994 in the Dodge Ram. It discontinued in that application after 2003. However, 2003 also saw the introduction of the Dodge Ram SRT-10, a performance model meant to rival Ford&#x27;s successful V8 powered F-150 SVT Lightning. The Viper engine (a 90-degree engine with odd firing order to obviate the need for a balance shaft) was improved during its production run, and produced as much as in a standard state of tune from an 8.4 L version. The Viper engine was also used by Bristol in the two-seat Fighter coupe, and in other low-volume vehicles.

Ford also developed a heavy-duty V10 version of their Triton engine to replace the 460 big block in truck applications. It was introduced in the E-Series/Econoline full-size van, and also saw duty in the F-Series Super Duty line and the Ford Excursion SUV, and was offered by Ford through the 2019 model year.

For the Lexus LFA, the engineers selected a V10 engine over an equivalent displacement V8 because they could not get the V8 to rev as high as a V10, and over a V12 for its lower reciprocating mass, allowing for more rapid engine response. 

High-revving V10 power-plants were incorporated into supercars from Lamborghini and Porsche. BMW and Audi developed V10s for high performance cars such as BMW M5, BMW M6, Audi S6, Audi RS6, Audi S8 and Audi R8, mostly based upon their executive cars. Volkswagen also developed a V10, but as a turbo-diesel. A variant of the Volkswagen Phaeton was the first production sedan to contain a V10 of any kind. 

Examples of petrol V10 production engines include:

* 1991–2017 Dodge Viper engine
* 1994–2003 Chrysler Magnum V10
* 1997–2021 Ford Triton engine
* 2003–present Lamborghini V10
* 2003–2007 Porsche V10 engine
* 2005–2010 BMW S85
* 2006–2024 Audi V10 FSI
* 2008–2010 Audi V10 TFSI
* 2009–2012 Toyota 1LR-GUE
=== Motor racing ===
One of the first known V10 engines designed for motor racing was a prototype Formula One engine built by Alfa Romeo in 1986. Originally intended for the Ligier Formula One team, this partnership collapsed without the engine being used in any races. Alfa Romeo fitted the engine to two Alfa Romeo 164 Pro Car prototypes in 1988, however these cars also did not compete in any races.

The most widespread use of V10 racing engines has been in Formula One. Following a ban on turbocharged engines after 1988, the first V10 Formula One cars were the 1989 McLaren MP4/5 and Williams FW12. V10 engines were used by the majority of teams by the 1996 season, following reduction in displacement from . The V10 seemed the best compromise between the lower weight of a V8 and the higher power of a V12. Renault F1 used a flatter 110° angle in 2002 and 2003, but reverted to a more conventional 72° following the change in rules which dictated that an engine must last two race weekends. In a further change to the rules, V10s were banned for the 2006 season onwards in favor of 2.4 L V8s.

In sports car racing, the first V10 engine was used by the Peugeot 905 in the two final races of the 1990 season. This was followed by the Judd GV10 engine being used by several teams during the 1991 season and the Toyota TS010 that debuted in the last race of the season. The Audi R15 TDI was a Le Mans Prototype (LMP) racing car that used a turbocharged diesel V10 engine and competed in various endurance races in 2009 and 2010. The Audi R15 TDI set the current distance record for the 2010 24 Hours of Le Mans.

=== Commercial vehicle use ===
Until early 2021, Blue Bird Corporation offered its Vision school bus with two V10 engine options, both Ford Triton units.

<text>A V4 engine is a four-cylinder piston engine where the cylinders share a common crankshaft and are arranged in a V configuration.

The V4 engine is less common compared to straight-four engines. However, V4 engines have been used in automobiles, motorcycles, and other applications.

==Design==
Some V4 engines have two crankpins that are shared by opposing cylinders. The crankshaft is usually supported by three main bearings in this type of engines. However this arrangement results an uneven firing engine. Split crankpins are preferred for even firing intervals.

Compared to the more common inline-four engine layout, a V4 engine is much shorter. Although different V angles can be used, if the two pistons are at a 90° V-angle with shared crankpins, the engine also achieves a perfect primary balance and offers the additional advantage of better secondary balance that reduces vibration. The shorter crankshaft of the V4 engine is less susceptible to the effects of torsional vibration due to its increased stiffness and also because of fewer supports suffers less friction losses.

Disadvantages of V4 engines include its design being inherently wider compared to inline-4 engines, as well as the requirement of two exhaust manifolds, two-cylinder heads, and two valvetrains (thus needing two sets of camshafts for overhead cam engines) rather than only one cylinder head, one manifold, one valvetrain, and one set of camshafts for an inline-four engine. Having two separate banks of components increases cost and complexity in comparison with inline four engines.

Because V4 engines are wider than inline-four engines, incorporating auxiliary drives, inlet systems, and exhaust systems while maintaining an overall compact size may be more difficult like other V-type engines. In order to reduce width, a narrower V-angle could be utilized, such as 60 degrees. Although a 60° V4 is more compact than a 90° V4 engine, the 60° design does not have perfect primary balance (if the crankpins are not split) and, therefore, often require a balance shaft to reduce vibrations similar to the V6 engines. Additionally, any (four-stroke) V4 engine with shared crankpins will fire unevenly which will result in more vibration and potentially require a heavier flywheel. Using split crankpins in a 60° V4, as used on the Ford Essex V4 engine and Ford Taunus V4 engines, results in an even firing order.

==Automobile use==


The earliest automotive use of V4 engines were in Grand Prix racing (later called &#x27;Formula One&#x27;) cars. One of the pioneering V4 engines was in the 1898 Mors rear-engined car built in France. At the time, the lack of vibration from the V4 engine was a key selling point. However, the car&#x27;s V4 engine was replaced by a conventional inline-four engine by 1901.

In the 1907 French Grand Prix, the car entered by J. Walter Christie used a V4 engine, the largest engine ever used in a Grand Prix race. The engine was mounted transversely in the front and the car was front-wheel drive. The car retired from the French Grand Prix after just four laps, however, it later set a speed record of .

The first V4 engine used in production cars was the Lancia V4 engine that was first used in the 1922 Lancia Lambda. The Lancia engine was a narrow-angle design with an angle of 20 degrees between the banks and a single cylinder head with one overhead camshaft shared by both banks. It also used aluminium for both the block and head (which was unusual for the time). Lancia produced V4 engines until 1976, when they were replaced by flat-four engines.

The 1960–1994 ZAZ Zaporozhets is a Soviet city-type car that used a rear-mounted V4 engine. This engine was based on the design used in the LuAZ-967 amphibious military vehicle. It featured air-cooling with a magnesium block and was produced in displacements from .

The AMC Air-cooled 108 was a engine built from 1960 to 1963 for use in the lightweight M422 Mighty Mite military vehicle. The M422 developed was by American Motors Corporation (AMC) in the United States and specifically designed to be transported by helicopter.

Beginning in the 1960s, Ford&#x27;s European divisions produced two unrelated V4 engines. The first was the Ford Taunus V4 engine, produced in Germany from 1962 to 1981. The Taunus was a 60-degree V4 engine with water cooling and overhead valves. Initially designed for use in front-engined cars, it was used in various Ford models and also used in the front-wheel-drive Saab 95, Saab 96, and Saab Sonett models. It was also used in the mid-engine Matra 530 sports car. The second Ford V4 engine was the Ford Essex V4 engine, produced in the United Kingdom from 1965 to 1977 and used in several Ford Corsair, Capri, Consul, Zephyr, and Transit models. Although designed separately from the Taunus engine, the Essex also was a 60-degree V4 with water cooling, overhead valves, and designed for use in front-engined cars/vans.

The Porsche 919 Hybrid LMP1 racing car used in the 2014–2017 seasons used a 90-degree turbocharged V4 engine that was mid-mounted.

==Motorcycle use==

One of the first motorcycles powered by a V4 engine was the 1931–1935 Matchless Silver Hawk built in the United Kingdom. The Silver Hawk used a narrow-angle 16-degree V4 engine with a single cylinder head, pushrod valve actuation, and air cooling.

The 1936–1938 &quot;Puch P800&quot; was built in Austria for both civilian and military uses. The P800 used a very wide-angle 170-degree V4 engine (therefore being close in appearance to a flat-four engine) with two cylinder heads and air cooling.

V4 engines were used during the mid-to-late 1980s, especially in transverse-engined Honda motorcycles that had a 90-degree V4 engine with water cooling.

The majority MotoGP manufacturers chose the V4 configuration for their bikes since 2020. These include:
* Honda RC213V
* Ducati Desmosedici
* KTM RC16
* Aprilia - 90° V4 for the 2020 season
The reasons for this are that compared to traditional firing order inline four engines, V4 engines 
* are narrower, resulting in a narrower and more aerodynamic motorcycle possibly with a lower center of gravity
* offer better rear wheel traction management during acceleration because of uneven firing that gives the rear tire more time to recover during pauses between power strokes
* have better secondary balance which results in better feedback from the engine especially at high RPM
* offer more even spread of torque over the RPM range

==Boat use==
Another use of the V4 engine is in outboard motors for boats. The V4 configuration is popular for outboard marine applications due to its short engine length.

In 1958, both Johnson and Evinrude introduced V4 outboards rated at and weighing . By 1972, the same basic V4 block was producing more than double the horsepower in stock form because of the experience manufacturers gained from racing. In 1988, Yamaha introduced a two-stroke V4 to the US market with what was called &quot;precision blend&quot; oil injection. Most of the outboard motors are usually two-stroke engines with a carburetor.

==Other uses==
In 1935, the Wisconsin Motor Manufacturing Company began producing petrol (gasoline) V4 engines for industrial, agricultural, and stationary applications, with several farm equipment manufacturers using the Wisconsin V4 engines. In 1950, the largest Wisconsin V4 engine was the VR4D with a displacement of and a power output of at 3000 rpm and a peak torque of at 1250 rpm. The company produced V4 engines until 2019.

In the mid-1940s, Turner Manufacturing in the United Kingdom produced a diesel water-cooled V4 engine for industrial and marine uses. This engine was used in the 1949–1957 &quot;Turner Yeoman of England&quot; tractor.

Mitsubishi Heavy Industries built the &quot;4ZF&quot;, an air-cooled diesel-powered V4 engine used in the Type 73 armored personnel carrier and related Japanese military vehicles since 1973.

<doc id="199964" wikidata="Q959645" url="?curid=199964" title="Joseph de Villèle">
<text>Jean-Baptiste Guillaume Joseph Marie Anne Séraphin, 1st Count of Villèle (14 April 177313 March 1854), better known simply as Joseph de Villèle (; ), was a French statesman who served as Prime Minister in the 1820s. He was a leader of the Ultra-royalist faction during the Bourbon Restoration.

== Youth ==
He was born in Toulouse, France and brought up to go into the navy. He joined the &quot;Bayonnaise&quot; at Brest in July 1788. He served in the West and East Indies. Arrested in the Isle of Bourbon (now Réunion) under the Terror, he was freed by the Thermidorian Reaction (July 1794). In 1796 he helped oust Baco and Burnel, who had come to the island to enforce the 1794 abolition of slavery. He acquired a plantation and sixty slaves, and in 1799 he married the daughter of M. Desbassyns de Richemont, whose estates he had managed. He served in the Colonial Assembly from 1799-1803.
The arrival of General Decaen, appointed by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1802, restored security to the island, and five years later Villèle, who had now accumulated a large fortune, returned to France. He was mayor of his commune, and a member of the council of the Haute-Garonne under the Empire.

== The Bourbon Restoration (1815–1830) ==

At the Bourbon Restoration of 1814 he at once declared for the royalist principles. He was mayor of Toulouse in 1814–15 and deputy for the Haute-Garonne in the ultra-royalist &quot;Chambre introuvable&quot; of 1815.

Villèle, who before the promulgation of the charter had written some &quot;Observations sur le projet de constitution&quot;, opposing it as too democratic in character, naturally took his place on the extreme right with the ultra-royalists. In the new Chamber of 1816 Villèle&#x27;s party was in a minority, but his personal authority nevertheless increased. He was looked on by the ministerialists as the least unreasonable of his party, and by the &quot;ultras&quot; as the safest of their leaders.

Under the electoral law of 1817 the Abbé Grégoire, who was popularly supposed to have voted for the death of Louis XVI of France in the convention, was admitted to the Chamber of Deputies. The Conservative party gained strength from the alarm raised by this incident and still more from the shock caused by the assassination of the duc de Berry. The duc de Richelieu was compelled to admit to the cabinet two of the chiefs of the &quot;ultras&quot;, Villèle and Corbière. Villèle resigned within a year, but on the fall of Richelieu at the end of 1821 he became the real chief of the new cabinet, in which he was minister of finance.

Although not himself a courtier, he was backed at court by Sosthene de la Rochefoucauld and Madame du Cayla, and in 1822 Louis XVIII gave him the title of count and made him formally prime minister. He immediately proceeded to muzzle opposition by stringent press laws, and the discovery of minor liberal conspiracies afforded an excuse for further repression. Forced against his will into interference in Spain by Mathieu de Montmorency and Chateaubriand, he contrived to reap some credit for the monarchy from the successful campaign of 1823.

Meanwhile, he had consolidated the royal power by persuading Louis XVIII to swamp the liberal majority in the upper house by the nomination of twenty-seven new peers; he availed himself of the temporary popularity of the monarchy after the Spanish campaign to summon a new Chamber of Deputies. This new and obedient legislature, to which only nineteen liberals were returned, made itself into a septennial parliament, thus providing time, it was thought, to restore some part of the ancien regime. Villèle&#x27;s plans were assisted by the death of Louis XVIII and the accession of his brother, Charles X, a staunch believer in absolute monarchy. Prudent financial administration since 1815 had made possible the conversion of the state bonds from 5 to 3%. It was proposed to utilize the money set free by this operation to indemnify by a billion francs (&quot;Le milliard des émigrés&quot;) the émigrés for the loss of their lands at the Revolution; it was also proposed to restore their former privileges to the religious congregations.

Both these propositions were, with some restrictions, secured. Sacrilege was made a crime punishable by death with the 1825 Anti-Sacrilege Act (&quot;Loi contre le blasphème&quot;), and the ministry were preparing a law to alter the law of equal inheritance, and thus create anew the great estates. These measures roused violent opposition in the country, which a new and stringent press law, nicknamed the &quot;law of justice and love,&quot; failed to put down. The peers rejected the law of inheritance and the press law; it was found necessary to disband the National Guard; and in November 1827 seventy-six new peers were created, and recourse was had to a general election. The new Chamber proved hostile to Villèle, who resigned to make way for the short-lived moderate ministry of Martignac.

The new ministry made Villèle&#x27;s removal to the upper house a condition of taking office, and he took no further part in public affairs. At the time of his death, he had advanced as far as 1816 with his memoirs, which were completed from his correspondence by his family as &quot;&quot; (Paris, 5 vols., 1887–90).

<doc id="199965" wikidata="Q2263764" url="?curid=199965" title="V16 engine">
<text>A V16 engine is a sixteen-cylinder piston engine where two banks of eight cylinders are arranged in a V configuration around a common crankshaft. V16 engines are less common than engines with fewer cylinders, such as V8 and V12 engines. Each bank of a V16 engine can be thought of as a straight-eight, a design that can be inherently balanced. Most V16 engines have a 45° bank angle.

The first use of a V16 engine was in the 1910 Antoinette VII experimental aircraft, followed by several cars in the 1930s. Today, the most common applications for V16 engines are railroad locomotives, marine craft, and stationary power generators.

== Automotive applications ==

=== Production cars ===
The first production car to use a V16 engine was the Cadillac V-16, introduced in January 1930. The Cadillac V16 engine was initially produced with a displacement of , OHV and a V-angle of 45 degrees. For the 1938 Series 90, the engine was revised to a displacement of , a flathead valvetrain and a V-angle of 135 degrees (the latter in order to achieve a lower cowl height). This 431 cu. in. version produced as much power as its immediate predecessor while being far less complex, had a stiffer crankshaft that aided durability and smoothness, and even had an external oil filter, a rarity for any car at any price in those days.

The Marmon Motor Car Company actually began development of a V16 engine in 1927 (earlier than Cadillac). Its development program took longer, however, and the &quot;Marmon Sixteen&quot; was released in 1931. This engine had a V-angle of 45 degrees, used pressed steel cylinder liners and was constructed mostly of aluminium. Only 400 Marmon Sixteens were produced between 1931 and 1933. 
In 1991, the Cizeta-Moroder V16T began production, featuring a 16-cylinder engine in a unique configuration. Rather than a conventional V16 layout, the engine was actually two separate transversely mounted V8 engines with gearing between the two providing a single output from the centre of the engine assembly to the transmission. Only a few cars were produced before the company ceased operations. In June 2024, Bugatti unveiled the successor to the Chiron (which has a W16 Engine), the Tourbillon, which houses a V16 8.3L (506 cu in) hybrid powertrain co-developed with Cosworth.

=== Prototype cars ===

The Peerless Motor Company developed a V16 engine in the early 1930s, yet just a single prototype was built before all automobile production ceased and the company converted its factory into a brewery following the end of Prohibition in the United States.

In the late 1980s, the BMW Goldfish V16 engine was developed, based on BMW&#x27;s then-new V12 engine. Prototypes were fitted to a long-wheelbase 7 Series and then in the early 1990s to a Bentley Mulsanne. At around the same time, Mercedes-Benz developed a V16 engine for the S-class limousine. Between 1988 and 1990, approximately 35 prototypes were built.

The 2003 Cadillac Sixteen concept car was unveiled with a V16 engine, which was based on the General Motors LS V8 engines. The following year, the Rolls-Royce 100EX concept car was unveiled with a V16 engine. The car featured in the film &quot;Johnny English Reborn&quot; is powered by this V16 engine.

The 2017 Devel Sixteen Prototype used a quad-turbo V16 engine.
=== Racing cars ===


The first known use of a V16 in motor racing was the Maserati Tipo V4 car used in Grand Prix racing. The Tipo V4 debuted at Monza in 1929 and achieved a world speed record of at an event in Cremona, Italy.

At the 1931 Indianapolis 500, a custom-built V16 engine was fitted to a Cord &quot;supercar&quot; driven by Shorty Cantlon. The car was competitive, charging from 26th on the grid to 3rd, but was slowed by unreliability, further exacerbated by having to change all sixteen spark plugs. The following year, Bryan Saulpaugh qualified the car in third position. The car suffered a broken oil line on lap 55 and their race was over. Shortly after the race the V16 was removed and replaced with a conventional Miller four-cylinder engine.

The mid-engined Auto Union &quot;Type A&quot;, &quot;Type B&quot; and &quot;Type C&quot; Grand Prix cars of 1933 to 1938 were powered by supercharged engines. Due to a rule change in 1938, these were replaced by a V12 engine for the &quot;Type D&quot; racing car. Prior to this rule change, the Alfa Romeo Tipo 316 competed at the 1938 Tripoli Grand Prix powered by a 60-degree V16 engine, and in 1939 an unusual 135-degree V16 engine was installed in the Alfa Romeo Tipo 162.

The only known use of a V16 engine in the post-World War II era is the British Racing Motors (BRM) V16 engine used in Formula One racing from 1950 to 1955. The engine was a supercharged design, which was unsuccessful despite its high power output. Officially, it produced but probably delivered around . The car was difficult to drive, due to the power band being in a narrow range and at high RPM.
== Marine / rail applications ==

The V16 configuration is also used in several large displacement diesel engines that are used as marine engines or in rail locomotives. This is due to manufacturers often designing an engine around a fixed displacement per cylinder, then adding additional cylinders to the design until the required power output is achieved. For example, the Electro-Motive Diesel 710 engine range uses a displacement of per cylinder, with the 16 cylinder version (called the &quot;EMD 16-710&quot;) producing over .

GE Transportation produces the &quot;7FD Series&quot; four-stroke engines (used in marine, locomotive, and stationary applications), which have a displacement of per cylinder and can produce over . GE also manufactures the GEVO-16, which produces over .

Another V16 diesel engine is the &quot;Wärtsilä 46F&quot;, which produces over at 600 rpm.

In the UK from 1947 onwards, English Electric&#x27;s subsidiary English Electric diesel engines developed a V16 engine for rail and marine use based on its 10&quot; bore x 12&quot; stroke (254mm x 305mm) K series from the 1930s, notably used in British Railways class 40 and 50 locomotives with power output in the range 2000-3000 hp (1492-2238 kW) at speeds ranging from 600 to 900 rpm. This engine too derives from a series based on a fixed cylinder size of 942 cu.in. (15.4 L) per cylinder, giving the V16 a total capacity of 15,072 cu.in. (246 L).

Another notable maker to offer the V16 configuration was Detroit Diesel corporation, especially in their 71, 92 and 149 series 2-stroke diesel engines, with output ranging from around 650 to over 2400 bhp (485-1790 kW) at speeds over 2000 rpm in the smaller ranges. Once again these engines were based on common parts (the numeric designation is the cylinder size in cubic inches) and were used for maritime, generator and off-road mine truck applications. The modular nature of the engines meant that the V16 configuration was built by putting together two V8 engine blocks and the 2-stroke cycle offered excellent power to weight, with the 16V149 being capable of equalling the output of much larger, slower-running 4-stroke engines.

Fairbanks Morse manufactures the following V16 diesel engines, FM | ALCO 251F, FM | COLT-PIELSTICK PA6B STC, FM | COLT-PIELSTICK PC2.5 STC, FM | MAN 28/33D STC, FM | MAN 32/44CR, FM | MAN 48/60 CR and the FM | MAN 175D.

== Aircraft applications ==

The 1910 version of the Antoinette VII was powered by a V16 engine and competed in the 1910 Gordon Bennett Cup in the United States.

The 1930s Hindenburg airships were each powered by four Daimler-Benz DB 602 V16 diesel engines.

In the first half of the 20th century, several prototype aircraft used V16 engines, including:
* 1907 prototype designed by Antoinette engineer Léon Levavasseur.
* Duesenberg developed a V16 engine for use in military aircraft in the mid 1910s. World War I ended prior to the engine being tested in an aircraft.
* The Chrysler IV-2220 inverted V16 engine began development in 1939, when Chrysler was contracted by the United States government to create a new engine for use in fighter aircraft. The resulting engine was rated at , however it took until June 1945 for the engine to be in a state ready for testing. A prototype engine was installed in a P-47 Thunderbolt (designated the &quot;XP-47H&quot;), which achieved a top speed of . World War II ended shortly after the tests, therefore development of the engine ceased.

<doc id="199966" wikidata="Q2576663" url="?curid=199966" title="Engine configuration">
<text>The engine configuration describes the fundamental operating principles by which internal combustion engines are categorized. 

Piston engines are often categorized by their cylinder layout, valves and camshafts. Wankel engines are often categorized by the number of rotors present. Gas turbine engines are often categorized into turbojets, turbofans, turboprops and turboshafts.
== Piston engines ==
Any design of motor/engine,be it a V or a boxer can be called an &quot;in-line&quot; if it&#x27;s mounted in-line with the frame/chassis and in-line with the direction of travel of the vehicle.When the motor/engine is across the frame/chassis this is called a TRANSVERSE motor.Cylinder arrangement is not in the description of how the motor/engine is oriented.Therefore a V4 motor/engine can be a transverse or an in-line.

Where the cylinders are arranged in two or more lines (such as in V engines or flat engines), each line of cylinders is referred to as a &#x27;cylinder bank&#x27;. The angle between cylinder banks is called the &#x27;bank angle&#x27;. Engines with multiple banks are shorter than straight engines of the same size, and will often have better engine balance characteristics, resulting in reduced engine vibration and potentially higher maximum engine speeds.

Most engines with four or less cylinders use a straight engine layout, and most engines with eight cylinders or more use a V engine layout. However, there are various exceptions to this, such as the straight-eight engines used by various luxury cars from 1919-1954, V4 engines used by some marine outboard motors, V-twin and flat-twin engines used by motorcycles and flat-four engines used by various cars.

=== Single cylinder bank ===

Straight engines (also known as &quot;inline engines&quot;) have all cylinders aligned in one row along the crankshaft with no offset. When a straight engine is mounted at an angle, it is sometimes called a &quot;slant engine&quot;. Types of straight engines include:
* Single cylinder example BMW R25 R26 R27
* Straight-2 example Sunbeam S7 
* Straight-3, also known as &quot;inline-triple&quot;
* Straight-4
* Straight-5
* Straight-6
* Straight-8

=== Multiple cylinder banks ===
==== V engines ====

V engines (also known as &quot;Vee engines&quot;) have the cylinders aligned in two separate planes or &#x27;banks&#x27;, so that they appear to be in a &quot;V&quot; when viewed along the axis of the crankshaft. Types of V engines include:
* V2, commonly called &quot;V-twin&quot;
* V3
* V4
* V5
* V6

* V8
* V10
* V12
* V14
* V16
* V18

VR5 and VR6 engines are very compact and light, having a narrow V angle which allows a single cylinder block and cylinder head.
These engines use a single cylinder head so are technically a straight engine with the name &quot;VR&quot; coming from the combination of German words “Verkürzt” and “Reihenmotor” meaning “shortened inline engine”.

==== Flat engines ====

Flat engines (also known as &quot;horizontally-opposed&quot; engines) have the cylinders arranged in two banks on either side of a single crankshaft. Boxer engines are a subtype of flat engines where opposing pistons move in and out in tandem.

Types of flat engines include:
* Flat-2, commonly called &quot;flat-twin&quot;
* Flat-4
* Flat-6
* Flat-8
* Flat-10
* Flat-12
* Flat-16

==== W engines ====

W engines have the cylinders in a configuration in which the cylinder banks resemble the letter W, in the same way those of a V engine resemble the letter V. Types of W engines include:
* W8
* W12
* W16
W engines using twin &quot;VR&quot; engine banks are technically a V8 engine. These engine banks use a single cylinder head so are technically a straight bank with the name &quot;VR&quot; coming from the combination of German words “Verkürzt” and “Reihenmotor” meaning “shortened inline engine”.

==== Other layouts ====
Radial engines have cylinders mounted radially around a central crankcase. Rotary engines have a similar configuration, except that the crankshaft is fixed and the cylinders rotate around it. (This is different from the Wankel engine configuration described below.) Radial and rotary engine designs were widely used in early aircraft engines.

U engines consist of two separate straight engines (complete with separate crankshafts) joined by gears or chains. Most U engines have four cylinders (i.e. two straight-two engines combined), such as square four engines and tandem twin engines. Similar to U engines, H engines consist of two separate flat engines joined by gears or chains. H engines have been produced with between 4 and 24 cylinders.

An opposed-piston engine is similar to a flat engine in that pairs of pistons are co-axial but rather than sharing a crankshaft, instead share a single combustion chamber per pair of pistons. The crankshaft configuration varies amongst opposed-engine designs. One layout has a flat/boxer engine at its center and adds an additional opposed-piston to each end so there are two pistons per cylinder on each side.

An X engine is essentially two V engines joined by a common crankshaft. A majority of these were existing V-12 engines converted into an X-24 configuration.

The Swashplate engine with the K-Cycle engine is where pairs of pistons are in an opposed configuration sharing a cylinder and combustion chamber.

A Delta engine has three (or its multiple) cylinders having opposing pistons, aligned in three separate planes or &#x27;banks&#x27;, so that they appear to be in a Δ when viewed along the axis of the main-shaft. An example of this type of layout is the Napier Deltic.

== Wankel (rotary) engines ==
Wankel engines (sometimes called &#x27;rotary engines&#x27;) can be classified based on the number of rotors present. Most production Wankel engines have two rotors, however engines with one, three and four rotors have also been produced. Wankel engines can also be classified based on whether they are naturally aspirated or turbocharged.

Most Wankel engines are fueled by petrol, however prototype engines running on diesel and hydrogen have been trialed.

== Gas turbine engines ==
Gas turbine engines— mostly used for aircraft— are usually separated into the following categories:
* Turbojet, gasses travel through a propelling nozzle
* Turbofan, gasses travel through a ducted fan
* Turboprop, gasses travel through an unducted propeller, usually with variable pitch
* Turboshaft, a gas turbine optimised for producing mechanical torque instead of thrust

<text>A flat engine is a piston engine where the cylinders are located on either side of a central crankshaft. Flat engines are also known as horizontally opposed engines, however this is distinct from the less common opposed-piston engine design, whereby each cylinder has two pistons sharing a central combustion chamber.

The most common configuration of flat engines is the boxer engine configuration, in which the pistons of each opposed pair of cylinders move inwards and outwards at the same time. The other configuration is effectively a V engine with a 180-degree angle between the cylinder banks: in this configuration each pair of cylinders shares a single crankpin, so that as one piston moves inward, the other moves outward.

The first flat engine (Benz Contramotor) was built in 1897 by Karl Benz. Flat engines have been used in aviation, motorcycle and automobile applications. They are now less common in cars than straight engines (for engines with fewer than six cylinders) and V engines (for engines with six or more cylinders). Flat engines are more common in aircraft, where straight engines are a rarity and V engines have almost vanished except in historical aircraft. They have even replaced radial engines in many smaller installations.

== Design ==

The advantages of flat engines are a short length, low centre of mass and suitability for air cooling (due to the well-exposed, large-surface-area cylinders and cylinder heads, and their short length).

Compared with the more common straight engines, flat engines have better primary balance (resulting in less vibration); however, the disadvantages are increased width and the need to have two cylinder heads. Compared with V engines – the most common layout for engines with six cylinders or more – flat engines again have a lower centre of mass, and, for six-cylinders, better primary balance; the disadvantage is again their being wider.

The most common usages of flat engines are:
* Flat-twin engines are mostly used in motorcycles. Occasionally they have been used in light cars, aircraft and industrial applications, mostly up until the 1960s.
* Flat-four engines are mostly used in cars (most notably in the earlier Volkswagen Types 1 to 4, and by Subaru in most of their models), and have occasionally been used in motorcycles. Their most common use is in smaller single-engine general-aviation aircraft, for which they are still manufactured and used to this day.
* Flat-six engines are mostly used in aircraft and cars (particularly by the Porsche 911 sports car), and have occasionally been used in motorcycles.
* Flat-eight engines have been used in several racing cars, mostly by Porsche in the 1960s.
* Flat-ten engines are not known to have reached production. A prototype road car engine was built by Chevrolet in the 1960s.
* Flat-twelve engines have been used in various racing cars, notably the Porsche 917K, during the 1960s and 1970s, and in Ferrari road cars from 1973 to 1996. The Panhard EBR armoured car is one of the few military vehicles to have used such an engine.
* Flat-sixteen engines are not known to have reached production. Prototype racing car engines were built by Coventry and Porsche in the 1960s and 1970s.

=== Boxer configuration ===
Most flat engines use a &quot;boxer&quot; configuration, where each pair of opposing pistons move inwards and outwards at the same time, somewhat like boxing competitors punching their gloves together before a fight. Boxer engines have low vibration, being they are the only common configuration that has no unbalanced forces, regardless of the number of pairs of cylinders. Boxer engines therefore do not require either a balance shaft or counterweights on the crankshaft to balance the weight of the reciprocating parts. However, a rocking couple is present, since each cylinder is slightly offset from the other member of its pair due to the distance between the crankpins along the crankshaft.

=== 180-degree V engine ===
An alternative configuration for flat engines is as a 180-degree V engine, which has been used on most twelve-cylinder flat engines. In this configuration, each pair of pistons shares a crankpin, this being simpler than the boxer configuration, where each piston has its own separate crankpin.

==Aviation use==

In 1902, the Pearse monoplane (which would later become one of the first aircraft to achieve flight) was powered by a flat-twin engine. Amongst the first commercially-produced aircraft to use a flat engine was the 1909 Santos-Dumont Demoiselle range of aeroplanes, which was powered by boxer-twin engines.

Several boxer-four engines have been produced specifically for light aircraft. A number of manufacturers produced boxer-six aircraft engines during the 1930s and 1940s.

During World War II, a boxer-twin engine called the &quot;Riedel starter&quot; was used as a starter motor/mechanical APU for the early German jet engines, such as the Junkers Jumo 004 and BMW 003. Designed by Norbert Riedel, these engines have a very oversquare stroke ratio of 2:1 so that they could fit within the intake diverter, directly forward of the turbine compressor.
==Motorcycle use==
Flat engines offer several advantages for motorcycles including a low centre of mass, low vibration, suitability for shaft drive, and equal cooling of the cylinders (for air-cooled engines). The most common design of flat engine for motorcycles is the boxer-twin, beginning with the 1905 Fée flat-twin engine, manufactured by the Light Motors Company, which was the first production motorcycle engine. BMW Motorrad have a long history of boxer-twin motorcycles, beginning in 1923 with the BMW R32

Several motorcycles have been produced with flat-four engines, such as the 1938–1939 Zündapp K800 and the 1974–1987 Honda Gold Wing. In 1987, the Honda Gold Wing engine was upsized to a flat-six design.

==Automotive use==
When used in cars, advantages of flat engines are a low centre of mass (which improves the handling of the car), short length, low vibration and suitability for air cooling (due to the well exposed, large surface area, cylinder heads and short length). However the larger width of flat engines (compared with the more common inline and V layouts) is a drawback, particularly when the engine is located between the steered wheels.

Flat engines were used by various automobile manufacturers – mostly with a boxer-four design – up until the late 1990s. Since then, only Porsche and Subaru have remained as significant manufacturers of flat engines.

=== Drivetrain layout ===

Due to the short length of flat engines, locating a flat engine outside of the car&#x27;s wheelbase results in minimal overhang. Therefore, many cars with flat engines have used a rear-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout. Examples include the flat-twin BMW 600 (1957–1959) and BMW 700 (1959–1965); the flat-four Tatra 97 (1936–1939), Volkswagen Beetle (1938–2003) and Porsche 356 (1948–1965); and the flat-six Chevrolet Corvair (1959–1969), Porsche 911 (1963-present), and Tucker 48 (1947–1948).

The opposite layout, front-engine front-wheel drive, was also common for cars with flat engines. Examples include the Citroën 2CV (1948–1990), Panhard Dyna X (1948–1954), Lancia Flavia (1961–1970), Citroën GS (1970–1986), Alfa Romeo Alfasud (1971–1989) and Subaru Leone (1971–1994).

Subaru have been producing cars with a front-engine, four-wheel-drive layout powered by flat engines (mostly boxer-four engines) since 1971. Examples include the Subaru Leone (1971–1994), Subaru Legacy (1989-present) and Subaru Impreza (1992–present). The front half-shafts come out of a front differential that is part of the gearbox. A rear driveshaft connects the gearbox to the rear half-shafts.

The traditional front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout is relatively uncommon for cars with flat engines, however some examples include the Toyota 86 / Subaru BRZ (2012–present), Jowett Javelin (1947–1953), Glas Isar (1958–1965) and the Tatra 11 (1923–1927).

===History===

The first flat engine was produced in 1897 by German engineer Karl Benz. Called the &quot;kontra&quot; engine, it was a boxer-twin design. Early uses of flat engines in cars include the 1900 Lanchester 8 hp Phaeton boxer-twin, the 1901 Wilson-Pilcher boxer-four, the 1904 Wilson-Pilcher &quot;18/24 HP&quot; boxer-six and the 1903 Ford Model A, the 1904 Ford Model C and the 1905 Ford Model F.

In 1938, the Volkswagen Beetle (then called the &quot;KdF-Wagen&quot;) was released with a rear-mounted flat-four engine. This Volkswagen air-cooled engine was produced for many years and also used in the Volkswagen Type 2 (Transporter, Kombi or Microbus), the Volkswagen Karmann Ghia sports car and the Volkswagen Type 3 compact car. A water-cooled version, known as the Wasserboxer, was introduced in 1982 and eventually replaced the air-cooled versions.

The majority of sports cars throughout Porsche&#x27;s history are powered by flat engines, beginning with its first car; the 1948-1965 Porsche 356 used an air-cooled boxer-four engine. Also using boxer-four engines were the 1969-1976 Porsche 914, the 1965-1969 Porsche 912 and the 2016-present Porsche Boxster/Cayman (982). The Porsche 911 has exclusively used boxer-six engines from its introduction in 1964 until the present. In 1997, the Porsche 911 switched from being air-cooled to water-cooled.

Porsche flat-eight engines were used in various racing cars throughout the 1960s, such as the 1962 Porsche 804 Formula One car and the 1968-1971 Porsche 908 sports car. A flat-twelve engine was also produced by Porsche for the 1969-1973 Porsche 917 sports car.

Chevrolet used a horizontally opposed air-cooled 6 cylinder engine in its Corvair line during its entire production run from 1960 to 1969 in various applications and power ratings, including one of the first uses of a turbocharger in a mass-produced automobile.

The Subaru EA engine was introduced in 1966 and began Subaru&#x27;s line of boxer-four engines that remain in production to this day. Most of Subaru&#x27;s models are powered by a boxer-four engine in either naturally aspirated or turbocharged form. A print ad for the 1973 Subaru GL coupe referred to the engine as &quot;quadrozontal&quot;. The company also produced boxer-six engines from 1988 to 1996 and 2001–2019. In 2008, the Subaru EE engine became the world&#x27;s first passenger car diesel boxer engine. This engine is a turbocharged boxer-four with common rail fuel injection.

Ferrari used flat-twelve engines for various Formula One cars in the 1970s. A road car flat-twelve engine (using a 180-degree V12 configuration) was used for the 1973-1984 Ferrari Berlinetta Boxer, 1984-1996 Ferrari Testarossa and their derivatives.

Toyota uses the designation &quot;Toyota 4U-GSE&quot; for the boxer-four engine in the Toyota-badged versions of the Toyota 86 / Subaru BRZ twins, although the engine is actually designed and built by Subaru as the Subaru FA20 engine.

<text>A flat-twin engine is a two-cylinder internal combustion engine with the cylinders on opposite sides of the crankshaft. The most common type of flat-twin engine is the boxer-twin engine, where both pistons move inwards and outwards at the same time.

The flat-twin design was patented by Karl Benz in 1896 and the first production flat-twin engine was used in the &quot;Lanchester 8 hp Phaeton&quot; car released in 1900. The flat-twin engine was used in several other cars since, however a more common usage is in motorcycles; early models oriented the cylinders in line with the frame, however later models switched to the cylinders being perpendicular to the frame to provide even cooling across both cylinders.

Flat-twin engines were also used in several aircraft up until the 1930s and in various stationary applications from the 1930s to the 1960s.

The Australian lawnmower manufacturer Victa also produced a flat-twin engine push mower from August 1975 to 1980 dubbed the ‘Twin 500’, and later the ‘Supreme’. These engines were manufactured in Canada. They are very sought after as only small numbers were produced, most likely due to ignition- and fuel-related problems in early models. In the Supreme (the later model) all these problems were fixed with a rear-domed piston, crankcase mixers and refined ignition system.

== Typical design ==
Most flat-twin engines use a boxer configuration for the crankshaft and are therefore called &quot;boxer-twin&quot; engines. In a boxer-twin engine, the 180° crankshaft moves the pistons in phase with each other, therefore the forces generated by one piston are cancelled out by the other, resulting in excellent primary balance. The evenly spaced firing order also assists in reducing vibration. The equal and opposite forces in a boxer-twin engine do however generate a rocking couple, due to the offset distance between the pistons along the crankshaft.
A commonly used ignition system is wasted spark, which is a simple ignition system using a double-ended coil firing both spark plugs on each revolution (i.e. during both the compression and exhaust strokes). This system is distributorless and requires only a single contact breaker and coil for the engine.

=== Crankcase pressure ===
The boxer-twin configuration can cause pressuring of the crankcase during each inward piston stroke and de-pressurisation during each outward piston stroke, since both pistons are moving inwards or outwards at the same time. This crankcase pumping effect (also found on single-cylinder engines and 360° parallel-twin engines) is usually addressed by means of a crankcase breather.

The Citroën 2CV boxer-twin engine took advantage of this pumping effect to maintain a partial vacuum inside the crankcase, in order to reduce oil leaks when an oil seal malfunctions. This was achieved by using a one-way valve (a leather or rubber flap over a hole in the crankcase), to let air escape the crankcase but not enter it.

==Applications==
===Automobiles===
The beginnings of the flat-twin engine were in 1896, when Karl Benz obtained a patent for the design. A year later, his company Benz &amp; Cie unveiled the first flat-twin engine, a boxer design called the &quot;contra engine&quot;.

In 1900, The Lanchester Engine Company began production of the &quot;Lanchester 8 hp Phaeton&quot;, which used a flat-twin engine. This engine had an unusual design of two counter-rotating crankshafts, with each piston attached to its crankshaft by a thick connecting rod. Each piston was also connected to the other crankshaft by two thinner connecting rods, causing the two pistons to move on the same axis. It also had the torque reaction of one crankshaft cancel the torque reaction of the other, cancelling torque reaction in the engine. Lanchester used this engine design until 1904.

Other early uses of flat-twin engines were 1903-04 Ford Model A, the 1904-1905 Ford Model C, the 1905-1906 Ford Model F. and several Jowett Cars models from 1910 to 1937.

The Citroën 2CV, produced from 1948 to 1990, was one of the first front-wheel drive cars to use a flat engine. The 2CV was powered by an air-cooled boxer-twin engine. Also in 1948, the Panhard Dyna X was released with front-wheel drive and an air-cooled boxer-twin engine. Other cars following World War II using boxer-twin engines were the 1945-1954 Jowett Bradford van, the 1961-1976 DAF Daffodil, the 1961-1978 Toyota Publica, the 1965-1969 Toyota Sports 800 sportscar and several front-wheel drive models from Citroën and Panhard. Several rear-engined cars were also produced with boxer-twin engines originally designed for motorcycles, such as the 1957-1975 Puch 500, the 1957-1959 BMW 600 and the 1959-1965 BMW 700. The Brazilian manufacturer Gurgel Motores used an in-house developed water-cooled boxer-twin engine (Enertron engine) and the Volkswagen air-cooled boxer-four in several models from 1988 to 1994.

The Toyota U engine was an air-cooled flat-twin engine produced from 1961 to 1976. Introduced in the Toyota Publica subcompact car, the U engine was also used in the Toyota MiniAce small commercial vehicle and the Toyota Sports 800 sports car.

===Motorcycles===
==== Transverse mounting ====
The benefits of using a flat-twin engine mounted with the crankshaft running perpendicular to the frame (therefore the cylinders being in line with the frame) are a low centre of gravity and that a belt-drive or chain-drive system can be used to transmit drive to the rear wheel. However, the downsides are uneven heat distribution (the front cylinder is more heavily cooled than the rear cylinder) and a longer wheelbase is often required due to the length of the engine.

The first flat-twin motorcycle engine was built in 1905 by the Light Motors Company in the United Kingdom. Originally named the Fée (renamed &quot;Fairy&quot; soon after its introduction), it was designed as a &quot;bicycle engine system&quot; which transmitted power to a pulley on the rear wheel via a chain. Manufacture of the Fairy was taken over by the Douglas Engineering Company, one of Light Motors&#x27; suppliers, when the Light Motors Company folded in 1907. Later in 1907, Douglas changed the drivetrain from the chain and pulley design to a belt-drive system driven directly from the engine. Later developments of the Douglas motorcycle were made with the cylinders in line with the frame until the Second World War.

Other early flat-twin motorcycles used a similar layout, with their cylinders aligned along the frame and therefore with the crankshaft running transverse to the frame.

In 1914 the main supplier of rear-hub gearboxes, Sturmey-Archer, introduced a 3-speed countershaft gearbox with integral kick-starter, which posed a design problem for motorcycles with transversely-mounted flat-twin engines. This gearbox could be relatively easily located behind a single-cylinder or V-twin engine, however this arrangement would result in an excessively long wheelbase for flat-twin engines. Solutions to this problem included using a countershaft below the engine (as used by the Douglas Fairy), or a gearbox located above the engine, although in some cases the cylinders were short enough to use the gearbox in the traditional location behind the engine.

In 1916, most flat-twin motorcycles still used a transversely-mounted engine. The European models at this time included the Bradbury , the Brough HB, the Douglas and models, the Humber 3.5 hp and models, the Matchless 6 hp, the Montgomery 6 hp, Williamson Flat Twin , and the Bayerische Flugzeugwerke Helios (the predecessor to BMW&#x27;s first motorcycle). Models produced in the United States included the Indian Model O and the Harley-Davidson Model W.

==== Longitudinal mounting ====
The main benefit of mounting a flat-twin engine with the crankshaft in line with the frame (therefore the cylinders sitting sideways in the frame) is that an air-cooled engine receives the same amount of cooling for each cylinder. The Harley-Davidson XA, which used a flat-twin engine with the cylinders across the frame, maintained an oil temperature 100 °F (56 °C) cooler than a Harley-Davidson WLA with a V-twin with the cylinders in line with the frame. A side benefit is that the cylinders provide protection to the rider in the event of a collision or fall, and keeps their feet warm in cold weather. The downsides are that the engine cannot be mounted as close to the ground (otherwise the cylinders can scrape the ground during cornering) and that it exposes the cylinders and valve covers to the danger of collision damage.

Longitudinal mounting also means that the torque reaction will twist the motorcycle to one side (such as on sharp acceleration/deceleration or when opening the throttle in neutral) instead of shifting the weight balance between the front and rear wheels. However, many modern motorcycles reduce this effect by rotating flywheels or alternators in the opposite direction to that of the crankshaft.

One of the first motorcycles with a longitudinally-mounted flat-twin engine was the 1916 ABC, which was built in the United Kingdom. To accommodate chain drive, the ABC used a bevel drive at the gearbox to change the direction of the drive through ninety degrees. BMW&#x27;s first motorcycle, the 1923 BMW R 32 was another early example of a longitudinally-mounted flat-twin engine, although it this case the power was transmitted to the rear wheel via a shaft drive.

Over time, longitudinal mounting became more common for flat-twin engines. BMW has a long history of flat-twin engine motorcycles, as do Ural (Russia) and Dnepr (Ukraine).
===Aviation===
In 1902, the Pearse monoplane (which would later become one of the first aircraft to achieve flight) was powered by a flat-twin engine built on a farm by a hobbyist inventor. This engine used the unusual design of a single shared crank pin and double acting pistons. In 1908, the French company Dutheil-Chalmers began production of flat-twin aircraft engines, which used two counter-rotating crankshafts. The Dutheil-Chlamers engine was used by the 1907 Santos-Dumont Demoiselle &quot;No. 20&quot; experimental airplane, with later versions of this airplane being produced with flat-twin engines from Darracq and Clément-Bayard.

Most piston-engined aircraft used more than two cylinders, however other flat-twin aircraft engines from the 1920s and 1930s include the American Aeronca E-107 and Aeronca E-113, the British Bristol Cherub, and the Czechoslovakian Praga B2. The HKS 700E is an oil-cooled flat twin for ultralight aircraft that is currently in production.

In larger aircraft, flat-twin engines have been used in auxiliary power units (APUs). A notable example was made by ABC Motors in the 1920s and 1930s. During World War II, the Riedel firm in Germany designed and manufactured a two-stroke flat-twin engine as jet engine starter motors for the Junkers Jumo 004, BMW 003 and Heinkel HeS 011 jet engines

=== Other uses ===
The Maytag &#x27;Model 72&#x27; flat-twin engines— produced from 1937 until some time between 1952 and 1960— were used in various applications including clothes washing machines.

Electrical generators using flat-twin engines were built by Norman Engineering Company from 1932 to 1968 and by Douglas during World War II. &quot;Enfield Industrial Engines&quot; (part of Royal Enfield) produced flat-twin two-stroke petrol engines during World War II which were used for generators and other military uses. After 1945, Enfield produced flat-twin diesel engines, with applications including farm and marine use. Coventry Victor introduced a diesel version of its existing 688 cc petrol flat-twin in 1932, and went on to produce flat-twin diesel and petrol engines for a variety of industrial and marine uses into the 1950s.

Two-stroke flat-twins were often used as outboard motors for boats, as they were smoother than single-cylinder engines. In the 1940s, they were largely replaced by straight-twin two-stroke engines, which were easier to start and no longer had excessive amounts of vibration.

<text>A flat-four engine, also known as a horizontally opposed-four engine or boxer engine, is a four-cylinder piston engine with two banks of cylinders lying on opposite sides of a common crankshaft. The most common type of flat-four engine is the boxer-four engine, each pair of opposed pistons moves inwards and outwards at the same time.

A boxer-four engine has perfect primary and secondary balance, however, the two cylinder heads means the design is more expensive to produce than a straight-four engine. There is a minor, secondary unbalanced rotational torque pulse in the plane of the pistons, when a piston pair at one end of the engine is at TDC and the other pair at BDC. The TDC pair creates a torque greater than the BDC pair, so the net unbalanced torque pulse is the difference. The difference in TDC vs BDC inertial forces is explained in the Engine balance section. Boxer-four engines have been used in cars since 1897, especially by Volkswagen and Subaru. They have also occasionally been used in motorcycles and frequently in aircraft. Cessna and Piper use flat four engines from Lycoming and Continental in the most common civil aircraft in the world - the Cessna 172, and Piper Cherokee, while many ultralight and LSA planes use versions of the Rotax 912.

== Design ==

In a flat-four engine, each pair of opposing pistons successively moves inwards together and outwards together. The advantages of the boxer-four layout are perfect secondary vibration (resulting in minimal vibration), a low centre of gravity, and a short engine length. Flat-four engine have successfully used air cooling, although air-cooled engines are noisier and have a lower power output than an equivalent engine with liquid cooling. In light aircraft, where lightness is of primary importance, air-cooling has traditionally been common.

The downsides of boxer-four engines (compared with inline-four engines) are their extra width, the increased costs associated with having two cylinder heads instead of one, and the long exhaust manifold required to achieve evenly spaced exhaust pulses. Due to these factors, straight-four engines are more common in cars than are flat-four engines, and V6 engines are often used where larger displacements are required.

=== Engine balance ===
The equal and opposing forces generated in a boxer-four engine result in perfect secondary balance (unlike the unbalanced vertical forces produced by inline-four engines). Boxer-four engines are therefore better suited to displacements above , since they do not require balance shafts to reduce the secondary vibration.

In a boxer engine, each cylinder is slightly offset from its opposing pair due to the distance between the crankpin journals. This offset gives rise to a slight rocking couple, but any resulting vibration is normally insufficient to require balance shafts.

As with all four-stroke engines of four cylinders or fewer, the lack of overlap in the power strokes results in a pulsating delivery of torque to the flywheel, causing a torsional vibration along the crankshaft axis. Such vibration, if excessive, may be minimised using a harmonic damper.

=== Exhaust manifold ===
The typical firing order for a boxer-four engine is for the left bank of cylinders to ignite one after another, followed by the right bank of cylinders (or vice versa), with the firing interval evenly spaced at 180 degrees. Traditionally, the exhausts from the two cylinders on each bank were merged, with the resulting uneven exhaust pulses causing a characteristic &quot;flat-four burble&quot; exhaust sound.

The other common exhaust configuration (such as used by Subaru since the mid-2000s) is to pair the cylinders with a firing interval offset of 360 degrees, in order to optimise the exhaust pulses. This configuration requires long exhaust manifolds, in order to pair the cylinders on opposite banks, and results in a less distinctive exhaust sound.

== Use in automobiles ==
=== 1900–1935 ===

In 1900, the first flat-four engine was produced by Benz &amp; Cie, based on Benz&#x27;s 1897 &quot;contra&quot; flat-twin engine. This engine was used in Benz racing cars, produced , had a displacement of and was designed by Georg Diehl.

London company Wilson-Pilcher released its first car in 1901, which was powered by a flat-four engine. This engine was mounted longitudinally in the chassis, water-cooled, produced and had a displacement of . Unusually for its day, the bore and stroke were equal, with each being .

In 1902 the Buffum automobile was equipped with opposed four cylinder engines that were rated at 16 horsepower. Herbert H. Buffum produced an American Automobile called the Buffum in Abington, Massachusetts from 1903 to 1907.

Having previously produced flat-twin engines, the 1926 Tatra 30 was the Czech company&#x27;s first model powered by a flat-four engine. Tatra produced various flat-four engined model through the 1920s and 1930s.
=== 1936–1999 ===

The 1936 Tatra T97 pioneered the rear-engined, air-cooled flat-four, backbone chassis layout (later used by the Volkswagen Beetle), and at the same time, though unrelated, came the Steyr 50 from Austria, sporting a front boxer 4 engine with rear wheel drive. Also in 1936, English company Jowett expanded its model range from flat-twin engines to also include flat-four engines. Production of Jowett flat-four engines continued until 1954, when the Jowett Javelin saloon and Jowett Jupiter sports models ended production.

The longest production flat-four engine is the Volkswagen air-cooled engine, which was produced from 1938 until 2006 and was most famously used in the rear-engined 1938–2003 Volkswagen Beetle and 1950–1983 Volkswagen Transporter. This air-cooled engine was designed by Porsche and was also used in the 1948–1965 Porsche 356, 1953–1956 Porsche 550, 1965–1969 Porsche 912 and 1969–1976 Porsche 914. In 1984, to comply with exhaust emissions regulations a water-cooled version called the Volkswagen Wasserboxer engine was introduced in the Volkswagen Transporter (T3)

During the 1960s and 1970s, several manufacturers produced flat-four engines including the air-cooled Citroën flat-four engine, the water-cooled Alfa Romeo flat-four engine, the water-cooled Lancia flat-four engine and the water-cooled Subaru EA engine.

Two important engines designed during this period, but never saw the light of day in series production, were the Morris 800cc side valve engine by Alec Issigonis in 1947 originally destined for the Morris Minor, and the Ferguson 2.2 litre SOHC engine by Claude Hill in 1966 as part of the R5 vehicle research project.

=== 2000–present===
By 2000, most manufacturers had replaced flat-four engines with inline-four engines. A notable exception is Subaru, with the water-cooled Subaru EJ engine being available in turbocharged form in the Subaru WRX sports sedan and its World Rally Car counterpart. Subaru&#x27;s adoption of all-wheel drive was a factor in retaining the flat-four engine, since the shorter length of this engine assists in fitting the all-wheel drive components into the chassis. Although it is more expensive than an inline-four engine, the flat-four engine allows Subaru to build an all-wheel drive vehicle at little extra cost from two-wheel drive.

In 2012, a naturally aspirated version of the Subaru FA engine was used in the Toyota 86 (also called the &quot;Subaru BRZ&quot; and &quot;Scion FR-S&quot;) rear-wheel drive sports coupe. This engine is water-cooled, has gasoline direct injection, produces and has a displacement of .

The 2016 Porsche Boxster/Cayman (982) mid-engined sports cars downsized from a naturally aspirated flat-six engine to a turbocharged flat-four engine, Porsche&#x27;s first flat-four since the mid-1970s. This engine is produced in displacements of and produces up to . Several reviewers criticised the Boxster/Cayman for an uninspiring engine sound.

== Use in motorcycles ==

Most motorcycles with four-cylinder engines use a straight-four engine layout, however, several flat-four engine engines have been used in shaft drive motorcycles:
* 1938–1939 Zündapp K800 (air-cooled)
* 1974–1987 Honda Gold Wing (liquid-cooled)
* 1955–1956 Wooler 500cc (air-cooled)
* 1981–1982 , using the air-cooled Citroën flat-four car engine. Approximately 450 were built, with one quarter of these purchased by the French police.

== Use in aircraft ==
Light aircraft commonly use flat-four engines with displacements up to from manufacturers such as Rotax, Lycoming Engines, Continental Motors and Franklin Engine Company.

For radio-controlled aircraft, flat-four engines with displacements of are produced by companies such as O.S. Engines.

A notable recent flat-four aero-engine is the side-valve Belgian D-Motor LF26. Although the side-valve format has long been abandoned for most automotive applications because its combustion chamber is a bar to high engine rpm, the massively over-square (1.295:1) D-Motor is a very simple, low-revving, compact, reliable lightweight aero-engine (without the heavy complication of ohv valve-gear)

<doc id="199974" wikidata="Q5032673" url="?curid=199974" title="Cannibals and Kings">
<text>Cannibals and Kings (1977, ) is a book written by American anthropologist Marvin Harris. The book presents a systematic discussion of ideas about the reasons for a culture making a transition by stages from egalitarian hunter-gatherer to hierarchically based states as population density increases.

== Content ==
According to Harris, humans shifted from a low-carbohydrate diet largely based on hunter-gatherer sources to a high-carbohydrate diet largely based on agricultural when intensive agriculture began. Harris posits that this diet change resulted in more body fat, which for females led to earlier menarche and smaller reduction in fertility from nursing infants, which then led to shorter periods between pregnancies.

Harris also describes the state of the world in the late 19th century as one of approaching catastrophe as predicted by Malthus (Malthusian catastrophe). Harris then discusses three 20th century innovations that explain this postponement of the catastrophe: the exploitation of petroleum, reliable contraceptives, and social changes in some cultures that make smaller families more desirable.

=== Pork as a taboo food ===
&quot;Cannibals and Kings&quot; discusses the development of pork as a taboo food in ancient Israelite society. Harris argues that while cattle, sheep, and many other domesticated animals consume grass, pigs are poor grazers and compete with humans for grain. In addition, pigs produce only meat, compared with cattle and goats, which also provide milk, transport, and labor.

This led to pigs being reviled, and he argues this gave rise to the pig as a non-kosher food in the Old Testament. He briefly discusses the other Jewish food taboos. Harris notes that pigs were also taboo in Ancient Egypt and continue to be forbidden by Islam, suggesting that environmental rather than cultural factors were responsible for putting this food animal off-limits.

=== Holy cows ===
Harris also discusses the cow as a sacred animal and taboo food in Hindu culture. Unlike the Middle Eastern civilizations, India had developed very productive forms of agriculture, requiring heavy labor. The high population densities and the periodic droughts rendered animal husbandry for food purposes impractical, and slowly led to the ending of animal sacrifice. Cattle remained an important species because it provided farm labor.

Desperation incurred during periods of drought might lead to the temptation to slaughter and eat the work animals for short-term survival; this would damage long-term prospects by destroying the means of production. Harris argues that this situation led to the evolution of the cow as a taboo food and its worship as a sacred creature in India.

=== Irrigation for agriculture ===
Harris examines the concept of the hydraulic empire, ancient civilizations such as China, Persia, and Egypt that were reliant on water for agriculture. The necessity of labor-intensive projects such as irrigation, canals, and flood control dikes led to the development of strong, centralized, and despotic states to mobilize the needed manpower for construction. Despite foreign conquest or change of government, the nature of such states would remain essentially unchanged because of the unchanging need to mobilize human labor.

Because European agriculture relied upon rainfall and not irrigation, Harris argues, European rulers under feudalism were unable to effectively monopolize power and restrict the rising power of towns. The growth of towns and cities, from a combination of population growth and urban migration, would lead to early forms of market economies.

<doc id="199977" wikidata="Q294344" url="?curid=199977" title="Emmanuel Joseph Sieyès">
<text>Emmanuel Joseph Sieyès (3 May 174820 June 1836), usually known as the Abbé Sieyès (), was a French Roman Catholic &quot;abbé&quot;, clergyman, and political writer who was a leading political theorist of the French Revolution (1789–1799); he also held offices in the governments of the French Consulate (1799–1804) and the First French Empire (1804–1815). His pamphlet &quot;What Is the Third Estate?&quot; (1789) became the political manifesto of the Revolution, which facilitated transforming the Estates-General into the National Assembly, in June 1789. He was offered and refused an office in the French Directory (1795–1799). After becoming a director in 1799, Sieyès was among the instigators of the Coup of 18 Brumaire (9 November), which installed Napoleon Bonaparte in power.

In addition to his political and clerical life, Sieyès coined the term &quot;sociologie&quot;, and contributed to the nascent social sciences.

==Early life==
Emmanuel-Joseph Sieyès was born on 3 May 1748, the fifth child of Honoré and Annabelle Sieyès, in the southern French town of Fréjus. Honoré Sieyès was a local tax collector of modest income; although they claimed some noble blood, the family Sieyès were commoners. Emmanuel-Joseph received his earliest education from tutors and Jesuits; and later attended the &quot;collège&quot; of the &quot;Doctrinaires&quot; of Draguignan. His ambition to become a professional soldier was thwarted by frail health, which, combined with the piety of his parents, led to pursuing a religious career; to that effect, the vicar-general of Fréjus aided Emmanuel-Joseph, out of obligation to his father, Honoré.

==Education==
Sieyès spent ten years at the seminary of Saint-Sulpice in Paris. There, he studied theology and engineering to prepare himself to enter the priesthood. He quickly gained a reputation at the school for his aptitude and interest in the sciences, combined with his obsession over the &quot;new philosophic principles&quot; and dislike for conventional theology. Sieyès was educated for priesthood in the Catholic Church at the Sorbonne. While there, he became influenced by the teachings of John Locke, David Hume, Edward Gibbon, Voltaire, Jean-Jaques Rousseau, Condillac, Quesnay, Mirabeau, Turgot, the Encyclopédistes, and other Enlightenment political thinkers, all in preference to theology. In 1770, he obtained his first theology diploma, ranking at the bottom of the list of passing candidates – a reflection of his antipathy toward his religious education. In 1772, he was ordained as a priest, and two years later he obtained his theology license.

==Religious career==

Despite Sieyès&#x27; embrace of Enlightenment thinking, he was ordained to the priesthood in 1773, but was not hired immediately. He spent time researching philosophy and developing music until about a year later in October 1774 when, as the result of demands by powerful friends, he was promised a canonry in Brittany. Unfortunately for Sieyès, this canonry went into effect only when the preceding holder died. At the end of 1775, Sieyès acquired his first real position as secretary to the bishop of Tréguier where he spent two years as deputy of the diocese. It is here that he sat in the Estates of Brittany and became disgusted with the immense power the privileged classes held. In 1780, the bishop of Tréguier was transferred to the bishopric of Chartres, and Sieyès accompanied him there as his vicar general, eventually becoming a canon of the cathedral and chancellor of the diocese of Chartres. Due to the fact that the bishop of Tréguier had high regards for Sieyès, he was able to act as a representative of his diocese in the Upper Chamber of the Clergy. It was during this time that Sieyès became aware of the ease with which nobles advanced in ecclesiastical offices compared to commoners. In particular, he was resentful of the privileges granted to the nobles within the Church system and thought the patronage system was a humiliation for commoners.

While remaining in ecclesiastical offices, Sieyès maintained a religious cynicism at odds with his position. By the time he determined to enter priesthood, Sieyès had &quot;freed himself from all superstitious sentiments and ideas&quot;. Even when corresponding with his deeply religious father, Sieyès showed a severe lack of piety for the man in charge of the diocese of Chartres. It is theorised that Sieyès accepted a religious career not because he had any sort of strong religious inclination, but because he considered it the only means to advance his career as a political writer.

==&quot;What Is the Third Estate?&quot;==
In 1788, Louis XVI of France proposed the convocation of the Estates-General of France after an interval of more than a century and a half. This proposal, and Jacques Necker&#x27;s invitation to French writers to state their views as to the organization of society by Estates, enabled Sieyès to publish his celebrated January 1789 pamphlet, &quot;Qu&#x27;est-ce que le tiers-état?&quot; (&quot;What Is the Third Estate?&quot;). He begins his answer:
This phrase, which was to remain famous, is said to have been inspired by Nicolas Chamfort. The pamphlet was very successful, and its author, despite his clerical vocation (which made him part of the First Estate), was elected as the last (the twentieth) of the deputies to the Third Estate from Paris to the Estates-General. He played his main role in the opening years of the Revolution, participating in the final drafting of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, expanding on the theories of national sovereignty, popular sovereignty, and representation implied in his pamphlet, with a distinction between active and passive citizens that justified suffrage limited to male owners of property.

Sieyès&#x27;s pamphlet incited a radical reaction from its audience because it involved the &quot;political issues of the day and twisted them in a more revolutionary direction&quot;. In the third chapter of the pamphlet, Sieyès proposed that the Third Estate wanted to be &quot;something&quot;. But he also stated that, in allowing the privileged orders to exist, they are asking to become &quot;the least thing possible&quot;. The usage of such rhetoric in his pamphlet appealed to common causes to unite the audience. At the same time it influenced them to move beyond simple demands and take a more radical position on the nature of government. In this case, the radical position taken by the Third Estate created a sense of awareness that the problems of France were not simply a matter of addressing &quot;royal tyranny&quot;, but that unequal privileges under the law had divided the nation. It was from this point that the Revolution&#x27;s struggle for fair distribution of power and equal rights began in earnest.

===Impact on the Revolution===
Sieyès&#x27;s pamphlet played a key role in shaping the currents of revolutionary thought that propelled France towards the French Revolution. In his pamphlet, he outlined the desires and frustrations of the alienated class of people that made up the Third Estate. He attacked the foundations of the French Ancien Régime by arguing the nobility to be a fraudulent institution, preying on an overburdened and despondent bourgeoisie. The pamphlet voiced concerns that were to become crucial matters of debate during the convocation of the Estates-General of 1789.

Whereas the aristocracy defined themselves as an élite ruling class charged with maintaining the social order in France, Sieyès saw the Third Estate as representing the nation whether or not the other two orders were present. The pamphlet placed sovereignty not in the hands of aristocrats but instead defined the nation of France by its productive orders composed of those who would generate services and produce goods for the benefit of the entire society. These included not only those involved in agricultural labor and craftsmanship, but also merchants, brokers, lawyers, financiers and others providing services. Sieyès challenged the hierarchical order of society by redefining who represented the nation. In his pamphlet, he condemns the privileged orders by saying their members were enjoying the best products of society without contributing to their production. Sieyès essentially argued that the aristocracy&#x27;s privileges established it as an alien body acting outside of the nation of France, and deemed noble privilege &quot;treason to the commonwealth&quot;.

Sieyès&#x27;s pamphlet had a significant influence on the structural concerns that arose surrounding the convocation of the Estates general. Specifically, the Third Estate demanded that the number of deputies for their order be equal to that of the two privileged orders combined, and most controversially &quot;that the States General Vote, Not by Orders, but by Heads&quot;. The pamphlet took these issues to the masses and their partial appeasement was met with revolutionary reaction. By addressing the issues of representation directly, Sieyès inspired resentment and agitation that united the third estate against the feudalistic traditions of the Ancien Régime. As a result, the Third Estate demanded the reorganization of the Estates General, but the two other orders proved unable or unwilling to provide a solution. Sieyès proposed that the members of the First and Second order join the Third Estate and become a united body to represent the nation as a whole. He not only suggested an invitation, however, but also stated that the Third Estate had the right to consider those who denied this invitation to be in default of their national responsibility. The Third Estate adopted this measure on 5 June 1789; by doing so, they assumed the authority to represent the nation. Sieyès convinced the Third Estate to adopt the term National Assembly and was elected by the Assembly to its constitutional committee in July 1789.
Serving on the constitutional committee, Sieyès argued that the Assembly should not need to seek the King&#x27;s approval on constitutional matters. Sieyès advocated for equality of voting power, a unicameral legislative body, and the absence of a royal veto over the actions of the legislature. Taking the position that the National Assembly held absolute power as the only true representative of the nation, Sieyès rejected arguments that the King should be able to initiate new elections for the Assembly or have the power to veto legislation. Sieyès believed that representatives to the Assembly must be free both from influence from above by the King and from influence from below by the people. While voters had the right to put into or take out representatives from power, for the term they were elected, Sieyès held, representatives should be answerable to no one. In September 1789, Sieyès triumphed over the more moderate members of the Assembly led by Mounier when the Assembly voted for a unicameral legislature by a vote of 849 to 89 with 122 abstaining.

==Assemblies, Convention, and the Terror==
Although not noted as a public speaker as he spoke rarely and briefly, Sieyès held major political influence, and he recommended the decision of the Estates to reunite its chamber as the National Assembly; he opposed the abolition of tithes and the confiscation of Church lands. His opposition to the abolition of tithes discredited him in the National Assembly, and he was never able to regain his authority. Elected to the special committee on the constitution, he opposed the right of &quot;absolute veto&quot; for the King of France, which Honoré de Mirabeau unsuccessfully supported. He had considerable influence on the framing of the departmental system; after the spring of 1790, he was eclipsed by other politicians, and was elected only once to the post of fortnightly president of the Constituent Assembly.

Like all other members of the Constituent Assembly, he was excluded from the Legislative Assembly by the ordinance, initially proposed by Maximilien Robespierre, that decreed that none of its members should be eligible for the next legislature. He reappeared in the third national Assembly, known as the National Convention of the French Republic (September 1792September 1795). He voted for the death of Louis XVI, but not in the contemptuous terms sometimes ascribed to him. He participated to the Constitution Committee that drafted the Girondin constitutional project. Menaced by the Reign of Terror and offended by its character, Sieyès even abjured his faith at the time of the installation of the Cult of Reason; afterwards, when asked what he had done during the Terror, he famously replied, &quot;&quot; (&quot;I lived&quot;).

Ultimately, Sieyès failed to establish the kind of bourgeois revolution he had hoped for, one of representative order &quot;devoted to the peaceful pursuit of material comfort&quot;. His initial purpose was to instigate change in a more passive way, and to establish a constitutional monarchy. According to William Sewell, Sieyès&#x27; pamphlet set &quot;the tone and direction of The French Revolution … but its author could hardly control the Revolution&#x27;s course over the long run&quot;. Even after 1791, when the monarchy seemed to many to be doomed, Sieyès &quot;continued to assert his belief in the monarchy&quot;, which indicated he did not intend for the Revolution to take the course it did.
During the period he served in the National Assembly, Sieyès wanted to establish a constitution that would guarantee the rights of French men and would uphold equality under the law as the social goal of the Revolution; he was ultimately unable to accomplish his goal.

==Directory==
After the execution of Robespierre in 1794, Sieyès reemerged as an important political player during the constitutional debates that followed. In 1795, he went on a diplomatic mission to The Hague, and was instrumental in drawing up a treaty between the French and Batavian republics. He resented the Constitution of the Year III enacted by the Directory, and refused to serve as a Director of the Republic. In May 1798, he went as the plenipotentiary of France to the court of Berlin, in order to try to induce Prussia to ally with France against the Second Coalition; this effort ultimately failed. His prestige grew nonetheless, and he was made Director of France in place of Jean-François Rewbell in May 1799.

Nevertheless, Sieyès considered ways to overthrow the Directory, and is said to have taken in view the replacement of the government with unlikely rulers such as Archduke Charles of Austria and Karl Wilhelm Ferdinand of Brunswick (a major enemy of the Revolution). He attempted to undermine the constitution, and thus caused the revived Jacobin Club to be closed while making offers to General Joubert for a .

==Second Consul of France==
The death of Joubert at the Battle of Novi and the return of Napoleon Bonaparte from the Egypt campaign put an end to this project, but Sieyès regained influence by reaching a new understanding with Bonaparte. In the coup of 18 Brumaire, Sieyès and his allies dissolved the Directory, allowing Napoleon to seize power. Thereafter, Sieyès produced the constitution which he had long been planning, only to have it completely remodeled by Bonaparte, who thereby achieved a coup within a coup – Bonaparte&#x27;s Constitution of the Year VIII became the basis of the French Consulate of 1799–1804.

The Corps législatif appointed Bonaparte, Sieyès, and Roger Ducos as &quot;Consuls of the French Republic&quot;. In order to once again begin the function of government, these three men took the oath of &quot;Inviolable fidelity to the sovereignty of the people; to the French Republic, one and indivisible; to equality, liberty and the representative system&quot;. Although Sieyès had many ideas, a lot of them were disfavored by Bonaparte and Roger-Ducos. One aspect that was agreed upon was the structure of power. A list of active citizens formed the basis of the proposed political structure. This list was to choose one-tenth of its members to form a communal list eligible for local office; from the communal list, one-tenth of its members were to form a departmental list; finally, one further list was made up from one-tenth of the members of the departmental list to create the national list. This national list is where the highest officials of the land were to be chosen.

Sieyès envisioned a and a to act as the shell of the national government. The would present laws and discuss ratification of these laws in front of a jury. This jury would not have any say in terms of what the laws granted consist of, but rather whether or not these laws passed. The would be renewed from the national list. The main responsibility of the was to choose the members of the two legislative bodies, and protect the constitution by right of absorption. By this curious provision, the could forcibly elect to its ranks any individual deemed dangerous to the safety of the state, who would then be disqualified from any other office. This was a way to keep a closer eye on anyone who threatened the state. The power of the was extended to electing the titular head of government, the . The would hold office for life but have no power. If the threatened to become dangerous, the would absorb him. The central idea of Sieyès&#x27; plan was a division of power.

==Napoleonic era and final years==
Sieyès soon retired from the post of provisional Consul, which he had accepted after 18 Brumaire, and became one of the first members of the Sénat conservateur (acting as its president in 1799); this concession was attributed to the large estate at Crosne that he received from Napoleon. After the plot of the Rue Saint-Nicaise in late December 1800, Sieyès defended the arbitrary and illegal proceedings whereby Napoleon rid himself of the leading Jacobins.

During the era of the First Empire (1804–1814), Sieyès rarely emerged from his retirement. When Napoleon briefly returned to power in 1815, Sieyès was named to the Chamber of Peers. In 1816, after the Second Restoration, Sieyès was expelled from the Academy of Moral and Political Sciences by Louis XVIII. He then moved to Brussels, but returned to France after the July Revolution of 1830. He died in Paris in 1836 at the age of 88.

==Contribution to social sciences==
In 1795, Sieyès became one of the first members of what would become the Academy of Moral and Political Sciences of the Institute of France. When the Académie Française was reorganized in 1803, he was elected in the second class, replacing, in chair 31, Jean Sylvain Bailly, who had been guillotined on 12 November 1793 during the Reign of Terror. However, after the second Restoration in 1815, Sieyès was expelled for his role in the execution of King Louis XVI, and was replaced by the Marquis of Lally-Tollendal, who was named to the Academy by a royal decree.

In 1780, Sieyès coined the term &quot;sociologie&quot; in an unpublished manuscript. The term was used again fifty years later by the philosopher Auguste Comte to refer to the science of society, which is known in English as sociology. Sieyès was also among the first to employ the term &quot;science sociale&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Sieyès was always considered intellectual and intelligent by his peers and mentors alike. Through the virtue of his own thoughts, he progressed in his ideologies from personal experiences. Starting at a young age, he began to feel repulsion towards the privileges of the nobility. He deemed this advantage gained by noble right as unfair to those of the lower class. This distaste he felt for the privileged class became evident during his time at the Estates of Brittany where he was able to observe, with dissatisfaction, domination by the nobility.

Aside from his opinions towards nobility, Sieyès also had a passion for music. He devoted himself assiduously to cultivating music as he had plenty of spare time. Along with cultivating music, Sieyes also enjoyed writing reflections concerning these pieces. Sieyès had a collection of musical pieces he called &quot;&quot;.

Although Sieyès was passionate about his ideologies, he had a rather uninvolved social life. His journals and papers held much information about his studies but almost nothing pertaining to his personal life. His associates referred to him as cold and vain. In particular, Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord remarked that &quot;Men are in his eyes chess-pieces to be moved, they occupy his mind but say nothing to his heart.&quot;

<text>Jacques Antoine Marie de Cazalès (February 1, 1758 – November 24, 1805) was a French orator and politician. De Cazalès was born at Grenade, Haute-Garonne to a family of the lower nobility. With his father as an adviser to the parliament of Toulouse, Cazalès undertook a career in the military, becoming captain of the dragoons at the age of 21. In this political career, he proved to be a devout representative of the right, becoming the elected deputy of the nobility for the Verdun countries. His rightist ideals and orations made him political enemies, such as Barnarve, who scarred Cazalès in a duel. As a moderate conservative, Cazalès favored an intermediate system of government, between absolute and constitutional monarchy. It is not surprising that he was thus close to Edmund Burke, who held similar views, and served as a source of information and intelligence to British leaders during the French Revolution. Cazalès also tried to found a conservative-liberal party, along with Mirabeau. His son, Edmond de Cazalès (fr), wrote philosophical and religious studies.

==Early life==
de Cazalès was born at Grenade, Haute-Garonne, in a family of the lower nobility.

Cazalès was not very educated as a young man. His father, mostly concerned with his duties to parliament, had little time to secure Cazalès&#x27; education. With his studies suspended at twelve, the young Cazalès turned to a career in the military, and at fifteen years old, entered in a regiment of dragoons. He made an honest name for himself and by the age of 21, he would become a captain.

Cazalès, however, wanted to pursue a career outside of the military and so sought an education. He taught himself through the works of historians and publicists. With a special interest in law, he studied the history of English government. His fascination in government brought him to Montesquieu&#x27;s school, where he studied the principles of government, liberty, and the separation of powers within government.

== Political career ==
In his early political life, Cazalès was imprisoned for his efforts against Parlement Maupeou. In the Constituent Assembly he belonged to the section of moderate royalists who sought to set up a constitution on the British model, and his speeches in favour of retaining the right of war and peace in the king&#x27;s hands and on the organization of the judiciary gained the applause even of his opponents. Although he left few records of his speeches or his personal life, his political beliefs and ideologies were published in journals like the &quot;Moniteur.&quot; 

Among Cazalès&#x27; beliefs was the belief that men were not equal and maintained the difference between active and passive citizens. He did not find it necessary to grant equality to slaves nor to women. One of his more prominent positions was that of private property, which he fought vigorously to protect in the Constituent Assembly, feeling that it is a &quot;sacred and inviolable right.&quot;

Apart from his eloquence, which gave him a place among the finest orators of the Assembly, Cazalès is mainly remembered for a duel fought with Barnave, in which Cazalès was wounded in the forehead. After the insurrection of August 10, 1792, which led to the downfall of royalty, Cazalès emigrated. He fought in the army of the émigrés against revolutionary France. He later urged the Convention the privilege of defending Louis XVI before the court, publishing a remarkable argument in his defense. Back in France in 1803, he lived with little public presence until his death in 1805.

<text>KDevelop is a free and open-source integrated development environment (IDE) for Unix-like computer operating systems and Windows. It provides editing, navigation and debugging features for several programming languages, and integration with build automation and version-control systems, using a plugin-based architecture.

KDevelop 5 has parser backends for C, C++, Objective-C, OpenCL and JavaScript/QML, with plugins supporting PHP, Python 3 and Ruby. Basic syntax highlighting and code folding are available for dozens of other source-code and markup formats, but without semantic analysis.

KDevelop is part of the KDE project, and is based on KDE Frameworks and Qt. The C/C++ backend uses Clang to provide accurate information even for very complex codebases.

==History==
KDevelop 0.1 was released in 1998, with 1.0 following in late 1999. 1.x and 2.x were developed over a period of four years from the original codebase.

It is believed that Sandy Meier originated KDevelop. Ralf Nolden is also known to be an early developer of the project. In 1998 Sandy Meier started KDevelop and worked 8 weeks alone on this project. Since then, the KDevelop IDE is publicly available under the GPL and supports many programming languages.

Bernd Gehrmann started a complete rewrite and announced KDevelop 3.x in March 2001. Its first release was together with K Desktop Environment 3.2 in February 2004, and development of KDevelop 3.x continued until 2008.

KDevelop 4.x, another complete rewrite with a more object-oriented programming model, was developed from August 2005 and released as KDevelop 4.0.0 in May 2010. The last feature update of this branch was version 4.7.0 in September 2014, with bugfix releases continuing until KDevelop 4.7.4 in December 2016

KDevelop 5 development began in August 2014 as a continuation of the 4.x codebase, ported to Qt5 and KDE Frameworks 5. The custom C++ parser used in earlier versions, which had poor support for C++11 syntax, was replaced by a new Clang-based backend. The integrated CMakeFile interpreter was also removed in favour of JSON metadata produced by the upstream CMake tool.

Semantic language support was added for QML and JavaScript, using the parser from Qt Creator, alongside a new QMake project-manager backend.

The first stable 5.x release was KDevelop 5.0.0 in August 2016. In October 2016, official Microsoft Windows builds were released for the first time.

==Features==
KDevelop uses an embedded text editor component through the KParts framework. The default editor is KDE Advanced Text Editor, which can optionally be replaced with a Qt Designer-based editor. This list focuses on the features of KDevelop itself. For features specific to the editor component, see the article on Kate.

KDevelop 4 is a completely plugin-based architecture. When a developer makes a change, they only must compile the plugin. There is a possibility to keep several profiles each of which determines which plugins to be loaded. KDevelop does not come with a text editor, but instead uses a plugin for this purpose as well. KDevelop is programming language independent and build system-independent, supporting KDE, GNOME, and many other technologies such as Qt, GTK+, and wxWidgets.

KDevelop has supported a variety of programming languages, including C, C++, Python, PHP, Java, Fortran, Ruby, Ada, Pascal, SQL, and Bash scripting. Supported build systems include GNU (automake), cmake, qmake, and make for custom projects (KDevelop does not destroy user Makefiles if they are used) and scripting projects which don&#x27;t need one.

&quot;Code completion&quot; is available for C and C++. Symbols are kept in a Berkeley DB file for quick lookups without re-parsing. KDevelop also offers a developer framework which helps to write new parsers for other programming languages.

An integrated debugger allows graphically doing all debugging with breakpoints and backtraces. It even works with dynamically loaded plugins unlike command line GDB.

&quot;Quick Open&quot; allows quick navigation between files.

Currently, around 50 to 100 plugins exist for this IDE. Major ones include persistent project-wide code bookmarks, &quot;Code abbreviations&quot; which allow expanding text quickly, a &quot;Source formatter&quot; which reformats code to a &quot;style guide&quot; before saving, &quot;Regular expressions search&quot;, and project-wide &quot;search/replace&quot; which helps in refactoring code.

<text>François Auguste Marie Mignet (, 8 May 1796 – 24 March 1884) was a French journalist and historian of the French Revolution.

==Biography==
He was born in Aix-en-Provence (Bouches-du-Rhône), France. His father was a locksmith from the Vendée, who enthusiastically accepted the principles of the French Revolution and encouraged liberal ideas in his son. François had brilliant success at Avignon in the lycée where he became a teacher in 1815. He returned to Aix to study law, and in 1818 was called to the bar, where his eloquence would have ensured his success had he not been more interested in the study of history. His abilities were shown in an &quot;Éloge de Charles VII&quot;, which was honoured by the Académie de Nîmes in 1820, and a memoire on &quot;Les Institutions de Saint Louis&quot;, which in 1821 was honoured by the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles Lettres.
He then went to Paris, where he was soon joined by his friend and compatriot Adolphe Thiers, the future president of the French Republic. He was introduced by Jacques-Antoine Manuel, formerly a member of the Convention, to the Liberal paper, &quot;Le Courrier français&quot;, where he became a member of the staff which carried on a fierce pen-and-ink warfare against the Restoration. He acquired his knowledge of the men and intrigues of the Napoleonic epoch from Talleyrand.

Mignet&#x27;s &quot;Histoire de la révolution française&quot; (1824), in support of the Liberal cause, was an enlarged sketch, prepared in four months, in which more stress was laid on fundamental theories than on the facts. In 1830, he founded &quot;Le National&quot; with Thiers and Armand Carrel, and signed the journalists&#x27; protest against the July Ordinances, however, he refused to profit from his party&#x27;s victory. He was satisfied with the modest position of Director of the Archives at the Foreign Office, where he stayed till the revolution of 1848, when he was dismissed, and retired permanently into private life. He had been elected a member of the &quot;Académie des sciences morales et politiques&quot;, which was re-established in 1832, and, in 1837, was made the permanent secretary. He was elected a member of the &quot;Académie française&quot; in 1836, and sought no further honours.

Mignet was well known in fashionable circles where his witty conversation and pleasant manners made him a favourite. Most of his time was devoted to study and to his academic duties. Eulogies on his deceased fellow-members, the Academy reports on its work, and on the prizes awarded by it, which it was part of Mignet&#x27;s duty as secretary to draw up, were thoroughly appreciated by connoisseurs, and were collected in Mignet&#x27;s &quot;Notices et portraits&quot;.

He worked slowly and lingered over research. With the exception of his description of the French Revolution, which was chiefly a political manifesto, all his early works refer to the Middle Ages. He and historian Francois Guizot invented the concept of the bourgeois revolution. These include, &quot;De la féodalité, des institutions de Saint Louis et de l&#x27;influence de la législation de ce prince&quot; (1822); &quot;La Germanie au VIIIe et au IXe siècle, sa conversion au Christianisme, et son introduction dans la société civilisée de l&#x27;Europe occidentale&quot; (1834); &quot;Essai sur la formation territoriale et politique de la France depuis la fin du XIe siècle jusqu&#x27;à la fin du XVe&quot; (1836); all of which are rough sketches that mainly outline the subjects.

Mignet&#x27;s most famous works are devoted to modern history. For many years, he immersed himself into history of the Reformation, but only one part of his writings, dealing with the Reformation at Geneva, was published. His &quot;Histoire de Marie Stuart&quot; (2 vols., 1851) made use of previously unpublished documents from the archives of Simancas. He devoted several volumes to a history of Spain, which had a well-deserved success, including, &quot;Charles Quint, son abdication, son séjour et sa mort au monastère de Yuste&quot; (1845); &quot;Antonio Perez et Philippe II.&quot; (1845); and &quot;Histoire de la rivalité de François Ier et de Charles Quint&quot; (1875).

At the same time, he was commissioned to publish the diplomatic acts relating to the War of the Spanish Succession for the &quot;Collection des documents inédits&quot;. Only four volumes of these &quot;Négotiations&quot; were published (1835–1842), and they do not go further than the Peace of Nijmegen; however, the introduction is celebrated, and Mignet reprinted it in his &quot;Mélanges historiques&quot;.

Mignet was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1876. He died in Paris in 1884 at age 87. A eulogy was delivered by Victor Duruy on entering the Académie Française on 18 June 1885.

<doc id="199987" wikidata="Q1026417" url="?curid=199987" title="Caldecott Medal">
<text>The Randolph Caldecott Medal, frequently shortened to just the Caldecott, annually recognizes the preceding year&#x27;s &quot;most distinguished American picture book for children&quot;. It is awarded to the illustrator by the Association for Library Service to Children (ALSC), a division of the American Library Association (ALA). The Caldecott and Newbery Medals are considered the most prestigious American children&#x27;s book awards. Besides the Caldecott Medal, the committee awards a variable number of citations to runners-up they deem worthy, called the Caldecott Honor or Caldecott Honor Books.

The Caldecott Medal was first proposed by Frederic G. Melcher in 1937. The award was named after English illustrator Randolph Caldecott. Unchanged since its founding, the medal, which is given to every winner, features two of Caldecott&#x27;s illustrations. The awarding process has changed several times over the years, including the use of the term &quot;Honor&quot; for the runner-ups beginning in 1971. There have been between one and five honor books named each year.

To be eligible for a Caldecott, the book must be published in English, in the United States first, and be drawn by an American illustrator. An award committee decides on a winner in January or February, voting using a multi-round point system. The committee judges books on several criteria to meet the Caldecott&#x27;s goal of recognizing &quot;distinguished illustrations in a picture book and for excellence of pictorial presentation for children.&quot;

Winning the award can lead to a substantial rise in books sold. It can also increase the prominence of illustrators. Illustrator and author Marcia Brown is the most recognized Caldecott illustrator, having won three medals and having six honor books. In recent years, there has been an increase in the number of minority characters and illustrators recognized. However, this is something which has fluctuated over the history of the award.

== History ==
The Caldecott was suggested in 1937 by Frederic G. Melcher, former editor of &quot;Publishers Weekly,&quot; following the establishment of the Newbery Medal in 1921. The American Library Association adopted Melcher&#x27;s suggestion of awarding a medal to the illustrator &quot;who had created the most distinguished picture book of the year.&quot; According to children&#x27;s literature expert Leonard S. Marcus, the award helped draw American artists into the field of children&#x27;s books.

The award has been tweaked over the years, with the most recent changes in 2009. When the award was founded, books could be considered either for the Newbery or the Caldecott, with the same committee judging both awards. The committee noted other books of merit, which were frequently referred to as runner-ups. In 1971, these books were formally named Caldecott Honor books, with this name applied retroactively. In 1977, books became eligible for both awards and, beginning with the 1980 award, separate committees for each award were formed. Until 1958, a previous winner could win again only by unanimous vote of the committee, and it was only in 1963 when joint winners were first permitted.

=== Medal ===
The award is named for Randolph Caldecott, a nineteenth-century English illustrator. Rene Paul Chambellan designed the Medal in 1937. The obverse scene is derived from Randolph Caldecott&#x27;s front cover illustration for &quot;The Diverting History of John Gilpin&quot; (Routledge, 1878, an edition of the 1782 poem by William Cowper), which depicts John Gilpin astride a runaway horse. The reverse is based on &quot;Four and twenty blackbirds baked in a pie&quot;, one of Caldecott&#x27;s illustrations for the nursery rhyme &quot;Sing a Song of Sixpence&quot;. 

Each illustrator receives a bronze copy of the medal, which, despite being awarded by the Association for Library Service to Children (ALSC), lists Children&#x27;s Librarian&#x27;s Section, the original awarding group, for historical reasons.

==Eligibility and criteria==

A picture book, according to the award criteria, provides &quot;a visual experience. A picture book has a collective unity of storyline, theme, or concept, developed through the series of pictures&quot; that constitute the book. The Medal is &quot;for distinguished illustrations in a picture book and for excellence of pictorial presentation for children&quot;. Specifically, the illustrations are judged on their artistic technique, interpretation of the book&#x27;s story and theme, the fit between the illustrations and the story and themes, the precision of depiction of elements of the book, like characters and mood, and how well the illustrations serve their targeted audience. Honor books need to fulfill the same criteria. The book must be self-contained, independent of other media for its enjoyment. Components other than illustration, including the book&#x27;s text or overall design, may be considered as they affect the overall effectiveness of the book&#x27;s illustrations.

To be eligible for the Caldecott, the artist must be a US citizen or resident, the book must have been published in English, in the United States first, or simultaneously in other countries. Picture books for any audience up to the age of 14 may be considered. In December 2019, children&#x27;s literature expert Leonard S. Marcus suggested that the Caldecott had achieved its mission in the US and the award should be expanded so children&#x27;s book illustrations from anywhere in the world be considered.

==Selection process==
The committee that decides on the Caldecott Award winner comprises fifteen members of ALSC. Seven members are elected by the entire ALSC membership and eight, including the chairperson, are appointed by the ALSC President. Members are chosen based on their experience. Consideration is also done to ensure a diversity of libraries (e.g. public and school, small and large), and geographical areas are represented as well. Publishers send copies of books to the committee; in 2009, each member received more than 700. However, a book does not need to be sent to the committee to be considered. Instead, to help identify possible contenders, committee members formally nominate seven books in three rounds over the year, and less formally recommend others.

At ALSC&#x27;s annual midwinter meeting, held in late January or early February, the committee will discuss the nominations and hold a vote on the winner. When voting, committee members list their first place, second place, and third place selections. Each vote is assigned a point value, with first place votes receiving four points, second place three points, and third place two points. The winner must receive at least eight first place votes and be at least eight points ahead of the second-place finisher. After a winner is selected, the committee can decide whether to award any honor books. They may be chosen from runner-ups to the winner, or be selected in a separate ballot. The winner and honor books are kept secret until they are publicly announced, with the committee calling the winning illustrators the morning of the announcement.

In 2015, K. T. Horning of the University of Wisconsin–Madison&#x27;s Cooperative Children&#x27;s Book Center proposed to ALSC that old discussions of the Newbery and Caldecott be made public in the service of researchers and historians. This proposal was met with both support and criticism by former committee members and recognized authors. , no change has been made.

== Impact and analysis ==
The Caldecott and Newbery awards have historically been considered the most important children&#x27;s book awards. Anita Silvey, children&#x27;s book author, editor, and critic, suggests they might even be the most important book awards, saying that &quot;no other award has the economic significance of the Newbery and Caldecott&quot;. According to Silvey, a Caldecott winner can have sales increased from 2,000 to 100,000–200,000. Silvey also credits the Caldecott for helping to establish Bradbury Press and Roaring Brook Press as important publishers. It can also be an important recognition for authors. According to Leonard Marcus, &quot;Where the Wild Things Are&quot;″s recognition brought its author and illustrator, Maurice Sendak, to national prominence.

A 1999 study on the reading levels of Caldecott recipients suggested that most winners were written at the elementary age level, with the average reading level having decreased over time. A 2007 study of Caldecott recipients found that the prevalence and importance of female characters had risen and fallen several times over the history of the Caldecott. It also found that, unlike recipients of the Pura Belpré Award and Coretta Scott King Award, the behaviors of male and female characters remained distinct and adhered to traditional gender norms. A different 2007 study, by one of the same authors, also found an increase in the number of minority characters following a 1965 critique by Nancy Larrick, however the number of minorities had fallen by the 2000s. In recent years, there has been an increase in the number of minority characters and illustrators recognized. &quot;The Horn Book Magazine&quot; editor Martha Parravano has noted how rarely non-fiction books, especially non-fiction books about science, are recognized by the Caldecott.

==Recipients==
In 1938, Dorothy P. Lathrop’s illustrations for Animals of the Bible won her the inaugural Caldecott Medal, awarded for the year’s “most distinguished American picture book for children.”

<text>Tikrit ( ) is a city in Iraq, located northwest of Baghdad and southeast of Mosul on the Tigris River. It is the administrative center of the Saladin Governorate. , it had a population of approximately 160,000.

Originally a fort during the Assyrian empire, Tikrit became the birthplace of Muslim military leader Saladin. Saddam Hussein&#x27;s birthplace was in a modest village (13 km) south of Tikrit, which is called &quot;Al-Awja&quot;; for that, Saddam bore the surname &quot;al-Tikriti&quot;. The inhabitants of this village were farmers. A few significant people from Saladin Governorate, including some from Tikrit, were appointed to government roles during the time of Ba&#x27;athist Iraq until the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003. After the invasion, the city has been a site of conflict with the Islamic State, culminating in the Second Battle of Tikrit from March to April 2015, which resulted in the displacement of 28,000 civilians. The Iraqi government regained control of the city from the Islamic State on March 31, 2015, with the city at peace since then.

==History==
===Bronze Age to Hellenistic period===
As a fort along the Tigris (Akkadian: &quot;Idiqlat&quot;), the city is first mentioned in the &quot;Fall of Assyria Chronicle&quot; as being a refuge for the Babylonian king Nabopolassar after his failed assault on the city of Assur in 615 BC.

Tikrit is usually identified as the Hellenistic settlement Birtha.

===Christian presence===
Until the 6th century, Christianity within the Sasanian Empire was predominantly dyophysite under the Church of the East, however, as a result of Miaphysite missionary work, Tikrit became a major Miaphysite (Orthodox Christian) center under its first bishop, Ahudemmeh, in 559. Under Marutha of Tikrit, the bishopric was elevated into a maphrianate and the city&#x27;s ecclesiastical jurisdiction extended as far as Central Asia.

The city remained predominantly Syriac Orthodox Christian in the early centuries of Islamic rule and gained fame as an important center of Syriac and Christian Arab literature. Some famous Christians from the city include its bishop Quriaqos of Tagrit who ascended to become the patriarch of the Syriac Orthodox Church, theologians Abu Zakariya Denha and Abu Raita, and translator Yahya ibn Adi.

From the ninth century Christians of Tikrit began to migrate northwards due to restrictive measures taken by some Muslim governors. Many settled in Mosul and villages in the Nineveh Plains, especially Bakhdida, as well as Tur Abdin. The Christian community received a setback when the governor ordered the destruction of the main cathedral known popularly as the &quot;Green Church&quot; in 1089. The maphrian and some of the Christians of Tikrit had to relocate to the Mor Mattai Monastery, where a village named Merki was established in the valley below the monastery. A later governor permitted the reconstruction of the cathedral. However, instability returned and the maphrian moved indefinitely to Mosul in 1156.

Regardless, the city remained an important center of the Syriac Orthodox Church until its destruction by Timur in the late 14th century. A Christian presence has not existed in the city since the 17th century.
===Byzantine to Ottoman periods===
The town was also home to the Arab Christian tribe of Iyad. The Arabs of the town secretly assisted the Muslims when they besieged the town. The Muslims entered Tikrit in 640; it was from then considered as part of the Jazira province. It was later regarded as belonging to Iraq by Arab geographers.

Tikrit was briefly controlled by the Nizari Ismailis. After a failed Seljuk campaign against it, the Nizaris handed it over to the local Shia Arabs there.

The Arab Uqaylid dynasty took hold of Tikrit in 1036.

Saladin was born there around 1138. The modern province of which Tikrit is the capital is named after him.

The city was devastated in 1393 by Timur. During the Ottoman period Tikrit existed as a small settlement that belonged to the Rakka Eyalet; its population never exceeded 4,000–5,000.

===World War I and after===
In September 1917, British forces captured the city during a major advance against the Ottoman Empire during World War I.

The Tikriti Jewish community was mostly gone by 1948. By the time Saddam Hussein rose to power there were only two Jewish families in the city.

The city is the birthplace of Saddam Hussein. Many senior members of the Iraqi government during his rule were drawn from Saddam&#x27;s own Tikriti tribe, the Al-Bu Nasir, as were members of his Iraqi Republican Guard, chiefly because Saddam apparently felt that he was most able to rely on relatives and allies of his family. The Tikriti domination of the Iraqi government became something of an embarrassment to Hussein and, in 1977, he abolished the use of surnames in Iraq to conceal the fact that so many of his key supporters bore the same surname, &quot;al-Tikriti&quot; (as did Saddam himself). Saddam Hussein was buried near Tikrit in his hometown of Al-Awja following his hanging on December 30, 2006.

====Iraq War of 2003 and aftermath====
In the opening weeks of the 2003 US-led invasion, many observers speculated that Saddam would return to Tikrit as his &quot;last stronghold&quot;. The city was subjected to intense aerial bombardment meant to throw Saddam&#x27;s elite Republican Guard troops out of the city. On April 13, 2003, several thousand U.S. Marines and other coalition members aboard 300 armored vehicles converged on the town, meeting little or no resistance. With the fall of Tikrit, U.S. Army Major General Stanley McChrystal said, &quot;I would anticipate that the major combat operations are over.&quot;

However, during the subsequent occupation, Tikrit became the scene of a number of resistance attacks against Coalition forces. It is commonly regarded as being the northern angle of the &quot;Sunni Triangle&quot; within which the resistance was at its most intense. In June 2003, Abid Hamid Mahmud, Saddam Hussein&#x27;s Presidential Secretary and the Ace of Diamonds on the most wanted &#x27;Deck of Cards,&#x27; was captured in a joint raid by special operations forces and the 1st Battalion, 22nd Infantry Regiment of 1st Brigade, 4th Infantry Division.

After the fall of Baghdad, Saddam Hussein was in and around Tikrit. He was hidden by relatives and supporters for about six months. During his final period in hiding, he lived in a small hole just outside the town of ad-Dawr, 15 kilometres (9 mi) south of Tikrit on the eastern bank of the Tigris, a few kilometers southeast of his hometown of Al-Awja (although the story of having been found in a hole specifically has come into question as being a piece of war-time propaganda). The missions which resulted in the capture of Saddam Hussein were assigned to the 1st Brigade Combat Teams of the 4th Infantry Division, commanded by Colonel James Hickey of the 4th Infantry Division. The U.S. Army finally captured Saddam Hussein on December 13, 2003 during Operation Red Dawn.

During the 2003 invasion of Iraq, AFN Iraq (&quot;Freedom Radio&quot;) broadcast news and entertainment within Tikrit, among other locations.

On November 22, 2005, HHC 42nd Infantry Division New York Army National Guard, handed over control of Saddam Hussein&#x27;s primary palace complex in Tikrit to the governor of Saladin Province, who represented the Iraqi government, discontinuing the existence of what once was FOB Danger. The palace complex had served as a headquarter for U.S. 4th Infantry Division, U.S. 1st Infantry Division, and 42nd Infantry Division. The palace complex now serves several purposes for the Iraqi police and army, including headquarters and jails. The U.S. military subsequently moved their operations to al Sahra Airfield, later known as Camp Speicher, northwest of Tikrit.

Saddam Hussein&#x27;s primary palace complex contained his own palace, one built for his mother and his sons and also included a man-made lake, all enclosed with a wall and towers. Plans for the palace grounds when originally returned to the Iraqi people included turning it into an exclusive and lush resort. However, within weeks of turning over the palace, it was ravaged, and its contents, (furniture, columns, even light switches), were stolen and sold on the streets of Tikrit.

The 402nd Civil Affairs Detachment of the U.S. Army, and the government of Salah ad Din province, began plans to improve local economic conditions. One of the many projects they are working on is building an industrial vocational school in the Tikrit area. The school will teach local people skills in different fields of technology, which will help to build and improve Iraq&#x27;s economic stability. The curriculum will educate men and women in multiple occupational fields such as the production of high-tech products, plastic production technology, masonry, carpentry, petroleum equipment maintenance and repair, farm machinery and automotive repair. This self-supporting educational institution owns a textile mill where many of the graduates will work producing uniforms. The mill is scheduled to begin producing and selling products within the year, with the profits from the mill going to fund the school. The vocational school&#x27;s operation, support and funding are modeled after a system South Korea used in another part of Iraq.

On April 18, 2010, Abu Ayyub al-Masri and Abu Abdullah al-Rashid al-Baghdadi were killed in a raid southwest of Tikrit in a safe house.

====ISIL insurgence (2011-15)====

The Islamic State of Iraq launched an attack on March 29, 2011 that killed 65 people and wounded over 100. Reuters news agency included the attack in its list of deadliest attacks in 2011.

On June 11, 2014, during the Northern Iraq offensive, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant took control of the city. Hours later, the Iraqi Army made an attempt to recapture the city, which resulted in heavy fighting. On June 12, ISIL executed at least 1,566 Iraqi Air Force cadets from Camp Speicher at Tikrit. At the time of the attack there were between 4,000 and 11,000 unarmed cadets in the camp. The Iraqi government blamed the massacre on both ISIL and members of the Arab Socialist Ba&#x27;ath Party – Iraq Region. By July 2014, government forces had withdrawn from Tikrit.
On September 25, 2014, Islamist militants destroyed the Assyrian Church there that dated back to 700 AD. The historic Al-Arba&#x27;een Mosque was detonated as well, damaging the cemetery surrounding it.

In March 2015, the Iraqi Army along with the &quot;Hashd Shaabi&quot; popular forces launched an operation to retake Tikrit. On March 31, the Iraqi government claimed the city had been recaptured by the Iraqi Army with the help of Shia militias.

<doc id="199990" wikidata="Q489072" url="?curid=199990" title="Public holidays in the Republic of Ireland">
<text>These are the public holidays observed in Ireland. Public holidays in Ireland (as in other countries) may commemorate a special day or other event, such as Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day or Christmas Day. On public holidays, most businesses and schools close. Other services, for example, public transport, still operate but often with reduced schedules.

==List of public holidays==
The ten public holidays in Ireland each year are:
Additionally, there are two bank holidays in Ireland each year:
==Description==
Public holidays in Ireland are often colloquially referred to as bank holidays. However, this is technically incorrect as bank holidays are not identical to public holidays, with banks additionally closed on Good Friday and 27 December.

Where a public holiday falls on a Saturday or a Sunday, or possibly coincides with another public holiday, it is generally observed (as a day off work) on the next available weekday, even though the public holiday itself does not move. Most employees are entitled to paid leave on public holidays. If an employee qualifies for public holiday benefit, they are entitled to one of the following: a paid day off on the public holiday, an additional day of annual leave, an additional day&#x27;s pay; or a paid day off within a month of the public holiday.

There is no requirement for businesses to close on public holidays, for instance many shops will open but some may operate reduced hours.

==History==
The United Kingdom Bank Holidays Act 1871 established the first Bank holidays in Ireland. The act designated four Bank holidays in Ireland:
*Easter Monday
*Whit Monday
*First Monday in August
*Saint Stephen&#x27;s Day

As Good Friday and Christmas Day were traditional days of rest and Christian worship (as were Sundays), therefore it was felt unnecessary to include them in the act as they were already recognised as common law holidays.

In 1903, Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day became an official public holiday in Ireland. This was due to the &quot;Bank Holiday (Ireland) Act 1903&quot;, an Act of Parliament introduced by the Irish MP James O&#x27;Mara.

In 1939, the Oireachtas passed the &quot;Holidays (Employees) Act 1939&quot; which designated the public holidays as:
*Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day
*Easter Monday
*Whit Monday
*First Monday in August
*Christmas Day
*Saint Stephen&#x27;s Day

The &quot;Holidays (Employees) Act 1973&quot; replaced the Whit Monday holiday with the first Monday in June. New Year&#x27;s Day was added by Statutory instrument in 1974. The October Holiday was added in 1977. The first Monday in May (commonly known as May Day) was added in 1993 and first observed in 1994.

The &quot;Organisation of Working Time Act 1997&quot;, among other things, transposed European Union directives on working times into Irish law. Schedule 2 of the Act specifies the nine public holidays to which employees in Ireland are entitled to receive time off work, time in-lieu or holiday pay depending on the terms of their employment.

In 2022 only, Friday 18 March was a public holiday, to recognise the efforts of the country during the COVID-19 pandemic.

In 2023, Saint Brigid&#x27;s Day (Imbolc) became a public holiday, to mark both the saint&#x27;s feast day and the seasonal festival. It is observed on the first Monday of February, or on 1 February if it falls on a Friday. A government statement noted that it is the first Irish public holiday named after a woman, and &quot;means that all four of the traditional Celtic seasonal festivals will now be public holidays&quot;.

===Once-off public holidays===
The power to introduce an additional public holiday is provided for in the &quot;Organisation of Working Time Act 1997&quot; and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment may introduce a new public holiday by regulation. To date, three once-off public holidays have been introduced under the Act via Statutory Instrument. These were:
==School holidays==
===Primary schools===
* In Ireland the academic year in primary schools lasts from late August to late June.
* The academic year is composed of 183 schooldays and schools are not open in July or August (though for flexibility school may open for the last two/three days of August).
* The first mid-term break is always the last week of October (also called the Halloween break).
* Most Catholic schools previously closed for the Feast of the Immaculate Conception on 8 December, however this has stopped.
* The Christmas break lasts from the last school day before 23 December to the first weekday after 6 January (17–21 days).
* The second mid-term break is a minimum of two days to a maximum of five days duration taken in the third week of February (also called the Shrove break).
* The Easter break consists of a week before Easter to the second Monday after Easter (10 school days or 16 days inclusive).
* In the last term holidays are flexible and are generally arranged around the public holidays in May and June.

===Secondary schools===
* In Ireland the academic year in secondary schools is composed of 167 school days and lasts from late August to early June.
* The first mid-term break begins on the last weekend before 31 October and lasts for one week.
* Many Catholic schools used to close for the Feast of the Immaculate Conception on 8 December but this however has stopped nationwide.
* The Christmas break lasts from the last school day before 23 December to the first weekday after 4 January (10 school days or 15–18 days inclusive).
* The second mid-term break begins on the last school day in the second week of February and lasts for one week.
* The Easter break consists of a week before Easter to the second Monday after Easter (10 school days or 16 days inclusive).
* The school year ends on the Friday before the June public holiday.
* The state examinations (the Junior and Leaving Certificate examinations) begin the Wednesday after the June Holiday.

<doc id="199991" wikidata="Q442516" url="?curid=199991" title="Germanus of Auxerre">
<text>Germanus of Auxerre (; ; ; 378 – c. 442–448 AD) was a western Roman clergyman who was bishop of Autissiodorum in Late Antique Gaul. He abandoned a career as a high-ranking government official to devote his formidable energy towards the promotion of the church and the protection of his &quot;flock&quot; in dangerous times, personally confronting, for instance, the barbarian king &quot;Goar&quot;. In Britain he is best remembered for his journey to combat Pelagianism in or around 429 AD, and the records of this visit provide valuable information on the state of post-Roman British society. He also played an important part in the establishment and promotion of the Cult of Saint Alban. The saint was said to have revealed the story of his martyrdom to Germanus in a dream or holy vision, and Germanus ordered this to be written down for public display. Germanus is venerated as a saint in both the Roman Catholic and Orthodox churches, which commemorate him on 31 July.

The principal source for the events of his life is the &quot;Vita Germani&quot;, a hagiography written by Constantius of Lyon around 480, and a brief passage added onto the end of the &quot;Passio Albani&quot;, which may possibly have been written or commissioned by Germanus. Constantius was a friend of Bishop Lupus of Troyes, who accompanied Germanus to Britain, which provided him with a link to Germanus.

==Early life==

Germanus was the son of Rusticus and Germanilla, and his family was one of the noblest in Gaul in the latter portion of the fourth century. He received the very best education provided by the distinguished schools of Arles and Lyons, and then went to Rome, where he studied eloquence and civil law. He practiced there before the tribunal of the prefect for some years with great success. His high birth and brilliant talents brought him into contact with the court, and he married Eustachia, a lady highly esteemed in imperial circles. The emperor sent him back to Gaul, appointing him one of the six dukes, entrusted with the government of the Gallic provinces. He resided at Auxerre.

At length he incurred the displeasure of the bishop, Saint Amator by hanging hunting trophies on a certain tree, which in earlier times had been the scene of pagan worship. Amator remonstrated with him in vain. One day when the duke was absent, the bishop had the tree cut down and the trophies burnt. Fearing the anger of the duke, who wished to kill him, he fled and appealed to the prefect Julius for permission to confer the tonsure on Germain. This being granted, Amator, who felt that his own life was drawing to a close, returned. When the duke came to the church, Amator caused the doors to be barred and gave him the tonsure against his will, telling him to live as one destined to be his successor, and forthwith made him a deacon.

When in a short time Amator died, Germain was unanimously chosen to fill the vacant see, being consecrated 7 July, 418. His education now served him in good stead in the government of the diocese, which he administered with great sagacity. He distributed his goods among the poor, practised great austerities, and built a large monastery dedicated to Saints Cosmas and Damian on the banks of the Yonne, whither he was wont to retire in his spare moments.

== Visit to Britain ==

Around 429, about twenty years after the Roman administration had been ejected from Britain, a Gaulish assembly of bishops chose Germanus and Lupus, Bishop of Troyes, to visit the island. It was alleged that Pelagianism was rife among the British clergy, led by a British bishop&#x27;s son named Agricola. Germanus went to combat the threat and satisfy the Pope that the British church would not break away from the Augustinian teachings of divine grace. On the way to Britain they passed through Nanterre, where Germanus noticed in the crowd which met them a young girl, whom he bade live as one espoused to Christ, and who later became St. Geneviève of Paris. Germanus and Lupus confronted the British clergy at a public meeting before a huge crowd in Britain. The Pelagians were described as being &#x27;conspicuous for riches, brilliant in dress and surrounded by a fawning multitude&#x27;. The bishops debated and, despite having no popular support, Germanus was able to defeat the Pelagians using his superior rhetorical skills.

Constantius also recounts the miraculous healing of the blind daughter of &#x27;a man with tribunician power&#x27;. This use of the word tribune may imply the existence of some form of post-Roman government system. However, in Constantius&#x27; lifetime tribune had acquired a looser definition, and often was used to indicate any military officer, whether part of the Imperial army or part of a town militia.

Germanus led the native Britons to a victory against Pictish and Saxon raiders, at a mountainous site near a river, of which Mold in North Wales is the traditional location. The enemy approaching, the former general put himself at the head of the Christians. He led them into a vale between two high mountains, and ordered his troops shout when he gave them a sign. When the Saxon pirates came near them, he cried out thrice, Alleluia, which was followed by the whole army of Britons. The sound echoed from the hills with a noise so loud that the barbarians, judging from the shout that they were facing a mighty army, flung down their arms and ran away, leaving behind their baggage and booty.

==Germanus and the Cult of Saint Alban==
Immediately after the debate with the Pelagians, Germanus gave thanks for his victory at the grave of Saint Alban, which was likely in some sort of tomb or basilica. Some translators use the word &quot;shrine&quot;; this word, which is not the original Latin, would have suggested that the cult of Saint Alban had been established before Germanus&#x27; visit to Britain. That night, Germanus claimed that Saint Alban came to him in a dream, revealing the details of his martyrdom. Some scholars have even interpreted the relevant passage in a postscript to the &quot;Passio Albani&quot; as implying the saint&#x27;s name was unknown before it was revealed to Germanus but other scholars have disputed this. 
When Germanus awoke, he had the account written down in tituli, possibly to be engraved on the walls or illustrated placards at a church site, either in Britain, or in Auxerre. It has been suggested that this account formed the basis of the &quot;Passio Albani&quot;, the foundational text of all information about Saint Alban: while this is fundamentally unprovable the evidence is strong that the &quot;Passio&quot; originated within the circle of Germanus at Auxerre. Germanus then deposited some of the bones of continental saints in the basilica, and took a sample of the earth at the site of Alban&#x27;s martyrdom, which still bore the marks of the martyr&#x27;s blood. Some have advanced arguments for the antiquity of the cult of Saint Alban (for example Martin Biddle), while others suggest it was a rather artificial creation from the final years of Roman Britain, or soon after. Some have, in fact, concluded that Germanus, himself, was responsible for the creation as well as the promotion of the cult although this has been disputed by others.

==Later life==
Germanus may have made a second visit to Britain in the mid 430s or mid 440s, though this is contested by some scholars who suggest it may be a &#x27;doublet&#x27; or variant version of the visit that has been mistaken as describing a different visit and erroneously included as such by Constantius, according to whom Germanus was joined by Severus, Bishop of Trier and met Elafius, &quot;one of the leading men of the country&quot;. Germanus is said to have cured Elafius&#x27; enfeebled son by a miracle that served to persuade the population that Catholicism rather than Pelagianism was the true faith.

According to a legend recorded in the &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot; of circa 829 it is during this second visit, around 447, that Germanus is said to have condemned for incest and other crimes Guorthigern, identified with the &#x27;Vortigern&#x27; of Welsh tradition. Vortigern ordered his daughter to bring her child to Germanus and name the bishop as its father. The scheme having failed, Vortigern was cursed by Germanus and the council of Britons, and fled into Wales followed by Germanus and the clergy. They pursued him to a castle on the river Teifi, where they fasted and prayed for three days and three nights. Finally, fire fell from heaven consuming the castle, the guilty king, and his company. While the story appears to have no historical basis, it does indicate in what reverence Germanus was held in the Church in that part of the land.

He died in Ravenna while petitioning the Roman government for leniency for the citizens of Armorica, against whom Aëtius had dispatched the Alans on a punitive expedition. Germanus had famously confronted Goar, the king of the Alans, so Constantius&#x27;s Life relates.

Based on the scanty evidence, some scholars have argued that his death should be dated to 442 or 448, and others that it should be dated to c. 437.

==Cult==

Saint Germanus&#x27; tomb continues to be venerated in the church of the Abbey of Saint-Germain d&#x27;Auxerre, which although now part of municipal museum remains open for worship at stated times. There is a tradition of a panegyric on the Sunday nearest to or preceding his festival in July.

The cult of Saint Germanus of Auxerre spread in northern France, hence the church Saint-Germain l&#x27;Auxerrois facing the Louvre in Paris. His cult is clearly distinguished from that of the homonymous Saint Germanus of Paris. He is associated with the church at Charonne in the east of Paris and the cult of Saint Genevieve (Genoveva) in Nanterre to the west of the city, both situated on the late Roman road network. His journey to Britain is commemorated in his dedications at Siouville and at Saint-Germain-les-Vaux in the Cotentin (Manche).

In the 2004 edition of the Roman Martyrology, Germanus is listed under July 31. He is described as &#x27;passing at Ravenna, a bishop who defended Britain against the Pelagian heresy and travelled to make peace for Armorica&#x27;.

===In Great Britain===
The former priory church at St Germans in Cornwall bears his name and was in late Saxon times the seat of a bishop. A few other churches in England are dedicated to the saint, including St Germain&#x27;s Church, Edgbaston, in Birmingham, St Germanus&#x27; Church, Faulkbourne, in Essex and St Germanus&#x27; Church, Rame, in Cornwall, as well as the church at Germansweek in Devon. The name of the civil parish of Wiggenhall St Germans in Norfolk reflects a church dedication.

In Wales, Germanus is remembered as an early influence on the Celtic Church. In the current Roman Catholic liturgical calendar for Wales, he is commemorated on August 3, July 31 being designated for Ignatius of Loyola. In Adamsdown, Cardiff, St German&#x27;s Church is a Church in Wales (Anglican) parish church by Bodley, opened in 1884.

Germanus is traditionally credited with the establishment of the Diocese of Sodor and Man on the Isle of Man, though this may have been a different man of a similar name. In the medieval tradition Germanus was frequently conflated with the Welsh Saint Garmon, who is commemorated in several North Wales placenames and church dedications, including Capel Garmon, Llanarmon, Llanarmon Dyffryn Ceiriog, Llanarmon Mynydd Mawr, Llanarmon-yn-Iâl, Llanfechain and Castle Caereinion. However, Sabine Baring-Gould  and Fisher argued that Saint Garmon is a different Saint Germanus, who was born in Armorica (northern France) , visited Saint Patrick in Ireland in about 440, visited Britain in about 462, then returned to Ireland and was appointed Bishop of Man in 466, and died on the Isle of Man .

==Fictional portrayals of Germanus==
* Hilaire Belloc refers to Germanus in his humorous poem, &quot;The Pelagian Drinking Song&quot; from &quot;The four men / a farrago&quot; (1912):
* Germanus&#x27;s visit to Britain is the subject of the Welsh language radio play &quot;Buchedd Garmon&quot; (1936) by Saunders Lewis.
* Germanus appears many times in Jack Whyte series of novels &#x27;A Dream of Eagles&#x27; (1992–2005) and the series &quot;The Golden Eagle&quot; (2005) .
* Germanus appears in the TV movie &quot;St. Patrick: The Irish Legend&quot; (2000) where he helps Patrick achieve his mission to convert the Irish.
* In Valerio Massimo Manfredi&#x27;s 2002 novel &quot;The Last Legion&quot; and in the 2007 film based on the novel, Germanus dies in Britain after his arrival on the island to lead the Romans and Britons against the barbarian Picts. In the film, before he dies the Bishop recites his last words as a prophecy and founds the last legion of Britain, entrusting them with their standard: a silver dragon with a purple tail.
* Germanus appears in the 2004 film &quot;King Arthur&quot;, although his second and final mission to Britain took place twenty years before the year in which the movie is set. He is portrayed by Italian actor Ivano Marescotti.

<doc id="199992" wikidata="Q937715" url="?curid=199992" title="Philippe de Mézières">
<text>Philippe de Mézières (c. 1327 – May 29, 1405), a French soldier and author, was born at the chateau of Mézières in Picardy.

==Period of soldiering (1344–1358)==
Philippe belonged to the poorer nobility. At first, he served under Luchino Visconti in Lombardy but within a year he entered the service of the husband of Joanna I of Naples, Andrew, Duke of Calabria, who was the son of the King Charles I of Hungary. Andrew was assassinated very soon in September 1345. In the autumn of that year, Philippe set out for the East in the French army. After the Battle of Smyrna in 1346 he was made a knight, and when the French army was disbanded, he made his way to Jerusalem. He realized the advantage which the discipline of the Saracens gave them over the disorderly armies of the West, and conceived the idea of a new order of knighthood, but his efforts proved fruitless. The first sketch of the order was drawn up by him in his &quot;Nova religio passionis&quot; (1367–1368; revised and enlarged in 1386 and 1396). From Jerusalem he found his way in 1347 to Cyprus to the court of Hugh IV, where he found a kindred enthusiast in the king&#x27;s son, Peter of Lusignan, then count of Tripoli; but he soon left Cyprus, and had resumed his career as a soldier of fortune when the accession of Peter to the throne of Cyprus (Nov. 1358) and his recognition as king of Jerusalem induced Philippe to return to the island, probably in 1360, when he became chancellor.

==Cypriot period (1360–1372)==
Philippe came under the influence of the pious legate Peter Thomas (d. 1366), whose friend and biographer he was to be, and Thomas, who became Latin patriarch of Constantinople in 1364, was one of the chief promoters of the crusade of 1365. In 1362 Peter of Cyprus, with the legate and Philippe visited the princes of western Europe in quest of support for a new crusade, and when the king returned to the east he left Philippe and Peter Thomas to represent his case at Avignon and in the cities of northern Italy. They preached the crusade throughout Germany, and later Philippe accompanied Peter to Alexandria. After the capture of this city he received the government of a third part of it and a promise for the creation of his order, but the Crusaders, satisfied by the immense booty, refused to continue the campaign.

In June 1366 Philippe was sent to Venice, to Avignon and to the kingdoms of western Europe, to obtain help against the Saracens, who now threatened the kingdom of Cyprus. His efforts were in vain; even Pope Urban V advised peace with the sultan. Philippe remained for some time at Avignon, seeking recruits for his order, and writing his &quot;Vita S. Petri Thomasii&quot; (Antwerp, 1659), which is invaluable for the history of the Alexandrian expedition. The &quot;Prefacio&quot; and &quot;Epistola&quot;, which form the first draft of his work on the projected order of the Passion, were written at this time.

Philippe returned to Cyprus in 1368, but was still at Venice when Peter was assassinated at Nicosia at the beginning of 1369, and he remained there until 1372, when he went to the court of the new pope Gregory XI at Avignon. He occupied himself with trying to establish in the west of Europe the feast of the Presentation of the Virgin, the office of which originated in the Greek church and had later been adopted by the Latin church in Cyprus (Coleman, pp. 3–4, 43). In 1373 he was in Paris, and he was thenceforward, together with intellectuals like Nicole Oresme, one of the trusted counselors of Charles V, although this king had refused to be dragged into a crusade. He was tutor to his son, the future Charles VI, but after the death of Charles V he was compelled, with the other counselors of the late king, to go into retirement.

==Parisian period (1373–1405)==
Philippe lived thenceforward in the convent of the Celestines in Paris, but nevertheless continued to exert an influence on public affairs, and to his close alliance with Louis of Orleans may be put down the calumnies with which the Burgundian historians covered his name. When Charles VI freed himself from the domination of his uncles, Philippe&#x27;s power increased. Philippe supported the Avignon claimant to the papacy, Clement VII at the outbreak of the Great Schism.

To this period of Philippe&#x27;s life belong most of his writings. Two devotional treatises, the &quot;Contemplatio horae mortis&quot; and the &quot;Soliloquuum peccatoris&quot;, belong to 1386–1387. In 1389 he wrote his &quot;Songe du Vieil Pèlerin&quot;, an elaborate allegorical voyage in which he described the customs of Europe and the near East, and advocated peace with England and the pursuit of the Crusade. His &quot;Oratio tragedica&quot;, largely autobiographical, was written with similar aims. In 1395 he addressed to Richard II of England an &quot;Epistre&quot; pressing his marriage with Isabella of Valois and encouraging him to make peace with France and going into a new Crusade against the Turkish armies that were breaking into Europe. The effort to enlist Richard in the crusade failed. Only the forces of France, led by John the Fearless, assisted the armies of the King Sigismund of Hungary, who was coordinating the fight. However, not listening the plans of the King, the French forces marched to defeat in the Battle of Nicopolis; and the whole campaign ended in a disaster. This defeat inspired Philippe with no enthusiasm, and justified his fears and was the occasion of his last work, the &quot;Epistre lamentable el consolatoire&quot;, in which he put forward once more the principles of his order as a remedy against future disasters.

Some of Philippe&#x27;s letters were printed in the &quot;Revue historique&quot; (vol. xlix.); the two épistres just mentioned in Kervyn de Lettenhove&#x27;s edition of Froissart&#x27;s &quot;Chroniques&quot; (vols. xv. and xvi.). The &quot;Songe du vergier&quot; or &quot;Somnium viridarii&quot;, written about 1376, is sometimes attributed to him, but without definite proofs.

<doc id="199993" wikidata="Q208299" url="?curid=199993" title="Arabian Desert">
<text>The Arabian Desert () is a vast desert wilderness in West Asia that occupies almost the entire Arabian Peninsula with an area of . It stretches from Yemen to the Persian Gulf and Oman to Jordan and Iraq. It is the fourth largest desert in the world and the largest in Asia. At its center is &quot;Ar-Rub&#x27; al-Khali&quot; (The Empty Quarter), one of the largest continuous bodies of sand in the world. It is an extension of the Sahara Desert.

Gazelles, oryx, sand cats, and spiny-tailed lizards are just some of the desert-adapted species that survive in this extreme environment, which features everything from red dunes to deadly quicksand. The climate is mostly dry (the major part receives around of rain per year, but some very rare places receive as little as 50 mm), and temperatures oscillate between very high heat and seasonal night time freezes. It is part of the deserts and xeric shrublands biome and lie in biogeographical realms of the Palearctic (northern part) and Afrotropical (southern part).

The Arabian Desert ecoregion has little biodiversity, although a few endemic plants grow here. Many species, such as the striped hyena, jackal and honey badger, have died out as a result of hunting, habitat destruction, overgrazing by livestock, off-road driving, and human encroachment on their habitat. Other species, such as the Arabian sand gazelle, have been successfully re-introduced and are protected at reserves.

==Geography==

The desert lies mostly in Saudi Arabia and covers most of the country. It extends into neighboring southern Iraq, southern Jordan, central Qatar, most of the Abu Dhabi emirate in the United Arab Emirates, western Oman, and northeastern Yemen. The ecoregion also includes most of the Sinai Peninsula in Egypt and the adjacent Negev desert in southern Israel.

The Rub&#x27; al-Khali desert is a sedimentary basin stretching along a south-west to north-east axis across the Arabian Shelf. At an altitude of , rock landscapes yield to the Rub&#x27; al-Khali, a vast stretch of sand whose extreme southern point crosses the center of Yemen. The sand overlies gravel or gypsum plains and the dunes reach maximum heights of up to . The sands are predominantly silicates, composed of 80 to 90% quartz and the remainder feldspar, whose iron oxide-coated grains color the sands orange, purple, and red.

A corridor of sandy terrain known as the Ad-Dahna desert connects the An-Nafud desert (65,000 km2 or 40,389 square miles) in the north of Saudi Arabia to the Rub&#x27; al-Khali in the south-east. The Tuwaiq escarpment is an arc that includes limestone cliffs, plateaus, and canyons. There are brackish salt flats, including the quicksands of Umm al Samim. The Wahiba Sands of Oman are an isolated sand sea bordering the east coast.

==Climate==
The Arabian Desert has a subtropical, hot desert climate, similar to the climate of the Sahara Desert (the world&#x27;s largest hot desert). The Arabian Desert is actually an extension of the Sahara Desert over the Arabian peninsula. 

The climate is mainly dry. Most areas get around of rain per year. Unlike the Sahara Desert—more than half of which is (having rainfall of less than per year)—the Arabian Desert has only a few hyperarid areas. These rare driest areas may get only 30 to of rain per year. 

The Arabian Desert’s sunshine duration index is very high by global standards: between 2,900 hours (66.2% of daylight hours) and 3,600 hours (82.1% of daylight hours), but typically around 3,400 hours (77.6% of daylight hours). Thus clear-sky conditions with plenty of sunshine prevail over the region throughout the year, and cloudy periods are infrequent. Visibility at ground level is relatively low, despite the brightness of the sun and moon, because of dust and humidity. 

Temperatures remain high year round. In the summer, in low-lying areas, average high temperatures are generally over . In extremely low-lying areas, especially along the Persian Gulf (near sea level), summer temperatures can reach . Average low temperatures in summer are typically over and in the south can sometimes exceed . Record high temperatures above have been reached in many areas of the desert, partly because its overall elevation is relatively low. 

==Flora and fauna==
The Arabian Desert ecoregion has about 900 species of plants. The Rub&#x27;al-Khali has very limited floristic diversity. There are only 37 plant species, 20 recorded in the main body of the sands and 17 around the outer margins. Of these 37 species, one or two are endemic. Vegetation is very diffuse but fairly evenly distributed, with some interruptions of near sterile dunes. Some typical plants are &quot;Calligonum crinitum&quot; on dune slopes, &quot;Cornulaca arabica&quot; (saltbush), &quot;Salsola stocksii&quot; (saltbush), and &quot;Cyperus conglomeratus&quot;. Other widespread species are &quot;Dipterygium glaucum, Limeum arabicum&quot;, and &quot;Zygophyllum mandavillei&quot;.
Very few trees are found except at the outer margin (typically &quot;Acacia ehrenbergiana&quot; and &quot;Prosopis cineraria&quot;). Other species are a woody perennial &quot;Calligonum comosum&quot;, and annual herbs such as &quot;Danthonia forskallii&quot;.

There are 102 native species of mammals. Native mammals include the Arabian oryx (&quot;Oryx leucoryx&quot;), sand gazelle (&quot;Gazella marica&quot;), mountain gazelle (&quot;G. gazella&quot;), Nubian ibex (&quot;Capra nubiana&quot;), Arabian wolf (&quot;Canis lupus arabs&quot;), striped hyaena (&quot;Hyaena hyaena&quot;), caracal (&quot;Caracal caracal&quot;), sand cat (&quot;Felis margarita&quot;), red fox (&quot;Vulpes vulpes&quot;), and Cape hare (&quot;Lepus capensis&quot;). The Asiatic cheetah and Asiatic lion used to live in the Arabian Desert. The ecoregion is home to 310 bird species.

== People ==
The area is home to several different cultures, languages, and peoples, with Islam as the predominant faith. The major ethnic group in the region is the Arabs, whose primary language is Arabic.

In the center of the desert lies Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia, with more than 7 million inhabitants. Other large cities, such as Dubai, Abu Dhabi, or Kuwait City, lie on the coast of the Persian Gulf.

== Natural resources ==
Natural resources available in the Arabian Desert include oil, natural gas, phosphates, and sulfur.

== Conservation and threats ==
Threats to the ecoregion include overgrazing by livestock and feral camels and goats, wildlife poaching, and damage to vegetation by off-road driving.

The conservation status of the desert is critical/endangered. In the UAE, the sand gazelle and Arabian oryx are threatened, and honey badgers, jackals, and striped hyaenas already extirpated.

===Protected areas===
4.37% of the ecoregion is in protected areas.

Saudi Arabia has established a system of reserves overseen by the National Commission for Wildlife Conservation and Development (NCWCD).
* Harrat al-Harrah Reserve (12,150 km2), established in 1987, is on the border with Jordan and Iraq, and protects a portion of the stony basaltic Harrat al-Sham desert. The reserve includes rough terrain of black basaltic boulders and extinct volcanic cones from the middle Miocene. It provides habitat to over 250 species of plants, 50 species of birds, and 22 mammal species.
* &#x27;Uruq Bani Ma&#x27;arid Reserve (12,000 km2) is on the western edge of the Rub’ al-Khali. Arabian oryx and sand gazelle were reintroduced to the reserve in 1995. 
* Ibex Reserve (200 km2) is south of Riyadh. It protects Nubian ibex and a reintroduced population of mountain gazelle.
* Al-Tabayq Special Nature Reserve is in northern Saudi Arabia, and protects a population of Nubian ibex.

Protected areas in the United Arab Emirates include Al Houbara Protected Area (2492.0 km2), Al Ghadha Protected Area (1087.51 km2), Arabian Oryx Protected Area (5974.47 km2), Ramlah Protected Area (544.44 km2), and Al Beda&#x27;a Protected Area (417.0 km2).

<doc id="199995" wikidata="Q235965" url="?curid=199995" title="Barbara Cartland">
<text>Dame Mary Barbara Hamilton Cartland, (9 July 1901 – 21 May 2000), known as the Queen of Romance, was an English writer who published both contemporary and historical romance novels, the latter set primarily during the Victorian or Edwardian period. Cartland is one of the best-selling authors worldwide of the 20th century. 

Many of her novels have been adapted into films for television including &quot;A Hazard of Hearts&quot;, &quot;A Ghost in Monte Carlo&quot; and &quot;Duel of Hearts&quot;.
Her novels have been translated from English into numerous languages, making Cartland the fifth most translated author worldwide, excluding biblical works. Her prolific output totals some 723 novels.

Although best known for her romantic novels, she also wrote non-fiction titles including biographies, plays, music, verse, drama, operettas, and several health and cook books. She also contributed advice to TV audiences and newspaper magazine articles.

She sold more than 750 million copies of her books, though other sources estimate her total sales at more than two billion. The covers of her novels featured portrait-style artwork, usually designed by Francis Marshall (19011980).

Cartland was also a businesswoman who was head of Cartland Promotions. She was a London society figure, often dressed in a pink chiffon gown, a plumed hat, blonde wig, and heavy make-up.

==Biography==
===Early life and education===
Born at 31 Augustus Road, Edgbaston, Birmingham, Cartland was the only daughter and eldest child of an officer of the British Army, Major James Bertram &quot;Bertie&quot; Falkner Cartland (1876–1918), and his wife, Mary Hamilton Scobell, known as &quot;Polly&quot; (1877–1976). Cartland had two brothers: Ronald, a Member of Parliament (MP) who served as an army major in World War II (1907–1940), and James Anthony &quot;Tony&quot; Hamilton Cartland (1912–1940). Both were killed in war conflict in Flanders.

Though she was born into upper middle-class comfort, the Cartland family&#x27;s finances rapidly deteriorated shortly after her birth. Cartland would later attribute this downturn to the suicide of her paternal grandfather, James Cartland, who, she stated, was a financier who shot himself in the wake of bankruptcy. However, according to the entry in the probate registry, James Cartland, the proprietor of the brass foundry firm James Cartland &amp; Son Ltd, left an estate of £92,000.

This was followed soon afterwards by her father&#x27;s death in Berry-au-Bac in World War I. Cartland&#x27;s mother opened a London dry goods store to make ends meet, and to raise Cartland and her two brothers, both of whom were later killed in battle in 1940.

Cartland was educated at private girls&#x27; schools: The Alice Ottley School, Malvern Girls&#x27; College, and Abbey House, an educational institution in Hampshire. She became a successful society reporter after 1922, and a writer of romantic fiction; she stated she was inspired in her early work by the novels of the Edwardian author Elinor Glyn, whom she idolised and eventually befriended.
===Marriage and relationships===
According to an obituary published in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, Cartland broke off her first engagement, to a Guards officer, when she learned about sexual intercourse. She claimed to have declined 49 marriage proposals before marrying Captain Alexander &quot;Sachie&quot; George McCorquodale, on 23 April 1927, a British Army officer from Scotland and heir to a printing fortune. They divorced in 1933, and he died from heart failure in 1964.

Their daughter, Raine McCorquodale (9 September 1929 – 21 October 2016), who Cartland later alleged was the daughter of George Sutherland-Leveson-Gower, 5th Duke of Sutherland, or Prince George, Duke of Kent, became &quot;Deb of the Year&quot; in 1947. After the McCorquodales&#x27; divorce in 1933, which involved charges and counter charges of infidelity, Cartland married her ex-husband&#x27;s cousin, Hugh McCorquodale, on 28 December 1936. Cartland and her second husband, who died in 1963, had two sons: Ian Hamilton McCorquodale (11 October 1937 – 10 February 2023), a &quot;Debretts&quot; publisher, and Glen McCorquodale (born 1939), a stockbroker.

Cartland maintained a long friendship with Lord Mountbatten of Burma, whose death in 1979 she said was the &quot;greatest sadness of my life&quot;. Mountbatten supported Cartland in her charitable works, particularly for United World Colleges, and even helped her write her book &quot;Love at the Helm&quot;, providing background naval and historical information. The Mountbatten Memorial Trust, established by Mountbatten&#x27;s great-nephew Charles, Prince of Wales, after Mountbatten was assassinated in Ireland, was the recipient of the proceeds of this book on its release in 1980.

When Cartland learned that young Diana Spencer loved reading her novels, Cartland began to send early copies. However, as an adult, Diana, her step-granddaughter, did not invite Cartland to her wedding to Prince Charles. Cartland was later openly critical of Diana&#x27;s divorce, though the rift between them was mended shortly before Diana&#x27;s fatal car crash in Paris, in 1997. According to Tina Brown&#x27;s book on Diana, Cartland once remarked, &quot;The only books Diana ever read were mine, and they weren&#x27;t awfully good for her.&quot;

==Novels==
After a year as a gossip columnist for the &quot;Daily Express&quot;, Cartland published her first novel, &quot;Jigsaw&quot; (1923), a risqué society thriller that became a bestseller. She also began writing and producing somewhat racy plays, one of which, &quot;Blood Money&quot; (1926), was banned by the Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Office. In the 1920s and 1930s, Cartland was a prominent young hostess in London society, noted for her beauty, energetic charm and daring parties. Her fashion sense also had a part, and she was one of the first clients of designer Norman Hartnell; she remained a client until he died in 1979. He made her presentation and wedding dresses; the latter was made to her own design against Hartnell&#x27;s wishes, and she admitted it was a failure.

In 1950, Cartland was accused of plagiarism by author Georgette Heyer, after a reader drew attention to the apparent borrowing of Heyer&#x27;s character names, character traits, dialogue and plot points in Cartland&#x27;s early historical romances. In particular, &quot;A Hazard of Hearts&quot; (1949) replicated characters (including names) from Heyer&#x27;s &quot;Friday&#x27;s Child&quot; (1944) and &quot;The Knave of Hearts&quot; (1950) which, Heyer alleged, &quot;the conception ... , the principal characters, and many of the incidents, derive directly from an early book of my own, entitled &quot;These Old Shades&quot;, first published in 1926. ... For minor situations and other characters she has drawn upon four of my other novels.&quot; Heyer completed a detailed analysis of the alleged plagiarisms for her solicitors, but the case never came to court.

As well as writing novels, Cartland wrote a guide to married life in the 1950s, which was banned in Ireland.

Despite their tame story lines, Cartland&#x27;s later novels were highly successful. By 1983, she rated the longest entry in &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot; (though most of that article was a list of her books), and she was named the top-selling author in the world by the &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot;. Additionally, in 1976, Cartland wrote 23 novels, earning her the &quot;Guinness World Record&quot; for the most novels written in a single year. The 1970s and 1980s were her most prolific period; she also regularly appeared on television in that era.

In 2000, her publishers estimated that since her writing career began in 1923, Cartland had produced a total of 723 titles.

In the mid-1990s, by which time she had sold over a billion books, &quot;Vogue&quot; called Cartland &quot;the true Queen of Romance&quot;.

==Contribution to aviation==
Privately, Cartland took an interest in the early gliding movement and in 1931, with two RAF officers &quot;designed the first aircraft-towed airmail delivery glider&quot;; she also arranged the first long-distance (200-mile [360 km]) tow. In 1984, she was awarded the Bishop Wright Air Industry Award for this contribution.

She regularly attended Brooklands aerodrome and motor-racing circuit during the 1920s and 30s, and the Brooklands Museum has preserved a sitting-room from that era and named it after her.

==Non-fiction books==
Cartland wrote several biographies of major figures, including &quot;Metternich: The Passionate Diplomat&quot; in 1964, &quot;The Outrageous Queen: A Biography of Christina of Sweden&quot; in 1956, &quot;The Private Life of Charles II: The Women He Loved&quot; in 1958, and &quot;Josephine, Empress of France&quot; in 1961. Her biography of Klemens von Metternich focused on his many love affairs and contained passages such as: &quot;He was a virile, experienced and satisfying lover... Even the most sophisticated women felt as if in his arms they learnt something they had never known before. Every woman rose with him to heights of emotional ecstasy beyond the power of expression.&quot;

==Political influence==
After the death of her brother Ronald Cartland during World War II, a Conservative Member of Parliament (MP), Cartland published a biography of him with a preface by the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill.

The war marked the beginning of a lifelong interest in civic welfare and politics for Cartland, who served the War Office in various charitable capacities as well as the St John Ambulance Brigade. In 1953, she was invested at Buckingham Palace as a Commander of the Order of St John of Jerusalem for her services.

In 1955, Cartland was elected a councillor on Hertfordshire County Council as a Conservative and served for nine years. During this time she campaigned successfully for nursing home reform, improvement in the salaries of midwives and the legalisation of education for the children of Romani.

==Music==
A radio operetta, &quot;The Rose and the Violet&quot;, broadcast by the BBC in 1942, was composed by Mark Lubbock with book and lyrics by Cartland. It was set against the Edwardian background of Rotten Row.

Jan Kerrison, cellist, pianist and composer (and the second wife of bassoonist Archie Camden), was a neighbour and friend of Cartland. During World War II she made patriotic settings of Cartland&#x27;s &#x27;Wings on the Sunrise&#x27; and ‘The Knights of St John&#x27; for the St John&#x27;s Ambulance Brigade.

Cartland recorded an EP vinyl in conjunction with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra in 1978, titled &quot;An Album of Love Songs&quot; released through State Records, and produced by Norman Newell. The album featured Cartland performing covers of a series of popular standards including &quot;I&#x27;ll Follow My Secret Heart&quot; and &quot;A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square&quot;.

==Honours==
In January 1988, Cartland received the Médaille de Vermeil de la Ville de Paris, the highest honour of the city of Paris, for publishing 25 million books in France.

In 1991, Cartland was invested by Queen Elizabeth II as a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in honour of the author&#x27;s almost 70 years of literary, political, and social contributions.

A waxwork of Cartland was on display at Madame Tussauds, though according to her son Ian, Cartland was displeased because it was not &quot;pretty enough&quot;.

She was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; on two occasions, in March 1958 when she was surprised by Eamonn Andrews at the BBC Television Theatre, and in December 1989, when Michael Aspel surprised her at Elstree Studios.

As of 1996, Cartland holds the record for the most entries in the wider format of the biographic reference book Who&#x27;s Who, with an allocated 223 lines, surpassing that of former British PM Winston Churchill.

The former residence of Cartland, named &quot;River Cottage&quot;, and located in Great Barford, Bedfordshire in which she resided between 1941 until 1949, will be honoured with a heritage Blue Plaque
which is also a monument honouring her literary career.
==Death and legacy==
Cartland died in her sleep on 21 May 2000, at her residence, Camfield Place, near Hatfield, Hertfordshire at the age of 98. She had been suffering from ill health and dementia for six months beforehand, and was subsequently bedridden and sequestered. Both of her sons, Ian and Glen McCorquodale, were present at her bedside when she died. Shortly afterwards, Cartland&#x27;s daughter from her first marriage, Raine, travelled to the family home.

After Cartland originally had decided she would like to be buried in her local parish church, featuring a coffin of marble construction, covered in angels, this was later changed; she was buried in a cardboard coffin, because of her concerns for environmental issues. She was interred at her private estate in Hatfield, Hertfordshire, under an oak that had been planted by Queen Elizabeth I. Cartland left a gross estate of £1,139,123, but following debts and liabilities, the net sum was nil. She had once admitted: &quot;I have no idea what I make...Occasionally I ask, &#x27;Are we in debt?&#x27; We always are.&quot;

==Posthumous publications==
Cartland left behind a series of 160 unpublished novels, known as the &quot;Barbara Cartland Pink Collection&quot;. These were published in ebook format by her son, Ian McCorquodale; each month, a new novel was published from that collection until, in 2018, all 160 novels had been published.

In 2010, to mark the 10th anniversary of her death, Cartland&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Jig-Saw&quot; (first published in 1925), was reprinted.

&quot;As a tribute to Her Majesty the Queen on her Diamond Jubilee and to Barbara&#x27;s enduring appeal to romantics everywhere, her publishers have re-released her catalogue collection, entitled – &quot;The Eternal Collection&quot;. This collection, released beginning in November 2013, includes some novels published at the time Queen Elizabeth II ascended to the throne in 1952.

In addition, her collections of ebooks are available in Spanish, Italian, German and Dutch.

==Feature films==
BBC Four aired a biopic drama film, titled &quot;In Love with Barbara&quot; (26 October 2008), starring Anne Reid as Cartland and David Warner as Lord Mountbatten. The film was written by Jacquetta May.

Her last project was to be filmed and interviewed for her life story (directed by Steven Glen for Blue Melon Films). The documentary, &quot;Virgins and Heroes&quot;, includes early home ciné footage and Dame Barbara launching her website with pink computers, in early 2000.

<text>Bettie Mae Page (April 22, 1923 – December 11, 2008) was an American model who gained notoriety in the 1950s for her pin-up photos. She was often referred to as the &quot;Queen of Pinups&quot;: her long jet-black hair, blue eyes, and trademark bangs have influenced artists for generations. After her death, &quot;Playboy&quot; founder Hugh Hefner called her &quot;a remarkable lady, an iconic figure in pop culture who influenced sexuality, taste in fashion, someone who had a tremendous impact on our society&quot;.

A native of Nashville, Tennessee, Page lived in California in her early adult years before moving to New York City to pursue work as an actress. There, she found work as a pin-up model, and she posed for several photographers throughout the 1950s. Page was &quot;Miss January 1955&quot;, one of the earliest Playmates of the Month for &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine. After years in obscurity, she experienced a resurgence of popularity in the 1980s.

In 1959, Page converted to evangelical Christianity and worked for Billy Graham, studying at Bible colleges in Los Angeles and Portland, Oregon, with the intent of becoming a missionary. The latter part of Page&#x27;s life was marked by depression, violent mood swings, and several years in a state psychiatric hospital with paranoid schizophrenia.

==Early life==
Betty Mae Page, who in childhood began spelling her first name &quot;Bettie&quot;, was born in Nashville, Tennessee, in 1923, the second of six children to Walter Roy Page (1896–1964) and Edna Mae Pirtle (1901–1986). During her early years, the Page family traveled around the country in search of economic stability. At a young age, she had to face the responsibilities of caring for her younger siblings, particularly after her father was convicted for car theft and spent two years in an Atlanta, Georgia, prison.

Page&#x27;s parents divorced when she was 10 years old. Her mother worked two jobs; one as a hairdresser (during the day) and the other washing laundry (at night). Unable to care for all her children, Edna placed Page, at 10, and her two sisters in a Protestant orphanage for a year. Their father remained in the area, at one point renting a basement room from the cash-strapped Edna. Page said he began sexually molesting her when she was 13 years old.

As a teenager, Page and her sisters tried different makeup styles and hairdos imitating their favorite film stars. She also learned to sew. These skills proved useful, years later, for her pin-up photography, when Page did her own makeup and hair and made her own bikinis and costumes.

A good student and debate team member at Hume-Fogg High School, she was voted &quot;Girl Most Likely to Succeed&quot;. On June 6, 1940, Page graduated as the salutatorian of her high school class with a scholarship. She enrolled at George Peabody College (later part of Vanderbilt University) with the intention of becoming a teacher. However, the next fall she began studying acting, hoping to become a film star. At the same time, she got her first job, typing for author Alfred Leland Crabb. Page graduated from Peabody with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1944.

Shortly before graduating from Hume-Fogg High, Page had met William E. &quot;Billy&quot; Neal, a former rival high school sports star two years older than she. In September 1942, he was drafted into the Army for World War II, and he and Page married on February 18, 1943, before he shipped out. For the next few years she moved between San Francisco, Los Angeles and Nashville. She and Neal divorced in 1947.

==Modeling career==

===Discovery and early work===
In late 1947, Page moved to New York City, where she hoped to find work as an actress. She supported herself by working a secretarial job at the American Bread Company, near Penn Station. Within days she became the victim of a sexual assault by a group of men, and retreated home to Nashville, where she briefly worked for the L &amp; N Railroad. Within weeks, she returned to New York, becoming secretary to a real-estate developer and an insurance broker who shared offices in the Eastern Airlines Building at Rockefeller Plaza.

In 1950, while walking along the Coney Island shore, Bettie met NYPD Officer Jerry Tibbs, who was an avid photographer, and he gave Bettie his card. He suggested she would be a good pin-up model. In exchange for allowing him to photograph her, he would help make up her first pin-up portfolio, free of charge. Tibbs suggested to Bettie that she style her hair with bangs in front, to keep light from reflecting off her high forehead when being photographed. Bangs soon became an integral part of her distinctive look.

In late-1940s America, &quot;camera clubs&quot; were formed to circumvent laws restricting the production of nude photos. These camera clubs existed ostensibly to promote artistic photography, but in reality, many were merely fronts for the making of pornography. Page entered the field of &quot;glamour photography&quot; as a popular camera club model, working initially with photographer Cass Carr. Her lack of inhibition in posing made her a hit, and her name and image became quickly known in the erotic photography industry. In 1951, Bettie&#x27;s image appeared in men&#x27;s magazines such as &quot;Wink&quot;, &quot;Titter&quot;, &quot;Eyeful&quot; and &quot;Beauty Parade.&quot;

===Early 1950s to 1957: Irving Klaw; film work===

From late 1951 or early 1952 through 1957, she posed for photographer Irving Klaw for mail-order photographs with pin-up and BDSM themes, making her the first famous bondage model. Klaw also used Page in several short, black-and-white 8mm and 16mm &quot;specialty&quot; films, which catered to specific requests from his clientele. These silent one-reel featurettes showed women clad in lingerie and high heels, acting out fetishistic scenarios of abduction, domination, and slave-training; bondage, spanking, and elaborate leather costumes and restraints were included periodically. Page alternated between playing a stern dominatrix, and a helpless victim bound hand and foot.

Klaw also produced a line of still photos taken during these sessions. Some have become iconic images, such as his highest-selling photo of Page—shown gagged and bound in a web of ropes, from the film &quot;Leopard Bikini Bound&quot;. Although these &quot;underground&quot; features had the same crude style and clandestine distribution as the pornographic &quot;stag&quot; films of the time, Klaw&#x27;s all-female films (and still photos) never featured any nudity or explicit sexual content. Commenting on the bondage photos and the reputation they afforded her, Page said retrospectively: They keep referring to me in the magazines and newspapers and everywhere else as the &quot;Queen of Bondage.&quot; The only bondage posing I ever did was for Irving Klaw and his sister Paula. Usually every other Saturday he had a session for four or five hours with four or five models and a couple of extra photographers, and in order to get paid you had to do an hour of bondage. And that was the only reason I did it. I never had any inkling along that line. I don&#x27;t really disapprove of it; I think you can do your own thing as long as you&#x27;re not hurting anybody else — that&#x27;s been my philosophy ever since I was a little girl. I never looked down my nose at it. In fact, we used to laugh at some of the requests that came through the mail, even from judges and lawyers and doctors and people in high positions. Even back in the &#x27;50s they went in for the whips and the ties and everything else.

In 1953, Page took acting classes at the Herbert Berghof Studio, which led to several roles on stage and television. She appeared on &quot;The United States Steel Hour&quot; and &quot;The Jackie Gleason Show&quot;. Her Off-Broadway productions included &quot;Time Is a Thief&quot; and &quot;Sunday Costs Five Pesos.&quot; Page acted and danced in the feature-length burlesque revue film &quot;Striporama&quot; directed by Jerald Intrator in which she was given a brief speaking role. She then appeared in two more burlesque films by Irving Klaw (&quot;Teaserama&quot; and &quot;Varietease&quot;). These featured exotic dance routines and vignettes by Page and well-known striptease artists Lili St. Cyr and Tempest Storm. All three films were mildly risqué, but none showed any nudity or overtly sexual content.

In 1954, during one of her annual vacations to Miami, Florida, Page met photographers Jan Caldwell, H. W. Hannau and Bunny Yeager. At that time, Page was the top pin-up model in New York. Yeager, a former model and aspiring photographer, signed Page for a photo session at the now-closed wildlife park Africa U.S.A. in Boca Raton, Florida. The &quot;Jungle Bettie&quot; photographs from this shoot are among her most celebrated. They include nude shots with a pair of cheetahs named Mojah and Mbili. Page herself made the leopard-skin-patterned jungle girl outfit she wore, along with much of her lingerie. A collection of the Yeager photos, and Klaw&#x27;s, were published in the book &quot;Bettie Page Confidential&quot; (St. Martin&#x27;s Press, 1994).

After Yeager sent shots of Page to &quot;Playboy&quot; founder Hugh Hefner, he selected one to use as the Playmate of the Month centerfold in the January 1955 issue of the two-year-old magazine. The famous photo shows Page, wearing only a Santa hat, kneeling before a Christmas tree holding an ornament and playfully winking at the camera. In 1955, Page won the title &quot;Miss Pinup Girl of the World&quot;. She also became known as &quot;The Queen of Curves&quot; and &quot;The Dark Angel&quot;. While pin-up and glamour models frequently have careers measured in months, Page was in demand for several years, continuing to model until 1957.

Although she frequently posed nude, she never appeared in scenes with explicit sexual content. In 1957, Page gave &quot;expert guidance&quot; to the FBI regarding the production of &quot;flagellation and bondage pictures&quot; in Harlem.

===1958–92: Retirement; departure from spotlight===
The reasons reported for Page&#x27;s departure from modeling vary. Some reports mention the Kefauver Hearings of the United States Senate Special Committee to Investigate Crime in Interstate Commerce as a potential reason, after a young man apparently died during a session of bondage which was rumored to be inspired by images featuring Page. After leaving modeling, Page converted to Christianity and became a born again evangelist on December 31, 1959, while living in Key West, Florida. She recalled in 1998, &quot;When I gave my life to the Lord, I began to think he disapproved of all those nude pictures of me.&quot;

Photographer Sam Menning was the last person to photograph a pin-up of Page before her retirement.

On New Year&#x27;s Eve 1958, during one of her regular visits to Key West, Page attended a service at what is now the Key West Temple Baptist Church. She found herself drawn to the multiracial environment and started to attend on a regular basis. She would, in time, attend three bible colleges, including the Bible Institute of Los Angeles, Multnomah University in Portland, Oregon and, briefly, a Christian retreat known as &quot;Bibletown&quot;, part of the Boca Raton Community Church, Boca Raton, Florida.

She dated industrial designer Richard Arbib in the 1950s, and then married Armond Walterson on November 6, 1958; they divorced on October 10, 1963.

During the 1960s, she attempted to become a Christian missionary in Africa, but was rejected for having had a divorce. Over the next few years, she worked for various Christian organizations before settling in Nashville in 1963, and re-enrolled at Peabody College to pursue a master&#x27;s degree in education, but eventually dropped out. She worked full-time for Rev. Billy Graham. She and first husband Billy Neal remarried very briefly in late 1963 or in 1964, but that marriage was soon annulled.

She returned to Florida in 1966 and married again, to Harry Lear, on February 14, 1966. but that marriage ended in divorce on January 18, 1972.

She moved to Southern California in October 1978. There she had a nervous breakdown and had an altercation with her landlady. The doctors who examined her diagnosed her with acute schizophrenia, and she spent 20 months in Patton State Hospital in San Bernardino, California. In 1982, after a fight with another landlord, she was arrested for assault, but was found not guilty by reason of insanity and placed under state supervision for eight years. She was released in 1992.

==Revival of public interest==
In the 1950s, artists Gene Bilbrew and Eric Stanton were among the first to paint Bettie images. In 1979, artist Robert Blue had a show titled &quot;Steps Into Space&quot;, at a gallery on Melrose Place in Los Angeles, where he showed his collection of Bettie Page paintings. At that time in New York, Olivia De Berardinis had begun painting Bettie for Italian jeans manufacturer Fiorucci. De Berardinis has continued to paint Bettie, and compiled a collection of this artwork in a book titled &quot;Bettie Page by Olivia&quot; (2006), with a foreword by Hugh Hefner.

In 1976, Eros Publishing Co. published &quot;A Nostalgic Look at Bettie Page&quot;, a mixture of photos from the 1950s. Between 1978 and 1980, Belier Press published four volumes of &quot;Betty Page: Private Peeks&quot;, reprinting pictures from the private-camera-club sessions, which reintroduced Page to a new but small cult following. In 1983, London Enterprises released &quot;In Praise of Bettie Page — A Nostalgic Collector&#x27;s Item&quot;, reprinting camera-club photos and an old cat fight photo shoot.

A larger cult following was built around Page during the 1980s, of which she was unaware. This renewed attention was focused on her pinup and lingerie modeling rather than those depicting sexual fetishes or bondage. This attention also prompted speculation of what happened to her after the 1950s. The 1990s edition of &quot;Book of Lists&quot; included Page in a list of once-famous celebrities who had vanished from the public eye.

In the early 1980s, comic-book artist Dave Stevens based the female love interest of his hero Cliff Secord (alias &quot;The Rocketeer&quot;) on Page.

By the mid-1980s, artist Olivia De Berardinis noted that women began to frequent her gallery openings sporting Bettie bangs, fetish clothing, and tattoos of Page. She described &quot;black bangs, seamed stockings and snub-nosed 6-inch stilettos. These are Bettie Page signatures... Although the fantasy world of fetish/bondage existed in some form since the beginning time, Bettie is the iconic figurehead of it all. No star of this genre existed before her. [Marilyn] Monroe had predecessors, Bettie did not.&quot;

In 1987, Greg Theakston started a fanzine called &quot;The Betty Pages&quot; and recounted tales of her life, particularly the camera-club days. Additionally, numerous articles about the missing pop-cultural figure began appearing in the mainstream media. Since almost all of her photos were in the public domain, some entities launched Page-related products.

In a 1993 telephone interview with &quot;Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous&quot;, Page told host Robin Leach that she had been unaware of the resurgence of her popularity, stating that she was &quot;penniless and infamous&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot; produced a segment on her. Page was living in a group home in Los Angeles. Theakston contacted her and extensively interviewed her for &quot;The Betty Page Annuals&quot; V.2.

Her brother Jack finally brought her back into public life, explaining, &quot;My son had noticed all the books and calendars and plates being sold with her face on them...I called her up and said, &#x27;Bettie, there is a chance for you to make money off this&#x27;&quot;.

In 1993, Jack persuaded Page to pursue royalties through Chicago attorney James L. Swanson, who with Karen Essex wrote the 1996 coffee table book &quot;Bettie Page: The Life of a Pin-Up Legend&quot;.

Three years later, nearly penniless and failing to receive any royalties, Page fired Swanson.

In 1993, Page signed with Mark Roesler and his Curtis Management Group, later CMG Worldwide. Page occasionally autographed pinups at her agents&#x27; offices in Los Angeles, California.

After Jim Silke made a large-format comic featuring Page&#x27;s likeness, in the 1990s Dark Horse Comics published a comic book based on her fictional adventures. Eros Comics published several Bettie Page titles, including the tongue-in-cheek &quot;Tor Love Bettie&quot; which comically suggested a romance between Page and wrestler-turned-Ed Wood film actor, Tor Johnson.

In 1996, Page granted a TV interview to entertainment reporter Tim Estiloz for the NBC morning magazine program &quot;Real Life&quot;. Another biography, &quot;The Real Bettie Page: The Truth about the Queen of Pinups&quot; (1997) was written by Richard Foster. The book stated that a Los Angeles County Sheriff&#x27;s police report said Page had paranoid schizophrenia and, at age 56, had stabbed her elderly landlords on the afternoon of April 19, 1979 in an unprovoked attack, during a fit of insanity.

In 1997, &quot;E! True Hollywood Story&quot; aired a feature on Page titled, &quot;Bettie Page: From Pinup to Sex Queen&quot;.

In a late-1990s interview, Page stated she would not allow any current pictures of her to be shown because of concerns about her weight. However, in 1997, Page changed her mind and agreed to a television interview for the aforementioned &quot;E! True Hollywood Story&quot; on the condition that the location of the interview and her face not be revealed (she was shown with her face and dress electronically blacked out). Page allowed a publicity picture to be taken of her for the August 2003 edition of &quot;Playboy&quot;. In 2006, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; ran an article headlined &quot;A Golden Age for a Pinup&quot;, covering an autographing session at CMG Worldwide. Once again, Page declined to be photographed.

In a 1998 interview, she commented of her career, &quot;I never thought it was shameful. I felt normal. It&#x27;s just that it was much better than pounding a typewriter eight hours a day, which gets monotonous.&quot;

In her last years, she hired a law firm to help her recoup some of the profits being made with her likeness. According to MTV: &quot;Katy Perry&#x27;s rocker bangs and throwback skimpy jumpers; Madonna&#x27;s &quot; Sex&quot; book and fascination with bondage gear; Rihanna&#x27;s obsession with all things leather, lace and second-skin binding; Uma Thurman in &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;; the SuicideGirls website; the Pussycat Dolls; and the entire career of Dita Von Teese&quot; would not have been possible without Page.

In 2011, Page&#x27;s estate made the &quot;Forbes&quot; annual list of top-earning dead celebrities, earning $6 million and tied with the estates of George Harrison and Andy Warhol, at 13th on the list. In 2014, Forbes estimated that Page&#x27;s estate earned $10 million in 2013.

In 2023, a historical marker commemorating Page&#x27;s life was erected in Nashville.

==Death==

According to long-time friend and business agent Mark Roesler, Page was hospitalized in critical condition on December 6, 2008. Roesler was quoted by the Associated Press as saying Page had a heart attack and by Los Angeles television station KNBC as claiming Page had pneumonia. Her family eventually agreed to discontinue life support, and she died on December 11, 2008, at age 85.

==In popular culture==

===Fashion and visual art ===
* For its Polynesian-inspired Spring-Summer 2011 ready-to-wear collection, French fashion house Christian Dior styled the hair of its models with Bettie Page as inspiration.
* In Seattle, Washington, a homeowner became the subject of a short-lived controversy when he had an artist friend paint a large mural of Page on the side of his home. The mural is visible from Interstate 5, just south of the 65th Street exit. In 2016, the mural was vandalized, leading to a restoration and the addition of drag star Divine.

===Film===
* In 2004, Cult Epics produced the direct-to-DVD biographical film &quot;Bettie Page: Dark Angel&quot;. Centering on the 1953–1957 Irving Klaw period, it recreates six lost fetish films she did for Klaw. Model Paige Richards plays the title role.
* &quot;The Notorious Bettie Page&quot; (2005) follows her life from the mid-1930s through the late 1950s. It stars Gretchen Mol as the adult Page. Bonus footage added to the DVD release includes color film from the 1950s of Page playfully undressing and striking various nude poses for the camera.
* The BD-3000 luxury droid in &quot;Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith&quot; (2005) was inspired by Bettie Page.
* In Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s 2007 film &quot;Death Proof&quot;, Rosario Dawson pays homage to Page with her iconic haircut.
* In 2012 &quot;Bettie Page Reveals All&quot; was filmed and premiered, then released nationwide the following year. It was an authorized biographical documentary by director Mark Mori.

<text>Nicolas Eugène Géruzez (6 January 1799 – 29 May 1865), was a French critic.

He was born at Reims. He was assistant professor at the Sorbonne, and in 1852 he became secretary to the faculty of literature. His works include a &quot;Histoire de l&#x27;éloquence politique et religieuse en France aux XIV&#x27;, XV&#x27; et XVI&#x27; siècles&quot; (1837-1838); an &quot;Histoire de la littérature française depuis les origines jusqu’a la Revolution&quot; (1852), which he supplemented in 1859 by a volume bringing down the history to the close of the revolutionary period; and some miscellaneous works.

Géruzez died in Paris. A posthumous volume of &quot;Mélanges et pensées&quot; appeared in 1877.

His son, Victor Eugène Géruzez (known as &quot;Crafty&quot;) was an equestrian illustrator.

<text>In astronomy, an epoch or reference epoch is a moment in time used as a reference point for some time-varying astronomical quantity. It is useful for the celestial coordinates or orbital elements of a celestial body, as they are subject to perturbations and vary with time. These time-varying astronomical quantities might include, for example, the mean longitude or mean anomaly of a body, the node of its orbit relative to a reference plane, the direction of the apogee or aphelion of its orbit, or the size of the major axis of its orbit.

The main use of astronomical quantities specified in this way is to calculate other relevant parameters of motion, in order to predict future positions and velocities. The applied tools of the disciplines of celestial mechanics or its subfield orbital mechanics (for predicting orbital paths and positions for bodies in motion under the gravitational effects of other bodies) can be used to generate an ephemeris, a table of values giving the positions and velocities of astronomical objects in the sky at a given time or times.

Astronomical quantities can be specified in any of several ways, for example, as a polynomial function of the time interval, with an epoch as a temporal point of origin (this is a common current way of using an epoch). Alternatively, the time-varying astronomical quantity can be expressed as a constant, equal to the measure that it had at the epoch, leaving its variation over time to be specified in some other way—for example, by a table, as was common during the 17th and 18th centuries.

The word &quot;epoch&quot; was often used in a different way in older astronomical literature, e.g. during the 18th century, in connection with astronomical tables. At that time, it was customary to denote as &quot;epochs&quot;, not the standard date and time of origin for time-varying astronomical quantities, but rather the values at that date and time &quot;of those time-varying quantities themselves&quot;. In accordance with that alternative historical usage, an expression such as &quot;correcting the epochs&quot; would refer to the adjustment, usually by a small amount, of the values of the tabulated astronomical quantities applicable to a fixed standard date and time of reference (and not, as might be expected from current usage, to a change from one date and time of reference to a different date and time).

==Epoch versus equinox==
Astronomical data are often specified not only in their relation to an epoch or date of reference but also in their relations to other conditions of reference, such as coordinate systems specified by &quot;equinox&quot;, or &quot;equinox and equator&quot;, or &quot;equinox and ecliptic&quot; – when these are needed for fully specifying astronomical data of the considered type.

===Date-references for coordinate systems===

When the data are dependent for their values on a particular coordinate system, the date of that coordinate system needs to be specified directly or indirectly.

Celestial coordinate systems most commonly used in astronomy are equatorial coordinates and ecliptic coordinates. These are defined relative to the (moving) vernal equinox position, which itself is determined by the orientations of the Earth&#x27;s rotation axis and orbit around the Sun. Their orientations vary (though slowly, e.g. due to precession), and there is an infinity of such coordinate systems possible. Thus the coordinate systems most used in astronomy need their own date-reference because the coordinate systems of that type are themselves in motion, e.g. by the precession of the equinoxes, nowadays often resolved into precessional components, separate precessions of the equator and of the ecliptic.

The epoch of the coordinate system need not be the same, and often in practice is not the same, as the epoch for the data themselves.

The difference between reference to an epoch alone, and a reference to a certain equinox with equator or ecliptic, is therefore that the reference to the epoch contributes to specifying the date of the values of astronomical variables themselves; while the reference to an equinox along with equator/ecliptic, of a certain date, addresses the identification of, or changes in, the coordinate system in terms of which those astronomical variables are expressed. (Sometimes the word &#x27;equinox&#x27; may be used alone, e.g. where it is obvious from the context to users of the data in which form the considered astronomical variables are expressed, in equatorial form or ecliptic form.)

The equinox with equator/ecliptic of a given date defines which coordinate system is used.
Most standard coordinates in use today refer to 2000 TT (i.e. to 12h (noon) on the Terrestrial Time scale on January 1, 2000, see below), which occurred about 64 seconds sooner than noon UT1 on the same date (see ΔT). Before about 1984, coordinate systems dated to 1950 or 1900 were commonly used.

There is a special meaning of the expression &quot;equinox (and ecliptic/equator) of date&quot;. When coordinates are expressed as polynomials in time relative to a reference frame defined in this way, that means the values obtained for the coordinates in respect of any interval t after the stated epoch, are in terms of the coordinate system of the same date as the obtained values themselves, i.e. the date of the coordinate system is equal to (epoch + t).

It can be seen that the date of the coordinate system need not be the same as the epoch of the astronomical quantities themselves. But in that case (apart from the &quot;equinox of date&quot; case described above), two dates will be associated with the data: one date is the epoch for the time-dependent expressions giving the values, and the other date is that of the coordinate system in which the values are expressed.

For example, orbital elements, especially osculating elements for minor planets, are routinely given with reference to two dates: first, relative to a recent epoch for all of the elements: but some of the data are dependent on a chosen coordinate system, and then it is usual to specify the coordinate system of a standard epoch which often is not the same as the epoch of the data. An example is as follows: For minor planet (5145) Pholus, orbital elements have been given including the following data:

 Epoch 2010 Jan. 4.0 TT . . . = JDT 2455200.5
 M 72.00071 . . . . . . . .(2000.0)
 n. 0.01076162 .. . . . Peri . 354.75938
 a 20.3181594 . . . . . Node . 119.42656
 e. 0.5715321 . . . . . Incl .. 24.66109

where the epoch is expressed in terms of Terrestrial Time, with an equivalent Julian date. Four of the elements are independent of any particular coordinate system: M is mean anomaly (deg), n: mean daily motion (deg/d), a: size of semi-major axis (AU), e: eccentricity (dimensionless). But the argument of perihelion, longitude of the ascending node and the inclination are all coordinate-dependent, and are specified relative to the reference frame of the equinox and ecliptic of another date &quot;2000.0&quot;, otherwise known as J2000, i.e. January 1.5, 2000 (12h on January 1) or JD 2451545.0.

===Epochs and periods of validity===

In the particular set of coordinates exampled above, much of the elements has been omitted as unknown or undetermined; for example, the element n allows an approximate time-dependence of the element M to be calculated, but the other elements and n itself are treated as constant, which represents a temporary approximation (see Osculating elements).

Thus a particular coordinate system (equinox and equator/ecliptic of a particular date, such as J2000.0) could be used forever, but a set of osculating elements for a particular epoch may only be (approximately) valid for a rather limited time, because osculating elements such as those exampled above do not show the effect of future perturbations which will change the values of the elements.

Nevertheless, the period of validity is a different matter in principle and not the result of the use of an epoch to express the data. In other cases, e.g. the case of a complete analytical theory of the motion of some astronomical body, all of the elements will usually be given in the form of polynomials in interval of time from the epoch, and they will also be accompanied by trigonometrical terms of periodical perturbations specified appropriately. In that case, their period of validity may stretch over several centuries or even millennia on either side of the stated epoch.

Some data and some epochs have a long period of use for other reasons. For example, the boundaries of the IAU constellations are specified relative to an equinox from near the beginning of the year 1875. This is a matter of convention, but the convention is defined in terms of the equator and ecliptic as they were in 1875. To find out in which constellation a particular comet stands today, the current position of that comet must be expressed in the coordinate system of 1875 (equinox/equator of 1875). Thus that coordinate system can still be used today, even though most comet predictions made originally for 1875 (epoch = 1875) would no longer be useful today, because of the lack of information about their time-dependence and perturbations.

==Changing the standard equinox and epoch==

To calculate the visibility of a celestial object for an observer at a specific time and place on the Earth, the coordinates of the object are needed relative to a coordinate system of the current date. If coordinates relative to some other date are used, then that will cause errors in the results. The magnitude of those errors increases with the time difference between the date and time of observation and the date of the coordinate system used, because of the precession of the equinoxes. If the time difference is small, then fairly easy and small corrections for the precession may well suffice. If the time difference gets large, then fuller and more accurate corrections must be applied. For this reason, a star position read from a star atlas or catalog based on a sufficiently old equinox and equator cannot be used without corrections if reasonable accuracy is required.

Additionally, stars move relative to each other through space. Apparent motion across the sky relative to other stars is called proper motion. Most stars have very small proper motions, but a few have proper motions that accumulate to noticeable distances after a few tens of years. So, some stellar positions read from a star atlas or catalog for a sufficiently old epoch require proper motion corrections as well, for reasonable accuracy.

Due to precession and proper motion, star data become less useful as the age of the observations and their epoch, and the equinox and equator to which they are referred, get older. After a while, it is easier or better to switch to newer data, generally referred to as a newer epoch and equinox/equator, than to keep applying corrections to the older data.

==Specifying an epoch or equinox==
Epochs and equinoxes are moments in time, so they can be specified in the same way as moments that indicate things other than epochs and equinoxes. The following standard ways of specifying epochs and equinoxes seem the most popular:

* Julian days, e.g., JD 2433282.4235 for January 0.9235, 1950 TT
* Besselian years (see below), e.g., 1950.0 or B1950.0 for January 0.9235, 1950 TT
* Julian years, e.g., J2000.0 for January 1.5, 2000 TT

All three of these are expressed in TT = Terrestrial Time.

Besselian years, used mostly for star positions, can be encountered in older catalogs but are now becoming obsolete. The Hipparcos catalog summary, for example, defines the &quot;catalog epoch&quot; as &quot;J1991.25&quot; (8.75 Julian years before January 1.5, 2000 TT, e.g., April 2.5625, 1991 TT).

==Besselian years==

A Besselian year is named after the German mathematician and astronomer Friedrich Bessel (1784–1846). defines the beginning of a Besselian year to be the moment at which the mean longitude of the Sun, including the effect of aberration and measured from the mean equinox of the date, is exactly 280 degrees. This moment falls near the beginning of the corresponding Gregorian year. The definition depended on a particular theory of the orbit of the Earth around the Sun, that of Newcomb (1895), which is now obsolete; for that reason among others, the use of Besselian years has also become or is becoming obsolete.

 says that a &quot;Besselian epoch&quot; can be calculated from the Julian date according to

: B = 1900.0 + (Julian date − 2415020.31352) / 365.242198781

Lieske&#x27;s definition is not exactly consistent with the earlier definition in terms of the mean longitude of the Sun. When using Besselian years, specify which definition is being used.

To distinguish between calendar years and Besselian years, it became customary to add &quot;.0&quot; to the Besselian years. Since the switch to Julian years in the mid-1980s, it has become customary to prefix &quot;B&quot; to Besselian years. So, &quot;1950&quot; is the calendar year 1950, and &quot;1950.0&quot; = &quot;B1950.0&quot; is the beginning of Besselian year 1950.

* The IAU constellation boundaries are defined in the equatorial coordinate system relative to the equinox of B1875.0.
* The Henry Draper Catalog uses the equinox B1900.0.
* The classical star atlas Tabulae Caelestes used B1925.0 as its equinox.

According to Meeus, and also according to the formula given above,

* B1900.0 = JDE 2415020.3135 = 1900 January 0.8135 TT
* B1950.0 = JDE 2433282.4235 = 1950 January 0.9235 TT

==Julian years and J2000==

A Julian year is an interval with the length of a mean year in the Julian calendar, i.e. 365.25 days. This interval measure does not itself define any epoch: the Gregorian calendar is in general use for dating. But, standard conventional epochs which are not Besselian epochs have been often designated nowadays with a prefix &quot;J&quot;, and the calendar date to which they refer is widely known, although not always the same date in the year: thus &quot;J2000&quot; refers to the instant of 12 noon (midday) on January 1, 2000, and J1900 refers to the instant of 12 noon on January 0, 1900, equal to December 31, 1899. It is also usual now to specify on what time scale the time of day is expressed in that epoch-designation, e.g. often Terrestrial Time.

In addition, an epoch optionally prefixed by &quot;J&quot; and designated as a year with decimals (), where is either positive or negative and is quoted to 1 or 2 decimal places, has come to mean a date that is an interval of Julian years of 365.25 days away from the epoch J2000 = JD 2451545.0 (TT), still corresponding (in spite of the use of the prefix &quot;J&quot; or word &quot;Julian&quot;) to the Gregorian calendar date of January 1, 2000, at 12h TT (about 64 seconds before noon UTC on the same calendar day). (See also Julian year (astronomy).) Like the Besselian epoch, an arbitrary Julian epoch is therefore related to the Julian date by

The IAU decided at their General Assembly of 1976 that the new standard equinox of J2000.0 should be used starting in 1984. Before that, the equinox of B1950.0 seems to have been the standard.

Different astronomers or groups of astronomers used to define individually, but today standard epochs are generally defined by international agreements through the IAU, so astronomers worldwide can collaborate more effectively. It is inefficient and error-prone if data or observations of one group have to be translated in non-standard ways so that other groups could compare the data with information from other sources. An example of how this works: if a star&#x27;s position is measured by someone today, they then use a standard transformation to obtain the position expressed in terms of the standard reference frame of J2000, and it is often then this J2000 position which is shared with others.

On the other hand, there has also been an astronomical tradition of retaining observations in just the form in which they were made, so that others can later correct the reductions to standard if that proves desirable, as has sometimes occurred.

The currently used standard epoch &quot;J2000&quot; is defined by international agreement to be equivalent to:
# The Gregorian date January 1, 2000, at 12:00 TT (Terrestrial Time).
# The Julian date 2451545.0 TT (Terrestrial Time).
# January 1, 2000, 11:59:27.816 TAI (International Atomic Time).
# January 1, 2000, 11:58:55.816 UTC (Coordinated Universal Time).

== Epoch of the day ==

Over shorter timescales, there are a variety of practices for defining when each day begins. In ordinary usage, the civil day is reckoned by the midnight epoch, that is, the civil day begins at midnight. But in older astronomical usage, it was usual, until January 1, 1925, to reckon by a noon epoch, 12 hours after the start of the civil day of the same denomination, so that the day began when the mean sun crossed the meridian at noon. This is still reflected in the definition of J2000, which started at noon, Terrestrial Time.

In traditional cultures and in antiquity other epochs were used. In ancient Egypt, days were reckoned from sunrise to sunrise, following a morning epoch. This may be related to the fact that the Egyptians regulated their year by the heliacal rising of the star Sirius, a phenomenon which occurs in the morning just before dawn.

In some cultures following a lunar or lunisolar calendar, in which the beginning of the month is determined by the appearance of the New Moon in the evening, the beginning of the day was reckoned from sunset to sunset, following an evening epoch, e.g. the Jewish and Islamic calendars and in Medieval Western Europe in reckoning the dates of religious festivals, while in others a morning epoch was followed, e.g. the Hindu and Buddhist calendars.

<text>A Bézier triangle is a special type of Bézier surface that is created by (linear, quadratic, cubic or higher degree) interpolation of control points.

==&quot;n&quot;th-order Bézier triangle==
A general &quot;n&quot;th-order Bézier triangle has (&quot;n&quot; +1)(&quot;n&quot; + 2)/2 control points &quot;α&quot;&quot;i&quot;&quot;β&quot;&quot;j&quot;&quot;γ&quot;&quot;k&quot; where &quot;i&quot;, &quot;j&quot;, &quot;k&quot; are non-negative integers such that &quot;i&quot; + &quot;j&quot; + &quot;k&quot; = &quot;n&quot;. The surface is then defined as

: formula_1

for all non-negative real numbers &quot;s&quot; + &quot;t&quot; + &quot;u&quot; = 1.

With linear order (formula_2), the resulting Bézier triangle is actually a regular flat triangle, with the triangle vertices equaling the three control points. A quadratic (formula_3) Bézier triangle features 6 control points which are all located on the edges. The cubic (formula_4) Bézier triangle is defined by 10 control points and is the lowest order Bézier triangle that has an internal control point, not located on the edges. In all cases, the edges of the triangle will be Bézier curves of the same degree.

==Cubic Bézier triangle==
A cubic Bézier triangle is a surface with the equation

:formula_5

where α3, β3, γ3, α2β, αβ2, β2γ, βγ2, αγ2, α2γ and αβγ are the control points of the triangle and &quot;s&quot;, &quot;t&quot;, &quot;u&quot; (with 0 ≤ &quot;s&quot;, &quot;t&quot;, &quot;u&quot; ≤ 1 and &quot;s&quot; + &quot;t&quot; + &quot;u&quot; = 1) are the barycentric coordinates inside the triangle.

Alternatively, a cubic Bézier triangle can be expressed as a more generalized formulation as

:formula_6

in accordance with the formulation of the . 

The corners of the triangle are the points α3, β3 and γ3. The edges of the triangle are themselves Bézier curves, with the same control points as the Bézier triangle.

By removing the γ&quot;u&quot; term, a regular Bézier curve results. Also, while not very useful for display on a physical computer screen, by adding extra terms, a Bézier tetrahedron or Bézier polytope results.

Due to the nature of the equation, the entire triangle will be contained within the volume surrounded by the control points, and affine transformations of the control points will correctly transform the whole triangle in the same way.

===Halving a cubic Bézier triangle===
An advantage of Bézier triangles in computer graphics is that dividing the Bézier triangle into two separate Bézier triangles requires only addition and division by two, rather than floating point arithmetic. This means that while Bézier triangles are smooth, they can easily be approximated using regular triangles by recursively dividing the triangle in two until the resulting triangles are considered sufficiently small. 

The following computes the new control points for the half of the full Bézier triangle with the corner α3, a corner halfway along the Bézier curve between α3 and β3, and the third corner γ3.
:formula_7
:equivalently, using addition and division by two only,
:where := means to replace the vector on the left with the vector on the right.
:Note that halving a Bézier triangle is similar to halving Bézier curves of all orders up to the order of the Bézier triangle.

<text>Paul Eugène Louis Deschanel (; 13 February 185528 April 1922) was a French politician who served as President of France from 18 February to 21 September 1920.

== Biography ==
Paul Deschanel, the son of Émile Deschanel (1819–1904), professor at the Collège de France and senator, was born in Brussels, where his father was living in exile (1851–1859), owing to his opposition to Napoleon III. He is one of only two French Presidents (the other is Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing) who were born outside France (Deschanel in Belgium, Giscard in Koblenz, Germany).

=== Education ===
Paul Deschanel was schooled at the Collège Sainte-Barbe-des-Champs in Fontenay-aux-Roses, then at the Lycée Louis-le-Grand and the Lycée Condorcet in Paris. The family left Paris for several months in 1870–1871, due to the Siege of Paris. Deschanel completed his military service in the infantry in Paris in 1873, then studied at the École Libre des Sciences Politiques and the Faculty of Law of Paris, graduating with a baccalaureate in law in 1874 and a licentiate in law in 1875.

=== Early career ===

He began his career as secretary to Deshayes de Marcère (1876) and to Jules Simon (1876–1877). In October 1885, he was elected deputy for Eure-et-Loir. From the first, he took an important place in the chamber, as one of the most notable orators of the Progressist Republican group. In January 1896, he was elected vice-president of the chamber, and henceforth devoted himself to the struggle against the Left, not only in parliament, but also in public meetings throughout France.

His addresses at Marseille on 26 October 1896, at Carmaux on 27 December 1896, and at Roubaix on 10 April 1897, were triumphs of clear and eloquent exposition of the political and social aims of the Progressist party.

In June 1898, he was elected president of the chamber, and was re-elected in 1901, but rejected in 1902. Nevertheless, he came forward brilliantly in 1904 and 1905 as a supporter of the law on the separation of church and state. He also gained a position on the Committee of Foreign Affairs, and was president of the committee when the Franco-German treaty of 1911 came before Parliament.

He was re-elected deputy in 1910, and on 23 May 1912 was chosen to be the President of the Chamber. In this role he played a great part during World War I as the national orator; he delivered orations more frequently than he made speeches. He served until he was elected President of France on 17 January 1920 by an overwhelming majority, having beaten Georges Clemenceau in the preliminary party ballot.

=== Presidency ===

Deschanel aspired to a much more active role as president than had been &quot;de rigueur&quot; under the Third Republic; and was a very promising leader for the first six months but, for reasons of his own mental health, was unable to put his ideas to the test.

As president, his eccentric behaviour caused some consternation; on one occasion, after a delegation of schoolgirls had presented him with a bouquet, he tossed the flowers back at them. On another occasion a few days later, he gave an interview to the British ambassador wearing nothing but his decorations. It all culminated when, late one night, 24 May 1920, he fell out of a large window of the presidential train near Montargis after taking some sleeping pills and was found wandering in his nightshirt by a platelayer, who took him to the nearest level-crossing keeper&#x27;s cottage. His resignation was offered on 21 September 1920, and he was placed in a sanatorium at Rueil-Malmaison for three months. After his release he was elected to the senate in January 1921, serving until his death from pneumonia, one year later.

Until the death penalty was abolished in 1981, he was the only French head of state during whose term in office no persons in France were executed. Deschanel himself was a longtime death penalty opponent.

<text>A Boy and His Dog is a cycle of narratives by author Harlan Ellison. The cycle tells the story of an amoral boy (Vic) and his telepathic dog (Blood), who work together as a team to survive in the post-apocalyptic world after a nuclear war. The original 1969 novella was adapted into the 1975 film &quot;A Boy and His Dog&quot; directed by L.Q. Jones. 

Both the story and the film were well-received by critics and science fiction fans, but the film was not successful commercially. The original novella was followed by short stories and a graphic novel. The dog in the movie was first in the 1969 Brady Bunch episodes named Tiger.

==Publication history==
Ellison began the cycle with the 1969 short story of the same title, published in &quot;New Worlds&quot;, and expanded and revised the tale to novella length for his story collection &quot;The Beast That Shouted Love at the Heart of the World&quot; the same year. He bookended the original story with two others in the same world: &quot;Eggsucker&quot; (&quot;The Ariel Book of Fantasy Volume Two&quot;, 1977), and &quot;Run, Spot, Run&quot; (&quot;Amazing Stories&quot;, 1980).

The stories were adapted as a two-issue black and white comic series illustrated by Richard Corben, &quot;Vic and Blood: The Chronicles of a Boy and His Dog&quot; (Mad Dog Graphics, 1987). The series was collected as a color graphic novel of the same name in 1989 by NBM/St. Martin&#x27;s Press. It was published in French by Comics USA (&quot;Vic &amp; Blood: Les chroniques d&#x27;un gars et son chien&quot;, 1989) and in Spanish by Norma Editorial (&quot;Vic &amp; Blood&quot;, CEC No. 72, 1990). 

Both the graphic novel and the prose stories were collected in &quot;Vic and Blood: The Continuing Adventures of a Boy and His Dog&quot; (Edgework Abbey/iBooks, 2003). Ellison&#x27;s introduction to the collection explains that 1969&#x27;s &quot;A Boy and His Dog&quot; is part of a larger novel that he has been writing for over 30 years and that story is finished, but the last, longest part is written as a screenplay with no current plans for production.

Ellison suggested as late as 2003 that he would combine the three stories, possibly with additional material, to create a novel with the proposed title of &quot;Blood&#x27;s a Rover&quot;, not to be confused with the Chad Oliver story or the James Ellroy novel &quot;Blood&#x27;s a Rover&quot;. In January 2018, Subterranean Press announced the publication of &quot;Blood&#x27;s a Rover&quot;, combining materials from the author&#x27;s files, versions of the novella and short stories that have been expanded and revised, material from Corben&#x27;s graphic novel, and previously unpublished material from the unproduced 1977 NBC television series &quot;Blood&#x27;s a Rover&quot;.

==Setting==
The novella exists in an alternate timeline setting, diverging with the failed assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Instead of concentrating on the Space Race, technological advancements in robotics, animal intelligence, and telepathy take place. A more heated Cold War takes place, culminating in a conventional World War III. 

A truce is signed, lasting another 25 years, though mounting tensions lead to World War IV in 2007, this time involving massive nuclear warfare and only lasting five days. Civilization is almost entirely obliterated, leaving the surface of Earth reduced to a desolate, irradiated wasteland.

Years later, in 2024, foragers who remain above ground must fight for the remaining resources. Most survivors in the former United States are male, as women were usually in the bombed cities while many men were out fighting in the war. In the novella, nuclear fallout had created horrific mutations, such as the feared burnpit screamers, known for their noise and deadliness. In the film, they appear in only one scene, though they are only heard.

==&quot;Eggsucker&quot;==

===Plot===
Blood recalls how he met Vic in 2048, and describes him as &quot;steadfast, responsible, and game as they come.&quot; He recounts an evening during which he and Vic go to barter scavenged items with the &quot;82nd Airborne&quot;, the armorers for most of the local roverpacks except for that of the child-slaver &quot;Fellini&quot;. Transported from a dock by skiff to the 82nd Airborne&#x27;s boat, the pair trade wine and spent brass for fresh ammunition, and Vic is invited to stay and drink. 

Blood declines to drink, and is repeatedly insulted by the gang, until the goading drives him to attempt to bite one of them. The gang member knocks Blood down and points a rifle at Blood&#x27;s head, and Vic immediately shoots the gang member. As Vic covers the remaining stunned gang members, Blood climbs into Vic&#x27;s pack and passes out. He awakens again with them on the dock and Vic running for their lives. 

Upon reaching safety, Vic unceremoniously dumps Blood onto the ground and storms off in anger at having lost access to &quot;the only armorer in the territory.&quot; Blood initially lets him go, but thinks better of it after considering the alternatives, and saves Vic from walking into a crater in the road containing a &quot;Screamer&quot;, a green corpse-like mutant. The pair run miles up the road, and having reconciled, sit down to eat.

==&quot;A Boy and His Dog&quot;==

===Plot===
Vic, aged 15, was born in and scavenges throughout the wasteland of the former southwestern United States as a &quot;solo&quot;, as opposed to a member of a &quot;roverpack&quot; gang. Vic is most concerned with food and sex. Having lost both of his parents, he has no formal education and does not understand ethics or morality. He is accompanied by a well-read, misanthropic, telepathic dog named Blood, who helps him locate women in return for food. Blood cannot forage for himself, due to the same genetic engineering that granted him telepathy. The two steal for a living, evading &quot;roverpacks&quot; (gangs) and mutants. Blood and Vic have an occasionally antagonistic relationship, though they are aware that they need each other.

At a movie house, Blood claims to smell a woman, and the pair track her to an abandoned YMCA building. There, they meet Quilla June Holmes, a teenaged girl from &quot;Downunder&quot;, a society located in a large underground nuclear vault, and Vic, feeling attracted to her, hesitates for the first time before raping her. Blood informs the pair that a roverpack has tracked them to the building, and they have to fight them off. After slaughtering a number of them, the trio hides in a boiler and set the structure on fire. 

Vic then has sex with Quilla June, and though she protests at first, later comes on to him as she also likes him. Blood takes an instant disliking to her, but Vic ignores him. Vic and Quilla June have sex repeatedly, but eventually she attacks him and takes off to return to her underground community. Vic, furious at her deception, follows her, despite Blood&#x27;s warnings. Blood remains at the portal on the surface.

Downunder has an artificial biosphere complete with forests and underground cities. One, named Topeka after the ruins of the city it lies beneath, is fashioned in a surreal mockery of 1950s rural innocence. Vic is captured by a four-foot tank robot with claws called &quot;The Sentry&quot; (a 6&#x27;4&quot;, hefty, grinning android named &quot;Michael&quot; in the film adaptation) built by the ruling council, the Better Business Bureau who ordered the robot to bring Vic to them. They confess that Quilla June was sent to the surface in order to lure a man to Downunder. The population of Topeka is becoming sterile, and the babies that are born are usually female. They feel that Vic, despite his crudeness and savage behavior, will be able to reinvigorate that male population. Vic is first elated to learn that he is to impregnate the female population, but after a week he grows jaded of his surroundings and plots his escape.

He asks to impregnate Quilla June first with the intention of retaliating against her for abandoning him, but when they are reunited, their feelings take hold and they plan to escape together. Vic uses the fact that Quilla June&#x27;s father secretly lusts after her as a distraction, incapacitating him and the other elders so they can escape. A shootout ensues on the street, with Vic narrowly refraining a frenzied Quilla June from shooting her mother.

On the surface, Vic and Quilla June discover that Blood is starving and near death, having been attacked by radioactive insects and other &quot;things&quot;, and Vic and him now being labeled &quot;undesirables&quot; due to the roverpack they killed at the gym. Quilla June tries to convince Vic to leave Blood and take off with her. Knowing he will never survive without Blood&#x27;s guidance and, more importantly, that Blood will not survive without care and food, Vic faces a difficult situation. It is implied that he kills his new love and cooks her flesh to save Blood&#x27;s life. The novella ends with Vic haunted by her question as Blood and him resume traveling the next day: &quot;Do you know what love is?&quot; and he concludes, &quot;Sure I know. A boy loves his dog.&quot;

===Reception===
The novella won the Nebula Award for Best Novella upon its release in 1969 and was also nominated for the 1970 Hugo Award for Best Novella.

===Film adaptation===

The 1975 science fiction film directed by L.Q. Jones was controversial for alleged misogyny. The script included lines that were not in Ellison&#x27;s original stories and that authors such as Joanna Russ found to be objectionable. The film&#x27;s final line is from Blood: &quot;Well, I&#x27;d say she certainly had marvelous judgement, Albert, if not particularly good taste.&quot; Ellison disavowed this addition as a &quot;moronic, hateful chauvinist last line, which I despise.&quot; 

Ellison accepted that the ending remained popular with fans, saying: &quot;I would have kept the original last line from the original story, which I think is much more human and beguiling than the sort of punchline that L.Q. Jones used. But L.Q. knew what he was doing in terms of the market, I suppose.&quot; 

Harlan loved the movie, as stated in an interview conversation with L.Q. Jones on the Shout Factory Blu Ray. After Jones screened it to him, he said it was exactly what the story was supposed to be on screen. It was a few days after he brought up his problems, mostly concerning the way Blood talked about the girl during the locker room scene when they first meet.

==&quot;Run, Spot, Run&quot;==
===Plot===
An almost catatonic Vic and a guilt-ridden Blood continue traveling west, with Vic having hallucinations of a ghostly Quilla June, which Blood shares through their telepathic link. Not daring to bring up the matter of food to Vic, Blood eats a poisonous lizard which along with the hallucinations causes him physical harm. They stumble into an encounter with a roving gang of child slaves led by the adult &quot;Fellini&quot;, and Vic badly breaks his ankle while attempting to escape. 

At Blood&#x27;s suggestion, Vic climbs into a hollow tree stump to hide. Blood covers him with leaves and dirt before going to hide himself. Hours later, with the gang gone, Blood returns to find the stump surrounded by giant spiders. Driving them off, Blood finds Vic in a hopeless, unresponsive state, and despite Blood&#x27;s appeals, Vic allows himself to be cocooned by one of the spiders. Blood runs off as the spider finishes and begins to look for new prey. He continues west, now haunted by the ghost of Vic rather than Quilla June.

===Production===
The reasons given by Ellison for this abrupt ending have differed over the years. One relates to his anger over the L.Q. Jones ending of the film, as detailed above. The other is, according to Ellison, essentially a desire to stop his fans from requesting more stories about the two characters. Ellison claimed at the time of the film&#x27;s release that he had said all he wanted to say about Vic and Blood, and that there would be no more sequels.

===&quot;Blood&#x27;s a Rover&quot;===

&quot;Blood&#x27;s a Rover&quot;, a fix-up combining the short stories, novella, and an adaptation of the unproduced 1977 pilot teleplay, was announced by Ace Books in the early 1980s, but was not published. In the introduction to &quot;Vic and Blood&quot;, in March 2003, Ellison referred to &quot;the final, longest section is in screenplay form—and they&#x27;re bidding here in Hollywood, once again, for the feature film and tv rights—and one of these days before I go through that final door, I&#x27;ll translate it into elegant prose, and the full novel will appear&quot;. 

In 2013, Ellison resumed working on the book, subtitled &quot;The Complete Adventures of a Boy and His Dog&quot;. It was published by Subterranean Press on June 30, 2018, two days after Ellison&#x27;s death.

==Legacy==
The film adaptation was an influence on &quot;Love and Monsters&quot; (2020) by Michael Matthews. 

The story and its film adaptation have also been mentioned to be influential in the creation of both George Miller&#x27;s &quot;Mad Max&quot; film franchise and the &quot;Fallout&quot; video game series by Black Isle Studios.

<text>Red supergiants (RSGs) are stars with a supergiant luminosity class (Yerkes class I) and a stellar classification K or M. They are the largest stars in the universe in terms of volume, although they are not the most massive or luminous. Betelgeuse and Antares A are the brightest and best known red supergiants (RSGs), indeed the only first magnitude red supergiant stars.

==Classification==
Stars are classified as supergiants on the basis of their spectral luminosity class. This system uses certain diagnostic spectral lines to estimate the surface gravity of a star, hence determining its size relative to its mass. Larger stars are more luminous at a given temperature and can now be grouped into bands of differing luminosity.

The luminosity differences between stars are most apparent at low temperatures, where giant stars are much brighter than main-sequence stars. Supergiants have the lowest surface gravities and hence are the largest and brightest at a particular temperature.

The &quot;Yerkes&quot; or &quot;Morgan-Keenan&quot; (MK) classification system is almost universal. It groups stars into five main luminosity groups designated by roman numerals:
* I supergiant;
* II bright giant;
* III giant;
* IV subgiant;
* V dwarf (main sequence).

Specific to supergiants, the luminosity class is further divided into normal supergiants of class Ib and brightest supergiants of class Ia. The intermediate class Iab is also used. Exceptionally bright, low surface gravity, stars with strong indications of mass loss may be designated by luminosity class 0 (zero) although this is rarely seen. More often the designation Ia-0 will be used, and more commonly still Ia+. These hypergiant spectral classifications are very rarely applied to red supergiants, although the term red hypergiant is sometimes used for the most extended and unstable red supergiants like VY Canis Majoris and NML Cygni.

The &quot;red&quot; part of &quot;red supergiant&quot; refers to the cool temperature. Red supergiants are the coolest supergiants, M-type, and at least some K-type stars although there is no precise cutoff. K-type supergiants are uncommon compared to M-type because they are a short-lived transition stage and somewhat unstable. The K-type stars, especially early or hotter K types, are sometimes described as orange supergiants (e.g. Zeta Cephei), or even as yellow (e.g. yellow hypergiant HR 5171 Aa).

==Properties==

Red supergiants are cool and large. They have spectral types of K and M, hence surface temperatures below 4,100 K. They are typically several hundred to over a thousand times the radius of the Sun, although size is not the primary factor in a star being designated as a supergiant. A bright cool giant star can easily be larger than a hotter supergiant. For example, Alpha Herculis is classified as a giant star with a radius of while Epsilon Pegasi is a K2 supergiant of only .

Although red supergiants are much cooler than the Sun, they are so much larger that they are highly luminous, typically . There is a theoretical upper limit to the radius of a red supergiant at around . In the Hayashi limit, stars above this radius would be too unstable and simply do not form.

Red supergiants have masses between about and 30 or . Main-sequence stars more massive than about do not expand and cool to become red supergiants. Red supergiants at the upper end of the possible mass and luminosity range are the largest known. Their low surface gravities and high luminosities cause extreme mass loss, millions of times higher than the Sun, producing observable nebulae surrounding the star. By the end of their lives red supergiants may have lost a substantial fraction of their initial mass. The more massive supergiants lose mass much more rapidly and all red supergiants appear to reach a similar mass of the order of by the time their cores collapse. The exact value depends on the initial chemical makeup of the star and its rotation rate.

Most red supergiants show some degree of visual variability, but only rarely with a well-defined period or amplitude. Therefore, they are usually classified as irregular or semiregular variables. They even have their own sub-classes, SRC and LC for slow semi-regular and slow irregular supergiant variables respectively. Variations are typically slow and of small amplitude, but amplitudes up to four magnitudes are known.

Statistical analysis of many known variable red supergiants shows a number of likely causes for variation: just a few stars show large amplitudes and strong noise indicating variability at many frequencies, thought to indicate powerful stellar winds that occur towards the end of the life of a red supergiant; more common are simultaneous radial mode variations over a few hundred days and probably non-radial mode variations over a few thousand days; only a few stars appear to be truly irregular, with small amplitudes, likely due to photospheric granulation. Red supergiant photospheres contain a relatively small number of very large convection cells compared to stars like the Sun. This causes variations in surface brightness that can lead to visible brightness variations as the star rotates.

The spectra of red supergiants are similar to other cool stars, dominated by a forest of absorption lines of metals and molecular bands. Some of these features are used to determine the luminosity class, for example certain near-infrared cyanogen band strengths and the Ca II triplet.

Maser emission is common from the circumstellar material around red supergiants. Most commonly this arises from H2O and SiO, but hydroxyl (OH) emission also occurs from narrow regions. In addition to high resolution mapping of the circumstellar material around red supergiants, VLBI or VLBA observations of masers can be used to derive accurate parallaxes and distances to their sources. Currently this has been applied mainly to individual objects, but it may become useful for analysis of galactic structure and discovery of otherwise obscured red supergiant stars.

Surface abundances of red supergiants are dominated by hydrogen even though hydrogen at the core has been completely consumed. In the latest stages of mass loss, before a star explodes, surface helium may become enriched to levels comparable with hydrogen. In theoretical extreme mass loss models, sufficient hydrogen may be lost that helium becomes the most abundant element at the surface. When pre-red supergiant stars leave the main sequence, oxygen is more abundant than carbon at the surface, and nitrogen is less abundant than either, reflecting abundances from the formation of the star. Carbon and oxygen are quickly depleted and nitrogen enhanced as a result of the dredge-up of CNO-processed material from the fusion layers.

Red supergiants are observed to rotate slowly or very slowly. Models indicate that even rapidly rotating main-sequence stars should be braked by their mass loss so that red supergiants hardly rotate at all. Those red supergiants such as Betelgeuse that do have modest rates of rotation may have acquired it after reaching the red supergiant stage, perhaps through binary interaction. The cores of red supergiants are still rotating and the differential rotation rate can be very large.

==Definition==

Supergiant luminosity classes are easy to determine and apply to large numbers of stars, but they group several very different types of stars into a single category. An evolutionary definition restricts the term supergiant to those massive stars which start core helium fusion without developing a degenerate helium core and without undergoing a helium flash. They will universally go on to burn heavier elements and undergo core-collapse resulting in a supernova.

Less massive stars may develop a supergiant spectral luminosity class at relatively low luminosity, around when they are on the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) undergoing helium shell burning. Researchers now prefer to categorize these as AGB stars distinct from supergiants because they are less massive, have different chemical compositions at the surface, undergo different types of pulsation and variability, and will evolve differently, usually producing a planetary nebula and white dwarf. Most AGB stars will not become supernovae although there is interest in a class of &quot;super-AGB stars&quot;, those almost massive enough to undergo full carbon fusion, which may produce peculiar supernovae although without ever developing an iron core. One notable group of low mass high luminosity stars are the RV Tauri variables, AGB or post-AGB stars lying on the instability strip and showing distinctive semi-regular variations.

==Evolution==

Red supergiants develop from main-sequence stars with masses between about and 30 or . Higher-mass stars never cool sufficiently to become red supergiants. Lower-mass stars develop a degenerate helium core during a red giant phase, undergo a helium flash before fusing helium on the horizontal branch, evolve along the AGB while burning helium in a shell around a degenerate carbon-oxygen core, then rapidly lose their outer layers to become a white dwarf with a planetary nebula. AGB stars may develop spectra with a supergiant luminosity class as they expand to extreme dimensions relative to their small mass, and they may reach luminosities tens of thousands times the sun&#x27;s. Intermediate &quot;super-AGB&quot; stars, around , can undergo carbon fusion and may produce an electron capture supernova through the collapse of an oxygen-neon core.

Main-sequence stars, burning hydrogen in their cores, with masses between will have temperatures between about 25,000K and 32,000K and spectral types of early B, possibly very late O. They are already very luminous stars of due to rapid CNO cycle fusion of hydrogen and they have fully convective cores. In contrast to the Sun, the outer layers of these hot main-sequence stars are not convective.

These pre-red supergiant main-sequence stars exhaust the hydrogen in their cores after 5–20 million years. They then start to burn a shell of hydrogen around the now-predominantly helium core, and this causes them to expand and cool into supergiants. Their luminosity increases by a factor of about three. The surface abundance of helium is now up to 40% but there is little enrichment of heavier elements.

The supergiants continue to cool and most will rapidly pass through the Cepheid instability strip, although the most massive will spend a brief period as yellow hypergiants. They will reach late K or M class and become a red supergiant. Helium fusion in the core begins smoothly either while the star is expanding or once it is already a red supergiant, but this produces little immediate change at the surface. Red supergiants develop deep convection zones reaching from the surface over halfway to the core and these cause strong enrichment of nitrogen at the surface, with some enrichment of heavier elements.

Some red supergiants undergo blue loops where they temporarily increase in temperature before returning to the red supergiant state. This depends on the mass, rate of rotation, and chemical makeup of the star. While many red supergiants will not experience a blue loop, some can have several. Temperatures can reach 10,000K at the peak of the blue loop. The exact reasons for blue loops vary in different stars, but they are always related to the helium core increasing as a proportion of the mass of the star and forcing higher mass-loss rates from the outer layers.

All red supergiants will exhaust the helium in their cores within one or two million years and then start to burn carbon. This continues with fusion of heavier elements until an iron core builds up, which then inevitably collapses to produce a supernova. The time from the onset of carbon fusion until the core collapse is no more than a few thousand years. In most cases, core-collapse occurs while the star is still a red supergiant, the large remaining hydrogen-rich atmosphere is ejected, and this produces a type II supernova spectrum. The opacity of this ejected hydrogen decreases as it cools and this causes an extended delay to the drop in brightness after the initial supernova peak, the characteristic of a Type II-P supernova.

The most luminous red supergiants, at near solar metallicity, are expected to lose most of their outer layers before their cores collapse, hence they evolve back to yellow hypergiants and luminous blue variables. Such stars can explode as type II-L supernovae, still with hydrogen in their spectra but not with sufficient hydrogen to cause an extended brightness plateau in their light curves. Stars with even less hydrogen remaining may produce the uncommon type IIb supernova, where there is so little hydrogen remaining that the hydrogen lines in the initial type II spectrum fade to the appearance of a Type Ib supernova.

The observed progenitors of type II-P supernovae all have temperatures between 3,500K and 4,400K and luminosities between and . This matches the expected parameters of lower mass red supergiants. A small number of progenitors of type II-L and type IIb supernovae have been observed, all having luminosities around and somewhat higher temperatures up to 6,000K. These are a good match for slightly higher mass red supergiants with high mass-loss rates. There are no known supernova progenitors corresponding to the most luminous red supergiants, and it is expected that these evolve to Wolf Rayet stars before exploding.

==Clusters==

Red supergiants are necessarily no more than about 25 million years old and such massive stars are expected to form only in relatively large clusters of stars, so they are expected to be found mostly near prominent clusters. However they are fairly short-lived compared to other phases in the life of a star and only form from relatively uncommon massive stars, so there will generally only be small numbers of red supergiants in each cluster at any one time. The massive Hodge 301 cluster in the Tarantula Nebula contains three. Until the 21st century the largest number of red supergiants known in a single cluster was five in NGC 7419. Most red supergiants are found singly, for example Betelgeuse in the Orion OB1 association and Antares in the Scorpius–Centaurus association.

Since 2006, a series of massive clusters have been identified near the base of the Crux-Scutum Arm of the galaxy, each containing multiple red supergiants. RSGC1 contains at least 12 red supergiants, RSGC2 (also known as Stephenson 2) contains at least 26, RSGC3 contains at least 8, and RSGC4 (also known as Alicante 8) also contains at least 8. A total of 80 confirmed red supergiants have been identified within a small area of the sky in the direction of these clusters. These four clusters appear to be part of a massive burst of star formation 10–20 million years ago at the near end of the bar at the centre of the galaxy. Similar massive clusters have been found near the far end of the galactic bar, but not such large numbers of red supergiants.

==Examples==

Red supergiants are rare stars, but they are visible at great distance and are often variable so there are a number of well-known naked-eye examples:
* Antares A
* Betelgeuse
* Epsilon Pegasi
* Zeta Cephei
* Lambda Velorum
* Eta Persei
* 31 and 32 Cygni
* Psi1 Aurigae
* 119 Tauri
Mira was historically thought to be a red supergiant star, but is now widely accepted to be an asymptotic giant branch star.

Some red supergiants are larger and more luminous, with radii exceeding over a thousand times that of the Sun. These are hence also referred to as red hypergiants:

* Mu Cephei
* VV Cephei A
* NML Cygni
* S Persei
* UY Scuti
* VY Canis Majoris
* Westerlund 1 W26
* WOH G64: transitioned into a yellow hypergiant in 2014.
* KY Cygni
* BI Cygni

A survey expected to capture virtually all Magellanic Cloud red supergiants detected around a dozen M class stars Mv−7 and brighter, around a quarter of a million times more luminous than the Sun, and from about 1,000 times the radius of the Sun upwards.

<doc id="200020" wikidata="Q598116" url="?curid=200020" title="Blonde on Blonde">
<text>Blonde on Blonde is the seventh studio album by the American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan, released as a double album on June 20, 1966, by Columbia Records. Recording sessions began in New York in October 1965 with numerous backing musicians, including members of Dylan&#x27;s live backing band, the Hawks. Though sessions continued until January 1966, they yielded only one track that made it onto the final album—&quot;One of Us Must Know (Sooner or Later)&quot;. At producer Bob Johnston&#x27;s suggestion, Dylan, keyboardist Al Kooper, and guitarist Robbie Robertson moved to the CBS studios in Nashville, Tennessee. These sessions, augmented by some of Nashville&#x27;s top session musicians, were more fruitful, and in February and March all the remaining songs for the album were recorded.

&quot;Blonde on Blonde&quot; completed the trilogy of rock albums that Dylan recorded in 1965 and 1966, starting with &quot;Bringing It All Back Home&quot; and &quot;Highway 61 Revisited&quot; (both 1965). Critics often rank &quot;Blonde on Blonde&quot; as one of the greatest albums of all time. Combining the expertise of Nashville session musicians with a modernist literary sensibility, the album&#x27;s songs have been described as operating on a grand scale musically, while featuring lyrics one critic called &quot;a unique mixture of the visionary and the colloquial&quot;. It was one of the first double albums in rock music.

The album peaked at number nine on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs chart in the US, where it eventually was certified double platinum, and it reached number three in the UK. &quot;Blonde on Blonde&quot; spawned two singles that were top-twenty hits in the US: &quot;Rainy Day Women #12 &amp; 35&quot; and &quot;I Want You&quot;. Two additional songs—&quot;Just Like a Woman&quot; and &quot;Visions of Johanna&quot;—have been named as among Dylan&#x27;s greatest compositions and were featured in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s &quot;The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot; list in 2003. In 1999, the album was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame, and was ranked number 38 in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot; in 2020.
==Background==
After the release of &quot;Highway 61 Revisited&quot; in August 1965, Dylan set about hiring a touring band. Guitarist Mike Bloomfield and keyboard player Al Kooper had backed Dylan on the album and at Dylan&#x27;s controversial electric debut at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival. However, Bloomfield chose not to tour with Dylan, preferring to remain with the Paul Butterfield Blues Band. After backing him at concerts in late August and early September, Kooper informed Dylan he did not wish to continue touring with him. Dylan&#x27;s manager, Albert Grossman, was in the process of setting up a grueling concert schedule that would keep Dylan on the road for the next nine months, touring the U.S., Australia, and Europe. Dylan contacted a group who were performing as Levon and the Hawks, consisting of Levon Helm from Arkansas and four Canadian musicians: Robbie Robertson, Rick Danko, Richard Manuel and Garth Hudson. They had come together as a band in Canada, backing American rocker Ronnie Hawkins. Two people had strongly recommended the Hawks to Dylan: Mary Martin, the executive secretary of Grossman, and blues singer John Hammond Jr., son of record producer John Hammond, who had signed Dylan to Columbia Records in 1961; the Hawks had backed the younger Hammond on his 1965 album &quot;So Many Roads&quot;.

Bob Dylan rehearsed with the Hawks in Toronto on September 15, where they were playing a hometown residency at Friar&#x27;s Club, and on September 24, they made their debut in Austin, Texas. Two weeks later, encouraged by the success of their Texas performance, Dylan took the Hawks into Studio A of Columbia Records in New York City. Their immediate task was to record a hit single as the follow-up to &quot;Positively 4th Street&quot;, but Dylan was already shaping his next album, the third one that year backed by rock musicians.

== Recording ==

===New York sessions===
Producer Bob Johnston, who had overseen the recording of &quot;Highway 61 Revisited&quot;, started work with Dylan and the Hawks at Columbia Studio A, 799 Seventh Avenue, New York, on October 5. They concentrated on a new arrangement of &quot;Can You Please Crawl Out Your Window?&quot;, a song recorded during the &quot;Highway 61 Revisited&quot; sessions but not included on that album. Three further numbers were attempted, but none progressed into completed songs. Both the fragmentary &quot;Jet Pilot&quot; and &quot;I Wanna Be Your Lover&quot;, a quasi-parody of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;I Wanna Be Your Man&quot;, finally appeared on the 1985 box set retrospective, &quot;Biograph&quot;. Also attempted were two takes of &quot;Medicine Sunday&quot;, a song that later evolved into &quot;Temporary Like Achilles&quot;.

On November 30, the Hawks joined Dylan again at Studio A, but drummer Bobby Gregg replaced Levon Helm, who had tired of playing in a backing band and quit. They began work on a new composition, &quot;Freeze Out&quot;, which was later retitled &quot;Visions of Johanna&quot;, but Dylan was not satisfied with the results. One of the November 30 recordings was eventually released on &quot;The Bootleg Series Vol. 7: No Direction Home: The Soundtrack&quot; in 2005. At this session, they completed &quot;Can You Please Crawl Out Your Window?&quot; The song was released as a single in December, but only reached number 58 on the American charts.

Dylan spent most of December in California, performing a dozen concerts with his band, and then took a break through the third week in January following the birth of his son Jesse. On January 21, 1966, he returned to Columbia&#x27;s Studio A to record another long composition, &quot;She&#x27;s Your Lover Now&quot;, accompanied by the Hawks (this time with Sandy Konikoff on drums). Despite nineteen takes, the session failed to yield any complete recordings. Dylan did not attempt the song again, but one of the outtakes from the January 21 session finally appeared 25 years later on &quot;The Bootleg Series Volumes 1–3 (Rare &amp; Unreleased) 1961–1991&quot;. (Although the song breaks down at the start of the last verse, Columbia released it as the most complete take from the session.) Since 2015, this same outtake plus three other ones are available on &quot;The Bootleg Series Vol. 12: The Cutting Edge 1965–1966&quot;.

Around this time, Dylan became disillusioned about using the Hawks in the studio. He recorded more material at Studio A on January 25, backed by drummer Bobby Gregg, bassist Rick Danko (or Bill Lee), guitarist Robbie Robertson, pianist Paul Griffin, and organist Al Kooper. Two more new compositions were attempted: &quot;Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat&quot; and &quot;One of Us Must Know (Sooner or Later)&quot;. Dylan was satisfied with &quot;One of Us Must Know&quot;; the January 25 take was released as a single a few weeks later and was subsequently selected for the album.

Another session took place on January 27, this time with Robertson, Danko, Kooper and Gregg. Dylan and his band recorded &quot;Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat&quot; and &quot;One of Us Must Know (Sooner or Later)&quot; again, but Dylan was not satisfied with the recorded performance of either song. Also at this session Dylan attempted a rough performance of &quot;I&#x27;ll Keep It with Mine&quot;, a song which he had already recorded twice as a demo. The musicians added some tentative backing in a rendering biographer Clinton Heylin described as &quot;cursory&quot;. The recording was ultimately released on &quot;The Bootleg Series Volumes 1–3&quot; in 1991.

A shortage of new material and the slow progress of the sessions contributed to Dylan&#x27;s decision to cancel three additional recording dates. Six weeks later Dylan confided to critic Robert Shelton, &quot;Oh, I was really down. I mean, in ten recording sessions, man, we didn&#x27;t get one song ... It was the band. But you see, I didn&#x27;t know that. I didn&#x27;t want to think that&quot;.

===Move to Nashville===
Recognizing Dylan&#x27;s dissatisfaction with the progress of the recordings, producer Bob Johnston suggested that they move the sessions to Nashville. Johnston lived there and had extensive experience working with Nashville session musicians. He recalled how Dylan&#x27;s manager, Albert Grossman, was hostile to the idea: &quot;Grossman came up to me and said &#x27;If you ever mention Nashville to Dylan again, you&#x27;re gone.&#x27; I said, &#x27;What do you mean?&#x27; He said, &#x27;You heard me. We got a thing going here&#x27;&quot;. Despite Grossman&#x27;s opposition, Dylan agreed to Johnston&#x27;s suggestion, and preparations were made to record the album at Columbia Studio A in Nashville&#x27;s Music Row in February 1966.

In addition to Kooper and Robertson, who accompanied Dylan from New York, Johnston recruited harmonica player, guitarist and bassist Charlie McCoy, guitarist Wayne Moss, guitarist and bassist Joe South, and drummer Kenny Buttrey. At Dylan&#x27;s request, Johnston removed the baffles—partitions separating the musicians so that there was &quot;an ambience fit for an ensemble&quot;. Buttrey credited the distinctive sound of the album to Johnston&#x27;s re-arrangement of the studio, &quot;as if we were on a tight stage, as opposed to playing in a big hall where you&#x27;re ninety miles apart&quot;. Dylan had a piano installed in his Nashville hotel room which Kooper would play to help Dylan write lyrics. Kooper would then teach the tunes to the musicians before Dylan arrived for the sessions.

On the first Nashville session, on February 14, Dylan successfully recorded &quot;Visions of Johanna&quot;, which he had attempted several times in New York. Also recorded was a take of &quot;4th Time Around&quot; which made it onto the album and a take of &quot;Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat&quot; which did not.

On February 15 the session began at 6 p.m. but Dylan simply sat in the studio working on his lyrics while the musicians played cards, napped and chatted. Finally, at 4 am, Dylan called the musicians in and outlined the structure of the song. Dylan counted off and the musicians fell in, as he attempted his epic composition &quot;Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands&quot;. Kenny Buttrey recalled, &quot;If you notice that record, that thing after like the second chorus starts building and building like crazy, and everybody&#x27;s just peaking it up &#x27;cause we thought, Man, this is it ... This is gonna be the last chorus and we&#x27;ve gotta put everything into it we can. And he played another harmonica solo and went back down to another verse and the dynamics had to drop back down to a verse kind of feel ... After about ten minutes of this thing we&#x27;re cracking up at each other, at what we were doing. I mean, we peaked five minutes ago. Where do we go from here?&quot; The finished song clocked in at 11 minutes, 23 seconds, and would occupy the entire fourth side of the album.

The next session began similarly—Dylan spent the afternoon writing lyrics, and the session continued into the early hours of February 17, when the musicians began to record &quot;Stuck Inside of Mobile with the Memphis Blues Again&quot;. After several musical revisions and false starts, the fourteenth take was the version selected for the album.

===Nashville recording dates===
Most accounts of recording &quot;Blonde on Blonde&quot;, including those by Clinton Heylin and Michael Gray, agree that there were two blocks of recording sessions: February 14–17 and March 8–10, 1966. This chronology is based on the logs and files kept by Columbia Records.

Dylan and the Hawks performed concerts in Ottawa, Montreal, and Philadelphia in February and March, and then Dylan resumed recording in Nashville on March 8. On that date, Dylan and the musicians recorded the take of &quot;Absolutely Sweet Marie&quot; that Dylan selected for the album. Historian Sean Wilentz observed that &quot;with the sound of &#x27;Sweet Marie&#x27;, &quot;Blonde on Blonde&quot; entered fully and sublimely into what is now considered classic rock and roll&quot;. The same day saw the successful takes of &quot;Just Like a Woman&quot;, and &quot;Pledging My Time&quot;, the latter &quot;driven by Robertson&#x27;s screaming guitar&quot;.

According to Wilentz the final recording session, on March 9–10, produced six songs in 13 hours of studio time. The first number to be recorded to Dylan&#x27;s satisfaction was &quot;Most Likely You Go Your Way and I&#x27;ll Go Mine&quot;, when McCoy reinforced on trumpet a musical phrase Dylan played on his harmonica, changing the sound of the song radically. Dylan and his band then quickly recorded &quot;Temporary Like Achilles&quot;. The session atmosphere began to &quot;get giddy&quot; around midnight when Dylan roughed out &quot;Rainy Day Women #12 &amp; 35&quot; on the piano. Johnston recalled commenting; &quot;That sounds like the damn Salvation Army band&quot;. Dylan replied; &quot;Can you get one?&quot; Johnston then telephoned trombonist Wayne Butler, the only additional musician required, and Dylan and the band, with McCoy again on trumpet, played a high-spirited version of the song.

In quick succession Dylan and the musicians then recorded &quot;Obviously 5 Believers&quot; and a final take of &quot;Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat&quot; powered by Robertson&#x27;s lead guitar. The session concluded with &quot;I Want You&quot; on which, as Wilentz notes, &quot;Wayne Moss&#x27;s rapid-fire sixteenth notes on the guitar&quot; are an impressive element of the recording.

Al Kooper, who played keyboards on every track of &quot;Blonde on Blonde&quot;, has contested the conventional account that there were two blocks of recording sessions in Nashville. In comments on Michael Gray&#x27;s website, Kooper wrote: &quot;There was only ONE trip to Nashville for Robbie and I, and ALL THE TRACKS were cut in that one visit&quot;, stating that Dylan merely broke for an outstanding concert. Charlie McCoy agreed with Kooper&#x27;s version. Wilentz analyzed the recording of &quot;Blonde on Blonde&quot; in his book &quot;Bob Dylan in America&quot;, concluding that the &quot;official&quot; documented version fits Dylan&#x27;s known touring schedule, and notes that five of the eight songs first recorded after &quot;Stuck Inside of Mobile with the Memphis Blues Again&quot;, but none of those recorded earlier, include a middle-eight section—Dylan&#x27;s first extensive foray as a writer into that conventional structure&quot;.

===Mixing===
Dylan mixed the album in Los Angeles in early April, before he departed on the Australian leg of his 1966 world tour. Wilentz writes that it was at this point it became &quot;obvious that the riches of the Nashville sessions could not fit onto a single LP&quot;, and they had &quot;produced enough solid material to demand an oddly configured double album, the first of its kind in contemporary popular music&quot;. According to producer Steve Berkowitz, who supervised the reissue of Dylan&#x27;s LPs in mono as &quot;The Original Mono Recordings&quot; in 2010, Johnston told him that they carefully worked on the mono mix for about three or four days whereas the stereo mix was finished in about four hours.

==Songs==
===Side one===
====&quot;Rainy Day Women #12 &amp; 35&quot;====
According to author Andy Gill, by starting his new album with what sounded like &quot;a demented marching-band ... staffed by crazy people out of their mind on loco-weed&quot;, Dylan delivered his biggest shock yet for his former folkie fans. The elaborate puns on getting stoned combine a sense of paranoiac persecution with &quot;nudge-nudge wink-wink bohemian hedonism&quot;. Heylin points out that the Old Testament connotations of getting stoned made the Salvation Army-style musical backing seem like a good joke. The enigmatic title came about, Heylin suggests, because Dylan knew a song called &quot;Everybody Must Get Stoned&quot; would be kept off the airwaves. Heylin links the title to the Book of Proverbs, chapter 27, verse 15: &quot;A continual dropping in a very rainy day and a contentious woman are alike.&quot; Released as a single on March 22, 1966, &quot;Rainy Day Women&quot; reached number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; singles chart and number seven in the UK.

====&quot;Pledging My Time&quot;====
Following the good-time fun of &quot;Rainy Day Women #12 &amp; 35&quot;, the Chicago blues-influenced &quot;Pledging My Time&quot; sets the album&#x27;s somber tone. It draws on several traditional blues songs, including Elmore James&#x27;s recording of &quot;It Hurts Me Too&quot;. For critic Michael Gray, the lines &quot;Somebody got lucky but it was an accident&quot; echo the lines &quot;Some joker got lucky, stole her back again&quot; from Robert Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Come On in My Kitchen&quot;, which is itself an echo of Skip James&#x27;s 1931 recording &quot;Devil Got My Woman&quot;. Gray suggests that &quot;the gulping movements of the melodic phrases&quot; derive from the melody of &quot;Sitting on Top of the World&quot;, recorded by the Mississippi Sheiks in 1930. The couplet at the end of each verse expresses the theme: a pledge made to a prospective lover in hopes she &quot;will come through, too&quot;. Besides Dylan&#x27;s vocals and improvised harmonica breaks, the song&#x27;s sound is defined by Robbie Robertson&#x27;s guitar, Hargus &quot;Pig&quot; Robbins&#x27; blues piano and Ken Buttrey&#x27;s snare drum rolls. The song was released in edited form as the B-side of &quot;Rainy Day Women #12 &amp; 35&quot; in March.

====&quot;Visions of Johanna&quot;====
Considered by many critics one of Dylan&#x27;s masterpieces, &quot;Visions of Johanna&quot; proved difficult to capture on tape. Heylin places the writing in the fall of 1965, when Dylan was living in the Hotel Chelsea with his wife Sara. In the New York recording studio, on November 30, Dylan announced his epic composition: &quot;This is called &#x27;Freeze Out&#x27;.&quot; Gill notes that this working title captures the &quot;air of nocturnal suspension in which the verse tableaux are sketched ... full of whispering and muttering.&quot; Wilentz relates how Dylan guided his backing musicians through 14 takes, trying to sketch out how he wanted it played, saying at one point, &quot;it&#x27;s not hard rock, The only thing in it that&#x27;s &quot;hard&quot; is Robbie.&quot; Wilentz notes that, as Dylan quiets things down, he inches closer to what will appear on the album.

Ten weeks later, &quot;Visions of Johanna&quot; fell into place quickly in the Nashville studio. Kooper recalled that he and Robertson had become adept at responding to Dylan&#x27;s vocal and also singled out Joe South&#x27;s contribution of &quot;this throbbing ... rhythmically amazing bass part&quot;. Gill comments that the song begins by contrasting two lovers, the carnal Louise and &quot;the more spiritual but unattainable&quot; Johanna. Ultimately, for Gill, the song seeks to convey how the artist is compelled to keep striving to pursue some elusive vision of perfection. For Heylin, the triumph of the song is in &quot;the way Dylan manages to write about the most inchoate feelings in such a vivid, immediate way.&quot;

====&quot;One of Us Must Know (Sooner or Later)&quot;====
When Dylan arrived at the studio on January 25, 1966, he had yet to work out the lyrics and title for what was to become the closing track on &quot;Blonde on Blonde&quot;″s first side. With Dylan piecing together the song&#x27;s sections, and the chorus that gives the song its title only emerging on take five, the session stretched through the night and into the next morning. Only on the 15th take was a full version recorded. Dylan and the band persisted until they recorded take 24, which closed the session and made it onto the album four months later. Critic Jonathan Singer credits Griffin&#x27;s piano for binding the song together: &quot;At the chorus, Griffin unleashes a symphony; hammering his way up and down the keyboard, half Gershwin, half gospel, all heart. The follow-up, a killer left hand figure that links the chorus to the verse, releases none of the song&#x27;s tension.&quot;

&quot;One of Us Must Know&quot; is a straightforward account of a burned-out relationship. Dissecting what went wrong, the narrator takes a defensive attitude in a one-sided conversation with his former lover. As he presents his case in the opening verse, it appears he is incapable of acknowledging his part or limiting the abuse: &quot;I didn&#x27;t mean to treat you so bad. You don&#x27;t have to take it so personal. I didn&#x27;t mean to make you so sad. You just happened to be there, that&#x27;s all.&quot; &quot;One of Us Must Know&quot; was the first recording completed for &quot;Blonde on Blonde&quot; and the only one selected from the New York sessions. The song was released as the first single from the album on February 14, the same day Dylan began to record in Nashville. It failed to appear on the American charts, but reached number 33 in the UK.

===Side two===
====&quot;I Want You&quot;====
Andy Gill notes that the song displays a tension between the very direct tone of the chorus, the repeated phrase &quot;I want you&quot;, and a weird and complex cast of characters, &quot;too numerous to inhabit the song&#x27;s three minutes comfortably&quot;, including a guilty undertaker, a lonesome organ grinder, weeping fathers, mothers, sleeping saviors, the Queen of Spades, and the &quot;dancing child with his Chinese suit&quot;. Analyzing the lyrics&#x27; evolution through successive drafts, Wilentz writes that there are numerous failures, &quot;about deputies asking him his name ... lines about fathers going down hugging one another and about their daughters putting him down because he isn&#x27;t their brother&quot;. Finally Dylan arrives at the right formula.

Heylin points out that the &quot;gorgeous&quot; tune illustrates what Dylan explained to a reporter in 1966: &quot;It&#x27;s not just pretty words to a tune or putting tunes to words ... [It&#x27;s] the words and the music [together]—I can hear the sound of what I want to say.&quot; Al Kooper has said that of all the songs that Dylan outlined to him in his hotel, this was his favorite, so Dylan delayed recording it to the very end of the Nashville sessions, &quot;just to bug him&quot;. Released as a single on June 10, 1966, shortly before the album, &quot;I Want You&quot; reached number 20 in the US and number 16 in the UK.

====&quot;Stuck Inside of Mobile with the Memphis Blues Again&quot;====
Recorded at the third Nashville session, this song was the culmination of another epic of simultaneous writing and recording in the studio. Heylin calls this song &#x27;a masterpiece of the first order&#x27;. Wilentz describes how the lyrics evolved through a surviving part-typed, part-handwritten manuscript page, &quot;which begins &#x27;honey but it&#x27;s just too hard&#x27; (a line that had survived from the very first New York session with the Hawks). Then the words meander through random combinations and disconnected fragments and images (&#x27;people just get uglier&#x27;; &#x27;banjo eyes&#x27;; &#x27;he was carrying a 22 but it was only a single shot&#x27;), before, in Dylan&#x27;s own hand, amid many crossings-out, there appears &#x27;Oh MAMA you&#x27;re here IN MOBILE ALABAMA with the Memphis blues again&#x27;.&quot;

Inside the studio, the song evolved through several musical revisions. Heylin writes, &quot;It is the song&#x27;s arrangement, and not its lyrics, that occupies the musicians through the wee small hours.&quot; On the fifth take, released in 2005 on the &quot;No Direction Home Soundtrack&quot;, midtake Dylan stumbles on the formula &quot;Stuck &quot;inside of&quot; Mobile&quot; on the fourth verse, and never goes back. The song contains two oft-quoted pieces of Dylan&#x27;s philosophy: &quot;Your debutante just knows what you need/ But I know what you want&quot; and &quot;here I sit so patiently/ Waiting to find out what price/ You have to pay to get out of/ Going through all these things twice&quot;.

====&quot;Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat&quot;====
&quot;Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat&quot; is a satire of materialism, fashion and faddism. Done in Chicago-blues style, the song derives its melody and part of its lyrics from Lightnin&#x27; Hopkins&#x27;s &quot;Automobile (Blues)&quot;. Paul Williams writes that its caustic attitude is &quot;moderated slightly when one realizes that jealous pique is the underlying emotion&quot;. The narrator observes his former lover in various situations wearing her &quot;brand new leopard-skin pill-box hat&quot;, at one point finding his doctor with her and later spying her making love with a new boyfriend because she &quot;forgot to close the garage door&quot;. In the closing lines, the narrator says he knows what her boyfriend really loves her for—her hat.

The song evolved over the course of six takes in New York, 13 in the first Nashville session, and then one on March 10, the take used for the album. Dylan, who gets credit on the liner notes as lead guitarist, opens the song playing lead (on the center-right stereo channel), but Robertson handles the solos with a &quot;searing&quot; performance (on the left stereo channel). A year after the recording, &quot;Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat&quot; became the fifth single released from &quot;Blonde on Blonde&quot;, making it to number 81 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

====&quot;Just Like a Woman&quot;====
According to Wilentz&#x27;s analysis of the session&#x27;s tapes, Dylan felt his way into the lyrics of one of his most popular songs, singing &quot;disconnected lines and semi-gibberish&quot; during the earlier takes. He was unsure what the person described in the song does that is just like a woman, rejecting &quot;shakes&quot;, &quot;wakes&quot;, and &quot;makes mistakes&quot;. This exploration of female wiles and feminine vulnerability was widely rumored—&quot;not least by her acquaintances among Andy Warhol&#x27;s Factory retinue&quot;—to be about Edie Sedgwick. The reference to Baby&#x27;s penchant for &quot;fog ... amphetamine and ... pearls&quot; suggests Sedgwick or a similar debutante, according to Heylin.

Discussing the lyrics, literary critic Christopher Ricks detects a &quot;note of social exclusion&quot; in the line &quot;I was hungry and it was your world&quot;. In response to the accusation that Dylan&#x27;s depiction of female strategies is misogynistic, Ricks asks, &quot;Could there ever be any challenging art about men and women where the accusation just didn&#x27;t arise?&quot; The song reached number 33 in the US.

===Side three===
====&quot;Most Likely You Go Your Way and I&#x27;ll Go Mine&quot;====
A bright blues &quot;stomper&quot; about lovers parting, &quot;Most Likely You Go Your Way And I&#x27;ll Go Mine&quot; is one of the more literal songs Dylan recorded in 1965–66. The narrator has tired of carrying his lover and is going to let her &quot;pass&quot;. As in &quot;Just Like a Woman&quot; and &quot;Absolutely Sweet Marie&quot;, he waits until the end of each verse to deliver the punch line, which in this case comes from the title. &quot;Most Likely You Go Your Way&quot; was issued as a single a year later, in March 1967, on the B-side of &quot;Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat&quot;.

====&quot;Temporary Like Achilles&quot;====
This slow-moving blues number is highlighted by Hargus &quot;Pig&quot; Robbins&#x27;s &quot;dusky barrelhouse piano&quot; and Dylan&#x27;s &quot;brief wheeze of harmonica&quot;. The narrator has been spurned by his lover, who has already taken up with her latest boyfriend. Calling his rival &quot;Achilles&quot;, the narrator senses the new suitor may be discarded as quickly as he was. The refrain that ends each of the main verses—&quot;Honey, why are you so hard?&quot;—is a double entendre Dylan had been wanting to work into a song.

====&quot;Absolutely Sweet Marie&quot;====
This song, described as &quot;up-tempo blues shuffle, pure Memphis&quot; and an example of &quot;obvious pop sensibility and compulsive melody&quot;, was recorded in four takes on March 7, 1966. Gill sees the lyrics as a series of sexual metaphors, including &quot;beating on my trumpet&quot; and keys to locked gates, many deriving from traditional blues. Nonetheless, the song contains what has been termed &quot;one of the most oft-repeated of Dylan&#x27;s life lessons&quot;, that &quot;to live outside the law you must be honest&quot;, which was later invoked in many bohemian and countercultural contexts.

====&quot;4th Time Around&quot;====
When the Beatles released their sixth studio album, &quot;Rubber Soul&quot;, in December 1965, John Lennon&#x27;s song &quot;Norwegian Wood&quot; attracted attention for the way Lennon disguised his account of an illicit affair in cryptic, Dylanesque language. Dylan sketched out a response to the song, also in 3/4 time, copying the tune and circular structure, but taking Lennon&#x27;s tale in a darker direction. Wilentz describes the result as sounding &quot;like Bob Dylan impersonating John Lennon impersonating Bob Dylan&quot;.

====&quot;Obviously 5 Believers&quot;====
&quot;Obviously 5 Believers&quot;, &quot;Blonde on Blonde&quot;″s second-to-last track, is a roadhouse blues love song similar in melody and structure to Memphis Minnie&#x27;s &quot;Chauffeur Blues&quot;, and was described by Robert Shelton as &quot;the best R&amp;B song on the album&quot;. Recorded in the early morning hours of the March 9–10 Nashville session under the working title &quot;Black Dog Blues&quot;, the song is driven by Robertson&#x27;s guitar, Charlie McCoy&#x27;s harmonica and Ken Buttrey&#x27;s drumming. After an initial breakdown, Dylan complained to the band that the song was &quot;very easy, man&quot; and that he did not want to spend much time on it. Within four takes, the recording was done.

===Side four===
====&quot;Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands&quot;====
Written in the CBS recording studio in Nashville over the space of eight hours on the night of February 15–16, &quot;Sad Eyed Lady&quot; eventually occupied all of side four of &quot;Blonde On Blonde&quot;. Critics have observed that &quot;Lowlands&quot; hints at &quot;Lownds&quot;, and Dylan biographer Robert Shelton wrote that this was a &quot;wedding song&quot; for Sara Lownds, whom Dylan had married just three months earlier. In his paean to his wife, &quot;Sara&quot;, written in 1975, Dylan sings that he stayed &quot;up for days in the Chelsea Hotel/Writin&#x27; &#x27;Sad-Eyed Lady of the Lowlands&#x27; for you&quot;.

When Dylan played Shelton the song, shortly after recording it, he claimed, &quot;This is the best song I&#x27;ve ever written.&quot; Around the same time, Dylan enthused to journalist Jules Siegel, &quot;Just listen to that! That&#x27;s old-time religious carnival music!&quot; But in 1969, Dylan told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; editor Jann Wenner, &quot;I just sat down at a table and started writing ... And I just got carried away with the whole thing ... I just started writing and I couldn&#x27;t stop. After a period of time, I forgot what it was all about, and I started trying to get back to the beginning [&quot;laughs&quot;].&quot;

Heard by some listeners as a hymn to an otherworldly woman, for Shelton &quot;her travails seem beyond endurance, yet she radiates an inner strength, an ability to be reborn. This is Dylan at his most romantic.&quot; Wilentz comments that Dylan&#x27;s writing had shifted from the days when he asked questions and supplied answers. Like the verses of William Blake&#x27;s &quot;The Tyger&quot;, Dylan asks a series of questions about the &quot;Sad Eyed Lady&quot; but never supplies any answers.

===Outtakes and &quot;The Cutting Edge&quot;===
The following outtakes were recorded during the &quot;Blonde on Blonde&quot; sessions.
In 2015, Dylan released Volume 12 of his Bootleg Series, &quot;The Cutting Edge&quot;, in three different formats. The 18-disc &quot;Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot; was described as including &quot;every note recorded during the 1965–1966 sessions, every alternate take and alternate lyric.&quot; The 18 CDs contain every take of every song recorded in the studio during the &quot;Blonde on Blonde&quot; sessions, from October 5, 1965, to March 10, 1966.

The New York sessions comprise: two takes of &quot;Medicine Sunday&quot;, one take of &quot;Jet Pilot&quot;, twelve takes of &quot;Can You Please Crawl Out Your Window?&quot;, seven takes of &quot;I Wanna Be Your Lover&quot;, fourteen takes of &quot;Visions of Johanna&quot;, sixteen takes of &quot;She&#x27;s Your Lover Now&quot;, four takes of &quot;Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat&quot;, twenty-four takes of &quot;One of Us Must Know (Sooner or Later)&quot;, one take of &quot;I&#x27;ll Keep It with Mine&quot;, and one take of &quot;Lunatic Princess&quot;.

The Nashville sessions comprise 20 takes of &quot;Fourth Time Around&quot;, four of &quot;Visions of Johanna&quot;, 14 of &quot;Leopard-Skin Pill-Box Hat&quot;, four of &quot;Sad-Eyed Lady of the Lowlands&quot;, 15 of &quot;Stuck Inside of Mobile with the Memphis Blues Again&quot;, three of &quot;Absolutely Sweet Marie&quot;, 18 of &quot;Just Like a Woman&quot;, three of &quot;Pledging My Time&quot;, six of &quot;Most Likely You Go Your Way (And I&#x27;ll Go Mine)&quot;, four of &quot;Temporary Like Achilles&quot;, four of &quot;Obviously Five Believers&quot;, five of &quot;I Want You&quot;, and one of &quot;Rainy Day Women #12 &amp; 35&quot;. The 18 CDs also contain brief recordings of guitar and keyboard inserts.

Describing the process of listening to all these alternative versions, Neil McCormick wrote: &quot;&quot;The Cutting Edge&quot; allows fans to bear witness to perhaps the most astonishing explosion of language and sound in rock history, a new approach to song being forged before our very ears.&quot;

==Packaging==
===Origin of album title===
Al Kooper recalled that both the album title, &quot;Blonde on Blonde&quot;, and song titles arrived during the mixing sessions. &quot;When they were mixing it, we were sitting around and Bob Johnston came in and said, &#x27;What do you want to call this?&#x27; And [Bob] just like said them out one at a time ... Free association and silliness, I&#x27;m sure, played a big role.&quot; Dylan himself has said of the title: &quot;Well, I don&#x27;t even recall exactly how it came up, but I know it was all in good faith ... I don&#x27;t know who thought of that. I certainly didn&#x27;t.&quot;

Several explanations have been put forward in an attempt to shed light on the identity or meaning of the blondes superimposed in the title. Two of these explanations are contemporary with the album and lead to personalities in Dylan&#x27;s entourage at the time. To Edie Sedgwick, firstly, a short-lived celebrity in the New York underground in the mid-1960s, with blond hair and a pale complexion. Then to Brian Jones and the blond couple that the founder of the Rolling Stones formed with the actress Anita Pallenberg.

Since the publication of Dylan&#x27;s autobiographical &quot;&quot; in 2004, another hypothesis has taken shape: that &quot;Blonde on Blonde&quot; is a tribute to &quot;Brecht on Brecht&quot;, a musical performance of Bertolt Brecht&#x27;s songs which Dylan attended in 1963 and which had a profound effect on him. In addition to this analogy, it has become classic to point out that the initials of the title reproduce Dylan&#x27;s first name, as a wink. Oliver Trager, for instance, in 2004: &quot;Its title is at least a riff on &quot;Brecht on Brecht&quot;, a rather literary touch for rock ’n’ roll at the time. And let&#x27;s not forget that the first letter of each word in the title form an anagram that spells the word &#x27;Bob&#x27;.&quot;

In 2012, another theory was espoused in David Dalton&#x27;s book &quot;Who Is That Man? In Search of the Real Bob Dylan&quot;. Dalton writes that &quot;the title of the album itself is a double entendre that refers to a rock star&#x27;s endless harem as well as to Kazimir Malevich&#x27;s constructivist painting &quot;White Square on White&quot;. Avant-garde art sandwiched between serial blondes&quot; (the painting is actually titled &quot;Suprematist Composition: White on White&quot;).

A new interpretation appeared in a French essay published in 2021. According to &quot;Like a Rolling Stone Revisited : Une relecture de Dylan&quot; [A Re-Reading of Dylan] by Jean-Michel Buizard, the title refers to two guitars that together form the musical heart of the album, two light wood and beige guitars, &quot;blonde&quot; in English usage – like the Gibson Nick Lucas Special and the Fender acoustic that Robertson and Dylan play face to face in a 1966 scene from the documentary &quot;Eat the Document&quot;: &quot;two guitars of the same colour playing with each other, melodic line on rhythmic line, blonde on blonde.&quot; This interpretation is essentially based on two ideas drawn from Dylan&#x27;s lyrics. On the one hand, the understanding that, in his most important and enigmatic songs of the 1965–1966 period, Dylan never stops talking about his music and, with it, about his place in the history of the blues. On the other hand, the discovery that a whole troupe of famous bluesmen, modern or old, parade through these same songs, each of them accompanied by his guitar disguised in a personified or metaphorical form.

=== Cover photo ===
The cover photo of &quot;Blonde on Blonde&quot; shows a 12-by-12-inch close-up portrait of Dylan. The double album gatefold sleeve opens to form a 12-by-26-inch photo of the artist, at three quarter length. The artist&#x27;s name and the album&#x27;s title only appear on the spine. A sticker was applied to the shrink wrap to promote the release&#x27;s two hit singles, &quot;I Want You&quot; and &quot;Rainy Day Women #12 &amp; 35&quot;.

The cover shows Dylan in front of a brick building, wearing a suede jacket and a black and white checkered scarf. The jacket is the same one he wore on his next two albums, &quot;John Wesley Harding&quot; and &quot;Nashville Skyline&quot;. The photographer, Jerry Schatzberg, described how the photo was taken:
Research by rock historian Bob Egan suggests the location of the cover photo was at 375 West Street, at the extreme west of Greenwich Village. The original inside gatefold featured nine black-and-white photos, all taken by Schatzberg and selected for the sleeve by Dylan himself. A shot of actress Claudia Cardinale from Schatzberg&#x27;s portfolio was included but later withdrawn because it had been used without her authorization and Cardinale&#x27;s representatives threatened to sue, making the original record sleeves a collector&#x27;s item. Dylan included a self-portrait by Schatzberg as a credit to the photographer. The photos, for Gill, added up to &quot;a shadowy glimpse of [Dylan&#x27;s] life, including an enigmatic posed shot of Dylan holding a small portrait of a woman in one hand and a pair of pliers in the other: they all contributed to the album&#x27;s air of reclusive yet sybaritic genius.&quot;

==Release and reception==
&quot;Blonde on Blonde&quot; reached the Top 10 in both the US and UK album charts, and also spawned a number of hits that restored Dylan to the upper echelons of the singles charts. In August 1967, the album was certified as a gold disc.

A high-definition 5.1 surround sound edition of the album was released on SACD by Columbia in 2003.

The album received generally favorable reviews. Pete Johnson in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Dylan is a superbly eloquent writer of pop and folk songs with an unmatched ability to press complex ideas and iconoclastic philosophy into brief poetic lines and startling images.&quot; The editor of &quot;Crawdaddy!&quot;, Paul Williams, reviewed &quot;Blonde on Blonde&quot; in July 1966: &quot;It is a cache of emotion, a well handled package of excellent music and better poetry, blended and meshed and ready to become part of your reality. Here is a man who will speak to you, a 1960s bard with electric lyre and color slides, but a truthful man with x-ray eyes you can look through if you want. All you have to do is listen.&quot;

To accompany the songbook of &quot;Blonde on Blonde&quot;, Paul Nelson wrote an introduction stating, &quot;The very title suggests the singularity and the duality we expect from Dylan. For Dylan&#x27;s music of illusion and delusion—with the tramp as explorer and the clown as happy victim, where the greatest crimes are lifelessness and the inability to see oneself as a circus performer in the show of life—has always carried within it its own inherent tensions ... Dylan in the end truly UNDERSTANDS situations, and once one truly understands anything, there can no longer be anger, no longer be moralizing, but only humor and compassion, only pity.&quot; In May 1968 for &quot;Esquire&quot;, Robert Christgau said Dylan had &quot;presented his work at its most involuted, neurotic, and pop—and exhilarating—in &quot;Blonde on Blonde&quot;.&quot;

===Date discrepancy===
&quot;Blonde on Blonde&quot; was released on June 20, 1966, but for many years, May 16 was thought to be the correct date. Michael Gray, author of &quot;The Bob Dylan Encyclopedia&quot;, had contended that the release date was actually around late June or early July. This coincides with the album&#x27;s promotion in &quot;Billboard&quot;, which carried a full-page Columbia advertisement on June 25, selected the album as a &quot;New Action LP&quot; on July 9, and ran a review and article on July 16. In 2017, after viewing a Sony database of album releases, Heylin found that the release date was in fact June 20. This is supported by the fact that an overdub on &quot;Fourth Time Around&quot; was recorded in June.

The album debuted on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top LPs chart on July 23 at number 101—just six days before Dylan&#x27;s motorcycle accident in Woodstock removed him from public view. By contrast, another contemporary LP which has an official 1966 release date of May 16, &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; by the Beach Boys, entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; LP chart less than two weeks after release on May 28 at number 105.

&quot;Blonde on Blonde&quot; has been described as rock&#x27;s first studio double LP by a major artist, released just one week before &quot;Freak Out!&quot;, the double album by the Mothers of Invention.

==Reappraisal and legacy==
Twelve years after its release, Dylan said: &quot;The closest I ever got to the sound I hear in my mind was on individual bands in the &quot;Blonde on Blonde&quot; album. It&#x27;s that thin, that wild mercury sound. It&#x27;s metallic and bright gold, with whatever that conjures up.&quot; For critics, the double album was seen as the last installment in Dylan&#x27;s trilogy of mid-1960s rock albums. As Janet Maslin wrote, &quot;The three albums of this period—&quot;Bringing It All Back Home&quot; and &quot;Highway 61 Revisited&quot; both released in 1965, and &quot;Blonde on Blonde&quot; from 1966—used their electric instrumentation and rock arrangements to achieve a crashing exuberance Dylan hadn&#x27;t approached before.&quot; Mike Marqusee has described Dylan&#x27;s output between late 1964 and the summer of 1966, when he recorded these three albums, as &quot;a body of work that remains unique in popular music.&quot; For Patrick Humphries, &quot;Dylan&#x27;s body of work during the 14-months period ... stands unequalled in rock&#x27;s 30-year history. In substance, style, ambition and achievement, no one has even come close to matching &quot;Bringing It All Back Home&quot;, &quot;Highway 61 Revisited&quot; and &quot;Blonde on Blonde&quot;.&quot; Music journalist Gary Graff points to &quot;Highway 61 Revisited&quot; and &quot;Blonde on Blonde&quot;, along with the Beach Boys&#x27; &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; (1966), as possible starting points to the album era, as they each constituted &quot;a cohesive and conceptual body of work rather than just some hit singles ... with filler tracks.&quot;

Dylan scholar Michael Gray wrote: &quot;To have followed up one masterpiece with another was Dylan&#x27;s history making achievement here ... Where &quot;Highway 61 Revisited&quot; has Dylan exposing and confronting like a laser beam in surgery, descending from outside the sickness, &quot;Blonde on Blonde&quot; offers a persona awash inside the chaos ... We&#x27;re tossed from song to song ... The feel and the music are on a grand scale, and the language and delivery are a unique mixture of the visionary and the colloquial.&quot; Critic Tim Riley wrote: &quot;A sprawling abstraction of eccentric blues revisionism, &quot;Blonde on Blonde&quot; confirms Dylan&#x27;s stature as the greatest American rock presence since Elvis Presley.&quot; Biographer Robert Shelton saw the album as &quot;a hallmark collection that completes his first major rock cycle, which began with &quot;Bringing It All Back Home&quot;&quot;. Summing up the album&#x27;s achievement, Shelton wrote that &quot;Blonde on Blonde&quot; &quot;begins with a joke and ends with a hymn; in between wit alternates with a dominant theme of entrapment by circumstances, love, society, and unrealized hope ... There&#x27;s a remarkable marriage of funky, bluesy rock expressionism, and Rimbaud-like visions of discontinuity, chaos, emptiness, loss, being &#x27;stuck&#x27;.&quot;

That sense of crossing cultural boundaries was, for Al Kooper, at the heart of &quot;Blonde on Blonde&quot;: &quot;[Bob Dylan] was the quintessential New York hipster—what was &quot;he&quot; doing in Nashville? It didn&#x27;t make any sense whatsoever. But you take those two elements, pour them into a test tube, and it just exploded.&quot; For Mike Marqusee, Dylan had succeeded in combining traditional blues material with modernist literary techniques: &quot;[Dylan] took inherited idioms and boosted them into a modernist stratosphere. &#x27;Pledging My Time&#x27; and &#x27;Obviously 5 Believers&#x27; adhered to blues patterns that were venerable when Dylan first encountered them in the mid-fifties (both begin with the ritual Delta invocation of &quot;early in the mornin&quot;). Yet like &#x27;Visions of Johanna&#x27; or &#x27;Memphis Blues Again&#x27;, these songs are beyond category. They are allusive, repetitive, jaggedly abstract compositions that defy reduction.&quot;

&quot;Blonde on Blonde&quot; has been ranked high in critics&#x27; polls of the greatest albums of all time. In 1974, the writers of &quot;NME&quot; voted &quot;Blonde on Blonde&quot; the number-two album of all time. It was ranked second in the 1978 book &quot;Critic&#x27;s Choice: Top 200 Albums&quot; and third in the 1987 edition. In 1997 the album was placed at number 16 in a &quot;Music of the Millennium&quot; poll conducted by HMV, Channel 4, &quot;The Guardian&quot; and Classic FM. In 2006, &quot;Time&quot; magazine included the record on their 100 All-Time Albums list. In 2003, the album was ranked number nine on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;, maintaining the rating in a 2012 revised list, while dropping to number 38 in 2020. In 2004, two songs from the album also appeared on the magazine&#x27;s list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot;: &quot;Just Like a Woman&quot; ranked number 230 and &quot;Visions of Johanna&quot; number 404. (When &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; updated this list in 2010, &quot;Just Like a Woman&quot; dropped to number 232 and &quot;Visions of Johanna&quot; to number 413. Then in 2021, &quot;Visions of Johanna&quot; was re-ranked at number 317.) The album was included in Robert Christgau&#x27;s &quot;Basic Record Library&quot; of 1950s and 1960s recordings—published in &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981)—and in critic Robert Dimery&#x27;s book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. It was voted number 33 in the third edition of Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot; (2000). It was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1999. When Dylan was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2016, Swedish Academy Secretary Sara Danius, when asked how to evaluate Dylan&#x27;s literary merit, suggested listening first to &quot;Blonde on Blonde&quot;.

<text>Bringing It All Back Home (known as Subterranean Homesick Blues in some European countries; sometimes also spelled Bringin&#x27; It All Back Home) is the fifth studio album by the American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan, released in April1965 by Columbia Records. In a major transition from his earlier sound, it was Dylan&#x27;s first album to incorporate electric instrumentation, which caused controversy and divided many in the contemporary folk scene.

The album is split into two distinct halves; the first half of the album features electric instrumentation, in which on side one of the original LP, Dylan is backed by an electric rock and roll band. The second half features mainly acoustic songs. The album abandons the protest music of Dylan&#x27;s previous records in favor of more surreal, complex lyrics.

The album reached No. 6 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Pop Albums chart, the first of Dylan&#x27;s LPs to break into the US Top 10. It also topped the UK charts later that spring. The first track, &quot;Subterranean Homesick Blues&quot;, became Dylan&#x27;s first single to chart in the US, peaking at No. 39. &quot;Bringing It All Back Home&quot; has been described as one of the greatest albums of all time by multiple publications. In 2003, it was ranked number 31 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s list of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;, later repositioned to number 181 in the 2020 edition.

== Recording ==
Dylan spent much of the summer of 1964 in Woodstock, a small town in upstate New York where his manager, Albert Grossman, had a place. When Joan Baez went to see Dylan that August, they stayed at Grossman&#x27;s house. Baez recalls that &quot;most of the month or so we were there, Bob stood at the typewriter in the corner of his room, drinking red wine and smoking and tapping away relentlessly for hours. And in the dead of night, he would wake up, grunt, grab a cigarette, and stumble over to the typewriter again.&quot; Dylan already had one song ready for his next album: &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot; was written in February 1964 but omitted from &quot;Another Side of Bob Dylan&quot;. Another song, &quot;Gates of Eden&quot;, was also written earlier that year, appearing in the original manuscripts to &quot;Another Side of Bob Dylan&quot;; a few lyrical changes were eventually made, but it&#x27;s unclear if these were made that August in Woodstock. At least two songs were written that month: &quot;If You Gotta Go, Go Now&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s Alright Ma (I&#x27;m Only Bleeding)&quot;. During this time, Dylan&#x27;s lyrics became increasingly surreal, and his prose grew more stylistic, often resembling stream-of-consciousness writing with published letters dating from 1964 becoming increasingly intense and dreamlike as the year wore on.

Dylan returned to the city, and on August 28, he met the Beatles for the first time in their New York hotel. In retrospect, this meeting with the Beatles would prove to be influential to the direction of Dylan&#x27;s music, as he would soon record music invoking a rock sound for at least the next three albums. Dylan would remain on good terms with the Beatles, and as biographer Clinton Heylin writes, &quot;the evening established a personal dimension to the very real rivalry that would endure for the remainder of a momentous decade.&quot;

Dylan and producer Tom Wilson were soon experimenting with their own fusion of rock and folk music. The first unsuccessful test involved overdubbing a &quot;Fats Domino early rock &amp; roll thing&quot; over Dylan&#x27;s earlier, acoustic recording of &quot;House of the Rising Sun&quot;, according to Wilson. This took place in the Columbia 30th Street Studio in December 1964. It was quickly discarded, though Wilson would more famously use the same technique of overdubbing an electric backing track to an existing acoustic recording with Simon &amp; Garfunkel&#x27;s &quot;The Sound of Silence&quot;. In the meantime, Dylan turned his attention to another folk-rock experiment conducted by John P. Hammond, an old friend and musician whose father, John H. Hammond, originally signed Dylan to Columbia. Hammond was planning an electric album around the blues songs that framed his acoustic live performances of the time. To do this, he recruited three members of an American/Canadian bar band he met sometime in 1963: guitarist Robbie Robertson, drummer Levon Helm, and organist Garth Hudson (members of the Hawks, who would go on to become the Band). Dylan was very aware of the resulting album, &quot;So Many Roads&quot;; according to his friend, Danny Kalb, &quot;Bob was really excited about what John Hammond was doing with electric blues. I talked to him in the Figaro in 1964 and he was telling me about John and his going to Chicago and playing with a band and so on …&quot;

However, when Dylan and Wilson began work on the next album, they temporarily refrained from their own electric experimentation. The first session, held on January 13, 1965, in Columbia&#x27;s Studio A in New York, was recorded solo, with Dylan playing piano or acoustic guitar. Ten complete songs and several song sketches were produced, nearly all of which were discarded. Take one of &quot;Bob Dylan&#x27;s 115th Dream&quot; would be used for the album, but three would eventually be released: &quot;I&#x27;ll Keep It With Mine&quot; on 1985&#x27;s &quot;Biograph&quot;, and &quot;Farewell Angelina&quot; and an acoustic version of &quot;Subterranean Homesick Blues&quot; on 1991&#x27;s &quot;The Bootleg Series Volumes 1–3 (Rare &amp; Unreleased) 1961–1991&quot;.

Other songs and sketches recorded at this session: &quot;Love Minus Zero/No Limit&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s All Over Now, Baby Blue&quot;, &quot;She Belongs to Me&quot;, &quot;On the Road Again&quot;, &quot;If You Gotta Go, Go Now&quot;, &quot;You Don&#x27;t Have to Do That&quot;, &quot;California,&quot; and &quot;Outlaw Blues&quot;, all of which were original compositions.

Dylan and Wilson held another session at Studio A the following day, this time with a full, electric band. Guitarists Al Gorgoni, Kenny Rankin, and Bruce Langhorne were recruited, as were pianist Paul Griffin, bassists Joseph Macho Jr. and William E. Lee, and drummer Bobby Gregg. The day&#x27;s work focused on eight songs, all of which had been attempted the previous day. According to Langhorne, there was no rehearsal, &quot;we just did first takes and I remember that, for what it was, it was amazingly intuitive and successful.&quot; Few takes were required of each song, and after three and a half hours of recording (lasting from 2:30 pm to 6:00 pm), master takes of &quot;Love Minus Zero/No Limit&quot;, &quot;Subterranean Homesick Blues&quot;, &quot;Outlaw Blues&quot;, &quot;She Belongs to Me&quot;, and &quot;Bob Dylan&#x27;s 115th Dream&quot; were all recorded and selected for the final album.

Sometime after dinner, Dylan reportedly continued recording with a different set of musicians, including John P. Hammond and John Sebastian (only Langhorne returned from earlier that day). They recorded six songs, but the results were deemed unsatisfactory and ultimately rejected.

Another session was held at Studio A the next day, and it would be the last one needed. Once again, Dylan kept at his disposal the musicians from the previous day (that is, those that participated in the 2:30 pm to 6:00 pm session); the one exception was pianist Paul Griffin, who was unable to attend and replaced by Frank Owens. Daniel Kramer recalls: 

The session began with &quot;Maggie&#x27;s Farm&quot;: only one take was recorded, and it was the only one they&#x27;d ever need. From there, Dylan successfully recorded master takes of &quot;On the Road Again&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s Alright, Ma (I&#x27;m Only Bleeding)&quot;, &quot;Gates of Eden&quot;, &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot;, and &quot;It&#x27;s All Over Now, Baby Blue&quot;, all of which were set aside for the album. A master take of &quot;If You Gotta Go, Go Now&quot; was also selected, but it would not be included on the album; instead, it was issued as a single-only release in Europe, but not in the US or the UK.

Though Dylan was able to record electric versions of virtually every song included on the final album, he apparently never intended &quot;Bringing It All Back Home&quot; to be completely electric. As a result, roughly half of the finished album would feature full electric band arrangements while the other half consisted of solo acoustic performances, sometimes accompanied by Langhorne, who would embellish Dylan&#x27;s acoustic performance with a countermelody on his electric guitar.

== Songs ==

=== Overview ===
&quot;Bringing It All Back Home&quot; consists mainly of blues and folk and, as a result of Dylan&#x27;s adoption of a more electric sound, is considered to have been instrumental in the birth of folk rock. On his following albums, &quot;Highway 61 Revisited&quot; and &quot;Blonde on Blonde&quot;, he would further develop the genre, influencing American folk acts such as Buffalo Springfield and Simon and Garfunkel as well as British Invasion bands like the Beatles and the Rolling Stones to innovate, producing more introspective lyrics and allowing the latter two groups to expand out of the confines of their pop rock roots. According to Pete Townshend of the Who, Dylan&#x27;s folk attitude also influenced the writing of one of their most successful songs, the 1965 single &quot;My Generation&quot;. In the Beatles&#x27; case, the results of this innovation, namely the albums &quot;Help!&quot; and &quot;Rubber Soul,&quot; would help push folk rock into the mainstream&quot;.&quot;

=== Side one ===

==== &quot;Subterranean Homesick Blues&quot; ====
The album opens with &quot;Subterranean Homesick Blues&quot;, heavily inspired by Chuck Berry&#x27;s &quot;Too Much Monkey Business&quot;. &quot;Subterranean Homesick Blues&quot; became a Top 40 hit for Dylan. &quot;Snagged by a sour, pinched guitar riff, the song has an acerbic tinge … and Dylan sings the title rejoinders in mock self-pity,&quot; writes music critic Tim Riley. &quot;It&#x27;s less an indictment of the system than a coil of imagery that spells out how the system hangs itself with the rope it&#x27;s so proud of.&quot;

==== &quot;She Belongs to Me&quot; ====
&quot;She Belongs to Me&quot; extols the bohemian virtues of an artistic lover whose creativity must be constantly fed (&quot;Bow down to her on Sunday / Salute her when her birthday comes. / For Halloween buy her a trumpet / And for Christmas, give her a drum.&quot;)

==== &quot;Maggie&#x27;s Farm&quot; ====
&quot;Maggie&#x27;s Farm&quot; contains themes of social, economic and political criticism, with lines such as &quot;Well I try my best to be just like I am/But everybody wants you to be just like them&quot; and &quot;Well, I wake up in the morning, fold my hands and pray for rain/I got a head full of ideas that are drivin&#x27; me insane&quot;. It follows a straightforward blues structure, with the opening line of each verse (&quot;I ain&#x27;t gonna work...&quot;) sung twice, then repeated at the end of the verse. The third to fifth lines of each verse elaborate on and explain the sentiment expressed in the verse&#x27;s opening/closing lines. It references working for Maggie, her father, her mother, and her brother on a farm.

==== &quot;Love Minus Zero/No Limit&quot; ====
&quot;Love Minus Zero/No Limit&quot; is a love song. Its main musical hook is a series of three descending chords, while its lyrics articulate Dylan&#x27;s feelings for his lover, and have been interpreted as describing how she brings a needed zen-like calm to his chaotic world. The song uses surreal imagery, which some authors and critics have suggested recalls Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s &quot;The Raven&quot; and the biblical Book of Daniel. Critics have also remarked that the style of the lyrics is reminiscent of William Blake&#x27;s poem &quot;The Sick Rose&quot;.

==== &quot;Outlaw Blues&quot; ====
&quot;Outlaw Blues&quot; is an electric blues song that lyrically follows a fugitive traveling through harsh conditions (&quot;Ain&#x27;t it hard to stumble and land in some muddy lagoon?/Especially when it&#x27;s nine below zero and three o&#x27;clock in the afternoon&quot;) as he resents the life of being on the run.

==== &quot;On the Road Again&quot; ====
&quot;On the Road Again&quot; catalogs the absurd affectations and degenerate living conditions of bohemia. The song concludes: &quot;Then you ask why I don&#x27;t live here / Honey, how come you don&#x27;t move?&quot;

==== &quot;Bob Dylan&#x27;s 115th Dream&quot; ====
&quot;Bob Dylan&#x27;s 115th Dream&quot; narrates a surreal experience involving the discovery of America, &quot;Captain Arab&quot; (a clear reference to Captain Ahab of &quot;Moby Dick&quot;), and numerous bizarre encounters. It is the longest song in the electric section of the album, starting out as an acoustic ballad before being interrupted by laughter, and then starting back up again with an electric blues rhythm. The music is so similar in places to &quot;Another Side of Bob Dylan&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Motorpsycho Nitemare&quot; as to be indistinguishable from it but for the electric instrumentation. The song can be best read as a highly sardonic, non-linear (historically) dreamscape parallel cataloguing of the discovery, creation and merits (or lack thereof) of the United States.

=== Side two ===

==== &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot; ====
&quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot; is the first track on side 2 of the album. It was written and composed in early 1964, at the same approximate time as &quot;Chimes of Freedom&quot;, which Dylan recorded later that spring for his album &quot;Another Side of Bob Dylan&quot;. The lyrics are surrealist and may be influenced by the work of Arthur Rimbaud (most notably for the &quot;magic swirlin&#x27; ship&quot; evoked in the lyrics).

==== &quot;Gates of Eden&quot; ====
&quot;Gates of Eden&quot; is the only song on the album that is mono on the stereo release and all subsequent reissues. Dylan plays the song solo, accompanying himself on acoustic guitar and harmonica. It is considered one of Dylan&#x27;s most surreal songs.

==== &quot;It&#x27;s Alright Ma (I&#x27;m Only Bleeding)&quot; ====
&quot;It&#x27;s Alright Ma (I&#x27;m Only Bleeding)&quot; was written in the summer of 1964, first performed live on October 10, 1964, and recorded on January 15, 1965. It is described by Dylan biographer Howard Sounes as a &quot;grim masterpiece&quot;. The song features some of Dylan&#x27;s most memorable lyrical images. Among the well-known lines sung in the song are &quot;He not busy being born is busy dying,&quot; &quot;Money doesn&#x27;t talk, it swears,&quot; &quot;Although the masters make the rules, for the wisemen and the fools&quot; and &quot;But even the president of the United States sometimes must have to stand naked.&quot; Musically, it is similar to Dylan&#x27;s cover of &quot;Highway 51 Blues&quot;, which he recorded four years earlier and released on his debut album, &quot;Bob Dylan&quot;.

==== &quot;It&#x27;s All Over Now, Baby Blue&quot; ====
&quot;It&#x27;s All Over Now, Baby Blue&quot; is the album&#x27;s closing song. The song was recorded on January 15, 1965, with Dylan&#x27;s acoustic guitar and harmonica and William E. Lee&#x27;s bass guitar the only instrumentation.

== Artwork ==
The album&#x27;s cover, photographed by Daniel Kramer with an edge-softened lens, features Sally Grossman (wife of Dylan&#x27;s manager Albert Grossman) lounging in the background. There are also artifacts scattered around the room, including LPs by the Impressions (&quot;Keep On Pushing&quot;), Robert Johnson (&quot;King of the Delta Blues Singers&quot;), Ravi Shankar (&quot;India&#x27;s Master Musician&quot;), Lotte Lenya (&quot;Sings Berlin Theatre Songs by Kurt Weill&quot;) and Eric Von Schmidt (&quot;The Folk Blues of Eric Von Schmidt&quot;). Dylan had &quot;met&quot; Schmidt &quot;one day in the green pastures of Harvard University&quot; and would later mimic his album cover pose (tipping his hat) for his own &quot;Nashville Skyline&quot; four years later. A further record, Françoise Hardy&#x27;s EP &quot;J&#x27;suis D&#x27;accord,&quot; was on the floor near Dylan&#x27;s feet but can only be seen in other shots from the same photo session, as well as a copy of the Wilhelm/Baynes version of &quot;I Ching&quot;.

Visible behind Grossman is the top of Dylan&#x27;s head from the cover of &quot;Another Side of Bob Dylan&quot;; under her right arm is the magazine &quot;Time&quot; with President Lyndon B. Johnson as &quot;Man of the Year&quot; on the cover of the January 1, 1965 issue. There is a harmonica resting on a table with a fallout shelter (capacity 80) sign leaning against it. Above the fireplace on the mantle directly to the left of the painting is the Lord Buckley album &quot;The Best of Lord Buckley&quot;. Next to Lord Buckley is a copy of &quot;GNAOUA&quot;, a magazine devoted to exorcism and Beat poetry edited by poet Ira Cohen, and a glass collage by Dylan called &quot;The Clown&quot; made for Bernard Paturel from colored glass Bernard was about to discard.

Dylan sits forward holding his cat (named Rolling Stone) and has an opened magazine featuring an advertisement on &quot;Jean Harlow&#x27;s Life Story&quot; by the columnist Louella Parsons resting on his crossed leg. The cufflinks Dylan wore in the picture were a gift from Joan Baez, as she later referenced in her 1975 song &quot;Diamonds &amp; Rust&quot;. Daniel Kramer received a Grammy nomination for best album cover for the photograph.

On the back cover (also by Kramer), the woman massaging Dylan&#x27;s scalp is the filmmaker and performance artist Barbara Rubin.

== Release ==

&quot;Bringing It All Back Home&quot; was released in April1965 by Columbia Records. The mono version of &quot;Bringing It All Back Home&quot; was re-released in 2010 on &quot;The Original Mono Recordings&quot;, accompanied by a booklet containing a critical essay by Greil Marcus. A high-definition 5.1 surround sound edition of the album was released on SACD by Columbia in 2003.

== Reception ==

The release of &quot;Bringing It All Back Home&quot; coincided with the final show of a joint tour with Joan Baez. By this time, Dylan had grown far more popular and acclaimed than Baez, and his music had radically evolved from their former shared folk style in a totally unique direction. It would be the last time they would perform extensively together until 1975. (She would accompany him on another tour in May 1965, but Dylan would not ask her to perform with him.) The timing was appropriate as &quot;Bringing It All Back Home&quot; signaled a new era. Dylan was backed by an electric rock and roll band—a move that further alienated him from some of his former peers in the folk music community. The album reached No. 6 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Pop Albums chart, the first of Dylan&#x27;s LPs to break into the US top 10. It also topped the UK charts later that spring. The first track, &quot;Subterranean Homesick Blues&quot;, became Dylan&#x27;s first single to chart in the US, peaking at #39.

=== Legacy ===
&quot;Bringing It All Back Home&quot; is regarded as one of the greatest albums in rock history. In 1979 &quot;Rolling Stone Record Guide&quot; critic Dave Marsh wrote: &quot;By fusing the Chuck Berry beat of the Rolling Stones and the Beatles with the leftist, folk tradition of the folk revival, Dylan really had brought it back home, creating a new kind of rock &amp; roll [...] that made every type of artistic tradition available to rock.&quot; Clinton Heylin later wrote that &quot;Bringing It All Back Home&quot; was possibly &quot;the most influential album of its era. Almost everything to come in contemporary popular song can be found therein.&quot; In 2003, the album was ranked number 31 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;, maintaining the rating in a 2012 revised list. It moved down to number 181 on the 2020 list. The album was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2006. In a 1986 interview, film director John Hughes cited it as so influential on him as an artist that upon its release (while Hughes was still in his teens), &quot;Thursday I was one person, and Friday I was another.&quot; The album was included in Robert Christgau&#x27;s &quot;Basic Record Library&quot; of 1950s and 1960s recordings—published in &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981)—and in Robert Dimery&#x27;s music reference book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot; (2010).
It was voted number 189 in the third edition of Colin Larkin&#x27;s book &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot; (2000).
Hip-hop group Public Enemy reference it in their 2007 Dylan tribute song &quot;Long and Whining Road&quot;: &quot;It&#x27;s been a long and whining road, even though time keeps a-changin&#x27; / I&#x27;m a bring it all back home&quot;.

== Outtakes ==
The following outtakes were recorded for possible inclusion to &quot;Bringing It All Back Home&quot;.

*&quot;California&quot; (early version of &quot;Outlaw Blues&quot;)
*&quot;Farewell Angelina&quot;
*&quot;If You Gotta Go, Go Now (Or Else You Got to Stay All Night)&quot;
*&quot;I&#x27;ll Keep It with Mine&quot;
*&quot;You Don&#x27;t Have to Do That&quot; (titled &quot;Bending Down on My Stomick Lookin&#x27; West&quot; on recording sheet)(fragment)

The raunchy &quot;If You Gotta Go, Go Now (Or Else You Got To Stay All Night)&quot; was issued as a single in Benelux. A different version of the song appears on &quot;The Bootleg Series Volumes 1–3 (Rare &amp; Unreleased) 1961–1991&quot;. An upbeat, electric performance, the song is relatively straightforward, with the title providing much of the subtext. Manfred Mann took the song to #2 in the UK in September 1965. Fairport Convention recorded a tongue-in-cheek, acoustic French-language version, &quot;Si Tu Dois Partir&quot;, for their celebrated third album, &quot;Unhalfbricking&quot;.

&quot;I&#x27;ll Keep It with Mine&quot; was written before &quot;Another Side of Bob Dylan&quot; and was given to Nico in 1964. Nico was not yet a recording artist at the time, and she would eventually record the song for &quot;Chelsea Girl&quot; (released in 1967), but not before Judy Collins recorded her own version in 1965. Fairport Convention would also record their own version on their critically acclaimed second album, &quot;What We Did on Our Holidays&quot;. Widely considered a strong composition from this period (Clinton Heylin called it &quot;one of his finest songs&quot;), a complete acoustic version, with Dylan playing piano and harmonica, was released on 1985&#x27;s &quot;Biograph&quot;. An electric recording exists as well—not of an actual take but of a rehearsal from January 1966 (the sound of an engineer saying &quot;what you were doing&quot; through a control room mike briefly interrupts the recording)—was released on &quot;The Bootleg Series Volumes 1–3 (Rare &amp; Unreleased) 1961–1991&quot;.

&quot;Farewell Angelina&quot; was ultimately given to Joan Baez, who released it in 1965 as the title track of her album, &quot;Farewell, Angelina&quot;. The Greek singer Nana Mouskouri recorded her own versions of this song in French (&quot;Adieu Angelina&quot;) in 1967 and German (&quot;Schlaf-ein Angelina&quot;) in 1975.

In the film Dont Look Back, a documentary of Dylan&#x27;s 1965 tour of the UK, Baez is shown in one scene singing a fragment of the then apparently still unfinished song &quot;Love Is Just A Four Letter Word&quot; in a hotel room late at night. She then tells Dylan, &quot;If you finish it, I&#x27;ll sing it on a record&quot;. Dylan never released a version of the song, and, according to his website, he has never performed the song live.

&quot;You Don&#x27;t Have to Do That&quot; is one of the great &quot;what if&quot; songs of Dylan&#x27;s mid-1960s output. A very brief recording, under a minute long, it has Dylan playing a snippet of the song, which he abandoned midway through to begin playing the piano.

<text>John Boyle, 5th Earl of Cork and 5th Earl of Orrery, FRS (13 January 1707 – 16 November 1762) was an Anglo-Irish writer and a friend of Jonathan Swift, Alexander Pope and Samuel Johnson.

The only son of Charles Boyle, 4th Earl of Orrery, and his wife Lady Elizabeth Cecil (1687–1708), daughter of John Cecil, 5th Earl of Exeter. He was born at Westminster and attended Christ Church, Oxford. In 1743, he was one of several leading Tories who communicated with the French government through Francis Sempill in order to elicit French support for an invasion to restore the Stuart line. He published a translation of the letters of Pliny the Younger in 1751, &quot;Remarks on the Life and Writings of Jonathan Swift&quot; in the same year, and the &quot;Memoirs of Robert Carey, 1st Earl of Monmouth&quot;. His &quot;Letters from Italy&quot; was published in 1773.

==Family==
He was married twice, first to Henrietta, daughter of George Hamilton, Earl of Orkney and his wife Elizabeth Hamilton, née Villiers. His eldest son, Charles Boyle, Viscount Dungarvan, predeceased him and he was succeeded as Earl of Cork by his younger son Hamilton, who died in 1764 and passed the earldom to John&#x27;s next son, Edmund. Elizabeth (b.1731), one of his daughters by his first wife, married Sir Thomas Worsley, 6th Baronet, and one of their children was Sir Richard Worsley, 7th Baronet. His second wife was Margaret Hamilton, daughter of John Hamilton of Caledon and Lucy Dopping. She owned considerable estates in Ulster. Their daughter Lucy (b.1744) married George Byng, 4th Viscount Torrington.

<text>A straight-twin engine, also known as an inline-twin, vertical-twin, inline-2, or parallel-twin, is a two-cylinder piston engine whose cylinders are arranged in a line along a common crankshaft.

Straight-twin engines are primarily used in motorcycles; other uses include automobiles, marine vessels, snowmobiles, jet skis, all-terrain vehicles, tractors and ultralight aircraft.

Various different crankshaft configurations have been used for straight-twin engines, with the most common being 360 degrees, 180 degrees and 270 degrees.

== Terminology ==
The straight-twin layout is also referred to as &quot;parallel-twin&quot;, &quot;vertical-twin&quot; and &quot;inline-twin&quot;. Some of these terms originally had specific meanings relating to the crankshaft angle or engine orientation; however, they are often also used interchangeably.

In the United Kingdom, the term &quot;parallel-twin&quot; is traditionally used for engines with a crankshaft angle of 360 degrees, since the two pistons are in the same direction (i.e. parallel to each other). &quot;Vertical-twin&quot; was used to describe engines with a crankshaft angle of 180 degrees, which causes the pistons to travel in opposite directions. The terms &quot;straight-twin&quot; and &quot;inline-twin&quot; were used more generically for any crankshaft angle.

For motorcycles, &quot;inline-twin&quot; has sometimes referred to either a longitudinal engine orientation (i.e. with the crankshaft in line with the chassis) or a U-engine (tandem twin) where the cylinders are arranged longitudinally in the chassis (although the two crankshafts are actually oriented transversely).

== Design ==
Compared with V-twin engines and flat-twin engines, straight-twins are more compact, a simpler design and cheaper to produce. Straight-twin engines can be prone to vibration, either because of the irregular firing interval present in 180° crank engines or the large uncountered reciprocating mass in 360° crank engines. Inline-twins also suffer further from torsional torque reactions and vibration.

=== Crankshaft angle ===
The most common crankshaft configurations for straight-twin engines are 360 degrees, 180 degrees and 270 degrees.

; 360 degrees
In an engine with a 360 degree crankshaft, both pistons move up and down at the same time. However, the firing interval is offset between cylinders, with one of the cylinders firing during the first crankshaft rotation and then the other cylinder in the following rotation. This set up results an even 360 degree firing interval unlike other crank configurations in inline twin engines. The 360 degree engines can use a single ignition system for both cylinders, using a wasted spark system.

The imperfect primary balance is as per a single-cylinder engine of equivalent reciprocating mass. Early engines attempted to reduce vibration through counterweights on the crankshaft; however, later methods also included balance shafts and a separate weighted connecting rod. Compared with a single-cylinder engine, the more frequent firing interval (360 degrees compared with 720 degrees) results in smoother running characteristics, despite the similar dynamic imbalance.

From the 1930s, most British four-stroke straight-twin motorcycle engines used a 360 degree crankshaft, since this avoided the uneven intake pulsing of other configurations, thus preventing the need for twin carburettors. In the 1960s, even though Japanese motorcycles mostly switched to 180 degree crankshafts for engines sized from 250 to 500 cc, various smaller and larger engines continued to use a 360 degree crankshaft. Vibration was less of an issue for smaller engines, such as the 1965 Honda CB92 and 1979 Honda CM185. Larger engines, such as the 1969 Yamaha XS 650 and 1972 Yamaha TX750, often used balance shafts to reduce the vibration. The later 1978–1984 Honda CB250N/CB400N engines also used a 360 degree crankshaft, as does the 1989 Yamaha XTZ750 Super Ténéré. The 2008 BMW F series parallel-twin motorcycles also use 360 degree crankshafts, with a third &quot;vestigial&quot; connecting rod (acting as a counterbalance) and a rev limit of 9,000 rpm to reduce vibrations. In 2009 Fiat launched Multiair inline twin car engines that use 360 degree crankshaft which relied on balance shafts to reduce the vibrations.

; 180 degrees
In an engine with a 180 degree crankshaft, one piston rises as the other falls. In a four-stroke engine, the firing interval is uneven, with the second cylinder firing 180 degrees after the first, followed by a gap of 540 degrees until the first cylinder fires again. The uneven firing interval causes vibrations and results in a &#x27;lumpy&#x27; power delivery. A 180° engine also requires a separate ignition system for each cylinder.

Perfect primary balance is possible with a 180 degree straight-twin engine; however, the design creates a rocking couple which requires use of a balance shaft to reduce the vibration. A 180 degree straight-twin engine has a secondary imbalance (similar to an inline-four engine); however, the lower reciprocating mass means that this often does not require treatment.

A 180° crankshaft engine suffers fewer pumping losses than a 360° twin, because displacement of the crankcase is relatively unchanged as the pistons move.

In the 1960s, Japanese motorcycle manufacturers favoured the use of 180 degree crankshafts, since the increased smoothness allowed higher rpm and thus higher power outputs. For example, the 1966 Honda CB450 180 degree crankshaft engine has a similar power output to contemporary British 360 degree crankshaft engines, despite having a smaller displacement of 450 cc compared with 650 cc. Both the 1973 Yamaha TX500 and the 1977 Suzuki GS400 had a 180 degree crankshaft and a balance shaft. Since 1993, most Honda straight-twin motorcycle engines use 180 degree crankshafts.

Two-stroke engines typically use a 180 degree crankshaft, since this results in two evenly-spaced power strokes per revolution. The fundamental frequency of vibration is twice that of an equivalent single-cylinder engine; however, the amplitude is halved. Two-stroke engines that do not use a 180 degree crankshaft include the 1972 Yankee.

; 270 degrees
In an engine with a 270 degree crankshaft, one piston follows three quarters of a rotation behind the other. This results in an uneven firing interval where the second cylinder fires 270 degrees after the first, followed by a gap of 450 degrees until the first cylinder fires again. This is the same pattern as a 90 degree V-twin engine, and both configurations have a similar &#x27;pulsing&#x27; exhaust sound as a result. The pistons in a 270 degree straight-twin engine are never both stationary at the same time (as per a 90 degree V-twin engine), thereby reducing the net momentum exchange between the crank and pistons during a full rotation.

An imperfect primary balance is created in a 270 degree straight-twin engine, due to a combination of free force and rocking couple; a balance shaft is often used to compensate for this. The secondary balance of a 270 degree engine is perfect; however, the configuration does result in an unbalanced rocking couple.

The first production 270 degree straight-twin motorcycle engines were fitted to the 1996 Yamaha TRX850 and Yamaha TDM. Later examples include the 2009 Triumph Thunderbird, 2010 Norton Commando 961, 2012 Honda NC700 series, 2014 Yamaha MT-07, 2016 Triumph Thruxton 1200 and 2018 Royal Enfield Interceptor 650 &amp; Continental GT. This architecture is proving popular among manufacturers, which are upgrading models that were previously equipped with other engine types, such as the 2016 Honda Africa Twin (formerly a V-twin), 2023 Honda Hornet (formerly an inline-4) or 2023 V-Strom 800 (the older design being equipped with a V-twin).

=== Main bearings ===
Each cylinder in a straight-twin engine has a separate crankpin, unlike V-twin engines which can use a common crankpin for both connecting rods. Most vintage British straight-twin motorcycle engines (such as Triumph, BSA, Norton and Royal Enfield) had two main bearings. Beginning in the late 1950s, most Honda straight-twin engines had four main bearings. Subsequent straight-twin engines had four or occasionally three main bearings.

== Usage in motorcycles ==
===History===

The world&#x27;s first production motorcycle, the 1894 Hildebrand &amp; Wolfmüller used a straight-twin engine. The cylinders lay flat and forward-facing, with the pistons connected directly to the rear wheel using a locomotive-style connecting rod. In 1903, the Werner Motocyclette became the second production motorcycle model, using a straight-twin engine with vertical cylinders. The Werner engine uses cast-iron cylinders with integral heads, side valves and has a displacement of 500 cc.

The 1938 Triumph Speed Twin was a successful straight-twin motorcycle which also led to straight-twin engines becoming more widely used by other brands. The engine was designed by Edward Turner and Val Page, and was initially used in the 1933 Triumph 6/1 sidecar hauler (which won the International Six Days Trial silver medal and the 1933 Maudes Trophy). During the development of the engine, it was found that a 360 degree crank angle was better suited to the use of a single carburettor than a 180 degree crank angle.

Following the trend created by the Triumph Speed Twin, the most common design used by British motorcycle manufacturers until the mid-1970s was a four-stroke straight-twin engine with a 360 degree crankshaft. The manufacturers producing these motorcycles included BSA, Norton, Triumph, Ariel, Matchless and AJS. Straight-twin engines were also produced by Italian and German manufacturers, along with the American manufacturer Indian.

In 1949, the AJS E-90 Porcupine won the 500 1949 Grand Prix World Championship, becoming the first and only straight-twin motorcycle to win the championship. This engine is one of few four-stroke straight-twins to use cylinders oriented horizontally rather than vertically.

Since the 2000s, BMW and several Japanese manufacturers have continued to produce straight-twin engines, mostly for middleweight models. Several large scooters have also used straight-twin engines, such as the 2001 Yamaha TMAX and the 2001 Honda Silver Wing. Straight-twin engines are also used in motocross sidecar racing.

=== Transverse-engined models ===
Many large British motorcycles from 1945 to the 1960s used a straight-twin transverse engine (i.e. oriented with the crankshaft perpendicular to the frame), such as the Triumph Bonneville and Norton Commando. This layout is well suited to air-cooling, since both cylinders receive equal airflow and the exhaust can exit in the well-cooled location at the front of each cylinder.

The transverse-engine straight-twin design has been largely replaced by V-twin engines; however, the straight-twin design has the advantage of easier packaging of ancillaries (such as the air-filter, carburettor and ignition components), which also improves access to ancillaries for maintenance/repairs. A straight-twin engine using a 270 degree crankshaft can have a similar sound and feel to a V-twin engine with an uneven firing order.
=== Longitudinal-engined models ===
Longitudinal engine straight-twin motorcycles are less common; however, examples include the 1930–1938 Dresch Monobloc and the 1949–1956 Sunbeam S7 and S8.

This engine orientation allows for a motorcycle as narrow as a single-cylinder engine, which reduces the aerodynamic drag, especially for the purpose of motorcycle racing. However, the main disadvantage for air-cooled engines is that the rear cylinder runs hotter than the front cylinder.
== Usage in automobiles ==

Although two-cylinder engines are quite uncommon in cars, the straight-twin layout has been used for several automobile engines over time.

The first known straight-twin engine was a variant of the Daimler Motors&#x27; &quot;Phoenix&quot; engine introduced in 1895; these engines were used in Panhard cars that year. Another early straight-twin engined car was the 1898 Decauville Voiturelle, which used a pair of cylinders taken from a de Dion model mounted fore and aft and positioned below the seat.

Straight-twin engines have been used in various small cars, such as the 1957 Fiat 500, 1958 Subaru 360, 1958 NSU Prinz, 1962 Mitsubishi Minica, 1967 Honda N360, 1970 Honda Z600, 1972 Fiat 126, 1988 VAZ Oka, 1988 Dacia Lăstun, 1980 Daihatsu Cuore, and the 2008 Tata Nano.

As of January 2024, petrol straight-twin engines used in production cars currently just include the Fiat TwinAir engine (used in various models from Fiat, Lancia and Alfa Romeo). 

The Piaggio Porter made use of a diesel straight-twin engine until 2020.

== Usage in marine vessels ==

Straight-twin engines have been often used as inboard motors, outboard motors and jet pump motors.

In the early 20th century, gaff-rigged British fishing boats such as Morecambe Bay PrawnersLancashire Nobbys would sometimes retrofit an inboard engine, such as the Lister or the &quot;Kelvin E2&quot; 3.0 litre petrol-paraffin engine.

From the 1950s, manufacturers of outboard motors had settled on the use of the basic inline engine design, cylinders stacked on top of each other with the crankshaft driving the propeller shaft. The &quot;Suzuki 15&quot; outbound motor was introduced in 1989.
== Other uses ==

Other uses include tractors (such as various John Deere models until 1960), snowmobiles, personal watercrafts, and all-terrain vehicles. Design variations include two-stroke, four-stroke, petrol, diesel, air-cooling, water-cooling, natural aspiration and turbocharging.

Ultralight aircraft, single seat gyro-copters and small homebuilt aircraft have also used straight-twin engines, often using engines originally designed for snowmobiles such as the Hirth 2704 and Cuyuna 430-D. Purpose-built engines for ultralight aircraft include the Rotax 503 and Rotax 582. Straight-twin engines are sometimes also used in large scale radio-controlled aircraft.

<text>Shortness of breath (SOB), known as dyspnea (in AmE) or dyspnoea (in BrE), is an uncomfortable feeling of not being able to breathe well enough. The American Thoracic Society defines it as &quot;a subjective experience of breathing discomfort that consists of qualitatively distinct sensations that vary in intensity&quot;, and recommends evaluating dyspnea by assessing the intensity of its distinct sensations, the degree of distress and discomfort involved, and its burden or impact on the patient&#x27;s activities of daily living. Distinct sensations include effort/work to breathe, chest tightness or pain, and &quot;air hunger&quot; (the feeling of not enough oxygen). The tripod position is often assumed to be a sign.

Dyspnea is a normal symptom of heavy physical exertion but becomes pathological if it occurs in unexpected situations, when resting or during light exertion. In 85% of cases it is due to asthma, pneumonia, cardiac ischemia, COVID-19, interstitial lung disease, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or causes, such as panic disorder and anxiety . The best treatment to relieve or even remove shortness of breath typically depends on the underlying cause.

==Definition==
Dyspnea, in medical terms, is &quot;shortness of breath&quot;.
The American Thoracic Society defines dyspnea as: A subjective experience of breathing discomfort that consists of qualitatively distinct sensations that vary in intensity. Other definitions describe it as &quot;difficulty in breathing&quot;, &quot;disordered or inadequate breathing&quot;, &quot;uncomfortable awareness of breathing&quot;, and as the experience of &quot;breathlessness&quot; (which may be either acute or chronic).

==Causes==
While shortness of breath is generally caused by disorders of the cardiac or respiratory system, others such as the neurological, musculoskeletal, endocrine, hematologic, and psychiatric systems may be the cause. DiagnosisPro, an online medical expert system, listed 497 distinct causes in October 2010. The most common cardiovascular causes are myocardial infarction and heart failure while common pulmonary causes include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, pneumothorax, pulmonary edema and pneumonia. On a pathophysiological basis the causes can be divided into (1) increased awareness of normal breathing such as during an anxiety attack, (2) an increase in the work of breathing and (3) an abnormality in the ventilatory or respiratory system. Ischemic strokes, hemorrhages, tumors, infections, seizures, and traumas at the brain stem can also cause shortness of breath, making them the only neurological causes of shortness of breath.

The tempo of onset and the duration of dyspnea are useful in knowing the etiology of dyspnea. Acute shortness of breath is usually connected with sudden physiological changes, such as laryngeal edema, bronchospasm, myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, or pneumothorax. Patients with COPD and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) have a mild onset and gradual progression of dyspnea on exertion, punctuated by acute exacerbations of shortness of breath. In contrast, most asthmatics do not have daily symptoms, but have intermittent episodes of dyspnea, cough, and chest tightness that are usually associated with specific triggers, such as an upper respiratory tract infection or exposure to allergens.

===Acute coronary syndrome===
Acute coronary syndrome frequently presents with retrosternal chest discomfort and difficulty catching the breath. It however may atypically present with shortness of breath alone. Risk factors include old age, smoking, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes. An electrocardiogram and cardiac enzymes are important both for diagnosis and directing treatment. Treatment involves measures to decrease the oxygen requirement of the heart and efforts to increase blood flow.

===COVID-19===

People that have been infected by COVID-19 may have symptoms such as a fever, dry cough, loss of smell and taste, and in moderate to severe cases, shortness of breath.

===Congestive heart failure===
Congestive heart failure frequently presents with shortness of breath with exertion, orthopnea, and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. It affects between 1 and 2% of the general United States population and occurs in 10% of those over 65 years old. Risk factors for acute decompensation include high dietary salt intake, medication noncompliance, cardiac ischemia, abnormal heart rhythms, kidney failure, pulmonary emboli, hypertension, and infections. Treatment efforts are directed toward decreasing lung congestion.

===Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease===
People with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), most commonly emphysema or chronic bronchitis, frequently have chronic shortness of breath and a chronic productive cough. An acute exacerbation presents with increased shortness of breath and sputum production. COPD is a risk factor for pneumonia; thus this condition should be ruled out. In an acute exacerbation treatment is with a combination of anticholinergics, beta2-adrenoceptor agonists, steroids and possibly positive pressure ventilation.

===Asthma===
Asthma is the most common reason for presenting to the emergency room with shortness of breath. It is the most common lung disease in both developing and developed countries affecting about 5% of the population. Other symptoms include wheezing, tightness in the chest, and a nonproductive cough.
Inhaled corticosteroids are the preferred treatment for children, however, these drugs can reduce the growth rate. Acute symptoms are treated with short-acting bronchodilators.

===Pneumothorax===

Pneumothorax presents typically with pleuritic chest pain of acute onset and shortness of breath not improved with oxygen. Physical findings may include absent breath sounds on one side of the chest, jugular venous distension, and tracheal deviation.

===Pneumonia===
The symptoms of pneumonia are fever, productive cough, shortness of breath, and pleuritic chest pain. Inspiratory crackles may be heard on exam. A chest x-ray can be useful to differentiate pneumonia from congestive heart failure. As the cause is usually a bacterial infection, antibiotics are typically used for treatment.

===Pulmonary embolism===
Pulmonary embolism classically presents with an acute onset of shortness of breath. Other presenting symptoms include pleuritic chest pain, cough, hemoptysis, and fever. Risk factors include deep vein thrombosis, recent surgery, cancer, and previous thromboembolism. It must always be considered in those with acute onset of shortness of breath owing to its high risk of mortality. Diagnosis, however, may be difficult and Wells Score is often used to assess the clinical probability. Treatment, depending on the severity of symptoms, typically starts with anticoagulants; the presence of ominous signs (low blood pressure) may warrant the use of thrombolytic drugs.

===Anemia===
Anemia that develops gradually usually presents with exertional dyspnea, fatigue, weakness, and tachycardia. It may lead to heart failure. Anaemia is often a cause of dyspnea. Menstruation, particularly if excessive, can contribute to anaemia and consequential dyspnea in women. Headaches are a symptom of dyspnea in patients with anaemia. Some patients report a numb sensation in their head, and others have reported blurred vision caused by hypotension behind the eye due to a lack of oxygen and pressure; these patients have reported severe head pains, which can lead to permanent brain damage. Symptoms can include loss of concentration, focus, fatigue, language faculty impairment, and memory loss.

=== Cancer ===
Shortness of breath is common in people with cancer and may be caused by numerous different factors. In people with advanced cancer, periods with severe shortness of breath may occur, along with a more continuous feeling of breathlessness. Treatments for breathlessness include both nonpharmacological and pharmacological approaches. Nonpharmacological interventions that have shown to improve breathlessness include the use of fans, behavioral and psychoeducational strategies, exercise, and pulmonary rehabilitation. Pharmacological treatments involve bronchodilators and corticosteroids to address the underlying causes of shortness of breath, as well as opioids or anti-anxiety medications to alleviate symptoms. Integrative medicine options include acupuncture/acupressure/reflexology, meditation, and music therapy, with acupuncture/reflexology found to have a beneficial effect.

===Other===
Other important or common causes of shortness of breath include cardiac tamponade, anaphylaxis, interstitial lung disease, panic attacks, and pulmonary hypertension. It is more common among people with relatively small lungs. Around 2/3 of women experience shortness of breath as a part of a normal pregnancy.

Cardiac tamponade presents with dyspnea, tachycardia, elevated jugular venous pressure, and pulsus paradoxus. The gold standard for diagnosis is ultrasound.

Anaphylaxis typically begins over a few minutes in a person with a previous history of the same. Other symptoms include urticaria, throat swelling, and gastrointestinal upset. The primary treatment is epinephrine.

Interstitial lung disease presents with a gradual onset of shortness of breath typically with a history of predisposing environmental exposure. Shortness of breath is often the only symptom in those with tachydysrhythmias.

Panic attacks typically present with hyperventilation, sweating, and numbness. They are however a diagnosis of exclusion.

Neurological conditions such as spinal cord injury, phrenic nerve injuries, Guillain–Barré syndrome, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis and muscular dystrophy can all cause an individual to experience shortness of breath. Shortness of breath can also occur as a result of vocal cord dysfunction (VCD).

Sarcoidosis is an inflammatory disease of unknown etiology that generally presents with dry cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath, although multiple organ systems may be affected, with the involvement of sites such as the eyes, the skin, and the joints.

==Pathophysiology==
Different physiological pathways may lead to shortness of breath including via ASIC chemoreceptors, mechanoreceptors, and lung receptors.

It is thought that three main components contribute to dyspnea: afferent signals, efferent signals, and central information processing. It is believed the central processing in the brain compares the afferent and efferent signals; and dyspnea results when a &quot;mismatch&quot; occurs between the two: such as when the need for ventilation (afferent signaling) is not being met by physical breathing (efferent signaling).

Afferent signals are sensory neuronal signals that ascend to the brain. Afferent neurons significant in dyspnea arise from a large number of sources including the carotid bodies, medulla, lungs, and chest wall. Chemoreceptors in the carotid bodies and medulla supply information regarding the blood gas levels of O2, CO2 and H+. In the lungs, juxtacapillary (J) receptors are sensitive to pulmonary interstitial edema, while stretch receptors signal bronchoconstriction. Muscle spindles in the chest wall signal the stretch and tension of the respiratory muscles. Thus, poor ventilation leads to hypercapnia, left heart failure leading to interstitial edema (impairing gas exchange), asthma causing bronchoconstriction (limiting airflow) and muscle fatigue leading to ineffective respiratory muscle action could all contribute to a feeling of dyspnea.

Efferent signals are the motor neuronal signals descending to the respiratory muscles. The most important respiratory muscle is the diaphragm. Other respiratory muscles include the external and internal intercostal muscles, the abdominal muscles, and the accessory breathing muscles. As the brain receives its plentiful supply of afferent information relating to ventilation, it can compare it to the current level of respiration as determined by the efferent signals. If the level of respiration is inappropriate for the body&#x27;s status then dyspnea might occur. There is also a psychological component to dyspnea, as some people may become aware of their breathing in such circumstances but not experience the typical distress of dyspnea.

==Diagnosis==
The initial approach to evaluation begins with an assessment of the airway, breathing, and circulation followed by a medical history and physical examination. Signs and symptoms that represent significant severity include hypotension, hypoxemia, tracheal deviation, altered mental status, unstable dysrhythmia, stridor, intercostal indrawing, cyanosis, tripod positioning, pronounced use of accessory muscles (sternocleidomastoid, scalenes) and absent breath sounds.

A number of scales may be used to quantify the degree of shortness of breath. It may be subjectively rated on a scale from 1 to 10 with descriptors associated with the number (The Modified Borg Scale). The MRC breathlessness scale suggests five grades of dyspnea based on the circumstances and severity in which it arises.

===Blood tests===
Several labs may help determine the cause of shortness of breath. D-dimer, while useful to rule out a pulmonary embolism in those who are at low risk, is not of much value if it is positive, as it may be positive in several conditions that lead to shortness of breath. A low level of brain natriuretic peptide is useful in ruling out congestive heart failure; however, a high level, while supportive of the diagnosis, could also be due to advanced age, kidney failure, acute coronary syndrome, or a large pulmonary embolism.

===Imaging===
A chest x-ray is useful to confirm or rule out a pneumothorax, pulmonary edema, or pneumonia. Spiral computed tomography with intravenous radiocontrast is the imaging study of choice to evaluate for pulmonary embolism.

==Treatment==
The primary treatment of shortness of breath is directed at its underlying cause. Extra supplemental oxygen is effective in those with hypoxia; however, this has no effect in those with normal blood oxygen saturations.

===Physiotherapy===
Individuals can benefit from a variety of physical therapy interventions. Persons with neurological/neuromuscular abnormalities may have breathing difficulties due to weak or paralyzed intercostal, abdominal and/or other muscles needed for ventilation. Some physical therapy interventions for this population include active assisted cough techniques, volume augmentation such as breath stacking, education about body position and ventilation patterns and movement strategies to facilitate breathing. Pulmonary rehabilitation may alleviate symptoms in some people, such as those with COPD, but will not cure the underlying disease. Fan therapy to the face has been shown to relieve shortness of breath in patients with a variety of advanced illnesses including cancer. The mechanism of action is thought to be stimulation of the trigeminal nerve.

===Palliative medicine===
Systemic immediate release opioids are beneficial in emergently reducing the symptom severity of shortness of breath due to both cancer and non-cancer causes; long-acting/sustained-release opioids are also used to prevent/continue treatment of dyspnea in palliative setting. There is a lack of evidence to recommend midazolam, nebulised opioids, the use of gas mixtures, or cognitive-behavioral therapy yet.

=== Non-pharmacological techniques ===
Non-pharmacological interventions provide key tools for the management of breathlessness. Potentially beneficial approaches include active management of psychosocial issues (anxiety, depression, etc.), and implementation of self-management strategies, such as physical and mental relaxation techniques, pacing techniques, energy conservation techniques, learning exercises to control breathing, and education. The use of a fan may be beneficial. Cognitive behavioural therapy may also be helpful.

=== Pharmacological treatment ===
For people with severe, chronic, or uncontrollable breathlessness, non-pharmacological approaches to treating breathlessness may be combined with medication. For people who have cancer that is causing the breathlessness, medications that have been suggested include opioids, benzodiazepines, oxygen, and steroids. Results of recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses found opioids were not necessarily associated with more effectiveness in treatment for patients with advanced cancer.

Ensuring that the balance between side effects and adverse effects from medications and potential improvements from medications needs to be carefully considered before prescribing medication. The use of systematic corticosteroids in palliative care for people with cancer is common, however, the effectiveness and potential adverse effects of this approach in adults with cancer have not been well studied.

==Epidemiology==
Shortness of breath is the primary reason 3.5% of people present to the emergency department in the United States. Of these individuals, approximately 51% are admitted to the hospital and 13% die within a year. Some studies have suggested that up to 27% of hospitalized people develop dyspnea, while in dying patients 75% will experience it. Acute shortness of breath is the most common reason people requiring palliative care visit an emergency department. Up to 70% of adults with advanced cancer also experience dyspnoea.

==Etymology and pronunciation==
English &quot;dyspnea&quot; comes from Latin &quot;dyspnoea&quot;, from Greek &quot;dyspnoia&quot;, from &quot;dyspnoos&quot;, which literally means &quot;disordered breathing&quot;. Its combining forms (&quot;&quot; + &quot;&quot;) are familiar from other medical words, such as &quot;dysfunction&quot; (&quot;&quot; + &quot;&quot;) and &quot;apnea&quot; (&quot;&quot; + &quot;&quot;). The most common pronunciation in medical English is , with the &quot;p&quot; expressed and the stress on the /niː/ syllable. But pronunciations with a silent &quot;p&quot; in &quot;pn&quot; (as also in &quot;&quot;) are common ( or ), as are those with the stress on the first syllable ( or ).

In English, the various &quot;-pnea&quot;-suffixed words commonly used in medicine do not follow one clear pattern as to whether the /niː/ syllable or the one preceding it is stressed; the &quot;p&quot; is usually expressed but is sometimes silent depending on the word. The following or list shows the of how major dictionaries pronounce and transcribe them (less-used variants are omitted):

<doc id="200035" wikidata="Q852213" url="?curid=200035" title="Burnin' (Bob Marley and the Wailers album)">
<text>Burnin&#x27; is the sixth album by Jamaican reggae group the Wailers (also known as Bob Marley and the Wailers), released in October 1973. It was written by all three members and recorded and produced by the Wailers in Jamaica, contemporaneously with tracks from the &quot;Catch a Fire&quot; album with further recording, mixing and completion while on the &quot;Catch a Fire&quot; tour in London. It contains the song &quot;I Shot the Sheriff&quot;. It was the last album before Marley, Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer decided to pursue solo careers, while continuing their local releases through their company Tuff Gong Records. A commercial and critical success in the United States, &quot;Burnin″&quot; was certified Gold and later added to the National Recording Registry, with the Library of Congress deeming it historically and culturally significant.

==Recording==
The album was recorded at Harry J&#x27;s studio in Kingston, Jamaica, with the Wailers producing. It was mixed and overdubbed by Chris Blackwell at Island Records&#x27; Basing Street studios in London during the spring of 1973 while the band were touring in support of their previous album, &quot;Catch a Fire&quot;.

==Music and lyrics==
&quot;Burnin″&quot; opens with one of The Wailers&#x27; best known songs, the call to action &quot;Get Up, Stand Up&quot; and includes a more confrontational and militant tone than previous records, such as in another Wailers standard turned into a number one hit by Eric Clapton, &quot;I Shot the Sheriff&quot;. The songs &quot;Duppy Conqueror&quot;, &quot;Small Axe&quot;, and &quot;Put It On&quot; are re-recordings of songs previously released on their co productions with Lee Perry’s Upsetters Label.

==Critical reception==
Reviewing in &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981), Robert Christgau wrote: &quot;This is as perplexing as it is jubilant—sometimes gripping, sometimes slippery. It&#x27;s reggae, obviously, but it&#x27;s not mainstream reggae, certainly not rock or soul, maybe some kind of futuristic slow funk, War without the pseudo-jazz. What&#x27;s inescapable is The Wailers’ ferocious gift for melodic propaganda. It&#x27;s one thing to come up with four consecutive title hooks, another to make the titles &#x27;Get Up Stand Up,&#x27; &#x27;Hallelujah Time,&#x27; &#x27;I Shot the Sheriff,&#x27; &#x27;Burnin&#x27; and Lootin&#x27;.&#x27;&quot;

In 2003, the album was ranked number 319 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. The album maintained the same position in a 2012 update of the list.

In 2007 the album was added to the Library of Congress&#x27; National Recording Registry for its historical and cultural significance.

<doc id="200037" wikidata="Q5958706" url="?curid=200037" title="Hypertensive urgency">
<text>A hypertensive urgency is a clinical situation in which blood pressure is very high (e.g., 220/125 mmHg) with minimal or no symptoms, and &quot;no&quot; signs or symptoms indicating acute organ damage. This contrasts with a hypertensive emergency where severely high blood pressure is accompanied by evidence of progressive organ or system damage.
==Definition==
Hypertensive urgency is defined as severely high blood pressure with no evidence of end organ damage. The term &quot;malignant hypertension&quot; was also included under this category with grade III/IV hypertensive retinopathy. However, in 2018, European Society of Cardiology and the European Society of Hypertension issued a new guideline which put &quot;malignant hypertension&quot; under the category &quot;hypertensive emergency&quot;, which emphasize on poor outcome if the condition is not treated urgently.

== Treatment ==
In a hypertensive urgency blood pressure should be lowered carefully to ≤160/≤100 mmHg over a period of hours to days, this can often be done as an outpatient. There is limited evidence regarding the most appropriate rate of blood pressure reduction, although it is recommended that mean arterial pressure should be lowered by no more than 25 to 30 percent over the first few hours. Recommended medications for hypertensive urgencies include: captopril, labetalol, amlodipine, felodipine, isradipine, and prazosin. Sublingual nifedipine is not recommended in hypertensive urgencies. This is because nifedipine can cause rapid decrease of blood pressure which can precipitate cerebral or cardiac ischemic events. There is also lack of evidence on the benefits of nifedipine in controlling hypertension. Acute administration of drugs should be followed by several hours of observation to ensure that blood pressure does not fall too much. Aggressive dosing with intravenous drugs or oral agents which lowers blood pressure too rapidly carries risk; conversely there is no evidence that failure to rapidly lower blood pressure in a hypertensive urgency is associated with any increased short-term risk.

== Epidemiology ==
Not much is known about the epidemiology of hypertensive urgencies. Retrospective analysis of data from 1,290,804 adults admitted to hospital emergency departments in United States from 2005 through 2007 found that severe hypertension with a systolic blood pressure ≥180 mmHg occurred in 13.8% of patients. Based on another study in a US public teaching hospital about 60% of hypertensive crises are due to hypertensive urgencies.

Risk factors for severe hypertension include older age, female sex, obesity, coronary artery disease, somatoform disorder, being prescribed multiple antihypertensive medications, and non-adherence to medication.
