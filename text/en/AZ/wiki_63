<text>Dame Lesley Lawson (&quot;née&quot; Hornby; born 19 September 1949), widely known by the nickname Twiggy, is an English model, actress, and singer. She was a British cultural icon and a prominent teenage model during the swinging &#x27;60s in London.

Twiggy was initially known for her thin build and the androgynous appearance considered to result from her big eyes, long eyelashes, and short hair. She was named &quot;The Face of 1966&quot; by the &quot;Daily Express&quot; and voted British Woman of the Year. By 1967, she had modelled in France, Japan, and the US, and had appeared on the covers of &quot;Vogue&quot; and &quot;The Tatler&quot;. Her fame had spread worldwide.

After modelling, Twiggy had a successful career as a screen, stage, and television actress. Her role in &quot;The Boy Friend&quot; (1971) earned her two Golden Globe Awards. In 1983, she made her Broadway debut in the musical &quot;My One and Only&quot;, for which she received a Tony nomination for Best Actress in a Musical. She later hosted her own series, &quot;Twiggy&#x27;s People&quot;, in which she interviewed celebrities, and appeared as a judge on the reality show &quot;America&#x27;s Next Top Model&quot;. Her 1998 autobiography &quot;Twiggy in Black and White&quot; entered the best-seller lists. Since 2005, she has modelled for Marks and Spencer, appearing in television advertisements and print media. She has been credited for the company&#x27;s successful revival at that time.

==Early life==
Lesley Hornby was born on 19 September 1949 and raised in Neasden (originally in Middlesex, now a suburb of north-west London). She was the third daughter of Nellie Lydia (&quot;née&quot; Reeman), a factory worker for a printing firm, and William Norman Hornby, a master carpenter and joiner from Lancashire. Their first daughter, Shirley, had been born 15 years earlier; their second, Vivien, had been born 7 years earlier. According to Twiggy, her maternal grandfather was Jewish. However, her mother&#x27;s genealogy, which was examined on the series &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot; in 2014, does not contain Jewish ancestry.

Twiggy&#x27;s mother taught her to sew from an early age. She used this skill to make her own clothing. She attended the Brondesbury and Kilburn High School.

==Modelling career (1965–1970)==
===1965–1967===
Twiggy is one of the first international supermodels and a fashion icon of the 1960s. Her greatest influence is Jean Shrimpton, whom Twiggy considers to be the world&#x27;s first supermodel. She has said she based her &quot;look&quot; on Pattie Boyd. Twiggy herself has been described as the successor to Shrimpton.

In January 1966, aged 16, she had her hair coloured and cut short in London at Leonard of Mayfair, owned by celebrity hairdresser Leonard. The hair stylist was looking for models on whom to try out his new crop haircut and he styled her hair in preparation for a few test head shots. A professional photographer Barry Lategan took several photos for Leonard, which the hairdresser hung in his salon. Deirdre McSharry, a fashion journalist from the &quot;Daily Express&quot;, saw the images and asked to meet the young girl.

McSharry arranged to have more photos taken. A few weeks later, the publication featured an article and images of Hornby, declaring her &quot;The Face of &#x27;66&quot;. In it, the copy read: &quot;The Cockney kid with a face to launch a thousand shapes... and she&#x27;s only 16&quot;.

Hornby&#x27;s career quickly took off. She was short for a model at , weighed and had a 31–23–32 (79–58–81 cm) figure, &quot;with a new kind of streamlined, androgynous sex appeal&quot;. Her hairdresser boyfriend, Nigel Davies, became her manager, changed his name to Justin de Villeneuve, and persuaded her to change her name to Twiggy (from &quot;Twigs&quot;, her childhood nickname). De Villeneuve credits himself for Twiggy&#x27;s discovery and her modelling success, and his version of events is often quoted in other biographies. In her 1998 book &quot;Twiggy In Black and White&quot;, she says that she met Justin through his brother, when she worked as a Saturday girl at a hairdressers in London. This is where she began to see the models in the magazines, but never thought she could do something like that. Jean Shrimpton was her idol, so she grew her hair long to look like her, before having to have it cut off for her headshots by Barry Lategan. Ten years her senior, De Villeneuve managed her lucrative career for seven years, overseeing her finances and enterprises during her heyday as a model.

Twiggy was soon seen in all the leading fashion magazines, commanding fees of £80 an hour, bringing out her own line of clothes called &quot;Twiggy Dresses&quot; in 1967, and taking the fashion world by storm. &quot;I hated what I looked like,&quot; she said once, &quot;so I thought everyone had gone stark raving mad.&quot; Twiggy&#x27;s look centred on three qualities: her stick-thin figure, a boyishly short haircut and strikingly dark eyelashes. Her signature look was achieved in part by applying three layers of false eyelashes.

One month after the &quot;Daily Express&quot; article, Twiggy posed for her first shoot for &quot;Vogue&quot;. Since then she has appeared on the cover of Vogue (and numerous international editions) 14 times.

===1967–1970===
Twiggy arrived in New York in March 1967 at Kennedy Airport, an event covered by the press. &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, &quot;Life&quot; and &quot;Newsweek&quot; reported on the Twiggy &quot;phenomenon&quot; in 1967, with the &quot;New Yorker&quot; devoting nearly 100 pages to the subject.&quot; That year she became an international sensation, modelling in France, Japan and America, and landing the cover of Paris &quot;Vogue&quot; in May, the cover of US &quot;Vogue&quot; three times, in April, July and November, and the cover of British &quot;Vogue&quot; in October. In 1967, an editorial on page 63 of the edition of 15 March of &quot;Vogue&quot; described her as an &quot;extravaganza that makes the look of the sixties&quot; Twiggy was, according to feminist critic Linda Delibero, &quot;the most visible commodity Britain produced that year, and [America] generously complied with the hype, scarfing up skinny little Twiggy pens, Twiggy lunch boxes, Twiggy lashes, an assortment of Twiggy-endorsed cosmetics&quot;.

The Metropolitan Museum of Art&#x27;s 2009 catalogue for its exhibition &quot;The&quot; &quot;Model as Muse: Embodying Fashion&quot; stated:Twiggy&#x27;s adolescent physique was the perfect frame for the androgynous styles that began to emerge in the 1960s. The trend was manifested in a number of templates: sweet A-line dresses with collars and neckties, suits and dresses that took their details from military uniforms, or, in the case of Yves Saint Laurent, an explicit transposition of the male tuxedo to women. Simultaneously, under the rubric of &quot;unisex&quot;, designs that were minimalistic, including Nehru suits and space-agey jumpsuits, were proposed by designers such as Pierre Cardin and Andre Courreges, and, most famously in the United States, by Rudi Gernreich.

Twiggy has been photographed by such noted photographers as Cecil Beaton, Richard Avedon, Melvin Sokolsky, Ronald Traeger, Bert Stern, Norman Parkinson, Annie Leibovitz and Steven Meisel.

===Reaction===
Twiggy and the magazines featuring her image polarised critics from the start. Her boyishly thin image was, and still is, criticised for allegedly promoting an &quot;unhealthy&quot; body ideal for women. &quot;Twiggy came along at a time when teen-age spending power was never greater,&quot; said Su Dalgleish, fashion correspondent for the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;. &quot;With that underdeveloped, boyish figure, she is an idol to the 14- and 15-year-old kids. She makes virtue of all the terrible things of gawky, miserable adolescence.&quot; At the height of her fame, Mark Cohen, president of Leeds Women&#x27;s shop, had an even harsher view: &quot;Her legs remind me of two painted worms.&quot; Yet Twiggy had her supporters. Diana Vreeland of &quot;Vogue&quot; stated, &quot;She&#x27;s no flash in the pan. She is the mini-girl in the mini-era. She&#x27;s delicious looking.&quot; In recent years, Twiggy has spoken out against the trend of waif-thin models, explaining that her own thin weight as a teenager was natural: &quot;I was very skinny, but that was just my natural build. I always ate sensibly – being thin was in my genes.&quot;

On 10 December 1969, despite being 20 years old, Twiggy was selected as the subject for one of the first editions produced by Thames Television of the television series &quot;This Is Your Life&quot;.

==Stage, film, television, and singing career==

===1970–1979===

After four years of modelling, Twiggy retired in 1970, stating, &quot;You can&#x27;t be a clothes hanger for your entire life!&quot; She broke off with Justin de Villeneuve, who had been overseeing her business affairs since 1966, and released him from his duties as her manager, claiming in later years that &quot;her career had more to do with that famous picture of her with those funny painted eyelashes, which appeared in the &quot;Daily Express&quot; under the headline &#x27;The Face of &#x27;66 than with his promotional efforts.

She has stated several times that she is only really remembered for her modelling career although it was &quot;only a short part of my life&quot;. She began to develop a film interest through her weekly visits to Ken Russell&#x27;s house; they would watch old films together, which featured Greta Garbo, Clark Gable, and other Hollywood actors and actresses. This began to give Twiggy a new outlook on the way she dressed and the way she wore her hair; she began wearing a beret, longer skirts, and flowers as the hippie look was beginning to take over London. Ken and Twiggy worked on a film together, called &quot;The Boy Friend&quot; (1971), after watching a performance of the original musical, staged by Ken&#x27;s mother&#x27;s amateur dramatics group.

Twiggy then embarked on an acting and singing career, starring in a variety of roles on stage and screen, and recording albums. In 1971 she made her film debut as an extra, dressed as a male courtier, in Ken Russell&#x27;s &quot;The Devils&quot;. The same year, she performed her first leading role as Polly Browne in Russell&#x27;s adaptation of Sandy Wilson&#x27;s pastiche of 1920s hit musicals, &quot;The Boy Friend&quot; (1971). This marked her initial collaboration with Tommy Tune and won her two Golden Globe Awards in 1972 (New Star of the Year – Actress and Best Actress in a Musical or Comedy). Also in 1971, Twiggy released the single &quot;Zoo de Zoo Zong&quot;, written by Roger Cook and Roger Greenaway and credited to Twiggy and Friends. In 1974, she made her West End stage debut in &quot;Cinderella&quot;; made a second feature, the thriller &quot;W&quot; (co-starring with her future husband Michael Witney); and hosted her own British television series &quot;Twiggs&quot; (later renamed &quot;Twiggy&quot;).

In 1973, she appeared with David Bowie on the cover of his seventh album, &quot;Pin Ups&quot;. which entered the UK chart on 3 November 1973 and stayed there for 21 weeks, peaking at No. 1. She was also name-checked (&quot;She&#x27;d sigh like Twig the wonder kid&quot;) in Bowie&#x27;s song Drive-In Saturday for his Aladdin Sane album.

In October 1975, she sang at the live performance of Roger Glover&#x27;s &quot;The Butterfly Ball and the Grasshopper&#x27;s Feast&quot; album at the Royal Albert Hall in London. The concert was filmed and produced by Tony Klinger and released to cinemas in 1976. In November 1976, she made an appearance on &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;, in which she sang the Beatles song, &quot;In My Life&quot;. In 1976, she signed to Mercury Records and released the albums &quot;Twiggy&quot; and &quot;Please Get My Name Right&quot;, that contained both pop and country tunes. &quot;Twiggy&quot; sold very well, peaking on the UK charts at No. 33, and gave Twiggy a silver disc for good sales. The album contains Twiggy&#x27;s top-20 hit single, &quot;Here I Go Again&quot;. &quot;Please Get My Name Right&quot; made it to No. 35 in 1977. The single, &quot;A Woman in Love&quot;, failed to chart for Twiggy in 1977 but was a hit for the Three Degrees in 1979. Twiggy also sang some of the songs in the first volume of &quot;Captain Beaky and His Band&quot; in 1977.

In 1978, the television distribution arm of American International Pictures, in an effort to gain additional syndication value in the US to the LWT rock music series &quot;Supersonic&quot;, repackaged the musical performances with Twiggy replacing Mike Mansfield&#x27;s introductions. The new series, titled &quot;Twiggy&#x27;s Jukebox&quot;, ran in most of the major television markets in the US during the 1978–79 TV season. Coincidentally, Twiggy had performed &quot;Here I Go Again&quot; and &quot;Vanilla Olay&quot; on &quot;Supersonic&quot; in September 1976, and these performances were included in the refurbished programme. After the initial season, Twiggy left the series, and American International Television continued &quot;Jukebox&quot; with Britt Ekland as host, using standard music videos rather than clips from &quot;Supersonic&quot;. Twiggy appeared in &quot;There Goes the Bride&quot; with Tom Smothers in 1979.

===1980–1999===
In 1980, Twiggy made a cameo appearance in &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot;. She starred as Eliza Doolittle in 1981, opposite Robert Powell, in the Yorkshire TV production of &quot;Pygmalion&quot;. In 1983, she made her Broadway debut in the musical &quot;My One and Only&quot;, starring and co-staged by Tommy Tune, for which she earned a Tony nomination. She played opposite Robin Williams in the 1986 comedy &quot;Club Paradise&quot;. In 1987, she played a vaudeville performer in the British television special &quot;The Little Match Girl&quot;, and in 1988, she appeared in a supporting role in &quot;Madame Sousatzka&quot; opposite her second husband, Leigh Lawson. In 1989, she was cast as Hannah Chaplin, mother to Charles, in the British television movie &quot;Young Charlie Chaplin&quot;, aired in the United States on PBS&#x27; &quot;WonderWorks&quot;.

In 1991, she co-starred in her first American network dramatic television series, the short-lived CBS sitcom &quot;Princesses&quot;. Of eight episodes completed, only five aired. (Her &quot;Princesses&quot; co-star, Fran Drescher, later spent some time with Twiggy and her family in England while developing Drescher&#x27;s hit series &quot;The Nanny&quot;, and modelled the character Maxwell Sheffield on Twiggy&#x27;s husband Leigh Lawson.)

In 1993, Twiggy appeared alongside Mark Hamill in the short segment &quot;Eye&quot; from the made-for-cable horror anthology &quot;Body Bags&quot;. In 1994, Twiggy guest-starred in the first ever &quot;Heartbeat&quot; Christmas special (in series 4), playing Lady Janet Whitley.

In 1997, Twiggy acted in the Chichester Festival Theatre revival of Noël Coward&#x27;s &quot;Blithe Spirit&quot;. A year later, she played Gertrude Lawrence in the biographical stage revue &quot;Noel and Gertie&quot; at Bay Street Theatre in Sag Harbor, Long Island. In 1999, she returned to the New York stage in an off-Broadway production, &quot;If Love Were All&quot;, a revised version of &quot;Noel and Gertie&quot;, written and directed by Leigh Lawson; what set this edition apart were its tap numbers in period style. She starred as Gertrude Lawrence opposite Harry Groener&#x27;s Noël Coward.

===2000–2009===
In 2001, Twiggy co-hosted the British magazine programme &quot;This Morning&quot;. In 2003, she released another album, &quot;Midnight Blue&quot;. Seventeen of the CD&#x27;s 20 tracks had previously unreleased material from 1982 to 1990, including a duet with Leo Sayer, &quot;Save the Last Dance for Me&quot;, and a cover of the Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;Ruby Tuesday&quot;. Two of the tracks (&quot;Feel Emotion&quot; and &quot;Diamond&quot;) had been issued as singles in the mid-1980s. In 2005, she joined the cast of the television show &quot;America&#x27;s Next Top Model&quot; for Cycles 5–9 as one of four judges, and a year later, she appeared on the cover of the &quot;Icons&quot; issue of &quot;Swindle&quot; magazine. She also returned to modelling, fronting a major television, press, and billboard campaign for Marks &amp; Spencer, the British department-store chain. Her involvement in the advertising campaign has been credited for Marks and Spencer&#x27;s successful revival.

In 2006, she portrayed herself as a 19-year-old in the radio play &quot;Elevenses with Twiggy&quot;, for BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;The Afternoon Play&quot; series. She did not return to &quot;America&#x27;s Next Top Model&quot; in its tenth season due to scheduling conflicts. Her replacement was model Paulina Porizkova. Also in 2007, Sepia Records released a previously shelved album, &quot;Heaven in My Eyes [&quot;Discotheque&quot;]&quot;, that Twiggy recorded in 1979, produced by Donna Summer and Juergen Koppers. In 2008, she supported the &quot;Fashion Targets Breast Cancer&quot; campaign in support of Breakthrough Breast Cancer, alongside fellow celebritiescomedian Alan Carr, singer Natalie Imbruglia, actress Anna Friel, and broadcaster Edith Bowman. She also appeared in Marks &amp; Spender&#x27;s 2008 Christmas ad campaign alongside Myleene Klass, Lily Cole, and others.

In the summer of 2009, the beauty products company Olay debuted its &quot;Definity Eye Cream&quot; campaign depicting Twiggy. Accusations of airbrushing created a stir with the media and public. A website campaign set up by Jo Swinson, the Scottish Liberal Democrat MP, attracted 700 individual complaints. Procter &amp; Gamble admitted to minor retouching and replaced the image. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) announced that the ad gave a &quot;misleading&quot; impression, but that no further action was required because the image had already been withdrawn. Its announcement said:

==Later career==
===2010–present===
Twiggy remains in the forefront of fashion for women of her age. She was one of the few famous celebrities to avoid being cut from the Marks &amp; Spencer fashion team in 2009–2010, when Dannii Minogue joined her for the spring/summer women&#x27;s wear campaign.

In 2010, she started a Home Shopping Network fashion line called the &quot;Twiggy London&quot; collection.

On 21 November 2011, she released an album, &quot;Romantically Yours&quot;, through EMI. A collection of pop and easy listening standards spanning several generations, the album features versions of such compositions as &quot;Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered&quot;, &quot;Blue Moon&quot;, &quot;My Funny Valentine&quot;, &quot;Someone to Watch Over Me&quot; and &quot;They Can&#x27;t Take That Away from Me&quot;, and London anthem &quot;Waterloo Sunset&quot;. The album also includes a guest vocal appearance by Twiggy&#x27;s daughter, Carly Lawson, on Neil Young&#x27;s &quot;Only Love Can Break Your Heart&quot;, a guitar solo by Bryan Adams, and a version of Richard Marx&#x27;s &quot;Right Here Waiting&quot; featuring duet vocals with the American songwriter himself. In 2012, she worked alongside Marks &amp; Spencer&#x27;s designers to launch an exclusive clothing collection for the M&amp;S Woman range. In 2016, archive images of Twiggy, alongside images of Shrimpton and Jane Birkin, were used for Tod&#x27;s Fall/Winter campaign.

On 22 November 2022, actress and filmmaker Sadie Frost teamed up with Twiggy to create an interactive virtual documentary about Twiggy&#x27;s life. On 16 May 2023, the documentary&#x27;s final scene was produced live at (the Cannes Film Festival) 2023, in just 48 hours, using the on-site virtual production stage of film studio, Film Soho. Alongside this, a live virtual experience by metaverse company, Hadean, and live event visualisation solutions provider, disguise, made use of Unreal Engine to create a photo-realistic recreation of London&#x27;s Carnaby Street in the 1960s, engaging users with interactive elements based on Twiggy&#x27;s memories of the time.

A jukebox musical based on Twiggy&#x27;s life titled &quot;Twiggy The Musical&quot; was written and directed by Ben Elton and had its world premiere at the Menier Chocolate Factory, London in September 2023 (originally as &quot;Close-Up: The Twiggy Musical&quot;). It will tour the UK from September 2025.

==Honours==
She was appointed a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in the 2019 New Year Honours for services to fashion, to the arts and to charity. Her appointment appeared in &quot;The London Gazette&quot; under her married name, Lesley Lawson.

==Personal life==
Twiggy married American actor Michael Witney in 1977. Their daughter, Carly, was born in 1978. They remained married until his death in 1983 from a heart attack.

She met Leigh Lawson in 1984. In 1988, they worked on the film &quot;Madame Sousatzka&quot; and married that year in Sag Harbor, New York (on Long Island). The couple reside in Kensington, London and own a home in Southwold, Suffolk.

On Twiggy&#x27;s official website, she states she is a supporter of breast cancer research, animal welfare, and anti-fur campaigns. She was one of the celebrities, including Tom Hiddleston, Jo Brand, E. L. James, Benedict Cumberbatch, and Rachel Riley, to design and sign her own card for the UK-based charity Thomas Coram Foundation for Children. The campaign was launched by crafting company Stampin&#x27; Up! UK, and the cards were auctioned off on eBay during May 2014.

<text>Alsace–Lorraine (German: &quot;Elsaß–Lothringen&quot;), officially the Imperial Territory of Alsace–Lorraine (), was a territory of the German Empire, located in modern-day France. It was established in 1871 by the German Empire after it had occupied the region during the Franco-Prussian War. The region was officially ceded to the German Empire in the Treaty of Frankfurt. French resentment about the loss of the territory was one of the contributing factors to World War I. Alsace–Lorraine was formally ceded back to France in 1920 as part of the Treaty of Versailles following Germany&#x27;s defeat in the war, but already annexed in practice at the war&#x27;s end in 1918.

Geographically, Alsace–Lorraine encompassed most of Alsace and the Moselle department of Lorraine. The Alsatian part lay in the Rhine Valley on the west bank of the Rhine River, east of the Vosges Mountains; the section initially in Lorraine was in the upper Moselle valley to the north of the Vosges.

The territory encompassed almost all of Alsace (93%) and over a quarter of Lorraine (26%), while the rest of these regions remained parts of France. For historical reasons, specific legal dispositions are still applied in the territory in the form of a &quot;local law in Alsace–Moselle&quot;. Due to its special legal status since reversion to France, the territory has been referred to administratively as Alsace–Moselle. (; or ).

Since 2016, the historical territory has been part of the French administrative region of Grand Est.

==Geography==
Alsace–Lorraine had a land area of . Its capital was Straßburg. It was divided into three districts ( in German):
* Oberelsaß (Upper Alsace), whose capital was Kolmar, had a land area of and corresponds precisely to the current department of Haut-Rhin
* Unterelsaß, (Lower Alsace), whose capital was Strassburg, had a land area of and corresponds precisely to the current department of Bas-Rhin
* Bezirk Lothringen, (Lorraine), whose capital was Metz, had a land area of and corresponded precisely to the current department of Moselle

===Towns and cities===
The largest urban areas in Alsace–Lorraine at the 1910 census were:
* Strassburg: (now &quot;Strasbourg&quot;): 220,883 inhabitants
* Mülhausen: (&quot;Mulhouse&quot;): 128,190 inhabitants
* Metz: 102,787 inhabitants
* Diedenhofen: (&quot;Thionville&quot;): 69,693 inhabitants
* Colmar: 44,942 inhabitants

==History==

===Background===
The modern history of Alsace–Lorraine was primarily influenced by the rivalry between French and German nationalism.

France long sought to attain and then preserve what it considered to be its &quot;natural boundaries&quot;, which is regarded as the Pyrenees to the southwest, the Alps to the southeast, and the Rhine to the northeast. These strategic claims led to annexing territories west of the Rhine in the Holy Roman Empire. What is now known as Alsace was progressively conquered by France under and in the 17th century, while Lorraine was incorporated from the 16th century under Henry II to the 18th century under (in the case of the Three Bishoprics, as early as 1552). These border changes at the time meant more or less that one ruler (the local princes and city governments, with some remaining power of the Holy Roman Emperor) was exchanged for another (the King of France).

German nationalism, on the other hand, which in its 19th century form originated as a reaction against the French occupation of large areas of Germany under Napoleon, sought to unify all the German-speaking populations of the former Holy Roman Empire into a single nation-state. As various German dialects were spoken by most of the population of Alsace and Moselle (northern Lorraine), these regions were viewed by German nationalists to be rightfully part of a hoped-for united Germany in the future, despite what the French parts of their population wanted.


=== From annexation to World War I ===
==== Annexation considerations ====
In 1871, the newly created German Empire&#x27;s demand for Alsace from France after its victory in the Franco-Prussian War was not simply a punitive measure. The transfer was controversial even among the Germans: The German chancellor, Otto von Bismarck, was initially opposed to it, as he thought (correctly) that it would engender permanent French hostility toward Germany. Some German industrialists did not want the competition from Alsatian industries, such as the cloth makers who would be exposed to competition from the sizeable industry in Mulhouse. Karl Marx also warned his fellow Germans:
: &quot;If Alsace and Lorraine are taken, then France will later make war on Germany in conjunction with Russia. It is unnecessary to go into the unholy consequences.&quot;

Bismarck and the South German industrialists proposed to have Alsace ceded to Switzerland, while Switzerland would compensate Germany with another territory. The Swiss rejected the proposal, preferring to remain neutral between the French and Germans.

The German Emperor, Wilhelm I, eventually sided with army commander Helmuth von Moltke, other Prussian generals and other officials who argued that a westward shift in the French border was necessary for strategic military and ethnographic reasons. From a linguistic perspective, the transfer involved people who for the most part spoke Alemannic German dialects. At the time, ethnic identity was often based primarily on language, unlike today&#x27;s more multifaceted approach focusing on self-identification. From a military perspective, by early 1870s standards, shifting the frontier away from the Rhine would give the Germans a strategic buffer against feared future French attacks. Due to the annexation, the Germans gained control of the fortifications of Metz and Strasbourg (Strassburg) on the left bank of the Rhine and most of the iron resources of Lorraine.

The possibility of granting Alsace–Lorraine the status of a constituent state of the German Empire with its own sovereign and constitution was not considered, in part because Prussia was convinced that the population of the territory would first have to be Germanized, i.e., accustomed to the new German-Prussian form of government. The Imperial Territory () created on 28 June 1871 was therefore treated initially as an occupied territory and administered directly by an imperial governor () appointed by Wilhelm I. Although it was not technically part of the Kingdom of Prussia, in practical terms, it amounted to the same thing since the emperor was also king of Prussia and the chancellor its minister-president.

Memory of the Napoleonic Wars was still fresh in the 1870s. Wilhelm I himself had had to flee with the Prussian royal family to East Prussia as a nine-year-old in 1806 and had served in the Battle of Waterloo. Until the Franco-Prussian War, the French had maintained a long-standing desire to establish their entire eastern frontier on the Rhine. Thus, most 19th-century Germans viewed them as aggressive and acquisitive people. In the years before 1870, the Germans feared the French more than the French feared the Germans. Many Germans at the time thought that the unification of Germany as the new Empire would in itself be enough to earn permanent French enmity and thus desired a defensible border with their long-standing enemy. Any additional hostility earned from territorial concessions was downplayed as marginal and insignificant in the scheme.

==== Area annexed ====
The annexed area consisted of the northern part of Lorraine and Alsace.
* The area around the town of Belfort (now the French Territoire de Belfort) was not annexed. The town&#x27;s heroic defence led by Colonel Denfert-Rochereau, who surrendered only after receiving orders from Paris, allowed President Adolphe Thiers to negotiate retention of the Belfort region.
* The town of Montbéliard and its surrounding area to the south of Belfort, which have been part of the Doubs department since 1816 and therefore were not considered part of Alsace, were not included, even though they had been a Protestant enclave (County of Montbéliard) belonging to Württemberg from 1397 to 1796.

This area corresponded to the present French of Bas-Rhin (in its entirety), Haut-Rhin (except the area of Belfort and Montbéliard), and a small northeast section of the Vosges département, all of which made up Alsace, and most of the of Moselle (four-fifths of Moselle) and the northeast of Meurthe (one-third of Meurthe), which were the eastern part of Lorraine.

The remaining two-thirds of the département of Meurthe and the westernmost one-fifth of Moselle, which had escaped German annexation, were joined to form the new French of Meurthe-et-Moselle.

The new border between France and Germany mainly followed the geo-linguistic divide between French and German dialects, except in a few valleys of the Alsatian side of the Vosges mountains, the city of Metz and its region and in the area of Château-Salins (formerly in the Meurthe ), which were annexed by Germany although most people there spoke French. In 1900, 11.6% of the population of Alsace–Lorraine spoke French as their first language (11.0% in 1905, 10.9% in 1910).

That small francophone areas were affected was used in France to denounce the new border, since Germany had justified the annexation on linguistic grounds. The German administration was tolerant of the use of the French language (in sharp contrast to the use of the Polish language in the Province of Posen), and French was permitted as an official language and school language in those areas where it was spoken by a majority. This changed in 1914 with the First World War.

==== Citizenship option ====

Under the provisions of the Treaty of Frankfurt, the inhabitants of the annexed areas received Alsace–Lorraine citizenship unless they had migrated directly from France. Until 1 October 1872, they had the option of retaining French citizenship. A total of 160,878 people, or about 10.4% of the total population, took the option. The proportion was particularly high in Upper Alsace, where 93,109 people (20.3%) declared that they wished to retain French citizenship, and much lower in Lower Alsace (6.5%) and Lorraine (5.8%).

Originally it was envisaged that those who chose French citizenship would have to leave Alsace–Lorraine. They were allowed to either take their property with them or sell it. Ultimately only about 50,000 people left for France, corresponding to 3.2% of the population of Alsace–Lorraine. The approximately 110,000 optants who had not emigrated by 1 October 1872 lost their option of French citizenship, although they were not expelled by the German authorities but retained German citizenship. Some estimates of the total number of optants, however, are as high as 280,000, with the number who left for France set at about 130,000.

==== Government ====

===== Territorial Committee =====
After the Franco-Prussian War, Alsace–Lorraine was directly annexed to the German Empire as an imperial territory and was not a state in its own right. It was not until the decree of Emperor Wilhelm I on 29 October 1874 that a popular representation was established, the Territorial Committee (). The members of the Territorial Committee were not elected by the people but appointed by the district assemblies (). The three district assemblies for Lorraine, Upper Alsace and Lower Alsace each appointed ten members. In 1879 the Territorial Committee was enlarged to 58 members who were indirectly elected by the district assemblies (Lorraine 11, Upper Alsace 10, Lower Alsace 13), the autonomous cities (1 member each from Strassburg, Mülhausen, Metz and Colmar) and the counties (20 members). Initially the Territorial Committee had only an advisory function. In 1877 it was granted a legislative function and the right to create a budget. From 1879 it was allowed to initiate legislation, although the Bundesrat in Berlin had to approve the laws before they were formally enacted by the emperor. Also in 1879, the office of imperial governor in Alsace–Lorraine () was introduced. He represented the Imperial Territory on behalf of the emperor. The state secretary of the Imperial Office for Alsace–Lorraine headed the government of the Territory.

On 22 June 1877, Eduard von Moeller, the first governor of Alsace–Lorraine, decreed that 90 place names in the district of Lorraine were to be changed from their French to the German forms.

===== Imperial governors 1871–1918 =====
===== State parliament =====
When the constitution of the Imperial Territory of Alsace–Lorraine of 31 May 1911 was enacted, a directly elected state parliament () replaced the Territorial Committee. Alsace–Lorraine was granted its own constitution, a freely elected parliament and three representatives in the Bundesrat, the German federal council. Since the Bundesrat represented the interests of the states in Berlin, the members from each state were required to vote as a bloc. In Alsace–Lorraine, the governor determined how its three representatives voted. The votes were not counted if they gave an otherwise defeated Prussian motion a majority.

The introduction of an upper house in parliament was criticized across party lines in Alsace–Lorraine. While upper houses had historical reasons in the other parts of Germany, there was no noble class in Alsace–Lorraine to be integrated in an upper house. It was thus a purely honorary body. The emperor&#x27;s right to appoint members was particularly criticised.

The upper house was composed of representatives of the major religious communities (Catholics, Lutherans, Protestant Reformed and Jews), the chambers of agriculture and commerce, the trade unions, the judiciary, the cities of Strassburg, Metz, Mülhausen and Colmar, and the University of Strassburg. There were also 18 members appointed by the emperor at the recommendation of the Bundesrat.

The lower house consisted of 60 deputies who were elected for a term of three years by majority vote in the 60 electoral districts. It was called the &quot;People&#x27;s Parliament&quot; () in distinction to the upper house, which consisted of notables. The minimum age for eligibility was 25. Male citizens aged 25 and over had the right to vote.

For the late nineteenth century, the constitution was both conservative in defining the first chamber and progressive in the universal and equal manhood suffrage for electing the second chamber. The representation of trade unions in the first chamber was also remarkable since they were not yet legally recognized as workers&#x27; representatives. The first and only elections to the parliament of the Imperial Territory took place on 22 and 29 October 1911. The strongest parties were the Alsatian Centre and the Social Democrats with 31.0% and 23.8% of the vote respectively, followed by the Lorraine Autonomists with 16.3%.

===== National =====
In 1874, Alsace–Lorraine was granted 15 seats in the German Reichstag. Between 6 and 10 of the 15 Alsatian–Lorraine deputies elected in each of the Reichstag elections from 1874 through 1887 were counted as &quot;Protest Deputies&quot; because of their opposition to the annexation. Shortly after the 1874 election, the Protesters introduced a French-language motion in the Reichstag requesting that a plebiscite be held on the Imperial Territory&#x27;s state affiliation: &quot;May it please the Reichstag to decide that the population of Alsace–Lorraine, which has been incorporated into the German Empire by the Treaty of Frankfurt without having been consulted, be called upon to express its opinion on this annexation.&quot; The motion was rejected by a large majority in the Reichstag. The population was also not asked for its opinion on state affiliation in 1918 when it returned to France.The Protesters rejected both cooperation with the German authorities and constructive political work in the Reichstag. They did not attend its sessions after their election (some Lorraine deputies were not able to do so because of their lack of command of German). There were also people in political life who, for various motives, pleaded for an &quot;attitude of reason&quot;. The so-called Autonomists were more or less either pro-German or pro-French and strove for a local autonomy of the Imperial Territory that was as far-reaching as possible.

The Protestant minority population voted predominantly for the Autonomists from the 1877 Reichstag election onwards. Over time, however, the population of Alsace–Lorraine turned more and more to the German parties, such as Catholics to the Centre Party, the Protestant bourgeoisie to the Liberals and Conservatives, and the emerging working class to the Social Democrats. The Protesters no longer played a significant role after the election of 1890.

====== Reichstag elections 1874–1912 ======
The majority of Alsace–Lorraine&#x27;s inhabitants were sceptical of the German Empire during the first two decades and voted for regional parties (Alsace–Lorraine Protesters and Autonomists). After Chancellor Bismarck&#x27;s dismissal in 1890, the party landscape loosened, and parties of the Empire (Social Democrats, Centre, National Liberals, Left Liberals and Conservatives) found more and more supporters. In the countryside and the predominantly French-speaking electoral districts of Lorraine, the Autonomists remained strong, while in the cities, especially Strassburg, they increasingly played only a subordinate role, with the Social Democrats dominating.

The election results, showing the percentage of votes and the number of seats won (in parentheses), were as follows:
==== Flags ====

The flag used officially in the Imperial Territory was the black-white-red flag of the German Empire. A modified imperial service flag of the Foreign Office was adopted on 29 December 1892 for use at state institutions in Alsace–Lorraine. It was the imperial tri-colour with the imperial eagle in the centre and the crowned escutcheon of Alsace–Lorraine in the upper left corner.

On 25 June 1912, the parliament of the Imperial Territory unanimously approved the proposal for a state flag consisting of the red and white striped flag of Alsace bearing a yellow Lorraine cross in the upper left corner. The decision to adopt the flag was never implemented by government authorities in Berlin. The flag was often raised privately and on semi-official occasions. It was not welcomed by German authorities and the military but was tolerated in part even in wartime. It was also used as the flag of the independent Republic of Alsace–Lorraine of 12 November 1918 to 21 November 1918.

Unofficially, the traditional red and white territorial flag was popular in Alsace and was often used decoratively and as a postcard motif. It was also sometimes taken as a sign of protest against the German annexation.

==== The military ====
In the decades after 1871, the fortress of Metz was expanded under German rule to become the largest fortification in the world, with a ring of outworks, some of which were located far in advance of the fortifications themselves. Metz became a majority German-speaking city due to the influx of military personnel and other immigrants from the rest of Germany.

When the German Army was formed after the foundation of the Empire, the XV Prussian Army Corps was created from existing troops. The corps&#x27; district was the new &quot;Border Region&quot; Alsace–Lorraine, as was that of the XVI Army Corps, which was formed in 1890. The southern regions of the Imperial Territory belonged to the districts of the XIV Army Corps, which was made up in 1871 of troops from Baden. From 1912, the northeastern regions belonged to the XXI Army Corps.

The recruiting districts of the corps were outside Alsace–Lorraine, as was the case with the Upper and Lower Alsatian and Lorraine regiments that were established later within the corps as part of army enlargements. The corps were not always stationed in the Imperial Territory. Alsatians and Lorrainers who were called up for military service were distributed among all Prussian Army units, as were active and passive social democrats, who were also considered to be politically unreliable. It was not until 1903 that a quarter of Alsatian recruits were assigned on a trial basis to troops stationed in their native region.In 1910, 4.3% of the local population – about 80,000 men – were military personnel, which made Alsace–Lorraine the region in Germany with the highest concentration of troops.

At the end of 1913, protests broke out in the Alsatian town of Zabern, where two battalions of Prussian infantry were stationed. A young German lieutenant insulted the Alsatian population in a speech to soldiers and called for rebellious Alsatians to be stabbed. In what came to be known as the Zabern Affair, the military reacted to the protests with arbitrary acts that were not covered by law. The assaults led to a Reichstag debate on the militaristic structures of German society and strained the relations between Alsace–Lorraine and the rest of Germany.

==== Economy and culture ====

Planning began in 1871 for a strategic railway line from Berlin to Metz in order to integrate the new Imperial Territory militarily and strategically. The &quot;cannon railway&quot; was completed in the 1870s. The railways of the private French Eastern Railway Company (&quot;Compagnie des Chemins de Fer de l&#x27;Est&quot;) – a total of 740 km of lines – were bought by the French state and then sold to Germany for 260 million gold marks. The purchase price was offset against the war compensation to be paid by France. The Imperial Railways in Alsace–Lorraine was the first railway owned by the German Reich.

Until the First World War, the Imperial Territory experienced a great economic boom, and many new socio-political benefits such as social security and health insurance were introduced in line with developments in the rest of the German Empire.

In 1872, the University of Strassburg was re-founded and in 1877 given the name &quot;Emperor Wilhelm University&quot; (after Emperor Wilhelm I). Through generous expansion measures, it developed into one of the largest universities in the Empire. Professional training in Alsace developed as a result of stimuli from Germany. The German administration promoted the education of young Alsatian artists at German universities and academies, giving rise to the Cercle de Saint-Léonard, an artists&#x27; association that sought to combine German and Alsatian art.

==== Religion and its role in popular attitudes to the annexation ====
Although the proportion of native speakers of German dialects in the new Imperial Territory was around 90%, Catholics in Alsace–Lorraine tended initially to be sceptical about the ethnographic unification with Germany, which had come about under the leadership of predominately Protestant Prussia. While the Catholics frequently identified with the French Catholic state and feared disadvantage in Prussian hands, the local Protestants were in favour of becoming part of Germany. The Evangelical Lutheran Church professed allegiance to Germany, hoping to reduce French-influenced Catholic &quot;paternalism&quot;. The rural population in particular supported their efforts, while quite a few critics of unification spoke out in the cities of Strassburg and Mülhausen.
After the &quot;Kulturkampf&quot; – the conflict between the state and the Catholic Church driven by Chancellor Otto von Bismarck – reached Alsace–Lorraine in 1872/73, the Catholic Church became a vehicle of resistance against the German authorities. In all of the Reichstag elections from 1874 to 1912, between three and seven of the 15 Alsace–Lorraine deputies were Catholic priests. The dispute reached a climax when, on 3 August 1873, a pastoral letter from the Bishop of Nancy-Toul calling for prayers for the reunification of Alsace–Lorraine with France was read in the Alsace–Lorraine districts of Château-Salins and Saarburg, which still belonged to his diocese. The German authorities reacted with police measures, arrests and disciplinary proceedings as well as a ban on the Catholic press.

After the beginning of the 20th century, opposition to German authorities played hardly any role. There were no longer major social groups that advocated a return to France. The Protestants traditionally had a positive image of Germany, while after the Dreyfus affair, the Jewish population regarded France with extreme suspicion. Catholics also turned away from France. The rise of socialism there permanently unsettled Catholic sentiments in Alsace–Lorraine. France&#x27;s laicist policy from 1905 onwards (Law on the Separation of the Churches and the State) also led to alienation from France in Catholic circles. Germany had granted the region significantly more freedom, and the region&#x27;s economic situation had developed positively. Especially the younger inhabitants who no longer had any contact with France saw themselves as Germans as a matter of course.

====During World War I====
In French foreign policy, the demand for the return of Alsace and Lorraine faded in importance after 1880 with the decline of the monarchist element. When World War I broke out in 1914, recovery of the two lost provinces became the top French war goal.

The increased militarization of Europe and the lack of negotiations between major powers led to harsh and rash actions taken by both sides in respect to Alsace–Lorraine during World War I. As soon as war was declared, both the French and German authorities used the inhabitants of Alsace–Lorraine as propaganda pawns.

Germans living in France were arrested and placed into camps by French authorities. When the French army occupied certain villages, veterans of the 1870 conflict were sought out and arrested.

The Germans responded to the outbreak of war with harsh measures against the Alsace–Lorraine populace. The Zabern Affair had convinced the high command that the population was hostile to the German Empire and that it should be forced into submission. German troops occupied some homes. The German military feared that French partisans – or &quot;francs-tireurs&quot;, as they had been called during the Franco-Prussian War – would reappear.

German authorities developed policies aimed at reducing the influence of French. In Metz, French street names, which had been displayed in French and German, were suppressed in January 1915. Six months later, on 15 July 1915, German became the only official language in the region, leading to the Germanization of the towns&#x27; names effective 2 September 1915.

Prohibiting the speaking of French in public further increased the exasperation of some of the natives, who were long accustomed to mixing their conversation with French language (see code-switching); still, the use even of one word, as innocent as &quot;bonjour&quot;, could incur a fine. Some ethnic Germans in the region cooperated in the persecution as a way to demonstrate German patriotism.

German authorities became increasingly worried about renewed French nationalism. The governor stated in February 1918: &quot;Sympathies towards France and repulsion for Germans have penetrated to a frightening depth the petty bourgeoisie and the peasantry.&quot; But in order to spare them possible confrontations with relatives in France and also to avoid any desertion of Alsatian soldiers to the French army, German Army draftees from Alsace–Lorraine were sent mainly to the Eastern front or to the Navy (). About 15,000 Alsatians and Lorrainers served in the German Navy.

===Annexation to the French Republic===
In the general revolutionary atmosphere of the expiring German Empire, Marxist councils of workers and soldiers () formed in Mulhouse, Colmar, and Strasbourg in November 1918, in imitation of the &quot;soviets&quot; of revolutionary Russia, and in parallel to other such bodies set up in Germany.

In this chaotic situation, Alsace–Lorraine&#x27;s state parliament proclaimed itself the supreme authority of the land with the name of , the Strasbourg Soviet proclaimed the foundation of a &quot;Republic of Alsace–Lorraine&quot;, and Jacques Peirotes, the SPD Reichstag representative for Colmar, announced the establishment of French rule, urging Paris to send troops quickly.

The soviet councils disbanded themselves with the departure of the German troops between 11 and 17 November. The arrival of the French Army stabilized the situation: French troops put the region under military occupation and entered Strasbourg on 5 November. The &quot;Nationalrat&quot; proclaimed the annexation of Alsace to France on 5 December, but the action was not internationally recognized until the Treaty of Versailles was concluded in 1919.

France divided Alsace–Lorraine into the &quot;départements&quot; of Haut-Rhin, Bas-Rhin, and Moselle (the same political structure as before the annexation and as created by the French Revolution, with slightly different limits). Even today, laws in the three regions are somewhat different from the rest of France. The specific provisions are known as the &quot;local law in Alsace–Moselle&quot;.

The &quot;département&quot; Meurthe-et-Moselle was maintained even after France recovered Alsace–Lorraine in 1919. The area of Belfort became a special status area and was not reintegrated into Haut-Rhin in 1919 but instead was made a full status &quot;département&quot; in 1922 under the name Territoire-de-Belfort.

The French government immediately started a Francization campaign that included the forced deportation of all Germans who had settled in the area after 1870. For that purpose, the population was divided in four categories:  (French citizens before 1870),  (descendants of such French citizens),  (citizens of Allied or neutral states), and  (enemy aliens – Germans). By July 1921, 111,915 people categorized as &quot;&quot; were expelled to Germany. All place names were gallicized (e.g., Strassburg → Strasbourg, Mülhausen → Mulhouse, Schlettstadt → Sélestat, etc.).

===World War II===

====Evacuation and deportations====
On 1 September 1939, the day World War II started, residents of Alsace and Moselle living in the Franco-German border region were evacuated. This comprised about one third of the population of Alsace and Moselle, or about 600,000 residents. The evacuation was aimed at providing space for military operations and for protecting citizens from attack. The evacuees were allowed to return in July 1940, after France surrendered to Germany.

The area then came under German occupation. Nazi laws against homosexuality were applied to Alsace–Moselle, and homosexuals were deported. The Nazis also deported refugee and resident Jews.

====German control and the Malgré-nous====
After the defeat of France in the spring of 1940, Alsace and Moselle were not formally annexed by Nazi Germany. Although the terms of the armistice specified that the integrity of the whole French territory could not be modified in any way, Adolf Hitler, the German Führer, drafted an annexation law in 1940 that he kept secret, expecting to announce it in the event of a German victory. Through a series of laws which individually seemed minor, Berlin took de facto control of Alsace–Lorraine, and Alsatians–Lorrainians could be drafted into the German Army. During the occupation, Moselle was integrated into a Reichsgau named Westmark and Alsace was amalgamated with Baden. Beginning in 1942, people from Alsace and Moselle were made German citizens by decree of the Nazi government.

Beginning in October 1942, young Alsatian and Lorrainian men were inducted into the German armed forces. Sometimes they were known as the , which could be translated into English as &quot;against our will&quot;. A small minority volunteered, notably the author of &quot;The Forgotten Soldier&quot;, known by the pseudonym Guy Sajer. Ultimately 100,000 Alsatians and 30,000 Mosellans were enrolled, many of them to fight against the Soviet Red Army, on Germany&#x27;s Eastern Front. Most of those who survived the war were interned in Tambov in Russia in 1945. Many others fought in Normandy against the Allies as the of the 2nd SS Panzer Division Das Reich, some of whom were involved in the Oradour sur Glane and Tulle war crimes.

Speaking French was prohibited under German occupation, and learning standard German was obligatory.

===Languages used===

====Currently====
The German-linked Alsatian dialect remains the lingua franca of the region, although perhaps used more by older people. Both French and German are taught in the schools.

====First language use historically (1900)====
* German and Germanic dialects: 1,492,347 (86.8%)
* Other languages: 219,638 (12.8%)
** French and Romance dialects: 198,318 (11.5%)
** Italian: 18,750 (1.1%)
** German and a second language: 7,485 (0.4%)
** Polish: 1,410 (0.1%)

===Religion===
When Alsace and the Lorraine department became part of Germany, the French laws regarding religious bodies were preserved, with special privileges to the then recognised religions of Calvinism, Judaism, Lutheranism and Roman Catholicism, under a system known as the Concordat. However, the Roman Catholic dioceses of Metz and of Strasbourg became exempt jurisdictions. The Church of Augsburg Confession of France, with its directory, supreme consistory and the bulk of its parishioners residing in Alsace, was reorganised as the Protestant Church of Augsburg Confession of Alsace and Lorraine (EPCAAL) in 1872, but territorially confined to Alsace–Lorraine only. The five local Calvinist consistories, originally part of the Reformed Church of France, formed a statewide synod in 1895, the Protestant Reformed Church of Alsace and Lorraine (EPRAL). The three Israelite consistories in , and were disentangled from supervision by the Israelite Central Consistory of France and continued as separate statutory corporations which never formed a joint body, but cooperated. All the mentioned religious bodies retained the status as &quot;établissements publics de culte&quot; (public bodies of religion). When the new Alsace–Lorraine constitution of 1911 provided for a bicameral state parliament (), each recognised religion was entitled to send a representative into the first chamber of the Landtag as ex officio members (the bishops of Strasbourg and of Metz, the presidents of EPCAAL and EPRAL, and a delegate of the three Israelite consistories).

====Religious statistics in 1910====
Population 1,874,014:
* Catholic: 76.22%
* Protestant: 21.78% (18.87% Lutherans, 2.91% Calvinists)
* Jewish: 1.63%
* Other Christian: 0.21%
* Atheist: 0.12%

===Statistics (1866–2018)===
===Languages===

Both Germanic and Romance dialects were traditionally spoken in Alsace–Lorraine before the 20th century.

Germanic dialects:
* Central German dialects:
** Luxembourgish Franconian aka Luxembourgish in the north-west of Moselle (&quot;Lothringen&quot;) around Thionville (&quot;Diddenuewen&quot; in the local Luxembourgish dialect) and Sierck-les-Bains (&quot;Siirk&quot; in the local Luxembourgish dialect).
** Moselle Franconian in the central northern part of Moselle around Boulay-Moselle (&quot;Bolchin&quot; in the local Moselle Franconian dialect) and Bouzonville (&quot;Busendroff&quot; in the local Moselle Franconian dialect).
** Rhine Franconian in the north-east of Moselle around Forbach (&quot;Fuerboch&quot; in the local Rhine Franconian dialect), Bitche (&quot;Bitsch&quot; in the local Rhine Franconian dialect), and Sarrebourg (&quot;Saarbuerj&quot; in the local Rhine Franconian dialect), as well as in the north-west of Alsace around Sarre-Union (&quot;Buckenum&quot; in the local Rhine Franconian dialect) and La Petite-Pierre (&quot;Lítzelstain&quot; in the local Rhine Franconian dialect).
* Transitional between Central German and Upper German:
** South Franconian in the northernmost part of Alsace around Wissembourg (&quot;Waisseburch&quot; in the local South Franconian dialect).
* Upper German dialects:
** Alsatian in the largest part of Alsace and in a few villages around Phalsbourg in the extreme south-east of Moselle. Alsatian was the most spoken dialect in Alsace–Lorraine.
** High Alemannic in the southernmost part of Alsace, around Saint-Louis and Ferrette (&quot;Pfirt&quot; in the local High Alemannic dialect).

Romance dialects (belonging to the langues d&#x27;oïl like French):
* Lorrain in roughly the southern half of Moselle, including its capital Metz, as well as in some valleys of the Vosges Mountains in the west of Alsace around Schirmeck and Sainte-Marie-aux-Mines.
* Franc-Comtois in 12 villages in the extreme south-west of Alsace.

<text>Henry Sidgwick (; 31 May 1838 – 28 August 1900) was a British utilitarian philosopher and economist and is best known in philosophy for his utilitarian treatise &quot;The Methods of Ethics&quot;. His work in economics has also had a lasting influence. He was the Knightbridge Professor of Moral Philosophy at the University of Cambridge from 1883 until his death. He was one of the founders and first president of the Society for Psychical Research and a member of the Metaphysical Society and promoted the higher education of women. In 1875, with Millicent Garrett Fawcett, he co-founded Newnham College, a women-only constituent college of the University of Cambridge. It was the second Cambridge college to admit women, after Girton College. In 1856, Sidgwick joined the Cambridge Apostles intellectual secret society.

== Biography ==
Henry Sidgwick was born at Skipton in Yorkshire, where his father, the Reverend W. Sidgwick (died 1841), was headmaster of the local grammar school, Ermysted&#x27;s Grammar School. Henry&#x27;s mother was Mary Sidgwick, née Crofts (1807–79).

Henry Sidgwick was educated at Rugby (where his cousin, subsequently his brother-in-law, Edward White Benson, later Archbishop of Canterbury, was a master), and at Trinity College, Cambridge. While at Trinity, Sidgwick became a member of the Cambridge Apostles. In 1859, he was senior classic, 33rd wrangler, chancellor&#x27;s medallist and Craven scholar. In the same year, he was elected to a fellowship at Trinity and soon afterwards he became a lecturer in classics there, a post he held for ten years. The Sidgwick Site, home to several of the university&#x27;s arts and humanities faculties, is named after him.

In 1869, he exchanged his lectureship in classics for one in moral philosophy, a subject to which he had been turning his attention. In the same year, deciding that he could no longer in good conscience declare himself a member of the Church of England, he resigned his fellowship. He retained his lectureship and in 1881 he was elected an honorary fellow. In 1874 he published &quot;The Methods of Ethics&quot; (6th ed. 1901, containing emendations written just before his death), by common consent a major work, which made his reputation outside the university. John Rawls called it the &quot;first truly academic work in moral theory, modern in both method and spirit&quot;.

In 1875, he was appointed praelector on moral and political philosophy at Trinity, and in 1883 he was elected Knightbridge Professor of Philosophy. In 1885, the religious test having been removed, his college once more elected him to a fellowship on the foundation.

Besides his lecturing and literary labours, Sidgwick took an active part in the business of the university and in many forms of social and philanthropic work. He was a member of the General Board of Studies from its foundation in 1882 to 1899; he was also a member of the Council of the Senate of the Indian Civil Service Board and the Local Examinations and Lectures Syndicate and chairman of the Special Board for Moral Science. While at Cambridge Sidgwick taught a young Bertrand Russell.

A 2004 biography of Sidgwick by Bart Schultz sought to establish that Sidgwick was a lifelong homosexual, but it is unknown whether he ever consummated his inclinations. According to the biographer, Sidgwick struggled internally throughout his life with issues of hypocrisy and openness in connection with his own forbidden desires.

He was one of the founders and first president of the Society for Psychical Research, and was a member of the Metaphysical Society.

He also promoted the higher education of women. He helped to start the higher local examinations for women, and the lectures held at Cambridge in preparation for these. It was at his suggestion and with his help that Anne Clough opened a house of residence for students, which developed into Newnham College, Cambridge. When, in 1880, the North Hall was added, Sidgwick lived there for two years. His wife became principal of the college after Clough&#x27;s death in 1892, and they lived there for the rest of his life. During this whole period, Sidgwick took the deepest interest in the welfare of the college. In politics, he was a liberal and became a Liberal Unionist (a party that later effectively merged with the Conservative party) in 1886.

In 1892 Sidgwick was the president of the second International Congress of Experimental Psychology and delivered the opening address. From the first twelve such international congresses, the International Union of Psychological Science eventually emerged.

Early in 1900 he was forced by ill-health to resign his professorship, and died a few months later. Sidgwick, who died an agnostic, is buried in Terling All Saints Churchyard, Terling, Essex, with his wife.

==Ethics==

Sidgwick summarizes his position in ethics as utilitarianism &quot;on an Intuitional basis&quot;. This reflects, and disputes, the rivalry then felt among British philosophers between the philosophies of utilitarianism and ethical intuitionism, which is illustrated, for example, by John Stuart Mill&#x27;s criticism of ethical intuitionism in the first chapter of his book &quot;Utilitarianism&quot;.

Sidgwick developed this position due to his dissatisfaction with an inconsistency in Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill&#x27;s utilitarianism, between what he labels &quot;psychological hedonism&quot; and &quot;ethical hedonism&quot;. Psychological hedonism states that everyone always will do what is in their self-interest, whereas ethical hedonism states that everyone ought to do what is in the general interest. Sidgwick believed neither Bentham nor Mill had an adequate answer as to how the prescription that someone ought to sacrifice their own interest to the general interest could have any force, given they combined that prescription with the claim that everyone will in fact always pursue their own individual interest. Ethical intuitions, such as those argued for by philosophers such as William Whewell, could, according to Sidgwick, provide the missing force for such normative claims.

For Sidgwick, ethics is about which actions are objectively right. Our knowledge of right and wrong arises from common-sense morality, which lacks a coherent principle at its core. The task of philosophy in general and ethics in particular is not so much to create new knowledge but to systematize existing knowledge. Sidgwick tries to achieve this by formulating &quot;methods of ethics&quot;, which he defines as rational procedures &quot;for determining right conduct in any particular case&quot;. He identifies three methods: &quot;intuitionism&quot;, which involves various independently valid moral principles to determine what ought to be done, and two forms of &quot;hedonism&quot;, in which rightness only depends on the pleasure and pain following from the action. Hedonism is subdivided into &quot;egoistic hedonism&quot;, which only takes the agent&#x27;s own well-being into account, and &quot;universal hedonism&quot; or &quot;utilitarianism&quot;, which is concerned with everyone&#x27;s well-being.

As Sidgwick sees it, one of the central issues of ethics is whether these three methods can be harmonized with each other. Sidgwick argues that this is possible for &quot;intuitionism&quot; and &quot;utilitarianism&quot;. But a full success of this project is impossible since egoism, which he considers as equally rational, cannot be reconciled with utilitarianism unless &quot;religious assumptions&quot; are introduced. Such assumptions, for example, the existence of a personal God who rewards and punishes the agent in the afterlife, could reconcile egoism and utilitarianism. But without them, we have to admit a &quot;dualism of practical reason&quot; that constitutes a &quot;fundamental contradiction&quot; in our moral consciousness.

===Metaethics===
Sidgwick&#x27;s metaethics involve an explicit defence of a non-naturalist form of moral realism. He is committed to moral cognitivism: that moral language is robustly truth-apt, and that moral properties are not reducible to any natural properties. This non-naturalist realism is combined with an ethical intuitionist epistemology to account for the possibility of knowing moral truths.

===Esoteric morality===
Sidgwick is closely, and controversially, associated with &quot;esoteric morality&quot;: the position that a moral system (such as utilitarianism) may be acceptable, but that it is not acceptable for that moral system to be widely taught or accepted.

Bernard Williams would refer to Sidgwickian esoteric utilitarianism as &quot;Government House Utilitarianism&quot; and claim that it reflects the elite British colonialist setting of Sidgwick&#x27;s thought.

===Philosophical legacy===
According to John Rawls, Sidgwick&#x27;s importance to modern ethics rests with two contributions: providing the most sophisticated defence available of utilitarianism in its classical form, and providing in his comparative methodology an exemplar for how ethics is to be researched as an academic subject. Allen Wood describes Sidgwick-inspired comparative methodology as the &quot;standard model&quot; of research methodology among contemporary ethicists.

Despite his importance to contemporary ethicists, Sidgwick&#x27;s reputation as a philosopher fell precipitously in the decades following his death, and he would be regarded as a minor figure in philosophy for a large part of the first half of the 20th century. Bart Schultz argues that this negative assessment is explained by the tastes of groups which would be influential at Cambridge in the years following Sidgwick&#x27;s death: Wittgensteinian ordinary language philosophers, the remnants of British idealism, and, most importantly, the Bloomsbury Group. John Deigh, however, disputes Schultz&#x27;s explanation, and instead attributes this fall in interest in Sidgwick to changing philosophical understandings of axioms in mathematics, which would throw into question whether axiomatization provided an appropriate model for a foundationalist epistemology of the sort Sidgwick tried to build for ethics.

==Economics==

Sidgwick worked in economics at a time when the British economics mainstream was undergoing the transition from the classical economics of Adam Smith, David Ricardo, and John Stuart Mill to the neo-classical economics of William Stanley Jevons and Alfred Marshall. Sidgwick responded to these changes by preferring to emphasize the similarities between the old economics and the new, choosing to base his work on J.S. Mill&#x27;s Principles of Political Economy, incorporating the insights of Jevons.

Sidgwick believed self-interest to be a centrepiece of human motivation. He believed that this self-interest had immense utility in the economic world, and that people should not be blamed for wanting to sell a good for the highest possible price or buy a good for the lowest possible price. He distinguished, though, a difference between the ability of an individual to properly judge their own interests and the ability of a group of people to properly come to a point of maximum group happiness. He found two divergences in the outcomes of the decisions of the individual and of the group. One instance of this is the idea that there is more to life than the accumulation of wealth, so it is not always in the best interest of society to simply aim for wealth-maximizing results. This effect may be due to limitations of the individual, from attributes such as ignorance, immaturity, and disability. This can be a moral judgement, such as the decision to limit the sale of alcohol to an individual out of concern for their well-being. The second instance is the fact that wealth-maximizing outcomes for society are simply not always a possibility when individuals within that society are all attempting to maximize their individual wealth. Contradictions are likely to emerge that cause one individual to a lower maximum wealth due to another individual&#x27;s actions, therefore disallowing the possibility of a society-wide wealth maximization. Problems also are possible to occur due to monopoly.

Sidgwick would have a major influence on the development of welfare economics, due to his own work on the subject inspiring Arthur Cecil Pigou&#x27;s work &quot;The Economics of Welfare&quot;.

Alfred Marshall, founder of the Cambridge School of Economics, would describe Sidgwick as his &quot;spiritual mother and father&quot;.

==Parapsychology==

Sidgwick had a lifelong interest in the paranormal. This interest, combined with his personal struggles with religious belief, motivated his gathering of young colleagues interested in assessing the empirical evidence for paranormal or miraculous phenomena. This gathering would be known as the &quot;Sidgwick Group&quot;, and would be a predecessor of the Society for Psychical Research, which would count Sidgwick as founder and first president.

Sidgwick would connect his concerns with parapsychology to his research in ethics. He believed the dualism of practical reason might be solved outside of philosophical ethics if it were shown, empirically, that the recommendations of rational egoism and utilitarianism coincided due to the reward of moral behaviour after death.

According to Bart Schultz, despite Sidgwick&#x27;s prominent role in institutionalizing parapsychology as a discipline, he had upon it an &quot;overwhelmingly negative, destructive effect, akin to that of recent debunkers of parapsychology&quot;; he and his Sidgwick Group associates became notable for exposing fraud mediums. One such incident was the exposure of the fraud of Eusapia Palladino.

==Religion==

Brought up in the Church of England, Sidgwick drifted away from orthodox Christianity, and as early as 1862 he described himself as a theist, independent from established religion. By 1888, he had rejected theism as a belief, when he co-founded the Cambridge Ethical Society (an early humanist organisation and part of the Union of Ethical Societies), for whom he served as President until 1896. The group&#x27;s motto was ‘&quot;Gedenke zu leben&quot;’: remember to live. For the rest of his life, although he regarded Christianity as &quot;indispensable and irreplaceable... from a sociological point of view&quot;, he found himself unable to return to it as a religion.

<doc id="207003" wikidata="Q2425973" url="?curid=207003" title="The Boy Friend (musical)">
<text>The Boy Friend (sometimes misrepresented The Boyfriend) is a musical by Sandy Wilson. Its original 1953 London production ran for 2,078 performances, briefly making it the third-longest running musical in West End or Broadway history (after &quot;Chu Chin Chow&quot; and &quot;Oklahoma!&quot;) until they were all surpassed by &quot;Salad Days&quot;. &quot;The Boy Friend&quot; marked Julie Andrews&#x27; American stage debut.

Set in the carefree world of the French Riviera in the Roaring Twenties, &quot;The Boy Friend&quot; is a comic pastiche of 1920s shows, in particular early Rodgers and Hart musicals such as &quot;The Girl Friend&quot;. Its relatively small cast and low cost of production makes it a continuing popular choice for amateur and student groups.

Sandy Wilson wrote a sequel to &quot;The Boy Friend&quot;. Set ten years later, and, appropriately, a pastiche of 1930s musicals, in particular those of Cole Porter, it was titled &quot;Divorce Me, Darling!&quot; and ran for 91 performances at London&#x27;s old Globe Theatre in 1965. It is sometimes revived as a &quot;double bill&quot; with &quot;The Boy Friend&quot;.

The original score and manuscripts for the script and lyrics can be found in Wilson&#x27;s archive at the Harry Ransom Center.

==Productions==

===London===
The musical was first performed in London in 1953. It opened at the Players&#x27; Theatre Club on 14 April 1953, and reopened in an expanded version on 13 October. It transferred for a short season to the Embassy Theatre, Swiss Cottage and then opened at Wyndham&#x27;s Theatre in the West End on 14 January 1954. Choreography was by John Heawood. The light, tuneful piece proved immensely popular with the British public, including the Queen, and ran for more than five years, a total of 2,082 performances.

The principal role of Polly Browne was to have been played by Diana Maddox, who fell ill on the afternoon of the final dress rehearsal. Anne Rogers (at that point playing a minor role) volunteered to take over, having learnt the role on her own. The show opened the following evening and made an overnight star of Rogers, who stayed with the production through its expanded versions to the triumphant West End first night at Wyndham&#x27;s. The cast also included Hugh Paddick in his first leading West End role as Percival Browne, Joan Sterndale-Bennett as Madam Dubonnet, and Violetta Farjeon as Hortense.

===Broadway===
&quot;The Boy Friend&quot; opened on Broadway at the Royale Theatre on 30 September 1954, and closed on 26 November 1955 after 485 performances. Starring was newcomer Julie Andrews in her Broadway debut as Polly, with a cast including Eric Berry, John Hewer, Geoffrey Hibbert, Dilys Laye, Bob Scheerer, Stella Claire, Ann Wakefield, Millicent Martin and Moyna Macgill. Some of them had connections with The Players&#x27; Theatre in London, but only Wakefield had appeared in the show&#x27;s London production (in the very first run at the Players&#x27;). For the Broadway opening, veteran orchestrator Ted Royal and jazzman Charles L. Cooke contributed 1920s-style arrangements.

For her Broadway debut, Andrews received the Theatre World Award. &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; producers saw her in this piece, prompting her casting in the lead in that production, which led to her wider fame on Broadway and beyond in the following years. Jo Anne Bayless (known as Jean Bayless in London) played Polly for the final three months of the Broadway production and reprised the role on the subsequent US tour.

=== Broadway revival ===
A revival directed by Gus Schirmer opened on Broadway at the Ambassador Theatre on 14 April 1970, and ran for 111 performances. Starring were Judy Carne as Polly, Sandy Duncan as Maisie, Ronald Young as Tony, Jeanne Beauvais as Madame Dubonnet, Leon Shaw as Percival Browne, Simon McQueen as Dulcie, Harvey Evans as Bobby Van Husen, David Vaughn as Lord Brockhurst, Barbara Andres as Hortense and Marie Paxton as Lady Brockhurst. Duncan received a Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Performance and was nominated for a Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical.

=== West End revival ===
1984 saw Cameron Macintosh&#x27;s 30th anniversary production opened at The Churchill Theatre in Bromley. Directed by its creator, Sandy Wilson, it starred Glynis Johns as Madam Dubonett and Derek Waring as Percival Browne. It transferred to The Old Vic Theatre (London) then The Ed Mirvish Theatre (Toronto) before starting a West End run at The Albery Theatre in St Martins Lane. Glynis Johns was replaced by Anna Quayle when it reached the West End.

===International productions===
On 29 November 1967, a new production opened at the Comedy Theatre, directed by Sandy Wilson and co-produced by Michael Codron and the Yvonne Arnaud Theatre. It starred Tony Adams as Tony, Frances Barlow as Maisie, Marion Grimaldi as Mdm Dubonnet, Jeremy Hawk as Percival Browne, Geoffrey Hibbert as Lord Brockhurst, Celia Helda as Lady Brockhurst, Cheryl Kennedy as Polly Browne. It closed on 12 October 1968 after 365 performances.

In 1995, on its 40th anniversary, the musical returned to The Players&#x27; Theatre in London in a new production that was as near a reproduction of the original as possible. It was directed by Maria Charles, who had played the original Dulcie. The choreography was by Geoffrey Webb who was also in the original production. It was originally planned that the choreography would be done by Larry Drew, the original Bobby van Husen, but he died suddenly during the early planning stages of the production. Set design was by Disley Jones, who was responsible for the hat designs in the original production. Among the cast were Gemma Page, Oliver Hickey, Sophie Louise Dann and John Rutland, in his original role as Lord Brockhurst. Following its success at the Players&#x27; it went on a very successful nationwide tour.

In 2003, Julie Andrews made her directorial debut with a production of &quot;The Boy Friend&quot; at the Bay Street Theater in Sag Harbor, NY, starring Meredith Patterson as Polly Browne and Sean Palmer as Tony Brockhurst.

This production was staged at the Goodspeed Opera House, running from July 2005 through 24 September 2005. Sean Palmer returned as Tony and Jessica Grové took over the role of Polly after Meredith Patterson was unable to perform the part due to scheduling conflicts with her new role in &quot;Irving Berlin&#x27;s White Christmas&quot;. Costume and scenic design were by Tony Walton, with choreography by John DeLuca. The show had two acts instead of three, and the song &quot;Safety in Numbers&quot; was moved from the scene on the beach to the Carnival Ball. The production then toured the United States and Canada, playing 11 cities, including Chicago, Boston, Orange County, and Toronto, from October 2005 through March 2006. The touring cast included Bethe Austin as Hortense, Paul Carlin as Percival, Andrea Chamberlain as Maisie, Drew Eshelman as Lord Brockhurst, Rick Faugno as Bobby Van Husen, Nancy Hess as Mme Dubonnet, Darcy Pulliam as Lady Brockhurst, Scott Barnhardt as Alphonse, Andrew Briedis as Pierre, Jordan Cable as Marcel, Margot de La Barre as Nancy, Pamela Otterson as Monica, Krysta Rodriguez as Fay, Eric Daniel Santagata as Phillipe, Tom Souhrada as Garcon, and Kirsten Wyatt as Dulcie.

There was an acclaimed production in 2006 at the Open Air Theatre at Regent&#x27;s Park, London, which was revived during the Open Air Theatre&#x27;s 2007 season.

&quot;The Boy Friend&quot; was the chosen title for the Showtime Challenge 2011 at Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre, London, produced by Eyebrow Productions. Rehearsals took place over a 48-hour period immediately prior to the performance on Sunday 8 May, and all proceeds went to The Prince&#x27;s Foundation for Children and The Arts.

==Plot==
===Act I===
The whole musical is set in the Villa Caprice where Maisie, the girls (Dulcie, Nancy, Fay), Hortense the maid, and Mme Dubonnet live at Mme Dubonnet&#x27;s School for Young Ladies. Act I begins when Hortense orders a costume for &quot;a Miss Polly Browne&quot; and Maisie and the other girls sing the ironic &quot;Perfect Young Ladies&quot; with Hortense. Polly arrives and tells everyone about her made-up boy friend who is &quot;motoring down from Paris&quot; to meet her for the upcoming carnival ball, and sings about &quot;The Boy Friend&quot;. Later, Bobby surprises Maisie, and they dance to &quot;Won&#x27;t You Charleston With Me?&quot;

Polly&#x27;s widowed father Percival arrives at the school to discover that the headmistress, Mme Dubonnet, is an old flame of his. They sing &quot;Fancy Forgetting&quot; to rekindle the spark. Though Polly is a millionaire&#x27;s daughter, she feels left out because she&#x27;s the only one in her crowd who doesn&#x27;t have a boyfriend and she needs a partner for the fancy dress ball. The errand boy, Tony, arrives to deliver her Pierrette costume and they are immediately attracted to each other and sing &quot;I Could Be Happy With You.&quot;

===Act II===
The curtain opens with the chorus number &quot;Sur la Plage&quot;. After this, Polly and Tony meet at the beach and Polly lies that she is not rich, to fit in with Tony. They sing about their future lives together in &quot;A Room in Bloomsbury.&quot; They are about to kiss when Hortense interrupts them and is shocked to find Polly with a poor messenger boy. Polly begs Hortense to keep her secret and Hortense agrees. After Tony and Polly leave, Hortense sings how everything is &quot;Nicer in Nice&quot; with the ensemble. Then the &quot;aging roué&quot; character Lord Brockhurst arrives, leading to a comical meeting with the rigidly-mannered Percival Browne. Lord Brockhurst&#x27;s domineering wife Lady Brockhurst is also introduced. Percival Browne and Mme Dubonnet then sing &quot;The &#x27;You-Don&#x27;t-Want-To-Play-With-Me&#x27; Blues&quot;.

Polly goes to meet Tony on the promenade just as Lord and Lady Brockhurst are passing by, and they recognize him. When he runs off, everyone else assumes that he is a thief. The act ends with a sadder reprise of &quot;I Could be Happy with You&quot; sung by Polly and the other characters.

===Act III===
At the ball, Bobby and the three boys propose to Maisie and the three girls, but the girls reply in unison that &quot;we&#x27;ll let you know at midnight&quot; and everyone dances to &quot;The Riviera&quot;. After everyone has left, Tony and Hortense run into each other. Hortense scolds Tony and tells him to meet Polly at the ball because she loves him as much as he loves her. Tony leaves to prepare for the ball as Lord Brockhurst sings &quot;It&#x27;s Never Too Late To Fall In Love&quot; with the flirty Dulcie, and is caught by Lady Brockhurst. At the Carnival ball, Polly is sad that Tony is not there and she is thinking about leaving. Hortense tells Mme Dubonnet to persuade Polly to stay, so Polly sings &quot;Poor Little Pierrette&quot; with Mme Dubonnet. Tony later arrives at the ball and takes Polly by surprise. He asks &quot;May I have this dance, Pierrette?&quot; to which Polly replies, &quot;I&#x27;m afraid I can&#x27;t dance with a stranger&quot;. He then kisses her to remind her that it is he. When Tony removes his mask, Lord and Lady Brockhurst run to him, exclaiming they found their son at last. Polly and the others discover that Tony is really the son of the rich Lord and Lady Brockhurst, and he had left home to try to make his own way in the world. Polly tells Tony that she is actually rich as well, and Percival and Mme Dubonnet announce that they are getting married. The clock strikes midnight, and the girls unanimously say yes to the boys&#x27; proposals. The last scene has everyone dancing as soon as Bobby, with the last spoken line in the play, asks &quot;So how about that dance?&quot; The show ends with a reprise of &quot;The Boy Friend&quot;, &quot;I Could Be Happy With You&quot;, and &quot;A Room In Bloomsbury&quot;.

== Film version ==

Ken Russell&#x27;s 1971 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film version of the show, starring Twiggy and Christopher Gable, was an alternative interpretation, weaving the basic plot into a more complicated story in which a seaside dramatic company performing the show, is visited by an influential film producer (Vladek Sheybal) on the very night that the leading lady (Glenda Jackson) has to be replaced by the assistant stage manager Polly Browne (Twiggy). The film contains numerous references to the 1930s movie musicals of Busby Berkeley and MGM. It marked one of the final screen appearances of actor/director Max Adrian.

The National Board of Review voted Ken Russell best director, and Twiggy won two Golden Globe awards as best newcomer and best actress (musical/comedy), but the film did not make a significant impact on the American box-office, perhaps because MGM edited it down to 109 minutes. (MGM reissued the full version theatrically in 1987.) It was released to DVD on 12 April 2011, as part of the Warner Archive Collection, a series of made-to-order DVDs. The disc is remastered and is the 136-minute version.

Wilson&#x27;s original score was freely adapted and augmented by Peter Maxwell Davies for the film. Davies subsequently prepared (and recorded) a concert suite based on the music.

== Sequel ==

A sequel musical titled &quot;Divorce Me, Darling!&quot; was created by Sandy Wilson in 1964. The musical is set ten years later after &quot;The Boy Friend&quot;. The original production premiered at The Players&#x27; Theatre in London before moving to the West End&#x27;s Globe Theatre in 1965.

<doc id="207007" wikidata="Q3047406" url="?curid=207007" title="Joseph Blanco White">
<text>Joseph Blanco White, born José María Blanco y Crespo (11 July 1775 – 20 May 1841), was an Anglo-Spanish political thinker, theologian, and poet.

==Life==
Blanco White was born in Seville, Spain. He had Irish ancestry and was the son of the merchant Guillermo Blanco (alias White, an English viceconsul, who had established himself in Seville during the reign of Fernando VI) and María Gertrudis Crespo y Neve.

Blanco White was educated for the Roman Catholic priesthood. In Seville, Spain, he had worked with Melchor de Jovellanos, an adviser to the king who advocated reform. After his ordination in 1800, White&#x27;s religious doubts led him to leave Spain and go to England in 1810. There he ultimately entered the Anglican Church, having studied theology at Oxford and made the friendship of Thomas Arnold, John Henry Newman the Reverend E.T. Daniell and Richard Whately. He became tutor in Whately&#x27;s family when Whately became the Archbishop of Dublin in 1831. While in this position White embraced Unitarian views. He found asylum amongst the Unitarians of Liverpool, and he died in the city on 20 May 1841.

==Pro-Spanish America writings==
Blanco White edited &quot;El Español&quot;, a monthly Spanish magazine in London, from 1810 to 1814, which was strongly for the independence of Spanish America. In its pages, he commented on the course of the insurgency based on information from Spanish America and British sources. The Regency banned it in Spain, since it undermined the pro-Cádiz position on trade, which gave peninsular merchants a monopoly on trade. Juan Bautista Arriaza published a pamphlet against him in London and he suffered other attacks in the Cádiz newspapers; even in the Cortes of Cádiz, in his session of 24 May 1811, he was attacked. Articles in &quot;El Español&quot; were reprinted in the insurgent press. He was not for complete independence for Spanish America, but rather a moderate position. He advocated that the Spanish Cortes (parliament) recognize juntas in Spanish America that remained loyal to the Spanish monarchy after the Napoleon&#x27;s 1808 invasion of Spain and ouster of Bourbon monarch Ferdinand VII and Napoleon&#x27;s placement of his brother Joseph on the throne. He also was in favor of free trade, not just the closed Spanish system of &quot;comercio libre&quot; that allowed free trade ports in Spain with Spanish America and all ports within Spanish America.

==Other works==
His other principal writings include &quot;Doblado&#x27;s Letters from Spain&quot; (1822) (under the pseudonym of &quot;Don Leucado Doblado&quot;, and written in part at Holland House in London), &quot;Evidence against Catholicism&quot; (1825), &quot;Second Travels of an Irish Gentleman in Search of a Religion&quot; (2 vols., 1834) (a riposte to Thomas Moore&#x27;s satirical commentary upon the conceits of the Second Reformation), and &quot;Observations on Heresy and Orthodoxy&quot; (1835). They all show literary ability and were extensively read in their day. He also translated Paley&#x27;s &quot;Evidences&quot; and the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; into Spanish.

White is also remembered for his sonnet &quot;Night and Death&quot; (&quot;Mysterious Night! when our first parent knew&quot;), which was dedicated to Samuel Taylor Coleridge on its appearance in the &quot;Bijou&quot; for 1828 and has since found its way into several anthologies. Three versions are given in the &quot;Academy&quot; of 12 September 1891.

<doc id="207009" wikidata="Q1107167" url="?curid=207009" title="Cohousing">
<text>Cohousing is an intentional, self-governing, cooperative community where residents live in private homes often clustered around shared space. The term originated in Denmark in the late 1960s. Families live in attached or single-family homes with traditional amenities, usually including a private kitchenette. As part of the communal orientation, shared spaces typically feature a common house, which may include a large kitchen and dining area, laundry, and recreational spaces. Walkways, open space, parking, playgrounds and gardens are common examples of shared outdoor spaces designed to promote social interactions. Neighbors also often share resources like tools, babysitting and creative skills.

Neighbors collaboratively plan and manage community activities and shared spaces while maintaining their own income and private lives. The legal structure is typically a homeowner association or housing cooperative, and some use community land trusts. To promote the common good, cohousing members regularly share meals, attend meetings, and participate in community work days. As part of cohousing&#x27;s social nature, neighbors gather for parties, games, gardening, musical performances, movies, sports, and celebrations. Living in cohousing makes it easy for residents to form clubs, organize child and elder care, share information, free cycle and carpool.

Cohousing facilitates interaction among neighbors and thereby provides social, practical, economic, and environmental benefits. With democracy in action in their cohousing community, residents also tend to be more active in civic affairs in the broader community.

== Characteristics ==

Based on active participation by residents, Cohousing communities are usually structured – in principle and often in architecture – to encourage interactions and the formation of rich relationships among their members. Neighbors are encouraged to cooperate within the community and to care for each other. Community involvement is a way of life. So as to promote an interdependent village-like experience where neighbors all know each other, cohousing developments are usually limited to around 20–50 homes and frequently feature large common areas where residents interact. While cohousing developments are designed to encourage community, residents have as much personal privacy as they want. Residents are able to choose how much they engage in order to find the right balance between their privacy and the community. Decision-making in cohousing communities is often based on building a consensus within the community. Residents work together to maintain the shared space which they can all use, usually saving money. At the same time residents manage their own space in ways that appeal to them.

Although most cohousing groups seek to develop multi-generational communities, some are also based on sustainability, others create supportive communities for senior living. Cohousing proponent and architect Charles Durrett wrote a handbook on creating senior cohousing while the cohousing leader and architect Kathryn McCamant created the 500 Communities Program to train professionals to support groups building sustainable cohousing. Although all cohousing communities are intentional—including many ecovillages (such as Sawyer Hill in Massachusetts and Los Angeles Ecovillage in California)--the broader term of intentional communities encompasses alternative forms of living, ranging from communes to ashrams to monasteries which aren&#x27;t always managed collaboratively and don&#x27;t necessarily include the privacy and individual living space of cohousing. The collaborative democracy that distinguishes cohousing generally provides a foundation for a range of beliefs and ways of understanding to flourish, however some cohousing communities are instead based on shared religious beliefs or philosophy.

== Co-living ==

Cohousing can be considered related to co-living as the concepts appear to overlap. Both co-living and cohousing have shared areas that benefit all, such as spaces for events or communal meals. Cohousing provides self-contained private dwellings (often houses but sometimes apartments), often owned by the resident, but sometimes rented. Co-living on the other hand may have independent units within the same building (apartments or rooms), which are often rented. However, none of these are exclusive, thus the potential overlaps. The key distinction is that cohousing embeds collective resident control and stewardship into its legal form and decision making whereas co-living is typically owned and run by external investors or operators, although the owner sometimes also lives in the co-living space.

==Origins==
There are precedents for cohousing with the Siheyuan, or quadrangle design of housing in China which has a shared courtyard and is thus similar in some respects to cohousing. Unlike the utopian movement in 18th and 19th century, the three villages of Arden, Ardentown, and Ardencroft, Delaware founded at the turn of the 20th century as well as Bryn Gweled Homesteads founded in 1940 in Southampton, Pennsylvania incorporate private homes on commonly owned land while promoting cooperative values. These cohousing communities were established in part based on Henry George’s single-tax theory. In the 1920s in New York, the rise of cooperative apartment housing, which now make up over 70% of all homes in Manhattan, similarly incorporate shared facilities, self government and greater social interaction but rarely include prospective residents participation in the design process nor the intentionality of current cohousing. Swedish social scientists and architects advanced common space coupled with private homes, followed by the modernists in the 1930&#x27;s-&#x27;50&#x27;s who spurred the building of many cohousing communities, such as Marieberg in Stockholm.

Distinct from communal living experiments associated with the hippie movement, the modern application of cohousing developed in Denmark in the 1960s among groups of families who were dissatisfied with existing housing and communities that they felt did not meet their needs, particularly in respect to work-life balance. Bodil Graae wrote a newspaper article titled &quot;Children Should Have One Hundred Parents&quot;, spurring a group of 50 families to organize around a community project in 1967. This group split into two groups who developed the cohousing projects Sættedammen and Skråplanet, which are among the oldest known modern cohousing communities. The key organizer was Jan Gudmand Høyer who drew inspiration from his architectural studies at Harvard and interaction with experimental U.S. communities of the era. He published the article &quot;The Missing Link between Utopia and the Dated Single Family House&quot; in 1968, converging a second group.

Self-governing cohousing communities, such as Sharingwood in Washington, N Street in California, Ecovillage at Ithaca and Cantines Island both in New York were built in the &#x27;80&#x27;s and &#x27;90&#x27;s with cooperatively owned space and a social structure that encourages supportive interactions, balanced with privately owned homes, as collaborative alternatives to typical American subdivisions. The Danish term &quot;bofællesskab&quot; (living community) was promoted in North America as &quot;cohousing&quot; by two American architects, Kathryn McCamant and Charles Durrett, who visited several cohousing communities and wrote about what they learned in books with the aim of advancing cohousing development. Building on the success of a few earlier, established cohousing developments, the first community in the United States to be designed, constructed and occupied as cohousing by the McCamant Durrett team is Muir Commons in Davis, California in 1991. In the following decades, their vision of cohousing has become dominant, while communities such as the Hundredfold Farm in Pennsylvania and Genesee Gardens in Michigan represent more expansive models of how families join to form cohousing communities.

==Growth==

Cohousing communities are part of the cooperative economy in the United States and are predicted to expand rapidly in the next few decades as individuals and families seek to live more sustainably, and in community with neighbors. Since the Muir Commons in Davis, California was completed in 1991, more than 160 communities have been established in 25 states plus the District of Columbia, with more than 125 in process. Most cohousing communities are intergenerational with both children and elders; in recent years, senior cohousing focused on older adult needs have grown. These communities are often environmentally friendly and socially sustainable.

Hundreds of cohousing communities exist in Denmark and other countries in northern Europe. In Canada, there are 17 completed communities, and approximately 42 in the forming, development, or construction phase (see The Canadian Cohousing Network). There are more than 300 cohousing communities in the Netherlands (73 mixed-generation and 231 senior cohousing), with about 60 others in planning or construction phases.
There are also communities in Australia, the United Kingdom, New Zealand and other parts of the world.

Cohousing started to develop in the UK at the end of the 1990s. The movement has gradually built up momentum and there are now 14 purpose built cohousing communities (see The UK Cohousing Network. A further 40+ cohousing groups are developing projects and new groups are forming all the time. Cohousing communities in the UK range from around eight households to the largest so far around 50 households. Most communities are mixed communities with single people, couples and families but there is a growing number that are specialist - for people over 50, women or LGBT+ communities. The communities themselves range from new developments built to modern eco standards to conversions of everything from farms to Jacobean mansions to former hospital buildings and are in urban, rural and semi- rural locations.

One of the prominent voices for cohousing in the United States is Grace Kim, a principal of Schemata Workshop architectural firm in Seattle, a founder of Capitol Hill Urban Cohousing in Seattle, and a boardmember of the US Cohousing Association. For Kim, cohousing provides a possible solution to the worldwide problems of loneliness and isolation, through the intentionality of people to live collaboratively. Kim spoke in Vancouver at an April 2017 TED talk on the topic of cohousing, asserting that cohousing can make us happier via an intentionality on relationships that births &quot;communitas&quot;—the spirit of community.

==Design==

Because each cohousing community is planned in its context, cohousing often follows the principles of complementary architecture. A key feature of this model is its flexibility to the needs and values of its residents and the characteristics of the site. Cohousing can be urban, suburban or rural. The physical form is typically compact but varies from low-rise apartments to townhouses to clustered detached houses. They tend to keep cars to the periphery which promotes walking through the community and interacting with neighbors as well as increasing safety for children at play within the community. Shared green space is another typical characteristic, whether for gardening, play, or places to gather. When more land is available than is needed for the physical structures, the structures are usually clustered closely together, leaving as much of the land as possible &quot;open&quot; for shared use. This aspect of cohousing directly addresses the growing problem of suburban sprawl.

In addition to &quot;from-scratch&quot; new-built communities (including those physically retrofitting/re-using existing structures), there are also &quot;retrofit&quot; (aka &quot;organic&quot;) communities, in which neighbors create &quot;intentional neighborhoods&quot; by buying adjacent properties and removing fences. Examples range from N Street Cohousing in Davis, California to Bristol Village in Vermont. Often infill cohousing members create amenities such as common houses after the fact while living there.

Cohousing differs from some types of intentional communities in that the residents do not have a shared economy nor, usually, a common set of beliefs or religion, but instead invest in creating a socially rich and interconnected community. A non-hierarchical structure employing a cooperative decision-making model is how residents usually manage their communities. Some individuals take on leadership roles, such as being responsible for coordinating a garden, developing budgets or facilitating meetings.

==Ownership form==
Most cohousing communities in the U.S. currently rely on one of two existing legal forms of real estate ownership: individually titled houses with common areas owned by a homeowner association (condominiums) or a housing cooperative. Condo ownership is most common because it fits many financial institutions&#x27; and cities&#x27; models for multi-unit owner-occupied housing development. U.S. banks lend more readily on single-family homes and condominiums than housing cooperatives. Charles Durrett points out that rental cohousing is a very likely future model, as it already is being practiced in Europe. In Australia, due to higher legal complexity of cooperatives, cohousing projects are most commonly developed under limited proprietary company with cooperative-like rules.

Cohousing differs from standard condominium development and master-planned subdivisions because the development is designed by, or with considerable input from, its future residents. The design process invariably emphasizes consciously fostering social relationships among its residents. Common facilities are based on the actual needs of the residents, rather than on what a developer thinks will help sell units. Turnover in cohousing developments is typically very low, and there is usually a waiting list for homes to become available.

In Europe the term &quot;joint building ventures&quot; has been coined to define the form of ownership and housing characterized as cohousing. According to the European Urban Knowledge Network (EUKN): &quot;Joint building ventures are a legal federation of persons willing to build who want to create owner-occupied housing and to participate actively in planning and building.&quot;

<text>The second USS &quot;Buffalo&quot; (later AD-8) was an auxiliary cruiser of the United States Navy, and later a destroyer tender.

&quot;Buffalo&quot; was launched on 31 May 1893 by Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company, in Newport News, Virginia, as El Cid for the Southern Pacific Railroad&#x27;s Morgan Line. She was completed in August 1893 and sold to Brazil and renamed &quot;Nictheroy&quot;. Purchased by the Navy from the Brazilian Government on 11 July 1898, she was renamed &quot;Buffalo&quot;, commissioned in ordinary a week later, fitted out as an auxiliary cruiser at New York Navy Yard; and placed in full commission on 22 September 1898, with Lieutenant Commander Joseph Newton Hemphill in command.

==Service history==

===1898–1915===
Her first cruise, from 7 December 1898 to 7 May 1899, was from New York City to Manila and return, sailing east. Upon her return she was placed out of commission on 3 July 1899. On 2 April 1900, she was recommissioned and served as a training vessel. As a training vessel, &quot;Buffalo&quot; traveled widely. She made four voyages to the Philippines with replacement crews for the Asiatic Fleet (24 April – 20 October 1900, 24 December 1900 – 13 May 1901, 5 June – 13 October 1902, and 17 December 1903 – 14 July 1904). All except the last, which terminated at Mare Island, began and ended at east coast ports. On her last voyage, &quot;Buffalo&quot; conveyed the 1st Torpedo Flotilla to Manila. Between 12 September and 23 November 1904 she cruised in the Pacific, returning to Mare Island.

Out of commission at Mare Island from April 1905 to 17 November 1906, she then served as a transport until 1915 in the Pacific. During 17–20 December 1909, she carried Marines to Nicaragua and remained there in support until 16 March 1910. In 1911–12, she served briefly with the Asiatic Fleet in Chinese waters; and then from 14 November through 4 December 1914 operated off Mexico. She spent 27 January through 29 November 1915 out of commission at Mare Island, and then rejoined the Pacific Fleet.

===1916–1927===
In 1916, she again served in Mexican waters, and between May and August 1917, &quot;Buffalo&quot; transported the Special Diplomatic Mission of the United States to Russia. Upon her return she was ordered into Philadelphia Navy Yard for conversion to a destroyer tender and reclassified AD-8. Conversion was completed in June 1918, and after loading torpedo equipment at Newport, Rhode Island, she departed for Brest, France, via Bermuda. She then proceeded to Gibraltar, where she operated as station and repair ship to destroyers and subchasers. From February until September 1919 she had similar duty with the Azores Detachment at Ponta Delgada and then returned to New York.

On 31 December 1919, &quot;Buffalo&quot; arrived at San Diego, California to commence her duties as repair ship and tender to Destroyer Squadrons 5 and 11, Pacific Fleet. In November 1921, she was ordered to the Asiatic Station as tender to Destroyer Squadron, Asiatic Fleet, and arrived at Manila in December. During the summer of 1922 she cruised with the fleet in Chinese waters and in September arrived at Yokohama, Japan. She returned to the west coast on 8 October and was decommissioned on 15 November 1922 at San Diego. She was used as a barracks ship until stricken from the Navy List on 27 May 1927. She was sold four months later.

<text>Alexander Galbraith &quot;Sandy&quot; Wilson (19 May 1924 – 27 August 2014) was an English composer and lyricist, best known for his musical &quot;The Boy Friend&quot; (1953).

==Biography==
Wilson was born in Sale, Cheshire, England, and was educated at Harrow School. In 1942 he won a State Scholarship for a wartime course at SOAS and was assigned to study Japanese. He was thus one of the so-called &#x27;Dulwich Boys&#x27; who studied at SOAS and boarded at Dulwich College. While there he put together a satirical review titled &#x27;A Matter of Course&#x27; based on his experiences on the Japanese course. He was one of the few not to complete the course and he subsequently served in the Royal Army Ordnance Corps in Great Britain, Egypt and Iraq. After the war he went to Oriel College, Oxford and while a student wrote revues for the Oxford University Experimental Theatre Club and then attended the Old Vic Theatre School on a production course.

Most of his work for the stage was material for revues, such as Hermione Gingold&#x27;s &quot;Slings and Arrows&quot;, Laurier Lister&#x27;s &quot;Oranges and Lemons&quot;, and &quot;See You Later&quot;, starring such performers as Peter Cook. He wrote the book, music and lyrics for &quot;The Boy Friend&quot; for the Players&#x27; Theatre in 1953. Its success resulted in a longer version being produced in the West End at Wyndham&#x27;s Theatre. After its opening in January 1954, over 2,000 performances were put on there. It opened on Broadway in 1954, at the Royale Theater, and introduced Julie Andrews in her Broadway debut. The show ran on Broadway for over 480 performances.

Wilson wrote the musical &quot;Valmouth&quot; in 1958, based on a Ronald Firbank novel set in a seaside resort. In 1964 he wrote &quot;Divorce Me, Darling!&quot;, a sequel to &quot;The Boy Friend&quot;. His last work was a version of &quot;Aladdin&quot; (1979) for the Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith.

His autobiography, published in 1975, is titled &quot;I Could Be Happy&quot;.

Sandy Wilson died in Taunton, England in 2014, aged 90. His longtime partner was Chak Yui. Wilson was a member of the Labour Party and contributed to the &quot;Elizabethan&quot; magazine during his years of greatest fame.

In 1999, Wilson donated his papers to the Harry Ransom Center. The papers include produced and unproduced plays, mostly musicals but also plays for stage and TV, as well as drafts of Wilson&#x27;s published and unpublished works including an autobiography, illustrated book, novels, articles, and short stories, along with correspondence.

<text>Omega baryons (often called simply Omega particles) are a family of subatomic hadrons which are represented by the symbol and are either charge neutral or have a +2, +1 or −1 elementary charge. Additionally, they contain no up or down quarks. Omega baryons containing top quarks are also not expected to be observed. This is because the Standard Model predicts the mean lifetime of top quarks to be roughly , which is about a twentieth of the timescale necessary for the strong interactions required for Hadronization, the process by which hadrons form from quarks and gluons.

The first omega baryon was the , it was made of three strange quarks, and was discovered in 1964. The discovery was a great triumph in the study of quarks, since it was found only after its existence, mass, and decay products had been predicted in 1961 by the American physicist Murray Gell-Mann and, independently, by the Israeli physicist Yuval Ne&#x27;eman. Besides the , a charmed omega particle () was discovered in 1985, in which a strange quark is replaced by a charm quark. The decays only via the weak interaction and has therefore a relatively long lifetime. Spin (&quot;J&quot;) and parity (&quot;P&quot;) values for unobserved baryons are predicted by the quark model.

Since omega baryons do not have any up or down quarks, they all have isospin 0.

==Recent discoveries==
The particle is a &quot;doubly strange&quot; baryon containing two strange quarks and a bottom quark. A discovery of this particle was first claimed in September 2008 by physicists working on the DØ experiment at the Tevatron facility of the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory. However, the reported mass of was significantly higher than expected in the quark model. The apparent discrepancy from the Standard Model has since been dubbed the &quot; puzzle&quot;. In May 2009, the CDF collaboration made public their results on the search for the based on analysis of a data sample roughly four times the size of the one used by the DØ experiment. CDF measured the mass to be , which was in excellent agreement with the Standard Model prediction. No signal has been observed at the DØ reported value. The two results differ by , which is equivalent to 6.2 standard deviations and are therefore inconsistent. Excellent agreement between the CDF measured mass and theoretical expectations is a strong indication that the particle discovered by CDF is indeed the . In February 2013 the LHCb collaboration published a measurement of the mass that is consistent with, but more precise than, the CDF result.

In March 2017, the LHCb collaboration announced the observation of five new narrow states decaying to , where the was reconstructed in the decay mode . The states are named (3000)0, (3050)0, (3066)0, (3090)0 and (3119)0. Their masses and widths were reported, but their quantum numbers could not be determined due to the large background present in the sample.

<doc id="207021" wikidata="Q312546" url="?curid=207021" title="William Stanley Jevons">
<text>William Stanley Jevons (; 1 September 1835 – 13 August 1882) was an English economist and logician.

Irving Fisher described Jevons&#x27;s book &quot;A General Mathematical Theory of Political Economy&quot; (1862) as the start of the mathematical method in economics. It made the case that economics, as a science concerned with quantities, is necessarily mathematical. In so doing, it expounded upon the &quot;final&quot; (marginal) utility theory of value. Jevons&#x27; work, along with similar discoveries made by Carl Menger in Vienna (1871) and by Léon Walras in Switzerland (1874), marked the opening of a new period in the history of economic thought. Jevons&#x27;s contribution to the marginal revolution in economics in the late 19th century established his reputation as a leading political economist and logician of the time.

Jevons broke off his studies of the natural sciences in London in 1854 to work as an assayer in Sydney, where he acquired an interest in political economy. Returning to the UK in 1859, he published &quot;General Mathematical Theory of Political Economy&quot; in 1862, outlining the marginal utility theory of value, and &quot;A Serious Fall in the Value of Gold&quot; in 1863. For Jevons, the utility or value to a consumer of an additional unit of a product is inversely related to the number of units of that product he already owns, at least beyond some critical quantity.

Jevons received public recognition for his work on &quot;The Coal Question&quot; (1865), in which he called attention to the gradual exhaustion of Britain&#x27;s coal supplies and also put forth the view that increases in energy production efficiency leads to more, not less, consumption. This view is known today as the Jevons paradox, named after him. Due to this particular work, Jevons is regarded today as the first economist of some standing to develop an &#x27;ecological&#x27; perspective on the economy.

The most important of his works on logic and scientific methods is his &quot;Principles of Science&quot; (1874), as well as &quot;The Theory of Political Economy&quot; (1871) and &quot;The State in Relation to Labour&quot; (1882). Among his inventions was the logic piano, a mechanical computer.

==Background==
Jevons was born in Liverpool, Lancashire, England. His father, Thomas Jevons, was an iron merchant who wrote about legal and economic subjects as well. His mother Mary Anne Jevons was the daughter of William Roscoe. At the age of fifteen he was sent to London to attend the University College School. Around this time, he seemed to have formed the belief that he was capable of important achievements as a thinker. Towards the end of 1853, after having spent two years at University College, where his favourite subjects were chemistry and botany, he received an offer as metallurgical assayer for the new mint in Australia. The idea of leaving the UK was distasteful, but pecuniary considerations had, in consequence of the failure of his father&#x27;s firm in 1847, become of vital importance, and he accepted the post.
Jevons left the UK for Sydney in June 1854 to take up a role as an Assayer at the Mint. Jevons lived with his colleague and his wife first at Church Hill, then in Annangrove at Petersham and at Double Bay before returning to England. In letters to his family he described his life, took photographs and produced a social map of Sydney. Jevons returned to England via America five years later.

He resigned his appointment, and in the autumn of 1859 re-entered the University College London as a student. He was granted B.A. and M.A. degrees from the University of London. He now gave his principal attention to the moral sciences, but his interest in natural science was by no means exhausted: throughout his life he continued to write occasional papers on scientific subjects, and his knowledge of the physical sciences greatly contributed to the success of his chief logical work, &quot;The Principles of Science&quot;. Not long after taking his M.A. degree, Jevons obtained a post as tutor at Owens College, Manchester.
In 1866, he was elected professor of logic and mental and moral philosophy and Cobden professor of political economy at Owens College.

==Theory of utility==

Jevons arrived quite early in his career at the doctrines that constituted his most characteristic and original contributions to economics and logic. The theory of utility, which became the keynote of his general theory of political economy, was practically formulated in a letter written in 1860; and the germ of his logical principles of the substitution of similars may be found in the view which he propounded in another letter written in 1861, that &quot;philosophy would be found to consist solely in pointing out the likeness of things.&quot; The theory of utility above referred to, namely, that the degree of utility of a commodity is some continuous mathematical function of the quantity of the commodity available, together with the implied doctrine that economics is essentially a mathematical science, took more definite form in a paper on &quot;A General Mathematical Theory of Political Economy&quot;, written for the British Association in 1862. This paper does not appear to have attracted much attention either in 1862 or on its publication four years later in the &quot;Journal of the Statistical Society&quot;; and it was not till 1871, when the &quot;Theory of Political Economy&quot; appeared, that Jevons set forth his doctrines in a fully developed form.

It was not until after the publication of this work that Jevons became acquainted with the applications of mathematics to political economy made by earlier writers, notably Antoine Augustin Cournot and H.H. Gossen. The theory of utility was at about 1870 being independently developed on somewhat similar lines by Carl Menger in Austria and Léon Walras in Switzerland. As regards the discovery of the connection between value in exchange and final (or marginal) utility, the priority belongs to Gossen, but this in no way detracts from the great importance of the service which Jevons rendered to British economics by his fresh discovery of the principle, and by the way in which he ultimately forced it into notice. In his reaction from the prevailing view he sometimes expressed himself without due qualification: the declaration, for instance, made at the commencement of the &quot;Theory of Political Economy&quot;, that value depends entirely upon utility, lent itself to misinterpretation. But a certain exaggeration of emphasis may be pardoned in a writer seeking to attract the attention of an indifferent public. The Neoclassical Revolution, which would reshape economics, had been started.

Jevons did not explicitly distinguish between the concepts of ordinal and cardinal utility. Cardinal utility allows the relative magnitude of utilities to be discussed, while ordinal utility only implies that goods can be compared and ranked according to which good provided the most utility. Although Jevons predated the debate about ordinality or cardinality of utility, his mathematics required the use of cardinal utility functions. For example, in &quot;The Theory of Political Economy&quot;, Chapter II, the subsection on &quot;Theory of Dimensions of Economic Quantities&quot;, Jevons makes the statement that &quot;In the first place, pleasure and pain must be regarded as measured upon the same scale, and as having, therefore, the same dimensions, being quantities of the same kind, which can be added and subtracted...&quot; Speaking of measurement, addition and subtraction requires cardinality, as does Jevons&#x27;s heavy use of integral calculus. Cardinality does not imply direct measurability, in which Jevons did not believe.

==Practical economics==
It was not, however, as a theorist dealing with the fundamental data of economic science, but as a writer on practical economic questions, that Jevons first received general recognition. &quot;A Serious Fall in the Value of Gold&quot; (1863) and &quot;The Coal Question&quot; (1865) placed him in the front rank as a writer on applied economics and statistics; and he would be remembered as one of the leading economists of the 19th century even had his &quot;Theory of Political Economy&quot; never been written. His economic works include &quot;Money and the Mechanism of Exchange&quot; (1875) written in a popular style, and descriptive rather than theoretical; a &quot;Primer on Political Economy&quot; (1878); &quot;The State in Relation to Labour&quot; (1882), and two works published after his death, &quot;Methods of Social Reform&quot; and &quot;Investigations in Currency and Finance&quot;, containing papers that had appeared separately during his lifetime. The last-named volume contains Jevons&#x27;s speculations on the connection between commercial crises and sunspots. He was engaged at the time of his death upon the preparation of a large treatise on economics and had drawn up a table of contents and completed some chapters and parts of chapters. This fragment was published in 1905 under the title of &quot;The Principles of Economics: a fragment of a treatise on the industrial mechanism of society, and other papers&quot;.

In &quot;The Coal Question&quot;, Jevons covered a breadth of concepts on energy depletion that have recently been revisited by writers covering the subject of peak oil. For example, Jevons explained that improving energy efficiency typically reduced energy costs and thereby increased rather than decreased energy use, an effect now known as the Jevons paradox. &quot;The Coal Question&quot; remains a paradigmatic study of resource depletion theory. Jevons&#x27;s son, H. Stanley Jevons, published an 800-page follow-up study in 1915 in which the difficulties of estimating recoverable reserves of a theoretically finite resource are discussed in detail.

In 1875, Jevons read a paper &quot;On the influence of the sun-spot period upon the price of corn&quot; at a meeting of the &quot;British Association for the Advancement of Science&quot;. This captured the attention of the media and led to the coining of the word sunspottery for claims of links between various cyclic events and sun-spots. In a later work, &quot;Commercial Crises and Sun-Spots&quot;, Jevons analyzed business cycles, proposing that crises in the economy might not be random events, but might be based on discernible prior causes. To clarify the concept, he presented a statistical study relating business cycles with sunspots. His reasoning was that sunspots affected the weather, which, in turn, affected crops. Crop changes could then be expected to cause economic changes. Subsequent studies have found that sunny weather has a small but significant positive impact on stock returns, probably due to its impact on traders&#x27; moods.

==Logic==
In 1864 Jevons published &quot;Pure Logic; or, the Logic of Quality apart from Quantity&quot;, which was based on Boole&#x27;s system of logic, but freed from what he considered the false mathematical dress of that system. In 1866 what he regarded as the great and universal principle of all reasoning dawned upon him; and in 1869 Jevons published a sketch of this fundamental doctrine under the title of &quot;The Substitution of Similars&quot;. He expressed this principle in its simplest form by saying: &quot;Whatever is true of a thing is true of its like&quot;, and he worked out in detail its various applications including the &quot;logical abacus&quot;, a method of performing simple logical inference by manipulating a truth table consisting of labeled wooden boards. He noted that the operations could be performed by a simple mechanism and later he had a &quot;logical machine&quot; built from his specifications in 1869, sometimes called the &quot;Logic Piano&quot; because of its resemblance to an upright piano. The machine was exhibited before the Royal Society in 1870.

In the following year appeared the &quot;Elementary Lessons on Logic&quot;, which soon became the most widely read elementary textbook on logic in the English language. In the meantime he was engaged upon a much more important logical treatise, which appeared in 1874 under the title of &quot;The Principles of Science&quot;. In this work Jevons embodied the substance of his earlier works on pure logic and the substitution of similars; he also enunciated and developed the view that induction is simply an inverse employment of deduction; he treated in a luminous manner the general theory of probability, and the relation between probability and induction; and his knowledge of the various natural sciences enabled him throughout to relieve the abstract character of logical doctrine by concrete scientific illustrations, often worked out in great detail. An example is his discussion of the use of one-way functions in cryptography, including remarks on the integer factorization problem that foreshadowed its use in public-key cryptography. Jevons&#x27;s general theory of induction was a revival of the theory laid down by Whewell and criticised by John Stuart Mill; but it was put in a new form, and was free from some of the non-essential adjuncts that rendered Whewell&#x27;s exposition open to attack. The work as a whole was one of the most notable contributions to logical doctrine that appeared in the UK in the 19th century. &quot;Though less attractively written than Mill&#x27;s &quot;System of Logic&quot;, &quot;Principles of Science&quot; is a book that keeps much closer to the facts of scientific practice.&quot; His &quot;Studies in Deductive Logic&quot;, consisting mainly of exercises and problems for the use of students, was published in 1880. In 1877 and the following years Jevons contributed to the &quot;Contemporary Review&quot; some articles on Mill, which he had intended to supplement by further articles, and eventually publish in a volume as a criticism of Mill&#x27;s philosophy. These articles and one other were republished after Jevons&#x27;s death, together with his earlier logical treatises, in a volume, entitled &quot;Pure Logic, and other Minor Works&quot;. The articles on criticisms of Mill contain much that is ingenious and much that is forcible, but on the whole they cannot be regarded as taking rank with Jevons&#x27;s other work. His strength lay in his power as an original thinker rather than as a critic; and he will be remembered by his constructive work as logician, economist and statistician.

==Jevons&#x27; number==
Jevons wrote in his 1874 book &quot;Principles of Science&quot;:

: &quot;Can the reader say what two numbers multiplied together will produce the number 8,616,460,799? I think it unlikely that anyone but myself will ever know.&quot;

This became known as Jevons&#x27;s number and was factored by Charles J. Busk in 1889, Derrick Norman Lehmer in 1903, and later on a pocket calculator by Solomon W. Golomb. It is the product of two prime numbers, 89,681 and 96,079.

==Geometry==
One of Jevons&#x27;s contemporaries, Hermann von Helmholtz, who was interested in non-Euclidean geometry, discussed two groups of two-dimensional creatures with one group living in the plane while the other living in the surface of a sphere. He asserted that since these creatures were embedded in two dimensions, they would develop a planar version of Euclidean geometry, but that since the nature of these surfaces were different, they would arrive at very different versions of this geometry. He then extended this argument into three dimensions, noting that this raises fundamental questions of the relationship of spatial perception to mathematical truth.

Jevons made an almost immediate response to this article. While Helmholtz focused on how humans perceived space, Jevons focused on the question of truth in geometry. Jevons agreed that while Helmholtz&#x27;s argument was compelling in constructing a situation where the Euclidean axioms of geometry would not apply, he believed that they had no effect on the truth of these axioms. Jevons hence makes the distinction between truth and applicability or perception, suggesting that these concepts were independent in the domain of geometry.

Jevons did not claim that geometry was developed without any consideration for spatial reality. Instead, he suggested that his geometric systems were representations of reality but in a more fundamental way that transcends what one can perceive about reality. Jevons claimed that there was a flaw in Helmholtz&#x27;s argument relating to the concept of infinitesimally small. This concept involves how these creatures reason about geometry and space at a very small scale, which is not necessarily the same as the reasoning that Helmholtz assumed on a more global scale. Jevons claimed that the Euclidean relations could be reduced locally in the different scenarios that Helmholtz created and hence the creatures should have been able to experience the Euclidean properties, just in a different representation. For example, Jevons claimed that the two-dimensional creatures living on the surface of a sphere should be able to construct the plane and even construct systems of higher dimensions and that although they may not be able to perceive such situations in reality, it would reveal fundamental mathematical truths in their theoretical existence.

In 1872, Helmholtz gave a response to Jevons, who claimed that Helmholtz failed to show why geometric truth should be separate from the reality of spatial perception. Helmholtz criticized Jevons&#x27;s definition of truth and in particular, experiential truth. Helmholtz asserts that there should be a difference between experiential truth and mathematical truth and that these versions of truth are not necessarily consistent. This conversation between Helmholtz and Jevons was a microcosm of an ongoing debate between truth and perception in the wake of the introduction of non-Euclidean geometry in the late 19th century.

==Personal life==
In 1867, Jevons married Harriet Ann Taylor, whose father, John Edward Taylor, had been the founder and proprietor of the &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot;. Jevons suffered from ill health and sleeplessness, and found the delivery of lectures covering so wide a range of subjects very burdensome. In 1876, he was glad to exchange the Owens professorship for the professorship of political economy in University College, London. Travelling and music were the principal recreations of his life; but his health continued to be bad, and he suffered from depression. He found his professorial duties increasingly irksome, and feeling that the pressure of literary work left him no spare energy, he decided in 1880 to resign the post. On 13 August 1882 he drowned whilst bathing near Hastings.

Jevons was brought up a Christian Unitarian. Excerpts from his journals indicate he remained committed to his Christian beliefs until death. He is buried in the Hampstead Cemetery.

==Legacy==
Jevons was a prolific writer, and at the time of his death was a leader in the UK both as a logician and as an economist. Alfred Marshall said of his work in economics that it &quot;will probably be found to have more constructive force than any, save that of Ricardo, that has been done during the last hundred years.&quot;

Jevons&#x27;s theory of induction has continued to be influential: &quot;Jevons&#x27;s general view of induction has received a powerful and original formulation in the work of a modern-day philosopher, Professor K. R. Popper.&quot;

<text>Northern krill (Meganyctiphanes norvegica) is a species of krill that lives in the North Atlantic Ocean. It is an important component of the zooplankton, providing food for whales, seals, fish and birds. (In the Southern Ocean, Antarctic krill &quot;Euphausia superba&quot; fills a similar role.) &quot;M. norvegica&quot; is the only species recognised in the genus Meganyctiphanes.

<text>The Battle of Baghdad, also known as the Fall of Baghdad, was a military engagement that took place in Baghdad in early April 2003, as part of the invasion of Iraq.

Three weeks into the invasion of Iraq, Coalition Forces Land Component Command elements, led by the U.S. Army 3rd Infantry Division, captured Baghdad. Over 2,000 Iraqi soldiers as well as 34 coalition troops were killed in the battle.
After the fall of Baghdad, Coalition forces entered the city of Kirkuk on April 10 and Tikrit on April 15, 2003. The United States officially declared victory against the Iraqi regime of Saddam Hussein on April 15, and President George W. Bush gave his Mission Accomplished Speech on May 1.

Baghdad suffered serious damage to its civilian infrastructure, economy, and cultural inheritance from the battle and following unrest, including looting and arson.
During the invasion, the Al-Yarmouk Hospital in south Baghdad saw a steady rate of about 100 new patients an hour.

==Preparation==


Limited bombing began on March 19, 2003, as United States forces unsuccessfully attempted to kill Saddam Hussein. Attacks continued against a small number of targets until March 21, 2003, when, at 17:00 UTC, the main bombing campaign of the US and their allies began. Its forces launched approximately 1,700 air sorties (504 using cruise missiles). The invasion of the city commenced three days after Allied forces led by Major General Buford Blount and the 3rd Infantry Division had secured the Baghdad airport.

US officials said that their forces fought skirmishes there with the Iraqi Special Republican Guard, with two task forces going up to the Tigris river from the southern outskirts of the city before moving west towards the airport. Major General Victor Renuart said the intention was to indicate to the Iraqi leader that coalition forces could move in and out of Baghdad whenever they wished. &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that US forces occupied two &quot;presidential palaces&quot;. The Army also surrounded the Information Ministry and other key government installations for a while.

On March 24, retired US Army general Barry McCaffrey, told BBC Newsnight: &quot;If [the Iraqis] actually fight, clearly it&#x27;s going to be brutal, dangerous work and we could take, bluntly, a couple to 3,000 casualties&quot;. In order to avoid the disastrous effects of house to house urban combat, US military planners agreed that seizing western Baghdad (now known as the Green Zone) was one of the main military objectives for securing Baghdad. By seizing only critical nodes and infrastructure in a rapid manner, it was believed such targeted assaults would weaken the regime of Saddam Hussein and hasten its collapse, all the while avoiding the deployment of troops to clear every single block of Baghdad. In preparation for the impending attack, Iraqi military planners organised hybrid groups of paramilitary and regular army units, deployed improvised barriers and destroyed the eastern Diyala River bridges to block US army mechanised units.

===Forces===
The invasion of Baghdad was led by the United States Army&#x27;s 3rd Infantry Division and the United States Marine Corps&#x27; 1st Marine Division, equipped with M1 Abrams tanks, M2 Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicles and M113 armored personnel carriers, LAV-25s, and Assault Amphibious Vehicles. These forces, supported by American and British aircraft including B-52s, Harrier GR7s and A10 Warthogs, confronted 36,000 soldiers of the Iraqi Special Republican Guard protected in sprawling bunkers outside Baghdad, armed with Asad Babil tanks and heavy artillery.

==Aerial bombing==
At the time of invasion, coalition aircraft were making bombing runs on Baghdad at the rate of 1,000 sorties a day, most of them aimed at the Republican Guard and Special Republican Guard.
U.S. planes also dropped about 200,000 leaflets warning civilians to stay in their homes.
Royal Air Force Tornados from 9 and 617 Squadrons attacked the radar defense systems protecting Baghdad, but lost a Tornado on March 22 along with the pilot and navigator (Flight Lieutenant Kevin Main and Flight Lieutenant Dave Williams) in a friendly fire incident, shot down by an American Patriot missile as they returned to their airbase in Kuwait. On April 2, a US Army Black Hawk helicopter and a United States Navy F/A-18C Hornet were shot down near Karbala. On 8 April, an A-10 Warthog attack plane was shot down in the fighting around Jumhuriya Bridge by an Iraqi surface-to-air missile.

==At Tuwayhah==
On April 4, 2003, the 2nd Tank Battalion Marine Corps had a stiff fight with the Al Nida Division of the Republican Guards and foreign Islamist fighters on the outskirts of Baghdad. By the end of the day, the Al Nida was considered rendered &quot;combat-ineffective&quot;, but three US Marines (1st Lieutenant Brian McPhillips, Sergeant Duane Rios and Corporal Bernard Gooden) were killed in the At Tuwayhah fighting and a tank lost. That day, the 5th Regimental Combat Team reported that two supporting Abrams tanks were destroyed battling the Fedayeen and Al Nida Republican Guards, the latter attempting to use anti-aircraft guns in the ground role.

==Baghdad International Airport==

On the morning of April 3, 2003, US forces advanced on Saddam International Airport. This location turned out to be the best defended Iraqi position of the entire war and two US soldiers were killed by mortar fire early in the fighting. After several hours of combat, the First Brigade, Third Infantry Division succeeded in taking control of Baghdad International Airport, which would become the hub of American logistics in Iraq for the next seven years. Before sunrise on April 4, the Americans were subjected to a fierce counter-attack by Iraqi troops. The First Brigade&#x27;s Tactical Operations Center (TOC) began receiving small arms and mortar fire. Under the cover of darkness, a number of T-72 tanks managed to get within several hundred meters of their position. According to one source: &quot;It was not until a chemical reconnaissance vehicle was fired on, and a Bradley actually was hit by a T-72 main gun round, that the battalion became aware of its peril.&quot;

Fortunately for the crew, the hit was only a glancing one, and they were able to drive their vehicle to safety. A fireteam with a Javelin ATGM destroyed two of the Iraqi tanks, while the rest were destroyed by a passing M1 Abrams. As dawn approached, the attack on the TOC intensified, and Iraqi infantry flooded into the position on foot. During the fighting, Sergeant First Class Paul Ray Smith was killed by enemy fire while fighting off an Iraqi attack on his team in an action that resulted in the posthumous awarding of division&#x27;s first Medal of Honor since World War II. During the softening up bombardment of Baghdad Airport on April 3, 2003, an Air Force F-15E fighter mistakenly attacked Battery C, 3rd Battalion, 13th Field Artillery (supporting Third Infantry Division), destroying two Humvees and killing Sergeant 1st Class Randy Rehn, Sergeant Todd Robbins and Specialist Donald Oaks . Five other soldiers from the unit were injured in the air attack. Sergeant 1st Class Wilbert Davis is also reported to have been killed along with American journalist Michael Kelly on April 3 after coming under fire, during operations to secure Baghdad Airport.

==Thunder Runs==
On April 5, Task Force 1–64 Armor of the US Army&#x27;s 3rd Infantry Division, 2nd Brigade, executed a raid, later called the &quot;Thunder Run&quot;, to test remaining Iraqi defenses. The operation began south of Baghdad and went through main roads to the newly secured airport. Iraqi resistance was disorganized, and the unit sustained few casualties. The unit was forced to abandon one tank due to a recoilless rifle or RPG strike in the rear that penetrated a fuel cell and set the engine on fire. The crew was unharmed. Later, the Air Force bombed the tank to destroy it in place, and the Iraqi Information Ministry claimed credit for destroying it.

Two days later, the entire 2nd Brigade of the 3rd Infantry Division was ordered to conduct another &quot;Thunder Run&quot;, following the same route as before. This route had been fortified in the intervening period, and senior leaders feared much more substantial resistance than during the prior encounter. Colonel David Perkins, the brigade&#x27;s commander, followed the original Thunder Run route north into Baghdad, but then veered east into the government districts instead of west towards the airport. The 2nd Brigade easily took control of what is now the &quot;Green Zone&quot; in one day, dramatically speeding up the end of conventional ground combat in Iraq.

This portion of the battle was described in detail in the book &quot;Thunder Run: The Armored Strike to Capture Baghdad&quot; by David Zucchino, published March 22, 2004.

===Objectives Moe, Larry, and Curly===
On April 7, 2003, intense fighting took place at three locations known as objectives Moe, Larry, and Curly (named after the characters in The Three Stooges). Each objective was a cloverleaf where east–west roads intersected with the main north–south route (Highway 8) being used for the Thunder run. Successfully holding these highway interchanges was essential to keep Highway 8 open thus allowing US forces to remain in the city center following the second Thunder run. Objective Moe was at the junction of Highway 8 and the Qadisiyah expressway, Larry at Qatar Al-Nada street leading to the Al Jadriyah bridge, and Curly at the Dora expressway. At the southernmost location, Objective Curly, an 18-hour battle by the 3–15 Infantry resulted in the deaths of two US soldiers (Staff Sergeant Robert Stever and Sergeant 1st Class John Marshall) killed by RPG rounds and about 40 wounded with 350 to 500 Iraqi casualties (Special
Republican Guard, Fedayeen and Syrian fighters). US tank (1st and 4th Battalions of the 64th Armored Regiments) and infantry units nearly ran out of fuel and ammunition and were almost overrun until reinforcements broke through and were able to resupply Objective Curly. Toward the end of the fighting, an Ababil-100 SSM missile or an Iraqi FROG-7 rocket exploded among the parked vehicles of the headquarters of 2nd Brigade, 3rd Infantry Division, killing two soldiers (Private 1st Class Anthony Miller and Staff Sergeant Lincoln Hollinsaid) and two embedded journalists (Julio Parrado and Christian Liebig), wounding 15 others and destroying 17 military vehicles.

==Tharthar Palace==

On April 7, US troops took control of a major presidential palace along the Tigris river. It had been hoped that leaders of the regime would be found in the complex, located near Saddam Hussein&#x27;s home city of Tikrit. American commanders on the ground said that they would remain in the city center rather than return to the outskirts as they had done previously.

Within hours of a palace seizure and with television coverage of this spreading through Iraq, US forces ordered Iraqi forces within Baghdad to surrender, or the city would face a full-scale assault. Iraqi government officials had either disappeared or had conceded defeat.

==Jumhuriya Bridge==
On April 8, 2003, some 500 Iraqi soldiers, including Republican Guard mounted a fierce counterattack across the Jumhuriya Bridge, forcing part of the US forces on the western side of Baghdad to initially retreat, but the Iraqis reportedly lost 50 soldiers in the fighting that included the use of A-10 Warthogs on the part of the US forces. An A-10 attack plane was shot down in combating the counterattack by an Iraqi surface-to-air missile.

==Looting==
As the American forces secured control of the capital, Iraqi civilians immediately began plundering the palaces, as well as government offices.
At the Yarmuk Hospital, not only all beds, but all medical equipment was stolen. One other hospital managed to continue functioning in a manner by organizing local civilians as armed guards.

Serious looting was described at National Museum of Iraq, and the Saddam Arts Center, the University of Baghdad, three five-star hotels: the Al-Rashid, the Al-Mansour and Babel Hotel, state-owned supermarkets, many embassies, and state-owned factories.

At the National Museum of Iraq, which had been a virtual repository of treasures from the ancient Mesopotamian cultures as well as early Islamic culture, many of the 170,000 irreplaceable artifacts were either stolen or broken (partially found safe and well later). On April 14, the Iraq National Library and National Archives were burned down, destroying thousands of manuscripts from civilizations dating back as far as 7,000 years.

Within eight days following the 2003 invasion, only 35, or 5% of the 700 animals in the Baghdad Zoo survived. This was a result of theft of some animals for human food, and starvation of caged animals that had no food or water. Survivors included larger animals like lions, tigers, and bears. Notwithstanding the chaos brought by the invasion, South African Lawrence Anthony and some of the zoo keepers cared for the animals and fed the carnivores with donkeys they had bought locally. Some of the smaller animals were fed to the larger carnivores by Special Forces (who are trained in veterinarian practices) for humane purposes as all animals had been neglected in the time leading to their arrival and considering the smaller animals were in poor health and stood little chance of survival even with care that was unavailable to them. Sacrifices were made for the lions and other large carnivores to survive until better care could be established.

==Political control==
As the U.S. forces were occupying the Republican Palace and other central landmarks and ministries on April 9, Saddam Hussein had emerged from his command bunker beneath the Al A&#x27;Zamiyah district of northern Baghdad, and greeted excited members of the local public. This impromptu walkabout was probably his last and his reasons for doing so are still unclear. It is possible that he wished to take what he thought might be his last opportunity to greet his people as their country&#x27;s president. The walkabout was captured on film and broadcast several days after the event on Al-Arabia Television and was also witnessed by ordinary people who corroborated the date afterwards. He was accompanied by bodyguards and other loyal supporters of the regime including at least one of his sons and his personal secretary. After the walkabout, Hussein returned to his bunker and made preparations for his family.

On April 9, 2003, Baghdad was formally occupied by Coalition forces. Much of Baghdad remained unsecured however and fighting continued within the city and its outskirts well into the period of occupation. Saddam, certain members of his family and close subordinates had vanished, and his whereabouts were unknown.

Many Iraqis celebrated the downfall of Saddam by vandalizing the many portraits and statues of him together with other pieces of his legacy. One widely publicized event was the dramatic toppling of a large statue of Saddam in Baghdad&#x27;s Firdus Square. This attracted considerable media coverage at the time.

===Firdos Square statue destruction===

Before a conglomerate of international press (and small crowd of around 100 U.S.-supported Iraqi militia), a statue of Saddam in Firdus Square was toppled by a U.S. Marine Corps M88 Recovery Vehicle. Initially, a Marine corporal named Edward Chin of the 3rd Battalion, 4th Marines Regiment placed a United States flag on the statue&#x27;s head, though it was replaced with an Iraqi flag. Various other symbols of the president were defaced.

===Search for Saddam Hussein===

The Americans had meanwhile started receiving rumors that Saddam was in Al A&#x27;Zamiyah and at dawn on April 10, they dispatched three companies of U.S. Marines to capture him. The Marines fought a fierce four-hour battle with Iraqi government forces at a Baghdad mosque where senior Iraqi leaders had been thought to be holed up, as American warplanes attacked areas of the city under the control of the Iraqi military. &quot;We had information that a group of regime leadership was attempting to organize a meeting. The fighting in and around the mosque complex could not be avoided as enemy forces were firing from the area of the mosque.&quot; said Navy captain Frank Thorp. Marines came under fire from rocket-propelled grenades, mortars and assault rifles. One Marine was killed and more than 20 were wounded, but neither Saddam nor any of his aides were found.

==Reporting==

Prior to the invasion, the US policy was that journalists reporting from the ground should be &quot;embedded&quot;, that is, be stationed within military units. Such reporters were required to sign contracts with the military and agree to rules that restricted what they could report on. Journalists found breaking those rules risked losing their embedded accreditation and being expelled from Iraq.
Iraq initially issued a statement contradicting western reporters&#x27; accounts of the invasion. Muhammed Saeed al-Sahaf, head of the Information Ministry, told a press conference on April 7 that there were no U.S. troops in Baghdad, saying: &quot;Their infidels are committing suicide by the hundreds on the gates of Baghdad. Be assured, Baghdad is safe, protected. Iraqis are heroes.&quot;

On April 8, two American air-to-surface missiles hit Al Jazeera&#x27;s office in a residential area of Baghdad killing a reporter and wounding a cameraman. The nearby office of Arab satellite channel Abu Dhabi TV was also hit by air strikes. Al Jazeera and Abu Dhabi TV were the only international media organizations to continue operating from their headquarters in Baghdad. Since the war started, other international media organizations had moved their operations to the Palestine Hotel in Baghdad. On the same day a U.S. Army tank fired into the 15th floor of the Palestine Hotel, killing two cameramen and wounding three. These attacks prompted accusations that the US was deliberately targeting news media outlets. Al Jazeera had provided the Pentagon with co-ordinates of its office in Baghdad; the Abu Dhabi TV building was clearly identified by a large blue sign on its roof, and, for the Palestine Hotel, according to Geert Linnebank, Reuters editor-in-chief, &quot;US troops who have known all along that this hotel is the main base for almost all foreign journalists in Baghdad&quot;. In the Abu Dhabi case, the station aired the picture of Iraqi fire from beneath the camera. In the hotel case, however, other journalists on the scene stated that there was no fire from or around the hotel.

<text>Atropa bella-donna, commonly known as deadly nightshade or belladonna, is a toxic perennial herbaceous plant in the nightshade family Solanaceae, which also includes tomatoes, potatoes and eggplant. It is native to Europe and Western Asia, including Turkey, its distribution extending from England in the west to western Ukraine and the Iranian province of Gilan in the east. It is also naturalised or introduced in some parts of Canada, North Africa and the United States.

The foliage and berries are extremely toxic when ingested, containing tropane alkaloids. These toxins include atropine, scopolamine, and hyoscyamine, which cause delirium and hallucinations, and are also used as pharmaceutical anticholinergics. Tropane alkaloids are of common occurrence not only in the Old World tribes Hyoscyameae (to which the genus Atropa belongs) and Mandragoreae, but also in the New World tribe Datureae—all of which belong to the subfamily Solanoideae of the plant family Solanaceae.

&quot;Atropa bella-donna&quot; has unpredictable effects. The antidote for belladonna poisoning is physostigmine or pilocarpine, the same as for atropine.

The potentially deadly ripe fruit can be distinguished from the similar &quot;Solanum nigrum&quot; by its larger berry size, its much larger calyx than &quot;S. nigrum&quot; that extends wider than the fruit (either encasing it or extending flat), and that &quot;A. bella-donna&quot; bears its berries singly, whilst &quot;S. nigrum&quot; has its berries in clusters located on a descending stem, similar to tomatoes. &quot;Solanum nigrum&quot; has other potentially toxic look alikes and should be identified with certainty before attempts at foraging. This plant&#x27;s overall structure looks similar to an aubergine, but its flower looks a little bit different. This plant&#x27;s flowers are very attractive, looking like a tomato flower, and its fruits are ball-shaped. It is very dangerous to consume.

==Name==

As with most names in biology, the scientific name differs from the common name.

The species common name is &quot;deadly nightshade&quot; or simply &quot;belladonna&quot;. The name entered English when John Gerard used it in his illustrated &quot;Herball, or Generall Historie of Plantes&quot;, first published in 1597, displacing &quot;dwale&quot; as the English common name for this plant. The English translation of 1633 was seen as the best and most exhaustive work of its kind and a standard reference for some time.

Its correct scientific name is hyphenated &quot;bella-donna&quot;. In his original description, Linnaeus called it &quot;Atropa bella donna&quot; with a space between &#x27;bella&#x27; and &#x27;donna&#x27;, and this space is treated by the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (Article 60.11 Ex.42) as an error to be replaced by a hyphen.

== History ==
&quot;Atropa bella-donna&quot; has a long history of use as a medicine, cosmetic, and poison. Known originally under various folk names (such as &quot;deadly nightshade&quot; in English), the plant was named &quot;Atropa bella-donna&quot; by Carl Linnaeus (1707–1778) when he devised his classification system. Linnaeus chose the genus name &quot;Atropa&quot; because of the poisonous properties of these plants. Atropos (lit. &quot;unturning one&quot;), one of the Three Fates in Greek mythology, is said to have cut a person&#x27;s thread of life after her sisters had spun and measured it. Linnaeus chose the species name &quot;bella-donna&quot; (&quot;beautiful woman&quot; in Italian) in reference to the cosmetic use of the plant during the Renaissance, when women were believed to have used the juice of the berries in eyedrops intended to dilate the pupils and make the eyes appear more seductive.

Extracts of plants in the deadly nightshade family have been in use since at least the 4th century BC, when &quot;Mandragora&quot; (mandrake) was recommended by Theophrastus for treatment of wounds, gout, and sleeplessness, and as a love potion. In the first century BC, Cleopatra used Atropine-rich extracts from the Egyptian henbane plant (also a nightshade) for the above-mentioned purpose of dilating the pupils of her eyes.

The use of deadly nightshades as a poison was known in ancient Rome, as attested by the rumour that the Roman empress Livia Drusilla used the juice of &quot;Atropa bella-donna&quot; berries to murder her husband, the emperor Augustus.

In the first century AD, Dioscorides recognised wine of mandrake as an anaesthetic for treatment of pain or sleeplessness, to be given prior to surgery or cautery.
The use of nightshade preparations for anaesthesia, often in combination with opium, persisted throughout the Roman and Islamic empires and continued in Europe until superseded in the 19th century by modern anaesthetics.

The modern pharmacological study of &quot;Atropa bella-donna&quot; extracts was begun by the German chemist Friedlieb Ferdinand Runge (1795–1867). In 1831, the German pharmacist Heinrich F. G. Mein (1799–1864) succeeded in preparing a pure crystalline form of the active substance, named &quot;atropine&quot;.
== Description ==

&quot;Atropa bella-donna&quot; is a branching herbaceous perennial rhizomatous hemicryptophyte, often growing as a subshrub from a fleshy rootstock. Plants can reach a height of (more commonly ), and have ovate leaves up to long. The bell-shaped flowers are dull purple tinged yellow-green toward the base and are faintly scented. The fruits are berries, which are green, ripening to a shiny black, and approximately in diameter. The berries are sweet and are consumed by animals (mainly birds) that disperse the seeds in their droppings, even though they contain toxic alkaloids (see &quot;Toxicity&quot;). There is a pale-yellow flowering form with pale yellow fruit called &quot;Atropa bella-donna&quot; var. &quot;lutea&quot;.

&quot;A. bella-donna&quot; is sometimes confused with the much less poisonous black nightshade &quot;Solanum nigrum&quot;, belonging to a different genus within Solanaceae. A comparison of the fruit shows that black nightshade berries are spherical, have a dull lustre and grow in clusters, whereas the berries of deadly nightshade are much glossier, twice as large, somewhat flattened and are borne singly. Another distinction is that black nightshade flowers are not tubular but white and star-shaped, bearing a central cone of yellow anthers.

== Distribution ==
&quot;Atropa bella-donna&quot; is native across temperate southern, central and eastern Europe, northwestern Africa (Morocco and Algeria), and in southwest Asia in Turkey, Iran and the Caucasus. In Great Britain it is native only in England, where it grows on calcareous soils, on disturbed ground, field margins, hedgerows and open woodland; it is more widespread as an alien, including in Wales, Scotland, and also Ireland, where it is a relic of cultivation as a medicinal herb.

It has long been introduced and cultivated outside its native range, and is now naturalised north and west of its native range in Europe, and in parts of North America, China, Australia, and New Zealand, where it is often found in shady, moist locations with limestone-rich soils. In southern Sweden it was recorded in Flora of Skåne in 1870 as grown in apothecary gardens near Malmö. It is considered a weed species in parts of the world, where it colonises areas with disturbed soils.

== Cultivation ==

&quot;Atropa bella-donna&quot; is rarely grown in gardens, but, when grown, it is usually for its large upright habit and showy berries. Germination of the small seeds is often difficult, due to hard seed coats that cause seed dormancy. Germination takes several weeks under alternating temperature conditions, but can be sped up with the use of gibberellic acid. Seedlings require sterile soil to prevent damping off -the process of preventing soil-borne pathogens from weakening the seeds from germination- and root disturbance during transplanting, ensuring they do not resent root disturbance.

== Taxonomy ==
&quot;Atropa bella-donna&quot; is in the nightshade family (&quot;Solanaceae&quot;), which it shares with potatoes, tomatoes, aubergine, thornapple, tobacco, wolfberry, and chili peppers. The common names for this species include deadly nightshade, belladonna, divale, dwale, banewort, devil&#x27;s berries, death cherries, beautiful death, devil&#x27;s herb, great morel, and dwayberry.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Atropa bella-donna&quot; was published by Carl Linnaeus in &quot;Species Plantarum&quot; in 1753. &quot;Atropa&quot; is derived from the name of the Greek goddess Atropos (&#x27;she who may not be turned aside&#x27; i.e. &#x27;the inflexible&#x27; or &#x27;the implacable&#x27;)—one of the three Greek fates or destinies who would determine the course of a man&#x27;s life by the weaving of threads that symbolised his birth, the events in his life, and finally his death, with Atropos cutting these threads to mark the last of these. The name &quot;bella-donna&quot; comes from the two words &quot;bella&quot; and &quot;donna&quot; in the Italian language, meaning &#x27;beautiful&#x27; and &#x27;woman&#x27;, respectively, originating either from its usage as a cosmetic to beautify pallid skin, or more probably, from its usage to increase the pupil size in women.

== Toxicity ==
Deadly nightshade is one of the most toxic plants known, and its use by mouth increases risk in numerous clinical conditions, such as complications of pregnancy, cardiovascular diseases, gastrointestinal disorders, and psychiatric disorders, among others. All parts of the plant contain tropane alkaloids; roots have up to 1.3%, leaves 1.2%, stalks 0.65%, flowers 0.6%, ripe berries 0.7%, and seeds 0.4% tropane alkaloids; leaves reach maximal alkaloid content when the plant is budding and flowering, roots are most poisonous in the end of the plant&#x27;s vegetation period. The nectar is used by bees to make honey that also contains tropane alkaloids. The berries pose the greatest danger to children because they look attractive and have a somewhat sweet taste. The root of the plant is generally the most toxic part, though this can vary from one specimen to another.

The active agents in deadly nightshade, atropine, hyoscine (scopolamine), and hyoscyamine, have anticholinergic properties. The symptoms of poisoning include dilated pupils, sensitivity to light, blurred vision, tachycardia, loss of balance, staggering, headache, rash, flushing, severely dry mouth and throat, slurred speech, urinary retention, constipation, confusion, hallucinations, delirium, and convulsions. In 2009, &quot;A. bella-donna&quot; berries were mistaken for blueberries by an adult woman; the six berries she ate were documented to result in severe anticholinergic syndrome. The deadly symptoms are caused by disruption by the atropine of the parasympathetic nervous system&#x27;s ability to regulate involuntary activities, such as sweating, breathing, and heart rate. The antidote for belladonna poisoning is an anticholinesterase (such as physostigmine) or a cholinomimetic (such as pilocarpine), the same as for atropine.

&quot;Atropa bella-donna&quot; is also toxic to many domestic animals, causing narcosis and paralysis. However, cattle and rabbits eat the plant seemingly without suffering harmful effects. In humans, its anticholinergic properties will cause the disruption of cognitive capacities, such as memory and learning.

Due to its toxicity, it is advised to not handle the plant without the use of gloves. Even in extremely small doses, when consumed, the toxicity can lead to death. In addition to this, Atropa has been known to have negative psychological effects on those that come into contact with it. Alongside the side effects of insomnia, local paralysis, and dizziness, are the interchanging states of mind swinging from excitement to absolute rabidness.

== Legal status ==
Cultivation is legal in Europe, Pakistan, North America, and Brazil. Belladonna leaves and roots can be bought with a medical prescription in pharmacies throughout Germany. In the United States, drugs containing tropane alkaloids such as atropine are prescription-only, and the FDA regards any over-the-counter products claiming efficacy and safety as an anticholinergic drug to be illegal.

== Uses ==

=== Cosmetics ===

The common name &quot;belladonna&quot; originates from its historic use by women, as &quot;bella donna&quot; is Italian for &quot;beautiful woman&quot;. Drops prepared from the plant were used to dilate women&#x27;s pupils, an effect considered to be attractive and seductive. Belladonna drops act as a muscarinic antagonist, blocking receptors in the muscles of the eye that constrict pupil size. Belladonna is currently rarely used cosmetically, as it carries the adverse effects of causing minor visual distortions, inability to focus on near objects, and increased heart rate. Prolonged usage was reputed to cause blindness.

=== Dietary supplements ===
In the United States, belladonna is marketed as a dietary supplement, typically as an atropine ingredient in over-the-counter cold medicine products. Although such cold medicine products are probably safe for oral use at typical atropine dosages (0.2 milligram), there is inadequate scientific evidence to assure their effectiveness. By FDA guidelines for supplements, there are no regulated manufacturing standards for cold medicines containing atropine, with some belladona supplements found to contain contaminants.

=== Medicinal uses ===

Scientific evidence to recommend the use of &quot;A. bella-donna&quot; in its natural form for any condition is insufficient, although some of its components, in particular &quot;l&quot;-atropine, which was purified from belladonna in the 1830s, have accepted medical uses. Donnatal is a prescription pharmaceutical, that combines natural belladonna alkaloids in a specific, fixed ratio with phenobarbital to provide peripheral anticholinergic or antispasmodic action and mild sedation. Donnatal contains 0.0194 mg of atropine. According to the FDA and Donnatal labeling, it is &quot;possibly effective&quot; for use as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (irritable colon, spastic colon, mucous colitis) and acute enterocolitis. Donnatal is not approved by the FDA as being either safe or effective. According to the FDA, Donnatal use has significant risks: it can cause harm to a fetus if administered to a pregnant woman, can lead to heat prostration if used in hot climates, may cause constipation, and may produce drowsiness or blurred vision.

The Towns-Lambert or Bella Donna Cure was a regimen for treating alcoholism in the early 20th century.

==== Alternative medicine and toxicity risk ====
Belladonna has been used in herbal medicine for centuries as a pain reliever, muscle relaxer, and anti-inflammatory, and to treat menstrual problems, peptic ulcer disease, histaminic reaction, and motion sickness.

At least one 19th-century eclectic medicine journal explained how to prepare a belladonna tincture for direct administration. In homeopathic practices, belladonna was prescribed by German physician Samuel Hahnemann as a topical medication for inflammation and pain diluted to such an extent that none of the plant was actually present in the preparation. In the form of Doktor Koster&#x27;s Antigaspills, belladonna was a homeopathic medication for upset stomach and excessive flatulence, again with no actual belladonna present in the medication. There is insufficient scientific evidence justifying the use of belladonna for these or any other clinical disorders.

In 2010 and 2016, the US Food and Drug Administration warned consumers against the use of homeopathic teething tablets and gels containing belladonna as used for infants and children, stating that the products may be toxic, causing &quot;seizures, difficulty breathing, lethargy, excessive sleepiness, muscle weakness, skin flushing, constipation, difficulty urinating, or agitation&quot; especially for the lower potencies which are, counterintuitively, the ones that are more likely to include belladonna since they are less diluted.

=== Recreational drug ===
&quot;Atropa bella-donna&quot; and related plants, such as &quot;Datura stramonium&quot; (commonly known as thornapple or jimson weed), have occasionally been used as recreational drugs because of the vivid hallucinations and delirium they produce. These hallucinations are most commonly described as very unpleasant, and recreational use is considered extremely dangerous because of the high risk of unintentional fatal overdose. The main psychoactive ingredients are the alkaloids scopolamine and, to a lesser extent, hyoscyamine. The effects of atropine on the central nervous system include memory disruption, which may lead to severe confusion. The major effects of belladonna consumption last for three to four hours; visual hallucinations can last for three to four days, and some negative aftereffects are preserved for several days.

=== Poison ===
The tropane alkaloids of &quot;A. bella-donna&quot; were used as poisons, and early humans made poisonous arrows from the plant. In Ancient Rome, it was used as a poison by Agrippina the Younger, wife of Emperor Claudius, on the advice of Locusta, a woman who specialised in poisons, and Livia, who is rumored to have used it to kill her husband Emperor Augustus.

The Scots used it during a truce to poison the troops of the invading Harold Harefoot, King of England, to the point that the English troops were unable to stand their ground and had to retreat to their ships.

Medical historians also suspect that Solomon Northup, a free black man who was kidnapped and sold into slavery in 1841, was poisoned using a combination of &quot;Atropa bella-donna&quot; and laudanum.

== Folklore ==

=== Flying ointment ===

In the past, witches were believed to use a mixture of belladonna, opium poppy and other plants, typically poisonous (such as monkshood and hemlock), in flying ointment, which they allegedly applied to help them fly to gatherings with other witches or to experience bacchanalian carousal. Carlo Ginzburg and others have argued that flying ointments were preparations meant to encourage hallucinatory dreaming; a possible explanation for the inclusion of belladonna and opium poppy in flying ointments concerns the known antagonism between tropane alkaloids of belladonna (scopolamine) and opiate alkaloids in the opium poppy, &quot;Papaver somniferum&quot; (to be specific, morphine), which produces a dream-like waking state (hypnagogia) or potentiated dreams while the user is asleep. This antagonism was known in folk medicine and discussed in traditional medicine formularies. Belladonna is also notable for the unpredictability of its toxic effects.

=== Female attractiveness ===
Among the ancient folk traditions of the Romanian (Moldavian) / Ukrainian region of Bukovina in the Carpathians is the ritual for a Bukovinian girl to enhance her attractiveness by making an offering to deadly nightshade. She entered the fields on a Sunday in Shrovetide, clad in her Sunday best, accompanied by her mother and bringing a bag of bread, salt, and brandy. She would dig up a deadly nightshade root and leave the three offerings in its place. As she returned home, she carried the root on the top of her head. On the way both to and from home, she avoided all quarrels and arguments. If asked by anyone on the way back what she was taking home, she would not divulge the truth or the spell would break.

<text>Copepods (; meaning &quot;oar-feet&quot;) are a group of small crustaceans found in nearly every freshwater and saltwater habitat. Some species are planktonic (living in the water column), some are benthic (living on the sediments), several species have parasitic phases, and some continental species may live in limnoterrestrial habitats and other wet terrestrial places, such as swamps, under leaf fall in wet forests, bogs, springs, ephemeral ponds, puddles, damp moss, or water-filled recesses of plants (phytotelmata) such as bromeliads and pitcher plants. Many live underground in marine and freshwater caves, sinkholes, or stream beds. Copepods are sometimes used as biodiversity indicators.

As with other crustaceans, copepods have a larval form. For copepods, the egg hatches into a nauplius form, with a head and a tail but no true thorax or abdomen. The larva molts several times until it resembles the adult and then, after more molts, achieves adult development. The nauplius form is so different from the adult form that it was once thought to be a separate species. The metamorphosis had, until 1832, led to copepods being misidentified as zoophytes or insects (albeit aquatic ones), or, for parasitic copepods, &#x27;fish lice&#x27;.

==Classification and diversity==
Copepods are assigned to the class Copepoda within the superclass Multicrustacea in the subphylum Crustacea. An alternative treatment is as a subclass belonging to class Hexanauplia. They are divided into 10 orders. Some 13,000 species of copepods are known, and 2,800 of them live in fresh water.

==Characteristics==

Copepods vary considerably, but are typically long, with a teardrop-shaped body and large antennae. Like other crustaceans, they have an armoured exoskeleton, but they are so small that in most species, this thin armour and the entire body is almost totally transparent. Some polar copepods reach . Most copepods have a single median compound eye, usually bright red and in the centre of the transparent head. Subterranean species may be eyeless, and members of the genera &quot;Copilia&quot; and &quot;Corycaeus&quot; possess two eyes, each of which has a large anterior cuticular lens paired with a posterior internal lens to form a telescope. Like other crustaceans, copepods possess two pairs of antennae; the first pair is often long and conspicuous.

Free-living copepods of the orders Calanoida, Cyclopoida, and Harpacticoida typically have a short, cylindrical body, with a rounded or beaked head, although considerable variation exists in this pattern. The head is fused with the first one or two thoracic segments, while the remainder of the thorax has three to five segments, each with limbs. The first pair of thoracic appendages is modified to form maxillipeds, which assist in feeding. The abdomen is typically narrower than the thorax, and contains five segments without any appendages, except for some tail-like &quot;rami&quot; at the tip. Parasitic copepods (the other seven orders) vary widely in morphology and no generalizations are possible.

Because of their small size, copepods have no need of any heart or circulatory system (the members of the order Calanoida have a heart, but no blood vessels), and most also lack gills. Instead, they absorb oxygen directly into their bodies. Their excretory system consists of maxillary glands.

===Behavior===
The second pair of cephalic appendages in free-living copepods is usually the main time-averaged source of propulsion, beating like oars to pull the animal through the water. However, different groups have different modes of feeding and locomotion, ranging from almost immotile for several minutes (e.g. some harpacticoid copepods) to intermittent motion (e.g., some cyclopoid copepods) and continuous displacements with some escape reactions (e.g. most calanoid copepods).

Some copepods have extremely fast escape responses when a predator is sensed, and can jump with high speed over a few millimetres. Many species have neurons surrounded by myelin (for increased conduction speed), which is very rare among invertebrates (other examples are some annelids and malacostracan crustaceans like palaemonid shrimp and penaeids). Even rarer, the myelin is highly organized, resembling the well-organized wrapping found in vertebrates (Gnathostomata). Despite their fast escape response, copepods are successfully hunted by slow-swimming seahorses, which approach their prey so gradually, it senses no turbulence, then suck the copepod into their snout too suddenly for the copepod to escape.

Several species are bioluminescent and able to produce light. It is assumed this is an antipredatory defense mechanism.

Finding a mate in the three-dimensional space of open water is challenging. Some copepod females solve the problem by emitting pheromones, which leave a trail in the water that the male can follow. Copepods experience a low Reynolds number and therefore a high relative viscosity. One foraging strategy involves chemical detection of sinking marine snow aggregates and taking advantage of nearby low-pressure gradients to swim quickly towards food sources.

===Diet===
Most free-living copepods feed directly on phytoplankton, catching cells individually. A single copepod can consume up to 373,000 phytoplankton per day. They generally have to clear the equivalent to about a million times their own body volume of water every day to cover their nutritional needs. Some of the larger species are predators of their smaller relatives. Many benthic copepods eat organic detritus or the bacteria that grow in it, and their mouth parts are adapted for scraping and biting. Herbivorous copepods, particularly those in rich, cold seas, store up energy from their food as oil droplets while they feed in the spring and summer on plankton blooms. These droplets may take up over half of the volume of their bodies in polar species. Many copepods (e.g., fish lice like the Siphonostomatoida) are parasites, and feed on their host organisms. In fact, three of the 10 known orders of copepods are wholly or largely parasitic, with another three comprising most of the free-living species.

===Life cycle===

Most nonparasitic copepods are holoplanktonic, meaning they stay planktonic for all of their lifecycles, although harpacticoids, although free-living, tend to be benthic rather than planktonic.
During mating, the male copepod grips the female with his first pair of antennae, which is sometimes modified for this purpose. The male then produces an adhesive package of sperm and transfers it to the female&#x27;s genital opening with his thoracic limbs. Eggs are sometimes laid directly into the water, but many species enclose them within a sac attached to the female&#x27;s body until they hatch. In some pond-dwelling species, the eggs have a tough shell and can lie dormant for extended periods if the pond dries up.

Eggs hatch into nauplius larvae, which consist of a head with a small tail, but no thorax or true abdomen. The nauplius moults five or six times, before emerging as a &quot;copepodid larva&quot;. This stage resembles the adult, but has a simple, unsegmented abdomen and only three pairs of thoracic limbs. After a further five moults, the copepod takes on the adult form. The entire process from hatching to adulthood can take a week to a year, depending on the species and environmental conditions such as temperature and nutrition (e.g., egg-to-adult time in the calanoid &quot;Parvocalanus crassirostris&quot; is ~7 days at but 19 days at .

===Biophysics===
Copepods jump out of the water - porpoising. The biophysics of this motion has been described by Waggett and Buskey 2007 and Kim et al 2015.

==Ecology==
Planktonic copepods are important to global ecology and the carbon cycle. They are usually the dominant members of the zooplankton, and are major food organisms for small fish such as the dragonet, banded killifish, Alaska pollock, and other crustaceans such as krill in the ocean and in fresh water. Some scientists say they form the largest animal biomass on earth. Copepods compete for this title with Antarctic krill (&quot;Euphausia superba&quot;). &quot;C. glacialis&quot; inhabits the edge of the Arctic icepack, especially in polynyas where light (and photosynthesis) is present, in which they alone comprise up to 80% of zooplankton biomass. They bloom as the ice recedes each spring. The ongoing large reduction in the annual ice pack minimum may force them to compete in the open ocean with the much less nourishing &quot;C. finmarchicus&quot;, which is spreading from the North Sea and the Norwegian Sea into the Barents Sea.

Because of their smaller size and relatively faster growth rates, and because they are more evenly distributed throughout more of the world&#x27;s oceans, copepods almost certainly contribute far more to the secondary productivity of the world&#x27;s oceans, and to the global ocean carbon sink than krill, and perhaps more than all other groups of organisms together. The surface layers of the oceans are believed to be the world&#x27;s largest carbon sink, absorbing about 2 billion tons of carbon a year, the equivalent to perhaps a third of human carbon emissions, thus reducing their impact. Many planktonic copepods feed near the surface at night, then sink (by changing oils into more dense fats) into deeper water during the day to avoid visual predators. Their moulted exoskeletons, faecal pellets, and respiration at depth all bring carbon to the deep sea.

About half of the estimated 14,000 described species of copepods are parasitic
 and many have adapted extremely modified bodies for their parasitic lifestyles.
They attach themselves to bony fish, sharks, marine mammals, and many kinds of invertebrates such as corals, other crustaceans, molluscs, sponges, and tunicates. They also live as ectoparasites on some freshwater fish.

===Copepods as parasitic hosts===
In addition to being parasites themselves, copepods are subject to parasitic infection. The most common parasites are marine dinoflagellates of the genus &quot;Blastodinium&quot;, which are gut parasites of many copepod species. Twelve species of &quot;Blastodinium&quot; are described, the majority of which were discovered in the Mediterranean Sea. Most &quot;Blastodinium&quot; species infect several different hosts, but species-specific infection of copepods does occur. Generally, adult copepod females and juveniles are infected.

During the naupliar stage, the copepod host ingests the unicellular dinospore of the parasite. The dinospore is not digested and continues to grow inside the intestinal lumen of the copepod. Eventually, the parasite divides into a multicellular arrangement called a trophont. This trophont is considered parasitic, contains thousands of cells, and can be several hundred micrometers in length. The trophont is greenish to brownish in color as a result of well-defined chloroplasts. At maturity, the trophont ruptures and &quot;Blastodinium&quot; spp. are released from the copepod anus as free dinospore cells. Not much is known about the dinospore stage of &quot;Blastodinium&quot; and its ability to persist outside of the copepod host in relatively high abundances.

The copepod &quot;Calanus finmarchicus&quot;, which dominates the northeastern Atlantic coast, has been shown to be greatly infected by this parasite. A 2014 study in this region found up to 58% of collected &quot;C. finmarchicus&quot; females to be infected. In this study, &quot;Blastodinium&quot;-infected females had no measurable feeding rate over a 24-hour period. This is compared to uninfected females which, on average, ate 2.93 × 104 cells per day. &quot;Blastodinium&quot;-infected females of &quot;C. finmarchicus&quot; exhibited characteristic signs of starvation, including decreased respiration, fecundity, and fecal pellet production. Though photosynthetic, &quot;Blastodinium&quot; spp. procure most of their energy from organic material in the copepod gut, thus contributing to host starvation. Underdeveloped or disintegrated ovaries and decreased fecal pellet size are a direct result of starvation in female copepods. Parasitic infection by &quot;Blastodinium&quot; spp. could have serious ramifications on the success of copepod species and the function of entire marine ecosystems. &quot;Blastodinium&quot; parasitism is not lethal, but has negative impacts on copepod physiology, which in turn may alter marine biogeochemical cycles.

Freshwater copepods of the &quot;Cyclops&quot; genus are the intermediate host of the Guinea worm (&quot;Dracunculus medinensis&quot;), the nematode that causes dracunculiasis disease in humans. This disease may be close to being eradicated through efforts by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization.

== Evolution ==

Despite their modern abundance, due to their small size and fragility, copepods are extremely rare in the fossil record. The oldest known fossils of copepods are from the late Carboniferous (Pennsylvanian) of Oman, around 303 million years old, which were found in a clast of bitumen from a glacial diamictite. The copepods present in the bitumen clast were likely residents of a subglacial lake which the bitumen had seeped upwards through while still liquid, before the clast subsequently solidified and was deposited by glaciers. Though most of the remains were undiagnostic, at least some likely belonged to the extant harpacticoid family Canthocamptidae, suggesting that copepods had already substantially diversified by this time. Possible microfossils of copepods are known from the Cambrian of North America. Transitions to parasitism have occurred within copepods independently at least 14 different times, with the oldest record of this being from damage to fossil echinoids done by cyclopoids from the Middle Jurassic of France, around 168 million years old.

==Practical aspects==

===In marine aquaria===
Live copepods are used in the saltwater aquarium hobby as a food source and are generally considered beneficial in most reef tanks. They are scavengers and also may feed on algae, including coralline algae. Live copepods are popular among hobbyists who are attempting to keep particularly difficult species such as the mandarin dragonet or scooter blenny. They are also popular to hobbyists who want to breed marine species in captivity. In a saltwater aquarium, copepods are typically stocked in the refugium.

===Water supplies===
Copepods are sometimes found in public main water supplies, especially systems where the water is not mechanically filtered, such as New York City, Boston, and San Francisco. This is not usually a problem in treated water supplies. In some tropical countries, such as Peru and Bangladesh, a correlation has been found between copepods&#x27; presence and cholera in untreated water, because the cholera bacteria attach to the surfaces of planktonic animals. The larvae of the guinea worm must develop within a copepod&#x27;s digestive tract before being transmitted to humans. The risk of infection with these diseases can be reduced by filtering out the copepods (and other matter), for example with a cloth filter.

Copepods have been used successfully in Vietnam to control disease-bearing mosquitoes such as &quot;Aedes aegypti&quot; that transmit dengue fever and other human parasitic diseases.

The copepods can be added to water-storage containers where the mosquitoes breed. Copepods, primarily of the genera &quot;Mesocyclops&quot; and &quot;Macrocyclops&quot; (such as &quot;Macrocyclops albidus&quot;), can survive for periods of months in the containers, if the containers are not completely drained by their users. They attack, kill, and eat the younger first- and second-instar larvae of the mosquitoes. This biological control method is complemented by community trash removal and recycling to eliminate other possible mosquito-breeding sites. Because the water in these containers is drawn from uncontaminated sources such as rainfall, the risk of contamination by cholera bacteria is small, and in fact no cases of cholera have been linked to copepods introduced into water-storage containers. Trials using copepods to control container-breeding mosquitoes are underway in several other countries, including Thailand and the southern United States. The method, though, would be very ill-advised in areas where the guinea worm is endemic.

The presence of copepods in the New York City water supply system has caused problems for some Jewish people who observe kashrut. Copepods, being crustaceans, are not kosher, nor are they quite small enough to be ignored as nonfood microscopic organisms, since some specimens can be seen with the naked eye. Hence, large specimens are certainly non-Kosher. However, some species are visible to the naked eye, but are small enough that they only appear as little white specks. These are problematic, as it is a question as to whether they are considered visible enough to be non-Kosher.

When a group of rabbis in Brooklyn, New York, discovered these copepods in the summer of 2004, they triggered such debate in rabbinic circles that some observant Jews felt compelled to buy and install filters for their water. The water was ruled kosher by posek Yisrael Belsky, chief posek of the OU and one of the most scientifically literate poskim of his time. Meanwhile, Rabbi Dovid Feinstein, based on the ruling of Rabbi Yosef Shalom Elyashiv - the two widely considered to be the greatest poskim of their time - ruled it was not kosher until filtered. Several major kashrus organizations (e.g OU Kashrus and Star-K) require tap water to have filters.

=== In popular culture ===
The Nickelodeon television series &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot; features a copepod named Sheldon J. Plankton as a recurring character.

<doc id="207038" wikidata="Q193036" url="?curid=207038" title="Acrobatics">
<text>Acrobatics () is the performance of human feats of balance, agility, and motor coordination. Acrobatic skills are used in performing arts, sporting events, and martial arts. Extensive use of acrobatic skills are most often performed in acro dance, circus, gymnastics, and freerunning and to a lesser extent in other athletic activities including ballet, slacklining and diving. Although acrobatics is most commonly associated with human body performance, the term is used to describe other types of performance, such as aerobatics.

==History==


Acrobatic traditions are found in many cultures, and there is evidence that the earliest such traditions occurred thousands of years ago. For example, Minoan art from contains depictions of acrobatic feats on the backs of bulls. Ancient Greeks practiced acrobatics, and the noble court displays of the European Middle Ages would often include acrobatic performances that included juggling.

In China, acrobatics have been a part of the culture since the Tang dynasty (618–907). Acrobatics were part of village harvest festivals. During the Tang dynasty, acrobatics saw much the same sort of development as European acrobatics saw during the Middle Ages, with court displays during the 7th through 10th century dominating the practice. Acrobatics continues to be an important part of modern Chinese variety art.

Though the term initially applied to tightrope walking, in the 19th century, a form of performance art including circus acts began to use the term as well. In the late 19th century, tumbling and other acrobatic and gymnastic activities became competitive sport in Europe.

Acrobatics has often served as a subject for fine art. Examples of this are paintings such as &quot;Acrobats at the Cirque Fernando (Francisca and Angelina Wartenberg)&quot; by Impressionist Pierre-Auguste Renoir, which depicts two German acrobatic sisters, and &quot;Acrobats in a Paris suburb&quot; by Viktor Vasnetsov.

==Types==
===Acrobalance===
&quot;Acrobalance&quot; is a floor based acrobatic art that involves balances, lifts and creating shapes performed in pairs or groups.

===Acro dance===
&quot;Acro dance&quot; is a style of dance that combines classical dance technique with precision acrobatic elements.

===Aerial===

&quot;Aerial&quot; is acrobatics performed in the air on a suspended apparatus.

====Trapeze====

A &quot;trapeze&quot; is a short horizontal bar hung by ropes or metal straps from a support. Trapeze acts may be static, spinning (rigged from a single point), swinging or flying, and may be performed solo, double, triple or as a group act.

====Corde lisse====

&quot;Corde lisse&quot; is a skill or act that involves acrobatics on a vertically hanging rope. The name is French for &quot;smooth rope&quot;.

====Cloud swing====

&quot;Cloud swing&quot; is a skill that usually combines static and swinging trapeze skills, drops, holds and rebound lifts.

====Cradle====

&quot;Cradle&quot; (also known as aerial cradle or casting cradle) is a type of aerial circus skill in which a performer hangs by their knees from a large rectangular frame and swings, tosses, and catches another performer

====Silks====

&quot;Aerial silks&quot; is a type of aerial skill in which one or more artists perform aerial acrobatics while hanging from a long length of fabric suspended from a frame or ceiling.

====Hoop====

&quot;Aerial hoop&quot; (also known as the &quot;lyra&quot;, &quot;aerial ring&quot; or &quot;cerceau&quot;/&quot;cerceaux&quot;&#x27;) is a circular steel apparatus (resembling a hula hoop) suspended from the ceiling or a frame, on which artists may perform aerial acrobatics. It can be used static, spinning, or swinging.

==Gallery of aerial artists==
===Contortion===

&quot;Contortion&quot; (sometimes contortionism) is a performance art in which performers called contortionists showcase their skills of extreme physical flexibility

===Rope and wire walking===

&quot;Tightrope walking&quot;, also called funambulism, is the skill of walking along a thin wire or rope. Its earliest performance has been traced to Ancient Greece. It is commonly associated with the circus. Other skills similar to tightrope walking include slack rope walking and slacklining.

===Tumbling===

&quot;Tumbling&quot; is an acrobatic skill involving rolls, twists, somersaults and other rotational activities using the whole body. Its origin can be traced to ancient China, Ancient Greece and ancient Egypt. Tumbling continued in medieval times and then in circuses and theatre before becoming a competitive sport.

<doc id="207040" wikidata="Q815867" url="?curid=207040" title="First aid kit">
<text>A first aid kit or medical kit is a collection of supplies and equipment used to give immediate medical treatment, primarily to treat injuries and other mild or moderate medical conditions. There is a wide variation in the contents of first aid kits based on the knowledge and experience of those putting it together, the differing first aid requirements of the area where it may be used, and variations in legislation or regulation in a given area.

The international standard for first aid kits is that they should be identified with the ISO graphical symbol for first aid (from ISO 7010), which is an equal white cross on a green background.

Standard kits often come in durable plastic boxes, fabric pouches or in wall mounted cabinets. The type of container will vary depending on the purpose, and they range in size from wallet-sized through to a large box. It is recommended that all kits are kept in a clean dust- and damp-proof container, in order to keep the contents safe and aseptic. 

Kits should be checked regularly and restocked if any items are damaged or are out of date.

==Appearance==
The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) sets a standard for first aid kits of being green, with a white cross, in order to make them easily recognizable to anyone requiring first aid.
The ISO only endorses the use of the green background and white cross, and this has been adopted as a standard across many countries and regions, including the entire EU. First aid kits are sometimes marked (by an individual or organization) with a red cross on white background, but use of this symbol by anyone but the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) or associated agency is illegal under the terms of the First Geneva Convention, which designates the red cross as a protected symbol in all countries signatory to it. One of the few exceptions is in North America, where despite the passing of the First Geneva convention in 1864, and its ratification in the United States in 1881, Johnson &amp; Johnson has used the red cross as a mark on its products since 1887 and registered the symbol as a U.S. trademark for medicinal and surgical plasters in 1905.

Some first aid kits may also feature the Star of Life, normally associated with emergency medical services, but which are also used to indicate that the service using it can offer an appropriate point of care. Though not supported by the ISO, a white cross on red background is also widely recognized as a first aid symbol. However, for very small medical institutions and domestic purposes, the white cross on a plain green background is preferred.

== Contents of first aid kits==


Commercially available first aid kits available via normal retail routes have traditionally been intended for treatment of minor injuries only. Typical contents include adhesive bandages, regular strength pain medication, gauze and low grade disinfectant. 

Specialized first aid kits are available for various regions, vehicles or activities, which may focus on specific risks or concerns related to the activity. For example, first aid kits sold through marine supply stores for use in watercraft may contain seasickness remedies.

===Airway, breathing and circulation===
First aid treats the ABCs as the foundation of good treatment. For this reason, most modern commercial first aid kits (although not necessarily those assembled at home) will contain a suitable infection barrier for performing artificial respiration as part of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, examples include:
*Pocket mask
*Face shield

Advanced first aid kits may also contain items such as:
*Oropharyngeal airway
*Nasopharyngeal airway
*Bag valve mask
*Manual aspirator or suction unit
*Sphygmomanometer (blood pressure cuff)
*Stethoscope

Some first aid kits, specifically those used by event first aiders and emergency services, include bottled oxygen for resuscitation and therapy.

===Basic items===
Basic items on a first aid kit consists of:
* Adhesive dressings and bandages
* Antiseptic solution (most commonly povidone iodine or hydrogen peroxide)
* Cotton balls or swabs
* Emergency blanket
* Gauze sponge
* Gloves
* Hand sanitizer
* Ice pack
* Alcohol 
* Saline solution
* Tweezers

===Trauma injuries===
Trauma injuries, such as bleeding, bone fractures or burns, are usually the main focus of most first aid kits, with items such as bandages and dressings being found in the vast majority of all kits.
*Adhesive bandages (band-aids, sticking plasters) - can include ones shaped for particular body parts, such as knuckles
**Moleskin – for blister treatment and prevention
*Dressings (sterile, applied directly to the wound)
**Sterile eye pads
**Sterile gauze pads
**Sterile non-adherent pads, containing a non-stick teflon layer
**Petrolatum gauze pads, used as an occlusive (air-tight) dressing for sucking chest wounds, as well as a non-stick dressing
*Bandages (for securing dressings, not necessarily sterile)
**Gauze roller bandages – absorbent, breathable, and often elastic
**Elastic bandages – used for sprains, and pressure bandages
**Adhesive, elastic roller bandages (commonly called &#x27;Vet wrap&#x27;) – very effective pressure bandages and durable, waterproof bandaging
**Triangular bandages – used as slings, tourniquets, to tie splints, and many other uses
*Butterfly closure strips – used like stitches to close wounds, usually only included for higher level response as can seal in infection in uncleaned wounds.
*Saline – used for cleaning wounds or washing out foreign bodies from eyes
*Soap – used with water to clean superficial wounds once bleeding is stopped
*Antiseptic wipes or sprays for reducing the risk of infection in abrasions or around wounds. Dirty wounds must be cleaned for antiseptics to be effective.
*Burn dressing, which is usually a sterile pad soaked in a cooling gel
*Adhesive tape, hypoallergenic
*Hemostatic agents may be included in first aid kits, especially military, combat or tactical kits, to promote clotting for severe bleeding.

===Personal protective equipment===

The use of personal protective equipment or PPE will vary by the kit, depending on its use and anticipated risk of infection. The adjuncts to artificial respiration are covered above, but other common infection control PPE includes:
*Gloves which are single-use and disposable to prevent cross infection
*Goggles or other eye protection
*Surgical mask or N95 mask to reduce the possibility of airborne infection transmission (sometimes placed on patient instead of caregivers. For this purpose the mask should not have an exhale valve)
*Apron

===Instruments and equipment===
*Trauma shears for cutting clothing and general use
*Scissors are less useful but often included (usually to cut medical equipment off or smaller)
*Tweezers, for removing splinters, amongst others.
*Lighter for sanitizing tweezers or pliers etc.
*Alcohol pads for sanitizing equipment, or unbroken skin. This is sometimes used to debride wounds, however some training authorities advise against this as it may kill cells which bacteria can then feed on
*Irrigation syringe – with catheter tip for cleaning wounds with sterile water, saline solution, or a weak iodine solution. The stream of liquid flushes out particles of dirt and debris.
*Torch (also known as a flashlight)
*Instant-acting chemical cold packs
*Alcohol rub (hand sanitizer) or antiseptic hand wipes
*Thermometer
*Space blanket (lightweight plastic foil blanket, also known as &quot;emergency blanket&quot;)
*Penlight
*Cotton swab
*Cotton wool, for applying antiseptic lotions.
*Safety pins, for pinning bandages.

===Medication===
Medication can be a controversial addition to a first aid kit, especially if it is for use on public. It is, however, common for personal or family first aid kits to contain certain medications. Dependent on scope of practice, the main types of medicine are life saving medications, which may be commonly found in first aid kits used by paid or assigned first aiders for members of the public or employees, painkillers, which are often found in personal kits, but may also be found in public provision and lastly symptomatic relief medicines, which are generally only found in personal kits.

Life saving
*Aspirin primarily used for central medical chest pain as an anti-platelet
*Epinephrine autoinjector (brand name Epipen) – often included in kits for wilderness use and in places such as summer camps, to temporarily reduce airway swelling in the event of anaphylactic shock. Note that epinephrine does not treat the anaphylactic shock itself; it only opens the airway to prevent suffocation and allow time for other treatments to be used or help to arrive. The effects of epinephrine (adrenaline) are short-lived, and swelling of the throat may return, requiring the use of additional epipens until other drugs can take effect, or more advanced airway methods (such as intubation) can be established.
*Diphenhydramine (brand name Benadryl) – Used to treat or prevent anaphylactic shock. Best administered as soon as symptoms appear when impending anaphylactic shock is suspected. Once the airway is restricted, oral drugs can no longer be administered until the airway is clear again, such as after the administration of an epipen. A common recommendation for adults is to take two 25mg pills. Non-solid forms of the drug, such as liquid or dissolving strips, may be absorbed more rapidly than tablets or capsules, and therefore more effective in an emergency.

Pain killers
*Paracetamol (also known as acetaminophen) is one of the most common pain-killing medications, as either tablet or syrup.
*Anti-inflammatory painkillers such as ibuprofen, naproxen or other NSAIDs can be used as part of treating pain from injuries such as sprains, strains and bone fractures.
*Codeine is both a painkiller and anti-diarrheal.

Symptomatic relief

* Anti diarrhea medication such as loperamide – especially important in remote or third world locations where dehydration caused by diarrhea is a leading killer of children
* Oral rehydration salts
*Antihistamine, such as diphenhydramine
*Poison treatments
**Absorption, such as activated charcoal, Enterosgel and Atoxyl.
**Emetics to induce vomiting, such as syrup of ipecac although first aid manuals now advise against inducing vomiting.
*Smelling salts (ammonium carbonate)

Topical medications
*Antiseptics / disinfectants
**Antiseptic fluid, moist wipe or spray – For cleaning and disinfecting a wound. Typically benzalkonium chloride, which disinfects wounds with minimal stinging or harm to exposed tissue. Can also be used as an antibacterial hand wipe for the person providing aid.
***Povidone iodine is an antiseptic in the form of liquid, swabstick, or towelette. Can be used in a weak dilution of clean water to prepare an irrigation solution for cleaning a wound.
*** Hydrogen peroxide is often included in home first aid kits, but is a poor choice for disinfecting wounds- it kills cells and delays healing
**Alcohol pads – sometimes included for disinfecting instruments or unbroken skin (for example prior to draining a blister), or cleaning skin prior to applying an adhesive bandage. Alcohol should not be used on an open wound, as it kills skin cells and delays healing.
**Medicated antiseptic ointments- for preventing infection in a minor wound, after it is cleaned. Not typically used on wounds that are bleeding heavily. Ointments typically contain one, two, or all three of the following antibacterial ingredients (those containing all three are typically called &#x27;triple-antibiotic ointment&#x27;) neomycin, polymyxin B sulfate or bacitracin zinc.
*Burn gel – a water-based gel that acts as a cooling agent and often includes a mild anaesthetic such as lidocaine and, sometimes, an antiseptic such as tea tree oil
*Anti-itch ointment
**Hydrocortisone cream or injection
**antihistamine cream containing diphenhydramine
**Calamine lotion, for skin inflammations.
*Anti-fungal cream
*Tincture of benzoin – often in the form of an individually sealed swabstick or ampule, protects the skin and aids the adhesion of adhesive bandages, such as moleskin, Band-Aids, or wound closure (&#x27;butterfly&#x27;) strips. Benzoin swabsticks are very prone to leaking and making a mess when kept in portable first aid kits; ampules are a more durable option. If swabsticks are used, it is advisable to keep them in a sealed zip lock bag.

==Improvised uses==
Besides the regular uses for first aid kits, they can be helpful in wilderness or survival situations. First aid kits can make up a part of a survival kit or a mini survival kit in addition to other tools.

==Workplace first aid kits==
In the United States, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) requires all job sites and workplaces to make available first aid equipment for use by injured employees. While providing regulations for some industries such as logging, in general the regulation lacks specifics on the contents of the first aid kit. This is understandable, as the regulation covers every means of employment, and different jobs have different types of injuries and different first-aid requirements. However, in a non-mandatory section, the OSHA regulations do refer to ANSI/ISEA Specification Z308.1 as the basis for the &quot;suggested&quot; minimum contents of a first aid kit. Another source for modern first aid kit information is United States Forest Service Specification 6170-6, which specifies the contents of several different-sized kits, intended to serve groups of differing size.

In general, the type of first aid facilities required in a workplace are determined by many factors, such as:
* the laws and regulation of the state or territory in which it is located;
* the type of industry concerned; for example, industries such as mining may have specific industry regulations detailing specialised instructions;
* the type of hazards present in the workplace;
* the number of employees in the workplace;
* the number of different locations that the workplace is spread over;
* the proximity to local services (doctors, hospital, ambulance).

==Trauma, combat and tactical kits==
Trauma kits, focused on major trauma have been implemented by combat medics with increased focus since the 1990s and have also become commonplace in United States Law Enforcement and for all American adults. 

After the 2012 Sandy Hook School Shooting a collaborative effort between the American College of Surgeons (ACS), the Hartford Consensus, and federal agencies like the Department of Defense and the Department of Homeland Security worked together to create the Stop the Bleed campaign which is focused on teaching everyday Americans how to stop major bleeding and trauma and has helped to popularize the availability and access of IFAKs or Trauma Kits.

Trauma kits tend to have fewer items focused on basic items for scrapes and abrasions and instead focus on Tourniquets, Chest Seals, Hemostatic and non-treated gauze for wound packing, and pressure bandages among other things.

==Historic first aid kits==

As the understanding of first aid and lifesaving measures has advanced, and the nature of public health risks has changed, the contents of first aid kits have changed to reflect prevailing understandings and conditions. For example, earlier US Federal specifications for first aid kits included incision/suction-type snakebite kits and mercurochrome antiseptic. There are many historic components no longer used today, of course; some notable examples follow. As explained in the article on snakebite, the historic snakebite kit is no longer recommended. Mercurochrome was removed in 1998 by the US FDA from the generally recognized as safe category due to concerns over its mercury content. Another common item in early 20th century first aid kits, picric acid gauze for treating burns, is today considered a hazardous material due to its forming unstable and potentially explosive picrates when in contact with metal. Examples of modern additions include the CPR face shields and specific body-fluid barriers included in modern kits to assist in CPR and to help prevent the spread of bloodborne pathogens such as HIV.

<doc id="207041" wikidata="Q214955" url="?curid=207041" title="Ali Hassan al-Majid">
<text>Colonel General Ali Hassan al-Majid al-Tikriti (; – 25 January 2010), was an Iraqi military officer and politician under Saddam Hussein who served as Defense minister, Interior minister, and chief of the General Security. He was also the governor of Kuwait during much of the Gulf War.

A first cousin of former Ba&#x27;athist Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, al-Majid became notorious in the 1980s and 1990s for his alleged role in the Iraqi government&#x27;s campaigns against internal opposition forces, namely the ethnic Kurdish rebels of the north, and the Shia rebels of the south. Repressive measures included deportations and mass killings; al-Majid was dubbed &quot;Chemical Ali&quot; (, ) by Iraqis for his use of chemical weapons in attacks against the Kurds.

Al-Majid was captured following the 2003 invasion of Iraq and was charged by the Iraqi government with war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide. He was convicted in June 2007 and sentenced to death for crimes of genocide against the Kurds committed in the al-Anfal campaign of the 1980s. His appeal of the death sentence was rejected on 4 September 2007, and he was sentenced to death for the fourth time on 17 January 2010 and was hanged eight days later, on 25 January 2010.

== Early life ==

Al-Majid is thought to have been born around 1941 in al-Awja near Tikrit. He was a member of the Bejat clan of the Al-Bu Nasir tribe, to which his elder cousin Saddam Hussein also belonged. Saddam later relied heavily on the clan and tribe to fill senior posts in his government. Like Saddam, al-Majid also was a Sunni Muslim who came from a poor tribal family and had little formal education. He worked as a motorcycle messenger and driver in the Iraqi Army from 1959 until the Ba&#x27;ath Party seized power in 1968. Thereafter, he was able to gain entry into the Military Academy and was commissioned as an officer in the Infantry.

His rise, thereafter, aided by his cousin Saddam, was swift. He initially became an aide to Iraqi Defense minister Hammadi Shihab in the early 1970s after joining the Ba&#x27;ath party. He then became head of the government&#x27;s Security Office, serving as an enforcer for the increasingly powerful Saddam. In 1979, Saddam seized power, ousting President Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr. At a videotaped assembly of Ba&#x27;ath party officials in July 1979, Saddam read out the names of political opponents, denouncing them as &#x27;traitors&#x27;, ordering that they be removed one by one from the room; many were later executed. Al-Majid could be seen in the background telling Saddam, &quot;What you have done in the past was good. What you will do in the future is good. But there&#x27;s this one small point. You have been too gentle, too merciful.&quot;

Al-Majid became one of Saddam&#x27;s closest military advisors and head of the Iraqi Intelligence Service, Iraqi secret police known as the &quot;Mukhabarat&quot;. Following an unsuccessful assassination attempt on Saddam in 1983 in the town of Dujail, north of Baghdad, al-Majid directed the subsequent collective punishment operations in which scores of local men were killed, thousands more inhabitants were deported, and the entire town was razed to the ground.

== Al-Anfal campaign ==

During the late stages of the Iran–Iraq War al-Majid was given the post of Secretary General of the Northern Bureau of the Ba&#x27;ath Party, in which capacity he served from March 1987 to April 1989. This effectively made him Saddam&#x27;s proconsul in the north of the country, commanding all state agencies in the rebellious Kurdish-populated region of the country. He was known for his ruthlessness, ordering the indiscriminate use of chemical weapons such as mustard gas and the extremely potent and toxic nerve agents sarin, tabun, and VX, against Kurdish targets during a genocidal campaign dubbed Al-Anfal (&quot;Spoils of War&quot;). The first such attacks occurred as early as April 1987 and continued into 1988, culminating in the notorious attack on Halabja in which over 5,000 people were killed.

With Kurdish resistance continuing, al-Majid decided to cripple the rebellion by eradicating the civilian population of the Kurdish regions. His forces embarked on a systematic campaign of mass killings, property destruction and forced population transfer (called &quot;Arabization&quot;) in which thousands of Kurdish and Assyrian villages were razed and their inhabitants either killed or deported to the south of Iraq. He signed a decree in June 1987 stating that &quot;Within their jurisdiction, the armed forces must kill any human being or animal present in these areas.&quot; By 1988, some 4,000 villages had been destroyed, an estimated 180,000 Kurds had been killed and some 1.5 million had been deported. The Kurds called him Chemical Ali (&quot;Ali Al-Kīmāwī&quot;) for his role in the campaign; according to Iraqi Kurdish sources, Ali Hassan openly boasted of this nickname. Others dubbed him the &quot;Butcher of Kurdistan&quot;.

== Gulf War and Iraq War ==

Al-Majid was appointed Minister of Local Government following the war&#x27;s end in 1988, with responsibility for the repopulation of the Kurdish and Assyrian region with Arab settlers relocated from elsewhere in Iraq. Two years later, after the invasion of Kuwait in August 1990, he became the military governor of the occupied emirate. He instituted a violent regime under which Kuwait was systematically looted and purged of &quot;disloyal elements&quot;. In November 1990, he was recalled to Baghdad and was appointed Interior Minister in March 1991. Following the Iraqi defeat in the war, he was given the task of quelling the uprisings in the Shi&#x27;ite south of Iraq as well as the Kurdish and Assyrian north. Both revolts were crushed with great brutality, with many thousands killed.

Al-Majid was subsequently given the post of Defense Minister, though he briefly fell from grace in 1995 when Saddam dismissed him after it was discovered that al-Majid was involved in illegally smuggling grain to Iran. In December 1998, however, Saddam recalled him and appointed him commander of the southern region of Iraq, where the United States was increasingly carrying out air strikes in the northern no-fly zone. Al-Majid was re-appointed to this post in March 2003, immediately before the start of the Iraq War. He based himself in the southern port city of Basra and in April 2003 he was mistakenly reported to have been killed there in a U.S. air strike.

Al-Majid survived the April 2003 attack but was arrested by American forces on 17 August 2003 in Basra. He had been listed as the fifth most-wanted man in Iraq, shown as the King of Spades in the deck of most-wanted Iraqi playing cards. In 2006, he was charged with genocide and crimes against humanity for his part in the Anfal campaign and was transferred to the Iraq Special Tribunal for trial. He received four death sentences for his role in killing Shia Muslims in 1991 and 1999, the genocide of the Kurds in the 1980s, and ordering the gassing of Kurds at Halabja.
== Trial and execution ==
The trial began on 21 August 2006, in acrimonious circumstances when al-Majid refused to enter a plea. He subsequently had a not guilty plea entered on his behalf by the court.

He was unapologetic about his actions, telling the court that he had ordered the destruction of Kurdish villages because they were &quot;full of Iranian agents&quot;. At one hearing, he declared: &quot;I am the one who gave orders to the army to demolish villages and relocate the villagers. The army was responsible to carry out those orders. I am not defending myself. I am not apologizing. I did not make a mistake.&quot;

During the trial, the court heard tape-recorded conversations between al-Majid and senior Ba&#x27;ath party officials regarding the use of chemical weapons. Responding to a question about the success of the deportation campaign, Ali Hassan told his interlocutors:

I went to Sulaymaniyah and hit them with the special ammunition [i.e. chemical weapons]. That was my answer. We continued the deportations. I told the mustashars [village heads] that they might say that they like their villages and that they won&#x27;t leave. I said I cannot let your village stay because I will attack it with chemical weapons. Then you and your family will die. You must leave right now. Because I cannot tell you the same day that I am going to attack with chemical weapons. I will kill them all with chemical weapons! Who is going to say anything? The international community? Fuck them! The international community and those who listen to them.

... This is my intention, and I want you to take serious note of it. As soon as we complete the deportations, we will start attacking them everywhere according to a systematic military plan. Even their strongholds. In our attacks we will take back one third or one half of what is under their control. If we can try to take two-thirds, then we will surround them in a small pocket and attack them with chemical weapons. I will not attack them with chemicals just one day, but I will continue to attack them with chemicals for fifteen days. Then I will announce that anyone who wishes to surrender with his gun will be allowed to do so. Anyone willing to come back is welcome, and those who do not return will be attacked again with new, destructive chemicals. I will not mention the name of the chemical because that is classified information. But I will say with new destructive weapons that will destroy you. So I will threaten them and motivate them to surrender.

During the next few days of the trial, more recordings of al-Majid were heard in which he once again discussed the government&#x27;s goals in dealing with the Iraqi Kurds. In the recordings, Ali Hassan calls the Iraqi Kurdish leader Jalal Talabani &quot;wicked and a pimp,&quot; and promises not to leave alive anyone who speaks the Kurdish language. 

Ali Hassan&#x27;s defense claimed that he used such language as &quot;psychological and propaganda&quot; tools against the Kurds, to prevent them from fighting government forces. &quot;All the words used by me, such as &#x27;deport them&#x27; or &#x27;wipe them out,&#x27; were only for psychological effect,&quot; Ali Hassan said.

On 24 June 2007, the court returned a verdict of guilty on all counts. The presiding judge, Mohammed Oreibi al-Khalifa, told al-Majid: &quot;You had all the civil and military authority for northern Iraq. You gave orders to the troops to kill Kurdish and Assyrian civilians and put them in severe conditions. You subjected them to wide and systematic attacks using chemical weapons and artillery. You led the killing of villagers. You ... committed genocide. There are enough documents against you.&quot;

He received five death sentences for genocide, crimes against humanity (specifically willful killing, forced disappearances and extermination), and war crimes (intentionally directing attacks against a civilian population). He was also sentenced to multiple prison terms ranging from seven years to life for other crimes. As his sentences were upheld, under Iraqi law, sentence was to be carried out by hanging, subject to the convictions being upheld following an automatic appeal, and he was to be executed in the following 30 days along with two others – Sultan Hashim Ahmed al-Tai, military commander of the Anfal campaign; and Hussein Rashid, deputy general commander of the Iraqi armed force, assistant chief of staff for military operations, and former Republican Guard commander. However, the executions were postponed to 16 October, because of the arrival of the holy month of Ramadan. He was supposed to be executed 16 October 2007, but the execution was delayed when Iraqi President Jalal Talabani and Vice President Tariq al-Hashemi expressed opposition to the sentences of al-Majid&#x27;s co-defendants and refused to sign the execution orders. He then entered into a legal row with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, and as a result the Americans refused to hand any of the condemned prisoners over until the issue was resolved.

In February 2008 an anonymous informant stated that Ali Hassan al-Majid&#x27;s execution was finally approved by Talabani, al-Hashemi, and al-Maliki; this was the final hurdle in the way of the execution. On 2 December 2008, al-Majid was once again sentenced to death, but this time for playing a role in killing between 20,000 and 100,000 Shi&#x27;ite Muslims during the revolt in southern Iraq that followed the 1991 Gulf War.&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN 2/12/08&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 March 2009, al-Majid was sentenced to death for the third time, this for the assassination of Grand-Ayatollah Mohammad al-Sadr in 1999.

The Iraqi Cabinet put pressure on the Presidential council on 17 March 2009 for Al-Majid&#x27;s execution.

The situation was similar on 17 January 2010 prior to 9 am (GMT); a fourth death penalty was issued against him in response to his acts of genocide against Kurds in the 1980s. He was also convicted of killing Shia Muslims in 1991 and 1999. Alongside him in the trial was former defense minister Sultan Hashem, who was also found guilty by The Iraqi High Tribunal for the Halabja attack and sentenced to 15 years&#x27; imprisonment. Al-Majid was executed by hanging on 25 January 2010. He was buried in Saddam&#x27;s family cemetery in al-Awja the next day; near Saddam&#x27;s sons, half-brother and the former Vice president, but outside the mosque housing the tomb of Saddam. While he was sentenced to death on four separate occasions, the original 2007 verdict sentenced him to five death sentences, and so the combined tally of death sentences handed out was eight.

Amnesty International&#x27;s Middle East and North Africa Director Malcolm Smart later criticized the execution as &quot;only the latest of a mounting number of executions, some of whom did not receive fair trials, in gross violation of human rights...&quot;

<doc id="207042" wikidata="Q579179" url="?curid=207042" title="Halabja massacre">
<text>The Halabja massacre ( ) took place in Iraqi Kurdistan on 16 March 1988, when thousands of Kurds were killed by a large-scale Iraqi chemical attack. A targeted attack in Halabja, it was carried out during the Anfal campaign, which was led by Iraqi military officer Ali Hassan al-Majid. Two days before the attack, the city had been captured by Iran as part of Operation Zafar 7 of the Iran–Iraq War. Following the incident, the United Nations launched an investigation and concluded that mustard gas and other unidentified nerve agents had been used against Kurdish civilians. The United States Defense Intelligence Agency initially blamed Iran for the attack, though the majority of evidence later revealed that Iraq had used the chemical weapons to bolster an ongoing military offensive against Iran, pro-Iranian Kurdish fighters, and ordinary Halabja residents.

To date, the Halabja massacre remains the largest chemical weapons attack directed against a civilian-populated region in human history, killing between 3,200 and 5,000 people and injuring 7,000 to 10,000 more. Preliminary results from surveys of the affected areas showed increased rates of cancer and birth defects in the years since the attack took place.

In 2010, the Supreme Iraqi Criminal Tribunal officially defined the Halabja chemical attack as a genocidal massacre against the Kurdish people during the time of Iraqi president Saddam Hussein. That same year, it was also formally condemned by the Parliament of Canada, which classified it as a crime against humanity. Al-Majid, who was captured during the 2003 invasion of Iraq, was put on trial and found guilty of ordering the attack; he was sentenced to death in June 2007 and executed by hanging in January 2010.

== Background ==
Northern Iraq was an area of general unrest during the early stage of the Iran–Iraq War, with the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) and Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) militias joining forces, with Iranian support, in 1982 and 1983, respectively. From 1985, the Iraqi Ba&#x27;athist government under Saddam Hussein decided to eradicate pockets of Kurdish insurgents in the north and strike down the peshmerga rebels by all means possible, including large-scale punishment of civilians and the use of chemical weapons. The Halabja event was also part of Iraqi efforts to counter-attack Kurdish and Iranian forces in the final stages of Operation Zafar 7.

== Chemical attack ==
The five-hour attack began in the evening of 16 March 1988, following a series of indiscriminate conventional (rocket and napalm) attacks. Iraqi Mig and Mirage aircraft began dropping chemical bombs on Halabja&#x27;s residential areas, far from the besieged Iraqi army base on the outskirts of the town. According to regional Kurdish rebel commanders, Iraqi aircraft, coordinated by helicopters, conducted up to 14 bombings in sorties of seven to eight planes each. Eyewitnesses told of clouds of white, black and then yellow smoke billowing upward and rising as a column about in the air.

It was a beautiful spring day. As the clock approached 11:00 in the morning, I felt a strange sensation; my heart convulsed as if it were telling me that we were on the verge of a major calamity. Within minutes, artillery rounds began to explode in Halabja and planes began dropping bombs on the town. The bombing was concentrated on the northern neighborhoods, so we ran and hid in our basement. At 2 o&#x27;clock in the afternoon, as the intensity of the bombing wound down, I carefully sneaked out of the basement to the kitchen and carried food to my family. When the bombing stopped, we began to hear noises that sounded like metal pieces falling on the ground. But I didn’t find an explanation.

I saw things that I won&#x27;t forget for as long as I live. It started with a loud strange noise that sounded like bombs exploding, and a man came running into our house, shouting, &#x27;Gas! Gas!&#x27; We hurried into our car and closed its windows. I think the car was rolling over the bodies of innocent people. I saw people lying on the ground, vomiting a green-colored liquid, while others became hysterical and began laughing loudly before falling motionless onto the ground. Later, I smelled an aroma that reminded me of apples and I lost consciousness. When I awoke, there were hundreds of bodies scattered around me. After that I took shelter again in a nearby basement and the area was engulfed by an ugly smell. It was similar to rotting garbage, but then it changed to a sweet smell similar to that of apples. Then I smelled something that was like eggs.

When you hear people shouting the words &#x27;gas&#x27; or &#x27;chemicals&#x27;—and you hear those shouts spreading among the people—that is when terror begins to take hold, especially among the children and the women. Your loved ones, your friends, you see them walking and then falling like leaves to the ground. It is a situation that cannot be described—birds began falling from their nests; then other animals, then humans. It was total annihilation. Whoever was able to walk out of the town, left on foot. Whoever had a car, left by car. But whoever had too many children to carry on their shoulders, they stayed in the town and succumbed to the gas.

Survivors said the gas at first smelled of sweet apples and reported that people &quot;died in a number of ways, suggesting a combination of toxic chemicals.&quot; Citing an interview with a university student who survived the attack, the international NGO, Human Rights Watch, reported that &quot;some [victims] &#x27;just dropped dead&#x27;. Others &#x27;died of laughing.&#x27; Others took a few minutes to die, first &#x27;burning and blistering&#x27; or &#x27;coughing up green vomit&#x27;&quot;. &quot;Those who were in the thick of the &#x27;death cloud&#x27; died in suspended animation&quot; according to Dlawer Ala&#x27;Aldeen of Nottingham University, who collected detailed data between 1987 and 1988, including numbers, places and types of chemical weapon attacks across Iraqi Kurdistan. Many were injured or perished in the panic that followed the attack, especially those who were blinded by the chemicals.

&quot;Iranian physicians reported that victims of the chemical attacks on Halabja showed characteristic symptoms of cyanide poisoning,&quot; while other reports indicated substantial quantities of mustard gas and other chemical weapons were used. Most of the wounded taken to hospitals in the Iranian capital Tehran were suffering from mustard gas exposure. A United Nations (UN) medical investigation concluded that mustard gas was used in the attack, along with unidentified nerve agents; the UN&#x27;s investigator was &quot;unable to obtain any definitive information about the [reported] use of hydrocyanic gas as an aggressive chemical.&quot; It is generally accepted that &quot;a lethal cocktail of mustard gas and the nerve agents Tabun, Sarin and VX&quot; was used, as reported by the BBC. Prior to the Halabja incident there were at least 21 documented smaller-scale chemical attacks against Iraqi Kurds, none of which prompted any serious response from the international community. 

== Aftermath ==

=== Discovery and response ===
The first images after the attack were taken by Iranian journalists who later spread the pictures in Iranian newspapers. Footage taken by a British ITN camera crew, airlifted by the Iranians, was also shown worldwide via news programmes. Some of those first pictures were taken by Iranian photographer Kaveh Golestan, who described the scene to Guy Dinmore of the &quot;Financial Times&quot;. He was about outside Halabja with a military helicopter when the Iraqi MiG-23 fighter-bombers flew in. He said &quot;it was not as big as a nuclear mushroom cloud, but several smaller ones: thick smoke.&quot; Golestan was shocked by the scenes on his arrival in the town, though he had seen gas attacks before at the front lines:

It was life frozen. Life had stopped, like watching a film and suddenly it hangs on one frame. It was a new kind of death to me. (…) The aftermath was worse. Victims were still being brought in. Some villagers came to our chopper. They had 15 or 16 beautiful children, begging us to take them to hospital. So all the press sat there and we were each handed a child to carry. As we took off, fluid came out of my little girl&#x27;s mouth and she died in my arms.

The Iraqi government did not publicly comment on the use of chemical weapons at Halabja until 23 March, and early statements by Iraqi officials on the matter were inconsistent. Although Iraq ultimately denied responsibility for the attack and blamed it on Iran, its initial silence, as well as the fact that Halabja was never a major part of Iraq&#x27;s wartime propaganda campaign against Iran, raises questions about the sincerity of this deflection.

International response at the time was muted. The United States (U.S.) government and its intelligence agencies suggested that Kurdish civilians had not been deliberately targeted, and attempted to place responsibility for the attack on Iran. The U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency and Central Intelligence Agency analyst Stephen C. Pelletiere claimed at the time that Iran was responsible for the gassing, an allegation which Pelletiere repeated in a 2003 op-ed in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. However, these claims were subsequently discredited. A briefing paper produced by the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office about how the British government should respond to the massacre, and whether or not economic sanctions should be imposed, came to the following conclusion: &quot;We believe it better to maintain a dialogue with others if we want to influence their actions. Punitive measures such as unilateral sanctions would not be effective in changing Iraq&#x27;s behaviour over chemical weapons, and would damage British interests to no avail.&quot; According to Tony Benn, the issue was raised in Parliament, but he was told that &quot;Saddam was an ally&quot;. Joost Hiltermann states that Iraq took the U.S. &quot;disinformation&quot; about Halabja as &quot;another green light ... to gather up and methodically kill tens of thousands of Kurds&quot; over the course of the ensuing Anfal campaign, which continued until September 1988. In Hiltermann&#x27;s analysis, the Anfal campaign &quot;surely was not a US policy objective; nevertheless, it resulted directly from failing to call the Iraqis to a halt [after Halabja].&quot;

In response to further Iraqi chemical attacks on Kurdish civilians after the August 1988 ceasefire with Iran, U.S. senators Claiborne Pell and Jesse Helms called for comprehensive economic sanctions against Iraq, including an oil embargo and severe limitations on the export of dual-use technology. Although the ensuing legislation passed in the U.S. Senate, it faced strong opposition within the House of Representatives and did not become law. In a rare rebuke, United States Secretary of State George Shultz condemned Iraq&#x27;s &quot;unjustified and abhorrent&quot; attacks, which Shultz&#x27;s assistant Charles E. Redman characterized as &quot;unacceptable to the civilized world.&quot; Even after these pronouncements, however, the State Department advised against sanctions.

Iraqi government documents dating from 16 March 1988 to several weeks later refer to &quot;a firm escalation of military might and cruelty [in Halabja],&quot; &quot;the bombing by our planes and our artillery on the area of Halabja and Khurmal, [killing] approximately 2,000 enemy forces of the Persians and Iranian agents [the PUK],&quot; the &quot;recent attack on Halabja with &quot;special&quot; ammunition,&quot; and, in one case, explicitly refer to &quot;the Iraqi chemical attack on Halabja.&quot; A 20 March 1988 Iraqi memorandum &quot;placed the casualty figures &#x27;as a result of the chemical attack&#x27; as 900–1,000 &#x27;killed and a large number wounded&#x27; near Halabjah and some 2,500 in the city itself. These numbers included &#x27;Khomeini guard, saboteurs, and the rest were civilians.&#x27;&quot; An Iraqi pilot explained in 2003 that the attack was motivated, in part, by the Iraqi perception that Kurdish collaboration with invading Iranian soldiers constituted &quot;high treason.&quot;

=== Legal framework of Iraqi chemical warfare ===
Iraq was a signatory of the 1925 Geneva Protocol, which prohibits &quot;the use in war of asphyxiating, poisonous or other gases, and of all analogous liquids materials or devices&quot;. However, legal experts stated that such use was only applicable between signatory states and not against its own nationals, noting the Protocol&#x27;s sentence &quot;That the High Contracting Parties...agree to be bound &quot;as between themselves&quot; according to the terms of this declaration.&quot; In other words, the Iraqi chemical attacks against Iran was a war crime, but not against its own population.

Such legality was reinforced when the United Nations Security Council condemned Iraq&#x27;s use of chemical weapons against Iran in Resolutions 612 and 620, while leaving out any reference of the same use against its own nationals. The Council was also at the time preoccupied with trying to get Iraq and Iran to accept Resolution 598 (which called for a ceasefire between the two nations), and restrained by concerns about Iraq&#x27;s sovereignty in what was regarded as an &#x27;internal affair&#x27;.
=== Destruction and partial restoration of Halabja ===
Survivors assisted by peshmerga and Iranians hastily buried most of the dead in makeshift mass graves. After Halabja was retaken from Iranian and Kurdish rebel forces, Iraqi troops in NBC suits came to Halabja to study the effectiveness of their weapons and attacks. The town, still littered with unburied dead, was then systematically razed by Iraqi forces using bulldozers and explosives. The Japanese government financed a $70 million project to provide access to safe drinking water in response to this. In the meanwhile, an Iraqi high-ranking authority officially confessed in a meeting with Javier Pérez de Cuéllar, the Secretary-General of the United Nations for the utilization of chemical weapons by Iraq.
=== Medical and genetic consequences ===
Ten years later, in 1998, at least 700 people were still being treated for the severe after effects of the attack and 500 of them were judged to be critically ill, even as &quot;the most severe cases may already have died.&quot; In surveys by local doctors, a higher percentage of medical disorders, miscarriages (outnumbering live births and 14 times higher than normal), colon cancer (10 times higher than normal), and heart diseases (quadrupled between 1990 and 1996) were found in Halabja compared to Chamchamal. Additionally, &quot;other cancers, respiratory ailments, skin and eye problems, fertility and reproductive disorders are measurably higher in Halabja and other areas caught in chemical attacks.&quot; Some of those who survived the attack or were apparently injured only lightly at the time later developed medical problems doctors believe stemmed from the chemicals, and there are concerns that the attack may be having a lasting genetic impact on the Kurdish population, as preliminary surveys showed increased rates of birth defects.

Some reports indicated that &quot;survivors of this particular attack have permanent injuries, including burns, and some exhibit symptoms of neurological damage, although this cannot yet be adequately confirmed.&quot;

In addition to human casualties and loss of life, animals, plants, wild life and the entire environment were severely affected and took years to recover 

=== Trials of Saddam and &#x27;Chemical Ali&#x27; ===
Saddam Hussein was not charged by the Iraqi Special Tribunal for crimes against humanity based on the events at Halabja. However, Iraqi prosecutors had &quot;500 documented baskets of crimes during the Hussein regime&quot; and Hussein was condemned to death based on just one case, the 1982 Dujail Massacre. Among several documents revealed during the trial of Saddam Hussein, one was a 1987 memo from Iraq&#x27;s military intelligence seeking permission from the president&#x27;s office to use mustard gas and the nerve agents sarin and tabun against Kurds. A second document said in reply that Saddam had ordered military intelligence to study the possibility of a &quot;sudden strike&quot; using such weapons against Iranian and Kurdish forces. An internal memo written by military intelligence confirmed it had received approval from the president&#x27;s office for a strike using &quot;special ammunition&quot; and emphasized that no strike would be launched without first informing the president. Saddam himself told the court: &quot;In relation to Iran, if any military or civil official claims that Saddam gave orders to use either conventional or special ammunition, which as explained is chemical, I will take responsibility with honor. But I will discuss any act committed against our people and any Iraqi citizen, whether Arab or Kurdish. I don&#x27;t accept any insult to my principles or to me personally.&quot; Kurdish survivors had no doubt Saddam was personally responsible and were disappointed he was being tried only over the killings in Dujail. Saddam was executed by hanging on 30 December 2006.

Saddam&#x27;s cousin Ali Hassan al-Majid (who commanded Iraqi forces in northern Iraq during that period, which earned him a nickname of &#x27;Chemical Ali&#x27;) was condemned to death by hanging by an Iraqi court in January 2010, after being found guilty of orchestrating the Halabja massacre. Al-Majid was first sentenced to hang in 2007 for his role in a 1988 military campaign against ethnic Kurds, codenamed Anfal, and in 2008 he also twice received a death sentence for his crimes against the Iraqi Shia Muslims, in particular for his role in crushing the 1991 uprisings in southern Iraq and his involvement in the 1999 killings in the Sadr City district of Baghdad (then called Saddam City). Al-Majid did not express remorse at his trials, stating his actions were in the interests of Iraqi security. He was executed by hanging on 25 January 2010. Among many other captured Iraqi government documents proving Iraqi responsibility for the attack, there is a recording of al-Majid boasting about the Kurds: &quot;I will kill them all with chemical weapons. Who is going to say anything? The international community? Fuck the international community and those who listen to them!&quot;

== International sources for technology and chemical precursors ==
The know-how and material for developing chemical weapons were obtained by Saddam&#x27;s regime from foreign sources. Most precursors for chemical weapons production came from Singapore (4,515 tons), the Netherlands (4,261 tons), Egypt (2,400 tons), India (2,343 tons), and West Germany (1,027 tons). One Indian company, Exomet Plastics, sent 2,292 tons of precursor chemicals to Iraq. Singapore-based firm Kim Al-Khaleej, affiliated to the United Arab Emirates, supplied more than 4,500 tons of VX, sarin and mustard gas precursors and production equipment to Iraq. Dieter Backfisch, managing director of West German company Karl Kolb GmbH, was quoted by saying in 1989 that &quot;for people in Germany poison gas is something quite terrible, but this does not worry customers abroad.&quot;

The 2002 International Crisis Group (ICG) no. 136 &quot;Arming Saddam: The Yugoslav Connection&quot; concludes it was &quot;tacit approval&quot; by many world governments that led to the Iraqi regime being armed with weapons of mass destruction, despite sanctions, because of the ongoing Iranian conflict. Among the dual-use exports provided to Iraq from American companies such as Alcolac International and Phillips was thiodiglycol, a substance which can also be used to manufacture mustard gas, according to leaked portions of Iraq&#x27;s &quot;full, final and complete&quot; disclosure of the sources for its weapons programs. The dual-use exports from U.S. companies to Iraq was enabled by a Reagan administration policy that removed Iraq from the State Department&#x27;s list of State Sponsors of Terrorism. Alcolac was named as a defendant in the Aziz v. Iraq case, but the case was eventually dismissed (Case No. 1:09-cv-00869-MJG). Both companies have since undergone reorganization. Phillips, once a subsidiary of Phillips Petroleum is now part of ConocoPhillips, an American oil and discount fossil fuel company. Alcolac International has since dissolved and reformed as Alcolac Inc.

On 23 December 2005, a Dutch court sentenced Frans van Anraat, a businessman who bought chemicals on the world market and sold them to Saddam&#x27;s regime, to 15 years in prison. The court ruled that the chemical attack on Halabja constituted genocide, but van Anraat was found guilty only of complicity in war crimes. In March 2008, the government of Iraq announced plans to take legal action against the suppliers of chemicals used in the attack.

In 2013, 20 Iraqi Kurds who were victims of the attack requested a judicial investigation into two unnamed French companies, saying that they were among 20 or more companies that helped Saddam Hussein construct a chemical weapons arsenal. The Kurds sought for an investigating judge to open a case.

== Controversies ==

=== Allegations of Iranian involvement ===


The U.S. State Department, in the immediate aftermath of the incident, took the official position that Iran was partly to blame. A preliminary Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) study at the time reported that Iran was responsible for the attack, an assessment which was used subsequently by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) for much of the early 1990s. The CIA&#x27;s senior political analyst for the Iran-Iraq war, Stephen C. Pelletiere, co-authored an unclassified analysis of the war which contained a brief summary of the DIA study&#x27;s key points. Pelletiere claimed that blue discolorations around the mouths of the victims and in their extremities suggested that a blood agent using cyanide was used in the attack at Halabja, and that only Iran was known to have used blood agents during the war. No proof that Iran had previously used hydrocyanic gas, as asserted by the DIA, was ever presented.

Joost Hiltermann, who was the principal researcher for Human Rights Watch between 1992 and 1994, conducted a two-year study of the massacre, including a field investigation in northern Iraq. Hiltermann writes: &quot;Analysis of thousands of captured Iraqi secret police documents and declassified U.S. government documents, as well as interviews with scores of Kurdish survivors, senior Iraqi defectors and retired U.S. intelligence officers, show (1) that Iraq carried out the attack on Halabja, and (2) that the United States, fully aware it was Iraq, accused Iran, Iraq&#x27;s enemy in a fierce war, of being partly responsible for the attack.&quot; This research concluded there were numerous other gas attacks, unquestionably perpetrated against the Kurds by the Iraqi armed forces. In 2001, Jean Pascal Zanders of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI)&#x27;s Chemical and Biological Warfare Project also dismissed the allegations, arguing that &quot;The coloring of the victims is more suggestive of sarin, which was in Iraq&#x27;s arsenal.&quot; Leo Casey, writing in &quot;Dissent Magazine&quot; in 2003, observed that Pelletiere&#x27;s analysis was based solely on images and testimony of blue discolorations and ignored all other evidence—including the recollections of hundreds of Kurdish witnesses; academic studies based on medical examinations, soil samples, and autopsies; and captured Iraqi government documents—proving Iraqi culpability.

Hiltermann noted that although cyanosis (the medical term for the blue discolorations in question) is etymologically related to cyanide, the former condition indicates only a blood supply deprived of oxygen, and is in no way sufficient to diagnose cyanide poisoning; in fact, &quot;it could just as easily suggest the use of a nerve agent.&quot; Furthermore, &quot;Even the proven presence of cyanide gas at Halabja would not necessarily implicate Iran,&quot; for two reasons outlined by Hiltermann. Prior to Halabja, Iranian forces made widespread use of amyl nitrite to counter what they repeatedly alleged was Iraqi cyanide gas. If those Iranian claims are accepted, then &quot;By that logic, Iraq could also be implicated in any Halabja deaths by cyanide.&quot; However, cyanide evaporates rapidly and tabun—a major part of Iraq&#x27;s chemical arsenal at the time—contains cyanide as an essential ingredient, factors that rendered it impossible for the UN to confirm any Iraqi use of cyanide gas during the Iran–Iraq war: &quot;Because of its connection to tabun, if hydrocyanide is found in a given environment, it could be either the residual effect of poorly manufactured tabun or a breakdown element when tabun decomposes.&quot;

According to Hiltermann, the literature on the Iran–Iraq war reflects a number of allegations of chemical weapons use by Iran, but these are &quot;marred by a lack of specificity as to time and place, and the failure to provide any sort of evidence.&quot; Hiltermann called these allegations &quot;mere assertions&quot; and added that &quot;no persuasive evidence of the claim that Iran was the primary culprit was ever presented.&quot; Many sources state that Iran&#x27;s chemical weapons capability at the time was extremely limited to non-existent, although it is possible that Iran could have captured chemical munitions from Iraqi troops; for example, military analyst Ahmed Hashim recounted that &quot;The Iranians only had tear gas. No cyanide.&quot; In fact, far from having a meaningful chemical warfare capability, Iran&#x27;s effectiveness merely in protecting its own soldiers from chemical attacks is open to question as the low-quality protective equipment that it belatedly received from East Germany and North Korea was intended for use against paint fumes; the unwillingness of many Iranians to shave their beards also limited the efficacy of the masks. A 1987 UN report conducted at the behest of both belligerents discovered weapon fragments that established Iraqi responsibility for chemical attacks on Iranian soldiers and civilians, but could not substantiate Iraq&#x27;s allegations of Iranian chemical weapons use: &quot;Iraqi forces have been affected by mustard gas and a pulmonary element, possibly phosgene. In the absence of conclusive evidence of the weapons used, it could not be determined how the injuries were caused.&quot; Evidence suggests that these Iraqi chemical casualties were likely the result of &quot;blowback,&quot; whereas the evidence that Iraq submitted to the UN—such as two Iranian 130 mm shells that UN specialists found had &quot;no internal chemical-resistant coating&quot; and were &quot;normally used for filling with high explosives&quot;—did not withstand scrutiny; UN official Iqbal Riza later acknowledged that Iraq&#x27;s evidence was &quot;clearly fabricated.&quot; However, the report&#x27;s phrasing—&quot;chemical weapons were again used against Iranian forces by Iraqi forces ... now also Iraqi forces have sustained injuries from chemical warfare&quot;—contributed to an erroneous perception that Iran and Iraq were equally at fault.

Documents uncovered after the 2003 invasion of Iraq show that Iraqi military intelligence was not aware of any large-scale chemical attacks by Iranian forces, although a March 1987 document describes five small-scale chemical attacks perpetrated by the Iranians (four involving mustard gas and one involving phosgene, with the likely source being captured Iraqi munitions), and there are also reports of Iranian use of tear gas and white phosphorus. As recounted by Williamson Murray and Kevin M. Woods: &quot;Despite rumors of Iranian chemical threats and occasional battlefield use (mostly [tear gas] and captured Iraqi chemical rounds), by 1988, the Iraqis were satisfied that there was no near-term threat. An intelligence report [dated 27 June 1988] discussing North Korea&#x27;s help to the Iranians to develop an indigenous mustard gas capability, however, pointed toward a future where Iraqi troops might need to worry about chemical attacks.&quot;
=== 2006 Halabja memorial protest ===
In March 2003, the Monument of Halabja Martyrs was built in the still largely ruined city. On 16 March 2006, a few thousand residents, many of them students in high school or university, demonstrated at the site in protest of what they perceived as the neglect of living Halabjans and the Kurdish leadership&#x27;s commodification of the tragedy. The memorial was set on fire, destroying most of its archives; student protestor Kurda Ahmed was shot dead by the police and dozens of people were injured. It was later rebuilt as the Halabja Memorial Monument, also known as Halabja Monument and Peace Museum.

== In popular culture ==
* In 2008, Kayhan Kalhor and Brooklyn Rider released the album &quot;Silent City&quot; in memory of the Halabja Massacre. As Kalhor writes on the back cover, &quot;The piece commemorates the Kurdish village of Halabja in Iraqi Kurdistan. It is based on an altered A-minor scale and uses Kurdish themes to remember the Kurdish people.&quot; In 2011, Kayhan Kalhor, Yo-Yo Ma and The Silk Road Ensemble performed &quot;Silent City&quot; at Sanders Theater. Silk Road Project released video of the last part of the performance on YouTube.
* Canadian industrial-electronic band Skinny Puppy comments upon the Halabja chemical attacks in their song &quot;VX Gas Attack&quot; on their 1988 album &quot;VIVIsectVI&quot;.
* In 2001, the movie &quot;Jiyan&quot; about the Halabja attack was released. This movie was directed by Jano Rosebiani.
* 1988 released in 2023 tells the story of the 1988 Halabja attack.

<text>Thumbcuffs are a metal restraining device that lock thumbs in proximity to each other.

Thumbcuffs were originally intended for use by detectives, narcotics officers and off-duty policemen, their size allowing them to be carried in the pocket. Most are rigid devices, while some used in Asian countries are chain-linked, like miniature handcuffs.

Thumbcuffs are rarely used due to an increased possibility of injury, most commonly by tight cuffs blocking blood circulation. Their trade is illegal in the European Union. Handcuffs are usually used instead.

Thumbcuffs may also be used as improvised &quot;toecuffs&quot; by locking the big toes in proximity to each other.

Thumbcuffs with double locks have a lockspring which, when engaged, usually using the top of the key, stops the thumbcuff from ratcheting tighter and prevents the subject from tightening them, possibly causing injury. Double locks also make picking the locks more difficult.

<text>Himalia (), also known as Jupiter VI, is the largest irregular satellite of Jupiter. With a diameter of at least , it is the sixth largest Jovian satellite, after the four Galilean moons and Amalthea. It was discovered by Charles Dillon Perrine at the Lick Observatory on 3 December 1904 and is named after the nymph Himalia, who bore three sons of Zeus (the Greek equivalent of Jupiter). It is one of the largest planetary moons in the Solar System not imaged in detail, and the third largest not imaged in detail within the orbit of Neptune.

== Discovery ==
Himalia was discovered by Charles Dillon Perrine at the Lick Observatory on 3 December 1904 in photographs taken with the 36-inch Crossley reflecting telescope which he had recently rebuilt. Himalia is Jupiter&#x27;s most easily observed small satellite; though Amalthea is brighter, its proximity to the planet&#x27;s brilliant disk makes it a far more difficult object to view.

=== Name ===
Himalia is named after the nymph Himalia, who bore three sons of Zeus (the Greek equivalent of Jupiter). The moon did not receive its present name until 1975; before then, it was simply known as or Jupiter Satellite VI, although calls for a full name appeared shortly after its and Elara&#x27;s discovery; A.C.D. Crommelin wrote in 1905:
The moon was sometimes called Hestia, after the Greek goddess, from 1955 to 1975.

== Orbit ==
At a distance of about from Jupiter, Himalia takes about 250 Earth days to complete one orbit around Jupiter. It is the largest member of the Himalia group, which are a group of small moons orbiting Jupiter at a distance from to , with inclined orbits at an angle of 27.5 degrees to Jupiter&#x27;s equator. Their orbits are continuously changing due to solar and planetary perturbations.

== Physical characteristics ==
Himalia&#x27;s rotational period is . Himalia appears neutral in color (grey), like the other members of its group, with colour indices B−V=0.62, V−R=0.4, similar to a C-type asteroid. Measurements by &quot;Cassini&quot; confirm a featureless spectrum, with a slight absorption at , which could indicate the presence of water.
Although Himalia is the sixth-largest moon of Jupiter, it is the fifth-most massive. Amalthea is only a few km bigger, but less massive.
Resolved images of Himalia by &quot;Cassini&quot; have led to a size estimate of , while ground-based estimates suggest that Himalia is large, with a diameter around . In May 2018, Himalia occulted a star, allowing for precise measurements of its size. The occultation was observed from the US state of Georgia. From the occultation, Himalia was given a size estimate of , in agreement with earlier ground-based estimates.

=== Mass ===
In 2005, Emelyanov estimated Himalia to have a mass of (GM=0.28±0.04), based on a perturbation of Elara on July 15, 1949 (when the distance between them became a mere 64246.04 kilometers). JPL&#x27;s Solar System dynamics website assumes that Himalia has a mass of (GM=0.15) with a radius of .

Himalia&#x27;s density will depend on whether it has an average radius of about (geometric mean from &quot;Cassini&quot;) or a radius closer to .

== Exploration ==

In November 2000, the &quot;Cassini&quot; spacecraft, en route to Saturn, made a number of images of Himalia, including photos from a distance of 4.4 million km. Himalia covers only a few pixels, but seems to be an elongated object with axes and , close to the Earth-based estimations.

In February and March 2007, the &quot;New Horizons&quot; spacecraft en route to Pluto made a series of images of Himalia, culminating in photos from a distance of 8 million km. Again, Himalia appears only a few pixels across.

== Himalia ring ==

In September 2006, as NASA&#x27;s &quot;New Horizons&quot; mission to Pluto approached Jupiter for a gravity assist, it photographed what appeared to be a faint new planetary ring parallel with and slightly inside Himalia&#x27;s orbit. Because the small (4-km) moon Dia, which had a similar orbit to Himalia, had gone missing since its discovery in 2000, there was some speculation that the ring could be debris from an impact of Dia into Himalia, suggesting that Jupiter continued to gain and lose small moons through collisions.
However, an impact by an object the size of Dia would produce far more material than the calculated amount of ejected material needed to form the ring, although it is possible that a smaller, unknown moon may have been involved instead.
The recovery of Dia in 2010 and 2011 disproved any connection between Dia and the Himalia ring.

<text>Elara is a prograde irregular satellite of Jupiter. It was discovered by Charles Dillon Perrine at Lick Observatory in 1905 in photographs taken with the 36&quot; Crossley reflecting telescope which he had recently rebuilt. It is the eighth-largest moon of Jupiter and is named after Elara, one of Zeus&#x27;s lovers and the mother of the giant Tityos.

Elara did not receive its present name until 1975; before then, it was simply known as . It was sometimes called &quot;Hera&quot; between 1955 and 1975. It has a mean radius of just , thus it is 2% of the size of Europa. However, it is half the size of Himalia, so it is the second-biggest moon in the Himalia group. It might be a captured type C or D asteroid, for it reflects very little light.

Elara belongs to the Himalia group, moons orbiting between 11 and 13 gigametres from Jupiter at an inclination of about 27.5°. Its orbital elements are as of January 2000. They are continuously changing due to solar and planetary perturbations.

==Discovery==
Elara was discovered by Charles Dillon Perrine of the Lick Observatory on January 6, 1905, the day after the discovery of Himalia, also by Perrine, was announced. However, poor weather conditions delayed the confirmation of the discovery till the 21st of February.

== Exploration ==
=== New Horizons encounter ===
In February and March 2007, the &quot;New Horizons&quot; spacecraft to Pluto captured Elara in several LORRI images from a distance of five million miles.

<text>Khon Kaen (, ; , ) is one of Thailand&#x27;s 76 provinces (&quot;changwat&quot;). It is a triply-landlocked province in central northeastern Thailand. Neighboring provinces are (from north, clockwise) Nong Bua Lamphu, Udon Thani, Kalasin, Maha Sarakham, Buriram, Nakhon Ratchasima, Chaiyaphum, Phetchabun, and Loei.

==History==
Several bronze and iron tools used as axes have been discovered in the province, along with a bronze ring attached to a skeleton. This is in addition to a copper axe found from 4,600 to 4,800 (2600 BC to 2800 BC), the oldest in Southeast Asia. During the Dvaravati period, Khon Kaen was influenced by the culture of the central region. The oldest inscription found in Khon Kaen dates back to the 8th century and is written in the Old Mon language, suggesting the presence of Mon people in the area at that time.The Dvaravati culture is believed to have played a significant role in the region, and the Nyah Kur people are thought to be descendants of the Dvaravati Mon people. During the 10th–11th centuries and onwards, the area came under Khmer influence, as evidenced by various inscriptions. The area fell into the control of Lan Xang before coming under Central Thai control.

The first city of the area was established in 1783 when Rajakruluang settled there with 330 people. King Rama I made Rajakruluang the first governor of the area when establishing tighter connections with the Isan area. The main city was moved six times until in 1879 it reached its present-day location at Nuang Kaw. Khon Kaen was under the governance of Udon in the early period of Rattanakosin, c. 2450 BCE. The Integrated Opisthorchiasis Control Program, also known as the Lawa Project, an internationally recognized liver fluke control program, has its offices in the Ban Phai and Ban Haet Districts south of Khon Kaen city.

Other satellite cities that has to do with the separation from the city of Suwannabhumi and later separated into a city in the province of Khon Kaen after 1797 that includes the city of Mancha Khiri district.

Khon Kaen was incorporated as a city in 1797.

<doc id="207066" wikidata="Q16960" url="?curid=207066" title="Ananke (moon)">
<text>Ananke () is a retrograde irregular moon of Jupiter. It was discovered by Seth Barnes Nicholson at Mount Wilson Observatory in 1951. It is named after the Greek mythological Ananke, the personification of necessity, and the mother of the Moirai (Fates) by Zeus. The adjectival form of the name is &quot;Anankean&quot;.

Ananke did not receive its present name until 1975; before then, it was simply known as . It was sometimes called &quot;Adrastea&quot; between 1955 and 1975 (Adrastea is now the name of another satellite of Jupiter).

Ananke gives its name to the Ananke group, retrograde irregular moons which orbit Jupiter between 19.3 and 22.7 Gm, at inclinations of roughly 150°.

==Orbit==

Ananke orbits Jupiter on a high-eccentricity and high-inclination retrograde orbit. Fifteen irregular satellites orbiting Jupiter have been discovered since 2000 following similar orbits. The orbital elements are as of January 2000. They are continuously changing due to solar and planetary perturbations. The diagram illustrates Ananke&#x27;s orbit in relation to other retrograde irregular satellites of Jupiter. The eccentricity of selected orbits is represented by the yellow segments (extending from the pericentre to the apocentre). The outermost regular satellite Callisto is located for reference.

Given these orbital elements and the physical characteristics known so far, Ananke is thought to be the largest remnant of an original break-up, forming the Ananke group.

==Physical characteristics==

In the visible spectrum, Ananke appears neutral to light-red (colour indices B-V=0.90 V-R=0.38).

The infrared spectrum is similar to P-type asteroids but with a possible indication of water.

<doc id="207068" wikidata="Q181154" url="?curid=207068" title="Mu'awiya I">
<text>Mu&#x27;awiya I ( ; –April 680) was the founder and first caliph of the Umayyad Caliphate, ruling from 661 until his death. He became caliph less than thirty years after the death of the Islamic prophet Muhammad and immediately after the four Rashidun (&#x27;rightly-guided&#x27;) caliphs. Unlike his predecessors, who had been close, early companions of Muhammad, Mu&#x27;awiya was a relatively late follower of Muhammad.

Mu&#x27;awiya and his father Abu Sufyan had opposed Muhammad, their distant Qurayshite kinsman and later Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s brother-in-law, until Muhammad captured Mecca in 630. Afterward, Mu&#x27;awiya became one of Muhammad&#x27;s scribes. He was appointed by Caliph Abu Bakr () as a deputy commander in the conquest of Syria. He moved up the ranks through Umar&#x27;s caliphate () until becoming governor of Syria during the reign of his Umayyad kinsman, Caliph Uthman (). He allied with the province&#x27;s powerful Banu Kalb tribe, developed the defenses of its coastal cities, and directed the war effort against the Byzantine Empire, including the first Muslim naval campaigns. In response to Uthman&#x27;s assassination in 656, Mu&#x27;awiya took up the cause of avenging the murdered caliph and opposed the election of Ali. During the First Muslim Civil War, the two led their armies to a stalemate at the Battle of Siffin in 657, prompting an abortive series of arbitration talks to settle the dispute. Afterward, Mu&#x27;awiya gained recognition as caliph by his Syrian supporters and his ally Amr ibn al-As, who conquered Egypt from Ali&#x27;s governor in 658. Following the assassination of Ali in 661, Mu&#x27;awiya compelled Ali&#x27;s son and successor Hasan to abdicate and Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s suzerainty was acknowledged throughout the Caliphate.

Domestically, Mu&#x27;awiya relied on loyalist Syrian Arab tribes and Syria&#x27;s Christian-dominated bureaucracy. He is credited with establishing government departments responsible for the postal route, correspondence, and chancellery. He was the first caliph whose name appeared on coins, inscriptions, or documents of the nascent Islamic empire. Externally, he engaged his troops in almost yearly land and sea raids against the Byzantines, including a failed siege of Constantinople. In Iraq and the eastern provinces, he delegated authority to the powerful governors al-Mughira and Ziyad ibn Abi Sufyan, the latter of whom he controversially adopted as his brother. Under Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s direction, the Muslim conquest of Ifriqiya (central North Africa) was launched by the commander Uqba ibn Nafi in 670, while the conquests in Khurasan and Sijistan on the eastern frontier were resumed.

Although Mu&#x27;awiya confined the influence of his Umayyad clan to the governorship of Medina, he nominated his own son, Yazid I, as his successor. It was an unprecedented move in Islamic politics and opposition to it by prominent Muslim leaders, including Ali&#x27;s son Husayn, and Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr, persisted after Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s death, culminating with the outbreak of the Second Muslim Civil War. While there is considerable admiration for Mu&#x27;awiya in the contemporary sources, he has been criticized for lacking the justice and piety of the Rashidun and transforming the office of the caliphate into a kingship. Besides these criticisms, Sunni Muslim tradition honors him as a companion of Muhammad and a scribe of Qur&#x27;anic revelation. In Shia Islam, Mu&#x27;awiya is reviled for opposing Ali, accused of poisoning his son Hasan, and held to have accepted Islam without conviction.

==Origins and early life==
Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s year of birth is uncertain, with 597, 603 or 605 cited by early Islamic sources. His father Abu Sufyan ibn Harb was a prominent Meccan merchant who led trade caravans to Syria, then part of the Byzantine Empire. He emerged as the leader of the Banu Abd Shams clan of the polytheistic Quraysh, the dominant tribe of Mecca, during the early stages of the Quraysh&#x27;s conflict with Muhammad. The latter also hailed from the Quraysh and was distantly related to Mu&#x27;awiya via their common paternal ancestor, Abd Manaf ibn Qusayy. Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s mother, Hind bint Utba, was also a member of the Banu Abd Shams.

In 624, Muhammad and his followers attempted to intercept a Meccan caravan led by Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s father on its return from Syria, prompting Abu Sufyan to call for reinforcements. The Qurayshite relief army was routed in the ensuing Battle of Badr, in which Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s elder brother Hanzala and their maternal grandfather, Utba ibn Rabi&#x27;a, were killed. Abu Sufyan replaced the slain leader of the Meccan army, Abu Jahl, and led the Meccans to victory against the Muslims at the Battle of Uhud in 625. After his abortive siege of Muhammad in Medina at the Battle of the Trench in 627, he lost his leadership position among the Quraysh.

Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s father was not a participant in the truce negotiations at Hudaybiyya between the Quraysh and Muhammad in 628. The following year, Muhammad married Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s widowed sister Umm Habiba, who had embraced Islam fifteen years earlier. The marriage may have reduced Abu Sufyan&#x27;s hostility toward Muhammad and Abu Sufyan negotiated with him in Medina in 630 after confederates of the Quraysh violated the Hudaybiyya truce. When Muhammad captured Mecca in 630, Mu&#x27;awiya, his father, and his elder brother Yazid embraced Islam. According to accounts cited by the early Muslim historians al-Baladhuri and Ibn Hajar, Mu&#x27;awiya had secretly become a Muslim from the time of the Hudaybiyya negotiations. By 632 Muslim authority extended across Arabia with Medina as the seat of the Muslim government. As part of Muhammad&#x27;s efforts to reconcile with the Quraysh, Mu&#x27;awiya was made one of his (scribes), being one of seventeen literate members of the Quraysh at that time. Abu Sufyan moved to Medina to maintain his newfound influence in the nascent Muslim community.

==Governorship of Syria==
===Early military career and administrative promotions===
After Muhammad died in 632, Abu Bakr became caliph (leader of the Muslim community). He and his successors Umar, Uthman, and Ali are often known as the (&#x27;rightly-guided&#x27;) caliphs to distinguish them from Mu&#x27;awiya and his Umayyad dynastic successors. Having to contend with challenges to his leadership from the Ansar, the natives of Medina who had provided Muhammad safe haven from his erstwhile Meccan opponents, and the mass defections of several Arab tribes, Abu Bakr reached out to the Quraysh, particularly its two strongest clans, the Banu Makhzum and Banu Abd Shams, to shore up support for the Caliphate. Among those Qurayshites whom he appointed to suppress the rebel Arab tribes during the Ridda wars (632–633) was Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s brother Yazid. Afterward, he was dispatched as one of four commanders in charge of the Muslim conquest of Byzantine Syria in . The caliph appointed Mu&#x27;awiya commander of Yazid&#x27;s vanguard. Through these appointments Abu Bakr gave the family of Abu Sufyan a stake in the conquest of Syria, where Abu Sufyan already owned property in the vicinity of Damascus.

Abu Bakr&#x27;s successor Umar () appointed a leading companion of Muhammad, Abu Ubayda ibn al-Jarrah, as the general commander of the Muslim army in Syria in 636 after the rout of the Byzantines at the Battle of Yarmouk, which paved the way for the conquest of the rest of Syria. Mu&#x27;awiya was among the Arab troops that entered Jerusalem with Caliph Umar in 637. Afterward, Mu&#x27;awiya and Yazid were dispatched by Abu Ubayda to conquer the coastal towns of Sidon, Beirut and Byblos. Following the death of Abu Ubayda in the plague of Amwas in 639, Umar split the command of Syria, appointing Yazid as governor of the military districts of Damascus, Jordan and Palestine, and the veteran commander Iyad ibn Ghanm governor of Homs and the Jazira (Upper Mesopotamia). When Yazid succumbed to the plague later that year, Umar appointed Mu&#x27;awiya the military and fiscal governor of Damascus, and possibly Jordan as well. In 640 or 641, Mu&#x27;awiya captured Caesarea, the district capital of Byzantine Palestine, and then captured Ascalon, completing the Muslim conquest of Palestine. As early as 640 or 641, Mu&#x27;awiya may have led a campaign against Cilicia and proceeded to Euchaita, deep in Byzantine Anatolia. In 644, he led a foray against the Anatolian city of Amorium.

The successive promotions of Abu Sufyan&#x27;s sons contradicted Umar&#x27;s efforts to otherwise curtail the influence of the Qurayshite aristocracy in the Muslim state in favor of the earliest Muslim converts (i.e. the Muhajirun and Ansar groups). According to the historian Leone Caetani, this exceptional treatment stemmed from Umar&#x27;s personal respect for the Umayyads, the branch of the Banu Abd Shams to which Mu&#x27;awiya belonged. This is doubted by the historian Wilferd Madelung, who surmises that Umar had little choice, due to the lack of a suitable alternative to Mu&#x27;awiya in Syria and the ongoing plague in the region, which precluded the deployment of commanders more preferable to Umar from Medina.

Upon the accession of Caliph Uthman (), Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s governorship was enlarged to include Palestine, while a companion of Muhammad, Umayr ibn Sa&#x27;d al-Ansari, was confirmed as governor of the Homs-Jazira district. In late 646 or early 647, Uthman attached the Homs-Jazira district to Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s Syrian governorship, greatly increasing the military manpower at his disposal.

===Consolidation of local power===
During the reign of Uthman, Mu&#x27;awiya allied with the Banu Kalb, the predominant tribe in the Syrian steppe extending from the oasis of Dumat al-Jandal in the south to the approaches of Palmyra and the chief component of the Quda&#x27;a confederation present throughout Syria. Medina consistently courted the Kalb, which had remained mostly neutral during the Arab–Byzantine wars, particularly after the central government&#x27;s entreaties to the Byzantines&#x27; principal Arab allies, the Christian Ghassanids, were rebuffed. Before the advent of Islam in Syria, the Kalb and the Quda&#x27;a, long under the influence of Greco-Aramaic culture and the Monophysite church, had served Byzantium as subordinates of its Ghassanid client kings to guard the Syrian frontier against invasions by the Sasanian Persians and the latter&#x27;s Arab clients, the Lakhmids. By the time the Muslims entered Syria, the Kalb and the Quda&#x27;a had accumulated significant military experience and were accustomed to hierarchical order and military obedience. To harness their strength and thereby secure his foothold in Syria, Mu&#x27;awiya consolidated ties to the Kalb&#x27;s ruling house, the clan of Bahdal ibn Unayf, by wedding the latter&#x27;s daughter Maysun in . He also married Maysun&#x27;s paternal cousin, Na&#x27;ila bint Umara, for a short period.

Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s reliance on the native Syrian Arab tribes was compounded by the heavy toll inflicted on the Muslim troops in Syria by the plague of Amwas, which caused troop numbers to dwindle from 24,000 in 637 to 4,000 in 639. Moreover, the focus of Arabian tribal migration was toward the Sasanian front in Iraq. Mu&#x27;awiya oversaw a liberal recruitment policy that resulted in considerable numbers of Christian tribesmen and frontier peasants filling the ranks of his regular and auxiliary forces. Indeed, the Christian Tanukhids and the mixed Muslim–Christian Banu Tayy formed part of Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s army in northern Syria. To help pay for his troops, Mu&#x27;awiya requested and was granted ownership by Uthman of the abundant, income-producing, Byzantine crown lands in Syria, which were previously designated by Umar as communal property for the Muslim army.

Although Syria&#x27;s rural, Aramaic-speaking Christian population remained largely intact, the Muslim conquest had caused a mass flight of Greek Christian urbanites from Damascus, Aleppo, Latakia and Tripoli to Byzantine territory, while those who remained held pro-Byzantine sympathies. In contrast to the other conquered regions of the Caliphate, where new garrison cities were established to house Muslim troops and their administration, in Syria the troops settled in existing cities, including Damascus, Homs, Jerusalem, Tiberias, Aleppo and Qinnasrin. Mu&#x27;awiya restored, repopulated and garrisoned the coastal cities of Antioch, Balda, Tartus, Maraclea and Baniyas. In Tripoli he settled significant numbers of Jews, while sending to Homs, Antioch and Baalbek Persian holdovers from the Sasanian occupation of Byzantine Syria in the early 7th century. Upon Uthman&#x27;s direction, Mu&#x27;awiya settled groups of the nomadic Tamim, Asad and Qays tribes to areas north of the Euphrates in the vicinity of Raqqa.

===Naval campaigns against Byzantium and conquest of Armenia===
Mu&#x27;awiya initiated the Arab naval campaigns against the Byzantines in the eastern Mediterranean, requisitioning the harbors of Tripoli, Beirut, Tyre, Acre, and Jaffa. Umar had rejected Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s request to launch a naval invasion of Cyprus, citing concerns about the Muslim forces&#x27; safety at sea, but Uthman allowed him to commence the campaign in 647, after refusing an earlier entreaty. Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s rationale was that the Byzantine-held island posed a threat to Arab positions along the Syrian coast, and that it could be easily neutralized. The exact year of the raid is unclear, with the early Arabic sources providing a range between 647 and 650, while two Greek inscriptions in the Cypriot village of Solois cite two raids launched between 648 and 650.

According to the 9th-century historians al-Baladhuri and Khalifa ibn Khayyat, Mu&#x27;awiya led the raid in person accompanied by his wife, Katwa bint Qaraza ibn Abd Amr of the Qurayshite Banu Nawfal, alongside the commander Ubada ibn al-Samit. Katwa died on the island and at some point Mu&#x27;awiya married her sister Fakhita. In a different narrative by the early Muslim sources, the raid was instead conducted by Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s admiral Abd Allah ibn Qays, who landed at Salamis before occupying the island. In either case, the Cypriots were forced to pay a tribute equal to that which they had paid the Byzantines. Mu&#x27;awiya established a garrison and a mosque to maintain the Caliphate&#x27;s influence on the island, which became a staging ground for the Arabs and the Byzantines to launch raids against each other&#x27;s territories. The inhabitants of Cyprus were largely left to their own devices and archaeological evidence indicates uninterrupted prosperity during this period.

Dominance of the eastern Mediterranean enabled Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s naval forces to raid Crete and Rhodes in 653. From the raid on Rhodes, Mu&#x27;awiya remitted significant war spoils to Uthman. In 654 or 655, a joint naval expedition launched from Alexandria, Egypt and the harbors of Syria routed a Byzantine fleet commanded by the Byzantine Emperor Constans II () off the Lycian coast at the Battle of the Masts. Constans II was forced to sail to Sicily, opening the way for an ultimately unsuccessful Arab naval attack on Constantinople. The Arabs were commanded by either the governor of Egypt, Abd Allah ibn Abi Sarh, or Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s lieutenant Abu&#x27;l-A&#x27;war.

Meanwhile, after two previous attempts by the Arabs to conquer Armenia, the third attempt in 650 ended with a three-year truce reached between Mu&#x27;awiya and the Byzantine envoy Procopios in Damascus. In 653, Mu&#x27;awiya received the submission of the Armenian leader Theodore Rshtuni, which the Byzantine emperor practically conceded when he withdrew from Armenia that year. In 655, Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s lieutenant commander Habib ibn Maslama al-Fihri captured Theodosiopolis and deported Rshtuni to Syria, solidifying Arab rule over Armenia.

==First Fitna==

Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s domain was generally immune to the growing discontent prevailing in Medina, Egypt and Kufa against Uthman&#x27;s policies in the 650s. The exception was Abu Dharr al-Ghifari, who had been sent to Damascus for openly condemning Uthman&#x27;s enrichment of his kinsmen. He criticized the lavish sums that Mu&#x27;awiya invested in building his Damascus residence, the Khadra Palace, prompting Mu&#x27;awiya to expel him. Uthman&#x27;s confiscation of crown lands in Iraq and his alleged nepotism drove the Quraysh and the dispossessed elites of Kufa and Egypt to oppose the caliph.

Uthman sent for assistance from Mu&#x27;awiya when rebels from Egypt besieged his home in June 656. Mu&#x27;awiya dispatched a relief army toward Medina, but it withdrew at Wadi al-Qura when word reached them of Uthman&#x27;s killing. Ali, Muhammad&#x27;s cousin and son-in-law, was recognized as caliph in Medina. Mu&#x27;awiya withheld allegiance to Ali and, according to some reports, the latter deposed him by sending his own governor to Syria, who was denied entry into the province by Mu&#x27;awiya. This is rejected by Madelung, according to whom no formal relations existed between the caliph and the governor of Syria for seven months from the date of Ali&#x27;s election.

Soon after becoming caliph, Ali was opposed by much of the Quraysh led by al-Zubayr and Talha, both prominent companions of Muhammad, and Muhammad&#x27;s wife A&#x27;isha, who feared the loss of their own influence under Ali. The ensuing civil war became known as the First Fitna. Ali defeated the triumvirate near Basra at the Battle of the Camel, which ended in the deaths of al-Zubayr and Talha, both potential contenders for the caliphate, and the retirement of A&#x27;isha to Medina. With his position in Iraq, Egypt and Arabia secure, Ali turned his attention toward Mu&#x27;awiya. Unlike the other provincial governors, Mu&#x27;awiya had a strong and loyal power base, demanded revenge for the slaying of his Umayyad kinsman Uthman, and could not be easily replaced. At this point, Mu&#x27;awiya did not yet claim the caliphate and his principal aim was keeping power in Syria.

===Preparations for war===
Ali&#x27;s victory in Basra left Mu&#x27;awiya vulnerable, his territory wedged between Ali&#x27;s forces in Iraq and Egypt, while the war with the Byzantines was ongoing in the north. In 657 or 658 Mu&#x27;awiya secured his northern frontier with Byzantium by making a truce with the emperor, enabling him to focus the bulk of his troops on the impending battle with the caliph. After failing to gain the defection of Egypt&#x27;s governor, Qays ibn Sa&#x27;d, he resolved to end the Umayyad family&#x27;s hostility to Amr ibn al-As, the conqueror and former governor of Egypt, whom they accused of involvement in Uthman&#x27;s death. Mu&#x27;awiya and Amr, who was popular with the Arab troops of Egypt, made a pact whereby the latter joined the coalition against Ali and Mu&#x27;awiya publicly agreed to install Amr as Egypt&#x27;s lifetime governor should they oust Ali&#x27;s appointee.

Although he had the firm backing of the Kalb, to shore up the rest of his base in Syria, Mu&#x27;awiya was advised by his kinsman al-Walid ibn Uqba to secure an alliance with the Yemenite tribes of Himyar, Kinda and Hamdan, who collectively dominated the Homs garrison. He employed the veteran commander and Kindite nobleman Shurahbil ibn Simt, who was widely respected in Syria, to rally the Yemenites to his side. He then enlisted support from the dominant tribal leader of Palestine, the Judham chief Natil ibn Qays, by allowing the latter&#x27;s confiscation of the district&#x27;s treasury to go unpunished. The efforts bore fruit and demands for war against Ali grew throughout Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s domain. When Ali sent his envoy, the veteran commander and chieftain of the Bajila, Jarir ibn Abd Allah, to Mu&#x27;awiya, the latter responded with a letter that amounted to a declaration of war against the caliph, whose legitimacy he refused to recognize.

===Battle of Siffin and arbitration===
In the first week of June 657, the armies of Mu&#x27;awiya and Ali met at Siffin near Raqqa and engaged in days of skirmishes interrupted by a month-long truce on 19 June. During the truce, Mu&#x27;awiya dispatched an embassy led by Habib ibn Maslama, who presented Ali with an ultimatum to hand over Uthman&#x27;s alleged killers, abdicate and allow a (consultative council) to decide the caliphate. Ali rebuffed Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s envoys and on 18 July declared that the Syrians remained obstinate in their refusal to recognize his sovereignty. On the following day, a week of duels between Ali&#x27;s and Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s top commanders ensued. The main battle between the two armies commenced on 26 July. As Ali&#x27;s troops advanced toward Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s tent, the governor of Syria ordered his elite troops forward and they bested the Iraqis before the tide turned against the Syrians the next day with the deaths of two of Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s leading commanders, Ubayd Allah, a son of Caliph Umar, and Dhu&#x27;l-Kala Samayfa, the so-called &#x27;king of Himyar&#x27;.

Mu&#x27;awiya rejected suggestions from his advisers to engage Ali in a duel and definitively end hostilities. The battle climaxed on the so-called &#x27;Night of Clamor&#x27; on 28 July, which saw Ali&#x27;s forces take the advantage in a melée as the death toll mounted on both sides. According to the account of the scholar al-Zuhri (d. 742), this prompted Amr ibn al-As to counsel Mu&#x27;awiya the following morning to have a number of his men tie leaves of the Qur&#x27;an on their lances in an appeal to the Iraqis to settle the conflict through consultation. According to the scholar al-Sha&#x27;bi (d. 723), al-Ash&#x27;ath ibn Qays, who was in Ali&#x27;s army, expressed his fears of Byzantine and Persian attacks were the Muslims to exhaust themselves in the civil war. Upon receiving intelligence of this, Mu&#x27;awiya ordered the raising of the Qur&#x27;an leaves. Though this act represented a surrender of sorts as Mu&#x27;awiya abandoned, at least temporarily, his previous insistence on settling the dispute with Ali militarily and pursuing Uthman&#x27;s killers into Iraq, it had the effect of sowing discord and uncertainty in Ali&#x27;s ranks.

The caliph adhered to the will of the majority in his army and accepted the proposal to arbitrate. Moreover, Ali agreed to Amr&#x27;s, or Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s, demand to omit his formal title, (commander of the faithful, the traditional title of a caliph), from the initial arbitration document. According to the historian Hugh N. Kennedy, the agreement forced Ali &quot;to deal with Mu&#x27;awiya on equal terms and abandon his unchallenged right to lead the community&quot;. Madelung asserts it &quot;handed Mu&#x27;awiya a moral victory&quot; before inducing a &quot;disastrous split in the ranks of Ali&#x27;s men&quot;. Indeed, upon Ali&#x27;s return to his capital Kufa in September 658, a large segment of his troops who had opposed the arbitration defected, inaugurating the Kharijite movement.

The initial agreement postponed the arbitration to a later date. Information in the early Muslim sources about the time, place and outcome of the arbitration is contradictory, but there were likely two meetings between Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s and Ali&#x27;s respective representatives, Amr and Abu Musa al-Ash&#x27;ari, the first in Dumat al-Jandal and the last in Adhruh. Ali abandoned the arbitration after the first meeting in which Abu Musa—who, unlike Amr, was not particularly attached to his principal&#x27;s cause— accepted the Syrian side&#x27;s claim that Uthman was wrongfully killed, a verdict that Ali opposed. The final meeting in Adhruh, which had been convened at Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s request, collapsed, but by then Mu&#x27;awiya had emerged as a major contender for the caliphate.

===Claim to the caliphate and resumption of hostilities===
Following the breakdown of the arbitration talks, Amr and the Syrian delegates returned to Damascus, where they greeted Mu&#x27;awiya as , signaling their recognition of him as caliph. In April or May 658, Mu&#x27;awiya received a general pledge of allegiance from the Syrians. In response, Ali broke off communications with Mu&#x27;awiya, mobilized for war and invoked a curse against Mu&#x27;awiya and his close retinue as a ritual in the morning prayers. Mu&#x27;awiya reciprocated in kind against Ali and his closest supporters in his own domain.

In July, Mu&#x27;awiya dispatched an army under Amr to Egypt after a request for intervention from pro-Uthman mutineers in the province who were being suppressed by the governor, Caliph Abu Bakr&#x27;s son and Ali&#x27;s stepson, Muhammad. The latter&#x27;s troops were defeated by Amr&#x27;s forces, the provincial capital Fustat was captured and Muhammad was executed on the orders of Mu&#x27;awiya ibn Hudayj, leader of the pro-Uthman rebels. The loss of Egypt was a major blow to the authority of Ali, who was bogged down battling Kharijite defectors in Iraq and whose grip in Basra and Iraq&#x27;s eastern and southern dependencies was eroding. Though his hand was strengthened, Mu&#x27;awiya refrained from launching a direct assault against Ali. Instead, his strategy was to bribe the tribal chieftains in Ali&#x27;s army to his side and harry the inhabitants along Iraq&#x27;s western frontier. The first raid was conducted by al-Dahhak ibn Qays al-Fihri against nomads and Muslim pilgrims in the desert west of Kufa. This was followed by Nu&#x27;man ibn Bashir al-Ansari&#x27;s abortive attack on Ayn al-Tamr then, in the summer of 660, Sufyan ibn Awf&#x27;s successful raids against Hit and Anbar.

In 659 or 660, Mu&#x27;awiya expanded the operations to the Hejaz (western Arabia, where Mecca and Medina are located), sending Abd Allah ibn Mas&#x27;ada al-Fazari to collect the alms tax and oaths of allegiance to Mu&#x27;awiya from the inhabitants of the Tayma oasis. This initial foray was defeated by the Kufans, while an attempt to extract oaths of allegiance from the Quraysh of Mecca in April 660 also failed.

In the summer, Mu&#x27;awiya dispatched a large army under Busr ibn Abi Artat to conquer the Hejaz and Yemen. He directed Busr to intimidate Medina&#x27;s inhabitants without harming them, spare the Meccans and kill anyone in Yemen who refused to pledge their allegiance. Busr advanced through Medina, Mecca and Ta&#x27;if, encountering no resistance and gaining those cities&#x27; recognition of Mu&#x27;awiya. In Yemen, Busr executed several notables in Najran and its vicinity on account of past criticism of Uthman or ties to Ali, massacred numerous tribesmen of the Hamdan and townspeople from Sana&#x27;a and Ma&#x27;rib. Before he could continue his campaign in Hadhramawt, he withdrew upon the approach of a Kufan relief force. News of Busr&#x27;s actions in Arabia spurred Ali&#x27;s troops to rally behind his planned campaign against Mu&#x27;awiya, but the expedition was aborted as a result of Ali&#x27;s assassination by a Kharijite in January 661.

==Caliphate==
===Accession===
After Ali was killed, Mu&#x27;awiya left al-Dahhak ibn Qays in charge of Syria and led his army toward Kufa, where Ali&#x27;s son Hasan had been nominated as his successor. He successfully bribed Ubayd Allah ibn Abbas, the commander of Hasan&#x27;s vanguard, to desert his post and sent envoys to negotiate with Hasan. In return for a financial settlement, Hasan abdicated and Mu&#x27;awiya entered Kufa in July or September 661 and was recognized as caliph. This year is considered by a number of the early Muslim sources as &#x27;the year of unity&#x27; and is generally regarded as the start of Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s caliphate.

Before and/or after Ali&#x27;s death, Mu&#x27;awiya received oaths of allegiance in one or two formal ceremonies in Jerusalem, the first in late 660 or early 661 and the second in July 661. The 10th-century Jerusalemite geographer al-Maqdisi holds that Mu&#x27;awiya had further developed a mosque originally built by Caliph Umar on the Temple Mount, the precursor of the Jami Al-Aqsa, and received his formal oaths of allegiance there. According to the earliest extant source about Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s accession in Jerusalem, the near-contemporaneous Maronite Chronicles, composed by an anonymous Syriac author, Mu&#x27;awiya received the pledges of the tribal chieftains and then prayed at Golgotha and the Tomb of the Virgin Mary in Gethsemane, both adjacent to the Temple Mount. The Maronite Chronicles also maintain that Mu&#x27;awiya &quot;did not wear a crown like other kings in the world&quot;.

===Domestic rule and administration===
There is little information in the early Muslim sources about Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s rule in Syria, the center of his caliphate. He established his court in Damascus and moved the caliphal treasury there from Kufa. He relied on his Syrian tribal soldiery, numbering about 100,000 men, increasing their pay at the expense of the Iraqi garrisons, also about 100,000 soldiers combined. The highest stipends were paid on an inheritable basis to 2,000 nobles of the Quda&#x27;a and Kinda tribes, the core components of his support base, who were further awarded the privilege of consultation for all major decisions and the rights to veto or propose measures. The respective leaders of the Quda&#x27;a and the Kinda, the Kalbite chief Ibn Bahdal and the Homs-based Shurahbil, formed part of his Syrian inner circle along with the Qurayshites Abd al-Rahman ibn Khalid, son of the distinguished commander Khalid ibn al-Walid, and al-Dahhak ibn Qays.

Mu&#x27;awiya is credited by the early Muslim sources for establishing (government departments) for correspondences (), chancellery () and the postal route (). According to al-Tabari, following an assassination attempt by the Kharijite al-Burak ibn Abd Allah on Mu&#x27;awiya while he was praying in the mosque of Damascus in 661, Mu&#x27;awiya established a caliphal (personal guard) and (select troops) and the (reserved area) within mosques. The caliph&#x27;s treasury was largely dependent on the tax revenues of Syria and income from the crown lands that he confiscated in Iraq and Arabia. He also received the customary fifth of the war booty acquired by his commanders during expeditions. In the Jazira, Mu&#x27;awiya coped with the tribal influx, which spanned previously established groups such as the Sulaym, newcomers from the Mudar and Rabi&#x27;a confederations and civil war refugees from Kufa and Basra, by administratively detaching the military district of Qinnasrin–Jazira from Homs, according to the 8th-century historian Sayf ibn Umar. However, al-Baladhuri attributes this change to Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s successor Yazid I ().

Syria retained its Byzantine-era bureaucracy, which was staffed by Christians including the head of the tax administration, Sarjun ibn Mansur. The latter had served Mu&#x27;awiya in the same capacity before his attainment of the caliphate, and Sarjun&#x27;s father was the likely holder of the office under Emperor Heraclius (). Mu&#x27;awiya was tolerant toward Syria&#x27;s native Christian majority. In turn, the community was generally satisfied with his rule, under which their conditions were at least as favorable as under the Byzantines. Mu&#x27;awiya attempted to mint his own coins, but the new currency was rejected by the Syrians as it omitted the symbol of the cross. The sole epigraphic attestation to Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s rule in Syria, a Greek inscription dated to 663 discovered at the hot springs of Hamat Gader near the Sea of Galilee, refers to the caliph as &quot;Abd Allah Mu&#x27;awiya, amir al-mu&#x27;minin&quot; (&quot;God&#x27;s Servant Mu&#x27;awiya, commander of the faithful&quot;; the caliph&#x27;s name is preceded by a cross) and credits him for restoring Roman-era bath facilities for the benefit of the sick. According to the historian Yizhar Hirschfeld, &quot;by this deed, the new caliph sought to please&quot; his Christian subjects. The caliph often spent his winters at his Sinnabra palace near the Sea of Galilee. Mu&#x27;awiya was also credited with ordering the restoration of Edessa&#x27;s church after it was ruined in an earthquake in 679. He demonstrated a keen interest in Jerusalem. Although archaeological evidence is lacking, there are indications in medieval literary sources that a rudimentary mosque on the Temple Mount existed as early as Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s time or was built by him.

===Governance in the provinces===
Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s primary internal challenge was overseeing a Syria-based government that could reunite the politically and socially fractured Caliphate and assert authority over the tribes which formed its armies. He applied indirect rule to the Caliphate&#x27;s provinces, appointing governors with full civil and military authority. Although in principle governors were obliged to forward surplus tax revenues to the caliph, in practice most of the surplus was distributed among the provincial garrisons and Damascus received a negligible share. During Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s caliphate, the governors relied on the (tribal chieftains), who served as intermediaries between the authorities and the tribesmen in the garrisons. Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s statecraft was likely inspired by his father, who utilized his wealth to establish political alliances. The caliph generally preferred bribing his opponents over direct confrontation. In the summation of Kennedy, Mu&#x27;awiya ruled by &quot;making agreements with those who held power in the provinces, by building up the power of those who were prepared to co-operate with him and by attaching as many important and influential figures to his cause as possible&quot;.

====Iraq and the east====
Challenges to central authority in general, and to Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s rule in particular, were most acute in Iraq, where divisions were rife between the upstarts and the nascent Muslim elite, the latter of which was further divided between Ali&#x27;s partisans and the Kharijites. Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s ascent signaled the rise of the Kufan represented by Ali&#x27;s erstwhile backers al-Ash&#x27;ath ibn Qays and Jarir ibn Abd Allah, at the expense of Ali&#x27;s old guard represented by Hujr ibn Adi and Ibrahim, the son of Ali&#x27;s leading aide Malik al-Ashtar. Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s initial choice to govern Kufa in 661 was al-Mughira ibn Shu&#x27;ba, who possessed considerable administrative and military experience in Iraq and was highly familiar with the region&#x27;s inhabitants and issues. Under his nearly decade-long administration, al-Mughira maintained peace in the city, overlooked transgressions that did not threaten his rule, allowed the Kufans to keep possession of the lucrative Sasanian crown lands in the Jibal district and, unlike under past administrations, consistently and timely paid the garrison&#x27;s stipends.

In Basra, Mu&#x27;awiya reappointed his Abd Shams kinsman Abd Allah ibn Amir, who had served in the office under Uthman. During Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s reign, Ibn Amir recommenced expeditions into Sistan, reaching as far as Kabul. He was unable to maintain order in Basra, where there was growing resentment toward the distant campaigns. Consequently, Mu&#x27;awiya replaced Ibn Amir with Ziyad ibn Abihi in 664 or 665. The latter had been the longest of Ali&#x27;s loyalists to withhold recognition of Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s caliphate and had barricaded himself in the Istakhr fortress in Fars. Busr had threatened to execute three of Ziyad&#x27;s young sons in Basra to force his surrender, but Ziyad was ultimately persuaded by al-Mughira, his mentor, to submit to Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s authority in 663. In a controversial step that secured the loyalty of the fatherless Ziyad, whom the caliph viewed as the most capable candidate to govern Basra, Mu&#x27;awiya adopted him as his paternal half-brother, to the protests of his own son Yazid, Ibn Amir and his Umayyad kinsmen in the Hejaz.

Following al-Mughira&#x27;s death in 670, Mu&#x27;awiya attached Kufa and its dependencies to Ziyad&#x27;s Basran governorship, making him the caliph&#x27;s virtual viceroy over the eastern half of the Caliphate. Ziyad tackled Iraq&#x27;s core economic problem of overpopulation in the garrison cities and the consequent scarcity of resources by reducing the number of troops on the payrolls and dispatching 50,000 Iraqi soldiers and their families to settle Khurasan. This also consolidated the previously weak and unstable Arab position in the Caliphate&#x27;s easternmost province and enabled conquests toward Transoxiana. As part of his reorganization efforts in Kufa, Ziyad confiscated its garrison&#x27;s crown lands, which thenceforth became the possession of the caliph. Opposition to the confiscations raised by Hujr ibn Adi, whose pro-Alid advocacy had been tolerated by al-Mughira, was violently suppressed by Ziyad. Hujr and his retinue were sent to Mu&#x27;awiya for punishment and were executed on the caliph&#x27;s orders, marking the first political execution in Islamic history and serving as a harbinger for future pro-Alid uprisings in Kufa. Ziyad died in 673 and his son Ubayd Allah was appointed gradually by Mu&#x27;awiya to all of his father&#x27;s former offices. In effect, by relying on al-Mughira and Ziyad and his sons, Mu&#x27;awiya franchised the administration of Iraq and the eastern Caliphate to members of the elite Thaqif clan, which had long-established ties to the Quraysh and were instrumental in the conquest of Iraq.

====Egypt====
In Egypt Amr governed more as a partner of Mu&#x27;awiya than a subordinate until his death in 664. He was permitted to retain the surplus revenues of the province. The caliph ordered the resumption of Egyptian grain and oil shipments to Medina, ending the hiatus caused by the First Fitna. After Amr&#x27;s death, Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s brother Utba () and an early companion of Muhammad, Uqba ibn Amir (), successively served as governors before Mu&#x27;awiya appointed Maslama ibn Mukhallad al-Ansari in 667. Maslama remained governor for the duration of Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s reign, significantly expanding Fustat and its mosque and boosting the city&#x27;s importance in 674 by relocating Egypt&#x27;s main shipyard to the nearby Roda Island from Alexandria due to the latter&#x27;s vulnerability to Byzantine naval raids.

The Arab presence in Egypt was mostly limited to the central garrison at Fustat and the smaller garrison at Alexandria. The influx of Syrian troops brought by Amr in 658 and the Basran troops sent by Ziyad in 673 swelled Fustat&#x27;s 15,000-strong garrison to 40,000 during Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s reign. Utba increased the Alexandria garrison to 12,000 men and built a governor&#x27;s residence in the city, whose Greek Christian population was generally hostile to Arab rule. When Utba&#x27;s deputy in Alexandria complained that his troops were unable to control the city, Mu&#x27;awiya deployed a further 15,000 soldiers from Syria and Medina. The troops in Egypt were far less rebellious than their Iraqi counterparts, though elements in the Fustat garrison occasionally raised opposition to Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s policies, culminating during Maslama&#x27;s term with the widespread protest at Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s seizure and allotment of crown lands in Fayyum to his son Yazid, which compelled the caliph to reverse his order.

====Arabia====
Although revenge for Uthman&#x27;s assassination had been the basis upon which Mu&#x27;awiya claimed the right to the caliphate, he neither emulated Uthman&#x27;s empowerment of the Umayyad clan nor used them to assert his own power. With minor exceptions, members of the clan were not appointed to the wealthy provinces nor the caliph&#x27;s court, Mu&#x27;awiya largely limiting their influence to Medina, the old capital of the Caliphate where most of the Umayyads and the wider Qurayshite former aristocracy remained headquartered. The loss of political power left the Umayyads of Medina resentful toward Mu&#x27;awiya, who may have become wary of the political ambitions of the much larger Abu al-As branch of the clan—to which Uthman had belonged—under the leadership of Marwan ibn al-Hakam. The caliph attempted to weaken the clan by provoking internal divisions. Among the measures taken was the replacement of Marwan from the governorship of Medina in 668 with another leading Umayyad, Sa&#x27;id ibn al-As. The latter was instructed to demolish Marwan&#x27;s house, but refused and when Marwan was restored in 674, he also refused Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s order to demolish Sa&#x27;id&#x27;s house. Mu&#x27;awiya dismissed Marwan once more in 678, replacing him with his own nephew, al-Walid ibn Utba. Besides his own clan, Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s relations with the Banu Hashim (the clan of Muhammad and Caliph Ali), the families of Muhammad&#x27;s closest companions, the once-prominent Banu Makhzum, and the Ansar was generally characterized by suspicion or outright hostility.

Despite his relocation to Damascus, Mu&#x27;awiya remained fond of his original homeland and made known his longing for &quot;the spring in Juddah &quot;[sic]&quot;, the summer in Ta&#x27;if, [and] the winter in Mecca&quot;. He purchased several large tracts throughout Arabia and invested considerable sums to develop the lands for agricultural use. According to the Muslim literary tradition, in the plain of Arafat and the barren valley of Mecca he dug numerous wells and canals, constructed dams and dikes to protect the soil from seasonal floods, and built fountains and reservoirs. His efforts saw extensive grain fields and date palm groves spring up across Mecca&#x27;s suburbs, which remained in this state until deteriorating during the Abbasid era, which began in 750. In the Yamama region in central Arabia, Mu&#x27;awiya confiscated from the Banu Hanifa the lands of Hadarim, where he employed 4,000 slaves, likely to cultivate its fields. The caliph gained possession of estates in and near Ta&#x27;if which, together with the lands of his brothers Anbasa and Utba, formed a considerable cluster of properties.

One of the earliest known Arabic inscriptions from Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s reign was found at a soil-conservation dam called Sayisad east of Ta&#x27;if, which credits Mu&#x27;awiya for the dam&#x27;s construction in 677 or 678 and asks God to give him victory and strength. Mu&#x27;awiya is also credited as the patron of a second dam called al-Khanaq east of Medina, according to an inscription found at the site. This is possibly the dam between Medina and the gold mines of the Banu Sulaym tribe attributed to Mu&#x27;awiya by the historians al-Harbi (d. 898) and al-Samhudi (d. 1533).

===War with Byzantium===

Mu&#x27;awiya possessed more personal experience than any other caliph fighting the Byzantines, the principal external threat to the Caliphate, and pursued the war against the Empire more energetically and continuously than his successors. The First Fitna caused the Arabs to lose control over Armenia to native, pro-Byzantine princes, but in 661 Habib ibn Maslama re-invaded the region. The following year, Armenia became a tributary of the Caliphate and Mu&#x27;awiya recognized the Armenian prince Grigor Mamikonian as its commander. Not long after the civil war, Mu&#x27;awiya broke the truce with Byzantium, and on a near-annual or bi-annual basis the caliph engaged his Syrian troops in raids across the mountainous Anatolian frontier, the buffer zone between the Empire and the Caliphate. At least until Abd al-Rahman ibn Khalid&#x27;s death in 666, Homs served as the principal marshaling point for the offensives, and afterward Antioch served this purpose as well. The bulk of the troops fighting on the Anatolian and Armenian fronts hailed from the tribal groups that arrived from Arabia during and after the conquest. During his caliphate, Mu&#x27;awiya continued his past efforts to resettle and fortify the Syrian port cities. Due to the reticence of Arab tribesmen to inhabit the coastlands, in 663 Mu&#x27;awiya moved Persian civilians and personnel that he had previously settled in the Syrian interior into Acre and Tyre, and transferred Asawira, elite Persian soldiers, from Kufa and Basra to the garrison at Antioch. A few years later, Mu&#x27;awiya settled Apamea with 5,000 Slavs who had defected from the Byzantines during one of his forces&#x27; Anatolian campaigns.

Based on the histories of al-Tabari (d. 923) and Agapius of Hierapolis (d. 941), the first raid of Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s caliphate occurred in 662 or 663, during which his forces inflicted a heavy defeat on a Byzantine army with numerous patricians slain. In the next year a raid led by Busr reached Constantinople and in 664 or 665, Abd al-Rahman ibn Khalid raided Koloneia in northeastern Anatolia. In the late 660s, Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s forces attacked Antioch of Pisidia or Antioch of Isauria. Following the death of Constans II in July 668, Mu&#x27;awiya oversaw an increasingly aggressive policy of naval warfare against the Byzantines. According to the early Muslim sources, raids against the Byzantines peaked between 668 and 669. In each of those years there occurred six ground campaigns and a major naval campaign, the first by an Egyptian and Medinese fleet and the second by an Egyptian and Syrian fleet. The culmination of the campaigns was an assault on Constantinople, but the chronologies of the Arabic, Syriac, and Byzantine sources are contradictory. The traditional view by modern historians is of a great series of naval-borne assaults against Constantinople in , based on the history of the Byzantine chronicler Theophanes the Confessor (d. 818).

However, the dating and the very historicity of this view has been challenged; the Oxford scholar James Howard-Johnston considers that no siege of Constantinople took place, and that the story was inspired by the actual siege a generation later. The historian Marek Jankowiak on the other hand, in a revisionist reconstruction of the events reliant on the Arabic and Syriac sources, asserts that the assault came earlier than what is reported by Theophanes, and that the multitude of campaigns that were reported during 668–669 represented the coordinated efforts by Mu&#x27;awiya to conquer the Byzantine capital. Al-Tabari reports that Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s son Yazid led a campaign against Constantinople in 669 and Ibn Abd al-Hakam reports that the Egyptian and Syrian navies joined the assault, led by Uqba ibn Amir and Fadala ibn Ubayd respectively. According to Jankowiak, Mu&#x27;awiya likely ordered the invasion during an opportunity presented by the rebellion of the Byzantine Armenian general Saborios, who formed a pact with the caliph, in spring 667. The caliph dispatched an army under Fadala, but before it could be joined by the Armenians, Saborios died. Mu&#x27;awiya then sent reinforcements led by Yazid who led the Arab army&#x27;s invasion in the summer. An Arab fleet reached the Sea of Marmara by autumn, while Yazid and Fadala, having raided Chalcedon through the winter, besieged Constantinople in spring 668, but due to famine and disease, lifted the siege in late June. The Arabs continued their campaigns in Constantinople&#x27;s vicinity before withdrawing to Syria most likely in late 669.

In 669, Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s navy raided as far as Sicily. The following year, the wide-scale fortification of Alexandria was completed. While the histories of al-Tabari and al-Baladhuri report that Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s forces captured Rhodes in 672–674 and colonized the island for seven years before withdrawing during the reign of Yazid I, the modern historian Clifford Edmund Bosworth casts doubt on these events and holds that the island was only raided by Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s lieutenant Junada ibn Abi Umayya al-Azdi in 679 or 680. Under Emperor Constantine IV (), the Byzantines began a counteroffensive against the Caliphate, first raiding Egypt in 672 or 673, while in winter 673, Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s admiral Abd Allah ibn Qays led a large fleet that raided Smyrna and the coasts of Cilicia and Lycia. The Byzantines landed a major victory against an Arab army and fleet led by Sufyan ibn Awf, possibly at Sillyon, in 673 or 674. The next year, Abd Allah ibn Qays and Fadala landed in Crete and in 675 or 676, a Byzantine fleet assaulted Maraclea, killing the governor of Homs.

In 677, 678 or 679, according to Theophanes, Mu&#x27;awiya sued for peace with Constantine IV, possibly as a result of the destruction of his fleet or the Byzantines&#x27; deployment of the Mardaites in the Syrian littoral during that time. A thirty-year treaty was concluded, obliging the Caliphate to pay an annual tribute of 3,000 gold coins, 50 horses and 30 slaves, and withdraw their troops from the forward bases they had occupied on the Byzantine coast. But other Byzantine and Islamic sources make no mention of this treaty. Although the Muslims did not achieve any permanent territorial gains in Anatolia during Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s career, the frequent raids provided Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s Syrian troops with war spoils and tribute, which helped ensure their continued allegiance, and sharpened their combat skills. Moreover, Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s prestige was boosted and the Byzantines were precluded from any concerted campaigns against Syria.

====Conquest of central North Africa====
Although the Arabs had not advanced beyond Cyrenaica since the 640s other than periodic raids, the expeditions against Byzantine North Africa were renewed during Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s reign. In 665 or 666 Ibn Hudayj led an army which raided Byzacena (southern district of Byzantine Africa) and Gabes and temporarily captured Bizerte before withdrawing to Egypt. The following year Mu&#x27;awiya dispatched Fadala and Ruwayfi ibn Thabit to raid the commercially valuable island of Djerba. Meanwhile, in 662 or 667, Uqba ibn Nafi, a Qurayshite commander who had played a key role in the Arabs&#x27; capture of Cyrenaica in 641, reasserted Muslim influence in the Fezzan region, capturing the Zawila oasis and the Garamantes capital of Germa. He may have raided as far south as Kawar in modern-day Niger.

The struggle over the succession of Constantine IV drew Byzantine focus away from the African front. In 670, Mu&#x27;awiya appointed Uqba as Egypt&#x27;s deputy governor over the North African lands under Arab control west of Egypt. At the head of a 10,000-strong force, Uqba commenced his expedition against the territories west of Cyrenaica. As he advanced, his army was joined by Islamized Luwata Berbers and their combined forces conquered Ghadamis, Gafsa and the Jarid. In the last region he established a permanent Arab garrison town called Kairouan, at a relatively safe distance from Carthage and the coastal areas, which had remained under Byzantine control, to serve as a base for further expeditions. It also aided Muslim conversion efforts among the Berber tribes that dominated the surrounding countryside.

Mu&#x27;awiya dismissed Uqba in 673, probably out of concern that he would form an independent power base in the lucrative regions that he had conquered. The new Arab province, Ifriqiya (modern-day Tunisia), remained subordinate to the governor of Egypt, who sent his (non-Arab, Muslim freedman) Abu al-Muhajir Dinar to replace Uqba, who was arrested and transferred to Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s custody in Damascus. Abu al-Muhajir continued the westward campaigns as far as Tlemcen and defeated the Awraba Berber chief Kasila, who subsequently embraced Islam and joined his forces. In 678, a treaty between the Arabs and the Byzantines ceded Byzacena to the Caliphate, while forcing the Arabs to withdraw from the northern parts of the province. After Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s death, his successor Yazid reappointed Uqba, Kasila defected and a Byzantine–Berber alliance ended Arab control over Ifriqiya, which was not reestablished until the reign of Caliph Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan ().

===Nomination of Yazid as successor===
In a move unprecedented in Islamic politics, Mu&#x27;awiya nominated his own son, Yazid, as his successor. The caliph likely held ambitions for his son&#x27;s succession over a considerable period. In 666, he allegedly had his governor in Homs, Abd al-Rahman ibn Khalid, poisoned to remove him as a potential rival to Yazid. The Syrian Arabs, with whom Abd al-Rahman ibn Khalid was popular, had viewed the governor as the caliph&#x27;s most suitable successor by dint of his military record and descent from Khalid ibn al-Walid.

It was not until the latter half of his reign that Mu&#x27;awiya publicly declared Yazid heir apparent, though the early Muslim sources offer divergent details about the timing and location of the events relating to the decision. The accounts of al-Mada&#x27;ini (752–843) and Ibn al-Athir (1160–1232) agree that al-Mughira was the first to suggest that Yazid be acknowledged as Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s successor and that Ziyad supported the nomination with the caveat that Yazid abandon impious activities which could arouse opposition from the Muslim polity. According to al-Tabari, Mu&#x27;awiya publicly announced his decision in 675 or 676 and demanded oaths of allegiance be given to Yazid. Ibn al-Athir alone relates that delegations from all the provinces were summoned to Damascus where Mu&#x27;awiya lectured them on his rights as ruler, their duties as subjects and Yazid&#x27;s worthy qualities, which was followed by the calls of al-Dahhak ibn Qays and other courtiers that Yazid be recognized as the caliph&#x27;s successor. The delegates lent their support, with the exception of the senior Basran nobleman al-Ahnaf ibn Qays, who was ultimately bribed into compliance. Al-Mas&#x27;udi (896–956) and al-Tabari do not mention provincial delegations other than a Basran embassy led by Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad in 678–679 or 679–680, respectively, which recognized Yazid.

According to Hinds, in addition to Yazid&#x27;s nobility, age and sound judgement, &quot;most important of all&quot; was his connection to the Kalb. The Kalb-led Quda&#x27;a confederation was the foundation of Sufyanid rule and Yazid&#x27;s succession signaled the continuation of this alliance. In nominating Yazid, the son of the Kalbite Maysun, Mu&#x27;awiya bypassed his older son Abd Allah from his Qurayshite wife Fakhita. Although support from the Kalb and the Quda&#x27;a was guaranteed, Mu&#x27;awiya exhorted Yazid to widen his tribal support base in Syria. As the Qaysites were the predominant element in the northern frontier armies, Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s appointment of Yazid to lead the war efforts with Byzantium may have served to foster Qaysite support for his nomination. Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s efforts to that end were not entirely successful as reflected in a line by a Qaysite poet: &quot;we will never pay allegiance to the son of a Kalbi woman [i.e. Yazid]&quot;.

In Medina, Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s distant kinsmen Marwan ibn al-Hakam, Sa&#x27;id ibn al-As and Ibn Amir accepted Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s succession order, albeit disapprovingly. Most opponents of Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s order in Iraq and among the Umayyads and Quraysh of the Hejaz were ultimately threatened or bribed into acceptance. The remaining principle opposition emanated from Husayn ibn Ali, Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr, Abd Allah ibn Umar and Abd al-Rahman ibn Abi Bakr, all prominent Medina-based sons of earlier caliphs or close companions of Muhammad. As they possessed the nearest claims to the caliphate, Mu&#x27;awiya was determined to obtain their recognition. According to the historian Awana ibn al-Hakam (d. 764), before his death, Mu&#x27;awiya ordered certain measures to be taken against them, entrusting these tasks to his loyalists al-Dahhak ibn Qays and Muslim ibn Uqba.

==Death==
Mu&#x27;awiya died from an illness in Damascus in Rajab 60 AH (April or May 680 CE), at around the age of 80. The medieval accounts vary regarding the specific date of his death, with Hisham ibn al-Kalbi (d. 819) placing it on 7 April, al-Waqidi on 21 April and al-Mada&#x27;ini on 29 April. Yazid, who was away from Damascus at the time of his father&#x27;s death, is held by Abu Mikhnaf (d. 774) to have succeeded him on 7 April, while the Nestorian chronicler Elias of Nisibis (d. 1046) says it occurred on 21 April. In his last testament, Mu&#x27;awiya told his family &quot;Fear God, Almighty and Great, for God, praise Him, protects whoever fears Him, and there is no protector for one who does not fear God&quot;. He was buried next to the Bab al-Saghir gate of the city and the funeral prayers were led by al-Dahhak ibn Qays, who mourned Mu&#x27;awiya as the &quot;stick of the Arabs and the blade of the Arabs, by means of whom God, Almighty and Great, cut off strife, whom He made sovereign over mankind, by means of whom he conquered countries, but now he has died&quot;.

Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s grave was a visitation site as late as the 10th century. Al-Mas&#x27;udi holds that a mausoleum was built over the grave and was open to visitors on Mondays and Thursdays. Ibn Taghribirdi asserts that Ahmad ibn Tulun, the autonomous 9th-century ruler of Egypt and Syria, erected a structure on the grave in 883 or 884 and employed members of the public to regularly recite the Qur&#x27;an and light candles around the tomb.

==Assessment and legacy==
Like Uthman, Mu&#x27;awiya adopted the title (&#x27;deputy of God&#x27;), instead of (&#x27;deputy of the messenger of God&#x27;), the title used by the other caliphs who preceded him. The title may have implied political as well as religious authority and divine sanctioning. He is reported by al-Baladhuri to have said &quot;The earth belongs to God and I am the deputy of God&quot;. Nevertheless, whatever the absolutist connotations the title may have had, Mu&#x27;awiya evidently did not impose this religious authority. Instead, he governed indirectly like a supra-tribal chief using alliances with provincial , his personal skills, persuasive power, and wit.

Apart from his war with Ali, he did not deploy his Syrian troops domestically, and often used monetary gifts as a tool to avoid conflict. In Julius Wellhausen&#x27;s assessment, Mu&#x27;awiya was an accomplished diplomat &quot;allowing matters to ripen of themselves, and only now and then assisting their progress&quot;. He further states that Mu&#x27;awiya had the ability to identify and employ the most talented men at his service and made even those whom he distrusted work for him.

In the view of the historian Patricia Crone, Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s successful rule was facilitated by the tribal composition of Syria. There, the Arabs who formed his support base were distributed throughout the countryside and were dominated by a single confederation, the Quda&#x27;a. This was in contrast to Iraq and Egypt, where the diverse tribal composition of the garrison towns meant that the government had no cohesive support base and had to create a delicate balance between the opposing tribal groups. As evidenced by the disintegration of Ali&#x27;s Iraqi alliance, maintaining this balance was untenable. In her view, Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s taking advantage of the tribal circumstances in Syria prevented the dissolution of the Caliphate in the civil war. In the words of the orientalist Martin Hinds, the success of Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s style of governance is &quot;attested by the fact that he managed to hold his kingdom together without ever having to resort to using his Syrian troops&quot;.

In the long-term, Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s system proved precarious and unviable. Reliance on personal relations meant his government was dependent on paying and pleasing its agents instead of commanding them. This created a &quot;system of indulgence&quot;, according to Crone. The governors became increasingly unaccountable and amassed personal wealth. The tribal balance on which he relied was insecure and a slight fluctuation would lead to factionalism and infighting. When Yazid became caliph, he continued his father&#x27;s model. Controversial as his nomination had been, he had to face the rebellions of Husayn and Ibn al-Zubayr. Although he was able to defeat them with the help of his governors and the Syrian army, the system fractured as soon as he died in November 683. The provincial defected to Ibn al-Zubayr, as did the Qaysite tribes, who had migrated to Syria during Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s reign and were opposed to the Quda&#x27;a confederation on whom Sufyanid power rested. Within a matter of months the authority of Yazid&#x27;s successor, Mu&#x27;awiya II, had become restricted to Damascus and its environs. Although the Umayyads, backed by the Quda&#x27;a, were able to reconquer the Caliphate after the decade-long second civil war, it was under the leadership of Marwan, founder of the new ruling Umayyad house, the Marwanids, and his son Abd al-Malik. Having realized the weakness of Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s model and lacking in his political skill, the Marwanids abandoned his system in favor of a more traditional form of governance where the caliph was the central authority. Nonetheless, the hereditary succession introduced by Mu&#x27;awiya became a permanent feature of many of the Muslim governments that followed.

Kennedy views the preservation of the Caliphate&#x27;s unity as Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s greatest achievement. Expressing a similar viewpoint, Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s biographer R. Stephen Humphreys states that although maintaining the integrity of the Caliphate would have been an achievement on its own, Mu&#x27;awiya was intent on vigorously continuing the conquests that had been initiated by Abu Bakr and Umar. By creating a formidable navy, he made the Caliphate the dominant force in the eastern Mediterranean and the Aegean. Control of northeastern Iran was secured and the Caliphate&#x27;s frontier was expanded in North Africa. Madelung deems Mu&#x27;awiya a corruptor of the caliphal office, under whom the precedence in Islam (), which was the determining factor in the choice of earlier caliphs, gave way to the might of the sword, the people became his subjects and he became the &quot;absolute lord over their life and death&quot;. He strangled the communal spirit of Islam and used the religion as a tool of &quot;social control, exploitation and military terrorization&quot;.

Mu&#x27;awiya was the first caliph whose name appeared on coins, inscriptions, or documents of the nascent Islamic empire. The inscriptions from his reign lacked any explicit reference to Islam or Muhammad and the only titles that appear are &#x27;servant of God&#x27; and &#x27;commander of the faithful&#x27;. This has led some modern historians to question Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s commitment to Islam. They have proposed that he adhered to a non-confessional or indeterminate form of monotheism, or may have been a Christian. Asserting that the earliest Muslims did not see their faith as different from other monotheistic faiths, these historians see the earlier Medina-based caliphs in the same vein, but no public proclamations from their period exist. On the other hand, the historian Robert Hoyland notes that Mu&#x27;awiya gave a very Islamic challenge to the Byzantine emperor Constans to &quot;deny [the divinity of] Jesus and turn to the Great God whom I worship, the God of our father Abraham&quot; and speculates that Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s tour of Christian sites in Jerusalem was done to demonstrate &quot;the fact that he, and not the Byzantine emperor, was now God&#x27;s representative on earth&quot;.

===Early historical tradition===
The surviving Muslim histories originated in Abbasid-era Iraq. The compilers, the narrators from whom the stories were collected, and the overall public sentiment in Iraq were hostile to the Syria-based Umayyads, under whom Syria was a privileged province and Iraq was locally perceived as a Syrian colony. Moreover, the Abbasids, having overthrown the Umayyads in 750, saw them as illegitimate rulers and further tarnished their memory to enhance their own legitimacy. Abbasid caliphs like al-Saffah, al-Ma&#x27;mun, and al-Mu&#x27;tadid publicly condemned Mu&#x27;awiya and other Umayyad caliphs. As such, the Muslim historical tradition is by and large anti-Umayyad. Nonetheless, in the case of Mu&#x27;awiya it portrays him in a relatively balanced manner.

On the one hand, it portrays him as a successful ruler who implemented his will with persuasion instead of force. It stresses his quality of , which in his case meant mildness, slowness to anger, subtlety, and management of people by perceiving their needs and desires. The historical tradition is rife with anecdotes of his political acumen and self-control. In one such anecdote, when inquired about allowing one of his courtiers to address him with arrogance, he remarked:
The tradition presents him operating in the way of a traditional tribal sheikh who lacks absolute authority; summoning delegations () of tribal chiefs, and persuading them with flattery, arguments, and presents. This is exemplified in a saying attributed to him: &quot;I never use my voice if I can use my money, never my whip if I can use my voice, never my sword if I can use my whip; but, if I have to use my sword, I will.&quot;

On the other hand, the tradition also portrays him as a despot who perverted the caliphate into kingship. In the words of al-Ya&#x27;qubi (d. 898):
Al-Baladhuri calls him the &#x27;Khosrow of the Arabs&#x27; (). &#x27;Khosrow&#x27; was used by the Arabs as a reference to Sasanian Persian monarchs in general, who the Arabs associated with worldly splendor and authoritarianism, as opposed to the humility of Muhammad. Mu&#x27;awiya was compared to these monarchs mainly because he appointed his son Yazid as the next caliph, which was viewed as a violation of the Islamic principle of and an introduction of dynastic rule on par with the Byzantines and Sasanians. The civil war that erupted after Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s death is asserted to have been the direct consequence of Yazid&#x27;s nomination. In the Islamic tradition, Mu&#x27;awiya and the Umayyads are given the title of (king) instead of (caliph), though the succeeding Abbasids are recognized as caliphs.

The contemporary non-Muslim sources generally present a benign image of Mu&#x27;awiya. The Greek historian Theophanes calls him a , &#x27;first among equals&#x27;. According to Kennedy, the Nestorian Christian chronicler John bar Penkaye writing in the 690s &quot;has nothing but praise for the first Umayyad caliph ... of whose reign he says &#x27;the peace throughout the world was such that we have never heard, either from our fathers or from our grandparents, or seen that there had ever been any like it&#x27;&quot;.

===Muslim view===
In contrast to the four earlier caliphs, who are considered as models of piety and having governed with justice, Mu&#x27;awiya is not recognized as a rightly-guided caliph () by the Sunnis. He is seen as transforming the caliphate into a worldly and despotic kingship. His acquisition of the caliphate through the civil war and his institution of the hereditary succession by appointing his son Yazid as heir apparent are the principal charges made against him. Although Uthman and Ali had been highly controversial during the early period, religious scholars in the 8th and 9th centuries compromised in order to appease and absorb the Uthmanid and pro-Alid factions. Uthman and Ali were thus regarded along with the first two caliphs as divinely guided, whereas Mu&#x27;awiya and those who came after him were viewed as oppressive tyrants. Nevertheless, the Sunnis accord him the status of a companion of Muhammad and consider him a scribe of the Qur&#x27;anic revelation (). On these accounts, he is also respected. Some Sunnis defend his war against Ali holding that although he was in error, he acted according to his best judgment and had no evil intentions.

Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s war with Ali, whom the Shia hold as the true successor of Muhammad, has made him a reviled figure in Shia Islam. According to the Shia, based on this alone Mu&#x27;awiya qualifies as an unbeliever, if he was a believer to begin with. In addition, he is held responsible for the killing of a number of Muhammad&#x27;s companions at Siffin, having ordered the cursing of Ali from the pulpit, appointing Yazid as his successor, who went on to kill Husayn at Karbala, executing the pro-Alid Kufan nobleman Hujr ibn Adi, and assassinating Hasan by poisoning. As such, he has been a particular target of Shia traditions. Some traditions hold him to have been born of an illegitimate relationship between Abu Sufyan&#x27;s wife Hind and Muhammad&#x27;s uncle Abbas. His conversion to Islam is held to be devoid of any conviction and to have been motivated by convenience after Muhammad conquered Mecca. On this basis he is given the title of (freed slave of Muhammad). A number of hadiths are ascribed to Muhammad condemning Mu&#x27;awiya and his father Abu Sufyan in which he is called &quot;an accursed man () son of an accursed man&quot; and prophesying that he will die as an unbeliever. Unlike the Sunnis, the Shia deny him the status of a companion and also refute the Sunni claims that he was a scribe of the Qur&#x27;anic revelation. Like other opponents of Ali, Mu&#x27;awiya is cursed in a ritual called , which is held by many Shia to be an obligation.

Amid rising religious sectarianism among Muslims in the 10th century, while the Abbasid Caliphate was dominated by the Twelver Shia emirs of the Buyid dynasty, the figure of Mu&#x27;awiya became a propaganda tool used by the Shia and the Sunnis opposed to them. Strong pro-Mu&#x27;awiya sentiments were voiced by Sunnis in several Abbasid cities, including Baghdad, Wasit, Raqqa and Isfahan. At about the same time, the Shia were permitted by the Buyids and the Sunni Abbasid caliphs to perform the ritual cursing of Mu&#x27;awiya in mosques. In 10th–11th-century Egypt, the figure of Mu&#x27;awiya occasionally played a similar role, with the Isma&#x27;ili Shia Fatimid caliphs introducing measures opposed to Mu&#x27;awiya&#x27;s memory and opponents of the government using him as a tool to berate the Shia.

<text>Pasiphae , formerly spelled Pasiphaë, is a retrograde irregular satellite of Jupiter. It was discovered in 1908 by Philibert Jacques Melotte and later named after the mythological Pasiphaë, wife of Minos and mother of the Minotaur from Greek legend.

The moon was first spotted on a plate taken at the Royal Greenwich Observatory on the night of 28 February 1908. Inspection of previous plates found it as far back as January 27. It received the provisional designation , as it was not clear whether it was an asteroid or a moon of Jupiter. The recognition of the latter case came by April 10.

Pasiphae did not receive its present name until 1975; before then, it was simply known as . It was sometimes called &quot;Poseidon&quot; between 1955 and 1975.

==Orbit==

Pasiphae orbits Jupiter on a high eccentricity and high inclination retrograde orbit. It gives its name to the Pasiphae group, irregular retrograde moons orbiting Jupiter at distances ranging between 22.8 and 24.1 million km, and with inclinations ranging between 144.5° and 158.3°. The orbital elements are as of January 2000. They are continuously changing due to solar and planetary perturbations. The diagram illustrates its orbit in relation to other retrograde irregular satellites of Jupiter. The eccentricity of selected orbits is represented by the yellow segments (extending from the pericentre to the apocentre). The outermost regular satellite Callisto is located for reference.

Pasiphae is also known to be in a secular resonance with Jupiter (tying the longitude of its perijove with the longitude of perihelion of Jupiter).

==Physical characteristics==

With a diameter estimated at 58 km, Pasiphae is the largest retrograde and third largest irregular satellite after Himalia and Elara.

Spectroscopical measurements in infrared indicate that Pasiphae is a spectrally featureless object, consistent with the suspected asteroidal origin of the object. Pasiphae is believed to be a fragment from a captured asteroid along with other Pasiphae group satellites.
The satellite appears pale red (colour indices V=17.22 B-V=0.74, R-V=0.38) though it falls into the grey color-class of C-type asteroids.

<doc id="207072" wikidata="Q5325308" url="?curid=207072" title="Eagle-class patrol craft">
<text>The Eagle-class patrol craft were anti-submarine vessels of the United States Navy that were built during World War I using mass production techniques. They were steel-hulled ships smaller than contemporary destroyers but having a greater operational radius than the wooden-hulled, submarine chasers developed in 1917. The submarine chasers&#x27; range of about at a cruising speed of restricted their operations to off-shore anti-submarine work and denied them an open-ocean escort capability; their high consumption of gasoline and limited fuel storage were handicaps the Eagle class sought to remedy.

They were originally commissioned USS &quot;Eagle Boat No.1&quot; (or 2,3..etc.) but this was changed to PE-1 (or 2,4.. etc.) in 1920. They never officially saw combat in World War I, but some were used during the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War. PE-19, 27, 32, 38, 48 and 55–57 survived to be used in World War II.

Attention turned to building steel patrol vessels. In their construction, it was necessary to eliminate the established shipbuilding facilities as possible sources of construction as they were totally engaged in the building of destroyers, larger warships, and merchant shipping. Accordingly, a design was developed by the Bureau of Construction and Repair which was sufficiently simplified to permit speedy construction by less experienced shipyards.

== Involvement of Ford Motor Company==
In June 1917, President Woodrow Wilson had summoned auto-builder Henry Ford to Washington in the hope of getting him to serve on the United States Shipping Board. Wilson felt that Ford, with his knowledge of mass production techniques, could immensely speed the building of ships in quantity. Apprised of the need for anti-submarine vessels to combat the U-boat menace, Ford replied, &quot;what we want is one type of ship in large numbers.&quot;

On 7 November, Ford accepted membership on the Shipping Board and an active advisory role. Examining the Navy&#x27;s plans for the projected steel patrol ships, Ford urged that all hull plates be flat so that they could be produced quickly in quantity and he also persuaded the Navy to accept steam turbines instead of reciprocating steam engines.

At this point, Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels was drawn into the project. He recognized that no facilities were available at the Navy yards for building new craft and asked Ford if he would undertake the task. Ford agreed, and, in January 1918, he was directed to proceed with the building of 100 of them. Later on, 12 more were added for delivery to the Italian government.

The first boat was launched on 11 July 1918. According to Ford, &quot;They were built simply by applying our production principles to a new product.&quot;

==Construction==
Ford&#x27;s plan for building the ships was revolutionary. Establishing a new plant on the River Rouge on the outskirts of Detroit, he proposed to turn them out as factory products, using mass production techniques, and employing factory workers. He would then send the boats by the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River to the Atlantic coast. However, Ford had little part in the design of the boats. Except for his insistence upon simple plans and the use of steam turbines, he contributed little of a fundamental nature to the design concept.

First, Ford engineers built a full-scale pattern at the company&#x27;s Highland Park facility, giving both the Ford team and the Naval officers an opportunity to correct flaws in the rough initial design and decide on the placement of all rivet holes in the craft, as well as allowing the carmaker&#x27;s production experts the chance to compose specifications for the manufacturing and assembly processes.

The assembly plant was completed in five months, and the first keel was laid in May 1918. The machinery and fittings were largely built at Ford&#x27;s Highland Park plant in Detroit, although the new River Rouge plant, given impetus by the war, saw a good deal of the steel sheets and other parts formed and fabricated there in the A-Building, or fabricating building. At first, Ford believed that boats could be sent down a continuously moving assembly line like automobiles. The size of the craft made this too difficult, however, and a &quot;step-by-step&quot; movement was instituted on the line, entailing seven separate assembly areas, followed by the addition of a 200-foot (61 m) extension to the assembly facility, or B-Building, to support a pre-assembly stage. Unfortunately, the Eagles suffered from various issues due to Ford&#x27;s institutional inexperience with shipbuilding: for instance, the Model T did not use electric arc welding, and the resulting workmanship on the Eagle boats was so poor that the superintending constructor requested that Ford workers do as little welding as possible on water-tight and oil-tight bulkheads. Additionally, the use of ladders instead of scaffolds caused major difficulties—the attempted bolting of plates, carried out by workers wielding short-handled wrenches on ladders meant that the bolters were unable to apply sufficient force to bring the plates together tightly. Metal shavings between plates then made the riveters&#x27; task of pulling the plates together for a seal practically impossible.

The first Eagle boat was launched on 11 July. The launching of these craft was a formidable operation. Not built on slipways from which they could slide into the water, the hulls moved slowly from the assembly line on enormous, tractor-drawn flatcars. They were then placed on a steel trestle alongside the water&#x27;s edge which could be sunk into the water by hydraulic action. The plan was to fit the Eagles out with all the basic equipment of a warship—turbines, weaponry, wiring, etc.--after launch, but this quickly became a choke point due to the cramped spaces on the boats themselves, and violated Ford&#x27;s own mass production ethos.

The original expectation, set out in a contract between Ford and the Navy on 1 March 1918, was for delivery of 100 ships: &quot;one by mid-July, ten by mid-August, twenty by mid-September, and twenty-five each month thereafter,&quot; or approximately one new Eagle boat completed each working day of the month. The first seven boats were not completed until the end of 1918, and succeeding boats were plagued by issues such as leaky fuel oil compartments. This state of affairs continued, even though the labor force reached 4,380 by July and later peaked at 8,000. The chief reasons were Ford&#x27;s excessive initial optimism and the inexperience of labor and supervisory personnel in shipbuilding. Upon the signing of the Armistice in November 1918, the number under contract, previously raised from 100 to 112, was cut to 60. Of these, seven were commissioned in 1918, and the remaining 53 were commissioned in 1919.

The entire Eagle Boat operation came briefly under challenge by Senator Henry Cabot Lodge of Massachusetts in December 1918. At the ensuing Congressional hearings, Navy officials successfully defended the boats as being a necessary experiment and well made while Ford profits were proved to be modest. However, historian David Hounshell states that &quot;the Eagle boat venture cannot be considered successful by the standards of the war era or the present,&quot; and today serves as a case study in the history of technology to illustrate the difficulty in transferring knowledge and techniques between superficially similar, but fundamentally different, fields of endeavor.
==U.S. service==
The term &quot;Eagle Boat&quot; stemmed from a wartime editorial in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; which called for &quot;...an eagle to scour the seas and pounce upon and destroy every German submarine.&quot; However, the Eagle Boats never saw service in World War I.

Reports on their performance at sea were mixed. The introduction, at Ford&#x27;s insistence, of flanged plates instead of rolled plates facilitated production but resulted in sea-keeping characteristics which were far from ideal.

In the first years after the war, a number of them were used as aircraft tenders. Despite the handicap of their size, they serviced photographic reconnaissance planes at Midway in 1920 and in the Hawaiian Islands in 1921 before being supplanted by larger ships. Eagle boat 34, as related in Max Miller&#x27;s 1932 book &quot;I Cover The Waterfront&quot;, shared the yearly duty alternately with the Navy tug of capturing elephant seals on Mexico&#x27;s Guadalupe Island for the San Diego Zoo.

Five of the Eagle Boats were transferred to the United States Coast Guard in 1919 but proved unsuitable for service because poor maneuvering characteristics and sea-keeping qualities. The balance were sold in the 1930s and early 1940s.

Eight Eagle boats saw service during World War II. One was stationed in Miami as a training vessel., while one, &quot;Eagle 56&quot;, was sunk by a German submarine near Portland, Maine in April 1945. After the war, the seven remaining Eagle Boats were decommissioned.

== Ships ==

PE-61 through PE-112 were canceled on 30 November 1918.
PE-5, PE-15, PE-25, PE-45, PE-65, PE-75, PE-86, PE-95, PE-105, and PE-112 were allotted for transfer to Italy, though this plan was cancelled and none were ever delivered.

<text>Sir William Mulock (19 January 1843 – 1 October 1944) was a Canadian lawyer, businessman, educator, farmer, politician, judge, and philanthropist. He served as vice-chancellor of the University of Toronto from 1881 to 1900, negotiating the federation of denominational colleges and professional schools into a modern university.

He was elected to the House of Commons of Canada as a Liberal Member of Parliament and served from 1882 to 1905. Sir Wilfrid Laurier appointed him to the Canadian Cabinet as Postmaster General from 1896 to 1905. In 1900, Mulock established the Department of Labour, bringing William Lyon Mackenzie King into public life as his Deputy Minister.

He initiated the final agreement for a transpacific cable linking Canada to Australia and New Zealand, and he funded Marconi to establish the first transatlantic radio link from North America to Europe. In 1905, he chaired the parliamentary inquiry into telephones that led to regulation of Canadian telecommunications, and he participated in the negotiations that led to the creation of the provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan.

He was Chief Justice of the Exchequer Division of the Supreme Court of Ontario from 1905 until appointed by King in 1923 as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Ontario, a position he held until 1936. From 1931 to 1932, he served as the acting Lieutenant Governor of Ontario.

Mulock was extremely active in both business and the community, being involved in the foundation of organizations as diverse as the Toronto-Dominion Bank, the Toronto Star, Toronto Wellesley Hospital, and Canada&#x27;s first national peace organization. In later life, he was known as the &quot;Grand Old Man&quot; of Canada.

==Early life==
Mulock was born in Bond Head, Canada West, the son of Irish immigrant Thomas Homan Mulock and Mary, the daughter of John Cawthra. His father, a physician educated in Dublin at the Royal College of Surgeons and the Medical School of Trinity College, died when Mulock was 4 years old. His mother then moved the family to Newmarket, Ontario, where he was educated at the Newmarket Grammar School.

Mulock&#x27;s older brother, John, died in 1852; he had two sisters, Marian and Rosamund (later married to George W. Monk). The family endured genteel poverty after the father&#x27;s death, so Mulock spent much time chopping wood, milking the family cow, growing vegetables in the family garden, and on outside work such as repairing the local corduroy roads.

==University of Toronto==

===Student===

Mulock entered the new University College in Toronto in 1859; his classmates included J.M. Gibson, W.D. Lesueur, and W.B. McMurrich. On 9 November 1861, Mulock captained one of the teams in the first gridiron football game ever recorded.
During the Trent Affair of 1862, Mulock asked the head of the college, John McCaul, to call a student meeting that led to the formation of the University Company of volunteers, later K Company of the Queen&#x27;s Own Rifles. At the time of the Fenian Raids in 1866, Mulock received training at the Royal Military School and served in the regiment for three weeks, but he never saw action.
Starting at the same time that Mulock arrived, Egerton Ryerson led a sustained attack on the University over money and the proper purpose of a university education. Ryerson did not think that modern languages or history, practical courses, nor even law or medicine belonged in a university, and a Royal Commission was struck which recommended that the endowment of the University be distributed among all Ontario colleges. The defence of the university culminated in a large meeting at the St. Lawrence Hall on 5 March 1863, where Mulock moved the concluding motion. These efforts allowed the University to &quot;escape extinction&quot;, according to Sir Daniel Wilson.

After graduating in 1863 with the Gold Medal for Modern Languages, Mulock became a law student, first articled to Alfred Boultbee in Newmarket, and then in Toronto, eventually in the firm of Senator John Ross. To support himself, Mulock became a house-master at Upper Canada College. Mulock was called to the bar in 1868.

===University Senator (1873–1944)===
After graduating, Mulock, Edward Blake, Thomas Moss, and James Loudon led the struggle to broaden the University of Toronto Senate to include elected members. As a result, Ontario Minister of Education Adam Crooks passed legislation in 1873 that added 15 new senators elected by the alumni. Mulock was elected and remained a member for 71 years. Mulock moved and passed the first requirement that University finances be reported to the senate and made public. Largely due to the efforts of Mulock and Loudon, in 1876 a School of Science was established and in 1878 an independent School of Practical Science (which joined the university in 1889 as the Faculty of Applied Science and Engineering).

In 1873, the Law Society of Upper Canada established a law school, and Mulock soon became Lecturer and Examiner in Equity. After the school closed in 1878, the Osgoode Literary and Legal Society attempted to provide replacement instruction, with Mulock lecturing on partnership. When Mulock became Vice-Chancellor, one of his goals was to establish the best law faculty on the continent.

===Vice-Chancellor (1881–1900)===

Mulock was elected Vice-Chancellor in 1881. The University of Toronto then consisted of two small buildings, and the rest of higher education in Ontario was distributed among a variety of denominational colleges and small independent professional schools. Mulock believed that a single federated university would be more efficient, less expensive, and provide better educational opportunities to students, especially in sciences and the professions. He negotiated around resistance from many quarters, leading to the Federation Act in 1887 and affiliation (and later federation) with St. Michael&#x27;s College in 1881, Wycliffe College and Knox College in 1885, the Ontario College of Agriculture and the Royal College of Dental Surgeons in 1888, Victoria College, the Ontario Medical College for Women and the Toronto College of Music in 1890, the College of Pharmacy in 1891, the Toronto Conservatory of Music in 1896, and the Ontario Veterinary College in 1897. In opposition to followers of John Rolph who believed medical education should be paid for by students since they would soon have a good income treating patients, Mulock thought it better to reduce disease by spending public money to train doctors. The Federation Act established new faculties of medicine and law. Mulock efforts were not popular with everyone, but he survived several attempts to remove him from office, resigning in 1900 because of his increased political responsibilities. As part of his internecine battles, Mulock secretly aided William Lyon Mackenzie King and other student leaders of the February 1895 student strike.

In June 1893, Mulock provided the articling position needed by pioneering student-at-law Clara Brett Martin. Martin was so badly treated by her fellow male students that she eventually switched to another firm, but in 1897 she became the first female lawyer in the British Empire.

In 1897, Mulock hired surgeon Herbert Bruce into the Faculty of Medicine without consultation. Mulock later helped finance Bruce&#x27;s new Wellesley Hospital and was the first chair of its board of directors.

The University awarded Mulock an Honorary Doctorate of Laws in 1894.
While Vice-Chancellor, Mulock accepted no salary, and the money accumulated was donated to the university.

In 1906, the elected office of Vice-Chancellor was abolished; the unelected President of the University took over as Chair of the Senate. Mulock later spoke out against this &quot;reactionary step&quot;, especially since the act also &quot;put the elected members of the senate in a hopeless minority&quot; and reduced the senate&#x27;s responsibilities to academic matters only.
===Chancellor (1924–1944)===
After Sir William Meredith&#x27;s death in 1923, Mulock was nominated for the primarily ceremonial role of Chancellor. Mulock was supported by most elected representatives, but opposed by most professors. The senate elected Sir Edmund Walker, but Walker died shortly thereafter. Mulock was subsequently elected unanimously as Chancellor on 28 April 1924 and served until his death.

Mulock&#x27;s proudest achievements were his contributions to the University of Toronto. His memorials at the university include the Mulock Cup, Canada&#x27;s oldest continuously awarded sporting trophy, the William Mulock Prize in Mathematics and Physics, the William Mulock Prize in Classics, and Mulock House in Whitney Hall residence.

==Politics and law==
Mulock entered politics in 1881, unsuccessfully seeking the Liberal nomination in the then strongly Conservative federal riding of York North. The winning nominee, Dr. John Widderfield, later withdrew and was replaced by Mulock, who then unexpectedly defeated the Conservative incumbent in the 1882 election. Mulock remained in Opposition through two subsequent elections until 1896 when the Liberals under Wilfrid Laurier took power. In order to provide &quot;clean government&quot;, Mulock raised sufficient funds that year to provide Laurier with financial independence.

===Postmaster General (1896–1905)===
Laurier appointed Mulock as Postmaster General.
He inherited an inefficient bureaucracy that was losing almost a million dollars a year, but he believed that improved service and lower prices would increase revenue and better connect Canada and the British Empire. He campaigned for lower rates throughout the Empire, and when met by resistance decided to go it alone, announcing that at the end of 1897 Canada would unilaterally lower the letter rate to Britain from five to three cents. In response, a conference of all British Empire postal authorities was called for the summer of 1898. Over the objections of the Australian colonies and New Zealand, Mulock succeeded in implementing an Imperial Penny Post. Mulock also took advantage of this meeting to negotiate the final financial agreement for the transpacific cable first proposed by Sir Sandford Fleming to link Canada to Australia and New Zealand. The cable was completed on 31 October 1902, finishing the All Red Line. By 1903, the Post Office was generating a surplus of almost a million dollars a year.

To mark the start of the Imperial Penny Post, Mulock personally designed and issued a new stamp with a map of the world showing the extent of the British Empire. Partly by accident, this became the world&#x27;s first Christmas stamp.

On 1 April 1898, Mulock introduced an amendment to the Post Office Act that made Canada the first country in the world to give franking privileges, i.e. free postage, for Braille materials and books for the blind. He also initiated a program to provide Post Office employment for the deaf.

After the first successful transatlantic radio communication in 1901 to his station at Signal Hill, Newfoundland, Guglielmo Marconi learned that the Anglo-American Cable Company had a monopoly on transatlantic telegraphy from Newfoundland, so he planned to move to a new location in the United States. When Mulock learned this, he immediately negotiated an agreement with Marconi for him to set up his North American radio station in Glace Bay, Nova Scotia, where the first transatlantic message from North America was sent on 17 December 1902.

Mulock was Canada&#x27;s representative at the opening of Australia&#x27;s first Parliament in 1901, and was one of Canadian representatives at the coronation of King Edward VII. Mulock was knighted in 1902 for his services, in particular for the Penny Post, Transpacific Cable, and wireless telegraphy between Canada and Great Britain.

In order to protect the public against quackery Mulock amended the Post Office Act in 1904 to curtail advertising of &quot;marvellous, extravagant or grossly improbable cures&quot;. Mulock was also active in the negotiations that led to the formation of the provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan in 1905.
In 1905, Mulock chaired the select parliamentary inquiry into telephone systems, especially the unregulated Bell Telephone monopoly.
The committee shed much light on the operations and finances of Bell, but Mulock was replaced when it became apparent that he was likely to recommend the telephone service be a government owned utility. The committee&#x27;s work nevertheless led in 1906 to the first federal regulation of telephone and telegram service by the Board of Railway Commissioners, the ancestor of the current Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission. Despite being a wealthy businessman and fervent anticommunist, Mulock believed that government operation of public franchises provided better service at lower cost, with greater protection of personal privacy and public interest.

Mulock was probably the best administrator in the Laurier Cabinet, but he did not always consider the political consequences of his actions. Without consulting Laurier, he fired the influential journalist Arthur Dansereau as Montreal&#x27;s Postmaster. Mulock had ample cause, but Laurier immediately ordered Dansereau reinstated, straining Laurier&#x27;s relationship with Mulock.

Mulock once let politics try to overrule physics. He proposed the Newmarket Canal to the centre of his riding to help local industry, despite engineering reports that that natural water flow would leave the canal dry for much of the year. &quot;Mulock&#x27;s Madness&quot; was cancelled when Robert Borden became Prime Minister in 1911, but its partially completed remains are still prominent.

===Minister of Labour (1900–1905)===
While Postmaster-General, Mulock learned from Mackenzie King that Post Office uniforms were being produced in sweatshops. He immediately revised Post Office contracting policy so that all uniforms would be produced under Government approved conditions. In 1900, Mulock introduced &quot;The Fair Wages Resolution&quot; governing all Canadian government contracting, and an act that created the Department of Labour and the &quot;Labour Gazette&quot; (one of the ancestors of Statistics Canada). Mulock became Canada&#x27;s first Minister of Labour in addition to his Post Office responsibilities. In response to an urgent telegram from Mulock, Mackenzie King turned down a better paid academic position at Harvard to become Editor of the &quot;Labour Gazette&quot; and subsequently the first Deputy Minister of Labour. King eventually became Canada&#x27;s longest serving Prime Minister, and remained friends with Mulock for the rest of his life. In 1903 Mulock introduced compulsory arbitration to Canada through the Railway Disputes Act.

Mulock retired from politics in 1905 due to rheumatism and neuritis exacerbated by overwork, but the movement of his political views to the left may also have contributed to his decision.

===Chief Justice===
Mulock was appointed Chief Justice of the Exchequer (1905–1923) and subsequently Chief Justice of Ontario (1923–1936). He served until age 93, probably a record for a Canadian court; lawyers referred to Mulock and his elderly colleagues as &quot;murderers&#x27; row&quot;. As Chief Justice of Ontario, Mulock participated in many widely publicized cases, such as quashing the rape conviction from Louis-Mathias Auger&#x27;s first trial in 1929.

On 28 February 1930, a Ku Klux Klan mob invaded the home of a mixed race couple in Oakville, Ontario. Several men were eventually convicted, but given only a small fine. On appeal, Mulock described the fine as a &quot;travesty of justice&quot;, and replaced it with a three-month prison term. Mulock reported himself as an ardent abolitionist in his youth, and as a politician he actively campaigned in black communities, but in his ruling Mulock denounced only mob law, not the underlying racial issues. This ruling marked the start of a significant decline in Klan activity in Canada.

In 1931, Tim Buck and seven other members of the Communist Party of Canada were convicted of seditious conspiracy and membership in an unlawful organization. The strongly anticommunist Mulock presided over the appeal of the convictions in 1932, and despite dismissing the conspiracy charge, upheld the other convictions and his lengthy written decision established the Communist Party as an unlawful organization, effectively banning it.

By modern standards, Mulock&#x27;s judgements were not always free of apparent bias or conflicts of interest. In the long and very public case of &quot;Campbell v Hogg&quot;, he was close to all participants, and Elizabeth Campbell was so unhappy with his court&#x27;s judgement that to overturn it she became the first woman to argue a case before the Privy Council.

==Business and community==
===Farming===
In 1880, Mulock purchased a large property on what is now the northwest corner of Mulock Drive and Yonge Street in Newmarket. On almost 400 acres Mulock established a manorial estate and model farm, known for its flowers, black walnut grove, apple orchard, and prize shorthorn cattle and Shetland ponies. In political life, Mulock was often referred to as &quot;Farmer Bill&quot;. The farm was used to try out new methods and crops, and provided agricultural and leadership training for many students from the Ontario College of Agriculture. In 1926, Mulock purchased a second farm in Markdale, Ontario for trout fishing and reforestation.

===Banking and commerce===
Mulock&#x27;s (and later his son&#x27;s) firm represented many commercial interests, including Consumers Gas (Enbridge), the American Bank Note Company, and Sun Life. He was President of the Victoria Rolling Stock Company and the Farmers&#x27; Loan and Savings Co., and had real estate interests. In 1911, Mulock, Sir Henry Pellatt, and Charles Millar took control of O&#x27;Keefe Brewing, a brand now owned by Molson Coors Brewing Company.

Mulock was one of the founders of The Dominion Bank,
which opened for business in 1871 and in 1955 merged with the Bank of Toronto to form the Toronto-Dominion Bank, currently Canada&#x27;s second largest bank. He was also one of the founders (1882) and Directors of Toronto General Trusts, Canada&#x27;s first trust company and an ancestor of TD Canada Trust.

In 1899, as chief Liberal Party organizer in Ontario, Mulock wanted a Liberal paper to counterbalance the Conservative &quot;Toronto Telegram&quot;. He led a group that purchased the ailing &quot;Toronto Star&quot; and offered Joseph Atkinson the position as editor. Atkinson accepted on the condition that he have editorial independence and that part of his pay would be in shares. Mulock unhappily agreed, and Mulock and Atkinson clashed for the rest of their lives. It gave Atkinson great pleasure at the 1913 annual shareholders&#x27; meeting to interrupt Mulock in mid-tirade to announce that he was now the majority shareholder and would do what he chose.

===Community and philanthropy===
Throughout his life, Mulock&#x27;s strong interest in &quot;plain people (and) public practical problems&quot; involved him in leadership in innumerable community organizations. These included the CNIB, the Federation for Community Service (an ancestor of the United Way), St. John Ambulance, the Working Boys Home, and the Soldiers Rehabilitation Fund.
Cardinal McQuigan credited Mulock with helping Catholics fully participate in the civic life of Ontario.
In 1925, Mulock was the leading organizer of the Banting Research Foundation, Canada&#x27;s first medical research foundation.

Despite playing a key role in forcing Laurier to commit Canadian forces in the Boer War, after his retirement from politics, Mulock spoke out against militarism. Mulock became the first president of Canada&#x27;s first national, secular peace organization, the Canadian Peace and Arbitration Society, founded in 1905 by Charles Ambrose Zavitz. When Britain entered World War I, Mulock immediately started organizing the Toronto and York County Patriotic Fund (later part of the Canadian Patriotic Fund) to assist soldier&#x27;s families. Mulock was President of the Toronto and York Fund for its entire existence (and chair of the Canadian executive); the Toronto fund raised $8,939,143, with only about 2% spent on expenses. At age 99 during World War II, he served as Chair of the Canadian Committee of the International YMCA, responsible for supervising enemy prisoners in Canada. He considered information from Canadian prison camp officials to be hearsay that could not replace direct inspection.

==Personal life and character==

William Mulock married in May 1870 Sarah Ellen Crowther, daughter of James Crowther. She was born and educated in Toronto. The couple lived at 518 Jarvis Street in Toronto. The couple had six children (William, Edith, Sarah, Ethel, James, Cawthra).
Mulock&#x27;s grandson William Pate Mulock was also an MP for York North.

Mulock&#x27;s use of profanity was said to be the most picturesque in parliament, and he was known for his consumption of Cuban cigars and rye whisky. Just before Prohibition came into force in Ontario in 1916, he had special concrete compartments built in his house into which he stored a lifetime supply of whisky.

Mulock was described as &quot;The man who did&quot;, his work ethic recognized even by those who sometimes disagreed with what he did. Sir Daniel Wilson referred to him as &quot;the mule&quot;. At a luncheon in his honour shortly after his 87th birthday, Mulock described his attitude on growing old:
Mulock is buried in Newmarket Cemetery. Named is his honour in Ontario are:
*Sir William Mulock Secondary School and Mulock Drive (York Regional Road 74) in the town of Newmarket;
*Mulock Drive in his birthplace, the town of Bond Head;
*the dispersed rural communities of Mulock in Grey County and Mulock in Nipissing District, and geographic Mulock Township in Nipissing District;
*Mulock Island in the North Channel, Lake Huron, in Algoma District;
*Mulock Creek, a tributary of the Barron River (Ontario), in Nipissing District; and
*Little Mulock Lake in Nipissing District.

In probability theory and statistics, the beta distribution is a family of continuous probability distributions defined on the interval [0, 1] or (0, 1) in terms of two positive parameters, denoted by &quot;alpha&quot; (&quot;α&quot;) and &quot;beta&quot; (&quot;β&quot;), that appear as exponents of the variable and its complement to 1, respectively, and control the shape of the distribution.

The beta distribution has been applied to model the behavior of random variables limited to intervals of finite length in a wide variety of disciplines. The beta distribution is a suitable model for the random behavior of percentages and proportions.

In Bayesian inference, the beta distribution is the conjugate prior probability distribution for the Bernoulli, binomial, negative binomial, and geometric distributions.

The formulation of the beta distribution discussed here is also known as the beta distribution of the first kind, whereas &quot;beta distribution of the second kind&quot; is an alternative name for the beta prime distribution. The generalization to multiple variables is called a Dirichlet distribution.

==Definitions==

===Probability density function===

The probability density function (PDF) of the beta distribution, for formula_20 or formula_21, and shape parameters formula_22, formula_23, is a power function of the variable formula_24 and of its reflection formula_25 as follows:

: formula_26

where formula_27 is the gamma function. The beta function, formula_28, is a normalization constant to ensure that the total probability is 1. In the above equations formula_24 is a realization—an observed value that actually occurred—of a random variable formula_30.

Several authors, including N. L. Johnson and S. Kotz, use the symbols formula_31 and formula_32 (instead of formula_22 and formula_34) for the shape parameters of the beta distribution, reminiscent of the symbols traditionally used for the parameters of the Bernoulli distribution, because the beta distribution approaches the Bernoulli distribution in the limit when both shape parameters formula_22 and formula_34 approach the value of zero.

In the following, a random variable formula_30 beta-distributed with parameters formula_22 and formula_34 will be denoted by:

:formula_40

Other notations for beta-distributed random variables used in the statistical literature are formula_41 and formula_42.

===Cumulative distribution function===

The cumulative distribution function is

:formula_43

where formula_44 is the incomplete beta function and formula_45 is the regularized incomplete beta function.

For positive integer formula_22, formula_47, the cumulative distribution function of a beta distribution can be expressed in terms of the cumulative distribution function of a binomial distribution with

:formula_48.

===Alternative parameterizations===

====Two parameters====

=====Mean and sample size=====
The beta distribution may also be reparameterized in terms of its mean &quot;μ&quot; and the sum of the two shape parameters ( p. 83). Denoting by αPosterior and βPosterior the shape parameters of the posterior beta distribution resulting from applying Bayes theorem to a binomial likelihood function and a prior probability, the interpretation of the addition of both shape parameters to be sample size = &quot;ν&quot; = &quot;α&quot;·Posterior + &quot;β&quot;·Posterior is only correct for the Haldane prior probability Beta(0,0). Specifically, for the Bayes (uniform) prior Beta(1,1) the correct interpretation would be sample size = &quot;α&quot;·Posterior + &quot;β&quot; Posterior − 2, or &quot;ν&quot; = (sample size) + 2. For sample size much larger than 2, the difference between these two priors becomes negligible. (See section Bayesian inference for further details.) &quot;ν&quot; = &quot;α&quot; + &quot;β&quot; is referred to as the &quot;sample size&quot; of a beta distribution, but one should remember that it is, strictly speaking, the &quot;sample size&quot; of a binomial likelihood function only when using a Haldane Beta(0,0) prior in Bayes theorem.

This parametrization may be useful in Bayesian parameter estimation. For example, one may administer a test to a number of individuals. If it is assumed that each person&#x27;s score (0 ≤ &quot;θ&quot; ≤ 1) is drawn from a population-level beta distribution, then an important statistic is the mean of this population-level distribution. The mean and sample size parameters are related to the shape parameters &quot;α&quot; and &quot;β&quot; via

: &quot;α&quot; = &quot;μν&quot;, &quot;β&quot; = (1 − &quot;μ&quot;)&quot;ν&quot;

Under this parametrization, one may place an uninformative prior probability over the mean, and a vague prior probability (such as an exponential or gamma distribution) over the positive reals for the sample size, if they are independent, and prior data and/or beliefs justify it.

=====Mode and concentration=====
Concave beta distributions, which have formula_49, can be parametrized in terms of mode and &quot;concentration&quot;. The mode, formula_50, and concentration, formula_51, can be used to define the usual shape parameters as follows:
:formula_52
For the mode, formula_53, to be well-defined, we need formula_49, or equivalently formula_55. If instead we define the concentration as formula_56, the condition simplifies to formula_57 and the beta density at formula_58 and formula_59 can be written as:
:formula_60
where formula_61 directly scales the sufficient statistics, formula_62 and formula_63. Note also that in the limit, formula_64, the distribution becomes flat.

=====Mean and variance=====

Solving the system of (coupled) equations given in the above sections as the equations for the mean and the variance of the beta distribution in terms of the original parameters &quot;α&quot; and &quot;β&quot;, one can express the &quot;α&quot; and &quot;β&quot; parameters in terms of the mean (&quot;μ&quot;) and the variance (var):

:formula_65

This parametrization of the beta distribution may lead to a more intuitive understanding than the one based on the original parameters &quot;α&quot; and &quot;β&quot;. For example, by expressing the mode, skewness, excess kurtosis and differential entropy in terms of the mean and the variance:




====Four parameters====
A beta distribution with the two shape parameters &quot;α&quot; and &quot;β&quot; is supported on the range [0,1] or (0,1). It is possible to alter the location and scale of the distribution by introducing two further parameters representing the minimum, &quot;a&quot;, and maximum &quot;c&quot; (&quot;c&quot; &gt; &quot;a&quot;), values of the distribution, by a linear transformation substituting the non-dimensional variable &quot;x&quot; in terms of the new variable &quot;y&quot; (with support [&quot;a&quot;,&quot;c&quot;] or (&quot;a&quot;,&quot;c&quot;)) and the parameters &quot;a&quot; and &quot;c&quot;:

:formula_66

The probability density function of the four parameter beta distribution is equal to the two parameter distribution, scaled by the range (&quot;c&quot; − &quot;a&quot;), (so that the total area under the density curve equals a probability of one), and with the &quot;y&quot; variable shifted and scaled as follows:
::formula_67

That a random variable &quot;Y&quot; is beta-distributed with four parameters &quot;α&quot;, &quot;β&quot;, &quot;a&quot;, and &quot;c&quot; will be denoted by:

:formula_68

Some measures of central location are scaled (by (&quot;c&quot; − &quot;a&quot;)) and shifted (by &quot;a&quot;), as follows:

:formula_69

Note: the geometric mean and harmonic mean cannot be transformed by a linear transformation in the way that the mean, median and mode can.

The shape parameters of &quot;Y&quot; can be written in term of its mean and variance as

:formula_70

The statistical dispersion measures are scaled (they do not need to be shifted because they are already centered on the mean) by the range (&quot;c&quot; − &quot;a&quot;), linearly for the mean deviation and nonlinearly for the variance:

::formula_71
::formula_72
::formula_73

Since the skewness and excess kurtosis are non-dimensional quantities (as moments centered on the mean and normalized by the standard deviation), they are independent of the parameters &quot;a&quot; and &quot;c&quot;, and therefore equal to the expressions given above in terms of &quot;X&quot; (with support [0,1] or (0,1)):

::formula_74

::formula_75

==Properties==

===Measures of central tendency===

====Mode====
The mode of a beta distributed random variable &quot;X&quot; with &quot;α&quot;, &quot;β&quot; &gt; 1 is the most likely value of the distribution (corresponding to the peak in the PDF), and is given by the following expression:

:formula_76

When both parameters are less than one (&quot;α&quot;, &quot;β&quot; &lt; 1), this is the anti-mode: the lowest point of the probability density curve.

Letting &quot;α&quot; = &quot;β&quot;, the expression for the mode simplifies to 1/2, showing that for &quot;α&quot; = &quot;β&quot; &gt; 1 the mode (resp. anti-mode when ), is at the center of the distribution: it is symmetric in those cases. See Shapes section in this article for a full list of mode cases, for arbitrary values of &quot;α&quot; and &quot;β&quot;. For several of these cases, the maximum value of the density function occurs at one or both ends. In some cases the (maximum) value of the density function occurring at the end is finite. For example, in the case of &quot;α&quot; = 2, &quot;β&quot; = 1 (or &quot;α&quot; = 1, &quot;β&quot; = 2), the density function becomes a right-triangle distribution which is finite at both ends. In several other cases there is a singularity at one end, where the value of the density function approaches infinity. For example, in the case &quot;α&quot; = &quot;β&quot; = 1/2, the beta distribution simplifies to become the arcsine distribution. There is debate among mathematicians about some of these cases and whether the ends (&quot;x&quot; = 0, and &quot;x&quot; = 1) can be called &quot;modes&quot; or not.
* Whether the ends are part of the domain of the density function
* Whether a singularity can ever be called a &quot;mode&quot;
* Whether cases with two maxima should be called &quot;bimodal&quot;

====Median====

The median of the beta distribution is the unique real number formula_77 for which the regularized incomplete beta function formula_78. There is no general closed-form expression for the median of the beta distribution for arbitrary values of &quot;α&quot; and &quot;β&quot;. Closed-form expressions for particular values of the parameters &quot;α&quot; and &quot;β&quot; follow:

* For symmetric cases &quot;α&quot; = &quot;β&quot;, median = 1/2.
* For &quot;α&quot; = 1 and &quot;β&quot; &gt; 0, median formula_79 (this case is the mirror-image of the power function [0,1] distribution)
* For &quot;α&quot; &gt; 0 and &quot;β&quot; = 1, median = formula_80 (this case is the power function [0,1] distribution)
* For &quot;α&quot; = 3 and &quot;β&quot; = 2, median = 0.6142724318676105..., the real solution to the quartic equation 1 − 8&quot;x&quot;3 + 6&quot;x&quot;4 = 0, which lies in [0,1].
* For &quot;α&quot; = 2 and &quot;β&quot; = 3, median = 0.38572756813238945... = 1−median(Beta(3, 2))

The following are the limits with one parameter finite (non-zero) and the other approaching these limits:

:formula_81

A reasonable approximation of the value of the median of the beta distribution, for both α and β greater or equal to one, is given by the formula

:formula_82

When &quot;α&quot;, &quot;β&quot; ≥ 1, the relative error (the absolute error divided by the median) in this approximation is less than 4% and for both &quot;α&quot; ≥ 2 and &quot;β&quot; ≥ 2 it is less than 1%. The absolute error divided by the difference between the mean and the mode is similarly small:

====Mean====

The expected value (mean) (&quot;μ&quot;) of a beta distribution random variable &quot;X&quot; with two parameters &quot;α&quot; and &quot;β&quot; is a function of only the ratio &quot;β&quot;/&quot;α&quot; of these parameters:

:formula_83

Letting in the above expression one obtains , showing that for the mean is at the center of the distribution: it is symmetric. Also, the following limits can be obtained from the above expression:

:formula_84

Therefore, for &quot;β&quot;/&quot;α&quot; → 0, or for &quot;α&quot;/&quot;β&quot; → ∞, the mean is located at the right end, . For these limit ratios, the beta distribution becomes a one-point degenerate distribution with a Dirac delta function spike at the right end, , with probability 1, and zero probability everywhere else. There is 100% probability (absolute certainty) concentrated at the right end, .

Similarly, for &quot;β&quot;/&quot;α&quot; → ∞, or for &quot;α&quot;/&quot;β&quot; → 0, the mean is located at the left end, . The beta distribution becomes a 1-point Degenerate distribution with a Dirac delta function spike at the left end, &quot;x&quot; = 0, with probability 1, and zero probability everywhere else. There is 100% probability (absolute certainty) concentrated at the left end, &quot;x&quot; = 0. Following are the limits with one parameter finite (non-zero) and the other approaching these limits:

:formula_85

While for typical unimodal distributions (with centrally located modes, inflexion points at both sides of the mode, and longer tails) (with Beta(&quot;α&quot;, &quot;β&quot;) such that ) it is known that the sample mean (as an estimate of location) is not as robust as the sample median, the opposite is the case for uniform or &quot;U-shaped&quot; bimodal distributions (with Beta(&quot;α&quot;, &quot;β&quot;) such that ), with the modes located at the ends of the distribution. As Mosteller and Tukey remark ( p. 207) &quot;the average of the two extreme observations uses all the sample information. This illustrates how, for short-tailed distributions, the extreme observations should get more weight.&quot; By contrast, it follows that the median of &quot;U-shaped&quot; bimodal distributions with modes at the edge of the distribution (with Beta(&quot;α&quot;, &quot;β&quot;) such that ) is not robust, as the sample median drops the extreme sample observations from consideration. A practical application of this occurs for example for random walks, since the probability for the time of the last visit to the origin in a random walk is distributed as the arcsine distribution Beta(1/2, 1/2): the mean of a number of realizations of a random walk is a much more robust estimator than the median (which is an inappropriate sample measure estimate in this case).

====Geometric mean====


The logarithm of the geometric mean &quot;GX&quot; of a distribution with random variable &quot;X&quot; is the arithmetic mean of ln(&quot;X&quot;), or, equivalently, its expected value:

:formula_86

For a beta distribution, the expected value integral gives:

:formula_87

where &quot;ψ&quot; is the digamma function.

Therefore, the geometric mean of a beta distribution with shape parameters &quot;α&quot; and &quot;β&quot; is the exponential of the digamma functions of &quot;α&quot; and &quot;β&quot; as follows:

:formula_88

While for a beta distribution with equal shape parameters &quot;α&quot; = &quot;β&quot;, it follows that skewness = 0 and mode = mean = median = 1/2, the geometric mean is less than 1/2: . The reason for this is that the logarithmic transformation strongly weights the values of &quot;X&quot; close to zero, as ln(&quot;X&quot;) strongly tends towards negative infinity as &quot;X&quot; approaches zero, while ln(&quot;X&quot;) flattens towards zero as .

Along a line , the following limits apply:

:formula_89

Following are the limits with one parameter finite (non-zero) and the other approaching these limits:

:formula_90

The accompanying plot shows the difference between the mean and the geometric mean for shape parameters &quot;α&quot; and &quot;β&quot; from zero to 2. Besides the fact that the difference between them approaches zero as &quot;α&quot; and &quot;β&quot; approach infinity and that the difference becomes large for values of &quot;α&quot; and &quot;β&quot; approaching zero, one can observe an evident asymmetry of the geometric mean with respect to the shape parameters &quot;α&quot; and &quot;β&quot;. The difference between the geometric mean and the mean is larger for small values of &quot;α&quot; in relation to &quot;β&quot; than when exchanging the magnitudes of &quot;β&quot; and &quot;α&quot;.

N. L.Johnson and S. Kotz suggest the logarithmic approximation to the digamma function &quot;ψ&quot;(&quot;α&quot;) ≈ ln(&quot;α&quot; − 1/2) which results in the following approximation to the geometric mean:

:formula_91

Numerical values for the relative error in this approximation follow: []; []; []; []; []; []; []; [].

Similarly, one can calculate the value of shape parameters required for the geometric mean to equal 1/2. Given the value of the parameter &quot;β&quot;, what would be the value of the other parameter, &quot;α&quot;, required for the geometric mean to equal 1/2?. The answer is that (for ), the value of &quot;α&quot; required tends towards as . For example, all these couples have the same geometric mean of 1/2: [], [], [], [], [], [], [].

The fundamental property of the geometric mean, which can be proven to be false for any other mean, is

:formula_92

This makes the geometric mean the only correct mean when averaging &quot;normalized&quot; results, that is results that are presented as ratios to reference values. This is relevant because the beta distribution is a suitable model for the random behavior of percentages and it is particularly suitable to the statistical modelling of proportions. The geometric mean plays a central role in maximum likelihood estimation, see section &quot;Parameter estimation, maximum likelihood.&quot; Actually, when performing maximum likelihood estimation, besides the geometric mean &quot;GX&quot; based on the random variable X, also another geometric mean appears naturally: the geometric mean based on the linear transformation ––, the mirror-image of &quot;X&quot;, denoted by &quot;G&quot;(1−&quot;X&quot;):

:formula_93

Along a line , the following limits apply:

:formula_94

Following are the limits with one parameter finite (non-zero) and the other approaching these limits:

:formula_95

It has the following approximate value:

:formula_96

Although both &quot;G&quot;&quot;X&quot; and &quot;G&quot;(1−&quot;X&quot;) are asymmetric, in the case that both shape parameters are equal , the geometric means are equal: &quot;G&quot;&quot;X&quot; = &quot;G&quot;(1−&quot;X&quot;). This equality follows from the following symmetry displayed between both geometric means:

:formula_97

====Harmonic mean====

The inverse of the harmonic mean (&quot;HX&quot;) of a distribution with random variable &quot;X&quot; is the arithmetic mean of 1/&quot;X&quot;, or, equivalently, its expected value. Therefore, the harmonic mean (&quot;HX&quot;) of a beta distribution with shape parameters &quot;α&quot; and &quot;β&quot; is:

:formula_98

The harmonic mean (&quot;HX&quot;) of a beta distribution with &quot;α&quot; &lt; 1 is undefined, because its defining expression is not bounded in [0, 1] for shape parameter &quot;α&quot; less than unity.

Letting &quot;α&quot; = &quot;β&quot; in the above expression one obtains

:formula_99

showing that for &quot;α&quot; = &quot;β&quot; the harmonic mean ranges from 0, for &quot;α&quot; = &quot;β&quot; = 1, to 1/2, for &quot;α&quot; = &quot;β&quot; → ∞.

Following are the limits with one parameter finite (non-zero) and the other approaching these limits:

:formula_100

The harmonic mean plays a role in maximum likelihood estimation for the four parameter case, in addition to the geometric mean. Actually, when performing maximum likelihood estimation for the four parameter case, besides the harmonic mean &quot;HX&quot; based on the random variable &quot;X&quot;, also another harmonic mean appears naturally: the harmonic mean based on the linear transformation (1 − &quot;X&quot;), the mirror-image of &quot;X&quot;, denoted by &quot;H&quot;1 − &quot;X&quot;:

:formula_101

The harmonic mean (&quot;H&quot;(1 − &quot;X&quot;)) of a beta distribution with &quot;β&quot; &lt; 1 is undefined, because its defining expression is not bounded in [0, 1] for shape parameter &quot;β&quot; less than unity.

Letting &quot;α&quot; = &quot;β&quot; in the above expression one obtains

:formula_102

showing that for &quot;α&quot; = &quot;β&quot; the harmonic mean ranges from 0, for &quot;α&quot; = &quot;β&quot; = 1, to 1/2, for &quot;α&quot; = &quot;β&quot; → ∞.

Following are the limits with one parameter finite (non-zero) and the other approaching these limits:

:formula_103

Although both &quot;H&quot;&quot;X&quot; and &quot;H&quot;1−&quot;X&quot; are asymmetric, in the case that both shape parameters are equal &quot;α&quot; = &quot;β&quot;, the harmonic means are equal: &quot;H&quot;&quot;X&quot; = &quot;H&quot;1−&quot;X&quot;. This equality follows from the following symmetry displayed between both harmonic means:

:formula_104

===Measures of statistical dispersion===

====Variance====
The variance (the second moment centered on the mean) of a beta distribution random variable &quot;X&quot; with parameters &quot;α&quot; and &quot;β&quot; is:

:formula_105

Letting &quot;α&quot; = &quot;β&quot; in the above expression one obtains

:formula_106

showing that for &quot;α&quot; = &quot;β&quot; the variance decreases monotonically as increases. Setting in this expression, one finds the maximum variance var(&quot;X&quot;) = 1/4 which only occurs approaching the limit, at .

The beta distribution may also be parametrized in terms of its mean &quot;μ&quot; and sample size () (see subsection Mean and sample size):

:formula_107

Using this parametrization, one can express the variance in terms of the mean &quot;μ&quot; and the sample size &quot;ν&quot; as follows:

:formula_108

Since , it follows that .

For a symmetric distribution, the mean is at the middle of the distribution, , and therefore:

:formula_109

Also, the following limits (with only the noted variable approaching the limit) can be obtained from the above expressions:

:formula_110

====Geometric variance and covariance====

The logarithm of the geometric variance, ln(var&quot;GX&quot;), of a distribution with random variable &quot;X&quot; is the second moment of the logarithm of &quot;X&quot; centered on the geometric mean of &quot;X&quot;, ln(&quot;GX&quot;):

:formula_111

and therefore, the geometric variance is:

:formula_112

In the Fisher information matrix, and the curvature of the log likelihood function, the logarithm of the geometric variance of the reflected variable 1 − &quot;X&quot; and the logarithm of the geometric covariance between &quot;X&quot; and 1 − &quot;X&quot; appear:

:formula_113

For a beta distribution, higher order logarithmic moments can be derived by using the representation of a beta distribution as a proportion of two gamma distributions and differentiating through the integral. They can be expressed in terms of higher order poly-gamma functions. See the section . The variance of the logarithmic variables and covariance of ln &quot;X&quot; and ln(1−&quot;X&quot;) are:

: formula_114
: formula_115
: formula_116

where the trigamma function, denoted &quot;ψ&quot;1(&quot;α&quot;), is the second of the polygamma functions, and is defined as the derivative of the digamma function:

:formula_117

Therefore,

:formula_118
:formula_119
:formula_120

The accompanying plots show the log geometric variances and log geometric covariance versus the shape parameters &quot;α&quot; and &quot;β&quot;. The plots show that the log geometric variances and log geometric covariance are close to zero for shape parameters &quot;α&quot; and &quot;β&quot; greater than 2, and that the log geometric variances rapidly rise in value for shape parameter values &quot;α&quot; and &quot;β&quot; less than unity. The log geometric variances are positive for all values of the shape parameters. The log geometric covariance is negative for all values of the shape parameters, and it reaches large negative values for &quot;α&quot; and &quot;β&quot; less than unity.

Following are the limits with one parameter finite (non-zero) and the other approaching these limits:

:formula_121

Limits with two parameters varying:

:formula_122

Although both ln(var&quot;GX&quot;) and ln(var&quot;G&quot;(1 − &quot;X&quot;)) are asymmetric, when the shape parameters are equal, α = β, one has: ln(var&quot;GX&quot;) = ln(var&quot;G(1−X)&quot;). This equality follows from the following symmetry displayed between both log geometric variances:

:formula_123

The log geometric covariance is symmetric:

:formula_124

====Mean absolute deviation around the mean====
The mean absolute deviation around the mean for the beta distribution with shape parameters &quot;α&quot; and &quot;β&quot; is:

:formula_125

The mean absolute deviation around the mean is a more robust estimator of statistical dispersion than the standard deviation for beta distributions with tails and inflection points at each side of the mode, Beta(&quot;α&quot;, &quot;β&quot;) distributions with &quot;α&quot;,&quot;β&quot; &gt; 2, as it depends on the linear (absolute) deviations rather than the square deviations from the mean. Therefore, the effect of very large deviations from the mean are not as overly weighted.

Using Stirling&#x27;s approximation to the Gamma function, N.L.Johnson and S.Kotz derived the following approximation for values of the shape parameters greater than unity (the relative error for this approximation is only −3.5% for &quot;α&quot; = &quot;β&quot; = 1, and it decreases to zero as &quot;α&quot; → ∞, &quot;β&quot; → ∞):

:formula_126

At the limit &quot;α&quot; → ∞, &quot;β&quot; → ∞, the ratio of the mean absolute deviation to the standard deviation (for the beta distribution) becomes equal to the ratio of the same measures for the normal distribution: formula_127. For &quot;α&quot; = &quot;β&quot; = 1 this ratio equals formula_128, so that from &quot;α&quot; = &quot;β&quot; = 1 to &quot;α&quot;, &quot;β&quot; → ∞ the ratio decreases by 8.5%. For &quot;α&quot; = &quot;β&quot; = 0 the standard deviation is exactly equal to the mean absolute deviation around the mean. Therefore, this ratio decreases by 15% from &quot;α&quot; = &quot;β&quot; = 0 to &quot;α&quot; = &quot;β&quot; = 1, and by 25% from &quot;α&quot; = &quot;β&quot; = 0 to &quot;α&quot;, &quot;β&quot; → ∞ . However, for skewed beta distributions such that &quot;α&quot; → 0 or &quot;β&quot; → 0, the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean absolute deviation approaches infinity (although each of them, individually, approaches zero) because the mean absolute deviation approaches zero faster than the standard deviation.

Using the parametrization in terms of mean &quot;μ&quot; and sample size &quot;ν&quot; = &quot;α&quot; + &quot;β&quot; &gt; 0:

:&quot;α&quot; = &quot;μν&quot;, &quot;β&quot; = (1 − &quot;μ&quot;)&quot;ν&quot;

one can express the mean absolute deviation around the mean in terms of the mean &quot;μ&quot; and the sample size &quot;ν&quot; as follows:

:formula_129

For a symmetric distribution, the mean is at the middle of the distribution, &quot;μ&quot; = 1/2, and therefore:

:formula_130

Also, the following limits (with only the noted variable approaching the limit) can be obtained from the above expressions:

:formula_131

====Mean absolute difference====

The mean absolute difference for the beta distribution is:

:formula_132

The Gini coefficient for the beta distribution is half of the relative mean absolute difference:

:formula_133

===Skewness===
The skewness (the third moment centered on the mean, normalized by the 3/2 power of the variance) of the beta distribution is

:formula_134

Letting &quot;α&quot; = &quot;β&quot; in the above expression one obtains &quot;γ&quot;1 = 0, showing once again that for &quot;α&quot; = &quot;β&quot; the distribution is symmetric and hence the skewness is zero. Positive skew (right-tailed) for &quot;α&quot; &lt; &quot;β&quot;, negative skew (left-tailed) for &quot;α&quot; &gt; &quot;β&quot;.

Using the parametrization in terms of mean &quot;μ&quot; and sample size &quot;ν&quot; = &quot;α&quot; + &quot;β&quot;:

:formula_135

one can express the skewness in terms of the mean &quot;μ&quot; and the sample size ν as follows:

:formula_136

The skewness can also be expressed just in terms of the variance &quot;var&quot; and the mean &quot;μ&quot; as follows:

:formula_137

The accompanying plot of skewness as a function of variance and mean shows that maximum variance (1/4) is coupled with zero skewness and the symmetry condition (&quot;μ&quot; = 1/2), and that maximum skewness (positive or negative infinity) occurs when the mean is located at one end or the other, so that the &quot;mass&quot; of the probability distribution is concentrated at the ends (minimum variance).

The following expression for the square of the skewness, in terms of the sample size &quot;ν&quot; = &quot;α&quot; + &quot;β&quot; and the variance var, is useful for the method of moments estimation of four parameters:

:formula_138

This expression correctly gives a skewness of zero for &quot;α&quot; = &quot;β&quot;, since in that case (see ): formula_139.

For the symmetric case (&quot;α&quot; = &quot;β&quot;), skewness = 0 over the whole range, and the following limits apply:

:formula_140

For the asymmetric cases (&quot;α&quot; ≠ &quot;β&quot;) the following limits (with only the noted variable approaching the limit) can be obtained from the above expressions:

:formula_141


===Kurtosis===
The beta distribution has been applied in acoustic analysis to assess damage to gears, as the kurtosis of the beta distribution has been reported to be a good indicator of the condition of a gear. Kurtosis has also been used to distinguish the seismic signal generated by a person&#x27;s footsteps from other signals. As persons or other targets moving on the ground generate continuous signals in the form of seismic waves, one can separate different targets based on the seismic waves they generate. Kurtosis is sensitive to impulsive signals, so it&#x27;s much more sensitive to the signal generated by human footsteps than other signals generated by vehicles, winds, noise, etc. Unfortunately, the notation for kurtosis has not been standardized. Kenney and Keeping use the symbol γ2 for the excess kurtosis, but Abramowitz and Stegun use different terminology. To prevent confusion between kurtosis (the fourth moment centered on the mean, normalized by the square of the variance) and excess kurtosis, when using symbols, they will be spelled out as follows:

:formula_142

Letting &quot;α&quot; = &quot;β&quot; in the above expression one obtains

:formula_143.

Therefore, for symmetric beta distributions, the excess kurtosis is negative, increasing from a minimum value of −2 at the limit as {&quot;α&quot; = &quot;β&quot;} → 0, and approaching a maximum value of zero as {&quot;α&quot; = &quot;β&quot;} → ∞. The value of −2 is the minimum value of excess kurtosis that any distribution (not just beta distributions, but any distribution of any possible kind) can ever achieve. This minimum value is reached when all the probability density is entirely concentrated at each end &quot;x&quot; = 0 and &quot;x&quot; = 1, with nothing in between: a 2-point Bernoulli distribution with equal probability 1/2 at each end (a coin toss: see section below &quot;Kurtosis bounded by the square of the skewness&quot; for further discussion). The description of kurtosis as a measure of the &quot;potential outliers&quot; (or &quot;potential rare, extreme values&quot;) of the probability distribution, is correct for all distributions including the beta distribution. When rare, extreme values can occur in the beta distribution, the higher its kurtosis; otherwise, the kurtosis is lower. For &quot;α&quot; ≠ &quot;β&quot;, skewed beta distributions, the excess kurtosis can reach unlimited positive values (particularly for &quot;α&quot; → 0 for finite &quot;β&quot;, or for &quot;β&quot; → 0 for finite &quot;α&quot;) because the side away from the mode will produce occasional extreme values. Minimum kurtosis takes place when the mass density is concentrated equally at each end (and therefore the mean is at the center), and there is no probability mass density in between the ends.

Using the parametrization in terms of mean &quot;μ&quot; and sample size &quot;ν&quot; = &quot;α&quot; + &quot;β&quot;:

:formula_135

one can express the excess kurtosis in terms of the mean &quot;μ&quot; and the sample size &quot;ν&quot; as follows:

:formula_145

The excess kurtosis can also be expressed in terms of just the following two parameters: the variance var, and the sample size &quot;ν&quot; as follows:

:formula_146

and, in terms of the variance &quot;var&quot; and the mean &quot;μ&quot; as follows:

:formula_147

The plot of excess kurtosis as a function of the variance and the mean shows that the minimum value of the excess kurtosis (−2, which is the minimum possible value for excess kurtosis for any distribution) is intimately coupled with the maximum value of variance (1/4) and the symmetry condition: the mean occurring at the midpoint (&quot;μ&quot; = 1/2). This occurs for the symmetric case of &quot;α&quot; = &quot;β&quot; = 0, with zero skewness. At the limit, this is the 2 point Bernoulli distribution with equal probability 1/2 at each Dirac delta function end &quot;x&quot; = 0 and &quot;x&quot; = 1 and zero probability everywhere else. (A coin toss: one face of the coin being &quot;x&quot; = 0 and the other face being &quot;x&quot; = 1.) Variance is maximum because the distribution is bimodal with nothing in between the two modes (spikes) at each end. Excess kurtosis is minimum: the probability density &quot;mass&quot; is zero at the mean and it is concentrated at the two peaks at each end. Excess kurtosis reaches the minimum possible value (for any distribution) when the probability density function has two spikes at each end: it is bi-&quot;peaky&quot; with nothing in between them.

On the other hand, the plot shows that for extreme skewed cases, where the mean is located near one or the other end (&quot;μ&quot; = 0 or &quot;μ&quot; = 1), the variance is close to zero, and the excess kurtosis rapidly approaches infinity when the mean of the distribution approaches either end.

Alternatively, the excess kurtosis can also be expressed in terms of just the following two parameters: the square of the skewness, and the sample size ν as follows:

:formula_148

From this last expression, one can obtain the same limits published over a century ago by Karl Pearson for the beta distribution (see section below titled &quot;Kurtosis bounded by the square of the skewness&quot;). Setting &quot;α&quot; + &quot;β&quot; = &quot;ν&quot; = 0 in the above expression, one obtains Pearson&#x27;s lower boundary (values for the skewness and excess kurtosis below the boundary (excess kurtosis + 2 − skewness2 = 0) cannot occur for any distribution, and hence Karl Pearson appropriately called the region below this boundary the &quot;impossible region&quot;). The limit of &quot;α&quot; + &quot;β&quot; = &quot;ν&quot; → ∞ determines Pearson&#x27;s upper boundary.

:formula_149

therefore:

:formula_150

Values of &quot;ν&quot; = &quot;α&quot; + &quot;β&quot; such that &quot;ν&quot; ranges from zero to infinity, 0 &lt; &quot;ν&quot; &lt; ∞, span the whole region of the beta distribution in the plane of excess kurtosis versus squared skewness.

For the symmetric case (&quot;α&quot; = &quot;β&quot;), the following limits apply:

:formula_151

For the unsymmetric cases (&quot;α&quot; ≠ &quot;β&quot;) the following limits (with only the noted variable approaching the limit) can be obtained from the above expressions:

:formula_152

===Characteristic function===
The characteristic function is the Fourier transform of the probability density function. The characteristic function of the beta distribution is Kummer&#x27;s confluent hypergeometric function (of the first kind):
:formula_153

where

: formula_154

is the rising factorial, also called the &quot;Pochhammer symbol&quot;. The value of the characteristic function for &quot;t&quot; = 0, is one:

:formula_155

Also, the real and imaginary parts of the characteristic function enjoy the following symmetries with respect to the origin of variable &quot;t&quot;:

:formula_156
:formula_157

The symmetric case &quot;α&quot; = &quot;β&quot; simplifies the characteristic function of the beta distribution to a Bessel function, since in the special case &quot;α&quot; + &quot;β&quot; = 2&quot;α&quot; the confluent hypergeometric function (of the first kind) reduces to a Bessel function (the modified Bessel function of the first kind formula_158 ) using Kummer&#x27;s second transformation as follows:

:formula_159

In the accompanying plots, the real part (Re) of the characteristic function of the beta distribution is displayed for symmetric (&quot;α&quot; = &quot;β&quot;) and skewed (&quot;α&quot; ≠ &quot;β&quot;) cases.

===Other moments===

====Moment generating function====
It also follows that the moment generating function is

:formula_160

In particular &quot;M&quot;&quot;X&quot;(&quot;α&quot;; &quot;β&quot;; 0) = 1.

====Higher moments====
Using the moment generating function, the &quot;k&quot;-th raw moment is given by the factor

:formula_161

multiplying the (exponential series) term formula_162 in the series of the moment generating function

:formula_163

where (&quot;x&quot;)(&quot;k&quot;) is a Pochhammer symbol representing rising factorial. It can also be written in a recursive form as

:formula_164

Since the moment generating function formula_165 has a positive radius of convergence, the beta distribution is determined by its moments.

====Moments of transformed random variables====

=====Moments of linearly transformed, product and inverted random variables=====
One can also show the following expectations for a transformed random variable, where the random variable &quot;X&quot; is Beta-distributed with parameters &quot;α&quot; and &quot;β&quot;: &quot;X&quot; ~ Beta(&quot;α&quot;, &quot;β&quot;). The expected value of the variable 1 − &quot;X&quot; is the mirror-symmetry of the expected value based on &quot;X&quot;:

:formula_166

Due to the mirror-symmetry of the probability density function of the beta distribution, the variances based on variables &quot;X&quot; and 1 − &quot;X&quot; are identical, and the covariance on &quot;X&quot;(1 − &quot;X&quot; is the negative of the variance:

:formula_167

These are the expected values for inverted variables, (these are related to the harmonic means, see ):

:formula_168

The following transformation by dividing the variable &quot;X&quot; by its mirror-image &quot;X&quot;/(1 − &quot;X&quot;) results in the expected value of the &quot;inverted beta distribution&quot; or beta prime distribution (also known as beta distribution of the second kind or Pearson&#x27;s Type VI):

:formula_169

Variances of these transformed variables can be obtained by integration, as the expected values of the second moments centered on the corresponding variables:

:formula_170

The following variance of the variable &quot;X&quot; divided by its mirror-image (&quot;X&quot;/(1−&quot;X&quot;) results in the variance of the &quot;inverted beta distribution&quot; or beta prime distribution (also known as beta distribution of the second kind or Pearson&#x27;s Type VI):

:formula_171

The covariances are:

:formula_172
These expectations and variances appear in the four-parameter Fisher information matrix (.)

=====Moments of logarithmically transformed random variables=====
Expected values for logarithmic transformations (useful for maximum likelihood estimates, see ) are discussed in this section. The following logarithmic linear transformations are related to the geometric means &quot;GX&quot; and &quot;G&quot;(1−&quot;X&quot;) (see ):

:formula_173

Where the digamma function &quot;ψ&quot;(&quot;α&quot;) is defined as the logarithmic derivative of the gamma function:

:formula_174

Logit transformations are interesting, as they usually transform various shapes (including J-shapes) into (usually skewed) bell-shaped densities over the logit variable, and they may remove the end singularities over the original variable:

:formula_175

Johnson considered the distribution of the logit – transformed variable ln(&quot;X&quot;/1 − &quot;X&quot;), including its moment generating function and approximations for large values of the shape parameters. This transformation extends the finite support [0, 1] based on the original variable &quot;X&quot; to infinite support in both directions of the real line (−∞, +∞). The logit of a beta variate has the logistic-beta distribution.

Higher order logarithmic moments can be derived by using the representation of a beta distribution as a proportion of two gamma distributions and differentiating through the integral. They can be expressed in terms of higher order poly-gamma functions as follows:

:formula_176

therefore the variance of the logarithmic variables and covariance of ln(&quot;X&quot;) and ln(1−&quot;X&quot;) are:

:formula_177

where the trigamma function, denoted &quot;ψ&quot;1(&quot;α&quot;), is the second of the polygamma functions, and is defined as the derivative of the digamma function:

:formula_178

The variances and covariance of the logarithmically transformed variables &quot;X&quot; and (1 − &quot;X&quot;) are different, in general, because the logarithmic transformation destroys the mirror-symmetry of the original variables &quot;X&quot; and (1 − &quot;X&quot;), as the logarithm approaches negative infinity for the variable approaching zero.

These logarithmic variances and covariance are the elements of the Fisher information matrix for the beta distribution. They are also a measure of the curvature of the log likelihood function (see section on Maximum likelihood estimation).

The variances of the log inverse variables are identical to the variances of the log variables:

:formula_179

It also follows that the variances of the logit-transformed variables are

:formula_180

===Quantities of information (entropy)===
Given a beta distributed random variable, &quot;X&quot; ~ Beta(&quot;α&quot;, &quot;β&quot;), the differential entropy of &quot;X&quot; is (measured in nats), the expected value of the negative of the logarithm of the probability density function:

:formula_181

where &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;; &quot;α&quot;, &quot;β&quot;) is the probability density function of the beta distribution:

:formula_182

The digamma function &quot;ψ&quot; appears in the formula for the differential entropy as a consequence of Euler&#x27;s integral formula for the harmonic numbers which follows from the integral:

:formula_183

The differential entropy of the beta distribution is negative for all values of &quot;α&quot; and &quot;β&quot; greater than zero, except at &quot;α&quot; = &quot;β&quot; = 1 (for which values the beta distribution is the same as the uniform distribution), where the differential entropy reaches its maximum value of zero. It is to be expected that the maximum entropy should take place when the beta distribution becomes equal to the uniform distribution, since uncertainty is maximal when all possible events are equiprobable.

For &quot;α&quot; or &quot;β&quot; approaching zero, the differential entropy approaches its minimum value of negative infinity. For (either or both) &quot;α&quot; or &quot;β&quot; approaching zero, there is a maximum amount of order: all the probability density is concentrated at the ends, and there is zero probability density at points located between the ends. Similarly for (either or both) &quot;α&quot; or &quot;β&quot; approaching infinity, the differential entropy approaches its minimum value of negative infinity, and a maximum amount of order. If either &quot;α&quot; or &quot;β&quot; approaches infinity (and the other is finite) all the probability density is concentrated at an end, and the probability density is zero everywhere else. If both shape parameters are equal (the symmetric case), &quot;α&quot; = &quot;β&quot;, and they approach infinity simultaneously, the probability density becomes a spike (Dirac delta function) concentrated at the middle &quot;x&quot; = 1/2, and hence there is 100% probability at the middle &quot;x&quot; = 1/2 and zero probability everywhere else.

The (continuous case) differential entropy was introduced by Shannon in his original paper (where he named it the &quot;entropy of a continuous distribution&quot;), as the concluding part of the same paper where he defined the discrete entropy. It is known since then that the differential entropy may differ from the infinitesimal limit of the discrete entropy by an infinite offset, therefore the differential entropy can be negative (as it is for the beta distribution). What really matters is the relative value of entropy.

Given two beta distributed random variables, &quot;X&quot;1 ~ Beta(&quot;α&quot;, &quot;β&quot;) and &quot;X&quot;2 ~ Beta(&#x27;, &#x27;), the cross-entropy is (measured in nats)

:formula_184

The cross entropy has been used as an error metric to measure the distance between two hypotheses. Its absolute value is minimum when the two distributions are identical. It is the information measure most closely related to the log maximum likelihood (see section on &quot;Parameter estimation. Maximum likelihood estimation&quot;)).

The relative entropy, or Kullback–Leibler divergence &quot;D&quot;KL(&quot;X&quot;1 || &quot;X&quot;2), is a measure of the inefficiency of assuming that the distribution is &quot;X&quot;2 ~ Beta(&#x27;, &#x27;) when the distribution is really &quot;X&quot;1 ~ Beta(&quot;α&quot;, &quot;β&quot;). It is defined as follows (measured in nats).

:formula_185

The relative entropy, or Kullback–Leibler divergence, is always non-negative. A few numerical examples follow:

*&quot;X&quot;1 ~ Beta(1, 1) and &quot;X&quot;2 ~ Beta(3, 3); &quot;D&quot;KL(&quot;X&quot;1 || &quot;X&quot;2) = 0.598803; &quot;D&quot;KL(&quot;X&quot;2 || &quot;X&quot;1) = 0.267864; &quot;h&quot;(&quot;X&quot;1) = 0; &quot;h&quot;(&quot;X&quot;2) = −0.267864
*&quot;X&quot;1 ~ Beta(3, 0.5) and &quot;X&quot;2 ~ Beta(0.5, 3); &quot;D&quot;KL(&quot;X&quot;1 || &quot;X&quot;2) = 7.21574; &quot;D&quot;KL(&quot;X&quot;2 || &quot;X&quot;1) = 7.21574; &quot;h&quot;(&quot;X&quot;1) = −1.10805; &quot;h&quot;(&quot;X&quot;2) = −1.10805.

The Kullback–Leibler divergence is not symmetric &quot;D&quot;KL(&quot;X&quot;1 || &quot;X&quot;2) ≠ &quot;D&quot;KL(&quot;X&quot;2 || &quot;X&quot;1) for the case in which the individual beta distributions Beta(1, 1) and Beta(3, 3) are symmetric, but have different entropies &quot;h&quot;(&quot;X&quot;1) ≠ &quot;h&quot;(&quot;X&quot;2). The value of the Kullback divergence depends on the direction traveled: whether going from a higher (differential) entropy to a lower (differential) entropy or the other way around. In the numerical example above, the Kullback divergence measures the inefficiency of assuming that the distribution is (bell-shaped) Beta(3, 3), rather than (uniform) Beta(1, 1). The &quot;h&quot; entropy of Beta(1, 1) is higher than the &quot;h&quot; entropy of Beta(3, 3) because the uniform distribution Beta(1, 1) has a maximum amount of disorder. The Kullback divergence is more than two times higher (0.598803 instead of 0.267864) when measured in the direction of decreasing entropy: the direction that assumes that the (uniform) Beta(1, 1) distribution is (bell-shaped) Beta(3, 3) rather than the other way around. In this restricted sense, the Kullback divergence is consistent with the second law of thermodynamics.

The Kullback–Leibler divergence is symmetric &quot;D&quot;KL(&quot;X&quot;1 || &quot;X&quot;2) = &quot;D&quot;KL(&quot;X&quot;2 || &quot;X&quot;1) for the skewed cases Beta(3, 0.5) and Beta(0.5, 3) that have equal differential entropy &quot;h&quot;(&quot;X&quot;1) = &quot;h&quot;(&quot;X&quot;2).

The symmetry condition:

:formula_186

follows from the above definitions and the mirror-symmetry &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;; &quot;α&quot;, &quot;β&quot;) = &quot;f&quot;(1 − &quot;x&quot;; &quot;α&quot;, &quot;β&quot;) enjoyed by the beta distribution.

===Relationships between statistical measures===

====Mean, mode and median relationship====
If 1 &lt; &quot;α&quot; &lt; &quot;β&quot; then mode ≤ median ≤ mean. Expressing the mode (only for &quot;α&quot;, &quot;β&quot; &gt; 1), and the mean in terms of &quot;α&quot; and &quot;β&quot;:

: formula_187

If 1 &lt; &quot;β&quot; &lt; &quot;α&quot; then the order of the inequalities are reversed. For &quot;α&quot;, &quot;β&quot; &gt; 1 the absolute distance between the mean and the median is less than 5% of the distance between the maximum and minimum values of &quot;x&quot;. On the other hand, the absolute distance between the mean and the mode can reach 50% of the distance between the maximum and minimum values of &quot;x&quot;, for the (pathological) case of &quot;α&quot; = 1 and &quot;β&quot; = 1, for which values the beta distribution approaches the uniform distribution and the differential entropy approaches its maximum value, and hence maximum &quot;disorder&quot;.

For example, for &quot;α&quot; = 1.0001 and &quot;β&quot; = 1.00000001:
* mode = 0.9999; PDF(mode) = 1.00010
* mean = 0.500025; PDF(mean) = 1.00003
* median = 0.500035; PDF(median) = 1.00003
* mean − mode = −0.499875
* mean − median = −9.65538 × 10−6

where PDF stands for the value of the probability density function.


====Mean, geometric mean and harmonic mean relationship====
It is known from the inequality of arithmetic and geometric means that the geometric mean is lower than the mean. Similarly, the harmonic mean is lower than the geometric mean. The accompanying plot shows that for &quot;α&quot; = &quot;β&quot;, both the mean and the median are exactly equal to 1/2, regardless of the value of &quot;α&quot; = &quot;β&quot;, and the mode is also equal to 1/2 for &quot;α&quot; = &quot;β&quot; &gt; 1, however the geometric and harmonic means are lower than 1/2 and they only approach this value asymptotically as &quot;α&quot; = &quot;β&quot; → ∞.

====Kurtosis bounded by the square of the skewness====
As remarked by Feller, in the Pearson system the beta probability density appears as type I (any difference between the beta distribution and Pearson&#x27;s type I distribution is only superficial and it makes no difference for the following discussion regarding the relationship between kurtosis and skewness). Karl Pearson showed, in Plate 1 of his paper published in 1916, a graph with the kurtosis as the vertical axis (ordinate) and the square of the skewness as the horizontal axis (abscissa), in which a number of distributions were displayed. The region occupied by the beta distribution is bounded by the following two lines in the (skewness2,kurtosis) plane, or the (skewness2,excess kurtosis) plane:

:formula_188

or, equivalently,

:formula_189

At a time when there were no powerful digital computers, Karl Pearson accurately computed further boundaries, for example, separating the &quot;U-shaped&quot; from the &quot;J-shaped&quot; distributions. The lower boundary line (excess kurtosis + 2 − skewness2 = 0) is produced by skewed &quot;U-shaped&quot; beta distributions with both values of shape parameters &quot;α&quot; and &quot;β&quot; close to zero. The upper boundary line (excess kurtosis − (3/2) skewness2 = 0) is produced by extremely skewed distributions with very large values of one of the parameters and very small values of the other parameter. Karl Pearson showed that this upper boundary line (excess kurtosis − (3/2) skewness2 = 0) is also the intersection with Pearson&#x27;s distribution III, which has unlimited support in one direction (towards positive infinity), and can be bell-shaped or J-shaped. His son, Egon Pearson, showed that the region (in the kurtosis/squared-skewness plane) occupied by the beta distribution (equivalently, Pearson&#x27;s distribution I) as it approaches this boundary (excess kurtosis − (3/2) skewness2 = 0) is shared with the noncentral chi-squared distribution. Karl Pearson (Pearson 1895, pp. 357, 360, 373–376) also showed that the gamma distribution is a Pearson type III distribution. Hence this boundary line for Pearson&#x27;s type III distribution is known as the gamma line. (This can be shown from the fact that the excess kurtosis of the gamma distribution is 6/&quot;k&quot; and the square of the skewness is 4/&quot;k&quot;, hence (excess kurtosis − (3/2) skewness2 = 0) is identically satisfied by the gamma distribution regardless of the value of the parameter &quot;k&quot;). Pearson later noted that the chi-squared distribution is a special case of Pearson&#x27;s type III and also shares this boundary line (as it is apparent from the fact that for the chi-squared distribution the excess kurtosis is 12/&quot;k&quot; and the square of the skewness is 8/&quot;k&quot;, hence (excess kurtosis − (3/2) skewness2 = 0) is identically satisfied regardless of the value of the parameter &quot;k&quot;). This is to be expected, since the chi-squared distribution &quot;X&quot; ~ χ2(&quot;k&quot;) is a special case of the gamma distribution, with parametrization X ~ Γ(k/2, 1/2) where k is a positive integer that specifies the &quot;number of degrees of freedom&quot; of the chi-squared distribution.

An example of a beta distribution near the upper boundary (excess kurtosis − (3/2) skewness2 = 0) is given by α = 0.1, β = 1000, for which the ratio (excess kurtosis)/(skewness2) = 1.49835 approaches the upper limit of 1.5 from below. An example of a beta distribution near the lower boundary (excess kurtosis + 2 − skewness2 = 0) is given by α= 0.0001, β = 0.1, for which values the expression (excess kurtosis + 2)/(skewness2) = 1.01621 approaches the lower limit of 1 from above. In the infinitesimal limit for both &quot;α&quot; and &quot;β&quot; approaching zero symmetrically, the excess kurtosis reaches its minimum value at −2. This minimum value occurs at the point at which the lower boundary line intersects the vertical axis (ordinate). (However, in Pearson&#x27;s original chart, the ordinate is kurtosis, instead of excess kurtosis, and it increases downwards rather than upwards).

Values for the skewness and excess kurtosis below the lower boundary (excess kurtosis + 2 − skewness2 = 0) cannot occur for any distribution, and hence Karl Pearson appropriately called the region below this boundary the &quot;impossible region&quot;. The boundary for this &quot;impossible region&quot; is determined by (symmetric or skewed) bimodal U-shaped distributions for which the parameters &quot;α&quot; and &quot;β&quot; approach zero and hence all the probability density is concentrated at the ends: &quot;x&quot; = 0, 1 with practically nothing in between them. Since for &quot;α&quot; ≈ &quot;β&quot; ≈ 0 the probability density is concentrated at the two ends &quot;x&quot; = 0 and &quot;x&quot; = 1, this &quot;impossible boundary&quot; is determined by a Bernoulli distribution, where the two only possible outcomes occur with respective probabilities &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot; = 1 − &quot;p&quot;. For cases approaching this limit boundary with symmetry &quot;α&quot; = &quot;β&quot;, skewness ≈ 0, excess kurtosis ≈ −2 (this is the lowest excess kurtosis possible for any distribution), and the probabilities are &quot;p&quot; ≈ &quot;q&quot; ≈ 1/2. For cases approaching this limit boundary with skewness, excess kurtosis ≈ −2 + skewness2, and the probability density is concentrated more at one end than the other end (with practically nothing in between), with probabilities formula_190 at the left end &quot;x&quot; = 0 and formula_191 at the right end &quot;x&quot; = 1.

===Geometry of the probability density function===

====Inflection points====

For certain values of the shape parameters α and β, the probability density function has inflection points, at which the curvature changes sign. The position of these inflection points can be useful as a measure of the dispersion or spread of the distribution.

Defining the following quantity:

:formula_211

Points of inflection occur, depending on the value of the shape parameters &quot;α&quot; and &quot;β&quot;, as follows:

*(&quot;α&quot; &gt; 2, &quot;β&quot; &gt; 2) The distribution is bell-shaped (symmetric for &quot;α&quot; = &quot;β&quot; and skewed otherwise), with two inflection points, equidistant from the mode:
::formula_212

* (&quot;α&quot; = 2, &quot;β&quot; &gt; 2) The distribution is unimodal, positively skewed, right-tailed, with one inflection point, located to the right of the mode:
::formula_213

* (&quot;α&quot; &gt; 2, β = 2) The distribution is unimodal, negatively skewed, left-tailed, with one inflection point, located to the left of the mode:
::formula_214

* (1 &lt; &quot;α&quot; &lt; 2, β &gt; 2, &quot;α&quot; + &quot;β&quot; &gt; 2) The distribution is unimodal, positively skewed, right-tailed, with one inflection point, located to the right of the mode:
::formula_215

*(0 &lt; &quot;α&quot; &lt; 1, 1 &lt; &quot;β&quot; &lt; 2) The distribution has a mode at the left end &quot;x&quot; = 0 and it is positively skewed, right-tailed. There is one inflection point, located to the right of the mode:
::formula_216

*(&quot;α&quot; &gt; 2, 1 &lt; &quot;β&quot; &lt; 2) The distribution is unimodal negatively skewed, left-tailed, with one inflection point, located to the left of the mode:
::formula_217

*(1 &lt; &quot;α&quot; &lt; 2, 0 &lt; &quot;β&quot; &lt; 1) The distribution has a mode at the right end &quot;x&quot; = 1 and it is negatively skewed, left-tailed. There is one inflection point, located to the left of the mode:

There are no inflection points in the remaining (symmetric and skewed) regions: U-shaped: (&quot;α&quot;, &quot;β&quot; &lt; 1) upside-down-U-shaped: (1 &lt; &quot;α&quot; &lt; 2, 1 &lt; &quot;β&quot; &lt; 2), reverse-J-shaped (&quot;α&quot; &lt; 1, &quot;β&quot; &gt; 2) or J-shaped: (&quot;α&quot; &gt; 2, &quot;β&quot; &lt; 1)

The accompanying plots show the inflection point locations (shown vertically, ranging from 0 to 1) versus &quot;α&quot; and &quot;β&quot; (the horizontal axes ranging from 0 to 5). There are large cuts at surfaces intersecting the lines &quot;α&quot; = 1, &quot;β&quot; = 1, &quot;α&quot; = 2, and &quot;β&quot; = 2 because at these values the beta distribution change from 2 modes, to 1 mode to no mode.

====Shapes====


The beta density function can take a wide variety of different shapes depending on the values of the two parameters &quot;α&quot; and &quot;β&quot;. The ability of the beta distribution to take this great diversity of shapes (using only two parameters) is partly responsible for finding wide application for modeling actual measurements:

===Parameter estimation===

====Method of moments====

=====Two unknown parameters=====
Two unknown parameters (formula_266 of a beta distribution supported in the [0,1] interval) can be estimated, using the method of moments, with the first two moments (sample mean and sample variance) as follows. Let:

: formula_267

be the sample mean estimate and

: formula_268

be the sample variance estimate. The method-of-moments estimates of the parameters are

:formula_269 if formula_270
: formula_271 if formula_272
When the distribution is required over a known interval other than [0, 1] with random variable &quot;X&quot;, say [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;c&quot;] with random variable &quot;Y&quot;, then replace formula_273 with formula_274 and formula_275 with formula_276 in the above couple of equations for the shape parameters (see the &quot;Four unknown parameters&quot; section below), where:

: formula_277
: formula_278

=====Four unknown parameters=====
All four parameters (formula_279 of a beta distribution supported in the [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;c&quot;] interval, see section &quot;Alternative parametrizations, Four parameters&quot;) can be estimated, using the method of moments developed by Karl Pearson, by equating sample and population values of the first four central moments (mean, variance, skewness and excess kurtosis). The excess kurtosis was expressed in terms of the square of the skewness, and the sample size ν = α + β, (see previous section &quot;Kurtosis&quot;) as follows:

:formula_280

One can use this equation to solve for the sample size ν= α + β in terms of the square of the skewness and the excess kurtosis as follows:

:formula_281
:formula_282

This is the ratio (multiplied by a factor of 3) between the previously derived limit boundaries for the beta distribution in a space (as originally done by Karl Pearson) defined with coordinates of the square of the skewness in one axis and the excess kurtosis in the other axis (see ):

The case of zero skewness, can be immediately solved because for zero skewness, α = β and hence ν = 2α = 2β, therefore α = β = ν/2

: formula_283
: formula_284

(Excess kurtosis is negative for the beta distribution with zero skewness, ranging from -2 to 0, so that formula_285 -and therefore the sample shape parameters- is positive, ranging from zero when the shape parameters approach zero and the excess kurtosis approaches -2, to infinity when the shape parameters approach infinity and the excess kurtosis approaches zero).

For non-zero sample skewness one needs to solve a system of two coupled equations. Since the skewness and the excess kurtosis are independent of the parameters formula_286, the parameters formula_287 can be uniquely determined from the sample skewness and the sample excess kurtosis, by solving the coupled equations with two known variables (sample skewness and sample excess kurtosis) and two unknowns (the shape parameters):

:formula_288
:formula_289
:formula_290

resulting in the following solution:

: formula_291

: formula_292

Where one should take the solutions as follows: formula_293 for (negative) sample skewness &lt; 0, and formula_294 for (positive) sample skewness &gt; 0.

The accompanying plot shows these two solutions as surfaces in a space with horizontal axes of (sample excess kurtosis) and (sample squared skewness) and the shape parameters as the vertical axis. The surfaces are constrained by the condition that the sample excess kurtosis must be bounded by the sample squared skewness as stipulated in the above equation. The two surfaces meet at the right edge defined by zero skewness. Along this right edge, both parameters are equal and the distribution is symmetric U-shaped for α = β &lt; 1, uniform for α = β = 1, upside-down-U-shaped for 1 &lt; α = β &lt; 2 and bell-shaped for α = β &gt; 2. The surfaces also meet at the front (lower) edge defined by &quot;the impossible boundary&quot; line (excess kurtosis + 2 - skewness2 = 0). Along this front (lower) boundary both shape parameters approach zero, and the probability density is concentrated more at one end than the other end (with practically nothing in between), with probabilities formula_295 at the left end &quot;x&quot; = 0 and formula_296 at the right end &quot;x&quot; = 1. The two surfaces become further apart towards the rear edge. At this rear edge the surface parameters are quite different from each other. As remarked, for example, by Bowman and Shenton, sampling in the neighborhood of the line (sample excess kurtosis - (3/2)(sample skewness)2 = 0) (the just-J-shaped portion of the rear edge where blue meets beige), &quot;is dangerously near to chaos&quot;, because at that line the denominator of the expression above for the estimate ν = α + β becomes zero and hence ν approaches infinity as that line is approached. Bowman and Shenton write that &quot;the higher moment parameters (kurtosis and skewness) are extremely fragile (near that line). However, the mean and standard deviation are fairly reliable.&quot; Therefore, the problem is for the case of four parameter estimation for very skewed distributions such that the excess kurtosis approaches (3/2) times the square of the skewness. This boundary line is produced by extremely skewed distributions with very large values of one of the parameters and very small values of the other parameter. See for a numerical example and further comments about this rear edge boundary line (sample excess kurtosis - (3/2)(sample skewness)2 = 0). As remarked by Karl Pearson himself this issue may not be of much practical importance as this trouble arises only for very skewed J-shaped (or mirror-image J-shaped) distributions with very different values of shape parameters that are unlikely to occur much in practice). The usual skewed-bell-shape distributions that occur in practice do not have this parameter estimation problem.

The remaining two parameters formula_286 can be determined using the sample mean and the sample variance using a variety of equations. One alternative is to calculate the support interval range formula_298 based on the sample variance and the sample kurtosis. For this purpose one can solve, in terms of the range formula_299, the equation expressing the excess kurtosis in terms of the sample variance, and the sample size ν (see and ):

:formula_300

to obtain:

:formula_301

Another alternative is to calculate the support interval range formula_298 based on the sample variance and the sample skewness. For this purpose one can solve, in terms of the range formula_298, the equation expressing the squared skewness in terms of the sample variance, and the sample size ν (see section titled &quot;Skewness&quot; and &quot;Alternative parametrizations, four parameters&quot;):

:formula_304

to obtain:

:formula_305

The remaining parameter can be determined from the sample mean and the previously obtained parameters: formula_306:

:formula_307

and finally, formula_308.

In the above formulas one may take, for example, as estimates of the sample moments:

:formula_309

The estimators &quot;G&quot;1 for sample skewness and &quot;G&quot;2 for sample kurtosis are used by DAP/SAS, PSPP/SPSS, and Excel. However, they are not used by BMDP and (according to ) they were not used by MINITAB in 1998. Actually, Joanes and Gill in their 1998 study concluded that the skewness and kurtosis estimators used in BMDP and in MINITAB (at that time) had smaller variance and mean-squared error in normal samples, but the skewness and kurtosis estimators used in DAP/SAS, PSPP/SPSS, namely &quot;G&quot;1 and &quot;G&quot;2, had smaller mean-squared error in samples from a very skewed distribution. It is for this reason that we have spelled out &quot;sample skewness&quot;, etc., in the above formulas, to make it explicit that the user should choose the best estimator according to the problem at hand, as the best estimator for skewness and kurtosis depends on the amount of skewness (as shown by Joanes and Gill).

====Maximum likelihood====

=====Two unknown parameters=====

As is also the case for maximum likelihood estimates for the gamma distribution, the maximum likelihood estimates for the beta distribution do not have a general closed form solution for arbitrary values of the shape parameters. If &quot;X&quot;1, ..., &quot;XN&quot; are independent random variables each having a beta distribution, the joint log likelihood function for &quot;N&quot; iid observations is:

:formula_310

Finding the maximum with respect to a shape parameter involves taking the partial derivative with respect to the shape parameter and setting the expression equal to zero yielding the maximum likelihood estimator of the shape parameters:

:formula_311
:formula_312

where:

:formula_313
:formula_314

since the digamma function denoted ψ(α) is defined as the logarithmic derivative of the gamma function:

:formula_315

To ensure that the values with zero tangent slope are indeed a maximum (instead of a saddle-point or a minimum) one has to also satisfy the condition that the curvature is negative. This amounts to satisfying that the second partial derivative with respect to the shape parameters is negative

:formula_316
:formula_317

using the previous equations, this is equivalent to:

:formula_318
:formula_319

where the trigamma function, denoted &quot;ψ&quot;1(&quot;α&quot;), is the second of the polygamma functions, and is defined as the derivative of the digamma function:

:formula_320

These conditions are equivalent to stating that the variances of the logarithmically transformed variables are positive, since:

:formula_321
:formula_322

Therefore, the condition of negative curvature at a maximum is equivalent to the statements:

: formula_323
: formula_324

Alternatively, the condition of negative curvature at a maximum is also equivalent to stating that the following logarithmic derivatives of the geometric means &quot;GX&quot; and &quot;G(1−X)&quot; are positive, since:

: formula_325
: formula_326

While these slopes are indeed positive, the other slopes are negative:

:formula_327

The slopes of the mean and the median with respect to &quot;α&quot; and &quot;β&quot; display similar sign behavior.

From the condition that at a maximum, the partial derivative with respect to the shape parameter equals zero, we obtain the following system of coupled maximum likelihood estimate equations (for the average log-likelihoods) that needs to be inverted to obtain the (unknown) shape parameter estimates formula_328 in terms of the (known) average of logarithms of the samples &quot;X&quot;1, ..., &quot;XN&quot;:

:formula_329

where we recognize formula_330 as the logarithm of the sample geometric mean and formula_331 as the logarithm of the sample geometric mean based on (1 − &quot;X&quot;), the mirror-image of &quot;X&quot;. For formula_332, it follows that formula_333.

:formula_334

These coupled equations containing digamma functions of the shape parameter estimates formula_328 must be solved by numerical methods as done, for example, by Beckman et al. Gnanadesikan et al. give numerical solutions for a few cases. N.L.Johnson and S.Kotz suggest that for &quot;not too small&quot; shape parameter estimates formula_328, the logarithmic approximation to the digamma function formula_337 may be used to obtain initial values for an iterative solution, since the equations resulting from this approximation can be solved exactly:

:formula_338
:formula_339

which leads to the following solution for the initial values (of the estimate shape parameters in terms of the sample geometric means) for an iterative solution:

:formula_340
:formula_341

Alternatively, the estimates provided by the method of moments can instead be used as initial values for an iterative solution of the maximum likelihood coupled equations in terms of the digamma functions.

When the distribution is required over a known interval other than [0, 1] with random variable &quot;X&quot;, say [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;c&quot;] with random variable &quot;Y&quot;, then replace ln(&quot;Xi&quot;) in the first equation with

:formula_342,

and replace ln(1−&quot;Xi&quot;) in the second equation with

:formula_343

(see &quot;Alternative parametrizations, four parameters&quot; section below).

If one of the shape parameters is known, the problem is considerably simplified. The following logit transformation can be used to solve for the unknown shape parameter (for skewed cases such that formula_344, otherwise, if symmetric, both -equal- parameters are known when one is known):

:formula_345

This logit transformation is the logarithm of the transformation that divides the variable &quot;X&quot; by its mirror-image (&quot;X&quot;/(1 - &quot;X&quot;) resulting in the &quot;inverted beta distribution&quot; or beta prime distribution (also known as beta distribution of the second kind or Pearson&#x27;s Type VI) with support [0, +∞). As previously discussed in the section &quot;Moments of logarithmically transformed random variables,&quot; the logit transformation formula_346, studied by Johnson, extends the finite support [0, 1] based on the original variable &quot;X&quot; to infinite support in both directions of the real line (−∞, +∞).

If, for example, formula_347 is known, the unknown parameter formula_348 can be obtained in terms of the inverse digamma function of the right hand side of this equation:

:formula_349
:formula_350

In particular, if one of the shape parameters has a value of unity, for example for formula_351 (the power function distribution with bounded support [0,1]), using the identity ψ(&quot;x&quot; + 1) = ψ(&quot;x&quot;) + 1/&quot;x&quot; in the equation formula_352, the maximum likelihood estimator for the unknown parameter formula_348 is, exactly:

:formula_354

The beta has support [0, 1], therefore formula_355, and hence formula_356, and therefore formula_357

In conclusion, the maximum likelihood estimates of the shape parameters of a beta distribution are (in general) a complicated function of the sample geometric mean, and of the sample geometric mean based on &quot;(1−X)&quot;, the mirror-image of &quot;X&quot;. One may ask, if the variance (in addition to the mean) is necessary to estimate two shape parameters with the method of moments, why is the (logarithmic or geometric) variance not necessary to estimate two shape parameters with the maximum likelihood method, for which only the geometric means suffice? The answer is because the mean does not provide as much information as the geometric mean. For a beta distribution with equal shape parameters &quot;α&quot; = &quot;β&quot;, the mean is exactly 1/2, regardless of the value of the shape parameters, and therefore regardless of the value of the statistical dispersion (the variance). On the other hand, the geometric mean of a beta distribution with equal shape parameters &quot;α&quot; = &quot;β&quot;, depends on the value of the shape parameters, and therefore it contains more information. Also, the geometric mean of a beta distribution does not satisfy the symmetry conditions satisfied by the mean, therefore, by employing both the geometric mean based on &quot;X&quot; and geometric mean based on (1 − &quot;X&quot;), the maximum likelihood method is able to provide best estimates for both parameters &quot;α&quot; = &quot;β&quot;, without need of employing the variance.

One can express the joint log likelihood per &quot;N&quot; iid observations in terms of the &quot;sufficient statistics&quot; (the sample geometric means) as follows:

:formula_358

We can plot the joint log likelihood per &quot;N&quot; observations for fixed values of the sample geometric means to see the behavior of the likelihood function as a function of the shape parameters α and β. In such a plot, the shape parameter estimators formula_328 correspond to the maxima of the likelihood function. See the accompanying graph that shows that all the likelihood functions intersect at α = β = 1, which corresponds to the values of the shape parameters that give the maximum entropy (the maximum entropy occurs for shape parameters equal to unity: the uniform distribution). It is evident from the plot that the likelihood function gives sharp peaks for values of the shape parameter estimators close to zero, but that for values of the shape parameters estimators greater than one, the likelihood function becomes quite flat, with less defined peaks. Obviously, the maximum likelihood parameter estimation method for the beta distribution becomes less acceptable for larger values of the shape parameter estimators, as the uncertainty in the peak definition increases with the value of the shape parameter estimators. One can arrive at the same conclusion by noticing that the expression for the curvature of the likelihood function is in terms of the geometric variances

:formula_360
:formula_361

These variances (and therefore the curvatures) are much larger for small values of the shape parameter α and β. However, for shape parameter values α, β &gt; 1, the variances (and therefore the curvatures) flatten out. Equivalently, this result follows from the Cramér–Rao bound, since the Fisher information matrix components for the beta distribution are these logarithmic variances. The Cramér–Rao bound states that the variance of any &quot;unbiased&quot; estimator formula_348 of α is bounded by the reciprocal of the Fisher information:

:formula_363
:formula_364

so the variance of the estimators increases with increasing α and β, as the logarithmic variances decrease.

Also one can express the joint log likelihood per &quot;N&quot; iid observations in terms of the digamma function expressions for the logarithms of the sample geometric means as follows:

:formula_365

this expression is identical to the negative of the cross-entropy (see section on &quot;Quantities of information (entropy)&quot;). Therefore, finding the maximum of the joint log likelihood of the shape parameters, per &quot;N&quot; iid observations, is identical to finding the minimum of the cross-entropy for the beta distribution, as a function of the shape parameters.

:formula_366

with the cross-entropy defined as follows:

:formula_367

=====Four unknown parameters=====
The procedure is similar to the one followed in the two unknown parameter case. If &quot;Y&quot;1, ..., &quot;YN&quot; are independent random variables each having a beta distribution with four parameters, the joint log likelihood function for &quot;N&quot; iid observations is:

:formula_368

Finding the maximum with respect to a shape parameter involves taking the partial derivative with respect to the shape parameter and setting the expression equal to zero yielding the maximum likelihood estimator of the shape parameters:

:formula_369
:formula_370
:formula_371
:formula_372

these equations can be re-arranged as the following system of four coupled equations (the first two equations are geometric means and the second two equations are the harmonic means) in terms of the maximum likelihood estimates for the four parameters formula_279:

:formula_374
:formula_375
:formula_376
:formula_377

with sample geometric means:

:formula_378
:formula_379

The parameters formula_286 are embedded inside the geometric mean expressions in a nonlinear way (to the power 1/&quot;N&quot;). This precludes, in general, a closed form solution, even for an initial value approximation for iteration purposes. One alternative is to use as initial values for iteration the values obtained from the method of moments solution for the four parameter case. Furthermore, the expressions for the harmonic means are well-defined only for formula_381, which precludes a maximum likelihood solution for shape parameters less than unity in the four-parameter case. Fisher&#x27;s information matrix for the four parameter case is positive-definite only for α, β &gt; 2 (for further discussion, see section on Fisher information matrix, four parameter case), for bell-shaped (symmetric or unsymmetric) beta distributions, with inflection points located to either side of the mode. The following Fisher information components (that represent the expectations of the curvature of the log likelihood function) have singularities at the following values:

:formula_382
:formula_383
:formula_384
:formula_385

(for further discussion see section on Fisher information matrix). Thus, it is not possible to strictly carry on the maximum likelihood estimation for some well known distributions belonging to the four-parameter beta distribution family, like the uniform distribution (Beta(1, 1, &quot;a&quot;, &quot;c&quot;)), and the arcsine distribution (Beta(1/2, 1/2, &quot;a&quot;, &quot;c&quot;)). N.L.Johnson and S.Kotz ignore the equations for the harmonic means and instead suggest &quot;If a and c are unknown, and maximum likelihood estimators of &quot;a&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, α and β are required, the above procedure (for the two unknown parameter case, with &quot;X&quot; transformed as &quot;X&quot; = (&quot;Y&quot; − &quot;a&quot;)/(&quot;c&quot; − &quot;a&quot;)) can be repeated using a succession of trial values of &quot;a&quot; and &quot;c&quot;, until the pair (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;c&quot;) for which maximum likelihood (given &quot;a&quot; and &quot;c&quot;) is as great as possible, is attained&quot; (where, for the purpose of clarity, their notation for the parameters has been translated into the present notation).

====Fisher information matrix====
Let a random variable X have a probability density &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;;&quot;α&quot;). The partial derivative with respect to the (unknown, and to be estimated) parameter α of the log likelihood function is called the score. The second moment of the score is called the Fisher information:

:formula_386

The expectation of the score is zero, therefore the Fisher information is also the second moment centered on the mean of the score: the variance of the score.

If the log likelihood function is twice differentiable with respect to the parameter α, and under certain regularity conditions, then the Fisher information may also be written as follows (which is often a more convenient form for calculation purposes):

:formula_387

Thus, the Fisher information is the negative of the expectation of the second derivative with respect to the parameter α of the log likelihood function. Therefore, Fisher information is a measure of the curvature of the log likelihood function of α. A low curvature (and therefore high radius of curvature), flatter log likelihood function curve has low Fisher information; while a log likelihood function curve with large curvature (and therefore low radius of curvature) has high Fisher information. When the Fisher information matrix is computed at the evaluates of the parameters (&quot;the observed Fisher information matrix&quot;) it is equivalent to the replacement of the true log likelihood surface by a Taylor&#x27;s series approximation, taken as far as the quadratic terms. The word information, in the context of Fisher information, refers to information about the parameters. Information such as: estimation, sufficiency and properties of variances of estimators. The Cramér–Rao bound states that the inverse of the Fisher information is a lower bound on the variance of any estimator of a parameter α:

:formula_388

The precision to which one can estimate the estimator of a parameter α is limited by the Fisher Information of the log likelihood function. The Fisher information is a measure of the minimum error involved in estimating a parameter of a distribution and it can be viewed as a measure of the resolving power of an experiment needed to discriminate between two alternative hypothesis of a parameter.

When there are &quot;N&quot; parameters

:formula_389

then the Fisher information takes the form of an &quot;N&quot;×&quot;N&quot; positive semidefinite symmetric matrix, the Fisher information matrix, with typical element:

:formula_390

Under certain regularity conditions, the Fisher Information Matrix may also be written in the following form, which is often more convenient for computation:

:formula_391

With &quot;X&quot;1, ..., &quot;XN&quot; iid random variables, an &quot;N&quot;-dimensional &quot;box&quot; can be constructed with sides &quot;X&quot;1, ..., &quot;XN&quot;. Costa and Cover show that the (Shannon) differential entropy &quot;h&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) is related to the volume of the typical set (having the sample entropy close to the true entropy), while the Fisher information is related to the surface of this typical set.

=====Two parameters=====
For &quot;X&quot;1, ..., &quot;X&quot;&quot;N&quot; independent random variables each having a beta distribution parametrized with shape parameters &quot;α&quot; and &quot;β&quot;, the joint log likelihood function for &quot;N&quot; iid observations is:

: formula_392

therefore the joint log likelihood function per &quot;N&quot; iid observations is

:formula_393

For the two parameter case, the Fisher information has 4 components: 2 diagonal and 2 off-diagonal. Since the Fisher information matrix is symmetric, one of these off diagonal components is independent. Therefore, the Fisher information matrix has 3 independent components (2 diagonal and 1 off diagonal).
Aryal and Nadarajah calculated Fisher&#x27;s information matrix for the four-parameter case, from which the two parameter case can be obtained as follows:

:formula_394
:formula_395
:formula_396

Since the Fisher information matrix is symmetric

:formula_397

The Fisher information components are equal to the log geometric variances and log geometric covariance. Therefore, they can be expressed as trigamma functions, denoted ψ1(α), the second of the polygamma functions, defined as the derivative of the digamma function:

:formula_398

These derivatives are also derived in the and plots of the log likelihood function are also shown in that section. contains plots and further discussion of the Fisher information matrix components: the log geometric variances and log geometric covariance as a function of the shape parameters α and β. contains formulas for moments of logarithmically transformed random variables. Images for the Fisher information components formula_399 and formula_400 are shown in .

The determinant of Fisher&#x27;s information matrix is of interest (for example for the calculation of Jeffreys prior probability). From the expressions for the individual components of the Fisher information matrix, it follows that the determinant of Fisher&#x27;s (symmetric) information matrix for the beta distribution is:

:formula_401

From Sylvester&#x27;s criterion (checking whether the diagonal elements are all positive), it follows that the Fisher information matrix for the two parameter case is positive-definite (under the standard condition that the shape parameters are positive &quot;α&quot; &gt; 0 and &quot;β&quot; &gt; 0).

=====Four parameters=====

If &quot;Y&quot;1, ..., &quot;YN&quot; are independent random variables each having a beta distribution with four parameters: the exponents &quot;α&quot; and &quot;β&quot;, and also &quot;a&quot; (the minimum of the distribution range), and &quot;c&quot; (the maximum of the distribution range) (section titled &quot;Alternative parametrizations&quot;, &quot;Four parameters&quot;), with probability density function:

:formula_402

the joint log likelihood function per &quot;N&quot; iid observations is:

:formula_403

For the four parameter case, the Fisher information has 4*4=16 components. It has 12 off-diagonal components = (4×4 total − 4 diagonal). Since the Fisher information matrix is symmetric, half of these components (12/2=6) are independent. Therefore, the Fisher information matrix has 6 independent off-diagonal + 4 diagonal = 10 independent components. Aryal and Nadarajah calculated Fisher&#x27;s information matrix for the four parameter case as follows:

:formula_404
:formula_405
:formula_406

In the above expressions, the use of &quot;X&quot; instead of &quot;Y&quot; in the expressions var[ln(&quot;X&quot;)] = ln(var&quot;GX&quot;) is &quot;not an error&quot;. The expressions in terms of the log geometric variances and log geometric covariance occur as functions of the two parameter &quot;X&quot; ~ Beta(&quot;α&quot;, &quot;β&quot;) parametrization because when taking the partial derivatives with respect to the exponents (&quot;α&quot;, &quot;β&quot;) in the four parameter case, one obtains the identical expressions as for the two parameter case: these terms of the four parameter Fisher information matrix are independent of the minimum &quot;a&quot; and maximum &quot;c&quot; of the distribution&#x27;s range. The only non-zero term upon double differentiation of the log likelihood function with respect to the exponents &quot;α&quot; and &quot;β&quot; is the second derivative of the log of the beta function: ln(B(&quot;α&quot;, &quot;β&quot;)). This term is independent of the minimum &quot;a&quot; and maximum &quot;c&quot; of the distribution&#x27;s range. Double differentiation of this term results in trigamma functions. The sections titled &quot;Maximum likelihood&quot;, &quot;Two unknown parameters&quot; and &quot;Four unknown parameters&quot; also show this fact.

The Fisher information for &quot;N&quot; i.i.d. samples is &quot;N&quot; times the individual Fisher information (eq. 11.279, page 394 of Cover and Thomas). (Aryal and Nadarajah take a single observation, &quot;N&quot; = 1, to calculate the following components of the Fisher information, which leads to the same result as considering the derivatives of the log likelihood per &quot;N&quot; observations. Moreover, below the erroneous expression for formula_407 in Aryal and Nadarajah has been corrected.)

:formula_408

The lower two diagonal entries of the Fisher information matrix, with respect to the parameter &quot;a&quot; (the minimum of the distribution&#x27;s range): formula_409, and with respect to the parameter &quot;c&quot; (the maximum of the distribution&#x27;s range): formula_410 are only defined for exponents &quot;α&quot; &gt; 2 and &quot;β&quot; &gt; 2 respectively. The Fisher information matrix component formula_409 for the minimum &quot;a&quot; approaches infinity for exponent α approaching 2 from above, and the Fisher information matrix component formula_410 for the maximum &quot;c&quot; approaches infinity for exponent &quot;β&quot; approaching 2 from above.

The Fisher information matrix for the four parameter case does not depend on the individual values of the minimum &quot;a&quot; and the maximum &quot;c&quot;, but only on the total range (&quot;c&quot; − &quot;a&quot;). Moreover, the components of the Fisher information matrix that depend on the range (&quot;c&quot; − &quot;a&quot;), depend only through its inverse (or the square of the inverse), such that the Fisher information decreases for increasing range (&quot;c&quot; − &quot;a&quot;).

The accompanying images show the Fisher information components formula_409 and formula_414. Images for the Fisher information components formula_415 and formula_416 are shown in . All these Fisher information components look like a basin, with the &quot;walls&quot; of the basin being located at low values of the parameters.

The following four-parameter-beta-distribution Fisher information components can be expressed in terms of the two-parameter: &quot;X&quot; ~ Beta(α, β) expectations of the transformed ratio ((1 − &quot;X&quot;)/&quot;X&quot;) and of its mirror image (&quot;X&quot;/(1 − &quot;X&quot;)), scaled by the range (&quot;c&quot; − &quot;a&quot;), which may be helpful for interpretation:

:formula_417
:formula_418

These are also the expected values of the &quot;inverted beta distribution&quot; or beta prime distribution (also known as beta distribution of the second kind or Pearson&#x27;s Type VI) and its mirror image, scaled by the range (&quot;c&quot; − &quot;a&quot;).

Also, the following Fisher information components can be expressed in terms of the harmonic (1/X) variances or of variances based on the ratio transformed variables ((1-X)/X) as follows:

:formula_419

See section &quot;Moments of linearly transformed, product and inverted random variables&quot; for these expectations.

The determinant of Fisher&#x27;s information matrix is of interest (for example for the calculation of Jeffreys prior probability). From the expressions for the individual components, it follows that the determinant of Fisher&#x27;s (symmetric) information matrix for the beta distribution with four parameters is:

:formula_420

Using Sylvester&#x27;s criterion (checking whether the diagonal elements are all positive), and since diagonal components formula_407 and formula_422 have singularities at α=2 and β=2 it follows that the Fisher information matrix for the four parameter case is positive-definite for α&gt;2 and β&gt;2. Since for α &gt; 2 and β &gt; 2 the beta distribution is (symmetric or unsymmetric) bell shaped, it follows that the Fisher information matrix is positive-definite only for bell-shaped (symmetric or unsymmetric) beta distributions, with inflection points located to either side of the mode. Thus, important well known distributions belonging to the four-parameter beta distribution family, like the parabolic distribution (Beta(2,2,a,c)) and the uniform distribution (Beta(1,1,a,c)) have Fisher information components (formula_423) that blow up (approach infinity) in the four-parameter case (although their Fisher information components are all defined for the two parameter case). The four-parameter Wigner semicircle distribution (Beta(3/2,3/2,&quot;a&quot;,&quot;c&quot;)) and arcsine distribution (Beta(1/2,1/2,&quot;a&quot;,&quot;c&quot;)) have negative Fisher information determinants for the four-parameter case.

===Bayesian inference===


The use of Beta distributions in Bayesian inference is due to the fact that they provide a family of conjugate prior probability distributions for binomial (including Bernoulli) and geometric distributions. The domain of the beta distribution can be viewed as a probability, and in fact the beta distribution is often used to describe the distribution of a probability value &quot;p&quot;:

:formula_424

Examples of beta distributions used as prior probabilities to represent ignorance of prior parameter values in Bayesian inference are Beta(1,1), Beta(0,0) and Beta(1/2,1/2).

====Rule of succession====

A classic application of the beta distribution is the rule of succession, introduced in the 18th century by Pierre-Simon Laplace in the course of treating the sunrise problem. It states that, given &quot;s&quot; successes in &quot;n&quot; conditionally independent Bernoulli trials with probability &quot;p,&quot; that the estimate of the expected value in the next trial is formula_425. This estimate is the expected value of the posterior distribution over &quot;p,&quot; namely Beta(&quot;s&quot;+1, &quot;n&quot;−&quot;s&quot;+1), which is given by Bayes&#x27; rule if one assumes a uniform prior probability over &quot;p&quot; (i.e., Beta(1, 1)) and then observes that &quot;p&quot; generated &quot;s&quot; successes in &quot;n&quot; trials. Laplace&#x27;s rule of succession has been criticized by prominent scientists. R. T. Cox described Laplace&#x27;s application of the rule of succession to the sunrise problem ( p. 89) as &quot;a travesty of the proper use of the principle&quot;. Keynes remarks ( Ch.XXX, p. 382) &quot;indeed this is so foolish a theorem that to entertain it is discreditable&quot;. Karl Pearson showed that the probability that the next (&quot;n&quot; + 1) trials will be successes, after n successes in n trials, is only 50%, which has been considered too low by scientists like Jeffreys and unacceptable as a representation of the scientific process of experimentation to test a proposed scientific law. As pointed out by Jeffreys ( p. 128) (crediting C. D. Broad ) Laplace&#x27;s rule of succession establishes a high probability of success ((n+1)/(n+2)) in the next trial, but only a moderate probability (50%) that a further sample (n+1) comparable in size will be equally successful. As pointed out by Perks, &quot;The rule of succession itself is hard to accept. It assigns a probability to the next trial which implies the assumption that the actual run observed is an average run and that we are always at the end of an average run. It would, one would think, be more reasonable to assume that we were in the middle of an average run. Clearly a higher value for both probabilities is necessary if they are to accord with reasonable belief.&quot; These problems with Laplace&#x27;s rule of succession motivated Haldane, Perks, Jeffreys and others to search for other forms of prior probability (see the next ). According to Jaynes, the main problem with the rule of succession is that it is not valid when s=0 or s=n (see rule of succession, for an analysis of its validity).

====Bayes–Laplace prior probability (Beta(1,1))====
The beta distribution achieves maximum differential entropy for Beta(1,1): the uniform probability density, for which all values in the domain of the distribution have equal density. This uniform distribution Beta(1,1) was suggested (&quot;with a great deal of doubt&quot;) by Thomas Bayes as the prior probability distribution to express ignorance about the correct prior distribution. This prior distribution was adopted (apparently, from his writings, with little sign of doubt) by Pierre-Simon Laplace, and hence it was also known as the &quot;Bayes–Laplace rule&quot; or the &quot;Laplace rule&quot; of &quot;inverse probability&quot; in publications of the first half of the 20th century. In the later part of the 19th century and early part of the 20th century, scientists realized that the assumption of uniform &quot;equal&quot; probability density depended on the actual functions (for example whether a linear or a logarithmic scale was most appropriate) and parametrizations used. In particular, the behavior near the ends of distributions with finite support (for example near &quot;x&quot; = 0, for a distribution with initial support at &quot;x&quot; = 0) required particular attention. Keynes ( Ch.XXX, p. 381) criticized the use of Bayes&#x27;s uniform prior probability (Beta(1,1)) that all values between zero and one are equiprobable, as follows: &quot;Thus experience, if it shows anything, shows that there is a very marked clustering of statistical ratios in the neighborhoods of zero and unity, of those for positive theories and for correlations between positive qualities in the neighborhood of zero, and of those for negative theories and for correlations between negative qualities in the neighborhood of unity. &quot;

====Haldane&#x27;s prior probability (Beta(0,0))====
The Beta(0,0) distribution was proposed by J.B.S. Haldane, who suggested that the prior probability representing complete uncertainty should be proportional to &quot;p&quot;−1(1−&quot;p&quot;)−1. The function &quot;p&quot;−1(1−&quot;p&quot;)−1 can be viewed as the limit of the numerator of the beta distribution as both shape parameters approach zero: α, β → 0. The Beta function (in the denominator of the beta distribution) approaches infinity, for both parameters approaching zero, α, β → 0. Therefore, &quot;p&quot;−1(1−&quot;p&quot;)−1 divided by the Beta function approaches a 2-point Bernoulli distribution with equal probability 1/2 at each end, at 0 and 1, and nothing in between, as α, β → 0. A coin-toss: one face of the coin being at 0 and the other face being at 1. The Haldane prior probability distribution Beta(0,0) is an &quot;improper prior&quot; because its integration (from 0 to 1) fails to strictly converge to 1 due to the singularities at each end. However, this is not an issue for computing posterior probabilities unless the sample size is very small. Furthermore, Zellner points out that on the log-odds scale, (the logit transformation ln(&quot;p&quot;/1 − &quot;p&quot;)), the Haldane prior is the uniformly flat prior. The fact that a uniform prior probability on the logit transformed variable ln(&quot;p&quot;/1 − &quot;p&quot;) (with domain (−∞, ∞)) is equivalent to the Haldane prior on the domain [0, 1] was pointed out by Harold Jeffreys in the first edition (1939) of his book Theory of Probability ( p. 123). Jeffreys writes &quot;Certainly if we take the Bayes–Laplace rule right up to the extremes we are led to results that do not correspond to anybody&#x27;s way of thinking. The (Haldane) rule d&quot;x&quot;/(&quot;x&quot;(1 − &quot;x&quot;)) goes too far the other way. It would lead to the conclusion that if a sample is of one type with respect to some property there is a probability 1 that the whole population is of that type.&quot; The fact that &quot;uniform&quot; depends on the parametrization, led Jeffreys to seek a form of prior that would be invariant under different parametrizations.

====Jeffreys&#x27; prior probability (Beta(1/2,1/2) for a Bernoulli or for a binomial distribution)====




Harold Jeffreys proposed to use an uninformative prior probability measure that should be invariant under reparameterization: proportional to the square root of the determinant of Fisher&#x27;s information matrix. For the Bernoulli distribution, this can be shown as follows: for a coin that is &quot;heads&quot; with probability &quot;p&quot; ∈ [0, 1] and is &quot;tails&quot; with probability 1 − &quot;p&quot;, for a given (H,T) ∈ {(0,1), (1,0)} the probability is &quot;pH&quot;(1 − &quot;p&quot;)&quot;T&quot;. Since &quot;T&quot; = 1 − &quot;H&quot;, the Bernoulli distribution is &quot;pH&quot;(1 − &quot;p&quot;)1 − &quot;H&quot;. Considering &quot;p&quot; as the only parameter, it follows that the log likelihood for the Bernoulli distribution is

:formula_426

The Fisher information matrix has only one component (it is a scalar, because there is only one parameter: &quot;p&quot;), therefore:

:formula_427

Similarly, for the Binomial distribution with &quot;n&quot; Bernoulli trials, it can be shown that

:formula_428

Thus, for the Bernoulli, and Binomial distributions, Jeffreys prior is proportional to formula_429, which happens to be proportional to a beta distribution with domain variable &quot;x&quot; = &quot;p&quot;, and shape parameters α = β = 1/2, the arcsine distribution:

:formula_430

It will be shown in the next section that the normalizing constant for Jeffreys prior is immaterial to the final result because the normalizing constant cancels out in Bayes theorem for the posterior probability. Hence Beta(1/2,1/2) is used as the Jeffreys prior for both Bernoulli and binomial distributions. As shown in the next section, when using this expression as a prior probability times the likelihood in Bayes theorem, the posterior probability turns out to be a beta distribution. It is important to realize, however, that Jeffreys prior is proportional to formula_429 for the Bernoulli and binomial distribution, but not for the beta distribution. Jeffreys prior for the beta distribution is given by the determinant of Fisher&#x27;s information for the beta distribution, which, as shown in the is a function of the trigamma function ψ1 of shape parameters α and β as follows:

:formula_432

As previously discussed, Jeffreys prior for the Bernoulli and binomial distributions is proportional to the arcsine distribution Beta(1/2,1/2), a one-dimensional &quot;curve&quot; that looks like a basin as a function of the parameter &quot;p&quot; of the Bernoulli and binomial distributions. The walls of the basin are formed by &quot;p&quot; approaching the singularities at the ends &quot;p&quot; → 0 and &quot;p&quot; → 1, where Beta(1/2,1/2) approaches infinity. Jeffreys prior for the beta distribution is a &quot;2-dimensional surface&quot; (embedded in a three-dimensional space) that looks like a basin with only two of its walls meeting at the corner α = β = 0 (and missing the other two walls) as a function of the shape parameters α and β of the beta distribution. The two adjoining walls of this 2-dimensional surface are formed by the shape parameters α and β approaching the singularities (of the trigamma function) at α, β → 0. It has no walls for α, β → ∞ because in this case the determinant of Fisher&#x27;s information matrix for the beta distribution approaches zero.

It will be shown in the next section that Jeffreys prior probability results in posterior probabilities (when multiplied by the binomial likelihood function) that are intermediate between the posterior probability results of the Haldane and Bayes prior probabilities.

Jeffreys prior may be difficult to obtain analytically, and for some cases it just doesn&#x27;t exist (even for simple distribution functions like the asymmetric triangular distribution). Berger, Bernardo and Sun, in a 2009 paper defined a reference prior probability distribution that (unlike Jeffreys prior) exists for the asymmetric triangular distribution. They cannot obtain a closed-form expression for their reference prior, but numerical calculations show it to be nearly perfectly fitted by the (proper) prior

:formula_433

where θ is the vertex variable for the asymmetric triangular distribution with support [0, 1] (corresponding to the following parameter values in Wikipedia&#x27;s article on the triangular distribution: vertex &quot;c&quot; = &quot;θ&quot;, left end &quot;a&quot; = 0,and right end &quot;b&quot; = 1). Berger et al. also give a heuristic argument that Beta(1/2,1/2) could indeed be the exact Berger–Bernardo–Sun reference prior for the asymmetric triangular distribution. Therefore, Beta(1/2,1/2) not only is Jeffreys prior for the Bernoulli and binomial distributions, but also seems to be the Berger–Bernardo–Sun reference prior for the asymmetric triangular distribution (for which the Jeffreys prior does not exist), a distribution used in project management and PERT analysis to describe the cost and duration of project tasks.

Clarke and Barron prove that, among continuous positive priors, Jeffreys prior (when it exists) asymptotically maximizes Shannon&#x27;s mutual information between a sample of size n and the parameter, and therefore &quot;Jeffreys prior is the most uninformative prior&quot; (measuring information as Shannon information). The proof rests on an examination of the Kullback–Leibler divergence between probability density functions for iid random variables.

====Effect of different prior probability choices on the posterior beta distribution====
If samples are drawn from the population of a random variable &quot;X&quot; that result in &quot;s&quot; successes and &quot;f&quot; failures in &quot;n&quot; Bernoulli trials &quot;n&quot; = &quot;s&quot; + &quot;f&quot;, then the likelihood function for parameters &quot;s&quot; and &quot;f&quot; given &quot;x&quot; = &quot;p&quot; (the notation &quot;x&quot; = &quot;p&quot; in the expressions below will emphasize that the domain &quot;x&quot; stands for the value of the parameter &quot;p&quot; in the binomial distribution), is the following binomial distribution:

:formula_434

If beliefs about prior probability information are reasonably well approximated by a beta distribution with parameters &quot;α&quot; Prior and &quot;β&quot; Prior, then:

:formula_435

According to Bayes&#x27; theorem for a continuous event space, the posterior probability density is given by the product of the prior probability and the likelihood function (given the evidence &quot;s&quot; and &quot;f&quot; = &quot;n&quot; − &quot;s&quot;), normalized so that the area under the curve equals one, as follows:

:formula_436

The binomial coefficient

:formula_437

appears both in the numerator and the denominator of the posterior probability, and it does not depend on the integration variable &quot;x&quot;, hence it cancels out, and it is irrelevant to the final result. Similarly the normalizing factor for the prior probability, the beta function B(αPrior,βPrior) cancels out and it is immaterial to the final result. The same posterior probability result can be obtained if one uses an un-normalized prior

:formula_438

because the normalizing factors all cancel out. Several authors (including Jeffreys himself) thus use an un-normalized prior formula since the normalization constant cancels out. The numerator of the posterior probability ends up being just the (un-normalized) product of the prior probability and the likelihood function, and the denominator is its integral from zero to one. The beta function in the denominator, B(&quot;s&quot; + &quot;α&quot; Prior, &quot;n&quot; − &quot;s&quot; + &quot;β&quot; Prior), appears as a normalization constant to ensure that the total posterior probability integrates to unity.

The ratio &quot;s&quot;/&quot;n&quot; of the number of successes to the total number of trials is a sufficient statistic in the binomial case, which is relevant for the following results.

For the Bayes&#x27; prior probability (Beta(1,1)), the posterior probability is:

:formula_439

For the Jeffreys&#x27; prior probability (Beta(1/2,1/2)), the posterior probability is:

:formula_440

and for the Haldane prior probability (Beta(0,0)), the posterior probability is:

:formula_441

From the above expressions it follows that for &quot;s&quot;/&quot;n&quot; = 1/2) all the above three prior probabilities result in the identical location for the posterior probability mean = mode = 1/2. For &quot;s&quot;/&quot;n&quot; &lt; 1/2, the mean of the posterior probabilities, using the following priors, are such that: mean for Bayes prior &gt; mean for Jeffreys prior &gt; mean for Haldane prior. For &quot;s&quot;/&quot;n&quot; &gt; 1/2 the order of these inequalities is reversed such that the Haldane prior probability results in the largest posterior mean. The &quot;Haldane&quot; prior probability Beta(0,0) results in a posterior probability density with &quot;mean&quot; (the expected value for the probability of success in the &quot;next&quot; trial) identical to the ratio &quot;s&quot;/&quot;n&quot; of the number of successes to the total number of trials. Therefore, the Haldane prior results in a posterior probability with expected value in the next trial equal to the maximum likelihood. The &quot;Bayes&quot; prior probability Beta(1,1) results in a posterior probability density with &quot;mode&quot; identical to the ratio &quot;s&quot;/&quot;n&quot; (the maximum likelihood).

In the case that 100% of the trials have been successful &quot;s&quot; = &quot;n&quot;, the &quot;Bayes&quot; prior probability Beta(1,1) results in a posterior expected value equal to the rule of succession (&quot;n&quot; + 1)/(&quot;n&quot; + 2), while the Haldane prior Beta(0,0) results in a posterior expected value of 1 (absolute certainty of success in the next trial). Jeffreys prior probability results in a posterior expected value equal to (&quot;n&quot; + 1/2)/(&quot;n&quot; + 1). Perks (p. 303) points out: &quot;This provides a new rule of succession and expresses a &#x27;reasonable&#x27; position to take up, namely, that after an unbroken run of n successes we assume a probability for the next trial equivalent to the assumption that we are about half-way through an average run, i.e. that we expect a failure once in (2&quot;n&quot; + 2) trials. The Bayes–Laplace rule implies that we are about at the end of an average run or that we expect a failure once in (&quot;n&quot; + 2) trials. The comparison clearly favours the new result (what is now called Jeffreys prior) from the point of view of &#x27;reasonableness&#x27;.&quot;

Conversely, in the case that 100% of the trials have resulted in failure (&quot;s&quot; = 0), the &quot;Bayes&quot; prior probability Beta(1,1) results in a posterior expected value for success in the next trial equal to 1/(&quot;n&quot; + 2), while the Haldane prior Beta(0,0) results in a posterior expected value of success in the next trial of 0 (absolute certainty of failure in the next trial). Jeffreys prior probability results in a posterior expected value for success in the next trial equal to (1/2)/(&quot;n&quot; + 1), which Perks (p. 303) points out: &quot;is a much more reasonably remote result than the Bayes–Laplace result 1/(&quot;n&quot; + 2)&quot;.

Jaynes questions (for the uniform prior Beta(1,1)) the use of these formulas for the cases &quot;s&quot; = 0 or &quot;s&quot; = &quot;n&quot; because the integrals do not converge (Beta(1,1) is an improper prior for &quot;s&quot; = 0 or &quot;s&quot; = &quot;n&quot;). In practice, the conditions 0 (p. 303) shows that, for what is now known as the Jeffreys prior, this probability is ((&quot;n&quot; + 1/2)/(&quot;n&quot; + 1))((&quot;n&quot; + 3/2)/(&quot;n&quot; + 2))...(2&quot;n&quot; + 1/2)/(2&quot;n&quot; + 1), which for &quot;n&quot; = 1, 2, 3 gives 15/24, 315/480, 9009/13440; rapidly approaching a limiting value of formula_442 as n tends to infinity. Perks remarks that what is now known as the Jeffreys prior: &quot;is clearly more &#x27;reasonable&#x27; than either the Bayes–Laplace result or the result on the (Haldane) alternative rule rejected by Jeffreys which gives certainty as the probability. It clearly provides a very much better correspondence with the process of induction. Whether it is &#x27;absolutely&#x27; reasonable for the purpose, i.e. whether it is yet large enough, without the absurdity of reaching unity, is a matter for others to decide. But it must be realized that the result depends on the assumption of complete indifference and absence of knowledge prior to the sampling experiment.&quot;

Following are the variances of the posterior distribution obtained with these three prior probability distributions:

for the Bayes&#x27; prior probability (Beta(1,1)), the posterior variance is:

:formula_443

for the Jeffreys&#x27; prior probability (Beta(1/2,1/2)), the posterior variance is:

: formula_444

and for the Haldane prior probability (Beta(0,0)), the posterior variance is:

:formula_445

So, as remarked by Silvey, for large &quot;n&quot;, the variance is small and hence the posterior distribution is highly concentrated, whereas the assumed prior distribution was very diffuse. This is in accord with what one would hope for, as vague prior knowledge is transformed (through Bayes theorem) into a more precise posterior knowledge by an informative experiment. For small &quot;n&quot; the Haldane Beta(0,0) prior results in the largest posterior variance while the Bayes Beta(1,1) prior results in the more concentrated posterior. Jeffreys prior Beta(1/2,1/2) results in a posterior variance in between the other two. As &quot;n&quot; increases, the variance rapidly decreases so that the posterior variance for all three priors converges to approximately the same value (approaching zero variance as &quot;n&quot; → ∞). Recalling the previous result that the &quot;Haldane&quot; prior probability Beta(0,0) results in a posterior probability density with &quot;mean&quot; (the expected value for the probability of success in the &quot;next&quot; trial) identical to the ratio s/n of the number of successes to the total number of trials, it follows from the above expression that also the &quot;Haldane&quot; prior Beta(0,0) results in a posterior with &quot;variance&quot; identical to the variance expressed in terms of the max. likelihood estimate s/n and sample size (in ):

:formula_446

with the mean &quot;μ&quot; = &quot;s&quot;/&quot;n&quot; and the sample size &quot;ν&quot; = &quot;n&quot;.

In Bayesian inference, using a prior distribution Beta(&quot;α&quot;Prior,&quot;β&quot;Prior) prior to a binomial distribution is equivalent to adding (&quot;α&quot;Prior − 1) pseudo-observations of &quot;success&quot; and (&quot;β&quot;Prior − 1) pseudo-observations of &quot;failure&quot; to the actual number of successes and failures observed, then estimating the parameter &quot;p&quot; of the binomial distribution by the proportion of successes over both real- and pseudo-observations. A uniform prior Beta(1,1) does not add (or subtract) any pseudo-observations since for Beta(1,1) it follows that (&quot;α&quot;Prior − 1) = 0 and (&quot;β&quot;Prior − 1) = 0. The Haldane prior Beta(0,0) subtracts one pseudo observation from each and Jeffreys prior Beta(1/2,1/2) subtracts 1/2 pseudo-observation of success and an equal number of failure. This subtraction has the effect of smoothing out the posterior distribution. If the proportion of successes is not 50% (&quot;s&quot;/&quot;n&quot; ≠ 1/2) values of &quot;α&quot;Prior and &quot;β&quot;Prior less than 1 (and therefore negative (&quot;α&quot;Prior − 1) and (&quot;β&quot;Prior − 1)) favor sparsity, i.e. distributions where the parameter &quot;p&quot; is closer to either 0 or 1. In effect, values of &quot;α&quot;Prior and &quot;β&quot;Prior between 0 and 1, when operating together, function as a concentration parameter.

The accompanying plots show the posterior probability density functions for sample sizes &quot;n&quot; ∈ {3,10,50}, successes &quot;s&quot; ∈ {&quot;n&quot;/2,&quot;n&quot;/4} and Beta(&quot;α&quot;Prior,&quot;β&quot;Prior) ∈ {Beta(0,0),Beta(1/2,1/2),Beta(1,1)}. Also shown are the cases for &quot;n&quot; = {4,12,40}, success &quot;s&quot; = {&quot;n&quot;/4} and Beta(&quot;α&quot;Prior,&quot;β&quot;Prior) ∈ {Beta(0,0),Beta(1/2,1/2),Beta(1,1)}. The first plot shows the symmetric cases, for successes &quot;s&quot; ∈ {n/2}, with mean = mode = 1/2 and the second plot shows the skewed cases &quot;s&quot; ∈ {&quot;n&quot;/4}. The images show that there is little difference between the priors for the posterior with sample size of 50 (characterized by a more pronounced peak near &quot;p&quot; = 1/2). Significant differences appear for very small sample sizes (in particular for the flatter distribution for the degenerate case of sample size = 3). Therefore, the skewed cases, with successes &quot;s&quot; = {&quot;n&quot;/4}, show a larger effect from the choice of prior, at small sample size, than the symmetric cases. For symmetric distributions, the Bayes prior Beta(1,1) results in the most &quot;peaky&quot; and highest posterior distributions and the Haldane prior Beta(0,0) results in the flattest and lowest peak distribution. The Jeffreys prior Beta(1/2,1/2) lies in between them. For nearly symmetric, not too skewed distributions the effect of the priors is similar. For very small sample size (in this case for a sample size of 3) and skewed distribution (in this example for &quot;s&quot; ∈ {&quot;n&quot;/4}) the Haldane prior can result in a reverse-J-shaped distribution with a singularity at the left end. However, this happens only in degenerate cases (in this example &quot;n&quot; = 3 and hence &quot;s&quot; = 3/4 &lt; 1, a degenerate value because s should be greater than unity in order for the posterior of the Haldane prior to have a mode located between the ends, and because &quot;s&quot; = 3/4 is not an integer number, hence it violates the initial assumption of a binomial distribution for the likelihood) and it is not an issue in generic cases of reasonable sample size (such that the condition 1 &lt; &quot;s&quot; &lt; &quot;n&quot; − 1, necessary for a mode to exist between both ends, is fulfilled).

In Chapter 12 (p. 385) of his book, Jaynes asserts that the &quot;Haldane prior&quot; Beta(0,0) describes a &quot;prior state of knowledge of complete ignorance&quot;, where we are not even sure whether it is physically possible for an experiment to yield either a success or a failure, while the &quot;Bayes (uniform) prior Beta(1,1) applies if&quot; one knows that &quot;both binary outcomes are possible&quot;. Jaynes states: &quot;&quot;interpret the Bayes–Laplace (Beta(1,1)) prior as describing not a state of complete ignorance&quot;, but the state of knowledge in which we have observed one success and one failure...once we have seen at least one success and one failure, then we know that the experiment is a true binary one, in the sense of physical possibility.&quot; Jaynes does not specifically discuss Jeffreys prior Beta(1/2,1/2) (Jaynes discussion of &quot;Jeffreys prior&quot; on pp. 181, 423 and on chapter 12 of Jaynes book refers instead to the improper, un-normalized, prior &quot;1/&quot;p&quot; &quot;dp&quot; introduced by Jeffreys in the 1939 edition of his book, seven years before he introduced what is now known as Jeffreys&#x27; invariant prior: the square root of the determinant of Fisher&#x27;s information matrix. &quot;1/p&quot; is Jeffreys&#x27; (1946) invariant prior for the exponential distribution, not for the Bernoulli or binomial distributions&quot;). However, it follows from the above discussion that Jeffreys Beta(1/2,1/2) prior represents a state of knowledge in between the Haldane Beta(0,0) and Bayes Beta (1,1) prior.

Similarly, Karl Pearson in his 1892 book The Grammar of Science (p. 144 of 1900 edition) maintained that the Bayes (Beta(1,1) uniform prior was not a complete ignorance prior, and that it should be used when prior information justified to &quot;distribute our ignorance equally&quot;&quot;. K. Pearson wrote: &quot;Yet the only supposition that we appear to have made is this: that, knowing nothing of nature, routine and anomy (from the Greek ανομία, namely: a- &quot;without&quot;, and nomos &quot;law&quot;) are to be considered as equally likely to occur. Now we were not really justified in making even this assumption, for it involves a knowledge that we do not possess regarding nature. We use our &quot;experience&quot; of the constitution and action of coins in general to assert that heads and tails are equally probable, but we have no right to assert before experience that, as we know nothing of nature, routine and breach are equally probable. In our ignorance we ought to consider before experience that nature may consist of all routines, all anomies (normlessness), or a mixture of the two in any proportion whatever, and that all such are equally probable. Which of these constitutions after experience is the most probable must clearly depend on what that experience has been like.&quot;

If there is sufficient sampling data, &quot;and the posterior probability mode is not located at one of the extremes of the domain&quot; (&quot;x&quot; = 0 or &quot;x&quot; = 1), the three priors of Bayes (Beta(1,1)), Jeffreys (Beta(1/2,1/2)) and Haldane (Beta(0,0)) should yield similar &quot;posterior&quot; probability densities. Otherwise, as Gelman et al. (p. 65) point out, &quot;if so few data are available that the choice of noninformative prior distribution makes a difference, one should put relevant information into the prior distribution&quot;, or as Berger (p. 125) points out &quot;when different reasonable priors yield substantially different answers, can it be right to state that there &quot;is&quot; a single answer? Would it not be better to admit that there is scientific uncertainty, with the conclusion depending on prior beliefs?.&quot;

==Occurrence and applications==

===Order statistics===

The beta distribution has an important application in the theory of order statistics. A basic result is that the distribution of the &quot;k&quot;th smallest of a sample of size &quot;n&quot; from a continuous uniform distribution has a beta distribution. This result is summarized as:

:formula_447

From this, and application of the theory related to the probability integral transform, the distribution of any individual order statistic from any continuous distribution can be derived.

===Subjective logic===
In standard logic, propositions are considered to be either true or false. In contradistinction, subjective logic assumes that humans cannot determine with absolute certainty whether a proposition about the real world is absolutely true or false. In subjective logic the posteriori probability estimates of binary events can be represented by beta distributions.

===Wavelet analysis===
A wavelet is a wave-like oscillation with an amplitude that starts out at zero, increases, and then decreases back to zero. It can typically be visualized as a &quot;brief oscillation&quot; that promptly decays. Wavelets can be used to extract information from many different kinds of data, including – but certainly not limited to – audio signals and images. Thus, wavelets are purposefully crafted to have specific properties that make them useful for signal processing. Wavelets are localized in both time and frequency whereas the standard Fourier transform is only localized in frequency. Therefore, standard Fourier Transforms are only applicable to stationary processes, while wavelets are applicable to non-stationary processes. Continuous wavelets can be constructed based on the beta distribution. Beta wavelets can be viewed as a soft variety of Haar wavelets whose shape is fine-tuned by two shape parameters α and β.

===Population genetics===

The Balding–Nichols model is a two-parameter parametrization of the beta distribution used in population genetics. It is a statistical description of the allele frequencies in the components of a sub-divided population:

:formula_448
where formula_449 and formula_450; here &quot;F&quot; is (Wright&#x27;s) genetic distance between two populations.

===Project management: task cost and schedule modeling===
The beta distribution can be used to model events which are constrained to take place within an interval defined by a minimum and maximum value. For this reason, the beta distribution — along with the triangular distribution — is used extensively in PERT, critical path method (CPM), Joint Cost Schedule Modeling (JCSM) and other project management/control systems to describe the time to completion and the cost of a task. In project management, shorthand computations are widely used to estimate the mean and standard deviation of the beta distribution:

:formula_451

where &quot;a&quot; is the minimum, &quot;c&quot; is the maximum, and &quot;b&quot; is the most likely value (the mode for &quot;α&quot; &gt; 1 and &quot;β&quot; &gt; 1).

The above estimate for the mean formula_452 is known as the PERT three-point estimation and it is exact for either of the following values of &quot;β&quot; (for arbitrary α within these ranges):

:&quot;β&quot; = &quot;α&quot; &gt; 1 (symmetric case) with standard deviation formula_453, skewness = 0, and excess kurtosis = formula_454
or

:&quot;β&quot; = 6 − &quot;α&quot; for 5 &gt; &quot;α&quot; &gt; 1 (skewed case) with standard deviation

:formula_455

skewnessformula_456, and excess kurtosisformula_457

The above estimate for the standard deviation &quot;σ&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) = (&quot;c&quot; − &quot;a&quot;)/6 is exact for either of the following values of &quot;α&quot; and &quot;β&quot;:

:&quot;α&quot; = &quot;β&quot; = 4 (symmetric) with skewness = 0, and excess kurtosis = −6/11.
:&quot;β&quot; = 6 − &quot;α&quot; and formula_458 (right-tailed, positive skew) with skewnessformula_459, and excess kurtosis = 0
:&quot;β&quot; = 6 − &quot;α&quot; and formula_460 (left-tailed, negative skew) with skewnessformula_461, and excess kurtosis = 0

Otherwise, these can be poor approximations for beta distributions with other values of α and β, exhibiting average errors of 40% in the mean and 549% in the variance.

==Random variate generation==
If &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; are independent, with formula_462 and formula_463 then

:formula_464

So one algorithm for generating beta variates is to generate formula_465, where &quot;X&quot; is a gamma variate with parameters (α, 1) and &quot;Y&quot; is an independent gamma variate with parameters (β, 1). In fact, here formula_466 and formula_467 are independent, and formula_468. If formula_469 and formula_470 is independent of formula_471 and formula_472, then formula_473 and formula_474 is independent of formula_466. This shows that the product of independent formula_476 and formula_477 random variables is a formula_478 random variable.

Also, the &quot;k&quot;th order statistic of &quot;n&quot; uniformly distributed variates is formula_479, so an alternative if α and β are small integers is to generate α + β − 1 uniform variates and choose the α-th smallest.

Another way to generate the Beta distribution is by Pólya urn model. According to this method, one start with an &quot;urn&quot; with α &quot;black&quot; balls and β &quot;white&quot; balls and draw uniformly with replacement. Every trial an additional ball is added according to the color of the last ball which was drawn. Asymptotically, the proportion of black and white balls will be distributed according to the Beta distribution, where each repetition of the experiment will produce a different value.

It is also possible to use the inverse transform sampling.

==Normal approximation to the Beta distribution==
A beta distribution formula_476 with &quot;α&quot; ~ &quot;β&quot; and &quot;α&quot; and &quot;β&quot; » 1 is approximately normal with mean 1/2 and variance 1/(4(2&quot;α&quot; + 1)). If &quot;α&quot; ≥ &quot;β&quot; the normal approximation can be improved by taking the cube-root of the logarithm of the reciprocal of formula_476

==History==
Thomas Bayes, in a posthumous paper published in 1763 by Richard Price, obtained a beta distribution as the density of the probability of success in Bernoulli trials (see ), but the paper does not analyze any of the moments of the beta distribution or discuss any of its properties.

The first systematic modern discussion of the beta distribution is probably due to Karl Pearson. In Pearson&#x27;s papers the beta distribution is couched as a solution of a differential equation: Pearson&#x27;s Type I distribution which it is essentially identical to except for arbitrary shifting and re-scaling (the beta and Pearson Type I distributions can always be equalized by proper choice of parameters). In fact, in several English books and journal articles in the few decades prior to World War II, it was common to refer to the beta distribution as Pearson&#x27;s Type I distribution. William P. Elderton in his 1906 monograph &quot;Frequency curves and correlation&quot; further analyzes the beta distribution as Pearson&#x27;s Type I distribution, including a full discussion of the method of moments for the four parameter case, and diagrams of (what Elderton describes as) U-shaped, J-shaped, twisted J-shaped, &quot;cocked-hat&quot; shapes, horizontal and angled straight-line cases. Elderton wrote &quot;I am chiefly indebted to Professor Pearson, but the indebtedness is of a kind for which it is impossible to offer formal thanks.&quot; Elderton in his 1906 monograph provides an impressive amount of information on the beta distribution, including equations for the origin of the distribution chosen to be the mode, as well as for other Pearson distributions: types I through VII. Elderton also included a number of appendixes, including one appendix (&quot;II&quot;) on the beta and gamma functions. In later editions, Elderton added equations for the origin of the distribution chosen to be the mean, and analysis of Pearson distributions VIII through XII.

As remarked by Bowman and Shenton &quot;Fisher and Pearson had a difference of opinion in the approach to (parameter) estimation, in particular relating to (Pearson&#x27;s method of) moments and (Fisher&#x27;s method of) maximum likelihood in the case of the Beta distribution.&quot; Also according to Bowman and Shenton, &quot;the case of a Type I (beta distribution) model being the center of the controversy was pure serendipity. A more difficult model of 4 parameters would have been hard to find.&quot; The long running public conflict of Fisher with Karl Pearson can be followed in a number of articles in prestigious journals. For example, concerning the estimation of the four parameters for the beta distribution, and Fisher&#x27;s criticism of Pearson&#x27;s method of moments as being arbitrary, see Pearson&#x27;s article &quot;Method of moments and method of maximum likelihood&quot; (published three years after his retirement from University College, London, where his position had been divided between Fisher and Pearson&#x27;s son Egon) in which Pearson writes &quot;I read (Koshai&#x27;s paper in the Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, 1933) which as far as I am aware is the only case at present published of the application of Professor Fisher&#x27;s method. To my astonishment that method depends on first working out the constants of the frequency curve by the (Pearson) Method of Moments and then superposing on it, by what Fisher terms &quot;the Method of Maximum Likelihood&quot; a further approximation to obtain, what he holds, he will thus get, &#x27;more efficient values&#x27; of the curve constants&quot;.

David and Edwards&#x27;s treatise on the history of statistics cites the first modern treatment of the beta distribution, in 1911, using the beta designation that has become standard, due to Corrado Gini, an Italian statistician, demographer, and sociologist, who developed the Gini coefficient. N.L.Johnson and S.Kotz, in their comprehensive and very informative monograph on leading historical personalities in statistical sciences credit Corrado Gini as &quot;an early Bayesian...who dealt with the problem of eliciting the parameters of an initial Beta distribution, by singling out techniques which anticipated the advent of the so-called empirical Bayes approach.&quot;

<text>In information security, a confused deputy is a computer program that is tricked by another program (with fewer privileges or less rights) into misusing its authority on the system. It is a specific type of privilege escalation. The confused deputy problem is often cited as an example of why capability-based security is important.

Capability systems protect against the confused deputy problem, whereas access-control list–based systems do not.

== Example ==
In the original example of a confused deputy, there was a compiler program provided on a commercial timesharing service. Users could run the compiler and optionally specify a filename where it would write debugging output, and the compiler would be able to write to that file if the user had permission to write there.

The compiler also collected statistics about language feature usage. Those statistics were stored in a file called &quot;(SYSX)STAT&quot;, in the directory &quot;SYSX&quot;. To make this possible, the compiler program was given permission to write to files in SYSX.

But there were other files in SYSX: in particular, the system&#x27;s billing information was stored in a file &quot;(SYSX)BILL&quot;. A user ran the compiler and named &quot;(SYSX)BILL&quot; as the desired debugging output file.

This produced a confused deputy problem. The compiler made a request to the operating system to open (SYSX)BILL. Even though the user did not have access to that file, the compiler did, so the open succeeded. The compiler wrote the compilation output to the file (here &quot;(SYSX)BILL&quot;) as normal, overwriting it, and the billing information was destroyed.

=== The confused deputy ===
In this example, the compiler program is the deputy because it is acting at the request of the user. The program is seen as &#x27;confused&#x27; because it was tricked into overwriting the system&#x27;s billing file.

Whenever a program tries to access a file, the operating system needs to know two things: which file the program is asking for, and whether the program has permission to access the file. In the example, the file is designated by its name, “(SYSX)BILL”. The program receives the file name from the user, but does not know whether the user had permission to write the file. When the program opens the file, the system uses the program&#x27;s permission, not the user&#x27;s. When the file name was passed from the user to the program, the permission did not go along with it; the permission was increased by the system silently and automatically.

It is not essential to the attack that the billing file be designated by a name represented as a string. The essential points are that:
* the designator for the file does not carry the full authority needed to access the file;
* the program&#x27;s own permission to access the file is used implicitly.

== Other examples ==

A cross-site request forgery (CSRF) is an example of a confused deputy attack that uses the web browser to perform sensitive actions against a web application. A common form of this attack occurs when a web application uses a cookie to authenticate all requests transmitted by a browser. Using JavaScript, an attacker can force a browser into transmitting authenticated HTTP requests.

The Samy computer worm used cross-site scripting (XSS) to turn the browser&#x27;s authenticated MySpace session into a confused deputy. Using XSS the worm forced the browser into posting an executable copy of the worm as a MySpace message which was then viewed and executed by friends of the infected user.

Clickjacking is an attack where the user acts as the confused deputy. In this attack a user thinks they are harmlessly browsing a website (an attacker-controlled website) but they are in fact tricked into performing sensitive actions on another website.

An FTP bounce attack can allow an attacker to connect indirectly to TCP ports to which the attacker&#x27;s machine has no access, using a remote FTP server as the confused deputy.

Another example relates to personal firewall software. It can restrict Internet access for specific applications. Some applications circumvent this by starting a browser with instructions to access a specific URL. The browser has authority to open a network connection, even though the application does not. Firewall software can attempt to address this by prompting the user in cases where one program starts another which then accesses the network. However, the user frequently does not have sufficient information to determine whether such an access is legitimate—false positives are common, and there is a substantial risk that even sophisticated users will become habituated to clicking &quot;OK&quot; to these prompts.

Not every program that misuses authority is a confused deputy. Sometimes misuse of authority is simply a result of a program error. The confused deputy problem occurs when the designation of an object is passed from one program to another, and the associated permission changes unintentionally, without any explicit action by either party. It is insidious because neither party did anything explicit to change the authority.

== Solutions ==
In some systems it is possible to ask the operating system to open a file using the permissions of another client. This solution has some drawbacks:
* It requires explicit attention to security by the server. A naive or careless server might not take this extra step.
* It becomes more difficult to identify the correct permission if the server is in turn the client of another service and wants to pass along access to the file.
* It requires the client to trust the server to not abuse the borrowed permissions. Note that intersecting the server and client&#x27;s permissions does not solve the problem either, because the server may then have to be given very wide permissions (all of the time, rather than those needed for a given request) in order to act for arbitrary clients.

The simplest way to solve the confused deputy problem is to bundle together the designation of an object and the permission to access that object. This is exactly what a capability is.

Using capability security in the compiler example, the client would pass to the server a capability to the output file, such as a file descriptor, rather than the name of the file. Since it lacks a capability to the billing file, it cannot designate that file for output. In the cross-site request forgery example, a URL supplied &quot;cross&quot;-site would include its own authority independent of that of the client of the web browser.

<text>Horrible Histories is a series of illustrated history books published in the United Kingdom by Scholastic, and part of the &quot;Horrible Histories&quot; franchise. The books are written by Terry Deary, Peter Hepplewhite, and Neil Tonge, and illustrated by Martin Brown, Mike Phillips, Philip Reeve, and Kate Sheppard.

The first titles in the series, &quot;The Terrible Tudors&quot; and &quot;The Awesome Egyptians&quot;, were published in June 1993. As of 2011, with more than 60 titles, the series had sold over 25 million copies in over 30 languages. The books have had tie-ins with newspapers such as &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, as well as audio-book tie-ins distributed with breakfast cereals.

==History==

=== Inspiration ===
Terry Deary&#x27;s involvement with the &quot;Horrible Histories&quot; series began with his background in drama college and subsequent work as an actor-teacher with the TIE company in Wales. He transitioned into theatre direction and playwriting for children, some of which formed the basis for the later &quot;Horrible Histories&quot; book series.

The concept for &quot;Horrible Histories&quot; emerged when Deary&#x27;s publisher introduced him to the idea. Despite concerns about his historical knowledge, given he had already authored 50 children&#x27;s novels, the publisher offered factual content to complement his humour. Deary recalled, &quot;The publishers originally asked for a joke book with a history theme. They said, &#x27;Put in a few interesting facts to break up the jokes because some of your jokes are very bad.&#x27; And when I looked at the facts, I found they were much more interesting than the jokes. So we ended up with a fact book with jokes. We created a new genre.&quot;

=== Development ===
&quot;Blitzed Brits&quot;, the fifth book in the series, coincided with the 50th anniversary of VE Day in 1995, unexpectedly reaching bestseller lists. This milestone prompted the creation of &quot;Woeful Second World War&quot; in September 1999, to provide a more balanced portrayal of the Second World War by delving into the wartime experiences of France, Poland, Germany, and Russia.

Celebrating the series&#x27; 10th anniversary in 2003, Scholastic initiated the &quot;Horrible Histories&quot;″ Brainiest Boffin competition. This saw 500 applicants answering questions and creating birthday card designs, culminating in a mock TV quiz show with Deary as the quizmaster.

&quot;Mad Millennium&quot;, commissioned by Phil Clark in 2007, marked Deary&#x27;s return to theater after 25 years. This paved the way for adaptations of his works into theatrical productions.

In 2007, the original series underwent reissuing with updated content and a refreshed visual design. Simultaneously, the live-action &quot;Horrible Histories&quot; television series emerged, leading to several books being reissued as show tie-ins. The theme &quot;20 horrible years&quot; guided the reissuing of numerous books in 2013.

By the early 2010s, Deary acknowledged the natural conclusion of the series. While the publishers did not officially terminate it, there was a prevailing sense that it was winding down. Deary&#x27;s involvement diminished, with other entities like the Birmingham Stage Company and CBBC continuing the franchise&#x27;s legacy through stage plays and the live-action television adaptation since 2009. The &quot;Horrible Histories&quot; brand extended into video games, toys, magazines, and a game show.

== Format ==

===Educational goals===
Terry Deary, the creator of the &quot;Horrible Histories&quot; series, offers a distinct perspective on education. He questions conventional schooling, asserting, &quot;If I had it my way, I wouldn&#x27;t have schools at all. They don&#x27;t educate, they just keep kids off the streets. But my books educate because they prepare kids for life ... It&#x27;s outrageous, why don&#x27;t we start telling children the truth about history? I hope my books do just that.&quot;

Beyond entertainment, Deary&#x27;s &quot;Horrible Histories&quot; books aim to deepen historical understanding. This integration of entertainment and education challenges the dichotomy between these two aspects. By adopting a skeptical approach to historical accuracy, the series prompts reflection on the reliability of historical information.

Deary&#x27;s works also contain implicit political messages. Through parallels between contemporary and historical issues, readers are encouraged to ponder morality and patriotism. Rooted in an anti-imperialist perspective, the series frames history as a struggle between powerful entities and marginalized voices. This approach stimulates discussions about present-day societal challenges in relation to historical contexts. Deary&#x27;s critique extends to conventional education methods, emphasizing critical thinking over conformity.&quot;

Deary&#x27;s persistent critique of conventional education underscores his strong anti-establishment stance. His inclination to challenge authority encourages critical thinking and fosters open discussions, aligning with his unique approach to history and empowerment. His ultimate goal is to convey the emotions and motivations of historical figures. His writing style encourages readers to immerse themselves in history, prompting reflection on the past and their own actions.

===Literary techniques===

Research is pivotal to Deary&#x27;s process. Collaborating with experts, particularly in specialized fields, lends authenticity to his narratives. He delves into historical contexts to gather a plethora of information, avoiding mundane details like dates. This approach focuses on human experiences rather than strict chronology.

Deary employs diverse literary techniques to bring history to life. His writing mirrors natural speech rhythms, incorporating elements like alliteration and assonance. Poetry is employed for impact rather than adhering to a rigid structure. Direct second-person communication fosters a personal connection between the text and the reader, creating an engaging narrative style.

Utilizing newspaper formats bridges the gap between complex historical content and relatable narratives. This approach blends tabloid-style lightness with in-depth journalism, offering readers a multifaceted perspective. Incorporating newspaper excerpts, diaries, and letters immerses readers in personal viewpoints and subjective experiences.

While Deary addresses recent historical events with sensitivity, he maintains a delicate balance between humor and respect. The series has certain boundaries, such as avoiding descriptions of violence against infants, but Deary advocates for open dialogue rather than avoidance.

The series caters to &#x27;reluctant readers,&#x27; favoring concise, non-linear reading experiences. Deary accommodates this preference with brief chapters, interactive elements, and multimedia features such as quizzes.

==Publication history==

The &quot;Horrible Histories&quot; series, comprising 23 books, has seen various editions and translations since its inception.

===English===
The original &quot;Horrible Histories&quot; book series encompasses 23 titles. It commenced with the publication of &quot;The Terrible Tudors&quot; and &quot;The Awesome Egyptians&quot; in 1993 and 1994 respectively. The series extends to encompass two-in-one volumes, boxed sets, special editions, handbooks, city guides, comic strips, annuals, novelty releases, and more.

In 2013, Terry Deary formally announced the conclusion of the series. Reports indicated that the decision stemmed from Deary exhausting his story ideas and the associated risk of launching new titles without guarantees of success.

===Translations===
&quot;Horrible Histories&quot; has achieved international presence through translations, reaching readers in diverse languages and cultures.

In Denmark, the series is distributed by Egmont Publishing.

In Poland, the series goes by the names &quot;Strrraszna historia&quot; (&quot;Horrible Histories&quot;), &quot;Strrraszne sławy&quot; (&quot;Horribly Famous&quot;), and &quot;Sławy z krypty&quot; (&quot;Dead Famous&quot;). An additional sub-series delves into various aspects of Polish history and society, authored by Małgorzata Fabianowska and Małgorzata Nesteruk, with illustrations by Jędrzej Łaniecki. These titles are exclusive to Poland and have yet to be published in English. Examples include:

* &quot;Ci Sprytni Słowianie&quot; (&quot;The Clever Slavs&quot;)
* &quot;Pokrętni Piastowie&quot; (&quot;Piast Dynasty&quot;)
* &quot;Dynamiczna Dynastia Jagiellonów&quot; (&quot;Dynamic Jagiellon Dynasty&quot;)
* &quot;Sakramencki Sarmatyzm&quot; (&quot;Bloody Sarmatism&quot;)
* &quot;Atrakcyjni Królowie Elekcyjni&quot; (&quot;Sovereign Election Appeal&quot;)
* &quot;Zagmatwane Zabory&quot; (&quot;Invasive Embroilment&quot;)
* &quot;Nieznośna Niepodległość&quot; (&quot;Vexing Independence&quot;)

In Portugal, the series is titled &quot;Os Horríveis&quot; (&quot;The Horribles&quot;), while in Brazil, it goes by &quot;Saber Horrível&quot; (&quot;Horrible Knowledge&quot;). These adaptations aim to stimulate interest in history, geography, science, and other academic subjects. The collection has experienced considerable commercial success.

The Czech version, known as &quot;Děsivé dějiny&quot; (&quot;Horrible History&quot;), not only translates the English content but also includes adaptations of the Polish sub-series. This version incorporates titles specific to Czech history, authored by individuals such as Roman Ferstl and Martin Pitro.

In Germany, the series is published under the title &quot;Schauderhafte Geschichten&quot;.

The Dutch series, &quot;Waanzinnig om te weten&quot; (&quot;Amazing to Know&quot;), is a translation and adaptation of the &quot;Horrible Histories&quot;, &quot;Horrible Science&quot;, &quot;Horrible Geography&quot;, and &quot;Murderous Maths&quot; series. It consists of 36 books as of January 2009.

The series has also been translated into Thai and Spanish. In the Welsh edition, &quot;Cut-Throat Celts&quot; is known as &quot;Y Celtiaid Cythryblus&quot;.

In Italy, the series is known as &quot;Brutte Storie&quot; (title that can both mean &quot;Horrible Histories&quot; and &quot;Horrible Stories&quot;), and have been published since 1997.

==Critical reception==
The &quot;Horrible Histories&quot; series has garnered widespread acclaim and positive reception from various sources. It is lauded for its ability to engage young readers and make history captivating. The series is hailed for its presentation, which combines historical accuracy with humor and multimedia elements, successfully targeting young audiences. Janet Allen highlights the series&#x27; effectiveness in conveying extensive historical information through a variety of engaging formats such as cartoons, graphs, narration, letters, and wanted posters. The incorporation of diverse media like recipes, quizzes, and newspaper extracts, as well as the use of comic strips, is notably praised. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; even hailed Terry Deary as &quot;the most influential historian in Britain today.&quot;

The series&#x27; humor has been recognized as a significant factor in its success, alongside its adept storytelling. Notably, the series is praised for transforming historical non-fiction into an enjoyable reading experience for young individuals, pioneering a new genre. Jerome De Groot&#x27;s &quot;Consuming History&quot; highlights &quot;Horrible Histories&quot; as a series that showcases the dynamic and flexible nature of historical narratives in children&#x27;s literature. The books&#x27; playful and irreverent tone, coupled with their tactile approach to history, is celebrated for its appeal to young audiences. The inclusion of re-printable recipes and interactive &quot;what would you do?&quot; sections enhances the series&#x27; interactivity. Groot compares the series to Glenn Thompson&#x27;s &quot;For Beginners&quot; comic books from the 1980s. The series is commended for its effective use of illustration and textual interplay, contributing to its engaging nature. While the series&#x27; personalized writing style and visual components can hinder their effectiveness as read-aloud books, they are well-suited for independent reading. &quot;Consuming History&quot; suggests that the series&#x27; popularity stems from its tone and style rather than its content.

Judy Arnall, discussing the portrayal of violence in games and historical contexts, points out that children often encounter much more disturbing events in real-life scenarios than those depicted in the series. She cites &quot;The Wicked History of the World&quot; as providing valuable context for understanding this perspective.

===Controversy===

&quot;Horrible Histories&quot; has faced some controversies. The book &quot;Bloody Scotland&quot; drew criticism from the Scottish Separatist Group, who claimed it presented a &quot;UK centric, anti-Scottish viewpoint of Scottish history.&quot; The group highlighted a haggis recipe in the book that humorously referenced cooking the dish until it resembled a flattened hedgehog after lorries had run over it. The group reported their concerns to the Commission for Racial Equality, although their claim was rejected.

&quot;Cruel Kings and Mean Queens&quot; faced backlash from the National Trust due to its humorous portrayal of Prince Charles, the trust&#x27;s patron, and Queen Elizabeth II. The book &quot;Slimy Stuarts&quot; has also been criticized for allegedly presenting anti-Catholic views.

In the series, there are two books titled &quot;The Horrible History of the World&quot; and &quot;The Wicked History of the World&quot;. However, these books are identical, differing only in their headings. This confusion was further compounded by the planned release of compact and mini editions at the end of 2007. Similar instances occurred with books like &quot;The Horribly Huge Quiz Book&quot;/&quot;Massive Millennium Quiz Book&quot;, and &quot;The Mad Millennium&quot;/&quot;Mad Millennium Play&quot;. Additionally, multiple covers were created for &quot;Horrible Christmas&quot;, along with new paperback, compact, and mini editions.

Some of the information presented in the series is contested. For instance, the books claim that Shakespeare fabricated the malicious deeds attributed to Richard III and portray Caligula as insane. These inaccuracies are addressed in the song &quot;It&#x27;s Not True&quot; featured in the CBBC TV series. While &quot;Promoting Reading for Pleasure in the Primary School&quot; asserts that the series offers substantial depth in its subject matter, some critics argue that the books are providing alternate readings of history deliberately. The series challenges the conventional narratives.

The book &quot;Woeful Second World War&quot; is the only one in Polish edition of the series to include afterword from the translator Małgorzata Fabianowska, pointing out several inaccuracies written by Deary in the original version. The afterword disputes several of Deary&#x27;s claims, including that Kresy (lost by Poland after Soviet invasion of 1939) belonged to the USSR 20 years prior, Auschwitz concentration camp only supplied IG-Farben with forced labour, or that British broke the Enigma machine. Inaccuracies regarding Siege of Leningrad or Polish cavalry charges myth are also pointed out.

The series also questions the authority of teachers. For example, sections like &#x27;Test Your Teacher&#x27; humorously assert that teachers don&#x27;t know everything and imply that formal education may provide a sanitized version of history, omitting intriguing aspects. This has led to the argument that histories that lack sensational events are deemed uninteresting to younger readers. The use of non-linear structures in the books has raised concerns about potentially promoting shorter attention spans compared to longer narratives.

===Awards and nominations===

In probability theory and statistics, the gamma distribution is a versatile two-parameter family of continuous probability distributions. The exponential distribution, Erlang distribution, and chi-squared distribution are special cases of the gamma distribution. There are two equivalent parameterizations in common use:
# With a shape parameter and a scale parameter 
# With a shape parameter formula_22 and a rate parameter 
In each of these forms, both parameters are positive real numbers.

The distribution has important applications in various fields, including econometrics, Bayesian statistics, life testing. In econometrics, the (&quot;α&quot;, &quot;θ&quot;) parameterization is common for modeling waiting times, such as the time until death, where it often takes the form of an Erlang distribution for integer &quot;α&quot; values. Bayesian statisticians prefer the (&quot;α&quot;,&quot;λ&quot;) parameterization, utilizing the gamma distribution as a conjugate prior for several inverse scale parameters, facilitating analytical tractability in posterior distribution computations. The probability density and cumulative distribution functions of the gamma distribution vary based on the chosen parameterization, both offering insights into the behavior of gamma-distributed random variables. The gamma distribution is integral to modeling a range of phenomena due to its flexible shape, which can capture various statistical distributions, including the exponential and chi-squared distributions under specific conditions. Its mathematical properties, such as mean, variance, skewness, and higher moments, provide a toolset for statistical analysis and inference. Practical applications of the distribution span several disciplines, underscoring its importance in theoretical and applied statistics.

The gamma distribution is the maximum entropy probability distribution (both with respect to a uniform base measure and a formula_23 base measure) for a random variable for which is fixed and greater than zero, and is fixed ( is the digamma function).

== Definitions ==
The parameterization with and appears to be more common in econometrics and other applied fields, where the gamma distribution is frequently used to model waiting times. For instance, in life testing, the waiting time until death is a random variable that is frequently modeled with a gamma distribution. See Hogg and Craig for an explicit motivation.

The parameterization with and is more common in Bayesian statistics, where the gamma distribution is used as a conjugate prior distribution for various types of inverse scale (rate) parameters, such as the of an exponential distribution or a Poisson distribution – or for that matter, the of the gamma distribution itself. The closely related inverse-gamma distribution is used as a conjugate prior for scale parameters, such as the variance of a normal distribution.

If is a positive integer, then the distribution represents an Erlang distribution; i.e., the sum of independent exponentially distributed random variables, each of which has a mean of .

=== Characterization using shape &quot;α&quot; and rate &quot;λ&quot; ===
The gamma distribution can be parameterized in terms of a shape parameter and an inverse scale parameter , called a rate parameter. A random variable that is gamma-distributed with shape and rate is denoted

formula_24

The corresponding probability density function in the shape-rate parameterization is

formula_25

where formula_26 is the gamma function.
For all positive integers, formula_27.

The cumulative distribution function is the regularized gamma function:

formula_28

where formula_29 is the lower incomplete gamma function.

If is a positive integer (i.e., the distribution is an Erlang distribution), the cumulative distribution function has the following series expansion:

formula_30

=== Characterization using shape &quot;α&quot; and scale &quot;θ&quot; ===
A random variable that is gamma-distributed with shape and scale is denoted by

formula_31

The probability density function using the shape-scale parametrization is

formula_32

Here is the gamma function evaluated at .

The cumulative distribution function is the regularized gamma function:

formula_33

where formula_34 is the lower incomplete gamma function.

It can also be expressed as follows, if is a positive integer (i.e., the distribution is an Erlang distribution):

formula_35

Both parametrizations are common because either can be more convenient depending on the situation.

== Properties ==

=== Mean and variance ===
The mean of gamma distribution is given by the product of its shape and scale parameters:
formula_36
The variance is:
formula_37
The square root of the inverse shape parameter gives the coefficient of variation:
formula_38

=== Skewness ===
The skewness of the gamma distribution only depends on its shape parameter, , and it is equal to formula_39

=== Higher moments ===

The -th raw moment is given by:
formula_40

===Median approximations and bounds===
Unlike the mode and the mean, which have readily calculable formulas based on the parameters, the median does not have a closed-form equation. The median for this distribution is the value formula_41 such that
formula_42

A rigorous treatment of the problem of determining an asymptotic expansion and bounds for the median of the gamma distribution was handled first by Chen and Rubin, who proved that (for formula_43)
formula_44
where formula_45 is the mean and formula_46 is the median of the formula_47 distribution. For other values of the scale parameter, the mean scales to formula_48, and the median bounds and approximations would be similarly scaled by .

K. P. Choi found the first five terms in a Laurent series asymptotic approximation of the median by comparing the median to Ramanujan&#x27;s formula_49 function. Berg and Pedersen found more terms:
formula_50

Partial sums of these series are good approximations for high enough ; they are not plotted in the figure, which is focused on the low- region that is less well approximated.

Berg and Pedersen also proved many properties of the median, showing that it is a convex function of , and that the asymptotic behavior near formula_51 is formula_52 (where is the Euler–Mascheroni constant), and that for all formula_53 the median is bounded by formula_54.

A closer linear upper bound, for formula_55 only, was provided in 2021 by Gaunt and Merkle, relying on the Berg and Pedersen result that the slope of formula_46 is everywhere less than 1:
formula_57 for formula_55 (with equality at formula_59)
which can be extended to a bound for all formula_53 by taking the max with the chord shown in the figure, since the median was proved convex.

An approximation to the median that is asymptotically accurate at high and reasonable down to formula_61 or a bit lower follows from the Wilson–Hilferty transformation:
formula_62
which goes negative for formula_63.

In 2021, Lyon proposed several approximations of the form formula_64. He conjectured values of and for which this approximation is an asymptotically tight upper or lower bound for all formula_53. In particular, he proposed these closed-form bounds, which he proved in 2023:

formula_66 is a lower bound, asymptotically tight as formula_67
formula_68 is an upper bound, asymptotically tight as formula_69

Lyon also showed (informally in 2021, rigorously in 2023) two other lower bounds that are not closed-form expressions, including this one involving the gamma function, based on solving the integral expression substituting 1 for formula_70:
formula_71 (approaching equality as formula_72)
and the tangent line at formula_59 where the derivative was found to be formula_74:
formula_75 (with equality at formula_76)
formula_77
where Ei is the exponential integral.

Additionally, he showed that interpolations between bounds could provide excellent approximations or tighter bounds to the median, including an approximation that is exact at formula_59 (where formula_79) and has a maximum relative error less than 0.6%. Interpolated approximations and bounds are all of the form

and the tightest upper bound has
formula_86
The interpolated bounds are plotted (mostly inside the yellow region) in the log–log plot shown. Even tighter bounds are available using different interpolating functions, but not usually with closed-form parameters like these.

Indeed, we know that if is an exponential r.v. with rate , then is an exponential r.v. with rate ; the same thing is valid with Gamma variates (and this can be checked using the moment-generating function, see, e.g.,these notes, 10.4-(ii)): multiplication by a positive constant divides the rate (or, equivalently, multiplies the scale).

===Exponential family===
The gamma distribution is a two-parameter exponential family with natural parameters and (equivalently, and ), and natural statistics and .

If the shape parameter is held fixed, the resulting one-parameter family of distributions is a natural exponential family.

This can be derived using the exponential family formula for the moment generating function of the sufficient statistic, because one of the sufficient statistics of the gamma distribution is .

===Compound gamma===
If the shape parameter of the gamma distribution is known, but the inverse-scale parameter is unknown, then a gamma distribution for the inverse scale forms a conjugate prior. The compound distribution, which results from integrating out the inverse scale, has a closed-form solution known as the compound gamma distribution.

If, instead, the shape parameter is known but the mean is unknown, with the prior of the mean being given by another gamma distribution, then it results in K-distribution.

==Statistical inference==

===Parameter estimation===

====Maximum likelihood estimation====
The likelihood function for iid observations is

formula_139

from which we calculate the log-likelihood function

formula_140

Finding the maximum with respect to by taking the derivative and setting it equal to zero yields the maximum likelihood estimator of the parameter, which equals the sample mean formula_141 divided by the shape parameter :

formula_142

Substituting this into the log-likelihood function gives

formula_143

We need at least two samples: formula_144, because for formula_145, the function formula_146 increases without bounds as formula_147. For formula_148, it can be verified that formula_146 is strictly concave, by using inequality properties of the polygamma function. Finding the maximum with respect to by taking the derivative and setting it equal to zero yields

formula_150

where is the digamma function and formula_151 is the sample mean of . There is no closed-form solution for . The function is numerically very well behaved, so if a numerical solution is desired, it can be found using, for example, Newton&#x27;s method. An initial value of can be found either using the method of moments, or using the approximation

formula_152

If we let

formula_153

then is approximately

formula_154

which is within 1.5% of the correct value. An explicit form for the Newton–Raphson update of this initial guess is:

formula_155

At the maximum-likelihood estimate formula_156, the expected values for and formula_157 agree with the empirical averages:
formula_158

=====Caveat for small shape parameter=====
For data, formula_159, that is represented in a floating point format that underflows to 0 for values smaller than formula_160, the logarithms that are needed for the maximum-likelihood estimate will cause failure if there are any underflows. If we assume the data was generated by a gamma distribution with cdf formula_161, then the probability that there is at least one underflow is:
formula_162
This probability will approach 1 for small and large . For example, at formula_163, formula_164 and formula_165, formula_166. A workaround is to instead have the data in logarithmic format.

In order to test an implementation of a maximum-likelihood estimator that takes logarithmic data as input, it is useful to be able to generate non-underflowing logarithms of random gamma variates, when formula_167. Following the implementation in codice_1, this can be done as follows: sample formula_168 and formula_169 independently. Then the required logarithmic sample is formula_170, so that formula_171.

==== Closed-form estimators ====

There exist consistent closed-form estimators of and that are derived from the likelihood of the generalized gamma distribution.

The estimate for the shape is

formula_172

and the estimate for the scale is

formula_173

Using the sample mean of , the sample mean of , and the sample mean of the product simplifies the expressions to:

formula_174
formula_175

If the rate parameterization is used, the estimate of formula_176.

These estimators are not strictly maximum likelihood estimators, but are instead referred to as mixed type log-moment estimators. They have however similar efficiency as the maximum likelihood estimators.

Although these estimators are consistent, they have a small bias. A bias-corrected variant of the estimator for the scale is

formula_177

A bias correction for the shape parameter is given as

formula_178

====Bayesian minimum mean squared error====
With known and unknown , the posterior density function for theta (using the standard scale-invariant prior for ) is

formula_179

Denoting

formula_180

Integration with respect to can be carried out using a change of variables, revealing that is gamma-distributed with parameters , .

formula_181

The moments can be computed by taking the ratio ( by )

formula_182

which shows that the mean ± standard deviation estimate of the posterior distribution for is

formula_183

===Bayesian inference===

====Conjugate prior====
In Bayesian inference, the gamma distribution is the conjugate prior to many likelihood distributions: the Poisson, exponential, normal (with known mean), Pareto, gamma with known shape , inverse gamma with known shape parameter, and Gompertz with known scale parameter. 

The gamma distribution&#x27;s conjugate prior is:

formula_184

where is the normalizing constant with no closed-form solution.
The posterior distribution can be found by updating the parameters as follows:

formula_185

where is the number of observations, and is the -th observation.

== Occurrence and applications ==
Consider a sequence of events, with the waiting time for each event being an exponential distribution with rate . Then the waiting time for the -th event to occur is the gamma distribution with integer shape formula_186. This construction of the gamma distribution allows it to model a wide variety of phenomena where several sub-events, each taking time with exponential distribution, must happen in sequence for a major event to occur. Examples include the waiting time of cell-division events, number of compensatory mutations for a given mutation, waiting time until a repair is necessary for a hydraulic system, and so on.

In biophysics, the dwell time between steps of a molecular motor like ATP synthase is nearly exponential at constant ATP concentration, revealing that each step of the motor takes a single ATP hydrolysis. If there were n ATP hydrolysis events, then it would be a gamma distribution with degree n.

The gamma distribution has been used to model the size of insurance claims and rainfalls. This means that aggregate insurance claims and the amount of rainfall accumulated in a reservoir are modelled by a gamma process – much like the exponential distribution generates a Poisson process.

The gamma distribution is also used to model errors in multi-level Poisson regression models because a mixture of Poisson distributions with gamma-distributed rates has a known closed form distribution, called negative binomial.

In wireless communication, the gamma distribution is used to model the multi-path fading of signal power; see also Rayleigh distribution and Rician distribution.

In oncology, the age distribution of cancer incidence often follows the gamma distribution, wherein the shape and scale parameters predict, respectively, the number of driver events and the time interval between them.

In neuroscience, the gamma distribution is often used to describe the distribution of inter-spike intervals.

In bacterial gene expression where protein production can occur in bursts, the copy number of a given protein often follows the gamma distribution, where the shape and scale parameters are, respectively, the mean number of bursts per cell cycle and the mean number of protein molecules produced per burst.

In genomics, the gamma distribution was applied in peak calling step (i.e., in recognition of signal) in ChIP-chip and ChIP-seq data analysis.

In Bayesian statistics, the gamma distribution is widely used as a conjugate prior. It is the conjugate prior for the precision (i.e. inverse of the variance) of a normal distribution. It is also the conjugate prior for the exponential distribution.

In phylogenetics, the gamma distribution is the most commonly used approach to model among-sites rate variation when maximum likelihood, Bayesian, or distance matrix methods are used to estimate phylogenetic trees. Phylogenetic analyzes that use the gamma distribution to model rate variation estimate a single parameter from the data because they limit consideration to distributions where . This parameterization means that the mean of this distribution is 1 and the variance is . Maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods typically use a discrete approximation to the continuous gamma distribution.

==Random variate generation==
Given the scaling property above, it is enough to generate gamma variables with , as we can later convert to any value of with a simple division.

Suppose we wish to generate random variables from , where n is a non-negative integer and . Using the fact that a distribution is the same as an distribution, and noting the method of generating exponential variables, we conclude that if is uniformly distributed on (0, 1], then is distributed (i.e. inverse transform sampling). Now, using the &quot;-addition&quot; property of gamma distribution, we expand this result:

formula_187

where are all uniformly distributed on (0, 1] and independent. All that is left now is to generate a variable distributed as for and apply the &quot;-addition&quot; property once more. This is the most difficult part.

Random generation of gamma variates is discussed in detail by Devroye, noting that none are uniformly fast for all shape parameters. For small values of the shape parameter, the algorithms are often not valid. For arbitrary values of the shape parameter, one can apply the Ahrens and Dieter modified acceptance-rejection method Algorithm GD (shape ), or transformation method when . Also see Cheng and Feast Algorithm GKM 3 or Marsaglia&#x27;s squeeze method.

The following is a version of the Ahrens-Dieter acceptance–rejection method:

# Generate , and as iid uniform (0, 1] variates.
# If formula_188 then formula_189 and formula_190. Otherwise, formula_191 and formula_192.
# If formula_193 then go to step 1.
# is distributed as .

A summary of this is
formula_194
where formula_195 is the integer part of , is generated via the algorithm above with (the fractional part of ) and the are all independent.

While the above approach is technically correct, Devroye notes that it is linear in the value of and generally is not a good choice. Instead, he recommends using either rejection-based or table-based methods, depending on context.

For example, Marsaglia&#x27;s simple transformation-rejection method relying on one normal variate and one uniform variate :

# Set formula_196 and formula_197.
# Set formula_198.
# If formula_199 and formula_200 return formula_201, else go back to step 2.

With formula_202 generates a gamma distributed random number in time that is approximately constant with . The acceptance rate does depend on , with an acceptance rate of 0.95, 0.98, and 0.99 for &quot;α&quot; = 1, 2, and 4. For , one can use formula_203 to boost to be usable with this method.

In Matlab numbers can be generated using the function gamrnd(), which uses the &quot;α&quot;, &quot;θ&quot; representation.

<text>Sinope is a retrograde irregular satellite of Jupiter discovered by Seth Barnes Nicholson at Lick Observatory in 1914, and is named after Sinope of Greek mythology.

Sinope did not receive its present name until 1975; before then, it was simply known as . It was sometimes called &quot;Hades&quot; between 1955 and 1975.

==Orbit==

Sinope orbits Jupiter on a high-eccentricity and high-inclination retrograde orbit. Its orbit is continuously changing due to solar and planetary perturbations. Sinope is believed to belong to the Pasiphae group of retrograde irregular moons. However, given its mean inclination and different colour, Sinope could be also an independent object, captured independently, unrelated to the collision and break-up at the origin of the group. The diagram illustrates Sinope&#x27;s orbital elements in relation to other satellites of the group.

Sinope is also known to be in a secular resonance with Jupiter, similar to Pasiphae. However, Sinope can drop out of this resonance and has periods of both resonant and non-resonant behaviour in time scales of 107 years.

==Physical characteristics==

From measurements of its thermal emission, Sinope has an estimated diameter of . Sinope is pale red in color (colour indices V=18.63 B−V=0.84, R−V=0.46), and it falls under the light red color-class, comparable to P-type asteroids and D-type asteroids. This sets it apart from Pasiphae, which is closer to C-type asteroids.

Sinope&#x27;s infrared spectrum is similar to those of D-type asteroids but different from that of Pasiphae. These dissimilarities of the physical parameters suggest a different origin from the core members of the group.

<doc id="207082" wikidata="Q3018948" url="?curid=207082" title="David Wark">
<text>David Wark, (February 19, 1804 – August 20, 1905) Irish-born, was a prominent Canadian Senator who served nearly 38 years in office.

He represented Kent County in the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick from 1843 to 1850. In 1847, he introduced a resolution calling for free trade among the British North American colonies and was, therefore, among the first to seek the closer relations among the colonies that eventually led, 20 years later, to Confederation.

Wark was named to the Legislative Council in 1850 and served until Confederation. He served in the province&#x27;s Executive Council as a minister without portfolio from 1858 to 1862 and as Receiver General from 1866 to 1867.

Wark was named Senator by a Royal Proclamation in 1867. Known as the &quot;Grand Old Man of the Canadian Senate&quot;, he served until his death at the age of 101. At the time of his demise, Wark was the longest lived legislator in the world; he was later surpassed by another Canadian Senator, Georges-Casimir Dessaulles, who died in 1930 at the age of 102.

==Family background==

David Wark&#x27;s family originated in Scotland, but his forebears emigrated to Ireland in the early 17th century as part of an organized colonization known as the Plantation of Ulster. His father was a farmer near Derry and David Wark was born there on February 19, 1804. He received his elementary education in Derry schools before pursuing more advanced studies under the supervision of the resident Presbyterian clergyman.

==Emigration and business career==

In 1825, at the age of 21, Wark emigrated to eastern New Brunswick&#x27;s Richibucto, Rexton area where he worked as a bookkeeper for local merchants and for six years, taught their children. By 1836, he had saved enough money to buy his own general store and later, he began a successful, 40-year career in the lumber business. His long public service career began when he was appointed county magistrate and then, a judge in the Court of Common Pleas.

==Political career==

In 1842, Wark was elected to the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick as a Liberal. He was re-elected in 1846. In 1850, he was appointed to the upper house or Legislative Council of New Brunswick where he served for 16 years. During that time, he was appointed to the cabinet or Executive Council of New Brunswick as Minister Without Portfolio (1858-1862) and Receiver General (1866-1867).

When New Brunswick joined Confederation in 1867, Wark was appointed to the Senate of Canada. He sat in the senate for 37 years, nine months and 28 days until his death in 1905. During his time there, he served continuously as a member of the powerful standing committee on banking, commerce and railways which became the standing committee on banking and commerce in 1875.

By 1871, he had earned enough money to retire from business pursuits and move to Fredericton.

<doc id="207083" wikidata="Q189336" url="?curid=207083" title="Brazilian jiu-jitsu">
<text>Brazilian jiu-jitsu ( ), often abbreviated to BJJ, is a self-defense system, martial art, and combat sport based on grappling, ground fighting, and submission holds. It is primarily a ground-based fighting style and focuses on taking one&#x27;s opponent down to the ground, gaining a dominant position, and using a number of techniques to force them into submission via joint locks, chokeholds, or compression locks.

Brazilian jiu-jitsu was first developed around 1925 by Brazilian brothers Carlos, Oswaldo, Gastão Jr., and Hélio Gracie, after Carlos was taught Kodokan judo by a travelling Japanese judoka, Mitsuyo Maeda, in 1917. Later on the Gracie family developed their own self-defense system which they named &quot;Gracie Jiu-Jitsu&quot;. BJJ eventually came to be its own defined combat sport through the innovations, practices, and adaptation of Gracie jiu-jitsu and judo, and has become one of the essential martial arts for modern MMA.

BJJ revolves around the concept that a smaller, weaker person can successfully defend themselves against a bigger, stronger opponent by using leverage and weight distribution, taking the fight to the ground and using a number of holds and submissions to defeat them. Sparring, commonly referred to as &quot;rolling&quot; within the BJJ community, and live drilling plays a major role in the practitioner&#x27;s development. In contrast to some other martial arts BJJ can be practiced both using a gi uniform or not which is known as &#x27;no-gi BJJ&#x27;, for this purpose rash guards are used. The International Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Federation (IBJJF) is the main governing body of the martial art, establishing the rules and general guidelines, as well as promoting competitions and training of referees. BJJ can also be used as a method of promoting physical fitness, building character, and as a way of life.

== Principle ==

While grappling such as judo or wrestling mainly uses upperbody strenghth to hold and throw or subdue the opponent, this is a martial art that uses the legs to wrap around the opponent. The opponent is subdued by wrapping the legs around the neck, shoulders, torso, hips, thighs. By applying weight, push, pull, or rotate, mainly from leg wrapping with some upperbody strength.

Since the core of Jiu-Jitsu is leg wrapping, when you meet an opponent who has trained Jiu-Jitsu and also want to compete them in a grappling way, firstly subdue one of your opponent&#x27;s legs to prevent him wrapping his leg, it will make them difficult to exert force.

Also, since the goal of Jiu-Jitsu is to create a so-called 2 on 1 situations where you use your own two arms to subdue others one arm or wrap the opponent&#x27;s entire body with your legs, it is better to prevent such situations in advance.

In the case where an opponent had already his legs wrapped around your torso, which is a common situation in Jiu-Jitsu, it is easy to escape by applying force to one side of the opponent&#x27;s hip. If an opponent approaches you while sitting, it is good to push them away from either side as if rolling a ball.

== History ==
=== Origins ===
Mitsuyo Maeda, one of the Kodokan&#x27;s top judo black belts trained by Tomita Tsunejirō, the first student of judo&#x27;s founder Kano Jigoro, was sent overseas to demonstrate and spread his art to the world. He left Japan in 1904 and visited several countries giving demonstrations and accepting challenges from wrestlers, boxers, savate fighters, and various other martial artists, and arrived in Brazil on 14 November 1914.

=== Maeda &amp; Gracie ===
Gastão Gracie was a business partner of the &quot;American Circus&quot; in Belém. In 1916, Italian Argentine circus Queirolo Brothers staged shows there and presented Maeda.

In 1917 Gastão&#x27;s eldest son Carlos Gracie watched a demonstration of ‘Kano jiu-jitsu’ (judo&#x27;s common name at the time) by Maeda at the Da Paz Theatre and decided he wanted to learn. Maeda accepted him as a pupil at his school overseen by Jacintho Ferro. Gracie&#x27;s account of the events is that his younger sibling Hélio Gracie gradually developed Gracie jiu-jitsu as a softer, pragmatic adaptation that focused more on the ground fighting and leverages aspect of jiu-jitsu/judo (ne-waza) rather than the throws, as he was unable to perform many judo throws, due to his size, that required direct opposition to an opponent&#x27;s strength.

Although the Gracie family is typically recognized as the main family to first promote Brazilian jiu-jitsu as it is known today, there was also another prominent lineage derived from Maeda via another Brazilian disciple, Luiz França. This lineage had been represented particularly by Oswaldo Fadda. Fadda and his students were famous for defeating the Gracies in a gym battle and by the influential use of footlocks, the lineage still survives through Fadda&#x27;s links in teams such as Nova União and Grappling Fight Team. Besides França&#x27;s and Fadda&#x27;s lineage, there are four other main BJJ branches in Brazil: Gracie Humaitá, Gracie Barra, Carlson Gracie Jiu-Jitsu, and Alliance Jiu Jitsu. Each branch traces its roots back to Mitsuyo Maeda.

=== Name ===
The name &quot;jiu-jitsu&quot; derives from an older romanization of its original spelling in the West; the modern Hepburn romanization of is &quot;jūjutsu&quot;.

When Maeda left Japan, judo was still often referred to as &quot;Kano jiu-jitsu&quot;, or, even more generically, simply as &quot;jiu-jitsu&quot;. Higashi, the co-author of &quot;The Complete Kano Jiu-Jitsu (Judo)&quot; wrote in the foreword:
Outside Japan, however, this distinction was noted even less. Thus, when Maeda and Satake arrived in Brazil in 1914, every newspaper announced their art as being &quot;jiu-jitsu&quot;, despite both men being Kodokan judoka.

It was not until 1925 that the Japanese government itself officially mandated that the correct name for the martial art taught in the Japanese public schools should be &quot;judo&quot; rather than &quot;jujutsu&quot;. In Brazil, the art is still called &quot;jiu-jitsu&quot;. When the Gracies went to the United States and spread jiu-jitsu, they used the terms &quot;Gracie jiu-jitsu&quot; and non-Gracies using the term &quot;Brazilian jiu-jitsu&quot; to differentiate from the already present styles using similar-sounding names. In a 1994 interview with Yoshinori Nishi, Hélio Gracie said that he did not even know the word &quot;judo&quot; itself until the sport came in the 1950s to Brazil, because he heard that Mitsuyo Maeda called his style &quot;jiu-jitsu&quot;.

The art is sometimes referred to as Gracie jiu-jitsu (GJJ), a name trademarked by Rorion Gracie, but after a legal dispute with his cousin Carley Gracie, his trademark to the name was voided. Other members of the Gracie family often call their style by personalized names, such as Ceaser Gracie Jiu-Jitsu or Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu, and similarly, the Machado family call their style Machado Jiu-Jitsu (MJJ). While each style and its instructors have their own unique aspects, they are all basic variations of Brazilian jiu-jitsu.

Brazilian jiu-jitsu shares many techniques with the original Kodokan judo, especially certain styles practiced before judo became part of the Olympics such as Kosen judo, and still practiced to a lesser extent, as well as with the earlier &quot;ryu&quot; school of jujutsu. Because of this some practitioners have suggested that Brazilian jiu-jitsu should just be called &quot;jiu-jitsu&quot;.

=== Divergence from Kodokan Judo and Jujutsu ===
Certain changes were made to the rules of judo after it was introduced to Brazil. Some of these rule changes sought to enhance it as a spectator sport, and to improve safety. Several of these rule changes de-emphasized the groundwork aspects of judo, and others have reduced the range of joint locks application. Brazilian jiu-jitsu since its inception did not strictly follow kodokan judo rules, this divergence helped BJJ develop a distinct identity becoming a groundwork and submission focus fighting style. This difference was later consolidated with the creation of a new set of rules that guide BJJ practice today.

Even though BJJ uses and allows many of the techniques found in judo and jujutsu, the evolution of these techniques in BJJ has followed a distinct path, giving primary emphasis to ground fighting positions and maneuvers, and having the guard as the central working point of the fight. This is reflected on how different fighting techniques are scored in competition. In BJJ positions such as the rear mount receive a higher score, and the focus of the fight is to establish a dominant position against the adversary on the ground and submit them using chokeholds or joint locks. By contrast in judo, throwing techniques are scored higher and can give a direct victory if executed correctly, the goal of the fight is to sweep or throw the opponent to the ground to win.

BJJ also allows heelhooks and knee-reaping which are prohibited in judo, and any takedowns used in wrestling, sambo, or other grappling arts, including direct attempts to take down by touching the legs or dragging the opponent to the ground. Spinal locks and cervical locks are not allowed in gi jiu-jitsu, amateur MMA, multiple forms of no-gi jiu-jitsu, Judo, and other martial arts, due to potential to cause serious bodily injury. BJJ also has become more &quot;sports-oriented&quot; in recent years, prohibiting techniques such as slams. Another divergence of BJJ from judo and jujutsu is that the first allows no-gi practice and competition, with its own subset of rules. Use of holds and takedowns from wrestling and other grappling styles is common in no-gi BJJ, and strikes may also be used when the competition rules permit, such as the open palm strike in CJJ (Combat jiu-jitsu).

=== Prominence ===
In 1972, Carlos Gracie moved to the United States to teach jiu-jitsu, and in 1978 was followed by Rorion Gracie, who co-founded the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) in 1993. Jiu-jitsu came to international prominence in martial arts circles when Brazilian jiu-jitsu expert Royce Gracie won the first, second and fourth Ultimate Fighting Championships, which at the time were single elimination martial arts tournaments. Royce fought successfully against several larger opponents proficient in other fighting styles, including boxing, shootfighting, Muay Thai, karate, wrestling, and taekwondo. BJJ has since become an elementary aspect of MMA, revealing the importance of ground fighting in a fight. Sport BJJ tournaments continue to grow in popularity and have given rise to no-gi submission grappling tournaments, such as the ADCC Submission Wrestling World Championship and NAGA, the North American Grappling Association. Sport BJJ has also become a popular method of fitness around the world in recent years.

== Style of fighting ==

Brazilian jiu-jitsu focuses on getting an opponent to the ground in order to neutralize possible strength or size advantages through ground fighting techniques and submission holds involving joint-locks and chokeholds. On the ground, physical strength can be offset or enhanced through proper grappling techniques.

BJJ employs a wide range of takedown techniques to bring an opponent to the ground such as &quot;pulling guard&quot;, which is not used in other combat sports such as judo or wrestling. Once the opponent is on the ground, a number of manoeuvres (and counter-manoeuvres) are available to manipulate the opponent into a suitable position for the application of a submission technique. Achieving a dominant position on the ground is one of the hallmarks of BJJ, which includes effective use of the guard position to defend oneself from bottom (using both submissions and sweeps, with sweeps leading to the possibility of dominant position or an opportunity to pass the guard), and passing the guard to dominate from top position with side control, mount, and back mount positions. This system of manoeuvring and manipulation can be likened to a form of kinetic or physical chess when executed by two experienced practitioners. A submission hold in BJJ is often likened to the equivalent of &quot;checkmate&quot;, where the opponent is left with no other option but to tap, be injured, or choked.

Renzo Gracie wrote in his book &quot;Mastering JUJITSU&quot;:

The book details Maeda&#x27;s theory as arguing that physical combat could be broken down into distinct phases, such as the striking phase, the grappling phase, the ground phase, etc. Thus, it was a smart fighter&#x27;s task to keep the fight located in the phase of combat best suited to his own strengths. Renzo Gracie stated that this was a fundamental influence of the Gracie approach to combat. These strategies were further developed over time by the Gracie family, among others, and became prominent in contemporary MMA.

=== Training methods ===

As BJJ focuses on submissions, sparring and live drilling (&quot;rolling&quot;) become the most essential part of the training regime. This type of training allows practitioners to practice at full speed and with full strength, resembling the effort made in a competition. Training methods include drills in which techniques are practiced against a non-resisting and resisting partners; isolation sparring (commonly referred to as positional drilling) where only a certain technique or sets of techniques are used; and full sparring where each practitioner tries to submit their opponent through technique. Physical conditioning is also an important aspect of training.

The Gracie family lineage descended from Helio Gracie focuses on practical applications of BJJ that apply primarily to self-defense. They will often run development drills in which a person is surrounded by a circle of other students who will attempt to attack the defending student, who in turn must defend themselves using techniques.

=== Etiquette &amp; Customs ===
Brazilian jiu-jitsu gyms typically follow a set of ground rules to instill trust, respect, and cleanliness amongst students. Common practices include:
* Taking shoes off before stepping on the mat.
* Bowing before and after stepping on the mat.
* Lining up in rank order before and after class.
* Teaching or explaining techniques to lower ranked students.
* Addressing the teacher as coach or professor.
* Keeping your gi closed with a belt.
* Bowing or shaking hands before and after sparring.
* Covering any cuts with tape or gauze.
* Having good hygiene practices including brushing teeth, having a clean gi, and wearing deodorant.

== Primary ground positions ==

Once on the ground, the BJJ practitioner strives to take a dominant or controlling position from where to apply submissions. These positions provide different submission or transition options.

=== Side control ===

In side control, the practitioner pins his opponent to the ground from the side of their torso. The top grappler lies across the opponent with weight applied to the opponent&#x27;s chest. The opponent may be further controlled by pressure on either side of the shoulders and hips from the practitioner&#x27;s elbows, shoulders, and knees. A wide variety of submissions can be initiated from side control. It is also referred to as the side mount and &quot;cem quilos&quot; (a hundred kilograms) in Brazilian Portuguese. Additionally, the typical side mount increases opportunity for the top grappler to advance to other dominant positions. This position is often used in MMA as it allows the top fighter to strike whilst overcoming their opponents defense. There are many variants of the side control position, including kesa gatame, standard side control, reverse side control, and other positions.

=== Knee on belly position ===
The knee on belly position is a modified side pin that is distinctly separated from the side control position. The knee on belly position is characterized primarily by the control of the opponent with one leg out for base and balance and the other leg positioned across the opponent&#x27;s torso pinning them to the ground. This form of pin is a mobile pin rather than a static pin and is considered a more dominant position in many grappling formats. The knee on belly position is worth additional points because it provides a greater striking platform than traditional side control and is closer to achieving the more ideal mounted position.

=== Full mount ===

In the mount (or full mount) position, the practitioner sits astride the opponent&#x27;s front torso or chest, controlling the opponent with his bodyweight and hips. In the strongest form of this position, the practitioner works his knees into the opponent&#x27;s armpits to reduce arm movements and ability to move or counter submission attempts. Full Mount can be used to apply a variety of submissions including armlocks or chokes.

=== Back mount ===

When taking the back mount position (often known in Brazilian jiu-jitsu as the &quot;back grab&quot; or &quot;attacking the back&quot;), the practitioner attaches to the back of the opponent by wrapping his legs around and hooking the opponent&#x27;s thighs with their heel, or locking in a body triangle by crossing one shin across the waist like a belt then placing the back of the opposing knee over the instep as if finishing a triangle choke. Simultaneously, the upper body is controlled by wrapping the arms around the chest or neck of the opponent. This position is often used to apply chokeholds, as well as arm bars and triangles, and neutralizes an opponent&#x27;s potential size or strength advantage.

=== North south position ===
The North South position occurs when a practitioner is lying on their back on the ground and their opponent is lying on top, with the head over the chest area and controlling the bottom practitioner&#x27;s arms. As with most top controlling positions in BJJ, the top practitioner applies pressure by bringing their hips downwards towards the ground, generating what is referred to as &quot;dead weight&quot;. There are several submissions and transitions that are possible from the North South position, most commonly the North South choke, North South kimura, and others.

=== Guards ===

When in the &quot;Guard&quot; position, the practitioner is on their back controlling an opponent with his legs. The bottom practitioner pushes and pulls with the legs or feet to unbalance and limit the movements of his opponent. This position allows practitioners a wide variety of counter-attacks from the bottom position, including submissions and sweeps.

The three most common types of guards include the Closed Guard, Half Guard, and Open Guard.

In closed guard, the bottom grappler has his legs around the opponent&#x27;s hips, with ankles closed together to control their opponent. The closed guard can be an effective position. This guard allows many setups for submissions such as joint locks and chokes, as well as sweeps. In the open guard, the legs are not hooked together and the bottom grappler uses his legs or feet to push or pull their opponent.

There are many variations of open guard with distinct names and positioning including the Butterfly Guard, De La Riva Guard, X-Guard, K-Guard, Rubber guard, Spider Guard, Octopus Guard, Lapel Guard, Worm Guard (made popular by Keenan Cornelius) and others. Butterfly guard is when the bottom grappler brings his legs up and feet together against the inner thighs of top opponent. The name is derived from the resulting butterfly wing shape. Butterfly guard increases both space to maneuver and the ability to counter the opponent with the shins or arches of the feet against the competitor&#x27;s inner thighs. Spider guard is when the bottom grappler puts one or two of his feet on his opponents arms, this guard is effective at keeping control on the bottom and can be used to set up sweeps or submissions.

In the half guard, one of the top grappler&#x27;s legs is controlled by the bottom grappler&#x27;s legs, preventing the top opponent from passing side control or full mount positions. There is also a variant of half guard called &quot;50/50 guard&quot;, which consist of each opponent usually in sitting positions with one of their legs hooking the same leg of their opponent in a mirrored fashion. This position is called 50/50 because neither opponent has a distinct advantage, where both sides have the same possibilities of sweeps and attacks.

Another variation of the half guard position is the &quot;deep half guard&quot;, which involves the bottom grappler positioning themselves underneath their opponent, grabbing the top grappler&#x27;s thigh. This gives the individual on the bottom the opportunity to sweep their opponent, and end up on a more dominant, top position. This position was popularized by American BJJ Black Belt, Jeff Glover.

The De La Riva Guard (DLR) is an open guard technique in Brazilian jiu-jitsu, named after the competitor Ricardo De La Riva. While not an entirely new concept in grappling, as it had origins in nonatei style judo credited to Oda Tsunetane, it gained prominence through De La Riva&#x27;s use. In Brazilian jiu-jitsu, the DLR Guard is identified when a competitor lies on their back, controlling their opponent with open legs. This position is defined by one leg hooking outside the opponent&#x27;s leg (e.g., the guard player&#x27;s left leg hooking the passer&#x27;s right leg), thereby compromising the passer&#x27;s balance. This outside hook is what distinguishes the DLR Guard from other open guards. The De La Riva Guard is pivotal in modern jiu-jitsu, serving as a foundation for many advanced guard techniques developed since its introduction.

== Submissions ==
The majority of submission holds can be grouped into two broad categories: joint locks and chokes. Joint locks typically involve isolating an opponent&#x27;s limb and creating a lever with the body position, which will force the joint to move past its normal range of motion. Pressure is increased in a controlled manner and released if the opponent cannot escape the hold and signals defeat by tapping. A choke hold can disrupt the blood supply to the brain and cause unconsciousness if the opponent does not tap when required.

=== Compression locks ===
&quot;See also&quot; Compression lock

A less common type of submission hold is a compression lock, where the muscle of an opponent is compressed against a hard, large bone (commonly the shin or wrist), causing significant pain to the opponent. These types of locks are not usually allowed in competition due to the high risk of tearing muscle tissue. This type of lock also often hyper-extends the joint in the opposite direction, pulling it apart. Some compression locks include the Achilles lock, Biceps slicer, and Leg slicer (or Calf slicer).

=== Joint locks ===
While many joint locks are permitted in BJJ, most competitions ban or restrict some or all joint locks that involve the knees, ankles, and spine. The reason for this is that the angles of manipulation required to cause pain are nearly the same as those that would cause serious injury. Joint locks that require a twisting motion of the knee (such as heel hooks) are usually banned in gi competitions because successfully completing the move can frequently result in permanent damage, often requiring surgery. Similarly, joint manipulations of the spine are typically barred due to the inherent danger of crushing or misaligning cervical vertebrae. Leglocks are allowed in varying degrees depending on skill level, with the most prominent BJJ tournaments typically allowing only the straight ankle lock and muscle stretching submissions such as the &quot;banana split&quot; from white through purple belt, with the kneebar, toehold, and calf slicer submissions being permitted at brown and black belt. Heel hooks and knee-reaping are illegal in gi BJJ, since they are considered to be exceptionally dangerous techniques, but are allowed by IBJJF rules in no-gi competitions. Most joint locks involving the wrist, elbow, shoulder or ankle are permitted as there is a great deal more flexibility in those joints and those locks are usually safe.

Joint locks include armbars, kimuras, Americanas, straight-arm lock, omoplata, marceloplata, banana split (or electric chair), twister, wrist lock, heel hook, toehold, kneebar, straight ankle lock, and others.

=== Chokes ===

Chokes are common forms of submission. In BJJ, the chokes that are used put pressure on the carotid arteries, and may also apply pressure to the nerve baroreceptors in the neck. This kind of choke is very fast acting (if done properly) with victims typically losing consciousness in around 3–5 seconds. In contrast, an air choke (involving constriction of the windpipe) can take up to two minutes, depending on how long the person can hold their breath, and may cause serious damage to the throat.

Chokes include rear-naked choke, bow and arrow choke, triangle, Guillotine choke, sleeve choke (or Ezekiel choke), cross collar choke (or X choke), baseball choke, Clock choke, D&#x27;Arce choke, Anaconda choke, Arm triangle choke, north–south choke, crucifix choke, gogoplata, loop choke, lapel half nelson choke, and others.

== Uniform ==

The Brazilian jiu-jitsu practitioner&#x27;s uniform is commonly referred to as &quot;gi&quot; or &quot;kimono&quot; is similar to a judogi, but with slight differences in the dimensions and often made of lighter material with tighter cuffs on the pants and jacket. This allows the practitioner to benefit from a closer fit, providing less material for an opponent to manipulate. Traditionally, to be promoted in Brazilian jiu-jitsu, the wearing of the jiu-jitsu gi while training is a requirement. Recently with the growing popularity of &quot;no-gi&quot; Brazilian jiu-jitsu has the practice of giving out belts to no-gi practitioners (e.g., Rolles Gracie awarding Rashad Evans a black belt) has become more common.

There are certain differences between gi jiu-jitsu and &quot;no-gi&quot; jiu-jitsu. In gi jiu-jitsu one can grip an opponent&#x27;s uniform, using it to submit or advance position. There are a number of submissions that are specific to the gi, such as the &quot;Loop choke&quot;, &quot;Collar choke&quot;, and others. A specific set of rules to guide no-gi competitions is issued by the IBJJF, but there may be variation in the set of rules applied in each competition. By IBJJF rules uniform grips are not permitted in &quot;no-gi&quot; jiu-jitsu. BJJ athletes who practice no-gi usually wear a rash guard and MMA shorts or Spats.

== Grading ==



The Brazilian jiu-jitsu ranking system awards a practitioner different coloured belts to signify increasing levels of technical knowledge and practical skill. While the system&#x27;s structure shares its origins with the judo ranking system and the origins of all coloured belts, it now contains many of its own unique aspects and themes. Some of these differences are relatively minor, such as the division between youth and adult belts and the stripe/degree system. Others are quite distinct and have become synonymous with the art, such as a higher degree of informality in promotional criteria, a focus on competitive demonstration of skill, and a conservative approach to promotion in general.

Traditionally, the concept of competitive skill demonstration as a quickened and earned route of promotion holds true. Some schools have placed a green belt for adults between the white and blue belt ranks due to the long periods between advancement. In addition, the use of a grey belt has been instituted for many children&#x27;s programs to signal progress between the white and yellow belt rankings.

A black belt in Brazilian jiu-jitsu commonly takes more than several years to earn, and the rank is generally considered expert level. The amount of time it takes to achieve the rank of black belt varies between the practitioner. Some notable individuals who had previous backgrounds in other martial arts have been promoted directly to black belt rank without going through any intermediate rank, though this has fallen out of favour in recent times. Others have achieved the rank in relatively short time frames. Outside of exceptions such as these, the average time frame is around 10 years with a consistent training schedule. However, Ryron Gracie (grandson/grandnephew of founders Hélio and Carlos Gracie) has stated that the average of 10–12 years is longer than necessary, suggesting that the ego of the practitioner often hinders progress, and advancement to black belt should take about 7 years.
== Federations ==
Since its inception Brazilian jiu-jitsu has had different registered federations and tournaments. The first jiu-jitsu federation was the Jiu-Jitsu Federation of Guanabara, which has remained a regional federation of Rio de Janeiro, while many others were founded. Among the most prestigious of the many federations are the Sport Jiu Jitsu International Federation (SJJIF), a nonprofit organization with federations and tournaments around the globe with the mission of making jiu-jitsu an Olympic sport. The International Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Federation, a for-profit organization that hosts a number of tournaments and JJGF, founded by Rickson Gracie, which has focus on both BJJ as self-defense and as a sport.

== Weight classes ==

The weight classes for BJJ competitions can differ depending on the organisation that is promoting the event. The IBJJF weight classes are the most commonly used, under the IBJJF rules, the weight classes vary by age, sex and competition type (Gi vs Nogi).

== Tournaments ==
While there are numerous local and regional tournaments administered regularly by private individuals and academies, there are two major entities in jiu-jitsu circles. First, is the Sport Jiu Jitsu International Federation (SJJIF), a (nonprofit) organization with international federations and tournaments. Second, is the International Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Federation (IBJJF), a for-profit company that hosts a number of major tournaments worldwide. These include the Pan American Championship, European Championship, and the Mundials. California, New York, and Texas are the three states in the US which host tournaments most frequently. Other promotions within North America, such as Battleground Grappling Championship, American Grappling Federation (AGF), North American BJJ Federation (NABJJF), and North American Grappling Association (NAGA) host tournaments nationwide, but visit these states multiple times within a tournament season.

Another tournament to spring from the founding Gracie lineage is the Gracie Nationals or Gracie Worlds. Founded in 2007 by Rose Gracie, daughter of Ultimate Fighting Championship creator and Brazilian jiu-jitsu grandmaster Rorion Gracie. Gracie Nationals/Worlds followed the guidelines of other major tournaments of the time, implementing a points systems

In 2012, the Gracie Worlds introduced a new submission-only format, removing certain judging systems that many interpreted as an outdated scoring system. Rose spoke about this change when she said, &quot;Today&#x27;s tournaments aren&#x27;t what my grandfather [Helio Gracie] envisioned. There&#x27;s so many rules that it takes away from the actual art of jiu-jitsu. We don&#x27;t see many submissions. We see cheating, we see decisions made by a referee. We need to stand together against this and support a submission only kind of revolution.&quot; Cheating in jiu-jitsu, Rose said, comes in many forms. &quot;[A competitor] will earn a point, then hold for the entire match so they can win with that one little advantage they got at the start,&quot; Rose said. &quot;That&#x27;s not jiu-jitsu. That&#x27;s cheating.&quot; Mark McDonnell from Gracie Botany agrees.

This discontent with points-based and advantage-style competition has been echoed throughout the jiu-jitsu community, leading to many prominent submission-only style events. At these events, the winner of a match is determined only by submission, and these tournaments at times have no time limit, or are timed with a result of double disqualification if there is no submission victory. This form of tournament have yet to become widespread, but is gaining in popularity especially amongst MMA competitors. Metamoris, a grappling competition event run by Rose&#x27;s brother Ralek Gracie, has helped advocate this tournament form. Another notable example of a submission-only format is the EBI Eddie Bravo Invitational, which was the first televised event of its kind, and is now being featured on UFC Fight Pass. Other submission-only events have cropped up all over the world including TUFF invitational, Polaris Pro Grappling based in the United Kingdom, Submission Underground backed by longtime MMA star Chael Sonnen, and the QUINTET promotion, devised by Japanese MMA legend Kazushi Sakuraba and based around teams of five players each representing a different gym or background.

At tournaments, especially those hosted by the International Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Federation (IBJJF), some athletes engage in a practice called &quot;closing out&quot;. This occurs when two athletes, usually friends or members of the same team, meet in a match but refuse to fight. Tournament organizers can minimize the chance of close-outs by placing athletes from the same team on opposite sides of the bracket, a practice which makes the finals the only match in which they could possibly meet (assuming each team has no more than two competitors in a given bracket). When two athletes close out a match, they agree which one of them will technically forfeit to the other. As this most often occurs in the final matches of tournaments, this usually means deciding which of the two will win the gold medal and which will win the silver. Notable examples of closing out include Marcus &quot;Buchecha&quot; Almeida forfeiting the finals of the Absolute division at the 2018 IBJJF World Championship to his friend Leandro Lo, who had suffered a shoulder injury during a previous match, and frequent close outs between the brothers Paulo and Joao Miyao, who often compete in the same weight division.
Proponents of close-outs claim it fosters team unity and allows competitors to train as hard and as freely as they can with their teammates. They say that facing a teammate in a competition would make them hold back in training. Critics of the practice say it diminishes audience enjoyment of tournaments where it is allowed, and some tournaments, notably the ADCC, ban it.

== Health considerations ==
=== Safety ===
Brazilian jiu-jitsu is one of the safest full contact martial arts. Its injury rate is around 9~39 per 1000 athlete exposures. This is lower than in mixed martial arts (236~286 per 1000), boxing (210~420 per 1000), judo (25~131 per 1000) and taekwondo (21~140 per 1000). It is similar to wrestling, which also uses grappling instead of striking. The few injuries that may be incurred in Brazilian jiu-jitsu usually affect the joints and rarely the head. The most common injuries Brazilian jiu-jitsu practitioners suffer from are ACL tears, rotator cuff tears in the shoulders, and spinal disc herniations, most commonly in the neck region. Many are repairable via surgery that require an extended rehab period before the athlete can return to BJJ training. Also many athletes suffer from minor injuries, such as elbow, finger, and wrist tendonitis, due to overtraining and the grappling nature of the martial art, which can be strenuous and taxing for the joints and the tendons.

=== Skin health ===
Besides the normal strains and pulls associated with most martial arts, Brazilian jiu-jitsu practitioners (along with wrestlers, judoka, and other grapplers) are exposed to regular skin abrasions and potential unsanitary mat conditions. They are thus at higher risk for developing skin disease. Several commonly contracted skin diseases include ringworm, impetigo, herpes gladiatorum, and staph infection. Proper hygiene practices, including regular cleaning of classroom mats, showering immediately after class with soap, disinfecting and covering any open wounds, thorough cleaning of any gi/rashguard/headgear used before the next class, not sharing used towels/uniforms, and using a barrier cream greatly reduces the chance of contracting a disease.

=== Cauliflower ear ===
Due to the use of the head to maintain position and attack in jiu-jitsu, the ears can easily be damaged and begin to swell. Without immediate medical treatment, the cartilage in a swollen ear will separate from the perichondrium that supplies its nutrients and will become permanently swollen/deformed (cauliflower ear). Wrestling headgear is sometimes used for the prevention of this condition. Treatment includes draining the hematoma or surgery.

=== Performance-enhancing drugs ===
The practice of taking performance-enhancing drugs, including anabolic steroids, is believed to be relatively commonplace among competitors in jiu-jitsu tournaments and has sparked letters and public statements by some of jiu-jitsu&#x27;s top competitors, including Rodrigo Medeiros and Caio Terra. In response, the IBJJF began testing for performance-enhancing drugs at IBJJF sponsored events, starting with the 2013 Pan American Championship. However, most other tournaments tend to lack PED testing.

=== Cervical and spinal lock &quot;neck cranks&quot; ===
A spinal lock is a multiple joint lock applied to the spinal column, which is performed by forcing the spine beyond its normal ranges of motion. This is typically done by bending or twisting the head or upper body into abnormal positions. Commonly, spinal locks might strain the spinal musculature or result in a mild spinal sprain, while a forcefully and/or suddenly applied spinal lock may cause severe ligament damage or damage to the vertebrae, and possibly result in serious spinal cord injury, strokes, or death. Spinal locks and cervical locks are forbidden in gi jiu-jitsu, amateur MMA, multiple forms of no-gi jiu-jitsu, Judo, and other martial arts due to its illegal nature and express purpose to cause serious, irrevocable bodily injury, paralysis, and death. The forceful application of chokes such as the Rear Naked Choke and subsequent cranking of the neck whilst being choked can potentially lead to arterial dissection, which could lead to stroke. Due care should be exercised when applying these chokes in sparring situations.

=== Elbow injuries ===
Elbow injuries commonly occur from arm bars, Kimuras, and takedowns with a fall on outstretched hand (FOOSH). These injuries include LCL sprain [of elbow], MCL sprain [of elbow], anterior sprain of distal biceps tendon, elbow dislocation, and posterior tenderness at olecranon.

=== Knee injuries ===
Knee injuries occur from passing guard, takedowns, sweeps, direct pressure, and various stress with flexed knee. These injuries include LCL sprain [of knee], MCL sprain [of knee], and lateral meniscus tear.

=== Foot and ankle injuries ===
Foot and ankle injuries occur from pushing forward, takedowns, and footlocks. These injuries include ankle ATFL sprain, turf toe, and hyper flexion sprain of great toe.

=== Finger injuries ===
Finger injuries occur from getting caught in the gi, applying arm bars, and blocking opponents. These injuries include sprains, dislocations, and fractures.

=== Shoulder injuries ===
Shoulder injuries occur from Kimuras, takedowns with a fall on outstretched hand (FOOSH), and pushing opponents. These injuries include acromioclavicular separation, anterior dislocation, and anterior subluxation (partial dislocation).

=== Neck injuries ===
Neck injuries can occur from triangle chokes and resisting them. These injuries include cervical strains.

=== Rehab ===
Depending on the severity, many injuries require evaluation by a professional, usually a primary care provider, sports medicine physician, orthopedic surgeon, or physical therapist. Other injuries may be treated with a home exercise program.
