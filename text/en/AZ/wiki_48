*February 7 – Gustave Flaubert&#x27;s pioneering realist novel &quot;Madame Bovary&quot; is acquitted (but censured) on charges of offending morals and religion from its 1856 expurgated serialization. It is published complete in book form in April by Michel Lévy Frères in Paris.
*February 15 – The play &quot;Demetrius&quot;, left unfinished at Schiller&#x27;s death in 1805, is premiered at the Hoftheater in Weimar.

*May 5 – American publisher Moses Phillips hosts a dinner for Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr., James Russell Lowell and other literary notables at the Parker House Hotel, Boston, Massachusetts, to agree on launching &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot;, &quot;a magazine of literature, art, and politics&quot;, on November 1 with Lowell as first editor.
*June 25 – Charles Baudelaire&#x27;s collection of poems &quot;Les Fleurs du mal&quot; is published in Paris. He will be convicted and six of the most decadent poems suppressed on charges of offending morals and religion.

*September – Obscene Publications Act 1857 is passed in the United Kingdom, making the sale of obscene material a statutory offence (although it gives no definition of obscenity).

*&quot;unknown dates&quot; – George Eliot&#x27;s &quot;Scenes of Clerical Life&quot; are published as a serial in &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Edinburgh Magazine&quot; through the year, as her first work of fiction and the first use of her pseudonym.

<text>Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music &amp; Art and Performing Arts, often referred to simply as LaGuardia or &quot;LaG&quot;, is a public high school specializing in teaching visual arts and performing arts, near Lincoln Center in the Lincoln Square neighborhood of the Upper West Side in Manhattan, New York City. Situated at 100 Amsterdam Avenue between West 64th and 65th Streets, the school is operated by the New York City Department of Education, and resulted from the merger of the High School of Music &amp; Art and the School of Performing Arts. The school has a dual mission of arts and academics, preparing students for a career in the arts or conservatory study as well as a pursuit of higher education. 

The school is the only one of New York City&#x27;s nine specialized high schools to receive special funding from the New York State Legislature through the Hecht-Calandra Act, as well as the only specialized high school that does not use the Specialized High Schools Admissions Test (SHSAT) as admissions criteria.

The school in 2019–2020 had 3,011 students and 164 staff members, with a teacher–student ratio of 1:20.

==History==
The High School of Music &amp; Art was founded by Mayor Fiorello H. LaGuardia in 1936. He wanted to establish a public school in which students could hone their talents in music, art and the performing arts. In 1948, a similar institution – the High School of Performing Arts – was created in an effort to harness students&#x27; talents in dance. The schools merged on paper in 1961 and were to be combined in one building. However, this took many years.

In 1984, the schools moved to a new concrete building, designed by Argentine architect Eduardo Catalano and adjacent to Lincoln Center. The Board of education honored Mayor LaGuardia posthumously by naming the new building after him. Prior to the building&#x27;s completion in 1985, Music &amp; Art – colloquially known as &quot;The Castle on the Hill&quot; – was located in Manhattan at Convent Avenue and 135th Street in what has since become part of City College of New York&#x27;s South Campus; the building is home to A. Philip Randolph Campus High School. Performing Arts was located in Midtown Manhattan on West 46th Street. Mayor La Guardia regarded Music &amp; Art as the &quot;most hopeful accomplishment&quot; of his long administration as mayor.

Alumni from LaGuardia and its two legacy schools, High School of Music and Art and School of Performing Arts, are active in supporting the students and the school through scholarships and support for special programs, school events, and reunions held at the school and throughout the world. The school&#x27;s alumni organization has a full-time executive director and offices at the school. It functions as an independent charitable organization organized under the laws of New York. The school is the top-ranked performing arts high school in NYC.

==Academic curriculum==
Students at LaGuardia take a full academic course load while participating in conservatory-style arts concentration. Each student majors in one studio, choosing from either Dance, Drama, Art, Vocal Music, Instrumental Music, or Technical Theater.

Students can take honors classes by choice or programming. LaGuardia also offers several Advanced Placement courses.

==Studio curriculum==
The school presents an annual musical. The Musical Theater class, an elective school-wide course, is offered through the collaboration of faculty members from Music, Drama, Dance, and the Tech Theater Studios, culminating in a major musical theater performance. Recent productions have included &quot;Gypsy&quot;, &quot;Les Misérables&quot;, &quot;West Side Story&quot;, &quot;Hair&quot;, &quot;Ragtime&quot;, &quot;Hairspray&quot;, &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot;, &quot;Sweet Charity&quot;, &quot;Grease&quot;, &quot;In the Heights&quot;, &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;, and Cinderella.

===Art===
For the first two years of education, the art department stresses traditional artistic skills and discipline. Students work on drawing from observation, learning color theory, and the principles of design. Following this, students elect vocationally oriented courses in the fine arts such as Digital Media, Architecture, Painting, Sculpture, Fashion Design, and Photography. In their senior year, art majors can submit portfolios to the department for consideration for a place in the senior galleries, which are a series of shows organized and constructed by the chosen students and a student curator.

===Music===
The music department has two symphony orchestras, five choirs, four string ensembles, two concert bands, two jazz bands, a chamber group, a gospel choir, a show choir, and an opera company with a pit orchestra. Vocal and instrumental students study in a conservatory curriculum featuring three hours of music per day, including performing ensembles, electives (in areas such as music technology and composition), music theory and history. The department has worked with composers and organizations such as Eric Whitacre, Josh Groban, Arturo O&#x27;Farrill, Béla Fleck and NPR&#x27;s &quot;Radiolab&quot;.

====Instrumental programs====
Every student in the instrumental department must join a performing ensemble as well as a class specific to their instrument&#x27;s musicological classification (one of three winds ensembles, three string orchestras or a percussion corp). After completing their first year with an ensemble, students may fulfill the remainder of performance credits with electives.
*The LaGuardia Symphony Orchestra (&quot;Junior Orchestra&quot;) was formed with the goal of exposing students to more complex and professional repertoire.
*The LaGuardia Philharmonic (&quot;Senior Orchestra&quot;) accepts students through a secondary audition process. It is one of LaGuardia&#x27;s best known ensembles.
*Junior Jazz teaches elementary jazz performance and theory.
*Senior Jazz is the school&#x27;s jazz band.
*Chamber Ensemble
*Symphonic Winds (&quot;Junior Band&quot;) was formed as an alternative to the orchestral program, exposing wind, brass and percussion students to repertoire that features their instruments.
*Winds Symphony (&quot;Senior Band&quot;) also necessitates a secondary audition process, and is slowly moving towards work with professional musicians and recording studios.
*Pit Orchestra, a program consisting of two distinct ensembles that perform with the annual musical and opera. In 2014, the musical pit orchestra worked with Lin-Manuel Miranda and the cast of In The Heights to help workshop their own production of the musical.

====Vocal programs====
Every student in the vocal department must perform with Elementary Chorus in their first or second year. At the secondary level, students must perform with either Mixed Chorus or Girls&#x27; Chorus. Third-year vocal music majors must complete an additional year of chorus, performing either with Mixed Chorus, Women&#x27;s Chorus, or Senior Chorus. 
*Women&#x27;s Chorus is an all-female group that is open to third- and fourth-year voice students. It is not audition-based.
*Senior Chorus is a competitive elective class open to juniors and seniors. The ensemble is one of LaGuardia&#x27;s most well known and has been routinely selected to perform for the American Choral Directors Association. 
*Gospel Chorus is an elective open to all students. 
*Show Choir is also an elective course that accepts students from any studio. 
*Opera Workshop is open to third- and fourth-year vocal majors through audition, where operatic works are analyzed and studied. The opera of choice is performed halfway through the spring semester. In 2011, the Broadway musical team of Laurence O&#x27;Keefe and Nell Benjamin announced a musical with LaGuardia&#x27;s Opera Workshop and Pit Orchestra. The musical, entitled &quot;Life of the Party&quot;, is a comedy based on Stalinist movie musicals of the Soviet Union. The work ran from May 3 through May 6, 2012.
*Solo Voice teaches operatic solos through private instruction.

====Musicology programs====
Every music student must pass an elementary sight singing course as well as a year of music theory and history in order to graduate. 
*The LaGuardia New Music Ensemble focuses on popular music composition and theory. Students are able to compose their own original songs and perform them during school productions. The ensemble grants admission through auditions, in which a portfolio is required.
*Music Technology is a class in music production, electronic music history and computer theory.
*Composition is taught through private instruction, currently with composer Jim Pugliese.

===Dance===
The Dance Department is based strictly on pre-conservatory-based training in the field of dance. Students spend the first two years training solely in classical ballet and the combined modern techniques of Graham and Horton. In their junior year they are given the opportunity to take musical theater and tap classes. Beyond that, the junior class performs for the first time junior year. The second semester of junior year they take a choreography class in which they create pieces of their own to perform. Senior year, the dancers take career management classes to support their success and take part in two performances: the Winter Showcase and the Graduation Dance Concert of the spring.

Alumni of the program include Desmond Richardson and Suzanne Vega.

===Technical theater===
The Technical Theater Studio is a professional training program that provides students with the skills and techniques necessary to pursue a career in technical theater. Concepts and aesthetics are taught using contemporary teaching methods that utilize state-of-the-art equipment. Professionally produced events in the concert hall, thrust-stage theater, and black-box theater provide students with practical hands-on work experiences.

==Sports==
LaGuardia offers 21 different sports on the Varsity level. LaGuardia competes with the Public School Athletic League (PSAL). 

===Fall season sports===
Fall season sports include bowling, swimming, volleyball, cross country (girls&#x27;), fencing (co-ed), soccer, and cross country (boys&#x27;). 

===Winter season sports===
Winter season sports include basketball, gymnastics, and indoor track (boys&#x27; and girls&#x27;). 

===Spring season sports===
In the spring, the school offers baseball, outdoor track, tennis, volleyball (boys&#x27;), handball, softball and tennis (girls&#x27;).

==Representation in other media==
The 1980 dramatic film &quot;Fame&quot; was based on student life at the School of Performing Arts before its merger into LaGuardia High School. A television series based on the film, &quot;Fame&quot;, aired in 1982. It was adapted again as a stage musical, which premiered in 1988. A loose remake of the film was released in 2009.

==Drugs and mental health issues==
The school has documented issues with heavy drugs such as opioids and other pharmaceuticals. 

Mental health is also a big issue at the school. Students have sometimes struggled with the demanding workload at the school. Other obligations have taken a toll on the mental health of the student body, especially in recent years. The NYCDOE&#x27;s school snapshot surveys shows that 81% of students at the school say they experienced stress. In the 2019–2020 NYCDOE surveys, 46% of students reported that their teachers support them when they&#x27;re upset.

The first British publication (by Samuel Orchart Beeton) is in April followed by C. H. Clarke and Co.&#x27;s in May and John Cassell&#x27;s serial issue with illustrations by George Cruikshank, together with pirated reprints from Routledge. The first dramatic adaptations appear on the New York stage from Autumn. This year also, Jewett publishes the first work of fiction in English by an African American, the escaped slave Frederick Douglass&#x27;s novella &quot;The Heroic Slave, a heartwarming Narrative of the Adventures of Madison Washington, in Pursuit of Liberty&quot;.

<doc id="205105" wikidata="Q1931672" url="?curid=205105" title="Drill (EP)">
<text>Drill is the debut EP by the English rock band Radiohead, released in May 1992. It was Radiohead&#x27;s first commercial release, and attracted little attention, reaching 101 on the UK Album Chart. Radiohead rerecorded three &quot;Drill&quot; songs for their debut album, &quot;Pablo Honey&quot; (1993).

==Background==

The members of Radiohead met while attending Abingdon School, an independent school for boys in Abingdon, England. In 1985, they formed , the name referring to their usual rehearsal day in the school&#x27;s music room. They recorded demos including the &quot;Manic Hedgehog&quot; tape, named after a record shop in Oxford.

In late 1991, Radiohead signed a six-album recording contract with EMI and changed their name at EMI&#x27;s request. &quot;Radiohead&quot; was taken from the song &quot;Radio Head&quot; on the Talking Heads album &quot;True Stories&quot; (1986).

== Recording ==
Radiohead recorded &quot;Drill&quot; at Courtyard Studios in Oxon, England. It was produced by Radiohead&#x27;s manager, Chris Hufford. Hufford said this was a mistake, as it created a conflict of interest and generated friction in the studio. &quot;Drill&quot; featured two new recordings, &quot;Prove Yourself&quot; and &quot;Stupid Car&quot;; the other songs were taken from Radiohead&#x27;s &quot;Manic Hedgehog&quot; demo. 

==Release==
&quot;Drill&quot; was released on 5 May 1992. It reached number 101 on the UK Singles Chart. The &quot;Guardian&quot; described it as an &quot;inauspicious start&quot; that was &quot;largely ignored&quot;. Radiohead toured with Catherine Wheel and the Sultans of Ping in support of &quot;Drill&quot;. &quot;Prove Yourself&quot; was played on BBC Radio 1 by Gary Davies, Radiohead&#x27;s first national radio exposure in the UK. 

In 1995, &quot;Record Collector&quot; described &quot;Drill&quot; as &quot;abrasive and melancholic by turns&quot;, with &quot;the first in a long history of nihilistic one-liners that suggested Thom&#x27;s worldview was one of genuine self-loathing rather than bathetic self-pity&quot;. The music journalist Mac Randall wrote later: &quot;Even as early as 1992, Thom Yorke&#x27;s graceful, arrestingly plaintive vocal style was well developed, far more so than the band&#x27;s songwriting or overall sound.&quot;

Radiohead rerecorded &quot;You&quot;, &quot;Prove Yourself&quot; and &quot;Thinking About You&quot; for their debut album, &quot;Pablo Honey&quot; (1993). Capitol reissued &quot;Drill&quot; on vinyl in April 2009. It was added to streaming services in January 2020.

<text>Charles Edwin Hatcher (January 21, 1942 – April 2, 2003), known by his stage name Edwin Starr, was an American singer and songwriter. He is best remembered for his Norman Whitfield-produced Motown singles of the 1970s, most notably the number-one hit &quot;War&quot;.

Born in Nashville and raised in Cleveland, Ohio, he later lived in Detroit while singing for Ric-Tic and Motown Records. He was backed by the band that became known as &quot;Black Merda&quot;. Hawkins and Veasey of the group played on most of his early hits on the Ric Tic Label. Starr&#x27;s songs &quot;Twenty-Five Miles&quot; and &quot;Stop the War Now&quot; were also major successes, in 1969 and 1971 respectively. In the 1970s Starr moved to England, where he continued to produce music and resided until his death.

==Early life==
Charles Edwin Hatcher was born in Nashville, Tennessee, on January 21, 1942. He and his cousins, soul singers Roger and Willie Hatcher, moved to Cleveland, Ohio, where they were raised.

In 1957, Hatcher formed a doo-wop group, the Future Tones, and began his singing career. However, after just one single he was called up for military service in the United States Army for three years, where he was posted to Europe. Following the end of his service he decided to make music his career, and joined the musical group of Bill Doggett. Hatcher adopted the name Edwin Starr at the suggestion of Doggett&#x27;s manager Don Briggs, and made his solo recording debut in 1965 for the Detroit record company Ric-Tic.

==Career==
The song that launched his career was &quot;Agent Double-O-Soul&quot; (1965), a reference to the James Bond films, already popular at the time. Other early hits included &quot;Headline News&quot;, &quot;Back Street&quot;, and &quot;Stop Her on Sight (S.O.S.)&quot;. (These first four hits were all co-written by Starr as &quot;C. Hatcher&quot;.) While at Ric-Tic, as Edwin Starr he wrote the song &quot;Oh, How Happy&quot;, a number 12 &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 hit in 1966 for The Shades of Blue (he would go on to release a version of the song with Blinky in 1969) and sang lead for the Holidays on their number 12 R&amp;B hit, &quot;I&#x27;ll Love You Forever&quot;. At Motown he recorded a string of singles before enjoying international success with &quot;Twenty-Five Miles&quot;, which he co-wrote with producers Johnny Bristol and Harvey Fuqua. It peaked at number 6 in both the Hot 100 and R&amp;B Charts in 1969.

It was when Motown&#x27;s Berry Gordy became frustrated with smaller labels like Ric-Tic stealing some of the success of his company that he bought out the label. Many of Starr&#x27;s Ric-Tic songs (subsequently owned by Motown) like &quot;Back Street&quot; and &quot;Headline News&quot; became favored northern soul classics. His early Ric-Tic hit &quot;Stop Her on Sight (S.O.S.)&quot;, was reissued in Britain (with &quot;Headline News&quot; as its B-side) in 1968, and it performed better than the original release on the UK Chart, surpassing the original number 35 and peaking at number 11. His 1970 song &quot;Time&quot; also helped to establish him as a prominent artist on the northern soul scene.

The biggest hit of Starr&#x27;s career, which cemented his reputation, was the Vietnam War protest song &quot;War&quot; (1970). Starr&#x27;s intense vocals transformed a Temptations album track into a number one chart success, which spent three weeks in the top position on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, an anthem for the antiwar movement and a cultural milestone that continues to resound in movie soundtracks and hip hop music samples. It sold over three million copies, and was awarded a gold disc. &quot;War&quot; appeared on both Starr&#x27;s &quot;War &amp; Peace&quot; album and its follow-up, &quot;Involved&quot;, produced by Norman Whitfield. &quot;Involved&quot; also featured another song of similar construction titled &quot;Stop the War Now&quot;, which was a minor hit in its own right. Music critic Robert Christgau called the latter album &quot;Norman Whitfield&#x27;s peak production&quot;. His backing singers during this time were Total Concept Unlimited, who later became Rose Royce.

Starr continued to record, most notably the song &quot;Hell Up in Harlem&quot; for the 1974 film &quot;Hell Up in Harlem&quot;, which was the sequel to &quot;Black Caesar&quot;, an earlier hit with a soundtrack by James Brown. In 1979, Starr reappeared on the charts with a pair of disco hits, &quot;(Eye-to-Eye) Contact&quot; and &quot;H.A.P.P.Y. Radio&quot;. &quot;Contact&quot; was the more successful of the two, peaking at number 65 on the US pop chart, number 13 on the R&amp;B chart, number 1 on the dance chart, and number 6 on the UK Singles Chart. &quot;H.A.P.P.Y. Radio&quot; was also a top ten hit in the UK, reaching number 9 on the chart in mid-1979. By now, he had joined the well-established disco boom and had further singles on 20th Century Records. Over the years, he released tracks on a variety of labels, including Avatar, Calibre, 10 Records, Motown (a return to his former label for a 1989 remix of &quot;25 Miles&quot;), Streetwave (where he recorded 1984&#x27;s &quot;Marvin&quot;, a tribute to Marvin Gaye) and Hippodrome (a division of Peter Stringfellow&#x27;s Hippodrome nightclub). His Starr café empire still enjoys success in and around Essex.

In 1985, Starr released &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Fair&quot;. Despite garnering the attention of many in the soul and dance clubs, it fell short of becoming a major hit (managing number 56 on the UK Chart). &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Fair&quot;, along with several other singles released around the same time, appeared on Starr&#x27;s &quot;Through the Grapevine&quot; album, which was not released until 1990. Starr appeared on the charity number one single &quot;Let It Be&quot; by Ferry Aid in 1987. Later that year, Starr teamed up with the Stock, Aitken and Waterman (SAW) production company for the club hit, &quot;Whatever Makes Our Love Grow&quot;. Starr expressed dissatisfaction with the process of making the record, complaining that the producers treated him as an amateur.

In 1989, a number 17 UK hit by the Cookie Crew called &quot;Got to Keep On&quot; sampled a portion of &quot;25 Miles&quot;. This track was then featured on a 1990 dance medley made for the BRIT Awards, which made number 2 in the UK Singles Chart. A club mix of various artists, it included the previous years remix of &quot;25 Miles&quot;.

In 1989, Starr also joined Ian Levine&#x27;s Motorcity Records, releasing six singles and the album &quot;Where Is the Sound&quot;, as well as co-writing several songs for other artists on the label. Starr resurfaced briefly in 2000 to team up with the UK band Utah Saints to record a new version of &quot;Funky Music Sho&#x27; &#x27;Nuff Turns Me On&quot;. He appeared again in 2002 to record a song with the British musician Jools Holland, singing &quot;Snowflake Boogie&quot; on Holland&#x27;s compact disc &quot;More Friends&quot;; and to record another track with Utah Saints, a so-far-unreleased version of his number one hit &quot;War&quot;—his last recording.

In 1995, Starr featured in &quot;Blue Juice&quot;, a 1995 British drama film as a soul singer named Ossie Sands. The songs featured were recorded by Starr for the film. The film has the added attraction of being possibly the first film to include Northern Soul as a sub-plot.

In late 2002, Edwin Starr appeared with many R&amp;B stars on the &quot;Rhythm, Love, and Soul&quot; edition of the PBS series American Soundtrack. His performance of &quot;25 Miles&quot; was included on the accompanying live album that was released in 2004.

==Personal life and death==
Starr remained a hero on England&#x27;s northern soul circuit and moved to England in 1983, continuing to live there for the remainder of his life. He based himself in the Midlands, living for many years at Pooley Hall at Polesworth, Warwickshire, before moving to Bramcote in Nottinghamshire.

Starr died on April 2, 2003, from a heart attack at his Nottinghamshire home. He was 61. He is buried at Wilford Hill Cemetery in Nottingham. He was survived by his long term partner Jean, and by his son and daughter from earlier relationships.

==Honours==
Edwin Starr was inducted into the inaugural class of the Official Rhythm &amp; Blues Music Hall of Fame at Cleveland State University in August 2013.

Starr was inducted into the Michigan Rock and Roll Legends Hall of Fame in 2017.

Starr is one of the subjects of a mural in Beeston, Nottingham, which is not far from where he lived later in life.

<text>Air Vice Marshal Forster Herbert Martin &quot;Sammy&quot; Maynard, (1 May 1893 – 26 January 1976) was a senior commander in the Royal Air Force and a flying ace credited with six aerial victories during the First World War. He also served as the Air Officer Commanding Malta during the early part of the Second World War.

His son, Nigel Maynard, also became an air marshal in the RAF.

==Early life==
He was born in New Zealand to a Church of England clergyman. The family returned to England two years later and he was educated at St John&#x27;s School, Leatherhead, and University College London.

==World War I==
Maynard joined the Royal Naval Division in 1914 as an engineer. He transferred to the Royal Naval Air Service the following year. After training, he became an instructor until 1916.

In January 1917, he was posted to No. 1 Squadron RNAS on the Western Front. While there, flying a Sopwith Triplane, he ran up a string of six victories from 29 April through 1 June 1917; his final tally included an enemy fighter set afire, another one destroyed in conjunction with a couple of squadron mates, and four enemy planes driven down out of control, including one shared with Cyril Ridley and six other pilots.

In September 1917, he was transferred to the aircraft depot at Dunkirk. After his return to England, he was injured in a crash. After recovery, he became officer commanding of a training depot. He subsequently received the Air Force Cross for his work in training.

==Inter war==
Between the wars he attended the Imperial Defence College. He was posted to HQ Iraq Command and served administrative positions for the Air Staff.

==World War II==
When Italy declared war in June 1940, a part of the very limited strength of the fighter squadron based at Malta were four Gloster Gladiators, which were found in crates marked &quot;Boxed Spares – Property of the Royal Navy&quot; (these having been left by in April). Maynard obtained permission to assemble them, and three of these units, named &quot;Faith&quot;, &quot;Hope&quot;, and &quot;Charity&quot;, they were part of the initially limited defence during the Siege of Malta.

After he was replaced on Malta, he was AOA, HQ RAF Coastal Command. In 1944 he was AOC of No. 19 (Reconnaissance) Group.

<text>Melissa Manchester (born February 15, 1951) is an American singer, songwriter and actress. Since the 1970s, her songs have been played by adult contemporary radio stations. She has also appeared on television, in films, and on stage.

== Early life and career ==

Manchester was born in the Bronx, a borough of New York City, into a musical family. Her father, David Manchester, was a bassoonist for the New York Metropolitan Opera for three decades. Her mother was one of the first women to design and found her own clothing firm, Ruth Manchester Ltd. The Manchesters are of Jewish origin.

Manchester started a singing career at an early age. She learned the piano and harpsichord at the Manhattan School of Music, began singing commercial jingles at age 15, and became a staff writer at age 17 for Chappell Music while attending Manhattan&#x27;s High School of Performing Arts.

She studied songwriting at New York University with Paul Simon when she was 19. Manchester played the Manhattan club scene, where Barry Manilow, a friend and fellow singer of jingles, introduced her to Bette Midler. In 1971, she became a member of the Harlettes, the back-up singers for Midler, which she co-created with Manilow.

Manchester made a brief speaking appearance as &quot;Yoko Ono&quot; on the 1972 album &quot;National Lampoon Radio Dinner&quot;, on the track titled &quot;Magical Misery Tour&quot;, and as the singer in &quot;Deteriorata&quot;.

== Solo career ==
Manchester&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Home to Myself&quot;, was released in 1973; Manchester co-wrote many of its songs with Carole Bayer Sager. Two years later, her album &quot;Melissa&quot; produced her first top-ten hit, &quot;Midnight Blue&quot;, which enjoyed 17 weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 charts. The song&#x27;s peak position was #6 for the week of August 9, 1975.

In 1974, she performed the songs &quot;O Heaven&quot; and &quot;Home to Myself&quot; on the pilot episode of &quot;Ms.&quot; magazine&#x27;s television show, &quot;Woman Alive!&quot;, a feminist program. She performed the song live on Burt Sugarman&#x27;s television series &quot;Midnight Special&quot; in 1973.
In 1976, Manchester released &#x27;Come in From the Rain&#x27; on her 1976 &quot;Better Days &amp; Happy Endings&quot; album. It has since been covered by several other artists including Captain &amp; Tennille, Rosemary Clooney, Vic Damone, Eydie Gorme, Shirley Horn, Cleo Laine, Peggy Lee, Carmen McRae, Jane Olivor, Liza Minnelli, Barbara Cook, Mel Torme, and Diana Ross.

Manchester appeared with Richie Havens, Melanie, and Frankie Valli as a contributor and performer in the 1977 NBC special documentary &quot;How the Beatles Changed the World&quot;. Manchester collaborated with Kenny Loggins to co-write Loggins&#x27; 1978 hit duet with Stevie Nicks, &quot;Whenever I Call You &#x27;Friend. She would later record this for her 1979 Melissa Manchester album. She guest-starred on the CBS-TV daytime soap opera &quot;Search for Tomorrow&quot; to teach a main character (played by Michael Nouri), who played a singer-songwriter, the essentials of the craft. In 1979, Manchester reached #10 with her version of Peter Allen&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Cry Out Loud&quot;, for which she received a Grammy nomination for Best Pop Female Vocal Performance.

In 1979, she performed two nominated songs on the Academy Awards show: &quot;I&#x27;ll Never Say Goodbye&quot; (from &quot;The Promise&quot;) and &quot;Through the Eyes of Love&quot; (theme song from &quot;Ice Castles&quot;). The winning song that year was &quot;It Goes Like It Goes&quot;, from &quot;Norma Rae&quot;.

In 1980, she appeared on &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;.

In 1982, she released the smash &quot;You Should Hear How She Talks About You&quot;, which won the 1983 Grammy for Best Pop Female Vocal Performance, beating out Linda Ronstadt, Olivia Newton-John, Juice Newton, and Laura Branigan. The song itself reached #4 in &quot;Cash Box&quot; and #5 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart as well as #10 Adult Contemporary.

In 1985, she signed with MCA Records and released the album &quot;Ma+hematics&quot;.

Manchester continued to place singles on the Adult Contemporary charts throughout the 1980s. Another top-ten entry on the AC chart was a 1989 updating of Dionne Warwick&#x27;s &quot;Walk on By&quot;. The single was pulled from her Mika/Polygram album &quot;Tribute&quot;, which honored some of the singers that influenced her style. In 1992 she sang the title song for the animated musical &quot;Little Nemo: Adventures in Slumberland&quot;, written by the Sherman Brothers and accompanied by the London Symphony Orchestra.

In 1995, she released the album &quot;If My Heart Had Wings&quot; on Atlantic Records.

She appeared as herself during a two-day guest appearance on the ABC-TV daytime drama &quot;General Hospital&quot; to sing the song for Robin Scorpio and her AIDS-afflicted boyfriend Stone Cates.

Throughout the 1980s and 1990s Manchester alternated recording with acting, appearing with Bette Midler in the film &quot;For the Boys&quot;, on the television series &quot;Blossom&quot;, and co-writing (with bookwriter-lyricist Jeffrey Sweet) and starring in the musical &quot;I Sent a Letter to My Love&quot; based on the Bernice Rubens novel of the same name. In 1990, Manchester could be heard performing &quot;I Wish I Knew&quot;, played over the opening credits of the CBS television drama &quot;The Trials of Rosie O&#x27;Neill&quot;. In addition, she opened Game 6 of the 1991 World Series singing the U.S. National Anthem.

== Later career to present ==
Manchester composed and recorded the soundtrack to the direct-to-video &quot;Lady and the Tramp II: Scamp&#x27;s Adventure&quot; (2001).

In 2004, Manchester returned with her first album in nine years, &quot;When I Look Down That Road&quot;. While touring to support the album, she was praised for her still &quot;powerful voice&quot; and for &quot;reinventing [herself] while staying true to what made [her] popular.&quot;

In April 2007, she returned to theater, starring in the Chicago production of &quot;HATS! The Musical&quot;, a show to which she and Sharon Vaughn contributed two songs. Also in 2007, she recorded a duet cover with Barry Manilow of the Carole King classic &quot;You&#x27;ve Got a Friend&quot; on Manilow&#x27;s &quot;The Greatest Songs of the Seventies&quot;. In 2008, Manchester released a new single, &quot;The Power of Ribbons&quot;, to digital retailers. Proceeds from othe single benefit breast cancer research.

In 2011 an independent film named &quot;Dirty Girl&quot; was released with many of Manchester&#x27;s songs used throughout the film, five of which made it onto the soundtrack. Manchester made a non-speaking cameo appearance as the pianist who accompanies the lead character&#x27;s rendition of &quot;Don&#x27;t Cry Out Loud&quot;.

In 2013, Manchester announced that she was recording her 20th studio album, &quot;You Gotta Love the Life&quot;, her first since &quot;When I Look Down That Road&quot;. She subsequently launched an Indiegogo campaign to raise funds to independently release the album.

In an interview with NPR, Manchester talks about the crowd-funding experience and relays the back-story behind the single &quot;Feelin&#x27; for You&quot;. A drunk in a juke joint approached Manchester and asked if she was married, to which she replied, &quot;Yes, very happily.&quot; The drunk replied, &quot;Too bad, cause I got a feelin&#x27; for you.&quot; &quot;Feelin&#x27; for You&quot;, written by Manchester and Sara Niemietz, includes a solo by Keb&#x27; Mo&#x27;. The single was released on January 9, 2015, and premiered at #2 on the Smooth jazz charts. &quot;You Gotta Love the Life&quot; was released on February 10, 2015, and hit #17 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Jazz Albums chart for the week of February 28, 2015.

A second single, &quot;Big Light&quot;, featuring a duet with Al Jarreau, along with an accompanying music video, was released for radio on June 15, 2015.

In 2017, more than 25 years after Manchester released &quot;Tribute&quot;, her 1989 album honoring the female singers who influenced her, she released &quot;The Fellas&quot;, with covers of male influences including Tony Bennett, Dean Martin, Johnny Mathis, Frank Sinatra and Mel Torme. This was Manchester&#x27;s second independently produced studio album, which featured accompaniment by the Blue Note Orchestra from Citrus College in Glendora, CA, where she is artist-in-residence. There was only one duet on the album, &#x27;For Me and My Gal&#x27;, performed with Barry Manilow.

During the pandemic of 2020, Manchester kept busy working on her 24th album, RE:VIEW, a re-envisioned and reworked compilation of several of her previous hits. She released just one song per month with its accompanying video, which addressed the political and social climates of the time. The complete album was planned for a Fall 2021 release via CD and streaming services.

In 2021, she returned to playing club dates, though mainly telling stories and singing just a few songs of her catalog. During one such performance in which she shared the stage with Michael Feinstein, Manchester was surprised by Feinstein and Great American Songbook Foundation Executive Director Christopher Lewis with the Songbook Hall of Fame&#x27;s New Standard Award. While presenting her with the award, Feinstein said, &quot;Among the awards we present each year is the New Standard Award, which is presented to a songwriter or performer who continues to write and perform music that will stand the test of time and become the pop standards of tomorrow. I can&#x27;t think of anyone who fits that description more than Melissa Manchester. Her music has touched the lives of so many people over the years. Her songs – many of which we heard tonight – have become standards and are part of the fabric of our lives.&quot;

In 2023, she played Mrs. Brice in the US national tour of the Broadway musical &quot;Funny Girl&quot;.

<text>A drill is a tool used for making round holes or driving fasteners. It is fitted with a drill bit for making holes, or a screwdriver bit for securing fasteners. Historically, they were powered by hand, and later mains power, but cordless battery-powered drills are proliferating due to increased efficiency and ease of use.

Drills are commonly used in woodworking, metalworking, construction, machine tool fabrication, and utility projects. Specially designed versions are made for a surgery, dentistry, miniatures, and other applications.

== History ==
Around 35,000 BC, &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; discovered the benefits of the application of rotary tools. This would have rudimentarily consisted of a pointed rock being spun between the hands to bore a hole through another material. This led to the hand drill, a smooth stick, that was sometimes attached to flint point, and was rubbed between the palms. This was used by many ancient civilizations around the world including the Mayans. The earliest perforated artifacts, such as bone, ivory, shells, and antlers found, are from the Upper Paleolithic era. Bow drill (strap-drill) are the first machine drills, as they convert a back and forth motion to a rotary motion, and they can be traced back to around 10,000 years ago. It was discovered that tying a cord around a stick, and then attaching the ends of the string to the ends of a stick (a bow), allowed a user to drill quicker and more efficiently. Mainly used to create fire, bow-drills were also used in ancient woodwork, stonework, and dentistry. Archaeologists discovered a Neolithic grave yard in Mehrgarh, Pakistan, dating from the time of the Harappans, around 7,500–9,000 years ago, containing nine adult bodies with a total of eleven teeth that had been drilled. There are hieroglyphs depicting Egyptian carpenters and bead makers in a tomb at Thebes using bow-drills. The earliest evidence of these tools being used in Egypt dates back to around 2500 BCE. The usage of bow-drills was widely spread through Europe, Africa, Asia, and North America, during ancient times and is still used today. Over the years many slight variations of bow and strap drills have developed for the various uses of either boring through materials or lighting fires.

The core drill was developed in ancient Egypt by 3000 BC. The pump drill was invented during Roman times. It consists of a vertical spindle aligned by a piece of horizontal wood and a flywheel to maintain accuracy and momentum.

The hollow-borer tip, first used around the 13th century, consisted of a stick with a tubular shaped piece of metal on the end, such as copper. This allowed a hole to be drilled while only actually grinding the outer section of it. This completely separates the inner stone or wood from the rest, allowing the drill to pulverize less material to create a similarly sized hole.

While the pump-drill and the bow-drill were used in Western Civilization to bore smaller holes for a larger part of human history, the auger was used to drill larger holes starting sometime between Roman and Medieval ages. The auger allowed for more torque for larger holes. It is uncertain when the brace and bit was invented; however, the earliest picture found so far dates from the 15th century. It is a type of hand crank drill that consists of two parts as seen in the picture. The brace, on the upper half, is where the user holds and turns it and on the lower part is the bit. The bit is interchangeable as bits wear down. The auger uses a rotating helical screw similar to the Archimedean screw-shaped bit that is common today. The gimlet is also worth mentioning as it is a scaled down version of an auger.

Archimedes&#x27; screw, present in drills to remove perforation dirt from the hole, was invented in Hellenistic Egypt around 300 BCE.

The screw pump is the oldest positive displacement pump. The first records of a water screw, or screw pump, date back to Hellenistic Egypt before the 3rd century BC. The Egyptian screw, used to lift water from the Nile, was composed of tubes wound round a cylinder; as the entire unit rotates, water is lifted within the spiral tube to the higher elevation. A later screw pump design from Egypt had a spiral groove cut on the outside of a solid wooden cylinder and then the cylinder was covered by boards or sheets of metal closely covering the surfaces between the grooves.

In the East, churn drills were invented as early as 221 BC during the Chinese Qin dynasty, capable of reaching a depth of 1500 m. Churn drills in ancient China were built of wood and labor-intensive, but were able to go through solid rock. The churn drill appears in Europe during the 12th century. In 1835 Isaac Singer is reported to have built a steam powered churn drill based on the method the Chinese of a rod tipped with a bit. Also worth briefly discussing are the early drill presses; they were machine tools that derived from bow-drills but were powered by windmills or water wheels. Drill presses consisted of the powered drills that could be raised or lowered into a material, allowing for less force by the user.

In 1813 Richard Trevithick designed a steam-driven rotary drill, also the first drill to be powered by steam. In 1848 J.J. Couch invented the first pneumatic percussion drill.

The next great advancement in drilling technology, the electric motor, led to the invention of the electric drill. It is credited to mining engineers Arthur James Arnot and William Blanch Brain of Melbourne, Australia who patented the electric drill in 1889.
The first portable handheld drill was created by in 1895 by brothers Wilhelm &amp; Carl Fein of Stuttgart, Germany. In 1917 the first trigger-switch, pistol-grip portable drill was patented by Black &amp; Decker. This was the start of the modern drill era. Over the last century the electric drill has been created in a variety of types and multiple sizes for an assortment of specific uses.

==Types==
There are many types of drills: some are powered manually, others use electricity (electric drill) or compressed air (&quot;pneumatic drill&quot;) as the motive power, and a minority are driven by an internal combustion engine (for example, earth drilling augers). Drills with a percussive action (hammer drills) are mostly used in hard materials such as masonry (brick, concrete and stone) or rock. Drilling rigs are used to bore holes in the earth to obtain water or oil. Oil wells, water wells, or holes for geothermal heating are created with large drilling rigs. Some types of hand-held drills are also used to drive screws and other fasteners. Some small appliances that have no motor of their own may be drill-powered, such as small pumps, grinders, etc.

===Primitive===
Some forms of drills have been used since Pre-History, both to make holes in hard objects or as fire drills.
* Awl – The shaft is twisted with one hand
* Hand drill – The shaft is spun by rubbing motion of the hands
* Bow drill – The shaft is spun by cord of a bow that is moved back and forth.
* Pump drill – The shaft is spun by pushing down on a hand bar and by a flywheel

=== Hand-powered ===

Hand-powered metal drills have been in use for centuries. They include:
* Auger, a straight shaft with a wood-cutting blade at the bottom and a T-shaped handle
* Brace, a modified auger powered by means of a crankshaft
* Gimlet, a small tool for drilling holes
* Bradawl, similar to a screwdriver but with a drilling point
* Cranial drill, an instrument used throughout skull surgery
* or hand drill, also known as an , as it is analogous in form to a hand-cranked eggbeater with bevel gears
** Breast drill, a heavy duty subtype of eggbeater drill that has a flat chest piece in addition to one or more handles
* Push, such as Yankee or Persian drills, which use spiral or ratcheting mechanisms
* Pin chuck, a small hand-held jeweler&#x27;s drill

===Power drills===
Drills powered by electricity (or more rarely, compressed air) are the most common tools in woodworking and machining shops.

Electric drills can be corded (fed from an electric outlet through a power cable) or cordless (fed by rechargeable electric batteries). The latter have removable battery packs that can be swapped to allow uninterrupted drilling while recharging.

A popular use of hand-held power drills is to set screws into wood, through the use of screwdriver bits. Drills optimized for this purpose have a clutch to avoid damaging the slots on the screw head.
* Pistol-grip drill – the most common hand-held power drill type.
* Right-angle drill – used to drill or drive screws in tight spaces.
* Hammer drill – combines rotary motion with a hammer action for drilling masonry. The hammer action may be engaged or disengaged as required.
* Drill press – larger power drill with a rigid holding frame, standalone mounted on a bench
* Rotary hammer combines a primary dedicated hammer mechanism with a separate rotation mechanism, and is used for more substantial material such as masonry or concrete.

Most electric hammer drills are rated (input power) at between 600 and 1100 watts. The efficiency is usually 50–60% i.e. 1000 watts of input is converted into 500–600 watts of output (rotation of the drill and hammering action).

For much of the 20th century, attachments could commonly be purchased to convert corded electric hand drills into a range of other power tools, such as orbital sanders and power saws, more cheaply than purchasing dedicated versions of those tools. As the prices of power tools and suitable electric motors have fallen such attachments have become much less common.

Early cordless drills used interchangeable 7.2 V battery packs. Over the years battery voltages have increased, with 18 V drills being most common, but higher voltages are available, such as 24 V, 28 V, and 36 V. This allows these tools to produce as much torque as some corded drills.

Common battery types of are nickel-cadmium (NiCd) batteries and lithium-ion batteries, with each holding about half the market share. NiCd batteries have been around longer, so they are less expensive (their main advantage), but have more disadvantages compared to lithium-ion batteries. NiCd disadvantages are limited life, self-discharging, environment problems upon disposal, and eventually internally short circuiting due to dendrite growth. Lithium-ion batteries are becoming more common because of their short charging time, longer life, absence of memory effect, and low weight. Instead of charging a tool for an hour to get 20 minutes of use, 20 minutes of charge can run the tool for an hour in average. Lithium-ion batteries also hold a charge for a significantly longer time than nickel-cadmium batteries, about two years if not used, vs. 1 to 4 months for a nickel-cadmium battery.

====Impact drills====
Also known as impact wrenches, is a form of drill that incorporates a hammer motion along with the rotating motion of a conventional drill. The hammering aspect of the impact drill occurs when the power of the motor cannot turn the bolt it will begin exerting bursts of force to &quot;hammer&quot; the bolt in the desired direction. These drills are commonly used to secure long bolts or screws into wood, metal, and concrete, as well as loosening ceased or over torqued bolts. Impact drills come in two major types, pneumatic and electric, and vary in size depending on application. Electric impact drills are most often found cordless and are widely used in construction, automobile repair, and fabrication. These electric drills are preferred over the pneumatic driven because of their maneuverability and ease of use. Pneumatic impact drills rely on air and have to remain connected to an air source to maintain power. The chuck on impact drills is different from the conventional handheld power drill. The chuck acts more as a collet with a hexagonal shape in which the bits and drivers lock into. Impact drivers can also be used to bore holes like a standard pistol grip drill, but this requires a special bit that will lock into the hexagonal collet. The design of the impact drills are almost identical to modern pistol grip power drills with only one major difference. Impact drills have a shorter, skinnier, stubby receiver where the collet is located compared to the larger tapered chuck on a conventional drill. This allows the user to fit in smaller places that a normal drill would not. Impact drills are not great in regards to torque and speed control. Most handheld drills have a variable speed option, whereas most impact drills have a fixed torque and speed. Impact drills are not designed for precision work due to this lack of adjustability.

====Hammer drill====
The hammer action of a hammer drill is provided by two cam plates that make the chuck rapidly pulse forward and backward as the drill spins on its axis. This pulsing (hammering) action is measured in Blows Per Minute (BPM) with 10,000 or more BPMs being common. Because the combined mass of the chuck and bit is comparable to that of the body of the drill, the energy transfer is inefficient and can sometimes make it difficult for larger bits to penetrate harder materials such as poured concrete. A standard hammer drill accepts 6 mm (1/4 inch) and 13 mm (1/2 inch) drill bits. The operator experiences considerable vibration, and the cams are generally made from hardened steel to avoid them wearing out quickly. In practice, drills are restricted to standard masonry bits up to 13 mm (1/2 inch) in diameter. A typical application for a hammer drill is installing electrical boxes, conduit straps or shelves in concrete.

====Rotary hammer====
The rotary hammer (also known as a rotary hammer drill, roto hammer drill or masonry drill). Standard chucks and parallel-shank carbide-tipped drills have been largely superseded by SDS chucks and matching (spline shank) drills, that have been designed to better withstand and transmit the percussive forces. These bits are effective at pulverising the masonry and drill into this hard material. Some styles of this tool are intended for masonry drilling only and the hammer action cannot be disengaged. Other styles allow the drill to be used without the hammer action for normal drilling, or hammering to be used without rotation for chiselling.

In contrast to the cam-type hammer drill, a rotary/pneumatic hammer drill accelerates only the bit. This is accomplished through a piston design, rather than a spinning cam. Rotary hammers have much less vibration and penetrate most building materials. They can also be used as &quot;drill only&quot; or as &quot;hammer only&quot; which extends their usefulness for tasks such as chipping brick or concrete. Hole drilling progress is greatly superior to cam-type hammer drills, and these drills are generally used for holes of 19 mm (3/4 inch) or greater in size. A typical application for a rotary hammer drill is boring large holes for lag bolts in foundations, or installing large lead anchors in concrete for handrails or benches.

====Drill press====


A drill press (also known as a pedestal drill, pillar drill, or bench drill) is a style of drill that may be mounted on a stand or bolted to the floor or workbench. Portable models are made, some including a magnetic base. Major components include a base, column (or pillar), adjustable table, spindle, chuck, and drill head, usually driven by an electric motor. The head typically has a set of three handles radiating from a central hub that are turned to move the spindle and chuck vertically. The distance from the center of the chuck to the closest edge of the column is the throat. The swing is simply twice the throat, and the swing is how drill presses are classified and sold. Thus, a tool with 4&quot; throat has an 8&quot; swing (it can drill a hole in the center of an 8&quot; work piece), and is called an 8&quot; drill press.

A drill press has a number of advantages over a hand-held drill:
* Less effort is required to apply the drill to the workpiece. The movement of the chuck and spindle is by a lever working on a rack and pinion, which gives the operator considerable mechanical advantage
* The table allows a vise or clamp to be used to position and restrain the work, making the operation much more secure
* The angle of the spindle is fixed relative to the table, allowing holes to be drilled accurately and consistently
* Drill presses are almost always equipped with more powerful motors compared to hand-held drills. This enables larger drill bits to be used and also speeds up drilling with smaller bits.

For most drill presses—especially those meant for woodworking or home use—speed change is achieved by manually moving a belt across a stepped pulley arrangement. Some drill presses add a third stepped pulley to increase the number of available speeds. Modern drill presses can, however, use a variable-speed motor in conjunction with the stepped-pulley system. Medium-duty drill presses such as those used in machine shop (tool room) applications are equipped with a continuously variable transmission. This mechanism is based on variable-diameter pulleys driving a wide, heavy-duty belt. This gives a wide speed range as well as the ability to change speed while the machine is running. Heavy-duty drill presses used for metalworking are usually of the gear-head type described below.

Drill presses are often used for miscellaneous workshop tasks other than drilling holes. This includes sanding, honing, and polishing. These tasks can be performed by mounting sanding drums, honing wheels and various other rotating accessories in the chuck. This can be unsafe in some cases, as the chuck arbor, which may be retained in the spindle solely by the friction of a taper fit, may dislodge during operation if the side loads are too high.

====Geared head====
A geared head drill press transmits power from the motor to the spindle through spur gearing inside the machine&#x27;s head, eliminating a flexible drive belt. This assures a positive drive at all times and minimizes maintenance. Gear head drills are intended for metalworking applications where the drilling forces are higher and the desired speed (RPM) is lower than that used for woodworking.

Levers attached to one side of the head are used to select different gear ratios to change the spindle speed, usually in conjunction with a two- or three-speed motor (this varies with the material). Most machines of this type are designed to be operated on three-phase electric power and are generally of more rugged construction than equivalently sized belt-driven units. Virtually all examples have geared racks for adjusting the table and head position on the column.

Geared head drill presses are commonly found in tool rooms and other commercial environments where a heavy duty machine capable of production drilling and quick setup changes is required. In most cases, the spindle is machined to accept Morse taper tooling for greater flexibility. Larger geared head drill presses are frequently fitted with power feed on the quill mechanism, with an arrangement to disengage the feed when a certain drill depth has been achieved or in the event of excessive travel. Some gear-head drill presses have the ability to perform tapping operations without the need for an external tapping attachment. This feature is commonplace on larger gear head drill presses. A clutch mechanism drives the tap into the part under power and then backs it out of the threaded hole once the proper depth is reached. Coolant systems are also common on these machines to prolong tool life under production conditions.

====Radial arm====
A radial arm drill press is a large geared-head drill press in which the head can be moved along an arm that radiates from the machine&#x27;s column. As it is possible to swing the arm relative to the machine&#x27;s base, a radial arm drill press is able to operate over a large area without having to reposition the workpiece. This feature saves considerable time because it is much faster to reposition the machine&#x27;s head than it is to unclamp, move, and then re-clamp the workpiece to the table. The size of work that can be handled may be considerable, as the arm can swing out of the way of the table, allowing an overhead crane or derrick to place a bulky workpiece on the table or base. A vise may be used with a radial arm drill press, but more often the workpiece is secured directly to the table or base, or is held in a fixture.

Power spindle feed is nearly universal with these machines and coolant systems are common. Larger-size machines often have power feed motors for elevating or moving the arm. The biggest radial arm drill presses are able to drill holes as large as four inches or 100mm diameter in solid steel or cast iron. Radial arm drill presses are specified by the diameter of the column and the length of the arm. The length of the arm is usually the same as the maximum throat distance. The radial arm drill press pictured to the right has a 9-inch diameter and a 3-foot-long arm. The maximum throat distance of this machine would be approximately 36 inches, giving a maximum swing of 72 inches (6 feet or 1.8m).

====Magnetic drill press====

A magnetic drill is a portable machine for drilling holes in large and heavy workpieces which are difficult to move or bring to a stationary conventional drilling machine. It has a magnetic base and drills holes with the help of cutting tools like annular cutters (broach cutters) or with twist drill bits. There are various types depending on their operations and specializations, like magnetic drilling / tapping machines, cordless, pneumatic, compact horizontal, automatic feed, cross table base etc.

====Mill====
Mill drills are a lighter alternative to a milling machine. They combine a drill press (belt driven) with the X/Y coordinate abilities of the milling machine&#x27;s table and a locking collet that ensures that the cutting tool will not fall from the spindle when lateral forces are experienced against the bit. Although they are light in construction, they have the advantages of being space-saving and versatile as well as inexpensive, being suitable for light machining that may otherwise not be affordable.

==Surgical==
Drills are used in surgery to remove or create holes in bone; specialties that use them include dentistry, orthopedic surgery and neurosurgery. The development of surgical drill technology has followed that of industrial drilling, including transitions to the use of lasers, endoscopy, use of advanced imaging technologies to guide drilling, and robotic drills.

==Accessories==
Drills are often used simply as motors to drive a variety of applications, in much the same way that tractors with generic PTOs are used to power ploughs, mowers, trailers, etc.

Accessories available for drills include:
* Screw-driving tips of various kinds – flathead, Philips, etc. for driving screws in or out
* Water pumps
* Nibblers for cutting metal sheet
* Rotary sanding discs
* Rotary polishing discs
* Rotary cleaning brushes

== Drill bits ==

Some of the main drill bit types are
* twist drill bits – a general purpose drill bit for making holes in wood, plastic, metals, concrete and more
* Counterbore Drill Bits – a drill bit used to enlarge existing holes
* Countersink Drill Bits – a drill bit to create a wide opening for a screw
* High-Speed Drill Bits – these are drill bits made to be very strong and therefore are often used to cut metals
* Spade drill Bits – spade-shaped drill bits used primarily to bore holes in softwoods
* Hole Saw – a large drill bit with a jagged edge, ideal for cutting larger holes (mostly in wood).

==Capacity==
Drilling capacity indicates the maximum diameter a given power drill or drill press can produce in a certain material. It is essentially a proxy for the continuous torque the machine is capable of producing. Typically a given drill will have its capacity specified for different materials, i.e., 10 mm for steel, 25 mm for wood, etc.

For example, the maximum recommended capacities for the DeWalt DCD790 cordless drill for specific drill bit types and materials are as follows:

<doc id="205130" wikidata="Q1165506" url="?curid=205130" title="Ike &amp; Tina Turner">
<text>Ike &amp; Tina Turner was an American musical duo consisting of husband-and-wife Ike Turner and Tina Turner. From 1960 to 1976, they performed live as the Ike &amp; Tina Turner Revue, supported by Ike Turner&#x27;s band, the Kings of Rhythm, and backing vocalists, the Ikettes. The Ike &amp; Tina Turner Revue was regarded as &quot;one of the most potent live acts on the R&amp;B circuit.&quot;

The duo had a string of R&amp;B hits with their early recordings &quot;A Fool In Love&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s Gonna Work Out Fine&quot;, &quot;I Idolize You&quot;, &quot;Poor Fool&quot;, and &quot;Tra La La La La&quot;. The release of &quot;River Deep – Mountain High&quot; in 1966, followed by a tour of the UK with The Rolling Stones, increased their popularity in Europe. Their later works are noted for interpretive soul-infused re-arrangements of rock songs such as &quot;Come Together&quot;, &quot;Honky Tonk Woman&quot;, and &quot;Proud Mary&quot;, the latter of which won them a Grammy Award in 1972. Ike &amp; Tina Turner received the first Golden European Record Award for their international hit &quot;Nutbush City Limits&quot; in 1974. They released dozens of albums; their most successful by chart performance being &quot;Workin&#x27; Together&quot;. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; listed their album &quot;River Deep – Mountain High&quot; among the best of its era. In spite of their success, they had a tumultuous marriage and the duo split in 1976. Following their divorce, Tina went on to enjoy a highly successful solo career.

Ike &amp; Tina Turner were inducted to the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame in 1991. They have two singles inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame, &quot;River Deep – Mountain High&quot; and &quot;Proud Mary&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked them No. 2 on its list of the 20 Greatest Duos of All Time.

Ike died on December 12, 2007, at the age of 76, while Tina died on May 24, 2023, aged 83.

==Career==
===1954–1959: Origins===
In 1954, musician and bandleader Ike Turner visited his sister Lee Ethel Knight in St. Louis, Missouri. Soon after, he returned with his band, the Kings of Rhythm, to perform at Ned Love&#x27;s club in East St. Louis, Illinois. Love eventually convinced Turner to relocate his band from Clarksdale, Mississippi. By 1956, Turner and his band became one of the most popular live attractions in the St. Louis and neighboring East St. Louis club scene. Prior to his move, Turner worked as a talent scout and session musician for Sun Records, Modern Records, and RPM Records. Around this time, Ann Bullock had moved to St. Louis from Brownsville, Tennessee. She began attending a predominantly African American nightclub, Club Manhattan, where she saw the Kings of Rhythm for the first time. She later recalled that she &quot;almost went into a trance&quot; watching Turner play.

Bullock eventually got to know Turner and his band. Bullock, who had tried to convince Turner to let her perform onstage with him, was given a microphone from the band&#x27;s drummer Eugene Washington. Washington was the boyfriend of Bullock&#x27;s sister Alline Bullock, who was a bartender at the club. Turner was playing B.B. King&#x27;s &quot;You Know I Love You&quot; on the organ when Bullock chimed in. He was taken aback by her strong voice which was in contrast to her skinny frame. He asked her if she knew more songs, and by the end of the night she had joined the Kings of Rhythm. Still in high school, Bullock performed with Turner on weekends at all of the local clubs. She was one of many other vocalists, mostly male, who would front the band at times. She began dating Turner&#x27;s saxophonist Raymond Hill, with whom she had her first child, Craig Raymond Turner, born in 1958.

In 1958, Bullock sang on &quot;Boxtop&quot; under the name &quot;Little Ann&quot;. The single was released on the St. Louis label, Tune Town Records. Bullock later moved into Turner&#x27;s home in East St. Louis, where she was trained by him on vocal control and performance. They developed a close friendship, and acted more like &quot;brother and sister&quot;. However, their friendship eventually turned into a romantic relationship and she became pregnant in January 1960.

=== 1960–1965: Early success ===
In March 1960, Ike scheduled his band to record a song he wrote, titled &quot;A Fool In Love&quot;, for singer Art Lassiter. Lassiter failed to show up for the recording session at Technisonic Studios in St. Louis. Having already booked the studio time, Ike allowed Bullock to record the song as a demo with Lassiter&#x27;s backing vocalists, the Artettes: Robbie Montgomery, Frances Hodges, and Sandra Harding. During a gig at the Club Manhattan in East St. Louis, Ike played the record which caught the attention of local disc jockey Dave Dixon from the radio station KATZ. Dixon asked Ike to let him send the record to Juggy Murray, the president of Sue Records in New York. Murray was impressed by Bullock&#x27;s vocal delivery and bought the rights to the song. Murray offered Ike a $20,000 advance, convincing him to keep Bullock&#x27;s vocals on the record and suggested that he &quot;make her the star&quot; of his show. This prompted Ike to rename her Tina Turner, however, family and friends still called her Ann. He then trademarked the name for protection, so that if she left he could hire another female artist and have her perform under the moniker &quot;Tina Turner&quot;. He chose the name Tina because it rhymed with Sheena, his favorite character, Sheena, Queen of the Jungle. At first they were going to use &quot;Ike Turner and Tina&quot; on the record, but Murray suggested that &quot;Ike and Tina Turner&quot; sounded better. Tina had reservations about continuing her relationship with Ike. According to Tina, after she expressed her concern, Ike responded by hitting her in the head with a wooden shoe stretcher.

&quot;A Fool In Love&quot; became an immediate hit after its release in July 1960, reaching No. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot R&amp;B Sides on August 15. Ike formed the Ike &amp; Tina Turner Revue, which included the Kings of Rhythm, male vocalist Jimmy Thomas, and a trio of female vocalists called the Ikettes. As the single climbed the pop chart they went from playing in clubs to theaters such as the Apollo Theater in Harlem. On October 3, they made their first national television debut on &quot;American Bandstand&quot; when Tina was over eight months pregnant. &quot;A Fool In Love&quot; peaked at No. 27 on the Hot 100 on October 17, eventually selling a million copies. Journalist Kurt Loder described the song as &quot;the blackest record to creep into the white pop charts since Ray Charles&#x27;s gospel-styled &#x27;What&#x27;d I Say&#x27; the previous summer.&quot; On October 27, Tina gave birth to their son Ronald &quot;Ronnie&quot; Renelle Turner.

The success of the single was followed with another hit, &quot;I Idolize You&quot; and the release of their debut album &quot;The Soul of Ike &amp; Tina Turner&quot; in February 1961. That same month, before a gig at Howard Theatre in Washington, D.C., Tina decided to have her hair bleached, but a miscue resulted in her hair falling out. To cover up the incident Ike bought Tina a wig, which became incorporated into her stage appearance. In June 1961, the duo released their next hit, &quot;It&#x27;s Gonna Work Out Fine&quot;. Juggy Murray is credited as the sole producer, but the R&amp;B duo Mickey &amp; Sylvia also contributed to the song. It became Ike and Tina&#x27;s second million-seller, and earned them their first Grammy nomination for Best Rock and Roll Recording at the 4th Annual Grammy Awards.

The Ike &amp; Tina Turner Revue toured a grueling series of one-nighters throughout the United States on the Chitlin&#x27; Circuit, breaking racial barriers by performing in front of integrated audiences in the Deep South. Follow-up top 10 R&amp;B hits in 1962 include &quot;Poor Fool&quot; and &quot;Tra La La La La&quot;. Thanks to the addition of singers Stacy Johnson and Vernon Guy, Tina and the Ikettes who at this point comprised Robbie Montgomery, Venetta Fields, and Jessie Smith, began incorporating dance routines into the act. During this period, the revue build a reputation as one of the most explosive R&amp;B ensembles. Their live performances were a musical spectacle comparable to the style of James Brown and the Famous Flames.

In 1962, Ike and Tina married in Tijuana, Mexico, and moved their entire band to Los Angeles. In November 1962, Ike and Tina filed a $330,000 joint lawsuit with Placid Music Corporation against Sue Records, Saturn Music, and Juggy Murray for &quot;failing and refusing to give an accounting and pay certain royalties.&quot; They also charged that Sue &quot;withheld and concealed over $100,000&quot; of their earnings from them. In 1963, their last two albums they previously recorded were issued on Sue, &quot;Don&#x27;t Play Me Cheap&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s Gonna Work Out Fine&quot;. Also in 1963, Ike purchased a home in View Park with an advance given by Murray for a renewed contract which they didn&#x27;t sign. Instead, the duo severed ties with Murray who had been their manager during their Sue tenure. In 1964, they signed to Warner Bros. Records and hired Bob Krasnow as their manager.

To make sure he always had a record out while on tour, Ike formed various labels such as Teena, Prann, Innis, Sony, Sonja Records. He released singles from vocalists within the revue and other groups as well. While Ike constantly recorded the revue, they performed 300 days out of the year to make up for lack of hit records. The personnel of the Kings of Rhythm and the lineup of Ikettes changed often. In the mid-1960s, Jimi Hendrix briefly played backing guitar in the band.

In 1964, Ike and Tina had modest R&amp;B hits with &quot;You Can&#x27;t Miss Nothing That You Never Had&quot; and &quot;A Fool For A Fool&quot;. They released their first live album, &quot;Ike &amp; Tina Turner Revue Live&quot;, on Kent in November 1964. It was their first album to chart, reaching No. 90 on the &quot;Cash Box&quot; Top 100. Their first &quot;Billboard&quot; charting album, &quot;Live! The Ike &amp; Tina Turner Show&quot;, was released in January 1965 on Warner Bros. Records. It reached No. 126 on &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LP&#x27;s and No. 8 on Hot R&amp;B LP&#x27;s in February 1965. In 1965, the duo had two top 40 &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B hits with &quot;Tell Her I&#x27;m Not Home&quot; on Loma Records and &quot;Good Bye, So Long&quot; on Modern Records. Later that year, they re-signed to Sue and released the single &quot;Two Is A Couple&quot;, which peaked at No. 15 on the &quot;Cash Box&quot; R&amp;B chart.

Throughout 1965, the Ike &amp; Tina Turner Revue performed on several teen rock and roll television shows including &quot;Shindig!&quot;, &quot;Hollywood a Go Go&quot;, and &quot;American Bandstand&quot;. Tina and the Ikettes improved their choreography by incorporating high energy dance routines. Phil Spector had seen them perform at a club on the Sunset Strip and invited them to appear in the concert film &quot;The Big T.N.T. Show&quot; which was filmed on November 29–30, 1965. By the end of the year, the official incarnation of the Ikettes abruptly left and eventually formed the Mirettes. Ike hired another set of Ikettes: Pat Arnold (a.k.a. P. P. Arnold), Gloria Scott, and Maxine Smith.

===1966–1969: Career development===

Eager to produce Tina, Phil Spector negotiated a deal with Ike and Tina&#x27;s manager Bob Krasnow, who was head of Loma Records. Spector offered $20,000 to release them from their contract and for creative control over his sessions with Tina. After their release from Loma, they signed to Spector&#x27;s Philles Records label. On March 7, 1966, Tina began recording the Phil Spector/Ellie Greenwich/Jeff Barry composition &quot;River Deep – Mountain High&quot; at Gold Star Studios in Hollywood. The single failed to chart successfully in the United States, reaching No. 88 on the Hot 100. The disappointing chart performance caused the album, &quot;River Deep – Mountain High&quot;, to be shelved in America where it wasn&#x27;t released until 1969. However, in Britain, the song became a hit, reaching No. 3 on the UK charts. It also reached No. 1 on Los 40 Principales in Spain. Due to popular demand, Spector released the album in the UK on London Records in September 1966 with liner notes written by Decca&#x27;s promotion man Tony Hall. Hall included a quote from Spector stating, &quot;We can only assume that England is more appreciative of talent and exciting music than the U.S.&quot;.

Following their chart success in Britain, they toured with the Rolling Stones as an opening act on their 1966 UK Tour. The successful 12-date tour began at the Royal Albert Hall on September 23 and concluded on October 9 at the Gaumont Theatre. After the tour, the Turners performed at California Ballroom and toured Britain&#x27;s club circuit to receptive crowds at Tiles, Ricky-Tick and the Mojo Club. When they returned to the US, they were involved in a serious bus accident while on the road in Wichita, Kansas. A few band members were hospitalized, so Turner recruited members from St. Louis to continue the tour. By 1967, the revue started to book bigger venues in the United States. They performed a series of &quot;exclusive deals&quot; during this period, to help increase their finances. As their careers were rising, their personal relationship was deteriorating and Tina attempted suicide before a show in 1968.

In 1968, Bob Krasnow founded Blue Thumb Records, and Ike gave him enough masters for two albums. The first album, &quot;Outta Season&quot;, peaked at No. 43 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B LP&#x27;s chart. It produced the duo&#x27;s cover of Otis Redding&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;ve Been Loving You Too Long&quot;, which peaked at No. 23 on the R&amp;B singles chart. In March 1969, Ike and Tina performed at the Grand Gala du Disque in Amsterdam. In May 1969, Ike and the Kings of Rhythm released the album &quot;A Black Man&#x27;s Soul&quot; on Pompeii Records. The album earned Ike his first solo Grammy nomination for Best R&amp;B Instrumental Performance at the 12th Annual Grammy Awards.

In August 1969, the duo headlined at International Hotel&#x27;s Casino Theatre in Las Vegas. It was in Vegas that Ike, who up to that point had lived a drug and alcohol-free life, began using cocaine. He later recalled that he was introduced to the drug by &quot;two famous Las Vegas headliners&quot;.

In September 1969, A&amp;M Records reissued the album &quot;River Deep – Mountain High&quot;, and for the first time it was issued in the US. It was successful, reaching No. 28 on the R&amp;B albums chart. The next month &quot;The Hunter&quot; was released on Blue Thumb, one of their most blues-oriented albums which features electric blues guitarist Albert Collins. The title track, &quot;The Hunter&quot;, an Albert King cover, reached No. 37 in the R&amp;B singles chart. The album peaked at No. 47 on the R&amp;B albums chart and earned Tina her first solo Grammy nomination for Best R&amp;B Vocal Performance, Female at the 12th Annual Grammy Awards.

In 1969, Ike and Tina began performing at rock festivals. They performed at the Newport Pop Festival in Northridge, the Seattle Pop Festival in Woodinville, and the Gold Rush rock music festival in Amador County. In November 1969, Ike and Tina reportedly upstaged the Rolling Stones as the opening act on their 1969 US Tour. Tina emerged as a sex symbol and was praised for sensuality on stage. Their erotic performance of &quot;I&#x27;ve Been Loving You Too Long&quot;, filmed during a concert at Madison Square Garden, is featured in the Rolling Stones&#x27; 1970 documentary &quot;Gimme Shelter&quot;. During a concert at Madison Square Garden, Janis Joplin joined the Turners on stage for an impromptu performance of &quot;Land of 1000 Dances.&quot; Ike and Tina added rock songs by the Rolling Stones and the Beatles to their repertoire, which was receptive among crowds. Their new label, Minit Records, responded by rushing the release of a studio version of &quot;Come Together&quot;.

===1970–1976: Mainstream success===
In January 1970, Ike and Tina performed on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;. Their performance of &quot;Bold Soul Sister&quot; propelled the single to No. 22 on the R&amp;B chart. In March, their single &quot;Come Together&quot; peaked at No. 21 on the R&amp;B chart. Due to the success of their singles, they were signed to Minit&#x27;s parent label Liberty Records. In April 1970, their first album on Liberty, &quot;Come Together&quot;, was released, reaching No. 13 on the R&amp;B albums chart. Their next single &quot;I Want to Take You Higher&quot; originally by Sly and the Family Stone was released in May 1970. It charted higher on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 than the original. The revue&#x27;s performance fee increased from $1,000 a night to $5,000 a night following their successful run. In July, they headlined the Newport Jazz Festival in Rhode Island and the Schaefer Music Festival at New York&#x27;s Central Park. That Summer, they were featured in the Isley Brothers concert film &quot;It&#x27;s Your Thing&quot; and they filmed Miloš Forman&#x27;s &quot;Taking Off&quot; (1971). In October 1970, they headlined the Soul Bowl at Tulane University&#x27;s Sugar Bowl Stadium; a concert to raise money for disadvantaged minority students. Later that year, they made their first trip to Asia to perform in Siam, China, Japan, and the Philippines.

Ike and Tina began performing Creedence Clearwater Revival&#x27;s &quot;Proud Mary&quot; during their shows in 1969. Ike wasn&#x27;t fond of the original version, but he liked the cover version by Checkmates, Ltd. Ike and Tina released their version on the album &quot;Workin&#x27; Together&quot; in November 1970. Set at first to a slow acoustic rendition sung softly by both Ike and Tina, the song then transformed into a frenetic rock and soul dervish led by Tina and the Ikettes. The single was released in January 1971, reaching No. 4 on the Hot 100 and No. 5 on the R&amp;B chart. It sold more than a million copies, becoming the duo&#x27;s best-selling single to date and won them a Grammy Award for Best R&amp;B Vocal Performance by a Group at the 14th Annual Grammy Awards. &quot;Workin&#x27; Together&quot; became their most successful studio album, peaking at No. 25 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. It includes the duo&#x27;s social conscious title track, &quot;Workin&#x27; Together&quot;, &quot;Funkier Than A Mosquita&#x27;s Tweeter&quot; penned by Tina&#x27;s sister Alline Bullock, and notable covers such as &quot;Get Back&quot; and &quot;Let It Be&quot; by the Beatles.

In January 1971, Ike and Tina embarked on a European tour that included dates at Midem in Cannes, the Palais d&#x27;Hiver in Lyon, and the Olympia in Paris. Their performances received rave reviews. The conservative Le Monde described Ike and Tina as &quot;the voice of desire&quot;. Their concert at the Olympia was recorded and released as the album &quot;Live In Paris&quot;. While in Paris the Turners received the French Jazz Academy Soul award.

Ike and Tina participated in the concert celebrating Ghana&#x27;s 14th Independence Day on March 6, 1971. The concert was filmed and released as &quot;Soul To Soul&quot; in theaters in August 1971. The following month the soundtrack &quot;Soul To Soul&quot; was released which featured the Turners. The album peaked at No. 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Soul LP&#x27;s chart.

In May 1971, Ike and Tina were the opening act for Johnny Mathis at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas; performing for the first time in a main showroom at the hotel. Earlier in the year Liberty Records was absorbed into United Artists Records, where Ike and Tina would remain as a duo. Their first release for the label was the live album, &quot;What You Hear Is What You Get&quot;, recorded during their concert at Carnegie Hall in April 1971. It peaked at No. 25 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and No. 7 on the R&amp;B chart. The album was certified Gold by the RIAA in 1972. In July 1971, Ike and Tina filmed a concert during the Schaefer Music Festival at Central Park. It aired as &quot;Good Vibrations from Central Park&quot; on ABC-TV in August 1971. Also in 1971, they had a top 40 R&amp;B hits with &quot;Ooh Poo Pah Doo&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Yours (Use Me Anyway You Wanna)&quot;. In November 1971, Ike and Tina released the album &quot;&#x27;Nuff Said&quot;. Around this time, the Kings of Rhythm were renamed the Family Vibes. In February 1972, the Turners officially opened their recording studio, Bolic Sound, to the public. The facilities had already been in use for Turner productions since 1970. A few months later they released the album &quot;Feel Good&quot;. Nine out of the ten tracks on the album were written by Tina. In August, they performed at Nassau County&#x27;s first major rock festival, Festival of Hope Rockfest, at Roosevelt Raceway to benefit crippled children. In October, they performed &quot;It&#x27;s Gonna Work Out Fine&quot; on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;, which was included on the album &quot;Here&#x27;s Johnny: Magic Moments From the Tonight Show&quot;. The duo had moderate R&amp;B chart success with the Tina penned &quot;Up in Heah&quot; in 1972 and a cover of Little Richard&#x27;s &quot;Early One Morning&quot; in 1973.In August 1973, they released their hit record &quot;Nutbush City Limits&quot; which was written by Tina. It peaked at No. 22 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and No. 11 on the R&amp;B chart. The single was even more successful in Europe, reaching No. 4 in the UK and No. 1 in Austria. It was also a top 5 hit in several other countries. In 1974, the Turners received the Golden European Record Award, the first ever given, for selling more than one million records of &quot;Nutbush City Limits&quot; in Europe. Their follow-up singles &quot;Sweet Rhode Island Red&quot; and &quot;Sexy Ida&quot; did well on the R&amp;B chart and in Europe.

In April 1974, Ike and Tina released the album &quot;The Gospel According to Ike &amp; Tina Turner&quot;. A few months later in September, Tina released her first solo album titled &quot;Tina Turns the Country On!&quot;. Both albums received Grammy nominations at the 17th Annual Grammy Awards. Their gospel album was nominated for Best Soul Gospel Performance. Ike also earned a solo nomination for his single &quot;Father Alone&quot;. Tina was nominated for Best R&amp;B Vocal Performance, Female for her solo album.

In 1975, the revue began billing themselves as the Ike &amp; Tina Turner Explosion. In February 1975, it was announced that Gerhard Augustin, co-founder of &quot;Beat-Club&quot; and former head of A&amp;R at United Artists in Munich, became Ike and Tina&#x27;s manager. He had previously co-produced a few of their singles and the album &quot;Feel Good&quot; (1972). In 1975, Tina starred as the Acid Queen in the rock opera film &quot;Tommy&quot;. To capitalize off her publicity surrounding the film, a solo album by Tina was released titled &quot;Acid Queen&quot;. The lead single &quot;Baby, Get It On&quot; became the duo&#x27;s last charting single together, peaking at No. 31 on the R&amp;B chart. It was a hit in Europe where the Turners had a strong following, reaching No. 20 in Belgium and No. 9 in the Netherlands.

In September 1975, Ike and Tina were co-headliners at the Newport Pop Festival—a March of Dimes benefit—at Orange Coast College Stadium in Costa Mesa. In January 1976, they embarked on their second Australian concert tour. In March 1976, they headlined at the Waldorf Astoria in New York City. They also signed a deal with CBS-TV for nine television shows revolving around the Ike &amp; Tina Turner Revue with the possibility of it becoming a regular series.

===1976–1978: The end of the duo===
By 1976, Ike&#x27;s cocaine addiction had caused a hole in his nasal septum, leading to nosebleeds from which he would relieve himself by using more of the drug. Ike was planning for them to leave United Artists for a new record company, Cream Records, for a reported annual amount of $150,000. The contract had a key person clause, meaning they would have to sign it in four days, keeping Tina contractually tied to Ike for five more years.

On July 1, 1976, the Ike &amp; Tina Turner Revue flew from Los Angeles to Dallas, Texas where they had a gig at the Dallas Statler Hilton. While en route to the hotel, the Turners got into a physical altercation in the car. Shortly after their arrival, Tina fled from Ike with only 36 cents and a Mobil gas card to the nearby Ramada Inn across the freeway. On July 27, 1976, Tina filed for divorce on the grounds of irreconcilable differences. Years later in her 1986 autobiography &quot;I, Tina: My Life Story&quot;, she alleged that Ike had abused her throughout their marriage. Ike claimed in his 1999 autobiography, &quot;Takin&#x27; Back My Name: The Confessions of Ike Turner&quot;, that Tina initiated their final fight by purposely irritating him so that she would have a reason to break up with him before they were scheduled to sign their new contract.

Their divorce was finalized on March 29, 1978. In the settlement, Tina gave Ike her share of their Bolic Sound recording studio, publishing companies, real estate, and he kept his four cars. Tina retained her songwriter royalties from songs she had written, but Ike received the publishing royalties for his compositions and hers. She also kept her two Jaguars, furs and jewelry along with her stage name. Tina took responsibility for the debts incurred from their missed concert dates as well as an IRS lien.

In her 1986 autobiography, Tina revealed that Turner had been abusive during their marriage. She said: &quot;It was my relationship with Ike that made me most unhappy. At first, I had really been in love with him. Look what he&#x27;d done for me. But he was totally unpredictable.&quot; Turner admitted he took Tina for granted and called her &quot;the best woman I ever knew&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jet-9/23/91&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In his autobiography, he said: &quot;Sure, I&#x27;ve slapped Tina. We had fights and there have been times when I punched her to the ground without thinking. But I never beat her.&quot; In a 1999 interview, Roseanne Barr urged him to publicly apologize to Tina on &quot;The Roseanne Barr Show&quot;. In 2007, Turner told &quot;Jet&quot; that he had written Tina an apology letter, but had never sent it. In 2018, Tina told &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; that &quot;as an old person, I have forgiven him, but I would not work with him. He asked for one more tour with me, and I said, &#x27;No, absolutely not.&#x27; Ike wasn&#x27;t someone you could forgive and allow him back in.&quot;

United Artists responded to the abrupt split by finishing albums from their last recording sessions, releasing &quot;Delilah&#x27;s Power&quot; (1977) and &quot;Airwaves&quot; (1978). In 1980, Ike released the single &quot;Party Vibes&quot;/&quot;Shame, Shame, Shame&quot; taken from &quot;The Edge&quot; (1980). The single peaked at No. 27 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Disco Top 100 chart.

After Tina&#x27;s resurgence as a solo artist in the mid-1980s, compilation albums containing unreleased material were released, including &quot;Get Back&quot; (1985) and &quot;Gold Empire&quot; (1985). &quot;Get Back&quot; reached No. 189 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Pop Albums chart.

<text>The Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance was an award presented to recording artists at the Grammy Awards from 1990 to 2011.

The academy recognized hard rock music artists for the first time at the 31st Grammy Awards in 1989. The category was originally presented as Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance Vocal or Instrumental, combining two of the most popular music genres of the 1980s. Jethro Tull won that award for the album &quot;Crest of a Knave&quot;, beating Metallica, who were expected to win with the album &quot;...And Justice for All&quot;. This choice led to widespread criticism of the academy, as journalists suggested that the music of Jethro Tull did not belong in the hard rock or heavy metal genres. In response, the academy created the categories Best Hard Rock Performance and Best Metal Performance, separating the genres.

The band Living Colour was presented the first award for Best Hard Rock Performance in 1990. From 1992 to 1994, the award was presented as the Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance with Vocal. The bands Foo Fighters, Living Colour, and the Smashing Pumpkins share the record for the most wins, with two each. American artists were presented with the award more than any other nationality, though it was also presented to musicians or groups originating from Australia twice and from the United Kingdom once. Alice in Chains holds the record for the most nominations without a win, with eight.

The award was discontinued in 2012 due to a major overhaul of Grammy categories. In 2012 and 2013, quality hard rock performances were honored in the Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance category. However, in 2014, the category was split, returning the stand-alone Best Metal Performance category and recognizing quality hard rock performances in the Best Rock Performance category. According to the Recording Academy, &quot;It was determined that metal has a very distinctive sound, and hard rock more closely aligns with rock and can exist comfortably as one end of the rock spectrum.&quot;

<text>A landscape is the visible features of an area of land, its landforms, and how they integrate with natural or human-made features, often considered in terms of their aesthetic appeal. A landscape includes the physical elements of geophysically defined landforms such as mountains, hills, water bodies such as rivers, lakes, ponds and the sea, living elements of land cover including indigenous vegetation, human elements including different forms of land use, buildings, and structures, and transitory elements such as lighting and weather conditions. Combining both their physical origins and the cultural overlay of human presence, often created over millennia, landscapes reflect a living synthesis of people and place that is vital to local and national identity.
The character of a landscape helps define the self-image of the people who inhabit it and a sense of place that differentiates one region from other regions. It is the dynamic backdrop to people&#x27;s lives. Landscape can be as varied as farmland, a landscape park or wilderness. The Earth has a vast range of landscapes including the icy landscapes of polar regions, mountainous landscapes, vast arid desert landscapes, islands, and coastal landscapes, densely forested or wooded landscapes including past boreal forests and tropical rainforests and agricultural landscapes of temperate and tropical regions. The activity of modifying the visible features of an area of land is referred to as landscaping.

==Definition and etymology==
There are several definitions of what constitutes a landscape, depending on context. In common usage however, a landscape refers either to all the visible features of an area of land (usually rural), often considered in terms of aesthetic appeal, or to a pictorial representation of an area of countryside, specifically within the genre of landscape painting. When people deliberately improve the aesthetic appearance of a piece of land—by changing contours and vegetation, etc.—it is said to have been landscaped, though the result may not constitute a landscape according to some definitions.

Color landscapes blend artificial elements like buildings, roads, and pavements with natural features such as mountains, forests, plants, sky, and rivers. These compositions of distant and near views can significantly impact people&#x27;s emotions. As urbanization rapidly advances, urban color landscape design has become essential for cities to differentiate and symbolize their unique character and atmosphere. However, this transformation has created challenges. First, the traditional color landscapes in some cities have been heavily influenced by natural geography, climate, local materials, ethnic culture, religion, and socioeconomic factors. Second, the growing problem of &quot;color pollution&quot; - through bright, solid-colored buildings, billboards, and lighting clusters - adversely affects people physically and psychologically. Third, homogenization of colors between cities is causing a loss of cultural identity, as many modern buildings share similar palettes, diluting local characteristics. Researchers have proposed more unified cityscape approaches to address these color landscape issues and help cities preserve their distinctive identities and create vibrant, emotionally engaging urban environments.

The word &quot;landscape&quot; (&quot;landscipe&quot; or &quot;landscaef&quot;) arrived in England—and therefore into the English language—after the fifth century, following the arrival of the Anglo-Saxons; these terms referred to a system of human-made spaces on the land. The term &quot;landscape&quot; emerged around the turn of the sixteenth century to denote a painting whose primary subject matter was natural scenery. &quot;Land&quot; (a word from Germanic origin) may be taken in its sense of something to which people belong (as in England being the land of the English). The suffix &quot;-scape&quot; is equivalent to the more common English suffix &quot;-ship.&quot; The roots of &quot;-ship&quot; are etymologically akin to Old English &quot;sceppan&quot; or &quot;scyppan&quot;, meaning &quot;to shape&quot;. The suffix &quot;-schaft&quot; is related to the verb &quot;schaffen&quot;, so that &quot;-ship&quot; and &quot;shape&quot; are also etymologically linked. The modern form of the word, with its connotations of scenery, appeared in the late sixteenth century when the term &quot;landschap&quot; was introduced by Dutch painters who used it to refer to paintings of inland natural or rural scenery. The word &quot;landscape&quot;, first recorded in 1598, was borrowed from a Dutch painters&#x27; term. The popular conception of the &quot;landscape&quot; that is reflected in dictionaries conveys both a particular and a general meaning, the particular referring to an area of the Earth&#x27;s surface and the general being that which can be seen by an observer. An example of this second usage can be found as early as 1662 in the Book of Common Prayer:
::Could we but climb where Moses stood,
::And view the landscape over.
::: (General Hymns, verse 536). 
There are several words that are frequently associated with the word landscape:
* Scenery: The natural features of a landscape considered in terms of their appearance, esp. when picturesque: spectacular views of mountain scenery.
* Setting: In works of narrative (especially fictional), it includes the historical moment in time and geographic location in which a story takes place, and helps initiate the main backdrop and mood for a story.
* Picturesque: The word literally means &quot;in the manner of a picture; fit to be made into a picture&quot;, and used as early as 1703 (&quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;), and derived from an Italian term &quot;pittoresco&quot;, &quot;in the manner of a painter&quot;. Gilpin&#x27;s &quot;Essay on Prints&quot; (1768) defined &quot;picturesque&quot; as &quot;a term expressive of that peculiar kind of beauty, which is agreeable in a picture&quot; (p. xii).
* A view: &quot;A sight or prospect of some landscape or extended scene; an extent or area covered by the eye from one point&quot; (OED).
* Wilderness: An uncultivated, uninhabited, and inhospitable region. See also Natural landscape.
* Cityscape (also townscape): The urban equivalent of a landscape. In the visual arts a cityscape (urban landscape) is an artistic representation, such as a painting, drawing, print or photograph, of the physical aspects of a city or urban area.
* Seascape: A photograph, painting, or other work of art which depicts the sea, in other words an example of marine art.

==Physical landscape==

===Geomorphology: The physical evolution of landscape===
Geomorphology is the scientific study of the origin and evolution of topographic and bathymetric features created by physical or chemical processes operating at or near Earth&#x27;s surface. Geomorphologists seek to understand why landscapes look the way they do, to understand landform history and dynamics and to predict changes through a combination of field observations, physical experiments and numerical modeling. Geomorphology is practiced within physical geography, geology, geodesy, engineering geology, archaeology and geotechnical engineering. This broad base of interests contributes to many research styles and interests within the field.

The surface of Earth is modified by a combination of surface processes that sculpt landscapes, and geologic processes that cause tectonic uplift and subsidence, and shape the coastal geography. Surface processes comprise the action of water, wind, ice, fire, and living things on the surface of the Earth, along with chemical reactions that form soils and alter material properties, the stability and rate of change of topography under the force of gravity, and other factors, such as (in the very recent past) human alteration of the landscape. Many of these factors are strongly mediated by climate. Geologic processes include the uplift of mountain ranges, the growth of volcanoes, isostatic changes in land surface elevation (sometimes in response to surface processes), and the formation of deep sedimentary basins where the surface of Earth drops and is filled with material eroded from other parts of the landscape. The Earth surface and its topography therefore are an intersection of climatic, hydrologic, and biologic action with geologic processes.

===Landscape ecology===
Landscape ecology is the science of studying and improving relationships between ecological processes in the environment and particular ecosystems. This is done within a variety of landscape scales, development spatial patterns, and organizational levels of research and policy.

Landscape is a central concept in landscape ecology. It is, however, defined in quite different ways. For example: Carl Troll conceives of landscape not as a mental construct but as an objectively given &#x27;organic entity&#x27;, a &quot;harmonic individuum of space&quot;. 
Ernst Neef defines landscapes as sections within the uninterrupted earth-wide interconnection of geofactors which are defined as such on the basis of their uniformity in terms of a specific land use, and are thus defined in an anthropocentric and relativistic way.

According to Richard Forman and Michael Godron, a landscape is a heterogeneous land area composed of a cluster of interacting ecosystems that is repeated in similar form throughout, whereby they list woods, meadows, marshes and villages as examples of a landscape&#x27;s ecosystems, and state that a landscape is an area at least a few kilometres wide. 
John A. Wiens opposes the traditional view expounded by Carl Troll, Isaak S. Zonneveld, Zev Naveh, Richard T. T. Forman/Michel Godron and others that landscapes are arenas in which humans interact with their environments on a kilometre-wide scale; instead, he defines &#x27;landscape&#x27;—regardless of scale—as &quot;the template on which spatial patterns influence ecological processes&quot;.
Some define &#x27;landscape&#x27; as an area containing two or more ecosystems in close proximity.

===Landscape science===
The discipline of landscape science has been described as &quot;bring[ing] landscape ecology and urban ecology together with other disciplines and cross-disciplinary fields to identify patterns and understand social-ecological processes influencing landscape change&quot;. A 2000 paper entitled &quot;Geography and landscape science&quot; states that &quot;The whole of the disciplines involved in landscape research will be referred to as landscape science, although this term was used first in 1885 by the geographers Oppel and Troll&quot;. A 2013 guest editorial defines landscape science as &quot;research that seeks to understand the relationship between people and their environment, with a focus on land use change and data pertaining to land resources at the landscape scale&quot;. The &quot;Great Soviet Encyclopedia&quot; of 1979 defines landscape science as &quot;the branch of physical geography that deals with natural territorial complexes (or geographic complexes, geosystems) as structural parts of the earth&#x27;s geographic mantle&quot; and states that &quot;The basis of landscape science is the theory that the geographic landscape is the primary element in the physicogeo-graphical differentiation of the earth. Landscape science deals with the origin, structure, and dynamics of landscapes, the laws of the development and arrangement of landscapes, and the transformation of landscapes by the economic activity of man.&quot;, and asserts that it was founded in Russia in the early 20th century by L. S. Berg and others, and outside Russia by the German S. Passarge. The conception of landscape as the relationship between various components of natural environments and geochemisty was devoted by soviet scientist Viktor Sochava, based on the ideas of american geographer George Van Dyne 

===Integrated landscape management===
Integrated landscape management is a way of managing a landscape that brings together multiple stakeholders, who collaborate to integrate policy and practice for their different land use objectives, with the purpose of achieving sustainable landscapes. It recognises that, for example, one river basin can supply water for towns and agriculture, timber and food crops for smallholders and industry, and habitat for biodiversity; the way in which each one of these sectors pursues its goals can have impacts on the others. The intention is to minimise conflict between these different land use objectives and ecosystem services. This approach draws on landscape ecology, as well as many related fields that also seek to integrate different land uses and users, such as watershed management.

Proponents of integrated landscape management argue that it is well-suited to address complex global challenges, such as those that are the focus of the Sustainable Development Goals. Integrated landscape management is increasingly taken up at the national, local and international level, for example the UN Environment Programme states that &quot;UNEP champions the landscape approach de facto as it embodies the main elements of integrated ecosystem management&quot;.

===Landscape archaeology===
Landscape archaeology or landscape history is the study of the way in which humanity has changed the physical appearance of the environment - both present and past. Landscape generally refers to both natural environments and environments constructed by human beings. Natural landscapes are considered to be environments that have not been altered by humans in any shape or form. Cultural landscapes, on the other hand, are environments that have been altered in some manner by people (including temporary structures and places, such as campsites, that are created by human beings). Among archaeologists, the term landscape can refer to the meanings and alterations people mark onto their surroundings. As such, landscape archaeology is often employed to study the human use of land over extensive periods of time.
Landscape archaeology can be summed up by Nicole Branton&#x27;s statement: 
:&quot;the landscapes in landscape archaeology may be as small as a single household or garden or as large as an empire&quot;, and &quot;although resource exploitation, class, and power are frequent topics of landscape archaeology, landscape approaches are concerned with spatial, not necessarily ecological or economic, relationships. While similar to settlement archaeology and ecological archaeology, landscape approaches model places and spaces as dynamic participants in past behavior, not merely setting (affecting human action), or artifact (affected by human action)&quot;.

===Cultural landscape===

The concept of cultural landscapes can be found in the European tradition of landscape painting. From the 16th century onwards, many European artists painted landscapes in favor of people, diminishing the people in their paintings to figures subsumed within broader, regionally specific landscapes.

The geographer Otto Schlüter is credited with having first formally used &quot;cultural landscape&quot; as an academic term in the early 20th century. In 1908, Schlüter argued that by defining geography as a &quot;Landschaftskunde&quot; (landscape science) this would give geography a logical subject matter shared by no other discipline. He defined two forms of landscape: the &quot;Urlandschaft&quot; (transl. original landscape) or landscape that existed before major human induced changes and the &quot;Kulturlandschaft&quot; (transl. &#x27;cultural landscape&#x27;) a landscape created by human culture. The major task of geography was to trace the changes in these two landscapes.

It was Carl O. Sauer, a human geographer, who was probably the most influential in promoting and developing the idea of cultural landscapes. Sauer was determined to stress the agency of culture as a force in shaping the visible features of the Earth&#x27;s surface in delimited areas. Within his definition, the physical environment retains a central significance, as the medium with and through which human cultures act. His classic definition of a &#x27;cultural landscape&#x27; reads as follows:
The cultural landscape is fashioned from a natural landscape by a cultural group. Culture is the agent, the natural area is the medium, the cultural landscape is the result.

A cultural landscape, as defined by the World Heritage Committee, is the &quot;cultural properties [that] represent the combined works of nature and of man.&quot;

The World Heritage Committee identifies three categories of cultural landscape, ranging from (i) those landscapes most deliberately &#x27;shaped&#x27; by people, through (ii) full range of &#x27;combined&#x27; works, to (iii) those least evidently &#x27;shaped&#x27; by people (yet highly valued). The three categories extracted from the Committee&#x27;s Operational Guidelines, are as follows:

# &quot;A landscape designed and created intentionally by man&quot;;
# an &quot;organically evolved landscape&quot; which may be a &quot;relict (or fossil) landscape&quot; or a &quot;continuing landscape&quot;; and
# an &quot;associative cultural landscape&quot; which may be valued because of the &quot;religious, artistic or cultural associations of the natural element&quot;.

==Human conceptions and representations of landscape==

===Landscape gardens===

The Chinese garden is a landscape garden style which has evolved over three thousand years. It includes both the vast gardens of the Chinese emperors and members of the Imperial Family, built for pleasure and to impress, and the more intimate gardens created by scholars, poets, former government officials, soldiers and merchants, made for reflection and escape from the outside world. They create an idealized miniature landscape, which is meant to express the harmony that should exist between man and nature.
A typical Chinese garden is enclosed by walls and includes one or more ponds, scholar&#x27;s rocks, trees and flowers, and an assortment of halls and pavilions within the garden, connected by winding paths and zig-zag galleries. By moving from structure to structure, visitors can view a series of carefully composed scenes, unrolling like a scroll of landscape paintings.

The English landscape garden, also called English landscape park or simply the &#x27;English garden&#x27;, is a style of parkland garden intended to look as though it might be a natural landscape, although it may be very extensively re-arranged. It emerged in England in the early 18th century, and spread across Europe, replacing the more formal, symmetrical &quot;jardin à la française&quot; of the 17th century as the principal style for large parks and gardens in Europe. The English garden (and later French landscape garden) presented an idealized view of nature. It drew inspiration from paintings of landscapes by Claude Lorraine and Nicolas Poussin, and from the classic Chinese gardens of the East, which had recently been described by European travellers and were realized in the Anglo-Chinese garden, and the philosophy of Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712 – 1778).

The English garden usually included a lake, sweeps of gently rolling lawns set against groves of trees, and recreations of classical temples, Gothic ruins, bridges, and other picturesque architecture, designed to recreate an idyllic pastoral landscape. The work of Lancelot &quot;Capability&quot; Brown and Humphry Repton was particularly influential. By the end of the 18th century the English garden was being imitated by the French landscape garden, and as far away as St. Petersburg, Russia, in Pavlovsk, the gardens of the future Emperor Paul. It also had a major influence on the form of the public parks and gardens which appeared around the world in the 19th century.

===Landscape architecture===

Landscape architecture is a multi-disciplinary field, incorporating aspects of botany, horticulture, the fine arts, architecture, industrial design, geology and the earth sciences, environmental psychology, geography, and ecology. The activities of a landscape architect can range from the creation of public parks and parkways to site planning for campuses and corporate office parks, from the design of residential estates to the design of civil infrastructure and the management of large wilderness areas or reclamation of degraded landscapes such as mines or landfills. Landscape architects work on all types of structures and external space – large or small, urban, suburban and rural, and with &quot;hard&quot; (built) and &quot;soft&quot; (planted) materials, while paying attention to ecological sustainability.

For the period before 1800, the history of landscape gardening (later called landscape architecture) is largely that of master planning and garden design for manor houses, palaces and royal properties, religious complexes, and centers of government. An example is the extensive work by André Le Nôtre at Vaux-le-Vicomte and at the Palace of Versailles for King Louis XIV of France. The first person to write of making a landscape was Joseph Addison in 1712. The term landscape architecture was invented by Gilbert Laing Meason in 1828 and was first used as a professional title by Frederick Law Olmsted in 1863. During the latter 19th century, the term landscape architect became used by professional people who designed landscapes. Frederick Law Olmsted used the term &#x27;landscape architecture&#x27; as a profession for the first time when designing Central Park, New York City, US. Here the combination of traditional landscape gardening and the emerging field of city planning gave landscape architecture its unique focus. This use of the term landscape architect became established after Frederick Law Olmsted Jr. and others founded the American Society of Landscape Architects (ASLA) in 1899.

===Landscape and literature===
====The earliest landscape literature====

Possibly the earliest landscape literature is found in Australian aboriginal myths (also known as Dreamtime or Dreaming stories, songlines, or Aboriginal oral literature), the stories traditionally performed by Aboriginal peoples within each of the language groups across Australia. All such myths variously tell significant truths within each Aboriginal group&#x27;s local landscape. They effectively layer the whole of the Australian continent&#x27;s topography with cultural nuance and deeper meaning, and empower selected audiences with the accumulated wisdom and knowledge of Australian Aboriginal ancestors back to time immemorial.

In the West pastoral poetry represent the earliest form of landscape literature, though this literary genre presents an idealized landscape peopled by shepherds and shepherdesses, and creates &quot;an image of a peaceful uncorrupted existence; a kind of prelapsarian world&quot;. The pastoral has its origins in the works of the Greek poet Theocritus (c. 316 - c. 260 BC). The Romantic period poet William Wordsworth created a modern, more realistic form of pastoral with &quot;Michael, A Pastoral Poem&quot; (1800).

An early form of landscape poetry, Shanshui poetry, developed in China during the third and fourth centuries A.D.

====Topographical poetry====
Topographical poetry is a genre of poetry that describes, and often praises, a landscape or place. John Denham&#x27;s 1642 poem &quot;Cooper&#x27;s Hill&quot; established the genre, which peaked in popularity in 18th-century England. Examples of topographical verse date, however, to the Late Classical period, and can be found throughout the Medieval era and during the Renaissance. Though the earliest examples come mostly from continental Europe, the topographical poetry in the tradition originating with Denham concerns itself with the classics, and many of the various types of topographical verse, such as river, ruin, or hilltop poems were established by the early 17th century. Alexander Pope&#x27;s &quot;Windsor Forest&quot; (1713) and John Dyer&#x27;s &quot;Grongar Hill&#x27; (1762) are two other familiar examples. George Crabbe, the Suffolk regional poet, also wrote topographical poems, as did William Wordsworth, of which &quot;Lines written a few miles above Tintern Abbey&quot; is an obvious example. More recently, Matthew Arnold&#x27;s &quot;The Scholar Gipsy&quot; (1853) praises the Oxfordshire countryside, and W. H. Auden&#x27;s &quot;In Praise of Limestone&quot; (1948) uses a limestone landscape as an allegory.

Subgenres of topographical poetry include the country house poem, written in 17th-century England to compliment a wealthy patron, and the prospect poem, describing the view from a distance or a temporal view into the future, with the sense of opportunity or expectation. When understood broadly as landscape poetry and when assessed from its establishment to the present, topographical poetry can take on many formal situations and types of places. Kenneth Baker, in his &quot;Introduction to &quot;The Faber Book of Landscape Poetry&quot;, identifies 37 varieties and compiles poems from the 16th through the 20th centuries—from Edmund Spenser to Sylvia Plath—correspondent to each type, from &quot;Walks and Surveys&quot;, to &quot;Mountains, Hills, and the View from Above&quot;, to &quot;Violation of Nature and the Landscape&quot;, to &quot;Spirits and Ghosts.&quot;

Common aesthetic registers of which topographical poetry makes use include pastoral imagery, the sublime, and the picturesque, which include images of rivers, ruins, moonlight, birdsong, and clouds, peasants, mountains, caves, and waterscapes.

Though describing a landscape or scenery, topographical poetry often, at least implicitly, addresses a political issue or the meaning of nationality in some way. The description of the landscape therefore becomes a poetic vehicle for a political message. For example, in John Denham&#x27;s &quot;Cooper&#x27;s Hill&quot;, the speaker discusses the merits of the recently executed Charles I.

====The Romantic era in Britain====

One important aspect of British Romanticism – evident in painting and literature as well as in politics and philosophy – was a change in the way people perceived and valued the landscape. In particular, after William Gilpin&#x27;s &quot;Observations on the River Wye&quot; was published in 1770, the idea of the picturesque began to influence artists and viewers. Gilpin advocated approaching the landscape &quot;by the rules of picturesque beauty,&quot; which emphasized contrast and variety. Edmund Burke&#x27;s &quot;A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful&quot; (1757) was also an influential text, as was Longinus&#x27; &quot;On the Sublime&quot; (early A.D., Greece), which was translated into English from the French in 1739. From the 18th century, a taste for the sublime in the natural landscape emerged alongside the idea of the sublime in language; that is elevated rhetoric or speech. A topographical poem that influenced the Romantics, was James Thomson&#x27;s &quot;The Seasons&quot; (1726–30).
The changing landscape, brought about by the industrial and agricultural revolutions, with the expansion of the city and depopulation of the countryside, was another influences on the growth of the Romantic movement in Britain. The poor condition of workers, the new class conflicts, and the pollution of the environment all led to a reaction against urbanism and industrialisation and a new emphasis on the beauty and value of nature and landscape. However, it was also a revolt against aristocratic social and political norms of the Age of Enlightenment, as well a reaction against the scientific rationalisation of nature.

The poet William Wordsworth was a major contributor to the literature of landscape, as was his contemporary poet and novelist Walter Scott. Scott&#x27;s influence was felt throughout Europe, as well as on major Victorian novelists in Britain, such as Emily Brontë, Mrs Gaskell, George Eliot, and Thomas Hardy, as well as John Cowper Powys in the 20th-century. Margaret Drabble in &quot;A Writer&#x27;s Britain&quot; suggests that Thomas Hardy &quot;is perhaps the greatest writer of rural life and landscape&quot; in English.

Among European writers influenced by Scott were Frenchmen Honoré de Balzac and Alexandre Dumas and Italian Alessandro Manzoni. Manzoni&#x27;s famous novel &quot;The Betrothed&quot; was inspired by Walter Scott&#x27;s &quot;Ivanhoe&quot;.

====North America====
Also influenced by Romanticism&#x27;s approach to landscape was the American novelist Fenimore Cooper, who was admired by Victor Hugo and Balzac and characterized as the &quot;American Scott.&quot;

====China====
Landscape in Chinese poetry has often been closely tied to Chinese landscape painting, which developed much earlier than in the West. Many poems evoke specific paintings, and some are written in more empty areas of the scroll itself. Many painters also wrote poetry, especially in the scholar-official or literati tradition. Landscape images were present in the early &quot;Shijing&quot; and the &quot;Chuci&quot;, but in later poetry the emphasis changed, as in painting to the &quot;Shan shui&quot; ( lit. &quot;mountain-water&quot;) style featuring wild mountains, rivers and lakes, rather than landscape as a setting for a human presence. Shanshui poetry developed in China during the third and fourth centuries AD and left most of the varied landscapes of China largely unrepresented. &quot;Shan shui&quot; painting and poetry shows imaginary landscapes, though with features typical of some parts of South China; they remain popular to the present day.

Fields and Gardens poetry (), in poetry) was a contrasting poetic movement which lasted for centuries, with a focused on the nature found in gardens, in backyards, and in the cultivated countryside. Fields and Gardens poetry is one of many Classical Chinese poetry genres. One of the main practitioners of the Fields and Gardens poetry genre was Tao Yuanming (also known as Tao Qian (365–427), among other names or versions of names). Tao Yuanming has been regarded as the first great poet associated with the Fields and Gardens poetry genre.

===Landscape art===

====Landscape photography====
Many landscape photographs show little or no human activity and are created in the pursuit of a pure, unsullied depiction of nature devoid of human influence, instead featuring subjects such as strongly defined landforms, weather, and ambient light. As with most forms of art, the definition of a landscape photograph is broad, and may include urban settings, industrial areas, and nature photography. Notable landscape photographers include Ansel Adams, Galen Rowell, Edward Weston, Ben Heine, Mark Gray and Fred Judge.

====Landscape painting====
The earliest forms of art around the world depict little that could really be called landscape, although ground-lines and sometimes indications of mountains, trees or other natural features are included. The earliest &quot;pure landscapes&quot; with no human figures are frescos from Minoan Greece of around 1500 BCE. Hunting scenes, especially those set in the enclosed vista of the reed beds of the Nile Delta from Ancient Egypt, can give a strong sense of place, but the emphasis is on individual plant forms and human and animal figures rather than the overall landscape setting. For a coherent depiction of a whole landscape, some rough system of perspective, or scaling for distance, is needed, and this seems from literary evidence to have first been developed in Ancient Greece in the Hellenistic period, although no large-scale examples survive. More ancient Roman landscapes survive, from the 1st century BCE onwards, especially frescos of landscapes decorating rooms that have been preserved at archaeological sites of Pompeii, Herculaneum and elsewhere, and mosaics.

The Chinese ink painting tradition of shan shui (&quot;mountain-water&quot;), or &quot;pure&quot; landscape, in which the only sign of human life is usually a sage, or a glimpse of his hut, uses sophisticated landscape backgrounds to figure subjects, and landscape art of this period retains a classic and much-imitated status within the Chinese tradition.

Both the Roman and Chinese traditions typically show grand panoramas of imaginary landscapes, generally backed with a range of spectacular mountains – in China often with waterfalls and in Rome often including sea, lakes or rivers. These were frequently used to bridge the gap between a foreground scene with figures and a distant panoramic vista, a persistent problem for landscape artists.

A major contrast between landscape painting in the West and East Asia has been that while in the West until the 19th century it occupied a low position in the accepted hierarchy of genres, in East Asia the classic Chinese mountain-water ink painting was traditionally the most prestigious form of visual art. However, in the West, history painting came to require an extensive landscape background where appropriate, so the theory did not entirely work against the development of landscape painting – for several centuries landscapes were regularly promoted to the status of history painting by the addition of small figures to make a narrative scene, typically religious or mythological.
Dutch Golden Age painting of the 17th century saw the dramatic growth of landscape painting, in which many artists specialized, and the development of extremely subtle realist techniques for depicting light and weather. The popularity of landscapes in the Netherlands was in part a reflection of the virtual disappearance of religious painting in a Calvinist society, and the decline of religious painting in the 18th and 19th centuries all over Europe combined with Romanticism to give landscapes a much greater and more prestigious place in 19th-century art than they had assumed before.

In England, landscapes had initially been mostly backgrounds to portraits, typically suggesting the parks or estates of a landowner, though mostly painted in London by an artist who had never visited the site. the English tradition was founded by Anthony van Dyck and other, mostly Flemish, artists working in England. By the beginning of the 19th century the English artists with the highest modern reputations were mostly dedicated landscapists, showing the wide range of Romantic interpretations of the English landscape found in the works of John Constable, J. M. W. Turner and Samuel Palmer. However all these had difficulty establishing themselves in the contemporary art market, which still preferred history paintings and portraits. 

In Europe, as John Ruskin said, and Sir Kenneth Clark confirmed, landscape painting was the &quot;chief artistic creation of the nineteenth century&quot;, and &quot;the dominant art&quot;, with the result that in the following period people were &quot;apt to assume that the appreciation of natural beauty and the painting of landscape is a normal and enduring part of our spiritual activity&quot;

The Romantic movement intensified the existing interest in landscape art, and remote and wild landscapes, which had been one recurring element in earlier landscape art, now became more prominent. The German Caspar David Friedrich had a distinctive style, influenced by his Danish training. To this he added a quasi-mystical Romanticism. French painters were slower to develop landscape painting, but from about the 1830s Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot and other painters in the Barbizon School established a French landscape tradition that would become the most influential in Europe for a century, with the Impressionists and Post-Impressionists for the first time making landscape painting the main source of general stylistic innovation across all types of painting.

In the United States, the Hudson River School, prominent in the middle to late 19th century, is probably the best-known native development in landscape art. These painters created works of mammoth scale that attempted to capture the epic scope of the landscapes that inspired them. The work of Thomas Cole, the school&#x27;s generally acknowledged founder, has much in common with the philosophical ideals of European landscape paintings — a kind of secular faith in the spiritual benefits to be gained from the contemplation of natural beauty. Some of the later Hudson River School artists, such as Albert Bierstadt, created less comforting works that placed a greater emphasis (with a great deal of Romantic exaggeration) on the raw, even terrifying power of nature. The best examples of Canadian landscape art can be found in the works of the Group of Seven, prominent in the 1920s. Emily Carr was also closely associated with the Group of Seven, though was never an official member. Although certainly less dominant in the period after World War I, many significant artists still painted landscapes in the wide variety of styles exemplified by Neil Welliver, Alex Katz, Milton Avery, Peter Doig, Andrew Wyeth, David Hockney and Sidney Nolan.

The term neo-romanticism is applied in British art history, to a loosely affiliated school of landscape painting that emerged around 1930 and continued until the early 1950s. These painters looked back to 19th-century artists such as William Blake and Samuel Palmer, but were also influenced by French cubist and post-cubist artists such as Pablo Picasso, André Masson, and Pavel Tchelitchew. This movement was motivated in part as a response to the threat of invasion during World War II. Artists particularly associated with the initiation of this movement included Paul Nash, John Piper, Henry Moore, Ivon Hitchens, and especially Graham Sutherland. A younger generation included John Minton, Michael Ayrton, John Craxton, Keith Vaughan, Robert Colquhoun, and Robert MacBryde.

<text>The Blarney Stone () is a block of Carboniferous limestone built into the battlements of Blarney Castle, Blarney, about from the centre of Cork City, Ireland. According to legend, kissing the stone endows the kisser with &quot;the &quot; (great eloquence or skill at flattery). The stone was set into a tower of the castle in 1446. The castle is a popular tourist site in Ireland, attracting visitors from all over the world to kiss the stone and tour the castle and its gardens.

The word &quot;&quot; has come to mean &quot;clever, flattering, or coaxing talk&quot;. Irish politician John O&#x27;Connor Power defined it this way: &quot;Blarney is something more than mere flattery. It is flattery sweetened by humour and flavoured by wit. Those who mix with Irish folk have many examples of it in their everyday experience.&quot; Letitia Elizabeth Landon described its contemporary meaning in an article entitled &#x27;Blarney Castle&#x27; in 1832.

==Origins==

A number of stories attempt to explain the origin of the stone and surrounding legend. An early story involves the goddess Clíodhna. Cormac Laidir MacCarthy, the builder of Blarney Castle, being involved in a lawsuit in the 15th century, appealed to Clíodhna for her assistance. She told MacCarthy to kiss the first stone he found in the morning on his way to court, and he did so, with the result that he pleaded his case with great eloquence and won. Thus the Blarney Stone is said to impart &quot;the ability to deceive without offending&quot;. MacCarthy then incorporated it into the parapet of the castle.

The proprietors of Blarney Castle list several other explanations of the origins of the stone on their website. Many of these suppose that the stone had previously been in Ireland, was taken to Scotland and then returned to Ireland in 1314. The stories listed include one suggesting that the stone was presented to Cormac MacCarthy by Robert the Bruce in 1314 in recognition of his support in the Battle of Bannockburn. This legend holds that this was a piece of the Stone of Scone and was installed at MacCarthy&#x27;s castle of Blarney. Although colourful, this folk legend does not account for the fact that it supposes that the stone was removed from Scotland 18 years before Bannockburn. Moreover, an analysis by geologists at the University of Glasgow in 2014 found the stone&#x27;s geochemical signature matches limestone found in the Blarney area.

==Ritual==

The ritual of kissing the Blarney Stone, according to the castle&#x27;s proprietors, has been performed by &quot;millions of people&quot;, including &quot;world statesmen, literary giants [and] legends of the silver screen&quot;. The kiss, however, is not casually achieved. To touch the stone with one&#x27;s lips, the participant must ascend to the castle&#x27;s peak, then lean over backwards on the parapet&#x27;s edge. This is traditionally achieved with the help of an assistant. Although the parapet is now fitted with wrought-iron guide rails and protective crossbars, the ritual can still trigger attacks of acrophobia.
Before the safeguards were installed, the kiss was performed with real risk to life and limb, as participants were grasped by the ankles and dangled bodily from the height. In the Sherlock Holmes radio dramatisation &quot;The Adventure of the Blarney Stone&quot; (first broadcast on 18 March 1946), a man attempting to kiss the Blarney Stone falls to his death. Holmes&#x27; investigation reveals this as a murder, the man&#x27;s boots having been surreptitiously greased before the attempt.

William Henry Hurlbert wrote in 1888 that the legend of the stone seemed to be less than a hundred years old at that time, suggesting the tradition began late in the 18th century. The legend of the Blarney Stone was described in &quot;A classical dictionary of the vulgar tongue&quot; by Francis Grose, printed 1785.

==Legend==

It is claimed that the synonymy of &quot;blarney&quot; with &quot;empty flattery&quot; or &quot;beguiling talk&quot; derives from one of two sources. One story involves the goddess Clíodhna and Cormac Laidir MacCarthy (see &quot;Origins&quot; above). Another legend suggests that Queen Elizabeth I requested Cormac MacDermot MacCarthy, the Lord of Blarney, be deprived of his traditional land rights. Cormac travelled to see the queen, but was certain he would not persuade her to change her mind as he wasn&#x27;t an effective speaker. He met an old woman on the way who told him that anyone who kissed a particular stone in Blarney Castle would be given the gift of eloquent speech. Cormac went on to persuade the queen that he should not be deprived of his land.

Echoing the supposed power of the stone, an Irish bard of the early 19th century, Francis Sylvester Mahony, added a number of (humorous) lines to Richard Alfred Millikin&#x27;s &quot;The Groves of Blarney&quot; (right).

According to tradition at Texas Tech University, a stone fragment displayed on its campus since 1939 is a missing piece of the Blarney Stone. How this was determined is unknown.

==In music and literature==
The traditional Irish song &quot;The Blarney Stone&quot; (Roud 4800) has been recorded by artists including Tom Lenihan, Margaret Barry and Bob Davenport.

&quot;The Blarney Stone&quot; is also the name of a song by American rock band Ween.

To accompany a picture of the Castle by William Henry Bartlett in Fisher&#x27;s Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1832, Letitia Elizabeth Landon gives a number of examples of blarney from historical personages.

In Chuck Palahniuk&#x27;s novel &quot;Fight Club&quot; (1996), the protagonist reminisces about urinating on the Blarney stone on a trip to Ireland after leaving college.

<doc id="205137" wikidata="Q313424" url="?curid=205137" title="Ian Smith">
<text>Ian Douglas Smith (8 April 191920 November 2007) was a Rhodesian politician, farmer, and fighter pilot who served as Prime Minister of Rhodesia (known as Southern Rhodesia until October 1964 and now known as Zimbabwe) from 1964 to 1979. He was the country&#x27;s first leader to be born and raised in Rhodesia, and led the predominantly white government that unilaterally declared independence from the United Kingdom in November 1965 in opposition to their demands for the implementation of majority rule as a condition for independence. His 15 years in power were defined by the country&#x27;s international isolation and involvement in the Rhodesian Bush War, which pitted the Rhodesian Security Forces against the Soviet and Chinese-funded military wings of the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU) and Zimbabwe African People&#x27;s Union (ZAPU).

Smith was born to British immigrants in the small town of Selukwe in the Southern Rhodesian Midlands, four years before the colony became self-governing in 1923. During the Second World War, he served as a Royal Air Force fighter pilot, where a crash in Egypt resulted in facial and bodily wounds that remained conspicuous for the rest of his life. Following recovery, he served in Europe, where he was shot down and subsequently fought alongside Italian partisans. After the war, he established a farm in his hometown in 1948 and became a Member of Parliament for Selukwe that same year. Originally a member of the Liberal Party, he defected to the United Federal Party in 1953, and served as Chief Whip from 1958 onwards. He left that party in 1961 in protest over the territory&#x27;s new constitution, and went on to co-found the Rhodesian Front the following year.

Smith became deputy prime minister following the Front&#x27;s December 1962 election victory, and he stepped up to the premiership after Field resigned in April 1964, two months before the first events that led to the Bush War took place. After repeated talks with British prime minister Harold Wilson broke down, Smith and his Cabinet unilaterally declared independence on 11 November 1965 in an effort to delay majority rule; shortly afterwards, the first phase of the war began in earnest. After further negotiations with the UK failed, Rhodesia cut all remaining British ties and reconstituted itself as a republic in 1970. Smith led the Front to four election victories over the course of his premiership; despite sporadic negotiations with moderate leader Abel Muzorawa over the course of the war, his support came exclusively from the white minority, with the black majority being widely disenfranchised under the country&#x27;s electoral system.

The country initially endured United Nations sanctions and international isolation with the assistance of South Africa and, until 1974, the Portuguese colonies of Angola and Mozambique. Following 15 years of protracted fighting, with economic sanctions, international pressure and the decline in South African support taking their toll, Smith conceded to the implementation of majority rule and signed the Internal Settlement in 1978 with moderate leaders, excluding ZANU and ZAPU; the country was renamed Zimbabwe Rhodesia the following year. The new order, however, failed to gain international recognition, and the war continued. After being succeeded as prime minister by Muzorawa, Smith took part in the trilateral peace negotiations at Lancaster House, which led to fully free elections and the recognition of an independent Zimbabwe. 

Following the election, Smith served as Leader of the Opposition for seven years and marked himself as a strident critic of Robert Mugabe&#x27;s government. His criticisms persisted after his 1987 retirement: he dedicated much of his 1997 memoir, &quot;The Great Betrayal&quot;, to condemning Mugabe, UK politicians, and defending his premiership. In 2005, Smith moved to South Africa for medical treatment, where he died two years later at the age of 88. His ashes were subsequently repatriated and scattered at his farm. 

As Rhodesia&#x27;s dominant political figure and public face in its final decades, Smith&#x27;s reputation and legacy has remained divisive and controversial up to the present day. By his supporters, he has been hailed as &quot;a political visionary ... who understood the uncomfortable truths of Africa&quot;, defending his rule as one of stability and a stalwart against communism. His critics, in turn, have condemned him as &quot;an unrepentant racist ... who brought untold suffering to millions of Zimbabweans,&quot; as the leader of a white supremacist government responsible for maintaining racial inequality and discriminating against the black majority.

==Early life and education==
===Family, childhood and adolescence===
Ian Douglas Smith was born on 8 April 1919 in Selukwe (now Shurugwi), a small mining and farming town about southwest of the Southern Rhodesian capital Salisbury. He had two elder sisters, Phyllis and Joan. His father, John Douglas &quot;Jock&quot; Smith, was born in Northumberland and was raised in Hamilton in Lanarkshire, Scotland; he was the son of a cattle breeder and butcher. He had emigrated to Rhodesia as a nineteen-year-old in 1898, and became a prominent rancher, butcher, miner and garage owner in Selukwe. Jock and his wife, Agnes (&quot;née&quot; Hodgson), had met in 1907, when she was sixteen, a year after her family&#x27;s emigration to Selukwe from Frizington, Cumberland. After Mr Hodgson sent his wife and children back to England in 1908, Jock Smith astonished them in 1911 by arriving unannounced in Cumberland to ask for Agnes&#x27;s hand; they had not seen each other for three years. They married in Frizington and returned together to Rhodesia, where Jock, an accomplished horseman, won the 1911 Coronation Derby at Salisbury.

The Smith family involved themselves heavily in local affairs. Jock chaired the village management board and commanded the Selukwe Company of the Southern Rhodesia Volunteers; he also became a founding member of the Selukwe Freemasons&#x27; Lodge and president of the town&#x27;s football and rugby clubs. Agnes, who became informally known as &quot;Mrs Jock&quot;, established and ran the Selukwe Women&#x27;s Institute. Both were appointed MBE (at different times) for their services to the community. &quot;My parents strove to instil principles and moral virtues, the sense of right and wrong, of integrity, in their children,&quot; Smith wrote in his memoirs. &quot;They set wonderful examples to live up to.&quot; He considered his father &quot;a man of extremely strong principles&quot;—&quot;one of the fairest men I have ever met and that is the way he brought me up. He always told me that we&#x27;re entitled to our half of the country and the blacks are entitled to theirs.&quot; Raised on the frontier of the British Empire in the UK&#x27;s youngest settler colony, Smith and his generation of white Rhodesians grew up with a reputation for being &quot;more British than the British&quot;, something in which they took great pride.

Smith showed sporting promise from an early age. After attending the Selukwe primary school, he boarded at Chaplin School in Gwelo, about away. In his final year at Chaplin, he was head prefect and captain of the school teams in cricket, rugby and tennis, as well as recipient of the Victor Ludorum in athletics and the school&#x27;s outstanding rifle marksman. &quot;I was an absolute lunatic about sport,&quot; he later said; &quot;I concede, looking back, that I should have devoted much more time to my school work and less to sport.&quot; All the same, his grades were good enough to win a place at Rhodes University College, in Grahamstown in South Africa, then often attended by Rhodesian students—partly because Rhodesia then had no university of its own, and partly because of the common eponymous association with Cecil Rhodes. Smith enrolled at the start of 1938, reading for a Bachelor of Commerce degree. After injuring his knee playing rugby, he took up rowing and became stroke for the university crew.

===Second World War; Royal Air Force pilot===
When the Second World War broke out in 1939, Southern Rhodesia had had self-government for 16 years, having gained responsible government from the UK in 1923. It was unique in the British Empire and Commonwealth in that it held extensive autonomous powers (including defence, but not foreign affairs) while lacking dominion status. As a British colony, Southern Rhodesia entered the conflict automatically when Britain declared war on 3 September 1939, but its government issued a symbolic declaration of war anyway. Smith, who was about halfway through his university course, later described feeling patriotically compelled to put his studies aside to &quot;fight for Britain and all that it represented&quot;. Excited by the idea of flying a Spitfire, he wanted to join the air force, but was prevented from immediately doing so by a policy adopted in Rhodesia not to recruit university students until after they graduated. Smith engineered his recruitment into the Royal Air Force (RAF) in spite of this rule during 1940, suppressing mention of his studies, and formally joined in September 1941.

After a year&#x27;s training at Gwelo under the Empire Air Training Scheme, Smith passed out with the rank of pilot officer in September 1942. He hoped to be stationed in Britain, but was posted to the Middle East instead; there he joined No. 237 (Rhodesia) Squadron RAF, flying Hurricanes. In October 1943, in Egypt, Smith crashed his Hurricane after his throttle malfunctioned during a dawn takeoff. In addition to sustaining serious facial disfigurements, he also broke his jaw, leg and shoulder. Doctors and surgeons in Cairo rebuilt Smith&#x27;s face through skin grafts and plastic surgery, and he was passed fit to fly again in March 1944. Turning down an offer to return to Rhodesia as an instructor, he rejoined No. 237 Squadron, which had switched to flying Spitfire Mk IXs, in Corsica in May 1944.

During a strafing raid over northern Italy on 22 June 1944, enemy flak hit Smith&#x27;s craft and he had to bail out behind German lines. A peasant family named Zunino hid him for a brief time; he then joined a group of pro-Allied Italian partisans, with whom he took part in sabotage operations against the German garrison for about three months. When the Germans pulled out of the area in October 1944, Smith left to try to link up with the Allied forces who had just invaded southern France. Accompanied by three other servicemen, each from a different European country, and a local guide, Smith hiked across the Maritime Alps, finishing the journey walking barefoot on the ice and snow. American troops recovered him in November 1944. Smith again turned down the offer of a billet in Rhodesia and returned to active service in April 1945 with No. 130 (Punjab) Squadron, by then based in western Germany. He flew combat missions there, &quot;[having] a little bit of fun shooting up odd things&quot;, he recalled, until the war in Europe ended on 8 May 1945 with Germany&#x27;s surrender. Smith remained with No. 130 Squadron for the rest of his service, flying with the unit to Denmark and Norway, and was discharged at the end of 1945 with the rank of flight lieutenant. He retained reasonable proficiency in Italian for the rest of his life, albeit reportedly with an &quot;atrocious&quot; accent.

===Graduation, marriage and entrance to politics===
With Jock in increasingly poor health after the war, the Smith family briefly considered sending Ian to live in the United States with the help of Jock&#x27;s brother Elijah, who had become a prosperous New York businessman. Smith showed little interest in leaving Rhodesia, however, and decided that he would finish at university, then come home and buy his own farm. He returned to Rhodes University in early 1946 to find the campus swamped with veterans like himself—400 of them out of barely 1,000 students. Smith became spokesman for the university&#x27;s ex-servicemen, senior student of his hall and chairman of the students&#x27; representative council. He turned down the presidency of the rowing club, saying it would be one administrative commitment too many, but agreed to coach the crew. Training the rowers under strict military-style discipline, he led them to victory at the 1946 South African Inter-Varsity Boat Race at the Vaal Dam south of Johannesburg, upstaging the well-fancied Wits crew, and subsequently received national-standard varsity honours for rowing, the first Rhodes student ever to do so. At the end of the year, having passed the exams to gain his commerce degree (&quot;by some miracle&quot;, he recalled), he returned to Southern Rhodesia to study farming at Gwebi Agricultural College, near Salisbury.

Smith attended dedicated courses for ex-servicemen at Gwebi during 1947 and 1948, learning skills such as ploughing, herding and milking; he gained practical experience at Taylor&#x27;s dairy farm near Selukwe and on a tobacco ranch at Marandellas. In 1947, he met Janet Duvenage (&quot;née&quot; Watt), a schoolteacher from the Cape in South Africa who had come to Selukwe to stay with family after the death of her husband Piet on the rugby field. What Janet had planned as a short holiday for herself and her two infant children, Jean and Robert, turned into a permanent move when she accepted a job offer from the Selukwe junior school. Smith later wrote that the qualities that had attracted him most to Janet were her intelligence, courage and &quot;oppos[ition] on principle to side-stepping or evading an issue ... her tendency was to opt for a decision requiring courage, as opposed to taking the easy way out&quot;. They became engaged in 1948. Meanwhile, Smith negotiated the purchase of a piece of rough land near Selukwe, bounded by the Lundi and Impali Rivers and bisected by a clear stream. He and Janet gave the previously nameless plot the name that the local Karanga people used to refer to the stream, &quot;Gwenoro&quot;, and set up a ranch where they ran cattle and grew tobacco and maize.

A general election was called in Southern Rhodesia in July 1948 after the United Party government, headed by the Prime Minister Sir Godfrey Huggins, unexpectedly lost a vote in the Legislative Assembly. In August, about a month before election day, members of the opposition Liberal Party approached Smith and asked him to stand for them in Selukwe. Jacob Smit&#x27;s Liberals, despite their name, were decidedly illiberal, chiefly representing commercial farming, mining and industrial interests. Smith, initially reluctant, said he was too busy organising his life to stand, but agreed after one of the Liberal officials suggested that a political career might allow him to defend the values he had fought for in the Second World War. With their wedding barely a fortnight away, Janet was astonished to learn of Smith&#x27;s decision to run for parliament, having never before heard him discuss politics. &quot;I can&#x27;t say that I am really interested in party politics,&quot; Smith explained to her, &quot;but I&#x27;ve always been most interested in sound government.&quot; Smith duly became a Liberal Party politician, finalised his purchase of Gwenoro, and married Janet, adopting her two children as his own, all in a few weeks in August 1948. They enjoyed a few days&#x27; honeymoon at Victoria Falls, then went straight into the election campaign.

The Southern Rhodesian electoral system allowed only those who met certain financial and educational qualifications to vote. The criteria applied equally to all regardless of race, but since most black citizens did not meet the set standards, the electoral roll and the colonial parliament were overwhelmingly white. Smith canvassed around the geographically very large Selukwe constituency and quickly won considerable popularity. Many white families were receptive to him because of their respect for his father, or because they had had children at school with him. His RAF service also helped, particularly as the local United Party candidate, Petrus Cilliers, had been interned during the hostilities for opposing the war effort. On 15 September 1948, Smith defeated Cilliers and the Labour candidate Egon Klifborg with 361 votes out of 747, and thereby became Member of Parliament for Selukwe. At 29 years old, he was the youngest MP in Southern Rhodesian history. The Liberals as a party, however, were roundly defeated, going from 12 seats before the election to only five afterwards. Jacob Smit, who had lost his seat in Salisbury City, retired and was replaced as Leader of the Opposition by Raymond Stockil, who renamed the Liberals the &quot;Rhodesia Party&quot;. Having grown up in an area of Cape Town so pro-Smuts that she had never had to vote, Janet did not think her husband&#x27;s entry to parliament would alter their lives at all. &quot;First of all I was marrying a farmer,&quot; she later said, &quot;now he was going to be a politician as well. So I said, &#x27;Well, if you are really interested in it, carry on.&#x27;... It never dawned on me—being so naive about politicians—that our lives would be affected in the slightest degree.&quot;

Because of Southern Rhodesia&#x27;s small size and lack of major controversies, its unicameral parliament then sat only twice a year, for about three months in total, holding discussions in the afternoons either side of a half-hour break for tea on the lawn. Smith&#x27;s early parliamentary commitments in Salisbury therefore did not detract greatly from his ranching. His maiden speech to the Legislative Assembly, in November 1948, concerned the Union of South Africa Trade Agreement Bill, then at its second reading. He was slow to make an impact in parliament—most of his early contributions related to farming and mining—but his exertions within the party won him Stockil&#x27;s respect and confidence. Janet ran Gwenoro during Smith&#x27;s absences, and gave birth to his only biological child, Alec, in Gwelo on 20 May 1949. Smith also served as a Presbyterian elder.

The pursuit of full dominion status was then regarded as something of a non-issue by most Southern Rhodesian politicians. They viewed themselves as virtually independent already; they lacked only the foreign affairs portfolio and taking this on would mean having to shoulder the expense for high commissions and embassies overseas. Huggins and the United Party instead pursued an initially semi-independent Federation with Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland, two protectorates directly administered from London, with the hope of ultimately creating a single, united dominion in south-central Africa.

Smith was one of the few to raise the independence issue at this time, according to his memoirs because his &quot;instinct and training told me to be prepared for every contingency&quot;. During the Federation debate in the House of Assembly, he posited that since Southern Rhodesia was effectively choosing Federation over independence, a clause should be inserted into the bill guaranteeing Southern Rhodesia dominion status in the event of a Federal break-up. The United Party rejected this on the grounds that the Federation had to be declared indissoluble so it could raise loans. Smith was uncertain about the Federal project, but publicly supported it after the mostly white electorate approved it in a referendum in April 1953. He told the &quot;Rhodesia Herald&quot; that now it had been decided to pursue Federation, it was in Southern Rhodesia&#x27;s best interests for everybody to try to make it succeed. He and other Rhodesia Party politicians joined the new Federal Party, headed by Huggins and Northern Rhodesia&#x27;s Sir Roy Welensky, on 29 April 1953.

===Federation; Chief Whip===

The Federation was overtly led by Southern Rhodesia, the most developed of the three territories—Salisbury was its capital and Huggins its first prime minister. Garfield Todd replaced Huggins as Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesia. Resigning his Selukwe seat, Smith contested and won the Federal Assembly&#x27;s Midlands constituency in the inaugural Federal election on 15 December 1953, and thereafter continued as a backbench member of little distinction. In the recollection of Welensky, who took over as Federal Prime Minister on Huggins&#x27;s retirement in 1956, Smith &quot;didn&#x27;t spend much time in Salisbury&quot; during the early Federal period, and had &quot;three major interests ... one was daylight saving, one was European education and he always showed an interest in farming&quot;.

Smith received his first political office in November 1958, following that month&#x27;s Federal election (in which he was returned as MP for Gwanda), after one of Welensky&#x27;s Federal Cabinet ministers requested Smith&#x27;s appointment as a Parliamentary Secretary in the new United Federal Party (UFP) government. Welensky turned this down, saying that while he appreciated Smith&#x27;s relative seniority on the back benches after 10 years in parliament, he did not think he had &quot;shown the particular drive that I would have expected&quot; for such a role. He decided to instead give Smith &quot;a run as Chief Whip, which is generally the step to a ministerial appointment, and ... see how he works out&quot;.

According to his biographer Phillippa Berlyn, Smith remained a somewhat pedestrian figure as Chief Whip, though he was acknowledged by his peers as someone who &quot;did his homework well&quot; whenever he contributed. Clifford Dupont, then Smith&#x27;s counterpart as Chief Whip of the Dominion Party, later commented that the UFP&#x27;s huge majority in the Federal Assembly gave Smith little opportunity to distinguish himself, as few votes were ever in serious doubt.

===Leaving the UFP===

Amid decolonisation and the Wind of Change, the idea of &quot;no independence before majority rule&quot; (&quot;NIBMAR&quot;) gained considerable ground in British political circles during the late 1950s and early 1960s. The Federation, which had faced black opposition from the start, particularly in Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland, grew ever more tenuous. Despite Todd&#x27;s lowering of Southern Rhodesia&#x27;s educational and financial voting qualifications in 1957 to enlarge the black electorate, very few of the newly enfranchised blacks registered to vote, much less utilised their vote, partly due to a boycott campaign by black nationalist movements seeking majority rule. This boycott saw the movement&#x27;s first violent actions take place; black people suspected of registering to vote or participating in the vote were subject to arson attacks and petrol bombings. Attempting to advance the case for Southern Rhodesian independence, particularly in the event of Federal dissolution, Sir Edgar Whitehead, who replaced Todd in 1958, agreed to a new constitution with Britain in 1961. The 1961 constitution contained no explicit independence guarantees, but Whitehead, Welensky and other proponents nevertheless presented it to the Southern Rhodesian electorate as the &quot;independence constitution&quot; under which Southern Rhodesia would become a Commonwealth realm, on a par with Australia, Canada and New Zealand, if the Federation broke up.

Smith was one of the loudest voices of white dissent against the new constitution: alongside its lack of guarantees for eventual independence, he opposed its splitting of the qualified electorate (which was formally non-racial but which had resulted in a low percentage of blacks being eligible to vote) into graduated &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; rolls (the latter having lower income and property qualifications), saying that the proposed system had &quot;racialist&quot; connotations, and objected to the idea that the first black MPs would be elected on what he said would be a &quot;debased franchise&quot;. Steadfastly holding onto a view that the electorate should be decided by qualifications rather than by universal suffrage, he stated that &quot;our policy in the past has always been that we would have a government, in Rhodesia, based on merit and that people wouldn&#x27;t worry whether you were black or whether you were white,&quot;; either way, most blacks did not qualify for either roll in the subsequent election. At the UFP vote on the constitution on 22 February 1961, Smith was the only member out of 280 to vote against it. Deeply disillusioned by these developments, he resigned from the UFP soon thereafter to sit in the Federal Assembly as an independent. He lent his support to the &quot;United Group&quot;, an awkward coalition wherein Winston Field&#x27;s conservative Dominion Party closed ranks with Sir Robert Tredgold and other liberals against the constitutional proposals, despite opposing them for totally contradictory reasons. The black-nationalist leaders initially endorsed the constitution, signing the draft document, but repudiated it almost immediately thereafter and called for blacks to boycott elections held under it. A referendum of the mostly white electorate approved the new constitution by a majority of 65% on 26 July 1961.

===Forming the Rhodesian Front===
As the UK government granted majority rule in Nyasaland and made moves towards the same in Northern Rhodesia, Smith decided that the Federation was a lost cause and resolved to found a new party that would push for Southern Rhodesian independence without acquiescing to British demands. With the support of the rancher, miner and industrialist Douglas &quot;Boss&quot; Lilford, he formed the Rhodesian Reform Party (RRP), based around defectors from the UFP, in December 1961. Meanwhile, Whitehead attempted to counter the black nationalists and persuade newly eligible blacks to register as voters. He banned the main nationalist group, the National Democratic Party, for being violent and intimidatory—it reformed overnight as the Zimbabwe African People&#x27;s Union—and announced that the UFP would repeal the racially discriminatory Land Apportionment Act if it won the next election, as an attempt to appeal to newly enfranchised blacks. These actions gained few black votes, but prompted many scandalised whites to defect to the RRP or Field&#x27;s Dominion Party.

Smith, Field and others met in Salisbury on 13 March 1962 and agreed to unite against Whitehead as the Rhodesian Front (RF). The Front ranged from former UFP members, including Smith, who advocated gradual transition and a government based on merit and electoral qualifications, to the Dominion Party&#x27;s more right-wing members, some of whom held explicitly segregationist views not dissimilar to those of South Africa&#x27;s National Party. Amid these differences, the nascent RF coalition was shaky at best. Its members were brought together by their common opposition to Whitehead&#x27;s promises of fast-track reform, which they agreed would lead to a Congo-style national crisis, the flight of the white community and ultimately the country&#x27;s destruction. In the wider Cold War context, the ardently anti-communist RF aspired to represent a pro-Western bulwark in Africa, alongside South Africa and Portugal, in the face of what they saw as Soviet and Chinese expansionism. Smith asserted that the RF worked to thwart &quot;this mad idea of a hand-over, of a sell-out of the European and his civilisation, indeed of everything he had put into his country&quot;. &quot;The white man is the master of Rhodesia,&quot; he declared; &quot;[he] has built it and intends to keep it&quot;.

The RF ignored the April 1962 Federal elections, deeming them irrelevant, and instead concentrated on the Southern Rhodesian elections that were due at the end of the year. Whitehead attempted to curb the continuing black-nationalist violence through new legislation and in September 1962 banned ZAPU, arresting 1,094 of its members and describing it as a &quot;terrorist organisation&quot;, but he was still seen by much of the electorate as too liberal. He set a general election for 14 December 1962. A number of corporations that had previously funded UFP campaigning this time backed the RF. The RF campaign exploited the chaos in the Congo and the uncertainty regarding Southern Rhodesia&#x27;s future to create a theme of urgency—it pledged to keep power &quot;in responsible hands&quot;, to defend the Land Apportionment Act, to oppose compulsory integration, and to win Southern Rhodesian independence.

The electoral race was close-run until the night before election day, when Whitehead made what proved a fatal political gaffe by telling a public meeting at Marandellas that he would appoint a black Cabinet minister immediately if he won the election, and might soon have as many as six. This statement appeared on the radio news just before the polling booths opened the next morning, and stunned white voters. Many abandoned Whitehead at the last minute. The results, announced on 15 December 1962, put the RF into government with 35 &quot;A&quot;-roll seats to the UFP&#x27;s 15 &quot;A&quot;-roll and 14 &quot;B&quot;-roll seats. Few had expected this; even the RF was somewhat taken aback by its victory, though Smith later described feeling &quot;quietly confident&quot; on election day. Contesting the Umzingwane constituency in the rural south-west, he bested the UFP&#x27;s Reginald Segar by 803 votes to 546.

===Deputy Prime Minister under Field===
Announcing his Cabinet on 17 December 1962, Field named Smith his deputy prime minister and Minister of the Treasury. Two days later, R.A. Butler, the UK&#x27;s Deputy Prime Minister and First Secretary of State, announced that the UK government would allow Nyasaland to leave the Federation. With Northern Rhodesia now also under a secessionist black-nationalist government—Kenneth Kaunda and Harry Nkumbula had formed a coalition to keep the UFP out—and Southern Rhodesia under the RF, the Federation was effectively over. The Field Cabinet made Southern Rhodesian independence on Federal dissolution its first priority, but the Conservative government in the UK was reluctant to grant this under the 1961 constitution as it knew doing so would lead to censure and loss of prestige in the United Nations (UN) and the Commonwealth. Indeed, Southern Rhodesia&#x27;s minority government had already become something of an embarrassment to the UK and it hurt Britain&#x27;s reputation to even maintain the &quot;status quo&quot; there. Granting independence without major constitutional reform would furthermore provoke outcry from the Conservatives&#x27; main parliamentary opposition, the Labour Party, which was strongly anti-colonial and supportive of black-nationalist ambitions.
Butler announced on 6 March 1963 that he was going to convene a conference to decide the Federation&#x27;s future. It would be impossible (or at least very difficult) for the UK to dissolve the union without Southern Rhodesia&#x27;s co-operation as the latter, being self-governing, had been co-signatory to the Federal agreement in 1953. According to Smith, Field, Dupont and other RF politicians, Butler made several oral independence guarantees to ensure Southern Rhodesia&#x27;s attendance and support at the conference, but repeatedly refused to give anything on paper. Field and Smith claimed that Butler justified this to them the day before the conference began by saying that binding Whitehall to a document rather than his word would be against the Commonwealth&#x27;s &quot;spirit of trust&quot;—an argument that Field eventually accepted. &quot;Let&#x27;s remember the trust you emphasised,&quot; Smith warned, according to Field&#x27;s account wagging his finger at Butler; &quot;if you break that you will live to regret it.&quot; No minutes were made of this meeting. Butler denied afterwards that he had ever made such a promise. Southern Rhodesia attended the conference, held at the Victoria Falls Hotel over a week starting from 28 June 1963, and among other things it was agreed to formally liquidate the Federation at the end of 1963.

The Federation dissolved on 31 December 1963 with Nyasaland and Northern Rhodesia both on track for full statehood by the end of 1964, while Southern Rhodesia continued to drift in uncertainty. Under huge pressure from the RF to rectify this matter and win independence, Field&#x27;s perceived vacillation and timidness in his dealings with the UK government caused sections of his party to lose confidence in him during early 1964. On 2 April 1964, with Smith in the chair, the RF caucus passed a near-unanimous vote of no confidence in Field, leading to the Prime Minister&#x27;s resignation 11 days later. Smith accepted the Cabinet&#x27;s nomination to take his place. He was the first Southern Rhodesian prime minister to have been born in the country, something that he thought profoundly altered the character of the dispute with Britain. &quot;For the first time in its history the country now had a Rhodesian-born PM, someone whose roots were not in Britain, but in southern Africa,&quot; he later reflected—&quot;in other words, a white African.&quot;

==Prime minister==

===First days; banning of PCC/ZAPU and ZANU===

Most of the Southern Rhodesian press predicted that Smith would not last long; one column called him &quot;a momentary man&quot;, thrust into the spotlight by the RF&#x27;s dearth of proven leaders. His only real rival to replace Field had been William Harper, an ardent segregationist who had headed the Dominion Party&#x27;s Southern Rhodesian branch during the Federal years. Some reporters predicted Welensky&#x27;s imminent introduction to Southern Rhodesian politics at the head of an RF–UFP coalition government, but Welensky showed little interest in this idea, saying he would be unable to manoeuvre in an RF-dominated House. The RF&#x27;s replacement of Field with Smith drew criticism from the British Labour leader Harold Wilson, who called it &quot;brutal&quot;, while John Johnston, the British High Commissioner in Salisbury, indicated his disapproval by refusing to meet Smith for two weeks after he took office. The ZAPU leader Joshua Nkomo branded the new Smith Cabinet &quot;a suicide squad ... interested not in the welfare of all the people but only in their own&quot;, and predicted that the RF would &quot;eventually destroy themselves&quot;. Asserting that a lasting &quot;place for the white man&quot; in Southern Rhodesia would benefit all of the country&#x27;s people, the new prime minister said the government should be based &quot;on merit, not on colour or nationalism&quot;, and insisted that there would be &quot;no African nationalist government here in my lifetime&quot;.

Smith announced his Cabinet on his first day in office, 14 April 1964. He increased the number of ministers from 10 to 11, redistributed portfolios, and made three new appointments. Smith&#x27;s fellow former UFP men made up most of the new RF Cabinet, with Harper and the Minister of Agriculture, the Duke of Montrose (also called Lord Graham), heading a minority of hardline Dominion Party veterans. Ken Flower, whom Field had appointed Director of the Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO) on its creation the previous year, was surprised to be retained by Smith. Smith announced his policies to the nation through full-page advertisements in the newspapers: &quot;No forced integration. No lowering of standards. No abdication of responsible government. No repeal of the Land Apportionment Act. No appeasement to suit the Afro-Asian bloc.&quot; &quot;An honest Rhodesian,&quot; a 1964 political poster declared—&quot;Trust Mr Smith. He will never hand over Rhodesia.&quot; Smith retained the post of Minister of External Affairs to himself.

One of the Smith government&#x27;s first actions was to crack down hard on the black-nationalist political violence that had erupted following the establishment of a second black-nationalist organisation, the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU), by disgruntled ZAPU members in Tanzania in August 1963. The rival movements were split tribally, ZAPU being mostly Ndebele and ZANU predominantly Shona, and politically—ZAPU, which had relabelled itself the People&#x27;s Caretaker Council (PCC) within Southern Rhodesia to circumvent its ban, was Marxist–Leninist and backed by the Warsaw Pact and its allies, while ZANU had aligned itself with Maoism and the bloc headed by communist China. Their respective supporters in the black townships clashed constantly, also targeting non-aligned blacks whom they hoped to recruit, and sporadically attacked whites, businesses and police stations.

Amid PCC/ZAPU&#x27;s calls for various strikes and protests, including an appeal for black children to boycott state schools, Smith&#x27;s Justice Minister Clifford Dupont had Nkomo and other PCC/ZAPU leaders restricted at Gonakudzingwa in the remote south-east two days after Smith took office. The politically motivated killing of a white man, Petrus Oberholzer, near Melsetter by ZANU insurgents on 4 July 1964 marked the start of intensified black-nationalist violence and police counteraction that culminated in the banning of ZANU and PCC/ZAPU on 26 August, with most of the two movements&#x27; respective leaders concurrently jailed or restricted. ZANU, ZAPU and their respective guerrilla armies—the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA) and the Zimbabwe People&#x27;s Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA)—thereafter operated from abroad.

===Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI)===

Smith, who had been to the UK only four times before 1964 and never more than briefly, was soon labelled a &quot;raw colonial&quot; by Whitehall. He was almost immediately engaged in a dispute with the UK government, which he claimed had forsaken British ideals, and the Commonwealth, which he said had abandoned its own founding principles amid the Wind of Change. He accused both of isolating Southern Rhodesia because it still respected these values. When he learned in June that Salisbury would not be represented at the Commonwealth Prime Ministers&#x27; Conference for the first time since 1932, he was deeply insulted and alleged British betrayal, double standards and appeasement. Three months later, Smith accepted the British condition that the independence terms had to be acceptable to majority opinion, but impasse immediately developed regarding the mechanism by which black views would be gauged. Labour&#x27;s narrow victory in the October 1964 UK general election meant that Smith would be negotiating not with Sir Alec Douglas-Home but with Harold Wilson, who was far less accommodating towards the RF stand. Smith declared acceptability to majority opinion to have been demonstrated after a largely white referendum and an &quot;indaba&quot; of tribal chiefs and headmen both decisively backed independence under the 1961 constitution in October and November 1964, but black nationalists and the UK government dismissed the &quot;indaba&quot; as insufficiently representative of the black community.
Following Northern Rhodesia&#x27;s independence as Zambia in October 1964—Nyasaland had been independent Malawi since July—Southern Rhodesia began referring to itself simply as Rhodesia, but Whitehall rejected this change. Perceiving Smith to be on the verge of a unilateral declaration of independence (UDI), Wilson issued a statement in October 1964 warning of dire economic and political consequences, and wrote to Smith demanding &quot;a categorical assurance forthwith&quot; that no UDI would be attempted. Smith ignored this, expressing confusion as to what he had done to provoke it. The UK and Rhodesian governments exchanged often confrontational correspondence over the next year or so, each accusing the other of being unreasonable and intransigent. Little progress was made when two prime ministers met in person in January 1965, when Smith travelled to London for Sir Winston Churchill&#x27;s funeral. The RF called a fresh election for May 1965 and, campaigning on an election promise of independence, won all 50 &quot;A&quot;-roll seats (elected mostly by whites). Wilson&#x27;s ministers deliberately stonewalled Smith during mid-1965, hoping to eventually break him down, but this only caused the Rhodesian hierarchy to feel yet more alienated. From June, a peripheral dispute concerned Rhodesia&#x27;s unilateral and ultimately successful attempt to open an independent mission in Lisbon; Portugal&#x27;s acceptance of this in September 1965 prompted British outrage and Rhodesian delight.

Amid rumours that UDI was imminent, Smith arrived in London on 4 October 1965 with the declared intent of settling the independence issue, but flew home eight days later with the matter unresolved. When Wilson travelled to Salisbury on 26 October, Smith offered to enfranchise about half a million black Rhodesians immediately along the lines of &quot;one taxpayer, one vote&quot; in return for independence, but Wilson said this was unacceptable as most blacks would still be excluded. He proposed a Royal Commission to test public opinion in Rhodesia regarding independence under the 1961 constitution, and suggested that the UK might safeguard black representation in the Rhodesian parliament by withdrawing relevant devolved powers. This latter prospect horrified Smith&#x27;s team as it seemed to them to have ruled out the failsafe option of keeping the &quot;status quo&quot;. After Wilson returned to Britain on 30 October 1965, he presented terms for the Royal Commission that the Rhodesians found unacceptable—among other things, Britain would not commit itself to accepting the results. Smith rejected these conditions on 5 November, saying they made the whole exercise pointless. After waiting a few days for new terms from Wilson, Smith made a consensus decision with his Cabinet to break ties unilaterally on 11 November 1965, and signed the Unilateral Declaration of Independence at 11:00 local time.

===Fallout from UDI===
UDI, while received calmly by most Rhodesians, prompted political outrage in the UK and overseas. It astonished Wilson, who called on the people of Rhodesia to ignore the post-UDI government, which he described as &quot;hell-bent on illegal self-destroying&quot;. Following orders from Whitehall and the passage of the Southern Rhodesia Act 1965, the colonial Governor Sir Humphrey Gibbs formally sacked Smith and his Cabinet, accusing them of treason. Smith and his ministers ignored this, considering Gibbs&#x27;s office obsolete under the 1965 constitution enacted as part of UDI. After Gibbs made clear that he would not resign, Smith&#x27;s government effectively replaced him with Dupont, who was appointed to the post of &quot;Officer Administering the Government&quot; (created by the 1965 constitution). No attempt was made to remove Gibbs from his official residence at Government House opposite Smith&#x27;s residence at Independence House, however; Gibbs remained there, ignored by the Smith administration, until the declaration of a republic in 1970.

Smith and his government initially continued to profess loyalty to Queen Elizabeth II. The 1965 Constitution reconstituted Rhodesia as a Commonwealth realm, with Elizabeth II as &quot;Queen of Rhodesia&quot;. Indeed, the UDI document ended with the words &quot;God Save The Queen&quot;. In December 1965, Smith, attempting to assert the rights he claimed as Her Majesty&#x27;s Rhodesian prime minister, wrote a letter to Elizabeth asking her to appoint Dupont as governor-general of Rhodesia. The Queen rejected Smith&#x27;s letter, which she characterised in her response as &quot;purported advice&quot;. The UK, with the near-unanimous support of the international community, maintained that Gibbs was now Elizabeth II&#x27;s only legitimate representative in what it still reckoned as the colony of Southern Rhodesia, and hence the sole lawful authority there.

The UN General Assembly and Security Council quickly joined the UK in condemning UDI as illegal and racist. Security Council Resolutions 216 and 217, adopted in the days following Smith&#x27;s declaration, denounced UDI as an illegitimate &quot;usurpation of power by a racist settler minority&quot;, and called on nations not to entertain diplomatic or economic relations. No country recognised Rhodesia as independent. Black nationalists in Rhodesia and their overseas backers, prominently the Organisation of African Unity (OAU), clamoured for the UK to remove Smith&#x27;s government with a military invasion, but Britain dismissed this option, citing logistical issues, the risk of provoking a pre-emptive Rhodesian strike on Zambia, and the psychological issues likely to accompany any confrontation between British and Rhodesian troops. Wilson instead resolved to end UDI through economic sanctions, banning the supply of oil to Rhodesia and the import of most Rhodesian goods to Britain. When Smith continued to receive oil through South Africa and Portuguese Mozambique, Wilson posted a Royal Navy squadron to the Mozambique Channel in March 1966. This blockade, the Beira Patrol, was endorsed by UN Security Council Resolution 221 the following month.

Wilson predicted in January 1966 that the various boycotts would force Smith to give in &quot;within a matter of weeks rather than months&quot;, but the British (and later UN) sanctions had little effect on Rhodesia, largely because South Africa and Portugal went on trading with it, providing it with oil and other key resources. Clandestine trade with other nations also continued, initially at a reduced level, and the diminished presence of foreign competitors helped domestic industries to slowly mature and expand. Even many OAU states, while bombarding Rhodesia with opprobrium, continued importing Rhodesian food and other products. Rhodesia thus avoided the economic cataclysm predicted by Wilson and gradually became more self-sufficient. &quot;Rhodesia can not only take it, but she can also make it,&quot; Smith said on 29 April 1966, while opening the annual Central African Trade Fair in Bulawayo. &quot;When I say take it, I use it in two ways. Firstly, when it comes to sanctions we have proved we can take it. Secondly, when it comes to independence, we have also proved we can take it.&quot;

===&quot;Tiger&quot; and &quot;Fearless&quot; talks with Wilson===
Wilson told the UK&#x27;s House of Commons in January 1966 that he would not enter any kind of dialogue with Smith&#x27;s post-UDI government (which he called &quot;the illegal regime&quot;) until it gave up its claim of independence, but by mid-1966 British and Rhodesian civil servants were holding &quot;talks about talks&quot; in London and Salisbury. By November that year, Wilson had agreed to negotiate personally with Smith. Smith and Wilson subsequently held two rounds of direct negotiations, both of which were held aboard Royal Navy ships off Gibraltar. The first took place aboard HMS &quot;Tiger&quot; between 2 and 4 December 1966, while the second, aboard HMS &quot;Fearless&quot;, was held between 8 and 13 October 1968.

The UK&#x27;s prime minister went to HMS &quot;Tiger&quot; in a belligerent mindset. Wilson&#x27;s political secretary Marcia Falkender later wrote of &quot;apartheid ... on that ship&quot;, with the British and Rhodesian delegations separated in all activities outside the conference room at Wilson&#x27;s orders. Despite the uneasy atmosphere—accounts from both sides describe Wilson dealing with the Rhodesians extremely tersely—talks progressed relatively smoothly until the subject turned to the manner of the transition. Wilson insisted on the abandonment of the 1965 constitution, the dissolution of the post-UDI government in favour of a &quot;broad-based&quot; multiracial interim administration and a period under a British Governor, conditions that Smith saw as tantamount to surrender, particularly as the UK proposed to draft and introduce the new constitution only after a fresh test of opinion under UK control. When Smith asserted on 3 December that he could not settle without first consulting his Cabinet in Salisbury, Wilson was enraged, declaring that a central condition of the summit had been that he and Smith would have plenipotentiary powers to make a deal. According to J.R.T. Wood, Wilson and his Attorney General Sir Elwyn Jones then &quot;bullied Smith for two long days&quot; to try to get him to settle, without success.

A working document was ultimately produced and signed by Smith, Wilson and Gibbs, to be accepted or rejected in its entirety by each Cabinet after the Prime Ministers returned home. Whitehall accepted the proposals, but Salisbury turned them down; Smith announced on 5 December 1966 that while he and his ministers were largely satisfied with the terms, the Cabinet did not feel it could responsibly abandon the 1965 constitution while so much uncertainty surrounded the transition and the new &quot;mythical constitution yet to be evolved&quot;. Rhodesia&#x27;s Leader of the Opposition Josiah Gondo promptly demanded Smith&#x27;s resignation, reasoning that the Cabinet&#x27;s rejection of the working document he had helped to draft amounted to a vote of no confidence. The RF ignored him. Warning that &quot;grave actions must follow&quot;, Wilson took the Rhodesia problem to the United Nations, which proceeded to institute the first mandatory trade sanctions in its history with Security Council Resolutions 232 (December 1966) and 253 (April 1968). These measures required UN member states to prevent all trade and economic links with Rhodesia.
State press censorship, introduced by the Smith administration on UDI, was lifted in early April 1968, though according to the &quot;Glasgow Herald&quot; the government retained &quot;considerable powers to control information. It may reflect no more than Mr Smith&#x27;s growing confidence that nothing—short of a sell-out to Britain—can undermine his position in Rhodesia&quot;. The series of Rhodesian High Court cases debating the legality of UDI came to a close five months later on 13 September. A panel of judges headed by Sir Hugh Beadle ruled UDI, the 1965 constitution and Smith&#x27;s government to be &quot;de jure&quot;, prompting the UK Commonwealth Secretary George Thomson to accuse them of breaching &quot;the fundamental laws of the land&quot;.

On HMS &quot;Fearless&quot;, the UK reversed its confrontational approach of the &quot;Tiger&quot; talks and made a marked effort to appear genial and welcoming, mixing socially with the Rhodesians and accommodating Smith in the Admiral&#x27;s cabin on HMS &quot;Kent&quot;, which was moored alongside. Marked progress towards agreement was made—for example, Wilson dropped altogether the transition period under a colonial Governor—but the Rhodesian delegation now demurred on a new British proposal, the &quot;double safeguard&quot;. This would involve elected black Rhodesians controlling a blocking quarter in the Rhodesian parliament, and thereafter having the right to appeal passed legislation to the Privy Council in London. Smith&#x27;s team accepted the principle of the blocking quarter but agreement could not be reached on the technicalities of it; the involvement of the UK Privy Council was rejected by Smith as a &quot;ridiculous&quot; provision that would prejudice Rhodesia&#x27;s sovereignty. The &quot;Fearless&quot; summit ended with a joint Anglo-Rhodesian statement asserting that &quot;both sides recognise that a very wide gulf still remains&quot;, but were prepared to continue negotiations in Salisbury. This never occurred.

===A republic; failed accord with Douglas-Home===
With their hopes of Commonwealth realm status through a settlement with Britain dimming, Smith and the RF began to seriously consider the alternative of a republic as early as December 1966, after the &quot;Tiger&quot; talks. Republicanism was presented as a means to clarify Rhodesia&#x27;s claimed constitutional status, end ambiguity regarding ties with Britain and elicit official foreign recognition and acceptance. Smith&#x27;s government began exploring a republican constitution in March 1967. The Union Jack and Rhodesia&#x27;s Commonwealth-style national flag—a defaced Sky Blue Ensign with the Union Jack in the canton—were formally superseded on 11 November 1968, the third anniversary of UDI, by a new national flag: a green-white-green vertical triband, charged centrally with the Rhodesian coat of arms. After the electorate voted &quot;yes&quot; in a June 1969 referendum both to a new constitution and to the abandoning of symbolic ties to the Crown, Smith declared Rhodesia a republic on 2 March 1970. The 1969 constitution introduced a president as head of state, a multiracial senate, separate black and white electoral rolls (each with qualifications) and a mechanism whereby the number of black MPs would increase in line with the proportion of income tax revenues paid by black citizens. This process would stop once blacks had the same number of seats as whites; the declared goal was not majority rule, but rather &quot;parity between the races&quot;.
No country recognised the Rhodesian republic. The RF was decisively returned to power in the first election held as a republic, on 10 April 1970, winning all 50 white seats. Hopes for an Anglo-Rhodesian rapprochement were boosted two months later when the Conservatives won a surprise election victory in the UK. Edward Heath took over as prime minister while Douglas-Home became Foreign Secretary. Talks between Douglas-Home and Smith began with a lengthy meeting in Salisbury in April 1971 and continued until a tentative understanding was reached in early November. A UK delegation headed by Douglas-Home and the Attorney General Sir Peter Rawlinson flew to Salisbury on 15 November for negotiations over a new constitution, and after six days of discussion an accord was signed on 21 November 1971.

The constitution agreed upon was based largely on the one Rhodesia had just adopted, but would eventually bring about a black majority in parliament. Black representation in the House would be immediately increased, and a majority of both black and white MPs would have to approve retrogressive legislation; blacks would thus wield an effective veto &quot;as long as they voted solidly together&quot;, Robert Blake comments. &quot;The principle of majority rule was enshrined with safeguards ensuring that there could be no legislation which could impede this,&quot; Smith wrote in his memoirs. &quot;On the other hand, there would be no mad rush into one man, one vote with all the resultant corruption, nepotism, chaos and economic disaster which we had witnessed in all the countries around us.&quot;

The UK announced a test of opinion in Rhodesia to be undertaken by a four-man commission headed by the veteran judge Lord Pearce. All four population groups—black, white, coloured (mixed) and Asian—would have to approve the terms for Britain to proceed. ZANU and ZAPU supporters quickly formed the African National Council (later the United African National Council, or UANC) to organise and co-ordinate black opposition to the deal. Bishop Abel Muzorewa, the first black man to have been ordained as such in Rhodesia, was installed as the movement&#x27;s leader. The Pearce Commission finished its work on 12 March 1972 and published its report two months later—it described white, coloured and Asian Rhodesians as in favour of the terms by 98%, 97% and 96% respectively, and black citizens as against them by an unspecified large majority. This came as a great shock to the white community &quot;and a deep disappointment to those in Britain who hoped to get rid of this tiresome albatross&quot;, Blake records. Smith condemned the Pearce Commissioners as &quot;naive and inept&quot;. The UK withdrew from negotiations, but neither government abandoned the accord entirely. &quot;I would ask them [the black people of Rhodesia] to look again very carefully at what they rejected,&quot; Douglas-Home told the House of Commons; &quot;the proposals are still available because Mr Smith has not withdrawn or modified them.&quot;

===Bush War===

The Rhodesian Bush War (or Second &quot;Chimurenga&quot;), which had been underway at a low level since before UDI, began in earnest in December 1972 when ZANLA attacked farms in north-eastern Rhodesia. The Rhodesian Security Forces mounted a strong counter-campaign over the next two years. Muzorewa re-engaged with Smith in August 1973, accepting the 1971–72 Douglas-Home terms, and the two signed a statement to that effect on 17 August. The UANC executive repudiated this in May 1974, but talks between Smith and Muzorewa continued sporadically. The RF again won a clean sweep of the 50 white seats in the July 1974 general election.

Rhodesia&#x27;s early counter-insurgency successes were undone by political shifts in the guerrillas&#x27; favour overseas. The April 1974 Carnation Revolution in Lisbon led to Mozambique&#x27;s transformation over the next year from a Portuguese territory friendly to Smith&#x27;s government into a communist state openly allied with ZANU. Wilson and Labour returned to power in the UK in March 1974. Portugal&#x27;s withdrawal made Rhodesia hugely dependent on South Africa, but Smith still insisted that he held a strong position. &quot;If it takes one year, five years, ten years, we&#x27;re prepared to ride it out,&quot; he told the RF congress on 20 September 1974. &quot;Our stand is clear and unambiguous. Settlement is desirable, but only on our terms.&quot;

The geopolitical situation tilted further against Smith in December 1974 when the South African Prime Minister B. J. Vorster pressured him into accepting a détente initiative involving the Frontline States of Zambia, Tanzania and Botswana (Mozambique and Angola would join the following year). Vorster had concluded that Rhodesia&#x27;s position was untenable; in his view, it made no sense to maintain white rule in a country where blacks outnumbered whites by 22:1. He also believed that South African interests would be better served by collaborating with black African governments over a Rhodesian settlement; he hoped that success in this might win South Africa some international legitimacy and allow it to retain apartheid. Détente forced a ceasefire, giving the guerrillas time to regroup, and required the Rhodesians to release the ZANU and ZAPU leaders so they could attend a conference in Rhodesia, united under the UANC banner and led by Muzorewa. When Rhodesia stopped releasing black-nationalist prisoners on the grounds that ZANLA and ZIPRA were not observing the ceasefire, Vorster harried Smith further by withdrawing the South African Police, which had been helping the Rhodesians patrol the countryside. Smith remained stubborn, saying in the run-up to the conference that &quot;We have no policy in Rhodesia to hand over to a black majority government&quot; and that his government instead favoured &quot;a qualified franchise for all Rhodesians ... [to] ensure that government will be retained in responsible hands for all times&quot;.
Nkomo remained unchallenged at the head of ZAPU, but the ZANU leadership had become contested between its founding president, the Reverend Ndabaningi Sithole, and Robert Mugabe, a former teacher from Mashonaland who had recently won an internal election in prison. When they were released in December 1974 under the détente terms, Mugabe went to Mozambique to consolidate his leadership of the guerrillas, while Sithole joined Muzorewa&#x27;s delegation. It had been agreed that the talks would take place within Rhodesia, but the black nationalists refused to meet on ground they perceived as not neutral. The Rhodesians insisted on abiding by the accord and negotiating inside the country. To please both camps the conference was held on a train halfway across the Victoria Falls Bridge on the border between Rhodesia and Zambia; the delegations sat on opposite sides of the frontier. The conference, which took place on 26 August 1975 with Kaunda and Vorster as mediators, failed to produce a settlement; each side accused the other of being unreasonable. Smith afterwards held direct talks with Nkomo and ZAPU in Salisbury, but these also led nowhere; Nkomo proposed an immediate transition to an interim government headed by himself, which Smith rejected. Guerrilla incursions picked up strongly in the first months of 1976.

On 20 March 1976, Smith gave a televised speech including what became his most quoted utterance. &quot;I don&#x27;t believe in majority rule ever in Rhodesia—not in 1,000 years,&quot; he said. &quot;I repeat that I believe in blacks and whites working together. If one day it is white and the next day it is black, I believe we have failed and it will be a disaster for Rhodesia.&quot; The first sentence of this statement became commonly quoted as evidence that Smith was a crude racist who would never compromise with the black nationalists, even though the speech was one in which Smith had said that power-sharing with black Rhodesians was inevitable and that &quot;we have got to accept that in the future Rhodesia is a country for black and white, not white as opposed to black and vice versa&quot;. The &quot;not in 1,000 years&quot; comment was, according to Peter Godwin, an attempt to reassure the RF&#x27;s right wing, which opposed any transition whatsoever, that white Rhodesians would not be sold out. In her 1978 biography of Smith, Berlyn comments that regardless of whether the statement was &quot;taken out of context, or whether his actual intent was misinterpreted&quot;, this was one of his greatest blunders as prime minister as it gave obvious ammunition to his detractors.
Henry Kissinger, the U.S. Secretary of State, announced a formal interest in the Rhodesian situation in February 1976, and over the next half-year held discussions with the United Kingdom, South Africa and the Frontline States in what became the &quot;Anglo-American initiative&quot;. Meeting Smith in Pretoria on 18 September 1976, Kissinger proposed majority rule after a transition period of two years. He strongly encouraged Smith to accept his deal, though he knew it was unpalatable to him, as any future offer could only be worse from Smith&#x27;s standpoint—especially if, as expected, U.S. president Gerald Ford lost the upcoming election to Jimmy Carter. Smith expressed great reluctance, but agreed on 24 September after Vorster intimated that South Africa might cut off financial and military aid if he refused. It was the first time Smith had publicly accepted the principles of unconditional majority rule and one man, one vote. However, the Frontline States then abruptly revised their stance and turned the Kissinger terms down, saying that any transition period was unacceptable. The UK quickly arranged an all-party conference in Geneva, Switzerland to try to salvage a solution. ZANU and ZAPU announced that they would attend this and any summit thereafter as a joint &quot;Patriotic Front&quot; (PF), including members of both parties under a combined leadership. The Geneva Conference, held between October and December 1976 under British mediation, also failed.

===Internal Settlement and Lancaster House; becoming Zimbabwe===

Smith&#x27;s moves towards a settlement with black-nationalist groups prompted outrage in sections of Rhodesian Front&#x27;s right wing, but he remained unassailable within the party as a whole, which had in late 1975 granted him a mandate to negotiate for the best possible settlement however he saw fit. The split in the party ultimately led to the defection in July 1977 of 12 RF MPs after Smith introduced legislation to remove racial criteria from the Land Tenure Act.

The loss of these seats to the breakaway Rhodesian Action Party, which opposed any conciliation with black nationalists, meant that Smith now only barely had the two-thirds majority in parliament he would need to change the constitution, as he would have to in the event of a settlement. He therefore called an early election, and on 31 August 1977 roundly defeated the defectors—&quot;the dirty dozen&quot;, the RF called them—as well as all other opposition; for the third time in seven years, the RF had won all 50 white seats. The party revolt turned out to be a blessing in disguise for Smith, Berlyn comments, as it allowed him to &quot;shed the dead wood of the right wing&quot;, giving him more freedom in negotiations with the nationalists. The need for a settlement was becoming urgent—the war was escalating sharply, white emigration was climbing and the economy was starting to struggle as the UN sanctions finally began to have a serious effect.

In March 1978, Smith and non-militant nationalist groups headed by Muzorewa, Sithole and Chief Jeremiah Chirau agreed what became the &quot;Internal Settlement&quot;, under which the country would be reconstituted as Zimbabwe Rhodesia in June 1979 after multiracial elections. ZANU and ZAPU were invited to participate, but refused; Nkomo sardonically dubbed Smith&#x27;s black colleagues &quot;the blacksmiths&quot;. The deal was badly received abroad, partly because it kept the police, the military, the judiciary and the civil service in white hands. There would be a senate of 20 blacks and 10 whites, and whites would be reserved 28 out of 100 seats in the new House of Assembly. Smith and Nkomo re-entered negotiations in August 1978, but these ended after ZIPRA shot down an Air Rhodesia passenger flight on 3 September and massacred survivors at the crash site. Smith cut off talks, introduced martial law across most of the country and ordered reprisal attacks on guerrilla positions. Smith, Muzorewa and Sithole toured the United States in October 1978 to promote their settlement, and met Kissinger, Ford and others including the future president Ronald Reagan. On 11 December, ZANLA attacked Salisbury&#x27;s oil storage depot, causing a fire that lasted six days and destroyed a quarter of Rhodesia&#x27;s fuel. Two months later ZIPRA downed another civilian flight, this time killing all on board.

After whites endorsed the Internal Settlement by 85% in a referendum on 30 January 1979, Smith dissolved the Rhodesian parliament for the last time on 28 February. The RF won all the white seats in the April 1979 elections while Muzorewa and the UANC won a majority in the common roll seats with 67% of the popular vote; the PF rejected this, however, as did the UN, which passed a resolution branding it a &quot;sham&quot;. Sithole, astounded that his party had won only 12 seats to the UANC&#x27;s 51, suddenly turned against the settlement and alleged that the polls had been stage-managed in Muzorewa&#x27;s favour. Mugabe dismissed the bishop as a &quot;neocolonial puppet&quot; and pledged to continue ZANLA&#x27;s campaign &quot;to the last man&quot;; Nkomo similarly committed ZIPRA. On 1 June 1979, the day of the country&#x27;s official reconstitution as Zimbabwe Rhodesia, Muzorewa replaced Smith as prime minister, at the head of a UANC–RF coalition Cabinet made up of 12 blacks and five whites. Smith was included as Minister without portfolio; Nkomo promptly dubbed him the &quot;Minister with all the portfolios&quot;.
An observer group from the UK Conservative Party did regard the April 1979 elections as fair, and Margaret Thatcher, the Conservative leader, was personally disposed to recognise Muzorewa&#x27;s government and lift sanctions. The potential significance of the Conservative victory in the May 1979 British general election was not lost on Smith, who wrote to Thatcher: &quot;All Rhodesians thank God for your magnificent victory.&quot; The U.S. Senate passed a resolution urging President Carter to remove sanctions and declare Zimbabwe Rhodesia legitimate, but Carter and his Cabinet remained strongly opposed. Carter and Thatcher ultimately decided against accepting Zimbabwe Rhodesia, noting the continued international support for the guerrillas. After the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Lusaka in August 1979, the UK Foreign Secretary Lord Carrington invited the Zimbabwe Rhodesian government and the Patriotic Front to attend an all-party constitutional conference at Lancaster House in London, starting on 10 September.

Smith was part of Muzorewa&#x27;s delegation at Lancaster House. Several aspects of the Internal Settlement constitution, such as a declaration of human rights and a guarantee that land redistributed by the government would be paid for, were retained; it was also agreed to have 20 reserved white seats out of 100 for at least seven years. Fresh elections would be held during a brief period under a British Governor invested with full executive and legislative powers. The new constitution was agreed on 18 October, and on 12 December 1979 the House of Assembly voted to dissolve itself, ending UDI. Lord Soames arrived in Salisbury later the same day to become Southern Rhodesia&#x27;s last Governor; among other things he announced that Smith would be granted amnesty for declaring independence. The final Lancaster House Agreement was signed on 21 December. Smith was the only member of any delegation to openly oppose the accords; he refused to attend the signing ceremony and boycotted the post-agreement party, instead having dinner with former RAF comrades and Group Captain Sir Douglas Bader.

The UK government and the international community ultimately declared the February 1980 general election free and fair, though many observers attested to widespread political violence and intimidation of voters, particularly by ZANU (which added Patriotic Front to its name to become &quot;ZANU–PF&quot;). British monitors in the ZANU–PF-dominated eastern provinces were strongly critical, reporting &quot;brutal &#x27;disciplinary murders&#x27; as examples of the fate awaiting those who failed to conform&quot;, name-taking and &quot;claims to the possession of machines which would reveal how individuals had voted&quot;. The Commonwealth Observer Group acknowledged that irregularities were occurring but ruled that accounts were exaggerated. After the RF won all 20 white seats, Soames announced late on 4 March 1980 that Mugabe and ZANU–PF had won 57 of the 80 common roll seats, giving them a majority in the new House of Assembly.

Mugabe invited Smith to his house that evening and according to Smith treated him &quot;most courteously&quot;; Mugabe expressed joy at inheriting a &quot;wonderful country&quot; with modern infrastructure and a viable economy, outlined plans for gradual reform that Smith found reasonable, and said that he hoped to stay in regular contact. This meeting had a profound effect on the former prime minister. Having denounced Mugabe as an &quot;apostle of Satan&quot; before the election, Smith now publicly endorsed him as &quot;sober and responsible&quot;. &quot;If this were a true picture, then there could be hope instead of despair,&quot; he recalled in his autobiography. &quot;When I got home I said to Janet that I hoped it was not an hallucination.&quot;

==Opposition==
===First years under Mugabe===

The new Zimbabwean parliament opened on 15 May 1980, a month after formal independence from Britain, with Smith as the reconstituted country&#x27;s first Leader of the Opposition. Continuing a long-standing tradition from the Rhodesian era, the government and opposition entered the House in pairs—Mugabe and Smith walked in side by side with their respective MPs following, &quot;aptly symbolis[ing] the mood of reconciliation&quot;, Martin Meredith comments. With around 1,000 whites leaving Zimbabwe each month, Smith took to the radio to urge them to stay and give Mugabe&#x27;s new order a chance, but over half of the country&#x27;s whites left within three years. As Meredith records, the 100,000 or so who remained &quot;retreated into their own world of clubs, sporting activities, and comfortable living&quot;. Mugabe made great efforts when he first took power to endear himself to the white farming community, which accounted for at least 75% of Zimbabwe&#x27;s agricultural output. Amid booming Zimbabwean commodity prices in the years immediately following 1980, many white commercial farmers came to support Mugabe. The new prime minister continued cordially meeting Smith until the RF leader took him to task in 1981 for openly calling for a one-party state; Smith said this was putting off foreign investors. Mugabe was not impressed and, according to Smith, refused to ever meet him again.

As Mugabe&#x27;s main opponent in Parliament at the head of the Republican Front (as the RF renamed itself in 1981), Smith presented himself as the guardian of what he called Zimbabwe&#x27;s &quot;white tribe&quot;. He spoke gloomily about Zimbabwe&#x27;s future prospects, repeatedly accused the Mugabe administration of corruption, malevolence and general incompetence, and criticised Mugabe&#x27;s support for a one-party system. The RF took an increasingly confrontational line in the House after Mugabe and other government ministers began regularly pouring scorn on the white community in national broadcasts and other media. Amid rising tensions with South Africa, various white Zimbabweans were arrested, accused of being South African agents, and tortured. When Smith complained about whites being imprisoned without trial under emergency powers, a number of ZANU–PF MPs pointed out that they themselves had been detained under that same legislation, and for far longer, by Smith&#x27;s government. Mugabe openly admitted torturing suspected spies, had some who were found not guilty by the High Court immediately rearrested on the street outside, and accused Western critics of caring only because the people in question were white.

Smith visited Britain and the United States in November 1982, and spoke scathingly about Zimbabwe to reporters, claiming that Mugabe was turning the country into a totalitarian Marxist–Leninist dictatorship. Government retribution was immediate. On Smith&#x27;s return home, police raided an art exhibition hosting him as guest of honour in Harare (as Salisbury had been renamed in April 1982) and took all the attendees in for questioning, ostensibly because of suspicions it might be an illegal political meeting. A week later, police seized his passport, according to a government statement because his criticism of Zimbabwe while abroad constituted &quot;political bad manners and hooliganism&quot;. Police meticulously searched his Harare house and Gwenoro over the next week, confiscating firearms, personal papers and a diary. Smith told reporters all this was &quot;part of the game to intimidate me and so demoralise the whites&quot;. Some RF MPs left the party to sit with ZANU–PF or as independents, feeling that constantly confronting Mugabe was ill-advised and unnecessary. Smith remained convinced that nobody would stand up for white Zimbabweans if they did not stick together and defend their interests in parliament.

Smith Hempstone later wrote that the former prime minister had resolved to &quot;go down ... with all rhetorical guns blazing&quot;. This was in spite of increasingly unstable health; in June 1982 he collapsed in the House of Assembly, clutching at his side and shaking. Half a year later he had to arrange treatment in South Africa for a condition stemming from hardening of the arteries. The government&#x27;s confiscation of his passport and two refusals of its return prevented him from going, so in April 1983 Smith successfully applied for a British passport. &quot;I&#x27;ll still try to get my Zimbabwean passport back,&quot; he said. &quot;I was born here and that is the passport I should travel on.&quot; Smith regained his Zimbabwean papers after about a year. In 1984, he declared his intention to renounce his British nationality to abide by a new Zimbabwean law outlawing multiple citizenship. Britain did not recognise this legislation; according to Smith, British officials refused to take his UK passport when he tried to return it.

===&quot;Gukurahundi&quot;; last years in politics===
After the already tense relations between ZANU–PF and ZAPU disintegrated amid Mugabe&#x27;s wish to adopt a one-party system in Zimbabwe, Mugabe expelled Nkomo from the government in February 1982, accusing him and ZAPU of plotting a coup. About a year later, Mugabe deployed the North Korean-trained 5th Brigade to Matabeleland, ZAPU&#x27;s heartland, where it massacred thousands of civilians accused of supporting &quot;dissidents&quot; in what came to be called &quot;Gukurahundi&quot;. Meredith asserts that this far exceeded anything that had occurred during the Bush War, an opinion shared by Geoff Hill. Some white farmers were also killed. Estimates for the number of deaths during the five-year &quot;Gukurahundi&quot; campaign range from 10,000 to 30,000. Mugabe concurrently took steps to marginalise the other main black-nationalist leaders from the &quot;Chimurenga&quot;. Nkomo fled to the UK in March 1983, fearing for his life; Sithole similarly exiled himself in the United States. Muzorewa stayed in Zimbabwe, and he was detained in late 1983 for alleged &quot;subversive links&quot; with South Africa. On arriving in England, Nkomo accused Mugabe of genocide and asserted that &quot;Things are worse now than they ever were under Ian Smith&quot;. Mugabe denied that anything improper was happening and put reports to the contrary down to &quot;reactionary foreign journalists&quot;.

The Zimbabwean government publicly threatened Smith on a regular basis, but in practice left him and his property largely untouched—Mugabe frequently pointed to Smith&#x27;s freedom as evidence of Zimbabwe&#x27;s reconciliation policy. Smith renamed the RF the Conservative Alliance of Zimbabwe (CAZ) on 21 July 1984, concurrently removing racial criteria for membership and inviting black Zimbabweans to join. The CAZ was very successful in the 1985 parliamentary election, winning 15 of the 20 white seats; Smith won decisively in Bulawayo Central. Mugabe interpreted this as &quot;the racists of this country&quot; defying his government and rejecting reconciliation, and immediately pledged to abolish the white seats, which he said compromised &quot;the sovereignty of our people&quot;. After Smith described Mugabe&#x27;s government as &quot;illiterate&quot; on BBC television in November 1985, Mugabe told the House of Assembly Smith was &quot;an incorrigible racist&quot; who &quot;should long ago have been hanged and hanged publicly&quot;. Later that month, Smith&#x27;s close friend and long-standing political associate &quot;Boss&quot; Lilford, who had provided much of the finance to form the RF, was found beaten and shot to death on his ranch. Smith described Lilford afterwards as a man &quot;who was prepared to die for [his] principles&quot;, but refused to openly discuss any possible political motive, saying simply that &quot;it would be premature to come to conclusions&quot;.

Smith was by now in the twilight of his career, but his outspoken, confrontational stance continued to irritate the ZANU–PF government. He was declared a &quot;fifth columnist&quot; by the Information Minister Nathan Shamuyarira in February 1987 after he advised a group of South African businessmen that they could survive economic sanctions if white South Africans stood together. Three months later, after he was suspended from the Zimbabwean parliament for a year over his comments in South Africa and criticism of ZANU–PF, he resigned as leader of the CAZ. His salary was also stopped during the suspension, but the Supreme Court of Zimbabwe ruled in 1989 this had been done illegally and violated Smith&#x27;s constitutional rights. His four decades as an MP formally ended in September 1987 when, as allowed under the Lancaster House terms, ZANU–PF scrapped the white seats amid sweeping constitutional reforms. The office of prime minister was abolished in October; Mugabe became the country&#x27;s first executive President two months later. Mugabe and Nkomo signed a unity accord at the same time, merging ZAPU into ZANU–PF with the stated goal of a Marxist–Leninist one-party state.

This marked the end of Smith&#x27;s front-line political career—Gerald Smith (no relation) replaced him as leader of the CAZ—but he remained active in opposition at a reduced level. In July 1992 he chaired a meeting where the CAZ, Muzorewa&#x27;s UANC, Sithole&#x27;s ZANU–Ndonga party and Edgar Tekere&#x27;s Zimbabwe Unity Movement formed a coalition to challenge Mugabe and ZANU–PF in the next parliamentary election. The result was the short-lived United Front, which Smith agreed to chair, saying he had no more political ambitions and could therefore be regarded as a neutral figurehead. The United Front quickly failed, largely due to the lack of common ground between the constituent parties, and never contested an election. The remainder of the collaboration formed the Forum Party, in which Smith decided not to take a leading role. Another brief collaboration between Smith, Muzorewa and Sithole in March 2000 also led to nothing.

==Retirement and final years==
The elderly Ian Smith lived in an unassuming house in Harare where, according to David Blair, &quot;the front gate always stood open and virtually anyone who walked up the drive would be invited in for tea&quot;. He still owned Gwenoro, but employed a manager to run it after Janet&#x27;s death in 1994. He insisted that he would never leave Zimbabwe. &quot;Don&#x27;t get fazed by the riots, hold your head high, do not be afraid,&quot; a friend reported him saying. &quot;Show you are not budging and the government will leave you alone.&quot; He dedicated much of his 1997 autobiography, &quot;The Great Betrayal&quot;, to criticising the Mugabe administration and a long succession of British figures he considered to have let him and Rhodesia down; he also defended and justified his actions as prime minister, and praised Nelson Mandela, calling him Africa&#x27;s &quot;first black statesman&quot;. Smith&#x27;s enduring popularity among white Zimbabweans was evidenced by the long queues they formed to have him sign copies of the book on its release in Harare in December 1997. &quot;They were captured, hiding their faces and turning to the wall, as television cameras recorded their &#x27;betrayal&#x27; for the evening news,&quot; Josephine Fisher records. Not all of the country&#x27;s whites admired Smith; some felt that his obstinate refusal to acknowledge what they saw as past errors caused the whole white community to be resented and viewed with suspicion.

===2000–2002: back in the public eye===
According to Meredith, governmental mismanagement and widespread corruption within the ZANU–PF order led to Mugabe and others enriching themselves considerably at the expense of the country as a whole. In Meredith&#x27;s view, the average Zimbabwean was worse off in 2000 than he had been in 1980: &quot;average wages were lower, unemployment had trebled, public services were crumbling, and life expectancy was falling&quot;. Opposition to ZANU–PF grew, particularly in the towns and cities. In 2000, hoping to win support from rural blacks, Mugabe introduced a fast-track land reform programme under which groups of ZANU–PF activists, officially referred to as &quot;war veterans&quot;, were sent to take over white-owned farms so the land could be split up, without compensation, and redistributed to black peasant farmers. White farmers and their black employees were violently forced out, food production plummeted, and the economy collapsed to half of the size that it had been in 1980.

When a group of about 50 ZANU–PF activists briefly invaded Gwenoro in May 2000, Smith played down the incident, saying the intruders were just bored and out of work. &quot;There&#x27;s no politics on the farm,&quot; he said. Five months later, in England to address the Oxford Union, Smith described Mugabe as &quot;mentally deranged&quot;. The President announced in response that Smith would be arrested and tried for genocide if he ever came back to Zimbabwe, a threat that Smith mocked. &quot;I would love that. Let him try it,&quot; he said—&quot;It would give me the chance to tell the world the truth about this gangster ... I will give him the date and time of arrival of my plane so he can meet me at the airport.&quot; A mass of reporters descended on Harare International Airport on 7 November 2000 to witness Smith&#x27;s arrest, but far from being detained, the former prime minister was greeted cheerily by immigration officers and allowed through without any obstruction. Telling the waiting pressmen that he was disappointed not to have met any confrontation, he commented: &quot;We have a president here who is mentally unstable and makes statements that have no bearing on reality&quot;, and went home unmolested.

In early September 2001, ZANU–PF militants again attempted to force Smith off his farm. The former prime minister telephoned the provincial governor, who promptly sent police to remove the invaders. According to Smith, the trespassers were shocked to hear that the authorities were taking his side, and they left before the police even arrived. Half a year later, Smith lost his Zimbabwean passport as a result of further tightening of the law regarding multiple citizenship. New legislation passed in 2001 required Zimbabwean citizens to disavow any claim to other nationalities, even if they did not hold foreign passports. Insisting that Mugabe&#x27;s government had no right to strip him of Zimbabwean citizenship, Smith refused to renounce his right to British nationality, though he had not held a UK passport for years. Zimbabwean authorities duly refused to renew Smith&#x27;s passport in March 2002. State press reported that he had &quot;automatically ceased to be a citizen of Zimbabwe&quot; on the passport&#x27;s expiry, having failed to renounce British citizenship before a deadline on 8 January that year. Smith claimed that his Zimbabwean citizenship had been illegally revoked and that he was now stateless, an assertion disputed by the Minister of Home Affairs, John Nkomo, who said that Smith could stay in the country, but would not receive a new Zimbabwean passport until he renounced his right to British nationality.

By 2002, the white community in Zimbabwe had shrunk to no more than 50,000 people, of whom many, like Smith, were elderly. Smith had by this time lost most of his former international prominence—his visit to the UK in 2004 to meet Conservative politicians was largely ignored by the British press—but he achieved new domestic popularity and eminence among Zimbabwean opposition supporters, who came to see him as an unbreakable, defiant symbol of resistance to the Mugabe government. According to R. W. Johnson, a speech he gave to students at the University of Zimbabwe condemning Mugabe and ZANU–PF as incompetent and corrupt &quot;gangsters&quot; earned him a standing ovation. In 2002, Smith challenged Mugabe to come with him to a township to see who got the best welcome. &quot;Only one of us will come out alive,&quot; Smith said; &quot;I&#x27;m ready to put that to the test right now. He&#x27;s not.&quot; In a 2005 interview, Smith asserted that he viewed himself as African, stating &quot;I was born here. My children were born here, and my grandchildren were born here. I&#x27;m African, not British.&quot;

===Final years and death===

Smith travelled to South Africa for medical treatment in 2005, and moved into a retirement home overlooking the sea in St James, a southern suburb of Cape Town. He was reportedly devastated by the death of his son Alec from a heart attack at London Heathrow Airport in January 2006. Despite some marked differences—Alec had used illegal drugs in his youth, and openly opposed his father&#x27;s policies while he was Prime Minister—they had been very close. The elder Smith had referred to his son as &quot;my rock&quot;. Smith&#x27;s stepdaughter Jean, who had married the prominent Rhodesian singer-songwriter Clem Tholet in 1967, was by this time also widowed. She and Robert Smith cared for their stepfather in his final years.

After some weeks of illness, Ian Smith died in Cape Town on 20 November 2007 at the age of 88, having had a stroke. Jean was with him. His ashes were returned to Zimbabwe and scattered by his family at Gwenoro. The farm continued to operate under the ownership of Smith&#x27;s stepchildren until December 2012, when it was seized by the Zimbabwe government as part of the land reform programme and given to a technical college.

Investigations into alleged electoral fraud during the 2008 presidential and parliamentary elections in Zimbabwe, when ZANU–PF was accused of using dead &quot;ghost voters&quot; to counter Morgan Tsvangirai and the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), revealed that Smith and hundreds of thousands of other dead people were still on the electoral roll. According to the Zimbabwe Election Support Network&#x27;s audit report, published in 2011, deceased &quot;voters&quot; made up 27% of the registered electorate. Mugabe had insisted during his ultimately victorious campaign in 2008 that he would not allow the MDC to take power even if it won, asserting that &quot;only God&quot; could remove him from office. Smith was finally struck off the voters&#x27; roll in April 2013, along with 345,000 other dead people. Mugabe resigned the presidency four years later, after ZANU–PF moved to impeach him amid a military coup.

==Character, reputation and legacy==
&quot;Smith was a simple man,&quot; Graham Boynton wrote soon after his death, &quot;and it was his rather humourless, one-dimensional Rhodesian-ness that at once made him a hero among his own people and a figure of derision among his enemies&quot;. As leader of the Rhodesian Front and its successors, he was the foremost figure of his country&#x27;s white community—a &quot;symbol and father figure&quot;, in Mordechai Tamarkin&#x27;s phrase, who as Prime Minister &quot;personified white Rhodesia&quot;. Supporters hailed him as &quot;a political visionary ... who understood the uncomfortable truths of Africa&quot;; while a Marxist politician denounced him as &quot;an unrepentant racist ... who brought untold suffering to millions of Zimbabweans&quot;.

His determination to preserve the white minority&#x27;s position in Rhodesia caused many black Africans and others to perceive him as a symbol of iniquitous white rule and racism. Smith always denied being driven by racial prejudice—in a 1987 interview he asserted that he had been defending Western principles and that &quot;it was Marxism I fought, not blacks&quot;. Above all, he never expressed regret regarding his actions as prime minister; he insisted to his final days that the effects of Mugabe&#x27;s presidency had borne out his predictions and proven him right.

&quot;The key to understanding Smith,&quot; Johnson wrote, &quot;was that, like other white Rhodesians, he clung to an almost Victorian view of the world both in moral values and in the easy assumptions of British primacy that characterised the empire.&quot; Bill Schwarz took a similar line, writing that Smith and his supporters reacted to the British Empire&#x27;s demise by imagining white Rhodesians to be &quot;the final survivors of a lost civilisation&quot;, charged with &quot;tak[ing] on the mantle of historic Britain&quot; in the imperial power&#x27;s absence. &quot;He spoke endlessly about how Rhodesians had been more British than the British,&quot; Boynton reflected, &quot;and how this small community of decent, fair-minded whites had been betrayed by, well, just about everybody he could think of ... It was easy to mock Ian Smith, but he was right—both about the betrayals and about the quality of most African politicians&quot;. Smith&#x27;s &quot;not in 1,000 years&quot; quote dominated his obituaries, a development that Peter Godwin, despite his critical stance regarding Smith and his policies, considered &quot;unfair and inaccurate&quot;: &quot;Over the years it has become shorn of all context and compressed into a free-floating clip that has now become his epitaph ... But there is more than enough for which to quite legitimately criticise Smith, without resorting to fabrication.&quot;

Memories of his travails on the UK&#x27;s behalf during the Second World War—&quot;undoubtedly the central experience of his life&quot;, according to Johnson—were fundamental to the sense of profound betrayal Smith felt when the UK government proved one of his main adversaries as prime minister. The wartime plastic surgery that corrected the wounds to his face left its right side paralysed, giving him a crooked smile and a somewhat blank expression, while his bodily injuries gave him a stoop and a slight limp; he also could not sit for long periods without pain. The post-colonial UK Smith encountered as prime minister seemed to him &quot;foreign and somewhat effete&quot;, to quote Kenneth Young, while Smith was &quot;a foreigner in all but language to most British politicians—a man of convictions so outdated, of tastes so naive, as to make mutual understanding almost impossible.&quot; Smith held most of the British politicians he dealt with in extremely low esteem, considering them to have pushed him and his country into an impossible position where, he asserted in 1970, the decision to take unilateral action was &quot;forced upon us&quot;.

By contemporaries and opponents alike, Smith was widely recognised as a formidable and strong-willed negotiator. Hempstone considered him &quot;a man too principled (or short-sighted) to compromise with what he regards as wrong&quot;, while Welensky compared dealing with him to &quot;trying to nail jelly to a wall&quot;. According to his RF colleague P. K. van der Byl, Smith had an &quot;iron nerve&quot;; he additionally gained a reputation for his &quot;icy calm&quot;, as he almost never got angry or raised his voice. His public profile divided people: He spoke with &quot;a nasal monologue&quot; as Peter Younghusband described it—&quot;uninspiring even by Rhodesian oratorical standards&quot;. In contrast, his open, informal association with the general public fostered the impression among white Rhodesians that their prime minister was still an &quot;ordinary, decent fellow&quot;, which Berlyn cites as a major factor in his enduring popularity. Welensky described him in 1978 as wielding an &quot;almost hypnotic influence&quot; over the Rhodesian electorate, which helped him to win &quot;election after election ... hands down&quot;. His character was recognised by his opponents as well; one militant, quoted anonymously by &quot;People&quot; magazine in 1976, asserted that &quot;If we had a leader like Mr. Smith, we would have won long ago.&quot; ZANU founder Ndabaningi Sithole described him in similar terms: &quot;Smith is a fighter. He put up a great fight for his people. We were like two bulls in there, the way we fought. He is a man. I respect him.&quot;

Reflecting his divisive legacy, Smith&#x27;s death ignited mixed reactions in Zimbabwe: then-Deputy Minister of Information Bright Matonga was reported as saying &quot;Good riddance&quot; during a radio appearance, later telling Reuters that he would &quot;not be mourned or missed here by any decent person&quot;. Reactions from the Zimbabwean public differed: reflecting the country&#x27;s economic downturn under Mugabe, members interviewed by media outlet The Week expressed nostalgia for his premiership as one of stability and prosperity, while simultaneously remembering his strident opposition to majority rule. After Smith&#x27;s death, MDC politician and senator Patrick Kombayi said that Zimbabweans had much for which to thank Smith. &quot;The roads that we are using today were all built by Smith,&quot; he said. &quot;All the infrastructure is Smith&#x27;s. We never suffered the way we are suffering now because Smith took care of the economy that supported all people and they had enough to eat. When he left power the [British] pound was on a par with the Zimbabwean dollar, but President Mugabe has killed all that.&quot; David Coltart, another MDC politician, issued a statement after Smith&#x27;s death praising him as a man of modesty and integrity, but criticising what Coltart felt to be &quot;disastrous political decisions as Prime Minister&quot;; Coltart considered Smith&#x27;s policies to have radicalised black nationalists, fomented Mugabe&#x27;s rise to power and thereby &quot;directly contributed to the trauma that Zimbabwe is suffering from today&quot;. Godwin took a similar line, describing the emergency powers Smith used to combat black nationalists as &quot;draconian&quot;; he also pointed out that these &quot;levers of repression&quot; had formed the base for much of what Mugabe later did. Lord Carrington spoke scathingly about Smith in a 2005 interview with Heidi Holland, saying he disliked both Smith and Mugabe but would choose the latter if he &quot;absolutely had to choose&quot;; Smith was, in his opinion, &quot;a bigoted, stupid man&quot; responsible for all of Zimbabwe&#x27;s problems. At the time of his death, some commentators argued that perception of his legacy had seen an improvement among black Zimbabweans as well. &quot;Smith&#x27;s image improved inversely as Mugabe&#x27;s plummeted,&quot; Johnson wrote. &quot;When he walked the streets of Harare, Africans would almost queue up to grasp his hand and wish him well.&quot; &quot;If you were to go to Harare [in 2007] and ask ordinary black Zimbabweans who they would rather have as their leader—Smith or Mugabe—the answer would be almost unanimous&quot;, Boynton asserted; &quot;And it would not be Mugabe.&quot;

<text>A torana (; &quot;[tawr-uh-nuh]&quot;) is a free-standing ornamental or arched gateway for ceremonial purposes in Hindu, Buddhist and Jain architecture of the Indian subcontinent. Toranas can also be widely seen in Southeast Asia and parts of East Asia. Chinese Shanmen gateways, Japanese &quot;torii&quot; gateways, Korean Iljumun and Hongsalmun gateways, Vietnamese Tam quan gateways, and Thai Sao Ching Cha were derived from the Indian &quot;torana&quot;. They are also referred to as &quot;vandanamalikas&quot;.

==History==

Indologist art historian and archaeologist Percy Brown has traced the origin of &quot;torana&quot; from the -dvara (village-gateways) of the vedic era (1500 BCE – 500 BCE) village which later developed as a popular adornment for cities, places, and sacred shrines. According to the vedic text, the Arthasastra, gateways of different forms were to adorn the entrance to a city or a palace.

A granite stone fragment of an arch discovered by K. P. Jayaswal from Kumhrar, Pataliputra has been analysed as a pre Mauryan Nanda period keystone fragment of a trefoil arch of gateway with mason&#x27;s marks of three archaic Brahmi letters inscribed on it which probably decorated a torana. The wedge shaped stone with indentation has mauryan polish on two sides and was suspended vertically.

In the Mauryan Empire, the archaeological evidence shows the toranas of Sanchi Stupa dates back to the 3rd century BCE. The form of the Sanchi &quot;torana&quot; appears to reflect earlier examples in wood, which was popular in Indian architecture before the 3rd century BCE.

In Kalinga architecture we can see the torana in many temples built from the 7th to 12th centuries. Jagannath Temple, Puri, Rajarani Temple and Mukteswar Temple are the few example of Kalinga architecture having torana.

In Gujarat, several &quot;torana&quot;s were built under the Chaulukya dynasty (10th-12th century), mostly associated with temples, such as Kirti Toran in Vadnagar.

==Types of &quot;torana&quot;==
There are many different types of &quot;toranas&quot;, such as, patra-torana (on the scrolls or gateway adornment made of leaves), puspa-torana (made of flowers), ratna-torana (made of precious stones), stambha-torana (made on pillars), -torana (made of paintings), -torana (adornment made on walls, such as over the wall recess or false portals and windows, could even be a specific type of wall painting) and -toranas (appended adornment over a gateway (e.g. toran) or an adorned gateways itself). These are mentioned in the medieval Indian architectural treatises.

==Socio-religious significance of &quot;torana&quot;==

&quot;Torana&quot; is a sacred or honorific gateway in Buddhist and Hindu architecture. Its typical form is a projecting cross-piece resting on two uprights or posts. It is made of wood or stone, and the cross-piece is generally of three bars placed one on the top of the other; both cross-piece and posts are usually sculpted.

Toranas are associated with Buddhist stupas like the &quot;Great Stupa&quot; in Sanchi, as well as with Jain and Hindu structures, and also with several secular structures. Symbolic toranas can also be made of flowers and even leaves and hung over the doors and at entrances, particularly in Western and Southern India. They are believed to bring good fortune and signify auspicious and festive occasions. They can also serve didactic and narrative purposes or be erected to mark the victory of a king.

During the Vesak festival of Sri Lanka it is a tradition to erect electrically illuminated colorful Vesak &quot;toranas&quot; in public places. These decorations are temporary installations which remain in public display for couple of weeks starting from the day of Vesak.

== &quot;Thorana&quot; (Vesak)==
During the Vesak festival of Sri Lanka it is a tradition to erect electrically illuminated colorful Vesak Pandols (Thorana) in public places (usually organized by communities, trade organisations). These decorations are temporary installations which remain in public display for couple of weeks starting from the day of Vesak. Moreover, these large structures attracts so many locals in Sri Lanka, and also foreign people from around the world. 

==Usage outside India==
=== East and Southeast Asia ===
Many places that were part of the Greater India and Indosphere were Indianised, as great deal of cultural exchange with India took place in ancient times, examples of cultural and religious practices influenced by the Indian practices include Thai, Chinese, Korean, Japanese and other South Asian, East Asian and Southeast Asian cultures. For example, Benzaiten is a Japanese name for the Hindu goddess Saraswati, and the ancient Siddhaṃ script, which disappeared from India by 1200 CE, is still written by monks in Japan.

Ancient Indian &quot;torna&quot; sacred gateway architecture has influenced gateway architecture across Asia specially where Buddhism was transmitted from India; Chinese &quot;paifang&quot; gateways Japanese &quot;torii&quot; gateways, Korean &quot;hongsalmun&quot; gateway, and Sao Ching Cha in Thailand have been derived from the Indian &quot;torana&quot;. The functions of all are similar, but they generally differ based on their respective architectural styles.

Torana Gate, Malaysia, a &quot;torana&quot; gateway) in Brickfields in Kuala Lumpur, is a gift from the Government of India to Malaysia, construction of which in design identical to the Sanchi Stupa was completed in 2015.

====&quot;Torii&quot; in Japan====

The &quot;torii&quot;, a gateway erected on the approach to every Shinto shrine, was derived from the Indian &quot;torana&quot;. According to several scholars, the vast evidence shows how the &quot;torii&quot;, both etymologically and architecturally, were originally derived from the &quot;torana&quot;, a free-standing sacred ceremonial gateway which marks the entrance of a sacred enclosure, such as Hindu-Buddhist temple or shrine, or city.

====&quot;Hongsalmun&quot; gateways and &quot;Iljumun&quot; gates in Korea====

The &quot;hongsalmun&quot; is a gate for entering a sacred place in Korea. It is arranged by two round poles set vertically and two transverse bars. It has no roof and door-gate, and placed on the middle top gate is a symbol of the &quot;trisula&quot; and the taegeuk image. &quot;Hongsalmun&quot; are usually erected to indicate Korean Confucian sites, such as shrines, tombs, and academies such as &quot;hyanggyo&quot; and &quot;seowon&quot;.

====&quot;Paifang&quot; in China====

The &quot;paifang&quot;, also known as a &quot;pailou&quot;, is a traditional style of Chinese architectural arch or gateway structure. Originally derived from Indian &quot;torana&quot; through the introduction of Buddhism to China, it has evolved into many styles and has been introduced to other East Asian countries such as Korea, Japan, and Vietnam.

<doc id="205140" wikidata="Q26626" url="?curid=205140" title="Sandpiper">
<text>Scolopacidae is a large family of shorebirds, or waders, which mainly includes many species known as sandpipers, but also others such as woodcocks, curlews and snipes. Most of these species eat small invertebrates picked out of the mud or soil. Different lengths of bills enable multiple species to feed in the same habitat, particularly on the coast, without direct competition for food.

Sandpipers have long bodies and legs, and narrow wings. Most species have a narrow bill, but the form and length are variable. They are small to medium-sized birds, measuring in length. The bills are sensitive, allowing the birds to feel the mud and sand as they probe for food. They generally have dull plumage, with cryptic brown, grey, or streaked patterns, although some display brighter colours during the breeding season.

Most species nest in open areas and defend their territories with aerial displays. The nest itself is a simple scrape in the ground, in which the bird typically lays three or four eggs. The young of most species are precocial.

==Taxonomy==
The family Scolopacidae was introduced (as Scolopacea) by the French polymath Constantine Samuel Rafinesque in 1815. The family contains 98 extant or recently extinct species divided into 15 genera. For more details, see the article List of sandpiper species.

The following genus-level cladogram of the Scolopacidae is based on a study by David Černý and Rossy Natale that was published in 2022.

==Evolution==
The early fossil record is scant for a group that was probably present at the non-avian dinosaurs&#x27; extinction. &quot;&quot;Totanus&quot; teruelensis&quot; (Late Miocene of Los Mansuetos (Spain) is sometimes considered a scolopacid – maybe a shank – but may well be a larid; little is known of it.

&quot;Paractitis&quot; has been named from the Early Oligocene of Saskatchewan (Canada), while &quot;Mirolia&quot; is known from the Middle Miocene at Deiningen in the Nördlinger Ries (Germany). Most living genera would seem to have evolved throughout the Oligocene to Miocene with the waders perhaps a bit later; see the genus accounts for the fossil record.

In addition there are some indeterminable remains that might belong to extant genera or their extinct relatives:
* Scolopacidae gen. et sp. indet. (Middle Miocene of Františkovy Lázně, Czech Republic – Late Miocene of Kohfidisch, Austria)
* Scolopacidae gen. et sp. indet. (Edson Early Pliocene of Sherman County, USA)

==Description==

The sandpipers exhibit considerable range in size and appearance, the wide range of body forms reflecting a wide range of ecological niches. Sandpipers range in size from the least sandpiper, at as little as and in length, to the Far Eastern curlew, at up to in length, and the Eurasian curlew, at up to . Within species there is considerable variation in patterns of sexual dimorphism. Males are larger than females in ruffs and several sandpipers, but are smaller than females in the knots, curlews, phalaropes and godwits. The sexes are similarly sized in the snipes, woodcock and tringine sandpipers. Compared to the other large family of wading birds, the plovers (Charadriidae), they tend to have smaller eyes, more slender heads, and longer thinner bills. Some are quite long-legged, and most species have three forward pointing toes with a smaller hind toe (the exception is the sanderling, which lacks a hind toe).

Sandpipers are more geared towards tactile foraging methods than the plovers, which favour more visual foraging methods, and this is reflected in the high density of tactile receptors in the tips of their bills. These receptors are housed in a slight horny swelling at the tip of the bill (except for the surfbird and the two turnstones). Bill shape is highly variable within the family, reflecting differences in feeding ecology. Bill length relative to head length varies from three times the length of the head in the long-billed curlew to just under half the head length in the Tuamotu sandpiper. Bills may be straight, slightly upcurled or strongly downcurved. Like all birds, the bills of sandpipers are capable of cranial kinesis, literally being able to move the bones of the skull (other than the obvious movement of the lower jaw) and specifically bending the upper jaw without opening the entire jaw, an act known as rhynchokinesis. It has been hypothesized this helps when probing by allowing the bill to be partly opened with less force and improving manipulation of prey items in the substrate. Rhynchokinesis is also used by sandpipers feeding on prey in water to catch and manipulate prey.

==Distribution, habitat, and movements==

The sandpipers have a cosmopolitan distribution, occurring across most of the world&#x27;s land surfaces except for Antarctica and the driest deserts. A majority of the family breed at moderate to high latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere, in fact accounting for the most northerly breeding birds in the world. Only a few species breed in tropical regions, ten of which are snipes and woodcocks and the remaining species being the unusual Tuamotu sandpiper, which breeds in French Polynesia (although prior to the arrival of humans in the Pacific there were several other closely related species of Polynesian sandpiper).

==Diet and feeding==
There are broadly four feeding styles employed by the sandpipers, although many species are flexible and may use more than one style. The first is pecking with occasional probing, usually done by species in drier habitats that do not have soft soils or mud. The second, and most frequent, method employed is probing soft soils, muds and sands for prey. The third, used by &quot;Tringa&quot; shanks, involves running in shallow water with the bill under the water chasing fish, a method that uses sight as well as tactile senses. The final method, employed by the phalaropes and some &quot;Calidris&quot; sandpipers, involves pecking at the water for small prey. A few species of scolopacids are omnivorous to some extent, taking seeds and shoots as well as invertebrates.

== Breeding ==
Many sandpipers form monogamous pairs, but some sandpipers have female-only parental care, some male-only parental care, some sequential polyandry and other compete for the mate on the lek. Sandpipers lay three or four eggs into the nest, which is usually a vague depression or scrape in the open ground, scarcely lined with soft vegetation. In species where both parents incubate the eggs, females and males share their incubation duties in various ways both within and between species. In some pairs, parents exchange on the nest in the morning and in the evening so that their incubation rhythm follows a 24-hour day, in others each sex may sit on the nest continuously for up to 24 hours before it is exchanged by its partner. In species where only a single parent incubates the eggs, during the night the parent sits on the eggs nearly continuously and then during the warmest part of a day leaves the nest for short feeding bouts. Chicks hatch after about three weeks of incubation and are able to walk and forage within a few hours of hatching. A single parent or both parents guide and brood the chicks.

<doc id="205141" wikidata="Q5436913" url="?curid=205141" title="Fast ferry scandal">
<text>The fast ferry scandal was a political affair in the late 1990s relating to the construction of three fast ferries by the Canadian provincial crown corporation BC Ferries under direction of the Executive Council of British Columbia, headed at the time by Premier Glen Clark of the New Democratic Party.

In addition to major delays and cost overruns, the ferries never fully met their original specifications, and only operated briefly in a reduced capacity, before being auctioned off at a substantial loss by the subsequently elected BC Liberal Party government.

A review was later conducted by British Columbia Auditor General George L. Morfitt.

==High-speed ferries==
The provincial government at the time, led by New Democratic Party (NDP) premier Glen Clark, used provincial Crown corporation BC Ferries to advance its economic goal of supporting British Columbia&#x27;s shipbuilding industry by creating a fleet of custom-designed high-speed catamaran passenger/vehicle ferries for BC Ferries. The eventual goal was to use aluminum from Alcan smelted in British Columbia (BC), to create jobs building aluminum boats for the international market. The vessels were to be built by private shipyards under the overview of a new provincial Crown corporation to be called Catamaran Ferries International (CFI).

==Public goals of the fast ferry program==
A major impetus for the project was to have BC Ferries spend locally some of the billions that needed to be spent on new ships. The development of Duke Point, the truck ferry terminal south of Nanaimo, and the new island freeway allowed the north Nanaimo ferry terminal to focus on the passenger market. Large trucks were to be banned from the north Nanaimo terminal and moved to an alternate Duke Point truck ferry.

The improvement promised was to deliver more frequent service (travel time reduced by 30 minutes), with smaller-capacity ships (250 cars vs. 365). The smaller ferries required 17 fewer staff per vessel to operate the same route, reducing operating costs.

* Less waiting traffic at Horseshoe Bay terminal as backlogs often blocked access to the Sea-to-Sky Highway.
* Fewer vehicles clogging residential streets upon each arrival of the existing ferries
* An end to noisy truck traffic in the villages of Horseshoe Bay and Departure Bay (the Horseshoe Bay terminal is at the bottom of a long, steep hill on which several fatal truck-related accidents have occurred)
*Skills and training. The $450 million fast ferry costs total includes the assistance to the ship yards to upgrade yards and build new and expand buildings, and the purchase of specialized aluminum cutters and welding equipment. Approximately 350 people received training in welding, and 250 of these welders received international certification in aluminum welding required for high speed aluminum craft.

==Political goals of the fast ferry program==
Perhaps more important than the need for a more efficient ferry system was the NDP government&#x27;s desire to rebuild and collect taxes from the shipbuilding industry of British Columbia. During the early 1900s, shipbuilding in British Columbia was at its greatest, in support of a booming fishing industry. During World War II, shipbuilding again peaked with the delivery of two 10,000-ton freighters every week. By the 1990s, however, shipbuilding in British Columbia was nearly dead due, in-part, to the ballooning cost of materials, high labour costs, labour disputes, and increasing competition from Asian shipyards.

Faced with potential collapse of the local ship building industry, the British Columbia government initiated the fast ferry program, expecting local shipbuilders could emulate the success of Australian shipbuilders such as Austal and Incat.

In the early planning stages of the project, Australian fast ferry operator Holyman, then one of the biggest and most experienced fast ferry operators in the world, was in talks with BC Ferries and the NDP government. Holyman&#x27;s managing director and its global development manager met with the minister for transport and cautioned him against the BC Ferries FastCat plan. They suggested that a first time builder would find it impossible to construct the vessels on time, within budget, or within weight specification. They also suggested that the intended power would be insufficient to meet targeted speed, even if the vessels were built within weight. Finally, they suggested that the ongoing maintenance and operation of fast ferries required specialized expertise. The company offered its expertise to the government.

==PacifiCat fleet==

The vessels built for BC Ferries were intended to improve ferry service between the mainland terminal of Horseshoe Bay (in West Vancouver) and the Vancouver Island terminal at Departure Bay (in Nanaimo).

The three vessels were built between 1998 and 2000 and were named as follows:
* &quot;PacifiCat Explorer&quot; (1998)
* &quot;PacifiCat Discovery&quot; (1999)
* &quot;PacifiCat Voyager&quot; (2000)

Technically, &quot;PacifiCat Voyager&quot; was never part of the BC Ferries fleet, as it was christened but never commissioned; by the time this vessel was ready for deployment, the bottom had already fallen out of the fast ferry program.

The vessels had a service speed of 37 knots (68 km/h) and a capacity for 250 car-equivalents and 1000 passengers. The hulls of all three vessels had slightly varying murals that depict a cougar.

Due to various oversights by the government, BC Ferries, design bureaus, and the shipyards, the cost of the program more than doubled from $210 million ($70 million/vessel) to almost $460 million ($150 million/vessel) and final delivery was almost 3 years behind schedule. As with all prototype construction this cost and build time was gradually being reduced with each successive completion. A large part of the delay was because the shipyards commissioned to construct the vessels had very little experience working with aluminum. Also design changes during construction caused delays and more costs. Previously, construction of aluminum vessels in British Columbia had been limited to fishing boats and special-purpose vessels. The construction of three dual-hulled 122.5 m catamarans represented a very large leap of faith by the government in British Columbia shipyards.

The first fastcat began service between Horseshoe Bay and Nanaimo in June 1999 and the second fastcat began operating in November 1999. The ferries had the following problems during their brief tenure:

* High fuel consumption. The four 8,375 brake horsepower (6.2 MW) engines driving their waterjets required more fuel, &quot;up to twice that of conventional vessels&quot;. Fully loaded and traveling at top speed of 34 knots/ 63 km an hour required the engines to be used at 90% power.
* Due to an unusually wet and windy winter, there was a higher than normal amount of flotsam in the waters along the route, some of which was sucked into impellers for the ferries&#x27; engines, causing breakdowns and sailing cancellations.
* When operated at full speed, the Pacificat fleet created a wake which was reported to have damaged waterfront wharves and property in coastal areas near the two terminals. This required that the ferries reduce speed in certain areas and alter course in others, reducing their speed advantage.
* The air on vehicle decks became uncomfortably warm, either from the heat of the vessel engines or lack of air circulation. This made some people wary of bringing pets aboard the FastCats; however, the ferries had kennels with improved air circulation at the bow and stern of the vehicle decks.
* There was little outside deck space for passengers. The existing ferries had large decks, and it was common for passengers to spend the entire sailing circling the decks of the ship or sunbathing on the lifejacket containers.
* The ships had interiors that were perceived by passengers as being cramped compared to the existing ferries.
* Loading took longer than the older ferries due to balancing issues. This further negated the ships&#x27; speed advantage.

After a change in leadership, the new premier of BC, Ujjal Dosanjh, placed the ferries up for sale. A subsequent election virtually eliminated the New Democratic Party from the legislature, and Gordon Campbell of the BC Liberals auctioned off the PacifiCat fleet on March 24, 2003, for $19.4 million ($6.5 million/vessel) to Washington Marine Group. Further controversy erupted when it was revealed that the same company, which is a prominent financial backer of the Liberal Party, had offered $60 million for the vessels prior to the auction, on the condition that BC would then rent the ferries. Some claimed the aluminum ships were worth more as scrap. Others said Indonesians were prepared to pay as much as $88 million.

==Projected uses==
In September 2005, the media reported that the Washington Marine Group had expressed interest in operating a fast ferry service from Downtown Vancouver to a point on Vancouver Island. When questioned, representatives of WMG indicated that they are actively searching for suitable applications for the Fast Ferries and they would not rule out such a service.

On December 16, 2005, WMG confirmed that it is considering putting the ferries into service from North Vancouver to Duke Point (near Nanaimo) to compete with the BC Ferries routes. WMG at one point said they intended to make a decision by the spring of 2006.

As of July 2009 the ferries had been sold for use in the United Arab Emirates. They were later found tied up in the port of Alexandria, Egypt in late 2022.

In January 2024, the ferries were listed for sale on Facebook Marketplace by an Egyptian company that was planning to scrap them if they went unsold.

==Primary factors for project failure==
The primary factor for the project failure was the overall cost of building three fast ferries being substantially more than advertised at the outset of the project in 1994, when it was projected to cost $210 million.

The press called BC Auditor General Morfitt&#x27;s comments perhaps the most damning report the BC Auditor General&#x27;s office has ever issued. His report stated significant breakdowns in governance and project management were major factors in the failure of the fast ferry project. These breakdowns were identified as follows in Morfitt&#x27;s report:

Governance:
* The Ministry of Transportation and Highways was involved in the project to the point where, at times, board decisions were forced under directives rather than a result of due diligence.
* During the project, the BC Ferries’ subsidiary Catamaran Ferries International (CFI) board, responsible for managing the project, was replaced in its entirety without just cause in order to allow for more representation by B.C. Ferries. This action appeared to be a misunderstanding of good practice.
* During the project, the chief executive officer for CFI, Tom Ward, also held the same position at BC Ferries. By representing both the constructor and the future owner and operator of the fast ferries, it made it difficult to objectively report on progress without implicating himself in almost every aspect of the project. Thus, little or wrong information was available throughout the project.
* Little or no research was completed to establish the contributing factors that led to the decline of B.C.’s shipbuilding industry. Information on current infrastructure, competencies and viable partnerships was not analyzed.
* Despite opportunities, careful re-evaluation of the project was not undertaken.
* No clear reporting structure or government expectations existed to guide the project.
* BC Ferries had initially recommended that a comparable ferry be leased for trials in coastal waters, but the government decided to forego testing and committed to the construction project, regardless.

Project management:
* A risk analysis was not completed prior to the decision to proceed being made.
* The approved budget and timeline was established for the project without research and prior to the completion of design specifications or selection of contractor.
* The fast ferry business plan was not completed prior to project commencement due to the rushed nature of the project.
* Time and cost was poorly managed due to the inability to secure a fixed-cost contract with an experienced supplier.

The auditor general report was later criticized in a Legislative standing committee by MLA Rick Kasper for ignoring and not accounting the benefits to BC and Canada in income taxes etc. from building the ships in BC.

<doc id="205142" wikidata="Q202686" url="?curid=205142" title="Commonwealth realm">
<text>A Commonwealth realm is one of a group of sovereign states within the Commonwealth of Nations that have the same person, currently King Charles III, as their monarch and head of state. All the realms are independent of each other, although one person, resident in the United Kingdom, acts as monarch of each. Except for the UK, in each of the realms the monarch is represented by a governor-general. The phrase &quot;Commonwealth realm&quot; is an informal description not used in any law.

, there are 15 Commonwealth realms: Antigua and Barbuda, Australia, The Bahamas, Belize, Canada, Grenada, Jamaica, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Solomon Islands, Tuvalu, and the United Kingdom. While the Commonwealth of Nations has 56 independent member states, only these 15 have Charles III as head of state. He is also Head of the Commonwealth, a non-constitutional role.

The notion of these states sharing the same person as their monarch traces back to 1867 when Canada became the first dominion, a self-governing nation of the British Empire; others, such as Australia (1901) and New Zealand (1907), followed. With the growing independence of the dominions in the 1920s, the Balfour Declaration of 1926 established the Commonwealth of Nations and that the nations were considered &quot;equal in status ... though united by a common allegiance to the Crown&quot;. The &quot;Statute of Westminster 1931&quot; further set the relationship between the realms and the Crown, including a convention that any alteration to the line of succession in any one country must be voluntarily approved by all the others. The modern Commonwealth of Nations was then formally constituted by the London Declaration in 1949 when India wanted to become a republic without leaving the Commonwealth; this left seven independent nations sharing the Crown: Australia, Canada, Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), New Zealand, Pakistan, South Africa, and the United Kingdom. Since then, new realms have been created through the independence of former colonies and dependencies; Saint Kitts and Nevis is the youngest extant realm, becoming one in 1983. Some realms became republics; Barbados changed from being a realm to a republic in 2021.

==List==
There are currently 15 Commonwealth realms scattered across three continents (nine in North America, five in Oceania, and one in Europe), with a combined area of (excluding the Antarctic claims which would raise the figure to ) and a population of more than 150 million.
==Interrelationship==
The Commonwealth realms are sovereign states. They are united only in their voluntary connection with the institution of the monarchy, the succession, and the King himself; the person of the sovereign and the Crown were said in 1936 to be &quot;the most important and vital link&quot; between the dominions. Political scientist Peter Boyce called this grouping of countries associated in this manner &quot;an achievement without parallel in the history of international relations or constitutional law.&quot; Terms such as &quot;personal union&quot;, a &quot;form of personal union&quot;, and &quot;shared monarchy&quot;, among others, have all been advanced as definitions since the beginning of the Commonwealth itself, though there has been no agreement on which term is most accurate.

Under the Balfour Declaration of 1926, dominions were proclaimed to be &quot;equal in status, in no way subordinate one to another in any aspect of their domestic or external affairs, though united by a common allegiance to the Crown&quot; and the monarch is the leader &quot;equally, officially, and explicitly of separate, autonomous realms&quot;. Andrew Michie wrote in 1952 that &quot;Elizabeth II embodies in her own person many monarchies: she is Queen of Great Britain, but she is equally Queen of Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Pakistan, South Africa, and Ceylon ... It is now possible for Elizabeth II to be, in practice as well as theory, equally Queen in all her realms.&quot; Still, Boyce holds the contrary opinion that the crowns of all the non-British realms are &quot;derivative, if not subordinate&quot; to the crown of the United Kingdom.

Since each realm has the same person as its monarch, the diplomatic practice of exchanging ambassadors with letters of credence and recall from one head of state to another does not apply. Diplomatic relations between the Commonwealth realms are thus at a cabinet level only, and high commissioners are exchanged between realms (though all other countries in the Commonwealth of Nations also follow this same practice, for traditional reasons). A high commissioner&#x27;s full title will thus be &quot;High Commissioner Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary for His Majesty&#x27;s Government in [Country]&quot;. For certain ceremonies, the order of precedence for the realms&#x27; high commissioners or national flags is set according to the chronological order of, first, when the country became a dominion and then the date on which the country gained independence.

Conflicts of interest have arisen from this relationship amongst independent states. Some have been minor diplomatic matters, such as the monarch expressing on the advice of one of his/her cabinets views that counter those of another of his/her cabinets. More serious issues have arisen with respect to armed conflict, where the monarch, as head of state of two different realms, may be simultaneously at war and at peace with a third country, or even at war with themself as head of two hostile nations.

==Crown&#x27;s role==

The evolution of dominions into realms resulted in the Crown having a shared and a separate character, with one human equally monarch of each state and acting as such in right of a particular realm as a distinct legal person guided only by the advice of the cabinet of that jurisdiction. This means that in different contexts, the term &quot;Crown&quot; may refer to the extra-national institution associating all 15 countries, or to the Crown in each realm considered separately. In Australia, it has been suggested that the Crown is further divided, with it possible that the monarchy in each of the states is a separate institution, equal in status to each other. The monarchy is therefore no longer an exclusively British institution.
From a cultural standpoint, the sovereign&#x27;s name, image and other royal symbols unique to each nation are visible in the emblems and insignia of governmental institutions and militia. Elizabeth II&#x27;s effigy, for example, appears on coins and banknotes in some countries, and an oath of allegiance to the King is usually required from politicians, judges, military members and new citizens. By 1959, it was being asserted by Buckingham Palace officials that the Queen was &quot;equally at home in all her realms&quot;.

Robert Hazell and Bob Morris argued in 2017 that there are five aspects to the monarchy of the Commonwealth realms: the constitutional monarchy, including the royal prerogative and the use thereof on the advice of local ministers or according to convention or statute law; the national monarchy, comprising the functions of the head of state beyond the purely constitutional; the international monarchy, where the monarch is head of state in the 15 realms and holds the position of head of the Commonwealth; the religious monarchy, meaning the sovereign as head of the Church of England and his relationship with the Presbyterian Church of Scotland; and the welfare/service monarchy, wherein the sovereign and other members of the royal family give their patronage to charities and other elements of civil society.

===Succession and regency===
To guarantee the continuity of multiple states sharing the same person as monarch, the preamble of the &quot;Statute of Westminster 1931&quot; laid out a convention that any alteration to the line of succession in any one country must be voluntarily approved by the parliaments of all the realms. This convention was first applied in 1936 when the British government conferred with the dominion governments during the Edward VIII abdication crisis. Prime Minister of Canada William Lyon Mackenzie King pointed out that the &quot;Statute of Westminster&quot; required Canada&#x27;s request and consent to any legislation passed by the British parliament before it could become part of Canada&#x27;s laws and affect the line of succession in Canada. Sir Maurice Gwyer, first parliamentary counsel in the UK, reflected this position, stating that the &quot;Act of Settlement&quot; was a part of the law in each dominion. Though today the &quot;Statute of Westminster&quot; is law only in Canada, Australia and the United Kingdom, the convention of approval from the other realms was reasserted by the Perth Agreement of 2011, in which all 16 realms at the time agreed in principle to change the succession rule to absolute primogeniture, to remove the restriction on the monarch being married to a Catholic, and to reduce the number of members of the Royal Family who need the monarch&#x27;s permission to marry. These changes came into effect on 26 March 2015. Alternatively, a Commonwealth realm may choose to cease being such by making its throne the inheritance of a different royal house or by becoming a republic, actions to which, though they alter the country&#x27;s royal succession, the convention does not apply.
Agreement among the realms does not mean the succession laws cannot diverge. During the abdication crisis in 1936, the United Kingdom passed &quot;His Majesty&#x27;s Declaration of Abdication Act&quot; with the approval of the parliament of Australia and the governments of the remaining dominions. (Canada, New Zealand and South Africa gave parliamentary assent later.) The act effected Edward&#x27;s abdication in the United Kingdom on 11 December; as the Canadian government had requested and consented to the act becoming part of Canadian law, and Australia and New Zealand had then not yet adopted the &quot;Statute of Westminster&quot;, the abdication took place in those countries on the same day. The parliament of South Africa passed its own legislation—&quot;His Majesty King Edward the Eighth&#x27;s Abdication Act, 1937&quot;—which backdated the abdication there to 10 December. The Irish Free State recognised the king&#x27;s abdication with the &quot;Executive Authority (External Relations) Act 1936&quot; on 12 December. According to Anne Twomey, this demonstrated &quot;the divisibility of the Crown in the personal, as well as the political, sense&quot;. For E. H. Coghill, writing as early as 1937, it proved that the convention of a common line of succession &quot;is not of imperative force&quot; and Kenneth John Scott asserted in 1962 that it ended the &quot;convention that statutory uniformity on these subjects would be maintained in the parts of the Commonwealth that continued to owe allegiance to the Crown&quot;.

Today, some realms govern succession by their own domestic laws, while others, either by written clauses in their constitution or by convention, stipulate that whoever is monarch of the United Kingdom is automatically also monarch of that realm. It is generally agreed that any unilateral alteration of succession by the UK would not have effect in all the realms.

Following the accession of George VI to the throne, the United Kingdom created legislation that provided for a regency if the monarch was not of age or incapacitated. During debate that law, Sir John Simon opined that each Dominion would have to decide if it needed to legislate with respect to a regency; though, such legislation would not be required until the occasion arose. This was because the governors-general could still perform viceregal functions during a regency in Britain, including giving royal assent to any Dominion law giving effect to a regency in that Dominion. In the United Kingdom, on the other hand, legislation was needed in advance because, otherwise, there would be no one to give assent to a regency law if the sovereign were incapacitated. Though input was sought from the Dominions on the matter, all declined to make themselves bound by the British legislation, agreeing with Simon. Tuvalu later incorporated this principle into its constitution. New Zealand included in its &quot;Constitution Act 1986&quot; a clause specifying that, should a regent be installed in the United Kingdom, that individual would carry out the functions of the monarch of New Zealand.

===Monarch===
The sovereign resides in the oldest realm, the United Kingdom. The king appoints viceroys to perform most of the constitutional and ceremonial duties on his behalf in the other realms: in each, a governor-general as his personal national representative, as well as a lieutenant governor as his representative in each of the Canadian provinces and governor as his representative in each of the Australian states. These appointments are made on the advice of the prime minister of the country or the premier of the province or state concerned, though this process may have additional requirements. The extent to which specific additional powers are reserved exclusively for the monarch varies from realm to realm. On occasions of national importance, the King may be advised to perform in person his constitutional duties, such as granting royal assent or issuing a royal proclamation. Otherwise, all royal powers, including the royal prerogative, are carried out on behalf of the sovereign by the relevant viceroy. In the United Kingdom, the king appoints Counsellors of State to perform his constitutional duties in his absence.

Similarly, the monarch will perform ceremonial duties in the Commonwealth realms to mark historically significant events. Citizens in Commonwealth realms may request birthday or wedding anniversary messages to be sent from the sovereign. This is available for 100th, 105th and beyond for birthdays; and 60th (&quot;Diamond&quot;), 65th, 70th (&quot;Platinum&quot;) and beyond for wedding anniversaries.

====Religion====
It is solely in England that the King plays a role in organised religion where he acts as the Supreme Governor of the Church of England and nominally appoints its bishops and archbishops. In Scotland, he swears an oath to uphold and protect the Church of Scotland and sends a Lord High Commissioner as his representative to meetings of the church&#x27;s General Assembly, when he is not personally in attendance.

==Titles==

Until the early part of the 20th century, the monarch&#x27;s title throughout the British Empire was determined exclusively by the Parliament of the United Kingdom. As the dominions gained importance, the British government began to consult their governments on how the monarch should be titled. Ahead of the coronation of King Edward VII in 1902, the British Secretary of State for the Colonies, Joseph Chamberlain, suggested the King have the title &quot;King of Great Britain and Ireland and of Greater Britain Beyond the Seas&quot;. Canadian officials preferred explicitly mention of the dominions: &quot;King of Great Britain and Ireland, Emperor of India, King of Canada, Australasia, South Africa and all the British Dominions Beyond the Seas&quot;, or, more simply, &quot;King of all the British Dominions Beyond the Seas&quot;. The King favoured the latter suggestion, which was adopted as &quot;[Edward VII] of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and of the British Dominions beyond the Seas King&quot;.

By 1926, following the issuance of the Balfour Declaration, it was determined that the changes in the nature of the Empire needed to be reflected in King George V&#x27;s title (something the King felt to be a &quot;bore&quot;). This led to the &quot;Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act 1927&quot;; though, again, this applied one title to the King across the whole Empire. The preamble to the &quot;Statute of Westminster 1931&quot; established the convention requiring the consent of all the dominions&#x27; parliaments, as well as that of the United Kingdom, to any alterations to the monarch&#x27;s style and title. This first came into play when the &quot;Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act&quot; was amended in 1948, by domestic law in Britain and each of the dominions, to remove George VI&#x27;s title &quot;Emperor of India&quot;. Within the year, discussions about rewording the monarch&#x27;s title began again when Ireland repealed legislation conferring functions on the king. The governments of Pakistan and Canada this time wanted more substantial changes, leading South Africa and Ceylon to also, along with Pakistan, request the elimination of the terms &quot;grace of God&quot; and &quot;defender of the faith&quot;; &quot;by the will of the people&quot; was suggested as a replacement. All that was agreed at the Commonwealth Prime Ministers&#x27; Conference in 1949 was that each of George VI&#x27;s countries should have a different title, but with common elements, and it would be sufficient for each realm&#x27;s parliament to pass a local law.
The matter went unresolved until Elizabeth II became queen in 1952, upon which the realms issued their respective accession proclamations using different titles for their monarch. Debate ensued thereafter. The Australian government preferred that the monarch&#x27;s title name all of the realms, but said it would accept &quot;Elizabeth II (by the Grace of God) of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, [name of realm], and all of her other Realms and Territories Queen, Head of the Commonwealth (Defender of the Faith)&quot;. The South African government objected, stating that did not express the equality of status among the realms. Canadian officials wanted the word &quot;queen&quot; to precede the name of the realm so as to form the term &quot;Queen of Canada&quot;, which they felt expressed Elizabeth&#x27;s distinct role as Canada&#x27;s sovereign. There was even discussion about the placement of a comma following the Queen&#x27;s name and regnal number, with the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations advising the use of punctuation was appropriate, as the term &quot;by the grace of God&quot; had been used in conjunction with the title &quot;king&quot; or &quot;queen&quot; since the reign of William II in the 11th century, whereas it had no such association with the position of head of the Commonwealth; so, Elizabeth II was queen by the grace of God, but her position as head of the Commonwealth was a secular arrangement.

In the end, it was decided the common wording in the titles was to be &quot;Queen of her other Realms and Territories, Head of the Commonwealth&quot;. Regardless, Ceylon and South Africa used &quot;Queen of [Ceylon/South Africa] and her other Realms and Territories&quot;, omitting &quot;by the grace of God&quot; and &quot;defender of the faith&quot;, while Australia, Canada, and New Zealand opted for &quot;of the United Kingdom, [Australia/Canada/New Zealand] and her other Realms and Territories Queen&quot;, keeping &quot;by the grace of God&quot; and &quot;defender of the faith&quot;. Pakistan&#x27;s &quot;Royal Style and Titles Act&quot; simply titled the Queen as &quot;Queen of the United Kingdom and of Her other Realms and Territories, Head of the Commonwealth&quot;.

After Ghana gained independence and became a Commonwealth realm in 1957, its parliament passed the &quot;Royal Style and Titles Act 1957&quot;, which followed the example of Ceylon and South Africa by giving Elizabeth the title &quot;Elizabeth the Second, Queen of Ghana and of Her other Realms and Territories, Head of the Commonwealth&quot;. Each new realm thereafter did the same. In 1973 Australia removed reference to the United Kingdom, followed by New Zealand the next year. By the time of Elizabeth&#x27;s death in 2022, aside from the United Kingdom itself, only Canada retained mention of the United Kingdom in the monarch&#x27;s title and only Canada and New Zealand retained a reference to the monarch as Defender of the Faith. The Canadian parliament, in 2023, passed legislation that removed those references. The bill received royal assent on 22 June 2023; a proclamation of the new title was issued on January 8, 2024.

==Flags==


Queen Elizabeth II employed various royal standards to mark her presence, the particular one used depending on which realm she was in or acting on behalf of at the time. All are heraldic banners incorporating the arms for that state and, save for those of the UK, were defaced in the centre with the device from the Queen&#x27;s Personal Flag. The Queen would use that personal flag in realms where she did not have a royal standard. Many other members of the royal family have their own personal standards; the Prince of Wales, Princess Royal, Duke of York and Duke of Edinburgh also have one each for Canada. Those without their own standard use a specific ermine-bordered banner of either the British, Scottish, or, when in or acting on behalf of Canada, Canadian royal arms.

The governors-general throughout the Commonwealth realms also each use a personal flag, which, like that of the sovereign, passes to each successive occupant of the office. Most feature a lion passant atop a St. Edward&#x27;s royal crown with the name of the country across a scroll underneath, all on a blue background. The two exceptions are those of, since 1981, Canada (bearing on a blue background the crest of the Royal Coat of Arms of Canada) and, since 2008, New Zealand (a St. Edward&#x27;s Crown above the shield of the Coat of arms of New Zealand). The lieutenant governors of the Canadian provinces each have their own personal standards, as do the governors of the Australian states.

==History==
===Dominions emerge===
The possibility that a colony within the British Empire might become a new kingdom was first mooted in the 1860s, when it was proposed that the British North American territories of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and the Province of Canada unite as a confederation that might be known as the &quot;Kingdom of Canada&quot;.
Although the dominions were capable of governing themselves internally, they remained formally—and substantively in regard to foreign policy and defence—subject to British authority, wherein the governor-general of each dominion represented the British monarch-in-Council reigning over these territories as a single imperial domain. It was held in some circles that the Crown was a monolithic element throughout all the monarch&#x27;s territories; A.H. Lefroy wrote in 1918 that &quot;the Crown is to be considered as one and indivisible throughout the Empire; and cannot be severed into as many kingships as there are dominions, and self-governing colonies&quot;. 

This unitary model began to erode when the dominions gained more international prominence as a result of their participation and sacrifice in the First World War. In 1919, Canadian prime minister Sir Robert Borden and South African minister of defence Jan Smuts demanded that, at the Versailles Conference, the dominions be given full recognition as &quot;autonomous nations of an Imperial Commonwealth&quot;. As a result, although the King signed as High Contracting Party for the Empire as a whole, the dominions were also separate signatories to the Treaty of Versailles. They also became, together with India, founding members of the League of Nations. In 1921 the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, David Lloyd George, stated that the &quot;British dominions have now been accepted fully into the community of nations&quot;.

===Balfour Declaration of 1926===

The pace of independence increased in the 1920s, led by Canada, which exchanged envoys with the United States in 1920 and concluded the Halibut Treaty in its own right in 1923. In the Chanak crisis of 1922, the Canadian government insisted that its course of action would be determined by the Canadian parliament, not the British government, and, by 1925, the dominions felt confident enough to refuse to be bound by Britain&#x27;s adherence to the Treaty of Locarno. The Viscount Haldane said in 1919 that in Australia the Crown &quot;acts in self-governing States on the initiative and advice of its own ministers in these States&quot;.
Another catalyst for change came in 1926, when Field Marshal the Lord Byng of Vimy, then Governor General of Canada, refused the advice of his prime minister (William Lyon Mackenzie King) in what came to be known colloquially as the King–Byng Affair. Mackenzie King, after resigning and then being reappointed as prime minister some months later, pushed at the Imperial Conference of 1926 for a reorganisation of the way the dominions related to the British government, resulting in the Balfour Declaration, which declared formally that the dominions were fully autonomous and equal in status to the United Kingdom. What this meant in practice was not at the time worked out; conflicting views existed, some in the United Kingdom not wishing to see a fracturing of the sacred unity of the Crown throughout the empire, and some in the dominions not wishing to see their jurisdiction have to take on the full brunt of diplomatic and military responsibilities.

What did follow was that the dominion governments gained an equal status with the United Kingdom, a separate and direct relationship with the monarch, without the British Cabinet acting as an intermediary, and the governors-general now acted solely as a personal representative of the sovereign in right of that dominion. Though no formal mechanism for tendering advice to the monarch had yet been established—former Prime Minister of Australia Billy Hughes theorised that the dominion cabinets would provide informal direction and the British Cabinet would offer formal advice—the concepts were first put into legal practice with the passage in 1927 of the &quot;Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act&quot;, which implicitly recognised the Irish Free State as separate from the UK, and the King as king &quot;of&quot; each dominion uniquely, rather than as the British king &quot;in&quot; each dominion. At the same time, terminology in foreign relations was altered to demonstrate the independent status of the dominions, such as the dropping of the term &quot;Britannic&quot; from the King&#x27;s style outside of the United Kingdom. Then, in 1930 George V&#x27;s Australian ministers employed a practice adopted by resolution at that year&#x27;s Imperial Conference, directly advising the King to appoint Sir Isaac Isaacs as the Australian governor-general. Calls were also made for the empire to adopt new symbols less centred on the United Kingdom specifically, such as a new British Empire flag that would recognize the elevated status of the dominions. Many unofficial designs were often displayed for patriotic celebrations such as coronations and Empire Day.

===Statute of Westminster 1931===
These new developments were explicitly codified in 1931 with the passage of the &quot;Statute of Westminster&quot;, through which Canada, the Union of South Africa, and the Irish Free State all immediately obtained formal legislative independence from the UK, while in the other dominions adoption of the statute was subject to ratification by the dominion&#x27;s parliament. Australia and New Zealand did so in 1942 and 1947, respectively, with the former&#x27;s ratification back-dated to 1939, while Newfoundland never ratified the bill and reverted to direct British rule in 1934. As a result, the parliament at Westminster was unable to legislate for any dominion unless requested to do so, although the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council was left available as the last court of appeal for some dominions. Specific attention was given in the statute&#x27;s preamble to royal succession, outlining that no changes to that line could be made by the parliament of the United Kingdom or that of any dominion without the assent of all the other parliaments of the UK and dominions, an arrangement a justice of the Ontario Superior Court in 2003 likened to &quot;a treaty among the Commonwealth countries to share the monarchy under the existing rules and not to change the rules without the agreement of all signatories&quot;.
This was all met with only minor trepidation, either before or at the time, and the government of the Irish Free State was confident that the relationship of these independent countries under the Crown would function as a personal union, akin to that which had earlier existed between the United Kingdom and Hanover (1801 to 1837), or between England and Scotland (1603 to 1707). Its first test came, though, with the abdication of King Edward VIII in 1936, for which it was necessary to gain the consent of the governments of all the dominions and the request and consent of the Canadian government, as well as separate legislation in South Africa and the Irish Free State, before the resignation could take place across the Commonwealth. At the height of the crisis, press in South Africa fretted about the Crown being the only thing holding the empire together and the bond would be weakened if Edward VIII continued &quot;weakening kingship&quot;. Afterward, Francis Floud, Britain&#x27;s high commissioner to Canada, opined that the whole affair had strengthened the connections between the various nations; though, he felt the Crown could not suffer another shock. As the various legislative steps taken by the dominions resulted in Edward abdicating on different dates in different countries, this demonstrated the division of the Crown post-Statute of Westminster.

The civil division of the Court of Appeal of England and Wales later found in 1982 that the British parliament could have legislated for a dominion simply by including in any new law a clause claiming the dominion cabinet had requested and approved of the act, whether that was true or not. Further, the British parliament was not obliged to fulfil a dominion&#x27;s request for legislative change. Regardless, in 1935 the British parliament refused to consider the result of the 1933 Western Australian secession referendum without the approval of the Australian federal government or parliament. In 1937, the Appeal Division of the Supreme Court of South Africa ruled unanimously that a repeal of the &quot;Statute of Westminster&quot; in the United Kingdom would have no effect in South Africa, stating: &quot;We cannot take this argument seriously. Freedom once conferred cannot be revoked.&quot; Others in Canada upheld the same position.

===Dominions gain sovereignty===
At the 1932 British Empire Economic Conference, delegates from the United Kingdom, led by Stanley Baldwin (then Lord President of the Council), hoped to establish a system of free trade within the British Commonwealth, to promote unity within the British Empire and to assure Britain&#x27;s position as a world power. The idea was controversial, as it pitted proponents of imperial trade with those who sought a general policy of trade liberalisation with all nations. The dominions, particularly Canada, were also adamantly against dispensing with their import tariffs, which &quot;dispelled any romantic notions of a &#x27;United Empire&#x27;.&quot; The meeting did produce a five-year trade agreement based upon a policy, first conceived in the 1900s, of Imperial Preference: the countries retained their import tariffs, but lowered these for other Commonwealth countries.

During his tenure as Governor General of Canada, Lord Tweedsmuir urged the organisation of a royal tour of the country by King George VI, so that he might not only appear in person before his people, but also personally perform constitutional duties and pay a state visit to the United States as king of Canada. While the idea was embraced in Canada as a way to &quot;translate the Statute of Westminster into the actualities of a tour&quot;, throughout the planning of the trip that took place in 1939, the British authorities resisted at numerous points the idea that the King be attended by his Canadian ministers instead of his British ones. The Canadian prime minister (still Mackenzie King) was ultimately the minister in attendance, and the King did in public throughout the trip ultimately act solely in his capacity as the Canadian monarch. The status of the Crown was bolstered by Canada&#x27;s reception of George VI.
When the Second World War began, there was some uncertainty in the dominions about the ramifications of Britain&#x27;s declaration of war against Nazi Germany. Australia and New Zealand had not yet adopted the Statute of Westminster; the Australian prime minister, Robert Menzies, considered the government bound by the British declaration of war, while New Zealand coordinated a declaration of war to be made simultaneously with Britain&#x27;s. As late as 1937, some scholars were still of the mind that, when it came to declarations of war, if the King signed, he did so as king of the empire as a whole; at that time, William Paul McClure Kennedy wrote: &quot;in the final test of sovereignty—that of war—Canada is not a sovereign state... and it remains as true in 1937 as it was in 1914 that when the Crown is at war, Canada is legally at war,&quot; and, one year later, Arthur Berriedale Keith argued that &quot;issues of war or neutrality still are decided on the final authority of the British Cabinet.&quot; In 1939, Canada and South Africa made separate proclamations of war against Germany a few days after the UK&#x27;s. Their example was followed more consistently by the other realms as further war was declared against Italy, Romania, Hungary, Finland and Japan. Ireland remained neutral, &quot;shattering the illusion of imperial unity.&quot; At the war&#x27;s end, it was said by F.R. Scott that &quot;it is firmly established as a basic constitutional principle that, so far as relates to Canada, the King is regulated by Canadian law and must act only on the advice and responsibility of Canadian ministers.&quot;
The war had strained the alliance among the Commonwealth countries, which had been noted by the King. The Prime Minister of Australia, John Curtin, had stated in December 1941 &quot;that Australia looks to America, free of any pangs about our traditional links of kinship with Britain.&quot; The Parliament of South Africa voted on 14 January 1942 on a motion proposing the country become a republic and leave the Commonwealth. British Prime Minister Winston Churchill was told &quot;His Majesty is genuinely alarmed at the feeling, which appears to be growing in Australia and may well be aggravated by further reverses in the Far East. He very much hopes, therefore, that it may be possible to adopt as soon as possible some procedure which will succeed in arresting these dangerous developments without impairing the efficiency of the existing machinery.&quot;

===Post-war evolution===
Within three years following the end of the Second World War, India, Pakistan and Ceylon became independent dominions within the Commonwealth. India would soon move to a republican form of government. Unlike in Ireland and Burma, there was no desire on the part of India to leave the Commonwealth, prompting a Commonwealth Conference and the London Declaration in April 1949, which entrenched the idea that republics be allowed in the Commonwealth so long as they recognised King George VI as Head of the Commonwealth and the &quot;symbol of the free association of its independent member nations&quot;. Pakistan became a republic in 1956.

As these constitutional developments were taking place, the dominion and British governments became increasingly concerned with how to represent the more commonly accepted notion that there was no distinction between the sovereign&#x27;s role in the United Kingdom and his or her position in any of the dominions. Thus, at the 1948 Prime Ministers&#x27; Conference the term &quot;dominion&quot; was avoided in favour of &quot;Commonwealth country&quot;, to avoid the subordination implied by the older designation.

===Second Elizabethan era===

The Commonwealth&#x27;s prime ministers discussed the matter of the new monarch&#x27;s title, with St. Laurent stating at the 1953 Commonwealth Prime Ministers&#x27; Conference that it was important to agree on a format that would &quot;emphasise the fact that the Queen is Queen of Canada, regardless of her sovereignty over other Commonwealth countries.&quot; The result was a new &quot;Royal Style and Titles Act&quot; being passed in each of the seven realms then existing (excluding Pakistan), which all identically gave formal recognition to the separateness and equality of the countries involved, and replaced the phrase &quot;British Dominions Beyond the Seas&quot; with &quot;Her Other Realms and Territories&quot;, the latter using the word &quot;realm&quot; in place of &quot;dominion&quot;. Further, at her coronation, Elizabeth II&#x27;s oath contained a provision requiring her to promise to govern according to the rules and customs of the realms, naming each one separately.

The change in perspective was summed up by Patrick Gordon Walker&#x27;s statement in the British House of Commons: &quot;We in this country have to abandon... any sense of property in the Crown. The Queen, now, clearly, explicitly and according to title, belongs equally to all her realms and to the Commonwealth as a whole.&quot; In the same period, Walker also suggested to the British parliament that the Queen should annually spend an equal amount of time in each of her realms. Lord Altrincham, who in 1957 criticised Queen Elizabeth II for having a court that encompassed mostly Britain and not the Commonwealth as a whole, was in favour of the idea, but it did not attract wide support. Another thought raised was that viceregal appointments should become trans-Commonwealth; the governor-general of Australia would be someone from South Africa, the governor-general of Ceylon would come from New Zealand, and so on. The prime ministers of Canada and Australia, John Diefenbaker and Robert Menzies, respectively, were sympathetic to the concept, but, again, it was never put into practice.

On 6 July 2010, Elizabeth II addressed the United Nations in New York City as queen of 16 Commonwealth realms. The following year, Portia Simpson-Miller, the Prime Minister of Jamaica, spoke of a desire to make that country a republic, while Alex Salmond, the First Minister of Scotland and leader of the Scottish National Party (which favours Scottish independence), stated an independent Scotland &quot;would still share a monarchy with ... the UK, just as ... 16 other Commonwealth countries do now.&quot; Dennis Canavan, leader of Yes Scotland, disagreed and said a separate, post-independence referendum should be held on the matter.

Following the Perth Agreement of 2011, the Commonwealth realms, in accordance with convention, together engaged in a process of amending the common line of succession according to each country&#x27;s constitution, to ensure the order would continue to be identical in every realm. In legislative debates in the United Kingdom, the term &quot;Commonwealth realm&quot; was employed, but, it remained unused in any law.

==Transitions==

In addition to the states listed above, the Dominion of Newfoundland was a dominion when the &quot;Statute of Westminster 1931&quot; was given royal assent but effectively lost that status in 1934, without ever having assented to the &quot;Statute of Westminster&quot;, and before the term Commonwealth realm ever came into use. Due to a domestic financial and political crisis, the Newfoundland legislature petitioned the UK to suspend dominion status, the UK parliament passed the &quot;Newfoundland Act 1933&quot;, and direct rule was implemented in 1934. Rather than reclaiming dominion status after the Second World War, it became a province of Canada in 1949.

===Republican referendums===
Six Commonwealth realms and dominions held referendums to consider whether they should become republics. As of January 2020, of the eight held, three were successful: in Ghana, in South Africa and the second referendum in Gambia. Referendums that rejected the proposal were held in Australia, twice in Tuvalu, and in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. Interest in holding a second referendum was expressed in Australia in 2010.

During the 2020 Jamaican general election, the People&#x27;s National Party promised to hold a referendum on becoming a republic within 18 months if it won the election and polls suggested that 55 per cent of Jamaicans desired the country become a republic. The ruling Jamaica Labour Party, which had in 2016 promised a referendum it did not deliver, was reelected.

Barbados, which had been a Commonwealth realm for 55 years since it gained independence in 1966, became a republic by vote of Parliament in October 2021, effective on 30 November 2021. Some Barbadians criticised the government&#x27;s decision not to hold a referendum on the issue as being undemocratic.

In 2022, following the death of Elizabeth II and the accession of Charles III, the governments of Jamaica, The Bahamas, and Antigua and Barbuda announced their intentions to hold referendums.

<text>Ang Rita Sherpa (; 27 July 194821 September 2020) was a Nepalese mountaineer who climbed Mount Everest ten times without supplemental oxygen between 1983 and 1996. His sixth climb set the world record for the most successful ascents of Mount Everest, which he re-set on his tenth climb. Although others have since summitted Everest more, he still holds the record for most summits without supplemental oxygen. He was also the first, and to date only, person to climb Mount Everest without supplemental oxygen in winter. He was nicknamed the &quot;Snow Leopard&quot; by his peers.

== Early life ==
Sherpa was born in 1948 in Thame, Solukhumbu. His family reared yaks. He spent his childhood looking after the yaks and as a porter on trading expeditions across the Himalayas to Tibet. He joined mountaineering as a porter at the age of 15. He did not receive any formal education or mountaineering training.

==Career==
Sherpa&#x27;s first successful climb was Cho Oyu at the age of 20. He went on to climb dozens of mountains including Mount Everest, K2, Cho Oyu, Lhotse, Manaslu, Annapurna and Dhaulagiri, multiple times without supplementary oxygen. He is thought to have successfully summitted eight-thousanders a total of 18 times, almost all of them without oxygen.

Sherpa first climbed Mount Everest in 1983. In just over 13 years, he reached the summit of Everest nine more times without bottled oxygen. Eight of his ten summits were via the Southeast ridge route. His last summit was 12 days after the 1996 Everest disaster. He was distraught by the loss of his friends in the disaster. He fell ill that year. According to his family, King Birendra had sent Crown Prince Dipendra to relay his request that Sherpa retire from mountaineering, in view of his deteriorating health. He stopped mountaineering following the visit by the Crown Prince.

Sherpa was the first person to reach the summit of Everest in winter without supplementary oxygen, a feat he achieved in 1987. He was also the first person to climb Everest 10 times. He was recognised by the Guinness World Records in 2017 as the only person in the world to have climbed Mount Everest 10 times without bottled oxygen, a record he still holds in 2020.

Sherpa was considered by his peers to be the strongest and most skilled Sherpa guide of his time. According to Sherpa, he once signed up as a low-altitude porter in an expedition to Dhaulagiri but was made to carry equipment to Dhaulagiri-III camp, a task he successfully completed without shoes and any climbing gear. In April 1985, he successfully took the leader of the Norwegian team that he was guiding, to the summit of Mount Everest despite a blizzard. During his record-setting ascent of Everest in the winter of 1987, he assisted a South Korean team. According to Sherpa, after he and another climber got separated from the team one night, the two performed aerobic exercises all night to keep warm and alive. In 1990, he assisted a team from the Nepali Army in their Everest expedition. From the team that started its preparation with almost 50 members, only four reached the summit along with Sherpa, only one of them a soldier of the Nepali Army.

== Illness and death ==
Sherpa retired from mountaineering in 1996 after he fell ill due to a liver ailment that lasted the rest of his life. He also had a stroke around 2015–16. 
Sherpa died suddenly at his daughter&#x27;s residence in Kathmandu, at around 10 A.M. on 21 September 2020, at age 72. Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli expressed his condolences on Twitter—&quot;His accomplishments will be forever remembered.&quot;

Sherpa&#x27;s body was kept in a gompa in Kathmandu before the funeral on 23 September. His funeral was held with national honours at Teku Dobhan, the holy confluence of Bagmati and Bishnumati rivers in Kathmandu, according to Buddhist customs. The minister of tourism and culture, Yogesh Bhattarai, draped his body with the national flag, and a squad from the Nepal Armed Police Force presented a gun salute.

==Personal life==
Sherpa had three sons and a daughter. His eldest son, Karsang, was also a mountaineer, and had summitted Everest nine times; he died during an expedition in 2012. His second son, Chhewang, has also summitted Everest five times. Ang Rita&#x27;s wife died a year after the death of their eldest son. Ang Rita lived the last years of his life at his daughter&#x27;s residence in Jorpati, Kathmandu.

==Awards and honours==
Sherpa was a recipient of the Order of Gorkha Dakshina Bahu and the Order of Tri Shakti Patta.

<text>James W. Whittaker (born February 10, 1929), also known as Jim Whittaker, is an American climber and mountain guide. Born and raised in Seattle, Washington, on May 1, 1963, he became the first American to reach the summit of Mount Everest as a member of the American Mount Everest Expedition led by Norman Dyhrenfurth, alongside the Sherpa Nawang Gombu, a nephew of Tenzing Norgay. They ran out of oxygen, but managed to reach the summit.

==Biography==
He is the twin brother of Lou Whittaker, a mountain guide who is often mistakenly credited with achieving the 1963 ascent of Everest. The twins started climbing in their teens in the 1940s while in the Boy Scouts.

Whittaker graduated from West Seattle High School and Seattle University.

On July 25, 1955, Whittaker became the first full-time employee of Recreational Equipment, Inc. (REI) and was the company&#x27;s CEO in the 1960s as well as an early board member with American Alpine Club president Nicholas Clinch. When Whittaker climbed Mount Everest, it provided REI with so much free advertising that the following year, 1964, its gross income topped US$1 million for the first time.

In 1965, with Dee Molenaar and others, he guided Robert F. Kennedy up the newly named Mount Kennedy. Kennedy and Whittaker became fast friends and spent multiple vacations together. In 1968, he became Kennedy’s state campaign chairman. When Kennedy was shot in Los Angeles, Whittaker immediately flew over to comfort RFK&#x27;s wife when her brother in law had to shut off life-support.

In 1990, he led the Earth Day 20 International Peace Climb that brought together climbers from the United States, USSR, and China to summit Mount Everest. In addition to putting twenty climbers on the summit, the expedition hauled off a large amount of trash left on the mountain by previous expeditions.

Currently, Whittaker is chairman of the Board of Magellan Navigation, a company that produces handheld Global Positioning System (GPS) units.

In 1999 Whittaker released his autobiography, &quot;A Life on the Edge: Memoirs of Everest and Beyond&quot;. His younger son, Leif Whittaker, published &quot;My Old Man and the Mountain: A Memoir&quot; in 2016, which relates the story of his own summit of Mount Everest, with his parents accompanying him on part of the journey, and with comparisons to his father&#x27;s Mount Everest experiences.

Whittaker and his wife, Dianne Roberts, live in Port Townsend, Washington. Their children are Joss and Leif Whittaker.

== Awards and honors ==
* For being the first American to scale Mount Everest, Whittaker was awarded the Hubbard Medal by United States President John F. Kennedy.
* Big Jim Mountain in Chelan County, Washington is named for him.
* Jim Whittaker Wilderness Peak Trail in Cougar Mountain Regional Wildland Park near Issaquah, Washington is named for him.

<doc id="205147" wikidata="Q217304" url="?curid=205147" title="24 Sussex Drive">
<text>24 Sussex Drive, originally called Gorffwysfa and usually referred to simply as 24 Sussex, is the official residence of the prime minister of Canada, in the New Edinburgh neighbourhood of Ottawa, Ontario. Built between 1866 and 1868 by Joseph Merrill Currier, it has been the official home of the prime minister since 1951. It is one of two official residences made available to the prime minister, the Harrington Lake estate in nearby Gatineau Park being the other. 24 Sussex has not been an actual residence since 2015.

==History==
The house at 24 Sussex Drive was originally commissioned in 1866 by lumberman and Member of Parliament Joseph Merrill Currier as a wedding gift for his wife-to-be Hannah Wright. It was completed in 1868 and Currier named it . It was sold for $30,000 in 1901, after Hannah Currier&#x27;s death, to William Edwards.

===Ownership by federal government===
In 1943, the Government of Canada used its power of expropriation to divest Gordon Edwards, nephew of William Edwards, of his title to the house, to consolidate Crown ownership of the lands along the Ottawa River. Edwards had fought the action, but eventually lost the dispute with the Canadian government in 1946 and died at the house later that year.

After several years of uncertainty, the government decided in 1950 to refurbish the property as a residence for the prime minister, the renovations costing just over $500,000. Previous prime ministers lived at a variety of locations around Ottawa: Wilfrid Laurier and William Lyon Mackenzie King, for instance, lived at Laurier House in Sandy Hill. Laurier House was willed to the Crown upon Mackenzie King&#x27;s death in 1950 and was thus also available for designation as the prime minister&#x27;s official residence at the time.

Louis St. Laurent was the first to take up residence at 24 Sussex Drive in 1951. Since then, every prime minister has resided at 24 Sussex for the duration of their times in office, with two exceptions. Kim Campbell resided at Harrington Lake during her brief term, as her predecessor Brian Mulroney remained at 24 Sussex temporarily (despite having resigned as prime minister, as per agreement with Campbell) pending renovations of his Montreal home; Campbell&#x27;s government was defeated in the 1993 Canadian federal election on 25 October 1993 (had Campbell won that election then she would have moved into 24 Sussex). Although it was his childhood home when his father was Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau has opted to reside at Rideau Cottage, pending a review of work needed to repair 24 Sussex which was in poor condition.

==Use==

Unlike 10 Downing Street or the White House, 24 Sussex Drive has been used almost exclusively as a place of residence (and therefore its address has never been widely used as a metonym for the Office of the Prime Minister). The prime minister&#x27;s work is carried out by the Office of the Prime Minister in the Office of the Prime Minister and Privy Council building, near Parliament Hill. However, prime ministers have conducted some work at 24 Sussex Drive over the years, and informal meetings between prime ministers and other government or foreign officials have taken place in the house (foreign heads of state on state visits are officially hosted by the monarch or governor general at Rideau Hall).

Security at 24 Sussex was overhauled following an attempted assassination on November 5, 1995, by André Dallaire, who wandered around the house and grounds for nearly an hour before being confronted outside Jean Chrétien&#x27;s bedroom by the Prime Minister&#x27;s wife, Aline; she locked the door to the bedroom while Jean guarded it with an Inuit stone carving. Ultimately, Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers arrested Dallaire. Measures put in place after the incident included the addition of several more guards and security cameras to the house&#x27;s attaché, and the installation of crash-proof barriers within the main gates.

Despite the building not having any bureaucratic function, it has been the location of protests, such as when farmers drove their tractors in a convoy past the front of the property in 2006 and when Greenpeace activists chained themselves to the front gates in March 2007.

Stephen Harper is the most recent prime minister to have resided at 24 Sussex Drive, leaving in 2015. 24 Sussex has remained unoccupied, but staff use its kitchen to prepare meals which are then delivered to Trudeau&#x27;s family at Rideau Cottage.

==Architecture==
The residence at 24 Sussex Drive is a large, limestone-clad structure set on on the south bank of the Ottawa River, overlooking Governor Bay, next to the French embassy and opposite the main entrance to Rideau Hall. The house consists of 35 rooms spread on four floors, including the basement, connected by an elevator and many staircases. The basement consists of support rooms, while the main floor holds the dining room, living room, kitchen (which is staffed by a head chef and support staff), main stair hall, prime minister&#x27;s library, and a sun room. The second floor is primarily bedrooms, including the master bedroom, as well as a family room (described by Margaret Trudeau as her &quot;freedom room&quot;) and the office of prime minister&#x27;s spouse. The third floor contains additional bedrooms and a private study for the prime minister.

The exterior of the house is a mid-century modern take on Norman Revival architecture. When originally built, it was very much of the Victorian (Queen Anne) style; it had high gables, extensive verandahs, and a liberal use of gingerbread trim. A turret was added by the Edwards family in 1907. After it was decided in 1950 the house would become the official residence of the prime minister, the turret, widow&#x27;s walk, trim, main gable at the front, verandahs, and porte-cochère were removed and an extension added to the east. The interior was gutted, save for part of the dining room.

The National Capital Commission (NCC) maintains the house, its property, and a selection of historic furnishings from the Crown Collection for use in the public rooms of the mansion, ranging from musical instruments to chairs, tables, and paintings by famous Canadians. However, due to the lack of restraints on the prime minister of the day to do what he or she pleases with the home, several have left their own marks on the building. For example, the rear patio was enclosed and winterized while Lester B. Pearson was prime minister and inside, Pearson&#x27;s wife, Maryon, created in the basement the &quot;Canadiana Room&quot;, where she collected Canadian antiques and craft-work. While Joe Clark and his family were resident at 24 Sussex, the interiors were redecorated, the dining room ceiling receiving gold leaf re-purposed from another project. Unnamed business associates of Pierre Trudeau installed a swimming pool for his frequent workouts. The pool, designed by government architect Stig Harvor, reportedly cost $275,000 due to an underground access increasing the expense. This was raised in a &quot;public fund&quot; headed by Keith Davey, the donors to which were never made public. Brian Mulroney was the first prime minister to have the costs of renovations publicly revealed. The high tab for his and his wife&#x27;s alterations to the building caused political controversy, especially as some of the costs were paid for from the PC Canada Fund, which raised money from individual donations to fund the Progressive Conservative Party.

Since the renovation of the house in 2001, very little has been spent on upkeep of 24 Sussex Drive, leaving parts of it worn and outdated, including the heating and cooling systems, wiring, and roofing. On May 6, 2008, the Auditor General reported that the house was in poor condition and needed about $10 million in repairs and upgrades, which would require at least 12 to 15 months of &quot;full access&quot; to complete. In October 2015, Bryan Baeumler estimated $15 million might be necessary to properly renovate the residence. The NCC devised a plan for major renovations, asserting such a project would require approximately 18 months. In 2021 the NCC released a new cost estimate of $36.6 million to bring the house to a state of good repair. However, the estimate includes a expansion of the main building to improve universal accessibility, functionality, and livability.

As of 2023, the building was infested with rodents, and &quot;the walls, attic and basement are filled with carcasses and excrement&quot;. In May 2023, work began to strip the property of asbestos and to remove &quot;obsolete mechanical, heating, and electrical systems&quot; which were the reasons that the building was deemed a fire hazard. The NCC estimated that the work would take one year to complete.

===Proposed replacement===
The idea of removing part of the structure and replacing it with a modern section has been floated. There have been occasional calls to demolish the entire structure and rebuild, which would cost less than a renovation. Maureen McTeer, wife of former Prime Minister Joe Clark, said the building is &quot;completely lacking&quot; in architectural value and is not worth saving. The designation as a federal heritage building, though not legally binding, would probably protect it against such a measure. Heritage advocates have suggested retaining 24 Sussex Drive for public use due to its long history, noting that other countries have continually spent money to maintain their official residences in good condition for their respective head of governments, even if a new site for an official prime ministerial residence is selected.

The RCMP is concerned that the 24 Sussex address is too close to a busy road and lacks a buffer zone, so it has even been suggested that the prime minister&#x27;s residence be moved to a new site that would have sufficient space for official functions, security, and staff.

<text>Fidel Sánchez Hernández (7 July 1917 – 28 February 2003) was a Salvadoran military officer and politician who served as president of El Salvador from 1967 to 1972. During his rule, Sánchez Hernández faced war and economic turmoil.

== Military career ==
Before becoming president, Sánchez Hernández was an army general in El Salvador and had brief stints as a military attaché in Washington D.C. (after his participation in the overthrow of José María Lemus in 1960) and in Paris. President Julio Adalberto Rivera promoted him to Minister of the Interior in 1962, and he served in that office until 1967, when he succeeded Rivera to the position of president.

== Presidency ==
He continued Rivera&#x27;s progressive programs and created a mostly civilian cabinet. The 1967 election was considered one of the few in the period of military domination to have been fairly conducted; the gains made by the opposition (winning a majority of the popular vote) in the legislative and local elections the following year suggested El Salvador was on the road to democratization, a trend that would not be continued as elections in the 1970s were blatantly rigged.

In July 1969, Sánchez Hernández led the Salvadoran Army in its brief but violent Football War against Honduras. He had much success, occupying a large part of that country. But, under a cease-fire agreement arranged by the Organization of American States, Sánchez Hernández agreed to pull his troops out, much to the opposition of many of his military leaders.

The war with Honduras led to much economic distress in El Salvador. Refugees, mostly Salvadorans that resided in Honduras, poured into the country and Honduras closed off trade routes.

Sánchez Hernández remained president until 1972 and was succeeded by Colonel Arturo Armando Molina.

== Death ==
On the night of 28 February 2003, Sánchez Hernández, aged 85, died of a heart attack while being taken to a military hospital in El Salvador.

== Orders and decorations ==

The following is a list of orders and decorations awarded to Sánchez Hernández:
* Order of Merit of Duarte, Sánchez and Mella (13 November 1970)

* Order of the Quetzal (3 September 1968)

* Collar of the Order of the Aztec Eagle (16 January 1958)

* Grand Cross of the Order of Isabella the Catholic

* Grand Order of Mugunghwa (22 September 1970)
* Grand National Order (4 March 1969)

* Grand Cordon of the Order of the Cloud and Banner (14 February 1968)

* Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany (11 August 1971)

<text>Ferenc Puskás (, ; né Purczeld; 1 April 1927 – 17 November 2006) was a Hungarian footballer and manager, widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time and the sport&#x27;s first international superstar. A forward and an attacking midfielder, he scored 84 goals in 85 international matches for Hungary and later played four international matches for Spain as well. He became an Olympic champion in 1952 and led his nation to the final of the 1954 World Cup. He won three European Cups (1959, 1960, 1966), ten national championships (five Hungarian and five Spanish Primera División) and eight top individual scoring honors. Known as the &quot;Galloping Major&quot;, in 1995, he was recognized as the greatest top division scorer of the 20th century by the IFFHS. Scoring 802 goals in 792 official games during his career, he is the seventh top goal scorer of all time by the RSSSF.

He was the son of former footballer Ferenc Puskás Senior. Puskás started his career in Hungary playing for Kispest and Budapest Honvéd. He was the top scorer in the Hungarian League on four occasions and in 1948 he was the top goal scorer in Europe. During the 1950s, he was both a prominent member and captain of the Hungary national team, known as the &quot;Mighty Magyars&quot;. After the Hungarian Revolution, Puskás served a two year ban from UEFA. Despite failing to sign for Ethnikos Piraeus in 1957 under pressure from rival clubs, in 1958, he emigrated to Spain where he successfully signed for Real Madrid at the age of 31. While playing with the club, Puskás won four &quot;Pichichis&quot; and scored seven goals in two European Cup finals, winning the competition three times with the club and claiming five consecutive La Liga titles. He scored 619 goals in 618 matches in the Hungarian and Spanish leagues and National Cups.

After retiring as a player, he became a coach. The highlight of his coaching career came in 1971 when he guided Panathinaikos to the European Cup final, where they lost 2–0 to Ajax. He also led the club to the championship in 1972, becoming an icon in the country. Afterward he&#x27;d have spells at various countries and clubs, including Spain, Paraguay and the Saudi Arabia national team, with varying success. He returned again to Greece to manage an exceptionally strong AEK team for the 1978–79 season. In 1993, he returned to Hungary and took temporary charge of the Hungary national team. In 1998, he became one of the first ever FIFA/SOS Charity ambassadors. In 2002, the &quot;Népstadion&quot; in Budapest was renamed the Puskás Ferenc Stadion in his honor. He was also declared the best Hungarian player of the last 50 years by the Hungarian Football Federation in the UEFA Jubilee Awards in November 2003. In October 2009, FIFA announced the introduction of the FIFA Puskás Award, awarded to the player who has scored the &quot;most beautiful goal&quot; over the past year. He was also listed in Pelé&#x27;s FIFA 100.

==Career in Hungary==
===Early years===

Ferenc Purczeld was born on 1 April 1927 to a German (Danube Swabian) family in Budapest and brought up in Kispest, then a suburb, today part of the city. His mother, Margit Biró (1904–1976), was a seamstress. He began his career as a junior with Kispest Honvéd, where his father, who had previously played for the club, was a coach.

In 1937, his father changed the family name to Puskás. He initially used the pseudonym &quot;Miklós Kovács&quot; to help circumvent the minimum age rules before officially signing at the age of 12. Among his early teammates was his childhood friend and future international teammate József Bozsik. He made his first senior appearance for Kispest in November 1943 in a match against NAC. It was here where he received the nickname &quot;Öcsi&quot; or &quot;Buddy&quot;.

On 19 February 1949, Puskás scored seven goals for Kispest in a 11–3 win against Győr. Kispest was taken over by the Hungarian Ministry of Defence in 1949, becoming the Hungarian Army team and changing its name to Budapest Honvéd. As a result, football players were given military ranks. Puskás eventually became a major (Hungarian: &quot;Őrnagy&quot;), which led to the nickname &quot;The Galloping Major&quot;. As the army club, Honvéd used conscription to acquire the best Hungarian players leading to the recruitment of Zoltán Czibor and Sándor Kocsis. During his career at Budapest Honvéd, Puskás helped the club win five Hungarian League titles. He also finished as top goal scorer in the league in 1947–48, 1949–50, 1950 and 1953, scoring 50, 31, 25 and 27 goals, respectively. In 1948, he was the top goal scorer in Europe.

===Goldteam===
Puskás made his debut for Hungary team on 20 August 1945 and scored in a 5–2 win over Austria. He went on to play 85 games and scored 84 times for Hungary. His international goal record included two hat tricks against Austria, one against Luxembourg and four goals in a 12–0 win over Albania. Together with Zoltán Czibor, Sándor Kocsis, József Bozsik, and Nándor Hidegkuti, he formed the nucleus of the Golden Team that was to remain unbeaten for 32 consecutive games. During this run, they became Olympic Champions in 1952, beating Yugoslavia 2–0 in the final in Helsinki. Puskás scored four times at the Olympic tournament, including the opening goal in the final. They also defeated England twice, first with a 6–3 win at Wembley Stadium, and then 7–1 in Budapest. Puskás scored two goals in each game against England. In 1953, they also won the 1948-53 Central European International Cup. Hungary won the championship after finishing top of the table with 11 points. Puskás finished the tournament as top scorer with ten goals and scored twice as Hungary claimed the trophy with a 3–0 win over Italy at the Stadio Olimpico in 1953.

Puskás scored three goals in the two first-round matches Hungary played at the 1954 FIFA World Cup. They defeated South Korea 9–0 and then West Germany 8–3. In the latter game, he suffered a hairline fracture of the ankle after a tackle by Werner Liebrich, and did not return until the final.

Puskás played the entire 1954 World Cup final against West Germany with a hairline fracture. Despite this, he scored his fourth goal of the tournament to put Hungary ahead after six minutes, and with Czibor adding another goal two minutes later, it seemed that the pre-tournament favorites would take the title. However, the West Germans pulled back two goals before half time, with six minutes left the West Germans scored the winner. Two minutes from the end of the match Puskás scored a late equalizer but the goal was disallowed due to an offside call. Ending the Golden years with a silver medal at the 1955-60 Central European International Cup, making it a grand total of two gold/titles and two silver for the Mighty Magyars.

===Honvéd World Tour===

Budapest Honvéd entered the European Cup in 1956 and were drawn against Athletic Bilbao in the first round. Honvéd lost the away leg 2–3, but before the home leg could be played, the Hungarian Revolution erupted in Budapest and was subsequently brutally repressed by Soviet forces. The players decided against going back to communist Hungary and arranged for the return with Athletic to be played at Heysel Stadium in Brussels, Belgium. Puskás scored in the subsequent 3–3 draw, his first European Cup goal ever, but Honvéd were eliminated 6–5 on aggregate, and the Hungarian players were left in limbo. They summoned their families from Budapest, and despite opposition from FIFA and the Hungarian football authorities, they organised a fundraising tour of Italy, Portugal, Spain, and Brazil. After returning to Europe, the players parted ways. Some, including Bozsik, returned to Hungary while others, including Czibor, Kocsis and Puskás, found new clubs in Western Europe. Puskás did not return to Hungary until 1981.

==Spanish career==
===Real Madrid===
After refusing to return to Hungary, Puskás initially played a few unofficial games for Espanyol. At the same time, both AC Milan and Juventus attempted to sign him, but then he received a two-year ban from UEFA for refusing to return to Budapest, which prevented him from playing in Europe. He moved to Austria and then Italy. After his ban expired, Puskás tried to play in Italy but was not able to find a top-flight club willing to sign him, as Italian managers were concerned about his age and weight. He was considered by Manchester United to strengthen a squad ravaged by the Munich air disaster in 1958, but because of FA rules regarding foreigners and Puskás&#x27; not knowing the English language, stand-in manager Jimmy Murphy could not fulfill his wish of signing the Hungarian. However, a few months later, Puskás joined Real Madrid and at the age of 31 embarked on the second phase of his career.

During his first La Liga season, Puskás scored four hat-tricks, including one in his second game, against Sporting de Gijón on 21 September 1958. In the game against Las Palmas on 4 January 1959, Puskás and Alfredo di Stéfano scored hat-tricks in a 10–1 win. During the 1960–61 season, Puskás scored four times in a game against Elche and the following season, he scored five goals against the same team. Puskás scored two hat-tricks against Barcelona in 1963, one at the Bernabéu and one at the Camp Nou. During eight seasons with Real, Puskás played 180 La Liga games and scored 156 goals. He scored 20 or more goals in each of his first six seasons in the Spanish league, and won the &quot;Pichichi&quot; four times: in 1960, 1961, 1963, and 1964, scoring 25, 28, 26 and 21 goals, respectively. He helped Real win La Liga five times in a row between 1961 and 1965 and the Copa del Generalísimo in 1962. He scored both goals in the 2–1 victory over Sevilla in the Copa final.

Puskás also played a further 39 games for Real in the European Cup, scoring 35 goals. He helped Real reach the final of the 1958–59 European Cup, scoring in the first leg and in the decisive replay of the semi-final against Atlético Madrid, but missed the final due to injury. In the following season he began Real&#x27;s 1959–60 European Cup campaign with a hat-trick against Jeunesse Esch and in the semi-final against FC Barcelona, as Puskás once again guided Real into the final with three goals over two legs. In the final itself, Real beat Eintracht Frankfurt 7–3 with Puskás scoring four goals and di Stéfano scoring three. In subsequent European campaigns, he would score a further three hat-tricks, including one in the 1962 final against Benfica, which Real lost 5–3. In 1965, he scored five goals over two games against Feyenoord as he helped Real Madrid to the 1966 European Cup final – Real won the game against Partizan Belgrade, but Puskás did not play.

===Other appearances===
In 1962, Puskás became a naturalized Spanish citizen, and subsequently played four times for Spain. Three of these games were at the 1962 World Cup. In Spain, he was known as Cañoncito Pum (the booming cannon). On 28 October 1963, Puskás appeared in a game for the Madrid football team at the FFM Trofeo Bodas de Oro, and he scored two late goals in a 4–0 win over Andalusia. In 1967, at the age of 40, he appeared in a fundraising friendly game for South Liverpool, the English non-League side, in front of a 10,000-strong sell-out crowd at the club&#x27;s Holly Park stadium.

==Managerial career==
After retiring as a player, Puskás became a coach and managed teams in Europe, North America, South America, Africa, Asia, and Australia.

In 1971, he guided Panathinaikos of Greece to the European Cup final. This was the first time a Greek club has reached a European final, and this would remain the only time for more than half a century, until Olympiakos reached the final of the UEFA Europa Conference League in 2024. En route to the final, Panathinaikos beat Everton in the quarter-finals on away goals, then defeated Red Star Belgrade in the semis, to become the only amateur football team to reach the European Cup/Champions League final. In the final, Panathinaikos lost 2–0 to Johan Cruyff&#x27;s Ajax.

During his four-year tenure at Panathinaikos, Puskás helped the team secure one Greek Championship in 1972. At Panathinaikos he retained the &quot;Pancho&quot; nickname from Spain and is considered Panathinaikos&#x27; greatest ever manager, in the same esteem with his predecessor Stjepan Bobek and has entered the Greek football pantheon after Panathinaikos&#x27; run to the Wembley Final. A few months after leaving Panathinaikos in 1974, he took over Real Murcia, placed last in La Liga when he was appointed in December, failing to save the club from relegation in his only season in charge, while the following year he coached Saudi Arabia and in the same year he also managed Colo-Colo, where he spent two years, without experiencing notable success.

In the summer of 1978 he returned to Greece as coach of AEK Athens, where he was reunited with his former player at Panathinaikos, Mimis Domazos. Puskás led the club to its biggest ever victory in the European Cup, a 6–1 defeat of Portuguese champions Porto in Athens, before their continental run was cut short in the second round by eventual competition winners Nottingham Forest 7–2 on aggregate. However, in March 1979 the club&#x27;s management, fearing the eventual loss of the league, replaced him with his assistant, Andreas Stamatiadis, on an interim role for the final 11 games until the end of the season, due to the unstable performances of the team, which saw them drop to third place in the league table. The club of Athens eventually won the championship with Stamatiadis in charge in a play–off match that was never contested, as rivals Olympiacos refused to play.

Despite his wide travels, his only other silverware came with Sol de América, where he led the club to its first ever league title in 1986, and South Melbourne Hellas, with whom he won the National Soccer League title in 1991, as well as the NSL Cup in 1990, the NSL League Cup in 1990 and two Dockerty Cup titles in 1989 and 1991, becoming the club&#x27;s most successful manager. While managing the Australian club, one of his players was future South Melbourne, Australia and Tottenham Hotspur manager Ange Postecoglou, who has spoken of the influence Puskás&#x27; all out attacking approach and tactical acumen had on his coaching style.

When Wolverhampton Wanderers opened their renovated stadium Molineux in 1993, Puskás visited the newly opened stadium as an honorary guest to watch the friendly match between Wolves and Budapest Honvéd, which was a match to christen the new opening of the stadium. This was because in the 1950s, Wolves played a game against Honvéd in a memorable friendly match, which Puskás played in. Wolves won the 1954 match 3–2, with the 1993 match ending in a 1–1 draw.

Puskás returned to Hungary for the first time in 1981 and in 1990, he made Budapest his home again. In 1993, he took charge of the Hungary national team for four games, including a 4–2 friendly victory against the Republic of Ireland in Dublin, where Hungary came from two goals down to eventually beat their opponents.

==Style of play==
Puskas had excellent ball control, mostly with his left foot, and had a great first touch of the ball giving very quick and precise passing and crossing. He also was able to maneuver and change positions quickly on the pitch by moving from inside left to centre forward. He was also able to dummy his opponents with fake dribbles and would confuse his markers by pretending to go one way before going another. He did this to Bill Eckersley and Harry Johnston when Hungary beat England 6–3 at Wembley. Puskas also used to move the ball in different directions and sideways to go past his opponents with ease. Puskas was also excellent at the set pieces, often scoring powerful direct free-kicks. He also scored directly from a corner kick. Puskas had one of the most powerful left shots in history and often scored from 30 to 35 metres from goal.

==Later life and death==
Puskás was diagnosed with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease in 2000. He was admitted to a Budapest hospital in September 2006 and died on 17 November 2006 of pneumonia. He was 79 years old and was survived by his wife of 57 years, Erzsébet, and their daughter, Anikó. In a state funeral, his coffin was moved from Puskás Ferenc Stadion to Heroes&#x27; Square for a military salute. He was buried under the dome of St. Stephen&#x27;s Basilica in Budapest on 9 December 2006.

<text>Helmut Rahn (16 August 1929 – 14 August 2003), known as &quot;Der Boss&quot; (The Boss), was a German footballer who played as a forward. He became a legend for having scored the winning goal in the final of the 1954 FIFA World Cup (West Germany vs. Hungary 3–2). Rahn, along with the German team, were decorated by the President of the Federal Republic of Germany in 1972.

== Career ==
Rahn started his career with &quot;Altenessen 1912&quot; where he played from 1938 until 1946. Then he went to &quot;SC Oelde 09&quot; with a total score of 52 goals for that team. In the 1950–51 season, he played for &quot;Sportfreunde Katernberg&quot;.

He was most successful when he played for Rot-Weiss Essen from 1951 to 1959. The team won the DFB-Pokal final in 1953 and won the German Championship in 1955. For one year, from 1959 till 1960 he had played at 1. FC Köln, 1960 he went to Sportclub Enschede in the Netherlands.

In the Bundesliga 1963 he started playing for MSV Duisburg. He finished his career in 1965 because of a knee problem and, along with Hans Schäfer was one of the last members of the 1954 World Cup winning side to retire. His position was that of an outside right.

His legendary status in German football was sparked by the heroic achievement of the German team in the final of the 1954 World Cup.
Germany, whose team members themselves were surprised to be in the final, was playing Hungary, who hadn&#x27;t lost a single match for four years running up to the World Cup final, and had already beaten Germany 8–3 in the group stage earlier in the tournament. Germany lagged behind 0–2 after only eight minutes, but then pulled it back to 2–2 with Rahn assisting the first German goal and scoring the second. With six minutes remaining, Rahn received the ball just outside the penalty box before going past a Hungarian player and managing to shoot at the lower left corner with his weaker left foot just before being tackled. The ball whistled into the back of the net and Germany went on to win the game 3–2 over the apparently unbeatable Hungarian team. This match is known in Germany as The Miracle of Bern (&quot;Das Wunder von Bern&quot;) because of its &quot;David versus Goliath&quot;-like setting, and it is generally seen as an instrumental part of the rebuilding of the German people&#x27;s morale after World War II.

Rahn was also part of the German team that reached semifinals at the 1958 World Cup. With his goal against Yugoslavia, he became at the time the third maximum scorer in World Cups, with 10 total goals (behind Just Fontaine and Sándor Kocsis), and also the first player ever to score at least four goals in two different World Cups.

Rahn played 40 international matches and scored a total of 21 goals. He was known as &quot;Der Boss&quot; (&quot;The Boss&quot;) because of his on-field leadership and occasionally as &quot;The Cannon from Essen&quot;.

== Later life ==

After retiring from football, Rahn started his own car dealership in Essen-Altenessen, along Altenessener Street. He was known for his good sense of humour and his joy and ability at talking with others. Many stories about him still circulate throughout Essen. One such story involves a discussion he once had with a friend regarding his car dealership:

Rahn was once asked by a friend, how his car dealership worked. His very direct answer: &quot;I buy a car for 1,000 DM and sell it for 4,000 DM. And I live off the three percent profit.&quot;

He died two days shy of his 74th birthday, in Essen. The film &quot;The Miracle of Bern&quot; was dedicated to him by director Sönke Wortmann.

== Family ==
In 1953, Rahn married Gerti Seller, and the couple had two sons, Uwe (born 1954) and Klaus Rahn. Rahn is allegedly the cousin of the grandfather of Kevin-Prince Boateng of the Ghana national football team.

== Helmut Rahn Memorial ==

On 11 July 2004, 50 years after the Bern match, a lifesize statue of Rahn was put up near Georg-Melches-Stadium in Essen, on the square named after him.

<text>William Joseph Casey (March 13, 1913 – May 6, 1987) was an American lawyer who was the Director of Central Intelligence from 1981 to 1987. In this capacity he oversaw the entire United States Intelligence Community and personally directed the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).

== Early life and education ==
A native of the Elmhurst section of Queens, New York, Casey was raised as a Roman Catholic in Bellmore, New York and graduated from the Jesuit-affiliated Fordham University in 1934. He continued his education at other Catholic institutions, completing graduate work at the Catholic University of America before earning an LL.B. from St. John&#x27;s University School of Law in 1937. He was of Irish ancestry.

== Career ==
=== Early career ===
Following his admission to the bar, he was a partner in the New York–based Buckner, Casey, Doran and Siegel from 1938 to 1942. Concurrently, as chairman of the board of editors of the Research Institute of America (1938–1949), Casey initially conceptualized the tax shelter and &quot;explained to businessmen how little they need[ed] to do in order to stay on the right side of New Deal regulatory legislation.&quot;

=== World War II &amp; OSS ===
During World War II, he worked for the Office of Strategic Services, where he became head of its Secret Intelligence Branch in Europe. He served in the United States Naval Reserve until December 1944 before remaining in his OSS position as a civilian until his resignation in September 1945; as an officer, he attained the rank of lieutenant and was awarded the Bronze Star Medal for meritorious achievement.

=== Postwar business and government career ===
Following the dissolution of the OSS in September 1945, Casey returned to his legal and business ventures. After serving as a special counsel to the United States Senate (1947–1948) and associate general counsel to the Point Four Program (1948), Casey founded the Institute for Business Planning in 1950; there, he amassed much of his early wealth (compounded by investments) by writing early data-driven publications on business law. He was a lecturer in tax law at the New York University School of Law from 1948 to 1962. From 1957 to 1971, he was a partner at Hall, Casey, Dickler &amp; Howley, a New York corporate law firm, under the auspices of founding partner and prominent Republican politician Leonard W. Hall. He ran as a Republican for New York&#x27;s 3rd congressional district in 1966, but was defeated in the primary by former Congressman Steven Derounian.

=== Nixon &amp; Ford administrations ===
He served in the Nixon administration as the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission from 1971 to 1973; this position led to his being called as a prosecution witness against former Attorney General John N. Mitchell and former Commerce Secretary Maurice Stans in an influence-peddling case stemming from international financier Robert Vesco&#x27;s $200,000 contribution to the Nixon reelection campaign.

He then served as Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs (1973–1974) and chairman of the Export-Import Bank of the United States (Eximbank) (1974–1976). During this era, he was also a member of the President&#x27;s Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board (1975–1976) and of counsel to Rogers &amp; Wells (1976–1981).

=== Return to private work ===
Casey returned to private law practice in 1976. With Antony Fisher, he co-founded the Manhattan Institute in 1978. Casey represented 117 clients from 1976 to 1981. Among Casey&#x27;s clients were the governments of Indonesia and South Korea, which were then military dictatorships. Casey would fail to disclose his legal clients and finances from the 1970s to the U.S. Senate during his confirmation hearings to become Director of Central Intelligence.

=== Reagan campaign and transition ===

As campaign manager of Ronald Reagan&#x27;s successful presidential campaign in 1980, Casey helped to broker Reagan&#x27;s unlikely alliance with vice presidential nominee George H. W. Bush.

Shortly before the final presidential debate on October 28, 1980, the Reagan campaign acquired President Jimmy Carter&#x27;s briefing papers, classified top secret, that Carter used in preparation for the debate. The importance of these documents is still subject to debate, but the leak of campaign papers was not divulged to the public until late June 1983. James Baker has claimed that he had received the briefing book from Casey, who vehemently denied this before his death.

According to Ben Barnes, Casey met with Barnes and former Texas Governor John Connally in September 1980 to discuss Connally&#x27;s trip to the Middle East. During the trip, Connally asked Arab leaders to convey to the Iranian government that Iran should wait to release American hostages until after the election of 1980 was concluded. Barnes claimed that Casey discussed with Connally if the Iranians &quot;were going to hold the hostages,&quot; possibly corroborating the October Surprise theory. The hostages were released minutes after Reagan was inaugurated as president.

Casey then served on the transition team following the election.

=== Director of Central Intelligence ===
After Reagan took office, Reagan named Casey to the post of Director of Central Intelligence (DCI). Outgoing Director Stansfield Turner characterized the appointment as the &quot;Resurrection of Wild Bill,&quot; referring to Bill Donovan, the brilliant and eccentric head of Office of Strategic Services in World War II, whom Casey had known and greatly admired.

Despite Casey&#x27;s background in intelligence, the position was not his first choice; according to Rhoda Koenig, he only agreed to take the appointment after being assured that &quot;he could have a hand in shaping foreign policy rather than simply reporting the data on which it was based.&quot; Breaking precedent, Reagan elevated the role to a Cabinet-level position for the duration of Casey&#x27;s appointment.

Ronald Reagan used prominent Catholics in his government to brief Pope John Paul II of developments in the Cold War. Casey would fly secretly to Rome in a windowless C-141 black jet and &quot;be taken undercover to the Vatican.

Casey oversaw the re-expansion of the Intelligence Community to funding and human resource levels greater than those existing before the preceding Carter Administration; in particular, he increased levels within the CIA. During his tenure, post-Watergate and Church Committee restrictions were controversially lifted on the use of the CIA to directly and covertly influence the internal and foreign affairs of countries relevant to American policy.

This period of the Cold War saw an increase in the Agency&#x27;s global, anti-Soviet activities, which started under the Carter Doctrine in late 1980.

====Iran–Contra affair====

Casey was suspected, by some, of involvement with the controversial Iran-Contra affair, in which Reagan administration personnel secretly traded arms to the Islamic Republic of Iran, and secretly diverted some of the resulting income to aid the rebel Contras in Nicaragua, in violation of U.S. law. Casey was called to testify before Congress about his knowledge of the affair. On 15 December 1986, one day before Casey was scheduled to testify before Congress, Casey suffered two seizures and was hospitalized. Three days later, Casey underwent surgery for a previously undiagnosed brain tumor. While hospitalized, Casey died less than 24 hours after former colleague Richard Secord testified that Casey supported the illegal aiding of the Contras.

In his November 1987 book, &quot;Veil: The Secret Wars of the CIA 1981–1987,&quot; &quot;Washington Post&quot; reporter and biographer Bob Woodward, who had interviewed Casey on a number of occasions for the biography, said that he had gained entry into Casey&#x27;s hospital room for a final, four-minute encounter—a claim which was met with disbelief in many quarters as well as an adamant denial from Casey&#x27;s wife, Sofia. According to Woodward, when Casey was asked if he knew about the diversion of funds to the Nicaraguan &quot;Contras&quot;, &quot;His head jerked up hard. He stared, and finally nodded yes.&quot;

In his final report (submitted in August 1993), Independent Counsel Lawrence E. Walsh indicated evidence of Casey&#x27;s involvement:

There is evidence that Casey played a role as a Cabinet-level advocate both in setting up the covert network to resupply the contras during the Boland funding cut-off, and in promoting the secret arms sales to Iran in 1985 and 1986. In both instances, Casey was acting in furtherance of broad policies established by President Reagan.

There is evidence that Casey, working with two national security advisers to President Reagan during the period 1984 through 1986—Robert C. McFarlane and Vice Admiral John M. Poindexter—approved having these operations conducted out of the National Security Council staff with Lt. Col. Oliver L. North as the action officer, assisted by retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard V. Secord. And although Casey tried to insulate himself and the CIA from any illegal activities relating to the two secret operations ... there is evidence that he was involved in at least some of those activities and may have attempted to keep them concealed from Congress.
However, Walsh also wrote: &quot;Independent Counsel obtained no documentary evidence showing Casey knew about or approved the diversion. The only direct testimony linking Casey to early knowledge of the diversion came from [Oliver] North.&quot; Posthumously, the House October Surprise Task Force eventually exonerated Casey after first holding hearings to establish a need for investigation, the outcome of the investigation, the response of Casey&#x27;s family to the task force&#x27;s closure of the investigation, and Walsh&#x27;s final Independent Counsel report.

==Personal life==
Casey was a member of the Knights of Malta. He also attended the secretive Le Cercle meetings.

In 1948, he purchased Locust Knoll, an North Shore estate centered around a main 1854 Jacobethan house in Roslyn Harbor, New York, for $50,000. After renaming the estate Mayknoll, it remained his principal residence until his death.

His daughter Bernadette was married to Casey&#x27;s business partner, the late Owen Smith. Smith was the chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Institute of World Politics and a professor at Long Island University.

== Death ==
Casey died of a brain tumor on May 6, 1987, at the age of 74. His Requiem Mass was said by Fr. Daniel Fagan, then pastor of St. Mary&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church in Roslyn, New York, and his funeral was led by Bishop John R. McGann, who used his pulpit to castigate Casey for his ethics and actions in Nicaragua. It was attended by President Reagan and the First Lady. Casey is buried in the Cemetery of the Holy Rood in Westbury, New York.

He was survived by his wife, the former Sophia Kurz (d. 2000), and his daughter, Bernadette Casey Smith.

<text>Dysgeusia, also known as parageusia, is a distortion of the sense of taste. Dysgeusia is also often associated with ageusia, which is the complete lack of taste, and hypogeusia, which is a decrease in taste sensitivity. An alteration in taste or smell may be a secondary process in various disease states, or it may be the primary symptom. The distortion in the sense of taste is the only symptom, and diagnosis is usually complicated since the sense of taste is tied together with other sensory systems. Common causes of dysgeusia include chemotherapy, asthma treatment with albuterol, and zinc deficiency. Liver disease, hypothyroidism, and rarely, certain types of seizures can also lead to dysgeusia. Different drugs can also be responsible for altering taste and resulting in dysgeusia. Due to the variety of causes of dysgeusia, there are many possible treatments that are effective in alleviating or terminating the symptoms. These include artificial saliva, pilocarpine, zinc supplementation, alterations in drug therapy, and alpha lipoic acid.

==Signs and symptoms==
The alterations in the sense of taste, usually a metallic taste, and sometimes smell are the only symptoms.

==Causes==

===Chemotherapy===
A major cause of dysgeusia is chemotherapy for cancer. Chemotherapy often induces damage to the oral cavity, resulting in oral mucositis, oral infection, and salivary gland dysfunction. Oral mucositis consists of inflammation of the mouth, along with sores and ulcers in the tissues. Healthy individuals normally have a diverse range of microbial organisms residing in their oral cavities; however, chemotherapy can permit these typically non-pathogenic agents to cause serious infection, which may result in a decrease in saliva. In addition, patients who undergo radiation therapy also lose salivary tissues. Saliva is an important component of the taste mechanism. Saliva both interacts with and protects the taste receptors in the mouth. Saliva mediates sour and sweet tastes through bicarbonate ions and glutamate, respectively. The salt taste is induced when sodium chloride levels surpass the concentration in the saliva. It has been reported that 50% of chemotherapy patients have had either dysgeusia or another form of taste impairment. Examples of chemotherapy treatments that can lead to dysgeusia are cyclophosphamide, cisplatin, vismodegib, and etoposide. The exact mechanism of chemotherapy-induced dysgeusia is unknown.

===Taste buds===

Distortions in the taste buds may give rise to dysgeusia. In a study conducted by Masahide Yasuda and Hitoshi Tomita from Nihon University of Japan, it has been observed that patients with this taste disorder have fewer microvilli than normal. In addition, the nucleus and cytoplasm of the taste bud cells have been reduced. Based on their findings, dysgeusia results from loss of microvilli and the reduction of Type III intracellular vesicles, all of which could potentially interfere with the gustatory pathway. Radiation to head and neck also results in direct destruction of taste buds, apart from effects of altered salivary output.

===Zinc deficiency===

Another primary cause of dysgeusia is zinc deficiency. While the exact role of zinc in dysgeusia is unknown, it has been cited that zinc is partly responsible for the repair and production of taste buds. Zinc somehow directly or indirectly interacts with carbonic anhydrase VI, influencing the concentration of gustin, which is linked to the production of taste buds. It has also been reported that patients treated with zinc experience an elevation in calcium concentration in the saliva. In order to work properly, taste buds rely on calcium receptors. Zinc &quot;is an important cofactor for alkaline phosphatase, the most abundant enzyme in taste bud membranes; it is also a component of a parotid salivary protein important to the development and maintenance of normal taste buds&quot;.

=== Taste Modifiers ===
Miraculin Found in miracle berries, sweetens nonsweet food and beverages.

Gymnema sylvestre Blocks the ability to taste sweetness.

===Drugs===

There are also a wide variety of drugs that can trigger dysgeusia, including zopiclone, H1-antihistamines, such as azelastine and emedastine. Approximately 250 drugs affect taste, including Paxlovid, a drug used to treat COVID-19. Some describe so-called &quot;Paxlovid mouth&quot; as like a &quot;mouthful of dirty pennies and rotten soymilk&quot;, according to the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot;.

The sodium channels linked to taste receptors can be inhibited by amiloride, and the creation of new taste buds and saliva can be impeded by antiproliferative drugs. Saliva can have traces of the drug, giving rise to a metallic flavor in the mouth; examples include lithium carbonate and tetracyclines. Drugs containing sulfhydryl groups, including penicillamine and captopril, may react with zinc and cause deficiency. Metronidazole and chlorhexidine have been found to interact with metal ions that associate with the cell membrane. Drugs that act by blocking the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system, for example by antagonizing the angiotensin II receptor (as eprosartan does), have been linked to dysgeusia. There are few case reports claiming calcium channel blockers like Amlodipine also cause dysgeusia by blocking calcium sensitive taste buds.

===Pregnancy===

Changes in hormone levels during pregnancy, such as estrogen, can affect the sense of taste. A study found that 93 percent of pregnant women reported some change in taste during pregnancy.

===Miscellaneous causes===
Xerostomia, also known as dry mouth syndrome, can precipitate dysgeusia because normal salivary flow and concentration are necessary for taste. Injury to the glossopharyngeal nerve can result in dysgeusia. In addition, damage done to the pons, thalamus, and midbrain, all of which compose the gustatory pathway, can be potential factors. In a case study, 22% of patients who were experiencing a bladder obstruction were also experiencing dysgeusia. Dysgeusia was eliminated in 100% of these patients once the obstruction was removed. Although it is uncertain what the relationship between bladder relief and dysgeusia entails, it has been observed that the areas responsible for urinary system and taste in the pons and cerebral cortex in the brain are close in proximity.

Dysgeusia can be a symptom of head and neck cancer. In this case it often present together with having dry mouth.

Dysgeusia often occurs for unknown reasons. A wide range of miscellaneous factors may contribute to this taste disorder, such as gastric reflux, lead poisoning, and diabetes mellitus. A minority of pine nuts can apparently cause taste disturbances, for reasons which are not entirely proven. Certain pesticides can have damaging effects on the taste buds and nerves in the mouth. These pesticides include organochloride compounds and carbamate pesticides. Damage to the peripheral nerves, along with injury to the chorda tympani branch of the facial nerve, also cause dysgeusia. A surgical risk for laryngoscopy and tonsillectomy include dysgeusia. Patients with burning mouth syndrome, primarily menopausal women, often have dysgeusia as well.

===Normal function===

The sense of taste is based on the detection of chemicals by specialized taste cells in the mouth. The mouth, throat, larynx, and esophagus all have taste buds, which are replaced every ten days. Each taste bud contains receptor cells. Afferent nerves make contact with the receptor cells at the base of the taste bud. A single taste bud is innervated by several afferent nerves, while a single efferent fiber innervates several taste buds. Fungiform papillae are present on the anterior portion of the tongue while circumvallate papillae and foliate papillae are found on the posterior portion of the tongue. The salivary glands are responsible for keeping the taste buds moist with saliva.

A single taste bud is composed of four types of cells, and each taste bud has between 30 and 80 cells. Type I cells are thinly shaped, usually in the periphery of other cells. They also contain high amounts of chromatin. Type II cells have prominent nuclei and nucleoli with much less chromatin than Type I cells. Type III cells have multiple mitochondria and large vesicles. Type I, II, and III cells also contain synapses. Type IV cells are normally rooted at the posterior end of the taste bud. Every cell in the taste bud forms microvilli at the ends.

==Diagnosis==
In general, gustatory disorders are challenging to diagnose and evaluate. Because gustatory functions are tied to the sense of smell, the somatosensory system, and the perception of pain (such as in tasting spicy foods), it is difficult to examine sensations mediated through an individual system. In addition, gustatory dysfunction is rare when compared to olfactory disorders.

Diagnosis of dysgeusia begins with the patient being questioned about salivation, swallowing, chewing, oral pain, previous ear infections (possibly indicated by hearing or balance problems), oral hygiene, and stomach problems. The initial history assessment also considers the possibility of accompanying diseases such as diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, or cancer. A clinical examination is conducted and includes an inspection of the tongue and the oral cavity. Furthermore, the ear canal is inspected, as lesions of the chorda tympani have a predilection for this site.

===Gustatory testing===

In order to further classify the extent of dysgeusia and clinically measure the sense of taste, gustatory testing may be performed. Gustatory testing is performed either as a whole-mouth procedure or as a regional test. In both techniques, natural or electrical stimuli can be used. In regional testing, 20 to 50 μL of liquid stimulus is presented to the anterior and posterior tongue using a pipette, soaked filter-paper disks, or cotton swabs. In whole mouth testing, small quantities (2-10 mL) of solution are administered, and the patient is asked to swish the solution around in the mouth.

Threshold tests for sucrose (sweet), citric acid (sour), sodium chloride (salty), and quinine or caffeine (bitter) are frequently performed with natural stimuli. One of the most frequently used techniques is the &quot;three-drop test&quot;. In this test, three drops of liquid are presented to the subject. One of the drops is of the taste stimulus, and the other two drops are pure water. Threshold is defined as the concentration at which the patient identifies the taste correctly three times in a row.

Suprathreshold tests, which provide intensities of taste stimuli above threshold levels, are used to assess the patient&#x27;s ability to differentiate between different intensities of taste and to estimate the magnitude of suprathreshold loss of taste. From these tests, ratings of pleasantness can be obtained using either the direct scaling or magnitude matching method and may be of value in the diagnosis of dysgeusia. Direct scaling tests show the ability to discriminate among different intensities of stimuli and whether a stimulus of one quality (sweet) is stronger or weaker than a stimulus of another quality (sour). Direct scaling cannot be used to determine if a taste stimulus is being perceived at abnormal levels. In this case, magnitude matching is used, in which a patient is asked to rate the intensities of taste stimuli and stimuli of another sensory system, such as the loudness of a tone, on a similar scale. For example, the Connecticut Chemosensory Clinical Research Center asks patients to rate the intensities of NaCl, sucrose, citric acid and quinine-HCl stimuli, and the loudness of 1000 Hz tones.

Other tests include identification or discrimination of common taste substances. Topical anesthesia of the tongue has been reported to be of use in the diagnosis of dysgeusia as well, since it has been shown to relieve the symptoms of dysgeusia temporarily. In addition to techniques based on the administration of chemicals to the tongue, electrogustometry is frequently used. It is based on the induction of gustatory sensations by means of an anodal electrical direct current. Patients usually report sour or metallic sensations similar to those associated with touching both poles of a live battery to the tongue. Although electrogustometry is widely used, there seems to be a poor correlation between electrically and chemically induced sensations.

===Diagnostic tools===

Certain diagnostic tools can also be used to help determine the extent of dysgeusia. Electrophysiological tests and simple reflex tests may be applied to identify abnormalities in the nerve-to-brainstem pathways. For example, the blink reflex may be used to evaluate the integrity of the trigeminal nerve–pontine brainstem–facial nerve pathway, which may play a role in gustatory function.

Structural imaging is routinely used to investigate lesions in the taste pathway. Magnetic resonance imaging allows direct visualization of the cranial nerves. Furthermore, it provides significant information about the type and cause of a lesion. Analysis of mucosal blood flow in the oral cavity in combination with the assessment of autonomous cardiovascular factors appears to be useful in the diagnosis of autonomic nervous system disorders in burning mouth syndrome and in patients with inborn disorders, both of which are associated with gustatory dysfunction. Cell cultures may also be used.

In addition, the analysis of saliva should be performed, as it constitutes the environment of taste receptors, including transport of tastes to the receptor and protection of the taste receptor. Typical clinical investigations involve sialometry and sialochemistry. Studies have shown that electron micrographs of taste receptors obtained from saliva samples indicate pathological changes in the taste buds of patients with dysgeusia and other gustatory disorders.

==Treatments==

===Artificial saliva and pilocarpine===

Because medications have been linked to approximately 22% to 28% of all cases of dysgeusia, researching a treatment for this particular cause has been important. Xerostomia, or a decrease in saliva flow, can be a side effect of many drugs, which, in turn, can lead to the development of taste disturbances such as dysgeusia. Patients can lessen the effects of xerostomia with breath mints, sugarless gum, or lozenges; or physicians can increase saliva flow with artificial saliva or oral pilocarpine. Artificial saliva mimics the characteristics of natural saliva by lubricating and protecting the mouth, but does not provide any digestive or enzymatic benefits. Pilocarpine is a cholinergic drug, meaning it has the same effects as the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Acetylcholine has the function of stimulating the salivary glands to actively produce saliva. The increase in saliva flow is effective in improving the movement of tastants to the taste buds.

===Zinc deficiency===

====Zinc supplementation====

Approximately one half of drug-related taste distortions are caused by a zinc deficiency. Many medications are known to chelate, or bind, zinc, preventing the element from functioning properly. Due to the causal relationship of insufficient zinc levels to taste disorders, research has been conducted to test the efficacy of zinc supplementation as a possible treatment for dysgeusia. In a randomized clinical trial, fifty patients with idiopathic dysgeusia were given either zinc or a lactose placebo. The patients prescribed the zinc reported experiencing improved taste function and less severe symptoms compared to the control group, suggesting that zinc may be a beneficial treatment. The efficacy of zinc, however, has been ambiguous in the past. In a second study, 94% of patients who were provided with zinc supplementation did not experience any improvement in their condition. This ambiguity is most likely due to small sample sizes and the wide range of causes of dysgeusia. A recommended daily oral dose of 25–100 mg, as zinc gluconate, appears to be an effective treatment for taste dysfunction provided that there are low levels of zinc in the blood serum. There is not a sufficient amount of evidence to determine whether or not zinc supplementation is able to treat dysgeusia when low zinc concentrations are not detected in the blood.

A Cochrane Review in 2017 assessed the effects of different interventions for the management of taste disturbances. There was very low-quality evidence to support the role of zinc supplementation in the improvement of taste acuity and taste discrimination in patients with zinc deficiency or idiopathic taste disorders. Further research is required to improve the quality of evidence for zinc supplementation as an effective intervention for the management of dysgeusia.

====Zinc infusion in chemotherapy====

It has been reported that approximately 68% of cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy experience disturbances in sensory perception such as dysgeusia. In a pilot study involving twelve lung cancer patients, chemotherapy drugs were infused with zinc in order to test its potential as a treatment. The results indicated that, after two weeks, no taste disturbances were reported by the patients who received the zinc-supplemented treatment while most of the patients in the control group who did not receive the zinc reported taste alterations. A multi-institutional study involving a larger sample size of 169 patients, however, indicated that zinc-infused chemotherapy did not have an effect on the development of taste disorders in cancer patients. An excess amount of zinc in the body can have negative effects on the immune system, and physicians must use caution when administering zinc to immunocompromised cancer patients. Because taste disorders can have detrimental effects on a patient&#x27;s quality of life, more research needs to be conducted concerning possible treatments such as zinc supplementation.

===Altering drug therapy===

The effects of drug-related dysgeusia can often be reversed by stopping the patient&#x27;s regimen of the taste altering medication. In one case, a forty-eight-year-old woman who had hypertension was being treated with valsartan. Due to this drug&#x27;s inability to treat her condition, she began taking a regimen of eprosartan, an angiotensin II receptor antagonist. Within three weeks, she began experiencing a metallic taste and a burning sensation in her mouth that ceased when she stopped taking the medication. When she began taking eprosartan on a second occasion, her dysgeusia returned. In a second case, a fifty-nine-year-old man was prescribed amlodipine in order to treat his hypertension. After eight years of taking the drug, he developed a loss of taste sensation and numbness in his tongue. When he ran out of his medication, he decided not to obtain a refill and stopped taking amlodipine. Following this self-removal, he reported experiencing a return of his taste sensation. Once he refilled his prescription and began taking amlodipine a second time, his taste disturbance reoccurred. These two cases suggest that there is an association between these drugs and taste disorders. This link is supported by the &quot;de-challenge&quot; and &quot;re-challenge&quot; that took place in both instances. It appears that drug-induced dysgeusia can be alleviated by reducing the drug&#x27;s dose or by substituting a second drug from the same class.

===Alpha lipoic acid===
Alpha lipoic acid (ALA) is an antioxidant that is made naturally by human cells. It can also be administered in capsules or can be found in foods such as red meat, organ meats, and yeast. Like other antioxidants, it functions by ridding the body of harmful free radicals that can cause damage to tissues and organs. It has an important role in the Krebs cycle as a coenzyme leading to the production of antioxidants, intracellular glutathione, and nerve-growth factors. Animal research has also uncovered the ability of ALA to improve nerve conduction velocity. Because flavors are perceived by differences in electric potential through specific nerves innervating the tongue, idiopathic dysgeusia may be a form of a neuropathy. ALA has proven to be an effective treatment for burning mouth syndrome, spurring studies in its potential to treat dysgeusia. In a study of forty-four patients diagnosed with the disorder, one half was treated with the drug for two months, while the other half, the control group, was given a placebo for two months, followed by a two-month treatment of ALA. The results showed that 91% of the group initially treated with ALA reported an improvement in their condition compared to only 36% of the control group. After the control group was treated with ALA, 72% reported an improvement. This study suggests that ALA may be a potential treatment for patients, and supports that full double blind randomized studies should be performed.

===Managing dysgeusia===

In addition to the aforementioned treatments, there are also many management approaches that can alleviate the symptoms of dysgeusia. These include using non-metallic silverware, avoiding metallic- or bitter-tasting foods, increasing the consumption of foods high in protein, flavoring foods with spices and seasonings, serving foods cold in order to reduce any unpleasant taste or odor, frequently brushing one&#x27;s teeth and utilizing mouthwash, or using sialogogues such as sugar-free gum or sour-tasting drops that stimulate the production of saliva. When taste is impeded, the food experience can also be improved through means other than taste, such as texture, aroma, temperature, and color.

===Psychological impacts===

People with dysgeusia are also forced to manage the impact that the disorder has on their quality of life. An altered sense of taste has effects on food choice and intake, and can lead to weight loss, malnutrition, impaired immunity, and a decline in health. Patients diagnosed with dysgeusia must use caution when adding sugar and salt to food, and must be sure not to overcompensate for their lack of taste with excess amounts. Since the elderly are often on multiple medications, they are at risk for taste disturbances, increasing the chances of developing depression, loss of appetite, and extreme weight loss. This is cause for evaluation and management of their dysgeusia. In patients undergoing chemotherapy, taste distortions can often be severe, and make compliance with cancer treatment difficult. Other problems that may arise include anorexia, and behavioral changes that can be misinterpreted as psychiatric delusions regarding food. Symptoms including paranoia, amnesia, cerebellar malfunction, and lethargy can also manifest when undergoing histidine treatment.

==Future research==

Every year, more than 200,000 individuals see their physicians concerning chemosensory problems, and many more taste disturbances are never reported. Due to the large number of persons affected by taste disorders, basic and clinical research are both receiving support at different institutions and chemosensory research centers across the United States. These taste and smell clinics are focusing their research on better understanding the mechanisms involved in gustatory function and taste disorders such as dysgeusia. For example, the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders is looking into the mechanisms underlying the key receptors on taste cells, and applying this knowledge to the future of medications and artificial food products. Meanwhile, the Taste and Smell Clinic at the University of Connecticut Health Center is integrating behavioral, neurophysiological, and genetic studies involving stimulus concentrations and intensities, in order to better understand taste function.

<text>William Casey was an Anglican bishop in Ireland during the sixteenth century.

Formerly Rector of Kilcornan, he was nominated Bishop of Limerick by King Edward VI on 6 July 1551 and consecrated at Dublin on 25 October 1551. He was deprived by Queen Mary I in 1556 and restored by Queen Elizabeth I on 8 May 1571. He died on 7 February 1591.

==In popular culture==
* Around 1577, a caustic satire against Irish Anglican bishops Miler Magrath, Matthew Sheyn, William Casey, and a fourth bishop no longer recognizable, was composed as Irish bardic poetry by the Franciscan Friar Eoghan Ó Dubhthaigh (Owen O&#x27;Duffy). In the poem, which begins, &quot;Léig dod chomortus dúinn&quot; (&quot;No more of your companions for us&quot;), the bishops are skewered for having renounced veneration of the Blessed Virgin in return for earthly wives, whom Friar O&#x27;Duffy then compares in a very unflattering way to the Mother of Jesus Christ.

<doc id="205161" wikidata="Q745517" url="?curid=205161" title="Bad Company">
<text>Bad Company were an English rock supergroup formed in London in 1973 by singer Paul Rodgers and drummer Simon Kirke (both ex-Free), guitarist Mick Ralphs (ex-Mott the Hoople) and bassist Boz Burrell (ex-King Crimson). Kirke was the only member to remain throughout the band&#x27;s entire run, while he and Ralphs were the only members to appear on every studio album. Peter Grant, who managed the rock band Led Zeppelin, also managed Bad Company until 1982.

Bad Company enjoyed great success throughout the 1970s. Their first three albums, &quot;Bad Company&quot; (1974), &quot;Straight Shooter&quot; (1975) and &quot;Run with the Pack&quot; (1976), reached the top five in the album charts in both the UK and the US. Many of their singles and songs, such as &quot;Bad Company&quot;, &quot;Can&#x27;t Get Enough&quot; (1974), &quot;Feel Like Makin&#x27; Love&quot; (1975), &quot;Shooting Star&quot; (1975), &quot;Burnin&#x27; Sky&quot; (1977) and &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Fantasy&quot; (1979), remain staples of classic rock radio. They have sold 20 million RIAA-certified albums in the US and 40 million worldwide. Though they initially disbanded in 1982, Bad Company reunited on many occasions to record and tour until 2019. In 2023, Kirke revealed that they would not continue as a band following the development of Rodgers&#x27; recent health issues.

==History==
===Original Paul Rodgers era (1973–1982)===
Bad Company was formed in Westminster, London. It consisted of four seasoned musicians: two former members of Free, singer Paul Rodgers and drummer Simon Kirke; former Mott the Hoople guitarist Mick Ralphs; and ex-King Crimson bassist Boz Burrell. The band signed to Swan Song Records/Atlantic Records in North America, and with Island Records in other countries. (Island Records had until that time been the UK home to both Free and King Crimson, as well as to Mott the Hoople for their first four albums; Atlantic, in turn, released King Crimson&#x27;s and Mott&#x27;s early albums in the US through a licensing agreement with Island). Atlantic/Warner Music would later acquire the non-North American rights to the band&#x27;s catalogue.

Contrary to speculation that singer Paul Rodgers named the band after the Jeff Bridges film &quot;Bad Company&quot;, Rodgers stated in an interview with Spinner.com that the idea came from a book of Victorian morals that showed a picture of an innocent child looking up at an unsavoury character leaning against a lamp post. The caption read &quot;beware of bad company&quot;.

The band&#x27;s 1974 debut album, &quot;Bad Company&quot;, was recorded at Headley Grange, Hampshire, in Ronnie Lane&#x27;s Mobile Studio. The album reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in the US, and number 3 in the UK Albums Chart, spending 25 weeks in the UK charts. The album has been certified five times platinum in the US, and became the 46th–best-selling album of the 1970s. The singles &quot;Can&#x27;t Get Enough&quot; and &quot;Movin&#x27; On&quot; reached No. 5 and No. 19 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

In 1975, their second album, &quot;Straight Shooter&quot;, reached No. 3 in both the UK and the US and also went platinum in the US. The album also spawned two hit singles, &quot;Good Lovin&#x27; Gone Bad&quot; at No. 36 and the slower &quot;Feel Like Makin&#x27; Love&quot; at No. 10.

Their third album, &quot;Run with the Pack&quot;, was released in 1976 and reached No. 4 in the UK and No. 5 in the US. Bad Company scheduled a British tour with the band of former Free member Paul Kossoff, Back Street Crawler, to support the album, as well as a new album by Back Street Crawler. This double headline tour was scheduled to commence on 25 April 1976 but was halted due to Kossoff&#x27;s death on 19 March 1976.

Released in 1977, &quot;Burnin&#x27; Sky&quot; fared the poorest of their first four records, reaching No. 15 in the US and No. 17 in the UK. &quot;Desolation Angels&quot;, released in 1979, did better than its predecessor, peaking at No. 3 in the US and No. 10 in the UK. &quot;Desolation Angels&quot; also embellished the group&#x27;s sound with synthesisers and strings. It had two charting singles: &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Fantasy&quot; at No. 13 and &quot;Gone Gone Gone&quot; at No. 56.

By the end of the 1970s, however, the band grew increasingly disenchanted with playing large stadiums. In addition, Peter Grant lost interest in the group and management in general after Led Zeppelin drummer John Bonham died on 25 September 1980. In the words of Simon Kirke, &quot;Peter was definitely the glue which held us all together and in his absence we came apart&quot;.

A three-year hiatus from the studio ended with the release of &quot;Rough Diamonds&quot; in August 1982. This would be the sixth and final LP in the group&#x27;s original incarnation until four new songs were recorded in 1998. The album was the worst-selling Bad Company album of those featuring Paul Rodgers as the front man. The album peaked at No. 15 in the UK and No. 26 in the US.

After the release of &quot;Rough Diamonds&quot;, Bad Company disbanded. Mick Ralphs said, &quot;Paul wanted a break and truthfully we all needed to stop. Bad Company had become bigger than us all and to continue would have destroyed someone or something. From a business standpoint, it was the wrong thing to do, but Paul&#x27;s instinct was absolutely right&quot;.

Despite being famous for their live shows packing the largest stadiums for almost a decade, Bad Company did not release an official live album of performances from this period until they recorded &quot;What You Hear Is What You Get: The Best of Bad Company&quot; on the &quot;Here Comes Trouble&quot; tour during the Brian Howe era. The album was released in November 1993 and featured live versions of hits from both the Paul Rodgers era and the Brian Howe era. In 2006, the album &quot;Live in Albuquerque 1976&quot; was released, compiled from recordings made by Mick Ralphs, who regularly taped the group&#x27;s shows during the Rodgers era and used the tapes to critique the band&#x27;s performances. Bootlegs of Bad Company&#x27;s live performances from this period were also available, including &quot;Boblingen Live&quot; (1974), &quot;Live in Japan&quot; (1975) and &quot;Shooting Star Live at the L.A. Forum&quot; (1975).

===Brian Howe era (1986–1994)===
In 1985, Mick Ralphs and Simon Kirke, having just worked together the previous year on Ralphs&#x27; solo album &quot;Take This&quot;, decided to reteam for a new project. But in 1986, their label, Atlantic Records, insisted they resume the Bad Company name. Unfortunately, Paul Rodgers was already engaged with a new supergroup called The Firm. With Rodgers gone, the remaining two members partnered with new managers Bud Prager and Phil Carson and teamed up with ex-Ted Nugent vocalist Brian Howe (who was introduced to them by Foreigner&#x27;s Mick Jones) as the new lead singer. In addition, Steve Price joined the band as the new bass player and Greg Dechert (ex-Uriah Heep) joined on keyboards. Howe&#x27;s vocal style brought more of a pop-rock sound to the band, which Atlantic Records was looking for to bring the band back up to arena status after declining turnouts to previous live performances and the dismal sales of &quot;Rough Diamonds&quot;.

The band hired Foreigner producer Keith Olsen to produce the new line-up&#x27;s initial album, 1986&#x27;s &quot;Fame and Fortune&quot;. Burrell agreed to rejoin the band and was name checked on the &quot;Fame and Fortune&quot; album, even though he didn&#x27;t play on it. But just before the supporting tour, he left once again (Steve Price then returned) to play with a jazz outfit called The Tam White Band.

Reflecting the musical style of the mid-1980s, &quot;Fame and Fortune&quot; was laden with keyboards, unlike previous Bad Company albums, but was only modestly successful. The single &quot;This Love&quot; managed to reach No. 85 on the Singles charts but was not the success the band hoped for. In 1987 Dechert was dropped from the line-up as the group decided not to play up the keyboards in their sound as much. They toured that year supporting Deep Purple.

For the next Howe-era album, 1988&#x27;s &quot;Dangerous Age&quot;, the band replaced Olsen with producer Terry Thomas, who got rid of most of the keyboards and returned the band to a guitar-driven sound. Thomas also added small amounts of keyboards as well as rhythm guitars and backing vocals and wrote most of the songs with the band. &quot;Dangerous Age&quot; fared better than its predecessor, spawning several MTV videos and the AOR hits &quot;No Smoke Without a Fire&quot; (#4), &quot;One Night&quot; (#9) and &quot;Shake It Up&quot; (#9, also No. 89 on the Billboard Hot 100 Singles chart). The album went gold and hit the Top 60. For the &quot;Dangerous Age&quot; tour, the band was augmented by Larry Oakes (keyboards, guitar), who had also played with Foreigner. Price and Oakes both left at the conclusion of the tour.

The band&#x27;s next album, &quot;Holy Water&quot;, written mostly by Brian Howe and Terry Thomas, was released in June 1990. The album, also produced by Thomas, was enormously successful both critically and commercially, attaining Top 40 and platinum status by selling more than one million copies. &quot;Holy Water&quot; was the band&#x27;s first album on the Atlantic subsidiary Atco. The album spun off the singles: &quot;If You Needed Somebody&quot; (#16), the title track &quot;Holy Water&quot; (#89) and &quot;Walk Through Fire&quot; (#28). &quot;Holy Water&quot; also hit No. 1 for 2 weeks on the AOR charts with &quot;If You Needed Somebody&quot; reaching No. 2. The album received significant radio airplay (five songs made the AOR charts in all) and spawned several video hits. Felix Krish played bass on the CD while Paul Cullen was recruited for live shows.

Ralphs, who was taking care of personal and family matters, sat out for most of the &quot;Holy Water&quot; tour, although he did perform on the album. Beginning in June 1990, Ralphs was replaced on the road and in the videos by ex-Crawler guitarist Geoff Whitehorn and producer Thomas guested on rhythm guitar and keyboards. Ralphs returned later on during the tour (in April 1991) and Whitehorn went on to join Procol Harum in December 1991, with whom he played up till their 2022 dissolution after Gary Brooker&#x27;s death. Also joining at this time was ex-ASAP guitarist Dave &quot;Bucket&quot; Colwell as the second guitarist. Their subsequent tour, supported by Damn Yankees, was one of the top five grossing tours of 1991.

The final studio album of the Howe era, 1992&#x27;s &quot;Here Comes Trouble&quot;, featured the Top 40 hit &quot;How About That&quot; (#38) and &quot;This Could Be the One&quot; (#87). The album went gold. Before touring in support of &quot;Here Comes Trouble&quot;, the band added ex-Foreigner, Roxy Music and Small Faces bassist Rick Wills and Colwell, a protégé of Ralphs, was now a full-time member. The band toured with several acts, including Lynyrd Skynyrd, and recorded a live album, &quot;What You Hear Is What You Get: The Best of Bad Company&quot; on the &quot;Here Comes Trouble&quot; tour. The album, released in November 1993, featured live versions of hits from both the Rodgers and Howe eras of the band.

Howe left the band in 1994. Regarding his departure from the band, Howe stated: &quot;Leaving Bad Company was not a difficult decision. It had got to the point where nobody was contributing anything to songwriting and quite frankly, the band was getting very very sloppy live. I quite simply, along with Terry Thomas, got tired of doing all the work and then getting nothing but resentment for it from Mick and Simon.&quot;

===Robert Hart era (1994–1998)===
In 1994, ex-Distance frontman Robert Hart was approached by Mick Ralphs and Simon Kirke and asked if he would like to join them as the third lead vocalist for Bad Company, following Paul Rodgers and Brian Howe. Hart performed with Bad Company, including in the USA and Canada. In July 1994 a contract was drawn up by Alliance Artists and Legend Management and signed by the then Bad Company line-up, Mick Ralphs, Simon Kirke, Hart, Dave Colwell and Rick Wills giving Hart the right to perform, write and record songs and albums and receive royalty payments as a full Bad Company member.

In 1995, a self-produced Bad Company album was released with Hart, &quot;Company of Strangers&quot;. It contained five tracks self-penned or co-written by Hart and Ralphs. Many of these were recorded in Nashville and featured guest appearances by country stars such as Vince Gill. The band made a promotional tour of the US with Bon Jovi. Griffin Music of America also re-issued Ralphs&#x27; solo album &quot;Take This!&quot; on CD.

In 1996, another Bad Co album, &quot;Stories Told &amp; Untold&quot;, featured Hart with seven new compositions and seven acoustic versions including &quot;Can&#x27;t Get Enough&quot; and &quot;Ready For Love&quot;.

For their 1996 tour, the Bad Company line-up was: Kirke, Hart, Rick Wills, and Dave &quot;Bucket&quot; Colwell. Ralphs sat out this tour due to health issues, which he had also done frequently during the Brian Howe era.

===Return of Paul Rodgers, touring and inactivity (1998–2008)===
In November 1998, Rodgers and Kirke were discussing the release of an extensive compilation album with a biography and picture. Rodgers decided the album should include four new songs. He finally reunited with the other three original members in the studio to record these four new tracks. The reunion was short-lived, but it produced a Top 20 AOR hit with &quot;Hey Hey&quot; (No. 15). The second new song &quot;Hammer of Love&quot; peaked at No. 23. The new tracks appeared on the compilation album, &quot;The &#x27;Original&#x27; Bad Co. Anthology&quot;, released in March 1999, which charted at No. 189.

With David Lee Roth as the opening act, the reunited original foursome went out in the spring and summer of 1999 for a 32-date reunion tour in the US, which began on 15 May 1999 at Ruth Eckerd Hall in Clearwater, Florida. The tour included a pay-per-view concert on 21 May at Hard Rock Live in Orlando and ended on 8 August at the Greek Theater in Los Angeles. The shows drew well, but after that, Ralphs announced he was retiring from live performing, and Burrell left again as well bringing the reunion to an end. The Greek Theater concert turned out to be the last show of the original four members. In 2014 on Bad Company&#x27;s 40th Anniversary DVD documentary, Kirke elaborates further on the end of the 1999 reunion, stating that he and Rodgers did not wish to continue on since he and Rodgers were sober and the other two were not.

Paul Rodgers again rejoined Kirke in 2001 for a tour that kicked off in the US and included co-headlining dates with Styx and Billy Squier as special guests. Dave Colwell and Rick Wills took over for the departed Ralphs and Burrell. The tour did decent business then moved to the UK.

The band secured some dates on the West Coast of the US in January 2002 to record a new live album and DVD, &quot;Merchants of Cool&quot;, recorded by Chris Mickle, Bud Martin and Justin Peacock, which featured the song &quot;Joe Fabulous&quot;, that hit No. 1 on radio and the top 20 on Mainstream Rock Radio in the US in its debut week. The &quot;Merchants of Cool&quot; tour in 2002 once again featured Kirke and Rodgers as the only original members left. Colwell again took lead guitar and Jaz Lochrie, who had played live and recorded with Paul Rodgers from 1995 on, was on bass. Guest performers at the shows included former Guns N&#x27; Roses guitarist Slash and Neal Schon of Journey fame. After the 2002 tour, Bad Company went inactive once again as Rodgers returned to his solo career.

In 2005, a DVD called &quot;Inside Bad Company 1974–1982&quot; was released that reviewed Bad Company on stage, on film, and on record. It also interviews Simon Kirke and had some live recordings from the 1970s and 1980s. This was an unauthorised release.

In 2006, a limited edition CD of 24 carat gold was released of the first Bad Company album (&quot;Bad Company&quot;). After taking over a year to find the original master tapes, the analogue masters were put through a proprietary analogue-to-digital converter that remastered the songs for the best possible sound.

Boz Burrell died of a heart attack on 21 September 2006, aged 60, at his home in Spain.

On 6 May 2007, Robert Hart, Dave &quot;Bucket&quot; Colwell and Jaz Lochrie performed in a small pub in Surbiton for The Macmillan Cancer Trust. Performing as Rock and Roll Fantasy, they offered a show of Bad Company songs for an audience of a few hundred. They were joined by Mick Ralphs. Chris Grainger was the drummer.

===Reunion years (2008–2023)===
In 2008, &quot;Mick Ralphs&#x27; Bad Company&quot; toured in the following formation: Robert Hart, Mick Ralphs, Dave &quot;Bucket&quot; Colwell, Jaz Lochrie, Gary &quot;Harry&quot; James.

On 2 July 2008, it was announced that the original remaining line-up of Bad Company would do a one-off gig at the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel &amp; Casino in Hollywood, Florida on 8 August 2008. For this show, the surviving three were joined by Howard Leese (guitar, formerly of Heart) and bassist Lynn Sorenson. According to Paul Rodgers, they did this gig to &quot;protect the legacy they have built and cement the rights to the trademark Bad Company for touring.&quot; The live performance was released on Blu-ray, DVD, and CD on 9 February 2010 and the tracks include 17 Bad Company hits. Rodgers dedicated &quot;Gone, Gone, Gone&quot; to original bassist Boz Burrell, who died in 2006.

Paul Rodgers, Mick Ralphs and Simon Kirke (again joined by Leese and Sorenson) performed together again during the summer of 2009, playing 10 shows throughout the United States. The band then played shows in the UK during April 2010 before embarking on tours through North America and Japan that lasted from July to October. Mick Ralphs was forced to pull out of the Japan dates, as he was undergoing hip replacement surgery. Leese handled lead guitar for the Japanese tour.

In March 2011, a budget live release &quot;Extended Versions&quot; was issued, taken from the band&#x27;s UK tour in 2010. The CD debuted at No. 139 on the Billboard 200 and featured 10 selections, peaking at No. 84 on the chart. This became the first Bad Company album to chart in 12 years.

In March 2012, it was announced that Bad Company would be performing a short run of European festival dates beginning 9 June at the Sweden Rock Festival in Sölvesborg. This would mark the first time in 37 years the band had performed in the European continent, outside the UK. However, it was announced in May that the German festival dates were cancelled but that the Sweden Rock Festival show was still on. 

In June 2012, Todd Ronning, from Rodgers&#x27; solo band, took over bass, playing alongside second guitarist Howard Leese, who was celebrating his fourth year with the band.

In March 2013, Bad Company and Lynyrd Skynyrd announced a joint 40th Anniversary Tour commemorating the 40th anniversary of Skynyrd&#x27;s first album release and Bad Company&#x27;s formation. On 10 June 2013,Bad Company appeared on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;, kicking off their commemorative tour throughout the United States and Canada. And in 2014, Bad Company once again announced a joint summer tour with Lynyrd Skynyrd.

Bad Company&#x27;s first two studio albums, &quot;Bad Company&quot; (1974) and &quot;Straight Shooter&quot; (1975), were re-released on CD, digital and vinyl on 7 April and 1 July 2015 respectively. The release encompassed the original albums newly remastered in 2015, alongside single b-sides, studio demos, interviews and previously unreleased songs from vault.

In March 2016, the group announced a US tour with Joe Walsh. Ralphs later announced that he would not be participating in this tour and that Rich Robinson of the Black Crowes would be standing in for him. In June 2016, the group announced a UK arena tour with special guests Richie Sambora and Orianthi, culminating in a show at London&#x27;s O2 arena on 29 October. Ralphs rejoined the band for the duration of the tour.

In 2017, Bad Company resumed touring with Rodgers, Kirke, Todd Ronning on bass and Howard Leese on lead guitar.

Bad Company once again teamed with Lynyrd Skynyrd for Skynyrd&#x27;s &quot;The Last of the Street Survivors Farewell Tour&quot;, which started on 4 May 2018 at the Coral Sky Amphitheater in Palm Beach, Florida and ran through the summer.

Former lead singer Brian Howe died 6 May 2020, aged 66.

Bad Company&#x27;s 2019 tour dates look to be their final ones as a band since Kirke stated in an interview on 30 November 2023 on the &quot;Bob Lefsetz Podcast&quot; that &quot;Bad Company&#x27;s days are pretty much over&quot;, citing Rodgers&#x27; recent health problems as a factor.

In 2025, Bad Company were nominated for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame for the first time.

<doc id="205162" wikidata="Q134509" url="?curid=205162" title="Port Said">
<text>Port Said (, , ) is a port city that lies in the northeast Egypt extending about along the coast of the Mediterranean Sea, straddling the west bank of the northern mouth of the Suez Canal. The city is the capital of the Port Said governorate and it forms the majority of the governorate, where its seven districts comprise seven of the governorate&#x27;s eight regions. At the beginning of 2023 it had a population of 680,375 people.

The city was established in 1859 during the building of the Suez Canal. There are numerous old houses with grand balconies on all floors, giving the city a distinctive look. Port Said&#x27;s twin city is Port Fuad, which lies on the eastern bank of the Suez Canal. The two cities coexist, to the extent that there is hardly any town centre in Port Fuad. The cities are connected by free ferries running all through the day, and together they form a metropolitan area with over a million residents that extends both on the African and the Asian sides of the Suez Canal. 

Port Said acted as a global city since its establishment and flourished particularly during the nineteenth and the first half of the twentieth century when it was inhabited by various nationalities and religions. Most of them were from Mediterranean countries, and they coexisted in tolerance, forming a community. Referring to this fact, Rudyard Kipling once said, &quot;If you truly wish to find someone you have known and who travels, there are two points on the globe you have but to sit and wait, sooner or later your man will come there: the docks of London and Port Said&quot;. Port Said is an important city in Egypt for trade and business, due to its location on the coastal region.

==Name==

The name of Port Said first appeared in 1855. It was chosen by an international committee composed of the UK, France, the Russian Empire, Austria, Spain and Piedmont. It is a compound name which composed of two parts: the French word port (marine harbour) and Said (the name of the ruler of Egypt at that time), who granted Ferdinand de Lesseps the concession to dig the Suez Canal. Urbanized residents pronounce the name or , while unurbanized residents pronounce it .

In Ancient Greek, the city was called ().

==History==
===Founding (1859) ===

Port Said was founded by Sa&#x27;id of Egypt on Easter Monday, April 25, 1859, when Ferdinand de Lesseps gave the first symbolic swing of the pickaxe to signal the beginning of construction. The first problem encountered was the difficulty for ships to drop anchor nearby. Luckily, a single rocky outcrop flush with the shoreline was discovered a few hundred meters away. Equipped with a wooden wharf, it served as a mooring berth for the boats. Soon after, a wooden jetty was built, connecting the departure islet, as it quickly became known, to the beach. This rock could be considered the heart of the developing city, and it was on this highly symbolic site, forty years later, that a monument to de Lesseps was erected.

There were no local resources here. Everything Port Said needed had to be imported: wood, stone, supplies, machinery, equipment, housing, food and even water. Giant water storage containers were erected to supply fresh water until the Sweet Water Canal could be completed. One of the most pressing problems was the lack of stone. Early buildings were often imported in kit form and made great use of wood. A newly developed technique was used to construct the jetties called conglomerate concrete or &quot;Beton Coignet&quot;, which was named after its inventor François Coignet. Blocks of concrete were sunk into the sea to be the foundations of the jetties. Still more innovative was the use of the same concrete for the lighthouse of Port Said, the only original building still standing in Port Said.
In 1859 the first 150 laborers camped in tents around a wooden shed. A year later, the number of inhabitants had risen to 2000 — with the European contingent housed in wooden bungalows imported from northern Europe. By 1869, when the canal opened, the permanent population had reached 10,000. The European district, clustered around the waterfront, was separated from the Arab district, Gemalia, to the west, by a wide strip of sandy beach where a tongue of Lake Manzala reached towards the sea. This inlet soon dried out and was replaced by buildings; over time there was no division between the European and Arab quarters.

Since its establishment, Port Said played a significant role in Egyptian history. The British entered Egypt through the city in 1882, starting their occupation of Egypt. 

===Thriving international port and city (1902–1945) ===
At the start of the twentieth century, two things happened to change Port Said: in 1902, Egyptian cotton from Mataria started to be exported via Port Said; and in 1904 a standard gauge railway opened to Cairo. The result was to attract a large commercial community and to raise its social status. In particular a sizable Greek community grew up. In 1907, the quickly growing city had about 50,000 inhabitants, among whom were 11,000 Europeans &quot;of all nations&quot;. During the First World War, Port Said became home to an important Allied hospital. Due to the strategic location of Port Said intersecting Europe, Africa and Asia, thousands of men were sent to this hospital. This included soldiers wounded as a result from the Gallipoli campaign in 1915. Following the end of the World War I, the directors of the Suez Canal Company decided to create a new city on the Asian bank, building 300 houses for its labourers and functionaries. Port Fouad was designed by the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris. The houses follow the French model. The new city was founded in December 1926.

Since its foundation people of all nationalities and religions had been moving to the city and each community brought in its own customs, cuisine, religion and architecture. By the late 1920s the population numbered over 100,000 people. In the 1930s for example there were elegant public buildings designed by Italian architects. The old Arab Quarter was swallowed up into the thriving city. Port Said by now was a thriving, bustling international port with a multi-national population: Jewish merchants, Egyptian shopkeepers, Greek photographers, Italian architects, Swiss hoteliers, Maltese administrators, Scottish engineers, French bankers and diplomats from all around the world. All lived and worked alongside the large local Egyptian community. And always passing through were international travelers to and from Africa, India and the Far East. Intermarriage between French, Italian and Maltese was particularly common, resulting in a local Latin and Catholic community like those of Alexandria and Cairo. French was the common language of the European and non-Arab population, and often the first language of children born to parents from different communities. Italian was also widely spoken and was the mother tongue of part of the Maltese community, since the ancestors of the latter had come to Egypt before the Anglicization of Malta in the 1920s. Multilingualism was a characteristic of the foreign population of Port Said, with most people continuing to speak community languages as well as the common French.

In 1936 a treaty was signed between the United Kingdom and the Kingdom of Egypt called the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936. It stipulated the British pledge to withdraw all their troops from Egypt, except those necessary to protect the Suez Canal and its surroundings. 

=== Revolution, end of British occupation (1946–present) ===
Following World War II, Egypt denounced the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936, leading to skirmishes with British troops guarding the Suez Canal in 1951.

The Egyptian Revolution of 1952 occurred. Then on 26 July 1956, President Gamal Abdel Nasser nationalised the Suez Canal Company. The nationalisation escalated tensions with Britain and France, who colluded with Israel to invade Egypt, the invasion known in Egypt as the tripartite aggression or the Suez Crisis. On 6 November 1956, British troops violently landed in Port Said while firing on the Egyptian military. Port Said next was bombed by the British, to terrorise the civilians, of whom hundreds died. There was also heavy fighting in the streets with again many civilian casualties, and the resulting fires destroyed much of the city.

The withdrawal of the last soldier of foreign troops was on 23 December 1956. Since then, this day was chosen as Port Said&#x27;s national day. It is widely celebrated annually in Port Said.
