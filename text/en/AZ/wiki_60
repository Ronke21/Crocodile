<text>William Frederick &quot;Bull&quot; Halsey Jr. (30 October 1882 – 16 August 1959) was an American Navy admiral during World War II. He is one of four officers to have attained the rank of five-star fleet admiral of the United States Navy, the others being William Leahy, Ernest J. King, and Chester W. Nimitz.

Born in Elizabeth, New Jersey, Halsey graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1904. He served in the Great White Fleet and, during World War I, commanded the destroyer . He took command of the aircraft carrier in 1935 after completing a course in naval aviation, and was promoted to the rank of rear admiral in 1938. At the start of the War in the Pacific (1941–1945), Halsey commanded the task force centered on the carrier in a series of raids against Japanese-held targets.

Halsey was made commander of the South Pacific Area, and led the Allied forces over the course of the Battle for Guadalcanal (1942–1943) and the fighting up the Solomon chain (1942–1945). In 1943 he was made commander of the Third Fleet, the post he held through the rest of the war. He took part in the Battle of Leyte Gulf, the largest naval battle of the Second World War and, by some criteria, the largest naval battle in history. He was promoted to fleet admiral in December 1945 and retired from active service in March 1947.

==Early life==
Halsey was born in Elizabeth, New Jersey, on 30 October 1882, the son of Anna Masters (Brewster) and United States Navy Captain William F. Halsey. 

Halsey was of English ancestry. All of his ancestors came to America from England and all of them emigrated from England to New England in the early 1600s. He felt a &quot;kinship&quot; with his ancestors, including Captain John Halsey of colonial Massachusetts who served in the Royal Navy in Queen Anne&#x27;s War from 1702 to 1713 where he raided French shipping. Through his father he was a descendant of Senator Rufus King, who was an American lawyer, politician, diplomat, and Federalist. Halsey attended the Pingry School.

After waiting two years to receive an appointment to the United States Naval Academy, Halsey decided to study medicine at the University of Virginia and then join the Navy as a physician. He chose Virginia because his best friend, Karl Osterhause, was there. While there, Halsey joined the Delta Psi fraternity and was also a member of the secretive Seven Society. After his first year, Halsey received his appointment to the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, and entered the academy in the fall of 1900. While attending the academy he lettered in football as a fullback and earned several athletic honors. For some time while at the academy his roommate was Capt. William Alexander Ancrum. Halsey graduated from the Naval Academy on 2 February 1904.

Following graduation he spent his early service years in battleships, and sailed with the main battle fleet aboard the battleship as Roosevelt&#x27;s Great White Fleet circumnavigated the globe from 1907 to 1909. Halsey was on the bridge of the battleship on Wednesday, 13 April 1904, when a flareback from the port gun in her aft turret ignited a powder charge and set off two others. No explosion occurred, but the rapid burning of the powder burnt and suffocated to death 31 officers and enlisted sailors. This resulted in Halsey dreading the 13th of every month, especially when it fell on a Wednesday.

After his service on &quot;Missouri&quot;, Halsey served aboard torpedo boats, beginning with in 1909. Halsey was one of the few officers who was promoted directly from ensign to full lieutenant, skipping the rank of lieutenant (junior grade). Torpedoes and torpedo boats became specialties of his, and he commanded the First Group of the Atlantic Fleet&#x27;s Torpedo Flotilla in 1912 through 1913. Halsey commanded a number of torpedo boats and destroyers during the 1910s and 1920s. At that time, the destroyer and the torpedo boat, through extremely hazardous delivery methods, were the most effective way to bring the torpedo into combat against capital ships. Then-Lieutenant Commander Halsey&#x27;s World War I service, including command of in 1918, earned him the Navy Cross.

== Interwar years ==
In October 1922, he was the Naval Attaché at the American Embassy in Berlin, Germany. One year later, he was given additional duty as naval attaché at the American Embassies in Christiania, Norway; Copenhagen, Denmark; and Stockholm, Sweden. He then returned to sea duty, again in destroyers in European waters, in command of and . Upon his return to the U.S. in 1927, he served one year as executive officer of the battleship , and then for three years in command of , the station ship at the Naval Academy. Then-Captain Halsey continued his destroyer duty on his next two-year stint at sea, starting in 1930 as the Commander of Destroyer Division Three of the Scouting Force, before returning to study at the Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island.

In 1934, the chief of the Bureau of Aeronautics, Navy Rear Admiral Ernest King, offered Halsey command of the aircraft carrier , subject to completion of the course of an air observer. Halsey elected to enroll as a cadet for the full 12-week Naval Aviator course rather than the simpler Naval Aviation Observer program. &quot;I thought it better to be able to fly the aircraft itself than to just sit back and be at the mercy of the pilot&quot;, said Halsey at the time. Halsey earned his Naval Aviator&#x27;s Wings on 15 May 1935, at the age of 52, the oldest person to do so in the history of the U.S. Navy. While he had approval from his wife to train as an observer, she learned from a letter after the fact that he had changed to pilot training, and she told her daughter, &quot;What do you think the old fool is doing now? He&#x27;s learning to fly!&quot; He went on to command the USS &quot;Saratoga&quot;, and later the Naval Air Station Pensacola at Pensacola, Florida. Halsey considered airpower an important part of the future navy, commenting, &quot;The naval officer in the next war had better know his aviation, and good&quot;. Halsey was promoted to rear admiral in 1938. During this time he commanded carrier divisions and served as the overall commander of the Aircraft Battle Force.

==World War II==
Traditional naval doctrine envisioned naval combat fought between opposing battleship gun lines. This view was challenged when Army Air Corps Colonel Billy Mitchell demonstrated the capability of aircraft to substantially damage and sink even the most heavily armored naval vessel. In the interwar debate that followed, some saw the carrier as defensive in nature, providing air cover to protect the battle group from shore-based aircraft. Carrier-based aircraft were lighter in design and had not been shown to be as lethal. The adage &quot;Capital ships cannot withstand land-based air power&quot; was well known. Aviation proponents, however, imagined bringing the fight to the enemy with the use of air power. Halsey was a firm believer in the aircraft carrier as the primary naval offensive weapon system. When he testified at Admiral Husband Kimmel&#x27;s hearing after the Pearl Harbor debacle he summed up American carrier tactics being to &quot;get to the other fellow with everything you have as fast as you can and to dump it on him&quot;. Halsey testified he would never hesitate to use the carrier as an offensive weapon.

In April 1940, Halsey&#x27;s ships, as part of Battle Fleet, moved to Hawaii and in June 1940, he was promoted to vice admiral (temporary rank), and was appointed commander Carrier Division 2 and commander Aircraft Battle Force.

With tensions high and war imminent, U.S. Naval intelligence indicated Wake Island would be the target of a Japanese surprise attack. In response, on 28 November 1941 Admiral Kimmel ordered Halsey to take to ferry aircraft to Wake Island to reinforce the Marines there. Kimmel had given Halsey &quot;a free hand&quot; to attack and destroy any Japanese military forces encountered. The planes flew off her deck on 2 December. Highly anxious of being spotted and then jumped by the Japanese carrier force, Halsey gave orders to &quot;sink any shipping sighted, shoot down any plane encountered&quot;. His operations officer protested, &quot;Goddammit, Admiral, you can&#x27;t start a private war of your own! Who&#x27;s going to take the responsibility?&quot; Halsey replied, &quot;I&#x27;ll take it! If anything gets in my way, we&#x27;ll shoot first and argue afterwards&quot;.

A storm delayed &quot;Enterprise&quot; on her return voyage to Hawaii. Instead of returning on 6 December as planned, she was still out at sea, when she received word that the surprise attack anticipated was not at Wake Island, but at Pearl Harbor itself. News of the attack came in the form of overhearing desperate radio transmissions from one of her aircraft sent forward to Pearl Harbor, attempting to identify itself as American. The plane was shot down, and her pilot and crew were lost. In the immediate wake of the attack upon Pearl Harbor, Admiral Kimmel named Halsey &quot;commander of all the ships at sea&quot;. &quot;Enterprise&quot; searched south and west of the Hawaiian Islands for the Japanese attackers, but did not locate the six Japanese fleet carriers then retiring to the north and west.

===Early Pacific carrier raids===
Halsey and &quot;Enterprise&quot; slipped back into Pearl Harbor on the evening of 8 December. Surveying the wreckage of the Pacific Fleet, he remarked, &quot;Before we&#x27;re through with them, the Japanese language will be spoken only in Hell&quot;. Halsey was an aggressive commander. Above all else, he was an energetic and demanding leader. In the early months of the war, as the nation was rocked by the fall of one western bastion after another, Halsey looked to take the fight to the enemy. Serving as commander, Carrier Division 2, aboard his flagship &quot;Enterprise&quot;, Halsey led a series of hit-and-run raids against the Japanese, striking the Gilbert and Marshall islands in February, Wake Island in March, and carrying out the Doolittle Raid in April 1942 against the Japanese capital Tokyo and other places on Japan&#x27;s largest and most populous island Honshu, the first air raid to strike the Japanese Home Islands, providing an important boost to American morale. Halsey&#x27;s slogan, &quot;Hit hard, hit fast, hit often&quot;, soon became a byword for the Navy.

Halsey returned to Pearl Harbor from his last raid on 26 May 1942, in poor health due to the extremely serious and stressful conditions at hand. He had spent nearly all of the previous six months on the bridge of the carrier &quot;Enterprise,&quot; directing the Navy&#x27;s counterstrikes. Psoriasis covered a great deal of his body and caused unbearable itching, making it nearly impossible for him to sleep. Gaunt and having lost , he was medically ordered to the hospital in Hawaii and was successfully treated.

Meanwhile, U.S. Naval intelligence had strongly ascertained that the Japanese were planning an attack on the central Pacific island of Midway. Admiral Chester Nimitz, Commander-in-Chief, U.S. Pacific Fleet, determined to take the opportunity to engage them. Losing Midway would have been a very serious threat because the Japanese then could easily take Hawaii and threaten the west coast of the United States. The loss of his most aggressive and combat experienced carrier admiral, Halsey, on the eve of this crisis was a severe blow to Nimitz. Nimitz met with Halsey, who recommended his cruiser division commander, Rear Admiral Raymond Spruance, to take command for the upcoming Midway operation. Nimitz considered the move, but it would mean stepping over Rear Admiral Frank Fletcher of Task Force 17, who was the senior of the two men. After interviewing Fletcher and reviewing his reports from the Coral Sea engagement, Nimitz was convinced that Fletcher&#x27;s performance was sound, and he was given the responsibility of command in the defense of Midway. Acting upon Halsey&#x27;s recommendations, Nimitz then made Rear Admiral Spruance commander of Halsey&#x27;s Task Force 16, comprising the carriers &quot;Enterprise&quot; and &quot;Hornet&quot;. To aid Spruance, who had no experience as the commander of a carrier force, Halsey sent along his irascible chief of staff, Captain Miles Browning.

Halsey&#x27;s skin condition was so serious that he was sent on the light cruiser to San Francisco, where he was met by a leading allergist for specialized treatment. The skin condition soon receded but Halsey was ordered to stand down for the next six weeks and relax. While detached stateside during his convalescence, he visited family and traveled to Washington D.C. In late August, he accepted a speaking engagement at the U.S. Naval Academy at Annapolis. Prior to the discussion of his raids against the Japanese positions in the Marshall Islands, Halsey informed the midshipmen before him, &quot;Missing the Battle of Midway has been the greatest disappointment of my career, but I am going back to the Pacific where I intend personally to have a crack at those yellow-bellied sons of bitches and their carriers&quot;, which was received with loud applause.

At the completion of his convalescence in September 1942, Admiral Nimitz reassigned Halsey to Commander, Air Force, Pacific Fleet.

===Commander, South Pacific Area===

After being medically approved to return to duty, Halsey was named to command a carrier task force in the South Pacific Area. Since &quot;Enterprise&quot; was still laid up in Pearl Harbor undergoing repairs following the Battle of the Eastern Solomons, and the other ships of Task Force 16 were still being readied, he began a familiarization trip to the south Pacific on 15 October 1942, arriving at area headquarters at Nouméa in New Caledonia on 18 October. The Guadalcanal campaign was at a critical juncture, with the 1st Marine Division, 11,000 men, under the command of Marine Major General Alexander Vandegrift holding on by a thread around Henderson Field. The Marines did receive additional support from the U.S. Army&#x27;s 164th Infantry Regiment with a complement of 2,800 soldiers on 13 October. This addition only helped to fill some of the serious holes and was insufficient to sustain the battle of itself.

During this critical juncture, naval support was tenuous due to Vice Admiral Robert L. Ghormley&#x27;s reticence, malaise and lackluster performance. Pacific Fleet commander Chester Nimitz had concluded that Ghormley had become dispirited and exhausted. Nimitz made his decision to change the South Pacific Area commander while Halsey was en route. As Halsey&#x27;s aircraft came to rest in Nouméa, a whaleboat came alongside carrying Ghormley&#x27;s flag lieutenant. Meeting him before he could board the flagship, the lieutenant handed over a sealed envelope containing a message from Nimitz: &quot;You will take command of the South Pacific Area and South Pacific forces immediately&quot;.

The order came as an awkward surprise to Halsey. Ghormley was a long time personal friend, and had been since their days as teammates on the football team back at Annapolis. Awkward or not, the two men carried out their directives. Halsey&#x27;s command now included all ground, sea, and air forces in the South Pacific area. News of the change flashed and produced an immediate boost to morale with the beleaguered Marines, energizing his command. He was widely considered the U.S. Navy&#x27;s most aggressive admiral, and with good reason. He set about assessing the situation to determine what actions were needed. Ghormley had been unsure of his command&#x27;s ability to maintain the Marine toehold on Guadalcanal, and had been mindful of leaving them trapped there for a repeat of the Bataan Peninsula disaster. Halsey punctiliously made it clear he did not plan to withdraw the Marines. He not only intended to counter the Japanese efforts to dislodge them, he intended to secure the island. Above all else, he wanted to regain the initiative and take the fight to the Japanese. It was two days after Halsey had taken command in October 1942 that he gave an order that all naval officers in the South Pacific would dispense with wearing neckties with their tropical uniforms. As Richard Frank commented in his account of the Battle for Guadalcanal:
Halsey led the South Pacific command through what was for the U.S. Navy the most tenuous phase of the war. Halsey committed his limited naval forces through a series of naval battles around Guadalcanal, including the carrier engagements of the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands and the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal. These engagements checked the Japanese advance and drained their naval forces of carrier aircraft and pilots.

For his conduct, &quot;can-do&quot; leadership style, and increasing number of forces under his command, Halsey was promoted to four-star admiral in October 1942. The promotion put Halsey into sustained public spotlight for the first time, appearing on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s November 1942 issue which quoted Halsey from his superior Nimitz as &quot;professionally competent and militarily aggressive without being recklessly foolhardy&quot; and that his promotion by the President was something &quot;he richly deserves&quot;. Halsey&#x27;s four-star insignia were welded together from two-star rear admiral&#x27;s insignia; his vice admiral&#x27;s stars were sent to the widows of Rear Admirals Daniel J. Callaghan and Norman Scott, both of whom had been killed in action.
In November, Halsey&#x27;s willingness to place at risk his command&#x27;s two fast battleships in the confined waters around Guadalcanal for a night engagement paid off, with the U.S. Navy winning the battle. The last naval engagement of the Guadalcanal campaign was decisive, dooming the Japanese garrison and enabling U.S. forces to finally wrest control of the island from the Japanese.

Japanese naval aviation proved to be formidable during the Solomon campaign. In April 1943, Halsey assigned Rear Admiral Marc Mitscher to become Commander Air, Solomon Islands, where he directed a mixed bag of army, navy, marine and New Zealand aircraft in the airwar over Guadalcanal and up the Solomons chain. Said Halsey: &quot;I knew we&#x27;d probably catch hell from the Japs in the air. That&#x27;s why I sent Pete Mitscher up there. Pete was a fighting fool and I knew it&quot;.

Typical for the period was an exchange that occurred between Halsey and one of his staff officers in June 1943. The South Pacific Area was expecting the arrival of an additional air group to support their next offensive. As a part of the long view of winning the war taken by Nimitz, upon its arrival at Fiji the group was given new orders to return stateside and be broken up, its pilots to be used as instructors for pilot training. Halsey&#x27;s headquarters had been counting on the air group for their operations up the Solomons chain. The staff officer who brought the dispatch to Halsey remarked &quot;If they do that to us we will have to go on the defensive&quot;. The admiral turned to the speaker and replied: &quot;As long as I have one plane and one pilot, I will stay on the offensive&quot;.

Halsey&#x27;s forces spent the rest of the year battling up the Solomon Islands chain to Bougainville. At Bougainville the Japanese had two airfields in the southern tip of the island, and another at the northernmost peninsula, with a fourth on Buki just across the northern passage. Here, instead of landing near the Japanese airfields and taking them away against the bulk of the Japanese defenders, Halsey landed his invasion force of 14,000 Marines in Empress Augusta Bay, about halfway up the west coast of Bougainville. There he had the Seabees clear and build their own airfield. Two days after the landing, a large cruiser force was sent down from Japan to Rabaul in preparation for a night engagement against Halsey&#x27;s screening force and supply ships in Empress Augusta Bay. The Japanese had been conserving their naval forces over the past year, but now committed a force of seven heavy cruisers, along with one light cruiser and four destroyers. At Rabaul the force refueled in preparation for the coming night battle. Halsey had no surface forces anywhere near equivalent strength to oppose them. Battleships , , and assorted cruisers had been transferred to the Central Pacific to support the upcoming invasion of Tarawa. Other than the destroyer screen, the only force Halsey had available were the carrier air groups on and .

Rabaul was a heavily fortified port, with five airfields and extensive anti-aircraft batteries. Other than the surprise raid at Pearl Harbor, no mission against such a target had ever been accomplished with carrier aircraft. It was highly dangerous to the aircrews, and to the carriers as well. With the landing in the balance, Halsey sent his two carriers to steam north through the night to get into range of Rabaul, then launch a daybreak raid on the base. Aircraft from recently captured Vella Lavella were sent over to provide a combat air patrol over the carriers. All available aircraft from the two carriers were committed to the raid itself. The mission was a stunning success, so damaging the cruiser force at Rabaul as to make them no longer a threat. Aircraft losses in the raid were light. Halsey later described the threat to the landings as &quot;the most desperate emergency that confronted me in my entire term as ComSoPac&quot;.

Following the successful Bougainville operation, he then isolated and neutralized the Japanese naval stronghold at Rabaul by capturing surrounding positions in the Bismarck Archipelago in a series of amphibious landings known as Operation Cartwheel. This enabled the continuation of the drive north without the heavy fighting that would have been necessary to capture the base itself. With the neutralization of Rabaul, major operations in the South Pacific Area came to a close. With his determination and grit, Halsey had bolstered his command&#x27;s resolve and seized the initiative from the Japanese until ships, aircraft and crews produced and trained in the States could arrive in 1943 and 1944 to tip the scales of the war in favor of the allies.

===Battles of the Central Pacific===
As the war progressed it moved out of the South Pacific and into the Central Pacific. Halsey&#x27;s command shifted with it, and in May 1944 he was promoted to commanding officer of the newly formed Third Fleet. He commanded actions from the Philippines to Japan. From September 1944 to January 1945, he led the campaigns to take the Palaus, Leyte and Luzon, and on many raids on Japanese bases, including off the shores of Formosa, China, and Vietnam.

By this point in the conflict the U.S. Navy was doing things the Japanese high command had not thought possible. The Fast Carrier Task Force was able to bring to battle enough air power to overpower land based aircraft and dominate whatever area the fleet was operating in. Moreover, the Navy&#x27;s ability to establish forward operating ports as they did at Majuro, Enewetak and Ulithi, and their ability to convoy supplies out to the combat task forces, allowed the fleet to operate for extended periods of time far out to sea in the central and western Pacific. The Japanese Navy conserved itself in port and would sortie in force to engage the enemy. The U.S. Navy remained at sea and on station, dominating whatever region it entered. The size of the Pacific Ocean, which Japanese planners had thought would limit the U.S. Navy&#x27;s ability to operate in the western Pacific, would not be adequate to protect Japan.

Command of the &quot;big blue fleet&quot; was alternated with Raymond Spruance. Under Spruance the fleet designation was the Fifth Fleet and the Fast Carrier Task Force was designated &quot;Task Force 58&quot;. Under Halsey the fleet was designated Third Fleet and the Fast Carrier Task Force was designated &quot;Task Force 38&quot;. The split command structure was intended to confuse the Japanese and created a higher tempo of operations. While Spruance was at sea operating the fleet, Halsey and his staff, self-dubbed the &quot;Department of Dirty Tricks&quot;, would be planning the next series of operations. The two admirals were a contrast in styles. Halsey was aggressive and a risk taker. Spruance was calculating, professional, and cautious. Most higher-ranking officers preferred to serve under Spruance; most common sailors were proud to serve under Halsey.

====Leyte Gulf====
In October 1944, amphibious forces of the U.S. Seventh Fleet carried out General Douglas MacArthur&#x27;s major landings on the island of Leyte in the Central Philippines. Halsey&#x27;s Third Fleet was assigned to cover and support Seventh Fleet operations around Leyte. Halsey&#x27;s plans assumed the Japanese fleet or a major portion of it would challenge the effort, creating an opportunity to engage it decisively. Halsey directed that the Third Fleet &quot;will seek the enemy and attempt to bring about a decisive engagement if he undertakes operations beyond support of superior land based air forces&quot;.

In response to the invasion, the Japanese launched their final major naval effort, an operation known as &#x27;Sho-Go&#x27;, involving almost all their surviving fleet. It was aimed at destroying the invasion shipping in Leyte Gulf. The Northern Force of Admiral Jisaburō Ozawa was built around the remaining Japanese aircraft carriers, now weakened by the heavy loss of trained pilots. The Northern Force was meant to lure the covering U.S. forces away from the Gulf while two surface battle-groups, the Center Force and the Southern Force, were to break through to the beachhead and attack the invasion shipping. These forces were built around the remaining strength of the Japanese Navy, and comprised a total of 7 battleships and 16 cruisers. The operation brought about the Battle for Leyte Gulf, the largest naval battle of the Second World War and, by some criteria, the largest naval battle in history.

On 23 October, the Center Force commanded by Vice Admiral Takeo Kurita was located coming through the Palawan Passage by two American submarines, which attacked the force, sinking two heavy cruisers and damaging a third. The following day, Third Fleet&#x27;s aircraft carriers launched strikes against Kurita&#x27;s Center Force, sinking the battleship and damaging the heavy cruiser , causing the force to turn westward back towards its base. Kurita appeared to be retiring but he later reversed course and headed back into the San Bernardino Strait. At this point, Ozawa&#x27;s Northern Force was located by Third Fleet scout aircraft. Halsey made the momentous decision to take all available strength northwards to destroy the Japanese carrier forces, planning to strike them at dawn of 25 October. He considered leaving a battle group behind to guard the strait, and made tentative plans to do so, but he felt he would also have to leave one of his three carrier groups to provide air cover, weakening his chance to crush the remaining Japanese carrier forces. The entire Third Fleet steamed northward. San Bernardino Strait was effectively left unguarded by any major surface fleet.

====Battle off Samar====

In moving Third Fleet northwards, Halsey failed to advise Admiral Thomas Kinkaid of Seventh Fleet of his decision. Seventh Fleet intercepts of organizational messages from Halsey to his own task group commanders seemed to indicate that Halsey had formed a task force and detached it to protect the San Bernardino Strait, but this was not the case. Kinkaid and his staff failed to confirm this with Halsey, and neither had confirmed this with Nimitz.

Despite aerial reconnaissance reports on the night of 24–25 October of Kurita&#x27;s Center Force in the San Bernardino Strait, Halsey continued to take Third Fleet northwards, away from Leyte Gulf.

When Kurita&#x27;s Center Force emerged from the San Bernardino Strait on the morning of 25 October, there was nothing to oppose them except a small force of escort carriers and screening destroyers and destroyer escorts, Task Unit 77.4.3 &quot;Taffy 3&quot;, which had been tasked and armed to attack troops on land and guard against submarines, not oppose the largest enemy surface fleet since the battle of Midway, led by the largest battleship in the world. Advancing down the coast of the island of Samar towards the troop transports and support ships of the Leyte Gulf landing, they took Seventh Fleet&#x27;s escort carriers and their screening ships entirely by surprise.

In the desperate Battle off Samar which followed, Kurita&#x27;s ships destroyed one of the escort carriers and three ships of the carriers&#x27; screen, and damaged a number of other ships as well. The remarkable resistance of the screening ships of Taffy 3 against Kurita&#x27;s battle-group remains one of the most heroic feats in the history of the U.S. Navy. Their efforts and those of the several hundred aircraft that the escort carriers could put up, many of whom, however could not be armed with the most effective ordnance to deal with heavy surface ships in time, took a heavy toll on Kurita&#x27;s ships and convinced him that he was facing a stronger force than was the case. Mistaking the escort carriers for Halsey&#x27;s fleet carriers, and fearing entrapment from the six battleships of the Third Fleet battleship group, he decided to withdraw back through the San Bernardino Strait and to the west without achieving his objective of disrupting the Leyte landing.

When the Seventh Fleet&#x27;s escort carriers found themselves under attack from the Center Force, Halsey began to receive a succession of desperate calls from Kinkaid asking for immediate assistance off Samar. For over two hours Halsey turned a deaf ear to these calls. Then, shortly after 10:00 hours, a message was received from Admiral Nimitz: &quot;Where is repeat where is Task Force 34? The world wonders&quot;. The tail end of this message, The world wonders, was intended as padding designed to confuse enemy decoders, but was mistakenly left in the message when it was handed to Halsey. The urgent inquiry had seemingly become a stinging rebuke. The fiery Halsey threw his hat on the deck of the bridge and began cursing. Finally Halsey&#x27;s Chief of Staff, Rear Admiral Robert &quot;Mick&quot; Carney, confronted him, telling Halsey &quot;Stop it! What the hell&#x27;s the matter with you? Pull yourself together&quot;.

Halsey cooled but continued to steam Third Fleet northward to close on Ozawa&#x27;s Northern Force for a full hour after receiving the signal from Nimitz. Then, Halsey ordered Task Force 34 south. As Task Force 34 proceeded south they were further delayed when the battle force had to slow to 12 knots so that the battleships could refuel their escorting destroyers. The refueling cost a two and a half-hour further delay. By the time Task Force 34 arrived at the scene it was too late to assist the Seventh Fleet&#x27;s escort carrier groups. Kurita had already decided to retire and had left the area. A single straggling destroyer was caught by Halsey&#x27;s advance cruisers and destroyers, but the rest of Kurita&#x27;s force was able to escape.

Meanwhile, the major part of Third Fleet continued to close on Ozawa&#x27;s Northern Force, which included one fleet carrier (the last surviving Japanese carrier of the six that had attacked Pearl Harbor) and three light carriers. The Battle off Cape Engaño resulted in Halsey&#x27;s Third Fleet sinking all four of Ozawa&#x27;s carriers.

The same attributes that made Halsey an invaluable leader in the desperate early months of the war, his desire to bring the fight to the enemy, his willingness to take on a gamble, worked against him in the later stages of the war. Halsey received much criticism for his decisions during the battle, with naval historian Samuel Morison terming the Third Fleet run to the north &quot;Halsey&#x27;s Blunder&quot;. However, the destruction of the Japanese carriers had been an important goal up to that point, and the Leyte landings were still successful despite Halsey falling for the Japanese Navy&#x27;s decoy.

=== Halsey&#x27;s Typhoon ===


After the Leyte Gulf engagement, December found the Third Fleet confronted with another powerful enemy in the form of Typhoon Cobra, which was dubbed &quot;Halsey&#x27;s Typhoon&quot; by many.

While conducting operations off the Philippines, the fleet had to discontinue refueling due to a Pacific storm. Rather than move Third Fleet away, Halsey chose to remain on station for another day. In fairness, he received conflicting information from Pearl Harbor and his own staff. The Hawaiian weathermen predicted a northerly path for the storm, which would have cleared Task Force 38 by some . Eventually his own staff provided a prediction regarding the direction of the storm that was far closer to the mark with a westerly direction.

However, Halsey played the odds, declining to cancel planned operations and requiring the ships of Third Fleet to hold formation. On the evening of 17 December, Third Fleet was unable to land its combat air patrol due to the pitching and rolling decks of the carriers. All the aircraft were ditched in the ocean and lost, but the pilots were all saved by accompanying destroyers. By 10:00 a.m. the next morning the barometer on the flagship was noted to be dropping precipitously. With increasingly heavy seas the fleet still attempted to maintain stations. The threat was greatest to the fleet&#x27;s destroyers, which did not have the fuel reserves of the larger ships and were running dangerously low. Finally, at 11:49 am, Halsey issued the order for the ships of the fleet to take the most comfortable course available to them. Many of the smaller ships had already been forced to do so.

Between 11:00 a.m. and 2:00 pm, the typhoon did its worst damage, tossing the ships in waves. The barometer continued to drop and the wind roared at with gusts well over . At 1:45 pm. Halsey issued a typhoon warning to Fleet Weather Central. By this time Third Fleet had lost three of its destroyers. By the time the storm had cleared the next day a great many ships in the fleet had been damaged, three destroyers were sunk, 146 aircraft were destroyed and 802 seamen had been lost. For the next three days Third Fleet conducted search and rescue operations, finally retiring to Ulithi on 22 December 1944.

Following the typhoon a Navy court of inquiry was convened on board in the Naval Base Ulithi. Admiral Nimitz, CINCPAC, was in attendance at the court, Vice Admiral John H. Hoover presided over the Court, with admirals George D. Murray and Glenn B. Davis as associate judges. Forty-three-year-old Captain Herbert K. Gates, of &quot;Cascade&quot;, was the Judge Advocate. The inquiry found that though Halsey had committed an error of judgement in sailing the Third Fleet into the heart of the typhoon, it stopped short of unambiguously recommending sanction. The events surrounding Typhoon Cobra were similar to those the Japanese navy had faced some nine years earlier in what they termed &quot;The Fourth Fleet Incident&quot;.

===End of the war===

During January 1945 the Third Fleet attacked Formosa and Luzon, and raided the South China Sea in support of the landing of U.S. Army forces on Luzon. At the conclusion of this operation, Halsey passed command of the ships that made up Third Fleet to Admiral Spruance on 26 January, whereupon its designation changed to Fifth Fleet. Returning home Halsey was asked about General MacArthur, who was not the easiest man to work with, and vied with the Navy over the conduct and management of the war in the Pacific. Halsey had worked well with MacArthur and did not mind saying so. When a reporter asked Halsey if he thought MacArthur&#x27;s fleet (7th Fleet) would get to Tokyo first, the admiral grinned and answered &quot;We&#x27;re going there together&quot;. Then seriously he added &quot;He&#x27;s a very fine man. I have worked under him for over two years and have the greatest admiration and respect for him&quot;.

Spruance held command of Fifth Fleet until May, when command returned to Halsey. In early June 1945 the Third Fleet again sailed through the path of a typhoon, Typhoon Connie. On this occasion, six men were swept overboard and lost, along with 75 airplanes lost or destroyed, with another 70 badly damaged. Though some ships sustained significant damage, none were lost. A Navy court of inquiry was again convened, this time recommending that Halsey be reassigned, but Admiral Nimitz declined to abide by this recommendation, citing Halsey&#x27;s prior service record, despite that record including a previous instance of negligently sailing his fleet through a typhoon.

Halsey led Third Fleet through the final stages of the war, striking targets on the Japanese homeland itself. Third Fleet aircraft conducted attacks upon Tokyo, the naval base at Kure and the northern Japanese island of Hokkaidō, and Third Fleet battleships engaged in the bombardment of a number of Japanese coastal cities in preparation for an invasion of Japan, which ultimately never had to be undertaken.

After the cessation of hostilities, Halsey, still aggressively cautious of Japanese kamikaze attacks, ordered Third Fleet to maintain a protective air cover with the following communiqué: 
He was present when Japan formally surrendered on the deck of his flagship, , on 2 September 1945.

==Postwar years==

Immediately after the surrender of Japan, 54 ships of the Third Fleet returned to the United States, with Halsey&#x27;s four-star flag flying from USS &quot;South Dakota&quot;, for the annual Navy Day Celebrations in San Francisco on 27 October 1945. He hauled down his flag on 22 November 1945, and was assigned special duty in the Office of the Secretary of the Navy. On 11 December 1945, he took the oath as Fleet Admiral, becoming the fourth and still the most recent naval officer awarded that rank. Halsey made a goodwill flying trip, passing by Central and South America, covering nearly and 11 nations. He retired from active service in March 1947, but as a Fleet Admiral, he was not taken off active duty status.

Halsey was asked about the weapons used to win the war and he answered:
Halsey joined the New Jersey Society of the Sons of the American Revolution in 1946. Upon retirement, he joined the board of two subsidiaries of the International Telephone and Telegraph Company, including the American Cable and Radio Corporation, and served until 1957. He maintained an office near the top of the ITT Building at 67 Broad Street, New York City in the late 1950s. He was involved in a number of efforts to preserve his former flagship as a memorial in New York Harbor. They proved fruitless, as it was not possible to secure sufficient funding to preserve the ship.

==Personal life==
While at the University of Virginia he met Frances Cooke Grandy (1887–1968) of Norfolk, Virginia, whom Halsey called &quot;Fan&quot;. After his return from the Great White Fleet&#x27;s circumnavigation of the globe and upon his promotion to the rank of full lieutenant he was able to persuade her to marry him. They married on 1 December 1909, at Christ Church in Norfolk. Among the ushers were Halsey&#x27;s friends Thomas C. Hart and Husband E. Kimmel. Fan developed manic depression in the late 1930s and eventually had to live apart from Halsey. The couple had two children, Margaret Bradford (10 October 1910 – 15 December 1979) and William Frederick Halsey III (8 September 1915 – 23 September 2003). Halsey is also the great-uncle of actor Charles Oliver Hand, known professionally as Brett Halsey, who chose his stage name as a reference to him.

==Death==

While vacationing on Fishers Island, New York, Halsey died of a heart attack at age 76 on 16 August 1959. After lying in state in the Washington National Cathedral, he was interred on 20 August, near his parents in Arlington National Cemetery. His wife, Frances Grandy Halsey, is buried with him.

Asked about his contribution in the Pacific and the role he played in defending the United States, Halsey said merely:
== Dates of rank ==
: United States Naval Academy Midshipman—Class of 1904


Halsey never held the rank of lieutenant (junior grade), as he was appointed a full lieutenant after three years of service as an ensign. For administrative reasons, Halsey&#x27;s naval record states he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant (junior grade) and lieutenant on the same day.

At the time of Halsey&#x27;s promotion to rear admiral, both rear admirals lower half (O-7) and rear admirals upper half (O-8) wore two stars. This was the case until 1942. During World War II and up until 1950, the Navy used the one star commodore rank for certain staff specialties.

== In popular culture ==
* Halsey was portrayed by James Cagney in the 1959 bio-pic, &quot;The Gallant Hours&quot;; by James Whitmore in the 1970 film, &quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot;; by Robert Mitchum in the 1976 film, &quot;Midway&quot;, and by Dennis Quaid in the 2019 film &quot;Midway&quot;.
* Halsey makes a brief appearance in Herman Wouk&#x27;s novel &quot;The Winds of War&quot;, and has a more substantial supporting role in the sequel &quot;War and Remembrance&quot;. Wouk was extremely critical of Halsey&#x27;s handling of the battle at Leyte Gulf, but also said he was too great a builder of naval morale to be retired in disgrace. (Chapter 92) Halsey was portrayed in the 1983 television miniseries adaptation of &quot;The Winds of War&quot; by Richard X. Slattery, and in the 1988 miniseries adaptation of &quot;War and Remembrance&quot; by Pat Hingle.
* Halsey has been portrayed in a number of other films and TV miniseries, played by Glenn Morshower (&quot;Pearl Harbor&quot;, 2001), Kenneth Tobey (&quot;MacArthur&quot;, 1977), Jack Diamond (&quot;Battle Stations&quot;, 1956), John Maxwell, (&quot;The Eternal Sea&quot;, 1955) and Morris Ankrum (&quot;Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo&quot;, 1944).
* An &quot;Admiral Halsey&quot; is mentioned in the Paul and Linda McCartney song &quot;Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey&quot;. The chorus of &quot;hands across the water, heads across the sky&quot; was a reference to the American aid programs of World War II. McCartney later specified that the second half of the song was indeed in honor of William Halsey.
* On 4 March 1951, Halsey appeared as a mystery guest on episode No. 40 of the game show, &quot;What&#x27;s My Line&quot;, where the panel correctly deduced his identity.
* In the television series, &quot;McHale&#x27;s Navy&quot;, one of Captain Binghamton&#x27;s catchphrases whenever he would get frustrated with one of McHale&#x27;s schemes was, &quot;What in the name of Halsey is going on here?&quot;
* Halsey is mentioned in the 1990 film &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot;. Soviet submarine commander Marko Ramius, while engaged in battle with the Soviet attack submarine &quot;Konovalov&quot;, asks Jack Ryan what books he wrote for the CIA. Ryan mentions one about Admiral Halsey, entitled &quot;The Fighting Sailor&quot; (not to be confused with a real book of the same title); Ramius reveals his awareness of the book and expresses disdain for Ryan&#x27;s assessment of Halsey, saying, &quot;Your conclusions were all wrong, Ryan. Halsey acted stupidly&quot;.
* A character in Seth MacFarlane&#x27;s &quot;The Orville&quot; is named Admiral Halsey, presumably after Admiral Halsey.
* In &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot;, William Holden&#x27;s character, feigning madness as his excuse for impersonating an officer, says, &quot;I&#x27;m getting worse, you know. Sometimes I think I&#x27;m Admiral Halsey&quot;.
* A former service area on the New Jersey Turnpike was named for Admiral William Halsey located by what is now Exit 13A in Elizabeth, New Jersey. Upon creation of the exit in 1982, this caused the obscuring of the service area as they both overlapped with each other, before the service area itself closed in 1994.

<text>The lunar geological timescale (or selenological timescale) divides the history of Earth&#x27;s Moon into five generally recognized periods: the Copernican, Eratosthenian, Imbrian (Late and Early epochs), Nectarian, and Pre-Nectarian. The boundaries of this time scale are related to large impact events that have modified the lunar surface, changes in crater formation through time, and the size-frequency distribution of craters superposed on geological units. The absolute ages for these periods have been constrained by radiometric dating of samples obtained from the lunar surface. However, there is still much debate concerning the ages of certain key events, because correlating lunar regolith samples with geological units on the Moon is difficult, and most lunar radiometric ages have been highly affected by an intense history of bombardment.

==Lunar stratigraphy==

The primary geological processes that have modified the lunar surface are impact cratering and volcanism, and by using standard stratigraphic principles (such as the law of superposition) it is possible to order these geological events in time. At one time, it was thought that the mare basalts might represent a single stratigraphic unit with a unique age, but it is now recognized that mare volcanism was an ongoing process, beginning as early as 4.2 Ga (1 Ga = 1 billion years ago) and continuing to perhaps as late as 1.2 Ga. Impact events are by far the most useful for defining a lunar stratigraphy as they are numerous and form in a geological instant. The continued effects of impact cratering over long periods of time modify the morphology of lunar landforms in a quantitative way, and the state of erosion of a landform can also be used to assign a relative age.

The lunar geological time scale has been divided into five periods (Pre-Nectarian, Nectarian, Imbrian, Eratosthenian, and Copernican) with one of these (the Imbrian) being subdivided into two epochs. These divisions of geological time are based on the recognition of convenient geomorphological markers, and as such, they should not be taken to imply that any fundamental changes in geological processes have occurred at these boundaries. The Moon is unique in the Solar System in that it is the only body (other than the Earth) for which we possess rock samples with a known geological context. By correlating the ages of samples obtained from the Apollo missions to known geological units, it has been possible to assign absolute ages to some of these geological periods. Some of the lunar time scale ages are uncertain or disputed. In many lunar highland regions, it is not possible to distinguish between Nectarian and Pre-Nectarian materials, and these deposits are sometimes labeled as just Pre-Imbrian.
===Pre-Nectarian===

The Pre-Nectarian period is defined from the point at which the lunar crust formed, to the time of the Nectaris impact event. Nectaris is a multi-ring impact basin that formed on the near side of the Moon, and its ejecta blanket serves as a useful stratigraphic marker. 30 impact basins from this period are recognized, the oldest of which is the South Pole–Aitken basin. This geological period has been informally subdivided into the Cryptic and Basin Groups 1–9, but these divisions are not used on any geological maps.

===Nectarian===

The Nectarian period encompasses all events that occurred between the formation of the Nectaris and Imbrium impact basins. 12 multi-ring impact basins are recognized in the Nectarian period, including the Serenitatis and Crisium basins. One of the scientific objectives of the Apollo 16 mission was to date material excavated by the Nectaris impact basin. Nevertheless, the age of the Nectaris basin is somewhat contentious, with the most frequently cited numbers being 3.92 Ga, and less frequently 3.85 Ga. Recently, it has been suggested that the Nectaris basin could be, in fact, much older at ~4.1 Ga.

===Imbrian===

The Imbrian period has been subdivided into Late and Early epochs. The Early Imbrian is defined as the time between the formation of the Imbrium and Orientale impact basins. The Imbrium basin is believed to have formed at 3.85 Ga, though a minority opinion places this event at 3.77 Ga. The Schrödinger basin is the only other multi-ring basin that is Lower Imbrian in age, and no large multi-ring basins formed after this epoch.

The Late Imbrian is defined as the time between the formation of the Orientale basin, and the time at which craters of a certain size (DL) have been obliterated by erosional processes. The age of the Orientale basin has not been directly determined, though it must be older than 3.72 Ga (based on Upper Imbrian ages of mare basalts) and could be as old as 3.84 Ga based on the size-frequency distributions of craters superposed on Orientale ejecta. About two-thirds of the Moon&#x27;s mare basalts erupted within the Upper Imbrian Series, with many of these lavas filling the depressions associated with older impact basins.

===Eratosthenian===

The base of the Eratosthenian period is defined by the time at which craters on a geological unit of a certain size DL have been almost obliterated by erosional processes. The principal erosional agent on the Moon is impact cratering itself, though seismic modification could play a minor role as well. The absolute age of this boundary is not well defined, but is commonly quoted as being near 3.2 Ga. The younger boundary of this period is defined based on the recognition that freshly excavated materials on the lunar surface are generally bright and that they become darker over time as a result of space weathering processes. Operationally, this period was originally defined as the time at which impact craters lost their bright ray systems. This definition, however, has recently been subjected to some criticism as some crater rays are bright for compositional reasons that are unrelated to the amount of space weathering they have incurred. In particular, if the ejecta from a crater formed in the highlands (which is composed of bright anorthositic materials) is deposited on the low albedo mare, it will remain bright even after being space weathered.

===Copernican===

The Copernican period is the youngest geological period of the Moon. Originally, the presence of a bright ray system surrounding an impact crater was used to define Copernican units, but as mentioned above, this is complicated by the presence of compositional ray systems. The base of the Copernican period does not correspond to the formation of the impact crater Copernicus. The age of the base of the Copernican is not well constrained, but a commonly quoted number is 1.1 Ga. The Copernican extends until the present day.

==Relationship to Earth&#x27;s geologic time scale==
The divisions of the lunar geologic time scale are based on the recognition of a few convenient geomorphological markers. While these divisions are extremely useful for ordering geological events in a relative manner, it is important to realize that the boundaries do not imply any fundamental change of geological processes. Furthermore, as the oldest geological periods of the Moon are based exclusively on the times of individual impact events (in particular, Nectaris, Imbrium, and Orientale), these punctual events will most likely not correspond to any specific geological event on the other terrestrial planets, such as Mercury, Venus, Earth, or Mars.

Nevertheless, at least one notable scientific work has advocated using the lunar geological time scale to subdivide the Hadean eon of Earth&#x27;s geologic time scale. In particular, it is sometimes found that the Hadean is subdivided into the Cryptic, Basin Groups 1–9, Nectarian, and Early Imbrian. This notation is not entirely consistent with the above lunar geologic time scale in that the Cryptic and Basin Groups 1–9 (both of which are only informal terms that are not used in geologic maps) comprise the Pre-Nectarian period.

<text>The UNIVAC 1105 was a follow-on computer to the UNIVAC 1103A introduced by Sperry Rand in September 1958. The UNIVAC 1105 used 21 types of vacuum tubes, 11 types of diodes, 10 types of transistors, and three core types.

The UNIVAC 1105 had either 8,192 or 12,288 words of 36-bit magnetic core memory, in two or three banks of 4,096 words each. Magnetic drum memory provided either 16,384 or 32,768 words, in one or two drums with 16,384 words each. Sixteen to twenty-four UNISERVO II tape drives were connected, with a maximum capacity (not counting block overhead) of 1,200,000 words per tape. Major differences from the 1103A were in the addition of a buffered Input/Output system consisting of two 120-word buffers which allowed for overlapping of magnetic tape reading with writing at the same time.

Fixed-point numbers had a one-bit sign and a 35-bit value, with negative values represented in ones&#x27; complement format. Floating-point numbers had a one-bit sign, an eight-bit characteristic, and a 27-bit mantissa. Instructions had a six-bit operation code and two 15-bit operand addresses.

A complete UNIVAC 1105 computer system required 160 kW of power (175 KVA, 0.9 power factor) and an air conditioning unit with a power of at least 35 tons (123 kW) for cooling input water. The computer system weighed about with a floor loading of 47 lb/ft2 (230 kg/m2) and required a room 49 x 64 x 10 ft (15 x 20 x 3 m). The floor space for the computer was approximately 3,752 ft2 (350 m2). The power, refrigeration and equipment room was approximately 2,450 ft2 (230 m2).

==Cost, price and rental rates==
==Chapel Hill==
In 1959, a Univac 1105 located in the basement of Phillips Hall of The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill was one of three computers of its type. It was intended primarily for the United States Census Bureau, which had one of its own; Armour Institute of Technology had the other. The Chapel Hill unit cost $2.4 million, with the improvements to the basement, including 16-inch concrete walls to protect it from nuclear attack, added $1.2 million. Its memory was less than 50 kilobytes and it had the capability of adding 30,000 numbers per second. The Univac was 60 feet long, weighed 19 tons, and used 7200 vacuum tubes. Its printer had a speed of 600 lines per minute.

<doc id="206603" wikidata="Q507196" url="?curid=206603" title="Sabrina (actress)">
<text>Norma Ann Sykes (19 May 1936 – 24 November 2016), better known as Sabrina or Sabby, was a 1950s English glamour model who progressed to a minor film career.

Sabrina was one of &quot;a host of exotic, glamorous (British) starlets ... modelled on the likes of Marilyn Monroe, Jayne Mansfield and Lana Turner&quot;; others included Diana Dors, Belinda Lee, Shirley Eaton and Sandra Dorne.

==Early life and career==
Sabrina was born on 19 May 1936 at Stepping Hill Hospital in Stockport, Cheshire, to Walter and Annie Sykes. She lived in Buckingham Street, Heaviley, for about 13 years and attended St George&#x27;s School there, before moving with her mother to Blackpool. She spent some time in hospital with rheumatic fever. At the age of 16, she moved to London, where she worked as a waitress and did some nude modelling, posing for Russell Gay in a photoshoot that led to her appearance on the five of spades in a deck of nude playing cards.

In 1955, she was chosen to play a dumb blonde in Arthur Askey&#x27;s new television series &quot;Before Your Very Eyes&quot; (BBC 1952–56, ITV 1956–58). The show ran from 18 February 1955 to 20 April 1956, and made Sabrina a household name. She was promoted by the BBC as &quot;the bosomy blonde who didn&#x27;t talk&quot;, but surviving kinescope episodes show quite clearly that she did.

Around July 1955, James Beney, of Walton Films, released a 100-foot, 9.5 mm short glamour film, &quot;At Home with Sabrina&quot;.

&quot;Goodnight with Sabrina&quot; (c.1958, 3:49 mins) is included with &quot;Beat Girl&quot; (1960), remastered in 2016 by &quot;BFI Flipside&quot;.

She made her film debut as Trixie in &quot;Stock Car,&quot; a Wolf Rilla-directed drama, in 1955. She then appeared in a small role in the 1956 film &quot;Ramsbottom Rides Again&quot;. In her third film, &quot;Blue Murder at St Trinian&#x27;s&quot; (1957), she had a non-speaking role in which, despite sharing equal billing with the star Alastair Sim on posters and appearing in many publicity stills in school uniform, she was required only to sit up in bed wearing a nightdress, reading a book, while the action took place around her.

Sabrina&#x27;s penultimate film role was in the western &quot;The Phantom Gunslinger&quot; (1970), in which she starred alongside Troy Donahue. Her final film was the horror movie &quot;The Ice House&quot; (1969), in which she replaced Jayne Mansfield, who had died in a car crash two years earlier.

==Personal life==
In 1958, she was awarded an honorary D.Litt. by the University of Leeds. On 27 November 1967, she married Harold Melsheimer (born 11 June 1927 in Germany), a Hollywood gynaecologist and obstetrician. They divorced ten years later.

In 2007, there were newspaper reports that Sabrina had become a hermit, &quot;living in squalor&quot; in a Spanish-style house on a street known as &#x27;Smog Central&#x27;, under the flightpath of Burbank Airport. Sabrina admitted that she was confined to the house due to back problems, but denied living in squalor.

Having suffered from ill health for many years, partly owing to botched back surgery, she died of blood poisoning in 2016, at the age of 80.

==Cultural impact==
* The comedy series &quot;The Goon Show&quot; contains numerous references to Sabrina&#x27;s bosom, such as &quot;By the measurements of Sabrina!&quot; and &quot;By the sweaters of Sabrina!&quot;
* In &quot;The Scandal Magazine&quot;, an episode of the radio programme &quot;Hancock&#x27;s Half Hour&quot;, Sid James plays the editor of a sleazy gossip magazine that has carried an embarrassing story about Tony Hancock. James tells Hancock that his readers &quot;will believe anything. ... If I told them that Sabrina was Arthur Askey&#x27;s mother, they&#x27;d believe me.&quot; Hancock replies, &quot;Well, I don&#x27;t&quot;, pauses and asks, &quot;She&#x27;s not, is she?&quot; James says emphatically &quot;No&quot;, but Hancock reflects, &quot;Mind you, there is a resemblance ...&quot;
* &quot;Brewer&#x27;s Dictionary of Phrase and Fable&quot; contains a definition for &quot;Hunchfront of Lime Grove,&quot; &quot;a somewhat unappealing nickname given to the generously endowed starlet known as Sabrina.&quot;
* In the 1950s members of the Royal Air Force dubbed parts of the Hawker Hunter jet fighter plane &quot;Sabrinas&quot; owing to two large cartridge collection pods on the underside of the aircraft.
* In the late 1950s, British lorry builder ERF produced a semi-forward control heavy goods vehicle (HGV) with a short protruding bonnet. These vehicles were nicknamed &quot;Sabrinas&quot; because they had &quot;a little more in front&quot;.
* The Western Welsh Omnibus Company of Cardiff, South Wales had some coaches with protruding front windscreens which were nicknamed &quot;Sabrinas&quot; by the staff.
* The 1959 Triumph TR3S 1985 cc iron-block alloy-headed engine was called &quot;Sabrina&quot; because of its dome-shaped cam covers.
* In 1974, the British motoring press gave the name &quot;Sabrinas&quot; to the oversized pairs of protruding rubber bumper blocks (see dagmar bumpers) added to the MG MGB, Midget and Triumph TR6 sports cars, when U.S. safety regulations mandated sturdier impact protection. The name stuck and is used around the world.

* &quot;Double Your Money&quot; (1955)
* &quot;Tarzan&quot; (one episode, 1967) as Millie

<doc id="206606" wikidata="Q1139896" url="?curid=206606" title="Criccieth Castle">
<text>Criccieth Castle (; ) is a ruined thirteenth-century castle in Criccieth, Gwynedd, Wales. It is located on a rocky headland overlooking Tremadog Bay and consists of an inner ward almost surrounded by an outer ward. The twin-towered inner gatehouse is the most prominent remaining feature and survives to almost its full height, as does the inner curtain wall. The outer curtain wall, the inner ward buildings, and the castle&#x27;s other three towers are significantly more ruinous, and in places survive only as foundations.

The castle was begun in the 1230s by Llywelyn ap Iorwerth, the prince of Gwynedd, who probably built the inner ward and gatehouse. It was extended by his grandson, Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, who probably constructed the outer ward. The castle was captured by Edward I of England in 1283 during his conquest of Wales and afterwards repaired and improved, work which included heightening the towers and inner gatehouse. The castle was besieged in 1294–1295 during an unsuccessful revolt against English rule by Madog ap Llywelyn, and further repairs took place under Edward II in the early fourteenth century. It was captured in 1404 during another unsuccessful revolt, led by Owain Glyndŵr. It may have been burnt after the latter attack and was certainly ruinous by the 1450s. Until it was destroyed the castle was frequently used as a prison, housing high-status prisoners of the princes of Gwynedd and Scottish prisoners of Edward I.

The castle was subsequently left to decay, and was considered a romantic ruin by the time it was sketched by J. M. W. Turner in 1798. It was sold by the Crown in 1858 but returned to state care in 1933, after which extensive consolidation and archaeological excavations took place. The castle is now maintained by Cadw, the historic environment service of the Welsh Government, and is open to the public. It was designated a grade I listed building in 1949, and both the castle proper and its outer defences are scheduled monuments.

==Early history==
The only other castle site near Criccieth is a motte at Dolbenmaen, approximately north of the town, which may have been built by the Normans in the eleventh century but was soon occupied by the Welsh. Dolbenmaen was probably the administrative centre () of the commote of Eifionydd, and the motte is associated with the court () of the commote&#x27;s rulers. Eifionydd&#x27;s administrative centre was transferred to Criccieth in the 1230s, when Llywelyn ap Iorwerth built the current castle; prior to this the only structures in Criccieth were the parish church of St Catherine and its associated buildings. 

It is probable that the inner ward of the current castle was built by Llywelyn ap Iorwerth in the 1230s and the outer ward between 1255 and 1282 during the rule of his grandson, Llywelyn ap Gruffudd. In 1239 Dafydd ap Llywelyn, the son and heir of Llywelyn ap Iorwerth, imprisoned Gruffudd ap Llywelyn ap Iorwerth and Owain Goch ap Gruffydd, his half-brother and half-nephew, at Criccieth. It is probable that the castle was used to house them. Gruffudd ap Llywelyn ap Iorwerth is also described as &quot;&quot;, or &#x27;Lord of Criccieth&#x27; in a contemporary eulogistic poem by Einion ap Madog ap Rhahawd. The castle is again recorded as a prison in 1259, when it housed Maredudd ap Rhys Gryg, a prince of Deheubarth who rebelled against Llywelyn ap Gruffudd. One of the last Welsh records of the castle is a letter from Llywelyn ap Gruffudd to Edward I, sent from Criccieth in 1273 or 1274.

By March 1283 the castle had been captured by the English as part of Edward I&#x27;s conquest of Wales, and the king visited in that year and in 1284. Between 1283 and 1292 the Pipe rolls record that £332 was spent at the castle, and the final expenditure for this period may have been closer to £500. This mostly consisted of improvements to existing structures, particularly the towers, which were heightened and had ground-floor doors inserted. External stairs were also constructed to give access to their first floors and the wall-walks. These changes brought the castle up to date militarily by making each floor of the towers a self-contained defensive unit. A borough was established next to the castle in November 1284; it had 23 burgage plots, the same number as Caernarfon, but does not appear to have been walled. 

In 1283–1284, when the Welsh castles were particularly well-manned, the Criccieth garrison contained 30 (garrison men), 10 (crossbowmen), 15 (residents, including sentinels, a doorkeeper, and caretaker), 1 (superintendent of arms), 1 (chaplain), 1 (stonemason), 1 (carpenter), and 1 (artisan). Sir William Leyburn was the constable and paid £100 yearly.

In 1294 Criccieth was besieged as part of a revolt against English rule by Madog ap Llywelyn. The revolt took Caernarfon Castle and sacked the town, and the castles at Harlech and Aberystwyth were also sieged. The garrison at the time consisted of Sir William Leyburn, who was still the constable, 29 men, and 41 townsfolk who had taken refuge in the castle. The siege was lifted in April 1295 and the castle resupplied by sea from Ireland. After this the castle was again used as a prison; further repairs took place between 1307 and 1327 under Edward II, which included raising the gatehouse a second time. Nevertheless, when Edward the Black Prince commissioned a survey of the castle in 1343 it was again dilapidated and in need of repairs which would cost £96 in total. The same document names the castle towers as the great tower, &quot;sister (cistern) tour&quot;, Leyburn tower, and &quot;le gynnetour&quot;. The English archaeologist Bryan O&#x27;Neil identifies these as the inner gatehouse, south-west tower (which contained a cistern), south-east tower, and north tower respectively. From to 1381 the castle constable was Syr Hywel y Fwyall (&#x27;of the Battleaxe&#x27;), who may have commanded a corps of Welshmen at the Battle of Crécy and certainly fought for Edward III at the Battle of Poitiers in 1356.

== Later history ==
The castle&#x27;s downfall came in the first half of the fifteenth century, when it was destroyed by fire. The walls of the inner gatehouse, south-west tower, and south-east tower are burnt red, and a layer of burnt material has been found during excavations in each. It is probable that the fire occurred in 1404, when the castle was captured during the rebellion of Owain Glyndŵr and, according to a document of 1450, &quot;totally destroyed&quot;. Nevertheless, that same document enlarged the castle&#x27;s garrison and does not mention repairs to the structure, so it is possible that the revolt did not cause total ruin. If this is the case then the fires took place not long after 1450, as there are no further references to the castle being used as a fortress and no record of constables being appointed after Glyndŵr&#x27;s sacking. The adjacent borough also suffered; it was described as &quot;clene decayed&quot; by John Leland, who travelled through Wales between 1535 and 1545, and by Thomas Pennant in as a &quot;poor borough town&quot;.

Criccieth is the subject of four colour studies by the Romantic artist J. M. W. Turner, as well as one full watercolour depicting salvage on Criccieth beach with the castle in the background. The sketches were undertaken when Turner visited the coast of North Wales in 1798, and the watercolour dates from 1835. Turner took some artistic licence with the latter, depicting the cliffs higher than in reality and depicting the sea in an unlikely position according to the usual pattern of Criccieth&#x27;s tides. 

It is possible that some restoration work took place under the Crown before the sale of the castle in 1858 to William Ormsby-Gore, 2nd Baron Harlech, and Lord Harlech certainly undertook some restoration work in 1879. More work took place in 1933 before George Ormsby-Gore, 3rd Baron Harlech, placed the castle under the guardianship of the Office of Works. The state carried out extensive consolidation of the fabric, and the castle was excavated under the supervision of Bryan O&#x27;Neil; prior to these excavations much of the outer ward and part of the south-east tower were buried. Some parts of the site may have been covered deliberately, as the north tower contained &quot;modern&quot; bricks and china and there was a local tradition that it was infilled in the nineteenth century to prevent children playing in the remains. The castle is now maintained by Cadw, the historic environment service of the Welsh Government, and includes exhibits and information on Welsh castles as well as the 12th-century Anglo-Norman writer Gerald of Wales. It typically receives between 42,000 and 48,000 visitors per year; this number dropped during the COVID-19 pandemic, and 31,527 people visited in 2021.

== Building sequence ==
The building sequence of the castle is the subject of debate and relies heavily on analysis of the surviving fabric; the Welsh building work is poorly documented, and although English accounts of expenditure on the castle survive they do not record what the sums were spent on.An early attempt to date the castle by observing its fabric was made by the antiquarian Thomas Pennant in his 1784 &quot;Tour in Wales&quot;. Despite Edward I being the &quot;supposed founder&quot; of the castle, Pennant would &quot;entertain no doubt&quot; that Criccieth was built by a native Welsh prince because of the similarity of the inner gatehouse to Dolwyddelan Castle. He did, however, incorrectly believe that the rounded outer faces of the gatehouse towers were an Edwardian addition. A more thorough survey of the castle by Harold Hughes, published in &quot;Archaeologia Cambrensis&quot; in 1905, gives some idea of the state of the castle before it was excavated later that century. The above-ground fabric was obscured by ivy, modern restoration, and a cairn, and much of the outer ward and the south-east tower were buried. This made it difficult to ascertain the date and original plan of the castle, particularly that of the outer ward — for example, Hughes speculates that what is now identified as the south-east tower may have been a gateway. 

When Criccieth was placed in state care in 1933 extensive archaeological excavations were begun, under the direction of Bryan O&#x27;Neil, and continued until shortly after the outbreak of World War II. During this time the buried portions of the castle were uncovered and many objects were recovered; a significant find was a crucifix made of gilt bronze and Limoges enamel, found in the western inner gatehouse tower and now in the collection of Amgueddfa Cymru. O&#x27;Neil concluded from these discoveries that there were three primary building phases: the first dated to the early thirteenth century and included most of the inner ward, the second was dated to and included most of the outer ward, and the third consisted of later additions to the first two phases undertaken by Edward I and Edward II after the English capture of the castle. O&#x27;Neil&#x27;s identification of three building phases is widely accepted, and together with the excavations forms the basis of the contemporary understanding of the castle. The academic debate has since shifted to identifying which parts of the fabric belong to which phase. In his 1970 guide to the castle, C. N. Johns suggested that the outer ward predated the inner ward; however, this theory was not supported by later historians and Richard Avent reverted to O&#x27;Neil&#x27;s building sequence in his 1989 guide. For his part, in 1983 Avent thought it likely that the north tower was English work, but by 1989 considered Llywelyn ab Iorwerth to be the more probable builder.

The source for the design of the inner gatehouse has been another topic of debate. There is consensus that Beeston Castle in Cheshire was the primary source, a theory supported by archaeologists including Richard Avent, Laurence Keen, and Rachel Swallow. Beeston was built in the 1220s by Ranulf de Blondeville, an ally of Llywelyn ap Iorwerth, and is broadly similar to Criccieth. It was built on a crag and its inner gatehouse consists of two D-shaped towers, each containing a chamber with two arrowloops facing the approach, and a gate passage guarded by a portcullis and a pair of doors. There are differences: Criccieth has three arrowloops to each guardroom, had a stone–vaulted gate passage rather than a wooden ceiling, and its towers were longer and similar to apsidal keeps. Similarities have also been noted between the Criccieth gatehouse and that at Bolingbroke Castle in Lincolnshire, also built by Ranulf de Blondeville; with Montgomery Castle in Powys, which was attacked by Llywelyn ap Iorwerth in 1228 and 1231; and with White Castle in Monmouthshire. The second and third castles were associated with Hubert de Burgh, a marcher lord and major power in South Wales.
Whatever the exact inspiration for the gatehouse, the result, according to Avent, is that at Criccieth &quot;the latest advances in military technology&quot; are combined with the &quot;somewhat haphazard Welsh castle building style&quot;.

==Architecture==

The castle occupies a rocky headland on the coast. It is almost concentric, with an inner ward surrounded by an outer ward on all sides but the south-east. The inner ward forms an irregular six-sided enclosure and contains a twin-towered gatehouse on the north side and a tower on the south-east. The outer ward is roughly triangular, following the shape of the headland, and contains towers in the north and south-west corners and a modest gatehouse in the south-east. The landward side of the castle is defended by two ditches.

As noted above, the general consensus is that the castle was built in three main phases. The first phase consists of the work undertaken in the 1230s for Llywelyn ap Iorwerth, probably consisting of the inner ward. The second phase was undertaken some time between 1255 and 1282 for Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, and the third phase of work undertaken between 1283 and 1292 for Edward I of England and between 1307 and 1327 for Edward II of England. The first two phases account for the majority of the fabric, with the third mainly consisting of improvements to the Welsh structure.
=== Inner ward ===

The inner gatehouse is the most prominent surviving castle structure, as it survives to almost full height on its three outer sides. It consists of two D-shaped towers with a gate passage between them and was built in three phases. The first was Llywelyn ap Iorwerth&#x27;s initial construction, which consists of approximately the bottom three-quarters of the building. The second phase was probably undertaken by Edward I and raised the height of the structure, creating new battlements and holes for a hoarding. The third phase is probably part of the repairs undertaken by Edward II; it heightened the gatehouse again, blocking the second-phase battlements and creating new ones above, one of which survives on the eastern tower. The gate arch is a reconstruction. The rear wall of the gatehouse is ruinous, but the remains of the stair to the first floor survive on the east side. The stair was also constructed in three phases, the first two consisting of the original stair and a subsequent widening under Llywelyn ap Gruffudd. Under Edward I the stair was widened again and the first phase built up to form a platform, which probably formed the base for a wooden stair which led up to the wall-walk of the curtain wall. A lobby off this wall-walk gave access to the second floor of the gatehouse and to a straight stair in the thickness of the gatehouse wall, which led to its own wall-walk.

The centre of the ground floor of the gatehouse is occupied by the gate passage. It was protected by a portcullis, the grooves for which partially survive just within the gate arch, and a pair of doors approximately halfway along. There is a water cistern at the rear of the passage, fed by a natural spring. Just before the cistern are the doors into two near-identical guard chambers, which occupy the ground floors of the towers. Each chamber contains three arrowslits which guard the approach to the gatehouse. The first and second storeys were probably divided by wooden partitions into smaller chambers, but it is possible that the first floor was undivided and used as a hall. At each level there is a latrine accessed from a projection on the west tower. One of the chambers in the west tower may have been a chapel, as a crucifix was found during excavations of the ground floor. It is probable that both upper floors were primarily lit by windows in the ruined rear wall; the only surviving window is at first-floor level in the east tower. The rear wall may also have contained fireplaces, as fragments of late thirteenth- or early fourteenth-century chimney were also found during excavations.
The other major feature of the inner ward is the south-west tower, which is contemporary with the gatehouse but was refaced both internally and externally under Edward I. Its western wall stands to approximately and contains the remains of a fireplace, but it is otherwise ruined. The ground floor would originally have been accessed via a ladder from the floor above, but was later entered from a doorway which was probably inserted by Llywelyn ap Gruffudd. The interior of the tower contains the base of a staircase contemporary with the refacing, but this was either left incomplete or later dismantled. There are latrine chutes on the east and west sides of the tower, which suggest that it was of three storeys. Four chutes in the adjoining section of curtain wall to the north are part of the original construction, and served latrines at ground and first-floor level. A staircase was built over the ground-floor entrance to these latrines when the tower was refaced, and provided access to the wall-walk and possibly the first floor of the tower. A stone channel for a lead pipe survives on the exterior of the east side, which fed a cistern.

The remainder of the ward is enclosed by a curtain wall, which stands to almost its full height except for the stretch between the gatehouse and south-east tower. The wall-walk survives on the southern and western stretches, as well as the parapet and half an embrasure where the wall meets the west gatehouse tower. Little trace remains of the buildings which stood against the wall, but footings and beam-holes indicate that they existed, as does a 1292 reference to the &quot;king&#x27;s hall&quot;. In the south-east corner, adjacent to the tower, is the south gate, a simple opening which originally served as a postern and later as a means of communication between the two wards. It is uncertain what the square area of cobbles adjacent to the gate represents, but it may have been an oven.

=== Outer ward ===
The north tower survives to the base of its first floor, the level of which is indicated by beam-holes in the south-east corner. It is battered on its three outer sides and the north-east wall contains two pairs of latrine chutes, suggesting that the tower had two floors. A flight of wide, shallow steps was built against the inner wall by Edward I, and running south-west from their base is a cobbled platform. These features have been interpreted as being for the transportation of ammunition for an engine mounted on the tower.

The south-west tower is the largest in the outer ward, but the most ruinous. Its lower walls are contemporary with the rest of the outer ward, but the western corner has almost entirely vanished. As originally built the tower may have consisted of two storeys and resembled the original form of the east tower of Dolwyddelan Castle, built by Llywelyn ap Iorwerth. There are flat stones on the ground which probably carried a wooden floor. The upper walls have been refaced, probably under Edward I; at the same time a doorway was inserted into the ground floor, a staircase built against the north-east wall to give access to the first floor, and a second floor probably added. The staircase blocked a pre-existing embrasure in the curtain wall. The tower was richly decorated; the doors to the staircase and first floor are chamfered and decorated with ball-stops, and archaeological finds from the interior include two corbels, one carved with foliage and the other with a human head, and a foliate capital.

The outer gatehouse was originally a simple passage through the curtain wall with a doorway at its inner end. Shortly afterward a second gate was added at the outer end of the passage and its eastern wall thickened, which necessitated lengthening the embrasure on this side. The thickened wall may have extended to the southern corner of the inner ward, controlling access to its southern gate. Finally, under Edward I a simple barbican was constructed in front of the gatehouse.

In contrast to the inner curtain wall, the outer curtain wall does not survive to a high level and as a result few features remain. Between the south-east tower and the inner gatehouse is a thicker portion of wall which probably marks the site of a stair to the wall-walk. The stretch between the south-west and north towers contains the bases of several embrasures, including the one blocked by the south-west tower stair. The centre of this section of wall is narrow to accommodate a passage between the curtains, which was originally roofed over; the narrowness of the outer wall here is an indication that it post-dates the inner.

<text>The Caprifoliaceae or honeysuckle family is a clade of dicotyledonous flowering plants consisting of about 860 species in 33 to 42 genera, with a nearly cosmopolitan distribution. Centres of diversity are found in eastern North America and eastern Asia, while they are absent in tropical and southern Africa.

==Description==
The flowering plants in this clade are mostly shrubs and vines: rarely herbs. They include some ornamental garden plants grown in temperate regions. The leaves are mostly opposite with no stipules (appendages at the base of a leafstalk or petiole), and may be either evergreen or deciduous. The flowers are tubular funnel-shaped or bell-like, usually with five outward spreading lobes or points, and are often fragrant. They usually form a small calyx with small bracts. The fruit is in most cases a berry or a drupe. The genera &quot;Diervilla&quot; and &quot;Weigela&quot; have capsular fruit, while &quot;Heptacodium&quot; has an achene.

==Taxonomy==
Views of the family-level classification of the traditionally accepted Caprifoliaceae and other plants in the botanical order Dipsacales have been considerably revised in recent decades. Most botanists now accept the placement of two of the most familiar members of this group, the elderberries (&quot;Sambucus&quot;) and the viburnums (&quot;Viburnum&quot;), in the family Adoxaceae instead; these were formerly classified here. 33 genera are currently accepted.

Several other families of the more broadly treated Caprifoliaceae &quot;s.l.&quot; are separated by some but not all authors; these are treated as subfamilies in the listing of genera below, along with estimated numbers of species.

Subfamily Diervilloideae
*&quot;Diervilla&quot; – bush honeysuckle, 3 species
*&quot;Weigela&quot; – 10 species
Subfamily Caprifolioideae &quot;s.s.&quot;
*&quot;Heptacodium&quot; – seven-son flower, 1 species
*&quot;Leycesteria&quot; – 7 species
*&quot;Lonicera&quot; – honeysuckle, 158 species
*&quot;Symphoricarpos&quot; – snowberry, 15 species
*&quot;Triosteum&quot; – horse gentian, 6 species
Subfamily Dipsacoideae
**&quot;× Succisoknautia&quot; – 1 species
**&quot;Triplostegia&quot; – 1 species
*Tribe Bassecoieae 
**&quot;Bassecoia&quot; – 3 species
*Tribe Dipsaceae
**&quot;Cephalaria&quot; – 102 species
**&quot;Dipsacus &quot; – teasel, 21 species
*Tribe Knautieae
**&quot;Knautia&quot; – 55 species
*Tribe Pseudoscabioseae
** &quot;Pseudoscabiosa&quot; – 3 species
*Tribe Pterocephalidieae
** &quot;Pterocephalidium&quot; – 1 species
** &quot;Pterothamnus&quot; – 1 species
*Tribe Succiseae 
**&quot;Succisa&quot; - 3 species
**&quot;Succisella&quot; – 5 species
Subfamily Scabiosoideae
*Tribe Scabioseae
**&quot;Pterocephalus&quot; – 34 species
**&quot;Scabiosa&quot; – scabious or pincushion flower, 68 species
*Tribe Lomelosieae
**&quot;Lomelosia&quot; – 63 species 
**&quot;Pycnocomon&quot; – 2 species
Subfamily Linnaeoideae
*&quot;Abelia&quot; – 6 species
*&quot;Diabelia&quot; – 4 species
*&quot;Dipelta&quot; – 3 species
*&quot;Kolkwitzia&quot; – beautybush, 1 species
*&quot;Linnaea&quot; – twinflower, 1 species
*&quot;Vesalea&quot; – 6 species
Subfamily Morinoideae 
*&quot;Morina&quot; – 14 species
*&quot;Zabelia&quot; – 8 species
Subfamily Valerianoideae
*&quot;Nardostachys &quot; – 1 species
*&quot;Patrinia&quot; – 14 species
*&quot;Valeriana&quot; – valerians, 426 species
*&quot;Valerianella&quot; – cornsalads, 28 species

==Uses==
The plants belonging to this family are mainly hardy shrubs or vines of ornamental value, many of which are popular garden shrubs, notably species belonging to the genera &quot;Abelia&quot;, &quot;Lonicera&quot;, and &quot;Weigela&quot;. &quot;Valerianella locusta&quot; is cultivated for use in food.

A few, however, have become invasive weeds outside their native ranges (such as &quot;Lonicera japonica&quot;).

<text>In general linguistics, the comparative is a syntactic construction that serves to express a comparison between two (or more) entities or groups of entities in quality or degree - see also comparison (grammar) for an overview of comparison, as well as positive and superlative degrees of comparison. 

The syntax of comparative constructions is poorly understood due to the complexity of the data. In particular, the comparative frequently occurs with independent mechanisms of syntax such as coordination and forms of ellipsis (gapping, pseudogapping, null complement anaphora, stripping, verb phrase ellipsis). The interaction of the various mechanisms complicates the analysis.

==Absolute and null forms==
A number of fixed expressions use a comparative form where no comparison is being asserted, such as &quot;higher education&quot; or &quot;younger generation&quot;. These comparatives can be called &quot;absolute&quot;.

Similarly, a null comparative is one in which the starting point for comparison is not stated. These comparisons are frequently found in advertising, for example, in typical assertions such as &quot;Our burgers have more flavor&quot;, &quot;Our picture is sharper&quot; or &quot;50% more&quot;. These uses of the comparative do not mention what it is they are being compared to. In some cases it is easy to infer what the missing element in a null comparative is. In other cases, the speaker or writer has been deliberately vague, for example &quot;Glasgow&#x27;s miles better&quot;.

Scientific classification, taxonomy, and geographical categorization conventionally include the adjectives &quot;greater&quot; and &quot;lesser&quot;, when a &quot;large&quot; or &quot;small&quot; variety of an item is meant, as in the greater celandine as opposed to the lesser celandine. These adjectives may at first sight appear as a kind of &quot;null comparative&quot;, when as is usual, they are cited without their opposite counterpart. It should be apparent, however, that an entirely different variety of animal, scientific, or geographical object is intended. Thus it may be found, for example, that the lesser panda entails a giant panda variety, and a gazetteer would establish that there are the Lesser Antilles as well as the Greater Antilles. It is in the nature of grammatical conventions evolving over time that it is difficult to establish when they first became widely accepted, but both &quot;greater&quot; and &quot;lesser&quot; in these instances have over time become mere adjectives (or adverbial constructs), so losing their &quot;comparative&quot; connotation. Further, &quot;Greater&quot; indicates the inclusion of adjacent areas when referring to metropolitan areas, such as when suburbs are intended. Although it implies a comparison with a narrower definition that refers to a central city only, such as Greater London versus the City of London, or Greater New York versus New York City, it is not part of the &quot;comparative&quot; in the grammatical sense of this article. A comparative always compares something directly with something else.

==Comparative coordination vs. comparative subordination==
At times the syntax of comparatives matches the syntax of coordination, and at other times, it must be characterized in terms of subordination.

===Comparative coordination===
The syntax of comparatives can closely mirror the syntax of coordination. The similarity in structure across the following a- and b-sentences illustrates this point. The conjuncts of the coordinate structures are enclosed in square brackets:

::a. [The boys] and [the girls] sent flowers to him today.
::b. More [boys] than [girls] sent flowers to him today.

::a. [The boys sent] and [the girls dropped off] flowers for him today.
::b. [More boys sent] than [girls dropped off] flowers for him today.

::a. The boys sent [flowers to him] and [chocolates to her] today.
::b. More boys sent [flowers to him] than [chocolates to her] today.

::a. The boys sent [flowers to him today] and [chocolates to her yesterday].
::b. More boys sent [flowers to him today] than [chocolates to her yesterday].

The structure of the b-sentences involving comparatives is closely similar to the structure of the a-sentences involving coordination. Based on this similarity, many have argued that the syntax of comparatives overlaps with the syntax of coordination at least some of the time. In this regard, the &quot;than&quot; in the b-sentences should be viewed as a coordinator (coordinate conjunction), not as a subordinator (subordinate conjunction).

===Comparative subordination===
Examples of the comparative that do not allow an analysis in terms of coordination (because the necessary parallel structures are not present) are instances of comparative subordination. In such cases, &quot;than&quot; has the status of a preposition or a subordinator (subordinate conjunction), e.g.

::a. We invited more people than wanted to come.

::b. A better striker was playing for them than we have.

::c. More passengers than the airline had issued tickets tried to board the plane.

::d. More guests than we had chairs showed up.

::e. Who did he eat more hotdogs than?

Since the parallel structures associated with coordinate structures, i.e., the conjuncts, cannot be acknowledged in these sentences, the only analysis available is one in terms of subordination, whereby &quot;than&quot; has the status of a subordinator (as in sentences a-d) or of a preposition (as in sentence e). What this means is that the syntax of comparatives is complex because at times an analysis in terms of coordination is warranted, whereas at other times, the analysis must assume subordination.

==Comparative deletion and subdeletion==
There are two types of ellipsis that are unique to the &quot;than&quot;-clauses of comparatives: &quot;comparative deletion&quot; and &quot;comparative subdeletion&quot;. The existence of comparative deletion as an ellipsis mechanism is widely acknowledged, whereas the status of comparative subdeletion as an ellipsis mechanism is more controversial.

===Comparative deletion===
Comparative deletion is an obligatory ellipsis mechanism that occurs in the &quot;than&quot;-clause of a comparative construction. The elided material of comparative deletion is indicated using a blank, and the unacceptable b-sentences show what is construed as having been elided in the a-sentences:

::a. Fred reads more books than Susan reads ___. 
::b. *Fred reads more books than Susan reads books. 

::a. We invited more people than ___ came.
::b. *We invited more people than people came. 

::a. She was happier than I was ___.
::b. *She was happier than I was happy. 

===Comparative subdeletion===
Comparative subdeletion is a second type of ellipsis in comparatives that some accounts acknowledge. It occurs when the focused constituent in the &quot;than&quot;-clause is not deleted because it is distinct from its counterpart in the main clause. In other words, comparative subdeletion occurs when comparative deletion does not because the constituents being compared are distinct, e.g.

::a. He has more cats than he has __ dogs.

::b. Fewer women showed up than __ men wanted to dance.

::c. You were happier than I was __ sad.

::b. The table is as wide as it is __ tall.

Accounts that acknowledge comparative subdeletion posit a null measure expression in the position marked by the blank (x-many, x-much). This element serves to focus the expression in the same way that &quot;-er&quot; or &quot;more&quot; focuses its counterpart in the main clause. Various arguments are put forth that motivate the existence of this null element. These arguments will not be reproduced here, though. Suffice it to say that the sentences in which subdeletion is supposedly occurring are qualitatively different from sentences in which comparative deletion occurs, e.g., &quot;He has more cats than you have ___ .&quot;

==Independent ellipsis mechanisms in &quot;than&quot;-clauses==
There are a number of independent ellipsis mechanisms that occur in the &quot;than-&quot;clauses of comparative constructions: gapping, pseudogapping, null complement anaphora, stripping, and verb phrase ellipsis. These mechanisms are independent of comparative clauses because they also occur when the comparative is not involved. The presence of these ellipsis mechanisms in &quot;than&quot;-clauses complicates the analysis considerably, since they render it difficult to discern which aspects of the syntax of comparatives are unique to comparatives.

::a. You should visit me on Tuesday, and I ___ you on Wednesday. 
::b. You visited me on Tuesdays more than I ___ you on Wednesdays. 

::a. He will say it twice before she has ___ once. 
::b. More people will say it twice than ___ will ___ just once. 

::a. He did it as I expected ___ . 
::b. He did it more than I expected ___ . 

::a. Men did it, and women ___ too. 
::b. More men did it than women ___ . 

::a. Susan has helped when you have ___ . 
::b. Susan has helped more than you have ___ . 

The fact that the five independent ellipsis mechanisms (and possibly others) can occur in the &quot;than&quot;-clauses of comparatives has rendered the study of the syntax of comparatives particularly difficult. One is often not sure which ellipsis mechanisms are involved in a given &quot;than&quot;-clause. One thing is clear, however: the five ellipsis mechanisms illustrated here are distinct from the two ellipsis mechanisms that are unique to comparatives mentioned above (comparative deletion and comparative subdeletion).

==Double comparatives==

If an adjective has two comparative markers, it is known as a double comparative (e.g. &quot;more louder&quot;, &quot;&quot;). The use of double comparatives is generally associated with Appalachian English and African American Vernacular English, though they were common in Early Modern English and were used by Shakespeare.

::&quot;The Duke of Milan / and his more braver daughter could controul thee.&quot;—Shakespeare, &quot;The Tempest&quot;

In recent times, such constructions have been used humorously, or to convey a sense of erudition, in addition to their original purpose of emphasis.

::&quot;The female of the species is more deadlier than the male&quot;—Space, &quot;Female of the Species&quot;, 1996
::&quot;World must prepare for disease more deadlier than Covid, WHO chief warns&quot;, &quot;The Independent&quot;, describing remarks by World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, 2023

==Universals of comparative constructions==

Russell Ultan (1972) surveyed 20 languages and observed that the comparative and superlative are inflected forms of (near-)identical bases with respective to the positive and equative. Jonathan D. Bobaljik (2012) contends that Ultan’s generalization is a strong contender for a linguistic universal. Bobaljik formulates the Comparative-Superlative Generalization: With respect to the positive, if any adjective’s comparative degree were suppletive, so would its superlative; vice versa, if any adjective’s superlative degree were suppletive, then so would its comparative. 

Bobaljik phrases the Containment Hypothesis thus: &quot;The representation of the superlative properly contains that of the comparative (in all languages that have a morphological superlative)&quot;. Indeed:
*in many languages (Persian, Ubykh, Cherokee, Chukchi, etc.) the superlative transparently contains the comparative; 
*in Celtic languages, Arabic, Klon, Totonac, etc. the comparatives and the superlatives are formally similar;
*in Romance languages, Greek, Maltese, etc. the superlatives are derived from the comparatives by means of the addition of definite articles.

Additionally, Bobaljik asserts that Universal Grammar lacks the superlative morpheme.

<text>Dolwyddelan Castle ( ; ; ) is a thirteenth-century castle located west of Dolwyddelan in Conwy County Borough, Wales. Tomen Castell, a late twelfth-century tower, is located south-east of the castle.

Dolwyddelan Castle was probably begun by Llywelyn ab Iorwerth, the ruler of the Kingdom of Gwynedd, between 1210 and 1240 to defend an east–west route within the kingdom. It superseded Tomen Castell, a small tower possibly built by Llywelyn&#x27;s father, Iorwerth Drwyndwn. Dolwyddelan was captured by Edward I of England in 1283, and despite being immediately refortified its military significance subsequently declined. In 1488 Maredudd ab Ieuan, a member of a family from neighbouring Eifionydd, purchased the lease and repaired the structure, but it was ruinous by the mid-nineteenth century. Between 1848 and 1850 the keep was restored and reconstructed by Peter Drummond-Burrell, 22nd Baron Willoughby de Eresby, and in 1930 the castle was placed in state care; it is currently managed by Cadw, the Welsh Government&#x27;s historic environment service, and open to the public. It was designated a grade I listed building in 1997 and is a scheduled monument.

The castle is built on a small knoll and consists of a keep on the east side and a tower on the west, linked by walls to form a roughly circular enclosure. The building history is uncertain, but the keep is the oldest structure. It has been heightened twice, first by either Edward I or Maredudd ab Ieuan and second during the nineteenth-century restoration. The western tower may have been constructed in the late thirteenth century by Llywelyn ap Gruffudd or shortly after the English capture of the castle.

==Early history==
The fragmentary remains of Tomen Castell, a small tower, stand on a rocky outcrop between the later castle and the Afon Lledr. The tower predates Dolwyddelan Castle and is the likely birthplace of Llywelyn ab Iorwerth, prince of Gwynedd and Wales, despite a tradition that the prince was born in the castle. Tomen Castell may have been built by Iorwerth Drwyndwn, the father of Llywelyn and eldest son of Owain Gwynedd, to assert his authority in the period of unrest after the death of the latter in 1170. At the summit of the outcrop are the remains of the small rectangular tower, which has outer dimensions of approximately and walls approximately thick. The outcrop falls away steeply to the north, east, and south, and was defended by a ditch on the west where the ground is less precipitous. It was replaced by the current castle.

Dolwyddelan Castle was probably built by Llywelyn ab Iorwerth between 1210 and 1240 in order to guard the road from Nant Conwy to Meirionydd, which at that time ran along the valley side and passed close to the west of the castle. The castle was built at Ffriddgelli, one of the ten , or summer cattle grazing pastures, which belonged to the princes of Gwynedd in the Lledr valley. The rectangular keep is typical of those constructed by the Welsh princes in the thirteenth century, and bears a resemblance to the contemporary towers built by Llywelyn at Castell y Bere and Criccieth. The keep was initially freestanding, but the curtain wall was built by Llywelyn soon afterwards.

It is uncertain when the west tower at Dolwyddelan was constructed, but it was certainly built after the curtain wall and the surviving dressed stone suggests a late thirteenth or early fourteenth century date. It likely replaced an earlier building, as at this point the curtain incorporates two latrine chutes which are contemporary with it. The tower may have been built by Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, the grandson of Llywelyn ab Iorwerth, who constructed similar towers at Criccieth and Dolforwyn. Alternatively, it may have been erected after the capture of the castle by Edward I&#x27;s forces on 18 January 1283, as a surviving account from the same year mentions the construction of a &quot;camera&quot; (lodging) at Dolwyddelan.

The siege which brought the castle under English control did not last long and it is possible that the constable negotiated a surrender. The castle was immediately refortified, supplied with a siege engine built at Betws-y-Coed, and occupied by an English garrison which was supplied with white material from Ireland and white stockings to use as winter camouflage. Between 1283 and 1292 the castle was repaired and a new bridge and water mill constructed in the valley. English troops maintained a military presence at the castle until at least 1290, when Gruffudd ap Tudur, the Welsh constable appointed in 1284, was still in office.

== Later history ==
Little appears to have happened at the castle between the end of the thirteenth century and 1488, when the lease was acquired by Maredudd ab Ieuan. According to the &quot;History of the Gwydir Family&quot;, compiled by his descendant Sir John Wynn, 1st baronet between 1590 and 1614, Maredudd was a member of a family from the commote of Eifionydd which was notorious for kindred feuds, and he moved to Dolwyddelan to both extend his influence and distance himself from his relatives.

The castle at this time was partly habitable, as it had shortly before been occupied by Hywel ab Ieuan ap Rhys, a &quot;captain&quot; and &quot;outlaw&quot;. The country surrounding Dolwyddelan was unruly, and although Maredudd built a new house, Tai Penamnen, nearby he may have valued the castle as a secure residence. It is possible that he heightened the keep, but Richard Avent considers it more probable that this work was undertaken by Edward I and that Maredudd instead preferred the spacious chambers in the west tower. Dolwyddelan became part of the Gwydir estate when Maredudd purchased Gwydir Castle , and remained so until being sold in 1895.

In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries the now-ruined castle attracted the attention of artists and antiquarians. It was engraved by Samuel and Nathaniel Buck in 1742 and painted in 1788 by Moses Griffith for inclusion in Thomas Pennant&#x27;s &quot;A Tour in Wales&quot;, which includes a description and history of the castle. An account of the castle given in 1816 by the artist Edward Pugh in his &quot;Cambria Depicta&quot; suggests that one of the towers collapsed around 1810. It is possible that a rough sketch from 1799 by J. M. W. Turner also depicts the castle. These accounts are valuable as they record the castle before it was partially restored and reconstructed by Lord Willoughby de Eresby, a distant descendant of Maredudd ab Ieuan, between 1848 and 1850. This work included raising the keep to its current height and adding the battlements. Dolwyddelan was placed under the guardianship of the Ministry of Works in 1930 and is now managed by Cadw. The castle is both a scheduled monument and grade I listed building, and is open to the public. In 1980 the castle was used as a location for the film &quot;Dragonslayer&quot;.

==Architecture==

Dolwyddelan Castle forms a roughly circular enclosure around the knoll it occupies, and is constructed of local grit and slate rubble. The keep is the oldest part of the castle and consists of a basement with two storeys above. By the mid-nineteenth century it was ruined, with a large v-shaped area of masonry missing from the northern wall. The keep was extensively restored and rebuilt between 1848 and 1850 by Lord Willoughby de Eresby. The work included reconstructing the uppermost part of the keep, including the fake drains which project from the wall and the battlements; renewing the existing doors and windows; inserting windows into the second storey; and extensive reconstruction of the north and south walls, including the latrine extension which projects from the latter.

The entrance to the tower is on the first floor via a flight of steps which was originally protected by a forebuilding, now ruinous. The interior is currently a two-storey space, but would originally have consisted of only the first floor. The line of the original gable is preserved in the south wall, and the side walls have an offset which would have supported the roof timbers. The fireplace in the east wall has a thirteenth-century back but otherwise dates from the restoration. The window embrasure to the left of the fireplace contains an entrance to a stair contained within the thickness of the wall, which leads to the roof. There is no evidence of a second-floor door from this stair, although the nineteenth-century rebuilding may have obscured the existence of one. As the second-floor windows also date from this reconstruction it is possible that the tower was heightened without a new floor being inserted.

The west tower is ruinous, but originally consisted of two storeys with a single chamber on each floor. Its east and north sides incorporate the original curtain wall and two latrine chutes in the north-east corner. The east wall is approximately high and contains evidence of a door and window on the ground floor and a fireplace with a hood on the first floor. The bottom half of a narrow window survives in the south wall; its dressings, as well as those of the surviving doorway jambs, are similar to those used at Conwy Castle, which was built by Edward I. The window was blocked in the fifteenth century, when an external staircase was built against the south wall to provide access to the curtain wall. There is no evidence of an internal stair and, if one existed, it may have been made of timber.

The curtain wall encloses the space between the two towers. There was no gatehouse and the main entrance was a simple gateway in the north-east wall. This was probably reached by a wooden bridge across the rock-cut ditch on this side of the castle; there is another ditch on the south-western side of the knoll. The highest surviving portion of curtain is to the south of the keep and reaches a height of ; the wall has a maximum thickness of . The southern corner between the keep and curtain wall contains the remains of an oven, and may mark the site of the kitchens. The curtain also contains the remains of a postern gate in the north-east corner.

<text>Arthur LeRoy Bristol, Jr. (July 15, 1886 – April 27, 1942) was a vice admiral in the United States Navy, who held important commands during World War I and World War II, and was an early aircraft carrier commander.

==Early life and career==
Born in Charleston, South Carolina, he entered the United States Naval Academy on September 23, 1902, and graduated with the Class of 1906. After the prescribed two years of sea duty, which he served in the pre-dreadnought USS &quot;Illinois&quot; (Battleship No. 7), he received his commission as ensign in 1908. Transferred to in 1909, he remained in that Presidential yacht until ordered to Berlin, Germany, in January 1912 for a year and one-half as a naval attaché. In June 1913, he returned home to command the new destroyer &quot;Cummings&quot; (Destroyer No. 44) upon her completion at Bath Iron Works. A year later, he received the concurrent command of &quot;Terry&quot; (Destroyer No. 25) and the 2nd Division, Reserve Torpedo Flotilla, U.S. Atlantic Fleet. He then briefly commanded &quot;Jarvis&quot; (Destroyer No. 38).

==World War I==
Late in 1915, Bristol was assigned the duties of aide and torpedo officer on the staff of Commander, Torpedo Flotilla, Atlantic Fleet and, in the winter of 1916, he became aide and flag secretary to the Commander, Destroyer Force, Atlantic Fleet. In the summer of 1917, soon after the United States entered World War I, he became aide and flag secretary for Commander, Cruiser Force, Atlantic Fleet. After serving in that capacity into the following winter, Bristol was awarded the Navy Cross for his service as flag secretary and acting chief of staff to Commander, Cruiser and Transport Force. While holding that post, he worked closely with Army authorities in the handling of troopship movements.

Later, as flag secretary for the Commander, Cruiser and Transport Force, he earned the Distinguished Service Medal. Going ashore in February 1918, he labored in Washington through the end of World War I and into the spring of 1919 on duty in the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations.

==Russian Civil War==
Bristol then commanded and in succession, serving in the latter during that ship&#x27;s operations in the Black Sea during the capitulation of White Russian forces to the Bolsheviks in November 1920. For his services rendered during the evacuation of the Crimea, a grateful Russian Empire government in exile presented him with the Order of St. Stanislav, III Class.

==Assignments during the interwar years==
Detached from &quot;Overton&quot; in August 1921, Bristol again served in Washington attached to the Navy General Board and then went to Philadelphia to assist in the decommissioning of destroyers. A course of instruction at the Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island, occupied him from July 1922 to May 1923, and he next served as an instructor on the staff of that institution from May 1923 to May 1924. Following a brief tour as aide for Commander, Scouting Fleet, he sailed to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, to join the American naval mission there.

Reporting to the battleship in February 1927, Bristol served as executive officer of that dreadnought until April of the following year, and then moved to the Naval Air Station (NAS), San Diego, California, for aviation instruction. Following further flight training at NAS, Pensacola, Florida, he was designated a naval aviator and was sent to the Asiatic Fleet, where he served as commanding officer of the seaplane tender and later, as Commander, Aircraft Squadrons, Asiatic Fleet.

Detached in the spring of 1931, he checked in briefly at the Office of Naval Intelligence in Washington before proceeding on to the United Kingdom to become naval attaché in London on October 1, 1931. A brief stop in the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations upon his return from England in the spring of 1934 preceded his traveling to the Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Co., Newport News, Virginia, as prospective commanding officer of the new aircraft carrier .

==Carrier commander==
The first commanding officer of the Navy&#x27;s first aircraft carrier to be built as such from the keel up, Bristol took &quot;Ranger&quot; to South American waters on shakedown and commanded her thereafter until June 1936, when he became Commanding Officer NAS, San Diego. During the latter tour, he served on the Hepburn Board, participating in the investigations into suitable base sites in the United States and its possessions.

Becoming Commander, Patrol Wing 2, at Pearl Harbor, on July 27, 1939, Bristol was given flag rank on August 1, and, the following summer, became Commander Carrier Division 1. He then served as Commander, Aircraft, Scouting Force (September 18 to October 12, 1940), and as Commander, Patrol Wings, United States Fleet (October 12, 1940, to January 23, 1941) before reporting to the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations on January 25, 1941.

==World War II==
With increasing American alarm over the course of the Battle of the Atlantic, the Roosevelt administration took steps to aid the British. To help escort convoys across the Atlantic, the Navy established the Support Force, U.S. Atlantic Fleet, and based it at Newport. On March 1, 1941, Rear Admiral Bristol became the Force&#x27;s first commander. He held this important position throughout the tense, undeclared war with Germany in the summer and autumn of 1941 and through America&#x27;s entry into the global conflict on December 7, of that year. Designated vice admiral on February 27, 1942, Bristol remained in that important command until he suffered a fatal heart attack at NS Argentia, Newfoundland, on April 27, 1942.

==Namesake==
The destroyer escort USS &quot;Arthur L Bristol&quot; (DE-281) was named in honor of Vice Admiral Bristol. She was converted during construction into the high-speed transport , and was in commission as such from 1945 to 1946.

The Arthur L. Bristol School, which educated the children of U.S. Navy personnel between 1957 and 1995 at Naval Air Station Argentia, Newfoundland, also was named for Vice Admiral Bristol.

<text>Scillus or Skillous () was a town of Triphylia, a district of ancient Elis, situated 20 stadia south of Olympia. In 572 BCE the Scilluntians assisted Pyrrhus, king of Pisa, in making war upon the Eleians; but they were completely conquered by the latter, and both Pisa and Scillus were razed to the ground. Scillus remained desolate till about 392 BCE, when the Lacedaemonians, who had a few years previously compelled the Eleians to renounce their supremacy over their dependent cities, colonised Scillus and gave it to Xenophon, then an exile from Athens. Xenophon resided here more than twenty years, and probably composed the &quot;Anabasis&quot; here, but was expelled from it by the Eleians soon after the Battle of Leuctra, in 371 BCE. He has left us a description of the place, which he says was situated 20 stadia (approximately 2 1/4 miles] from the Sacred Grove of Zeus, on the road to Olympia from Sparta, It stood upon the river Selinus, which was also the name of the river flowing by the temple of Artemis at Ephesus, and like the latter it abounded in fish and shell-fish. From a portion of the spoils he had acquired in the campaign he had joined against Artaxerxes II (recounted in his work The Anabasis), Xenophon dedicated a temple to Artemis, in imitation of the celebrated temple at Ephesus, and instituted a yearly festival to the goddess. Scillus stood amidst woods and meadows, and afforded abundant pasture for cattle; while the neighbouring mountains supplied wild hogs, roebucks, and stags. When Pausanias visited Scillus five centuries afterwards the temple of Artemis still remained, and a statue of Xenophon, made of Pentelic marble.

Scillus&#x27;s site is near the modern village of Makrisia.

<text>NGC 2264 is the designation number of the New General Catalogue that identifies two astronomical objects as a single object: the Cone Nebula, and the Christmas Tree Cluster. Two other objects are within this designation but not officially included, the Snowflake Cluster, and the Fox Fur Nebula. All of the objects are located in the Monoceros constellation and are located about 720 parsecs or 2,300 light-years from Earth. Due to its relative proximity and large size, it is extremely well-studied. NGC 2264 is sometimes referred to as the Christmas Tree Cluster and the Cone Nebula. However, the designation of NGC 2264 in the New General Catalogue refers to both objects and not the cluster alone.
==Structure==

NGC 2264 is the location where the Cone Nebula, the Stellar Snowflake Cluster and the Christmas Tree Cluster have formed in this emission nebula. For reference, the Stellar Snowflake Cluster is located 2,700 light years away in the constellation Monoceros. 

The Snowflake Cluster was granted its name due to its unmistakable pinwheel-like shape and its assortment of bright colors. The Christmas Tree star formation consists of young stars obscured by heavy layers of dust clouds. These dust clouds, along with hydrogen and helium are producing luminous new stars. The combination of dense clouds and an array of colors creates a color map filled with varying wavelengths. As seen in the photographs taken by the Spitzer Space telescope, we are able to differentiate between young red stars and older blue stars.

With varying youthful stars comes vast changes to the overall structure of the clusters and nebula. For a cluster to be considered a Snowflake, it must remain in the original location the star was formed.

When referring to this emission nebula overall, there are several aspects that contribute to the prominent configuration of a snowflake and/or Christmas tree cluster. There is a diverse arrangement of brilliant colors, and an evolving process of structure that follow star formation in a nebula.

The ratio of brown dwarfs to stars is between 1 to 2.5 and 1 to 7.5.

<text>NGC 7742 also known as the Fried Egg Galaxy is a face-on unbarred spiral galaxy in the constellation Pegasus. Its velocity with respect to the cosmic microwave background is 1292 ± 26km/s, which corresponds to a Hubble distance of . In addition, six &quot;non-redshift&quot; measurements give a farther distance of . It was discovered by German-British astronomer William Herschel on 18 Oct 1784.

NGC 7742 is unusual in that it contains a ring but no bar. Typically, bars are needed to produce a ring structure. The bars&#x27; gravitational forces move gas to the ends of the bars, where it forms into the rings seen in many barred spiral galaxies. In this galaxy, however, no bar is present, so this mechanism cannot be used to explain the formation of the ring. O. K. Sil&#x27;chenko and A. V. Moiseev proposed that the ring was formed partly as the result of a merger event in which a smaller gas-rich dwarf galaxy collided with NGC 7742. As evidence for this, they point to the unusually bright central region, the presence of highly inclined central gas disk, and the presence of gas that is counterrotating (or rotating in the opposite direction) with respect to the stars. It is also classified as a Type II Seyfert Galaxy.

==Supernovae==
Two supernova has been observed in NGC 7742:
* SN1993R (typeII, mag. 17) was discovered by the Leuschner Observatory Supernova Search (LOSS) on 2 June 1993.
* SN2014cy (typeIIP, mag. 16.2) was discovered by Ken&#x27;ichi Nishimura on 31 August 2014.

<text>Johann Gottfried Galle (9 June 1812 – 10 July 1910) was a German astronomer from Radis, Germany, at the Berlin Observatory who, on 23 September 1846, with the assistance of student Heinrich Louis d&#x27;Arrest, was the first person to view the planet Neptune and know what he was looking at. Urbain Le Verrier had predicted the existence and position of Neptune, and sent the coordinates to Galle, asking him to verify. Galle found Neptune in the same night he received Le Verrier&#x27;s letter, within 1° of the predicted position. The discovery of Neptune is widely regarded as a dramatic validation of celestial mechanics, and is one of the most remarkable moments of 19th-century science.

== Early life ==
Galle was born in the Papsthaus (a house in the Pabst wood) 2 km west of Radis in the vicinity of the town of Gräfenhainichen, as the first son of Marie Henriette &quot;née Pannier&quot; (1790–1839) and Johann Gottfried Galle (1790–1853), an operator of a tar oven. He attended the Gymnasium in Wittenberg and studied at Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität Berlin from 1830 to 1833. He became a teacher at the Gymnasium in Guben, teaching mathematics and physics. Later on, he transferred to the Gymnasium in Berlin.

== Berlin Observatory ==

He had started to work as an assistant to Johann Franz Encke in 1835 immediately following the completion of the new Berlin Observatory. Galle worked there for the next 16 years, making use especially of a Fraunhofer-refractor with 9 Zoll (~22.5 cm) aperture. In 1838 he discovered an inner, dark ring of Saturn. From 2 December 1839 to 6 March 1840 he discovered three new comets.

In 1845 Galle was awarded a Dr. phil. His doctoral thesis was a reduction and critical discussion of Ole Rømer&#x27;s observation of meridian transits of stars and planets on the days from 20 October to 23 October 1706.

===Discovery of Neptune===
Around the same time in 1845 he sent a copy of his thesis to Urbain Le Verrier, but only received an answer a year later. Sent on 18 September 1846, it reached Galle on the morning of 23 September. Le Verrier had been investigating the perturbations of the orbit of the planet Uranus and from this he derived the position of a still undiscovered planet, and requested Galle to search in the corresponding section of sky. The very same night (after Encke gave permission to search, against his own judgement), in collaboration with his assistant Heinrich Louis d&#x27;Arrest, Galle discovered a star of 8th magnitude, only 1° away from the calculated position, which was not recorded in the &quot;Berliner Akademischen Sternkarte&quot;. Over the next two evenings, a proper motion of the celestial object of 4 seconds of arc was measured, which determined it absolutely as a planet, for which Le Verrier proposed the name Neptune. Galle always refused to be acknowledged as the discoverer of Neptune; he attributed the discovery to Le Verrier.

In 1847 Galle was designated as the successor to Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel as Director of Königsberg Observatory. Before the enacted nomination from Friedrich Wilhelm IV effected &quot;de facto&quot;, Galle withdrew his application at the beginning of 1848 due to an intrigue against him led by Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi.

== Breslau Observatory ==

In 1851 he moved to Breslau (today Wrocław) to become the director of the local observatory, and in 1856 he became Professor of Astronomy at the Schlesischen Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität Breslau. He worked in Breslau for over 45 years. For the academic year 1875/76 he was elected Rector. At Breslau he dealt with the exact determination of planetary orbits and developed methods for calculating the height of the aurorae and the path of meteors, and consolidated the data for all 414 comets discovered up to 1894 into one work (with the help of his son). Otherwise he concerned himself with the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field and climatology. Altogether he published over 200 works.

==Later years==
In 1897 Galle returned to Potsdam, where he died in 1910 at the age of 98. He was survived by his wife and two sons, Andreas Galle and Georg Galle (1860–1946).

The town of Gräfenhainichen, which is close to his birthplace, erected a memorial to him in 1977.

Two craters, one on the Moon and the &quot;happy face&quot; one on Mars, the asteroid 2097 Galle, and a ring of Neptune have been named in his honor.

In Breslau (today Wrocław) itself, it was commemorated by naming one of the streets with his last name – &quot; Gallestrasse&quot;. This name was in force until the end of World War II. Its contemporary name is Wapienna (meaning &quot;Limestone&quot; in Polish) Street.

<text>Gruffudd ap Cynan (–1137) was King of Gwynedd from 1081 until his death in 1137. In the course of a long and eventful life, he became a key figure in Welsh resistance to Norman rule.

As a descendant of Rhodri Mawr (Rhodri the Great), Gruffudd ap Cynan was a senior member of the princely House of Aberffraw. Through his mother, Gruffudd had close family connections with the Norse settlement around Dublin and he frequently used Ireland as a refuge and as a source of troops. He three times gained the throne of Gwynedd and then lost it again, before regaining it once more in 1099 and this time keeping power until his death. Gruffudd laid the foundations which were built upon by his son Owain Gwynedd and his great-grandson Llywelyn ab Iorwerth (Llywelyn the Great).

== Life ==
Unusual for a Welsh king or prince, a near-contemporary biography of Gruffudd, &quot;The History of Gruffudd ap Cynan&quot;, has survived. Much of our knowledge of Gruffudd comes from this source. The traditional view among scholars was that it was written during the third quarter of the 12th century during the reign of Gruffudd&#x27;s son, Owain Gwynedd, but it has recently been suggested that it may date from the early reign of Llywelyn the Great, around 1200. The author is not known.

Most of the existing manuscripts of the history are in Welsh but these are clearly translations of a Latin original. It is usually considered that the original Latin version has been lost and that existing Latin versions are re-translations from the Welsh. However, Russell (2006) has suggested that the Latin version in Peniarth MS 434E incorporates the original Latin version, later amended to bring it into line with the Welsh text.

=== Ancestry ===
According to the &quot;Life of Gruffudd ap Cynan&quot;, Gruffudd was born in the Hiberno–Norse Kingdom of Dublin and reared near Swords, County Dublin in Ireland. He was the son of an exiled Welsh King as per the Life, Cynan ap Iago, who was a claimant to the kingship of Gwynedd but was probably never its king in actuality, though his father, Gruffudd&#x27;s grandfather, Iago ab Idwal ap Meurig, had ruled Gwynedd from 1023 to 1039. When Gruffudd first appeared on the scene in Wales the Welsh annals several times refer to him as &quot;grandson of Iago&quot; rather than the more usual &quot;son of Cynan&quot;, indicating that his father was little known in Wales. Cynan ap Iago seems to have died while Gruffudd was still young, since the &quot;History&quot; describes his mother telling him who his father was.

According to &quot;Historia Gruffud vab Kenan&quot;, Gruffudd&#x27;s mother was &quot;Ragnailt ingen Amlaíb&quot;, a granddaughter of King Sigtrygg Silkbeard and a member of the Hiberno-Norse Uí Ímair dynasty. The latter had two sons named Amlaíb: one died in 1013, whilst another died in 1034. Either man could have been Ragnailt&#x27;s father. An anecdote described here about &quot;Ragnailt ingen Amlaíb&quot; explained a prophecy in which an unnamed monk told her that great power would come to her son. However, this has been rejected by modern scholars as an embellishment by later writers.

During his many struggles to gain the kingship of Gwynedd, Gruffudd received considerable aid from Ireland, from the Hiberno-Norse at Dublin, the Isles and Wexford and from Muircheartach Ua Briain, because he was also descendant through his mother from Brian Boru, High King of Ireland.

=== First bid for the throne ===
Gruffudd first attempted to take over the rule of Gwynedd in 1075, following the death of Bleddyn ap Cynfyn. Trahaearn ap Caradog had seized control of Gwynedd but had not yet firmly established himself. Gruffudd landed on Abermenai Point, Anglesey with an Irish force, and with the assistance of troops provided by the Norman Robert of Rhuddlan first defeated and killed Cynwrig ap Rhiwallon, an ally of Trahaearn who held Llŷn, then defeated Trahaearn himself in the Battle of Gwaed Erw in Meirionnydd and gained control of Gwynedd. Gruffudd then led his forces eastwards to reclaim territories taken over by the Normans, and despite the assistance previously given by Robert of Rhuddlan attacked and destroyed Rhuddlan Castle. However tension between Gruffudd&#x27;s Danish-Irish bodyguard and the local Welsh led to a rebellion in Llŷn, and Trahaearn took the opportunity to counterattack, defeating Gruffudd at the Battle of Bron yr Erw above Clynnog Fawr the same year.

=== Second bid for the throne and capture by the Normans ===
Gruffudd fled to Ireland but, in 1081, returned and made an alliance with Rhys ap Tewdwr, prince of Deheubarth. Rhys had been attacked by Caradog ap Gruffudd of Gwent and Morgannwg, and had been forced to flee to St Davids Cathedral. Gruffudd this time embarked from Waterford with a force composed of Danes and Irish and landed near St Davids, presumably by prior arrangement with Rhys. He was joined here by a force of his supporters from Gwynedd, and he and Rhys marched north to seek Trahaearn ap Caradog and Caradog ap Gruffudd who had themselves made an alliance and been joined by Meilyr ap Rhiwallon of Powys. The armies of the two confederacies met at the Battle of Mynydd Carn, with Gruffudd and Rhys victorious and Trahaearn, Caradog and Meilyr all being killed. Gruffudd was thus able to seize power in Gwynedd for the second time.

He was soon faced with a new enemy, as the Normans were now encroaching on Gwynedd. Gruffudd had not been king very long when he was enticed to a meeting with Hugh d&#x27;Avranches, Earl of Chester and Hugh of Montgomery, 2nd Earl of Shrewsbury at Rhug, near Corwen. At the meeting, Gruffudd was seized and taken prisoner. According to his biographer, this was by the treachery of one of his own men, Meirion Goch. Gruffudd was imprisoned in Earl Hugh&#x27;s castle at Chester for many years while Earl Hugh and Robert of Rhuddlan went on to take possession of Gwynedd, building castles at Bangor, Caernarfon and Aberlleiniog.

=== Escape from captivity and third reign ===
Gruffudd reappeared on the scene years later, having escaped from captivity, he was free by 1094. Gruffudd again took refuge in Ireland but returned to Gwynedd to lead the assaults on Norman castles such as Castell Aberlleiniog. The Welsh revolt had begun in 1094 and by late 1095 had spread to many parts of Wales. This induced William II of England (William Rufus) to intervene, invading North Wales in 1095. However, his army was unable to bring the Welsh to battle and returned to Chester without having achieved very much. King William mounted a second invasion in 1097, but again without much success. The &quot;History&quot; only mentions one invasion by Rufus, which could indicate that Gruffudd did not feature in the resistance to the first invasion. At this time Cadwgan ap Bleddyn of Powys led the Welsh resistance.

In the summer of 1098, Earl Hugh of Chester joined with Earl Hugh of Shrewsbury in another attempt to recover his losses in Gwynedd. Gruffudd and his ally Cadwgan ap Bleddyn retreated to Anglesey, but were then forced to flee to Ireland in a skiff when a fleet he had hired from the Danish settlement in Ireland accepted a better offer from the Normans and changed sides.

=== King for the fourth time and consolidation ===
The Normans were obliged to evacuate Anglesey, and the following year, Gruffudd returned from Ireland to take possession again, having apparently come to an agreement with Earl Hugh of Chester. The situation was changed by the arrival of a Norwegian fleet under the command of King Magnus Barefoot (Magnus III of Norway) who attacked the Norman forces near the eastern end of the Menai Strait. Earl Hugh of Shrewsbury was killed by an arrow said to have been shot by Magnus himself.

With the death of Hugh of Chester in 1101, Gruffudd was able to consolidate his position in Gwynedd, as much by diplomacy as by force. He met King Henry I of England who granted him the rule of Llŷn, Eifionydd, Ardudwy and Arllechwedd, considerably extending his kingdom. By 1114, he had gained enough power to induce King Henry to invade Gwynedd, one detachment led by King Alexander I of Scotland. Faced with overwhelming force, Gruffudd was obliged to pay homage to Henry and to pay a heavy fine but lost no territory.

The Kingdom was expanded by his sons, Owain Gwynedd and later Cadwaladr, by Gruffudd&#x27;s last years &quot;Ceredigion, Meirionnydd, Rhos, Rhufoniog and Dyffryn Clwyd were under the rule of Gwynedd&quot;. The cantrefs of Rhos and Rhufoniog were annexed in 1118, Meirionnydd captured from Powys in 1123, and Dyffryn Clwyd in 1124. Another invasion by King Henry I in 1121 ultimately ended in military failure. The king had to come to terms with Gruffudd and made no further attempt to invade Gwynedd during Gruffudd&#x27;s reign. The death of Cadwallon in a battle against the forces of Powys near Llangollen in 1132 checked further expansion for the time being.

Gruffudd was now powerful enough to ensure that his nominee David the Scot was consecrated as Bishop of Bangor in 1120. The see had been effectively vacant since bishop Hervey le Breton had been forced to flee by the Welsh almost twenty years before, since Gruffudd and King Henry could not agree on a candidate. David went on to rebuild Bangor Cathedral with a large financial contribution from Gruffudd.

Owain and Cadwaladr, in alliance with Gruffudd ap Rhys of Deheubarth, gained a crushing victory over the Normans at Crug Mawr, near Cardigan, in 1136 and took possession of Ceredigion. The latter part of Gruffydd&#x27;s reign was considered to be a &quot;Golden Age&quot;; according to the &quot;Life of Gruffudd ap Cynan&quot; Gwynedd was &quot;bespangled with lime-washed churches like the stars in the firmament&quot;.

== Death and succession ==
Gruffudd died in his bed, old and blind in 1137, and was mourned by the annalist of &quot;Brut y Tywysogion&quot; as the &quot;head and king and defender and pacifier of all Wales&quot;. He was buried by the high altar in Bangor Cathedral, which he had been involved in rebuilding. He also made bequests to many other churches, including one to Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin where he had worshipped as a boy. An elegy was sung for him by the poet Meilyr Brydydd, his wife Angharad survived him by 25 years. He was succeeded as king of Gwynedd by his son Owain Gwynedd. His daughter Gwenllian, who married Gruffudd ap Rhys of Deheubarth, son of his old ally Rhys ap Tewdwr, is also notable for her resistance to Norman rule.

== Legacy ==
According to Hywel Teifi Edwards, Gruffudd, according to legend, not only reformed the Welsh bardic tradition to accord with that of the Irish language bards but also sponsored an Eisteddfod at Caerwys during his reign as King of Gwynedd.

== Children ==
The family line of Gruffudd shows he had many children by several different women. With wife Angharad (daughter of Owain ab Edwin) he had:
* Cadwallon ap Gruffudd;
* Owain Gwynedd (Owain ap Gruffudd), married (1) Gwladus (Gladys) ferch Llywarch, daughter of Llywarch ap Trahaearn (2) Cristin ferch Goronwy, daughter of Goronwy ab Owain;
* Cadwaladr ap Gruffudd, married Alice de Clare, daughter of Richard Fitz Gilbert de Clare;
* Mareda/Marared ferch Gruffudd;
* Susanna ferch Gruffudd, married Madog ap Maredudd, prince of Powys;
* Ranulht/Rannillt ferch Gruffudd, married Madog ap Idnerth, King of Cynllibiwg;
* Agnes/Annest ferch Gruffudd;
* Gwenllian ferch Gruffudd, married Gruffydd ap Rhys, prince of Deheubarth.

The FitzRery family of Swords, County Dublin, who were prominent in Dublin politics and commercial life until the seventeenth century, claimed descent from Gruffudd: since he was born in Swords, and maintained close links with Ireland, the claim is not implausible.

<text>George Ogden Abell (March 27, 1927 – October 7, 1983) was an American astronomer and professor. He taught at UCLA, primarily as a research astronomer. He earned his B.S. in 1951, his M.S. in 1952 and his Ph.D. in 1957, all from Caltech. He was a Ph.D. student under Donald Osterbrock. His astronomy career began as a tour guide at the Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles. Abell made great contributions to astronomical knowledge which resulted from his work during and after the National Geographic Society - Palomar Observatory Sky Survey, especially concerning clusters of galaxies and planetary nebulae. A galaxy, an asteroid, a periodic comet, and an observatory are all named in his honor. His teaching career extended beyond the campus of UCLA to the high school student oriented Summer Science Program, and educational television. He not only taught about science but also about what is not science. He was an originating member of the Committee on Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal now known as the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry.

==Early life==
George Ogden Abell was born in Los Angeles on March 1, 1927, to Theodore Curtis Abell and Annamarie (Ogden) Abell. Theodore Abell was born in Waterbury, Connecticut, in 1890, was a Unitarian minister, and was one of the original members of the Hollywood Humanist Society. Annamarie was born in Kansas City, Missouri, in 1896, and studied to be a librarian, worked for a short while as a librarian but eventually became a social worker. George Ogden Abell was named for his mother&#x27;s brother, George Ogden.

Theodore and Annamarie divorced when Abell was 6 years old. Annamarie and son went to live with her father, also George Ogden, who was an author of western novels. Theodore maintained regular contact with Abell and took him to many museums and to Griffith Observatory and planetarium when he was about 8, soon after it opened. This prompted Abell to start reading books on astronomy. Abell attended Van Nuys High School where he achieved all As in all math and science courses that he took.

As a youth, Abell held many part-time jobs, he had a newspaper delivery as well as mail route, worked in a bowling alley, a restaurant, grocery store, and did home maintenance work.

==Military service==
Abell enlisted in the US Army Air Corps after he graduated from high school in 1945 in the waning days of World War II. He took the tests that qualified him for training as a pilot, navigator or bombardier, but the war ended and those schools were shut down before he could begin training.

Instead, he went to weather school at Chanute Field in Illinois. On finishing that, he had the option of staying at Chanute Field to attend forecasting school, but that would have entailed becoming an officer and staying in the Army longer. Since the war was over, getting out of the Army as soon as possible seemed more important to him, so he opted to forego forecasting school. Instead he was sent to Japan, where he served as an Air Corps weatherman for six months before being discharged after 18 months of total service.

==Education==
Upon leaving the Air Corps, Abell returned to Los Angeles and worked as a gas station attendant while waiting to start school at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech). At Caltech, Abell studied physics his freshman year. However, the next year Caltech inaugurated its astronomy department and as a sophomore he switched majors to astronomy. As an undergraduate student, Abell lived in Caltech&#x27;s Fleming House and bowled on the Fleming House bowling team. Abell participated in the Drama Club, and was president of the club for one year. He also wrote the music column for Caltech&#x27;s weekly newspaper, &quot;The California Tech&quot;, and worked at Griffith Observatory as a guide while an undergrad student.

Abell received his Bachelor of Science degree in astronomy in 1951. He then continued at Caltech for graduate studies in astronomy. He received a Master of Science in 1952 and a Ph.D. in 1957. He was the first Ph.D. student of Donald Osterbrock. During his graduate student days he worked at Griffith Observatory as a lecturer.

==Career==
===Palomar sky survey===
Abell&#x27;s first professional astronomical occupation came as a Caltech grad student when he was an observer on the National Geographic Society – Palomar Observatory Sky Survey. Several scientific advances came out of this work including,
* The Abell catalog of 2,712 rich clusters of galaxies, which include Abell 68.
* The recognition of second order clusters of the clusters of galaxies, which also disproved Carl Charlier&#x27;s hierarchical model.
* The study of luminosity of clusters showing how they can be used for determination of relative distances.
* A list of 86 planetary nebulae which includes Abell 39.
* Recognition that planetary nebulae derive from red giant stars, together with Peter Goldreich, of UCLA,
* With Robert G. Harrington discovered periodic comet 52P/Harrington-Abell.

An extended version of the clusters of galaxies catalogue was published after Abell&#x27;s death in 1987 under the authorship of Abell, Harold G. Corwin and Ronald P. Olowin. This extended catalog includes clusters seen from the southern hemisphere, lists approximately 4,000 clusters of galaxies and includes thirty members with a redshift up to z = 0.2. (See List of Abell clusters.)

===Teaching===

====UCLA====
Abell taught at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) for 17 years where he was known as an outstanding and brilliant teacher. He believed that the cornerstone of teaching science is to present how and why the facts are known to be facts; and not in the mere presentation of facts that might amaze, sensationalize, entertain but not enlighten the listener.

Abell chaired the UCLA Astronomy Department for seven years 1968 to 1975. He also served on several university committees and commissions, such as,
* Faculty Senate
** Committee on Parking and Transportation (1959)
** Chairman of the Graduate Council (1964-1965)
** Chairman of the Committee on Athletics (1968-1969)
** Chairman of the Los Angeles Division (1972-1973)

During the period of student unrest in the 1960s Abell was an active member and organizer of the unofficial Committee for Responsible University Government. This was due to his belief that faculty and administration standards were weakening as a result of the unrest.

====Summer science program====

Abell was a leader and teacher in the Summer Science Program for talented high school students. At Thatcher School in Ojai, California, he and others taught college-level physics, mathematics and astronomy to these students. A number of them went on to pursue distinguished careers in science. One such is Ed Krupp the long-time director of Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles.

====Other teaching methods====
Abell also lectured at other venues, specifically at many small colleges that lacked astronomy departments. He also strove to bring the stories of science and astronomy to the people through public lectures.

He wrote several books including &quot;Exploration of the Universe&quot; a textbook widely used in undergraduate astronomy courses.

He helped produce educational TV programs/series such as &quot;Project Universe&quot; and &quot;Understanding Space and Time&quot;. He also appeared in some of these as himself, an astronomer. &quot;Project Universe&quot; was a 30 part introductory course on astronomy that featured Ed Krupp director of Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles. Abell and Julian Schwinger created &quot;Understanding Space and Time&quot; in 16 parts to explain in layman&#x27;s terms celestial mechanics, relativity, and the large scale structure of the universe.

===Skepticism===
Abell was not just a teacher of astronomy and science, he also taught about popular topics with no scientific evidence. He was a debunker of astrology, pseudoscience, and the occult. In a tribute to Abell in &quot;The Quarterly Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society&quot;, Lawrence H. Aller wrote,
His opposition to such forces took many forms, in writings, and in television appearances. He was one of the co-founders of the Committee on Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal now known as CSI, the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry.

Abell was a contributor to the organization&#x27;s journal &quot;Skeptical Inquirer&quot;.

==Astronomical namesakes==
There are several astronomical bodies named for George Abell, as well as an earthbound observatory.
* The Abell Galaxy, which, for many years, was the largest known astronomical object.
* Asteroid (3449)Abell
* Periodic comet 52P/Harrington-Abell, which Abell co-discovered with Robert Harrington
* George Abell Observatory, Open University, Milton Keynes, United Kingdom

==Affiliations==

** Councilor 1969-1972
** Education Committee, Chairman
* Astronomical Society of the Pacific
** President 1969-1971
** Member Board of Directors 1982-1984

==Personal life==
Abell was married twice. The first marriage occurred right after his graduation from Caltech. His first wife was a school teacher and they had two sons together named Anthony and Jonathan. This marriage ended after 19 years with the sons remaining with their father. Abell&#x27;s second wife, Phyllis, was a painter who studied three years at the Philadelphia Museum School of Art but did not graduate.

Abell enjoyed many hobbies during his lifetime such as, softball, bowling, music concerts and grand opera (on which he was considered an authority), record collecting, and literature. He was an avid baseball fan, frequently in attendance at Los Angeles Dodgers games.

Abell died at home on October 7, 1983, after suffering a heart attack.

<text>The Helix Nebula (also known as NGC 7293 or Caldwell 63) is a planetary nebula (PN) located in the constellation Aquarius. Discovered by Karl Ludwig Harding, most likely before 1824, this object is one of the closest of all the bright planetary nebulae to Earth. The distance, measured by the &quot;Gaia&quot; mission, is 655±13 light-years. It is similar in appearance to the Cat&#x27;s Eye Nebula and the Ring Nebula, whose size, age, and physical characteristics are in turn similar to the Dumbbell Nebula, differing only in their relative proximity and the appearance from the equatorial viewing angle. The Helix Nebula has sometimes been referred to as the &quot;Eye of God&quot; in pop culture, as well as the &quot;Eye of Sauron&quot;.

==General information==
The Helix Nebula is an example of a planetary nebula, formed by an intermediate to low-mass star, which sheds its outer layers near the end of its evolution. Gases from the star in the surrounding space appear, from Earth&#x27;s perspective, a helix structure. The remnant central stellar core, known as the central star (CS) of the planetary nebula, is destined to become a white dwarf star. The observed glow of the central star is so energetic that it causes the previously expelled gases to brightly fluoresce.

The nebula is in the constellation of Aquarius, and lies about 650 light-years away, spanning about 0.8 parsecs (2.5 light-years). Its age is estimated to be years, based on the ratio of its size to its measured expansion rate of 31 km·s−1.

==Structure==


The Helix Nebula is thought to be shaped like a prolate spheroid with strong density concentrations toward the filled disk along the equatorial plane, whose major axis is inclined about 21° to 37° from our vantage point. The size of the inner disk is 8×19 arcmin in diameter (0.52 pc); the outer torus is 12×22 arcmin in diameter (0.77 pc); and the outer-most ring is about 25 arcmin in diameter (1.76 pc). The outer-most ring appears flattened on one side due to it colliding with the ambient interstellar medium.

Expansion of the whole planetary nebula structure is estimated to have occurred in the last 6,560 years, and 12,100 years for the inner disk. Spectroscopically, the outer ring&#x27;s expansion rate is 40 km/s, and about 32 km/s for the inner disk.

===Knots===
The Helix Nebula was the first planetary nebula discovered to contain cometary knots. Its main ring contains knots of nebulosity, which have now been detected in several nearby planetary nebulae, especially those with a molecular envelope like the Ring nebula and the Dumbbell Nebula.

These knots are radially symmetric (from the CS) and are described as &quot;cometary&quot;, each centered on a core of neutral molecular gas and containing bright local photoionization fronts or cusps towards the central star and tails away from it. All tails extend away from the Planetary Nebula Nucleus (PNN) in a radial direction. Excluding the tails, each knot is approximately the size of the Solar System, while each of the cusp knots are optically thick due to Lyc photons from the CS. There are about 40,000 cometary knots in the Helix Nebula.

The knots are probably the result of Rayleigh-Taylor instability. The low density, high expansion velocity ionized inner nebula is accelerating the denser, slowly expanding, largely neutral material which had been shed earlier when the star was on the Asymptotic Giant Branch.

The excitation temperature varies across the Helix nebula. The rotational-vibrational temperature ranges from 1800 K in a cometary knot located in the inner region of the nebula are about 2.5&#x27;(arcmin) from the CS, and is calculated at about 900 K in the outer region at the distance of 5.6&#x27;.

==Central star==
The central star of the Helix Nebula is a white dwarf of spectral type DAO. It has the designations WD 2226-210, PHL 287, and GJ 9785. The star has a radius of , a mass of , a temperature of 120,000 Kelvin and has an apparent magnitude of 13.5.

A 2024 study hypothesized that the central star might be orbited by a planet based on periodic variations in its light curve, but it cannot be ruled out that these variations are due to intrinstic stellar variability. Assuming an inclination of 25° (aligned with the nebula itself), this hypothetical planet is estimated to have a radius of , or about 2.3 times the radius of Earth.

<doc id="206635" wikidata="Q357839" url="?curid=206635" title="Walter M. Miller Jr.">
<text>Walter Michael Miller Jr. (January 23, 1923 – January 9, 1996) was an American science fiction writer. His fix-up novel, &quot;A Canticle for Leibowitz&quot; (1959), the only novel published in his lifetime, won the 1961 Hugo Award for Best Novel. Prior to its publication, he was a writer of short stories.

==Early life==
Miller was born on January 23, 1923, in New Smyrna Beach, Florida. Educated at the University of Tennessee and the University of Texas, he worked as an engineer. During World War II, he served in the Army Air Forces as a radioman and tail gunner, flying more than fifty bombing missions over Italy. He took part in the bombing of the Benedictine Abbey at Monte Cassino, which proved a traumatic experience for him. Joe Haldeman reported that Miller &quot;had post-traumatic stress disorder for 30 years before it had a name&quot;, and that Miller displayed a photograph he had taken of Ron Kovic prominently in his living room.

After the war, Miller converted to Catholicism. He married Anna Louise Becker in 1945 and they had four children. He lived with science-fiction writer Judith Merril in 1953.

==Career==
Between 1951 and 1957, Miller published over three dozen science fiction short stories, winning a Hugo Award in 1955 for the story &quot;The Darfsteller&quot;. He also wrote scripts for the television show &quot;Captain Video&quot; in 1953.

Late in the 1950s, Miller assembled a novel from three closely related novellas he had published in &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction&quot; in 1955, 1956 and 1957. The novel, entitled &quot;A Canticle for Leibowitz&quot;, was published in 1959. It is a post-apocalyptic novel revolving around the canonisation of Saint Leibowitz, and is considered a masterpiece of the genre. It won the 1961 Hugo Award for Best Novel.

After the success of &quot;A Canticle for Leibowitz&quot;, Miller ceased publishing, although several compilations of Miller&#x27;s earlier stories were issued in the 1960s and 1970s. A radio adaptation of &quot;A Canticle for Leibowitz&quot; was produced by WHA Radio and NPR in 1981. A radio adaptation of the first two parts was broadcast in the UK by the BBC in 1992; further details can be found on the BBC Genome Project.

==Later years and death==
In Miller&#x27;s later years, he became a recluse, avoiding contact with nearly everyone, including family members; he never allowed his literary agent, Don Congdon, to meet him. According to science fiction writer Terry Bisson, Miller struggled with depression, but had managed to nearly complete a 600-page manuscript for the sequel to &quot;Canticle&quot; before taking his own life with a firearm on January 9, 1996, shortly after his wife&#x27;s death.

The sequel, &quot;Saint Leibowitz and the Wild Horse Woman&quot;, was completed by Bisson at Miller&#x27;s request and published in 1997.

<text>USS &quot;Langley&quot; (CVL-27) was an light aircraft carrier that served the United States Navy from 1943 to 1947, and French Navy as from 1951 to 1963.

== Career ==
&quot;Langley&quot; was named for Samuel Pierpont Langley, American scientist and aviation pioneer. She carried on the name and tradition of , the first U.S. Navy aircraft carrier, which had been sunk on 27 February 1942. The ship was originally ordered as a light cruiser and named &quot;Fargo&quot; (CL‑85). She was laid down as USS &quot;Crown Point&quot; (CV‑27) by New York Shipbuilding Corporation, Camden, New Jersey United States on 11 April 1942 and renamed &quot;Langley&quot; on 13 November 1942.

===1943===
&quot;Langley&quot; was launched on 22 May 1943 and commissioned on 31 August 1943, Captain W.M. Dillon in command. After shakedown in the Caribbean Sea, &quot;Langley&quot; departed Philadelphia on 6 December 1943 for Pearl Harbor, where she participated in training operations.

===1944===
On 19 January 1944, she sailed with Task Force 58 (TF 58) for the attack on the Marshall Islands. From 29 January to 6 February, &quot;Langley&quot;″s Carrier Air Group 32 (CVG-32) conducted raids on Wotje and Taroa Island to support the landings at Kwajalein, and from 10 through 28 February at Eniwetok. After a brief respite at Espiritu Santo, New Hebrides, &quot;Langley&quot;″s aircraft hit Japanese positions on Palau, Yap, and Woleai, Caroline Islands, from 30 March to 1 April. She next proceeded to New Guinea to take part in the capture of Hollandia on 25 April. A mere 4 days later, the carrier engaged in the 2‑day strike against the Japanese bastion Truk. During the raid, &quot;Langley&quot; and her aircraft accounted for some 35 enemy planes destroyed or damaged, while losing only one aircraft herself.

&quot;Langley&quot; next departed Majuro on 7 June 1944 for the Mariana and Palau Islands campaign. On 11 June, TF 58 launched a strike of 208 fighters and eight torpedo bombers against enemy bases and airfields on Saipan and Tinian. From 11 June to 8 August, &quot;Langley&quot; operated with TF 58 and also took part in the Battle of the Philippine Sea, 19 to 20 June 1944.

The carrier departed Eniwetok on 29 August and sortied with TF 38, under the command of Adm. William F. Halsey for air assaults on Peleliu and airfields in the Philippines as the preliminary steps in the invasion of the Palaus from 15 to 20 September 1944. During October, she operated off Formosa and the Pescadores Islands. Later in the month, TF 38 supported the landings on Leyte. The Japanese efforts to stop the U.S. advance included the counterattack by most available major fleet units (&quot;Operation Sho-Go&quot;). On 24 October, &quot;Langley&quot;″s planes took part in the Battle of the Sibuyan Sea. Aircraft of TF 38 attacked the Japanese Center Force, as it steamed toward the San Bernardino Strait and the American beachhead at Tacloban. The Japanese units temporarily retired. The following day, upon word of Japanese aircraft carriers north of Leyte, TF 38 raced to intercept. In the ensuing Battle off Cape Engaño, the Japanese lost four carriers, two battleships, four heavy cruisers, one light cruiser, and five destroyers. &quot;Langley&quot;″s aircraft assisted in the destruction of the carriers &quot;Zuihō&quot; and &quot;Zuikaku&quot;, the latter being the only remaining carrier of the six that had participated in the Pearl Harbor attack.
During November 1944, &quot;Langley&quot; supported the Philippine landings and strikes the Manila Bay area. Aircraft of &quot;Langley&quot;″s CVG-44 attacked Japanese reinforcement convoys, and airfields on Luzon and in the Cape Engaño area. On 1 December, the carrier withdrew to Ulithi for reprovisioning.

===1945===
During January 1945, &quot;Langley&quot; participated in the South China Sea raid supporting Invasion of Lingayen Gulf. Raids were made against Formosa, French Indochina, and the China coast from 30 December 1944 to 25 January 1945. &quot;Langley″s&quot; task group was attacked by two dive bombers on 21 January. One bomb struck the center of &quot;Langley″s&quot; flight deck forward and penetrated to the gallery deck to explode among the officers&#x27; staterooms just aft of the forecastle. The fire was quickly extinguished, and the flight deck repaired to continue flight operations. The second bomber inflicted greater damage on .

&quot;Langley&quot; next joined in the sweeps against Tokyo and Nansei Shoto in support of the landings on Iwo Jima between 10 February and 18 March 1945. She next raided airfields on the Japanese homeland, and arrived off Okinawa on 23 March. Until 11 May, the ship operated either off Okinawa or took part in strikes on Kyushu, Japan, in an effort to destroy kamikaze bases in southern Japan which were launching desperate and deadly suicide attacks.

After touching Ulithi and Pearl Harbor, she steamed to San Francisco, arriving on 3 June for repairs and modernization at the Hunters Point Naval Shipyard. She departed 1 August and reached Pearl Harbor on 8 August 1945. While there, word arrived that hostilities had ended. She completed two &quot;Magic Carpet&quot; voyages to the Pacific, transporting soldiers back to the United States, and got underway on 1 October for Philadelphia.

===1946===
She departed from that port 15 November for the first of two trips to Europe transporting U.S. Army troops returning home from that theater. She returned to Philadelphia on 6 January 1946 and was assigned to the Atlantic Reserve Fleet, Philadelphia Group, on 31 May 1946. &quot;Langley&quot; was decommissioned on 11 February 1947.

== Transfer to France ==

&quot;Langley&quot; was taken out of &quot;mothballs&quot;, refurbished and transferred to France under the Mutual Defense Assistance Program on 8 January 1951. After more than a decade of French Navy service as , she was returned to the United States on 20 March 1963 and sold to the Boston Metals Co., Baltimore, Maryland, for scrapping.

<text>Messenia or Messinia ( ; ) is a regional unit (&quot;perifereiaki enotita&quot;) in the southwestern part of the Peloponnese region, in Greece. Until the implementation of the Kallikratis plan on 1 January 2011, Messenia was a prefecture (&quot;nomos&quot;) covering the same territory. The capital and largest city of Messenia is Kalamata.

==Geography==

===Physical===
Messenia borders on Elis to the north, Arcadia to the northeast, and Laconia to the southeast. The Ionian Sea lies to the west, and the Gulf of Messinia to the south. The most important mountain ranges are the Taygetus in the east, the Kyparissia mountains in the northwest and the Lykodimo in the southwest. The main rivers are the Neda in the north and the Pamisos in central Messenia.

Off the south coast of the southwesternmost point of Messenia lie the Messinian Oinousses islands. The largest of these are Sapientza, Schiza and Venetiko. The small island Sphacteria closes off the bay of Pylos. All these islands are virtually uninhabited.

Climate may vary, in the lowlands, temperatures are a bit warmer than Athens. Snow is not common during winter months except for the mountains, especially the Taygetus. Rain and clouds are common inland.

===Political===

==== Organization of Messenia ====
Before the 2010 reorganization, Messenia was a &quot;nomos&quot; (prefecture) containing 29 &quot;dimoi&quot; (municipalities) and 2 &quot;koinotites&quot; (communities). Since 2010, Messenia has been a &quot;perifereiake enoteta&quot; (regional unit) containing only 6 municipalities, but with the same population, as it did not change area in the reorganization. Some 25 municipalities and communities were incorporated politically into the other 6 according to the table below, becoming municipal units.

==== Provinces ====

The prefecture of Messenia was previously subdivided into four provinces (, &quot;eparchies&quot;) :
*Province of Kalamon - Kalamata
*Province of Messini - Messine
*Province of Pylia - Pylos
*Province of Trifylia - Kyparissia

Like all provinces of Greece, they were abolished after the 2006 local elections, in line with Law 2539/1997, as part of the &quot;Kapodistrias reform&quot;. Some of the enlarged municipalities (&quot;demoi&quot;) created in 2011 have a territory similar to the former provinces.

=== Population ===
The main cities and towns of Messenia are (ranked by 2021 census population):
*Kalamata 57,706
*Messini 5,744
*Kyparissia 4,893
*Gargalianoi 4,399
*Filiatra 4,373

==Economy==

The economy of Messenia is primarily based on agricultural production although in recent years efforts are being made toward the development of activities in other sectors such as tourism.

Main agricultural products are olive oil, Kalamata table olives, figs, and black raisins (sultanas). The variety of agricultural products is complemented by a small amount of stockbreeding products (beef, milk, sfela cheese, honey) and fish from the Gulf of Messenia.

The tourist development observed is mainly attributable to the promotion of important archaeological sites, such as the Palace of Nestor, Ancient Messene, and the Venetian castles of Pylos, Koroni, Methoni and Kalamata, as well as to the beauty of the landscape. 
Another key factor for Messenia&#x27;s economy is Costa Navarino a location on the border between Pylos and Trifylia, comprising several eco-friendly luxury resorts and golf courses, which is Greece&#x27;s biggest tourist development.

There are many small- and medium-size firms involved in the processing and standardization of agricultural products as well as a number of enterprises devoted to wood processing, furniture manufacturing, and metal construction. The Karelia tobacco company is based in Kalamata.

===Transport===

The main airport in Messenia is Kalamata International Airport (KLX).

The main highways in Messenia are:
*Greek National Road 7 (Corinth - Tripoli - Kalamata)
*Greek National Road 9 (Patras - Pyrgos - Kyparissia - Pylos)
*Greek National Road 82 (Pylos - Kalamata - Sparti)

The main railways in Messenia (meter gauge) are:
*Corinth - Argos - Tripoli - Zevgolateio - Kalamata
*Patras - Pyrgos - Kalo Nero - Kyparissia
*Kalo Nero - Zevgolateio

==History==
===Ancient period===
Messenia is mentioned in the oldest work of European literature, the &quot;Iliad&quot;. The name undoubtedly goes back to at least the Bronze Age, but its origins are lost in the world of mythology. The region was one of the largest that was conquered and enslaved as helots by ancient Sparta.

===Medieval period===
In the Middle Ages, Messenia shared the fortunes of the rest of the Peloponnese. Striking reminders of these conflicts are afforded by the extant ruins of the medieval strongholds of Kalamata, Coron (anc. Asine, mod. Koroni), Modon (Methoni) and Pylos. Messenia was a part of the Byzantine Empire until 1205, and of the Principality of Achaea thereafter, while the ports of Coron and Modon came under Venetian control. Apart from Coron and Modon, the rest of Messenia was captured by the Byzantine Despotate of the Morea in 1430.

===Ottoman and Venetian period===
Much of Messenia fell into the hands of the Ottoman Empire in 1460, a part of the area remained with the Venetian Republic until the Second Ottoman–Venetian War (1499–1503). In 1534 a group of families, known as the &#x27;Coroni&#x27;, settled in Piana degli Albanesi in Sicily. They were Arvanites and Greeks from Koroni.

During the 1680s, the whole of Messenia was regained by the Venetian Republic in the Morean War, and formed part of the &quot;Kingdom of the Morea&quot; until recovered by the Ottomans in 1715. The Mani Peninsula, a part of modern Messenia, remained autonomous from Turkish rule.

===Modern period===
Messenia became part of independent Greece as a result of the Greek War of Independence (1821-1832). The famous naval Battle of Navarino took place near present Pylos in 1827, and was a decisive victory for Greece and its allies.

During the World War II several battles of the Greek Resistance against the Nazi occupation forces and the collaborationist security battalions took place in Messenia, including Battle of Meligalas, Battle of Kalamata, Battle of Chora - Agorelitsa.

The population in the area of Kalamata and Messene increased from 30,000 before World War II up to nearly 80,000 in the present day. Messenia suffered damage from the 2007 Greek forest fires.

<text>Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue () is an on-island suburb located at the western tip of the Island of Montreal in southwestern Quebec, Canada. It is the second oldest community in Montreal&#x27;s West Island, having been founded as a parish in 1703. The oldest, Dorval, was founded in 1667.

Points of interest include the Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue Canal (a National Historic Site of Canada), the Sainte-Anne Veterans&#x27; Hospital, the Morgan Arboretum, and the L&#x27;Anse-à-l&#x27;Orme Nature Park. Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue is also home to John Abbott College and McGill University&#x27;s Macdonald Campus, which includes the J. S. Marshall Radar Observatory and the Canadian Aviation Heritage Centre as well as about of farmland which separates the small town from neighbouring Baie-d&#x27;Urfé.

==History==

Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue was established on a location once known and frequented by both the Algonquin and Iroquois peoples. Situated between two important lakes (Lac des Deux-Montagnes and Lac Saint Louis) and near the confluence of two important rivers (the Saint Lawrence River and the Ottawa River) both nations recognized its natural strategic advantages and had names for the place. The oral records show that it was named “Tiotenactokte” by the Algonquin, which means &quot;place of the last encampments&quot; and that the Iroquois called it “Skanawetsy” meaning &quot;white waters, after the rapids&quot;.

In 1663, the Saint-Louis Mission was founded in the west end of Montreal Island at Pointe-Caron (site of the present-day Baie-d&#x27;Urfé yacht club), and was led by François-Saturnin Lascaris d&#x27;Urfé. At that time, the mission included the entire area from the tip of Montreal Island to Pointe-Claire, Île Perrot, Soulanges, Vaudreuil, and Île aux Tourtes.

In 1672, King Louis XIV of France granted fiefdoms bordering on Lake of Two Mountains and Lake Saint-Louis to Louis de Berthé, Lord of Chailly, and to his brother Gabriel, Lord of La Joubardière. One of these adjacent fiefdoms was called Bellevue, due to its good views to the east and west. In 1677, the Parish of Saint-Louis-du-Bout-de-l&#x27;Île, sometimes also called Saint-Louis-du-Haut-de-l&#x27;Île, was founded. Jean de Lalonde was the first church warden. One September 30, 1687, Lalonde and four other parishioners were killed in a skirmish with the Iroquois. In 1703, the parish was closed and its registers moved to Lachine because of the constant threat from the Iroquois.

Around 1712, René-Charles de Breslay (1658–1735), local parish priest from 1703 to 1719, got caught in a fierce snowstorm. He fell from his horse, broke his leg on the ice, and lost the horse. Breslay was allegedly saved through the intervention by Saint Anne, after which he built a chapel dedicated to her at the westernmost point of Montreal Island next to Fort Senneville and Tourtes Island (&quot;Île aux Tourtes&quot;). Two years later, the parish was reestablished and took the name Sainte-Anne-du-Bout-de-l&#x27;Île.

From the early 1800s the town became a place of literary pilgrimage after Thomas Moore the famous Irish composer wrote one of his most celebrated works &quot;Canadian Boat Song&quot; here.

In 1835, the local post office opened. In 1843, the Sainte-Anne Canal was completed, resulting in a large number of travellers and merchants passing through the village. Another impetus to its development came a few years later in 1854, when the Grand Trunk Railway was built through the area, followed by the Canadian Pacific Railway in 1887.

In 1845, the place was first incorporated as the Municipality of Bout-de-l&#x27;Isle. This was abolished two years later, but in 1855, it was reestablished as the Parish Municipality of Sainte-Anne-en-l&#x27;Isle-de-Montréal. In 1878, the main settlement was incorporated as a separate village municipality, and the parish municipality was renamed to Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue that same year. The village municipality changed its status to town (&quot;ville&quot;) on January 12, 1895.

The early 20th century saw several developments in Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue: the Macdonald College (affiliated to the McGill University) was established in 1907; the Federal Government built Ste. Anne&#x27;s Veteran Hospital in 1917; the Galipeault Bridge was built in 1924 and doubled in 1964, linking Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue with Île Perrot. One of Canada&#x27;s earliest Garden City experiments was undertaken in Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue by John James Harpell, an industrialist, who around 1918 developed the neighbourhood of Gardenvale. The neighbourhood was granted its own post office in 1920.

In 1911, the parish municipality lost part of its territory when Baie-d&#x27;Urfé became a separate municipality. In 1964, the town of Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue annexed the parish municipality.

On January 1, 2002, as part of the 2002–2006 municipal reorganization of Montreal, Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue was merged into the city of Montreal and became part of the borough of L&#x27;Île-Bizard–Sainte-Geneviève–Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue. However, after a change of government and a 2004 referendum, it was re-constituted as an independent city on January 1, 2006.

<text>Durham Cathedral, formally the , is a Church of England cathedral in the city of Durham, England. The cathedral is the seat of the bishop of Durham and is the mother church of the diocese of Durham. It also contains the shrines of the Anglo-Saxon saints Cuthbert and Bede. There are daily Church of England services at the cathedral, and it received 727,367 visitors in 2019. It is a grade I listed building and forms part of the Durham Castle and Cathedral World Heritage Site.

The cathedral is the successor to the Anglo-Saxon Lindisfarne Priory, which was established but abandoned in 875 in the face of Viking raids. The monks settled at Chester-le-Street from 882 until 995, when they moved to Durham. The cathedral remained a monastery until it was dissolved in 1541, since when it has been governed by a dean and chapter. The cathedral precinct formed part of Durham Castle from the eleventh century. During the Wars of the Three Kingdoms the cathedral housed 3,000 Scottish prisoners of war, 1,700 of whom died in the building.

The present building was substantially completed between 1093 and 1133, replacing the Anglo-Saxon &#x27;White Church&#x27;. It is a significant example of the Romanesque architectural style, and the nave ceiling is the earliest surviving example of a pointed rib vault. The Galilee chapel was added to the west end of the cathedral in the 1170s, and the western towers built in approximately 1200. The east end was expanded in the Early English Gothic style in the 1230s, and the Perpendicular Gothic central tower was built in two stages in the fifteenth century. Important furnishings include the medieval bishop&#x27;s throne and Neville screen, Prior Castell&#x27;s Clock, and the seventeenth-century choir stalls and font cover installed by Bishop Cosin. Many of the monastic buildings survive; the monks&#x27; refectory now contains part of the cathedral library, which holds significant collections dating back to the sixth century.

==History==

===Anglo-Saxon===
The See of Durham takes its origins from the Diocese of Lindisfarne, founded by Saint Aidan at the behest of Oswald of Northumbria in about 635, which was translated to York in 664. The see was reinstated at Lindisfarne in 678 by the Archbishop of Canterbury. Among the many saints who originated at Lindisfarne Priory, the greatest was Saint Cuthbert, Bishop of Lindisfarne from 685 until his death in 687, who is central to the development of Durham Cathedral.

After repeated Viking raids, the monks fled from Lindisfarne in 875, carrying Saint Cuthbert&#x27;s relics with them. The diocese of Lindisfarne remained itinerant until 882, when the monks resettled at Chester-le-Street, 60 miles south of Lindisfarne and 6 miles north of Durham. The see remained at Chester-le-Street until 995, when further Viking incursions once again caused the monks to move with their relics. According to the local legend of the Dun Cow and the saint&#x27;s hagiography, the monks followed two milk maids who were searching for a dun-coloured cow and found themselves on a peninsula formed by a loop in the River Wear. Thereupon, Cuthbert&#x27;s coffin became immovable, which was taken as a sign that the new shrine should be built on that spot, which became the City of Durham. A more prosaic set of reasons for the selection of the peninsula is its highly defensible position, and that a community established there would enjoy the protection of the Earl of Northumbria, with whom the bishop at this time, Aldhun, had strong family connections. Today the street leading from The Bailey past the cathedral&#x27;s eastern towers up to Palace Green is named Dun Cow Lane due to the miniature dun cows which used to graze in the pastures nearby.

Initially, a very simple temporary structure was built from local timber to house the relics of Saint Cuthbert. The shrine was then transferred to a sturdier, probably still wooden, building known as the White Church. This church was itself replaced three years later in 998 by a stone building also known as the White Church, which in 1018 was complete except for its tower. Durham soon became a site of pilgrimage, encouraged by the growing cult of Saint Cuthbert. King Canute was one of the early pilgrims, and granted many privileges and estates to the Durham monks. The defensible position, flow of money from pilgrims and power embodied in the church at Durham all encouraged the formation of a town around the cathedral, which established the core of the city.

===Norman===
The present cathedral was designed and built under William de St-Calais (also known as William of St. Carilef). In 1083 he founded the Benedictine Priory of St. Cuthbert at Durham and having ejected the secular canons (and their wives and children) who had been in charge of the church and shrine of St Cuthbert there, replaced them with monks from the monasteries of Wearmouth and Jarrow. The extensive lands of the church he divided between his own bishopric and the new Priory. He appointed Aldwin as the first prior.

Bishop William of St. Calais demolished the old Saxon church, and on 11 August 1093, together with Prior Turgot of Durham (Aldwin&#x27;s successor), he laid the foundation stone of the great new cathedral. The monks continued at their own expense to build the monastic buildings while the bishop took the responsibility for completing the building of the cathedral. Stone for the new buildings was cut from the cliffs below the walls and moved up using winches. The primary reason for the cathedral was to house the bodies of St. Cuthbert and the Venerable Bede.

Since that time many major additions and reconstructions of parts of the building have been made, but the greater part of the structure remains the original Norman structure. Construction of the cathedral began in 1093, at the eastern end. The choir was completed by 1096. At the death of Bishop William of St. Calais on 2 January 1096, the Chapter House was ready enough to be used as his burial place. In 1104 the remains of St. Cuthbert were transferred with great ceremony to the new shrine in the new cathedral. The monks continued to look after the Shrine of St Cuthbert until the dissolution of the monasteries.

Work proceeded on the nave, the walls of which were finished by 1128, and the high vault by 1135. The chapter house was built between 1133 and 1140 (partially demolished in the 18th century). William of St. Carilef died in 1096 before the building was complete and passed responsibility to his successor, Ranulf Flambard, who also built Framwellgate Bridge, the earliest crossing of the River Wear from the town. Three bishops, William of St. Carilef, Ranulf Flambard and Hugh de Puiset, are all buried in the now rebuilt chapter house.

In the 1170s Hugh de Puiset, after a false start at the eastern end where subsidence and cracking prevented work from continuing, added the Galilee Chapel at the west end of the cathedral. The five-aisled building occupies the position of a porch and functioned as a Lady chapel with the great west door being blocked during the Medieval period by an altar to the Virgin Mary. The door is now blocked by the tomb of Bishop Thomas Langley. The Galilee Chapel also holds the remains of the Venerable Bede. The main entrance to the cathedral is on the northern side, facing the castle.

In 1228 Richard le Poore, Bishop of Salisbury, was translated to Durham, having just rebuilt Salisbury Cathedral in the Gothic style. At that moment the eastern end of Durham Cathedral was in urgent need of repair and the proposed eastern extension had failed. Le Poore employed the architect Richard Farnham to design an eastern terminal for the building in which many monks could say the Daily Office simultaneously. The resulting building was the Chapel of the Nine Altars. In 1250, the original roof of the cathedral was replaced by a vault which is still in place.

The towers also date from the early 13th century, but the central tower was damaged by lightning and replaced in two stages in the 15th century, the master masons being Thomas Barton and John Bell.

The bishop of Durham was the temporal lord of the County Palatine of Durham. The bishop competed for power with the prior of Durham, a great landowner who held his own courts for his free tenants. An agreement dated about 1229, known as &quot;Le Convenit&quot; was entered into to regulate the relationship between the two magnates.

The Shrine of Saint Cuthbert was located in the eastern apsidal end of the cathedral. The location of the inner wall of the apse is marked on the pavement and Saint Cuthbert&#x27;s tomb is covered by a simple slab. However, an unknown monk wrote in 1593:
===Dissolution===
During the dissolution of the monasteries Saint Cuthbert&#x27;s tomb was destroyed in 1538 by order of King Henry VIII, and the monastery&#x27;s wealth was handed over to the king. The body of the saint was exhumed, and, according to the &quot;Rites of Durham&quot;, was discovered to be uncorrupted. It was reburied under a plain stone slab now worn smooth by the knees of pilgrims, but the ancient paving around it remains intact. Two years later, on 31 December 1540, the Benedictine monastery at Durham was dissolved, and the last Prior of Durham, Hugh Whitehead, became the first dean of the cathedral&#x27;s secular chapter.

===17th century===
After the Battle of Dunbar in September 1650, Durham Cathedral was used by Oliver Cromwell as a makeshift prison to hold Scottish prisoners of war. It is estimated that as many as 3,000 were imprisoned, of whom 1,700 died in the cathedral itself, where they were kept in inhumane conditions, largely without food, water, or heat. The prisoners destroyed much of the cathedral woodwork for firewood, but Prior Castell&#x27;s Clock, which featured the Scottish thistle, was spared. It is reputed that the prisoners&#x27; bodies were buried in unmarked graves (see further, &#x27;21st century&#x27; below), and the survivors were shipped as slave labour to the American Colonies.

Bishop John Cosin (in office 1660–1672), previously a canon of the cathedral, set about restoring the damage and refurnishing the building with new stalls, the litany desk, and the towering canopy over the font. An oak screen to carry the organ was added at this time to replace a stone screen pulled down in the 16th century. On the remains of the old refectory, Dean John Sudbury founded a library of early printed books.
===18th and 19th centuries===

During the 18th century the Deans of Durham often held another position in the south of England and after spending the statutory time in residence, would depart southward to manage their affairs. Consequently, after Cosin&#x27;s refurbishment, there was little by way of restoration or rebuilding. When work commenced again on the building, it was not always of a sympathetic nature. In 1777 the architect George Nicholson, having completed Prebends&#x27; Bridge across the Wear, persuaded the dean and chapter to let him smooth off much of the outer stonework of the cathedral, thereby considerably altering its character. His successor William Morpeth demolished most of the Chapter House. In 1794 James Wyatt drew up plans to transform the building, including the demolition of the Galilee Chapel, but the chapter later decided against many of the intended changes. Wyatt renewed the 15th-century tracery of the Rose Window, inserting plain glass to replace what had been blown out in a storm.

In 1829 the Dean and Chapter authorised the engraving of a meridian line upon the floor and wall of the north cloister. A circular aperture about in the tracery of the adjoining window about above the level of the floor directs a beam of sunlight to fall upon the line at the precise time when the sun passes the meridian. It was constructed by William Lloyd Wharton, of Dryburn in the city, and Mr Carr, then Head Master of Durham School. In 1847 the architect Anthony Salvin removed Cosin&#x27;s wooden organ screen, opening up the view of the east end from the nave, and in 1858 he restored the cloisters. The Victorian restoration of the cathedral&#x27;s tower in 1859–60 was by the architect George Gilbert Scott, working with Edward Robert Robson (who went on to serve as Clerk of Works at the cathedral for six years). In 1874 Scott was responsible for the marble choir screen and pulpit in the Crossing. In 1892 Scott&#x27;s pupil Charles Hodgson Fowler rebuilt the Chapter House as a memorial to Bishop Joseph Barber Lightfoot. The great west window, depicting the &quot;Tree of Jesse&quot;, was the gift of Dean George Waddington in 1867. It is the work of Clayton and Bell, who were also responsible for the &quot;Te Deum&quot; window in the south transept (1869), the &quot;Four Doctors&quot; window in the north transept (1875), and the Rose Window of &quot;Christ in Majesty&quot; (). There is also a statue of William Van Mildert (1826–1836), the last bishop with palatine powers, and driving force behind the foundation of Durham University.


===20th century===

In the 1930s, under the inspiration of Dean Cyril Alington, work began on restoring the Shrine of Saint Cuthbert behind the high altar as an appropriate focus of worship and pilgrimage, and was resumed after World War II. The four candlesticks and overhanging tester () were designed by Ninian Comper. Two large batik banners representing Saints Cuthbert and Oswald, added in 2001, are the work of Thetis Blacker. Elsewhere in the building the 1930s and 1940s saw the addition of several new stained glass windows by Hugh Ray Easton. Mark Angus&#x27;s &quot;Daily Bread&quot; window in the north side of the nave, dates from 1984. In the Galilee Chapel a wooden statue of the &quot;Annunciation&quot; by the Polish artist Josef Pyrz was added in 1992, the same year as Leonard Evetts&#x27; &quot;Stella Maris&quot; window.

In 1986, the cathedral, together with the nearby Castle, became a World Heritage Site. The UNESCO committee classified the cathedral under criteria C (ii) (iv) (vi), reporting, &quot;Durham Cathedral is the largest and most perfect monument of &#x27;Norman&#x27; style architecture in England&quot;. 
In its discussion of the significance of the cathedral, Historic England provided this summary in their 1986 report: The relics and material culture of the three saints buried at the site. The continuity of use and ownership of the site over the past 1000 years as a place of religious worship, learning and residence; The site&#x27;s role as a political statement of Norman power imposed upon a subjugate nation, as one of the country&#x27;s most powerful symbols of the Norman Conquest of Britain; The importance of the site&#x27;s archaeological remains, which are directly related to the site&#x27;s history and continuity of use over the past 1000 years; The cultural and religious traditions and historical memories associated with the relics of St Cuthbert and the Venerable Bede, and with the continuity of use and ownership of the site over the past millennium.

===21st century===

At the beginning of this century two of the altars in the Nine Altars Chapel at the east end of the cathedral were re-dedicated to Saint Hild of Whitby and Saint Margaret of Scotland: a striking painting of Margaret (with her son, the future king David) by Paula Rego was dedicated in 2004. Nearby a plaque, first installed in 2011 and rededicated in 2017, commemorates the Scottish soldiers who died as prisoners in the cathedral after the Battle of Dunbar in 1650. The remains of some of these prisoners have now been identified in a mass grave uncovered during building works in 2013 just outside the cathedral precinct near Palace Green. In 2004 two wooden sculptures by Fenwick Lawson, &quot;Pietà&quot; and &quot;Tomb of Christ&quot;, were placed in the Nine Altars Chapel, and in 2010 a new stained glass window of the &quot;Transfiguration&quot; by Tom Denny was dedicated in memory of Michael Ramsey, former Bishop of Durham and Archbishop of Canterbury.

In 2016 former monastic buildings around the cloister, including the Monks&#x27; Dormitory and Prior&#x27;s Kitchen, were re-opened to the public as &quot;Open Treasure&quot;, an extensive exhibition displaying the cathedral&#x27;s history and possessions. In the same year, a scale model of the cathedral, made up of 300,000 Lego bricks and standing tall and long, was completed. The model is no longer displayed. In November 2009 the cathedral featured in the light festival Lumiere whose highlight was the &quot;Crown of Light&quot; illumination of the North Front of the cathedral with a 15-minute presentation that told the story of Lindisfarne and the foundation of cathedral, using illustrations and text from the Lindisfarne Gospels. Lumiere was repeated in 2011, 2013, 2015, and 2017. Durham Priory held many manuscripts; in the 21st century, steps were under way to digitise the books, originating from the 6th to the 16th century. The project was being undertaken in a partnership by Durham University and Durham Cathedral. The cathedral church and the cloister is open to visitors during certain hours each day, unless it is closed for a special event. In 2017 a new &quot;Open Treasure&quot; exhibition area was opened which included a display of Saint Cuthbert&#x27;s coffin and various relics; in 2019 a new exhibit was added, Mapping the World, featuring geographical items from the cathedral&#x27;s archive.

==Architecture==
There is some evidence that the aisle of the choir had the earliest rib vaults in England, as was argued by John Bilson, English architect, at the end of the nineteenth century. Since then it has been argued that other buildings like Lessay Abbey in north-west France provided the early experimental ribs that created the high technical level shown in Durham. There is evidence in the clerestory walls of the choir that the high vault had ribs. There is controversy between John James and Malcolm Thurlby on whether these rib vaults were four-part or six-part, which remains unresolved.

The building is notable for the ribbed vault of the nave, with some of the earliest transverse pointed arches supported on relatively slender composite piers alternated with massive drum columns, and lateral abutments concealed within the triforium over the aisles. These features appear to be precursors of the Gothic architecture of Northern France, possibly due to the Norman stonemasons responsible, although the building is considered Romanesque overall. The skilled use of the pointed arch and ribbed vault made it possible to cover far more elaborate and complicated ground plans than before. Buttressing made it possible to build taller buildings and open up the intervening wall spaces to create larger windows.

The UNESCO World Heritage Site description makes this comment about the architectural style:Though some wrongly considered Durham Cathedral to be the first &#x27;Gothic&#x27; monument (the relationship between it and the churches built in the Île-de-France region in the 12th century is not obvious), this building, owing to the innovative audacity of its vaulting, constitutes, as do Spire [Speyer] and Cluny, a type of experimental model which was far ahead of its time. Another United Nations web site states that&quot;the use of stone &#x27;ribs&#x27; forming pointed arches to support the ceiling of the nave was an important achievement, and Durham Cathedral is the earliest known example&quot; [and] The nave vault of Durham Cathedral is the most significant architectural element ... because it marks a turning point in the history of architecture. The pointed arch was successfully used as a structural element for the first time here in this building. Semi-circular arches were the type used prior to the adoption of the structural pointed arch—the limitations of which is that their height must be proportionate to their width&quot;.

Saint Cuthbert&#x27;s tomb lies at the east in the Feretory and was once an elaborate monument of cream marble and gold. It remains a place of pilgrimage. The fragments of St Cuthbert&#x27;s coffin are exhibited at the cathedral.

==Burials and memorials==
The cathedral has been the site of the burials of a number of notable individuals in addition to the major saints, including a large number of churchman. Burials include: William de St-Calais, Ranulf Flambard, Geoffrey Rufus, William of St. Barbara, Walter of Kirkham, Robert of Holy Island and Richard Kellaw, all in the chapter house; Nicholas Farnham; John Neville, 3rd Baron Neville, in the south transept; Robert Neville, Bishop of Durham, in the south aisle; the heart of Robert Stitchill; Bishop Anthony Bek; Thomas Sharp, in the Galilee chapel; Thomas Mangey, in the east transept; Thomas Langley, whose tomb blocked the Great West Door necessitating the construction of the two later doors to north and south; James Pilkington, at the head of Beaumont&#x27;s tomb in front of the high altar; Alfred Robert Tucker, outside the cathedral; Cyril Alington, Dean of Durham and author; John Robson, canon of Durham; Bishop J. B. Lightfoot; and Stephen Kemble, actor of the Kemble family.

Memorials include those to Bishop Joseph Butler, Bishop Edward Maltby, John Robert Davison QC MP and Brigadier General Herbert Conyers Surtees.

==Dean and chapter==
The cathedral is governed by the chapter which is chaired by the dean. Durham is a &quot;New Foundation&quot; cathedral in which there are not specific roles to which members of the chapter are appointed, with the exception of the Dean and the Van Mildert Professor of Divinity. The other roles, sub-dean, precentor, sacrist, librarian and treasurer, are elected by the members of the chapter annually. Office holders as at September 2022 were: the Dean – Dean-Designate is Philip Plyming, who will be installed as Dean on 16 September 2023; the Vice-Dean &amp; Canon Precentor – Michael Hampel (since 17 November 2018 installation; acting dean since 25 September 2022); Canon Chancellor – Charlie Allen (since 22 September 2018 installation); Canon Pastor – Michael Everitt (since 22 September 2019 installation); Van Mildert Professor of Divinity (Durham University) and Residentiary Canon – Simon Oliver (since 20 September 2015 installation).

==Music==

===Organ===
In the 17th century Durham had an organ by Smith that was replaced in 1876 by &#x27;Father&#x27; Willis (Henry Willis &amp; Sons), with some pipes being reused in Durham Castle chapel. Harrison &amp; Harrison worked on the organ from 1880, restored between 1905 and 1935, rebuilt again in 1970 with a new console, and adding a Classically voiced Positive division, and further refurbishments and minor changes in 1981 and 1996. The cases, designed by C. Hodgson Fowler and decorated by Clayton and Bell date from 1876 and are in the galleries of the choir.

===Organists===

The first organist recorded at Durham was John Brimley in 1557. Notable organists have included the composers Thomas Ebdon and Richard Hey Lloyd, editor of the Ancient and Modern Revised hymnbook John Dykes Bower, and (as sub-organist) choral conductor David Hill.

The current Master of the Choristers and Organist is Daniel Cook, having succeeded James Lancelot in 2017. The Sub-Organist is Joseph Beech.

===Choir===
There is a regular choir of adult lay clerks, choral scholars and child choristers. The latter are educated at the Chorister School. Traditionally child choristers were all boys, but in November 2009 the cathedral admitted female choristers for the first time. The girls and the boys serve alternately, not as a mixed choir, except at major festivals such as Easter, Advent and Christmas when the two &quot;top lines&quot; come together.

===Bells===
There are ten bells in the central tower hung for change ringing in the English style. The tenor weighs , diameter tuned to D. Five of the bells (4, 7, 8, 9 and 10) are recognised as historically significant by Church Buildings Council (formerly the Council for the Care of Churches), they were cast in 1693. The remaining bells were cast in 1780 (3), 1781 (5), 1896 (6), 1980 (1 and 2).

== Film and television ==
Durham Cathedral has been used as a filming location in a number of cinema and television productions. Because of its distinct Romanesque architecture, the cathedral has doubled as a number of fantasy locations in larger budget film productions, but it has also been seen as itself in a number of television programmes. Movies filmed at the cathedral include: &quot;Jude&quot; (1996); &quot;Elizabeth&quot;; the first two &quot;Harry Potter&quot; films, &quot;Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot; and &quot;Chamber of Secrets&quot;; &quot;Snow White and the Huntsman&quot;; &quot;&quot; (2019) and The Old Oak.

Television programmes shot at the cathedral include: &quot;Treasurehunt&quot; (1988); &quot;Songs of Praise&quot;; &quot;The Antiques Roadshow&quot; &quot;Britain&#x27;s Best Buildings&quot; (2002) &quot;Climbing Great Buildings&quot; (2010); &quot;Great British Railway Journeys&quot; (2011); &quot;Richard Wilson: On the Road&quot;; &quot;All Man&quot;; &quot;Britain&#x27;s Great Cathedrals&quot;; and two Catherine Cookson adaptations, &quot;The Tide of Life&quot; and &quot;The Wingless Bird&quot;.

== Art, literature and quotations==
&quot;Durham Cathedral&quot;, a poem by Letitia Landon, appeared in Fisher&#x27;s &quot;Drawing Room Scrap Book&quot; of 1835, with an engraving of a painting of the interior by Thomas Allom.
&quot;Durham is one of the great experiences of Europe to the eyes of those who appreciate architecture, and to the minds of those who understand architecture. The group of Cathedral, Castle, and Monastery on the rock can only be compared to Avignon and Prague.&quot; – Nikolaus Pevsner, &quot;The Buildings of England&quot;

&quot;A dream, I&#x27;m bowled over...Imagine a river valley cut into the landscape with wooded sides. The river bends, and in the bend, on the hillside, lies the old town—first the residential town, then separate from it, and higher up, the castle—and then, out on its own, in the midst of tall trees, the enormous cathedral with its twin end towers. From the bridge it is a Romantic dream, a fantasy by Schinkel. This morning in the mist it was wonderful...the first thing that has made my heart pound...the cathedral in itself, just like the Matterhorn in itself—gigantic, grey, on its own.&quot; – Pevsner in a letter to his wife, Lola, on his first English tour in 1930.
&quot;I paused upon the bridge, and admired and wondered at the beauty and glory of this scene...it was grand, venerable, and sweet, all at once; I never saw so lovely and magnificent a scene, nor, being content with this, do I care to see a better.&quot; – Nathaniel Hawthorne on Durham Cathedral, &quot;The English Notebooks&quot;

&#x27;With the cathedral at Durham we reach the incomparable masterpiece of Romanesque architecture not only in England but anywhere. The moment of entering provides for an architectural experience never to be forgotten, one of the greatest England has to offer.&#x27; – Alec Clifton-Taylor, &#x27;English Towns&#x27; series on BBC television.

&quot;I unhesitatingly gave Durham my vote for best cathedral on planet Earth.&quot; – Bill Bryson, &quot;Notes from a Small Island&quot;.

:&quot;Grey towers of Durham
:Yet well I love thy mixed and massive piles
:Half church of God, half castle &#x27;gainst the Scot
:And long to roam those venerable aisles
:With records stored of deeds long since forgot.&quot;
— Walter Scott, &quot;Harold the Dauntless&quot;, a poem of Saxons and Vikings set in County Durham.

<text>William &quot;Vilim&quot; Feller (July 7, 1906 – January 14, 1970), born Vilibald Srećko Feller, was a Croatian–American mathematician specializing in probability theory.

==Early life and education==
Feller was born in Zagreb to Ida Oemichen-Perc, a Croatian–Austrian Catholic, and Eugen Viktor Feller, son of a Polish–Jewish father (David Feller) and an Austrian mother (Elsa Holzer).

Eugen Feller was a famous chemist and created &quot;Elsa fluid&quot; named after his mother. According to Gian-Carlo Rota, Eugen Feller&#x27;s surname was a &quot;Slavic tongue twister&quot;, which William changed at the age of twenty. This claim appears to be false. His forename, Vilibald, was chosen by his Catholic mother for the saint day of his birthday.

==Work==

Feller held a docent position at the University of Kiel beginning in 1928. Because he refused to sign a Nazi oath, he fled the Nazis and went to Copenhagen, Denmark in 1933. He also lectured in Sweden (Stockholm and Lund). As a refugee in Sweden, Feller reported being troubled by increasing fascism at the universities. He reported that the mathematician Torsten Carleman would offer his opinion that Jews and foreigners should be executed.

Finally, in 1939 he arrived in the U.S., where he became a citizen in 1944 and was on the faculty at Brown and Cornell. In 1950 he became a professor at Princeton University.

The works of Feller are contained in 104 papers and two books on a variety of topics such as mathematical analysis, theory of measurement, functional analysis, geometry, and differential equations in addition to his work in mathematical statistics and probability.

Feller was one of the greatest probabilists of the twentieth century. He is remembered for his championing of probability theory as a branch of mathematical analysis in Sweden and the United States. In the middle of the 20th century, probability theory was popular in France and Russia, while mathematical statistics was more popular in the United Kingdom and the United States, according to the Swedish statistician, Harald Cramér. His two-volume textbook on probability theory and its applications was called &quot;the most successful treatise on probability ever written&quot; by Gian-Carlo Rota. By stimulating his colleagues and students in Sweden and then in the United States, Feller helped establish research groups studying the analytic theory of probability. In his research, Feller contributed to the study of the relationship between Markov chains and differential equations, where his theory of generators of one-parameter semigroups of stochastic processes gave rise to the theory of &quot;Feller operators&quot;.

==Results==
Numerous topics relating to probability are named after him, including Feller processes, Feller&#x27;s explosion test, Feller–Brown movement, and the Lindeberg–Feller theorem. Feller made fundamental contributions to renewal theory, Tauberian theorems, random walks, diffusion processes, and the law of the iterated logarithm. Feller was among those early editors who launched the journal &quot;Mathematical Reviews&quot;.

==Notable books==
* &quot;An Introduction to Probability Theory and its Applications, Volume I, 3rd edition&quot; (1968); 1st edn. (1950); 2nd edn. (1957)
* &quot;An Introduction to Probability Theory and its Applications, Volume II, 2nd edition&quot; (1971)

==Recognition==
In 1949, Feller was named a Fellow of the American Statistical Association. He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1958, the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1960, and the American Philosophical Society in 1966. Feller won the National Medal of Science in 1969.
He was president of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics.

<doc id="206646" wikidata="Q144746" url="?curid=206646" title="Zakk Wylde">
<text>Zachary Phillip Wylde (born Jeffrey Phillip Wielandt; January 14, 1967) is an American musician. He is best known as the lead guitarist for Ozzy Osbourne and as the founder, lead guitarist, lead singer, songwriter and producer of the heavy metal band Black Label Society. 

Wylde&#x27;s signature bulls-eye design appears on many of his guitars and is widely recognized. He was also the lead guitarist and vocalist of Pride &amp; Glory, who released one self-titled album in 1994 before disbanding. As a solo artist, he released the albums &quot;Book of Shadows&quot; and &quot;Book of Shadows II&quot;. Wylde joined the reunited Pantera in 2022 as a touring guitarist.

==Early life==
Zachary Phillip Wylde was born Jeffrey Phillip Wielandt in Bayonne, New Jersey, on January 14, 1967. He is of Irish descent. He started playing guitar at the age of eight, but did not become serious about it until his early teenage years. At the age of 14, he worked at Silverton Music in Silverton, New Jersey. He grew up in Jackson, New Jersey, where he attended Jackson Memorial High School, graduating in 1985. He has stated that he often played the guitar almost non-stop between coming home from school and leaving for school the next morning, then would be completely exhausted during school the next day.

==Career==
===Early career===
Wylde played locally with his first band Stone Henge, then later with local New Jersey band Zyris.

===Ozzy Osbourne (1987–1995, 2001–2009, 2017–present)===

In 1987, Wylde auditioned for Ozzy Osbourne after listening to The Howard Stern Show and learning that Osbourne was looking for a new lead guitarist. Wylde was hired to replace Jake E. Lee, who was fired by Ozzy Osbourne manager Sharon Osbourne. He subsequently toured with Osbourne and played on &quot;No Rest for the Wicked&quot; (1988), &quot;No More Tears&quot; (1991), and &quot;Ozzmosis&quot; (1995) as a co-writer.

Wylde was replaced by little-known guitarist Joe Holmes in 1995 until Wylde&#x27;s return in 2001. Although not credited for songwriting, Wylde recorded &quot;Down to Earth&quot; and appeared on the supporting tour. After auditioning different guitarists in 2004 and 2005, Ozzy Osbourne announced Zakk Wylde as the official guitarist for his album &quot;Black Rain&quot;, which was released in 2007 and also accompanied by a tour.

Wylde rejoined Ozzy Osbourne&#x27;s band once again for a select number of dates during Osbourne&#x27;s 2017 summer tour, and then performed on the &quot;No More Tours II&quot; tour before the remaining shows were postponed and eventually canceled. On September 8, 2022, he again joined Osbourne onstage at the SoFi Stadium along with Andrew Watt to perform &quot;Crazy Train&quot; and the title track for Osbourne&#x27;s upcoming album &quot;Patient Number 9&quot; at the NFL&#x27;s season opening during half-time. The following day, &quot;Patient Number 9&quot; was released featuring Wylde playing guitar on 4 tracks.

On October 19, 2024, Wylde performed on stage at Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse during the 2024 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony for Osbourne, playing Mama, I&#x27;m Coming Home and No More Tears (Ozzy Osbourne song).

===Pride &amp; Glory (1991–1994)===
Formed in 1991 during what was then billed as Ozzy Osbourne&#x27;s farewell tour following the 1991 &quot;No More Tears&quot; album, Wylde recruited the former White Lion rhythm section of bassist James LoMenzo and drummer Greg D&#x27;Angelo, and originally wanted to name the Southern rock-inspired project &#x27;Lynyrd Skynhead&#x27;. This lineup recorded two songs, an instrumental entitled &quot;Farm Fiddlin&quot; for a 1991 compilation album entitled &quot;The Guitars That Rule the World&quot;, and a cover of the blues-standard &quot;Baby, Please Don&#x27;t Go&quot; for the 1992 &quot;L.A. Blues Authority Vol. 1&quot; compilation.

By early 1994, the band had changed their name to &#x27;Pride &amp; Glory&#x27;, with D&#x27;Angelo departing and being replaced by Brian Tichy. That year, Pride &amp; Glory released their only album via Geffen Records and performed as a main-stage act at the Donington Monsters of Rock Festival in England in June of that year. In November 1994, LoMenzo left after a tour of Japan, three days before Pride &amp; Glory were scheduled to begin a US Tour. Scrambling, Wylde quickly managed to find a replacement in his long-time friend, John DeServio, who grew up with Wylde in New Jersey. Pride &amp; Glory played their final show on December 10, 1994, in Los Angeles.

On January 31, 1998, the lineup of Wylde, LoMenzo, and Tichy reunited for a one-off reunion show at the Whisky a Go Go in Hollywood.

===Solo albums (1996, 2016)===
Following the demise of Wylde&#x27;s Pride &amp; Glory band, he recorded &quot;Book of Shadows&quot; in 1996 as a solo album to fulfill his contract with record label Geffen Records. Wylde wrote the second installment of &quot;Book of Shadows&quot; in between stints on the road, which was released 20 years after the first album on April 16, 2016.

===Black Label Society (1998–present)===
In 1998, after limited commercial success with &quot;Book of Shadows&quot;, Wylde and drummer Phil Ondich recorded what became Black Label Society&#x27;s debut album &quot;Sonic Brew&quot; with Wylde playing lead guitar, rhythm and bass. Nick Catanese previously toured as a rhythm guitarist for the Book of Shadows tour and eventually joined Black Label Society before being replaced by Dario Lorina in 2013. John DeServio, who was a friend of Zakk&#x27;s and worked as a temporary replacement in Pride &amp; Glory, played bass for the first Black Label Society tour. DeServio became a permanent member of the band in 2005. Zakk Wylde has since released 11 studio albums, 3 live albums, and 6 compilation albums with Black Label Society.

Black Label Society headlined the second stage at the 2006 Ozzfest, with Wylde playing double duty with Ozzy Osbourne on certain dates. He and the band also joined Osbourne for the Ozzy and Friends Tour in replacement of the Black Sabbath tour scheduled for the summer of 2012, playing a range of European dates including Graspop Metal Meeting in Belgium.

===Zakk Sabbath (2014–present)===
Since 2014, Wylde has led a Black Sabbath cover band called &#x27;Zakk Sabbath&#x27;, handling guitar and vocal duties, joined by Rob &quot;Blasko&quot; Nicholson on bass and Joey Castillo (Danzig, Queens of the Stone Age) on drums, who replaced original drummer John Tempesta. JP Gaster (Clutch) occupied the drummer&#x27;s seat in between, in September 2017. The band tours intermittently, and released a single, three-track vinyl-only live 12&quot;, in 2016.

===Pantera (2022–present)===

On July 14, 2022, it was announced that Wylde had joined the reunited band Pantera to tour as a fill-in for original guitarist Dimebag Darrell who died in 2004. The new line-up featuring Wylde, Phil Anselmo, Rex Brown and Charlie Benante (replacing original drummer Vinnie Paul) debuted on the first night of the Heaven &amp; Hell Metal Fest in Toluca, Mexico on December 2, 2022. Pantera then co-headlined Mexico&#x27;s Monterrey Metal Fest with Judas Priest, and also performed at Knotfest in Chile, Brazil and Colombia. The band embarked on a full-scale tour of Europe in May and June 2023, and supported Metallica on selected North American dates of their 2023–2024 M72 World Tour. On June 15, 2024, Pantera headlined the Opus Stage at UK&#x27;s Download Festival, their first UK appearance in 20 years.

===Other work===
Zakk Wylde joined a rock/heavy metal supergroup called &#x27;Generation Axe&#x27;, formed by Steve Vai. The group also includes guitarists Nuno Bettencourt (of Extreme), Yngwie Malmsteen, Tosin Abasi, and has completed several tours from 2016 to 2019. Select performances from a 2017 show in Beijing, China were released as a live album titled &quot;Generation Axe — The Guitars That Destroyed the World: Live In China&quot;. In 2020, Wylde, along with Generation Axe, were joined by Brian May of the band Queen for a six-guitar performance of Queen&#x27;s &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; as part of AXS TV&#x27;s &#x27;At Home And Social With Nuno Bettencourt &amp; Friends&#x27; special. The track was compiled of recordings from the musicians in their homes during the COVID-19 pandemic.

==Personal life==
Wylde and his wife Barbaranne have four children, one of which Ozzy Osbourne is a godfather of. Wylde was a close friend of fellow guitarist &quot;Dimebag&quot; Darrell Abbott and dedicated the song &quot;In This River&quot; to Abbott after he was murdered onstage in 2004.

Wylde is a Catholic who has described himself as a &quot;Soldier of Christ&quot;.

In August 2009, Wylde was hospitalized due to blood clots and was subsequently forced to cancel his tour with Mudvayne and Static-X. After his hospitalization, he stopped drinking alcohol.

As of 2011, Wylde has partnered with Blair&#x27;s Sauces and Snacks to produce &#x27;Berserker Hot Sauce&#x27; and several other variations. He also promotes &#x27;Death Wish Coffee&#x27; via his Instagram page, as they have used his name in marketing their line &quot;Odinforce Blend&quot;.

==Equipment==
Wylde gravitated toward a particular Les Paul guitar, a bullseye-painted 1981 Gibson Les Paul Custom purchased from one of the owners of Metaltronix Amplification. Metaltronix was building a one-off live rig for Wylde that was designed around one of the owner&#x27;s guitars, a creamy white Les Paul Custom with EMG pickups, which would later become known as &quot;The Grail&quot;. Originally intended to look like the spiral from the Alfred Hitchcock movie &quot;Vertigo&quot;, it returned from a paint shop painted incorrectly and Wylde liked the result. Wylde lost the guitar in 2000 after it fell from the back of a truck transporting equipment as he was travelling between gigs in Texas. Rewards were offered to anyone that had information about the guitar. Wylde and The Grail were reunited three years later when a fan bought it at a Dallas pawn shop and saw the initials &quot;Z.W.&quot; carved into the humbucker pickups backs. He contacted Wylde&#x27;s former webmaster Randy Canis to arrange its return to Wylde. Grateful, Wylde gave the fan his signature model in exchange.

Other signature Les Pauls of Wylde&#x27;s include a red flame-maple bulls-eye model, a black and antique-white bulls-eye model, an orange &quot;buzz-saw&quot; model, the pattern on which was inspired by a design on a Zippo lighter, and a &quot;camo&quot; bulls-eye model with mother of pearl neck inlays and a green camouflage paint scheme.

Another one of Wylde&#x27;s favorite stage guitars is a GMW RR-V, a model that is famously known as the &quot;Polka-dot V&quot;. Originally created by luthier Karl Sandoval of California (used by Randy Rhoads), the guitar is often mistaken as a custom Flying V.
Wylde has a custom Dean Splittail with a mud splatter bulls-eye graphic, as well as a signature Splittail shaped Gibson model called the &quot;ZV&quot;. Another Dean in his collection is a Dime series Razorback with custom Bulls-eye graphics ordered for him specially by Dimebag Darrell shortly before his murder in 2004; since receiving the guitar, he has only ever used it on stage to play the song &quot;In This River&quot;, Zakk&#x27;s personal tribute to Dimebag.

In practice, Wylde uses Marshall MG Series practice combos ranging in wattage levels from 10-30W during tour/private use especially in hotels and buses. He has also been known to use Marshall Valvestate combo amplifiers. Wylde has an extensive relationship with Marshall Amplification due to his love for their amplifiers, both solid state and tube-driven. Live, Wylde exclusively uses Marshall JCM 800&#x27;s with twin 4 X 12 Cabinets loaded with EVM12L 300W Black Label Speakers. His usual signal path consists of his guitar &gt; (on stage pedal board) Dunlop Wylde Wah &gt; Dunlop Wylde Rotovibe &gt; MXR ZW Phase 90 &gt; MXR Wylde Overdrive &gt; MXR Carbon Copy Delay &gt; (to a back stage pedal board) &gt; MXR EVH Flanger &gt; MXR Black Label Chorus &gt; split signals, one to each distorted amp into the High Gain input.

A detailed gear diagram of Wylde&#x27;s 1988 Ozzy Osbourne guitar rig is well-documented.

At the 2015 NAMM Show, Wylde announced his new company called Wylde Audio and provided a preview of his new line of custom guitars and amplifiers. Currently he now is seen playing Wylde Audio equipment almost exclusively.

==Awards==
In January 2006, Zakk Wylde was recognized at the Hollywood Rock Walk of Fame for his successful career as a musician and his contribution to the music industry. The event was open to the public and was attended by musicians including Ozzy Osbourne.

In 2010, Wylde accepted the Metal Hammer Golden God Award.

<text>Oswald von Nell-Breuning (8 March 1890 – 21 August 1991) was a Roman Catholic theologian and sociologist.

Born in Trier, Germany into an aristocratic family, Nell-Breuning was ordained in 1921 and appointed Professor of Ethics at the Sankt Georgen Graduate School of Philosophy and Theology in 1928. He was instrumental in the drafting of Pope Pius XI&#x27;s social encyclical &quot;Quadragesimo anno&quot; (1931), which – like the earlier &quot;Rerum novarum&quot; (1891), after which it was named – dealt with the &quot;Social Question&quot; and developed the principle of subsidiarity. Nell-Breuning was not allowed to publish from 1936 to the end of Nazi Germany in 1945. After the war he lectured as an honorary professor at Goethe University at later established his own &quot;Akademie der Arbeit&quot; (Academy of Work). He exerted a strong influence on the social policy program of the Christian Democratic Union of Germany and had a close relationship with the German trade unions. He died in Frankfurt am Main.

<doc id="206652" wikidata="Q282220" url="?curid=206652" title="Judah (son of Jacob)">
<text>Judah () was, according to the Book of Genesis, the fourth of the six sons of Jacob and Leah and the founder of the Tribe of Judah of the Israelites. By extension, he is indirectly the eponym of the Kingdom of Judah, the land of Judea, and the word &quot;Jew&quot;.

According to the narrative in Genesis, Judah alongside Tamar is a patrilineal ancestor of the Davidic line. The Tribe of Judah features prominently in Deuteronomistic history, which most scholars agree was reduced to written form, although subject to exilic and post-exilic alterations and emendations, during the reign of the Judahist reformer Josiah from 641 to 609 BCE.

==Etymology==
The Hebrew name for Judah, &quot;Yehuda&quot; (יהודה), literally &quot;thanksgiving&quot; or &quot;praise,&quot; is the noun form of the root Y-D-H (ידה), &quot;to thank&quot; or &quot;to praise.&quot; His birth is recorded at &quot;Gen.&quot; 29:35; upon his birth, Leah exclaims, &quot;This time I will praise the /YHWH,&quot; with the Hebrew word for &quot;I will praise,&quot; &quot;odeh&quot; (אודה) sharing the same root as &quot;Yehuda&quot;. Alternatively, Edward Lipiński connected Hebrew &quot;yĕhūdā&quot; with Arabic &quot;whd&quot; / &quot;wahda&quot; &quot;cleft, ravine&quot;.

==Biblical references==
Judah is the fourth son of the patriarch Jacob and his first wife, Leah: his full brothers are Reuben, Simeon and Levi (all older), and Issachar and Zebulun (younger), and he has one full sister, Dinah. Through his father, he also has six half-brothers: Dan and Naphtali (whose mother is Bilhah), Gad and Asher (whose mother is Zilpah), and Joseph and Benjamin (whose mother is Rachel).

Following his birth, Judah&#x27;s next appearance is in &quot;Gen&quot; 37, when he and his brothers cast Joseph into a pit out of jealousy after Joseph approaches them, flaunting a coat of many colors, while they are working in the field. It is Judah who spots a caravan of Ishmaelites coming towards them on its way to Egypt and suggests that Joseph be sold to the Ishmaelites rather than killed. (&quot;Gen.&quot; 37:26-28, &quot;What profit is it if we slay our brother and conceal his blood? ... Let not our hand be upon him, for he is our brother, our flesh.&quot;)

Judah marries the daughter of Shuah, a Canaanite. Judah and his wife have three children, Er, Onan, and Shelah. Er marries Tamar, but God kills him because he was wicked in His sight (&quot;Gen.&quot; 38:7). Tamar becomes Onan&#x27;s wife in accordance with custom, but he too is killed after he refuses to father children for his older brother&#x27;s childless widow, and spills his seed instead. Although Tamar should have married Shelah, the remaining brother, Judah did not consent, and in response Tamar deceives Judah into having intercourse with her by pretending to be a prostitute. When Judah discovers that Tamar is pregnant he prepares to have her killed, but recants and confesses when he finds out that he is the father (&quot;Gen.&quot; 38:24-26). Tamar is the mother of twins, Perez (Peretz) and Zerah (Gen. 38:27-30). The former is the patrilinear ancestor of the messiah, according to the Book of Ruth (4:18-22).

Meanwhile, Joseph rises to a position of power in Egypt. Twenty years after being betrayed, he meets his brothers again without them recognizing him. The youngest brother, Benjamin, had remained in Canaan with Jacob, so Joseph takes Simeon hostage and insists that the brothers return with Benjamin. Judah offers himself to Jacob as surety for Benjamin&#x27;s safety, and manages to persuade Jacob to let them take Benjamin to Egypt. When the brothers return, Joseph tests them by demanding the enslavement of Benjamin. Judah pleads for Benjamin&#x27;s life, and Joseph reveals his true identity. Before he dies, Jacob blesses Judah as his lead heir, stating that his other sons &quot;shall bow down before you&quot; and that he shall hold &quot;the ruler&#x27;s staff.&quot;

== Textual criticism ==
===Relationship between the Joseph and Judah narratives===

Literary critics have focused on the relationship between the Judah story in chapter 38, and the Joseph story in chapters 37 and 39. Victor Hamilton notes some &quot;intentional literary parallels&quot; between the chapters, such as the exhortation to &quot;identify&quot; (38:25-26 and 37:32-33). J. A. Emerton, Regius Professor of Hebrew at the University of Cambridge, regards the connections as evidence for including chapter 38 in the J corpus, and suggests that the J writer dovetailed the Joseph and Judah traditions. Derek Kidner points out that the insertion of chapter 38 &quot;creates suspense for the reader&quot;, but Robert Alter goes further and suggests it is a result of the &quot;brilliant splicing of sources by a literary artist&quot;. He notes that the same verb &quot;identify&quot; will play &quot;a crucial thematic role in the dénouement of the Joseph story when he confronts his brothers in Egypt, he recognizing them, they failing to recognize him&quot;. Similarly, J. P. Fokkelman notes that the &quot;extra attention&quot; for Judah in chapter 38, &quot;sets him up for his major role as the brothers&#x27; spokesman in Genesis 44&quot;.

===Foreshadowing the hegemony of Judah===
Other than Joseph (and perhaps Benjamin), Judah receives the most favorable treatment in Genesis among Jacob&#x27;s sons, which according to biblical historians is a reflection on the historical primacy that the tribe of Judah possessed throughout much of Israel&#x27;s history, including as the source of the Davidic line. Although Judah is only the fourth son of Leah, he is expressly depicted in Genesis as assuming a leadership role among the 10 eldest brothers, including speaking up against killing Joseph, negotiating with his father regarding Joseph&#x27;s demand that Benjamin be brought down to Egypt, and pleading with Joseph after the latter secrets the silver cup into Benjamin&#x27;s bag.

Judah&#x27;s position is further enhanced through the downfall of his older brothers: Reuben, the eldest, cedes his birthright through sexual misconduct with Jacob&#x27;s concubine Bilhah (&quot;Gen.&quot; 35:22), and the bloody revenge taken by Simeon and Levi following the rape of Dinah (&quot;Gen.&quot; chap. 34) disqualifies them as leaders. The eternal legacy of these events are foreshadowed in the deathbed blessing of Jacob (&quot;Gen.&quot; 49:1-33), which has been attributed according to the documentary hypothesis to the pro-Judah Yahwist source. In Jacob&#x27;s blessing, Reuben has &quot;not the excellency&quot; to lead &quot;because thou went up to thy father&#x27;s bed, then defiled [it]&quot;; meanwhile, Simeon and Levi are condemned as &quot;cruel&quot; and &quot;weapons of violence [are] their kinship.&quot; (&quot;Gen.&quot; 49.:3-7.) On the other hand, Judah is praised as &quot;a lion&#x27;s whelp&quot; whose brothers &quot;shall bow down before thee&quot;, and &quot;the sceptre shall not depart from Judah&quot; (Genesis 49:10), the latter a clear reference to the aspirations of the united monarchy.

Hebraist Gary Rendsburg argues that the original Biblical audience would have noticed the parallels between Judah and Tamar on the one hand and David and Bathsheba on the other. In particular, Rendsburg notes the similarity between Bathsheba (בַּת-שֱבַע, bat-šɛbaʿ, ‘Bathsheba) and Judah&#x27;s wife the daughter of Shua&#x27;, whose name is not given (בַּת-שוּעַ, bat…šua, the daughter of … Shua).

Archaeologist and scholar Israel Finkelstein argues that these and other pro-Judah narrative strands likely originated after the demise of the Kingdom of Israel in the eighth century BCE: &quot;[I]t was only after the fall of Israel that Judah grew into a fully developed state with the necessary complement of professional priests and trained scribes able to undertake such a task. When Judah suddenly faced the non-Israelite world on its own, it needed a defining and motivating text. That text was the historical core of the Bible, composed in Jerusalem in the course of the seventh century BCE. And because Judah was the birthplace of ancient Israel&#x27;s central scripture, it is hardly surprising that the biblical text repeatedly stresses Judah&#x27;s special status from the very beginnings of Israel&#x27;s history... [In Genesis], it was Judah, among all of Jacob&#x27;s sons, whose destiny was to rule over all the other tribes in Israel.&quot;

===The story of Judah and Tamar in the historical context===
Emerton notes that it is &quot;widely agreed&quot; that the story of Judah and Tamar &quot;reflects a period after the settlement of the Israelites in Canaan&quot;. He also suggests the possibility that it contains &quot;aetiological motifs concerned with the eponymous ancestors of the clans of Judah&quot;. Emerton notes that Dillman and Noth considered the account of the deaths of Er and Onan to &quot;reflect the dying out of two clans of Judah bearing their names, or at least of their failure to maintain a separate existence&quot;. However, this view was &quot;trenchantly criticized&quot; by Thomas L. Thompson.

Along with the account of Lot and his daughters (Genesis 19:30–38), Tamar and Judah is one of two instances of &quot;sperm stealing&quot; in the Bible, in which a woman seduces a male relative under false pretenses in order to become pregnant.

== Jewish tradition ==
=== Rabbinic commentaries ===
The text of the Torah argues that the name of &quot;Judah&quot;, meaning &quot;to thank&quot; or &quot;admit&quot;, refers to Leah&#x27;s intent to thank Hashem, on account of having achieved four children, and derived from &quot;odeh&quot;, meaning &quot;I will give thanks&quot;. In classical rabbinical literature, the name is interpreted as a combination of &quot;Yahweh&quot; and a dalet (the letter &quot;d&quot;); in Gematria, the dalet has the numerical value &quot;4&quot;, which these rabbinical sources argue refers to Judah being Jacob&#x27;s fourth son. Since Leah was matriarch, Jewish scholars think the text&#x27;s authors believed the tribe was part of the original Israelite confederation; however, it is worthy of note that the tribe of Judah was not purely Israelite, but contained a large admixture of non-Israelites, with a number of Kenizzite groups, the Jerahmeelites, and the Kenites, merging into the tribe at various points.

Classical rabbinical sources refer to the passage &quot;... a ruler came from Judah&quot;, from , to imply that Judah was the leader of his brothers, terming him &quot;the king&quot;. This passage also describes Judah as the &quot;strongest of his brothers&quot; in which rabbinical literature portray him as having had extraordinary physical strength, able to shout for over 400 parasangs, able to crush iron into dust by his mouth, and with hair that stiffened so much, when he became angry, that it pierced his clothes.

Classical rabbinical sources also allude to a war between the Canaanites and Judah&#x27;s family (not mentioned in the Hebrew Bible), as a result of their destruction of Shechem in revenge for the rape of Dinah; Judah features heavily as a protagonist in accounts of this war. In these accounts Judah kills Jashub, king of Tappuah, in hand-to-hand combat, after first having deposed Jashub from his horse by throwing an extremely heavy stone (60 shekels in weight) at him from a large distance away (the Midrash Wayissau states 177⅓ cubits, while other sources have only 30 cubits); the accounts say that Judah was able to achieve this even though he was himself under attack, from arrows which Jashub was shooting at him with both hands. The accounts go on to state that while Judah was trying to remove Jashub&#x27;s armour from his corpse, nine assistants of Jashub fell upon him in combat, but after Judah killed one, he scared away the others; nevertheless, Judah killed several members of Jashub&#x27;s army (42 men according to the midrashic &quot;Book of Jasher&quot;, but 1000 men according to the &quot;Testament of Judah&quot;).

According to some classical sources, Jacob suspected that Judah had killed Joseph, especially, according to the Midrash Tanhuma, when Judah was the one who had brought the blood stained coat to Jacob.

Since rabbinical sources held Judah to have been the leader of his brothers, these sources also hold that the other nine brothers blamed him to be responsible for this deception, even if it was not Judah himself who brought the coat to Jacob. Even if Judah had been trying to save Joseph, the classical rabbinical sources still regard him negatively for it; these sources argue that, as the leader of the brothers, Judah should have made more effort and carried Joseph home to Jacob on his (Judah&#x27;s) own shoulders. These sources argue that Judah&#x27;s brothers, after witnessing Jacob&#x27;s grief at the loss of Joseph, deposed and excommunicated Judah, as the brothers held Judah entirely responsible, since they would have brought Joseph home if Judah had asked them to do so. Divine punishment, according to such classical sources, was also inflicted on Judah in punishment; the death of Er and Onan, and of his wife, are portrayed in by such classical rabbis as being acts of divine retribution.

When Benjamin was held in bondage following the accusation of stealing Joseph&#x27;s cup, Judah offered himself among his brethren as a bondman in replace of him, but Joseph was strict that the punishment is only applied to the one who was guilty, not to the innocent ones.

According to classical rabbinical literature, because Judah had proposed that he should take any blame &quot;forever&quot;, this ultimately led to his bones being rolled around his coffin without cease, while it was being carried during the Exodus, until Moses interceded with God, by arguing that Judah&#x27;s confession (in regard to cohabiting with Tamar) had led to Reuben confessing his own incest. Apparently, Judah learned a lesson from his experience with Tamar that he must be responsible for those around him and this eventually prepares him for his future reconciliatory encounter with Joseph.

&quot;Genesis Rabbah&quot;, and particularly the midrashic &quot;book of Jasher&quot;, expand on this by describing Judah&#x27;s plea as much more extensive than given in the Torah, and more vehement.

The classical rabbinical literature argues that Judah reacted violently to the threat against Benjamin, shouting so loudly that Hushim, who was then in Canaan, was able to hear Judah ask him to travel to Egypt, to help Judah destroy it; some sources have Judah angrily picking up an extremely heavy stone (400 shekels in weight), throwing it into the air, then grinding it to dust with his feet once it had landed. These rabbinical sources argue that Judah had Naphtali enumerate the districts of Egypt, and after finding out that there were 12 (historically, there were actually 20 in Lower Egypt and 22 in Upper Egypt), he decided to destroy three himself and have his brothers destroy one of the remaining districts each; the threat of destroying Egypt was, according to these sources, what really motivated Joseph to reveal himself to his brothers.

=== Testament of Judah ===

Before his death, Judah told his children about his bravery and heroism in the wars against the kings of Canaan and the family of Esau, also confessed his shortcomings caused by wine that led him astray in his relationship with Bathshua and Tamar. Judah admonished his sons not to love gold, and not to look upon the beauty of women, for through these things, the sons of Judah will fall into misery. In his last words, he reminded them to observe the whole law of the Lord.

===Dating the lifetime of Judah===
According to Classical rabbinical literature, Judah was born on 15 Sivan (early June); classical sources differ on the date of death, with the Book of Jubilees advocating a death at age 119, 18 years before Levi, but the midrashic Book of Jasher advocating a death at the age of 129.

The marriage of Judah and births of his children are described in a passage widely regarded as an abrupt change to the surrounding narrative. The passage is often regarded as presenting a significant chronological issue, as the surrounding context appears to constrain the events of the passage to happening within 22 years, and the context together with the passage itself requires the birth of the grandson of Judah and of his son&#x27;s wife, and the birth of that son to have happened within this time (to be consistent, this requires an average of less than 8 years gap per generation). According to textual scholars, the reason for the abrupt interruption this passage causes to the surrounding narrative, and the chronological anomaly it seems to present, is that it derives from the Jahwist source, while the immediately surrounding narrative is from the Elohist.

== Tomb ==

Local Muslim and Samaritan traditions placed the tomb of Judah (&quot;Nabi Huda ibn Sayyidna Ya&#x27;qub&quot;, &quot;the prophet Judah, son of our lord Jacob&quot;) at al-Yahudiya, present-day Yehud. Today, it is a destination of Jewish pilgrimage.

Another local tradition, held by Druze and Muslims, places the tomb of Judah in &quot;Nabi Yehuda&quot;, a maqam located near Horvat Omrit in the Hula Valley.

<text>Judeo-Persian refers to both a group of Jewish dialects spoken by Jews and Judeo-Persian texts (written in Hebrew alphabet). As a collective term, Judeo-Persian refers to a number of Judeo-Iranian languages spoken by Jewish communities throughout the formerly extensive Persian Empire, including Iranian Jews, Mountain Jews, Afghan Jews, and Bukharan Jews.

The speakers refer to their language as &quot;Fārsi&quot;. Some non-Jews refer to it as &quot;dzhidi&quot; (also written as &quot;zidi&quot;, &quot;judi&quot; or &quot;jidi&quot;), which means &quot;Jewish&quot; in a derogatory sense.

==Literature==
There is an extensive Judeo-Persian poetic religious literature, closely modeled on classical Persian poetry. The most famous poet was Mowlānā Shāhin-i Shirāzi (14th century CE), who composed epic versifications of parts of the Bible, such as the &quot;Musā-nāmah&quot; (an epic poem recounting the story of Moses); later poets composed lyric poetry in style of Persian mysticism. Much of this literature was collected around the beginning of the twentieth century by the ּּBukharan rabbi Shimon Hakham, who founded a printing press in Israel.
===Earliest Judeo-Persian writings===
The earliest evidence of Judeo-Persian writing dates back to the 8th century CE. These documents written in Hebrew script document the existence of Jewish communities writing in Judeo-Persian across historical Persia. Archaeologists working in the 20th century discovered Judeo-Persian writings in locations as far-spread as southern India, Xinjiang Province, Cairo, and present-day Iran and Afghanistan. They include court documents, trade documents, headstones, stone inscriptions, and works on religious matters. 
===Biblical epics===
====Mowlānā Shāhin-i Shirāzi====
The most famous Judeo-Persian poet is the 14th century Shahin-i Shirazi who composed two versified Biblical epics: the first based on the Pentateuch and the second centered on the Book of Esther and the Book of Ezra. In his writing, Shahin uses a language typical of his era’s Classical Persian and does not employ the same level of Hebrew words as other Judeo-Persian writers. 
=====Pentateuchal epic=====
Shahin&#x27;s Pentateuchal epic cycle consists of 10,000 metered couplet (distich) versification of the Books of Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy written in 1327, and a 8,700 couplet length versification of Genesis composed in 1358. He focuses on narratives from the Pentateuch that are also prominent in Islamic literature such as the fall of Satan, Joseph (Yusuf) and Zulaykha, and Jacob’s mourning of the lost Joseph. Shahin fashions his biblical epics off of Ferdowsi’s Shahnameh, the most renowned Persian epic in Persian mythology. This includes styling Moses after heroes from Persian epic heroes, contributing to a glorification of Moses prevalent in Judeo-Persian literature. Shahin omits certain elements of the Pentateuch such as the legal sections. In a short adaptation of the Book of Job appended to his versification of Genesis, Shahin leaves out the speeches from Job’s friends and God’s response while including the less-central insults from Job’s wife.
=====&quot;Ardarshir-nameh&quot;=====
Shahin’s Ardashir-namah consists of 9,000 metered couplets that adapt narratives from the Books of Esther, Nehemiah, and Ezra. He also includes non-biblical storylines that parallel the Shahnameh and Nizami’s Khamsa. It recounts the biblical narrative of Ardashir (Xerxes) and Esther; and a love story between Ardashir and a Chinese princess. The &quot;Ezra-nameh&quot; is shorter and often grouped with the &quot;Ardashir-nameh&quot;.
==== Emrani ====
Emrani was a 15th century Persian poet who like Shahin, wrote Persian in Hebrew script. Born in Isfahan, he moved to Kashan in his twenties and lived there until his death. The 10,000-verse &quot;Fath-nameh&quot; adapts the Books of Joshua, Ruth, and Samuel 1 and 2. Like Shahin’s biblical epics, it displays a strong Shahnameh influence. His &quot;Hanuka-nameh&quot; is a shorter (1,800 verses) versification of the Maccabees’ rebellion against the Greeks. This work, authored in 1524, relies heavily on the apocryphal First Book of Maccabees. Emrani employs more Hebrew vocabulary than Shahin and relies more on narratives from the Bible and rabbinic literature.

==== &quot; Shoftim-nameh&quot; ====
Written in 1692 by Aaron ben Mashiah, this versification of the Book of Judges uses the same meter as Emrani’s &quot;Fath-nameh&quot;.

==== &quot;Daniel-nameh&quot; ====
In 1606, Khajah of Bukhara versified narratives from the Book of Daniel, apocrypha, and Midrashim (rabbinic commentaries).

===Mishnah and midrash===
====&quot;Ganj-nameh&quot;====
Emrani’s &quot;Ganj-nameh&quot; is a commentary on the Mishnaic ethical tractate Avot. It numbers nearly 5,000 rhyming couplets and includes Sufi terminology. There are many extant manuscripts of this work, indicating its widespread popularity among Persian-speaking Jews. It was completed in 1536 and was likely Emrani’s final work. It is an ethical and didactic work that deals with broader ethical themes compared to his previous writings in this genre. The &quot;Ganj-nameh&quot; consists of 88 sections that each elaborate a saying or two from the Abot, following the sequence of the Abot itself. The first five sections make up the introduction and follows the structure of many Persian introductions – praise and supplication of God and a history of the work’s composition. Emrani praises Moses. The rest of the &quot;Ganj-nameh&quot; belongs to the counsel genre prominent in Persian literature and combines the epic, midrashic, mystic and didactic techniques present in Emrani’s earlier works. 

===Biblical commentaries===
====Shimon Hakham: Commentary on Exodus 3-4====
Shimon Hakham, a Bukharan rabbi who later emigrated to Jerusalem, edited and published at least 29 works in Judeo-Persian, including a complete edition of Shahin’s Torah commentary. He included alongside this edition his own prose commentary on the Book of Exodus.

===Historical texts===
====Bābāi b. Lutf: &quot;Kitab-i Anusi&quot; (The Book of a Forced Convert)====
Babai b. Lutf was a 16th century Jewish author and historian born in Kashan. His 5,000-couplet length Kitab-i Anusi recounts the persecution of Iranian Jews under the reigns of three Safavid shahs: ‘Abbas I, Safi I, and ‘Abbas II who collectively reigned from 1571 to 1666. It focuses on the forced conversions of Jews during this time.
====Bābāi b. Farhād: &quot;Kitāb-i Sar guzasht-i Kāshān&quot; (The Book of Events in Kashan)====
Ibn Lutf’s grandson, Babai b. Farhad, composed a 1,300-couplet chronicle on the persecution faced by Jews in Kashan during the Afghan Invasion of Iran which occurred from 1722 to 1730. Ibn Farhad describes the voluntary conversion of Jews in Kashan to Islam and how they were allowed to return to their faith seven months later. 

===Liturgical Poems===
*&quot;Haft Barādarān&quot; (הפת בראדראן): An epic poem by Emrani read on the fast of Tish&#x27;a BeAb based on the story of Hannah and her seven sons
* &quot;Sheshom Dar&quot; (ששום דר): A poem read on the festival of Shavuot detailing the commandments, based on the Azharot literature 
* &quot;Shirā-ye Hātāni&quot;, or &quot;Shira&quot;, often beginning with the words &quot;Shodi hātān mobārak bād&quot; (שדִי חתן מבארך באד): Verses sung at weddings and festive occasions. Originally composed for the groom during the &quot;Shabbat Hatan&quot; (the shabbat following the wedding) 
* Aminā:
**&quot;In Praise of Moses&quot;
**&quot;A Ghazal on the Twelve Tribes&quot;

===Printing===
Beginning in the late 19th century, Jerusalem became a center for printing Judeo-Persian literature. Works from many genres were printed, as well as translations of non-Jewish works into Judeo-Persian. Some of the major figures in this movement included Jews from Central Asia such as Shimon Hakham. In 1917, a “Society for the Promotion of the Hebrew Language” was established in Tehran alongside a Judeo-Persian and Hebrew printing press. This group also published a Judeo-Persian newspaper, &quot;Ha-Ge&#x27;ulah&quot;. Two other Judeo-Persian newspapers were also published in Bukhara and Samarkand.

==Characteristics==

In the absence of a unified dialect of Persian spoken by Jews, Judeo-Persian refers to local dialects spoken by Jews. It is notable for its preservation of certain incorporation of Hebrew words; however, this is less prominent than in other Jewish languages. Judeo-Median is often used to designate the group of dialects spoke by Jewish communities in Central Iran.Early Judeo-Persian writings displays various orthographies that sometimes demonstrate pronunciation differences from Persian. It preserves a transitional stage in certain linguistic features. It also exhibits a variety of constructions for ezafe and for verbs in passive voice. Judeo-Persian versions of the Bible do not follow Persian syntax, instead glossing the Hebrew word-for-word.
===Contemporary Dialects===
Some of the primary Iranian cities with Jewish dialects are Kashan, Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman, Shiraz, Borujerd, and Hamadan. Vernaculars spoken by Jews in Persian-speaking Central Asia are often referred to as Judeo-Tajik. Judeo-Tat is spoken in the eastern Caucasus and is considered mutually intelligible with standard Persian today. Many speakers of these Iranian dialects have left Iran and few native speakers remain. As a result, Judeo-Median languages are considered endangered according to the Endangered Language Alliance.

<doc id="206657" wikidata="Q975844" url="?curid=206657" title="USS Shangri-La">
<text>USS &quot;Shangri-La&quot; (CV/CVA/CVS-38) was one of 24 s completed during or shortly after World War II for the United States Navy.

Commissioned in 1944 and named after the mythical paradise of the same name, &quot;Shangri-La&quot; participated in several campaigns in the Pacific Theater of Operations in World War II, earning two battle stars. Like many of her sister ships, she was decommissioned shortly after the end of the war, but was modernized and recommissioned in the early 1950s, and redesignated as an attack carrier (CVA). She operated in both the Pacific and Atlantic / Mediterranean for several years, and late in her career was redesignated as an anti-submarine carrier (CVS). She earned three battle stars for service in the Vietnam War.

&quot;Shangri-La&quot; was decommissioned in 1971 and sold for scrap in 1988.

==Name==
The naming of the ship was a radical departure from the general practice of the time, which was to name aircraft carriers after battles or previous US Navy ships. After the Doolittle Raid, launched from the aircraft carrier , President Roosevelt answered a reporter&#x27;s question by saying that the raid had been launched from &quot;Shangri-La&quot;, the fictional faraway land of the James Hilton novel &quot;Lost Horizon&quot;.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Shangri-La&quot; was one of the &quot;long-hull&quot; &quot;Essex&quot;-class ships. She was laid down by the Norfolk Navy Yard, at Portsmouth, Virginia, on 15 January 1943, and was launched on 24 February 1944, sponsored by Josephine Doolittle (wife of Jimmy Doolittle). &quot;Shangri-La&quot; was commissioned on 15 September 1944, with Captain James D. Barner in command.

==Service history==

===World War II===
&quot;Shangri-La&quot; completed fitting out at Norfolk and took her shakedown cruise to Trinidad, between 15 September and 21 December 1944, at which time she returned to Norfolk. On 17 January 1945, she stood out of Hampton Roads, formed up with large cruiser and destroyer , and sailed for Panama. The three ships arrived at Cristobal, Panama Canal Zone on 23 January and transited the canal the next day. &quot;Shangri-La&quot; departed from Balboa on 25 January and arrived at San Diego, California, on 4 February. There she loaded passengers, stores, and extra planes for transit to Hawaii and got underway on 7 February. Upon her arrival at Pearl Harbor on 15 February, she commenced two months of duty, qualifying land-based Navy pilots in carrier landings.

On 10 April, she weighed anchor for Ulithi Atoll where she arrived 10 days later. After an overnight stay in the lagoon, &quot;Shangri-La&quot; departed Ulithi in company with destroyers and to report for duty with Vice Admiral Marc A. Mitscher&#x27;s Task Force 58 (TF 58). On 24 April, she joined Task Group 58.4 (TG 58.4) while it was conducting a fueling rendezvous with TG 50.8. The next day, &quot;Shangri-La&quot; and her air group, CVG-85, launched their first strike against the Japanese. The target was Okino Daito Jima, a group of islands several hundred miles to the southeast of Okinawa. Her planes successfully destroyed radar and radio installations there and, upon their recovery, the task group sailed for Okinawa. &quot;Shangri-La&quot; supplied combat air patrols for the task group and close air support for the 10th Army on Okinawa before returning to Ulithi on 14 May.

While at Ulithi, &quot;Shangri-La&quot; became the flagship of Carrier Task Force 2. Vice Admiral John S. McCain, Sr. hoisted his flag on &quot;Shangri-La&quot; on 18 May. Six days later, TG 58.4, with &quot;Shangri-La&quot; in company, sortied from the lagoon. On 28 May, TG 58.4 became TG 38.4 and McCain relieved Mitscher as Commander, TF 38, retaining &quot;Shangri-La&quot; as his flagship. On 2–3 June, the task force launched air strikes on the Japanese home islands – aimed particularly at Kyūshū, the southernmost of the major islands. Facing the stiffest airborne resistance to date, &quot;Shangri-La&quot;″s airmen suffered their heaviest casualties.

On 4–5 June, she moved off to the northwest to avoid a typhoon; then, on 6 June, her planes returned to close air support duty over Okinawa. On 8 June, her air group hit Kyūshū again, and, on the following day, they came back to Okinawa. On 10 June, the task force cleared Okinawa for Leyte, conducting drills en route. &quot;Shangri-La&quot; entered Leyte Gulf and anchored in San Pedro Bay on 13 June. She remained at anchor there for the rest of June, engaged in upkeep and recreation.

On 1 July, &quot;Shangri-La&quot; got underway from Leyte to return to the combat zone. On the 2nd, the oath of office of Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Air was administered to John L. Sullivan on board &quot;Shangri-La&quot;, the first ceremony of its type ever undertaken in a combat zone. Eight days later, her air group commenced a series of air strikes against Japan which lasted until the capitulation on 15 August.

&quot;Shangri-La&quot;″s planes ranged the length of the island chain during these raids. On the 10th, they attacked Tokyo, the first raid there since the strikes of the previous February. On 14–15 July, they pounded Honshū and Hokkaidō and, on 18 July, returned to Tokyo, also taking part in an attack against the battleship , moored close to shore at Yokosuka. From 20 to 22 July, &quot;Shangri-La&quot; joined the logistics group for fuel, replacement aircraft, and mail. By 24 July, her pilots were attacking shipping in the vicinity of Kure. They returned the next day for a repeat performance, before departing for a two-day replenishment period on 26–27 July. On the following day, &quot;Shangri-La&quot;″s aircraft damaged light cruiser and battleship , the latter so badly that she beached and flooded. She later had to be abandoned. They pummeled Tokyo again on 30 July, then cleared the area to replenish on 31 July and 1 August.

&quot;Shangri-La&quot; spent the next four days in the retirement area waiting for a typhoon to pass. On 9 August, after heavy fog had caused the cancellation of the previous day&#x27;s missions, the carrier sent her planes aloft to bomb Honshū and Hokkaido once again. The next day, they raided Tokyo and central Honshū, then retired from the area for logistics. She evaded another typhoon on 11–12 August, then hit Tokyo again on 13 August. After replenishing on 14 August, she sent planes to strike the airfields around Tokyo on the morning of 15 August 1945. Soon thereafter, Japan&#x27;s capitulation was announced; and the fleet was ordered to cease hostilities. &quot;Shangri-La&quot; steamed around in the strike area from 15 to 23 August, patrolling the Honshū area on the latter date. From 23 August – 16 September, her planes sortied on missions of mercy, air-dropping supplies to Allied prisoners of war in Japan.

&quot;Shangri-La&quot; entered Tokyo Bay on 16 September, almost two weeks after the surrender ceremony onboard battleship , and remained there until 1 October. Departing Japan, she arrived at Okinawa on 4 October staying until 6 October, and then headed for the United States in company with Task Unit 38.1.1. She sailed into San Pedro Bay, on 21 October and stayed at Long Beach for three weeks. On 5 November, she shifted to San Diego, departing that port a month later for Bremerton, Washington. She entered Puget Sound on 9 December, underwent availability until 30 December, and then returned to San Diego.

===Post-war===
Upon her return, &quot;Shangri-La&quot; began normal operations out of San Diego, primarily engaged in pilot carrier landing qualifications. In May 1946, she sailed for the Central Pacific to participate in Operation Crossroads, the atomic bomb tests conducted at Bikini Atoll. Following this, she made a brief training cruise to Pearl Harbor, then wintered at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard. In March 1947, she deployed again, calling at Pearl Harbor and Sydney, Australia. When she returned to the United States, &quot;Shangri-La&quot; was decommissioned and placed in the Reserve Fleet at San Francisco on 7 November 1947.

&quot;Shangri-La&quot; recommissioned on 10 May 1951, Captain Francis L. Busey in command. For the next year, she conducted training and readiness operations out of Boston, Massachusetts. Reclassified as an attack carrier (&quot;CVA-38&quot;) in 1952, she returned to Puget Sound that fall and decommissioned again on 14 November, this time for modernization at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard. During the next two years, she received an angled flight deck and twin steam catapults, and her aircraft elevators and arresting gear were overhauled. At a cost of approximately $7 million, she was virtually a new ship when she commissioned for the third time on 10 January 1955, Captain Roscoe L. Newman commanding; she was the second (after ) operational U.S. carrier with an angled flight deck. She conducted intensive fleet training for the remainder of 1955, then deployed to the Far East on 5 January 1956. Until 1960, she alternated western Pacific cruises with operations out of San Diego. On 16 March 1960, she put to sea from San Diego en route to her new home port, Mayport, Florida. She entered Mayport after visits to Callao, Peru; Valparaíso, Chile; Port of Spain, Trinidad; Bayonne, New Jersey; and Norfolk, Virginia.

After six weeks of underway training in the local operating area around Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, she embarked upon her first Atlantic deployment, a NATO exercise followed by liberty in Southampton, England. Almost immediately after her return to Mayport, &quot;Shangri-La&quot; was ordered back to sea—this time to the Caribbean in response to trouble in Guatemala and Nicaragua. She returned to Mayport on 25 November and remained in port for more than two months.

Between 1961 and 1970, &quot;Shangri-La&quot; alternated between deployments to the Mediterranean and operations in the western Atlantic, out of Mayport. She sailed east for her first tour of duty with the 6th Fleet on 2 February 1961. She returned to the United States that fall and entered the New York Naval Shipyard. Back in Mayport by the beginning of 1962, &quot;Shangri-La&quot; stood out again for the Mediterranean on 7 February. After about six months of cruising with the 6th Fleet, she departed the Mediterranean in mid-August and arrived in Mayport on 28 August.

Following a month&#x27;s stay at her home port, the aircraft carrier headed for New York and a major overhaul. &quot;Shangri-La&quot; was modified extensively during her stay in the yard. Four of her 5 in (127 mm) mounts were removed, but she received a new air search and height finding radar and a new arrester system. In addition, much of her electrical and engineering equipment was renovated. After sea trials and visits to Bayonne and Norfolk, &quot;Shangri-La&quot; returned to Mayport for a week in late March 1963; then put to sea for operations in the Caribbean. Eight months of similar duty followed before &quot;Shangri-La&quot; weighed anchor for another deployment. On 1 October 1963, she headed back to the 6th Fleet for a seven-month tour.

===Vietnam War===
&quot;Shangri-La&quot; continued her United States Second Fleet and Sixth Fleet assignments for the next six years. From 15 February 1965 to 20 September 1965, she made a Mediterranean deployment with Carrier Air Wing 10 embarked.

In the fall of 1965, &quot;Shangri-La&quot; collided with the destroyer off Sardinia. &quot;Shangri-La&quot; was struck below the waterline, breaching the hull. On the destroyer, one man was killed and another injured. The ship itself suffered a bent hull. There were no casualties on the carrier and the hole was quickly patched at sea by the crew of the tender ship . As a result of this incident, &quot;Shangri-La&quot; underwent an extensive overhaul during the winter of 1965 and the spring of 1966, this time at Philadelphia, then resumed operations as before. On 30 June 1969, she was redesignated an antisubmarine warfare carrier (&quot;CVS-38&quot;).

In 1970, &quot;Shangri-La&quot; returned to the western Pacific after an absence of 10 years. She got underway from Mayport on 5 March, stopped at Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 13 to 16 March, and headed east through the Atlantic and Indian oceans. She arrived in Subic Bay, Philippines on 4 April, and during the next seven months launched combat sorties from Yankee Station. Her tours of duty on Yankee Station were punctuated by frequent logistics trips to Subic Bay, by visits to Manila and Hong Kong, in October, and by 12 days in drydock at Yokosuka, Japan, in July.

On 9 November, &quot;Shangri-La&quot; stood out of Subic Bay to return home. En route to Mayport, she visited Sydney, Australia; Wellington, New Zealand; and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. She arrived in Mayport on 16 December and began preparations for inactivation. After inactivation overhaul at the Boston Naval Shipyard, South Annex, &quot;Shangri-La&quot; decommissioned on 30 July 1971. She was placed in the Atlantic Reserve Fleet and berthed at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard.

===Fate===

&quot;Shangri-La&quot; remained in the reserve fleet for the next 11 years, and was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 15 July 1982. She was retained by MARAD for several years to provide spare parts for the training carrier . On 9 August 1988, she was sold for scrap and later towed to Taiwan for demolition.

One of &quot;Shangri-La&quot;″s four propellers is on display outside Meding&#x27;s Seafood in Milford, Delaware.

On 6 September 2017, USS &quot;Shangri-La&quot;″s bell was placed on display at Jacksonville University NROTC Building as a permanent loan. The bell was found by a farmer in his field at Hudson, Florida, in June 2017. He notified the USS Shangri La Reunion Group, who repaired and restored the bell before loaning it to the NROTC unit.

<text>The UNIVAC 1103 or ERA 1103, a successor to the UNIVAC 1101, is a computer system designed by Engineering Research Associates and built by the Remington Rand corporation in October 1953. It was the first computer for which Seymour Cray was credited with design work.

==History==
Even before the completion of the &quot;Atlas&quot; (UNIVAC 1101), the Navy asked Engineering Research Associates to design a more powerful machine. This project became Task 29, and the computer was designated &quot;Atlas II&quot;.

In 1952, Engineering Research Associates asked the Armed Forces Security Agency (the predecessor of the NSA) for approval to sell the &quot;Atlas II&quot; commercially. Permission was given, on the condition that several specialized instructions would be removed. The commercial version then became the UNIVAC 1103. Because of security classification, Remington Rand management was unaware of this machine before this. The first commercially sold UNIVAC 1103 was sold to the aircraft manufacturer Convair, where Marvin Stein worked with it.

Remington Rand announced the UNIVAC 1103 in February 1953. The machine competed with the IBM 701 in the scientific computation market. In early 1954, a committee of the Joint Chiefs of Staff requested that the two machines be compared for the purpose of using them for a Joint Numerical Weather Prediction project. Based on the trials, the two machines had comparable computational speed, with a slight advantage for IBM&#x27;s machine, but the Univac 1103 was favored unanimously for its significantly faster input/output equipment.

The successor machines are the UNIVAC 1103A or &quot;Univac Scientific&quot;, which improved upon the design by replacing the unreliable Williams tube memory with magnetic-core memory, adding hardware floating-point instructions, and perhaps the earliest occurrence of a hardware interrupt feature. That was succeeded by the UNIVAC 1105.

==Technical details==
System Logic was done with around 3,900 tubes (mostly triodes) and 9,000 diodes, in total at least 12 distinct tube types were used in the design. The system used electrostatic storage, consisting of 36 Williams tubes with a capacity of 1024 bits each, giving a total random-access memory of 1024 words of 36 bits each. Each of the 36 Williams tubes was five inches in diameter. A magnetic drum memory provided 16,384 words. Both the electrostatic and drum memories were directly addressable: addresses 0 through 01777 (Octal) were in electrostatic memory and 040000 through 077777 (Octal) were on the drum.

Fixed-point numbers had a 1-bit sign and a 35-bit value, with negative values represented in ones&#x27; complement format.

Instructions had a 6-bit operation code and two 15-bit operand addresses.

Programming systems for the machine included the RECO regional coding assembler by Remington-Rand, the RAWOOP one-pass assembler and SNAP floating point interpretive system authored by the Ramo-Wooldridge Corporation of Los Angeles, the FLIP floating point arithmetic interpretive system by Consolidated Vultee Aircraft of San Diego, and the CHIP floating-point interpretive system by Wright Field in Ohio.

UNIVAC 1103/A weighed about .

==1103A==
The UNIVAC 1103A or Univac Scientific is an upgraded version introduced in March 1956.

Significant new features on the 1103A were its magnetic-core memory and the addition of interrupts to the processor. The UNIVAC 1103A had up to 12,288 words of 36-bit magnetic core memory, in one to three banks of 4,096 words each.

Fixed-point numbers had a one-bit sign and a 35-bit value, with negative values represented in ones&#x27; complement format. Floating-point numbers had a one-bit sign, an eight-bit characteristic, and a 27-bit mantissa. Instructions had a six-bit operation code and two 15-bit operand addresses.

The 1103A was contemporary with, and a competitor to, the IBM 704, which also employed vacuum-tube logic, magnetic-core memory, and floating-point hardware.

A version of this machine was sold to the Lewis Research Center, NACA (National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics) in Cleveland, Ohio. It had the first magnetic core of 1096 words of 36 bits. The magnetic drum storage has a capacity of 16,384 words, and the clock speed is 500KHz. Input/output is teletype paper tape. When NACA became NASA in 1958, a series of improvements was begun to improve functionality and reliability. Over the next ten years, the machine was significantly upgraded by replacing the magnetic core with a commercial solid state 16,384 word magnetic core system. An 8 unit magnetic tape system, a floating point arithmetic unit, and an indirect addressing unit were designed and built in-house. All solid-state commercial electronics modules were interfaced to the vacuum tube electronics in the original machine.

==1104==
The 1104 system is a 30-bit version of the 1103 built for Westinghouse Electric in 1957, for use on the BOMARC Missile Program. However, by the time the BOMARC was deployed in the 1960s, a more modern computer (a version of the AN/USQ-20, designated the G-40) had replaced the UNIVAC 1104.

==1105==
The UNIVAC 1105 is a follow-on computer to the UNIVAC 1103A introduced by Sperry Rand in September 1958. The main changes from the 1103 included a Buffered I/O system and an optional third memory cabinet extending core memory by an additional 4,096 words.

<doc id="206662" wikidata="Q156149" url="?curid=206662" title="65 Cybele">
<text>65 Cybele is one of the largest asteroids in the Solar System. It is located in the outer asteroid belt. It is thought to be a remnant primordial body. It gives its name to the Cybele group of asteroids that orbit outward from the Sun from the 2:1 orbital resonance with Jupiter. The X-type asteroid has a relatively short rotation period of 6.0814 hours. It was discovered by Wilhelm Tempel in 1861, and named after Cybele, the earth goddess.

== Discovery and naming ==

&quot;Cybele&quot; was discovered on 8 March 1861, by German astronomer Wilhelm Tempel from the Marseilles Observatory in southeastern France. A minor controversy arose from its naming process. Tempel had awarded the honour of naming the asteroid to Carl August von Steinheil in recognition of his achievements in telescope production. Von Steinheil elected to name it &quot;Maximiliana&quot; after the reigning monarch Maximilian II of Bavaria. At the time, asteroids were conventionally given classical names, and a number of astronomers protested this contemporary appellation. The name Cybele was chosen instead, referring to the Phrygian goddess of the earth. (The previously discovered 45 Eugenia, 54 Alexandra, and 64 Angelina had nevertheless also been given non-classical names; 64 Angelina had also been discovered by Tempel, but its name stood despite similar protests.)

== Physical characteristics ==

The first Cybelian stellar occultation was observed on 17 October 1979, in the Soviet Union. The asteroid appeared to have an irregular shape, with the longest chord being measured as 245 km, closely matching results determined by the IRAS satellite in 1983 &quot;(see below)&quot;. During the same 1979 occultation, a hint of a possible 11 km wide minor-planet moon at 917 km distance was detected, but has since never been corroborated. As of 2017, neither the &quot;Asteroid Lightcurve Data Base&quot; nor &quot;Johnston″s archive&quot; consider &quot;Cybele&quot; to be a binary asteroid.

=== Diameter estimates ===

Mean diameter estimates for &quot;Cybele&quot; range between 218.56 and 300.54 kilometers. According to observations by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS in 1983, the asteroid has a diameter of 237.26 km. The NEOWISE mission of NASA&#x27;s Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer gave a diameter of 218.56 and 276.58 km. The largest estimates of 300.54 km is from the Japanese Akari satellite. In 2004, Müller estimated &quot;Cybele&quot; using thermophysical modelling (TPM) to have dimensions of 302 × 290 × 232 km, which corresponds to a mean-diameter of 273.0 km.

Observations in 2021 show that Cybele&#x27;s present shape very closely matches what would be expected if it were in hydrostatic equilibrium, in contrast to the other large Cybele asteroids 87 Sylvia and 107 Camilla. This suggests a transition point between irregular small asteroids and equilibrium larger bodies at around 1.5 × 1019 kg, and makes it possible that outer Solar System bodies at least 260 km in diameter might have formed in equilibrium (note Saturn IX Phoebe, which at 212 km diameter probably formed in equilibrium). However, it is not certain if Cybele&#x27;s current shape is its primordial one, or if it is the result of a large impact as on the very round 10 Hygiea and 31 Euphrosyne. Today no Cybele family is observable, but since Cybele orbits in a rather unstable region, any such family would be dispersed within 2 billion years. Cybele&#x27;s larger density compared to Sylvia and Camilla does somewhat favour the first hypothesis, though. (Sylvia and Camilla experienced impacts, as evidenced by their satellites and by the Sylvia family.)

== Spectrum ==

Examination of the asteroid&#x27;s infrared spectrum shows an absorption feature that is similar to the one present in the spectrum of 24 Themis. This can be explained by the presence of water ice. The asteroid may be covered in a layer of fine silicate dust mixed with small amounts of water-ice and organic solids.

== Recent occultations ==

On August 24, 2008, Cybele occulted 2UCAC 24389317, a 12.7-magnitude star in the constellation Ophiuchus which showed a long axis of at least 294 km. On 11 October 2009, Cybele occulted a 13.4-magnitude star in the constellation Aquarius.

<doc id="206663" wikidata="Q588666" url="?curid=206663" title="Minstrel show">
<text>The minstrel show, also called minstrelsy, was an American form of theater developed in the early 19th century. The shows were performed by mostly white actors wearing blackface makeup for the purpose of comically portraying racial stereotypes of African Americans. There were also some African-American performers and black-only minstrel groups that formed and toured. Minstrel shows stereotyped blacks as dimwitted, lazy, buffoonish, cowardly, superstitious, and happy-go-lucky. Each show consisted of comic skits, variety acts, dancing, and music performances that depicted people specifically of African descent.

Blackface minstrelsy was the first uniquely American form of theater, and for many minstrel shows emerged as brief burlesques and comic entr&#x27;actes in the early 1830s in the Northeastern states. They were developed into full-fledged art form in the next decade. By 1848, blackface minstrel shows were the national artform, translating formal art such as opera into popular terms for a general audience. During the 1830s and 1840s at the height of its popularity, it was at the epicenter of the American music industry. For several decades, it provided the means through which American whites viewed black people. On the one hand, it had strong racist aspects; on the other, it afforded white Americans more awareness, albeit distorted, of some aspects of black culture in America. Although the minstrel shows were extremely popular, being &quot;consistently packed with families from all walks of life and every ethnic group&quot;, they were also controversial. Integrationists decried them as falsely showing happy slaves while at the same time making fun of them; segregationists thought such shows were &quot;disrespectful&quot; of social norms as they portrayed runaway slaves with sympathy and would undermine slavery.

During the Civil War, minstrelsy&#x27;s popularity declined. By the turn of the 20th century the minstrel show enjoyed but a shadow of its former popularity, having been replaced for the most part by the Vaudeville style of theatre. The form survived as professional entertainment until about 1910; amateur performances continued until the 1960s in high schools and local theaters.

The typical minstrel performance followed a three-act structure. The troupe first danced onto stage then exchanged wisecracks and sang songs. The second part featured a variety of entertainments, including the pun-filled stump speech. The final act consisted of a slapstick musical plantation skit or a send-up of a popular play. Minstrel songs and sketches featured several stock characters, most popularly the slave and the dandy. These were further divided into sub-archetypes such as the mammy, her counterpart the old darky, the provocative mulatto wench, and the black soldier. Minstrels claimed that their songs and dances were authentically black, although the extent of the genuine black influence remains debated. Spirituals (known as &quot;jubilees&quot;) entered the repertoire in the 1870s, marking the first undeniably black music to be used in minstrelsy.

The genre has had a lasting legacy and influence and was featured in the British television series &quot;The Black and White Minstrel Show&quot; as recently as the mid-1970s. Generally, as the civil rights movement progressed and gained acceptance, minstrelsy lost popularity.

==History==

===Early development===
Minstrel shows were popular before slavery was abolished, sufficiently so that Frederick Douglass described blackface performers as &quot;...the filthy scum of white society, who have stolen from us a complexion denied them by nature, in which to make money, and pander to the corrupt taste of their white fellow citizens.&quot; Circus sideshows included Negro performers, minstrels were exhibited in museums, Wild West shows, and in musical ensembles. Black people were also part of traveling medicine shows, which were on the cheaper side of outdoor shows for the paying masses. Such traveling medicine shows also employed a Negro band and minstrels, including both men and women. Museums were set up to appeal to the low income audience, housing freak shows, wax sculptures, as well as exhibits of exoticism, mingled with magic, and necessarily live performance. African Americans were most often displayed as savages, cannibals, or natural freaks.

Although white theatrical portrayals of black characters date back to as early as 1604, the character of Othello being traditionally played by an actor in black makeup, the minstrel show as such has later origins. By the late 18th century, blackface characters began appearing on the American stage, usually as &quot;servant&quot; types whose roles did little more than provide some element of comic relief. Lewis Hallam is frequently cited as the first actor to perform in blackface based on an impression he did of a drunken black man in a 1769 staging of &quot;The Padlock&quot;. Later research by Cockrell and others disputes this claim. Eventually, similar performers appeared in entr&#x27;actes in New York City theaters and other venues such as taverns and circuses. As a result, the blackface &quot;Sambo&quot; character came to supplant the &quot;tall-tale-telling Yankee&quot; and &quot;frontiersman&quot; character-types in popularity, and white actors such as Charles Mathews, George Washington Dixon, and Edwin Forrest began to build reputations as blackface performers. Author Constance Rourke even claimed that Forrest&#x27;s impression was so good he could fool blacks when he mingled with them in the streets.

Thomas Dartmouth Rice&#x27;s successful song-and-dance number, &quot;Jump Jim Crow&quot;, brought blackface performance to a new level of prominence in the early 1830s. At the height of Rice&#x27;s success, &quot;The Boston Post&quot; wrote, &quot;The two most popular characters in the world at the present are [Queen] Victoria of the United Kingdom and Jump Jim Crow.&quot; As early as the 1820s, blackface performers called themselves &quot;Ethiopian delineators&quot;; from then into the early 1840s, unlike the later heyday of minstrelsy, they performed either solo or in small teams.

Blackface soon found a home in the taverns of New York&#x27;s less respectable precincts of Lower Broadway, the Bowery, and Chatham Street. It also appeared on more respectable stages, most often as an &quot;entr&#x27;acte&quot;. Upper class houses at first limited the number of such acts they would show, but beginning in 1841, blackface performers frequently took to the stage at even the classy Park Theatre, much to the dismay of some patrons. Theater was a participatory activity, and the lower classes came to dominate the playhouse. They threw things at actors or orchestras who performed unpopular material, and rowdy audiences eventually prevented the Bowery Theatre from staging high drama at all. Typical blackface acts of the period were short burlesques, often with mock Shakespearean titles like &quot;Hamlet the Dainty&quot;, &quot;Bad Breath, the Crane of Chowder&quot;, &quot;Julius Sneezer&quot; or &quot;Dars-de-Money&quot;.

Meanwhile, at least some whites were interested in black song and dance by actual black performers. Nineteenth-century New York slaves shingle danced for spare change on their days off, and musicians played what they claimed to be &quot;Negro music&quot; on so-called black instruments like the banjo. The &quot;New Orleans Picayune&quot; wrote that a singing New Orleans street vendor called Old Corn Meal would bring &quot;a fortune to any man who would start on a professional tour with him&quot;. Rice responded by adding a &quot;Corn Meal&quot; skit to his act. Meanwhile, there had been several attempts at legitimate black stage performance, the most ambitious probably being New York&#x27;s African Grove theater, founded and operated by free blacks in 1821, with a repertoire drawing heavily on Shakespeare. A rival theater company paid people to &quot;riot&quot; and cause disturbances at the theater, and it was shut down by the police when neighbors complained of the commotion.

White, working-class Northerners could identify with the characters portrayed in early blackface performances. This coincided with the rise of groups struggling for workingman&#x27;s nativism and pro-Southern causes, and faux black performances came to confirm pre-existing racist concepts and to establish new ones. Following a pattern that had been pioneered by Rice, minstrelsy united workers and &quot;class superiors&quot; against a common black enemy, symbolized especially by the character of the black dandy. In this same period, the class-conscious but racially inclusive rhetoric of &quot;wage slavery&quot; was largely supplanted by a racist one of &quot;white slavery&quot;. This suggested that the abuses against northern factory workers were a graver ill than the treatment of black slaves—or by a less class-conscious rhetoric of &quot;productive&quot; versus &quot;unproductive&quot; elements of society. On the other hand, views on slavery were fairly evenly presented in minstrelsy, and some songs even suggested the creation of a coalition of working blacks and whites to end the institution.

Among the appeals and racial stereotypes of early blackface performance were the pleasure of the grotesque and its infantilization of blacks. These allowed—by proxy, and without full identification—childish fun and other low pleasures in an industrializing world where workers were increasingly expected to abandon such things.

===Height===

With the Panic of 1837, theater attendance suffered, and concerts were one of the few attractions that could still make money. In 1843, four blackface performers led by Dan Emmett combined to stage just such a concert at the New York Bowery Amphitheatre, calling themselves the Virginia Minstrels. The minstrel show as a complete evening&#x27;s entertainment was born. The show had little structure. The four sat in a semicircle, played songs, and traded wisecracks. One gave a stump speech in dialect, and they ended with a lively plantation song. The term &quot;minstrel&quot; had previously been reserved for traveling white singing groups, but Emmett and company made it synonymous with blackface performance, and by using it, signalled that they were reaching out to a new, middle-class audience.

The &quot;Herald&quot; wrote that the production was &quot;entirely exempt from the vulgarities and other objectionable features, which have hitherto characterized Negro extravaganzas.&quot; In 1845, the Ethiopian Serenaders purged their show of low humor and surpassed the Virginia Minstrels in popularity. Shortly thereafter, Edwin Pearce Christy founded Christy&#x27;s Minstrels, combining the refined singing of the Ethiopian Serenaders (epitomized by the work of Christy&#x27;s composer Stephen Foster) with the Virginia Minstrels&#x27; bawdy schtick. Christy&#x27;s company established the three-act template into which minstrel shows would fall for the next few decades. This change to respectability prompted theater owners to enforce new rules to make playhouses calmer and quieter.

Minstrels toured the same circuits as opera companies, circuses, and European itinerant entertainers, with venues ranging from lavish opera houses to makeshift tavern stages. Life on the road entailed an &quot;endless series of one-nighters, travel on accident-prone railroads, in poor housing subject to fires, in empty rooms that they had to convert into theaters, arrest on trumped up charges, exposed to deadly diseases, and managers and agents who skipped out with all the troupe&#x27;s money.&quot; The more popular groups stuck to the main circuit that ran through the Northeast; some even went to Europe, which allowed their competitors to establish themselves in their absence. By the late 1840s, a Southern tour had opened from Baltimore to New Orleans. Circuits through the Midwest and as far as California followed by the 1860s. As its popularity increased, theaters sprang up specifically for minstrel performance, often with names such as the Ethiopian Opera House and the like. Many amateur troupes performed only a few local shows before disbanding. Meanwhile, celebrities like Emmett continued to perform solo.

The rise of the minstrel show coincided with the growth of the abolitionist movement. Many Northerners were concerned for the oppressed blacks of the South, but most had no idea how these slaves lived day-to-day. Blackface performance had been inconsistent on this subject; some slaves were happy, others victims of a cruel and inhuman institution. However, in the 1850s, minstrelsy became more pro-slavery as political and satirical content was toned down or removed entirely. Most minstrels projected a greatly romanticized and exaggerated image of black life with cheerful, simple slaves always ready to sing and dance and to please their masters. (Less frequently, the masters cruelly split up black lovers or sexually assaulted black women.) The lyrics and dialogue were generally racist, satiric, and largely white in origin. Songs about slaves yearning to return to their masters were plentiful. Figures like the Northern dandy and the homesick ex-slave reinforced the idea that blacks did not belong, nor did they want to belong, in Northern society.

Adaptations of &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot; sprang up rapidly after its publication (all were unlicensed by its author Harriet Beecher Stowe, who refused to sell the theatrical rights for any sum). While all incorporated some elements of minstrelsy, their content varied significantly, from serious productions retaining the book&#x27;s antislavery message like that of George Aiken&#x27;s, to minstrel show parodies which generally excised characters such as the cruel master Simon Legree, retaining only the &quot;plantation frolics&quot;, differing from earlier minstrel shows only in name, to outright condemnation of Stowe as uninterested in the suffering of the white working class. &quot;Tom shows&quot; continued into the 20th century, continuing to blend the comic aspects of minstrelsy with the more serious plot of the novel.

Minstrelsy&#x27;s racism (and sexism) could be vicious. There were comic songs in which blacks were &quot;roasted, fished for, smoked like tobacco, peeled like potatoes, planted in the soil, or dried up and hung as advertisements&quot;, and there were multiple songs in which a black man accidentally put out a black woman&#x27;s eyes. On the other hand, the fact that the minstrel show broached the subjects of slavery and race at all is perhaps more significant than the racist manner in which it did so. Despite these pro-plantation attitudes, minstrelsy was banned in many Southern cities. Its association with the North was such that as secessionist attitudes grew stronger, minstrels on Southern tours became convenient targets of anti-Yankee sentiment.

Non-race-related humor came from lampoons of other subjects, including aristocratic whites such as politicians, doctors, and lawyers. Women&#x27;s rights was another serious subject that appeared with some regularity in antebellum minstrelsy, almost always to ridicule the notion. The women&#x27;s rights lecture became common in stump speeches. When one character joked, &quot;Jim, I tink de ladies oughter vote&quot;, another replied, &quot;No, Mr. Johnson, ladies am supposed to care berry little about polytick, and yet de majority ob em am strongly tached to parties.&quot; Minstrel humor was simple and relied heavily on slapstick and wordplay. Performers told riddles: &quot;The difference between a schoolmaster and an engineer is that one trains the mind and the other minds the train.&quot;

With the advent of the American Civil War, minstrels remained mostly neutral and satirized both sides. However, as the war reached Northern soil, troupes turned their loyalties to the Union. Sad songs and sketches came to dominate in reflection of the mood of a bereaved nation. Troupes performed skits about dying soldiers and their weeping widows, and about mourning white mothers. &quot;When This Cruel War Is Over&quot; became the hit of the period, selling over a million copies of sheet music. To balance the somber mood, minstrels put on patriotic numbers like &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;, accompanied by depictions of scenes from American history that lionized figures like George Washington and Andrew Jackson. Social commentary grew increasingly important to the show. Performers criticized Northern society and those they felt responsible for the breakup of the country, who opposed reunification, or who profited from a nation at war. Emancipation was either opposed through &quot;happy plantation&quot; material, or mildly supported with pieces that depicted slavery in a negative light. Eventually, direct criticism of the South became more biting.

===Decline===

Minstrelsy lost popularity during the Civil War. New entertainments such as variety shows, musical comedies and vaudeville appeared in the North, backed by master promoters like P. T. Barnum who wooed audiences away. Blackface troupes responded by traveling farther and farther afield, with their primary base now in the South and Midwest. By 1883 there were no resident minstrel troupes in New York, only performances by travelling troupes.

Those minstrels who stayed in New York and similar cities followed Barnum&#x27;s lead by advertising relentlessly and emphasizing spectacle. Troupes ballooned; as many as 19 performers could be on stage at once, and J. H. Haverly&#x27;s United Mastodon Minstrels had over 100 members. Scenery grew lavish and expensive, and specialty acts such as strongmen, acrobats, or circus freaks sometimes appeared. These changes made minstrelsy unprofitable for smaller troupes. Minstrel troupes, which previously had tended to be owned by performers, now tended to be owned by professional managers such as Haverly.

Other minstrel troupes tried to satisfy different, less socially acceptable tastes. Female acts had made a stir in variety shows, and Madame Rentz&#x27;s Female Minstrels ran with the idea, first performing in 1870 in skimpy costumes and tights, the scantily clad women being the real attraction. Their success gave rise to at least 11 all-female troupes by 1871, one of which did away with blackface altogether. Ultimately, the girlie show emerged as a form in its own right. Mainstream minstrelsy continued to emphasize its propriety and &quot;fun without vulgarity&quot;, but traditional troupes adopted some of these elements in the guise of the female impersonator. A well-played prima donna character, as popularised by the performer Francis Leon, was considered to be critical to success in the postwar period.

This new minstrelsy maintained an emphasis on refined music. Most troupes added jubilees, or spirituals, to their repertoire in the 1870s. These were fairly authentic religious slave songs borrowed from traveling black singing groups. Other troupes drifted further from minstrelsy&#x27;s roots. When George Primrose and Billy West broke with Haverly&#x27;s Mastodons in 1877, they did away with blackface for all but the endmen and dressed themselves in lavish finery and powdered wigs. They decorated the stage with elaborate backdrops and performed no slapstick whatsoever. Their brand of minstrelsy differed from other entertainments only in name. Other troupes followed to varying extents, and pre-war style minstrelsy found itself confined to explicitly nostalgic &quot;histories of minstrelsy&quot; features.

Social commentary continued to dominate most performances, with plantation material constituting only a small part of the repertoire. This effect was amplified as minstrelsy featuring black performers took off in its own right and stressed its connection to the old plantations. The main target of criticism was the moral decay of the urbanized North. Cities were painted as corrupt, as homes to unjust poverty, and as dens of &quot;city slickers&quot; who lay in wait to prey upon new arrivals. Minstrels stressed traditional family life; stories told of reunification between mothers and sons thought dead in the war. Women&#x27;s rights, disrespectful children, low church attendance, and sexual promiscuity became symptoms of decline in family values and of moral decay. Of course, Northern black characters carried these vices even further. African-American members of Congress were one example, pictured as pawns of the Radical Republicans.

By the 1890s, minstrelsy formed only a small part of American entertainment, and, by 1919, a mere three troupes dominated the scene. A key cause was rising salary costs, which for the leading companies had risen from $400 a week in the 1860s to $2500 a week in 1912, far too high to be profitable in most cases, especially with the rise of motion pictures, which could easily outcompete the touring minstrel shows on ticket prices. Small companies and amateurs carried the traditional minstrel show into the 20th century, now with an audience mostly in the rural South, while black-owned troupes continued traveling to more outlying areas like the West. These black troupes were one of minstrelsy&#x27;s last bastions, as more white actors moved into vaudeville. A survey of nine surviving professional minstrel performers in 1947 found a variety of reasons given for the near-total collapse of professional minstrel shows; the rise of motion pictures and other forms of stage show, the inability to recruit performers for minstrel troupes&#x27; gruelling tours, and the difficulty of finding theater bookings at a cost cheap enough to make back. None thought changing societal attitudes to race relations played a role in its decline. Community amateur blackface minstrel shows persisted in northern New York State into the 1960s. The University of Vermont banned the minstrel-like Kake Walk as part of the winter Carnival in 1969.

===Black minstrels===
In the 1840s and &#x27;50s, William Henry Lane and Thomas Dilward became the first African Americans to perform on the minstrel stage. All-black troupes followed as early as 1855. These companies emphasized that their ethnicity made them the only true delineators of black song and dance, with one advertisement describing a troupe as &quot;SEVEN SLAVES just from Alabama, who are EARNING THEIR FREEDOM by giving concerts under the guidance of their Northern friends.&quot; White curiosity proved a powerful motivator, and the shows were patronized by people who wanted to see blacks acting &quot;spontaneously&quot; and &quot;naturally.&quot; Promoters seized on this, one billing his troupe as &quot;THE DARKY AS HE IS AT HOME, DARKY LIFE IN THE CORNFIELD, Canebrake, BARNYARD, AND ON THE LEVEE AND FLATBOAT.&quot; Keeping with convention, black minstrels still corked the faces of at least the endmen. One commentator described a mostly uncorked black troupe as &quot;mulattoes of a medium shade except two, who were light. ... The end men were each rendered thoroughly black by burnt cork.&quot; The minstrels themselves promoted their performing abilities, quoting reviews that favorably compared them to popular white troupes. These black companies often featured female minstrels.
One or two African-American troupes dominated the scene for much of the late 1860s and 1870s. The first of these was Brooker and Clayton&#x27;s Georgia Minstrels, who played the Northeast around 1865. Sam Hague&#x27;s Slave Troupe of Georgia Minstrels formed shortly thereafter and toured England to great success beginning in 1866. In the 1870s, white entrepreneurs bought most of the successful black companies. Charles Callender obtained Sam Hague&#x27;s troupe in 1872 and renamed it Callender&#x27;s Georgia Minstrels. They became the most popular black troupe in America, and the words &quot;Callender&quot; and &quot;Georgia&quot; came to be synonymous with the institution of black minstrelsy. J. H. Haverly, in turn, purchased Callender&#x27;s troupe in 1878 and applied his strategy of enlarging troupe size and embellishing sets. When this company went to Europe, Gustave and Charles Frohman took the opportunity to promote their Callender&#x27;s Consolidated Colored Minstrels. Their success was such that the Frohmans bought Haverly&#x27;s group and merged it with theirs, creating a virtual monopoly on the market. The company split in three to better canvas the nation and dominated black minstrelsy throughout the 1880s. Individual black performers like Billy Kersands, James A. Bland, Sam Lucas, Martin Francis and Wallace King grew as famous as any featured white performer.

Racism made black minstrelsy a difficult profession. When playing Southern towns, performers had to stay in character off stage, dressed in ragged &quot;slave clothes&quot; and perpetually smiling. Troupes left town quickly after each performance, and some had so much trouble securing lodging that they hired whole trains or had custom sleeping cars built, complete with hidden compartments to hide in should things turn ugly. Even these were no haven, as whites sometimes used the cars for target practice. Their salaries, though higher than those of most blacks of the period, failed to reach levels earned by white performers; even superstars like Kersands earned slightly less than featured white minstrels. Most black troupes did not last long.

In content, early black minstrelsy differed little from its white counterpart. As the white troupes drifted from plantation subjects in the mid-1870s however, black troupes placed a new emphasis on it. The addition of jubilee singing gave black minstrelsy a popularity boost as the black troupes were rightly believed to be the most authentic performers of such material. Other significant differences were that the black minstrels added religious themes to their shows while whites shied from them, and that the black companies commonly ended the first act of the show with a military high-stepping, brass band burlesque, a practice adopted after Callender&#x27;s Minstrels used it in 1875 or 1876. Although black minstrelsy lent credence to racist ideals of blackness, many African-American minstrels worked to subtly alter these stereotypes and to poke fun at white society. One jubilee described heaven as a place &quot;where de white folks must let the darkeys be&quot; and they could not be &quot;bought and sold&quot;. In plantation material, aged black characters were rarely reunited with long-lost masters like they were in white minstrelsy.

African Americans formed a large part of the black minstrels&#x27; audience, especially for smaller troupes. In fact, their numbers were so great that many theater owners had to relax rules relegating black patrons to certain areas. The reasons for the popularity of this openly racist form of entertainment with black audiences have long been debated by historians. Perhaps they felt in on the joke, laughing at the over-the-top characters from a sense of &quot;in-group recognition&quot;. Maybe they even implicitly endorsed the racist antics, or they felt some connection to elements of an African culture that had been suppressed but was visible, albeit in racist, exaggerated form, in minstrel personages. They certainly got many jokes that flew over whites&#x27; heads or registered as only quaint distractions. An undeniable draw for black audiences was simply seeing fellow African Americans on stage; black minstrels were largely viewed as celebrities. Formally educated African Americans, on the other hand, either disregarded black minstrelsy or openly disdained it. Still, black minstrelsy was the first large-scale opportunity for African Americans to enter American show business. Black minstrels were therefore viewed as a success. Pat H. Chappelle capitalized on this and created the first totally black-owned black vaudeville show, The Rabbit&#x27;s Foot Company, which performed with an all-black cast that elevated the level of shows with sophisticated and fun comedy. It successfully toured mainly the Southwest and Southeast, as well as in New Jersey and New York City.

==Structure==
The Christy Minstrels established the basic structure of the minstrel show in the 1840s. A crowd-gathering parade to the theater often preceded the performance. The show itself was divided into three major sections. During the first, the entire troupe danced onto stage singing a popular song. Upon the instruction of the &quot;interlocutor&quot;, a sort of host, they sat in a semicircle. Various stock characters always took the same positions: the genteel interlocutor in the middle, flanked by &quot;Mr Tambo&quot; and &quot;Mr Bones&quot;, who served as the &quot;endmen&quot; or &quot;cornermen&quot;. The interlocutor acted as a master of ceremonies and as a dignified, if pompous, straight man. He had a somewhat aristocratic demeanor, a &quot;codfish aristocrat&quot;, while the endmen exchanged jokes and performed a variety of humorous songs. Over time, the first act came to include maudlin numbers not always in dialect. One minstrel, usually a tenor, came to specialize in this part; such singers often became celebrities, especially with women. Initially, an upbeat plantation song and dance ended the act; later it was more common for the first act to end with a &quot;walkaround&quot;, including dances in the style of a cakewalk.

The second portion of the show, called the &quot;olio&quot;, was historically the last to evolve, as its real purpose was to allow for the setting of the stage for act three behind the curtain. It had more of a variety show structure. Performers danced, played instruments, did acrobatics, and demonstrated other amusing talents. Troupes offered parodies of European-style entertainments, and European troupes themselves sometimes performed. The highlight was when one actor, typically one of the endmen, delivered a faux-black-dialect &quot;stump speech&quot;, a long oration about anything from nonsense to science, society, or politics, during which the dim-witted character tried to speak eloquently, only to deliver countless malapropisms, jokes, and unintentional puns. All the while, the speaker moved about like a clown, standing on his head and almost always falling off his stump at some point. With blackface makeup serving as fool&#x27;s mask, these stump speakers could deliver biting social criticism without offending the audience, although the focus was usually on sending up unpopular issues and making fun of blacks&#x27; inability to make sense of them. Many troupes employed a stump specialist with a trademark style and material.

The &quot;afterpiece&quot; rounded out the production. In the early days of the minstrel show, this was often a skit set on a Southern plantation that usually included song-and-dance numbers and featured Sambo- and Mammy-type characters in slapstick situations. The emphasis lay on an idealized plantation life and the happy slaves who lived there. Nevertheless, antislavery viewpoints sometimes surfaced in the guise of family members separated by slavery, runaways, or even slave uprisings. A few stories highlighted black trickster figures who managed to get the better of their masters. Beginning in the mid-1850s, performers did burlesque renditions of other plays; both Shakespeare and contemporary playwrights were common targets. The humor of these came from the inept black characters trying to perform some element of high white culture. Slapstick humor pervaded the afterpiece, including cream pies to the face, inflated bladders, and on-stage fireworks. Material from &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot; dominated beginning in 1853. The afterpiece allowed the minstrels to introduce new characters, some of whom became quite popular and spread from troupe to troupe.

==Characters==

The earliest minstrel characters took as their base popular white stage archetypes—frontiersmen, fishermen, hunters, and riverboatsmen whose depictions drew heavily from the tall tale—and added exaggerated blackface speech and makeup. These Jim Crows and Gumbo Chaffs fought and boasted that they could &quot;wip [their] weight in wildcats&quot; or &quot;eat an alligator&quot;. As public opinion toward blacks changed, however, so did the minstrel stereotypes. Eventually, several stock characters emerged. Chief among these were the slave, who often maintained the earlier name Jim Crow, and the dandy, known frequently as Zip Coon, from the song &quot;Zip Coon&quot;. &quot;First performed by George Dixon in 1834, Zip Coon made a mockery of free blacks. An arrogant, ostentatious figure, he dressed in high style and spoke in a series of malaprops and puns that undermined his attempts to appear dignified.&quot;

The white actors who portrayed these characters spoke an exaggerated form of Black Vernacular English. The blackface makeup and illustrations on programs and sheet music depicted them with huge eyeballs, very wide noses, and thick-lipped mouths that hung open or grinned foolishly; one character expressed his love for a woman with &quot;lips so large a lover could not kiss them all at once&quot;. They had huge feet and preferred &quot;possum&quot; and &quot;coon&quot; to more civilized fare. Minstrel characters were often described in animalistic terms, with &quot;wool&quot; instead of hair, &quot;bleating&quot; like sheep, and having &quot;darky cubs&quot; instead of children. Other claims were that blacks had to drink ink when they got sick &quot;to restore their color&quot; and that they had to file their hair rather than cut it. They were inherently musical, dancing and frolicking through the night with no need for sleep.

Thomas &quot;Daddy&quot; Rice introduced the earliest slave archetype with his song &quot;Jump Jim Crow&quot; and its accompanying dance. He claimed to have learned the number by watching an old, limping black stable hand dancing and singing, &quot;Wheel about and turn about and do jus&#x27; so/Eb&#x27;ry time I wheel about I jump Jim Crow.&quot; Other early minstrel performers quickly adopted Rice&#x27;s character.

Slave characters in general came to be low-comedy types with names that matched the instruments they played: &quot;Brudder Tambo&quot; (or simply &quot;Tambo&quot;) for the tambourine and &quot;Brudder Bones&quot; (or &quot;Bones&quot;) for the bone castanets or bones. These &quot;endmen&quot; (for their position in the minstrel semicircle) were ignorant and poorly spoken, being conned, electrocuted, or run over in various sketches. They happily shared their stupidity; one slave character said that to get to China, one had only to go up in a balloon and wait for the world to rotate below. Highly musical and unable to sit still, they constantly contorted their bodies wildly while singing.

Tambo and Bones&#x27;s simple-mindedness and lack of sophistication were highlighted by pairing them with a straight man master of ceremonies called the &quot;interlocutor&quot;. This character, although usually in blackface, spoke in aristocratic English and used a much larger vocabulary. The humor of these exchanges came from the misunderstandings on the part of the endmen when talking to the interlocutor:

:Interlocutor: I&#x27;m astonished at you, Why, the idea of a man of your mental caliber talking about such sordid matters, right after listening to such a beautiful song! Have you no sentiment left?

:Tambo: No, I haven&#x27;t got a cent left.

Tambo and Bones were favorites of the audience, and their repartee with the interlocutor was for many the best part of the show. There was an element of laughing with them for the audience, as they frequently made light of the interlocutor&#x27;s grandiose ways.

The interlocutor was responsible for beginning and ending each segment of the show. To this end, he had to be able to gauge the mood of the audience and know when it was time to move on. Accordingly, the actor who played the role was paid very well in comparison to other non-featured performers.

There were many variants on the slave archetype. The &quot;old darky&quot; or &quot;old uncle&quot; formed the head of the idyllic black family. Like other slave characters, he was highly musical and none-too-bright, but he had favorable aspects like his loving nature and the sentiments he raised regarding love for the aged, ideas of old friendships, and the cohesiveness of the family. His death and the pain it caused his master was a common theme in sentimental songs. Alternatively, the master could die, leaving the old darky to mourn. Stephen Foster&#x27;s &quot;Old Uncle Ned&quot; was the most popular song on this subject. Less frequently, the old darky might be cast out by a cruel master when he grew too old to work. After the Civil War, this character became the most common figure in plantation sketches. He frequently cried about the loss of his home during the war, only to meet up with someone from the past such as the child of his former master. In contrast, the trickster, often called Jasper Jack, appeared less frequently.
The counterpart to the slave was the &quot;dandy&quot;, a common character in the afterpiece. He was a Northern, urban black man trying to live above his station by mimicking white, upper-class speech and dress—usually to no good effect. Dandy characters often went by Zip Coon, after the song popularized by George Washington Dixon, although others had pretentious names like Count Julius Caesar Mars Napoleon Sinclair Brown. Their clothing was a ludicrous parody of upper-class dress: coats with tails and padded shoulders, white gloves, monocles, fake mustaches, and gaudy watch chains. They spent their time primping and preening, going to parties, dancing and strutting, and wooing women.

=== Soldier ===
The black soldier became another stock type during the Civil War and merged qualities of the slave and the dandy. He was acknowledged for playing some role in the war, but he was more frequently lampooned for bumbling through his drills or for thinking his uniform made him the equal of his white counterparts. He was usually better at retreating than fighting, and, like the dandy, he preferred partying to serious pursuits. Still, his introduction allowed for some return to themes of the breakup of the plantation family.

===Female===
Female characters ranged from the sexually provocative to the laughable. These roles were almost always played by men in drag (most famously George Christy, Francis Leon and Barney Williams), even though American theater outside minstrelsy was filled with actresses at this time. &quot;Mammy&quot; or the &quot;old auntie&quot; was the old darky&#x27;s counterpart. She often went by the name of Aunt Dinah Roh after the song of that title. Mammy was lovable to both blacks and whites, matronly, but hearkening to European peasant woman sensibilities. Her main role was to be the devoted mother figure in scenarios about the perfect plantation family.

The &quot;&quot;, &quot;yaller gal&quot; or &quot;prima donna&quot; was a mulatto who combined the light skin and facial features of a white woman with the perceived sexual promiscuity and exoticism of a black woman. Her beauty and flirtatiousness made her a common target for male characters, although she usually proved capricious and elusive. After the Civil War, the wench emerged as the most important specialist role in the minstrel troupe; men could alternately be titillated and disgusted, while women could admire the illusion and high fashion. The role was most strongly associated with the song &quot;Miss Lucy Long&quot;, so the character many times bore that name. Actress Olive Logan commented that some actors were &quot;marvelously well fitted by nature for it, having well-defined soprano voices, plump shoulders, beardless faces, and tiny hands and feet.&quot; Many of these actors were teen-aged boys. In contrast was the &quot;funny old gal&quot;, a slapstick role played by a large man in motley clothing and large, flapping shoes. The humor she invoked often turned on the male characters&#x27; desire for a woman whom the audience would perceive as unattractive.

===Non-black===
Non-black stereotypes played a significant role in minstrelsy, and, although still performed in blackface, were distinguished by their lack of black dialect.

====Native American====
American Indians before the Civil War were usually depicted as innocent symbols of the pre-industrial world or as pitiable victims whose peaceful existence had been shattered by the encroachment of the white man. However, as the United States turned its attentions West, American Indians became savage, pagan obstacles to progress. These characters were formidable scalpers to be feared, not ridiculed; any humor in such scenarios usually derived from a black character trying to act like one of the frightful savages. One sketch began with white men and American Indians enjoying a communal meal in a frontier setting. As the American Indians became intoxicated, they grew more and more antagonistic, and the army ultimately had to intervene to prevent the massacre of the whites. Even favorably presented American Indian characters usually died tragically.

====East Asian====
Depictions of East Asians began during the California Gold Rush when minstrels encountered Chinese out West. John Chinaman minstrel songs arising in the 1850s depicted the stock character of John Chinaman as effeminate and unmanly, often centering on the stock character&#x27;s failed pursuit of white women. Minstrels caricatured East Asians by their strange language (&quot;ching chang chung&quot;), odd eating habits (dogs and cats), and propensity for wearing pigtails. Parodies of Japanese became popular when a Japanese acrobat troupe toured the United States beginning in 1865. A run of Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;The Mikado&quot; in the mid-1880s inspired another wave of Asian characterizations.

====White====
The few white characters in minstrelsy were stereotypes of immigrant groups like the Irish and Germans. Irish characters first appeared in the 1840s, portrayed as hotheaded, odious drunkards who spoke in a thick brogue. However, beginning in the 1850s, many Irishmen joined minstrelsy, and Irish theatergoers probably came to represent a significant part of the audience, so this negative image was muted. Germans, on the other hand, were portrayed favorably from their introduction to minstrelsy in the 1860s. They were responsible and sensible, though still portrayed as humorous for their large size, hearty appetites, and heavy &quot;Dutch&quot; accents. Part of this positive portrayal no doubt came about because some of the actors portraying German characters were German themselves.

==Music and dance==

&quot;Minstrelsy evolved from several different American entertainment traditions; the traveling circus, medicine shows, shivaree, Irish dance and music with African syncopated rhythms, musical halls and traveling theatre.&quot; Music and dance were the heart of the minstrel show and a large reason for its popularity. Around the time of the 1830s, there was a lot of national conflict as to how people viewed African Americans. Because of that interest in the Negro people, these songs granted the listener new knowledge about African Americans, who were different from themselves, even if the information was prejudiced. Troupes took advantage of this interest and marketed sheet music of the songs they featured so that viewers could enjoy them at home and other minstrels could adopt them for their act.

Early blackface songs often consisted of unrelated verses strung together by a common chorus. In this pre-Emmett minstrelsy, the music &quot;jangled the nerves of those who believed in music that was proper, respectable, polished, and harmonic, with recognizable melodies.&quot; It was thus a juxtaposition of &quot;vigorous earth-slapping footwork of black dances … with the Irish lineaments of blackface jigs and reels.&quot; Similar to the look of a blackface performer, the lyrics in the songs that were sung have a tone of mockery and a spirit of laughing at black Americans rather than with them. The minstrel show texts sometimes mixed black lore, such as stories about talking animals or slave tricksters, with humor from the region southwest of the Appalachians, itself a mixture of traditions from different races and cultures. Minstrel instruments were also a mélange: African banjo and tambourine with European fiddle and bones In short, early minstrel music and dance was not true black culture; it was a white reaction to it. This was the first large-scale appropriation and commercial exploitation of black culture by American whites.

In the late 1830s, a decidedly European structure and high-brow style became popular in minstrel music. The banjo, played with &quot;scientific touches of perfection&quot; and popularized by Joel Sweeney, became the heart of the minstrel band. Songs like the Virginia Minstrels&#x27; hit &quot;Old Dan Tucker&quot; have a catchy tune and energetic rhythm, melody and harmony; minstrel music was now for singing as well as dancing. The &quot;Spirit of the Times&quot; even described the music as vulgar because it was &quot;entirely too elegant&quot; and that the &quot;excellence&quot; of the singing &quot;[was] an objection to it.&quot; Others complained that the minstrels had foregone their black roots. In short, the Virginia Minstrels and their imitators wanted to please a new audience of predominantly white, middle-class Northerners, by playing music the spectators would find familiar and pleasant.

Despite the elements of ridicule contained in blackface performance, mid-nineteenth century white audiences, by and large, believed the songs and dances to be authentically black. For their part, the minstrels always billed themselves and their music as such. The songs were called &quot;plantation melodies&quot; or &quot;Ethiopian choruses&quot;, among other names. By using the black caricatures and so-called black music, the minstrels added a touch of the unknown to the evening&#x27;s entertainment, which was enough to fool audiences into accepting the whole performance as authentic.
The minstrels&#x27; dance styles, on the other hand, were much truer to their alleged source. The success of &quot;Jump Jim Crow&quot; is indicative: It was an old English tune with fairly standard lyrics, which leaves only Rice&#x27;s dance—wild upper-body movements with little movement below the waist—to explain its popularity. Dances like the Turkey Trot, the Buzzard Lope, and the Juba dance all had their origins in the plantations of the South, and some were popularized by black performers such as William Henry Lane, Signor Cornmeali (&quot;Old Corn Meal&quot;), and John &quot;Picayune&quot; Butler. One performance by Lane in 1842 was described as consisting of &quot;sliding steps, like a shuffle, and not the high steps of an Irish jig.&quot; Lane and the white men who mimicked him moved about the stage with no obvious foot movement. The walk around, a common feature of the minstrel show&#x27;s first act, was ultimately of West African origin and featured a competition between individuals hemmed in by the other minstrels. Elements of white tradition remained, of course, such as the fast-paced &quot;breakdown&quot; that formed part of the repertoire beginning with Rice. Minstrel dance was generally not held to the same mockery as other parts, although contemporaries such as Fanny Kemble argued that minstrel dances were merely a &quot;faint, feeble, impotent—in a word, pale Northern reproductions of that ineffable black conception.&quot;

The introduction of the jubilee, or spiritual, marked the minstrels&#x27; first undeniable adoption of black music. These songs remained relatively authentic in nature, antiphonal with a repetitive structure that relied heavily on call and response. The black troupes sang the most authentic jubilees, while white companies inserted humorous verses and replaced religious themes with plantation imagery, often starring the old darky. &quot;Jubilee&quot; eventually became synonymous with &quot;plantation&quot;.

===Composers===
In the 1840s, Stephen Foster&#x27;s music became the backbone of the minstrel show, with songs like &quot;Oh! Susanna&quot;, &quot;Camptown Races&quot; and &quot;Old Folks at Home&quot;, the latter now being the state song of Florida (and anthem, with revised lyrics). Dan Emmett, founder of the Virginia Minstels, also composed songs like &quot;Old Dan Tucker&quot; and &quot;Dixie&quot;, the unofficial anthem of the Confederacy, which were popular in this period.

===Influences===
How much influence black music had on minstrel performance remains a debated topic. Minstrel music certainly contained some element of black culture, added onto a base of European tradition with distinct Irish and Scottish folk music influences. According to the historian of music Larry Birnbaum, minstrel music primarily originated from English, Scottish, and Irish folk music. Musicologist Dale Cockrell argues that early minstrel music mixed both African and European traditions and that distinguishing black and white urban music during the 1830s is impossible. Insofar as the minstrels had authentic contact with black culture, it was via neighborhoods, taverns, theaters and waterfronts where blacks and whites could mingle freely. The inauthenticity of the music and the Irish and Scottish elements in it are explained by the fact that slaves were rarely allowed to play native African music and therefore had to adopt and adapt elements of European folk music. Compounding the problem is the difficulty in ascertaining how much minstrel music was written by black composers, as the custom at the time was to sell all rights to a song to publishers or other performers. Nevertheless, many troupes claimed to have carried out more serious &quot;fieldwork&quot;. Just as the American people came from all over the world, some of the first forms of truly American music and drama were composed of elements from many different places.

Many late-19th to early 20th century composers and musicians were involved in minstrelsy, in particular African Americans such as Scott Joplin, W.C. Handy, Ma Rainey, and other blues and jazz artists.

Minstrel songs influenced the repertoire of early country music and the folk music revival. Additionally, the banjo, appropriated by minstrel shows, became a prominent instrument in genres like bluegrass.

==Legacy==
The minstrel show played a powerful role in shaping assumptions about black people. However, unlike vehemently anti-black propaganda from the time, minstrelsy made this attitude palatable to a wide audience by couching it in the guise of well-intentioned paternalism.

Popular entertainment perpetuated the racist stereotype of the uneducated, ever-cheerful, and highly musical black person well into the 1950s. Even as the minstrel show was dying out in all but amateur theater, blackface performers became common acts on vaudeville stages and in legitimate drama. These entertainers kept the familiar songs, dances, and pseudo-black dialect, often in nostalgic looks back at the old minstrel show. The most famous of these performers is probably Al Jolson, who took blackface to the big screen in the 1920s in films such as &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot; (1927). His 1930 film &quot;Mammy&quot; uses the setting of a traveling minstrel show, giving an on-screen presentation of a performance. Likewise, when the sound era of cartoons began in the late 1920s, early animators such as Walt Disney gave characters such as Mickey Mouse (who already resembled blackface performers) a minstrel-show personality; the early Mickey is constantly singing and dancing and smiling. The face of Raggedy Ann is a color-reversed minstrel mask, and Raggedy Ann&#x27;s creator, Johnny Gruelle, designed the doll in part with the antics of blackface star Fred Stone in mind. As late as 1942, as demonstrated in the Warner Bros. cartoon &quot;Fresh Hare&quot;, minstrel shows could be used as a gag (in this case, Elmer Fudd and Bugs Bunny leading a chorus of &quot;Camptown Races&quot;) with the expectation, presumably, that audiences would get the reference. Radio shows got into the act, a fact perhaps best exemplified by the popular radio shows &quot;Two Black Crows&quot;, &quot;Sam &#x27;n&#x27; Henry&quot;, and &quot;Amos &#x27;n&#x27; Andy&quot;, A transcription survives from 1931 of &quot;The Blue Coal Minstrels&quot;, which uses many of the standard forms of the minstrel show, including Tambo, Bones and the interlocutor. The National Broadcasting Company, in a 1930 pamphlet, used the minstrel show as a point of reference in selling its services.

As recently as the mid-1970s the BBC broadcast &quot;The Black and White Minstrel Show&quot; starring the George Mitchell Minstrels. The racist archetypes that blackface minstrelsy helped to create persist to this day; some argue that this is even true in hip hop culture and movies. The 2000 Spike Lee movie &quot;Bamboozled&quot; alleges that modern black entertainment exploits African-American culture much as the minstrel shows did a century ago, for example.

Meanwhile, African-American actors were limited to the same old minstrel-defined roles for years to come and by playing them, made them more believable to white audiences. On the other hand, these parts opened the entertainment industry to African-American performers and gave them their first opportunity to alter those stereotypes. Many famous singers and actors gained their start in black minstrelsy, including W. C. Handy, Ida Cox, Ma Rainey, Bessie Smith, Ethel Waters, and Butterbeans and Susie. The Rabbit&#x27;s Foot Company was a variety troupe, founded in 1900 by an African American, Pat Chappelle, which drew on and developed the minstrel tradition while updating it and helping to develop and spread black musical styles. Besides Ma Rainey and Bessie Smith, later musicians working for &quot;the Foots&quot; included Louis Jordan, Brownie McGhee and Rufus Thomas, and the company was still touring as late as 1950. Its success was rivalled by other touring variety troupes, such as &quot;Silas Green from New Orleans.&quot;

The very structure of American entertainment bears minstrelsy&#x27;s imprint. The endless barrage of gags and puns appears in the work of the Marx Brothers and David and Jerry Zucker. The varied structure of songs, gags, &quot;hokum&quot; and dramatic pieces continued into vaudeville, variety shows, and to modern sketch comedy shows such as &quot;Hee Haw&quot; or, more distantly, &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; and &quot;In Living Color&quot;. Jokes once delivered by endmen are still told today: &quot;Why did the chicken cross the road?&quot; &quot;Why does a fireman wear red suspenders?&quot; Other jokes form part of the repertoire of modern comedians: &quot;Who was that lady I saw you with last night? That was no lady—that was my wife!&quot; The stump speech is an important precursor to modern comedy.

Another important legacy of minstrelsy is its music. The hokum blues genre carried over the dandy, the wench, the simple-minded slave characters (sometimes rendered as the rustic white &quot;rube&quot;) and even the interlocutor into early blues and country music incarnations through the medium of &quot;race music&quot; and &quot;hillbilly&quot; recordings. Many minstrel tunes are now popular folk songs. Most have been expunged of the exaggerated black dialect and the overt references to blacks. &quot;Dixie&quot;, for example, was adopted by the Confederacy as its unofficial national anthem and is still popular, and &quot;Carry Me Back to Old Virginny&quot; was sanitized and made the state song of Virginia until 1997. &quot;My Old Kentucky Home&quot; remains the state song of Kentucky. The instruments of the minstrel show were largely kept on, especially in the South. Minstrel performers from the last days of the shows, such as Uncle Dave Macon, helped popularize the banjo and fiddle in modern country music. And by introducing America to black dance and musical style, minstrels opened the nation to black cultural forms for the first time on a large scale.

==Motion pictures with minstrel show routines==
A small number of films available today contain authentic recreations of Minstrel show numbers and routines. Due to their content they are rarely (if ever) broadcast on television today, but are available on home video.
* &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot; (1903), an early &quot;full-length&quot; movie (between 10 and 14 minutes), was directed by Edwin S. Porter and used white actors in blackface in the major roles. Similar to the earlier &quot;Tom Shows&quot; it featured black stereotypes such as having the slaves dance in almost any context, including at a slave auction.
* &quot;A Plantation Act&quot; (1926), a Vitaphone sound-on-disc short film starring Al Jolson. Long thought to have been lost, a copy of the film and sound disc were located and the restored version has been issued as a bonus feature on the DVD release of &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot;.
* &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot; (1927), the first feature-length motion picture with synchronized dialogue sequences. Based on a play by Samson Raphaelson, the story tells of Jakie Rabinowitz (Al Jolson), the son of a devout Jewish family, who runs away from home to become a jazz singer.
* &quot;Why Bring That Up?&quot; (1929), a feature film starring Minstrel show comics Charles Mack and George Moran, also known as Two Black Crows.
* &quot;Mammy&quot; (1930), another Al Jolson film, this relives Jolson&#x27;s early years as a minstrel man. With songs by Irving Berlin, who is also credited with the original story titled &quot;Mr. Bones&quot;.
* &quot;King for a Day&quot; (1934), is a 21-minute short in which Bill Green, played by Bill &quot;Bojangles&quot; Robinson, after being denied a chance to audition wins a black minstrel show in a crap game. The endmen in the show in the film emulate traditional white blackface by a line of white greasepaint around their mouths.
* &quot;Show Boat&quot; (1936), film starring Irene Dunne, Allan Jones, Hattie McDaniel, Paul Robeson. One of the shows on board is a blackface minstrel act.
* &quot;Swing Time&quot; (1936), a musical starring Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers features a dance number entitled &quot;Bojangles of Harlem&quot; performed by Astaire in blackface.
* &quot;Honolulu&quot; (1939), in which Eleanor Powell performs a blackface dance homage to Bill &quot;Bojangles&quot; Robinson.
* &quot;Swanee River&quot; (1940), another fictionalized biographical film on Stephen Foster. It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Musical Scoring and was the last on-screen appearance of Al Jolson.
* &quot;Babes on Broadway&quot; (1941), a musical starring Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland. The next-to-last musical number is a medley of songs performed in blackface.
* &quot;Fresh Hare&quot; (1942), an animated short featuring Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd. The final scene, edited out of recent television broadcasts, shows Bunny and Fudd in blackface, along with five tall men in the same condition, singing &quot;Camptown Races&quot;.
* &quot;Holiday Inn&quot; (1942), contains a musical number entitled &quot;Abraham&quot; with Bing Crosby performing in blackface in the style of a minstrel show. Beginning in the 1980s, this number has been cut from many TV broadcasts.
* &quot;Dixie&quot; (1943), a film based on the life of songwriter Daniel Decatur Emmett. It includes Bing Crosby singing the film&#x27;s title song in blackface.
* &quot;The Adventures of Mark Twain&quot; (1944), blackface musicians perform a jolly number on the river vessel, in the scene where Captain Clemens rescues Charles Langdon from a thief.
* &quot;Here Come the Waves&quot; (1944), contains a show-within-a-show. It includes a minstrel routine performed by Bing Crosby and Sonny Tufts; their two characters then sing a musical number entitled &quot;Ac-Cen-Tchu-Ate the Positive&quot;.
* &quot;Minstrel Man&quot; (1944), a fictional film about the rise, fall, and revival of a minstrel performer&#x27;s career. It was nominated for two Academy Awards (Best Original Song and Best Original Score).

* &quot;Yes Sir, Mr. Bones&quot; (1951), is based around a young child who finds a rest home for retired minstrel performers. In &quot;flashback&quot; sequences, a number of actual minstrel veterans, including Scatman Crothers, Freeman Davis (aka &quot;Brother Bones&quot;), Ned Haverly, Phil Arnold, &quot;endmen&quot; Cotton Watts and Slim Williams, the dancing team of Boyce and Evans, and the comic duo Ches Davis and Emmett Miller, perform in the roles they popularized in Minstrel shows.
* &quot;I Dream of Jeanie&quot; (1952) aka &quot;I Dream of Jeanie (with the Light Brown Hair&quot;), a completely fictional film biography of Stephen Foster. Veteran performer Glen Turnbull makes a guest appearance as a blackface Minstrel performer in Christy&#x27;s Minstrels.
* &quot;Torch Song&quot; (1953), starring Joan Crawford, Michael Wilding, and Marjorie Rambeau, contains a musical number, done in blackface, entitled &quot;Two-faced Woman.&quot;
* &quot;White Christmas&quot; (1954), features a full-scale minstrel show number, but without blackface. The lyrics to the songs do not insinuate that minstrel shows involved blackface, but invoked much of the same linguistic mechanisms as minstrel shows, such as double entendre. The lyrics to the song also include the line &quot;I&#x27;d pawn my overcoat and vest / To see a minstrel show&quot;. 
* &quot;Bamboozled&quot; (2000), a satirical film using minstrelsy to lampoon American popular culture written and directed by Spike Lee.
* &quot;Masked and Anonymous&quot; (2003), set in a dystopian future. Ed Harris plays a blackfaced character in one scene.

<doc id="206666" wikidata="Q1389967" url="?curid=206666" title="John Manley">
<text>John Paul Manley (born January 5, 1950) is a Canadian lawyer, businessman, and politician who served as the eighth deputy prime minister of Canada from 2002 to 2003. He was Liberal Member of Parliament for Ottawa South from 1988 to 2004. 

As Foreign Minister during the September 11 attacks, Manley acted swiftly and proactively to address U.S. security while maintaining economic ties between the U.S. and Canada.
He chaired a special cabinet committee on security, and he was responsible for the &quot;Smart Border Declaration&quot;.
For this work, Manley was named &quot;Canada&#x27;s Newsmaker of the Year&quot; by &quot;Time magazine&quot; in 2001. 

Although a prominent Liberal, Manley was appointed by Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper in 2007 to head an independent, non-partisan panel reviewing Canada&#x27;s mission and future role in Afghanistan.
Most of the recommendations of the &quot;Independent Panel on Canada&#x27;s Future Role in Afghanistan&quot; (the &quot;Manley report&quot;) were accepted, including an extension of the mission beyond February 2009 while calling for more soldiers and equipment.

From January 2010 to October 2018 Manley was president and CEO of the Business Council of Canada.
He has held directorships of the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC), CAE Inc., Telus, and the Canadian Pacific Railway.
Manley served as Chair of Ontario&#x27;s Royal Commission on Electric Power planning following the northeast blackout of 2003.
He serves on the advisory board of the Leaders&#x27; Debates Commission.

==Early life and education==
Manley was born in Ottawa, Ontario, and attended Bell High School. He received a BA from Carleton University in 1971 and an LL.B. from the University of Ottawa in 1976. He also studied at the University of Lausanne. Manley was called to the Ontario bar in 1978.

After law school Manley clerked under Bora Laskin, the Chief Justice of Canada. He joined the Ottawa firm Perley, Robertson, Panet, Hill and McDougall, specializing in tax law.

==Cabinet career==
John Manley was first elected as a Member of Parliament in the 1988 election. When the Liberals came to power under Jean Chrétien following the 1993 election he became Minister of Industry. During his time in Industry, Manley was a staunch supporter of Canada-based research and development, and also of increased technology use in public schools. 
In particular, he felt that the so-called &quot;wired classroom&quot; would help to equalize the gap between urban and smaller, rural schools. These initiatives were partially aimed at combating the &quot;brain drain&quot;, and Manley himself stated that &quot;Canada needs to pursue policies that will make it a magnet for brains, attracting them from elsewhere and retaining the ones we have.&quot;
As Industry Minister, in January 2000 Manley proposed a multimillion dollar rescue package for cash-strapped Canadian National Hockey League teams, but withdrew the proposal within 48 hours following criticism that there were better uses for public funds.

Manley was appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs in 2000. He was responsible for the establishment of the &quot;Smart Border Declaration&quot;, a proactive strategy to address Canada-U.S. security issues following the September 11 attacks in 2001.
Manley&#x27;s approach addressed American security concerns without severing economic ties, which not only averted economic disaster for Canada, but also helped the U.S. since closure of the border would have magnified the negative impact of the 9/11 attacks. 

In October 2001, Manley was named chairman of a special cabinet committee on security that revamped immigration rules, antiterrorism laws, regulations on arrest and detention, and border procedures. Manley&#x27;s assertive responses helped to keep the &quot;hugely complex relationship with the U.S. on an even keel&quot; as Washington dealt with terrorist threats. 
Manley had good working relationships with U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell and U.S. Homeland Security chief Tom Ridge, and the director of Toronto&#x27;s &quot;Canadian Institute of Strategic Studies&quot; said &quot;Under Manley, the government of Canada talks to Washington, not at it.&quot;
For his work to swiftly and dramatically &quot;orchestrate a transformative moment in Canada&#x27;s history&quot;, Manley was named &quot;Canada&#x27;s Newsmaker of the Year&quot; by &quot;Time magazine&quot; in 2001. 

In January 2002 Manley was appointed Deputy Prime Minister and given special responsibility for security in response to 9/11.
In May 2002, Chrétien appointed Manley as Minister of Finance, following the departure of Paul Martin. Manley&#x27;s 2003 federal budget laid out billions of dollars in new spending, primarily for health-care, child-care, and First Nations. It also introduced new accountability features to help limit federal waste.

==Liberal leadership==
===2003 Liberal leadership election===

When Jean Chrétien announced his decision to retire, Manley was seen by many as the prime minister&#x27;s logical successor given his roles as deputy prime minister and as chair of the important economic and social policy cabinet committees.
However, Manley withdrew from the leadership race and endorsed Paul Martin in July 2003 when it became clear that Martin had an overwhelming lead.
Martin offered Manley a role as Ambassador to the United States, which Manley declined for personal and family reasons. 
Later in 2003, Manley announced his retirement from politics.

===2006 and 2009 Liberal leadership elections===
On January 25, 2006 Manley sent a letter to supporters indicating that he was not going to contest the Liberal leadership after the resignation of Paul Martin.
Martin had resigned after the January 23, 2006 election resulted in a Conservative Party minority in parliament.

Manley was mentioned again as a possible contender for the leadership of the Liberal Party after Stéphane Dion&#x27;s resignation following the October 14, 2008 election that resulted in a larger minority Conservative government. 
On November 4, 2008 Manley announced that he would not be a candidate.

==Membership on commissions and inquiries==
===Report on Canada&#x27;s Mission in Afghanistan===
On 12 October 2007, Manley was appointed by Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper to head an independent, non-partisan panel reviewing Canada&#x27;s mission and future role in Afghanistan, a position he had discussed with Liberal leader Stéphane Dion beforehand. Both Dion and Liberal Foreign Affairs critic Bob Rae had encouraging words for the panel.
Manley&#x27;s appointment was described as a &quot;masterstroke&quot; in a &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; editorial, given Manley&#x27;s evident qualifications as a former foreign minister and former chairman of a cabinet committee on public security and anti-terrorism established after 9/11.
Also, by appointing a prominent Liberal, bipartisan support could be built for what was originally a Liberal-mandated mission.

The &quot;Independent Panel on Canada&#x27;s Future Role in Afghanistan&quot; reported on January 28, 2008, in what became known as the Manley report. It argued for an indefinite extension of the mission beyond February 2009, but also pointed to logistical and equipment shortfalls, communications challenges with telling the mission&#x27;s story to Canadians, and a coming manpower strength shortage. The report&#x27;s recommendations were accepted by the House when the Liberals backed them along with the Conservatives.

===Other public service advisory roles===
Manley served as Chair of Ontario&#x27;s Royal Commission on Electric Power Planning in the wake of the eastern North American blackout of 2003.

Manley was co-chair of the &quot;Independent Task Force on the Future of North America&quot;, a project of the U.S.-based Council on Foreign Relations. In 2005, the Task Force released a report that advocated a North American &quot;economic and security community&quot; by 2010, the boundaries of which would be defined by a common external tariff and an outer security perimeter.
The three-country economic area would resemble the European Community, a predecessor of the European Union.

Manley has served as Chair of the Advisory Council of the Canadian Global Affairs Institute, a Fellow of the C.D. Howe Institute, and as Chair of the Canadian branch of the Trilateral Commission. He is a member of the International Advisory Council of the Brookings Institution and the Global Advisory Council of the Wilson Center.

Manley is a member of the advisory board of the Leaders&#x27; Debates Commission.
He has served on the boards of the not-for-profits CARE Canada, MaRS, the National Arts Centre Foundation, the University of Waterloo, the Conference Board of Canada, and the Institute for Research on Public Policy.

==Private sector positions==
On May 18, 2004, Manley joined the law firm McCarthy Tétrault as counsel, working in their Toronto and Ottawa offices. 
In September 2019, he joined law firm Bennett Jones as a Senior Business Advisor as part of the Governmental Affairs &amp; Public Policy group.

From 2010 to 2018, Manley was President and CEO of the not-for-profit Business Council of Canada.

John Manley has served as Chair of the Boards of Directors of Nortel, CIBC, CAE Inc. and Telus, and as a member of the Board of Directors of the Canadian Pacific Railway.

==Political ideology==
&quot;Globe and Mail&quot; political columnist Lawrence Martin said Manley is &quot;a broad-perspective pragmatist, who, while spending a lot of time with the Bay Street boys (you do that as an industry minister), has never been captive to them.&quot;

In an interview for the British think-tank The Bruges Group, Manley said of then-Prime Minister Justin Trudeau&#x27;s economic spending priorities: &quot;I see commitments on spending programmes that will not necessarily add to Canada&#x27;s productivity or support economic growth – so I&#x27;m one that&#x27;s a bit worried about the trajectory that we are on&quot;.

Manley is an advocate for the abolition of the Canadian monarchy. This point of view created quite a controversy when, in response to a reporter&#x27;s question, he stated &quot;I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s necessary for Canada to continue with the monarchy&quot; during a 2002 tour of Canada by the Queen. 
Manley served as the Queen&#x27;s official government escort when her 12-day tour concluded in the national capital region.

==Honours and awards==
John Manley is an Officer of the Order of Canada.

Manley holds Honorary Doctorates from the University of Ottawa, Carleton University, the University of Toronto, Western University, the University of Windsor and York University.

==Personal life==

John Manley is married to Judith Manley with whom he has three children.

Manley is an avid marathon runner.

<doc id="206668" wikidata="Q947374" url="?curid=206668" title="Polemarch">
<text>A polemarch (, from , &quot;polemarchos&quot;) was a senior military title in various ancient Greek city states (&quot;poleis&quot;). The title is derived from the words &quot;polemos&quot; (war) and &quot;archon&quot; (ruler, leader) and translates as &quot;warleader&quot; or &quot;warlord&quot;. The name indicates that the polemarch&#x27;s original function was to command the army; presumably the office was created to take over this function from the king. The title held a high position in Athenian society, alongside the &quot;archon eponymos&quot; and the &quot;archon basileus&quot;. In Athens the polemarch was the commander-in-chief of the armed forces of the city-state. In Modern Greek, polemarchos means warlord.

==Ancient Greece==

===Athens===
In Athens, the &quot;polemarchos&quot; was one of nine annually appointed &quot;archontes&quot; () and functioned as the commander of the military, though to what extent is debated among historians.

At the Battle of Marathon Herodotus described the vote of the &quot;polemarchos&quot;, Callimachus, as the deciding factor during debate over engagement in battle; it is disputed whether this vote implies that the position of &quot;polemarchos&quot; was an equal to a &quot;strategos&quot; or that of a commander-in-chief. The &quot;polemarchos&#x27;&quot; military responsibilities continued until 487 BC, when a new procedure was adopted and magistrates were then appointed by lot. Following this reform, the military duties were handled by the &quot;strategos.&quot; By the mid-5th Century BC, the &quot;polemarchos&quot;&#x27; role was reduced to ceremonial and judicial functions, and primarily presided over preliminary trials involving metics&#x27; family, inheritance, and status cases. After the preliminary stage the cases would either continue under the judgement of the &quot;polemarchos&quot;, or be remitted to tribal or municipal judges. The &quot;polemarchos&quot; also conducted certain religious sacrificial offerings and arranged the funeral ceremonies for men killed in war.

===Sparta===
In the new structure of the Spartan Army, introduced sometime during the Peloponnesian War, a &quot;polemarchos&quot; was the commander of a &quot;mora&quot; of 576 men, one of six in the Spartan army on campaign. On occasion however they were appointed to head armies. The six Spartan &quot;polemarchoi&quot; seem to have been on equal power to kings at expeditions outside Laconia and were usually descendants of the royal houses. They were part of the royal army council and the royal escort () and were supported or represented by officers (σ). The &quot;polemarchoi&quot; were also responsible for public meals, since, by the laws of Lycurgus, the Lacedaemonians would eat and fight in the same group. Next to their military and connected responsibilities, the &quot;polemarchoi&quot; were responsible for some civil and juridical tasks (not unlike the &quot;archōn polemarchos&quot; in Athens).

===Boeotia===
In the early 4th century BC several Boeotian &quot;poleis&quot; instituted the position of &quot;polemarchos&quot;, though there was no unified policy. Of the surviving accounts, Plutarch and Xenophon describe three &quot;polemarchoi&quot; as executive officials of Thebes during this period.

==Other uses==
In modern use, the Greek Letter fraternity Kappa Alpha Psi titles their fraternity leaders as Polemarchs.

==Fictional use==
This position was featured in Orson Scott Card&#x27;s novel &quot;Ender&#x27;s Game&quot;. In the novel, the position of polemarch was charged with the supreme command of humanity&#x27;s space fleets, the International Fleet. The Polemarch, along with the positions of Strategos and Hegemon, was one of the three most powerful people alive.

This title was also given to the DC Comics character Artemis of Bana-Mighdall, an Amazon in the &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; comic books. For a period Artemis served as Paradise Island&#x27;s co-ruler alongside fellow Amazon Philippus. Whereas Philippus oversaw the day-to-day rule of the island, Artemis oversaw its military aspects.

The title was used to signify soldiers who commanded fortifications and other camps in the 2018 Ubisoft video game &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed Odyssey&quot;. They were the strongest regular enemies in the game and killing them would lower the &quot;nation power&quot; of a particular state in Greece substantially. Additionally, in 2 of the game&#x27;s quests, you have to kill 3 polemarchs that are present in either Athenian or Spartan forts across Greece, collect their seals, and bring them to either General Lysander of Sparta or Demosthenes in Athens.

<text>Rosa Albach-Retty (born Rosa Clara Franziska Helene Retty; 26 December 1874 – 26 August 1980) was an Austrian film and stage actress.

==Life==
Born into a well-known family of actors, she was the daughter of actor and director . Trained by her father, she began her stage career in 1890 at the Deutsches Theater and the Lessing Theater in Berlin, where she performed as Franziska on &quot;Minna von Barnhelm&quot;. Hermann Sudermann wrote his play &quot;&quot;, which premiered in 1894 at the Lessing Theater, for her. She was also known for breeches roles in &quot;Little Lord Fauntleroy&quot; and &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot; (1909 at the Burgtheater). In 1895, she went to the Volkstheater in Vienna and in 1903 joined the Burgtheater ensemble, where she received the title of &quot;Hofschauspielerin&quot; (Actress of the Court) in 1912. She became an honorary member of the Burgtheater in 1928 and in 1958 she gave her final performance.

She was married to the Austro-Hungarian Army officer Karl Albach; she was the mother of Wolf Albach-Retty (1906–1967), an Austrian movie actor who married German movie actress Magda Schneider in 1937. She thereby was the grandmother of actress Romy Schneider and great-grandmother of actress Sarah Biasini.

Albach-Retty made her first film appearance in 1930, in Georg Jacoby&#x27;s &quot;Money on the Street&quot;, and made her last appearance in the 1955 remake &quot;The Congress Dances&quot; directed by Franz Antel. She died in 1980 at the age of 105, not long after she had published her autobiography &quot;So kurz sind 100 Jahre&quot; for her hundredth birthday. Her grave of honour and that of her son is located in the Vienna Central Cemetery (group 32 C, number 50).

== Ties to the Nazis ==

The proximity of Rosa Albach-Retty to the NS Regime is well documented. The annexation of Austria to Nazi Germany in 1938 was celebrated by her in the &quot;Kleine Volks-Zeitung&quot;. Rosa Albach-Retty&#x27;s membership in the NSDAP is not proven, but she and her husband were supporting members of the SS. As a celebrity of the public and a self-confessed admirer of Hitler, Rosa Albach-Retty was courted by the Nazi cultural policy and included in the so-called &quot;God-privileged List&quot; of the National Socialists.

None of this did anything to diminish the esteem in which Albach-Retty was held after the end of the Nazi regime, as the awards she received after 1945 prove. Even a Viennese municipal building was named after her: the Rosa-Albach-Retty-Hof in the 19th district, built in the 1970s.

<text>A caricature is a rendered image showing the features of its subject in a simplified or exaggerated way through sketching, pencil strokes, or other artistic drawings (compare to: cartoon). Caricatures can be either insulting or complimentary, and can serve a political purpose, be drawn solely for entertainment, or for a combination of both. Caricatures of politicians are commonly used in newspapers and news magazines as political cartoons, while caricatures of movie stars are often found in entertainment magazines. In literature, a &quot;caricature&quot; is a distorted representation of a person in a way that exaggerates some characteristics and oversimplifies others.

== Etymology ==
The term is derived for the Italian &quot;caricare&quot;—to charge or load. An early definition occurs in the English doctor Thomas Browne&#x27;s &quot;Christian Morals&quot;, published posthumously in 1716.

with the footnote:

Thus, the word &quot;caricature&quot; essentially means a &quot;loaded portrait&quot;. 

In 18th-century usage, &#x27;caricature&#x27; was used for any image that made use of exaggerated or distorted features; thus both for comic portraits of specific people and for general social and political comic illustrations such as the satires of James Gillray, Thomas Rowlandson and many others. The title of the British Caricature Magazine (1807-1819) exemplifies this usage. In modern usage, &#x27;caricature&#x27; is used predominantly for a portrait of a recognizable individual (much as originally used to describe the works of Pier Leone Ghezzi), while the more recent term &#x27;cartoon&#x27;, popularised in the 19th century from its use in Punch magazine, is used for any other form of comic image, including political satire.

== History ==

Some of the earliest caricatures are found in the works of Leonardo da Vinci, who actively sought people with deformities to use as models. The point was to offer an impression of the original which was more striking than a portrait.

Caricature became popular in European aristocratic circles, notably through the works of the Italian Rococo artist Pier Leone Ghezzi. Caricature portraits were passed around for mutual enjoyment. and the fashion spread to Britain from visitors returning from the Grand Tour; the much greater freedom of the press in England allowed its use in biting political satire and furthered its development as an art form in its own right.
While the first book on caricature drawing to be published in England was Mary Darly&#x27;s &quot;A Book of Caricaturas&quot; (), the first known North American caricatures were drawn in 1759 during the battle for Quebec. These caricatures were the work of Brig.-Gen. George Townshend whose caricatures of British General James Wolfe, depicted as &quot;Deformed and crass and hideous&quot; (Snell), were drawn to amuse fellow officers.
In the 18th century, because of England&#x27;s liberal political traditions, relative freedom of speech, and burgeoning publishing industry, London was a hot bed for the development of modern forms of caricature. William Hogarth (1697–1764) elevated satirical art into an accepted art form and a succeeding generation of talented artists including names such as James Gillray (1757–1815), Thomas Rowlandson (1756–1827) and Isaac Cruikshank (1757–1815) advanced it further. Caricature became a valuable tool for political campaigning and both Gillray and Rowlandson established their reputations as caricaturists working as &#x27;hired guns&#x27; in the 1784 Westminster election. Their skills continued to be in high demand; in the turbulent period of the French Revolution and Napoleonic Wars caricature became an increasingly important communication medium. Gillray became the leading political caricaturist of his time, famous across Europe, while Rowlandson&#x27;s vast output used caricature for both political and social caricature and for comic book illustration. 

Published from 1868 to 1914, the London weekly magazine &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; became famous for its caricatures of famous people in society. In a lecture titled &quot;The History and Art of Caricature&quot;, the British caricaturist Ted Harrison said that the caricaturist can choose to either mock or wound the subject with an effective caricature. Drawing caricatures can simply be a form of entertainment and amusement – in which case gentle mockery is in order – or the art can be employed to make a serious social or political point. A caricaturist draws on (1) the natural characteristics of the subject (the big ears, long nose, etc.); (2) the acquired characteristics (stoop, scars, facial lines etc.); and (3) the vanities (choice of hair style, spectacles, clothes, expressions, and mannerisms).
== Notable caricaturists ==

* Sir Max Beerbohm (1872–1956, British), created and published caricatures of famous men of his own time and earlier. His style of single-figure caricatures in formalized groupings was established by 1896 and flourished until about 1930. His published works include &quot;Caricatures of Twenty-five Gentlemen&quot; (1896), &quot;The Poets&#x27; Corner&quot; (1904), and &quot;Rossetti and His Circle&quot; (1922). He published widely in fashionable magazines of the time, and his works were exhibited regularly in London at the Carfax Gallery (1901–18) and Leicester Galleries (1911–57).
* George Cruikshank (1792–1878, British) created political prints that attacked the royal family and leading politicians. He went on to create social caricatures of British life for popular publications such as &quot;The Comic Almanac&quot; (1835–1853) and &quot;Omnibus&quot; (1842). Cruikshanks&#x27; &quot;New Union Club&quot; of 1819 is notable in the context of slavery. He also earned fame as a book illustrator for Charles Dickens and many other authors.
* Honoré Daumier (1808–1879, French) created over 4,000 lithographs, most of them caricatures on political, social, and everyday themes. They were published in the daily French newspapers (&quot;Le Charivari&quot;, &quot;La Caricature&quot; etc.)
* Mort Drucker (1929-2020, American) joined &quot;Mad&quot; in 1957 and became well known for his parodies of movie satires. He combined a comic strip style with caricature likenesses of film actors for &quot;Mad&quot;, and he also contributed covers to &quot;Time&quot;. He has been recognized for his work with the National Cartoonists Society Special Features Award for 1985, 1986, 1987, and 1988, and their Reuben Award for 1987.
* Alex Gard (1900–1948, Russian) created more than 700 caricatures of show business celebrities and other notables for the walls of Sardi&#x27;s Restaurant in the theater district of New York City: the first artist to do so. Today the images are part of the Billy Rose Theater Collection of The New York Public Library for the Performing Arts.
* Pier Leone Ghezzi (1674–1755, Italian) A Rococo artist and theater designer, Ghezzi is widely considered to be the father of modern caricature. He popularized &quot;caricatura&quot; as an art form in 18th century Italy, inspiring its adoption in Britain and elsewhere in Europe.
* Al Hirschfeld (1903–2003, American) was best known for his simple black and white renditions of celebrities and Broadway stars which used flowing contour lines over heavy rendering. He was commissioned by the United States Postal Service to provide art for U.S. stamps. Permanent collections of Hirschfeld&#x27;s work appear at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Museum of Modern Art in New York, and he boasts a star on the St. Louis Walk of Fame.
* Sebastian Krüger (1963, German) is known for his grotesque, yet hyperrealistic distortions of the facial features of celebrities, which he renders primarily in acrylic paint, and for which he has won praise from &quot;The Times&quot;. He is well known for his lifelike depictions of The Rolling Stones, in particular, Keith Richards. Krüger has published three collections of his works, and has a yearly art calendar from Morpheus International. Krüger&#x27;s art can be seen frequently in &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine and has also been featured in &quot;Stern&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;Espresso&quot;, &quot;Penthouse&quot;, and &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; and &quot;USA Today&quot;. 
* David Levine (1926–2009, American) is noted for his caricatures in &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot; and &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine. His first cartoons appeared in 1963. Since then, he has drawn hundreds of pen-and-ink caricatures of famous writers and politicians for the newspaper.
* Marie Marcks (1922– 2014, German) A well-known artist since the post-war years in the Federal Republic of Germany, she is considered one of the most important caricaturists and the &quot;Grande Dame&quot; of political caricature in Germany.
* Carlo Pellegrini Working under the pseudonym &#x27;Ape&#x27;, Pellegrini was one of the leading caricaturists for Vanity Fair (1868-1914), a British magazine famous for its weekly full-page caricature portraits of leading celebrities of the day, including politicians, athletes, writers and other notables.
* Sam Viviano (1953, American) has done a lot of work for corporations and in advertising, having contributed to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;Family Weekly&quot;, &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;, &quot;Consumer Reports&quot;, and &quot;Mad&quot;, of which he is currently the art director. Viviano&#x27;s caricatures are known for their broad jaws, which Viviano has explained is a result of his incorporation of side views as well as front views into his distortions of the human face. He has also developed a reputation for his ability to make crowd scenes.

== Computerization ==

There have been some efforts to produce caricatures automatically or semi-automatically using computer graphics techniques. For example, a system proposed by Akleman et al. provides warping tools specifically designed toward rapidly producing caricatures. There are very few software programs designed specifically for automatically creating caricatures.

Computer graphic system requires quite different skill sets to design a caricature as compared to the caricatures created on paper. Thus, using a computer in the digital production of caricatures requires advanced knowledge of the program&#x27;s functionality. Rather than being a simpler method of caricature creation, it can be a more complex method of creating images that feature finer coloring textures than can be created using more traditional methods.

A milestone in formally defining caricature was Susan Brennan&#x27;s master&#x27;s thesis in 1982. In her system, caricature was formalized as the process of exaggerating differences from an average face. For example, if Charles III has more prominent ears than the average person, in his caricature the ears will be much larger than normal. Brennan&#x27;s system implemented this idea in a partially automated fashion as follows: the operator was required to input a frontal drawing of the desired person having a standardized topology (the number and ordering of lines for every face). She obtained a corresponding drawing of an average male face. Then, the particular face was caricatured simply by subtracting from the particular face the corresponding point on the mean face (the origin being placed in the middle of the face), scaling this difference by a factor larger than one, and adding the scaled difference back onto the mean face.

Though Brennan&#x27;s formalization was introduced in the 1980s, it remains relevant in recent work. Mo et al. refined the idea by noting that the population variance of the feature should be taken into account. For example, the distance between the eyes varies less than other features, such as the size of the nose. Thus even a small variation in the eye spacing is unusual and should be exaggerated, whereas a correspondingly small change in the nose size relative to the mean would not be unusual enough to be worthy of exaggeration.

On the other hand, Liang et al. argue that caricature varies depending on the artist and cannot be captured in a single definition. Their system uses machine learning techniques to automatically learn and mimic the style of a particular caricature artist, given training data in the form of a number of face photographs and the corresponding caricatures by that artist. The results produced by computer graphic systems are arguably not yet of the same quality as those produced by human artists. For example, most systems are restricted to exactly frontal poses, whereas many or even most manually produced caricatures (and face portraits in general) choose an off-center &quot;three-quarters&quot; view. Brennan&#x27;s caricature drawings were frontal-pose line drawings. More recent systems can produce caricatures in a variety of styles, including direct geometric distortion of photographs.

=== Recognition advantage ===
Brennan&#x27;s caricature generator was used to test recognition of caricatures. Rhodes, Brennan and Carey demonstrated that caricatures were recognised more accurately than the original images. They used line drawn images but Benson and Perrett showed similar effects with photographic quality images. Explanations for this advantage have been based on both norm-based theories of face recognition and exemplar-based theories of face recognition.

== Modern use ==
Beside the political and public-figure satire, most contemporary caricatures are used as gifts or souvenirs, often drawn by street vendors. For a small fee, a caricature can be drawn specifically (and quickly) for a patron. These are popular at street fairs, carnivals, and even weddings, often with humorous results.

Caricature artists are also popular attractions at many places frequented by tourists, especially oceanfront boardwalks, where vacationers can have a humorous caricature sketched in a few minutes for a small fee. Caricature artists can sometimes be hired for parties, where they will draw caricatures of the guests for their entertainment.

===Museums===
There are numerous museums dedicated to caricature throughout the world, including the &quot;Museo de la Caricatura&quot; of Mexico City, the &quot;Muzeum Karykatury&quot; in Warsaw, the Caricatura Museum Frankfurt, the Wilhelm Busch Museum in Hanover and the &quot;Cartoonmuseum&quot; in Basel. The first museum of caricature in the Arab world was opened in March, 2009, at Fayoum, Egypt.

<doc id="206687" wikidata="Q11878" url="?curid=206687" title="Brett J. Gladman">
<text>Brett James Gladman (born April 19, 1966) is a Canadian astronomer and a full professor at the University of British Columbia&#x27;s Department of Physics and Astronomy in Vancouver, British Columbia. He holds the Canada Research Chair in planetary astronomy. He does both theoretical work (large-scale numerical simulations of planetary dynamics) and observational optical astronomy (being a discoverer of many planetary moons and minor planets).

== Career ==

Gladman is best known for his work in dynamical astronomy in the Solar System. He has studied the transport of meteorites between planets, the delivery of meteoroids from the main asteroid belt, and the possibility of the transport of life via this mechanism, known as panspermia. He also studies planet formation, especially the puzzle of how the giant planets came to be.

He is discoverer or co-discoverer of many astronomical bodies in the Solar System, asteroids, Kuiper Belt comets, and many moons of the giant planets:
* Uranus: Caliban, Sycorax, Prospero, Setebos, Stephano, and Ferdinand
* Saturn: A dozen satellites in several groups, each named after a theme of Canadian Inuit gods, French deities, and Norse gods
* Neptune: The satellite Neso
* Jupiter: Discovery and co-discovery of 6 moons

Gladman is a member of the Canada–France Ecliptic Plane Survey (CFEPS), and the Outer Solar System Origins Survey (OSSOS) which has detected and tracked the world&#x27;s largest sample of well-understood Kuiper belt comets, including unusual objects like (&quot;Buffy&quot;) and (&quot;Drac&quot;), the first trans-Neptunian object on a retrograde orbit around the Sun.

== Honors and awards ==

Gladman was awarded the H. C. Urey Prize by the Division of Planetary Sciences of the American Astronomical Society in 2002. The main-belt asteroid 7638 Gladman is named in his honor. During 2008–2011 he served as member and chair of the Science Advisory Council of the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope on Mauna Kea in Hawaii. He was awarded a Killam Research Fellowship in 2015.

<doc id="206691" wikidata="Q189473" url="?curid=206691" title="Zend Engine">
<text>The Zend Engine is a compiler and runtime environment for the PHP scripting language and consists of the Zend Virtual Machine, which is composed of the Zend Compiler and the Zend Executor, that compiles and executes the PHP code. It was originally developed by Andi Gutmans and Zeev Suraski while they were students at the Technion – Israel Institute of Technology. They later founded a company called Zend Technologies in Ramat Gan, Israel. The name Zend is a combination of their forenames, Zeev and Andi.

The first version of the Zend Engine appeared in 1999 in PHP version 4. It was written in C as a highly optimized modular back-end, which for the first time could be used in applications outside of PHP. The Zend Engine provides memory and resource management, and other standard services for the PHP language. Its performance, reliability and extensibility played a significant role in PHP&#x27;s increasing popularity.

This was followed by &quot;Zend Engine 2&quot; at the heart of PHP 5.

This was followed by &quot;Zend Engine 3&quot;, originally codenamed &quot;phpng&quot;, which was developed for PHP 7 and significantly improves performance.

The newest version is &quot;Zend Engine 4&quot;, which was developed for PHP 8.

The source code for the Zend Engine has been freely available under the Zend Engine License (although some parts are under the PHP License) since 1999, as part of the official releases from php.net, as well as the official git repository or the GitHub mirror. Various volunteers contribute to the PHP/Zend Engine codebase.

== Architecture ==
Zend Engine is used internally by PHP as a compiler and runtime engine. 
PHP Scripts are loaded into memory and compiled into Zend opcodes. 
These opcodes are executed and the HTML generated is sent to the client.

To implement a Web script interpreter requires three parts:
# The interpreter part analyzes the input code, translates it, and executes it.
# The functionality part implements the functionality of the language (its functions, etc.).
# The interface part talks to the Web server, etc.
Zend takes part 1 completely and a bit of part 2; PHP takes parts 2 and 3.

Zend itself really forms only the language core, implementing PHP at its very basics with some predefined functions.

<doc id="206693" wikidata="Q492111" url="?curid=206693" title="Patrick Caulfield">
<text>Patrick Joseph Caulfield, (29 January 1936 – 29 September 2005), was an English painter and printmaker known for his bold canvases, which often incorporated elements of photorealism within a pared-down scene. Examples of his work are &quot;Pottery&quot; and &quot;Still Life Ingredients&quot;.

==Early life==

Patrick Joseph Caulfield was born on the 29th of January, 1936 at 17 All Saints Road, Acton, west London. During the second world war Caulfield&#x27;s family returned to Bolton in 1945, where his parents were born, to work at the De Havilland factory. Leaving Acton Secondary Modern at the age of 15, Caulfield secured a position as a filing clerk at Crosse &amp; Blackwell and later transferred to the design studio, working on food display and carrying out menial tasks. At 17, he joined the Royal Air Force at RAF Northwood, pre-empting requirement for national service. Inspired by the 1952 film &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; about the artist Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, he spent his free time attending evening classes at Harrow School of Art (now part of the University of Westminster).

==Studies and work==
Patrick Caulfield studied at Chelsea School of Art from 1956 to 1960, and during this time he won two prizes which funded a trip he made to Greece and Crete upon graduation. The visit to the island proved important, with Caulfield finding inspiration in the Minoan frescoes and the bright, hard colours on Crete. One of his greatest friends was the abstract painter John Hoyland, whom he first met at the Young Contemporaries exhibition in 1959. Progressing to the Royal College of Art from 1960 to 1963, his contemporaries included David Hockney and Allen Jones. He taught at Chelsea School of Art from 1963 to 1971. In 1964, he exhibited at the &quot;New Generation&quot; show at London&#x27;s Whitechapel Gallery, which resulted in him being associated with the pop art movement. This was a label Caulfield was opposed to throughout his career, seeing himself rather as &quot;a &#x27;formal&#x27; artist&quot;. He first exhibited with Leslie Waddington in 1969 and was represented by him for over thirty years, until Caulfield&#x27;s death in 2005.

From the mid-1970s he incorporated more detailed, realistic elements into his work; &quot;After Lunch&quot; (1975) is an early example. &quot;Still-life: Autumn Fashion&quot; (1978) contains a variety of styles – some objects have heavy black outlines and flat colour, but a bowl of oysters is depicted more realistically and other areas are executed with looser brushwork. Caulfield later returned to his earlier, more stripped-down style of painting.

Caulfield&#x27;s paintings are figurative, often portraying a few simple objects in an interior. Typically, he used flat areas of simple colour surrounded by black outlines. Some of his works are dominated by a single hue.

In 1987, Caulfield was nominated for the Turner Prize for his show &quot;The Artist&#x27;s Eye&quot; at the National Gallery in London. In 1996 he was made a CBE.

On 24 May 2004, a fire in a storage warehouse destroyed many works from the Saatchi collection, including three by Caulfield. In September 2010 Caulfield and five other British artists, Howard Hodgkin, John Walker, Ian Stephenson, John Hoyland, and R.B. Kitaj were included in an exhibition entitled &quot;The Independent Eye: Contemporary British Art From the Collection of Samuel and Gabrielle Lurie,&quot; at the Yale Center for British Art.

He died in London in 2005 and is buried in Highgate Cemetery. His work is held in the private collections of Charles Saatchi and David Bowie and the road on which he was born was renamed Caulfield Road after his death when the area was redeveloped.
==Commissions==
Later in his career, Caulfield worked on several commissions in addition to his painting and printmaking. In 1990 he designed a stained glass window for The Ivy restaurant, it is visible from within the restaurant and on its exterior. In 1992 he designed a 12-metre carpet for the British Council&#x27;s Manchester headquarters and in 1984 and 1995 set designs for &quot;Party Game&quot; and &quot;Rhapsody&quot; (respectively) at the Royal Opera House. Caulfield painted the doors of the Great West Organ at Portsmouth Cathedral in 2001.

<text>Joe Frazier vs. Muhammad Ali, billed as The Fight of the Century or simply The Fight, was an undisputed heavyweight championship boxing match between WBA, WBC, and &quot;The Ring&quot; heavyweight champion Joe Frazier and Lineal champion Muhammad Ali, on Monday, March 8, 1971, at Madison Square Garden in New York City.

The fight is widely regarded as the biggest boxing match in history and arguably the single most anticipated and publicized sporting event ever. An international audience observed the spectacle. It was the first time that two undefeated boxers who held or had held the &quot;world heavyweight&quot; title fought each other for that very title.

The bout held broad appeal for many Americans, including non-boxing and non-sport fans. Ali, who had been stripped of his titles by boxing authorities for refusing to submit to the draft for the Vietnam War, had become a symbol of the anti-establishment public during his government-imposed exile from the ring. In contrast, Frazier supported U.S. involvement in the war, and he had been adopted by elements of the public with alternate views. In addition, both men possessed intense personal animosity towards each other.

Frazier won in fifteen rounds by unanimous decision. Ali dealt with his first professional loss. It became the first of a trio of fights, followed by the rematch events Super Fight II (1974) and the Thrilla in Manila (1975). Both of those fights were won by Ali.

==Background and cultural significance==
In 1971, both Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier were undefeated champions (in Ali&#x27;s case, actually, former champion) who held legitimate claims to the title of &quot;World Heavyweight Champion&quot;. Ali had won the title from Sonny Liston in Miami Beach in 1964, and successfully defended his belt up until he had it stripped by boxing authorities for refusing induction into the armed forces in 1967 (though he was still recognized as the Lineal heavyweight champion). In Ali&#x27;s absence, Frazier won two championship belts, knocking out Buster Mathis for recognition as champion in five states (most notably, New York) and Jimmy Ellis, who had won the World Boxing Association&#x27;s world title by winning a WBA elimination tournament, to replace Ali as the acknowledged, unified world champion. Frazier was plausibly Ali&#x27;s equal, which created a tremendous amount of hype and anticipation for a match pitting the two undefeated fighters against one another to decide who was the true heavyweight champ.

Ringside seats were $150 () and each man was guaranteed $2.5 million. In addition to the millions who watched on closed-circuit broadcast screens around the world, Madison Square Garden was packed with a sell-out crowd of 20,455 that provided a gate of $1.5 million ().

Prior to his enforced layoff, Ali had displayed uncommon speed and agility for a man of his size. He had dominated most of his opponents to the point that he had often predicted the round in which he would knock his opponent out. In October 1970, he stopped Jerry Quarry via cuts after three rounds in his first match after a three-and-a-half-year layoff. However, in his next fight, the last preceding the Frazier fight, Ali struggled at times during his 15th-round TKO of Oscar Bonavena, an unorthodox Argentinian fighter who was prepared by Hall of Fame trainer Gil Clancy. On the March 4, 1971, episode of &quot;The Dick Cavett Show&quot;, Howard Cosell, Joe Louis and Jimmy Breslin all correctly predicted that because of Ali&#x27;s lengthy layoff, Frazier would prevail.

Frazier had an outstanding left hook and was a tenacious competitor who attacked the body of his opponent ferociously. Despite suffering from a serious bout of hypertension in the lead-up to the fight, he appeared to be in top form as the face-off between the two undefeated champions approached.

Prior to the fight, Mark Kram wrote in &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;:

The thrust of this fight on the public consciousness is incalculable. It has been a ceaseless whir that seems to have grown in decibel with each new soliloquy by Ali, with each dead calm promise by Frazier. It has magnetized the imagination of ring theorists, and flushed out polemicists of every persuasion. It has cut deep into the thicket of our national attitudes, and it is a conversational imperative everywhere—from the gabble of big-city salons and factory lunch breaks rife with unreasoning labels, to ghetto saloons with their own false labels.

As Gil Clancy, who was in Frazier&#x27;s corner that night, would later comment:

The electricity in the air then was just unbelievable. If they would have dropped the bomb on Madison Square Garden that night, the country wouldn&#x27;t have been able to run.

==Fight==
On the evening of the match, Madison Square Garden had a circus-like atmosphere, with scores of policemen to control the crowd of outrageously dressed fans, kids, and countless celebrities, from Norman Mailer to Woody Allen. Unable to procure a ringside seat, Frank Sinatra took photographs for &quot;Life&quot; magazine instead. Nelson Mandela, who was in prison in South Africa during the event, spoke about how excited everybody was about this fight. Artist LeRoy Neiman painted Ali and Frazier as they fought. Burt Lancaster served as a color commentator for the closed-circuit broadcast. Though Lancaster had never performed as a sports commentator before, he was hired by the fight&#x27;s promoter, Jerry Perenchio, who was also a friend. Perenchio enlisted sports owner Jack Kent Cooke as financial backer of the fight with a bank guarantee of $4,000,000 which provided the bulk of the fighters&#x27; $5,000,000 fee. The other commentators were famed boxing play-by-play announcer Don Dunphy and former light-heavyweight boxing champion and heavyweight competitor Archie Moore. The fight was sold, and broadcast by closed circuit, to 50 countries in 12 languages via ringside reporters to an audience estimated at 300 million, a record viewership for a television event at that time. Riots broke out at several venues as unresolvable technical issues interrupted the broadcast in several cities in the third round. And, although no live radio coverage of the fight itself was allowed under the terms of the promotion, the Mutual Radio Network did broadcast the fight the night of March 8, with announcers Van Patrick and Charles King, together with many other sports commentators, providing round-by-round summaries live as they came out over the UPI and AP wire services.

The referee for the fight was Arthur Mercante, Sr.. After the fight, Mercante, a veteran referee of hundreds of fights, said: &quot;They both threw some of the best punches I&#x27;ve ever seen.&quot;

The fight itself exceeded many fans’ expectations and went the full 15-round championship distance. Ali dominated the first five rounds, peppering the shorter Frazier with rapier-like jabs that raised welts on the champion&#x27;s face.

Ali was visibly tired after the sixth round, and though he put together some flurries of punches after that round, he was unable to keep the pace he had set in the first third of the fight. At 1 minute and 59 seconds into round eight, following his clean left hook to Ali&#x27;s right jaw, Frazier grabbed Ali&#x27;s wrists and swung Ali into the center of the ring; however, Ali immediately grabbed Frazier again until they were once again separated by Mercante.

At 2:10 of the eleventh round, Frazier staggered Ali with a left hook, Ali&#x27;s knees buckling—only bouncing off the ropes keeping Ali from again hitting the canvas. For the remainder of the round, Ali stumbled around the ring backing again and again into the ropes and grabbing at Frazier as Frazier continued battering him until the fighters were separated by Mercante at 2:55 into the round.

Heading into round 15, all three judges had Frazier in the lead (7–6–1, 10–4, and 8–6), and Frazier closed convincingly. Early in the round, Frazier landed a left hook that put Ali on the canvas. Ali, his jaw swollen noticeably, got up at the count of four and managed to stay on his feet for the rest of the round despite several terrific blows from Frazier. A few minutes later, the judges made it official: Frazier had retained the title with a unanimous decision, dealing Ali his first professional loss.

===Scorecard===
==Viewership and revenue==
The fight was broadcast live pay-per-view on theatre television in the United States, where it set a record with 2.5million tickets sold at closed-circuit venues, grossing . It was also shown closed-circuit during the middle of the night in London theatres, where it set a record with 90,000 tickets, grossing $750,000. Combined, the fight sold 2.59million tickets in the United States and London, grossing (inflation-adjusted ).

On both closed-circuit and free television, the fight was watched by a record 300million viewers worldwide. It was watched by a record 27.5million viewers on BBC1 in the United Kingdom, about half of the British population. It was also watched by an estimated 5.4million viewers in Italy, and 2million viewers in South Korea.

==Aftermath==
Ali refused to publicly admit defeat and sought to define the outcome in the public&#x27;s mind as a &quot;White Man&#x27;s Decision&quot;. Frazier lost the title 22 months later, when he was knocked down six times in the first two rounds by George Foreman in their brief but devastating January 22, 1973, title bout in Kingston, Jamaica.

Ali split two bouts with Ken Norton in 1973 and was viewed by many as on a downward slide before a win in a rematch—Ali–Frazier II—in January 1974. That October, Ali shocked the world with a victory in Kinshasa, Zaire, over the heavily favored Foreman to regain the heavyweight title in &quot;The Rumble in the Jungle&quot;.

Ali later went on to defeat Frazier in their third and final bout, The Thrilla in Manila, in 1975. By the time of the rematches the social climate in America had settled down, with the Vietnam War having ended in early 1973. Many dismissed the notion that Ali was a traitor, and he was once again accepted as the heavyweight champion. People who had supported Frazier on political and racial grounds in the first bout so that they could see Ali get beat were less effusive and abandoned him after he lost his championship. Without the same social divide, with the unknown of whether Ali could ever regain enough of his former greatness to dominate post-layoff partially answered, and without the impetus of two unbeaten champions meeting one another for the first time, neither their second nor their third matchup would attain the unprecedented hype of the first.

== COINTELPRO ==
The fight provided cover for an activist group, the Citizens&#x27; Commission to Investigate the FBI, to successfully pull off a burglary at an FBI office in Pennsylvania, which exposed the COINTELPRO operations that included illegal spying on activists involved with the civil rights and anti-war movements, on the basis that guards listening to radio coverage of the fight would be distracted from their duties. One of the COINTELPRO targets was Muhammad Ali, and the FBI&#x27;s goals included their gaining access to his records as far back as elementary school.

<doc id="206696" wikidata="Q5702008" url="?curid=206696" title="Helen Chadwick">
<text>Helen Chadwick (18 May 1953 – 15 March 1996) was a British sculptor, photographer and installation artist. In 1987, she became one of the first women artists to be nominated for the Turner Prize. Chadwick was known for &quot;challenging stereotypical perceptions of the body in elegant yet unconventional forms. Her work draws from a range of sources, from myths to science, grappling with a plethora of unconventional, visceral materials that included chocolate, lambs&#x27; tongues and rotting vegetable matter. Her skilled use of traditional fabrication methods and sophisticated technologies transform these unusual materials into complex installations&quot;. Maureen Paley noted that &quot;Helen was always talking about craftsmanship—a constant fount of information&quot;. Binary opposition was a strong theme in Chadwick&#x27;s work; seductive/repulsive, male/female, organic/man-made. Her combinations &quot;emphasise yet simultaneously dissolve the contrasts between them&quot;. Her gender representations forge a sense of ambiguity and a disquieting sexuality blurring the boundaries of ourselves as singular and stable beings.&quot;

==Early life and education==
Helen Chadwick was born on 18 May 1953 in Croydon, England. Her mother was a Greek refugee and her father from east London. Her parents met during the Second World War in Athens, Greece, and moved to live in Croydon in 1946. After Chadwick left Croydon High School, she embarked on a Fine Art Foundation course at Croydon College, then went on to study at Brighton Polytechnic (1973–76). She recalled, &quot;Traditional media were never dynamic enough… right from early on in art school, I wanted to use the body to create a set of inter-relationships with the audience&quot;. Her degree show &quot;Domestic Sanitation&quot; (1976) consisted of her and three other women, &#x27;wearing&#x27; latex costumes painted directly on to the skin, engaging in a satirical feminist round of cleaning and grooming. In 1976, Chadwick moved to Hackney and enrolled in a Masters course at Chelsea College of Art (1976–77). In 1977, she and two dozen other artists moved into Beck Road, Hackney, a double strip of Victorian terraces that was earmarked for demolition. After squatting for two years they persuaded the Inner London Education Authority to rent out, rather than demolish, the houses. Beck Road became a hive of home studios whose residents included Maureen Paley, Ray Walker and Genesis P-Orridge.

==Career==
Chadwick began exhibiting regularly from 1977, gradually building her reputation as an artist. Her rise into the public sphere was marked by the inclusion of her work &quot;Ego Geometria Sum&quot; (1983) in a group exhibition entitled &quot;Summer Show I&quot; (1983) at the Serpentine. In 1985 she began an active teaching career as a visiting lecturer across a number of London art schools. Her posts at Goldsmiths (1985–90), Chelsea College of Arts, London (1985–95), Central Saint Martins, London (1987–95) and the Royal College of Art (1990–94) ensured an important influence on contemporary British Art in the late 1980s and &#x27;90s, specifically on the Young British Artists.

Chadwick&#x27;s work really came to prominence with &quot;Of Mutability&quot; (1984-86), a large installation involving sculpture and photography at the Institute of Contemporary Arts, London. This exhibition that toured a number of venues in England, Scotland and Switzerland resulted in her nomination for the Turner Prize in 1987. This was the first year that women were nominated for Britain&#x27;s most prestigious contemporary art award.

In 1990 Chadwick was invited to exhibit in a photography festival in Houston, Texas, where she met a local artist, David Notarius. The following year he moved to Beck Road and they married.

In the summer of 1994, Chadwick&#x27;s exhibition &quot;Effluvia&quot; opened at the Serpentine, London. This exhibition marked the high point of Chadwick&#x27;s exposure, receiving widespread critical attention and national press coverage. The exhibition was seen by 54,000 visitors, breaking the record for the gallery. In 1995, Chadwick received her first solo exhibition in the United States at the Museum of Modern Art, New York, entitled &quot;Helen Chadwick: Bad Blooms.&quot; In 1995, Chadwick took up an artist residency in the assisted conception unit at King&#x27;s College Hospital, London, photographing IVF embryos rejected for implantation. She used the photos in Unnatural Selection, a series on which she was working when she died. Chadwick&#x27;s work is included in the collections at the Victoria and Albert Museum, The Tate and the Museum of Modern Art.

==Gender representation==
Chadwick&#x27;s earlier work utilised her naked form, questioning the representation of the female body and addressing what Chadwick called &quot;the issue of the female body as a site of desire&quot;. She attempted to complicate the conventional passive objectification of women. &quot;I was looking at a vocabulary for desire where I was the subject and the object and the author&quot; she said; &quot;I felt by directly taking all these roles, the normal situation in which the viewer operated as a kind of voyeur broke down&quot;. Her BA graduate performance &quot;Domestic Sanitation&quot; (1976) attempted to highlight the distinction between nudity and nakedness. Her performers wore another latex skin to cover their skin suggesting the imposition of idealised femininity while they carried out stereotypical female activities.

Many critics, including former feminist colleagues, concluded that she reinforced the stereotypes she sought to subvert. As was the case for other women artists that were reclaiming their bodies through their art practice, she was accused of regressive female narcissism. Chadwick declared that &quot;I&#x27;m disappointed that a false rationalism is used as a stick with which to measure what I&#x27;m doing when I am looking to cross the taboos that have been instigated. I hate being hauled up as an example of negative women&#x27;s work.&quot; In 1988 Chadwick made a conscious decision &quot;...not to represent my body... It immediately declares female gender and I wanted to be more deft.&quot; Her practice then moved inside the body to flesh in her &quot;Meat Abstracts&quot; (1989) and &quot;Meat Lamps&quot; (1989-91) and to bodily excrement&#x27;s in &quot;Piss Flowers&quot; (1991–92). Chadwick commented, &quot;I felt compelled to use materials that were still bodily, that were still a kind of self-portrait, but did not rely on representation of my own body&quot;

Through her career Chadwick&#x27;s concerns with gender representation moved from the objectification of women to more closely examine what gender is. Working in a time surrounded by debates around the cultural construction of gender, her work was fuelled by writings of Julia Kristeva and Michel Foucault. She would often cite Herculine Barbin, a nineteenth century hermaphrodite, whose memoirs were discovered and printed by Foucault in 1980. Chadwick commented, &quot;Why do we feel compelled to read gender, and automatically wish to sex the body before us so we can orientate our desire and thus gain pleasure or reject what we see?&quot; Chadwick&#x27;s &quot;Piss Flowers&quot; (1991–92) questions the singularity and specificity of gender through an inversion of gender roles. Chadwick elaborated her interest in deconstructing gender binaries in a lecture she gave in 1991: &quot;in language dual structures are defined as oppositional: where we have self, there must be other; gender is male or female, and most problematic and absurd of all is the split between mind and body&quot;

==Works==

===&quot;Ego Geometria Sum&quot; (1983)===

&quot;Ego Geometria Sum&quot; is an attempt to trace one&#x27;s body back &quot;through a succession of geometric solids&quot;. The work comprises ten plywood sculptures that reflect the mass of the artist&#x27;s body at a succession of ages from premature birth to maturity at 30. Each sculpture takes the form of an object that symbolises that age, for example an incubator or a pram. The artist in her notebooks described the forms as &quot;objects that a) contained me b) (re)oriented me c) moulded / shaped me&quot;. The work is printed with pictures of the object, places that relate to it and Chadwick&#x27;s naked form, that conforms to the sculptures shape. While this is certainly an autobiographical work, Chadwick makes a purpose of not showing her face to emphasise a universal quality. The overlapping and juxtaposition of images speaks to the connectedness of the self and the world. The artist&#x27;s notes at this time suggest that the work was an attempt to &quot;go back in memory to the origin of symptoms&quot; of a sense of alienation that she felt. She attempts to free the ego from the traumas of the past.

The accompanying photographs in this installation entitled &quot;The Labours I-X&quot;, show the naked artist bracing as she lifts each of the sculptures. The title refers to the mythical labours of Hercules that he is sentenced to after he kills his own children in a fit of rage. Chadwick&#x27;s use of it suggests that attempting to encapsulate personal history is a Herculean task, requiring great strength and courage.

===&quot;Loop My Loop&quot; (1991)===
&quot;Loop My Loop&quot; is a back-lit cibachrome photograph of blond hair intertwined with a pig&#x27;s intestines. The golden locks signify purity and love knotted with the intestines, which signifies the raw animalistic side to human nature. This work has links with the ideas of Georges Bataille, a French intellectual and literary figure who worked in fields such as anthropology, sociology, and history of art. Chadwick&#x27;s &quot;Loop My Loop&quot; is similar to her work from 1990, titled &quot;Nostalgie de la Boue&quot;. In this work, two rounded cibachrome transparencies were hung one above the other. The top one contained a ring of earthworms, while the bottom pictured someone&#x27;s scalp with the center imploding. Both images appear similar, but by placing the worms above the human scalp the distinction upholding the human above the animal is no longer held.

===&quot;Piss Flowers&quot; (1991–1992)===
&quot;Piss Flowers&quot; is a work made up of twelve sculptures that Chadwick made while on a residency at the Banff Centre for the Arts in Alberta, Canada, in February 1991. During their stay, she and her partner, David Notarius travelled to different locations, made mounds of snow and laid out a flower shaped metal cutter. They would take turns to urinate in the snow then pour plaster into the cavities. These casts were attached to pedestals that were based on a hyacinth bulb. The whole thing was then cast in bronze and enamelled white. 

The works are a result of her physical contact with the location, preserving a direct impact of reality. Chadwick describes the flowers as a &quot;metaphysical conceit for the union of two people expressing themselves bodily&quot;. The work utilises the pleasure of taboo; elevating the medium of urine that is generally regarded as polluting and marginal in a dynamic and playful way. &quot;It may have been mischievous to piss in the snow, but it was damn hard work to end up with the 12 bronzes&quot;, Chadwick recalled. &quot;Piss Flowers took two years, largely because I had to find £12,000 to make them&quot;. The artist &quot;sold herself&quot; to make a programme about Frida Kahlo for the BBC in order to fund the work.

The use of a flower as the form was significant for Chadwick because they are the bisexual reproductive organs of plants containing both male and female sex organs. The woman&#x27;s urine flow is strong and hot, resulting in a central penile form; the man&#x27;s is diffuse and cooler, and creates the labial circumference. In a poem entitled &quot;Piss Posy (&quot;1991) Chadwick describes the works as &quot;Vaginal towers with male skirt/ Gender bending water sport?&quot;. Chadwick plays on sexual difference, reversing gender roles and provoking uncertainty of the singularity and specificity of gender. &quot;Piss Flowers&quot; &quot;synthesise sexual difference through the erotic play both of their making and their forms&quot;.

==Exhibitions==

===&quot;Of Mutability&quot; (1986)===
&quot;Of Mutability&quot; was Chadwick&#x27;s first major solo exhibition, held at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in 1986. Chadwick utilised the ceremonial character of the elegant neo-classical rooms of the upper galleries to house an installation made up of a number of autonomous artworks. One room was at the centre of the exhibition and took the name of &quot;The Oval Court&quot; (1984–86), an ovoid platform that lay in the middle of the space. The platform presents a twelve-part collage of layered blue toned A4 photocopies made directly of the artist&#x27;s naked form, dead animals, plants and drapery suspended in an ovoid pool. The work speaks to the still life, evoking vanitas tradition in its subtle depictions of the transience of the things we surround ourselves with. Twelve figures, according to the artist&#x27;s notes, represent the &quot;12 gates to paradise&quot;, where she achieves &quot;oneness with all living things&quot;. Five golden spheres rest atop the platform corresponding to the finger placing&#x27;s of a huge hand, alluding to the touch of divine. On the walls of this room were photographs of the artist weeping, a Venetian glass mirror and printouts of computer-rendered drawings of the Baroque columns from the baldacchino of St Peter&#x27;s in Rome. Chadwick&#x27;s use of her own body invokes a human attachment to the world, suggesting that the concept of self is infinitely subject to change.

The second room housed &quot;Carcass&quot; (1986), a two-metre-high glass tower of rotting vegetable matter that moves and lives. It begins to compost, generating new organisms over time, Chadwick had to top it up daily to maintain its levels. During the exhibition a small leak appeared in the tower and in a state of panic the ICA staff laid the column, splitting a seam. When they attempted to lay it on its side, ten gallons of fermented liquid sloshed and blew off the end of the tower. Newspapers broadcast this accident, bringing attention to Chadwick as an exciting nonconforming artist.

===&quot;Effluvia&quot; (1994)===

&quot;Effluvia&quot; responded to the parkland setting of the Serpentine; the installation was created in the form of a garden, surrounding themes of tamed and untamed nature with such works as &quot;Piss Flowers&quot; (1991–92) and a fountain of molten chocolate entitled &quot;Cacao&quot; (1994). The exhibition also contained a number of Chadwick&#x27;s other important works including &quot;Viral Landscapes&quot;, a series of works where the artist combined images of cell groups with visually appropriate parts of the Pembrokeshire coastline in Wales. These works explore the relation between host and virus as a metaphor for that between the individual and the world. In the next room Chadwick exhibited a selection of her &quot;Meat Lamps&quot; (1989–91), large-format Polaroid images of meat slabs, bulbs, drapery and other visceral materials that were displayed on light boxes, often with an aura of light spilling around them. Chadwick set out to deconstruct binary opposition by reducing the work to present flesh as flesh. The exhibition also included new works &quot;Glossolalia&quot; (1993) and &quot;I Thee Wed&quot; (1993) that consisted of lamb tongues cast in bronze, fox pelts, and vegetables encircled in rings of fur.

Along with &quot;Piss Flowers&quot; (see Piss Flowers section), &quot;Cacao&quot; attracted the most attention. The work is a fountain of liquid chocolate whose smell permeates the gallery, the form evokes both phallus and flower. Associations with earth, shit and &quot;base matter&quot; are disturbing and simultaneously liberating, speaking to the pleasures of excess and the subject as a desiring self. When asked the reason for making this work Chadwick explained &quot;my libido demanded it&quot;, describing it as &quot;a pool or primal matter, sexually indeterminate, in a perpetual state of flux&quot;. On the walls that surrounded &quot;Cacao&quot; were Chadwick&#x27;s &quot;Wreaths of Pleasure&quot; (1992–93), a series of circular luminous photographs framed in enamelled metal that are over a metre in circumference. Combining delicate suspensions of flowers and fruit in household liquids such as hair gel and milk, the work alludes to a fluidity of boundaries. The artist challenges the notions of a centred stable subjectivity, suggesting a constant permeation of self.

==Death and legacy==
Chadwick died suddenly at age 42 of a heart attack in 1996. Although they declared no proof, pathologists suggested a link between her heart attack and a viral infection causing a myocarditis – an inflammation of the heart muscle that could have been triggered anywhere between the last few years of her life and the last weeks.

In 2004–2005 a retrospective of Chadwick&#x27;s work organised by the Barbican Art Gallery toured four major galleries. These were the Barbican Art Gallery (London, UK), Liljevalchs konsthall (Stockholm, Sweden), Trapholt Kunstmuseum (Kolding, Denmark) and Manchester Art Gallery (Manchester, UK). In the preface to the catalogue, Marina Warner states that after the shock of Chadwick&#x27;s death it took some time for &quot;interest to return and for understanding to develop of her critical opus and her place in contemporary art&quot;.

Chadwick&#x27;s impact on the British art scene as an artist and teacher helped pave the way for the Young British Artist (YBA) generation. Her expanded use of materials can be seen carried through the work of many these artists. Without Chadwick&#x27;s &quot;Cacao&quot;, for example, it is impossible to imagine Anya Gallaccio&#x27;s chocolate and flower installations. Since Chadwick&#x27;s Barbican-organised retrospective, the full measure of her contribution to the trajectory of contemporary British art is starting to be realised. The Richard Saltoun Gallery in London represents the estate of Helen Chadwick, and has continued to show her work. &quot;Works From The Estate&quot; (2013) marked what would have been her 60th birthday, showing some of Chadwick&#x27;s most famous works. The following year &quot;Bad Blooms&quot; (2014) exhibited Chadwick&#x27;s &quot;Wreaths of Pleasure&quot; (1992–93).

Eight of Chadwick&#x27;s notebooks, which reveal her ideas and critical practice through the making of a number of her works, are available online from The Leeds Museums &amp; Galleries and the Henry Moore Institute Archive.

Tate Modern is showing a retrospective of Chadwick&#x27;s work from late September 2024 until 8 June 2025.

<doc id="206697" wikidata="Q5249364" url="?curid=206697" title="Declan McGonagle">
<text>Declan McGonagle is a well-known figure in Irish contemporary art, holding positions as director at the Orchard Gallery in Derry, the first director at the Irish Museum of Modern Art, and as director of the National College of Art and Design, Dublin. He writes, lectures and publishes regularly on art and museum/gallery policy issues, and curates exhibitions.

==Early life==
McGonagle was born in Derry in 1953. He attended St Columb&#x27;s College before studying Fine Art at the College of Art and Design in Belfast. In the 70&#x27;s and 80&#x27;s he worked as a painter and a lecturer of Art and Design at the Regional Technical College, Letterkenny, County Donegal.

==Career==

===Orchard Gallery===
Derry City Council was responsible for setting up the Orchard Gallery on Orchard Street in the city of Derry, McGonagle was appointed to the post of curator in 1978 and remained there until 1984 during the height of The Troubles. He gave up painting a year after he joined the Orchard. Orchard Gallery established itself on a minimal budget, and McGonagle found that international artists were attracted by the concept of addressing the issues of communities in conflict.

In 1983, he worked briefly for the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London, while keeping close contact and transferring exhibitions to the Orchard. He returned to Orchard in 1986 to continue running the gallery for another four years. In 1987 he became the first ever arts administrator to be shortlisted for the Turner prize for his work at the Derry gallery.

=== Irish Museum of Modern Art ===
In 1990, McGonagle was appointed director of the newly established Irish Museum of Modern Art (Imma) in Dublin.

He supported the contentious decision to use the 17th century Kilmainham Hospital location, as opposed to a new purpose-built premises in the then redeveloping Dublin Docklands area. Aidan Dunne of the Irish Times notes that at Imma &quot;over the years... the lack of a large exhibition space has on occasion been a drawback.&quot; Hugh Linehan, arts and culture editor at &quot;The Irish Times&quot;, commented in 2021 that McGonagle &quot;...fatefully insisted it should be located in the Royal Hospital&quot;, and that &quot;Imma has struggled to define itself against the backdrop of a beautiful but not very well-suited exhibition space.&quot;

McGonagle developed a strategy for working with contemporary artists to collect &quot;for the future&quot;, he proposed to give educational and community-related programmes equal importance to the curatorial work. The inaugural exhibition included works of Picasso, Mondrian, Gris, Braque, Giacometti and Miró.

In relation to Imma&#x27;s collection, McGonagle is quoted as saying &quot;most of what we buy is Irish,&quot; in 1993, &quot;but I&#x27;m not operating a quota system. Part of that has to do with the practical dimension of how often you see international work. £100,000 is actually quite a modest sum, although it&#x27;s a lot in Irish terms, so it&#x27;s only right that we redistribute that wealth back into the system [...] &quot; In 1994 the gallery acquired a semi-permanent Lawrence Weiner work for £20,000.

During his ten-year appointment as director at the Irish Museum of Modern Art, McGonagle saw the conversion of the property&#x27;s stables into accommodation and studio spaces, the (then) part-derelict Deputy Master&#x27;s House restored as a specialist exhibition space, and the 48 acres of the grounds dotted with contemporary sculptures.

In 1996, Irish abstract artist Gerald Davis wrote an article in &quot;The Irish Times&quot;, criticising McGonagle&#x27;s vision for Imma and calling for more historical and contemporary Irish artists to be represented at the gallery. He noted that &quot;the Irish Museum of Modern [sic] largely ignores the contribution made by our own artists of the last 50 years and does not regularly make a cross-section of their work accessible to the public. The current policy of promoting that which is internationally fashionable is, in essence, provincial.&quot;

The gallery&#x27;s highest footfall to date was recorded in 1997 at 350,000, as a result of the popular Andy Warhol exhibition. In 1999, Imma administered the first Nissan Millenium Art Project award of £40,000 for a temporary artwork. The award was granted to Dorothy Cross for her &#x27;Ghost Ship&#x27; project.

===CityArts===
City Arts Centre, a community arts organisation founded in 1973, did not receiving Arts Council funding in 2001. McGonagle was then hired as director and under his leadership the Centre began a process of cessation, starting with the closure of the Centre for 2 years with all staff made redundant and all activities stopped. City Councilor Mannix Flynn, on the closure of the City Arts Centre, said that “Dublin lost an arts community down there, the community lost an arts centre, lost employment”. McGonagle launched a &#x27;Civil Arts Inquiry&#x27; (a two year series of &quot;conferences and recorded public debates&quot;) meanwhile earning €50,000 per year. The &#x27;Inquiry&#x27; had skeptics, dismissing it for not engaging with the art community and as a profit-driven waste of time, without producing any results. Under McGonagle the Centre&#x27;s building and property on Moss Street in central Dublin was sold in 2003 for more than €4.2 million, making it the richest arts organisation in Ireland at the time.

After the sale, the City Arts Centre spent the next few years in a basement office and in 2007 bought a smaller building on Bachelor&#x27;s Walk. However, it needed repairs and only reopened in 2010 (as CityArts). At this time the organisation had spent nearly all of its savings between operational costs, archiving, the &#x27;Civil Arts Inquiry&#x27;, redundancy packages, and the new building with its renovations. In 2012 CityArts voluntarily liquidated, with the new building becoming the property of the Dublin City Council. As of 2024 the old Moss Street building has remained unused and undeveloped.

===NCAD===
In 2008 McGonagle took up the post as Director of the National College of Art and Design, Dublin (NCAD). Under his governance, NCAD began an academic alliance in 2010 with UCD, and in 2012, McGonagle announced that the college was in talks regarding a possible merger with University College Dublin. McGonagle assured staff and students that a campus move to Belfield was not on the agenda. McGonagle resigned from NCAD in 2015 amidst controversy.

===Other projects===

Aside from his 1983 stint at Institute of Contemporary Arts, in 1993 McGonagle sat on a subcommittee of the Cultural Relations Committee (CRC) to reinstate the Irish Pavilion at the Venice Biennale. The exhibition in 1993 saw Dorothy Cross and Willie Doherty represent Ireland. It was the first time Ireland had participated in the event since 1962. Also that year, McGonagle was a member of the Turner Prize jury. From 2004 to 2008, McGonagle was the first director of a new research centre in the School of Art and Design at the Ulster University, Belfast.

==Controversy==

===Imma===
In February 2000 the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Síle de Valera, appointed Marie Donnelly, a leading socialite and charity fundraiser, to chair a new board at Imma. Shortly thereafter &quot;she advised the then director, Declan McGonagle, that she was advertising his post.&quot; But because &quot;after his first five years in the position, his contract had been renewed without the post being publicly advertised&quot; McGonagle took legal action. In November 2000 Board members were informed that lawyers for McGonagle were applying to the High Court for an injunction restraining Imma from publicly advertising the director&#x27;s position.

The issue took on larger proportions as &quot;...public perception was that [Donnelly] was somehow against community arts and in favour of international blockbuster exhibitions, that she was a wealthy socialite out to bring down a man of the people.&quot; During this time there was public support for McGonagle and a high profile threats were made to withdraw collections and funding from the gallery should the director lose his position. The businessman and art collector Gordon Lambert claimed he intended to reassess his relationship with Imma .

However, &quot;after four months he won a renewal of his contract, but he then resigned&quot; abruptly, but with considerable compensation. He was able to negotiate a severance package with government mediator Paddy Teehan and was allegedly awarded €250,000 in the settlement. Other reports say he was &quot;awarded five years’ salary (€370,000) five years’ pension contributions (€31,000), five years’ housing subsidy (€90,000) and a car.&quot;

===NCAD===
McGonagle resigned from NCAD in 2015, a year in which &quot;questions about accounting practices, a drastic increase in student numbers, the introduction of student charges, and questionable revenue management&quot; emerged.

In 2015, after numerous delays in producing its accounts over the course of 8 years, NCAD&#x27;s state funding was put in question during a Committee of Public Accounts (a standing committee of the Irish parliament). Early in 2015 &quot;The Comptroller &amp; Auditor General Seamus McCarthy told the Public Accounts Committee that accounting practices in NCAD were &quot;not fit for purpose&quot;&quot;, and Labour TD Robert Dowds said it was &quot;one of the most scandalous situations with which the committee has been presented&quot;.

There were related student protests and a sit-in in March 2015, followed by a near unanimous SIPTU vote at an Emergency General Meeting on April 15, 2015 of &#x27;no confidence&#x27; in the senior management:&quot;At an Emergency General Meeting of SIPTU members in NCAD, held on April 15, a motion was passed that stated: “Following the recent appearance of NCAD before the Public Accounts Committee and in support of the action of students, SIPTU members have expressed no confidence in the Senior Management Team of NCAD to plan for the long term fiscal and academic future of the college. We will as requested by our members bring this to the attention of the Department of Education and the HEA.”&quot;On 11 September 2015 McGonagle announced his intention to retire as director of the National College of Art and Design at the end of the year citing &quot;personal reasons&quot;.

<doc id="206705" wikidata="Q172035" url="?curid=206705" title="Colin Farrell">
<text>Colin James Farrell (; born 31 May 1976) is an Irish actor. A leading man in blockbusters and independent films since the 2000s, he has received various accolades, including three Golden Globe Awards and a nomination for an Academy Award. &quot;The Irish Times&quot; named him Ireland&#x27;s fifth-greatest film actor in 2020, and &quot;Time&quot; magazine named him one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2023.

Farrell began acting in the BBC drama series &quot;Ballykissangel&quot; (1998) and made his film debut in the drama &quot;The War Zone&quot; (1999). His first lead film role was in the war drama &quot;Tigerland&quot; (2000), and he made his breakthrough in Steven Spielberg&#x27;s science fiction film &quot;Minority Report&quot; (2002). He took on high-profile roles such as Bullseye in &quot;Daredevil&quot; (2003) and as Alexander the Great in &quot;Alexander&quot; (2004), with further starring roles in Michael Mann&#x27;s &quot;Miami Vice&quot; (2006) and Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;Cassandra&#x27;s Dream&quot; (2007).

Farrell earned acclaim for playing a novice hitman in his first film with frequent collaborator Martin McDonagh, the dark comedy &quot;In Bruges&quot; (2008), winning a Golden Globe Award. He went on to play a variety of leading and character roles in the comedy &quot;Horrible Bosses&quot; (2011), the science fiction film &quot;Total Recall&quot; (2012), the drama &quot;Saving Mr. Banks&quot; (2013), the dark comedies &quot;Seven Psychopaths&quot; (2012) and &quot;The Lobster&quot; (2015), the thrillers &quot;The Killing of a Sacred Deer&quot; (2017), &quot;The Beguiled&quot; (2017) and &quot;Widows&quot; (2018), and the fantasy films &quot;Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them&quot; (2016) and &quot;Dumbo&quot; (2019). He also starred in the second season of HBO&#x27;s thriller series &quot;True Detective&quot; (2015).

Farrell played Oz Cobb / Penguin in the superhero film &quot;The Batman&quot; (2022) and the HBO series &quot;The Penguin&quot; (2024), winning a Golden Globe award for the latter. In 2022, he gained acclaim for his roles in the science fiction drama &quot;After Yang&quot;, the survival film &quot;Thirteen Lives&quot;, and McDonagh&#x27;s drama &quot;The Banshees of Inisherin&quot;. For playing a naïve Irishman in the lattermost, he won the Volpi Cup for Best Actor and another Golden Globe, in addition to a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor.

==Early life==
Colin James Farrell was born in Castleknock, a western suburb of Dublin on 31 May 1976, to Rita (née Monaghan) and Eamon Farrell. His father played football for Shamrock Rovers FC and ran a health food shop. Colin played for Castleknock Celtic FC, and the team was managed by his father. Colin&#x27;s uncle, Tommy Farrell, also played for Shamrock Rovers. Colin has an older brother named Eamon Jr. and two sisters named Claudine (who now works as his personal assistant) and Catherine. Colin grew up Catholic and went to St. Brigid&#x27;s National School, Castleknock, followed by the exclusive all-boys private school Castleknock College, and then Gormanston College in Gormanston Castle in County Meath. He unsuccessfully auditioned for the boy band Boyzone around that time.

Colin Farrell was inspired to try acting when Henry Thomas&#x27; performance in &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot; (1982) moved him to tears. With his brother&#x27;s encouragement, he attended the Gaiety School of Acting, but dropped out when he was cast as Danny Byrne in the BBC drama &quot;Ballykissangel&quot;. While traveling in Sydney at the age of 18, Farrell became a suspect in an attempted murder case. The police sketch looked remarkably like him and he had even described blacking out during the night in question; his only alibi was that a friend journaled that the two had been taking MDMA on the other side of town that night.

==Career==
===1998–2003: Early career and breakthrough===
Farrell had roles in television shows and films, including &quot;Ballykissangel&quot; and &quot;Falling for a Dancer&quot; in 1998 and 1999. He made his feature film debut in English actor Tim Roth&#x27;s directorial debut, &quot;The War Zone&quot;, a drama about child sexual abuse, starring Ray Winstone and Tilda Swinton as parents of a girl Farrell&#x27;s character (Nick) dates. Farrell appeared in &quot;Ordinary Decent Criminal&quot; with Kevin Spacey and Linda Fiorentino, a film loosely based on the life of Martin Cahill. In 2000, Farrell was cast in the lead role of Private Roland Bozz in &quot;Tigerland&quot;, directed by Joel Schumacher. Farrell reportedly got the part on the basis of his charm. Emanuel Levy of &quot;Variety&quot; said that Farrell &quot;shines as the subversive yet basically decent lad whose cynicism may be the only sane reaction to a situation&quot;. Michael Holden of &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote that Farrell was &quot;too much the hero&quot; to fit the classic rebel archetype properly, but he still delivered a good performance. &quot;Tigerland&quot; earned $139,500.

Farrell&#x27;s next American films, &quot;American Outlaws&quot; (2001) and &quot;Hart&#x27;s War&quot; (2002), were not commercially successful. His 2002–2003 films, including &quot;Phone Booth&quot;, &quot;The Recruit&quot; and &quot;S.W.A.T.&quot; (all thrillers, with the former two his first starring roles), were well received by critics and successful at the box office. Of &quot;Phone Booth&quot;, Roger Ebert wrote that it is &quot;Farrell&#x27;s to win or lose, since he&#x27;s onscreen most of the time, and he shows energy and intensity&quot;. Philip French of &quot;The Guardian&quot; praised Farrell&#x27;s performance. In &quot;S.W.A.T.,&quot; Farrell starred in an ensemble cast including Samuel L. Jackson, Michelle Rodriguez, Olivier Martinez and Jeremy Renner; Renner became a friend. Alan Morrison of &quot;Empire&quot; wrote, &quot;Farrell can usually be relied upon to bring a spark to the bonfire. That&#x27;s also true of [this movie].&quot; Elvis Mitchell of the &quot;New York Times&quot; criticised Farrell&#x27;s accent, writing that he &quot;employ[ed] a wobbly American accent that makes him sound like an international criminal a step ahead of the authorities&quot;. Ebert and &quot;The New York Times&quot;″ A.O. Scott disagreed on Farrell&#x27;s effectiveness in &quot;The Recruit&quot;; Ebert noted Farrell&#x27;s likability, but Scott felt that Farrell &quot;spends his time in a caffeinated frenzy, trying to maintain his leading-man sang-froid while registering panic, stress and confusion&quot;. &quot;Phone Booth&quot; earned $46.6 million, &quot;S.W.A.T.&quot; $116.9 million and &quot;The Recruit&quot; $52.8 million at the box office.

Farrell&#x27;s supporting roles include an ambitious Justice Department agent opposite Tom Cruise as a &quot;potential criminal&quot; in &quot;Minority Report&quot; (2002), and Bullseye, the villain in &quot;Daredevil&quot; (2003). Matt Damon was originally offered the &quot;Minority Report&quot; role, turning it down to appear in &quot;Ocean&#x27;s Eleven&quot;. Farrell said &quot;he had no problem&quot; being the producer&#x27;s fallback after Damon declined. Farrell was signed to the role in December 2001, although he was considered for the lead role of Matt Murdock (Daredevil) until Ben Affleck signed. Farrell was encouraged to keep his Irish accent, since this version of Bullseye is from Ireland. He read Frank Miller&#x27;s Daredevil comics to understand Bullseye &quot;because the expression on the character&#x27;s faces in the comic books, and just the way they move sometimes, and the exaggerations of the character I&#x27;m playing... he&#x27;s so over-the-top that you do draw from that. But it&#x27;s not exactly a character you can do method acting for...you know, running around New York killing people with paper clips&quot;. In 2003, he was voted sixth World&#x27;s &quot;Sexiest Man&quot; by &quot;Company&quot; magazine.

===2003–2008: Career progression===
In late 2003 Farrell starred as a criminal who plots a bank robbery with Cillian Murphy in the dark comedy &quot;Intermission&quot;, which held the record for highest-grossing Irish independent film in Irish box-office history for three years. In 2004, he appeared in several other independent films receiving limited theatrical release in most countries, including &quot;A Home at the End of the World&quot; (adapted from Michael Cunningham&#x27;s novel of the same name). Roger Ebert praised Farrell, saying that he was &quot;astonishing in the movie, not least because the character is such a departure from everything he has done before&quot;. Mick LaSalle of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; differed, saying that Farrell &quot;is keen on making good...The effort is there, but it&#x27;s a performance you end up rooting for rather than enjoying, because there&#x27;s no way to just relax and watch&quot;.

Farrell played the title role of Alexander the Great in Oliver Stone&#x27;s 2004 biographical film &quot;Alexander&quot;, which, while receiving some favourable reviews internationally, was poorly received in the United States. Its portrayal of the conqueror as bisexual was controversial; the film was criticised by some historians for its treatment of the ancient Persians, although others praised it for its accuracy. An ancient history scholar at the University of Nebraska wrote:
The film grossed $167 million worldwide, just exceeding its budget of $155 million.

Farrell&#x27;s next film was 2005&#x27;s Academy Award-nominated &quot;The New World&quot;, his second historical epic. He played the lead role of Captain John Smith, the founder of 17th-century colonial Jamestown, Virginia who falls in love with the Native American princess Pocahontas (Q&#x27;Orianka Kilcher). Director Terrence Malick went out of his way to keep Farrell and Kilcher apart until they were filmed together. Although it was released in only 811 theatres worldwide and had a relatively low box-office gross, the film received a large number of positive reviews. In one of four reviews in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, John Patterson described it as a &quot;bottomless movie, almost unspeakably beautiful and formally harmonious&quot;. &quot;The New World&quot; was followed by &quot;Ask the Dust&quot;, a period romance set in Los Angeles based on a John Fante novel and co-starring Salma Hayek. Reviews were mixed; Manohla Dargis of &quot;The New York Times&quot; favourably described Farrell&#x27;s work, but Peter Bradshaw of &quot;The Guardian&quot; found &quot;something a little forced in both lead performances&quot;. With a limited theatrical release, it was not a financial success.

Farrell was more successful in 2006 with his role opposite Jamie Foxx in Michael Mann&#x27;s action crime drama, &quot;Miami Vice&quot;. The film grossed $164 million worldwide on a budget of $135 million, and &quot;TimeOut New York&quot; ranked it among the top 50 movies of the decade. The DVD, released the same year, also managed to sell over a million copies (equivalent to $7.91 million in pirated versions) in its first week alone, and, as of 11 February 2007, had grossed over $36.45 million in rentals. A. O. Scott criticised Farrell&#x27;s work: &quot;When he&#x27;s not on screen, you don&#x27;t miss him, and when he is, you find yourself, before long, looking at someone or something else.&quot; Conversely, Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; was enthusiastic. Farrell also reportedly took a slight pay cut to make friend and recent Oscar winner Jamie Foxx happy; his salary was initially larger than Foxx&#x27;s.

Farrell appeared in Woody Allen&#x27;s drama &quot;Cassandra&#x27;s Dream&quot;, which premiered in 2007 and was distributed in the US in early 2008. Mick LaSalle of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; praised Farrell: &quot;Allen is notorious for not giving his actors explicit instructions, and yet somehow this worked wonders for Farrell, who has never seemed so naked, so clear, and so unencumbered as he does here.&quot; Manohla Dargis concurred in the &quot;New York Times&quot;, adding that she thought Farrell was well-matched with co-star Ewan McGregor.

Farrell&#x27;s next film, Martin McDonagh&#x27;s first full-length feature, &quot;In Bruges&quot;, opened the 2008 Sundance Film Festival. While &quot;The New Yorker&quot; and &quot;TimeOut London&quot;″s film critics found co-star Brendan Gleeson&#x27;s performance the stronger of the two, Bradshaw of &quot;The Guardian&quot; found Farrell (as hitman Ray) to be &quot;absolutely superb: moody and funny, lethally sexy, sometimes heartbreakingly sad and vulnerable like a little boy&quot;. Farrell won his first Golden Globe Award for his performance in the film.

Shortly thereafter, he appeared in &quot;Kicking It&quot;, a documentary following six homeless men from Kenya, Russia, Afghanistan, Ireland, Spain, and the US as they attempt to qualify for the Homeless World Cup. Farrell appeared on screen and provided the narration, donating his earnings to a homeless shelter in Ireland. The film was released simultaneously in theatres and on television, airing on ESPN2 in a very short window before its DVD release. Farrell received positive reviews for his involvement in the true story.

Later in 2008, Farrell starred opposite Edward Norton in &quot;Pride and Glory&quot;, a police drama directed by Gavin O&#x27;Connor. Roger Ebert disliked the film and A. O. Scott said that Farrell &quot;once again indulges his blustery mixture of menace and charm, overdoing both,&quot; but Gregory Kirschling of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; liked Farrell&#x27;s work.

===2009–2021: Established actor===

On 11 January 2009, Farrell won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for &quot;In Bruges&quot;, in which he co-starred with Brendan Gleeson. In the same year, he also appeared in Terry Gilliam&#x27;s film &quot;The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus&quot;, starring Christopher Plummer and Andrew Garfield. Farrell was one of three actors (with Johnny Depp and Jude Law), who helped to complete Heath Ledger&#x27;s role when Ledger died before filming ended. They played &quot;Imaginarium&quot; versions of Ledger&#x27;s character Tony, donating their earnings to Ledger&#x27;s daughter Matilda. Farrell also starred that year in &quot;Triage&quot;, directed by Oscar-winning Bosnian screenwriter and director Danis Tanović, about the life of a war correspondent. He lost 30 pounds for the role. Farrell&#x27;s work was described as &quot;dedicated&quot; by &quot;Variety&quot;″s Todd McCarthy, and Julian Sancton of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; wrote that the film was &quot;a hell of a lot more insightful than other movies that deal with a similar topic&quot;. However, &quot;Triage&quot; was not widely distributed due to the marketing challenges posed by its difficult topics (including PTSD). That year, Farrell played a supporting role (as Tommy Sweet) in &quot;Crazy Heart&quot; with Jeff Bridges.

Another 2009 release was &quot;Ondine&quot;, a fantasy-drama directed by Neil Jordan starring Farrell as a fisherman with a disabled daughter. Shot in the village of Castletownbere on Ireland&#x27;s southwest coast, it featured cinematography by longtime Wong Kar-wai collaborator Christopher Doyle. Mary Pols of &quot;Time&quot; called the role &quot;tailor-made for Farrell&quot;, saying that Farrell gave a &quot;beautifully confident performance&quot;. Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; singled Farrell out, noting that he worked well as an ensemble actor &quot;graciously allowing [child star Alison Barry] to steal every scene she&#x27;s in&quot;.

The next year, Farrell starred with Keira Knightley in the crime romance &quot;London Boulevard&quot;. The film, American William Monahan&#x27;s debut as director after writing screenplays for &quot;The Departed&quot; and &quot;Body of Lies&quot;, was panned by critics. Peter Bradshaw of the &quot;Guardian&quot; wrote that the film &quot;uses up all its energy, wit and ideas in the first 20 or so minutes, before collapsing into a flurry of boring violence&quot;. Leslie Felperin of &quot;Variety&quot; described it as &quot;like a fancy, retro-styled pocket watch that someone accidentally broke and tried to reassemble with only a vague idea of clockwork&quot;. Felperin thought the stars&#x27; work was frail, with Farrell &quot;mostly taciturn and vacuous.&quot;
Farrell starred in the 2011 comedy &quot;Horrible Bosses&quot;, directed by Seth Gordon with Jennifer Aniston, Jason Bateman, Charlie Day, Jason Sudeikis, Kevin Spacey, and his &quot;Miami Vice&quot; co-star Jamie Foxx also in the cast. The film focuses on a trio of employees who plot to murder their tyrannical bosses. &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s Mark Kermode wrote that although the film would have benefited from a tighter script, Farrell and Foxx had juicy roles which they &quot;riff with panache&quot;. Michael Phillips of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that Farrell brought &quot;massive, slobby relish&quot; to his role as Sudeikis&#x27; cocaine-fiend boss.

Later that year, Farrell played the main antagonist in the &quot;Fright Night&quot; remake, joining Anton Yelchin, David Tennant and Toni Collette in the story of a charismatic vampire who moves next door to a high-school student and his single mother. The film was released by DreamWorks, with Craig Gillespie (of &quot;Lars and the Real Girl&quot;) directing a script by &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; writer Marti Noxon. Sukhdev Sandhu of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; wrote that Farrell &quot;proves his comedy credentials once more...utterly seductive as the plushly eyebrowed carpenter-cum-bloodsucker&quot;, while &quot;The New York Times&quot;″ A.O. Scott thought that Farrell played his role with &quot;a wink and a snarl and a feline purr&quot;. Logan Hill of &quot;New York&quot; magazine, on the other hand, was confused by Farrell&#x27;s performance: &quot;Sure, [it] may not make much sense, but neither do centuries-old vampires living in Nevadan subdivisions. So he goes for it.&quot;

Farrell starred with Kate Beckinsale in Columbia Pictures&#x27; &quot;Total Recall&quot;, a 2012 remake of the 1990 film, playing the role originally played by Arnold Schwarzenegger. It was filmed from May to September 2011 in Toronto and directed by Len Wiseman. Co-star Jessica Biel appreciated Farrell&#x27;s skills, calling him &quot;surprising and exciting. He just has the ability to be trying different things all the time.&quot; Roger Ebert and &quot;The New York Times&quot; said that although they believed Farrell the better actor, Schwarzenegger in the original was &quot;more of a movie presence and better suited for the role&quot;.

Farrell&#x27;s second film with Martin McDonagh, &quot;Seven Psychopaths&quot;, premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival and was released in October 2012. He starred as creatively blocked writer Marty in a black comedy with Sam Rockwell, Woody Harrelson, and Christopher Walken. The film broke even at the box office, with generally good reviews, including David Rooney of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; writing that Farrell &quot;serves as an excellent foil for Rockwell&quot; and he &quot;is in subdued mode... his performance largely defined by the endless expressivity of his eyebrows.&quot; That month, Farrell appeared on the cover of the magazine &quot;Details&quot;.

In March 2013, Farrell starred in &quot;Dead Man Down&quot;, a thriller directed by Niels Arden Oplev, appearing alongside Terrence Howard for the first time since &quot;Hart&#x27;s War&quot; 10 years earlier. Noomi Rapace, star of Oplev&#x27;s &quot;The Girl with a Dragon Tattoo&quot;, starred as a facially scarred woman who blackmails Farrell&#x27;s character into killing the man who disfigured her in a car crash. Reviews were mixed, with &quot;Empire&quot; magazine calling the film &quot;a pleasingly intricate double (or is it triple?) revenge plot anchored by excellent acting&quot; and &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; saying that &quot;[J.H.] Wyman&#x27;s script and the measured pace don&#x27;t lend themselves to the necessary escalating tension that would have resulted in a more rewarding climax.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot;″ Manohla Dargis called the film a failure, but said of Farrell that &quot;his sensitive, hardworking eyebrows help keep it from becoming a full-bore lampoon.&quot; Joe Neumaier of the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; also disliked the film, writing that it contained &quot;a lot to roll your eyes over&quot; and that Farrell was &quot;as stoic as a statue&quot;.

In 2014, Farrell starred in a film adaptation of Mark Helprin&#x27;s &quot;Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot;. The film was written and directed by Akiva Goldsman and based on Helprin&#x27;s 1983 novel, and co-starred Jessica Brown Findlay, Jennifer Connelly, Russell Crowe, and Will Smith. Farrell won the lead role over younger actors Garrett Hedlund, Tom Hiddleston and Aaron Taylor-Johnson. Although the film generally received negative reviews, writers such as &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s Stephanie Zacharek had nothing but praise for Farrell. She described him as &quot;an extraordinary appealing actor&quot; who &quot;has always made a terrific bad boy, but ... seems to be settling into some very serious, responsible-adult roles.&quot; Mick LaSalle of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; agreed, writing that Farrell &quot;holds the movie together&quot; and is part of &quot;the most beautiful [love scene] so far of 2014.&quot;

His role as P. L. Travers&#x27; alcoholic father in &quot;Saving Mr. Banks&quot; received contrasting reviews, with Scott Foundras of &quot;Variety&quot; calling it &quot;excellent&quot; and Leslie Felperin of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; deeming it &quot;his best work in some time&quot;; conversely, Peter Bradshaw of &quot;The Guardian&quot; described his performance as &quot;bland&quot; and &quot;uninspired&quot;, while Robbie Collin of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; found Farrell miscast in the role.

Farrell starred in Liv Ullmann&#x27;s adaptation of August Strindberg&#x27;s &quot;Miss Julie&quot; opposite Jessica Chastain and Samantha Morton. His turn as John, the serving man to Chastain&#x27;s character&#x27;s father, was described by Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; as the &quot;strongest&quot; of the three performances, though Ullmann&#x27;s direction was deemed too flat by most reviewers. Farrell starred in the second season of the TV series &quot;True Detective&quot; as Ray Velcoro, alongside Vince Vaughn, Taylor Kitsch, and Rachel McAdams. The first two episodes were directed by Justin Lin. He worked with a dialect coach to adopt a nonstandard Californian accent for his character, which he found challenging.

Farrell starred in &quot;The Lobster&quot;, a romantic science fiction thriller which was released in 2015 and directed by Greek director Yorgos Lanthimos in his English-language debut. Its script was awarded the ARTE International Prize for Best CineMart 2013 Project at the 42nd Rotterdam International Film Festival. Set in a dystopian near-future in which finding a partner is a matter of life and death, the film tells an unconventional love story. The film also stars Rachel Weisz, Ben Whishaw, Olivia Colman, Léa Seydoux, and John C. Reilly.

In 2016, Farrell starred in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; spin-off film &quot;Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them&quot;; a traced version of a licensed promotional photo of Farrell from the film was subsequently used for the character Nefarian Serpine on the tenth anniversary cover of 2007&#x27;s &quot;Skulduggery Pleasant&quot;, the first book in the series of the same name. In 2017, he had leading roles in the films &quot;The Beguiled&quot;, &quot;The Killing of a Sacred Deer&quot;, and &quot;Roman J. Israel, Esq.&quot; In 2018, he co-starred in Steve McQueen&#x27;s thriller &quot;Widows&quot;, and then starred in Tim Burton&#x27;s 2019 live-action fantasy &quot;Dumbo&quot;.

=== 2022–present ===
In 2022, Farrell co-starred in the film &quot;Thirteen Lives&quot;, which chronicles the 2018 Tham Luang cave rescue of a Thai boys&#x27; soccer team that was trapped 2.5 miles inside the cave for eighteen days as a result of a flash-flood. The British cave divers Rick Stanton and John Volanthen participated in the rescue operation and retrieved the boys. During this production, Farrell and the other cast members did their own stunts and diving. In an interview about the film, Farrell admitted to suffering significant anxiety from the underwater work. He portrayed Oswald &quot;Oz&quot; Cobb / Penguin in Matt Reeves&#x27; 2022 film &quot;The Batman&quot;. He continued to portray the character in a spin-off solo series &quot;The Penguin&quot; on HBO in 2024 with his performance earning critical praise and the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Miniseries or Television Film. Farrell will reprise the role in &quot;The Batman Part II&quot; (2027).

Also in 2022, Farrell reunited with Martin McDonagh and Brendan Gleeson for &quot;The Banshees of Inisherin&quot;, which earned Farrell a Volpi Cup for Best Actor from the 79th Venice Film Festival and a Golden Globe, as well as a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor.

In February 2024, it was reported that Farrell would star alongside Margot Robbie in Kogonada&#x27;s film &quot;A Big Bold Beautiful Journey.&quot; Filming began in April that year.

==Charity work==
In 2007, Farrell joined other celebrities as a spokesperson for the Special Olympics World Games in Shanghai. He also lent his support to the anti-bullying campaign Stand Up! organised by the Irish LGBT youth organisation BeLonG To in March 2012. Farrell, whose brother, Eamonn, is gay, had appeared on &quot;The Ellen DeGeneres Show&quot; two years earlier to increase awareness of the subject.

In 2015, Colin Farrell became an official Ambassador of the Homeless World Cup, which uses street football to inspire homeless people to change their lives. On August 7, 2024, he announced that he will be starting the Colin Farrell Foundation in dedication to his son James, who has Angelman syndrome. The organization provides support to adults with intellectual disabilities and their families. &quot;This is the first time I’ve spoken about it,&quot; he said, &quot;and obviously the only reason I’m speaking is I can’t ask James if he wants to do this.&quot;

==Personal life==
Farrell owns homes in Dublin and Los Angeles. In 2013, he revealed that he suffers from insomnia and has suffered from occasional bouts of depression and dark thoughts.

===Relationships and children===
Farrell met English actress and singer Amelia Warner at the premiere of &quot;Quills&quot; in 2000. They dated from July to November 2001. There was unproven speculation that they married. Farrell said of the relationship that they were &quot;too fast, too young&quot;. He has had relationships with American model Nicole Narain, and actresses Angelina Jolie, Elizabeth Taylor, Maeve Quinlan, and Demi Moore.

He has a son, James Padraig Farrell, born on 12 September 2003, with American model Kim Bordenave. In October 2007, he said that his son has Angelman syndrome, a rare genetic disorder characterised by intellectual and developmental delay, lack of speech, and an excitable demeanour.

From 2007 to 2008, Farrell dated Irish medical student Muireann McDonnell. Farrell and British-American writer Emma Forrest dated for over a year, an experience she discussed in depth in her memoir &quot;Your Voice in My Head&quot; (which mostly focused on her relationship with her therapist, who died unexpectedly). According to Forrest, she and Farrell planned to have a child together before he ended the relationship.

On 7 October 2009, Farrell&#x27;s second son, Henry Tadeusz Farrell, was born to Polish actress Alicja Bachleda-Curuś (his &quot;Ondine&quot; co-star). Farrell and Bachleda-Curuś split in 2010.

===Drug addiction and sobriety===
Farrell said in an interview that &quot;[He had] been drunk or high since [he] was 14.&quot; In December 2005, he checked into a rehabilitation centre for addictions to recreational drugs and painkillers. He commented on the topic during an interview on &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; after leaving rehab, and continued later to talk about it. He said, &quot;There was an energy that was created, a character that was created, that no doubt benefited me... then there was a stage where it all began to crumble around me.&quot;

Farrell has been sober since leaving the rehab centre in 2006, and has credited his sobriety to his elder son James. In 2018, he voluntarily checked himself into rehab, as a &quot;preemptive measure&quot;, in order to maintain his sobriety.

===Sex tape===
In January 2006, Farrell filed a lawsuit against his ex-girlfriend, American model Nicole Narain, and the Internet Commerce Group (ICG) for the unauthorised public distribution of a 13-minute sex tape they had made in 2003. He was offered $5 million for its rights. While ICG tried to release it, Narain said that she would work with Farrell to ensure that the tape remained private. Farrell said she tried to release it to damage his acting career and &quot;make money out of it&quot;, which Narain denied. On 16 April 2006, they reached a confidential settlement; Farrell&#x27;s lawsuit against ICG continued with a trial date of 21 July 2006, and was eventually settled amicably.

<text>Juma Khan is an ethnic Baloch drug lord from Afghanistan&#x27;s southern Nimruz Province.

Juma Khan was an illiterate provincial Baloch drug smuggler from Nimruz Province in southwestern Afghanistan in the 1990s. He suddenly rose to national prominence after the American-led invasion of Afghanistan. He was briefly detained by American forces after the 2001 fall of the Taliban and released, even though American officials knew that he was involved in narcotics trafficking. After being released, he inexplicably seized control of the town of Bahramcha in the Chagai Hills on the Pakistan-Iran-Afghanistan border in late 2001 and turned it into a hub of drug smuggling and gun running into Pakistan and Iran.

His organization was designated as a Narcotics Kingpin under the SDN by the United States Department of the Treasury&#x27;s Office of Foreign Assets Control, with addresses in Pakistan and Afghanistan.

In 2008, he was detained for unknown reasons in Indonesia and transported to New York. He was quietly released on April 20, 2018, without any pending charges or a trial. No official explanation was provided.

<doc id="206712" wikidata="Q1354034" url="?curid=206712" title="Michael Schwerner">
<text>Michael Henry Schwerner (November 6, 1939 – June 21, 1964) was an American civil rights activist. He was one of three Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) field workers murdered in rural Neshoba County, Mississippi, by members of the Ku Klux Klan. Schwerner and two co-workers, James Chaney and Andrew Goodman, were killed in response to their civil rights work, which included promoting voting registration among African Americans, most of whom had been disenfranchised in the state since 1890.

==Early life and education==
Born and raised in Pelham, New York, to a family of Jewish heritage, Schwerner attended Pelham Memorial High School. He was called Mickey by his friends. His mother, Anne Siegel (May 1, 1912 – November 29, 1996), was a science teacher at nearby New Rochelle High School, and his father, Nathan Schwerner (June 19, 1909 – March 6, 1991), was a businessman. Schwerner attended Michigan State University, originally intending to become a veterinarian. He transferred to Cornell University and switched his major to rural sociology. While an undergraduate at Cornell, he was initiated into the school&#x27;s chapter of Alpha Epsilon Pi fraternity. He entered graduate school at the School of Social Work at Columbia University.

As a boy, Schwerner befriended Robert Reich, who later became U.S. Secretary of Labor. Schwerner helped protect Reich, who was smaller, from bullies.

==Civil rights activism==
In the early 1960s Schwerner became active in working for civil rights for African Americans; he led a local Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) group on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, called &quot;Downtown CORE.&quot; He participated in a 1963 effort to desegregate Gwynn Oak Amusement Park in Maryland. As activism increased in the South, Schwerner, recruited by John Lewis, and his wife, Rita Schwerner Bender, volunteered to work for National CORE in Mississippi, under the tutelage of Dave Dennis, the CORE state director. Bob Moses assigned the Schwerners to organize the community center and activities in Meridian. James Chaney was a local youth who started working with them there. The Schwerners were the first whites to be assigned by CORE permanently outside the state capital of Jackson. In the summer of 1964 CORE intended to hold classes and drives to register African Americans to vote in the state, what they called &quot;Freedom Summer&quot;. Many volunteers, mostly college students and young adults, had been recruited from local communities and northern/western states to work on this project.

Civil rights activists were resented and held under suspicion by white Mississippians. Spies paid by the Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission, a taxpayer-funded agency, kept track of all northerners and suspected activists. The Commission conducted economic boycotts and intimidation against activists. In 1998 its records were opened by court order, revealing the state&#x27;s deep complicity in the 1964 murders of three civil right workers because its investigator, A. L. Hopkins, passed on information about the workers, including their car license number, to the Commission. Records showed the Commission passed the information on to the Sheriff of Neshoba County, Lawrence Rainey, who was implicated in the murders.
The Ku Klux Klan targeted Schwerner after he and his wife, Rita, had taken over the Meridian CORE field office, where they established a community center for blacks as part of grassroots organizing. Schwerner tried to establish contact with white working-class citizens of Meridian and went door-to-door to speak with them. He also organized a black boycott of a popular variety store until it hired its first African American, under the principle of &quot;don&#x27;t shop where you can&#x27;t work&quot;.

==Murder==

James Chaney, Andrew Goodman, and Michael Schwerner were murdered near the town of Philadelphia, Mississippi. They were investigating the burning of Mt. Zion Methodist Church, which had been a site of a CORE Freedom School, in a nearby community. Parishioners had been beaten in the wake of Schwerner and Chaney&#x27;s voter registration rallies for CORE. The Sheriff&#x27;s Deputy, Cecil Price, had been accused by parishioners of stopping their caravan and forcing the deacons to kneel in the headlights of their own cars, while they were beaten with rifle butts. That same group of white men was identified as having burned the church.

Deputy Sheriff Cecil Price arrested Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner for an alleged traffic violation and took them to the jail in Neshoba County. They were released that evening, without being allowed to telephone anyone. On the way back to Meridian, they were stopped by patrol lights and two carloads with members of the White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan on Highway 19, then taken in Price&#x27;s car to another remote rural road. One of the Klansmen, Alton Wayne Roberts, reportedly pulled Schwerner out of the car, pointed a gun at his chest, and asked &quot;Are you that nigger lover?&quot;. Schwerner replied &quot;Sir, I know just how you feel,&quot; before Roberts shot him in the heart. Goodman was killed by Roberts in the same manner, while Chaney was killed by either Roberts or James Jordan, after beating, chain-whipping and castrating him.

The men&#x27;s bodies remained undiscovered for 44 days. In the meantime, the case of the missing civil-rights workers became a major national story, especially coming on top of other events during Freedom Summer. The federal government quickly assigned the FBI to a full investigation and called in Navy sailors and other forces to aid in the search.

Schwerner&#x27;s widow Rita, who also worked for CORE in Meridian, expressed indignation publicly at the way the story was handled. She said she believed that if only Chaney (who was black) was missing and the two white men from New York had not been killed along with him, the case would not have received nearly as much national attention, as other black civil rights workers had earlier been killed in the South.

==First trial==
The US government prosecuted the case under the Enforcement Act of 1870. Seven men, including Deputy Sheriff Price, were convicted. Three strongly implicated defendants were acquitted because of a jury deadlock.

==Reinvestigation==
Journalist Jerry Mitchell, an award-winning investigative reporter for the &quot;Jackson Clarion-Ledger&quot; had written extensively about the case for many years in the late 20th century. Mitchell had earned renown for helping secure convictions by his investigation of several other high-profile Civil Rights Era murder cases, including the assassination of Medgar Evers in Mississippi, the 1963 16th Street Baptist Church bombing in Birmingham, and the murder of Vernon Dahmer in his Mississippi home, the latter of which was ordered by Samuel Bowers, founder of the Klan chapter that killed the CORE activists. Mitchell developed new evidence, found new witnesses, and pressured the state to take action. Barry Bradford, an Illinois high school teacher, and three students: Allison Nichols, Sarah Siegel, and Brittany Saltiel, joined Mitchell&#x27;s efforts. Their documentary, produced for the National History Day contest, presented important new evidence and compelling reasons for reopening the case. Bradford also obtained an interview with Edgar Ray Killen, which helped convince the State to reinvestigate. Mitchell was able to determine the identity of &quot;Mr. X&quot;, the mystery informer who had helped the FBI discover the bodies and smash the conspiracy of the Klan in 1964. He relied in part on evidence developed by Bradford.

On January 7, 2005, Edgar Ray Killen, an outspoken white supremacist nicknamed &quot;Preacher,&quot; pleaded &quot;Not Guilty&quot; to state charges of the murders of the three men. The jury found him guilty of three counts of manslaughter on June 21, 2005. He was the only man charged with homicide in connection to the killings. Killen was sentenced to sixty years in prison—twenty years for each count, served consecutively. Killen passed away in prison in 2018, aged 92.

==Personality==
Schwerner &quot;was described by family and friends as friendly, good-natured, gentle, mischievous, and &#x27;full of life and ideas&#x27;. He believed all people were essentially good. He loved sports, animals, poker, W.C. Fields, and rock music.&quot;

Robert Reich, the American political commentator, professor, and author who served in the administrations of Presidents Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, and Bill Clinton, says that as a child, he was bullied, and sought out the protection of older boys; one of them was Michael Schwerner. Reich cites this event as an inspiration to &quot;fight the bullies, to protect the powerless, to make sure that the people without a voice have a voice.&quot;

==Legacy and honors==

===Schwerner===
*In 2008, his hometown of Pelham, New York, renamed a section of Harmon Avenue as &quot;Michael Schwerner Way&quot; in his honor.
*Schwerner, along with Goodman and Chaney, received a posthumous Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Barack Obama in 2014.

<text>Piper Laurie (born Rosetta Jacobs; January 22, 1932 – October 14, 2023) was an American actress. She is known for her roles in the films &quot;The Hustler&quot; (1961), &quot;Carrie&quot; (1976), and &quot;Children of a Lesser God&quot; (1986), and the miniseries &quot;The Thorn Birds&quot; (1983). She is also known for her performances as Kirsten Arnesen in the original TV production of &quot;Days of Wine and Roses&quot;, and as Catherine Martell in the television series &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;. 

She received various accolades, including a Primetime Emmy Award and a Golden Globe Award, in addition to nominations for three Academy Awards and a BAFTA Award.

==Early life==
Piper Laurie was born Rosetta Jacobs in Detroit, Michigan, on January 22, 1932. Laurie was the younger of two children (both girls) of Alfred Jacobs, a furniture dealer, and his wife, Charlotte Sadie ( Alperin) Jacobs. Her paternal grandparents were Jewish immigrants from Poland and her maternal grandparents were Jewish immigrants from Russia.

Laurie was delivered, according to her 2011 autobiography &quot;Learning to Live Out Loud&quot;, in a one-bedroom walk-up on Tyler Street in Detroit, where the family lived. To combat her shyness, her parents provided her with weekly elocution lessons.

Laurie&#x27;s mother and grandmother placed Laurie&#x27;s older sister in a sanitarium for her asthma. Laurie was sent along to keep her company.

==Career==
In 1949, Jacobs signed a contract with Universal Studios, and changed her screen name to Piper Laurie, which she used thereafter. Her breakout role was in &quot;Louisa&quot; (1950) with Ronald Reagan, whom she dated briefly before his marriage to Nancy Davis. In her autobiography, she claimed that she lost her virginity to him. Several other roles followed: &quot;Francis Goes to the Races&quot; (1951, co-starring Donald O&#x27;Connor); &quot;Son of Ali Baba&quot; (1951, co-starring Tony Curtis); and &quot;Ain&#x27;t Misbehavin&#x27;&quot; (1955, co-starring Rory Calhoun).

To polish her image, Universal Studios told gossip columnists that Laurie bathed in milk and ate flower petals to protect her luminous skin. Discouraged by the lack of substantial film roles, she moved to New York City to study acting and to seek work on the stage and in television. She appeared in &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;, produced by Hallmark Hall of Fame, in &quot;Days of Wine and Roses&quot; with Cliff Robertson, presented by &quot;Playhouse 90&quot; on October 2, 1958 (in the film their roles were played by Jack Lemmon and Lee Remick), and in &quot;Winterset&quot;, presented by &quot;Playhouse 90&quot; in 1959.
Laurie was lured back to Hollywood by the offer to co-star with Paul Newman in &quot;The Hustler&quot;, released in 1961. She played Newman&#x27;s girlfriend, Sarah Packard, and for her performance, she received an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress. Substantial movie roles did not come her way after &quot;The Hustler&quot;, so she and her husband moved to New York. In 1964, she appeared in two medical dramas—as Alicia Carter in &quot;The Eleventh Hour&quot; episode &quot;My Door Is Locked and Bolted&quot;, and as Alice Marin in the &quot;Breaking Point&quot; episode &quot;The Summer House&quot;. In 1965, she starred in a Broadway revival of Tennessee Williams&#x27;s &quot;The Glass Menagerie&quot;, opposite Maureen Stapleton, Pat Hingle, and George Grizzard.

Laurie did not appear in another feature film until she accepted the role of religious fanatic Margaret White in the horror film &quot;Carrie&quot; (1976). She received an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress for her performance. The commercial success of the film, and recognition for her performance, relaunched her career. Her co-star Sissy Spacek praised her acting skill: &quot;She is a remarkable actress. She never does what you expect her to doshe always surprises you with her approach to a scene.&quot;

In 1979, Laurie appeared as Mary Horton in the Australian movie &quot;Tim&quot; opposite Mel Gibson. After her 1981 divorce, Laurie moved to California. She received a third Oscar nomination for her portrayal of Mrs. Norman in &quot;Children of a Lesser God&quot; (1986). The same year, she was awarded an Emmy for her performance in &quot;Promise&quot;, a television movie, co-starring James Garner and James Woods. She had a featured role in the Off-Broadway production of &quot;The Destiny of Me&quot; in 1992, and returned to Broadway for Lincoln Center&#x27;s acclaimed 2002 revival of Paul Osborn&#x27;s &quot;Morning&#x27;s at Seven&quot;, with Julie Hagerty, Buck Henry, Frances Sternhagen, and Estelle Parsons.

In 1990–1991, Laurie starred as the devious Catherine Martell in David Lynch&#x27;s television series &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;. She also appeared in &quot;Other People&#x27;s Money&quot; with Gregory Peck (1991), and in horror maestro Dario Argento&#x27;s first American film &quot;Trauma&quot; (1993). She played George Clooney&#x27;s character&#x27;s mother on &quot;ER&quot;. In 1997, she appeared in the film &quot;A Christmas Memory&quot; with Patty Duke, and in 1998, she appeared in the sci-fi thriller &quot;The Faculty&quot;. 

Laurie made guest appearances on television shows such as &quot;Frasier&quot;, &quot;Matlock&quot;, &quot;State of Grace&quot;, and &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot;. Laurie also appeared in &quot;Cold Case&quot; and in a 2001 episode of &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; titled &quot;Care&quot;, in which she played an adoptive mother and foster grandmother who killed one of the foster granddaughters in her daughter&#x27;s charge and who abused her adoptive son and foster grandchildren.

She returned to the big screen for independent films, such as &quot;Eulogy&quot; (2004) and &quot;The Dead Girl&quot; (2006), opposite actress Toni Collette. In 2010, she played Rainn Wilson&#x27;s mother in &quot;Hesher&quot;, and in 2018, she had a supporting role in &quot;White Boy Rick&quot; as the grandmother of the title character.

==Personal life==

Laurie was married to &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; entertainment writer and &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; movie critic Joe Morgenstern. (She had previously dated actor and future U.S. president Ronald Reagan.) They met shortly after the release of &quot;The Hustler&quot; in 1961 when Morgenstern interviewed her during the film&#x27;s promotion. They soon began dating, and nine months after the interview, they were married on January 21, 1962. When no substantial roles came her way after &quot;The Hustler,&quot; she and Morgenstern moved to Woodstock, New York. In 1971, they adopted a daughter, Anne Grace Morgenstern. In 1982, the couple divorced, after which she moved to the Hollywood area and continued working in films and television. 

In 1962, she was Harvard&#x27;s Hasty Pudding Woman of the Year. In 2000, she received the Spirit of Hope Award in Korea for her service during the Korean War. She appeared at the September 2014 Mid-Atlantic Nostalgia Convention in Hunt Valley, Maryland.

Laurie was also a sculptor who worked in marble and clay.

Having been unwell for some time, Laurie died in Los Angeles on October 14, 2023, at age 91.

Page won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her role in &quot;The Trip to Bountiful&quot; (1985). She was Oscar-nominated for her work in &quot;Hondo&quot; (1953), &quot;Summer and Smoke&quot; (1961), &quot;Sweet Bird of Youth&quot; (1962), &quot;You&#x27;re a Big Boy Now&quot; (1966), &quot;Pete &#x27;n&#x27; Tillie&quot; (1972), &quot;Interiors&quot; (1978), and &quot;The Pope of Greenwich Village&quot; (1984). She is also known for her film roles &quot;What Ever Happened to Aunt Alice?&quot; (1969), &quot;The Beguiled&quot; (1971) and &quot;The Rescuers&quot; (1977). 

On stage, she made her Broadway debut in the 1953 play &quot;Mid-summer&quot;. She went on to received Tony Award nominations for her performances as Princess Kosmonopolis in &quot;Sweet Bird of Youth&quot; (1959), Marion in &quot;Absurd Person Singular&quot; (1974), Mother Miriam Ruth in &quot;Agnes of God&quot; (1982), and Madame Arcati in &quot;Blithe Spirit&quot; (1987). For her prolific work onstage she was inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame in 1979. For her roles in television she received two Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Single Performance by an Actress in a Leading Role in a Drama for her acting in the adaptations of Truman Capote&#x27;s &quot;A Christmas Memory&quot; (1967) and &quot;The Thanksgiving Visitor&quot; (1969).

== Early life and education ==
Page was born November 22, 1924, in Kirksville, Missouri, the first child of Edna Pearl (née Maize) and Leon Elwin Page who worked at Andrew Taylor Still College of Osteopathy and Surgery (combined with the American School of Osteopathy, eventually to form A.T. Still University). He was an author whose works included &quot;Practical Anatomy&quot; (1925), &quot;Osteopathic Fundamentals&quot; (1926), and &quot;The Old Doctor&quot; (1932). She had one younger brother, Donald.

At age five, Page relocated with her family to Chicago. Raised a Methodist by her mother, Page was an active parishioner of the Englewood Methodist Church in Chicago, where she had her first foray into acting within the church&#x27;s theatre group, appearing in a play called Excuse My Dust, then playing Jo March in a 1941 production of Louisa May Alcott&#x27;s &quot;Little Women&quot;. After graduating from Chicago&#x27;s Englewood Technical Prep Academy, she attended the Goodman School of Drama at the Art Institute of Chicago (now at DePaul University), with the intention of becoming an actress. Page had aspirations of becoming a pianist or visual artist, but at 17 she appeared in her first amateur theatre production, and from that point, she never wavered from her desire to be a professional actress. 

After graduating from the Art Institute of Chicago in 1945, Page studied acting at the Herbert Berghof School and the American Theatre Wing in New York City, studying with Uta Hagen for seven years, and then at the Actors Studio with Lee Strasberg. During this time, Page would return to Chicago in the summers to perform in repertory theatre in Lake Zurich, Illinois, where she and several fellow actors had established their own independent theater company. She also spent two critically successful years performing with a winter stock company called the Woodstock Players, another group from Goodman, who performed mostly at the Woodstock Opera House where she was singled out by critic Claudia Cassidy of The Chicago Tribune as destined to be a star to bear watching. During that time she was called &quot;the lady with the thousand faces&quot; for her ability to change her looks and actions to an extent that her most devoted fans were unable to recognize her. While attempting to establish her career, she worked various odd jobs, including as a hat-check girl, theater usher, lingerie model, and a factory laborer.

==Career==
=== 1945–1969: Early stage and film===
Page, a trained method actor, spent five years appearing in various repertory theater productions in the Midwest and New York after graduating from college. On October 25, 1945, she made her New York stage debut in &quot;Seven Mirrors&quot;, a play devised by Immaculate Heart High School students from Los Angeles. The play ran for a total of 23 performances at Blackfriars Repertory Theatre on Manhattan&#x27;s Upper East Side. In February 1952, director José Quintero cast Page in a minor role in &quot;Yerma&quot;, a theatrical interpretation of a poem by Federico García Lorca, staged at Circle in the Square Theatre in New York City&#x27;s Greenwich Village. Page was subsequently cast in the role of Alma in the Quintero-directed production of &quot;Summer and Smoke&quot;, written by Tennessee Williams (also staged at the Circle Theatre in 1952). Page&#x27;s role in &quot;Summer and Smoke&quot; garnered her significant exposure, including a Drama Desk Award, and a profile in &quot;Time&quot; magazine.
Her official film debut and role in &quot;Hondo&quot;, opposite John Wayne, garnered her a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. Prior to this, she appeared in an uncredited role in &quot;Taxi&quot;. Speaking to a Kirksville newspaper, she said: &quot;Actually &quot;Hondo&quot; wasn&#x27;t my first movie. I had one small, but satisfactory scene in a Dan Dailey picture called &quot;Taxi&quot;, which was filmed in New York.&quot; Page was blacklisted in Hollywood after her debut in &quot;Hondo&quot; based on her association with Uta Hagen and did not work in film for nearly ten years. Her work continued on Broadway playing a spinster in the 19541955 production of &quot;The Rainmaker&quot;, written by N. Richard Nash; and as the frustrated wife whose husband becomes romantically obsessed with a young Arab, played by James Dean, in the 1954 production of &quot;The Immoralist&quot;, written by Augustus Goetz and Ruth Goetz and based on the novel of the same name (1902) by André Gide. Page remained friends with Dean until his death the following year and kept a number of personal mementos from the play—including several drawings by him. After Page&#x27;s death, these items were acquired by Heritage Auctions in 2006. In 2015 Angelica Page revealed that her mother had an affair with Dean during the production of &quot;The Immoralist&quot;. She stated, &quot;According to my mother, their affair went on for three-and-a-half months. In many ways my mother never really got over Jimmy. It was not unusual for me to go to her dressing room through the years, obviously many years after Dean was gone, and find pictures of him taped up on her mirror. My mother never forgot about Jimmy -- never. I believe they were artistic soul mates.&quot;

Prior to &quot;Hondo&quot;, in 1952, she appeared in a revival of &quot;Summer and Smoke&quot; in 1952 putting herself, the play, and director Jose Quintero at the beginning of the Off-Broadway scene. Page played the same role of Alma Winemiller in a 1953 radio version (opposite Richard Kiley) and a film version in 1961 opposite Laurence Harvey. Both she and Una Merkel earned acting nominations for Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress respectively in the 34th Academy Awards in 1961. The awards, however, went to Sophia Loren for &quot;Two Women&quot; and Rita Moreno for &quot;West Side Story&quot;.

In 1959, Page earned an Emmy nomination, of Best Single Performance by an Actress, for her role in the &quot;Playhouse 90&quot; episode &quot;The Old Man&quot;, written by William Faulkner. She subsequently earned critical accolades for her performance in the 1959–1960 Broadway production of Tennessee Williams&#x27;s &quot;Sweet Bird of Youth&quot; opposite Paul Newman, in which she originated the role of a larger-than-life, addicted, sexually voracious Hollywood legend trying to extinguish her fears about her career with a young hustler named Chance Wayne (played by Newman). For her performance, Page received her first nomination for the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play, as well as the Sarah Siddons Award for her performance in Chicago. She and Newman subsequently starred in the 1962 film adaptation of the same name and Page earned a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress for the film.

Geraldine Page actually won consecutive Golden Globe Awards for Best Actress in a Motion Picture - Drama in 1961 and 1962 for &quot;Summer and Smoke&quot; and &quot;Sweet Bird of Youth&quot;, respectively.

In 1963, Page starred in &quot;Toys in the Attic&quot;, based on Lillian Hellman&#x27;s play of the same name, and garnered a Golden Globe nomination. She received another nomination the following year starring in Delbert Mann&#x27;s &quot;Dear Heart&quot; as a self-sufficient but lonely postmistress visiting New York City for a convention, finding love with a greeting card salesman. In 1964, she starred in a Lee Strasberg-directed Broadway revival of Anton Chekhov&#x27;s &quot;Three Sisters&quot; playing eldest sister Olga to Kim Stanley&#x27;s Masha with Barbara Baxley as the interloper Natasha. Both Shirley Knight and Sandy Dennis played the youngest sister Irina at different stages in this production.
Between 1966 and 1969, Page appeared in two holiday-themed television productions based on stories by Truman Capote: &quot;The Christmas Memory&quot; (for &quot;ABC Stage 67&quot;) and the television film &quot;The Thanksgiving Visitor&quot;, both of which earned her two consecutive Emmy Awards for Best Actress. In 1967, Page appeared again onstage in Peter Shaffer&#x27;s &quot;Black Comedy/White Lies,&quot; a production which also included Michael Crawford and Lynn Redgrave, who were making their Broadway debuts. The same year, she appeared opposite Fred MacMurray in the Walt Disney-produced musical &quot;The Happiest Millionaire&quot;. Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; was critical of the film, noting: &quot;Geraldine Page and Gladys Cooper...square off in one musical scene of socially up-staging each other that is drenched in perfumed vulgarity. But, then, the whole picture is vulgar. It is an over-decorated, over-fluffed, over-sentimentalized endeavor to pretend the lace-curtain millionaires are—or were—every bit as folksy as the old prize-fighters and the Irish brawlers in the saloon.&quot;

Page starred opposite Ruth Gordon in the thriller &quot;What Ever Happened to Aunt Alice?&quot; (1969), the third and final film in the Robert Aldrich-produced trilogy which followed &quot;What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?&quot; (1962) and &quot;Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte&quot; (1964). The film is based on the novel &quot;The Forbidden Garden&quot; by Ursula Curtiss and features Page as Claire Marrable, a recently widowed socialite, who, discovers that her husband has left her virtually nothing. The widow hires a number of unsuspecting housekeepers whom she murders one by one and robs them of their life savings in order to keep up her extravagant lifestyle. Writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Vincent Canby deemed the film &quot;an amusingly baroque horror story told by a master misogynist,&quot; and praised Page&#x27;s &quot;affecting&quot; performance.

===1970–1979: Mid-career work===
Page subsequently appeared in the Don Siegel-directed thriller &quot;The Beguiled&quot; (1971) opposite Clint Eastwood, playing the headmistress of a Southern girls&#x27; boarding school who takes in a wounded Union soldier. Director Siegel called Page &quot;certainly as fine an actor as I&#x27;ve ever worked with. I never have gotten along better with anyone than I did with her.&quot; This was followed by a supporting role in the comedy &quot;Pete &#x27;n&#x27; Tillie&quot; (1972), for which she earned an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress. She also appeared in three episodes of Rod Serling&#x27;s &quot;Night Gallery&quot; between 1972 and 1973. In January 1973, she returned to Broadway playing Mary Todd Lincoln opposite Maya Angelou in the two-character play &quot;Look Away&quot;, written by Jerome Kilty. In 1974, Page played Regina in a production in which she starred opposite her husband Rip Torn (in the role of Benjamin Hubbard) directed by Philip Minor. It was staged for the Academy Festival Theater at Barat College in Lake Forest, Illinois and received a rave review from William Leonard of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;: &quot;Geraldine Page is giving one of the greatest performances of her glorious career in Lake Forest and she is surrounded by a cast so superb that the Academy Festival Theater&#x27;s production of &quot;The Little Foxes&quot; becomes a powerful, searing, unforgettable show... it is a harrowing and ennobling evening in the theater-the kind that comes along all 
too seldom. We have seen other stars in the role of the malevolently, ruthlessly scheming Regina Giddens—Tallulah Bankhead years ago in her greatest triumph, Eileen Herlie five seasons back at the Ivanhoe. Geraldine Page is a whole new story—I have seen Geraldine Page in innumerable roles, ever since she was playing in &quot;East Lynne&quot; with the Lake Zurich Players back in the &#x27;40s. I&#x27;ve never seen her more thrillingly convincing than in this production.&quot;
The legendary Kim Stanley once said of Page&#x27;s Regina that it &quot;was possibly the finest performance&quot; she had ever seen.
received a nomination for the Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Play (her second Tony Award nomination) for the 1975 production of Alan Ayckbourn&#x27;s &quot;Absurd Person Singular&quot; with Sandy Dennis and Richard Kiley.

She also had a supporting role as a charismatic Hollywood evangelist (modeled after Aimee Semple McPherson) in &quot;The Day of the Locust&quot; (1975), an adaptation of the Nathanael West novel of the same name. In 1977, she appeared as a nun in the British comedy &quot;Nasty Habits&quot;, and provided the voice role of Madame Medusa in the Walt Disney animated film &quot;The Rescuers&quot;. During this time, she also appeared on television, guest-starring in the popular series &quot;Kojak&quot; (1976) and &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot; (1977).

Page appeared as the mother of three siblings and wife of a prominent attorney in Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;Interiors&quot; (1978). For her performance, Page was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress, and won a BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role. &quot;The New York Times&quot;″s Vincent Canby lauded her performance in the film, writing: &quot;Miss Page, looking a bit like a youthful Louise Nevelson with mink-lashed eyes, is marvelous — erratically kind, impossibly demanding, pathetic in her loneliness and desperate in her anger.&quot; The following year, in November 1979, Page was inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame.

=== 1980–1986: Later work and final roles===

Page starred as Zelda Fitzgerald in the last major Broadway production of a Williams play, &quot;Clothes for a Summer Hotel&quot; in 1980, followed by a supporting role in &quot;Harry&#x27;s War&quot; (1981). Page starred as the secretive nun Mother Miriam Ruth in the Broadway production of &quot;Agnes of God,&quot; which opened in 1982 and ran for 599 performances with Page performing in nearly all of them; for her role, she received a nomination for the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play.

Also in 1983, Sabra Jones Strasberg and her husband John Strasberg founded the Mirror Theater Ltd and invited Page to accept the role of Founding Artist in Residence for its repertory program the Mirror Repertory Company. Page remained continually active in theater, appearing in numerous repertory, Broadway, and Off-Broadway productions throughout the 1980s; this included roles in a revivals of &quot;Inheritors&quot; by Susan Glaspell and &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; by Clifford Odets in 1983, &quot;Rain&quot; by John Colton (based on the short story &quot;Miss Thompson&quot; by W. Somerset Maugham) the following year. Further revivals followed in 1985: &quot;Vivat! Vivat Regina!&quot; by Robert Bolt (in which she played Elizabeth I), &quot;Clarence&quot; by Booth Tarkington, and &quot;The Madwoman of Chaillot&quot; (by Jean Giraudoux) in which she played the Madwoman to great acclaim).

Page earned her seventh Academy Award nomination for her performance in the dark comedy &quot;The Pope of Greenwich Village&quot; (1984). This marked a record at the time for most Academy Award nominations without a win, for which Page was tied with Peter O&#x27;Toole and Richard Burton (who themselves had also garnered seven nominations without winning). On television, Page had a supporting role in the miniseries &quot;The Dollmaker&quot; (1984), opposite Jane Fonda and Amanda Plummer. She appeared in the British horror film &quot;The Bride&quot; opposite Sting and Jennifer Beals; the drama &quot;White Nights&quot;, directed by Taylor Hackford; and opposite Rebecca De Mornay in the drama &quot;The Trip to Bountiful&quot; (all 1985), in which she played an aging Southern Texas woman seeking to return to her hometown. The role earned Page wide critical acclaim, with the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; referring to it as &quot;the performance of a lifetime.&quot;

In 1986, she appeared on Broadway in &quot;The Circle&quot; by W. Somerset Maugham; during this production, Page won the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance in &quot;The Trip to Bountiful&quot;. During her acceptance speech, she thanked The Mirror Theater Ltd. Page wore her costume from &quot;The Circle&quot;, which had been designed and made by Gail Cooper-Hecht, the Mirror Theater&#x27;s costume designer. She received the award from F. Murray Abraham, who, after winning his Oscar for &quot;Amadeus&quot;, also joined the Mirror Repertory Company to play the rag-picker in the &quot;Madwoman of Chaillot&quot;. Prior to winning the Academy Award, Page said to &quot;People&quot; magazine: &quot;If I lose the Oscar this year, I&#x27;ll have the record for the most nominations without ever winning... I&#x27;d love to be champion, [but the loser] doesn&#x27;t have to get up there and make a fool of herself.&quot;

After winning the Academy Award, Page returned to finish her run performing in &quot;The Circle&quot; for Mirror Theater and appeared opposite Carroll Baker, Oprah Winfrey, and Elizabeth McGovern in &quot;Native Son&quot; (1986). Page followed up &quot;Native Son&quot; with a lead role opposite Mary Stuart Masterson in &quot;My Little Girl&quot; (1987). In the fall of 1986, Page asked permission to return to Broadway in a revival of Noël Coward&#x27;s &quot;Blithe Spirit&quot; in the role of Madame Arcati. She was cast in the role, though the production would be Page&#x27;s last. She was again nominated for the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play, though she did not win. A week after the Tony Awards ceremony, Page failed to appear for two performances of the play and was found dead in her Manhattan home. The show lasted several weeks more, with Page&#x27;s understudy Patricia Conolly taking over her role.

==Reception and acting style==

Page was trained as a method actor, and at times worked with psychoanalysts when developing her interpretations of roles. She once told the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;: &quot;If I read a part and think I can connect to it, that I can touch people with it, I will do it, no matter what its size. And if I think I can&#x27;t do something with a part, I won&#x27;t take it.&quot; In a 1964 interview after completing the Broadway run of &quot;The Three Sisters&quot;, Page discussed her method acting at length. When asked if she used emotional recall as a technique, she responded: &quot;I would never shut it out. But I don&#x27;t try to get one. My whole effort is to relax and keep the doors open so that there&#x27;s room if one should pop up.&quot;

During her life, Page was regarded as a respected character actress. Speaking of her stage career in 1986, she said: &quot;I used to think that by opening [night] all the work was done. Now I&#x27;m finding how much you can learn from the audience.&quot; She described acting as a &quot;bottomless cup&quot;, adding, &quot;If I studied for the next ninety years I&#x27;d just be scratching the surface.&quot;

==Personal life==
Page was married to violinist Alexander Schneider from 1954 to 1957. On September 8, 1963, she married actor Rip Torn, who was six years her junior, in Pinal, Arizona. They had played opposite one another in &quot;Sweet Bird of Youth&quot; on Broadway and in the 1962 film. They had three children: a daughter, actress Angelica Page, and twin sons, Anthony &quot;Tony&quot; and Jonathan &quot;Jon&quot; Torn.

Beginning in the early 1980s, Page and Torn lived separately after he began an affair with actress Amy Wright; Torn had first met Wright in 1976 and began the affair shortly after. Page was aware of Torn and Wright&#x27;s relationship, and had appeared onstage opposite Wright in the 1977 Off-Broadway production of &quot;The Stronger&quot;, under Torn&#x27;s direction. In 1983, Torn fathered a child with Wright. After the birth of the child, Page was questioned about her marriage by columnist Cindy Adams, to which she responded: &quot;Of course Rip and I are still married. We&#x27;ve been married for years. We&#x27;re staying married. What&#x27;s the big fuss?&quot; In spite of their separation, Page and Torn remained married until her death; her daughter described their relationship as still &quot;close&quot; up until Page died in 1987.

Page considered herself a gourmand, once joking: &quot;&#x27;Greedy Gut&#x27; is my middle name...Rip is wonderful. He does the cooking, and I do the eating. I love everything but eggplant.&quot;

==Death and legacy ==

On June 13, 1987, Page failed to arrive at the Neil Simon Theatre for both the afternoon and evening performances of Noël Coward&#x27;s &quot;Blithe Spirit&quot;, which had begun its run in March. At the end of the show&#x27;s evening performance, the play&#x27;s producer announced that Page had been found dead in her lower Manhattan townhouse. It was determined that she died of a heart attack.

On June 18, &quot;an overflow crowd of colleagues, friends and fans&quot;, including Sissy Spacek, James Earl Jones, Amanda Plummer, Jerry Stiller, Anne Meara and husband Torn attended a memorial service held at the Neil Simon Theatre.

Highlighting Page&#x27;s achievements, actress Anne Jackson said, &quot;[Page] used a stage like no one else I&#x27;d ever seen. It was like playing tennis with someone who had 26 arms.&quot; Rip Torn called her &quot;Mi corazón, mi alma, mi esposa&quot; (&quot;My heart, my soul, my wife&quot;) and said that they had &quot;never stopped being lovers, and ... never will&quot;.

==Acting credits and accolades==
Page earned a total of eight nominations before winning her first Academy Award for Best Actress in 1986 for &quot;The Trip to Bountiful&quot;. She was also a winner of two Golden Globe Awards, two Primetime Emmy Awards, and one BAFTA award.

For her stage work on Broadway, Page earned a total of four Tony Award nominations, and was referred to by the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; as &quot;one of the finest stage actors of her generation&quot;. She was inducted into the American Theatre Hall of Fame in 1979.

==In popular culture==
Sarah Paulson portrayed Page in the 2017 anthology television series &quot;Feud&quot;, which chronicles the rivalry between actresses Bette Davis and Joan Crawford on the set of &quot;What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?&quot; (1962).

She was also portrayed by her daughter, Angelica Page, in the stage production &quot;Turning Page&quot;. A monologue play chronicling Page&#x27;s life, it was also written by her daughter: &quot;I grew up in the center of her sparkling career,&quot; Angelica recalled. &quot;As her only daughter I feel compelled to share her lessons and gifts with others who did and did not have the opportunity to know her magic intimately. She was a true rebel and trail blazer. A masterful woman who was ahead of her time and should not be forgotten anytime soon.&quot; The play premiered in Los Angeles in 2016, followed by performances in New York City in 2017.

<doc id="206718" wikidata="Q13424688" url="?curid=206718" title="Summer and Smoke">
<text>Summer and Smoke is a two-part, thirteen-scene play by Tennessee Williams, completed in 1948. He began working on the play in 1945 as &quot;Chart of Anatomy&quot;, derived from his short stories &quot;Oriflamme&quot; and &quot;Yellow Bird&quot;, the latter still a work-in-progress. The phrase &quot;summer and smoke&quot; probably comes from the Hart Crane poem &quot;Emblems of Conduct&quot; in the 1926 collection &quot;White Buildings&quot;. After a disappointing Broadway run in 1948, the play was a hit Off-Broadway in 1952. Williams continued to revise &quot;Summer and Smoke&quot; in the 1950s, and in 1964 he rewrote the play as &quot;The Eccentricities of a Nightingale&quot;.

== Synopsis ==
&quot;Summer and Smoke&quot; is set in Glorious Hill, Mississippi, from the &quot;turn of the century through 1916&quot;, and centers on Alma Winemiller, a highly strung, unmarried minister&#x27;s daughter, and the spiritual/romance that nearly blossoms between her and John Buchanan Jr., a young doctor who grew up next door. She, ineffably refined, identifies with the Gothic cathedral, &quot;reaching up to something beyond attainment&quot;; her name, as Williams makes clear during the play, means &quot;soul&quot; in Spanish; by contrast Buchanan, a doctor and sensualist, defies her with the soulless anatomy chart.

By the play&#x27;s end, Buchanan and Alma have traded places philosophically. She has been transformed. She throws herself at him, saying &quot;she doesn&#x27;t exist any more, she died last summer — suffocated in smoke from something on fire inside her&quot;. But he has changed, he is engaged to marry a respectable, younger girl, and as he tries to convince Alma that what their relationship was indeed a &quot;spiritual bond&quot;, she realizes that it is too late to rescue it. In the final scene, Alma accosts a young traveling salesman in the park and follows him to enjoy the entertainment at Moon Lake Casino.

== Production history ==
On 6 October 1948, after an opening run in Dallas, Texas, &quot;Summer and Smoke&quot; received its first Broadway performance at the Music Box Theatre in New York City in a production staged by Margo Jones and designed by Jo Mielziner with Tod Andrews, Margaret Phillips, Monica Boyar and Anne Jackson. The play ran for 102 performances, and at the time, represented a comparative failure for Williams following his success with &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot;.

In 1952, Geraldine Page played the lead role in a revival directed by José Quintero at the newly founded Circle in the Square Theatre, which was then in its Sheridan Square Playhouse location in lower Manhattan. Her performance has been credited with helping to launch the Off-Broadway movement, putting both herself and Quintero on the map and vindicating the play. In 1953, Page starred opposite Richard Kiley in an hour-long adaptation of the play on the radio series &quot;Best Plays&quot;, recordings of which still exist. She also portrayed Alma Winemiller in the 1961 film opposite Laurence Harvey, earning an Academy Award nomination, as did Una Merkel playing her mother. Additional Oscar nominations went to the Art Direction and Elmer Bernstein&#x27;s evocative musical score. In 1963, Peter Boyle starred in the play during the opening season of Wayside Theatre.

The Broadway premiere of the revised version titled &quot;The Eccentricities of a Nightingale&quot; was staged in 1976. The production was directed by Edwin Sherin, with scenery by William Ritman, costumes by Theoni V. Aldredge, lighting by Marc B. Weiss and original music by Charles Gross. It was produced in conjunction with Marc W. Jacobs. The production stage manager was Henry Banister and press was by Seymour Krawitz, Patricia McLean Krawitz and Louise Ment. The show starred Betsy Palmer (Alma), Shepperd Strudwick (Rev. Winemiller), Grace Carney (Mrs. Winemiller), Nan Martin (Mrs. Buchanan), Peter Blaxill (Roger Doremus), Jen Jones (Mrs. Bassett), Patricia Guinan (Rosemary), W.P. Dremak (Vernon), Thomas Stechschulte (Traveling Salesman) and David Selby (Dr. Buchanan). The production ran for 24 performances at the Morosco Theatre.

In 1991, Gilles Gleizes translated in French, with Roberta Bailey, &quot;Summer and Smoke&quot;, and directed the play in France, Théâtre de Rungis et CDN de Limoges.

In 1996, the play was revived at the Criterion Center Stage Right in New York, in a production directed by David Warren, with Harry Hamlin and Mary McDonnell.

Olga Bellin, Laila Robins and Amanda Plummer have been notable Almas in regional productions.

It was nearly 60 years before the London premiere of &quot;Summer and Smoke&quot;. It opened at the Apollo Theatre on 17 October 2006. The production, directed by Adrian Noble, and starring Rosamund Pike and Chris Carmack, opened at the Nottingham Playhouse in September and then transferred to London. It closed 10 weeks short of its planned 16-week run due to disappointing ticket sales.

In January 2007, the Paper Mill Playhouse in Millburn, New Jersey, presented a revival starring Amanda Plummer and Kevin Anderson, directed by Michael Wilson. In May 2008, the Off-Broadway group The Actors Company Theatre (TACT) presented a revival of the 1964 revision of the play, titled &quot;The Eccentricities of a Nightingale&quot;, which received a favorable notice in &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

In 2017, the Almeida Theatre announced a new production starring Patsy Ferran, directed by Rebecca Frecknall and designed by Tom Scutt. After a successful run and several five-star reviews, the production was transferred to the Duke of York&#x27;s Theatre.

The play returned to Off-Broadway in the spring of 2018. It was performed by the Classic Stage Company, with Nathan Darrow and Marin Ireland in the lead roles. It was directed by Jack Cummings III.

== Adaptations ==

In 1961, a film adaptation by Paramount Pictures was directed by Peter Glenville, and starred Laurence Harvey, Rita Moreno, and Geraldine Page reprising her role as Alma. A television version was produced in 1972, starring Lee Remick, David Hedison, and Barry Morse. Another production, titled &quot;Eccentricities of a Nightingale&quot;, starring Blythe Danner and Frank Langella, aired as an episode of the PBS program &quot;Great Performances&quot; in 1976.

An operatic treatment of the play exists as well, composed by Lee Hoiby. It was first produced by the Minnesota Opera in 1971 and came to New York City Opera the following year. It was presented at Manhattan School of Music Opera Theater in December 2010 and at Converse College Opera Theatre in January 2018.

<doc id="206719" wikidata="Q969065" url="?curid=206719" title="Raasay">
<text>Raasay (; ), sometimes the Isle of Raasay, is an island between the Isle of Skye and the mainland of Scotland. It is separated from Skye by the Sound of Raasay and from Applecross by the Inner Sound. It is famous for being the birthplace of Gaelic poet Sorley MacLean, an important figure in the Scottish Renaissance.

Traditionally the home of Clan MacSween, the island was ruled by the MacLeods from the 15th to the 19th century. Subsequently, a series of private landlords held title to the island, which is now largely in public ownership. Raasay House, which was visited by James Boswell and Samuel Johnson in 1773, is now a hotel, restaurant, bar and outdoor activity centre. Raasay means &quot;Isle of the Roe Deer&quot; and the island is home to an endemic subspecies of bank vole. 

== Geology and geography ==
About north to south and east to west (at its widest), Raasay&#x27;s terrain is varied. The highest point, at , is Dùn Caan – an unusual, flat-topped peak. The island of Rona lies just off the north coast and the tidal islets of Eilean Fladday and Eilean Tigh are to the northwest. Other smaller surrounding islands are Eilean Aird nan Gobhar, Eilean an Inbhire, Holoman Island, Manish Island, Fraoch Eilean, Glas Eilean, Griana-sgeir and Eilean an Fhraoich. The main village of Inverarish is near the southwest coast and contiguous with both Clachan at the west end where the main pier is situated and Suishnish to the east. Oskaig is a small settlement further up the west coast.

Geologically interesting, the island is visited by many students engaged in mapping projects. The south is mainly Torridonian sandstone and shale; the north is grey-banded Archaean Lewisian gneiss and granulite. There are also smaller outcrops of Jurassic shales and sandstones occasionally interspersed with limestone. The related ironstone beds contain low grade oolitic siderite and chamosite ores which were worked commercially in the early 20th century. Remaining reserves are estimated at 10 million tonnes. The seas to the east and west are very deep, large troughs having been created by the Skye icecap in the Pleistocene.

== Economy and culture ==

The primary employment is in tourism, working for the ferry company, crofting and fishing, or commuting to work on Skye. A twenty-five-minute ride by the car and passenger ferry connects the island with Sconser on Skye. There is a primary school, but older students go to Portree High School by the ferry and bus.

Sites of interest include the remains of a broch, the ruins of Brochel Castle, inscribed stones, abandoned crofting communities, and many walking paths.

There is a shop/post office located in Inverarish. Accommodation is available in the old manor of Raasay House, and at various B&amp;Bs. There are significant numbers of incomers and holiday homes especially in the south of the island. This has helped to arrest the population decline from over 900 in 1803 to 194 in 2001. Some inhabitants belong to the Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland, which strictly observes the Sabbath. On Sundays there are no public services, the playground is closed and, until 2004, the ferry did not run.

In early 2007 the Raasay Community Association signed a contract with a number of building contractors to construct a community centre, which hosted its first céilidh on 29 May 2010. In 2008 construction began on a new £12 million ferry terminal at Churchton Bay, which was officially opened on 17 August 2010. Following the community buyout of Raasay House, a £3.5 million refurbishment was undertaken, leading to the temporary closure of the outdoor centre. However, in the early hours of 18 January 2009 the building was severely damaged by fire. Restoration work commenced in August 2010 but was suspended in November when the main contractor, ROK, went into administration. Work restarted with a new contractor, Mansell, in late 2011. Raasay House was officially handed over to the community in March 2013 and in addition to the 4 star accommodation it provides it is also now an outdoor activity centre with a restaurant, bar and cafe. 

In September 2017 the Isle of Raasay distillery opened after the conversion of Borodale House. One source described this as transforming the &quot;derelict Gothic hotel ... into a modern whisky distillery, visitor centre and accommodation&quot;. The company&#x27;s Single malt Scotch was described by one source as the island&#x27;s &quot;first legal single malt&quot; whisky. It released 7,500 bottles of the spirit in 2020, the first year that Raasay Single Malt became available.

== Flora and fauna ==
Raasay is home to the Raasay vole (&quot;Clethrionomys glareolus erica&quot;), a subspecies of bank vole, which is darker and heavier than the mainland variety and found nowhere else in the world. It is possibly a survivor of a Scandinavian race. Murray (1973) states that a single specimen of a pine marten, otherwise missing from the Hebrides, was found on the island in 1971. No other records for this species exist. Raasay is one of only four of the Inner Hebrides where mountain hares breed. Raasay is regularly visited by white-tailed sea eagles and golden eagles and there are populations of otter, red deer and European rabbit (which were introduced by the island&#x27;s proprietor in the 19th century). Stoat and weasel are found in small numbers as are water shrew. It also supports a rich variety of plants, including red broomrape, dark red helleborine, mountain avens and numerous other saxifrages, orchids, alpines and ferns. The carline thistle (&quot;Carlina vulgaris&quot;) was apparently extant in the 1970s, but a recent survey found no evidence of its continued existence. There are several stands of mixed woodland.

Between 1999 and 2004 a large scale archaeological project, Scotland&#x27;s First Settlers, was undertaken in the Inner Sound to locate and examine sites relating to the Mesolithic period in the strait. The entire coastline of the Inner Sound together with its islands was walked by volunteers and archaeologists. On Raasay they found 14 caves and rock shelters with evidence of prehistoric habitation, in the form of both middens and walls. Only the site at Loch an Sgurra at the far north of Raasay was confirmed as Mesolithic on the basis of both the stone tools and radiocarbon dating.

== History ==
The spread of Scots culture from Dalriada north of Ardnamurchan is poorly understood and little is recorded of Raasay&#x27;s early Christian period. The placename &quot;Kilmaluag&quot; suggests the presence of St Moluag in the late sixth century.

Following Viking expeditions to the islands they called the &quot;Suðreyjar&quot; in the eighth century, Raasay became part of the Norse Kingdom of the Isles and for much of the period religious observance came under the jurisdiction of the Bishopric of the Isles. The Hebrides were yielded to the Kingdom of Scotland as a result of the 1266 Treaty of Perth, after which time control of the islands north of Ardnamurchan was in the hands of the Earls of Ross. In addition to the name &quot;Raasay&quot; itself, placenames such as Arnish (eagle headland), &quot;Suidhisnis&quot; (seething headland) and Eyre (beach or sand spit) are a legacy of the Norse presence.

=== 15th to 17th century ===

Tradition has it that Clan MacSween originally held title to Raasay but there is no written record of this. It is known that the island was ruled by the MacLeods from 1518 when Gillecallum, younger son of the MacLeod Chief of Lewis was granted title. Martin Martin visited towards the end of the 17th century and noted:

it has some wood on all the quarters of it, the whole is fitter for pasturage than cultivation, the ground being generally very unequal, but very well watered with rivulets and springs. There is a spring running down the face of a high rock on the east side of the isle; it petrifies into a white substance, of which very fine lime is made, and there is a great quantity of it. There is a quarry of good stone on the same side of the isle; there is abundance of caves on the west side, which serve to lodge several families, who for their convenience in grazing, fishing, &amp;c., resort thither in the summer. On the west side, particularly near to the village Clachan, the shore abounds with smooth stones of different sizes, variegated all over. The same cattle, fowl, and fish are produced here that are found in the isle of Skye. There is a law observed by the natives that all their fishing lines must be of equal length, for the longest is always supposed to have best access to the fish, which would prove a disadvantage to such as might have shorter ones.
There are some forts in this isle, the highest is in the south end; it is a natural strength, and in form like the crown of a hat; it is called Dun-Cann, which the natives will needs have to be from one Canne, cousin to the king of Denmark. The other lies on the side, is an artificial fort, three stories high, and is called Castle Vreokle.
Brochel Castle, as it is more commonly known, was built by the MacSweens in the 15th century on the north-east coast of Raasay. Latterly, it became a base for the MacLeod of Lewis&#x27;s pirating activities prior to Calum Garbh&#x27;s investiture there. The castle was inhabited until the death by drowning of the Chief Iain Garbh in 1671 and is now a ruin sitting atop a pinnacle. In the meantime the Macleods moved their seat to Raasay House at the south end of the island.

=== 18th century ===
Although Protestant, the MacLeods of Raasay supported Bonnie Prince Charlie during and after the Jacobite rising of 1745. After the defeat at the Battle of Culloden, the Prince spent 2 days hiding from the British troops on Raasay. In conversation with Malcolm MacLeod of Raasay during his short stay on the island the Prince confided that although his life on the run was hard, he would rather live that way for ten years than be captured as he feared assassination. He seemed less aware of the risks his supporters ran. The atrocities perpetrated in the aftermath of Culloden were a shock to him. Of Cumberland he said: &quot;Surely that man who calls himself a duke and pretends to be so great a general cannot be guilty of such cruelties. I cannot believe it.&quot;

According to a 20 October 1752 letter to Robert Forbes by the Laird of Raasay, as a consequence of the island&#x27;s support for the Jacobite cause and for having granted hospitality to the prince, the island was subjected to scorched earth tactics during two visits in July 1746 by troops of the Campbell of Argyll Militia under the command of General John Campbell and the Royal Navy crew of the &quot;HMS Furnace&quot; under the command of Captain John Fergussone. One witness account states that the original Raasay House and many other dwellings were burnt down, all the islanders&#x27; livestock were confiscated and slaughtered, and two women were assaulted. The Laird was afterwards taken prisoner by Captain Fergussone, transported aboard the &quot;Furnace&quot; to London, and held aboard a prison hulk anchored in the River Thames. The Laird&#x27;s allegations are also confirmed by a still extant letter from Captain Fergussone to his naval superior, Commodore Thomas Smith, and by a brief entry in the &quot;HMS Furnace&quot; ship&#x27;s log, &quot;Set Raasa Isle afire.&quot;
In 1773 James Boswell and Samuel Johnson arrived on the island during their Hebridean tour. They visited Raasay House and Johnson wrote:

Our reception exceeded our expectations. We found nothing but civility, elegance, and plenty. After the usual refreshments, and the usual conversation, the evening came upon us. The carpet was then rolled off the floor; the musician was called, and the whole company was invited to dance, nor did ever fairies trip with greater alacrity. The general air of festivity, which predominated in this place, so far remote from all those regions which the mind has been used to contemplate as the mansions of pleasure, struck the imagination with a delightful surprise, analogous to that which is felt at an unexpected emersion from darkness into light.
When it was time to sup, the dance ceased, and six and thirty persons sat down to two tables in the same room. After supper the ladies sung Erse songs, to which I listened as an English audience to an Italian opera, delighted with the sound of words which I did not understand.
Boswell went exploring and described the island as follows:

Having resolved to explore the island of Rasay, which could be done only on foot, I last night obtained my fellow-traveller’s permission to leave him for a day, he being unable to take so hardy a walk. Old Mr Malcolm M’Cleod, who had obligingly promised to accompany me, was at my bedside between five and six. I sprang up immediately, and he and I, attended by two other gentlemen, traversed the country during the whole of this day. Though we had passed over not less than four-and-twenty miles of very rugged ground, and had a Highland dance on the top of Dùn Can, the highest mountain in the island, we returned in the evening not at all fatigued, and piqued ourselves at not being outdone at the nightly ball by our less active friends, who had remained at home.
My survey of Rasay did not furnish much which can interest my readers; I shall therefore put into as short a compass as I can, the observations upon it, which I find registered in my journal. It is about fifteen English miles long, and four broad. On the south side is the laird’s family seat, situated on a pleasing low spot. The old tower of three stories, mentioned by Martin, was taken down soon after 1746, and a modern house supplies its place. There are very good grass-fields and corn-lands about it, well dressed. I observed, however, hardly any inclosures, except a good garden plentifully stocked with vegetables, and strawberries, raspberries, currants, &amp;c.
=== 19th and 20th centuries ===
In 1843 the last laird, John Macleod, was deep in debt and chose to emigrate to Tasmania having sold Raasay for 35,000 guineas to George Rainy. After the Highland Potato Famine of the 1840s, the new owner decided to convert as much arable land as possible to large scale sheep farming. This required the removal of the islanders, and his solution was to ban marriage. Several townships were cleared including most of the inhabited areas of the east coast. Hallaig was emptied in 1852-54 and the ruins of at least 25 buildings remain visible. North and South Screapadal are further north and contained at least 30 buildings when still inhabited. Two boatloads of emigrants left for Portland in Australia in 1854 as a result, and another 165 left for the same destination in 1865. The estate was then sold to Edward Wood, and conflicts between the laird and the islanders grew as he decided to turn the island over to sporting purposes. Near Oskaig, there is a row of six houses which are known as Manitoba. Locals believe that this was a gathering place for people about to embark on emigrating to Canada in the late 19th century.

On 20 September 1862 the steamship &quot;Irishman&quot; ran aground on &quot;Skernataid Rock&quot; between Raasay and Scalpay. A vessel &quot;Spindrift&quot; is also recorded as having become jammed under the ferry pier at the sound end of the island and broken in two by the rising tide at an unspecified date.

William Baird and Company signed a deed to purchase the estate of the Island of Raasay on 28 December 1910. The sale completed on 15 May 1911.

In May 1921, a group of crofters from Rona landed on Raasay and attempted to re-occupy their ancestral land. These so-called &quot;Raasay Raiders&quot; were arrested, tried and given prison sentences, but public support for them was strong and they were eventually freed and allowed to remain on Raasay.

The island was purchased by the government in 1922 after the mine closed. In 1949 The Forestry Commission was granted land bringing much-needed employment, and in 1956 The North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board delivered mains electricity to the island. The power was generated by Storr Lochs Hydro-Electric Scheme, which was commissioned in 1952 and upgraded in 1956. Local residents and invited guests met at Balmeanach, on Skye, on 14 March 1956. Major General Harry Macdonald, who owned the Braes estate, operated the switch, and rockets were fired from Raasay to confirm that electricity had arrived through the undersea cable, which ran from An Aird in Braes to Suishnish. The guests were then transported to Raasay in fishing boats to complete the celebrations. In the 1960s Raasay House and various other properties were purchased by John Green, a doctor residing in Sussex who visited the island only once and whose lack of interest in it earned him the sobriquet &quot;Dr No&quot;. Having purchased the property for £8,000 he sold it to the Highlands and Islands Development Board in 1979 for £135,000.

=== The Iron Mine ===

Nicolson reported an early bloomery on the island. The next record of ironstone on Raasay was by HB Woodward in 1893. Stead investigated the outcrop in 1909 and the subsequent analysis by Tatlock convinced Baird&#x27;s to buy the island the following year (with completion in 1912).

Baird&#x27;s original plan was for a railway from the outcrop site down to just south of Suisnish point with the erection of five kilns. Objections led to the plan being revised for two kilns further south, where the current pier is. This pier was a public pier with landing charges regulated by government order. By the outbreak of war Baird&#x27;s had completed the pier (constructed by Robert McAlpine &amp; Sons), kilns, railway and &quot;other works&quot;.

To house the workforce Baird&#x27;s planned the village of Inverarish Houses, today known as Inverarish Terrace. The village consists of two facing rows of houses, each row being two terraces of 16 houses each. Between the terraces is a broad open area. Numbers 1–32 are the western row, 33–64 the eastern. The lower, southern terraces were built first (1–16 and 33–48) between 1912 and 1913. The first terraces were stone built and by 1914–15 were about half occupied. By the time of the 1915–16 valuation some of numbers 1–16 were unoccupied, just over half of numbers 33–48 were occupied and the newly built brick terrace of numbers 17–32 were also vacant. The unoccupied houses were caused by many of the labour force being called to the colours.

With the introduction of unrestricted submarine warfare in 1916 the Ministry of Munitions became concerned about the availability of foreign iron ore. Baird&#x27;s were one company amongst others which opened up domestic mines in order to supply the war effort. In May 1916 Baird&#x27;s signed an agreement to run the mine on behalf of the Ministry, although there was a minor skirmish over the amount of processing to be done on the island. This northern part of the village was converted into a prisoner-of-war camp by the simple expedient of building a barbed wire fence around it and erecting sentry boxes and arc lamps at the corners. The first prisoners were on the island by June and were housed in the upper part of the village, numbers 17–32 and the now completed 49–64. 

== Population ==

In 2001 Raasay had the lowest percentage of children of any populated Scottish island, and the island&#x27;s population fell by over 16% since that time to the date of the 2011 census. During the same period Scottish island populations as a whole grew by 4% to 103,702. With 36% in the 2001 census there was still a relatively high density of Gaelic speakers (down from over 75% in 1901 and 1921).

== Culture and the arts ==

=== Piping tradition ===
John MacKay, born on Raasay in 1767, was supported by the MacLeod Chief as the foremost island piper of his day and an inheritor of the MacCrimmon tradition. His son Angus published a collection of pibroch music in staff notation and was the first Piper to the Sovereign.

=== Sorley MacLean ===

The poet Sorley MacLean was born in Osgaig, a small crofting community on the west coast of the island; perhaps his most famous poem is about &quot;Hallaig&quot;, an abandoned community on the east coast. MacLean&#x27;s writings often combine an ancient traditional awareness, with a modernist political outlook, in which Raasay, and the areas adjacent to it are frequently referenced. But while MacLean&#x27;s work dwells on the brutality of war, of the Highland Clearances and modern exploitation, he also writes about nature. Thus, although the Clearances leave an empty landscape populated only by the ghosts of those evicted or forced to emigrate, &quot;Time, the deer, is in the Wood of Hallaig&quot;.

=== Calum&#x27;s Road ===
The two miles (3 km) of road between Brochel Castle and Arnish were built using hand-tools by Calum MacLeod over ten years. Only when complete was the road surfaced by the local council; by then Calum and his wife were the last inhabitants of Arnish. &quot;Calum&#x27;s Road&quot; has been commemorated in music both by Capercaillie on their 1988 album &quot;The Blood is Strong&quot; and by Runrig in &quot;Wall of China&quot; from the album The Stamping Ground, as well as in a book by Roger Hutchinson. The BBC Radio 4 drama &quot;Calum&#x27;s Road&quot;, based on Hutchinson&#x27;s book and dramatised by Colin MacDonald, was first broadcast on 5 October 2013 starring Ian McDiarmid as Calum MacLeod.

=== Harrison Birtwistle ===
The composer Sir Harrison Birtwistle lived on Raasay from 1975 to 1983. His &quot;Duets for Storab&quot;, takes its name from Storab, a Viking prince who was shipwrecked and sought refuge on Raasay. Birtwistle&#x27;s string quartet, &quot;The Tree of Strings&quot;, written in 2007, takes its title from a poem by Sorley MacLean.
