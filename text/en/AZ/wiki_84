<text>The Royal Lao Air Force (; – AVRL), best known to the Americans by its English acronym RLAF, was the air force component of the Royal Lao Armed Forces (FAR), the official military of the Royal Lao Government and the Kingdom of Laos during the Laotian Civil War between 1960 and 1975.

The original Lao military aviation establishment was the &#x27;Laotian Aviation&#x27; (), established by the French on 28 January 1955 as a small aerial observation and transport arm of the then National Lao Army (ANL). As the French withdrew from Indochina, the Lao Aviation was supported by American aid. With the addition of offensive capabilities, it morphed into the Royal Lao Air Force (RLAF).

The RLAF struggled into existence in the face of its enemies, while dealing with its own internal divisions as well as bucking a tide of pilot and aircraft losses. As it expanded from its 1960 foundation, and as the fighting power of the Royal Lao Army was diminished and broken during the 1960s, the RLAF came to carry the weight of the battle against Vietnamese communist invaders and local Pathet Lao insurgents. Despite its continual drain of heavy pilot and aircraft losses, the RLAF grew to the point where it flew 30,000 combat sorties annually against its enemies in the years 1970 through 1972, as well performing essential logistics duties.

The RLAF began its operations as a liaison, logistics and transport unit. Its initial stock were a melange of French and American supplied rotary-wing and fixed-wing aircraft inherited from its predecessor, Aviation Laotienne. On 9 January 1961, the new RLAF was supplied with six AT-6 Texans as its first strike aircraft. Although these were quickly lost, they were replaced by five T-28 Trojans. Despite ongoing losses, the T-28 inventory would eventually burgeon under American auspices to 75 Trojans on board in 1973. It would also acquire ten AC-47 gunships for a time. Pilot procurement for the swelling fleet would always be problematic, with the inadequate roster of Lao and Hmong pilots being filled out with Thai mercenary pilots, and a few Americans from Air America. By the time American aid was withdrawn in 1973, dooming the force, the RLAF would total 180 aircraft, both fixed wing and helicopters.

==Structure==
The RLAF, along with the Royal Lao Navy, and the Royal Lao Army, was placed under the control of the Ministry of Defense in Vientiane. The RLAF received assistance over the years from France, the US and Thailand. Initially a transport organisation beginning operations with the Morane-Saulnier MS.500 Criquet and then the C-47, it acquired a light strike capability with the North American T-6 Texan and later the T-28 Trojan.

==List of U. S. Ambassadors to Laos during the Laotian Civil War==
On 29 May 1961, President John F. Kennedy issued a directive letter to the United States Ambassador to Laos Leonard S. Unger granting Unger the authority to control &quot;...all the functions of a Military Assistance Advisory Group...&quot;.
The serving ambassador thus became a de facto commander of the Royal Lao Air Force during the Laotian Civil War; it existed only through U. S. support from 1962 through 1975.

==History==
===French beginning===
Plans to create an air wing for the Laotian National Army (ANL) were first laid by the French in May 1954. Proposed equipment consisted of French Morane-Saulnier MS.500 Criquets, de Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beavers, helicopters, as well as Douglas C-47 transports. On 6 August 1954, as Laos became independent, the departing French military lent Criquets to the ANL for artillery observation. The treaty of independence granted France the right to maintain a military training mission in Laos. Beginning on 28 January 1955, the military mission provided a staff of instructors headed by a colonel to train 200 Laotian military personnel in air operations; that same day, the Laotian Aviation () was officially founded at Wattay Airfield, near Vientiane. Its initial unit was the 1st Observation and Liaison Squadron, which served a double purpose as its Criquets were used for training Lao pilots, as well as ongoing military duties. By February 1955, it was equipped with ten Criquets delivered by the French.

Other than Wattay, available landing strips in the country consisted of rough runways at Xieng Khouang, Luang Prabang, Pakse, and the Plain of Jars. The French Air Force bequeathed four C-47s with French aircrews to the RLAF; three were repainted in RLAF insignia. The loan was conditional upon aircraft remaining in-country.

Some 6,500 Royal Lao Army troops out of its 30,000 personnel were surrounded by North Vietnamese and Pathet Lao forces. Because Laos lacked a functional road network, the RLAF&#x27;s first mission was aerial resupply of these besieged troops. The French air crews operated the transports while Laotians were being trained. The first aggressive action by the new air force was the aerial movement of Royalist troops to the Plaine de Jarres in early 1955. These Royalist ground troops on the Plaine de Jarres became part of the air bridge resupply effort. In late 1955, 22 Lao students departed to France and Morocco for aviation training. One of these cadets was Thao Ma, an ex-paratrooper who later rose to command the Royal Lao Air Force.

The French-crewed C-47s were used for this operation, in conjunction with C-46 Commandos leased from Civil Air Transport. &quot;Civilian&quot; C-47s under contract were used to drop the Royalist Paratroop Battalion in Xieng Khouang to counter Pathet Lao expansion into the province. As part of this action, Lao pilots in training flew reconnaissance missions in the Criquets. The four Sikorsky H-19 helicopters of the new air force were insufficient for such duties as medevacing the ill and wounded, so two additional H-19s were acquired from the Royal Thai Air Force in October 1955. These were supplied without markings, and were officially Thai Airways craft.

French military intelligence had set up anticommunist guerrilla units throughout northern Laos, up to and over the North Vietnamese border. However, the loaner transports were not used for logistical support of the units in North Vietnam because they were not allowed to fly internationally. Instead, the &quot;special missions&quot; were entrusted to two private charter airlines flying under contract to the Lao military–Laos Air Lines and Lao Air Transport.

In late 1956, the C-47 transports were crewed by newly trained Lao. In 1957, the last 85 French instructors left Laos. By the time of their departure, most of the Lao aircraft were grounded due to lack of maintenance.

===American takeover===
The United States of America took up the slack as the French departed, setting up the Programs Evaluation Office as a sub rosa military mission in January 1954. It supplied 100 instructors to replace the departing French mentors. It also supplied six C-47s, two DHC L-20s, and two L-19 Bird Dogs. They also began airfield construction throughout the country.

In January 1956, PEO turned over four C-47s to the Lao, in the first direct U. S. support of the fledgling air force. The PEO&#x27;s three-year development plan for Aviation Laotienne called for a transport squadron of eight C-47s, an observation squadron of 12 L-19 Bird Dogs, and a liaison squadron containing four Sikorsky H-19s and four DHC L-20 Beavers. A light strike force of twelve AT-6 Texans was also envisioned. The first six Bird Dogs arrived in March 1956, even as the last of the Criquets were scrapped.

A few more DHC L-20s were delivered in 1957; its short takeoff and landing capabilities well suited it for the primitive conditions of Laotian airstrips. One or more of these L-20s arrived with a .50 caliber machine gun still mounted; the natural use for such an armed craft was as a gunship for strafing ground targets. Also in 1957, Sourith Don Sasorith, the first Lao commander was appointed to head the Aviation Laotienne.

In July 1958, a coup brought Phoumi Nosavan to power in Laos; he subsequently requested additional aid from the United States. By the following year, PEO planned to reinforce the Lao air force with six North American T-28 Trojans. It also became apparent that the aviation support available for the Royalist government&#x27;s war against the Communists was insufficient, even when augmented by Air America contract flights. The U.S. Air Force 315th Air Division sent a detachment incountry dressed in civilian clothing on a month&#x27;s temporary duty to operate C-119G Flying Boxcars, C-123 Providers, and C-130 Hercules transports in support of the Royalists. After they flew 72 sorties, they were withdrawn on 27 April 1959 because of international political pressure.
Two French Alouette helicopters were purchased for the Lao air force in 1960. In August, Kong Le&#x27;s Neutralist paratroopers launched a coup to unseat Nosavan; once he gained power, he requested aid from North Vietnam and the Soviet Union. Three months later, Nosavan launched an American-backed countercoup from his base in Savannakhet, successfully attacking the Neutralists in Vientiane. Nosavan received aerial logistical support not only from the diminished Lao air force, but from Royal Thai Air Force H-19s and four Air American H-34s, as well as a Bird &amp; Son C-46. In addition to logistical support from these craft, Bird and Son dropped paratroopers onto Vientiane from the C-46.

In August 1960, Aviation Laotienne officially became the Royal Lao Air Force.

===Soviet air bridge===
Although the Soviet Union did not contribute directly to the development of the RLAF, its actions in 1960–1961 had a great influence on RLAF development. In response to an appeal for help from Kong Le, the Soviet Union dedicated 44 transport aircraft to support of the Neutralist forces. Beginning in December 1960, the Soviets flew in military supplies, beginning with a battery of 105 mm howitzers. Soviet pilots flew about 1,000 sorties by March 1961 in support of the Neutralists even as they withdrew northward onto the Plain of Jars. The Soviet effort included some drops of Kong Le&#x27;s paratroopers, as well as the provision of three Lisunov Li-2s to his air force. During the same time frame, the Vietnam People&#x27;s Air Force&#x27;s 919th Transport Regiment flew 184 resupply sorties from northern Vietnam into Sam Neua. The communist efforts sparked American efforts to beef up the RLAF.

When Kong Le retreated from Vientiane, he took with him two usable C-47s and two L-20 Beavers from Aviation Laotienne and formed the Neutralist Laotian Air Force. Nosavan&#x27;s offensive followed Kong Le&#x27;s forces to the Plain of Jars.

The Soviet air bridge terminated in May 1962, following the armistice of the 10th. In late 1962, a contingent of Neutralist cadets went to the Soviet Union for over a year&#x27;s aviation training. Before the Soviets departed Laos, in November and December 1962, the Soviets bequeathed three Li-2s to the Neutralists, and three Li-2s and three Antonov An-2 biplanes to the Pathet Lao air arm. It also gave three Li-2s and a Mil Mi-4 helicopter to the RLAF. However, a lack of spare parts soon began to ground these aircraft.

===American response to Soviets===
In response to the Soviet air bridge, U. S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower had his officials prompt Thailand to supply six AT-6 Texans to the RLAF as a light strike capability on 9 January 1961. In return, the Thais were compensated by the Americans with five jet Cessna T-37 Tweets. Three Lao pilots for the AT-6s were already available, including Thao Ma. The new light strike craft flew their first successful sorties on 15 January. One of the T-6s was shot down on 17 January 1961. The RLAF augmented its pilots&#x27; ranks with four volunteer Thai pilots from the Royal Thai Air Force&#x27;s 63rd Squadron, who began flying missions by mid February. Most of the remaining T-6s became casualties in March, with two colliding in midair, one falling to ground fire, and another lost on a training flight. The RLAF was temporarily nearly wiped out.

During March and April 1961, in an abortive attempt to beef up RLAF firepower, 18 U. S. Air Force officers volunteered for discharge and entry into Operation Millpond. These pilots were commissioned into the RLAF so they could fly Douglas A-26 Invader bombers in Laos. They were augmented by four Air America pilots. However, political considerations in the wake of the Bay of Pigs Invasion precluded use of the Invaders.

The United States began its own air bridge in April 1961, as well as photographic reconnaissance efforts. RLAF transport capacity was augmented to 13 C-47s, and were used for the RLAF&#x27;s first significant airlift when they carried three battalions of Royal Lao troops to Sam Neua. The U. S. also supplied ten more AT-6s for ground attack missions to the RLAF via the medium of the Thai air force. During a four plane sortie by AT-6s flown from Luang Prabang&#x27;s airfield during April 1961, Lieutenant Khampanh of the RLAF downed a Soviet Ilyushin Il-4 of its air bridge fleet, using unguided missiles to do so. This was the RLAF&#x27;s sole air-to-air victory. However, shortcomings of the aging AT-6s were becoming apparent to the U. S. and T-28s being retired by the Republic of Vietnam Air Force were earmarked for the RLAF, but not delivered because of the truce.

On 2 May 1961, the communists overran the airfield at Moung Sing; the following day, they captured an RLAF C-47 that landed because its crew was unaware of the communist takeover.

The upshot of infantry clashes on the Plain of Jars was a directive from U.S. President John F. Kennedy in May 1961 that the U.S. Ambassador to Laos would serve as the &quot;de facto&quot; military commander in Laos. His approval was needed for all air strikes in country. The Air Attaché&#x27;s office served as his staff for employment of air power in Laos.

10 May 1962 armistice limited RLAF operations, with the T-6s becoming non-operational, although Lao aviation cadets were forwarded to Lopburi, Thailand for T-28 training in June 1962. However, during the truce, Vang Pao used his CIA supported Hmong army of hilltribesmen to begin grubbing out short landing strips to be used for logistical support of his troops by helicopters and STOL aircraft. These tiny primitive air strips would proliferate throughout Laos and became a major component of the Royalist war effort; they would eventually be approximately 200 of these so-called Lima Sites. They would be essential for resupply, quick aerial movement of troops, and refugee relief operations.

The International Agreement on the Neutrality of Laos was signed on 23 July 1962, and went into effect in October. On 6 October 1962, the last of the American Military Advisory Group departed Laos in conformance with the Agreement. The following day, 40 Vietnamese communists having been repatriated out of the 7,000 known to have been in Laos, the North Vietnamese proclaimed they had honored the Agreement. Lip service to observing the Agreement would shape the entire American effort to organize and operate the RLAF, with all the American technicians and advisors accredited under diplomatic cover as military attachés. Although America would continue to support its Lao clients, it would also maintain the facade of observing the 1962 agreement.

===Expansion===

By the time fighting broke out again in Laos, the RLAF had five T-28 pilots trained at Moody Air Force Base, Georgia to fly the T-28s that were supplied in July and August 1963 to Wattay Airfield outside Vientiane. The United States also supplied the RLAF with bombs and rockets, although temporarily withholding fuses as a means of control.

One of the &quot;new&quot; T-28s soon crashed in Vientiane due to a failed coup. Another T-28 disappeared from inventory when Lieutenant Chert Saibory, who had defected from the RTAF to the RLAF, defected once more in September 1963. He flew his T-28 into North Vietnam, where he was imprisoned. Despite this, on 26 October 1963 the U. S. State Department cabled Ambassador Unger with clearance to use the T-28s to intercept North Vietnamese supply flights to the Pathet Lao. Unger was the first of three ambassadors to control the American air assets supplied to the RLAF; the others were his successors, William H. Sullivan and G. McMurtrie Godley.

Operation Waterpump was set up in Thailand to train more Lao pilots in March 1964. It consisted of 38 Air Commandos and four T-28D trainers stationed at Udorn Royal Thai Air Force Base. Also in March 1964, Ambassador Unger lobbied his State Department for an expanded role for the RLAF. The RLAF flew its first T-28 strike missions directed at communists on the Plain of Jars on 17 May 1964. Unger released the embassy&#x27;s ordnance inventory to the RLAF that same day. Operation Waterpump also forwarded its four T-28s to the RLAF. Two days later, ten surplus T-28s arrived from South Vietnam; four were retained by Waterpump so it could resume training operations while the other six were passed on to the RLAF. To bridge the pilot shortage until Waterpump graduated Lao pilots, the American Programs Evaluation Office covertly recruited five volunteer pilots from Air America, dubbing them the &quot;A Team&quot;. They flew their first strike on 25 May 1964; two of the T-28s were damaged by antiaircraft fire while missing their target. Because of the possibility of political fallout if an American pilot should fall into enemy hands, PEO brought in Thai pilots from the RTAF&#x27;s 223rd Squadron on six-month tours of duty, in a classified operation known as Project Firefly. These recruited mercenaries were known as the &quot;B Team&quot;, and began flying strike missions on 1 June 1964. To complete the team designations, Lao pilots were designated as the &quot;C Team&quot;. The A and B Teams were under control of Ambassador Unger.

By June 1964, when the strategic road junction of Highways 7 and 13 was threatened by communist forces, the RLAF had 20 T-28s and 13 Lao pilots ready for action. Ten more Lao pilot cadets were nearing the end of their training, and were to be available on 9 August 1964. Ten Thai and six American pilots were also available for immediate duty with the RLAF. Four additional T-28s were available at Udorn. Fifteen additional T-28s were becoming available from the Republic of Vietnam Air Force, which was re-equipping with A-1 Skyraiders.

Also during June 1964, a flight of A Team T-28s bombed Kong Le&#x27;s Neutralist headquarters at Khang Khay in a successful attempt to make him switch his alliance from the Pathet Lao to side with the Royalists. As a followup, the A Team also attacked the Chinese Cultural Center on the Plain of Jars; the Center was reputedly a Chinese-staffed training camp for Lao communist troops.

During July 1964, American forward air control efforts to guide both RLAF and USAF air strikes began with a detachment of combat controllers mounted in Air America aircraft temporarily covertly imported for the operation.

The threat posed by North Vietnamese antiaircraft fire escalated steadily in northern Laos. This led to the assignment of the more experienced B Team Thai pilots to missions in northern Laos, with the less experienced Lao pilots flying their strike missions into southern Laos. The RLAF was now operating from Pakse and Savannakhet, as well as Luang Prabang and Vientiane.

===American/Vietnam War===
America officially entered the Vietnam War as a result of the Gulf of Tonkin incident on 4 August 1964. There was a prompt escalation of RLAF activities and losses as a result. Ambassador Unger pressured the RLAF to strike communist forces on the Plain of Jars and the Ho Chi Minh trail by presenting the Royalist government with a list of targets that he wanted the RLAF to hit. Losses escalated. A T-28 was shot down by Vietnamese 37 mm anti-aircraft guns on 14 August. On 18 August 1964, Lieutenant Colonel Viripong, commander of the RTAF&#x27;s 223rd Squadron, went down in an RLAF T-28 on the Plain of Jars while on an unauthorized mission, while another T-28 was lost in North Vietnam.

Covert American air activities during this time span expanded to include U. S. forward air control pilots in the 
Steve Canyon Program, who directed the air strikes. On 30 September, the American Joint Chiefs of Staff approved a list of targets in eastern Laos suggested by the U. S. Air Force. Lao Prime Minister Souvanna Phouma concurred. On 14 October 1964, Thao Ma led three flights of RLAF T-28s from Savannakhet in the initial air raid against the Mụ Giạ Pass, the northern terminus of the Ho Chi Minh trail.

In January 1965, an ordnance accident at Wattay Airbase caused the loss of eight RLAF T-28s and a C-47. The losses greatly reduced the operations of the Thai B Team pilots until May. In that month, the RLAF scored its first victories over tanks, destroying two, along with five trucks. It was during this time period that Ambassador Sullivan saw that the burgeoning bombing effort needed to be regulated. Superseding prior policy, he established a forward air control system of airborne American forward air controllers, Thai forward air guides, and Lao observers to approve air strikes. The increased control made close air support of ground troops by the RLAF B Team possible; American fighter bombers had to be guided by a T-28 strike. However, for interdiction sorties, Sullivan was the final authority except for road reconnaissance missions hitting fleeting targets of opportunity.

Summer 1965 marked the beginning of internal dissension within RLAF ranks. The charismatic aggressive commander of the RLAF, General Thao Ma, evoked jealousy from other Royalist generals. There was a purported assassination attempt against Thao Ma on 3 July 1965.

In mid-1965, the American &quot;civilian&quot; aviation specialists secretly supplied to the Royalist government were organized into Air Operation Centers. An Air Operation Center was established in each of Laos&#x27; five military regions, with the personnel being recruited via the U. S. Air Force&#x27;s Palace Dog program. On both 1 and 2 August 1965, RLAF B Team T-28s struck North Vietnam; on the 18th, a T-28 on a similar raid was shot down, and cross border attacks by the RLAF were suspended.

By August 1965, RLAF sortie rate had drastically increased as attack aircraft inventory had built up to 24 T-28s, augmented by 3 RT-28s and several C-47s. The latter were used as improvised gunships/bombers, being armed with 0.50 caliber machine guns and equipped with a roller system to trundle 250 pound bombs out the cargo door during flight. This successful field expedient was eventually cancelled however, as it interfered with opium smuggling activities by some of the Royal Lao high command.

In October 1965, cross border raids against communist munition depots in North Vietnam resumed for a short time before being permanently terminated. November 1965 saw the arrival of five U. S. Army O-1E Bird Dogs for use by the Raven Forward Air Controllers directing the RLAF. Late 1965 also saw the acquisition of three more C-47s by the RLAF. Two Lao army generals tried to lay claim to them, but were fended off by Thao Ma; he believed the planes would be used for smuggling instead of military transport. The generals retaliated by limiting promotions within the RLAF, and thus undermining Thao Ma.

By Spring 1966, the RLAF had grown to 40 T-28s. Thai B Team pilots continued to be crucial to RLAF operation, with 23 arriving in Laos in early 1966. Also, in an effort to increase the pool of T-28 pilots, the CIA began training several dozen Hmong pilot candidates in Thailand. Seven of them would graduate as T-28 pilots; others would become transport or liaison pilots; a few would become helicopter pilots. Washouts from the program were repurposed as aerial observers, often flying with the Raven FACs.

The chief of staff of the RLAF was bribed to lead a mutiny against Thao Ma. In retaliation, on 4 June 1966, Thao Ma launched an unsuccessful insurrection. In the wake of this failed revolt, a Military Transport Command was founded and placed under Brigadier-General Sourith Don Sasorith, although Thao Ma continued to command the T-28s.
After this unsuccessful coup, General Thao Ma transferred his headquarters from Savannakhet to Luang Prabang. He was slated to be demoted into a newly created desk job in Vientiane. He flew combat missions from Luang Prabang until 22 October 1966, when he once again attempted a coup. He launched a flight of eight T-28s on a raid against the home of several opposing Royalist generals in Vientiane, as well as the General Staff headquarters and two munitions depots. Although 36 people were killed by the air strikes, the coup was unsuccessful. The American ambassador intervened to halt the coup. Thao Ma and ten of his pilots flew their T-28s into exile in Thailand. Several dozen RLAF technicians also absconded on a C-47. With Thao Ma&#x27;s departure, General Sourith ascended to command of the entire RLAF.

By 9 November 1966, Operation Waterpump had graduated 42 new Lao T-28 pilots. However, because of defections and casualties, only 24 still remained on the RLAF rolls. In an attempt to project RLAF needs into the future, Ambassador William H. Sullivan predicted that perhaps seven defecting Lao pilots could be recovered from Thailand, and that six more Lao pilot cadets were about to graduate from training. Sullivan foresaw a need for 55 to 60 Lao pilots to man 44 to 48 T-28s. He noted the importance of having T-28 pilots with a common language with Lao ground troops, for whom the RLAF flew close air support. Until a sufficient number of Lao pilots had been trained, Thai pilots, whose language was akin to Lao, would fill the close air support role, leaving U. S. Air Force planes free to strike interdiction targets. By the end of 1966, over half of the year&#x27;s combat sorties had been flown by B Team pilots. The B Team pilots had begun using Muang Soui as an advanced base near the Plain of Jars, cutting their sortie time and raising their sortie rate.

===Under General Sourith===
In early 1967, North Vietnamese sappers struck the Luang Prabang airfield on two occasions, destroying 17 RLAF T-28s.

From 20 to 27 May 1967, the RLAF joined the U. S. Air Force in the second series of air strikes directed against Route 110 of the Sihanouk Trail in southern Laos. The RLAF contributed 41 sorties to the effort.

Unlike Ma, General Sourith countenanced gold and opium smuggling using RLAF transports. However, beginning at noon on 30 July 1967, Sourith directed two days of RLAF T-28 air strikes on a smuggler&#x27;s caravan of 300 mules carrying 16 tons of opium that entered western Laos from Burma at Ban Khwan.

During the end of 1967, seven RLAF T-28s flew support for Royalist troops engaged in the Battle of Nam Bac; unfortunately, a lack of air-ground coordination rendered the air strikes ineffective. RLAF logistical support of ground troops via helicopter also proved inadequate. In the wake of the disastrous defeat at Nam Bac in early 1968, the Royal Lao Army became ineffective, increasing the combat burden on the RLAF. The air arm was augmented to 45 to 50 T-28s, with 25 to 30 additional ones held in reserve in Thailand. The RLAF also had on strength nine UH-34s helicopters and 16 C-47s.

In February 1968, the RLAF suffered a serious loss, when a flight of three T-28s on a close air support mission in poor weather flew headlong into a ridge in Military Region 2. There were no survivors. In another demoralizing incident, on 21 March 1968, a RLAF C-47 crew was arrested at Tan Son Nhut Air Base, Vietnam for smuggling gold and opium. Subsequently, Ambassador Sullivan declined to supply five more C-47s to the RLAF, on the grounds they would be used for smuggling.

By June 1968, because of T-28 losses, pilot losses, and resultant low morale, RLAF tactical air was diminished to flying its lowest sortie rate in four years. The &quot;civilian&quot; aviation specialists supplied from the USAF were increased to ten per Air Operations Center, taking charge of all T-28 support functions for a gain in short term efficiency. As a result, RLAF strike sorties for December tripled over January&#x27;s score, totaling 1,522 missions. By year&#x27;s end, the RLAF T-28s had flown approximately 10,000 combat sorties. By contrast, the RLAF&#x27;s transport C-47s were still brazenly misused for opium and gold smuggling, and chartered out as civilian airliners.

In 1969, the RLAF&#x27;s advisors started a couple of programs aimed at raising the T-28 pilots&#x27; morale. Most immediate was a combat pay bonus paid for every strike sortie flown. Escape and evasion training was also offered in Hua Hin, Thailand; it also doubled as seaside R&amp;R. However, with no stand-down, operations continued. On 27 June 1969, the advanced RLAF base at Muang Soui was overrun by North Vietnamese sappers and infantry. On 11 July 1969, the most famous of the RLAF&#x27;s Hmong pilots, Captain Lee Lue, was shot down and killed after flying over 1,000 combat sorties in less than 18 months. Between April and September 1969, the first two Lao forward air controllers were trained. In late 1969, the Hmong mercenaries on the ground, supported by RLAF and U. S. air strikes, recaptured most of the Plain of Jars. The first three AC-47 Spooky gunships were received from the U. S. and Vietnamese Air Forces, and the first missions flown on 5 September. There were teething problems–air crews were expected to fly C-47s by day as well as AC-47s at night; gunners burned out guns; munitions were fired just for resale value of the brass; Vang Pao was initially reluctant to employ them for fear of friendly casualties. The experience of the pilots helped though; for instance, Captain Khamphanh (of the air-to-air victory) had logged over 7,000 flying hours. Nevertheless, the three Spookies soon proved their worth and began averaging about 50 nocturnal combat sorties per month.

By January 1970, the People&#x27;s Republic of China had taken advantage of a pre-existing treaty to build a highway south from Yunnan Province through western Laos toward the Thai/Lao border. The Chinese dispatched a truck convoy southwards on that road. As it was approaching Pak Beng, it came under air attack by two B Team T-28s of the RLAF, with 15 trucks destroyed. Further air assaults on that road were deterred, however, by the stationing of 400 antiaircraft guns of various calibers along its length.

In March 1970, the North Vietnamese again attacked on the Plain of Jars. A few days later, on 18 March, an advanced RLAF air base at Sam Thong was overrun. In the fighting on the Plain des Jarres, the RLAF lost three T-28Ds, plus two O-1 and one U-17 light aircraft. The need for air power became so desperate that Air America C-7 Caribous were used as makeshift bombers, dropping barrels of napalm on the invading Vietnamese. Communist forces pushed close enough to the RLAF bases at Muang Soui and Long Tieng that combat sortie time dwindled enough that one Hmong T-28 pilot flew 31 missions in a single day.

The effects of the Vietnamization effort of 1970 carried over into Laos. An expanded training program for Lao T-28 pilots was begun. The B Team program was ended on 4 September 1970 as the supply of Lao pilots finally caught up to demand, the Thais having supplied ten drafts of pilots to the RLAF. A Combined Operations Center under Colonel Bouathong Phontivongsa coordinated air activities with the Army General Staff. The RLAF T-28s flew a greater proportion of their missions under Forward Air Control. However, the RLAF faced some major problems. Pilot mortality was one, with T-28 pilots surviving only an average of 20 months in combat. Also, by August 1970, smuggling had evolved to the point where 70 tons of M16 rifles and other ordnance were exchanged with the Nationalist Chinese for opium at Ban Houayxay. Another weak point, never really solved, was the dearth of qualified Lao maintenance and logistics personnel. An attempt to solve the shortage was made when all the RLAF T-28s were released from U. S. control to the RLAF, with an expanded training program being run, however middle management plus command and control skills were weak in the RLAF. Nevertheless, T-28 combat missions had reached the 30,000 sortie level by year&#x27;s end. A Rand Corporation study characterized RLAF performance as outstanding, noting that some RLAF pilots had flown over 1,000 combat sorties to date.

In May 1971, the RLAF base at Pakse was threatened by communist troops, so its T-28s were moved back into Thailand to Ubon Royal Thai Air Force Base. However, on 11 June, the eight available T-28s flew 88 destructive sorties against attacking Vietnamese communists, with one pilot notching up 14 missions.

In July 1971, the RLAF AC-47 squadron had been brought up to its authorized strength of 10 planes. However, the squadron soon suffered a serious loss when its commanding officer, Colonel Thao Ly, was shot down in flames.

By December 1971, the RLAF faced a fresh threat. North Vietnamese attacks into the Plain of Jars were supported by an air cover of Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21 fighters, forcing a temporary withdrawal of the RLAF. However, RLAF T-28s and AC-47s soon returned to action, flying from Long Tieng. Although operating off an airstrip menaced by intruding tanks and under occasional 130mm shell fire, the RLAF continued to strike the enemy. Many of the T-28 bombing sorties flown were only minutes in duration, because the enemy was so close. Combat sorties for the year amounted to about 30,000.

In late 1972, General Vang Pao launched his final offensive, trying once again to retake the Plain of Jars. RLAF tactical air had by now gone beyond the close air support mission to serve as flying artillery; for example, it was tasked with flying up to 80 daily sorties in advance of Vang Pao&#x27;s Task Force Delta advance, beginning 24 August. The shortcomings of this approach became apparent on 9 September, when a bad drop by a T-28 inflicted 80 casualties on friendly ground troops and smashed their advance on the enemy.
RLAF and Air America UH-34 copters joined USAF CH-53s and eight Air America C-47s in a huge offensive airlift of Vang Pao&#x27;s troops. After a month, the offensive stalled in a welter of miscoordination among the three air fleets. Also, by the end of 1972, the American drawdown of the Vietnam War effort began to affect the RLAF. However, the yearly combat sortie total remained at about 30,000.

===Under General Bouathong===
General Bouathong moved from command of the Combined Operations Center to overall command of the RLAF in 1973. By early 1973, the RLAF&#x27;s strength reached its zenith, with 2,150 personnel and 180 aircraft. The aircraft inventory included 75 AT-28s and eight AC-47s for combat use. Transport and light aircraft encompassed 15 O-1 Birddogs and 18 C-47s. The Americans decided to hand over some excess aircraft at the last moment, to augment the RLAF. The RLAF helicopter inventory was augmented by 24 UH-34s from the Vietnamese Air Force, bringing the total to 43, in an attempt to replace Air America&#x27;s lift capacity as it departed Laos. Air America gave the RLAF ten Cessna T-41 Mescalero trainers and ten C-123K transports. General Bouathong plead in vain for newer and more sufficient aircraft, but was refused by the Americans. In that same month, January 1973, the RLAF flew 4,482 sorties before an armistice was signed on the 22nd.

In April 1973, the armistice was breached, and the RLAF resumed combat operations. However, it was a force in decline, as its available T-28s dwindled to 40 and its monthly sortie rate declined to about 2,000. Two of the eight Spooky gunships were removed from action; the remainder were then disarmed and reverted to transports.

On 20 August 1973, General Thao Ma led a convoy of 60 truckloads of troops back into Laos and conquered Wattay Air Base. He and six other Lao pilots launched in T-28s and reprised an attempt at an aerial coup by bombing the government headquarters. However, a Royal Lao Army counter-attack recaptured Wattay, and Ma was shot down while landing. Although he survived the crashlanding, he was promptly executed.

By mid-1974, Air America wrapped up its operations in Laos. The American supply line was nearly closed. Starved of fuel, spares, and munitions, the RLAF rapidly wasted away. The Combined Operations Center was closed. Out country training of personnel ceased. Soon, the RLAF pilots were flying a mere two hours per month.

On 14 April 1975, the RLAF flew its final combat sortie. At Vang Pao&#x27;s command, nine T-28s struck a column of Pathet Lao trucks moving south into Vientiane, causing heavy casualties. The following month, as Communist agitators fomented mass demonstrations against the Royal Lao Government, many RLAF pilots defected to Thailand. Sixteen T-28s that they took were later handed on to the Philippine Air Force.

===Aftermath===
The Lao People&#x27;s Liberation Army Air Force found itself short of trained personnel to operate its expanded inventory of aircraft against the continuing Hmong insurgency. Ex-RLAF T-28s were used to bomb Hmong villages. Imprisoned RLAF pilots were released to fly for the new government. Between 1975 and 1977, there were nine defections by them into Thailand. The LPLAAF thus lost two of its 29 T-28s; four UH-34 helicopters, a C-47, a T-41, and an Antonov AN-2 also made the trip south, with the latter being returned.

===Aviation school===
A flying school was first established by the French at Wattay Air Base in January 1955 to train Laotian pilot cadets, later transferred to Seno Air Base and placed under the control of the RLAF&#x27;s Air Training Command – ATC ( – CEA), being re-designated the RLAF Pilot Training School ( – EEP). 
The school&#x27;s own curriculum included flight instruction, navigation training, combat tactics, aircraft systems training and other technical instruction to Laotian pilots for various aircraft types used by the RLAF, including helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft. The training programs aimed to develop the skills and proficiency of Laotian pilots in operating and flying their assigned aircraft effectively and were often assisted by U.S. military advisors and instructors, who provided expertise in flight operations, maintenance, and other areas.

==Uniforms and insignia==
The Royal Laotian Air Force owed its origin and traditions to the French Far East Airforces ( – FAEO) of the First Indochina War, and even after the United States took the role as the main foreign sponsor for the Royal Laotian Armed Forces at the beginning of the 1960s, French military influence was still perceptible in their uniforms and insignia.

===Service dress===
Upon its formation at the mid-1950s, Laotian Aviation personnel received the French Army&#x27;s M1945 tropical working and service dress (), standard issue in the ANL, consisting of a light khaki cotton shirt and pants. Modelled after the WWII U.S. Army tropical &quot;Chino&quot; working dress, the shirt had two patch breast pockets closed by clip-cornered straight flaps and shoulder straps whilst the trousers featured two pleats at the front hips, side slashed pockets and an internal pocket at the back, on the right side. In alternative, the short-sleeved M1946 () – which had two pleated patch breast pockets closed by pointed flaps – and the &quot;Chino&quot;-style M1949 () khaki shirts could be worn with the matching M1946 khaki shorts () in hot weather. Laotian Aviation ground personnel in the field often wore the standard ANL French all-arms M1947 drab green fatigues ().

Laotian Aviation officers wore the standard ANL summer service dress uniform in light khaki cotton, which was patterned after the French Army M1946/56 khaki dress uniform (); for formal occasions, a light summer version in white cotton was also issued. The open-collar jacket had two pleated breast pockets closed by pointed flaps and two unpleated at the side closed by straight ones whilst the sleeves had false turnbacks; the front fly and pocket flaps were secured by gilt buttons. The uniform was worn with a matching Khaki shirt and black tie on service dress whereas the white version was worn with a white shirt and a black tie instead.

Reflecting the increasing American influence, a new set of distinctive uniforms was introduced for the RLAF in 1964. Officers received a blue-grey overseas dress uniform, consisting of a tunic and slacks whose cut was modelled after the U.S. Air Force M1947 service dress. The American-style open-collar, four-buttoned tunic had two pleated breast pockets closed by scalloped flaps and two built-in pockets at the side closed by straight flaps. The front fly and pocket flaps were secured by silver buttons bearing the standard FAR wreathed trident emblem. On active service, the blue-grey dress uniform was worn with a light blue shirt and blue-grey tie, replaced on formal occasions by a white shirt and black tie; a short-sleeved light blue shirt was worn on hot weather. 
Light blue and blue-grey work uniforms were also issued to RLAF ground and flight personnel, which consisted of a light cotton shirt and pants. The former was based on the French Army&#x27;s M1948 shirt () which featured a six-buttoned front and two pleated breast pockets closed by pointed flaps, was provided with shoulder straps () and had long sleeves with buttoned cuffs. It was worn with matching trousers similar to the French M1945/52 pattern (), which had two pleats at the front hips, side slashed pockets and an internal pocket at the back, on the right side.

Despite occasional attempts at standardization, a great deal of latitude was noted in flight clothing; on combat missions RLAF aircrews relied on an inconsistent American-run supply system supplemented by items purchased during training in Thailand. Although U.S. Olive Green (OG) flight suits were provided, Laotian pilots often wore commercial black and camouflage flight suits or standard issue Royal Lao Army (RLA) OG and camouflage combat jungle fatigues in lieu, usually with a US Air Force survival mesh vest. RLAF ground personnel adopted in the 1960s U.S. Army OG-107 utilities, followed in 1971 by the M1967 Jungle Utility Uniform. Olive green U.S. M-1951 field jackets were also issued to all-ranks.

====Headgear====
Laotian Aviation officers received the ANL service peaked cap in both light khaki and white-topped versions, which was copied after the French M1927 pattern () to wear with either the light khaki or white service dress uniforms. The peaked caps were worn with the standard gilt metal ANL cap device, a wreathed &quot;Airavata&quot; crest bearing the Laotian Royal Arms (&quot;Erawan&quot;) – a three-headed white elephant standing on a pedestal and surmounted by a pointed parasol – set on a black teardrop-shaped background patch.
Ground and flight personnel generally wore the standard ANL and CEFEO headgear of the period, which consisted of French M1946 and M1957 light khaki sidecaps ( and ), M1946 &quot;Gourka&quot; tropical berets (), M1949 bush hats () and light khaki cotton baseball cap-style field caps.
In 1964, the RLAF adopted a new blue-grey service peaked cap with crown of &quot;Germanic&quot; shape – very similar to that worn by the Royal Lao Army (RLA) or Republic of Vietnam Air Force (VNAF) officers –, with a gold cord chinstrap and plain black leather peak for flag officers whereas the general officers&#x27; version had gold embroidered flame decoration on both the black cap band and peak and a gold braid chinstrap. It was initially worn with the standard gilt metal FAR wreathed trident cap device set on a black background, replaced after 1967 by a distinctive RLAF silver cap badge. A blue-grey overseas flight cap (with silver cord piping in the flap for officers), styled after the French M1957 sidecap, was also adopted. 
Besides regulation headgear, unofficial Olive Green and camouflage cloth berets, baseball caps and U.S. Boonie hats found their way into the RLAF from the United States, Thailand and South Vietnam, to which were soon added Laotian-made copies; a red embroidered baseball cap was given to graduate pilots of the T-28 fighter-bomber course held at the RLAF Flying School in Seno Airbase, near Savannakhet.

====Footwear====
White and brown low laced leather shoes were prescribed to wear with either the earlier ANL khaki service/work uniform or the white summer dress for all-ranks; after 1964 black shoes were required for RLAF officers wearing the new blue-grey officers&#x27; dress uniform on formal occasions.
Laotian Aviation personnel in the field initially wore a mixture of American and French regulation footwear, including brown leather U.S. M-1943 Combat Service Boots, French M1917 brown leather hobnailed ankle boots (), French M1953 brown leather &quot;Rangers&quot; () and French canvas-and-rubber Pataugas tropical boots, replaced by sandals while in garrison. 
Black leather combat boots began to be provided to the RLAF in the 1960s by the Americans, who issued both the early U.S. Army M-1962 &quot;McNamara&quot; model and the M-1967 model with &quot;ripple&quot; pattern rubbler sole. A few Laotian pilots and senior officers managed to acquire the U.S. Army Jungle boot, a highly prized item not issued to the RLAF whilst local copies of the Canadian Bata tropical boots and the South Vietnamese black canvas-and-rubber Indigenous Combat Boots were worn by some ground personnel.

===Air Force ranks===
Initially, the Laotian Aviation wore the same rank insignia as their French and ANL counterparts, whose sequence followed closely the French Air Force pattern defined by the 1956 regulations. Junior officers () ranks were worn on black removable shoulder boards () or shoulder strap slides () similar to the Army pattern, with the addition of a pair of stylized wings on the inner end. NCOs () and airmen () wore metal or cloth chevrons on both upper sleeves or pinned to the chest.

In 1959, the Royal Lao Army adopted a new distinctively Laotian-designed system of military ranks, which became in September 1961 the standard rank chart for all branches of service of the newly created Royal Lao Armed Forces. Under the new regulations, RLAF officers were now entitled to wear on their service or dress uniforms stiffened shoulder boards edged with gold braid identical to the standard RLA pattern, except that the background colour was blue-grey instead of red. Junior officers added an appropriate number of five-pointed gold stars to their boards whilst NCOs wore chevrons on the upper sleeve. Airmen wore no insignia. However, these regulations were slowly implemented, and for a time U.S. Air Force rank insignia were worn by RLAF personnel as an interim measure.

On active service, Laotian Aviation officers had their shoulder boards initially replaced by either shoulder strap slides or a single chest tab () buttoned or pinned to the shirt&#x27;s front fly following French Army practice. By the late 1960s the RLAF adopted the same American-style system as their RLA counterparts, in which metal pin-on or embroidered cloth rank insignia – either in yellow-on-green full-colour or black-on-green subdued form – were worn on the right collar of flight suits and jungle fatigues.

===Rank insignia===


===Insignia===
A metal pilot&#x27;s qualification badge was created in the mid-1960s, in two classes. It was identical to the U.S. Air Force wings, except for the letters &quot;RLAF&quot; stamped across the top of the central crest. The badge was worn over the left breast pocket on service dress and working uniforms, whilst an embroidered white version on a blue cloth background was worn on flight suits. Blue and subdued nametapes were occasionally worn above the right shirt or jacket pocket on field dress and flight suits; blue plastic nameplates were worn with the working and dress uniforms. Full-colour embroidered, woven or printed squadron insignia went over the right breast; RLAF service insignia – a winged lotus leaf rosette – went on the right collar. RLAF pilots sent for training in Thailand wore on the right shoulder a Laotian national emblem with &quot;Laos&quot; tab.

<text>Birmingham Snow Hill, also known as Snow Hill station, is a railway station in Birmingham City Centre. It is one of the three main city-centre stations in Birmingham, along with and .

Snow Hill was once the main station of the Great Western Railway in Birmingham and, at its height, it rivalled New Street station with competitive services to destinations including , , , Wales and South West England. The station has been rebuilt several times since the first station at Snow Hill, a temporary wooden structure, was opened in 1852; it was rebuilt as a permanent station in 1871 and then rebuilt again on a much grander scale during 1906–1912. The electrification of the main line from London to New Street in the 1960s saw New Street favoured over Snow Hill, most of whose services were withdrawn in the late 1960s. This led to the station&#x27;s eventual closure in 1972 and its demolition five years later. After fifteen years of closure, a new Snow Hill station, the present incarnation, was built; it reopened in 1987.

Today, most of the trains using Snow Hill are local services on the Snow Hill Lines, operated by West Midlands Railway, serving , , , and . The only long-distance service using Snow Hill is to and from , operated by Chiltern Railways via the Chiltern Main Line.

The present Snow Hill station has three platforms for National Rail trains. When it was originally reopened in 1987, it had four, but one was later converted in 1999 for use as a terminus for West Midlands Metro trams on the line from Wolverhampton. This tram terminus closed in October 2015, in order for the extension of the West Midlands Metro through Birmingham city centre to be connected; this included a dedicated embankment for trams alongside the station and included a new through stop serving Snow Hill. This platform is due to be returned to heavy rail use.

==History==

===Early history===
The site of the station was formerly occupied by Oppenheim&#x27;s Glassworks. This was demolished, but many parts of the building and machinery are believed to be buried underneath the station and car park, and during recent development work alongside the station the area was designated as a site of archaeological importance by Birmingham City Council. The station was opened in 1852 on the Great Western Railway (GWR) main line from to and . Originally called Birmingham Station, its name was changed to Great Charles Street station, and then Livery Street Station. It was finally renamed Snow Hill in 1858, and the Great Western Hotel was added in 1863.


It was never intended to be the main station, but the railway was prevented from reaching its original intended terminus at Curzon Street; London and North Western Railway&#x27;s engineer Robert Stephenson and solicitor Samuel Carter argued in Parliament that there would be safety risks in rival companies sharing the congested connection into their station. The original station was a simple temporary wooden structure, consisting of a large wooden shed covering the platforms. In 1871 it was rebuilt, and replaced with a permanent structure. The 1871 station had two through platforms, and bay platforms at the Wolverhampton end, covered by an arched roof. Access to the station was from Livery Street from the side. Trains from the south arrived through Snow Hill Tunnel, built by the cut-and-cover method, and in a cutting from Temple Row to Snow Hill. The cutting was roofed over in 1872 and the Great Western Arcade built on top.

To cope with expanding traffic. Snow Hill station was rebuilt again on a much larger scale between 1906 and 1912. The new station building was intended to compete with New Street. The rebuilt station contained lavish facilities, such as a large booking hall with an arched glass roof, and lavish waiting rooms with oak bars. The main platform area was covered by a large glass and steel overall roof. It consisted of two large Island platforms, containing four through platforms, and four bay platforms for terminating trains at the northern end. The through platforms were long enough to accommodate two trains at a time, and scissors crossings allowed trains to pull in front, or out from behind of other trains stood in a platform, effectively creating a 12 platform station. The line north from Snow Hill towards Hockley was quadrupled at the same time, however the cost of widening the twin track Snow Hill tunnel at the southern end was considered prohibitive. There was not enough capacity through the tunnel to accommodate all of the services, and so, as a solution, was built as an &quot;overflow&quot; station at the opposite end of the tunnel to take terminating local trains towards Leamington Spa and Stratford-upon-Avon. The Great Western Hotel was closed at the same time (as guests complained of being kept awake by goods trains running underneath) and converted into railway offices, and a passenger entrance was provided on Colmore Row, which became the station&#x27;s main entrance.

====Historic services====
At its height, many trains that now run into New Street station ran into Snow Hill, along with some that no longer run. Services included:

*  – service transferred to New Street in 1967, and later abandoned altogether. The London service was restored in the early 1990s, but now to London Marylebone - making this Snow Hill&#x27;s only long-distance service.
* , and  – The branch from Snow Hill to Dudley was closed in 1964, and the service to Wolverhampton Low Level was one of the last to survive, ending in 1972. A Snow Hill-Wolverhampton service was resumed in 1999, when the Midland Metro tram line, which now runs along the former route to Wolverhampton was opened, although this does not serve the former Low Level station, instead leaving the former trackbed and running on-street to a terminus at .
* via Wolverhampton, , Wrexham and  – this was on the old GWR route from London Paddington. British Railways ended this service before closing Snow Hill in 1967.
* Mid Wales via Shrewsbury – these trains now run into New Street (although it is now possible to join a train to and change onto a Transport for Wales service to these destinations).
* via and ; - the Snow Hill-Worcester-Hereford services were diverted to New Street in 1967, in 1995 services were resumed between Snow Hill, Stourbridge and Worcester.
* Cardiff via  – In 1908 the North Warwickshire Line route via Stratford and was opened, and became the principal GWR route between Birmingham and the South West and South Wales. A pioneering diesel railcar service with a buffet commenced running in July 1934 between Snow Hill and Cardiff, running non-stop through Stratford, with only two stops at Gloucester and Newport. This was the first long-distance diesel express service in Britain. The railcar service ran until 1946, when it was replaced with a conventional steam service, which continued until it was diverted via New Street in 1962.
* , , and via Stratford-upon-Avon – These services were diverted via New Street and in 1962. British Railways later closed the line between Stratford and Cheltenham in 1976.

===Closure===
As late as the mid-1960s Snow Hill was still a major station handling millions of passengers annually; in 1964 Snow Hill handled 7.5 million passengers, compared to 10.2 million at New Street. However the electrification of the rival West Coast Main Line into New Street, meant that British Railways decided to concentrate all services into Birmingham into one station, and Snow Hill was seen as being an unnecessary duplication. In 1966 the decision was taken to end main line services through Snow Hill once electrification of the WCML was complete, and divert most of its remaining services through New Street. 


Long-distance services through Snow Hill ceased in March 1967. Snow Hill tunnel closed to all traffic the following year, with the last train running on 2 March 1968. Local trains towards Leamington Spa and Stratford upon Avon were then terminated at Moor Street. Services to London, the West Country, Stourbridge and Shrewsbury were diverted to New Street, and the branch to Dudley was closed. All that was left was a shuttle service of four trains per day using Class 122 railcars to , along with six daily stopping services to . With this, as most passenger facilities in the station were withdrawn and virtually the entire site became disused save for one bay platform, Snow Hill then acquired the unfortunate title of &quot;the largest unstaffed railway halt in the country&quot;. In March 1972 these last services were withdrawn and the station closed entirely, along with the lines through to Smethwick and Wolverhampton, with the exception of a single line from for Coopers Scrap Metal Works in Handsworth (the works is still in operation to this day).

Following closure, the derelict station was used for several years as a car park. It enjoyed a brief moment of fame in 1976 when it was the setting for a fight scene in the locally set BBC TV drama series &quot;Gangsters&quot;. However, despite a public outcry, the Snow Hill building was not preserved. The Colmore Row façade was demolished in 1969, and the rest of the station largely demolished in 1977, when the dangerous state of the building was revealed. The ironwork of the station roof was badly corroded in several places, and the unstable ground and foundations on which the station had been built were causing it to slide downhill. A few items, including the original gates and booking hall sign, were saved and later used in the Moor Street restoration.

The closure was decided by the London Midland region of British Railways, to whom the station and lines had been transferred to from the Western Region in 1963. The decision was actually against the recommendation of the Beeching report, which highlighted the route through Snow Hill and Wolverhampton Low Level as an important one to stay open, however the London Midland region didn&#x27;t want to have a line duplicate to their own from New Street to Wolverhampton High Level. The reason the station was re-opened so soon after its closure was because the West Midlands Passenger Transport Executive (now Transport for West Midlands) has been formed a few years earlier, but it didn&#x27;t have the necessary powers to prevent the station&#x27;s closure. As soon as the WMPTE gained these powers, they set to work re-opening Snow Hill and managed to safeguard the trackbed to Wolverhampton Low Level for a possible future re-opening, this would become the West Midlands Metro line in 1999.

===Rebirth===
The West Midlands Passenger Transport Authority had adopted a policy to restore cross-city rail services through Snow Hill since the 1970s, a project which was completed in two phases.

The first phase was completed on 5 October 1987, when the newly rebuilt Snow Hill station opened for services to the south, along with Snow Hill tunnel. The rebuilt station is on a smaller scale than its Edwardian predecessor, built with two island platforms, giving four platform faces. The station&#x27;s architecture is functional rather than ornate, a multi-storey car park stands over the main platform area, meaning artificial lighting is required on the platforms. Like its predecessor, the main entrance is on Colmore Row. Some parts of the original station are still visible (notably the now-sealed entrance, with GWR crest, in Livery Street).

Initially only local stopping services to and used the new station. Services at Moor Street, where these services had previously terminated, were switched from the former terminal platforms, which then closed, on to two newly built through platforms, at the southern end of Snow Hill tunnel, making a through station adjacent to the tunnel mouth.

In May 1993 Network SouthEast reintroduced limited-stop services to London, initially on a two-hourly frequency, routed to Marylebone instead of the pre-closure destination of Paddington. The service proved popular and was increased to an hourly frequency the following year. Chiltern Railways took over the service after privatisation.

The second phase of the Snow Hill reopening project was completed on 24 September 1995, when the Birmingham to Worcester via Kidderminster Line was reopened to Snow Hill. This allowed the resumption of services to Worcester Shrub Hill via Stourbridge Junction and Kidderminster. The &quot;Jewellery Line&quot; project involved reopening the line between Smethwick West and Snow Hill, along with three new stations (, The Hawthorns and Jewellery Quarter).

In 1999, the line to Wolverhampton was reopened as a light rail (tram) line, the Midland Metro.

Work began on a new entrance on Livery Street to give commuters access to the lower Snow Hill and Jewellery Quarter part of the city centre in 2005, but it did not open for business until March 2011. The work had a projected cost of £9.94 million, but due to Centro&#x27;s failure to apply for planning permission, and severe technical difficulties, the cost rose to at least £17 million. Although construction and interior finishes&#x27; works were largely complete by December 2010, legal disputes between London Midland, Network Rail and Centro caused delay to the opening of the entrance by over a year.
The former tram terminus platform is intended to be returned for use for mainline trains as a fourth platform. However as of September 2020, little work has been conducted other than disconnecting and partial lifting of the former tram line. The fourth platform is now expected to be completed by 2026.

====Station cat memorial====

In remembrance of a cat kept at the station before its closure, a memorial tile was installed during the works for the reopening. During later refurbishment works in 2014 care was taken that the tile would stay in situ.

==Services==
The station is managed by West Midlands Trains and services are provided by West Midlands Trains and Chiltern Railways. There is a small set of sidings at the Hockley end of the station, which can be reached from Platform 1 only. All platforms can be used in either direction; generally platforms 1 or 2 are used for trains heading north, platform 2 is used for trains terminating at the station and platform 3 is used for trains going south.

Occasional steam-hauled special trains use the station.
===Chiltern Railways===

Snow Hill is served by Chiltern Railway services to and from London Marylebone, and is the northern terminus of the Chiltern Mainline from London Marylebone.

The typical Chiltern service pattern is as follows:
* 1 tp2h off-peak/ 1 train per hour (tph) in peak periods to London Marylebone via , , , , and .
* The first London-bound service begins at Stourbridge Junction.
* 3 tpd extend northwards in the evening peak to Stourbridge Junction, via Smethwick Galton Bridge and Rowley Regis.
* 1 tpd terminates short of London Marylebone at Leamington Spa.
* The last two London-bound services of the day terminate at Banbury.

===West Midlands Railway===
Local services from Snow Hill, like most local services in the West Midlands, are supported by Transport for West Midlands. They are operated by West Midlands Trains using the West Midlands Railway brand.

There are four West Midlands Railway trains per hour (tph) serving Snow Hill in each direction, running as follows:

Eastbound:
* 2 trains per hour to via 
**of which one continues to via the North Warwickshire Line.
* 2 trains per hour to via Solihull
**of which one continues to via 
**Two evening weekday West Midlands Railway services continue to Leamington Spa.

Westbound:

*4 trains per hour to via and :
**of which two continue to via 
**Some services reverse or terminate at .



==Tram stops==
===Former terminus===
From 1999 until 2015, Snow Hill was the terminus of the Midland Metro Line 1 from Wolverhampton. Opening on 31 May 1999, it occupied the space previously used by platform 4 of the main line station. The stop had two platforms, and was approached by a short section of single track.

The Snow Hill terminus was officially closed on 24 October 2015, and the approach line disconnected, in order to allow the new extension into Birmingham City Centre to be connected to the existing line. It is therefore the only Midland Metro stop so far to have been permanently closed. Trams terminated at St Paul&#x27;s until the first part of the extension was brought into service as far as Bull Street on 6 December 2015.

===Current through stop===
As part of the extension, a new through Snow Hill stop at a different location opened outside the station and further west, on the existing viaduct near the Livery Street entrance. Funding for this was confirmed in the October 2010 Comprehensive Spending Review. A new viaduct was built alongside the station as part of the Snowhill development to carry the tram lines into the city centre. This allows platform 4 to be returned to main line use in the future.

The new Snow Hill through stop was opened on 2 June 2016, two days after the full opening of the city-centre extension to New Street. However, the necessary works to allow passenger access to the stop from the street or adjacent railway station had not at the time been completed, meaning passengers could only access the stop by a walkway alongside the tracks from the city centre. Stairs and a lift connecting the stop to the street below were completed in September 2017.

In January 2017, the stop was renamed St Chads as the name Snow Hill was considered misleading for passengers using the mainline station due to the new stop&#x27;s lack of direct interchange with the railway station, and the closer proximity of Bull Street stop. The stop is now advertised as an alternate interchange to the mainline station with Bull Street being the main interchange.

In December 2018 it was announced that a new entrance would be constructed at Snow Hill station, by opening up an arch in the railway viaduct. This will allow direct interchange between St Chads tram stop and the railway station. The work is due to begin in Summer 2019.

==Accidents and incidents==

In October 1854, a derailed engine fell into Great Charles Street, below the station.

<doc id="209874" wikidata="Q1048589" url="?curid=209874" title="Density functional theory">
<text>Density functional theory (DFT) is a computational quantum mechanical modelling method used in physics, chemistry and materials science to investigate the electronic structure (or nuclear structure) (principally the ground state) of many-body systems, in particular atoms, molecules, and the condensed phases. Using this theory, the properties of a many-electron system can be determined by using functionals - that is, functions that accept a function as input and output a single real number. In the case of DFT, these are functionals of the spatially dependent electron density. DFT is among the most popular and versatile methods available in condensed-matter physics, computational physics, and computational chemistry.

DFT has been very popular for calculations in solid-state physics since the 1970s. However, DFT was not considered accurate enough for calculations in quantum chemistry until the 1990s, when the approximations used in the theory were greatly refined to better model the exchange and correlation interactions. Computational costs are relatively low when compared to traditional methods, such as exchange only Hartree–Fock theory and its descendants that include electron correlation. Since, DFT has become an important tool for methods of nuclear spectroscopy such as Mössbauer spectroscopy or perturbed angular correlation, in order to understand the origin of specific electric field gradients in crystals.

Despite recent improvements, there are still difficulties in using density functional theory to properly describe: intermolecular interactions (of critical importance to understanding chemical reactions), especially van der Waals forces (dispersion); charge transfer excitations; transition states, global potential energy surfaces, dopant interactions and some strongly correlated systems; and in calculations of the band gap and ferromagnetism in semiconductors. The incomplete treatment of dispersion can adversely affect the accuracy of DFT (at least when used alone and uncorrected) in the treatment of systems which are dominated by dispersion (e.g. interacting noble gas atoms) or where dispersion competes significantly with other effects (e.g. in biomolecules). The development of new DFT methods designed to overcome this problem, by alterations to the functional or by the inclusion of additive terms, is a current research topic. Classical density functional theory uses a similar formalism to calculate the properties of non-uniform classical fluids.

Despite the current popularity of these alterations or of the inclusion of additional terms, they are reported to stray away from the search for the exact functional. Further, DFT potentials obtained with adjustable parameters are no longer true DFT potentials, given that they are not functional derivatives of the exchange correlation energy with respect to the charge density. Consequently, it is not clear if the second theorem of DFT holds in such conditions.

==Overview of method==
In the context of computational materials science, &quot;ab initio&quot; (from first principles) DFT calculations allow the prediction and calculation of material behavior on the basis of quantum mechanical considerations, without requiring higher-order parameters such as fundamental material properties. In contemporary DFT techniques the electronic structure is evaluated using a potential acting on the system&#x27;s electrons. This DFT potential is constructed as the sum of external potentials , which is determined solely by the structure and the elemental composition of the system, and an effective potential , which represents interelectronic interactions. Thus, a problem for a representative supercell of a material with electrons can be studied as a set of one-electron Schrödinger-like equations, which are also known as Kohn–Sham equations.

===Origins===
Although density functional theory has its roots in the Thomas–Fermi model for the electronic structure of materials, DFT was first put on a firm theoretical footing by Walter Kohn and Pierre Hohenberg in the framework of the two Hohenberg–Kohn theorems (HK). The original HK theorems held only for non-degenerate ground states in the absence of a magnetic field, although they have since been generalized to encompass these.

The first HK theorem demonstrates that the ground-state properties of a many-electron system are uniquely determined by an electron density that depends on only three spatial coordinates. It set down the groundwork for reducing the many-body problem of electrons with spatial coordinates to three spatial coordinates, through the use of functionals of the electron density. This theorem has since been extended to the time-dependent domain to develop time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT), which can be used to describe excited states.

The second HK theorem defines an energy functional for the system and proves that the ground-state electron density minimizes this energy functional.

In work that later won them the Nobel prize in chemistry, the HK theorem was further developed by Walter Kohn and Lu Jeu Sham to produce Kohn–Sham DFT (KS DFT). Within this framework, the intractable many-body problem of interacting electrons in a static external potential is reduced to a tractable problem of noninteracting electrons moving in an effective potential. The effective potential includes the external potential and the effects of the Coulomb interactions between the electrons, e.g., the exchange and correlation interactions. Modeling the latter two interactions becomes the difficulty within KS DFT. The simplest approximation is the local-density approximation (LDA), which is based upon exact exchange energy for a uniform electron gas, which can be obtained from the Thomas–Fermi model, and from fits to the correlation energy for a uniform electron gas. Non-interacting systems are relatively easy to solve, as the wavefunction can be represented as a Slater determinant of orbitals. Further, the kinetic energy functional of such a system is known exactly. The exchange–correlation part of the total energy functional remains unknown and must be approximated.

Another approach, less popular than KS DFT but arguably more closely related to the spirit of the original HK theorems, is orbital-free density functional theory (OFDFT), in which approximate functionals are also used for the kinetic energy of the noninteracting system.

==Derivation and formalism==
As usual in many-body electronic structure calculations, the nuclei of the treated molecules or clusters are seen as fixed (the Born–Oppenheimer approximation), generating a static external potential , in which the electrons are moving. A stationary electronic state is then described by a wavefunction satisfying the many-electron time-independent Schrödinger equation

: formula_1

where, for the -electron system, is the Hamiltonian, is the total energy, formula_2 is the kinetic energy, formula_3 is the potential energy from the external field due to positively charged nuclei, and is the electron–electron interaction energy. The operators formula_2 and are called universal operators, as they are the same for any -electron system, while formula_3 is system-dependent. This complicated many-particle equation is not separable into simpler single-particle equations because of the interaction term .

There are many sophisticated methods for solving the many-body Schrödinger equation based on the expansion of the wavefunction in Slater determinants. While the simplest one is the Hartree–Fock method, more sophisticated approaches are usually categorized as post-Hartree–Fock methods. However, the problem with these methods is the huge computational effort, which makes it virtually impossible to apply them efficiently to larger, more complex systems.

Here DFT provides an appealing alternative, being much more versatile, as it provides a way to systematically map the many-body problem, with , onto a single-body problem without . In DFT the key variable is the electron density , which for a normalized is given by

: formula_6

This relation can be reversed, i.e., for a given ground-state density it is possible, in principle, to calculate the corresponding ground-state wavefunction . In other words, is a unique functional of ,

: formula_7

and consequently the ground-state expectation value of an observable is also a functional of :

: formula_8

In particular, the ground-state energy is a functional of :

: formula_9

where the contribution of the external potential formula_10 can be written explicitly in terms of the ground-state density formula_11:

: formula_12

More generally, the contribution of the external potential formula_13 can be written explicitly in terms of the density formula_14:

: formula_15

The functionals and are called universal functionals, while is called a non-universal functional, as it depends on the system under study. Having specified a system, i.e., having specified formula_3, one then has to minimize the functional

: formula_17

with respect to , assuming one has reliable expressions for and . A successful minimization of the energy functional will yield the ground-state density and thus all other ground-state observables.

The variational problems of minimizing the energy functional can be solved by applying the Lagrangian method of undetermined multipliers. First, one considers an energy functional that does not explicitly have an electron–electron interaction energy term,

: formula_18

where formula_19 denotes the kinetic-energy operator, and formula_20 is an effective potential in which the particles are moving. Based on formula_21, Kohn–Sham equations of this auxiliary noninteracting system can be derived:

: formula_22

which yields the orbitals that reproduce the density of the original many-body system

: formula_23

The effective single-particle potential can be written as

: formula_24

where formula_25 is the external potential, the second term is the Hartree term describing the electron–electron Coulomb repulsion, and the last term is the exchange–correlation potential. Here, includes all the many-particle interactions. Since the Hartree term and depend on , which depends on the , which in turn depend on , the problem of solving the Kohn–Sham equation has to be done in a self-consistent (i.e., iterative) way. Usually one starts with an initial guess for , then calculates the corresponding and solves the Kohn–Sham equations for the . From these one calculates a new density and starts again. This procedure is then repeated until convergence is reached. A non-iterative approximate formulation called Harris functional DFT is an alternative approach to this.

;Notes
# The one-to-one correspondence between electron density and single-particle potential is not so smooth. It contains kinds of non-analytic structure. contains kinds of singularities, cuts and branches. This may indicate a limitation of our hope for representing exchange–correlation functional in a simple analytic form.
# It is possible to extend the DFT idea to the case of the Green function instead of the density . It is called as Luttinger–Ward functional (or kinds of similar functionals), written as . However, is determined not as its minimum, but as its extremum. Thus we may have some theoretical and practical difficulties.
# There is no one-to-one correspondence between one-body density matrix and the one-body potential . (All the eigenvalues of are 1.) In other words, it ends up with a theory similar to the Hartree–Fock (or hybrid) theory.

==Relativistic formulation (ab initio functional forms)==
The same theorems can be proven in the case of relativistic electrons, thereby providing generalization of DFT for the relativistic case. Unlike the nonrelativistic theory, in the relativistic case it is possible to derive a few exact and explicit formulas for the relativistic density functional.

Let one consider an electron in the hydrogen-like ion obeying the relativistic Dirac equation. The Hamiltonian for a relativistic electron moving in the Coulomb potential can be chosen in the following form (atomic units are used):

: formula_26

where is the Coulomb potential of a pointlike nucleus, is a momentum operator of the electron, and , and are the elementary charge, electron mass and the speed of light respectively, and finally and are a set of Dirac 2 × 2 matrices:

:formula_27

To find out the eigenfunctions and corresponding energies, one solves the eigenfunction equation

: formula_28

where is a four-component wavefunction, and is the associated eigenenergy. It is demonstrated in Brack (1983) that application of the virial theorem to the eigenfunction equation produces the following formula for the eigenenergy of any bound state:

: formula_29

and analogously, the virial theorem applied to the eigenfunction equation with the square of the Hamiltonian yields

: formula_30

It is easy to see that both of the above formulae represent density functionals. The former formula can be easily generalized for the multi-electron case.

One may observe that both of the functionals written above do not have extremals, of course, if a reasonably wide set of functions is allowed for variation. Nevertheless, it is possible to design a density functional with desired extremal properties out of those ones. Let us make it in the following way:

: formula_31

where in Kronecker delta symbol of the second term denotes any extremal for the functional represented by the first term of the functional . The second term amounts to zero for any function that is not an extremal for the first term of functional . To proceed further we&#x27;d like to find Lagrange equation for this functional. In order to do this, we should allocate a linear part of functional increment when the argument function is altered:

: formula_32

Deploying written above equation, it is easy to find the following formula for functional derivative:

: formula_33

where , and , and is a value of potential at some point, specified by support of variation function , which is supposed to be infinitesimal. To advance toward Lagrange equation, we equate functional derivative to zero and after simple algebraic manipulations arrive to the following equation:

: formula_34

Apparently, this equation could have solution only if . This last condition provides us with Lagrange
equation for functional , which could be finally written down in the following form:

: formula_35

Solutions of this equation represent extremals for functional . It&#x27;s easy to see that all real densities,
that is, densities corresponding to the bound states of the system in question, are solutions of written above equation, which could be called the Kohn–Sham equation in this particular case. Looking back onto the definition of the functional , we clearly see that the functional produces energy of the system for appropriate density, because the first term amounts to zero for such density and the second one delivers the energy value.

==Approximations (exchange–correlation functionals)==
The major problem with DFT is that the exact functionals for exchange and correlation are not known, except for the free-electron gas. However, approximations exist which permit the calculation of certain physical quantities quite accurately. One of the simplest approximations is the local-density approximation (LDA), where the functional depends only on the density at the coordinate where the functional is evaluated:

: formula_36

The local spin-density approximation (LSDA) is a straightforward generalization of the LDA to include electron spin:

: formula_37

In LDA, the exchange–correlation energy is typically separated into the exchange part and the correlation part: . The exchange part is called the Dirac (or sometimes Slater) exchange, which takes the form . There are, however, many mathematical forms for the correlation part. Highly accurate formulae for the correlation energy density have been constructed from quantum Monte Carlo simulations of jellium. A simple first-principles correlation functional has been recently proposed as well. Although unrelated to the Monte Carlo simulation, the two variants provide comparable accuracy.

The LDA assumes that the density is the same everywhere. Because of this, the LDA has a tendency to underestimate the exchange energy and over-estimate the correlation energy. The errors due to the exchange and correlation parts tend to compensate each other to a certain degree. To correct for this tendency, it is common to expand in terms of the gradient of the density in order to account for the non-homogeneity of the true electron density. This allows corrections based on the changes in density away from the coordinate. These expansions are referred to as generalized gradient approximations (GGA) and have the following form:

: formula_38

Using the latter (GGA), very good results for molecular geometries and ground-state energies have been achieved.

Potentially more accurate than the GGA functionals are the meta-GGA functionals, a natural development after the GGA (generalized gradient approximation). Meta-GGA DFT functional in its original form includes the second derivative of the electron density (the Laplacian), whereas GGA includes only the density and its first derivative in the exchange–correlation potential.

Functionals of this type are, for example, TPSS and the Minnesota Functionals. These functionals include a further term in the expansion, depending on the density, the gradient of the density and the Laplacian (second derivative) of the density.

Difficulties in expressing the exchange part of the energy can be relieved by including a component of the exact exchange energy calculated from Hartree–Fock theory. Functionals of this type are known as hybrid functionals.

==Generalizations to include magnetic fields==

The DFT formalism described above breaks down, to various degrees, in the presence of a vector potential, i.e. a magnetic field. In such a situation, the one-to-one mapping between the ground-state electron density and wavefunction is lost. Generalizations to include the effects of magnetic fields have led to two different theories: current density functional theory (CDFT) and magnetic field density functional theory (BDFT). In both these theories, the functional used for the exchange and correlation must be generalized to include more than just the electron density. In current density functional theory, developed by Vignale and Rasolt, the functionals become dependent on both the electron density and the paramagnetic current density. In magnetic field density functional theory, developed by Salsbury, Grayce and Harris, the functionals depend on the electron density and the magnetic field, and the functional form can depend on the form of the magnetic field. In both of these theories it has been difficult to develop functionals beyond their equivalent to LDA, which are also readily implementable computationally.

==Applications==

In general, density functional theory finds increasingly broad application in chemistry and materials science for the interpretation and prediction of complex system behavior at an atomic scale. Specifically, DFT computational methods are applied for synthesis-related systems and processing parameters. In such systems, experimental studies are often encumbered by inconsistent results and non-equilibrium conditions. Examples of contemporary DFT applications include studying the effects of dopants on phase transformation behavior in oxides, magnetic behavior in dilute magnetic semiconductor materials, and the study of magnetic and electronic behavior in ferroelectrics and dilute magnetic semiconductors. It has also been shown that DFT gives good results in the prediction of sensitivity of some nanostructures to environmental pollutants like sulfur dioxide or acrolein, as well as prediction of mechanical properties.

In practice, Kohn–Sham theory can be applied in several distinct ways, depending on what is being investigated. In solid-state calculations, the local density approximations are still commonly used along with plane-wave basis sets, as an electron-gas approach is more appropriate for electrons delocalised through an infinite solid. In molecular calculations, however, more sophisticated functionals are needed, and a huge variety of exchange–correlation functionals have been developed for chemical applications. Some of these are inconsistent with the uniform electron-gas approximation; however, they must reduce to LDA in the electron-gas limit. Among physicists, one of the most widely used functionals is the revised Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof exchange model (a direct generalized gradient parameterization of the free-electron gas with no free parameters); however, this is not sufficiently calorimetrically accurate for gas-phase molecular calculations. In the chemistry community, one popular functional is known as BLYP (from the name Becke for the exchange part and Lee, Yang and Parr for the correlation part). Even more widely used is B3LYP, which is a hybrid functional in which the exchange energy, in this case from Becke&#x27;s exchange functional, is combined with the exact energy from Hartree–Fock theory. Along with the component exchange and correlation funсtionals, three parameters define the hybrid functional, specifying how much of the exact exchange is mixed in. The adjustable parameters in hybrid functionals are generally fitted to a &quot;training set&quot; of molecules. Although the results obtained with these functionals are usually sufficiently accurate for most applications, there is no systematic way of improving them (in contrast to some of the traditional wavefunction-based methods like configuration interaction or coupled cluster theory). In the current DFT approach it is not possible to estimate the error of the calculations without comparing them to other methods or experiments.

Density functional theory is generally highly accurate but highly computationally-expensive. In recent years, DFT has been used with machine learning techniques - especially graph neural networks - to create machine learning potentials. These graph neural networks approximate DFT, with the aim of achieving similar accuracies with much less computation, and are especially beneficial for large systems. They are trained using DFT-calculated properties of a known set of molecules. Researchers have been trying to approximate DFT with machine learning for decades, but have only recently made good estimators. Breakthroughs in model architecture and data preprocessing that more heavily encoded theoretical knowledge, especially regarding symmetries and invariances, have enabled huge leaps in model performance. Using backpropagation, the process by which neural networks learn from training errors, to extract meaningful information about forces and densities, has similarly improved machine learning potentials accuracy. By 2023, for example, the DFT approximator Matlantis could simulate 72 elements, handle up to 20,000 atoms at a time, and execute calculations up to 20,000,000 times faster than DFT with similar accuracy, showcasing the power of DFT approximators in the artificial intelligence age. ML approximations of DFT have historically faced substantial transferability issues, with models failing to generalize potentials from some types of elements and compounds to others; improvements in architecture and data have slowly mitigated, but not eliminated, this issue. For very large systems, electrically nonneutral simulations, and intricate reaction pathways, DFT approximators often remain insufficiently computationally-lightweight or insufficiently accurate.

==Thomas–Fermi model==
The predecessor to density functional theory was the Thomas–Fermi model, developed independently by both Llewellyn Thomas and Enrico Fermi in 1927. They used a statistical model to approximate the distribution of electrons in an atom. The mathematical basis postulated that electrons are distributed uniformly in phase space with two electrons in every formula_39 of volume. For each element of coordinate space volume formula_40 we can fill out a sphere of momentum space up to the Fermi momentum formula_41

: formula_42

Equating the number of electrons in coordinate space to that in phase space gives

: formula_43

Solving for and substituting into the classical kinetic energy formula then leads directly to a kinetic energy represented as a functional of the electron density:

: formula_44

where

: formula_45

As such, they were able to calculate the energy of an atom using this kinetic-energy functional combined with the classical expressions for the nucleus–electron and electron–electron interactions (which can both also be represented in terms of the electron density).

Although this was an important first step, the Thomas–Fermi equation&#x27;s accuracy is limited because the resulting kinetic-energy functional is only approximate, and because the method does not attempt to represent the exchange energy of an atom as a conclusion of the Pauli principle. An exchange-energy functional was added by Paul Dirac in 1928.

However, the Thomas–Fermi–Dirac theory remained rather inaccurate for most applications. The largest source of error was in the representation of the kinetic energy, followed by the errors in the exchange energy, and due to the complete neglect of electron correlation.

Edward Teller (1962) showed that Thomas–Fermi theory cannot describe molecular bonding. This can be overcome by improving the kinetic-energy functional.

The kinetic-energy functional can be improved by adding the von Weizsäcker (1935) correction:

: formula_46

==Hohenberg–Kohn theorems==
The Hohenberg–Kohn theorems relate to any system consisting of electrons moving under the influence of an external potential.

Theorem 1. The external potential (and hence the total energy), is a unique functional of the electron density.

: If two systems of electrons, one trapped in a potential formula_47 and the other in formula_48, have the same ground-state density formula_49, then formula_50 is necessarily a constant.

: Corollary 1: the ground-state density uniquely determines the potential and thus all properties of the system, including the many-body wavefunction. In particular, the HK functional, defined as formula_51, is a universal functional of the density (not depending explicitly on the external potential).
:Corollary 2: In light of the fact that the sum of the occupied energies provides the energy content of the Hamiltonian, a unique functional of the ground state charge density, the spectrum of the Hamiltonian is also a unique functional of the ground state charge density.

Theorem 2. The functional that delivers the ground-state energy of the system gives the lowest energy if and only if the input density is the true ground-state density.

: In other words, the energy content of the Hamiltonian reaches its absolute minimum, i.e., the ground state, when the charge density is that of the ground state.

: For any positive integer formula_52 and potential formula_53, a density functional formula_54 exists such that
:: formula_55
: reaches its minimal value at the ground-state density of formula_52 electrons in the potential formula_53. The minimal value of formula_58 is then the ground-state energy of this system.

==Pseudo-potentials==

The many-electron Schrödinger equation can be very much simplified if electrons are divided in two groups: valence electrons and inner core electrons. The electrons in the inner shells are strongly bound and do not play a significant role in the chemical binding of atoms; they also partially screen the nucleus, thus forming with the nucleus an almost inert core. Binding properties are almost completely due to the valence electrons, especially in metals and semiconductors. This separation suggests that inner electrons can be ignored in a large number of cases, thereby reducing the atom to an ionic core that interacts with the valence electrons. The use of an effective interaction, a pseudopotential, that approximates the potential felt by the valence electrons, was first proposed by Fermi in 1934 and Hellmann in 1935. In spite of the simplification pseudo-potentials introduce in calculations, they remained forgotten until the late 1950s.

===&quot;Ab initio&quot; pseudo-potentials===

A crucial step toward more realistic pseudo-potentials was given by William C. Topp and John Hopfield, who suggested that the pseudo-potential should be adjusted such that they describe the valence charge density accurately. Based on that idea, modern pseudo-potentials are obtained inverting the free-atom Schrödinger equation for a given reference electronic configuration and forcing the pseudo-wavefunctions to coincide with the true valence wavefunctions beyond a certain distance . The pseudo-wavefunctions are also forced to have the same norm (i.e., the so-called norm-conserving condition) as the true valence wavefunctions and can be written as

: formula_59

where is the radial part of the wavefunction with angular momentum , and PP and AE denote the pseudo-wavefunction and the true (all-electron) wavefunction respectively. The index in the true wavefunctions denotes the valence level. The distance beyond which the true and the pseudo-wavefunctions are equal is also dependent on .

==Electron smearing==
The electrons of a system will occupy the lowest Kohn–Sham eigenstates up to a given energy level according to the Aufbau principle. This corresponds to the steplike Fermi–Dirac distribution at absolute zero. If there are several degenerate or close to degenerate eigenstates at the Fermi level, it is possible to get convergence problems, since very small perturbations may change the electron occupation. One way of damping these oscillations is to &quot;smear&quot; the electrons, i.e. allowing fractional occupancies. One approach of doing this is to assign a finite temperature to the electron Fermi–Dirac distribution. Other ways is to assign a cumulative Gaussian distribution of the electrons or using a Methfessel–Paxton method.

==Classical density functional theory==
Classical density functional theory is a classical statistical method to investigate the properties of many-body systems consisting of interacting molecules, macromolecules, nanoparticles or microparticles. The classical non-relativistic method is correct for classical fluids with particle velocities less than the speed of light and thermal de Broglie wavelength smaller than the distance between particles. The theory is based on the calculus of variations of a thermodynamic functional, which is a function of the spatially dependent density function of particles, thus the name. The same name is used for quantum DFT, which is the theory to calculate the electronic structure of electrons based on spatially dependent electron density with quantum and relativistic effects. Classical DFT is a popular and useful method to study fluid phase transitions, ordering in complex liquids, physical characteristics of interfaces and nanomaterials. Since the 1970s it has been applied to the fields of materials science, biophysics, chemical engineering and civil engineering. Computational costs are much lower than for molecular dynamics simulations, which provide similar data and a more detailed description but are limited to small systems and short time scales. Classical DFT is valuable to interpret and test numerical results and to define trends although details of the precise motion of the particles are lost due to averaging over all possible particle trajectories. As in electronic systems, there are fundamental and numerical difficulties in using DFT to quantitatively describe the effect of intermolecular interaction on structure, correlations and thermodynamic properties.

Classical DFT addresses the difficulty of describing thermodynamic equilibrium states of many-particle systems with nonuniform density. Classical DFT has its roots in theories such as the van der Waals theory for the equation of state and the virial expansion method for the pressure. In order to account for correlation in the positions of particles the direct correlation function was introduced as the effective interaction between two particles in the presence of a number of surrounding particles by Leonard Ornstein and Frits Zernike in 1914. The connection to the density pair distribution function was given by the Ornstein–Zernike equation. The importance of correlation for thermodynamic properties was explored through density distribution functions. The functional derivative was introduced to define the distribution functions of classical mechanical systems. Theories were developed for simple and complex liquids using the ideal gas as a basis for the free energy and adding molecular forces as a second-order perturbation. A term in the gradient of the density was added to account for non-uniformity in density in the presence of external fields or surfaces. These theories can be considered precursors of DFT.

To develop a formalism for the statistical thermodynamics of non-uniform fluids functional differentiation was used extensively by Percus and Lebowitz (1961), which led to the Percus–Yevick equation linking the density distribution function and the direct correlation. Other closure relations were also proposed;the Classical-map hypernetted-chain method, the BBGKY hierarchy. In the late 1970s classical DFT was applied to the liquid–vapor interface and the calculation of surface tension. Other applications followed: the freezing of simple fluids, formation of the glass phase, the crystal–melt interface and dislocation in crystals, properties of polymer systems, and liquid crystal ordering. Classical DFT was applied to colloid dispersions, which were discovered to be good models for atomic systems. By assuming local chemical equilibrium and using the local chemical potential of the fluid from DFT as the driving force in fluid transport equations, equilibrium DFT is extended to describe non-equilibrium phenomena and fluid dynamics on small scales.

Classical DFT allows the calculation of the equilibrium particle density and prediction of thermodynamic properties and behavior of a many-body system on the basis of model interactions between particles. The spatially dependent density determines the local structure and composition of the material. It is determined as a function that optimizes the thermodynamic potential of the grand canonical ensemble. The grand potential is evaluated as the sum of the ideal-gas term with the contribution from external fields and an excess thermodynamic free energy arising from interparticle interactions. In the simplest approach the excess free-energy term is expanded on a system of uniform density using a functional Taylor expansion. The excess free energy is then a sum of the contributions from &quot;s&quot;-body interactions with density-dependent effective potentials representing the interactions between &quot;s&quot; particles. In most calculations the terms in the interactions of three or more particles are neglected (second-order DFT). When the structure of the system to be studied is not well approximated by a low-order perturbation expansion with a uniform phase as the zero-order term, non-perturbative free-energy functionals have also been developed. The minimization of the grand potential functional in arbitrary local density functions for fixed chemical potential, volume and temperature provides self-consistent thermodynamic equilibrium conditions, in particular, for the local chemical potential. The functional is not in general a convex functional of the density; solutions may not be local minima. Limiting to low-order corrections in the local density is a well-known problem, although the results agree (reasonably) well on comparison to experiment.

A variational principle is used to determine the equilibrium density. It can be shown that for constant temperature and volume the correct equilibrium density minimizes the grand potential functional formula_60 of the grand canonical ensemble over density functions formula_49. In the language of functional differentiation (Mermin theorem):

:formula_62

The Helmholtz free energy functional formula_63 is defined as formula_64.
The functional derivative in the density function determines the local chemical potential: formula_65.
In classical statistical mechanics the partition function is a sum over probability for a given microstate of classical particles as measured by the Boltzmann factor in the Hamiltonian of the system. The Hamiltonian splits into kinetic and potential energy, which includes interactions between particles, as well as external potentials. The partition function of the grand canonical ensemble defines the grand potential. A correlation function is introduced to describe the effective interaction between particles.

The &quot;s&quot;-body density distribution function is defined as the statistical ensemble average formula_66 of particle positions. It measures the probability to find &quot;s&quot; particles at points in space formula_67:

:formula_68

From the definition of the grand potential, the functional derivative with respect to the local chemical potential is the density; higher-order density correlations for two, three, four or more particles are found from higher-order derivatives:

:formula_69

The radial distribution function with &quot;s&quot; = 2 measures the change in the density at a given point for a change of the local chemical interaction at a distant point.

In a fluid the free energy is a sum of the ideal free energy and the excess free-energy contribution formula_70 from interactions between particles. In the grand ensemble the functional derivatives in the density yield the direct correlation functions formula_71:

:formula_72

The one-body direct correlation function plays the role of an effective mean field. The functional derivative in density of the one-body direct correlation results in the direct correlation function between two particles formula_73. The direct correlation function is the correlation contribution to the change of local chemical potential at a point formula_74 for a density change at formula_75 and is related to the work of creating density changes at different positions. In dilute gases the direct correlation function is simply the pair-wise interaction between particles (Debye–Huckel equation). The Ornstein–Zernike equation between the pair and the direct correlation functions is derived from the equation

:formula_76

Various assumptions and approximations adapted to the system under study lead to expressions for the free energy. Correlation functions are used to calculate the free-energy functional as an expansion on a known reference system. If the non-uniform fluid can be described by a density distribution that is not far from uniform density a functional Taylor expansion of the free energy in density increments leads to an expression for the thermodynamic potential using known correlation functions of the uniform system. In the square gradient approximation a strong non-uniform density contributes a term in the gradient of the density. In a perturbation theory approach the direct correlation function is given by the sum of the direct correlation in a known system such as hard spheres and a term in a weak interaction such as the long range London dispersion force. In a local density approximation the local excess free energy is calculated from the effective interactions with particles distributed at uniform density of the fluid in a cell surrounding a particle. Other improvements have been suggested such as the weighted density approximation for a direct correlation function of a uniform system which distributes the neighboring particles with an effective weighted density calculated from a self-consistent condition on the direct correlation function.

The variational Mermin principle leads to an equation for the equilibrium density and system properties are calculated from the solution for the density. The equation is a non-linear integro-differential equation and finding a solution is not trivial, requiring numerical methods, except for the simplest models. Classical DFT is supported by standard software packages, and specific software is currently under development. Assumptions can be made to propose trial functions as solutions, and the free energy is expressed in the trial functions and optimized with respect to parameters of the trial functions. Examples are a localized Gaussian function centered on crystal lattice points for the density in a solid, the hyperbolic function formula_77 for interfacial density profiles.

Classical DFT has found many applications, for example: 
* developing new functional materials in materials science, in particular nanotechnology;
* studying the properties of fluids at surfaces and the phenomena of wetting and adsorption;
* understanding life processes in biotechnology;
* improving filtration methods for gases and fluids in chemical engineering;
* fighting pollution of water and air in environmental science;
* cell membranes by modelling complex systems with amphiphile compounds;
* generating new procedures in microfluidics and nanofluidics.

The extension of classical DFT towards nonequilibrium systems is known as dynamical density functional theory (DDFT). DDFT allows to describe the time evolution of the one-body density formula_78 of a colloidal system, which is governed by the equation

:formula_79

with the mobility formula_80 and the free energy formula_81. DDFT can be derived from the microscopic equations of motion for a colloidal system (Langevin equations or Smoluchowski equation) based on the adiabatic approximation, which corresponds to the assumption that the two-body distribution in a nonequilibrium system is identical to that in an equilibrium system with the same one-body density. For a system of noninteracting particles, DDFT reduces to the standard diffusion equation.

<text>Manchester Piccadilly is the main railway station of the city of Manchester, in the metropolitan county of Greater Manchester, England. Opened originally as Store Street in 1842, it was renamed Manchester London Road in 1847 and became Manchester Piccadilly in 1960. Located to the south-east of the city centre, it hosts long-distance intercity and cross-country services to national destinations including London, Birmingham, Nottingham, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Cardiff, Bristol, Exeter, Plymouth, Reading, Southampton and Bournemouth; regional services to destinations in Northern England including Liverpool, Leeds, Sheffield, Newcastle and York; and local commuter services around Greater Manchester. It is one of 19 major stations managed by Network Rail. The station has 14 platforms: 12 terminal and two through platforms (numbers 13 and 14). Piccadilly is also a major interchange with the Metrolink light rail system with two tram platforms in its undercroft.

Manchester Piccadilly is the busiest station in the Manchester station group (the other major stations in Manchester are Manchester Oxford Road and Manchester Victoria). As of December 2024, it is the second-busiest station in the United Kingdom outside of London (after Birmingham New Street), and is also one of the busiest interchange stations outside London, with over 2million passengers changing trains annually. The station hosts services from six train operating companies.

Between the late 1990s and early 2000s, Piccadilly station was refurbished, taking five years and costing £100million (in 2002); it was the most expensive improvement on the UK rail network at the time. Further improvements and expansion plans have been proposed. In December 2014, a Transport and Works Act application was submitted for the construction of two through platforms as part of the &quot;Manchester Piccadilly and Manchester Oxford Road Capacity Scheme&quot;. As of 2023, this application has not been approved by the incumbent government although Network Rail declared the Castlefield corridor through Manchester &#x27;congested&#x27; in September 2019.

==History==
===Origins===
In June 1840, the Manchester and Birmingham Railway (M&amp;BR) opened a temporary terminus on its line to Stockport on Travis Street. A large site, long by wide, was cleared of terraced houses and industrial premises to make way for the permanent station &quot;Store Street&quot; which was built on top of a viaduct, above ground level. The station was opened adjacent to London Road on 8 May 1842. It had two platforms, offices and passenger amenities and by then the line had been extended to Crewe. 

Store Street was designed by M&amp;BR&#x27;s chief engineer, George W. Buck, who designed many of the line&#x27;s structures including the Stockport Viaduct. Charles Hutton Gregory was the assistant engineer. The station was shared from the beginning with the Sheffield, Ashton-under-Lyne and Manchester Railway (SA&amp;MR) following an agreement made by the promoters in 1837.

The M&amp;BR amalgamated with other railway companies to create the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) in 1846. The SA&amp;MR changed its name to the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway (MS&amp;LR) three years later.

===Manchester London Road===
In 1847, the station was renamed &quot;London Road&quot;. In 1849 the Manchester, South Junction and Altrincham Railway (MSJA&amp;R) began using the station after its line from was extended. Its single platform which opened on 1 August 1849 to the south of, and adjacent to the main part of station, was the predecessor of through platforms 13 and 14. The MSJA&amp;R&#x27;s line connected to the main line south of the station and formed a through route to the LNWR&#x27;s line to Liverpool.

By the 1850s, London Road was overcrowded and the relationship between the LNWR and MS&amp;LR had deteriorated, due to the latter&#x27;s decision to cooperate with the Great Northern Railway in providing a rival service to London from the station, in direct competition with the LNWR. Netherless, the two cooperated on rebuilding the station to expand it. The rebuild which started in 1862, allowed the station to be divided; the MS&amp;LR occupying the north-eastern side and the LNWR the south-western side. The station was given a new entrance building and concourse with each company having separate booking offices and passenger facilities. A long iron and glass trainshed was built over the terminal platforms; it had two wide arched spans, one covering the LNWR platforms and the other the MS&amp;LR platforms. On 20 January 1866, a fatal accident occurred during the roof&#x27;s construction, when part of it collapsed killing two workmen and injuring 30 others. The enquiry determined that the collapse was caused by strong winds and heavy snowfall. At the same time, the viaduct south of the station to Ardwick was widened to carry four tracks, and both companies built goods stations and warehouses to the northern side of the passenger station.

Within ten years, the station was again over-crowded as traffic continued to increase and expansion was again required. Between 1880 and 1883, the LNWR widened its side of the station and built more platforms, which were covered by two more wide arched spans to the trainshed. At the same time, the MSJ&amp;AR platform was taken out and rebuilt as an island platform on a girder bridge over Fairfield Street and linked to the main station by a footbridge. In May 1882, the improvements were opened.

In 1897, the MS&amp;LR changed its name to the Great Central Railway (GCR); it opened its own direct route from the station to London in 1899.

In 1910, the adjacent Mayfield station opened with four platforms to alleviate overcrowding at London Road. The stations were linked by a footbridge. Mayfield station closed to passengers in 1960 and to all traffic in 1986. The derelict station has remained &quot;in situ&quot; despite proposed redevelopment schemes including reopening it to relieve demand. In October 2013 the station&#x27;s roof/canopies were demolished due to safety concerns.

Following the 1923 railway grouping, the LNWR amalgamated with several other railway companies to create the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS), and the GCR amalgamated with other railways to create the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER). The division of the station was maintained and it continued to be operated as two separate stations even after the nationalisation of the railways in 1948: One side was used by the London Midland Region of British Railways and the other by Eastern Region.

===Manchester Piccadilly===

Between 1958 and 1966, London Road was rebuilt in the West Coast Main Line modernisation programme undertaken by British Railways. It was renamed &quot;Manchester Piccadilly&quot; on 12 September 1960. Piccadilly is the name of a road and Piccadilly Gardens nearby.

The London Midland Region rebuilt the station at a cost of £1.75million (equivalent to £ million at 2025 prices) in preparation for electric train services to London. Most of the station was rebuilt, except for the Victorian trainsheds which remained mostly unaltered, although the two 1880s spans were shortened towards the concourse end. The station was reconstructed in two phases, 1958–1960 and 1963–1966; the break was the result of a national credit squeeze restricting funding for railway modernisation.

The former MSJA&amp;R through platforms and bridges over Fairfield Street were rebuilt on a prestressed concrete slab bridge with cantilevered sides for the tracks. The layout in the trainshed was reconfigured to add several platforms. A new concourse and entrance were built, alongside which was a ten-storey office block which housed British Rail staff. On 11 May 1966, work was completed for the introduction of electric expresses to London.

The approach to the station was also redeveloped. The LNWR goods warehouse alongside the station approach closed in 1965 and a curved office block, Gateway House, was opened in its place in 1969.

Piccadilly remained open throughout the reconstruction, but there was disruption, and many trains were diverted to Manchester Mayfield or stations. When the work was completed, those stations were no longer required; they were closed and their services were diverted into Piccadilly.

====Picc-Vic tunnel and Metrolink====
In the early 1970s, an underground station, &quot;Piccadilly Low Level&quot;, was proposed as part of the Picc-Vic tunnel project. This scheme proposed creating a direct rail link between Piccadilly and , by building a tunnel and several underground stations under Manchester city centre. The project was cancelled in the late 1970s, because of the high cost, and transport planners turned instead towards light rail as a lower-cost option. This resulted eventually in the Manchester Metrolink system which opened in the early 1990s linking the two stations by a street-level tramway and linking two converted rail lines to Altrincham and Bury. The tram stop in the station&#x27;s undercroft opened in 1992.

====Windsor Link====
Between 1988 and 1989, Piccadilly&#x27;s through platforms 13 and 14 were further lengthened, in conjunction with the opening of the Windsor Link chord in Salford, which allowed trains from places to the north of Manchester, such as , , Blackpool and Scotland, to run directly into Piccadilly via the through platforms and continue south to destinations such as , and (from 1993 onwards) . Once completed, it allowed for many services from the north to be diverted from , which was reduced in size. This enhanced Piccadilly&#x27;s status as Manchester&#x27;s main station. The link was opened in 1988; it was declared to be fully operational the following year.

====2002 redevelopment====

Between 1998 and 2002, in preparation for the 2002 Commonwealth Games, the station underwent a £100million redevelopment. The glass roof of the trainshed, which is a Grade II listed structure, was reglazed and repainted. A new main entrance and enlarged concourse with a mezzanine level, designed by BDP, replaced the 1960s structure, which had become insufficient for the number of passengers regularly using the station. A moving walkway was installed to take passengers from the concourse to platforms 13 and 14 on the far south side of the station, which had previously necessitated a long walk. Another entrance was also created on Fairfield Street, which provides access to a new taxi rank along with a drop-off point for private cars.

===Electrification===
The station is unusual in having seen two different systems of overhead railway electrification: The first electrified line into London Road was the MSJA&amp;R line to , a busy commuter route. It was electrified with overhead lines, energised at 1,500 V DC in 1931. London Road was the terminus of the electrification scheme which ran through to the through platforms.

The second line to be electrified using 1,500 V DC was the LNER&#x27;s Woodhead Route from Manchester to Sheffield. Work on the scheme commenced in the late 1930s, but was stopped due to the Second World War, before being restarted in the early 1950s. Electrification was completed in September 1954. The two electric 1,500 V DC lines ran into different parts of the station.

25 kV AC overhead electrification, adopted as the national standard by British Railways, was brought to London Road/Piccadilly in the West Coast Main Line electrification scheme starting in the late-1950s. The main line was electrified to by 1960 and London by 1966. At the same time, the 1,500 V electrification on the Altrincham line was cut back to Oxford Road to where the new system was extended from the south. The Altrincham line was converted to 25 kV in 1971.

The two systems co-existed for a number of years. The Woodhead Route was closed as a through line in 1981, but local services to Glossop and Hadfield continued to be operated by 1,500 V trains until the line was converted to 25 kV during 1984.

During the 2010s, the Northern Hub scheme saw electrification extended from Manchester to Liverpool in 2015, and Manchester to Preston and through to Blackpool in 2019.

==Architecture==

The listed train shed roof which is wide between platforms 1 and 12, comprises four spans; two of the spans, in length, were built over the eastern part of the station during the 1860s while the other two, at the western side measuring , were constructed in the early 1880s. The roof is supported by masonry walls at the outer edges, which have round-headed windows alongside platforms 1 and 12, and rows of cast iron columns along the platforms in its interior space. The roof spans have an arrangement of wrought iron trusses with supporting cast iron struts on girders, which are evenly spaced between the columns.

As built, the roof was largely covered with slates with some areas of glazing; over time, the slates were replaced with boarded felt. Between 1997 and 1999, the station roof was refurbished and the traditional cladding was replaced with around 10,000 panes of toughened glass that &#x27;float&#x27; above the wrought iron trusses. Layers of nets have been installed, to catch falling glass in the event of any of the panes were to break.

Below the train shed is the undercroft that was used as a goods station. Cast iron columns and brick arches support the terminal platforms directly above. Since the early 1990s, the undercroft accommodates the Metrolink station, its tracks, sidings, and car parking. Before it was reused for the Metrolink, the cast-iron columns throughout the undercroft were encased in concrete as a protective measure against collision.

George W. Buck designed the original skew arch bridge over Fairfield Street; it had ten cast iron arch ribs, which formed one part of the brick arch viaduct, and was topped with open stonework parapets. The bridge was subsequently widened and wrought iron plate girders and transverse girders were added to support longitudinal joists with iron arch plates. In the 1960s, in the reconstruction programme, the cast iron arches and spandrels were encased in concrete. Platforms 13 and 14 are situated on top of this bridge.

Many of the original station buildings were demolished during the 1960s to clear the way for a new approach. The main entrance leads to a concourse with ground floor, and since the 2000s, mezzanine levels. The Fairfield Street entrance leads to the Metrolink station in the undercroft and is linked to the rail platforms by escalators. Between 1997 and 2002, a redevelopment programme revised the station&#x27;s layout and a glass partition wall with ticket barriers separating the concourse from the platforms was constructed. The station&#x27;s approach leading to the end of Piccadilly was constructed in 1969 along with the &quot;wavy&quot; fronted Gateway House designed by the architect Richard Seifert. Gateway House was modernised during 2003.

==Facilities==
The Fairfield Street entrance, at basement level, serves the car park, the taxi rank, and the Metrolink station. Above it at track level is a concourse into which the main entrance feeds, housing ticket offices, information points, seating, timetables, toilets, shops, and food and drink outlets. Above the concourse is a second level of food outlets and bars, and the Avanti West Coast First Class Lounge. On the main concourse, doorways in a large glass partition wall access platforms 1 to 12. A travelator leads to the upper concourse linked by a footbridge, steps and lift to platforms 13 and 14. The island lounge contains retail outlets, toilets and a departure lounge. There are vending machines, waiting areas and snack bars on platforms 13 and 14.

Manchester Piccadilly is accessible for disabled people and has escalators and lifts to all levels, wide-access doors and gates, braille signs, hearing loops and disabled toilet facilities.

Cycle racks are available on Fairfield Street and the long-stay car park and next to the tower block at the station front. During March 2010, Manchester City Council and Network Rail unveiled plans for a &#x27;Cycle Centre&#x27; to provide secure facilities and on-site maintenance and hire services. The station has a taxi rank, drop-off/pick-up point, and short- and long-stay car parks. accessible from Fairfield Street. The long-stay multi-storey car park is at the rear of the station.

Ticket barriers were installed in Autumn 2016 between platforms 3 and 7, following an application by Virgin Trains. Ticket barriers were fitted on platforms 1–3 by TransPennine Express.

==Layout==

Platform 1 is on the north side of the station and the through platforms 13 and 14 are on the south side. Of the terminus platforms,

* Platforms 1-4 are typically used by eastbound services to , New Mills and via the Hope Valley Line, services on the Glossop Line, and TransPennine Express services to Huddersfield. Northern services to Crewe are also frequently seen from these platforms.
* Platforms 5-9 are the longest and are used mainly by Avanti West Coast and CrossCountry services. Platform 5 usually sees the local Northern services to Chester &amp; Stoke-On-Trent. Platform 9 sees the use of the TransPennine Express services from Cleethorpes - Manchester Airport. 
* Platforms 10-12 are considerably shorter than the others and are usually used to accommodate local trains to and , plus Mid-Cheshire line, Buxton Line and South Wales services; platform 12 is the shortest and can only accommodate four coaches.

==Piccadilly tram stop==
Piccadilly Metrolink tram stop is located at ground level in the undercroft underneath the main line station; an area of the station which was historically used for warehousing, it is one of nine stops serving Manchester city centre, within the system&#x27;s Zone 1. Trams enter the stop from the streets in each direction via short tunnels. There are two platforms: one for eastbound trams towards Etihad Campus and Ashton-under-Lyne, and one for north and westbound trams towards Bury, Eccles and Altrincham. There are steps, lifts and escalators between the platform level and a mezzanine level, along with further steps, lifts and escalators that connect with the main line station&#x27;s concourse. There are also multiple entrances present at ground level from the surrounding streets.
The tram station was first opened on 20 July 1992, originally being known as &quot;Piccadilly Undercroft&quot;. As the stop was located directly underneath the main line station platforms, the then station operator British Rail required that it be built inside a protective concrete box, in order to protect the cast iron supports for the main line platforms from the possibility of collision or fire damage.

As Piccadilly originally served as a terminus of the system, early operations saw one platform being used for arrivals from Altrincham, Bury and later Eccles, with the other platform used for departures. Empty trams ran from the arrival platform into a nearby reversing siding in a tunnel, where they would reverse and then enter the departure platform. From the onset, the stop had been designed with future extension in mind; as such, since the opening of the extension towards Ashton in 2013, the former arrivals platform has also been used for departures towards Ashton as well as terminating trams, while the former departures platform also handles arrivals from Ashton. Terminating trams use a reversing siding on the Ashton line between Piccadilly and New Islington tram stops.

During 2008, the tram station was refurbished, after which it became the first station to display the new Metrolink corporate identity. Station signage bears the yellow and silver livery as applied to the new generation of trams since 2009.

According to TfGM, the Piccadilly tram station is one of the most frequented stops on the Metrolink network.

It has been proposed by High Speed Two Limited that the existing Piccadilly stop be moved to a four-platform underground station beneath Manchester Piccadilly High Speed station. Provision for a second stop at ground-level to the east of the high speed station called Piccadilly Central is also proposed to provide for future expansions of the Metrolink network.

===Metrolink services===
As of 2024, Piccadilly tram stop is the terminus for Metrolink services to Bury, and Altrincham at most operating times (see table below), and a major stop on the through services to Eccles, MediaCityUK, Etihad Campus, and Ashton-under-Lyne. Services run every twelve minutes on each route at most operating times.

==Future proposals==
In 2009, the Greater Manchester Integrated Transport Authority advocated reopening the neighbouring derelict Mayfield station to alleviate capacity problems but the proposal was not advanced; plans focused on increasing track capacity on the cross-city route between Piccadilly and Oxford Road stations were pursued.

===Northern Hub===
During the early 2010s, Network Rail promoted its Northern Hub plans, estimated to cost in excess of £560million to improve the heavily congested rail network on the approach into Manchester. A pair of through platforms would be constructed at Piccadilly and the station linked to Manchester Victoria via the Ordsall Chord, cutting journey times on Trans-Pennine routes. The construction of the Ordsall Chord made it possible for trains from the airport to travel via platforms 13 and 14 and Oxford Road to Manchester Victoria and Leeds and via the Calder Valley Line to Bradford Interchange.

Phase 2 aims to alleviate congestion at platforms 13 and 14 by constructing a parallel elevated island platform and allow the minimum time between trains to be decreased from four to three minutes, improving reliability. It will allow four more trains per hour to be timetabled to Oxford Road including a second freight to Trafford Park. Approval for the platforms, at an estimated cost of £200million, was announced during July 2012.

The proposals would simplify train operations at Piccadilly, creating close associations between pairs of lines leading out of the station and particular platforms while requiring only a few crossing moves. Platforms 1 to 4 would be primarily used for services on the &#x27;east&#x27; lines, to and from Marple, Glossop and Huddersfield; platforms 5 to 12 would be for services on the &#x27;fast&#x27; lines, to and from Crewe and Stoke; through platforms 13 to 16 would be dedicated to services on the present &#x27;slow&#x27; lines, to and from Manchester Airport and Hazel Grove.

In July 2013, Network Rail consulted on three options for the additional platforms at Piccadilly, all of which would affect local roads and the Grade II listed Star and Garter public house.

Construction was originally due to begin in 2016, but the project was delayed indefinitely. In 2023, Network Rail stated plans for the new platforms had been shelved to allow improvements to Manchester Victoria and Salford Crescent stations to go ahead instead.

===High Speed 2===

To accommodate High Speed 2 (HS2), an extension would require four platforms and a tunnel under south Manchester to join the West Coast Main Line at Ardwick. Journey times to Manchester Airport would be reduced to 9minutes from 18, Birmingham 41minutes from 86minutes, and London 68minutes from 128. Station upgrades could include enhanced Metrolink services, improved road access and car parking. The line is planned to be completed by 2032.

A major redevelopment of the station and surrounding area has been proposed to complement the HS2 proposals involving the construction of a canopy over the HS2 platforms, the creation of a new entrance, and office, retail and residential development. Designs indicate that the derelict Mayfield Station and the Gateway House office block will be demolished. The plans were approved by the Government in November 2016.

In October 2023 the portion of HS2 north of Birmingham was announced to be cancelled at the Conservative Party conference in Manchester.

===Northern Powerhouse Rail===
Northern Powerhouse Rail (NPR) proposals include the construction of new platforms under Piccadilly station and the proposed HS2 platforms. The 2016 &#x27;Manchester Piccadilly Options Assessment&#x27; by the National Infrastructure Commission stated: &quot;Addition of Northern Powerhouse Rail and Station to the Manchester Piccadilly system will be the last step of the process of transforming the station in to [sic] a transport super hub. The NPR station and its construction will need to be considered throughout the design and implementation of the other station improvements, which form the station concept but which are delivered earlier. The NPR station is proposed to stay underground on its way east as it passes through Manchester city. This provides opportunities and offers location and orientation alternatives. Staying under the existing Piccadilly station or positioning NPR under the HS2 station box will maximise interchange efficiencies and travel distances. The orientation will also dictate the number of vertical connection cores also referred to as “drums” and their locations. The drums will have the function to connect all levels of transport to one and other [sic] at critical junction points.&quot;

During October 2017, according to a report to the Manchester City Council’s executive of the various proposals submitted, the development of an underground station has been selected as the preferred option for accommodating the envisioned NPR services, which are speculated to involve the running of up to eight trains per hour, as well as connecting services with the in-development HS2. The importance of directly integrating this underground facility with the existing Piccadilly Station has been emphasised as well; however, the report observes that the necessary financing for the programme is still lacking.

<doc id="209876" wikidata="Q211670" url="?curid=209876" title="Honeyeater">
<text>The honeyeaters are a large and diverse family, Meliphagidae, of small to medium-sized birds. The family includes the Australian chats, myzomelas, friarbirds, wattlebirds, miners and melidectes. They are most common in Australia and New Guinea, and found also in New Zealand, the Pacific islands as far east as Samoa and Tonga, and the islands to the north and west of New Guinea known as Wallacea. Bali, on the other side of the Wallace Line, has a single species.

In total, there are 186 species in 55 genera, roughly half of them native to Australia, many of the remainder occupying New Guinea. With their closest relatives, the Maluridae (Australian fairy-wrens), Pardalotidae (pardalotes), and Acanthizidae (thornbills, Australian warblers, scrubwrens, etc.), they comprise the superfamily Meliphagoidea and originated early in the evolutionary history of the oscine passerine radiation. Although honeyeaters look and behave very much like other nectar-feeding passerines around the world (such as the sunbirds and flowerpeckers), they are unrelated, and the similarities are the consequence of convergent evolution.

The extent of the evolutionary partnership between honeyeaters and Australasian flowering plants is unknown, but probably substantial. A great many Australian plants are fertilised by honeyeaters, particularly the Proteaceae, Myrtaceae, and Ericaceae. It is known that the honeyeaters are important in New Zealand (see &quot;Anthornis&quot;) as well, and assumed that the same applies in other areas.

==Description==
Honeyeaters can be either nectarivorous, insectivorous, frugivorous, or a combination of nectar- and insect-eating. Unlike the hummingbirds of America, honeyeaters do not have extensive adaptations for hovering flight, though smaller members of the family do hover hummingbird-style to collect nectar from time to time. In general, honeyeaters prefer to flit quickly from perch to perch in the outer foliage, stretching up or sideways or hanging upside down at need. Many genera have a highly developed brush-tipped tongue, frayed and fringed with bristles which soak up liquids readily. The tongue is flicked rapidly and repeatedly into a flower, the upper mandible then compressing any liquid out when the bill is closed.

In addition to nectar, all or nearly all honeyeaters take insects and other small creatures, usually by hawking, sometimes by gleaning. A few of the larger species, notably the white-eared honeyeater, and the strong-billed honeyeater of Tasmania, probe under bark for insects and other morsels. Many species supplement their diets with a little fruit, and a small number eat considerable amounts of fruit, particularly in tropical rainforests and, oddly, in semi-arid scrubland. The painted honeyeater is a mistletoe specialist. Most, however, exist on a diet of nectar supplemented by varying quantities of insects. In general, the honeyeaters with long, fine bills are more nectarivorous, the shorter-billed species less so, but even specialised nectar eaters like the spinebills take extra insects to add protein to their diet when breeding.

The movements of honeyeaters are poorly understood. Most are at least partially mobile but many movements seem to be local, possibly between favourite haunts as the conditions change. Fluctuations in local abundance are common, but the small number of definitely migratory honeyeater species aside, the reasons are yet to be discovered. Many follow the flowering of favourite food plants. Arid zone species appear to travel further and less predictably than those of the more fertile areas. It seems probable that no single explanation will emerge.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
The genera &quot;Cleptornis&quot; (golden honeyeater) and &quot;Apalopteron&quot; (Bonin honeyeater), formerly treated in the Meliphagidae, have recently been transferred to the Zosteropidae on genetic evidence. The genus &quot;Notiomystis&quot; (New Zealand stitchbird), formerly classified in the Meliphagidae, has recently been removed to the newly erected Notiomystidae of which it is the only member. The &quot;Macgregor&#x27;s bird-of-paradise&quot;, historically considered a bird-of-paradise (Paradisaeidae), was recently found to be a honeyeater. It is now known as &quot;MacGregor&#x27;s honeyeater&quot; and is classified in the Meliphagidae.

The wattled smoky honeyeater (&quot;Melipotes carolae&quot;), described in 2007, had been discovered in December 2005 in the Foja Mountains of Papua, Indonesia.

In 2008, a study that included molecular phylogenetic analysis of museum specimens in the genera &quot;Moho&quot; and &quot;Chaetoptila&quot;, both extinct genera endemic to the Hawaiian islands, argued that these five species were not members of the Meliphagidae and instead belong to their own distinct family, the Mohoidae.

<text>The Sand Creek massacre (also known as the Chivington massacre, the battle of Sand Creek or the massacre of Cheyenne Indians) was a massacre of Cheyenne and Arapaho people by the U.S. Army in the American Indian Wars that occurred on November 29, 1864, when a 675-man force of the Third Colorado Cavalry under the command of U.S. Volunteers Colonel John Chivington attacked and destroyed a village of Cheyenne and Arapaho people in southeastern Colorado Territory, killing and mutilating an estimated 70 to over 600 Native American people. Chivington claimed 500 to 600 warriors were killed. However, most sources estimate around 150 people were killed, about two-thirds of whom were women and children. The location has been designated the Sand Creek Massacre National Historic Site and is administered by the National Park Service. The massacre is considered part of a series of events known as the Colorado Wars.

== Background ==

===Treaty of Fort Laramie===
By the terms of the 1851 Treaty of Fort Laramie between the United States and seven Indian nations, including the Cheyenne and Arapaho, the United States recognized that the Cheyenne and Arapaho held a vast territory encompassing the lands between the North Platte River and the Arkansas River, and eastward from the Rocky Mountains to western Kansas. This area included present-day southeastern Wyoming, southwestern Nebraska, most of eastern Colorado, and the westernmost portions of Kansas.

In November 1858, however, the discovery of gold in the Rocky Mountains in Colorado, then part of the Kansas Territory, brought on the Pikes Peak Gold Rush. Immigrants flooded across Cheyenne and Arapaho lands. They competed for resources, and some settlers tried to stay. Colorado territorial officials pressured federal authorities to redefine the extent of Indian lands in the territory, and in the fall of 1860, A.B. Greenwood, Commissioner of Indian Affairs, arrived at Bent&#x27;s New Fort, along the Arkansas River, to negotiate a new treaty.

===Native lands restricted===
On February 18, 1861, six chiefs of the Southern Cheyenne and four of the Arapaho signed the Treaty of Fort Wise with the United States, in which they ceded most of the lands designated to them by the Fort Laramie treaty. The Cheyenne chiefs included Black Kettle, White Antelope (Vó&#x27;kaa&#x27;e Ohvó&#x27;komaestse), Lean Bear, Little Wolf, and Tall Bear; the Arapaho chiefs included Little Raven, Storm, Shave-Head, Big Mouth, and Niwot, or Left Hand. The Cheyenne warriors denounced the chiefs who signed the treaty and even threatened them with death if they attempted to carry out the treaty&#x27;s provisions.

The new reserve, less than 1/13 the size of the territory recognized in the 1851 treaty, was located in eastern Colorado, between the Arkansas River and Sand Creek. Most bands of the Cheyenne, including the Dog Soldiers, a militaristic band of Cheyenne and Lakota that had originated in the late 1830s, were angry at the chiefs who had signed the treaty. They disavowed the treaty—which never received the blessing of the Council of 44, the supreme tribal authority—and refused to abide by its constraints. They continued to live and hunt in the bison-rich lands of what&#x27;s now eastern Colorado and western Kansas, and became increasingly belligerent over the tide of white migration across their lands. Tensions were high, particularly in the Smoky Hill River country of Kansas, along which whites had opened a new trail to the gold fields. Cheyenne who opposed the treaty said it had been signed by a small minority of the chiefs without the consent or approval of the rest of the tribe, that the signatories had not understood what they signed, and that they had been bribed to sign by a large distribution of gifts. Officials took the position that Indians who refused to abide by it were hostile and planning a war. The Cheyenne started committing minor offenses in 1861. These offenses went unpunished and, subsequently, became more significant. The desire for war was so strong with the Cheyenne that Agent Lorey urged Governor John Evans to treat the Cheyenne anew in 1863. As agreed, Governor Evans went out to meet with the chiefs, but they did not show up to the appointed place. The governor sent his guide, Elbridge Gerry, out to try to find the chiefs. Gerry returned two weeks later saying that a council had been held wherein the chiefs decided not to meet with Governor Evans. Bull Bear offered to meet with the governor, but his warriors would not allow it.

===Escalation of hostilities===
At the end of 1863 and in the beginning of 1864, word was received that a coalition was to be formed among the plains tribes to &quot;drive the whites out of the country.&quot; In the spring and summer of 1864, the Sioux, Comanches, Kiowas, Cheyennes, and Arapahos were engaged in active hostilities which led to the murder of numerous civilians, the destruction of livestock and crops, supplies to the region being cut off, and the Colorado settlers in danger of starvation or murder at the hands of the plains tribes.

On April 12, men of the 1st Colorado Cavalry Regiment attacked Cheyenne men near Frémont&#x27;s Orchard without any first attempt at parley or peace.

On April 13, a herdsman working for Irving, Jackmann &amp; Company reported that Cheyennes and Arapahos had driven off 60 oxen and 12 horses and mules from their camp south of Denver. George Bent (a half-Cheyenne, half-white man who survived the ensuing Sand Creek Massacre along with other members of his family and tribe) disputes this version of the story. According to Bent, &quot;One day in April some Cheyennes from one of these camps were out hunting and found a number of oxen straying about among the sand hills. As they did not know to whom the animals belonged they drove them to camp, intending to keep them until someone could lay claim to them... The Indians had no use for the oxen; there were plenty of buffalo on that range that winter, and the Indians never would eat &quot;tame meat&quot; when they could get buffalo.&quot;

A small contingent of soldiers, led by Lieutenant Clark Dunn, was sent to repossess the livestock. The ensuing confrontation resulted in the death of four of the soldiers, and the tribes maintained possession of the stolen livestock.

Lieutenant George Eayre was also sent to find and demand return of the oxen. If the animals&#x27; return was refused, Eayre was to attack the camp. Without following the order to first parley, Eayre and his men burned and plundered Crow Chief&#x27;s camp of seventy lodges, which they abandoned once they were alerted to the approach of Eayre&#x27;s forces. Eayre&#x27;s men then found, plundered, and burned Chief Coon&#x27;s camp (which Coon&#x27;s band had likewise fled after being alerted of Eayre&#x27;s approach by their scouts).

On May 16, less than 15 months after meeting President Lincoln in Washington, Lean Bear, Black Kettle, and others in the tribe were camping on their buffalo hunting grounds near Ash Creek. The 1st Colorado Regiment, under the command of Lieutenant George Eayre, approached the group. Positive that this would be a peaceful encounter, Lean Bear went alone to meet the militia to show his peaceful intentions. On his chest, Lean Bear proudly wore his peace medal that he had received on his trip to Washington D.C. in 1863. In his hand, he held an official document signed by Lincoln stating that he was peaceful and friendly with whites. What Lean Bear did not realize was that Eayre&#x27;s troops were operating under orders from Colonel John M. Chivington to &quot;kill Cheyennes whenever and wherever found.&quot; Eayre ordered his men to shoot Lean Bear, who was wounded and fell off his horse. He was then shot repeatedly by the soldiers as they rode past his body on the ground. Newspaper reports and books from the era report that Cheyenne warriors attacked settlers and committed a number of atrocities in the summer of 1864 including the June 11 Hungate massacre.

The beginning of the American Civil War in 1861 led to the organization of military forces in Colorado Territory. However, the attention of the federal government was firmly fixed on defeating the Confederates. As a result, there was no significant military protection of wagon trains, settlers, settlements, communication lines, and supply wagons in the region. By the summer of 1864, nearly every stage was being attacked, emigrants were being cut off, and settlements were being raided continually. The settlers abandoned their farms and ranches and began seeking refuge in the major settlements such as Denver. A coordinated attack was carried out on August 8, 1864, where all the existing stage lines in the region were attacked. Between August 11 and September 7, Governor Evans sent multiple letters to Secretary of War Edward Stanton in an attempt to furnish military aid, but Stanton was unable to pull the Second Colorado Volunteers, led by Colonel Ford, off of the eastern Civil War front. As a result of the repeated calls for aid, authorization was granted to call up &quot;one-hundred-days&#x27; men&quot; to form the Third Colorado Volunteers.

In 1864, before the events of the Massacre of Sand Creek, there were 32 Indian attacks on record. These resulted in the death of 96 settlers, 21 being wounded, and eight being captured. Between 250 and 300 head of livestock were stolen, 12 wagon trains and stagecoaches were attacked, robbed, or destroyed, and nine ranches and settlements were raided. An exact number is unknown. It is likely higher. George Bent, a Dog Soldier in Black Kettle’s camp, wrote about going on wagon train raids. “Cheyennes made good many raids towards Denver” (Bent to Hyde 5-3-1905).

George Bent, a half-Cheyenne, who was a Dog Soldier(Warrior) in Black Kettle’s camp at Sand Creek, wrote letters to historians about the Cheyenne way of life and his experience at Sand Creek. He called Sand Creek a battle. “ I went to different lodges to shake hands with Black Kettle, Little Robe, Bear Tongue, Red Moon and lot of my friends that I was with at battle of Sand Creek that were going back with Black Kettle (George Bent to George Hyde, 1/12/1906).

===Warning of reckless violence by the U.S. volunteers===
On June 15, 1864, Major T.I. McKenny, Assistant Adjutant-General of the Department of Kansas warned his superior, General Samuel Ryan Curtis that a few more reckless murders of Indians by the Volunteers risked uniting the various tribes into a general war against the US Army:

===Governor Evans promises war===
As the conflict between the Indians and settlers and soldiers in Colorado continued, the tribes would make war during the spring and summer months until subsistence became difficult to obtain. The tribes would then earnestly seek to make peace during the winter months, when they would stock up on supplies, arms, and munitions, until fairer weather would return and the war could be commenced anew. In July 1864, Colorado Governor John Evans sent a circular to the Plains Indians, inviting those who were friendly to go to a place of safety at Fort Lyon on the eastern plains, where their people would be given provisions and protection by the United States troops. The circular itself was dated June 27, 1864. It was not until three months later, September 28, that the Cheyenne came to Denver to have peace talks with Governor Evans. At this conference, the chiefs were told by Governor Evans that peace was not possible at that point and that &quot;whatever peace they make must be with the soldiers, and not with me.&quot; At this council, White Antelope said that he feared the soldiers might kill some of his people while he was there. Governor Evans told him that there was great danger of it, and then he told White Antelope that one of the military chiefs (Colonel Chivington) was present and could tell the tribes what was necessary to secure peace. Governor Evans made clear that the purpose of the circular was not to extend peace, but rather it was an attempt to bring in the Indians who were friendly and were exposed to repudiation by the other tribes as a result. The messages given by the white negotiators at the September 28th meeting were highly contradictory. On the one hand, Governor Evans told the chiefs, &quot;The time when you can make war best is in the summer; when I can make war best is in the winter. You, so far, have had the advantage. My time is just coming.&quot; On the other hand, Colonel Chivington told the assembled Chiefs that if they sought peace, they should come to Fort Lyon and be under the protection of Major Wynkoop. 652 Arapahos led by Chief Little Raven appeared at Fort Lyon beginning around November 6, 1864, and were subsisted there by Major Anthony who had replaced Wynkoop. Later, when 600 Cheyenne appeared at the fort in a similar manner they were turned away and denied subsistence by Major Anthony.

== Attack ==
===The Cheyenne camp near Fort Lyon===
Black Kettle, leading chief of around 163 mostly Southern Cheyenne, had led his band, joined by some Arapahos under Chief Niwot, to Fort Lyon in compliance with provisions of a peace parley held in Denver in September 1864. After a while, the American Indians were asked to relocate to Big Sandy Creek, less than 40 miles northwest of Fort Lyon, under the threat of their safety. The Dog Soldiers, who had been responsible for many of the attacks and raids on whites, were not part of this encampment.
Most tribal warriors stood their ground, refusing to leave their home under the guise of a threat, leaving only about 75 men, plus all the women and children in the village. The men who remained were mostly too old or too young to hunt. Black Kettle flew a U.S. flag, with a white flag tied beneath it, over his lodge, as the Fort Lyon commander had advised him. This was to show he was friendly and forestall any attack by the Colorado soldiers. Peace chief Ochinee, who tried to broker peace for the Cheyenne, was among those who were killed. Ochinee and 160 other people, most of whom were children and women, were killed.

===Chivington attacks the camp===
Meanwhile, Chivington and 425 men of the 3rd Colorado Cavalry rode to Fort Lyon arriving on November 28, 1864. Once at the fort, Chivington took command of 250 men of the 1st Colorado Cavalry and maybe as many as 12 men of the 1st Regiment New Mexico Volunteer Infantry, then set out for Black Kettle&#x27;s encampment. James Beckwourth, a noted frontiersman who had lived with the Indians for half a century, acted as guide for Chivington. Prior to the massacre, several of Anthony&#x27;s officers were not eager to join in the attack. Captain Silas Soule, Lieutenant Joseph Cramer and Lieutenant James Connor protested that attacking a peaceful camp would violate the pledge of safety provided to the Indians and would dishonor the uniform of the Army.

The following morning, Chivington gave the order to attack. Two officers, Captain Silas Soule and Lieutenant Joseph Cramer, commanding Company D and Company K of the First Colorado Cavalry, refused to obey and told their men to hold fire. However, the rest of Chivington&#x27;s men immediately attacked the village. Ignoring the U.S. flag and a white flag that was run up shortly after the attack began, they murdered as many of the Indians as they could.



The natives, lacking artillery, could not make much resistance. Some of the natives cut horses from the camp&#x27;s herd and fled up Sand Creek or to a nearby Cheyenne camp on the headwaters of the Smoky Hill River. Others, including the half-Cheyenne, half-white trader George Bent, fled upstream and dug holes in the sand beneath the banks of the stream. They were pursued by the troops and fired on, but many survived. Cheyenne warrior Morning Star said that most of the Indian dead were killed by cannon fire, especially those firing from the south bank of the river at the people retreating up the creek.

In testimony before a Congressional committee investigating the massacre, Chivington claimed that as many as 500 to 600 Indian warriors were killed. Historian Alan Brinkley wrote that 133 Indians were killed, 105 of whom were women and children. White eyewitness John S. Smith reported that 70 to 80 Indians were killed, including 20 to 30 warriors, which agrees with Brinkley&#x27;s figure as to the number of men killed. George Bent, the son of the American William Bent and a Cheyenne mother, who was in the village when the attack came and was wounded by the soldiers, gave two different accounts of the natives&#x27; loss. On March 15, 1889, he wrote to Samuel F. Tappan that 137 people were killed: 28 men and 109 women and children. However, on April 30, 1913, when he was very old, he wrote that &quot;about 53 men&quot; and &quot;110 women and children&quot; were killed and many people wounded.

Although initial reports indicated 10 soldiers killed and 38 wounded, the final tally was 4 killed and 21 wounded in the 1st Colorado Cavalry and 20 killed or mortally wounded and 31 other wounded in the 3rd Colorado Cavalry; adding up to 24 killed and 52 wounded. Dee Brown wrote that some of Chivington&#x27;s men were drunk and that many of the soldiers&#x27; casualties were due to friendly fire, but neither of these claims is supported by Gregory F. Michno or Stan Hoig in their books devoted to the massacre.

Before Chivington and his men left the area, they plundered the teepees and took the horses. After the smoke cleared, Chivington&#x27;s men came back and killed many of the wounded. They also scalped many of the dead, regardless of whether they were women, children, or infants. Chivington and his men dressed their weapons, hats, and gear with scalps and other body parts, including human fetuses and male and female genitalia. They also publicly displayed these battle trophies in Denver&#x27;s Apollo Theater and area saloons. Three Indians who remained in the village are known to have survived the massacre: George Bent&#x27;s brother Charlie Bent, and two Cheyenne women who were later turned over to William Bent. According to western author and historian Larry McMurtry, the son of Chivington&#x27;s scout John Smith (by an Indian mother) was in the camp, survived the attack and was &quot;executed&quot; afterward.

== Aftermath ==
The Sand Creek Massacre resulted in a heavy loss of life, mostly among Cheyenne and Arapaho women and children. The hardest hit by the massacre were the Wutapiu, Black Kettle&#x27;s band. Perhaps half of the Hevhaitaniu were lost, including the chiefs Yellow Wolf and Big Man. The Oivimana, led by War Bonnet, lost about half their number. There were heavy losses to the Hisiometanio (Ridge Men) under White Antelope. Chief One Eye was also killed, along with many of his band. The Suhtai clan and the Heviqxnipahis clan under chief Sand Hill experienced relatively few losses. The Dog Soldiers and the Masikota, who by that time had allied, were not present at Sand Creek. Of about 10 lodges of Arapaho under Chief Left Hand, representing about 50 or 60 people, only a handful escaped with their lives.

After hiding all day above the camp in holes dug beneath the bank of Sand Creek, the survivors there, many of whom were wounded, moved up the stream and spent the night on the prairie. Trips were made to the site of the camp but very few survivors were found there. After a cold night without shelter, the survivors set out toward the Cheyenne camp on the headwaters of the Smoky Hill River. They soon met up with other survivors who had escaped with part of the horse herd, some returning from the Smoky Hill camp where they had fled during the attack. They then proceeded to the camp, where they received assistance.

The massacre disrupted the traditional Cheyenne power structure, because of the deaths of eight members of the Council of Forty-Four. White Antelope, One Eye, Yellow Wolf, Big Man, Bear Man, War Bonnet, Spotted Crow, and Bear Robe were all killed, as were the headmen of some of the Cheyenne military societies. Among the chiefs killed were most of those who had advocated peace with white settlers and the U.S. government. The net effect of the murders and ensuing weakening of the peace faction exacerbated the developing social and political rift. Traditional council chiefs, mature men who sought consensus and looked to the future of their people, and their followers, were opposed by the younger and more militaristic Dog Soldiers.

Beginning in the 1830s, the Dog Soldiers had evolved from a Cheyenne military society of that name into a separate band of Cheyenne and Lakota warriors. They took as their territory the area around the headwaters of the Republican and Smoky Hill rivers in southern Nebraska, northern Kansas, and the northeastern Colorado Territory. By the 1860s, as the conflict between natives and encroaching whites intensified, the Dog Soldiers and military societies within other Cheyenne bands countered the influence of the traditional Council of Forty-Four chiefs who, as more mature men, took a larger view and were more likely to favor peace with the whites. To the Dog Soldiers, the Sand Creek massacre illustrated the folly of the peace chiefs&#x27; policy of accommodating the whites through treaties such as the first Treaty of Fort Laramie and the Treaty of Fort Wise. They believed their militant position toward the whites was justified by the massacre.

The events at Sand Creek dealt a fatal blow to the traditional Cheyenne clan system and the authority of its Council of Chiefs. It had already been weakened by the numerous deaths due to the 1849 cholera epidemic, which killed perhaps half the Southern Cheyenne population, especially the Masikota and Oktoguna bands. It was further weakened by the emergence of the separate Dog Soldiers band.

=== Retaliation ===
After the brutal slaughter of those who supported peace, many of the Cheyenne, including the great warrior Roman Nose, and many Arapaho joined the Dog Soldiers. They sought revenge on settlers throughout the Platte valley, including an 1865 attack on what became Fort Caspar, Wyoming.

Following the massacre, the survivors reached the camps of the Cheyenne on the Smokey Hill and Republican rivers. The war pipe was smoked and passed from camp to camp among the Sioux, Cheyenne, and Arapaho warriors in the area. In January 1865, they planned and carried out an attack with 1,000 warriors on the stage station and fort, then called Camp Rankin, at present-day Julesburg, Colorado. This was followed by numerous raids along the South Platte both east and west of Julesburg, and a second raid on the town of Julesburg in early February. The bulk of the Indians then moved north into Nebraska on their way to the Black Hills and the Powder River Country.

Black Kettle continued to speak for peace and did not join in the second raid or in the journey to the Powder River country. He left the camp and returned with 80 lodges to the Arkansas River to seek peace with the Coloradans.

=== Official investigations ===
Initially, the Sand Creek engagement was reported as a victory against a brave and numerous foe. Within weeks, however, witnesses and survivors began telling stories of a possible massacre. Several investigations were conducted—two by the military, and one by the Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War. The panel declared:

Statements taken by Major Edward W. Wynkoop and his adjutant substantiated the later accounts of survivors. These statements were filed with his reports and can be found in the &quot;Official Records of the War of the Rebellion&quot;, copies of which were submitted as evidence in the Joint Committee of the Conduct of the War and in separate hearings conducted by the military in Denver. Lieutenant James D. Cannon describes the mutilation of human genitalia by the soldiers, &quot;men, women, and children&#x27;s privates cut out. I heard one man say that he had cut a woman&#x27;s private parts out and had them for exhibition on a stick. I heard of one instance of a child, a few months old, being thrown into the feed-box of a wagon, and after being carried some distance, left on the ground to perish; I also heard of numerous instances in which men had cut out the private parts of females and stretched them over their saddle-bows, and some of them over their hats.&quot;

During these investigations, numerous witnesses came forward with damning testimony, almost all of which was corroborated by other witnesses. One witness, Captain Silas Soule, who had ordered the men under his command not to fire their weapons, was murdered in Denver just weeks after offering his testimony. “Before I got into the creek there were troops upon both sides firing across. It was unsafe for me to take my command up the creek,” Soule testified. He only testified about his concern for crossfire; he never testified that he refused to fight.

However, despite the Joint Committee on the Conduct of the Wars&#x27; recommendation, no charges were brought against those who committed the massacre. Chivington was beyond the reach of army justice because he had already resigned his commission. The closest thing to a punishment he suffered was the effective end of his political aspirations.

A monument installed on the Colorado State Capitol grounds in 1909 lists Sand Creek as one of the &quot;battles and engagements&quot; fought by Colorado troops in the American Civil War. In 2002, the Colorado Historical Society (now History Colorado), authorized by the Colorado General Assembly, added an additional plaque to the monument, which states that the original designers of the monument &quot;mischaracterized&quot; Sand Creek by calling it a battle.

=== Little Arkansas Treaty ===
After the actual details of the massacre became widely known, the United States federal government sent a blue ribbon commission whose members were respected by the Indians, and the Treaty of the Little Arkansas was signed in 1865. It promised the Indians free access to the lands south of the Arkansas River, excluded them from the Arkansas River north to the Platte River, and promised land and cash reparations to the surviving descendants of Sand Creek victims.

However, the treaty was abrogated by Washington less than two years later, all major provisions were ignored, and instead, the Medicine Lodge Treaty reduced the reservation lands by 90 percent, located in much less desirable sites in Oklahoma. Later government actions further reduced the size of the reservations.

== Remembrance ==

A site, on Big Sandy Creek in Kiowa County, is now preserved by the National Park Service. The Sand Creek Massacre National Historic Site was dedicated on April 28, 2007, almost 142 years after the massacre. The American Battlefield Trust and its partners preserved of Sand Creek and deeded it to the national historic site.

The precise location of the National Park Service historic site is disputed by Chuck and Mike Bowen in their self-published book. According to National Park Service, the Indians were camped below the bluff of today&#x27;s historic site and they did not see the soldiers coming. Yet no period artifacts have been found below that bluff, whereas over 4,000 artifacts have been found starting about two miles up the creek from the NPS site on private property belonging to the Bowen family. It is there where Black Kettle and the Indians were camped. According to George Bent, the Indians saw the soldiers coming from miles away. Little Bear got up early in the morning and crossed the dry creek bed to get his horse. From a high hill, he looked south toward the Fort Lyon Trail and saw approaching soldiers that looked like a long black line on the horizon, (Bent to Hyde 4-14-1906).

An exhibit about Sand Creek, titled &quot;Collision: The Sand Creek Massacre 1860s–Today&quot;, opened in 2012 with the new History Colorado Center in Denver. The exhibit immediately drew criticism from members of the Northern Cheyenne tribe. In April 2013, History Colorado agreed to close the exhibit to public view while consultations were made with the Northern Cheyenne.

On December 3, 2014, Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper formally apologized to descendants of Sand Creek massacre victims gathered in Denver to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the event. Hickenlooper stated, &quot;We should not be afraid to criticize and condemn that which is inexcusable. ... On behalf of the State of Colorado, I want to apologize. We will not run from this history.&quot;

In 2015, construction of a memorial to the Sand Creek Massacre victims began on the Colorado Capitol grounds.

In October 2022, it was announced that almost would be added to the National Historic Site to preserve for the tribes. &quot;The Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes are excited to see the additional 3,478 acres to the Sand Creek Massacre National Historic Site which is providing security for the protection of our Sacred site,&quot; said Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes Governor Reggie Wassana in a statement. President Biden&#x27;s Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland announced of the preservation, &quot;It is our solemn responsibility at the Department of the Interior, as caretakers of America&#x27;s national treasures, to tell the story of our nation. The events that took place here forever changed the course of the Northern Cheyenne, Northern Arapaho, and Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes.&quot;

==In popular culture==
The Sand Creek massacre has been depicted or referenced in multiple works, spanning a variety of media:
===Comics===

*The 30th chapter of Italian comic book saga &quot;Storia del West&quot; written by Gino D&#x27;Antonio, depicts themes of the massacre.

===Films===
The massacre has been portrayed in several western movies, including &quot;Tomahawk&quot; (1951), &quot;Massacre at Sand Creek&quot; (&quot;Playhouse 90&quot;) (1956), &quot;The Guns of Fort Petticoat&quot; (1957), &quot;Soldier Blue&quot; (1970), &quot;The Last Warrior&quot; (1970), &quot;Young Guns&quot; (1988), and &quot;Last of the Dogmen&quot; (1995). &quot;Little Big Man&quot; (1970), a much more famous and successful movie has an early scene of the Sand Creek Massacre. The Dustin Hoffman character saves a Cheyenne woman giving birth after watching her husband killed by the white soldiers. He then returns to his old tribe with her and takes her as his wife.

The massacre is referenced by Trevor Slattery in &quot;Iron Man 3&quot; (2013).

<doc id="209882" wikidata="Q724969" url="?curid=209882" title="Donald Tovey">
<text>Sir Donald Francis Tovey (17 July 187510 July 1940) was a British musical analyst, musicologist, writer on music, composer, conductor and pianist. He had been best known for his &quot;Essays in Musical Analysis&quot; and his editions of works by Bach and Beethoven, but since the 1990s his compositions (relatively small in number but substantial in musical content) have been recorded and performed with increasing frequency. The recordings have mostly been well received by reviewers.

==Life==
He was born at Eton, Berkshire, the son of Duncan Crookes Tovey, an assistant master at Eton College, and his wife, Mary Fison. As a child Tovey was privately educated exclusively by Sophie Weisse. She was impressed by his musical gifts evident at an early age and took it upon herself to nurture him. Through her network of associates he was introduced to composers, performers and music critics. These included Walter Parratt, James Higgs and (from the age of 14) Hubert Parry for composition. In 1898, Tovey graduated from Balliol College at Oxford University, where he had studied the classics and developed his interest in music, particularly that of Bach.

When Tovey was seven or eight years old, he met violinist Joseph Joachim, another acquaintance of Weisse. Tovey played piano with the Joachim Quartet in a 1905 performance of Brahms&#x27;s Piano Quintet, in F minor, Op. 34. By then Tovey was already composing and had gained some moderate fame, with works performed in Berlin, Vienna, and London. His large scale Piano Concerto (with Tovey as soloist) made its debut at Queen&#x27;s Hall in November 1903 under the baton of Sir Henry Wood, and Tovey played it again in 1906 under Hans Richter. 

During this period he also contributed heavily to the 1911 &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;, writing many of the articles on music of the 18th and 19th centuries.In 1914, he began to teach music at the University of Edinburgh, succeeding Frederick Niecks as Reid Professor of Music; there he founded the Reid Orchestra. For their concerts he wrote a series of programme notes, many of which were eventually collected into the books for which he is now best known, the &quot;Essays in Musical Analysis&quot;. In 1917, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were Ralph Allan Sampson, Cargill Gilston Knott, John Horne and Sir Edmund Taylor Whittaker.
As he devoted more and more time to the Reid Orchestra, to writing essays and commentaries and producing performing editions of Bach and Beethoven, Tovey composed and performed less often later in life; but the few major pieces he did complete are on a large scale, such as his Symphony of 1913 and the Cello Concerto completed in 1935 for his longtime friend Pablo Casals. Performing also became problematic. In illustrated radio talks recorded in his last few years, his playing is severely affected by a problem with one of his hands.

Tovey made several editions of other composers&#x27; music, including a 1931 completion of Bach&#x27;s &quot;Die Kunst der Fuge&quot; (The Art of Fugue). His edition of the 48 Preludes and Fugues of Bach&#x27;s &quot;The Well-Tempered Clavier&quot;, in two volumes (Vol. 1, March 1924; Vol. 2, June 1924), with fingerings by Harold Samuel, for the Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music, has been reprinted continually ever since. His completion of the (presumed) final unfinished fugue in &quot;The Art of Fugue&quot; has nothing of pastiche about it, and in fact has often been recorded as the final piece of the set. His influential &quot;Essays in Musical Analysis&quot; based on his Reid Orchestra programme notes, were first published at this time, in six volumes between 1935 and 1939. They were edited by Hubert Foss of the Oxford University Press. 
He was knighted by King George V in 1935, reportedly on the recommendation of Sir Edward Elgar, who greatly admired Tovey&#x27;s edition of Bach. He died in 1940 in Edinburgh. His archive, including scores, letters, handwritten programme notes and annotations in the scores of others, is housed in the Special Collections Unit of the University of Edinburgh library. In 2009 Richard Witts created a simple catalogue of the archival material available from the University on-line.

==Family==

Tovey married his first wife, Margaret &quot;Grettie&quot; Cameron, the daughter of Hugh Cameron R.S.A., on 22 April 1916. In May 1919 they adopted an infant son, their only child, whom they named John Wellcome Tovey. Following a tumultuous relationship, in part strained by Cameron&#x27;s mental health issues, the couple divorced in July 1922. She died a few years later. On the divorce from his first wife, Tovey&#x27;s son John was placed under the guardianship of Weisse and Clara Georgina Wallace, who had also been a pupil of Weisse and known to Tovey since boyhood.

Clara Wallace and Tovey married on 29 December 1925. She became Lady Tovey upon his knighthood in 1935. They appear to have had a supportive marriage, often travelling together for Tovey&#x27;s domestic and international engagements. They remained together until his death in 1940. Lady Tovey died in September 1944 at Hedenham Lodge, Norfolk.

== Compositions ==

From the start, the Teutonic heavy seriousness and traditional craftsmanship of Tovey&#x27;s first concert works in the early 1900s felt somewhat old-fashioned amidst the early stages of the English Musical Renaissance, but they did find more favour on the continent. His official opus 1, the four movement Piano Trio in B minor was already composed on a large scale. It was completed in 1895 during Tovey&#x27;s first term at Balliol and dedicated &quot;to Sir Hubert Parry as the first work of a grateful pupil&quot;. There were other chamber works during this period, most of them including a piano part for Tovey to play himself: from 1900 he energetically promoted them through a series of regular chamber music performances. Early successes, receiving positive press notices, included the Piano Quintet in C, Op. 6, first performed at St James&#x27;s Hall in London on 8 November 1900, and the Piano Quartet in E minor, Op. 12, played at the same hall on 21 November 1901. &quot;The Times&quot; judged him &quot;a composer with serious aims and a very high standard&quot;, although the quartet &quot;was written in a somewhat sombre vein&quot;.

His patron Sophie Weisse helped fund his concert appearances, and also financed the publication of his epic, but not overtly virtuosic Piano Concerto in A major, Op. 15 in 1903 (though significantly it was published in Germany, not in Britain). The Concerto, with its particularly expressive F minor adagio movement, was first performed on 4 November 1903 by the Queen&#x27;s Hall Orchestra, conducted by Sir Henry Wood, with Tovey himself as the soloist. (Tovey also performed Mozart&#x27;s Piano Concerto in C major, K.503, at the same concert). It was successfully revived in 1906 under Richter, and again in 1913 in Aachen, Germany under Fritz Busch.

Weisse also funded the publication of Tovey&#x27;s early chamber works between 1906 and 1913, including the two String Quartets, Opp. 23 and 24 (both composed in 1909) and his fourth and final Piano Trio in D major, Op. 27 of 1910. But the most significant new work after the Piano Concerto was another full-scale orchestral piece. The Symphony in D, Op.32, commissioned by Busch after the success of the Piano Concerto performance in Aachen, was written under great time pressure in 1913 and first performed in Aachen under Busch on 11 December 1913. A London performance (by the London Symphony Orchestra) followed on 31 May 1915. However, further performances were few. Tovey made small revisions in 1923. It was revived in Edinburgh and broadcast by the BBC on 25 February 1937 with the composer conducting the Reid Orchestra. A modern recording was not issued until 2006.

From 1914 his academic career took precedence over composition, although his sense of isolation from more modernist trends may also have contributed to the silence. The &quot;Bride of Dionysus&quot;, an ambitious music drama based on the Greek legend, was begun in 1907, using a text written by his friend R. C. Trevelyan. It took over ten years for Tovey to complete it, and then it had to wait a further decade before its premiere in 1929. There was very little else after that apart from the Cello Concerto, Op. 40, begun in 1933 for Pablo Casals, and first performed by him on 22 November 1934 in Usher Hall, Edinburgh. &quot;The Times&quot; described it as &quot;a work of considerable power and beauty&quot;, but the subsequent London performances, on 11 and 12 November 1935, were ill-prepared and the press notices were negative. Famously, in reviewing a later Queen&#x27;s Hall performance and broadcast on 17 November 1937 Constant Lambert commented that &quot;the first movement...seemed to last as long as my first term at school&quot;.

== Tovey as a theorist of tonality ==
Tovey&#x27;s belief that classical music has an aesthetic that can be deduced from the internal evidence of the music itself has influenced subsequent writers on music. In his essays, Tovey developed a theory of tonal structure and its relation to classical forms that he applied in his descriptions of pieces in his famous programme notes for the Reid Orchestra, as well as in more technical and extended writings. His aesthetic regards works of music as organic wholes, and he stresses the importance of understanding how musical principles manifest themselves in different ways within the context of a given piece. He was fond of using figurative comparisons to illustrate his ideas, as in this quotation from the &quot;Essays&quot; (on Brahms&#x27; Handel Variations, Op. 24, Tovey 1922):

The relation between Beethoven&#x27;s freest variations and his theme is of the same order of microscopical accuracy and profundity as the relation of a bat&#x27;s wing to a human hand.

Similarly in his book on &quot;Beethoven&quot;, dictated in 1936 but published posthumously in 1944:

We do not expect a return to the home tonic to be associated with a theme we have never heard before, any more than we expect on returning from our holiday to find our house completely redecorated and refurnished and inhabited by total strangers.
== Recordings ==
* Recordings of Tovey performing on piano were made for the National Gramophonic Society (NGS-114-117) on 6 and 11 June, and 4 September 1928, playing Tovey&#x27;s conjectural completion of Bach&#x27;s &quot;The Art of Fugue&quot;, Bach&#x27;s Sonata No. 2 in A Major BWV1015 (1st mvt), and Beethoven&#x27;s 10th Violin Sonata in G major, Op. 96 (complete) with violinist Adila Fachiri. The latter is the celebrated recording in which, on the first side after the first movement exposition, Tovey calls out, &quot;Return to the beginning of the record; second time...&quot; and then resumes playing, so that the listener can take the repeat or omit it, at her/his discretion. The Columbia recording of &quot;The Art of Fugue&quot; with the Roth String Quartet (1934–1935) has Tovey&#x27;s conjectural completion of the work, played by Tovey on the piano, on the last 78 side.

<text>The Marias Massacre (also known as the Baker Massacre or the Piegan Massacre) was a massacre of Piegan Blackfeet Native peoples which was committed by United States Army forces under Major Eugene Mortimer Baker as part of the Indian Wars. The massacre occurred on January 23, 1870, in Montana Territory. Approximately 200 Native people were killed, most of whom were women, children, and older men.

As part of a campaign to suppress Mountain Chief&#x27;s band of Piegan Blackfeet, the U.S. Army attacked a different band led by Chief Heavy Runner, to whom the United States government had previously promised their protection. This resulted in public outrage and a long-term shift towards a &quot;Peace Policy&quot; by the Federal Government, as advocated by President Ulysses S. Grant. Grant kept the Bureau of Indian Affairs as a division of the Department of the Interior although the War Department was trying to regain control. He then appointed men recommended by various religious clergy—including Quakers and Methodists—as Indian agents, in hopes that they would be free of the corruption he had previously found in the department.

==Background==
Relations between the Niitsitapi Confederacy (composed of Blackfeet, Blood, and Piegan tribes, although frequently referred to simply as Blackfeet) and white settlers in Montana Territory had been largely hostile for years, as European Americans encroached on Native American territory and resources. In turn, some Blackfeet stole horses and raided white settlements. Rather than a widespread, organized conflict, such as Red Cloud&#x27;s War, a series of unrelated clashes marked the relations between the groups. By 1870, the Blackfeet had largely retreated north of the Marias River in the territory.

=== Malcolm Clarke ===
Malcolm Clarke was a rancher and fur trader who worked in association with the American Fur Company (AFC). Before his life in the West, Malcolm Clarke had attended West Point until he was expelled for fighting.  During his time there, he became friends with classmate William Sherman, although they lost touch after he left school. Clarke found success trading with Blackfeet tribes and eventually married a Native woman named &quot;Coth-co-co-na&quot; and had four children—Helen, Horace, Nathan, and Isabel. This marriage served as an alliance between Malcolm and the Blackfoot tribe, prolonging his fur trade with the tribe.

Clarke frequently argued with prominent AFC member Owen McKenzie throughout his trading career. This interpersonal conflict ultimately led to Clarke murdering McKenzie. After the murder, Clarke left the fur trading business out of fear of retribution from other traders, as well as the decline of the fur trade during the 1860s due to the dwindling population of bison. Clarke then moved his family to the Rocky Mountains and undertook ranching with his second wife, a mixed-race Blackfoot woman named Good Singing. They established the Clarke Horse and Cattle Ranch in 1864.

=== Murder of Malcolm Clarke ===
The inciting incident of the Marias Massacre was the murder of Malcolm Clarke on August 17, 1869. He was killed by Owl Child—a young Piegan warrior—and his comrades at the Clarke Ranch. Two years prior, in 1867, Owl Child had stolen horses from Clarke as payback for losing his horses, which he blamed on the trader. Consequently, Clarke and his son, Horace, beat and humiliated Owl Child in front of a group of Blackfeet. There were accounts from Blackfeet claiming Clarke had also raped Owl Child&#x27;s wife, who was a cousin of &quot;Coth-co-co-na&quot;. Other Blackfeet oral histories state that Owl Child&#x27;s wife became pregnant from the assault, and gave birth to a child who was either stillborn or killed by tribal elders. The Piegan warriors first shot and severely wounded Horace, who survived. They then proceeded to the house, where they shot Clarke in the chest before Owl Child ultimately killed him with an ax. Clarke&#x27;s other children and his wife took shelter in the house unharmed.

Clarke&#x27;s murder created a climate of unrest in the region, as outraged white settlers demanded that the government protect them and suppress the outlaw Blackfeet. In response, the U.S. Army demanded that the Blackfoot Confederacy execute Owl Child and deliver his body to them in two weeks. Owl Child fled North and joined Mountain Chief&#x27;s Piegan band, which, although known for their hostility toward white settlers, did not conduct raids on the settlements.

When the two-week deadline had passed, General Philip Sheridan sent a squadron of cavalry from the Second Cavalry Regiment, led by Major Eugene Baker, to track down and punish the offending party. Sheridan ordered:

If the lives and property of the citizens of Montana can best be protected by striking Mountain Chief&#x27;s band, I want them struck. Tell Baker to strike them hard.

Sheridan intended that the squadron conduct a dawn attack on the Piegan village; it had snowed heavily, and most of the Blackfeet would be sleeping or staying inside to keep warm. This was a strategy he had used before, as he had directed George Custer to attack Black Kettle&#x27;s band of Cheyenne in the Battle of Washita River. Following their father&#x27;s death, Nathan and Horace Clarke intercepted the Second cavalry as they passed through the Prickly Pear Valley and received permission from Colonel Philippe Regis de Trobriand to join the expedition. The two sought revenge for their father and made their expedition known to the press.

==The massacre ==
A command led by Major Eugene M. Baker left Fort Ellis on January 6, 1870, and stopped at Fort Shaw to pick up two more companies, including scouts Joe Kipp and Joseph Cobell who were familiar with the Piegan bands. These scouts were critical to distinguishing between the unfriendly and friendly Piegan bands, as Baker was to refrain from attacking the friendly bands. Baker needed to wait until Sheridan&#x27;s division inspector general Colonel James A. Hardie reviewed the situation and reported back to him.

Based on Hardie&#x27;s January 13 report, Sheridan issued an order to &quot;strike them hard&quot;. Baker&#x27;s command, consisting of four companies of the 2nd U.S. Cavalry, and 55 mounted men of the 13th U.S. Infantry, moved North from Fort Shaw on January 19, looking for Mountain Chief&#x27;s band, which was purportedly located in the Marias River country.

Baker&#x27;s command came across a small Piegan camp on January 22 and captured the occupants. These prisoners informed Baker that the Big Horn and Red Horn camps—two Piegan leaders considered hostile—could be found a few miles downstream. Baker ordered a forced march that night and moved his mixed infantry and cavalry forces through rough country, locating a camp of 32 lodges in the low ground along the Marias River just South of present-day Dunkirk, Montana. Baker positioned his men on the high ground above the camp in a &quot;natural firing range&quot; and prepared to attack.

===The camp===
More than three hundred Piegan people were sleeping in Heavy Runner&#x27;s camp in the predawn hours of January 23. Smallpox had struck, and many people were suffering from the disease. Most of the healthy men had left the camp to hunt. So, on that bitterly cold morning, nearly all the camp&#x27;s occupants were women, children, or elderly.

===The shooting===
Scout Joe Kipp recognized that the camp belonged to Heavy Runner, considered peaceful and not to be attacked per orders from Fort Shaw commander Colonel Philippe Régis de Trobriand. When told that the camp belonged to Heavy Runner, Baker responded, &quot;That makes no difference, one band or another of them; they are all Piegans [Blackfeet] and we will attack them.&quot; Baker then ordered a sergeant to shoot Kipp if he tried to warn the sleeping camp of Blackfeet and gave the command to attack. Kipp shouted to try to prevent the attack, and Baker placed him under arrest.

The noise alerted the Piegan camp and Chief Heavy Runner. Heavy Runner ran toward the soldiers, &quot;shouting and waving a piece of paper—a safe conduct from the Indian Bureau.&quot; He was immediately shot and killed. Scout Joseph Cobell later took credit for shooting Heavy Runner. Cobell was married to the sister of Mountain Chief and wanted to divert attention from his brother-in-law&#x27;s camp, which he knew was about downstream. After Cobell&#x27;s first shot, the rest of Baker&#x27;s command opened fire.

From the ridges above the camp, the soldiers shot into lodges filled with sleeping people. After a while, they charged into the camp. William Birth of Company K boasted that they sliced open lodge coverings with butcher knives and shot the unarmed people inside. He said: &quot;We killed some with axes&quot; and &quot;gave them an awful massacreing. [sic]&quot;

===Survivors&#x27; accounts===
Spear Woman was six years old at the time of the massacre. She remembered waking up to the noise of barking dogs. She watched Heavy Runner run toward the troops, holding his &quot;name paper&quot; above his head. Then the soldiers began shooting. She ran into a nearby lodge and hid behind a bed backrest. While she waited, soldiers moved from lodge to lodge, killing her people. One soldier cut a hole in the lodge where she hid and shot everyone who moved.

Buffalo Trail Woman saw soldiers surround a lodge and shoot into it in unison. They then took blankets, robes, and anything else they wanted. Finally, they tore down all the tipis and set everything on fire. She saw them burn wounded people in the conflagration.

Long Time Calf escaped through the freezing waters of the Marias River, carrying her infant niece. She was eight years old.

Bear Head had gone out of the camp to catch his horses when he encountered soldiers. They took him prisoner. He saw Heavy Runner run toward the soldiers, waving a paper, and then fall as the troops opened fire. He saw soldiers shoot at the tops of lodges, cutting the bindings and collapsing them onto the fire so that they smothered and burned their occupants. He watched them do this to the lodge of his mother, Fair Singing Woman, killing her and his father&#x27;s three other wives and their four daughters. He saw them tear down all the remaining lodges, shoot the occupants, and burn everything, bodies, and lodges together. Powerless to save his family, Bear Head wished the soldiers had killed him, too. After the soldiers left, a few people returned to the camp from their hiding places in the brush. They buried the dead as best they could. Bear Head counted fifteen men, ninety women, and fifty children dead.

==Aftermath==
Learning of the raid, Mountain Chief&#x27;s band escaped over the border into Canada. Piegan oral history recounts that the U.S. Army threw every dead Native American man into a fire. A rough count by Baker&#x27;s men showed 173 dead. Only one cavalryman, Private McKay, was killed, and another soldier was injured after falling off his horse and breaking his leg. The count of casualties was disputed by scout Joe Kipp, who later said the total Blackfeet dead numbered 217.

===Conflicting reports===
Colonel Regis de Trobriand reported to his superior officers on the success of the expedition, informing them that the &quot;murderers, and marauders of last summer&quot; had been killed. Sheridan received de Trobriand&#x27;s initial report on January 29, which was then forwarded to Sherman with the promise that &quot;this will end Indian troubles in Montana.&quot; Sheridan also praised Baker&#x27;s command: &quot;The lieutenant-general cannot commend too highly the spirit and conduct of the troops and their commander and as one of the results of this severe but necessary and well-merited punishment of these Indians, he congratulates the citizens of Montana upon the prospect of future security.&quot; However, de Trobriand needed to explain why Baker had attacked the wrong camp. So, he implied that Baker had attacked a &quot;hostile&quot; camp and that Heavy Runner had been killed by &quot;his own fault&quot; because he had left the safety of the trading post in search of whiskey. According to de Trobriand, Mountain Chief had fled the camp with his followers.

Baker filed his official report on February 18. In it, he claimed that he and his men had killed 173 Indians and had captured more than 100 women and children who were later allowed to go free. He also reported capturing more than 300 horses and burning the Piegans&#x27; lodges and supplies.

Blackfeet agent William B. Pease reported the massacre to his superior, Alfred Sully, on January 30 after interviewing the expedition&#x27;s officers. Sully ordered Pease to interview survivors of the massacre. Based on his interviews with officers and survivors, Pease reported a death toll of eighteen older men, ninety women, and fifty children. According to Pease, only fifteen young men aged twelve to thirty-seven were killed. Pease further reported fifty-one Blackfeet survivors: eighteen women, nineteen children, nine young men who had escaped, and five men who had been out hunting at the time of the attack.

Pease&#x27;s report sparked public outcry. Vincent Colyer, the secretary to the Board of Indian Commissioners and a noted humanitarian, wrote a letter to board chairman Felix Brunot alerting him to Pease&#x27;s claim that only 15 men of fighting age had been killed; in contrast, the rest had been women, children, and elderly. The &quot;New York Times&quot; published the letter, it was read in the House of Representatives, and news of the massacre spread nationwide. In retaliation, de Trobriand accused Pease of slander and claimed that he had filed a false report. Pease responded by demanding a full investigation to explain the discrepancy between the military and the Piegans&#x27; versions of events.

When General Sherman received Baker&#x27;s initial report, he ordered him to give a complete account, including &quot;exactly the number, sex, and kind of Indians killed.&quot; Sherman wanted &quot;to meet the public charge that of the number killed the greatest part were squaws and children.&quot; In response, Baker claimed that his men had killed 120 &quot;able men&quot; and 53 women and children. He also reported capturing 140 women and children who were later released because of smallpox. Baker claimed, &quot;I believe that every effort was made by officers and men to save the non-combatants, and that such women and children as were killed were killed accidentally.&quot; Sherman&#x27;s order to specify the age, sex, and condition of those killed was ignored. Baker&#x27;s reports became the official military record.

The army justified Baker&#x27;s attack and portrayed him as a hero. De Trobriand claimed that many of the Piegan women had been killed by their husbands to protect them &quot;from tortures among the white men which are inflicted upon white women when captured by those Red fiends.&quot; Major General Winfield Scott Hancock claimed that it was necessary for the troops to &quot;fire into the lodges at the outset to drive the Indians out to an open contest.&quot; Hancock also claimed that fewer than forty women and children had been killed. The &quot;Army and Navy Journal&quot; editorialized that &quot;Colonel Baker&#x27;s report of his scout against the hostile Piegan and Blood Indians shows incontestably that the march itself was a heroic one.&quot; The editorial further explained that it &quot;was not known how strong the Indians might be, and huddled as they were indiscriminately in the camp, the first fury of the attack fell alike on all ages and sexes.&quot; The editorial surmised that the warriors &quot;it seems, fled; at all events, the great majority of those left were women and children.&quot;

When the Inspector General of the Military Division of the Missouri, James Allen Hardie, asked de Trobriand how they could be certain of the number, age, sex, and condition of the people killed, de Trobriand responded that &quot;Baker never know the state, age, sex or condition of the Indians he killed. How could he?&quot; De Trobriand deflected further questions by raising his estimates of casualties to 220 killed, of which 70 were warriors. This claim contradicted Baker&#x27;s earlier reports and implied 150 non-combatant deaths. Still, de Trobriand stated that the attack was a &quot;complete success.&quot; When Hardie ordered de Trobriand to interview guides Horace Clarke and Joe Kipp and mail their testimonies to him, de Trobriand ignored the order.

For his part, guide Joe Kipp claimed that he had counted 217 casualties, mostly older men, women, and children. He also claimed that Baker was drunk on the morning of the attack. When writer Frank Bird Linderman requested an interview for a story, Kipp refused because the military would hang him if he told what he knew about the massacre.

===Impact on the Blackfeet===
The conflict between settlers and the Blackfeet declined after the massacre. The Blackfoot Nation, weakened by smallpox, did not have the numbers to retaliate and feared the Americans as a brutal people. Baker&#x27;s attack facilitated the dispossession of the Blackfeet Nation. At the time of the massacre, the Blackfeet Reservation stretched across most northern Montana. In 1872 and 1873, President Grant issued executive orders reducing the size of the reservation. In 1887, Congress passed the Dawes Act, which stripped an additional 17 million acres from the Blackfeet.

===Impact on Baker&#x27;s career===
Many blamed Major Baker for the massacre, the failure to capture Mountain Chief&#x27;s band, and the failure to report the massacre&#x27;s scale accurately. The news that many in the camp had been suffering from smallpox added to the outrage about the army&#x27;s attack on non-combatants. Despite the subsequent controversy, General Sheridan expressed his confidence in Baker&#x27;s leadership while struggling to protect the U.S. Army politically. He succeeded in preventing an official investigation into the incident. Following the Marias Massacre, Baker was widely viewed as a strong military commander and was selected to command Fort Ellis by General Sheridan. At Fort Ellis, Baker was in command of surveying expeditions into Yellowstone in 1871 and 1872, culminating in a skirmish between his forces and Indian warriors led by Sitting Bull at Pryor&#x27;s Creek on August 14, 1872. Baker was later arrested by General Hancock for drunkenness in October 1872. He was never charged but was relegated to purchasing horses for the army. Baker died at age 47 on December 19, 1884, at Fort Walla Walla, Washington; a January 1885 obituary listed his cause of death as &quot;general debility.&quot;

=== Impact on the Clarke family ===
As an interracial family, the Clarkes struggled to find their place in both white and Native communities. In the latter years of his life, Horace Clarke would say the two central events of his life were the murder of his father and the military campaign that followed. As a result of his role in the campaign, he would be haunted by visions of Indians while traveling in Canada. Much of his life was spent repressing memories of the slaughter and attempting to forget the details of that day. Horace—who was half-Indian—was ultimately pardoned for his role in the massacre by the Native community, who viewed his participation as justified by a desire to avenge his father and because of his social and economic standing in the community.

Nathan Clarke was &quot;stabbed to the heart&quot; on September 19, 1872 in Deep Creek, Montana by James Swan, a Métis man. Clarke&#x27;s death was reported in the Helena Weekly Herald with the cause: &quot;Clark wanted Swan&#x27;s daughter, to which both Swan and the girl objected.&quot; Andrew Graybill&#x27;s &quot;The Red and the White&quot; portrays Clarke&#x27;s stabbing as an expression of the &quot;self-loathing&quot; of &quot;some people of mixed ancestry,&quot; asserting that James Swan preferred his daughter marry &quot;a white man.&quot; This accusation lacks credibility, given the Swan family&#x27;s hosting of Louis Riel at their home during his time in Montana and the family&#x27;s subsequent participation in the North-West Resistance. The daughter in question was likely Adelaide Swan, as she married Alexandre Azure (a Métis man) on November 26, 1872.

=== Historical significance ===
Sheridan had been attempting to replace Indian agents with military personnel, as he believed that they could better control the Indians. Sheridan reported to Congress that he could save the government $3.5 million in annual transportation costs alone. Although the Army Appropriation bill in 1870 allowed Sheridan to take over Indian affairs, his involvement in the massacre prevented him from advancing. Following the massacre, President Ulysses S. Grant adopted a &quot;Peace Policy.&quot; and ended discussions about returning control of Indian affairs to the U.S. Army. In an attempt to raise the quality of appointees, Grant appointed as Indian agents numerous Quakers and other persons affiliated with religious groups.

<doc id="209886" wikidata="Q108413" url="?curid=209886" title="Wounded Knee Massacre">
<text>The Wounded Knee Massacre, also known as the Battle of Wounded Knee, involved nearly three hundred Lakota people killed by soldiers of the United States Army. The massacre is also referred to as a &quot;mass shooting&quot; by many sources and is often termed the deadliest mass shooting in American history, though other more recent shootings may be referred to as the &quot;deadliest&quot; in &quot;modern&quot; U.S. history).

The event was part of what the U.S. military called the Pine Ridge Campaign, occurred on December 29, 1890, near Wounded Knee Creek (Lakota: &quot;Čhaŋkpé Ópi Wakpála&quot;) on the Lakota Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota, following a botched attempt to disarm the Lakota people at the camp. The previous day, a detachment of the U.S. 7th Cavalry Regiment commanded by Major Samuel M. Whitside approached Spotted Elk&#x27;s band of Miniconjou Lakota and 38 Hunkpapa Lakota near Porcupine Butte and escorted them westward to Wounded Knee Creek, where they made camp. The remainder of the 7th Cavalry Regiment, led by Colonel James W. Forsyth, arrived and surrounded the encampment. The regiment was supported by a battery of four Hotchkiss mountain guns. The Army was catering to the anxiety of settlers who called the conflict the &quot;Messiah War&quot; and were worried the ceremonial Ghost Dance signified a potentially dangerous Sioux resurgence. Historian Jeffrey Ostler wrote in 2004, &quot;Wounded Knee was not made up of a series of discrete unconnected events. Instead, from the disarming to the burial of the dead, it consisted of a series of acts held together by an underlying logic of racist domination.&quot;

On the morning of December 29, the U.S. Cavalry troops went into the camp to disarm the Lakota. One version of events maintains that during the process of disarming the Lakota, a deaf tribesman named Black Coyote was reluctant to give up his rifle, claiming he had paid a lot for it. Black Coyote&#x27;s rifle went off at that point, and the soldiers began firing on the Lakota. The Lakota warriors fought back, but many had already been disarmed.

More than 250 people of the Lakota were killed and 51 wounded (4 men and 47 women and children, some of whom died later). Some estimates placed the number of dead as high as 300. Twenty-five U.S. soldiers also were killed and 39 were wounded (six of the wounded later died). Nineteen soldiers were awarded the Medal of Honor specifically for Wounded Knee, and overall 31 for the campaign. In 2001, the National Congress of American Indians passed two resolutions condemning the military awards and called on the federal government to rescind them. The Wounded Knee National Historic Landmark, the site of the massacre, was designated a National Historic Landmark by the U.S. Department of the Interior. In 1990, both houses of the U.S. Congress passed a resolution on the historical centennial formally expressing &quot;deep regret&quot; for the massacre.

==Prelude==

In the years leading up to the conflict, the U.S. government had continued to seize Lakota lands. The once-large bison herds of the Great Plains, a staple of the Plains Indians, had been hunted to near-extinction. Treaty promises to protect reservation lands from encroachment by settlers and gold miners were not implemented as agreed. As a result, there was unrest on the reservations. During this time, news spread among the reservations of a Paiute prophet named Wovoka, founder of the Ghost Dance religion. He had a vision that the Christian Messiah, Jesus Christ, had returned to Earth in the form of a Native American.

According to Wovoka, the white invaders would disappear from Native lands, the ancestors would lead them to good hunting grounds, the buffalo herds and all the other animals would return in abundance, and the ghosts of their ancestors would return to Earth. They would then live in peace. All this would be brought about by the performance of the slow and solemn Ghost Dance, performed as a shuffle in silence to a single drumbeat. Lakota ambassadors to Wovoka, Kicking Bear and Short Bull, taught the Lakota that while performing the Ghost Dance, they would wear special Ghost Dance shirts, as had been seen by Black Elk in a vision. Kicking Bear misunderstood the meaning of the shirts, and said that the shirts had the power to repel bullets. Some tribes, including the Sioux, believed that a great earthquake and flood would occur which would drown all the whites.

The Ghost Dance movement was a result of the slow but ever-present destruction of the Native Americans&#x27; way of life. Tribal land was being seized at alarming rates. The once numerous bison herds were nearly hunted to extinction. The entire livelihood of the plains tribes revolved around the bison, and without the resources the animal offered, their cultures rapidly lost stability and security. This forced them to rely on the United States government to provide rations and goods, or else face starvation. The way of life of these independent people was rapidly fading. The Ghost Dance brought hope: the white man would soon disappear; the buffalo herds would return; people would be reunited with loved ones who had since died; the old way of living before the white man would return. This was not just a religious movement but a response to the gradual cultural destruction.

U.S. settlers were alarmed by the sight of the many Great Basin and Plains tribes performing the Ghost Dance, worried that it might be a prelude to armed attack. Among them was the U.S. Indian agent at the Standing Rock Agency where Chief Sitting Bull lived. U.S. officials decided to take some of the chiefs into custody in order to quell what they called the &quot;Messiah craze&quot;. The military first hoped to have Buffalo Bill—a friend of Sitting Bull—aid in the plan, to reduce the chance of violence. Standing Rock agent James McLaughlin sent the Indian police to arrest Sitting Bull.

On December 15, 1890, 40 Native American policemen arrived at Sitting Bull&#x27;s house to arrest him. When Sitting Bull refused to comply, the police used force on him. The Lakota in the village were enraged. Catch-the-Bear, a Lakota, shouldered his rifle and shot Lt. Bullhead, who reacted by firing his revolver into the chest of Sitting Bull. Another police officer, Red Tomahawk, shot Sitting Bull in the head, and he dropped to the ground. He died between 12 and 1 p.m. After Sitting Bull&#x27;s death, 200 members of his Hunkpapa band, fearful of reprisals, fled Standing Rock to join Chief Spotted Elk (later known as &quot;Big Foot&quot;) and his Miniconjou band at the Cheyenne River Indian Reservation.

Spotted Elk and his band, along with 38 Hunkpapa, left the Cheyenne River Reservation on December 23 to journey to the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation to seek shelter with Red Cloud.

Former Pine Ridge Indian agent Valentine T. McGillycuddy was asked his opinion of the &quot;hostilities&quot; surrounding the Ghost Dance movement, by General Leonard Wright Colby, commander of the Nebraska National Guard (portion of letter dated January 15, 1891):

As for the &#x27;Ghost Dance&#x27; too much attention has been paid to it. It was only the symptom or surface indication of a deep-rooted, long-existing difficulty; as well treat the eruption of smallpox as the disease and ignore the constitutional disease.

As regards disarming the Sioux, however desirable it may appear, I consider it neither advisable, nor practicable. I fear it will result as the theoretical enforcement of prohibition in Kansas, Iowa and Dakota; you will succeed in disarming and keeping disarmed the friendly Indians because you can, and you will not succeed with the mob element because you cannot.

If I were again to be an Indian agent, and had my choice, I would take charge of 10,000 armed Sioux in preference to a like number of disarmed ones; and furthermore agree to handle that number, or the whole Sioux nation, without a white soldier. Respectfully, etc., V.T. McGillycuddy.

P.S. I neglected to state that up to date there has been neither a Sioux outbreak or war. No citizen in Nebraska or Dakota has been killed, molested or can show the scratch of a pin, and no property has been destroyed off the reservation.


==Fight and ensuing massacre==

After being called to the Pine Ridge Agency, Spotted Elk of the Miniconjou Lakota nation and 350 of his followers were making the slow trip to the agency on December 28, 1890, when they were met by a 7th Cavalry detachment under Major Samuel M. Whitside southwest of Porcupine Butte. John Shangreau, a scout and interpreter who was half Lakota, advised the troopers not to disarm the Lakota immediately, as it would lead to violence. The troopers escorted the Native Americans about westward to Wounded Knee Creek where they told them to make camp. Later that evening, Colonel James W. Forsyth and the remainder of the 7th Cavalry arrived, bringing the number of troopers at Wounded Knee to 500. In contrast, there were 350 Lakota: 120 men and 230 women and children. The troopers surrounded Spotted Elk&#x27;s encampment and set up four rapid-fire Hotchkiss-designed M1875 mountain guns.

=== December 29, 1890 ===
At daybreak on December 29, 1890, Forsyth ordered the surrender of weapons and the immediate removal of the Lakota from the &quot;zone of military operations&quot; to awaiting trains. A search of the camp confiscated 38 rifles, and more rifles were taken as the soldiers searched the Lakota. None of the old men were found to be armed. A medicine man named Yellow Bird allegedly harangued the young men who were becoming agitated by the search, and the tension spread to the soldiers.

Specific details of what triggered the massacre are debated. According to some accounts, Yellow Bird began to perform the Ghost Dance, telling the Lakota that their &quot;ghost shirts&quot; were &quot;bulletproof&quot;. As tensions mounted, Black Coyote refused to give up his rifle; he spoke no English and was deaf and had not understood the order. Another Lakota said: &quot;Black Coyote is deaf,&quot; and when the soldier persisted, he said, &quot;Stop. He cannot hear your orders.&quot; At that moment, two soldiers seized Black Coyote from behind, and (allegedly) in the struggle, his rifle discharged. At the same moment, Yellow Bird threw some dust into the air, and approximately five young Lakota men with concealed weapons threw aside their blankets and fired their rifles at Troop K of the 7th. After this initial exchange, the firing became indiscriminate.

Eyewitness accounts state that Black Coyote&#x27;s gun went off when he was seized from behind by soldiers. Survivor Wasumaza, one of Big Foot&#x27;s warriors who later changed his name to Dewey Beard, recalled Black Coyote was unable to hear. &quot;If they had left him alone he was going to put his gun down where he should. They grabbed him and spinned him in the east direction. He was still unconcerned even then. He hadn&#x27;t his gun pointed at anyone. His intention was to put that gun down. They came on and grabbed the gun that he was going to put down. Right after they spun him around there was the report of a gun, was quite loud. I couldn&#x27;t say that anyone was shot, but following that was a crash&quot;. Theodor Ragnar of the 7th Cavalry also stated that Black Coyote was deaf. In contrast, a Native American named Turning Hawk called Black Coyote &quot;a crazy man, a young man of very bad influence, and in fact a nobody.&quot;

According to commanding General Nelson A. Miles, a &quot;scuffle occurred between one deaf warrior who had [a] rifle in his hand and two soldiers. The rifle was discharged and a battle occurred, not only the warriors but the sick Chief Spotted Elk, and a large number of women and children who tried to escape by running and scattering over the prairie were hunted down and killed.&quot;

Modern historians, including Dee Brown, author of &quot;Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee&quot;, have supported that Black Coyote was deaf, and that he owned a new Winchester rifle.

At first all firing was at close range; half the Lakota men were killed or wounded before they had a chance to get off any shots. Some of the Lakota grabbed rifles from the piles of confiscated weapons and opened fire on the soldiers. With no cover, and with many of the Lakota unarmed, this lasted a few minutes at most. While the Lakota warriors and soldiers were shooting at close range, other soldiers used the Hotchkiss guns against the tipi camp full of women and children. It is believed that many of the soldiers were victims of friendly fire from their own Hotchkiss guns. The Lakota women and children fled the camp, seeking shelter in a nearby ravine from the crossfire. The officers had lost all control of their men. Some of the soldiers fanned out and finished off the wounded. Others leaped onto their horses and pursued the Natives (men, women, and children), in some cases for miles across the prairies. In less than an hour, at least 150 Lakota had been killed and 50 wounded. Other estimates indicate nearly 300 of the original 350 having been killed or wounded, with a blizzard preventing immediate search following the massacre. Reports indicate that the soldiers loaded 51 survivors (4 men and 47 women and children) onto wagons and took them to the Pine Ridge Reservation. Army casualties numbered 25 dead. Black Coyote died at Wounded Knee.

==Aftermath==

Following a three-day blizzard, the military hired civilians to bury the dead Lakota. The burial party found the deceased frozen; they were gathered up and placed in a mass grave on a hill overlooking the encampment from which some of the fire from the Hotchkiss guns originated. It was reported that four infants were found alive, wrapped in their deceased mothers&#x27; shawls. In all, 84 men, 44 women, and 18 children reportedly died on the field, while at least seven Lakota were mortally wounded. Miles denounced Forsyth and relieved him of command. An exhaustive Army Court of Inquiry convened by Miles criticized Forsyth for his tactical dispositions but otherwise exonerated him of responsibility. The Court of Inquiry, however, was not conducted as a formal court-martial.

The Secretary of War concurred with the decision and reinstated Forsyth to command of the 7th Cavalry. Testimony had indicated that for the most part, troops attempted to avoid non-combatant casualties. Miles continued to criticize Forsyth, whom he believed had deliberately disobeyed his commands in order to destroy the Lakota. Miles promoted the conclusion that Wounded Knee was a deliberate massacre rather than a tragedy caused by poor decisions, in an effort to destroy the career of Forsyth. This was later whitewashed, and Forsyth was promoted to brigadier, then later, major general.

Many non-Lakota living near the reservations interpreted the battle as the defeat of a murderous cult; others confused Ghost Dancers with Native Americans in general. In an editorial response to the event, the young newspaper editor L. Frank Baum, later the author of &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot;, wrote in &quot;The Aberdeen Saturday Pioneer&quot; on January 3, 1891:

The Pioneer has before declared that our only safety depends upon the total extermination of the Indians. Having wronged them for centuries, we had better, in order to protect our civilization, follow it up by one more wrong and wipe these untamed and untamable creatures from the face of the earth. In this lies future safety for our settlers and the soldiers who are under incompetent commands. Otherwise, we may expect future years to be as full of trouble with the redskins as those have been in the past.
Soon after the event, Dewey Beard, his brother Joseph Horn Cloud, and others formed the Wounded Knee Survivors Association, which came to include descendants. They sought compensation from the U.S. government for the many fatalities and injured. Today the association is independent and works to preserve and protect the historic site from exploitation, and to administer any memorial erected there. Papers of the association (1890–1973) and related materials are held by the University of South Dakota and are available for research. It was not until the 1990s that a memorial to the Lakota was included in the National Historic Landmark. In 1968 James Czywczynski purchased 40 acres of property adjacent to Wounded Knee, operating a trading post and museum.

More than 80 years after the massacre, beginning on February 27, 1973, Wounded Knee was the site of the Wounded Knee incident, a 71-day standoff between militants of the American Indian Movement—who had chosen the site for its symbolic value—and federal law enforcement officials. Among the buildings destroyed were the Czywczynski post and Museum; the Czywczynskis moved away asking a purchase price of $3.9 million [land appraised at $14,000]. On September 7, 2022, the Oglala Sioux tribal council and the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe voted to buy for $500,000 the 40-acre site from the Czywczynskis. (The Oglala Sioux tribal already owned one acre of Land from Wounded Knee which was donated by the Red Cloud Indian school on the site of the Sacred Heart church had stood.)
===Stranded 9th Cavalry===
The battalion of 9th Cavalry was scouting near the White River (Missouri River tributary) about north of Indian agency at Pine Ridge when the Wounded Knee Massacre occurred and rode south all night to reach the reservation. In the early morning of December 30, 1890, F, I, and K Troops reached the Pine Ridge agency, however, their supply wagon guarded by D Troop located behind them was attacked by 50 Lakota warriors near Cheyenne Creek (about from the Indian agency). One soldier was immediately killed. The wagon train protected itself by circling the wagons. Corporal William Wilson volunteered to take a message to the agency at Pine Ridge to get help after the Indian scouts refused to go. Wilson took off through the wagon circle with Lakota in pursuit and his troops covering him. Wilson reached the agency and spread the alarm. The 9th Cavalry within the agency came to rescue the stranded troopers and the Lakota dispersed. For his actions, Corporal Wilson received the Medal of Honor.

===Drexel Mission Fight===

Historically, Wounded Knee is generally considered to be the end of the collective multi-century series of conflicts between colonial and U.S. forces and American Indians, known collectively as the Indian Wars. It was not however the last armed conflict between Native Americans and the United States.

The Drexel Mission Fight was an armed confrontation between Lakota warriors and the United States Army that took place on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation on December 30, 1890, the day following Wounded Knee. The fight occurred on White Clay Creek approximately north of Pine Ridge, where Lakota fleeing from the continued hostile situation surrounding the massacre at Wounded Knee had set up camp.

Company K of the 7th Cavalry—the unit involved at Wounded Knee—was sent to force the Lakotas to return to the areas they were assigned on their respective reservations. Some of the &quot;hostiles&quot; were Brulé Lakota from the Rosebud Indian Reservation. Company K was pinned down in a valley by the combined Lakota forces and had to be rescued by the 9th Cavalry, an African American regiment nicknamed the &quot;Buffalo Soldiers&quot;.

Among the Lakota warriors was a young Brulé from Rosebud named Plenty Horses, who had recently returned from five years at the Carlisle Indian School in Pennsylvania. A week after this fight, Plenty Horses shot and killed army lieutenant Edward W. Casey, commandant of the Cheyenne Scouts (Troop L, 8th Cavalry). The testimony introduced at the trial of Plenty Horses and his subsequent acquittal also helped abrogate the legal culpability of the U.S. Army for the deaths at Wounded Knee.

===Winter guards===
The 9th Cavalry were stationed on the Pine Ridge reservation through the rest of the winter of 1890–1891 until March 1891. By then, the 9th Cavalry was the only regiment on the reservation after being the first to arrive in November 1890.

==Medals of Honor==
For this 1890 campaign, the US Army awarded 31 Medals of Honor, 19 specifically for service at Wounded Knee.

In the Nebraska State Historical Society&#x27;s summer 1994 quarterly journal, Jerry Green construes that pre-1916 Medals of Honor were awarded more liberally; however, &quot;the number of medals does seem disproportionate when compared to those awarded for other battles.&quot; Quantifying, he compares the three awarded for the Battle of Bear Paw Mountain&#x27;s five-day siege, to the twenty awarded for this short and one-sided action. Historian Will G. Robinson notes that, in contrast, only three Medals of Honor were awarded among the 64,000 South Dakotans who fought for four years of World War II. However, historian Dwight Mears points out that awards prior to 1918 were &quot;Medal[s] of Honor in name only,&quot; making such comparisons with modern medals inappropriate, since &quot;the medal that existed in 1890 is a materially different award.&quot; Mears notes that Army regulations in 1890 stated that “Medals of honor will be awarded, by the President, to officers or enlisted men who have distinguished themselves in action,” meaning that they could be awarded for actions that were merely distinguished, not gallant or heroic. 

Native American activists have urged the medals be withdrawn, calling them &quot;medals of dishonor&quot;. According to Lakota tribesman William Thunder Hawk, &quot;The Medal of Honor is meant to reward soldiers who act heroically. But at Wounded Knee, they didn&#x27;t show heroism; they showed cruelty.&quot; In 2001, the National Congress of American Indians passed two resolutions condemning the Medals of Honor awards and called on the U.S. government to rescind them.

A number of the citations on the medals awarded to the troopers at Wounded Knee state that they went in pursuit of Lakota who were trying to escape or hide. Another citation was for &quot;conspicuous bravery in rounding up and bringing to the skirmish line a stampeded pack mule.&quot; Another medal was awarded in part for extending an enlistment.

In February 2021, the South Dakota Senate unanimously called upon the United States Congress to investigate the 20 medals of honor awarded to members of the 7th Cavalry for their participation in the massacre. Lawmakers argued that the medals given to the soldiers of the 7th Cavalry Regiment tarnished Medals of Honor given to soldiers for genuine acts of courage. Previous efforts to rescind the medals have failed. In March 2021, Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Jeff Merkley (D-OR) and Congressman Kaiali&#x27;i Kahele (D-HI) answered the South Dakota Senate&#x27;s call and reintroduced a bill to revoke the Medals of Honor awarded to the soldiers who perpetrated the Wounded Knee massacre. The provision was incorporated into the FY2022 National Defense Authorization Act, but was removed in conference with the explanation that &quot;these Medals of Honor were awarded at the prerogative of the President of the United States, not the Congress.&quot; This effectively expressed that since adjudication authority was granted to the executive, that it was not the role of Congress to revoke medals. As a result, the bill failed due to a separation of powers conflict. An identical version of Remove the Stain was added to the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023 (2022), however, it was again removed from the final version of the defense bill by the Senate Armed Services Committee. The Remove the Stain Act also failed to identify an effective process of revocation, stipulating in error that the recipients would be removed from the Medal of Honor Roll. However, none of the Wounded Knee medal recipients were on the Medal of Honor Roll, which was a pension list. Further, even if the recipients had been on the Roll, the Remove the Stain Act protected this type of benefit, as a subsection of the bill stipulated “this Act shall not be construed to deny any individual any benefit from the Federal Government.” 

In July 2024, the Secretary of Defense announced a joint DoD/DoI review to consider revoking the Wounded Knee Medals of Honor. Notably, the DoD review cited the joint explanatory statement for the FY2022 National Defense Authorization Act (which removed the Remove the Stain Act from the bill) as the impetus for the medal review. The DoD review concluded in October 2024, reportedly recommending that no medals be revoked. Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe chairman Ryman LeBeau wrote an op-ed on the outcome, saying &quot;the Pentagon board has recommended that America keep the Medals of Honor for the Wounded Knee Massacre&quot; with all three DoD panelists voting against revocation and both DoI panelists voting in favor. According to LeBeau, &quot;our People have no confidence in such a Pentagon board.&quot; Oliver “O.J.” Semans, a lead advocate for revoking the medals, also criticized the review process, noting that “military historians weren’t used, and it was done over such a short period of time that evidence really couldn’t be put together.”


==Remembrance==

===Commemoration of Native American deaths===

In 1891 The Ghost Shirt, thought to have been worn by one who died in the massacre, was brought to Glasgow, Scotland, by George C Crager, a Lakota Sioux interpreter with Buffalo Bill&#x27;s . He sold it to the Kelvingrove Museum, which displayed the shirt until it was returned to Wounded Knee Survivors Association in 1998.

St. John&#x27;s Episcopal Mission Church was built on the hill behind the mass grave in which the victims had been buried, some survivors having been nursed in the then-new Holy Cross Mission Church. In 1903, descendants of those who died in the battle erected a monument at the gravesite. The memorial lists many of those who died at Wounded Knee along with an inscription that reads:

This monument is erected by surviving relatives and other Ogalala and Cheyenne River Sioux Indians in memory of the Chief Big Foot massacre December 29, 1890. Col. Forsyth in command of US troops. Big Foot was a great chief of the Sioux Indians. He often said, &#x27;I will stand in peace till my last day comes.&#x27; He did many good and brave deeds for the white man and the red man. Many innocent women and children who knew no wrong died here.
Wounded Knee was declared a U.S. National Historic Landmark in 1965 and was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1966.

Beginning in 1986, the group named &quot;Big Foot Memorial Riders&quot; was formed where they will go to continue to honor the dead. The ceremony has attracted more participants each year and riders and their horses live with the cold weather, as well as the lack of food and water, as they retrace the path that their family members took to Wounded Knee. They carry with them a white flag to symbolize their hope for world peace, and to honor and remember the victims so that they will not be forgotten.

===Seventh Cavalry Regiment===
When the 7th Cavalry Regiment returned to duty at Fort Riley from Pine Ridge, South Dakota, the soldiers of the regiment raised money for a monument for members of the regiment killed at Wounded Knee. About $1,950 was collected, and on July 25, 1893, the monument was dedicated with 5,500 people in attendance. The stone edifice stands near Waters Hall.

=== Wounded Knee as worst mass shooting in the history of the United States ===
Many popular media sources write about the event as &quot;The worst mass shooting&quot; in United States history, though the term &quot;mass shooting&quot; lacks any clear definition. Often the distinction as &quot;worst mass shooting&quot; is compared to other mass shootings in the United States after a mass casualty event involving a single shooter and numerous dead, whereas the Wounded Knee Massacre involved numerous shooters from the United States government of unarmed Lakota men, women, and children. Often after a mass shooting in the United States after it becomes known how many people have died due to the firearm related fatality, a comparison to other mass shootings might be reported on in the media, at this point, some critics point out that the Wounded Knee massacre is sometimes forgotten in place of more recent mass shootings, either as a result of:

# Wounded Knee having occurred more in the distant past, 
# The United States government having perpetrated the Wounded Knee shooting instead of a lone wolf or private civilian shooters, or;
# Media attention tending to &quot;...gloss over Native American massacres...&quot;

Largely the phenomena using the &quot;mass shooting&quot; language, and subsequent comparison to other shootings, is most widely reported on in the United States.

==In popular culture==

===Massacre or battle===
The incident was initially referred to as the &quot;Battle of Wounded Knee&quot;. Some Native American groups have objected to this description and refer to it as the &quot;Wounded Knee Massacre&quot;. The location of the conflict is officially known as the &quot;Wounded Knee Battlefield&quot;. The U.S. Army currently refers to it as &quot;Wounded Knee&quot;.

===Bury my heart at Wounded Knee===
In his 1931 poem &quot;American Names&quot;, Stephen Vincent Benét coined the phrase &quot;Bury my heart at Wounded Knee&quot;. The poem is about his love of American place names, not making reference to the &quot;battle&quot;. When the line was used as the title of historian Dee Brown&#x27;s 1970 best-selling book, awareness was raised and Benet&#x27;s phrase became popularly associated with the incident.

Since the publication of the book, the phrase &quot;Bury my heart at Wounded Knee&quot; has been used many times in reference to the battle, especially in music.

In 1972, Robbie Basho released the song &quot;Wounded Knee Soliloquy&quot; on the album &quot;The Voice of the Eagle&quot;.

In 1973, Stuttgart, Germany&#x27;s Gila released a krautrock/psychedelic folk album by the same name.

In 1992, Beverly (Buffy) Sainte-Marie released her song titled &quot;Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee&quot; on &quot;Coincidence and Likely Stories&quot;.

===In other music===
Artists who have written or recorded songs referring to the battle at Wounded Knee include: Walela &quot;Wounded Knee&quot; from the 1997 self-titled album. Nightwish (&quot;Creek Mary&#x27;s Blood&quot; from their 2004 album &quot;Once&quot; featuring John Two-Hawks); Manowar (&quot;Spirit Horse Of The Cherokee&quot; from the 1992 album &quot;The Triumph Of Steel&quot; ); Grant Lee Buffalo (&quot;Were You There?&quot; from the album &quot;Storm Hymnal&quot; 2001); Johnny Cash (1972&#x27;s &quot;Big Foot&quot;, which is strongly sympathetic); Gordon Lightfoot (&quot;Protocol&quot; from his 1976 album &quot;Summertime Dream&quot;); Indigo Girls (a 1995 cover of Sainte-Marie&#x27;s song); Charlie Parr (&quot;1890&quot; on his 2010 album &quot;When the Devil Goes Blind&quot;); Nik Kershaw (&quot;Wounded Knee&quot; on his 1989 album &quot;The Works&quot;); 1982 Single by Southern Death Cult (&quot;Moya&quot;); The Waterboys (&quot;Bury My Heart&quot;); Uriah Heep; Primus; Nahko and Medicine for the People; Patti Smith; Robbie Robertson; Five Iron Frenzy wrote the 2001 song &quot;The Day We Killed&quot; with mentions of Black Kettle, and quotes Black Elk&#x27;s account from &quot;Black Elk Speaks&quot; on the album Five Iron Frenzy 2: Electric Boogaloo; Toad the Wet Sprocket; Marty Stuart; Bright Eyes; and &quot;Pocahontas&quot; by Neil Young. On Sam Roberts&#x27; 2006 &quot;Chemical City&quot; album, the song &quot;The Bootleg Saint&quot; contains line critical of Knee Massacre. There is also a Welsh song titled &quot;Gwaed Ar Yr Eira Gwyn&quot; by Tecwyn Ifan on this incident. The song &quot;American Ghost Dance&quot; by the Red Hot Chili Peppers makes extensive reference to the massacre as well.

In 1973, the American rock band Redbone, formed by Native Americans Patrick and Lolly Vasquez, released the song &quot;We Were All Wounded at Wounded Knee&quot;. The song ends with the subtly altered sentence &quot;We were all wounded by Wounded Knee.&quot; The song reached the number-one chart position across Europe. In the U.S., the song was initially withheld from release and then banned by several radio stations. Richard Stepp&#x27;s 2008 Native American Music Awards &quot;Native Heart&quot; nominated album &quot;The Sacred Journey&quot;, has &quot;Wounded Knee&quot; as its final track.

===In film===
The massacre has been referred to in films, including &quot;Thunderheart&quot; (1992), &quot;Legends of the Fall&quot; (1994), &quot;Hidalgo&quot; (2004), and &quot;Hostiles&quot; (2017). The 2005 TNT mini-series&quot; Into the West&quot; included scenes of the massacre. In 2007, HBO Films released a film adaptation of the Dee Brown bestseller &quot;Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee&quot;. The 2016 film &quot;Neither Wolf Nor Dog&quot; has its climax at the massacre site and was filmed on location there.

===Other===
In the 1992 video game &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Turtles in Time&quot;, one level is called &quot;Bury My Shell at Wounded Knee.&quot; It takes place in 1885 AD on a train in the Old American West.

In the 1996 DC comic book &quot;Saint of Killers&quot;, written by Garth Ennis, the main character becomes a surrogate Angel of Death, reaping souls whenever men kill other men violently. The story is set in the 1880s, and near the end of chapter 4, it is said that &quot;four years later&quot; he was called upon at Wounded Knee.

In the 2013 video game &quot;BioShock Infinite&quot;, several main characters are veterans of Wounded Knee. The protagonist, Booker DeWitt, is haunted by his deeds during the battle and at one point confronts one of his (fictional) superiors from the event.

The Wounded Knee Massacre, and the events leading to it, constitute the final chapter of &quot;Złoto Gór Czarnych&quot; (&quot;Gold of the Black Hills&quot;), a trilogy of novels told from the perspective of the Santee Dakota tribe by Polish author Alfred Szklarski and his wife Krystyna Szklarska.

<text>The Hula painted frog (Latonia nigriventer) is a species of frog endemic to the Lake Hula marshes in northern Israel. It is the only living member of the genus &quot;Latonia,&quot; which is otherwise known from fossils from Europe spanning from the Oligocene through Pleistocene. The Hula painted frog was thought to be extinct as a result of habitat destruction during the 1950s until the species was rediscovered in 2011. 

The draining of Lake Hula and its marshes in the 1950s was thought to have caused the extinction of this frog, along with the cyprinid fish &quot;Mirogrex hulensis&quot; and cichlid fish &quot;Tristramella intermedia&quot;. Only five individuals had been found prior to the draining of the lake. Environmental improvements in the Hula reserve have been cited as a possible reason for the frog&#x27;s reemergence.

==Taxonomy==

On March 22, 1940, the biologists Heinrich Mendelssohn and Heinz Steinitz discovered two specimens apparently belonging to a new species of the frog genus &quot;Discoglossus&quot; on the eastern shore of Lake Hula in Safed, in the Northern District of Mandatory Palestine. The largest of the frogs swallowed the smaller one while they were kept in a terrarium. Two tadpoles of the species from the same locality were discovered by Seinitz in August 1940. In 1943, Mendelssohn and Steinitz named the new species &quot;Discoglossus nigriventer&quot;, designating a female of the captured specimens by then housed at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem as the holotype specimen and the tadpoles as the paratype specimens. 

Little is known about its history, because few specimens have been found by scientists. Two adults and two tadpoles were collected in 1940 and a single specimen was found in 1955. This would prove to be the last record of this species until 2011.

According to an ecologist of the Israel Nature and Parks Authority, the frog&#x27;s Hebrew name, &quot;agulashon shehor-gahon&quot; (&quot;Black-bellied round-tongued&quot;), derives from its black belly and round tongue. The scientific name of the species reflects these details as well. Unlike the tongues of other frogs, it is not used to catch prey.
This frog was originally proposed to be a member of the genus &quot;Discoglossus&quot;, but further genetic and morphological assessment after the rediscovery of the species led a reassignment to genus &quot;Latonia&quot;, for which no other living examples are known. Fossils of &quot;Latonia&quot; are known in Europe spanning from the Upper Oligocene until the Early Pleistocene. The closest relative of Latonia is considered to be &quot;Discoglossus.&quot; On this basis, the Hula painted frog has been labeled a living fossil, the only extant representative of an ancient genetic split.

The cladogram below is based on the 2013 genetic analysis by Biton and colleagues:

==Description==

The Hula painted frog shows variation in size; while the adult female type specimen measured only , other females have been recorded to reach greater lengths of , while males are slightly smaller and grow long. This species has a dark belly with small white spots, with adults having more of these spots than juveniles. It is colored ochre above with a rusty colour grading into dark olive-grey to greyish-black on the sides. A band of lighter color stretching down the middle of the back is present near the hind part of the animal. Although the distinctness and contrast varies between individuals, the general color pattern is largely the same throughout the species. There is no significant sexual dimorphism in this frog, though the webbing of the feet may be slightly weaker in females.

The head is flattened and about as wide as it is long, with no canthal ridge (a ridge connecting the snout tip to the front edge of the eye, present in some other frogs). The distance between the eyes is at least equal to the width of the eyelid, a feature distinguishing it from the Mediterranean painted frog (&quot;Discoglossus pictus&quot;) whose eyes are closer together. The nostrils are located closer to both the tip of the snout and to each other than to the eyes, and each has a rectangular shape with rounded corners. The tympana are taller than they are wide, but not distinctly visible. The snout protrudes forward beyond the mouth, though not as far as that of the Mediterranean painted frog, while the angle of the mandible has a process which corresponds to a hollow in the upper jaw. Inside the mouth are a pair of vomerine teeth, each located behind a rectangular choana with rounded corners. The tongue has a roundish triangular shape, with smooth edges and no furrows, and is adhesive aside from a small margin. A pair of glandular ridges extends from the back of each eye, one over the tympanum towards the base of the arm, and the other stretches straight backwards and splits into multiple warts at the shoulder level. The whole upper surface of the animal is dotted with warts, some of which are arranged in rows or groups. The fingers may have rounded or pointed tips and are not webbed, though the toes are partly webbed at the base. The length of the hind legs with the feet included exceeds the snout-vent length, while the foot itself is slightly shorter than the shin. In both sexes the arms are long and robust, with well-developed muscles; this is unusual among frogs as typically only male frogs have robust arms, which are used to grasp the female during amplexus. In Hula painted frogs, the robustness of the arms is believed to be an adaptation for digging or feeding.

===Tadpoles===
The tadpoles of the Hula painted frog are small, with total lengths of and at Gosner stages 25 and 34 respectively. The main body (excluding the tail) of the tadpole has an oval shape when viewed from above, with the body being widest about a third of its length away from the rounded snout. When viewed from the side, the snout slopes downwards. The upper surface is a medium brown color with golden speckles and a network of black lines forming a net-like pattern. The underbelly is translucent and lacks pigment, allowing the internal anatomy to be seen through it, and possesses a single crescent-shaped spiracle located in its middle. The width of this spiracle is about a quarter the width of the mouth. The oral disc contains teeth arranged into double rows surrounding the serrated, partly keratinized jaw sheaths, with two upper double rows and three lower double rows present, of which one of the lower rows is split in the middle to accommodate the jaw sheath. A series of papillae (small fleshy protrusions) is present on the margins the lips, and is split in the middle of the upper lip. The nostrils are small and rounded, located closer to the snout than to the eyes, and each has a dark spot behind it. The eyes are located on top of the head and oriented sideways, making them invisible when the tadpole is viewed from below. The tail is a slightly lighter color than the main body and grows long, being around 169% the length of the main body. Moderately high caudal fins are located on the upper and lower sides of the tail. These fins are translucent and bear irregular dark brown spots of varying sizes. The musculature of the tail does not reach the tail tip. 

==Distribution and habitat==
The Hula painted frog is endemic to Hula Valley of Israel and has an extremely limited range, known only from an area of less than . It has only been recorded from two localities, the Hula National Reserve and the village of Yesud HaMa&#x27;ala, located about apart from each other. It was formerly more widespread, as evidenced by fossil remains of this species found at the Ubeidiya prehistoric site in the Jordan Valley, dating back to the Calabrian stage of the Early Pleistocene epoch (around 1.5 million years ago). The Hula Valley had survived as an area containing major water bodies such as Lake Hula throughout the Pleistocene epoch, when geological activity and climatic changes led to a dramatic decline in suitable habitat for &quot;Latonia&quot; frogs, allowing the valley to serve as a refugium for this species while the genus became extinct elsewhere. Although a 2017 study found that environmental DNA of this frog was also present in the Agamon Ha-Hula nature park and the Ein Te’o nature reserve, it was also noted that since most water bodies in the Hula Valley are interconnected via streams and canals, the presence of DNA at a site could be due to it being washed downstream from a different area and is not definitive evidence that the frog itself is present.

This species is semiaquatic (though mainly terrestrial) and is known to inhabit both terrestrial and aquatic habitats. Adults have been recorded in damp, peaty soil underneath of decomposed leaf litter amongst thickets of common reed, holy bramble and occasionally fig trees, as well as beneath dried grass or in burrows near water. In Yesud HaMa&#x27;ala, the Hula painted frog is known from a single ditch approximately long, with slow-flowing water that reaches a maximum depth of about . This ditch is supplied by a small permanent spring and has a thick layer of mud at its bottom, while dense vegetation occurs both in and around the water, with the present plant species including common reed, water lettuce and common duckweed.

==Biology==
A mostly nocturnal and solitary species, the Hula painted frog is most often seen after nightfall and does not aggregate with others of its kind. It is semiaquatic and frequently enters water, often observed submerged at night with only the snout protruding above the surface. On land, the Hula painted frog is known to dig into the ground, and has been found beneath of decomposed leaf litter, though it does also inhabit burrows made by other animals such as small mammals or freshwater crabs. This species has robust arms which it uses to dig head first into the soil, its reinforced skull and stout upper body being well adapted to support this behavior.

The Hula painted frog is a skittish animal, and has been noted to be more easily scared by human disturbance (such as the light of electric torches) than the Levant water frog (&quot;Pelophylax bedriagae&quot;) or the Savigny&#x27;s treefrog (&quot;Hyla savignyi&quot;). When disturbed, it may retreat into the water and swim towards thickets of dense roots and aquatic plants, or burrow underground if the soil is loose enough for it to do so, while increasing the secretion of skin mucus to aid itself in moving through vegetation or soil. Individuals captured in gloved human hands have been recorded to freeze in motion before slowly jumping or walking forward in attempt to escape, and adults are known to utter a call when handled which sounds similar to the presumed advertisement calls of the species, but not as intense or regular.

Surveys of this species at Yesud HaMa&#x27;ala have found that the population at this locality had a very high percentage of injury, with 28% of the 112 surveyed medium to large-sized individuals exhibiting minor injuries. Some of these injuries were recently inflicted while others were old, and were primarily on located on the hind legs. This combined with the low number of small individuals observed has been proposed to be a sign that the Hula painted frog faces high pressure from predation in its early life stages. Potential predators of the juveniles include invertebrates such as crustaceans, dragonfly nymphs, ground beetles and wolf spiders, as well as vertebrates such as the western mosquitofish, Levant water frog and Caspian turtle, all of which are known to prey on amphibians and occur within the range of the Hula painted frog. Adult Hula painted frogs are a confirmed predator of smaller individuals, as shown by an instance of cannibalism recorded in individuals kept in a terrarium. While its larger size presumably protects it from some of these predators, the adult Hula painted frog is not immune to predation, and is known to be taken by white-throated kingfishers.

===Diet and feeding===
Like most other amphibians, the Hula painted frog is a carnivore and feeds on other animals. While it has not been observed feeding in its natural habitat, scans of a specimen found dead in the wild revealed that its gut contents included the remains of four snails of the species &quot;Caracollina lenticula&quot; and a woodlouse of the species &quot;Porcellionides pruinosus&quot;. Compared to most frogs, this species has a particularly reinforced skull and powerful jaw muscles, enabling it to exert a great amount of force when closing its jaws. This is believed to be an adaptation to durophagy, allowing the frog to feed on hard-shelled prey such as the aforementioned snails and woodlice, and making the Hula painted frog a rare example of a frog species with such specialized feeding habits. It is also possible that this species will use its robust arms in feeding, as the frogs of the unrelated genus &quot;Paracassina&quot;, which have similar skull and arm adaptations, have been proposed to remove snails from their shells by applying pressure to the shell using its arms while holding the snail in its jaws. However, this species is known to at least occasionally consume other prey, as there is a recorded instance of cannibalism in which one Hula painted frog swallowed a smaller individual while the two were kept in a terrarium.

===Vocalizations===
Two types of vocalizations are known to be produced by the Hula painted frog; one is presumably an advertisement call and is uttered by males at the surface of the water, and the other is a release call uttered by both sexes when handled. The latter sounds mostly similar to the former, but is not as intensely or regularly uttered. Although it is possible that this species can produce other vocalizations, the fact that it lacks externally visible vocal sacs suggests its calls are limited to communication over short distances. The presumed advertisement call lasts for 725 to 1212 milliseconds and is usually uttered in a series, with each call separated from the next by a short interval of silence lasting 246 to 1606 milliseconds. Each of these calls is composed of two notes; the first is produced by expiration (breathing out) and lasts about 671 milliseconds, while the second is a shorter note produced by inspiration (breathing in) which lasts about 291 milliseconds. These two notes are consecutive, with no silent interval between them, and the second (inspiratory) note has a higher intensity and lower frequency than the first (expiratory) note. Overall, the presumed advertisement call has a low intensity and frequency, with a dominant frequency peak averaged over the entire call of 775.5 hertz.

===Reproduction===
Although breeding has not been observed in Hula painted frogs, it has been theorized that the species has a prolonged breeding period which lasts at least from March to June, and possibly as long as from February to September since most adults are observed in water during this time. This is further supported by the fact that male Hula painted frogs develop prominent nuptial pads and other keratinous outgrowths (which in other frogs are used to hold onto the female during amplexus) during these months, as well as records of tadpoles during May and August. The dissection of a female found dead in mid-January has shown that her body contained several hundred oocytes, each around in diameter and greyish-black in color. Reproduction in this species is presumably similar to that of frogs in the related genus &quot;Discoglossus&quot;, which exhibit short, intense periods of inguinal amplexus (with the arms of the male clasped around the waist of the female), during which the female lays several batches of eggs in a body of water that adhere to plants, rocks or the bottom of the water body.

==Status==

===Decline===

The draining of Lake Hula and its marshes in the 1950s was thought to have caused the extinction of this frog, along with the cyprinid fish &quot;Mirogrex hulensis&quot; and cichlid fish &quot;Tristramella intermedia&quot;. Only five individuals had been found prior to the draining of the lake. Environmental improvements in the Hula reserve have been cited as a possible reason for the frog&#x27;s reemergence.

In 1996, the IUCN classified this species as &quot;extinct in the wild&quot;, the very first amphibian to be given that designation by the IUCN. Israel continued to list it as an endangered species in the slim hope that a relict population may be found in the Golan Heights or in southern Lebanon. Following the rediscovery of the species in 2011, the IUCN now considers the frog to be critically endangered as its known habitat occupies less than 2 km2.

In 2000, a scientist from the Lebanese nature protection organisation A Rocha claimed he had seen a frog species which could be &quot;Latonia nigriventer&quot; in the Aammiq Wetland south of the Beqaa Valley in Lebanon. Two French-Lebanese-British expeditions in the years 2004 and 2005 yielded no confirmation as to the further existence of this species. In August 2010, a search organised by the Amphibian Specialist Group of the International Union for Conservation of Nature set out to look for various species of frogs thought to be extinct in the wild, including the Hula painted frog.
In 2013, a study published in &quot;Nature Communications&quot; revealed that in 2011 during a routine patrol at the Hula Nature Reserve, ranger Yoram Malka found the frog, which he immediately suspected as being the Hula painted frog, as he claimed he has been on the lookout for it for many years. Scientists confirmed that it was one of this rare species. An ecologist with the Israel Nature and Parks Authority credited the rehydration of the area for the frog sighting. On November 29, a second specimen was located in the same area. The second Hula painted frog, a female, was found in swampy weeds twenty centimeters deep. It weighed 13 grams, half the weight of its male counterpart. Since the discovery of the first specimen, at least ten more individuals have been found, all in the same area.

In 2016, a team led by Professor Sarig Gafni of the Ruppin Academic Center&#x27;s School of Marine Sciences discovered populations totaling several hundred individuals by searching in water at night, instead of in marsh mud, finding populations in 17 of the 52 Hula Valley water holes they surveyed.

=== Conservation ===
In 2017, an article published in the &quot;Molecular Ecology Journal&quot;, mentions of a group of scientists who investigated the suitable aquatic habitats for Hula painted frogs using the environmental DNA (eDNA) approach. The Hula Lake once provided a habitat for many rare species including this frog. Since, the 2011 rediscovery of this species in this region (in the Hula nature reserve), consequent efforts to study and protect it started. However, these efforts have been hampered by the elusive nature of this species (that also prevented it being found from the 1950s-2010s). Since, there is a lack of systematic and efficient methodology to detect a rare amphibian or aquatic species, including this Hula painted frogs, they were designated “extinct”; until their rediscovery at a later stage.

Environmental DNA (eDNA) is becoming a ‘go-to’ tool for detecting species presence in aquatic environments. eDNA extraction (genetic material extracted through water filtrate) followed by quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR is a technique to amplify genetic material in real time) are highly sensitive methods which can increase the detection probability of rare organisms. To be more reliable the researchers concluded a site to be positive for the presence of Hula painted frogs if the water contains eDNA and if the physical presence of frog is detected as well. Thus, these researchers sampled 52 sites and found that 22 sites were positive for the presence of Hula painted frogs. Most of the positive sites were located in the regions around Hula Nature Reserve, Agamon ha-Hula, and Ein Te’o Nature Reserve. These regions overlap with the former Hula Lake region, and also contain organic, and colluvial-alluvial soils.

Such findings in the regions around reserved parks indicate the importance of nature parks in conservation of wild-life. The suitable habitats predicted by employing the eDNA are of great importance for identifying potential sites for future translocation to save this rare frog.

In 2018, another article published in Nature Scientific Reports, mentioned that this species has low abundance and dispersal capability, calling for urgent conservation measures. The total estimate of potentially reproducing adults in this population (Nad) is found to be 234-235 individuals. They determined the population genetics of this species through a capture-recapture study on 118 adult frogs, and through micro-satellite analysis. Surprisingly, this frog has high genetic diversity (HO = 0.771) and low inbreeding coefficient (FIS = −0.018) with an effective population size estimate (Ne) of ~16–35. It could be due to the presence of one more unknown population or genetic admixture leading to a high genetic diversity and low inbreeding in spite of a less population. 

Future research calls for understanding the habitat locations of another population which is not well studied, or different spots within the Hula valley location in which the frog species can be present. The aquatic habitats of this species are prone to disturbance and anthropogenic hazards which could imperil the survival of endangered Hula frogs. Thus outcomes of any future research dealing with prediction of the favorable dwelling habitats of this rare species, and their habitat characterization will be vital to protect the only living member of genus Latonia, by recommending characteristics of safer spots.

<text>Leslie Earl Robertson (February 12, 1928 – February 11, 2021) was an American engineer. He was the lead structural engineer of the Twin Towers of the original World Trade Center in New York City, and served as structural engineer on numerous other projects, including the U.S. Steel Tower in Pittsburgh, Shanghai World Financial Center, and the Bank of China Tower in Hong Kong.

==Early life and education==
Robertson was born on February 12, 1928, in Manhattan Beach, California to Tinabel (née Grantham) and Garnet Robertson. His mother was a homemaker, while his father worked assorted jobs. His parents divorced when he was a child and he was brought up by his father&#x27;s second wife, Zelda (née Ziegel). He was briefly enlisted in the navy in 1945, at the age of 17. However, he did not enter active duty.

He studied civil engineering at University of California, Berkeley and graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in 1952.

==Career==
Robertson&#x27;s engineering career began in 1952, when he joined Kaiser Engineering. He worked as a mathematician, structural engineer, and electrical engineer during this time. He was also part of the investigation team studying the collapse of an offshore drilling platform. He later went on a road trip and ran out of funds in Seattle, where he then joined the Seattle-based structural and civil engineering firm Worthington and Skilling in 1958.

When Seattle-born American architect Minoru Yamasaki won the competition to design the World Trade Center, Robertson and his firm Worthington, Skilling, Helle, and Jackson (WSHJ) got the engineering contract. Designed between 1966 and 1971, this was the firm&#x27;s and Robertson&#x27;s first high rise construction. His interactions with Yamasaki led to the conceptualization of the tube design for the buildings with exterior columns that were two feet apart along the building&#x27;s height, specifically designed to provide a sense of enclosure for people in the building. This also meant that, unlike most skyscrapers of the time that were supported by concrete or steel frames with columns interrupting the interiors, the WTC design permitted column-free interiors, with the weight being handled by the exterior columns and the steel and concrete cores. Steel trusses supported the floors and connect exterior columns and the central cores.

In 1967 Robertson was made a partner in WSHJ, which was renamed Skilling, Helle, Christiansen, Robertson. The firm split its operations in 1982, with Robertson renaming the east coast operations Leslie E. Robertson Associates RLLP. Robertson would retire from the partnership in 1994, but would continue to work for the firm on projects until 2012.

In addition to the World Trade Center, he was involved in structural engineering and design for other skyscrapers, including the U.S. Steel Headquarters in Pittsburgh, the Shanghai World Financial Center, and the Bank of China Tower in Hong Kong designed by the Chinese-American architect I. M. Pei, and Puerta de Europa in Madrid. Further, Robertson engineered the building of museums in Seattle, Portland, Maine, and Berlin in addition to theaters and bridges. Robertson structurally engineered the installation of American sculptor Richard Serra&#x27;s works. He also helped coordinate the 1978 repair of New York City&#x27;s Citigroup Center, which had been built with bolted joints that placed it in serious danger of collapse during a high wind.

Since the collapse of the World Trade Center in 2001, debates about the safety of rent-space-maximized designs have engaged the building professions, but the consensus among architects and engineers is that the World Trade Center actually withstood the impact of the plane with enough time to allow many thousands of occupants to evacuate safely. Robertson&#x27;s firm later participated in the development of a database of basic structural information for the towers of the World Trade Center (WTC1 and 2) for NIST and FEMA, and to record the undocumented structural changes that had been made to the buildings after construction began. His firm also stayed for the structural engineering of the 4 World Trade Center building which came up at the same complex.

==Personal life==
Robertson was married to Elizabeth Zublin and later to Sharon Hibino, with both marriages ending in divorce. In 1982 he married SawTeen See, a structural engineer who also has served as managing partner of their architectural engineering practice, Leslie E. Robertson Associates (LERA), now called See Robertson Structural Engineers, LLC.

Robertson died from multiple myeloma at his home in San Mateo, California, on February 11, 2021, the day before his 93rd birthday.

<text>Philip Ferrari de La Renotière (January 11, 1850 – May 20, 1917) was a noted French-born stamp collector, assembling probably the most complete worldwide collection that ever existed, or is considered likely to exist. Among his extremely rare stamps were the unique Treskilling Yellow of Sweden and the 1856 one-cent &quot;Black on Magenta&quot; of British Guiana.

Of Italian family background, Ferrary took French nationality in 1871, but later became an Austrian national, a fact that ultimately led to the French government seizing, and later auctioning, his stamp collection following his death in 1917. Because France and Austria were enemies during the First World War, Ferrary was himself considered an enemy of France. His adopted nationality also prevented him from returning to France when the war began. 

Ferrary&#x27;s mother allowed the Hôtel Matignon to be used as the embassy of Austria-Hungary, with the &quot;proviso that her son could keep an extensive apartment there for the remainder of his life.&quot; Ferrary&#x27;s collection was kept at the Matignon; this building later became the residence of the Prime Minister of France. He died in Lausanne in May 1917, and was buried in Steinbach am Attersee in Upper Austria. His stamp collection is still considered to have been perhaps the greatest &quot;ever formed.&quot;

== Background ==

Ferrary was born in the sumptuous Hôtel Matignon, Rue de Varenne in Paris, where he resided until two years prior to his death. Once the festive gathering place for the &quot;Ancien Régime&quot; society, at the start of the Bourbon &quot;Restoration&quot; in 1815, Louis XVIII traded the Hôtel de Matignon for the Élysée Palace. It is now the official residence of the Prime Minister of France.

Ferrary was the son of the Duke and Duchess of Galliera. His father, Raffaele de Ferrari, came from an ancient and rich family of Genovese bankers and was a wealthy businessman made Duke of Galliera in Genoa by Pope Gregory XVI, and Prince de Lucedio by Victor-Emmanuel II, King of Italy. Raffaele de Ferrari was co-founder of the Crédit Mobilier with the Péreire brothers, rivals of the Rothschilds, who financed many of the major construction projects of the second half of the 19th century: railroads in Austria, Latin America, Portugal, upper Italy and France (the Paris-Lyon-Marseille line), the digging of the Fréjus Rail Tunnel and the Suez Canal, and the reconstruction of Paris designed by Baron Haussmann. It is said that Raffaele de Ferrari died stuck in one of his immense safes.

Ferrary&#x27;s mother, the Duchess of Galliera, born Maria de Brignole-Sale, was the great-niece of the Princess of Monaco and daughter of the Marquis Antoine de Brignole-Sale, ambassador of the Kingdom of Sardinia in Paris, under the Restoration and during the reign of Louis-Philippe. After the death of Ferrary&#x27;s father, the Duchess proposed that Philippe, Count of Paris (heir apparent to the French throne) take up residence at the Rue de Varenne. He came to occupy the ground floor of the Hôtel Matignon. The Duchess soon became disenchanted with the adverse social environment for the monarchists, quit Paris, and left Hôtel Matignon to the Austro-Hungarian Emperor, who made it his embassy in France. Upon the death of his father, Ferrary renounced all of the titles. He was then adopted by the Austrian Count de La Renotière von Kriegsfeld and he adopted Austrian nationality. It is said that Ferrary was illegitimate and that he was adopted by his natural father. Thereafter, he preferred the name &quot;Ferrary&quot;; his calling card reads &quot;Philipp von Ferrary&quot;. Collectors and dealers usually refer to him simply as &quot;Ferrary&quot;.

Ferrary adopted a new nationality more than once in his life. He was born an Italian in France, and took French nationality in 1871. After his father died in 1876, he was adopted by Count von Kriegsfeld and took Austrian nationality as mentioned above; he adopted the right of residence in Braunau in 1885, an act equivalent to taking Austrian nationality. In 1908, he took Swiss citizenship but remained an Austrian national. He was in Holland when the First World War began, and his nationality prevented him from returning to France. There is also mention that he obtained Serbian nationality through his friendly relations with the ruling Obrenović dynasty. 

Records show he may have returned to Paris in 1916, which would have been the last time he saw his collection. France seized his stamp collection as war reparations, because as an Austrian citizen he was &quot;technically an enemy of France.&quot; Ferrary had also &quot;clearly expressed pro-German views,&quot; and called Germany &quot;his dear country.&quot; Regardless, his visits to France were becoming more rare. His collection was seized &quot;under provisions of the Treaty of Versailles that came into effect in January 1920,&quot; and auctioned off after his death, from 1921 to 1926. The French government decided that proceeds from the auction would be &quot;deducted from the war reparations owed by Germany to France.&quot; The one-cent magenta was sold in 1922, to British-born American collector Arthur Hind.

== Philately ==
Ferrary started collecting in his youth, and then he inherited a great fortune of approximately 120,000,000 French francs (£5 million), which he dedicated to the purchase of rare stamps and coins. His collection is believed to have been the greatest ever assembled, and it may never be equalled. Amongst his extremely rare stamps were the unique Treskilling Yellow of Sweden and the 1856 one-cent &quot;Black on Magenta&quot; of British Guiana, which he bought in 1878 for £150 and which after his death was sold at the third bid of his collection, in 1924, at Paris for 36,000 US dollars. He also owned the only unused copy of the Two Cent Hawaii Missionary of 1851, for which its owner, Gaston Leroux, had been murdered by a fellow collector. Another piece owned by Ferrary was the only known cover featuring both values of the first Mauritius &quot;Post Office&quot; stamps, which has been called &quot;the greatest item in all philately&quot;.
He purchased many important old collections, including those of Judge Frederick A. Philbrick (1835-1910) for £7,000, Sir Daniel Cooper&#x27;s for £3,000, and W. B. Thornhill&#x27;s Australians, and was a large buyer in the leading capitals of Europe for a great many years. Stanley Gibbons said that his expenditure with them averaged from £3,000 to £4,000 a year.

According to F. J. Peplow of Great Britain, in his book &quot;The Postage Stamps of Buenos Aires&quot;, the first clue that an inverted cliché existed on the Buenos Aires “In Ps” plate of the “barquitos” (steamships) was the report of a single stamp with part of the adjoining stamp rotated 180 degrees and it had been acquired by Ferrary for his collection.
He employed Pierre Mahé, a leading Paris stamp dealer, as a consultant or curator to examine and keep order in his collection from 1874 until Mahé died in 1913. Also, he had two secretaries, who were paid large salaries: one to look after the postage stamps and the other the postcards, envelopes, and newspaper wrappers. Ferrary had his own stamp room furnished with numerous fan cabinets.

Although he lived in Paris, Ferrary travelled frequently, meeting with dealers along the way, and often paying them in gold on the spot. He was impulsive in his buying and seemed to be indifferent to price, so dealers and counterfeiters took advantage of him. Exceptionally dangerous forgeries gained the nickname &quot;Ferrarities&quot;.

== Numismatics ==

Ferrary also assembled a large collection of rare coins. His British numismatic collection was sold by Sotheby, Wilkinson &amp; Hodge in London over five days from 27–31 March 1922. The title of the sale did not mention Ferrary by name, but read as follows: “Catalogue of the Famous and Remarkable Collection of British and Colonial Coins, Patterns &amp; Proofs from George III to the Present Day, Formed by a Nobleman, Recently Deceased.” The catalogue had 710 lots and 15 plates. Other sales of his French and ancient coins were held in Paris.

== The &quot;Nobleman&quot; Sales ==
Wishing to make his unequalled collection accessible to the public, in his will dated 30 January 1915 he bequeathed it to &quot;the German nation&quot; for display in the Postmuseum in Berlin, along with funds for maintenance, 30,000 guldens. He also stipulated that the collection was &quot;not to be integrated into the existing postal museum collection&quot; but was to be &quot;exhibited in a separate room&quot;. But as a citizen of Austria living in France, World War I put him at risk. Leaving his several hundred albums in the Austrian embassy, he fled to Vienna early in 1915 and then to Switzerland where he died soon afterwards, and so did not see the dismantling of his life&#x27;s work after the war. The French government confiscated Ferrary&#x27;s collection, claiming it as a war reparation. The massive assemblage was auctioned off between 1921 and 1926, in 14 separate sales, realizing some 30 million francs.

These sales enabled several famous collectors at the time to acquire the rarest philatelic items known, which, arguably, contributed to the development of the hobby in the first part of the 20th century. The British Guiana 1c magenta was bought by American collector Arthur Hind, who outbid King George V of the United Kingdom.
The Treskilling Yellow error of Sweden, after changing hands several times, was acquired in 1937 by King Carol II of Romania. The &quot;Bordeaux cover&quot; of Mauritius &quot;Post Office&quot; stamps was acquired, at different time by collectors such as Sir Ernest de Silva, Arthur Hind, Alfred F. Lichtenstein, and Alfred H. Caspary. Caspary (a well-known New York collector) also acquired the only unused copy of the 2 cent Hawaiian Missionaries stamp, which had also belonged to Ferrary. The Buenos Aires “Barquitos” (Steamships) horizontal tête-bêche pair appeared in the Ferrary sale held on June 13, 1923. It realized FFr 37,600 (US $2,400) (including the 17.5% surcharge), an extraordinary sum for the time. It was acquired by Alfred F. Lichtenstein.

Lieut. Colonel G.S.F. Napier compiled an index of the fourteen catalogues from the sales which was sold in aid of funds for the Royal Philatelic Society London.

After the dismantling of Ferarry&#x27;s collection, these stamps have never again been (and are unlikely to ever be) part of the same philatelic collection. In that respect, Ferrary&#x27;s collection remains unique in the history of philately. Today, many of the rarest stamps extant on the philatelic market proudly bear an &quot;ex-Ferrary&quot; in their provenance, which tends to raise considerably their desirability and value.

== Death and legacy ==
Ferrary died in Lausanne, 20 May 1917. He &quot;suffered a fatal heart attack in a taxicab, reportedly returning from a visit with a local stamp dealer.&quot; His last resting place, as &quot;Philipp Arnold&quot;, is in Steinbach am Attersee, a village on Lake Attersee in the province of Upper Austria. He had been a frequent visitor to the Attersee, where he bought a house in 1890, and had been a generous benefactor to the community in the guise of &quot;a friend of Austria&quot;.

Ferrary is featured on a 1968 stamp of Liechtenstein, 30 rp red brown, Scott no. 448, SG no. 496.

<text>Kouchibouguac National Park () is a national park located on the east coast of New Brunswick in Kouchibouguac and was established in 1969 to preserve a section of the Canadian Maritime Plain region. The park includes barrier islands, sand dunes, lagoons, salt marshes, and forests. It provides habitats for approximately 50 species protected under the &quot;Canadian Species at Risk Act&quot;, including the endangered piping plover, and the second largest tern colony in North America. Colonies of harbour seals and grey seals also inhabit the park&#x27;s of sand dunes. It is also home to the extremely rare and fragile Gulf of St. Lawrence aster, though in 2006, storms eradicated most of the asters&#x27; colonies. The park&#x27;s size is . Recreational activities in the park include swimming, cycling and hiking. In recent news, the park has reported sightings of the fisher marten in the area, making it one of the few places in New Brunswick that have fisher populations. The park&#x27;s various public activities attract thousands of visitors each year. Kouchibouguac offers a range of activities, from various interpretation programs, to going seal watching, to a talk about Mi&#x27;kmaq band governments. The park is also home to the popular Kelly&#x27;s Beach.

==History==
The park was founded by Parks Canada in 1969 in order to set aside sensitive sand dunes and bogs. The region was used by local Indigenous Peoples, including the Mi&#x27;kmaq, for hunting, fishing, plant harvest, trade and living before European settlers arrived. Parks Canada encountered great difficulty expropriating land from numerous land owners who lived in seven nearby communities (approximately 215 families, including over 1200 individuals). These seven communities were Claire-Fontaine, Fontaine, Rivière au Portage, Kouchibouguac, Guimond Village, Cap St-Louis, and Saint-Olivier. The rules of the time dictated that all permanent residents had to be removed for a park to be created. These residents were mostly descendants of the Mi&#x27;kmaq, and the Acadians, whose ancestors had been deported. Most of these people&#x27;s livelihoods depended on fishing, hunting, agriculture, forestry and tourism. The residents were generally seen as so poor that government officials believed they would benefit from having to start their lives again elsewhere. The government created courses with the intent that people might lead more productive lives. Government officials believed that they were rehabilitating the people by evicting them. The residents resisted this eviction, shutting down the park on several occasions. The most notable of these was Jackie Vautour, whose home was bulldozed in 1976, but who returned to squat there two years later, where he remained until his death on February 7, 2021. Vautour&#x27;s decades-long struggle has turned him into a folk hero.

Kelly&#x27;s Beach, a very long sand dune, is a popular attraction along with a number of bogs, a boardwalk trail, eight hiking trails, a network of bicycle trails, two campgrounds, canoe and boat launch and the Cap-St-Louis fishing port. However, this beauty cannot eliminate the pain experienced by the former residents, whose story is now told in a permanent exhibit at the park&#x27;s Visitor Centre.

The park has a Mi&#x27;kmaq name which is reflected in the name of the Kouchibouguac River. The river&#x27;s name means &quot;river of the long tides&quot; in Mi&#x27;kmaq. The decision to name the park in this manner did not sit well with many local residents, Acadians who wanted a name that better reflected their identity. Many wanted the park to be called Claire-Fontaine, after one of the communities that was destroyed.

As a result of the resistance to the park, Parks Canada changed its rules, so no one would ever again experience forced removal.

Other rivers that flow through the park include the:
*Black River
*Kouchibouguacis River
*Fontaine River
*Polly&#x27;s Creek
*Portage River
*Rankin Brook

The story of the park had been the subject of two big budget documentaries. In addition, the park was the subject of a short film in 2011&#x27;s &quot;National Parks Project&quot;, directed by Jamie Travis and scored by Casey Mecija, Don Kerr and Ohad Benchetrit. There is also a website which provides access to 26 video portraits of the people removed from their land as part of the process of creating the park.

==Fauna==
Mammal species that inhabit on the land are raccoon, bobcat, moose, seven species of bats (Little Brown Myotis, Northern Long-eared Myotis, Tri-Colored Bat, Silver-Haired Bat, Hoary Bat, Eastern Red Bat, and Big Brown Bat), coyote, black bear, beaver, species of shrews and mice, river otter, porcupine, muskrat, woodchuck, mink, striped skunk, and snowshoe hare. Several species of birds of prey can be found at the park, such as bald eagle, hawks, owls, falcons, osprey and harriers. Colonies of common terns and grey seals also reside on the park&#x27;s barrier islands.

== Management ==
In 2009, Kouchibouguac National Park was designated as a Dark-sky preserve in order to protect nocturnal habitats, limit light pollution, and to increase appreciation for the cultural heritage associated with the night sky.

In 2010, a management plan was published outlining four &quot;Key Strategies&quot; pertaining to the parks management and relationship to the public. In 2017, the 2010 management plan was reviewed, including a &quot;State of the Park Assessment.&quot; Key concerns for improvement included:

* Weathering infrastructure such as roads and service buildings.
* Insufficient cultural resource preservation and access for descendant populations or visitors.
* Improving co-management relationship between stakeholders, especially between Mi&#x27;kmaq Peoples, park managers, and recognizing Indigenous values.
* Increased recreational activity, especially fishing of softshell clam and brook trout, and that the park is accessible both by land and by sea, making management of illegal activity or extreme weather events (such as wildfires or flooding) more challenging.
* Terrestrial and marine invasive species.
* Increased peripheral development projects and urbanization.
* Climate change and related symptoms, in particular sea level rise, exacerbated storms, and barrier island and dune erosion.

As of 2021, the &quot;Kouchibouguac National Park Management Plan&quot; describes a long-term plan to implement four &quot;Key Strategies&quot; into the park&#x27;s management by 2071. The Plan was created by Parks Canada in response to both the &quot;Parks Canada Agency Act&quot; and the &quot;Canada National Parks Act&quot;, and involves a variety of stakeholders, including local Indigenous Peoples, notably the Mi&#x27;kmaq, descendants of Acadian and English permanent residents who had been expropriated to create the park, economic partners, and the Canadian public. Parks Canada is required to release an annual report on the efficacy of the Key Strategies and overall progress, and to continue to receive comments from stakeholders on the implementation of the Plan over time. Parks Canada is required to officially review the Plan at least every ten years, but may do so sooner in the interest of maintaining appropriate management strategies. The Kouchibouguac National Park Management Plan&#x27;s four &quot;Key Strategies&quot; are summarized as:

# &quot;A healthy and resilient park.&quot; To properly document the environmental systems, human activity, and ecological threats in the region, and to use this information to improve its ecosystem functions and mitigate habitat degradation.
# &quot;A park at the forefront.&quot; To continue to present to visitors contemporary management strategies of the landscape, and to maintain modern, sustainably powered amenities and recreation where applicable.
# &quot;Reflection of engaged communities.&quot; To continue to include the variety of stakeholders in the decision-making process, to continue to nurture the relationships between Kouchibouguac National Park, Mi&#x27;kmaq partners, and former residents of the region, and to improve the cultural resource management of over 30 Indigenous and four non-Indigenous archaeological sites.
# &quot;Highly satisfied visitors throughout the year.&quot; To enhance the selection of year-round recreational and cultural activities for visitors while continuing to safeguard and promote ecological integrity, and to become an exemplary winter-season destination.

<doc id="209892" wikidata="Q295431" url="?curid=209892" title="Julian Barnes">
<text>Julian Patrick Barnes (born 19 January 1946) is an English writer. He won the Man Booker Prize in 2011 with &quot;The Sense of an Ending&quot;, having been shortlisted three times previously with &quot;Flaubert&#x27;s Parrot&quot;, &quot;England, England&quot;, and &quot;Arthur &amp; George&quot;. Barnes has also written crime fiction under the pseudonym Dan Kavanagh (having married Pat Kavanagh). In addition to novels, Barnes has published collections of essays and short stories, as well as two memoirs and a nonfiction book, &quot;The Man in the Red Coat&quot;, about people of Belle Époque Paris in the arts.

In 2004, he became a Commandeur of L&#x27;Ordre des Arts et des Lettres. His honours also include the Somerset Maugham Award and the Geoffrey Faber Memorial Prize. He was awarded the 2021 Jerusalem Prize.

==Early life==
Barnes was born in Leicester, in the East Midlands of England, on 19 January 1946, although his family moved to the outer suburbs of London six weeks afterwards. Both of his parents were French teachers. He has said that his support for Leicester City Football Club was, aged four or five, &quot;a sentimental way of hanging on&quot; to his home city. At the age of 10, Barnes was told by his mother that he had &quot;too much imagination&quot;.

In 1956, the family moved to Northwood, Middlesex, the &quot;Metroland&quot; of his first novel. He was educated at the City of London School from 1957 to 1964. He then went on to Magdalen College, Oxford, where he studied modern languages. After graduation, he worked for three years as a lexicographer for the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; supplement. He then worked as a reviewer and literary editor for the &quot;New Statesman&quot; and the &quot;New Review&quot;. During his time at the &quot;New Statesman&quot;, Barnes suffered from debilitating shyness, about which he has said: &quot;When there were weekly meetings I would be paralysed into silence, and was thought of as the mute member of staff.&quot; From 1979 to 1986, he worked as a television critic, first for the &quot;New Statesman&quot; and then for &quot;The Observer&quot;.

==Career==
His first novel, &quot;Metroland&quot;, published in 1980, is the story of Christopher, a young man from the London suburbs who travels to Paris, France, as a student, finally returning to London. The novel deals with themes of idealism and sexual fidelity, and has the three-part structure that is a common recurrence in Barnes&#x27;s work. After reading the novel, Barnes&#x27;s mother complained about the book&#x27;s &quot;bombardment&quot; of filth.

His second novel, &quot;Before She Met Me&quot; (1982), features a darker narrative, a story of revenge by a jealous historian who becomes obsessed with his second wife&#x27;s past. Barnes&#x27;s breakthrough novel, &quot;Flaubert&#x27;s Parrot&quot; (1984), departed from the traditional linear structure of his previous novels and featured a fragmentary biographical-style story of an elderly doctor, Geoffrey Braithwaite, who focuses obsessively on the life of Gustave Flaubert. About Flaubert, Barnes has said, &quot;he&#x27;s the writer whose words I most carefully tend to weigh, who I think has spoken the most truth about writing.&quot; &quot;Flaubert&#x27;s Parrot&quot; was published to great acclaim, especially in France, and it helped establish Barnes as a serious literary figure when the novel was shortlisted for the Booker Prize.

In 1986, Barnes published &quot;Staring at the Sun&quot;, a novel about a woman growing to maturity in postwar England and dealing with issues of love, truth, and mortality. In 1989, Barnes published &quot;A History of the World in 10½ Chapters&quot;, a nonlinear novel that uses a variety of writing styles to call into question perceived notions of human history and knowledge itself.

During the 1980s, Barnes wrote four crime novels under the name &quot;Dan Kavanagh&quot; (Barnes had recently married the literary agent Pat Kavanagh). The novels centred around the main character Duffy, a former police detective turned security advisor. Duffy is notable because he represents one of Britain&#x27;s first bisexual male detectives. Barnes has said the use of a pseudonym is &quot;liberating in that you could indulge any fantasies of violence you might have&quot;. While &quot;Metroland&quot;, also published in 1980, took Barnes eight years to write, &quot;Duffy&quot; and the rest of the Kavanagh novels typically took less than two weeks each to put to paper—an experiment to test &quot;what it would be like writing as fast as I possibly could in a concentrated way&quot;.

During the 1990s, Barnes wrote several additional novels and works of journalism. In 1991, he published &quot;Talking It Over&quot;, about a contemporary love triangle, in which the three characters take turns to talk to the reader, reflecting on common events. This was followed by a sequel published in 2000 called &quot;Love, etc&quot;, which revisited the characters ten years on. Barnes&#x27;s novel &quot;The Porcupine&quot; (1992) again deals with a historical theme as it depicts the trial of Stoyo Petkanov, the former leader of a collapsed Communist country in Eastern Europe, as he stands trial for crimes against his country. &quot;England, England&quot; (1998) is a humorous novel that explores the idea of national identity as the entrepreneur Sir Jack Pitman creates a theme park on the Isle of Wight that resembles some of the tourist spots of England. Barnes is a keen Francophile, and his 1996 book, &quot;Cross Channel&quot;, is a collection of 10 stories charting Britain&#x27;s relationship with France. He also returned to the topic of France in &quot;Something to Declare&quot;, a collection of essays on French subjects.

In 2003, Barnes undertook a rare acting role as the voice of Georges Simenon in a BBC Radio 4 series of adaptations of Inspector Maigret stories. &quot;Arthur &amp; George&quot; (2005), a fictional account of a true crime that was investigated by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, launched Barnes&#x27;s career into the more popular mainstream. It was the first of his novels to be featured on &quot;The New York Times&quot; bestsellers list for Hardback Fiction.

Barnes&#x27;s 11th novel, &quot;The Sense of an Ending&quot;, published by Jonathan Cape, was released on 4 August 2011. In October of that year, the book was awarded the Man Booker Prize. The judges took 31 minutes to decide the winner and head judge, Stella Rimington, said that &quot;The Sense of an Ending&quot; was a &quot;beautifully written book&quot; and the panel thought it &quot;spoke to humankind in the 21st Century.&quot; &quot;The Sense of an Ending&quot; also won the &quot;Europese Literatuurprijs&quot; and was on the &quot;New York Times&quot; Bestseller list for several weeks.

In 2013, Barnes published &quot;Levels of Life&quot;. The first section of the work gives a history of early ballooning and aerial photography, describing the work of Gaspard-Félix Tournachon. The second part is a short story about Fred Burnaby and the French actor Sarah Bernhardt, both also balloonists. The third part is an essay discussing Barnes&#x27;s grief over the death of his wife, Pat Kavanagh (although she is not named): &quot;You put together two people who have not been put together before . . . Sometimes it works, and something new is made, and the world is changed . . . I was thirty-two when we met, sixty-two when she died. The heart of my life; the life of my heart.&quot; In &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Blake Morrison said of the third section: &quot;Its resonance comes from all it doesn&#x27;t say, as well as what it does; from the depth of love we infer from the desert of grief.&quot;

In 2013, Barnes took on the British government over its &quot;mass closure of public libraries&quot;, Britain&#x27;s &quot;slip down the world league table for literacy&quot; and its &quot;ideological worship of the market – as quasi-religious as nature-worship – and an ever-widening gap between rich and poor&quot;.

==Personal life==
Barnes&#x27;s brother, Jonathan Barnes, is a philosopher specialising in ancient philosophy. Julian Barnes is a patron of the human rights organisation Freedom from Torture, for which he has sponsored several fundraising events, and Dignity in Dying, a campaign group for assisted dying. He has lived in Tufnell Park, north London, since 1983. Barnes is an agnostic. Barnes married Pat Kavanagh, a literary agent, in 1979. She died on 20 October 2008 of a brain tumour. Barnes wrote about his grief over his wife&#x27;s death in an essay in his 2013 book, &quot;Levels of Life&quot;.

The essays came into existence as programme notes, written by Tovey, to accompany concerts given (mostly under his own baton) by the Reid Orchestra in Edinburgh. Between 1935 and 1939, they were published in six volumes as &quot;Essays in Musical Analysis&quot;. Each volume focused on a certain genre of orchestral or choral music (for example, Volumes I and II were devoted to Symphonies; Volume III to Concertos), with many of the works discussed with the help of music examples. In 1944, a posthumous seventh volume appeared on chamber music. In 1989, a new version was published with some essays omitted and the remainder of Volumes I-VI consolidated into two volumes.

Tovey&#x27;s &quot;Essays&quot; were written as introductory notes for the concert-going public and are occasionally light-hearted in tone. Nevertheless, they analyse the pieces and describe their structure in much more depth than standard programme notes, even in a few pages each. Tovey saw his role as being &quot;counsel for the defence&quot; (Introduction to Volume I): in speaking up on behalf of the work about to be performed, he was seeking to facilitate the listener&#x27;s appreciation of its artistic content and technical merits. As a result, his approach tends to &#x27;track&#x27; the structure of a work as it unfolds through time before the ear of his imaginary &#x27;naive listener&#x27;.

<text>The British three halfpence coin was a denomination of sterling coinage worth of one pound or of one shilling. It was produced for circulation in the British colonies, mainly in Ceylon and the West Indies in each year between 1834 and 1843, and also in 1860 and 1862. Proof coins were also produced in 1870.

The coin is considered to be part of the British coinage because the territories it was struck for otherwise used standard sterling coin and had no independent monetary policy.

The coins were made of silver, weighed 0.7 grams (defined as  troy ounce) and had a diameter of . The reverse of the coin, throughout its existence, showed &quot;&quot; beneath a crown and over the date, all contained within a wreath.

As of April 2024, UMG&#x27;s catalogue includes over 3 million recordings and 4 million compositions.

==History==
===Early history===
The company&#x27;s origins go back to the formation of the American branch of Decca Records in September 1934, and its name and company logo originate from Carl Laemmle&#x27;s Universal Pictures. Although the movie studio and the music business share a common history, today the former is part of Comcast and the latter an independent commercial entity. During World War II, many record companies donated their to recycling for the war effort. However, Universal was an exception and donated more than 200,000 of their historic master recordings to the Library of Congress. The Decca Record Co. Ltd. of England spun American Decca off in 1939. MCA Inc. merged with American Decca in 1962.

In November 1990, Japanese multinational conglomerate Matsushita Electric agreed to acquire MCA for $6.59 billion. In 1995, Seagram acquired 80 percent of MCA from Matsushita. On December 9, 1996, the company was renamed Universal Studios, Inc., and its music division was renamed Universal Music Group; MCA Records continued as a label within the Universal Music Group. In May 1998, Seagram purchased PolyGram and merged it with Universal Music Group in early 1999. Seagram&#x27;s entertainment assets were then sold to French media conglomerate Vivendi in 2000, along with UMG.

===2004: Consolidating into a Vivendi subsidiary===
In May 2004, Universal Music Group was cast under separate management from Universal Studios, when Vivendi sold 80% of the latter to General Electric, who subsequently merged it with NBC to form NBCUniversal. This came two months after the separation of Warner Music Group from Time Warner. In February 2006, Vivendi purchased the remaining 20 percent of UMG from Matsushita Electric. On September 6, 2006, Vivendi announced its €1.63 billion ($2.4 billion) purchase of BMG Music Publishing; after receiving European Union regulatory approval, the acquisition was completed on June 25, 2007.

===2007–2012: UMG acquisitions and EMI purchase===
In June 2007, UMG acquired Sanctuary, which eventually became UMG&#x27;s entertainment merchandising and brand management division, Bravado. In 2008, Universal Music Group agreed to make its catalog available to Spotify, then a new streaming service, for use outside the U.S. on a limited basis.

Doug Morris stepped down from his position as CEO on January 1, 2011. Former chairman/CEO of Universal Music International Lucian Grainge was promoted to CEO of the company. Grainge later replaced Morris as chairman on March 9, 2011. Morris became the next chairman of Sony Music Entertainment on July 1, 2011. With Grainge&#x27;s appointment as CEO at UMG, Max Hole was promoted to COO of UMGI, effective July 1, 2010. In January 2011, UMG announced it was donating 200,000 master recordings from the 1920s to 1940s to the Library of Congress for preservation. In 2011, EMI agreed to sell its recorded music operations to Universal Music Group for £1.2 billion ($1.9 billion) and its music publishing operations to a Sony-led consortium for $2.2 billion. Among the other companies that had competed for the recorded music business was Warner Music Group which was reported to have made a $2 billion bid. IMPALA opposed the merger. In March 2012, the European Union opened an investigation into the acquisition The EU asked rivals and consumer groups whether the deal would result in higher prices and shut out competitors.

On September 21, 2012, the sale of EMI to UMG was approved in the European Union and the United States by the European Commission and Federal Trade Commission respectively. However, the European Commission approved the deal only under the condition the merged company divest one third of its total operations to other companies with a proven track record in the music industry. UMG divested Mute Records, Parlophone, Roxy Recordings, MPS Records, Cooperative Music, Now That&#x27;s What I Call Music!, Jazzland, Universal Greece, Sanctuary Records, Chrysalis Records, EMI Classics, Virgin Classics, and EMI&#x27;s European regional labels to comply with this condition. UMG retained the Beatles (formerly of Parlophone) and Robbie Williams (formerly of Chrysalis). The Beatles catalogue was transferred to UMG&#x27;s newly formed Calderstone Productions, while Williams&#x27; catalogue was transferred to Island Records.

===2012–2017: EMI integration and divisions reorganization===
Universal Music Group completed their acquisition of EMI on September 28, 2012. In November 2012, Steve Barnett was appointed chairman and CEO of Capitol Music Group. He formerly served as COO of Columbia Records. In compliance the conditions of the European Commission after purchase of EMI, Universal Music Group sold the Mute catalogue to the German-based BMG Rights Management on December 22, 2012. Two months later, BMG acquired Sanctuary Records for €50 million ($58 million). On February 8, 2013, Warner Music Group acquired the Parlophone Label Group (consisting of Parlophone Records, Chrysalis Records, EMI Classics, Virgin Classics and EMI Records&#x27; Belgian, Czech, Danish, French, Norwegian, Portuguese, Spanish, Slovak and Swedish divisions) for $765 million (£487 million). Later in February, Sony Music Entertainment acquired UMG&#x27;s European share in &quot;Now That&#x27;s What I Call Music&quot; for approximately $60 million. Play It Again Sam acquired Co-Operative Music for £500,000 in March 2013. With EMI&#x27;s absorption into Universal Music complete, its British operations consist of five label units: Island, Polydor, Decca, Virgin EMI and Capitol.

In September 2013, UMG received a SAG-AFTRA American Scene Award for the company&#x27;s commitment to diversity as exemplified by its &quot;entire catalog and roster of artists.&quot;

On April 1, 2014, Universal Music announced the disbandment of Island Def Jam Music, one of four operational umbrella groups within Universal Music. Universal CEO Lucian Grainge said of the closure, &quot;No matter how much we might work to build &#x27;IDJ&#x27; as a brand, that brand could never be as powerful as each of IDJ&#x27;s constituent parts.&quot; Island Records and Def Jam now operate as autonomous record labels. David Massey and Bartels, who worked respectively at Island and Def Jam Records, were named to the new record labels independently. Barry Weiss, who previously moved from Sony Music to lead Island Def Jam Music in 2012 when Motown Records was incorporated into Island Def Jam, stepped down from Universal Music.

==Criticisms and controversies ==
=== CD price fixing ===

In 2000, music companies including UMG entered into consent agreements with the Federal Trade Commission, with no admission of liability, whereby they agreed to discontinue the use of Minimum Advertised Price programs under which subsidized cooperative advertising was provided to retailers that agreed to adhere to minimum advertised pricing.

In 2002, a similar settlement was entered into with music publishers and distributors Sony Music, Warner Music, Bertelsmann Music Group, EMI Music and Universal Music Group and certain retailers, without admission of liability or wrongdoing, with various states. In settlement of the claim, the companies collectively agreed to pay a $67.4 million fine and distribute $75.7 million in CDs to public and non-profit groups. It was estimated that consumers were overcharged by $500 million and up to $5 per album.

===Payola===
In May 2006, an investigation led by then New York Attorney General, Eliot Spitzer, concluded with a determination that Universal Music Group bribed radio stations to play songs from Ashlee Simpson, Brian McKnight, Big Tymers, Nick Lachey, Lindsay Lohan and other performers under Universal labels. The company paid $12 million to the state in settlement.

===YouTube===
In 2007, with the help of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Stephanie Lenz sued UMG&#x27;s publishing company for allegedly improperly requesting that, pursuant to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, YouTube remove a 29-second home video in which Lenz&#x27;s child danced to a recording of Prince&#x27;s song &quot;Let&#x27;s Go Crazy&quot;. After years of litigation, the suit settled in 2018, prior to the court holding a trial on whether UMG had a subjective belief that the video was infringing and not fair to use before sending its request to YouTube. In April 2016, UMG had the audio muted of a video clip showing Katherine Jenkins singing the British national anthem. They claimed that the recording of &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; was copyrighted, and YouTube initially complied with this request, but subsequently offered the video with the original audio track.

===Imeem===
In December 2007, UMG announced a deal with Imeem that allowed users of the social network to listen to any track from Universal&#x27;s catalogue for free with a portion of the advertising generated by the music being shared with the record label. All traffic was redirected to MySpace after that company acquired Imeem on December 8, 2009.

===Universal archive fire (2008)===
According to Jody Rosen of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the fire which swept through Universal Studios Hollywood on June 1, 2008, caused &quot;the biggest disaster in the history of the music business&quot;. In space rented from NBCUniversal, according to an official document marked &quot;Confidential&quot;, the fire destroyed at least 118,230 &quot;assets&quot; (master recordings), or about 500,000 song titles, owned by UMG. &quot;The vault housed tape masters for Decca, the pop, jazz and classical powerhouse; it housed master tapes for the storied blues label Chess; it housed masters for Impulse!, the groundbreaking jazz label. The vault held masters for the MCA, ABC, A&amp;M, Geffen and Interscope labels; as well as some smaller subsidiary labels. Nearly all of these masters—in some cases, the complete discographies of entire record labels—were wiped out in the fire.&quot; In a statement issued on June 11, 2019, UMG said &quot;The New York Times&quot; article contained &quot;numerous inaccuracies, misleading statements, contradictions and fundamental misunderstandings of the scope of the incident and affected assets.&quot;

Following the publication of the &quot;New York Times&quot; story, Questlove of The Roots confirmed that the master tapes for two of the band&#x27;s albums, including unused material and multi-track recordings, were lost in the fire. Similarly, Nirvana bassist Krist Novoselic said he believed the masters for the band&#x27;s 1991 album &quot;Nevermind&quot; were &quot;gone forever&quot; as a result of the fire. Representatives for R.E.M. announced they would investigate the effects the fire may have had on the band&#x27;s archival materials, while Hole, Steely Dan, Rosanne Cash and Geoff Downes made statements on their possible losses from the fire.

A representative for Eminem confirmed that the rapper&#x27;s master recordings were digitized months before the fire, but could not confirm whether the physical master reels of his recordings were affected. UMG archivist Patrick Kraus assured that the Impulse! Records, John Coltrane, Muddy Waters, Ahmad Jamal, Nashboro Records, and Chess Records masters survived the fire and were still in Universal&#x27;s archive.

Howard King filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles on June 21, 2019, on behalf of Soundgarden, Hole, Steve Earle, the estate of Tupac Shakur and a former wife of Tom Petty that seeks class action status for artists whose master recordings were believed to have been destroyed in the Universal Studios fire.

===Megaupload===
On December 9, 2011, Megaupload published a music video titled: &quot;The Mega Song&quot;, showing artists including Kanye West, Snoop Dogg, Alicia Keys and will.i.am endorsing the company. The music video was also uploaded to YouTube, but was removed following a takedown request by UMG. Megaupload said that the video contained no infringing content, commenting: &quot;we have signed agreements with every featured artist for this campaign&quot;. Megaupload requested an apology from UMG, and filed a lawsuit against the company in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, on December 12, 2011.

UMG denied that the takedown was ordered under the terms of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, and said that the takedown was &quot;pursuant to the UMG-YouTube agreement,&quot; which gives UMG &quot;the right to block or remove user-posted videos through YouTube&#x27;s CMS (Content Management System) based on a number of contractually specified criteria.&quot; The video was subsequently returned to YouTube, with the reasons for the UMG takedown remaining unclear. Lawyers for will.i.am initially claimed that he had never agreed to the project, and on December 12, he denied any involvement in the takedown notice. Megaupload dismissed its case against UMG in January 2012.

===Copyright termination lawsuit===
On February 5, 2019, John Waite and Joe Ely filed a class-action lawsuit against UMG claiming that the company was violating their right to terminate grants of copyright after 35 years in accordance with copyright law of the United States by ignoring Notices of Termination. On May 3, 2019, UMG filed a motion to dismiss the case, stating the Notices of Termination were not valid because the songs were not grants of copyright but works for hire.

=== Removal of UMG songs from TikTok ===
On February 1, 2024, music released by UMG was muted or removed from TikTok after UMG and TikTok failed to reach a licensing agreement. The companies reached an agreement in May 2024 after which UMG&#x27;s music was restored.

=== Allegations by Drake ===

In a November 2024 pre-action petition, rapper Drake sought discovery from UMG and Spotify because they may have illegally conspired to use bots and payola to artificially inflate streams of Kendrick Lamar&#x27;s song &quot;Not Like Us&quot; in violation of the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act and violated New York state law against deceptive business practices and false advertising. UMG denied the claims in a statement, calling Drake&#x27;s legal arguments &quot;contrived and absurd&quot;.

<text>Permission marketing is a type of advertising in which the people who are supposed to see the ads can choose whether or not to get them. This marketing type is becoming increasingly popular in digital marketing. Seth Godin first introduced the concept in his book “Permission Marketing: Turning Strangers Into Friends, And Friends Into Customers.” 

==History==

Traditional marketing methods often involve interruption – whether a television advertisement that cuts into a TV show or an internet pop-up that interferes with a website. According to Godin, such methods (often referred to as “interruption marketing”) have become less effective in the modern world, where consumers are overloaded with information.

Interruption marketing is essentially a competition to win people’s attention. In today’s world of mass-marketing, people are overloaded with advertisements that compete for their limited time and attention span. Yankelovich, Inc claims the average consumer comes into contact with 1 million advertisements per year – or nearly 3000 per day. When there is an overflow of interruptions, people’s inevitable response is to disregard them, tune them out, and refuse to respond to them. Such traditional marketing methods are more difficult and costly to attain the same outcome.

In 1999, Godin observed that successful campaigns were the ones that sought the customer’s consent. From such observations, Godin believed that marketing strategies should be based on the following elements:

* Anticipated: people will anticipate the service/product information from the company.
* Personal: the marketing information explicitly relates to the customer.
* Relevant: the marketing information is something that the consumer is interested in.

These elements were combined to define permission marketing, first publicized in Godin’s book, “Permission Marketing: Turning Strangers into Friends and Friends into Customers”, published on May 6, 1999.

==Benefits==
Permission marketing allows consumers to choose whether or not to be subjected to marketing. This choice can result in better engagement. For example, consumers are more likely to open an email marketing message if they &quot;double opt-in&quot; than a regular &quot;single opt-in.&quot; By targeting volunteers, permission marketing improves the odds that consumers pay more attention to the marketing message. Permission marketing thus encourages consumers to engage in a long-standing, cooperative marketing campaign.

* Cost-efficiency: Permission marketing employs low cost online tools – social media, search engine optimization, e-mails, etc. Furthermore, businesses can lower their marketing costs by only marketing to consumers who have expressed an interest.
* High conversion rate: As the targeting audience has expressed an interest in the product, it is easier to convert the leads into sales.
* Personalization: Permission marketing allows businesses to run personalized campaigns; it allows them to target specific audiences according to their age, gender, geographical location, etc.
* Long-term relationships with customers: Through the usage of social media and e-mails, businesses can interact and build long-term relationships with customers.
* Marketing reputation: Permission marketing only sends information to those anticipating the information. Therefore, prospects who receive the information feel less discomfort.

==Initiation paradox==
Supporters of permission marketing claim that it is more effective than interruption marketing, however, it has been claimed that this is paradoxical in that permission marketing is inevitably initiated with interruption marketing. To get the attention of a prospective consumer for a permission-based relationship, the first step requires interruption marketing. However, many techniques in permission marketing may be seen as unreliant on interruption for contact initiation. One example that highlights both approaches is the web search results page format, which typically includes both ads (interrupting the user&#x27;s access to information) and links to information (providing the information, and often accompanied by offers for further interaction).

==Levels==
There are five levels of permission in permission marketing. These &quot;levels&quot; measure the degree of permission a consumer has granted to a specific business. At each successive level of the permission framework, the business achieves a higher efficiency state, with a decrease in marketing cost. Thus, businesses usually aim to achieve the “intravenous permission” level. However, the five levels of permission should not be considered a necessary sequential process, as more than one level could apply simultaneously depending on the nature of the business.

*Situational permission: The prospect permits the business to come into contact by providing their personal information.
*Brand trust: The prospect permits the business to continue supplying its needs. 
*Personal relationship: The prospect’s permission is granted because of a personal relationship that he/she has with someone in the provider organization.
*Points permission: At this stage, the customer has agreed to receive goods or services and has allowed the business to collect their personal data. This is usually because they are given incentives, such as exchangeable points or an opportunity to earn a prize.
*Intravenous permission: The supplier has now taken over the supply function for a specific good or a service; the customer is completely dependent on the business. This is the highest level of permission. The marketer who has taken over the intravenous permission will be making the buying decisions on behalf of their customers.

==Examples==

Early social media was a prime example – whether it is to post, share, or amplify, the marketer would have to send a friend request (or permission) to the potential prospects.

Opt-in email is an example of permission marketing, where Internet users request to receive information about a certain product or a service. Supporters of permission marketing claim it to be effective, as the potential client would be more interested in information that was requested in advance. It is also more cost-efficient than traditional marketing methods, as businesses only need to target consumers who have expressed an interest in their product.

RSS Feeds or Really simple syndication is one of the best methods for adopting permission marketing. This method lets subscribers know about the latest promotion or content through notifications.

&quot;Huffington Post&quot; is an American online news aggregator and blog which offers original content in areas including politics, business, entertainment, environment, technology, etc. The Huffington Post has a clear permission marketing-based approach: the readers must register on the site using their social media (such as Facebook, Twitter, etc.). The registration implies that readers have permitted for Huffington Post to send them marketing information, such as newsletters.

YouTube is a video-sharing website that allows users to upload, view, and share videos. Many firms utilize YouTube as part of their social media marketing strategy to promote their products and services. Firms specifically use the &quot;subscribing&quot; feature to establish a permission-based relationship with their customers. Subscription would imply that viewers have permitted for the business to market them with updated information, campaign, etc.

Sundance Vacations is a travel company that allows customers to buy vacations in bulk. The company employs a method of permission marketing by attending sporting events, shows, and more and getting people to sign up to win their annual sweepstakes. The entry forms that are filled out contain an agreement that says the company is allowed to contact the person filling the form at the methods provided by the entrant. The potential client&#x27;s signature is considered a form of consent to contact them, allowing the company to email and phone market to entrants.

He became a household name in Britain in the early 1960s for his report &quot;The Reshaping of British Railways&quot;, commonly referred to as The Beeching Report, which led to far-reaching changes in the railway network, popularly known as the Beeching Axe.

As a result of the report, just over were removed from the system on cost and efficiency grounds, leaving Britain with of railway lines in 1966. A further were lost by the end of the 1960s, while other lines were reduced to freight use only.

== Early years ==
Beeching was born in Sheerness on the Isle of Sheppey in Kent, the second of four brothers. His father was Hubert Josiah Beeching, a reporter with the &quot;Kent Messenger&quot; newspaper, his mother a schoolteacher and his maternal grandfather a dockyard worker. Shortly after his birth, Beeching&#x27;s family moved to Maidstone where his brothers Kenneth (who was killed in the Second World War) and John were born. All four Beeching boys attended the local Church of England primary school, Maidstone All Saints, and won scholarships to Maidstone Grammar School, where Richard was a prefect. Beeching and his elder brother Geoffrey attended Imperial College of Science &amp; Technology in London, where both read physics and took First Class honours degrees. His younger brothers both attended Downing College, Cambridge.

Beeching remained at Imperial College where he undertook a research PhD under the supervision of Sir George Thomson. He continued in research until 1943, first at the Fuel Research Station in Greenwich in 1936 and then the following year with the Mond Nickel Laboratories in London, where he was appointed senior physicist carrying out research in the fields of physics, metallurgy and mechanical engineering.

In 1938 he married Ella Margaret Tiley, whom he had known since his schooldays. They initially set up home in Solihull, and remained married for the rest of his life. They had no children. During the Second World War Beeching, at the age of 29, was lent by Mond Nickel on the recommendation of Dr Sykes at Firth Brown Steels to the Ministry of Supply, where he worked in its Armament Design and Research Departments at Fort Halstead. His first post was with the Shell Design Section where he had a rank equivalent to that of army captain. Whilst with Armament Design, Beeching worked under the department&#x27;s superintendent and chief engineer, Sir Frank Smith, a former chief engineer with Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI).

After the war, Smith returned to ICI as technical director and was replaced as chief engineer of Armament Design by Sir Steuart Mitchell who promoted Beeching, then 33, to the post of deputy chief engineer with a rank equivalent to that of brigadier. Beeching continued his work with armaments, particularly anti-aircraft weaponry and small arms. In 1948 he joined ICI, as personal technical assistant to Sir Frank Smith; he remained for around 18 months, working on the production lines for various products such as zip fasteners, paints and leathercloth with a view to improving efficiency and reducing production costs. He was then appointed to the Terylene Council, and subsequently to the board of ICI Fibres Division.

In 1953 he went to Canada as vice-president of ICI (Canada) Ltd, and was given overall responsibility for a terylene plant in Ontario. He returned after two years to become chairman of ICI Metals Division on the recommendation of Sir Ewart Smith. In 1957 he was appointed to the ICI board as technical director, and for a short time also served as development director.

== Stedeford Committee ==
Sir Ewart Smith, who retired from ICI in 1959, was asked by the Conservative Minister of Transport, Ernest Marples, to become a member of an advisory group on the financial state of the British Transport Commission to be chaired by Sir Ivan Stedeford. Smith declined but recommended Beeching in his place, a suggestion which Marples accepted. Stedeford and Beeching clashed on a number of issues connected with Beeching&#x27;s proposal to drastically prune Britain&#x27;s rail infrastructure. In spite of questions being asked in Parliament, Sir Ivan&#x27;s report was not published until much later.

== Government appointment ==

=== British Railways Chairman ===
On 15 March 1961 Ernest Marples announced in the House of Commons that Beeching would be the first chairman of the British Railways Board in due course, and that in the meantime he would be a part-time member of the British Transport Commission with immediate effect, becoming the chairman of the commission from 1 June 1961. The board was to be the successor to the British Transport Commission, which would be abolished by the Transport Act 1962. Beeching would receive the same yearly salary that he was earning at ICI, the controversial sum of £24,000 (over £490,000 in 2016 currency), which was £14,000 more than his predecessor Sir Brian Robertson and two-and-a-half times higher than the salary of any head of a nationalised industry at the time. Beeching was given a leave of absence for five years by ICI in order to carry out this task.

At that time the government was seeking professional advice from outside the railway industry to improve the financial position of British Railways. There was widespread concern at the time that, despite substantial investment in the 1955 Modernisation Plan, the railways continued to record increasing losses – from £15.6M in 1956 to £42M in 1960. Passenger and goods traffic was also declining in the face of increased competition from the roads; by 1960, one in nine households owned or had access to a car. It would be Beeching&#x27;s task to find a way of returning the industry to profitability as soon as possible.

=== First Beeching Report ===

On 27 March 1963, under orders from Marples, Beeching published his report on the future of the railways, entitled &quot;The Reshaping of British Railways&quot;. He called for the closure of one-third of the country&#x27;s 7,000 railway stations. Passenger services would be withdrawn from around 5,000 route miles accounting for an annual train mileage of 68 million and yielding, according to Beeching, a net saving of £18m per year. There were no proposals to improve or repurpose the usage and efficiency of the existing network or how to maintain or dispose of redundant infrastructure. The reshaping would also involve the shedding of around 70,000 British Railways jobs over three years. Beeching forecast that his changes would result in an improvement in British Railways&#x27; accounts of between £115M and £147M. The cut-backs would include the scrapping of a third of a million goods wagons, much as Stedeford had foreseen and fought against.

Unsurprisingly, Beeching&#x27;s plans were hugely controversial not only with trade unions, but with the Labour opposition and railway-using public. Beeching was undeterred and argued that too many lines were running at a loss, and that his charge to shape a profitable railway made cuts a logical starting point. As one author puts it, Beeching &quot;was expected to produce quick solutions to problems that were deep-seated and not susceptible to purely intellectual analysis.&quot; For his part, Beeching was unrepentant about his role in the closures: &quot;I suppose I&#x27;ll always be looked upon as the axe man, but it was surgery, not mad chopping.&quot;

Beeching was nevertheless instrumental in modernising many aspects of the railway network, particularly a greater emphasis on block trains which did not require expensive and time-consuming shunting &quot;en route&quot;.

Labour came to power at the general election in October 1964. On 23 December 1964, Transport Minister Tom Fraser informed the House of Commons that Beeching was to return to ICI in June 1965.

=== Second Beeching Report and creation of British Rail ===
In early 1965 Beeching unveiled the new brand for the railways – British Rail – and its &#x27;double arrow&#x27; symbol, which is still in use as the symbol of National Rail now. The legal name of the British Railways Board did not change. On 16 February Beeching introduced the second stage of his reorganisation of the railways. his second report set out his conclusion that of the of trunk railway throughout Britain, only &quot;should be selected for future development&quot; and invested in. This policy would result in traffic through Britain being routed through nine selected lines. Traffic to Coventry, Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool and Scotland would be routed through the West Coast Main Line running to Carlisle and Glasgow; traffic to the north-east would be concentrated through the East Coast Main Line which was classified as ‘not for development’ north of Newcastle; and traffic to Wales and the West Country would go on the Great Western Main Line, then to Swansea and Plymouth. Underpinning Beeching&#x27;s proposals was his belief that there was still too much duplication in the railway network, although this report did not propose any closures. Of the of trunk route, involves a choice between two routes, a choice of three, and over a further a choice of four.

These proposals were rejected by the government, which put an early end to his secondment from ICI; Beeching returned there in June 1965. It is a point of contention whether he left by mutual arrangement with the government or was sacked. Frank Cousins, the Labour Minister of Technology, told the House of Commons in November 1965 that Beeching had been dismissed by Tom Fraser. Beeching denied this, pointing out that he had returned early to ICI as he would not have had enough time to undertake an in-depth transport study before the formal end of his secondment from ICI.

== Later years ==
Upon returning to ICI, Beeching was appointed liaison director for the agricultural division and organisation and services director. He later rose to become deputy chairman from 1966 to 1968. In the 1965 Birthday Honours it was announced that he would be made a life peer, and he was created Baron Beeching, &quot;of East Grinstead in the County of Sussex&quot; on 7 July 1965, in the same year he became a director of Lloyds Bank.
In 1966 he was appointed as chairman of the Royal Commission to examine assizes and quarter sessions; he eventually proposed a mass reorganisation of the court system, involving the setting-up of regional courts in cities such as Cardiff, Birmingham and Leeds leading to the Courts Act 1971.

The following year he became chairman of Associated Electrical Industries, a role he also held with Redland from 1970 to 1977, Furness Withy from 1973 to 1975 and the Economic Insurance Company. In 1968 he was invited to deliver the MacMillan Memorial Lecture to the Institution of Engineers and Shipbuilders in Scotland. He chose the subject &quot;Organisation&quot;.

On 21 May 1969, Beeching performed the official opening ceremony for the heritage railway between Totnes and Ashburton, then known as the Dart Valley Railway.

He died at Queen Victoria Hospital, East Grinstead, in March 1985.

== Legacy ==

The Beeching Report remains controversial. Critics have accused Beeching of ignoring the social consequences of his proposals (there is little doubt that rail replacement bus services were rarely a success); encouraging car use; ignoring possible economies that might have saved lines; and, getting the figures wrong.

Some have accused him of being part of or even the scapegoat for a conspiracy against the railways involving politicians, civil servants and the road lobby. The report was commissioned by a Conservative government with strong ties to the road construction lobby and its findings were largely implemented by the subsequent Labour governments whose party received funds from unions associated with road industry associations.

Others have argued that it was ministers, not Beeching, who were responsible for any shortcomings in assessing the social case for retaining lines and that economies had been tried and largely failed; also that the road lobby was less significant than the Treasury in making policy, and the Labour Party was funded by rail unions. 

It is worth noting that the size, shape and level of service of the railway network in Great Britain was the subject of debate for many decades before the appointment of Beeching. The Salter Report of 1933 attempted to address the issue of growing abstraction of rail traffic by road and the low level of road pricing. At the appointment of the British Transport Commission in 1947, the question of uneconomic branch lines and their selection for closure was the subject of a Railway Executive branch line committee. The British Railways Modernisation Plan of 1955 stated, &quot;there will be a marked reduction in the stopping and branch-line services which are little used by the public and which, on any dispassionate review of the situation, should be largely handed over to road transport&quot;. Prime Minister Harold Macmillan stated in 1960, &quot;the industry must be of a size and pattern suited to modern conditions and prospects. In particular, the railway system must be modelled to meet current needs&quot;. In this respect, Beeching can be thus seen to have taken a courageous approach to implementing an unpopular policy which politicians had deferred for many decades.

On the other hand, Hardy points out Beeching&#x27;s political naïveté, and Fiennes notes that because a passenger service was producing a loss did not mean that it would continue to do so in the future. Like Fiennes and Hardy, Terry Gourvish&#x27;s business history of British Rail sees Beeching as having a positive effect on railway management while not achieving perfection. There is a broad consensus that the detail of figures used in individual cases were imperfect, but a wide divergence of view as to the significance of and motives for this.

Ian Hislop commented in 2008 that history has been somewhat unkind to &quot;Britain&#x27;s most hated civil servant&quot;, by forgetting that he proposed a much better bus service that ministers never delivered, and that in some ways he was used to do their &quot;dirty work for them&quot;. Hislop describes Beeching as &quot;a technocrat [who] wasn&#x27;t open to argument to romantic notions of rural England or the warp and weft of the train in our national identity. He didn&#x27;t buy any of that. He went for a straightforward profit and loss approach and some claim we are still reeling from that today&quot;.

Several ex-railway sites have been named after Beeching:
*There is a pub that was called Lord Beechings at the end of the Cambrian Railways at Aberystwyth, which until its refurbishment by Brains Brewery was decorated with various railway memorabilia, in particular regarding the Aberystwyth – London and Aberystwyth – Carmarthen service, which he closed. It was previously called The Railway until the 1990s, and in 2022 its new owner renamed it The Hoptimist, claiming that it wanted to bring people together, not isolate them.
*The Beechings Way industrial estate at Alford, Lincolnshire is so named to commemorate the loss of the former station - whose buildings lie within the estate - and line (formerly from Grimsby to London, via Louth and Peterborough) under the Beeching cuts. 
*The road Beeching Drive in Lowestoft, Suffolk, located on the site of the former Lowestoft North station is also so named. Coincidentally, a smaller pedestrian area in the vicinity is known as Stephenson&#x27;s Walk.
*The old station approach in the village of Upton, Oxfordshire, is now a cul-de-sac called Beeching Close. 
*There is a cul-de-sac in the Leicestershire village of Countesthorpe about 7 mi (11 km) south of Leicester city centre aptly named Beeching&#x27;s Close. Countesthorpe railway station was served by the former Midland Counties Railway line between Leicester and Rugby, although this was closed in January 1962, well over a year prior to the publication of &quot;The Reshaping of British Railways&quot;. The gardens of the houses on the west side of the close meet the boundary of the old line. 
*East Grinstead, where Beeching lived, was formerly served by a railway line from Tunbridge Wells (West) to Three Bridges, most of which was closed. To the east of the current East Grinstead station, the line passed through a deep cutting. This cutting currently forms part of the A22 relief road through East Grinstead. Due to the depth of the cutting, locals wanted to call the road Beeching Cut, but it was decided to call it Beeching Way.

In the late 1990s, a popular BBC sitcom, &quot;Oh, Doctor Beeching!&quot;, was set at a rural railway station in the shadow of the Beeching reforms.

<doc id="209904" wikidata="Q295162" url="?curid=209904" title="Hiroo Onoda">
<text>was a Japanese soldier who served as a second lieutenant in the Imperial Japanese Army during World War II. One of the last Japanese holdouts, Onoda continued fighting for nearly 29 years after the war&#x27;s end in 1945, carrying out guerrilla warfare on Lubang Island in the Philippines until 1974. 

Onoda initially held out with three other soldiers: one surrendered in 1950, and two were killed, one in 1954 and one in 1972. The men did not believe flyers and letters from their families stating that the war was over. They survived on wild fruits, game, and stolen rice, and occasionally engaged in shootouts with locals and the police. Onoda was contacted in the jungles of Lubang by a Japanese explorer in 1974, but still refused to surrender until he was formally relieved of duty by his former commanding officer, Major Yoshimi Taniguchi, who flew from Japan to the island to issue the order. 

Onoda surrendered on 10 March 1974, and received a hero&#x27;s welcome when he returned to Japan. That year he wrote and published a best-selling autobiography, and later moved to Brazil, where he became a cattle rancher. In 1984, Onoda returned to Japan, where he died in 2014 at the age of 91.

== Early life and service ==
Onoda was born on 19 March 1922, in Kamekawa, Wakayama, in the Empire of Japan. In 1939, he left to work at a branch of the Tajima Yoko trading company in Wuhan, China, and in 1942 was conscripted into the Imperial Japanese Army. Onoda trained as an intelligence officer at the Futamata branch of the army&#x27;s Nakano School, where he was instructed in guerrilla warfare. On 26 December 1944, Onoda was sent to lead guerrilla warfare operations on Lubang Island in the Japanese-occupied Philippines. His mission was to destroy the island&#x27;s airstrip and the pier at its harbor ahead of the Allied invasion, as well as to destroy any enemy planes or boats that attempted to land. His orders explicitly stated that under no circumstances was he to surrender or take his own life. When Onoda arrived on Lubang, he encountered officers who outranked him and prevented him from carrying out his mission, which aided United States and Philippine Commonwealth forces in capturing the island when they landed on 28 February 1945. After a short period, all but Second Lieutenant Onoda and three other soldiers (Private Yuichi Akatsu, Corporal Shōichi Shimada, and Private First Class Kinshichi Kozuka) had died or surrendered. Onoda led the three men into the island&#x27;s mountains.

== Time in hiding ==
While in hiding, Onoda and his companions continued their mission, carrying out guerrilla activities, surviving on bananas, coconuts, and stolen rice and cattle, and on several occasions engaging in shootouts with locals and the police. They successfully evaded American and Filipino search parties, and attacked villagers whom they believed to be enemy guerrillas, allegedly killing up to 30 civilians on the island during their time in hiding.

The first time Onoda&#x27;s group saw a leaflet announcing that Japan had surrendered was in October 1945; a separate group of Japanese holdouts showed them a note left behind by islanders that read: &quot;The war ended on 15 August. Come down from the mountains!&quot; The men concluded that the leaflet was Allied propaganda, and reasoned that they would not have been fired on before if the war had ended. Near the end of 1945, leaflets with a surrender order from General Tomoyuki Yamashita of the Japanese Fourteenth Area Army were dropped by air on Lubang. Onoda&#x27;s group studied them to determine whether they were genuine, and decided they were not.

Akatsu separated from the group in September 1949, and after six months on his own surrendered to Philippine forces in March 1950. The others considered this a desertion and a betrayal, and became even more cautious. In February 1952, letters from the three soldiers&#x27; families urging their surrender, along with family photographs, were dropped by air, but the group concluded that it was a trick. Shimada was wounded in the leg in a shootout with local fishermen in June 1953, after which Onoda nursed him back to health. On 7 May 1954, Shimada was killed in a shootout with a Philippine Army mountain unit who accidentally encountered the soldiers while training on the island. On 19 October 1972, Kozuka was killed in a shootout with local police while conducting a recurring raid in which he and Onoda burned piles of rice harvested by the villagers, which they intended as a signal to fellow Japanese forces that their group was still alive and carrying out its duties on Lubang. Onoda was alone from this point.

On 20 February 1974, Onoda encountered Norio Suzuki, a Japanese adventurer who was traveling around the world and had told friends he was looking for &quot;Lieutenant Onoda, a panda, and the abominable snowman, in that order&quot;. Suzuki located Onoda after four days of searching on Lubang. Onoda later described their meeting in an interview: &quot;This hippie boy, Suzuki, came to the island to listen to the feelings of a Japanese soldier&quot;. He and Suzuki became friends, but Onoda still refused to surrender, telling Suzuki that he was waiting for orders from his commanding officer. He named Major Yoshimi Taniguchi (commander of the Special Intelligence Squadron of the Fourteenth Area Army who had given Onoda his final instructions) as such, although in truth Onoda&#x27;s immediate superior was Lieutenant General Shizuo Yokoyama, the commander of the Eighth Division who had issued his orders. 

Suzuki returned to Japan with photographs of Onoda as proof of their encounter, after which the government located Taniguchi, who had become a bookseller following the war. Taniguchi flew to Lubang with Suzuki, and on 9 March met with Onoda in the jungle and issued him the following orders:

Onoda was thus relieved of duty, and on 10 March 1974 surrendered to Philippine forces at Lubang&#x27;s radar base. On 11 March, a formal surrender ceremony was held by Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos at Malacañang Palace in Manila, in an international media sensation. Marcos granted Onoda a full pardon for any crimes he had committed while in hiding. Onoda turned over his sword, a functioning Arisaka Type 99 rifle, 500 rounds of ammunition and several hand grenades, as well as a dagger his mother had given him in 1944 to kill himself with if captured. Onoda had held out for 28 years, 6 months, and 8 days (10,416 days) after Japan&#x27;s surrender in 1945. Only Private Teruo Nakamura, arrested on 18 December 1974 in Indonesia, held out longer.

== Later life ==
Onoda, who had been declared dead by the Japanese government in 1959, received a hero&#x27;s welcome upon his return to Japan in 1974. The Japanese government offered him a large sum of money in back pay, which he refused. When money was pressed on him by well-wishers, he donated it to Yasukuni Shrine.

Onoda was reportedly unhappy at receiving such attention and at what he saw as the withering of traditional Japanese values. He wrote &quot;No Surrender: My Thirty-Year War&quot;, a best-selling autobiography published in 1974. In April 1975, he followed the example of his elder brother Tadao and left Japan for Brazil, where he became a cattle farmer. He married in 1976 and assumed a leading role in the &quot;Colônia Jamic&quot; (&quot;Jamic Colony&quot;)&quot;,&quot; a Japanese Brazilian community in Terenos, Mato Grosso do Sul. After reading about a case in which a Japanese teenager murdered his parents in 1980, Onoda returned to Japan in 1984 and established the &quot;Onoda Shizen Juku&quot; (&quot;Onoda Nature School&quot;), an educational camp for young people in Fukushima Prefecture.

After the war, Filipino media interviewed villagers who had lived on Lubang during Onoda&#x27;s time in hiding and alleged that he and his men had killed up to 30 civilians. Onoda did not mention these deaths in his autobiography. In 1996, he visited the town of Looc on Lubang after his wife Machie (&quot;née&quot; Honoku) arranged a US$10,000 scholarship donation on his behalf to the local school. The town council presented Onoda with a resolution asking him to compensate the families of seven people whom he had allegedly killed, and about 50 relatives of the alleged victims staged a protest against his visit.

After 1984, Onoda spent three months of the year in Brazil and the rest in Japan. For allowing the Brazilian Air Force to conduct training sessions on his land, he was awarded the Santos-Dumont Merit Medal on 6 December 2004. On 21 February 2010, the Legislative Assembly of Mato Grosso do Sul awarded him the title of &quot;Cidadão&quot; (&quot;Citizen&quot;). In 2006, his wife Machie became head of the conservative Japan Women&#x27;s Association (JWA), which had been established in 2001 by the ultranationalist organization Nippon Kaigi.

== Death ==
On 16 January 2014, Onoda died of heart failure resulting from pneumonia at St. Luke&#x27;s International Hospital in Tokyo. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga commented on his death, saying &quot;I vividly remember that I was reassured of the end of the war when Mr Onoda returned to Japan&quot;.

<text>Phuthaditjhaba (previously Witsieshoek), is a town in the Free State province of South Africa. It is located in a section of the Drakensberg mountains (Maloti in the Sesotho language). It borders the province of KwaZulu-Natal to the south east and the independent country of Lesotho to the south west. The town was capital of the &quot;bantustan&quot;, or homeland, of QwaQwa. When apartheid ended, the town became part of the Free State province.

==History==

The frequent snow on the Drakensberg mountain peaks surrounding the town led the San to call the region QwaQwa &quot;(whiter than white)&quot;. The Afrikaners named the town &quot;Witsieshoek&quot; in honour of Oetse (also spelled Witsie and Wetsi), a Makholokoe chief who lived there from 1839 to 1856. The name Phuthaditjhaba is a Sesotho name that means &quot;meeting place of the tribes&quot;. It is located on the banks of the Elands River.

The area was historically inhabited by bantu clans of the South Sotho, namely the Makholokoe, Bataung, Bakoena and the Batlokoa.
The Orange Free State government settled these people there in the 1870s after concluding a peace settlement with their leaders. In 1926 the Orange Free State government placed the Batlokoa under the authority of the Bakoena but gave each group its own regional authority in 1930. In 1969 they were combined into a single territorial authority, which was replaced two years later by a legislative assembly. Qwaqwa was granted self-government in 1974.

In 1974 it became capital of the &quot;bantustan&quot; (or &quot;homeland&quot;) of QwaQwa. When the apartheid system was abolished in South Africa in 1994, it became part of the Free State province.

The town is the formal gateway to rural QwaQwa. Service provision in the area is difficult - the land is mountainous and homes in remote areas lack access to basic services. It is the poorest area in the Free State Province. The Mofumahadi Manapo Mopeli Regional Hospital is located here.

<text>Seymour Lubetzky (April 28, 1898 – April 5, 2003, born Shmaryahu Lubetzky) was a major cataloging theorist and a prominent librarian.

==Biography==
Born in the Russian Empire in what is now modern-day Belarus, Lubetzky worked as a teacher before he immigrated to the United States in 1927. He earned his BA from UCLA in 1931, and his MA from UC Berkeley in 1932. Lubetzky also taught at the UCLA Graduate School of Education and Information Studies, then the School of Library Service. He eventually began working at the Library of Congress where he was employed for years.

He was fluent in six languages, a fact that made him valuable both as a cataloger and a speaker at library conferences.

==Influence on Cataloging==
Lubetzky published three books that influenced the discipline of cataloging, and that are still influential in area of information technology. Librarianship in particular and information science in general had not been revolutionized as much since the likes of Antonio Panizzi, Charles Ammi Cutter or Paul Otlet. &quot;Cataloging Rules and Principles&quot; and &quot;Principles of Cataloging&quot;, as well as several periodical articles, solidified Lubetzky as one of the most significant influences in his field. He developed a rationalized approach to catalog code design, one that is even more relevant today as current cataloging principles are revisited and revised for a digital environment.

His unfinished book, &quot;Code of Cataloging Rules... unfinished draft&quot; (1960), was the basis for modern cataloging adopted by the first International Conference on Cataloguing Principles (CCP) (1961) held in Paris, France, called the &quot;Paris Principles&quot; (PP). The code which eventually emerged from the conference became the basis for cataloging practice in the 20th century. In 1967 these concepts were encoded in the Anglo-American Cataloging Rules, which were used in US, Canadian and UK libraries.

Lubetzky is credited with renewing an emphasis on the &quot;work&quot; in library catalogs. This had been a feature of book catalogs of the early 19th century, but was not carried through to the card catalog. Whereas Charles Ammi Cutter, a late 19th century influence on cataloging, had not distinguished between the idea of a &quot;book&quot; and the idea of the &quot;work&quot; in formulating his objectives, Lubetzky contrasts the two ideas, bringing back into play Anthony Panizzi&#x27;s original emphasis on the relationship between a title and all of the different editions of that title that might exist. Lubetzky&#x27;s idea was that relationships among all the editions and variations of a given work and the author of that work, in all variations of the author&#x27;s name, must be established and brought together so they can be found in one place. All the works of a given author, in all their editions, should be linked together. As Lubetzky said at a 1977 Los Angeles conference, &quot;The Catalog in the Age of Technological Change&quot;: 

The catalogue has to tell you more than what you ask for…. The answer of a good catalogue is not to say yes or no, but … to tell [the user] that the library has [the item] in so many editions and translations, and you have your choice.

==Legacy==
Two books are dedicated to the work of Lubetzky, one entitled &quot;Seymour Lubetzky: Writings on the Classical Art of Cataloging&quot; and &quot;Future of Cataloging: The Lubetzky Symposium&quot;.

In 1997 he was awarded the Melvil Dewey Medal by the American Library Association.

Just before his 104th birthday, the American Library Association awarded Lubetzky its highest honor, American Library Association Honorary Membership.

<text>Michael Antony Aston (1 July 1946 – 24 June 2013) was an English archaeologist who specialised in Early Medieval landscape archaeology. Over the course of his career, he lectured at both the University of Bristol and University of Oxford and published fifteen books on archaeological subjects. A keen populariser of the discipline, Aston was widely known for appearing as the resident academic on the Channel 4 television series &quot;Time Team&quot; from 1994 to 2011.

Born in Oldbury, Worcestershire, to a working-class family, Aston developed an early interest in archaeology, studying it as a subsidiary to geography at the University of Birmingham. In 1970, he began his career working for the Oxford City and County Museum and there began his work in public outreach by running extramural classes in archaeology and presenting a series on the subject for Radio Oxford. In 1974, he was appointed the first County Archaeologist for Somerset, there developing an interest in aerial archaeology and establishing a reputation as a pioneer in landscape archaeology—a term that he co-invented with Trevor Rowley—by authoring some of the earliest books on the subject. In 1978 he began lecturing at the University of Oxford and in 1979 became a tutor at the University of Bristol, supplementing these activities by working as an archaeological tour guide in Greece.

In 1988, Aston teamed up with television producer Tim Taylor and together they created two shows which focused on bringing archaeology into British popular consciousness. The first was the short-lived &quot;Time Signs&quot; (1991), followed by the more successful &quot;Time Team&quot;, which was produced for Channel 4 from 1994 to 2013. Aston was responsible for identifying sites for excavation and for selecting specialists to appear on the show, and through the programme became well known to the viewing public for his trademark colourful jumpers and flowing, untidy hairstyle. In 1996 he was appointed to the specially-created post of Professor of Landscape Archaeology at Bristol University, and undertook a ten-year project investigating the manor at Shapwick, Somerset.

He retired from his university posts in 2004, but continued working on &quot;Time Team&quot; until 2011 and in 2006 commenced writing regular articles for &quot;British Archaeology&quot; magazine until his death. Although Aston did not believe that he would leave a significant legacy behind him, after his death various archaeologists claimed that he had a major impact in helping to popularise the discipline among the British public.

==Biography==
===Early life and education: 1946–69===
Aston was born on 1 July 1946 into a working-class family in Oldbury, Worcestershire, to cabinet-maker Harold Aston and his wife Gladys. He developed an early interest in archaeology, although teachers at Oldbury Grammar School attempted to dissuade him from pursuing it. His father gave him two books on archaeology as a Christmas present, and he subsequently spent much time visiting archaeological sites, sometimes playing truant to do so. The first of his family to attend university, Aston studied geography at the University of Birmingham, albeit with a subsidiary in archaeology, graduating in 1967. He taught himself more about archaeology by enrolling in various excavations, and was influenced by such figures as his thesis supervisor Harry Thorpe, as well as the geographer Trevor Rowley and archaeologists Philip Rahtz and Philip Barker. His dissertation was on the development of settlement in the West Penwith peninsula in Cornwall.

===Early career: 1970–87===
Aston first gained full-time employment in 1970, working as a field officer at the Oxford City and County Museum in Oxfordshire. For a time living in a tent, he worked on the sites and monuments record and taught several extramural classes while based at the museum. This extramural teaching fitted closely with Aston&#x27;s staunch belief that archaeology should be open to all who were interested in it. As part of this devotion to public outreach, he presented a radio series on archaeology that was broadcast on Radio Oxford. In 1974 he moved to Taunton to become the first County Archaeologist for Somerset, where he set up a new site record and oversaw the excavation of sites revealed by the construction of the M5 motorway. Again he also taught extramural adult education classes, this time for the University of Bristol. It was here that he developed a passion for aerial archaeology, and would often charter private planes in order to undertake aerial photography. Becoming a pioneer of landscape archaeology, along with Trevor Rowley he was responsible for coining the term in their 1974 book, &quot;Landscape Archaeology&quot;. With archaeologist James Bond he authored &quot;The Landscape of Towns&quot; (1976), in which he extended his use of landscape archaeology to urban areas. Recognising his contribution to the discipline, in 1976, he was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London.

Tiring of his position as county archaeologist, finding it &quot;too safe, pensionable and superannuable&quot;, in 1978 he returned to Oxfordshire to take up a temporary position as a tutor in archaeology and local studies at Oxford University&#x27;s External Studies Department. That year he co-ran his first study tour to Greece with Peter Hardy; he would continue to run these annually for a number of years, most often visiting Santorini. In 1979 he returned to the West Country as tutor in archaeology at the University of Bristol&#x27;s Extra-Mural Department, through which he organised weekend and evening courses throughout the region, introducing thousands of interested people to archaeology. During this period he also authored &quot;Interpreting the Landscape&quot; (1985).

===Founding &quot;Time Team&quot;: 1988–95===
In June 1988 the producer Tim Taylor invited Aston to work on a new four-episode television series for Channel 4 called &quot;Time Signs&quot;, broadcast in June and July 1991. The series focused on the historical development of the area about to be flooded by the Roadford Reservoir in Devon, making heavy use of archaeological data. Aston brought archaeologist Phil Harding into the project in order to explain techniques of experimental archaeology to the audience. Meanwhile, in August 1989, Aston was promoted to the position of Reader in Landscape Archaeology at Bristol University. He also continued to write on the subject, authoring the book &quot;Monasteries&quot; (1993); he had initially planned to title the volume &quot;Monasteries in the Landscape&quot; but his publisher, Batsford, had insisted on the shorter title.

Aston and Taylor subsequently decided to work together on a new archaeological television series, devising the format for &quot;Time Team&quot;. Whilst Taylor organised the film production side of the project with Channel 4, Aston located suitable sites to excavate, and gathered together a team of specialists to appear on the show, among them field archaeologists Harding and Carenza Lewis, artist Victor Ambrus, and historian Robin Bush. He knew the actor and television presenter Tony Robinson after they had met on an archaeological course in Greece, and successfully requested that he present the show. From an early stage, they had agreed that every episode would feature a practical process or a re-enactment alongside the field archaeology.

&quot;Time Team&quot; was first broadcast in 1994, and would attract around four million viewers per episode, with Aston becoming &quot;an icon to the viewing public.&quot; Writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Christopher Dyer noted that Aston&#x27;s &quot;unkempt hair and beard, multicoloured sweaters and Black Country accent made him instantly recognisable&quot; to the British public, describing him as &quot;a popular success&quot; who had attracted &quot;a large public following&quot;. Aston acted as chief archaeological adviser to the programme until the end of series nineteen, appearing in almost every episode, although he would later comment that when it first started he had no idea it would continue for so long. Aston enjoyed working with the &quot;Time Team&quot; crew, commenting that they were &quot;a great gang ... There are some real party people.&quot;

Aston saw &quot;Time Team&quot; as an extension of his work as an extramural tutor, telling a 2013 interviewer that it was &quot;a way of reaching 3 million people rather than 30 people in the village hall.&quot; Commenting on the popularity of &quot;Time Team&quot;, and its role in exposing the British public to archaeology, in a 2010 interview Aston remarked that &quot;My motive was to get as many people as possible interested in archaeology, because we [in the profession] all enjoy it and think it interesting. That was my personal aim ... and on that basis I think it is a success.&quot; &quot;Time Team&quot; encouraged wider public interest in archaeology and led to increasing numbers of students applying to study archaeological courses at British universities, while subscriptions to &quot;Current Archaeology&quot; magazine quadrupled to 18,000 in the show&#x27;s first five years. In autumn 1998, Channel 4 started a &quot;Time Team&quot; fan club, which had 16,000 members within a few months, while Aston became a supporter of the Council for British Archaeology&#x27;s Young Archaeologists&#x27; Club (YAC), and with Harding gave regular talks to YAC branches. Aston found himself giving up to 20 public lectures a year on the subject of &quot;Time Team&quot;, describing the public feedback as &quot;embarrassingly encouraging&quot;.

===Professorship: 1996–2011===
In 1996, Aston was appointed to the position of Professor of Landscape Archaeology at Bristol University&#x27;s Department of Continuing Education, a post designed explicitly for him. In 1998 the post was moved to the Centre for the Historic Environment within the Department of Archaeology. He would subsequently be instrumental in setting up the master&#x27;s degree in archaeology and screen media at the department. By 1996, Aston was feeling &quot;a bit frustrated&quot; with &quot;Time Team&quot;, primarily because he was always &quot;number two&quot; to Robinson. He proceeded to present his own six-episode series, &quot;Time Traveller&quot;, in which he explored various archaeological sites in the counties around Bristol. It was broadcast on HTV over July and August 1997, and gained the largest local audiences for its time slot.

The archaeology students of King Alfred&#x27;s College, Winchester also participated in a 10-year project led by Aston to investigate the manor of Shapwick in Somerset. It became the &quot;type site for the study of the development of medieval villages&quot;. Aston published the results of the project in &quot;The Shapwick Project, Somerset: A Rural Landscape Explored&quot; (2007), co-written with Christopher Gerrard, and this was followed by a more popular account of the project, &quot;Interpreting the English Village&quot;, in 2013.

Alongside his academic publications, Aston wrote two books on archaeology for a more general audience, both of which were published by Channel 4 Books as a spin-off from the &quot;Time Team&quot; television series. The first of these was &quot;Time Team&#x27;s Timechester: A Companion to Archaeology&quot;, co-written with Carenza Lewis and Phil Harding and first published in 2000. Based around the fictional British town of Timechester, the book looks at how the settlement would have progressed from the Palaeolithic through to the modern day, and examines the remains that each period would have left behind in the archaeological record. This was followed in 2002 by &quot;Archaeology is Rubbish: A Beginner&#x27;s Guide&quot;, which Aston co-wrote with Tony Robinson and dedicated to Harding. &quot;Archaeology is Rubbish&quot; describes a fictional excavation site in an ordinary suburban back garden, and discusses the evidence from different archaeological periods, the field methods and techniques used by the excavators, and the legal proceedings and problems that archaeologists in Britain face.

Aston retired from Bristol University in 2004, subsequently becoming Professor Emeritus. He was also appointed an Honorary Visiting Professor at the University of Exeter, University of Durham, and the University of Worcester. That year, the University of Winchester awarded him an honorary Doctor of Letters. In 2006 Aston began writing a regular column, &quot;Mick&#x27;s Travels&quot;, for the bimonthly journal &quot;British Archaeology&quot;, the publication of the Council for British Archaeology. In 2007, Worcester University awarded Aston an honorary doctorate; that same year a number of his colleagues released a &quot;festschrift&quot; in his honour entitled &quot;People and Places: Essays in Honour of Michael Aston&quot;.

===Final years: 2012–13===
In February 2012, it was reported that Aston had left &quot;Time Team&quot;. He explained his position to the &quot;Western Daily Press&quot;, stating that the show&#x27;s producers had made a number of changes to the series without consulting him, and that in the process &quot;Time Team&quot; had been &quot;dumbed down&quot;, something he considered bad for archaeology. He was annoyed that a number of archaeologists—including surveyor Stewart Ainsworth, small finds specialist Helen Geake and illustrator Victor Ambrus—had seen their roles diminished while a new co-presenter, Mary-Ann Ochota, had been introduced, and that as a result the episodes now contained &quot;a lot of faffing about.&quot; In an interview with the magazine &quot;British Archaeology&quot; Aston said: &quot;The time had come to leave. I never made any money out of it, but a lot of my soul went into it. I feel really, really angry about it.&quot;

In July 2012, Aston received a lifetime achievement award at the British Archaeological Awards, with Bristol University&#x27;s professor Mark Horton praising him for making &quot;the past accessible to all&quot;. In October, Channel 4 announced that the twentieth series of &quot;Time Team&quot; would be its last as the show was being axed. In December, Aston signed a petition advocating his support for the revamp of the Somerset Rural Life Museum in Glastonbury, which was then seeking financial backers.

On 24 June 2013, it was announced that Aston had died unexpectedly of a brain haemorrhage at his home in Somerset. He had been due to receive an honorary doctorate from University College Dublin that September. Ralph Lee, head of Channel 4&#x27;s factual programming, announced that they had been &quot;terribly saddened&quot; by the news, and that they were planning a &quot;tribute night&quot; to Aston consisting of &quot;Time Team&quot; episodes to be screened on More4 on 13 July.

==Selected works==
==Personal life==
Aston was known for his &quot;unfailing commitment and integrity&quot;, with his life being dominated by &quot;old-fashioned idealism and loyalty&quot;. He was a vegetarian and a naturist, as well as an anarchist and an atheist. Describing himself as &quot;a keen European&quot;, a friend of his noted that he &quot;railed against right-wing politics, reserving special venom for Margaret Thatcher, and fought against all manner of authority, including university paperwork, and most especially if it came in a uniform.&quot;

His hobbies included gardening, pottery, astronomy, listening to classical music and cooking. He supported a number of charities and other causes, including Greenpeace, the Woodland Trust, Oxfam and Sightsavers International. He liked to live a private, hermit-like life, and once commented that &quot;For some of the time I feel I could be a monk&quot; but that he &quot;couldn&#x27;t cope with the celibacy.&quot; A self-described &quot;solitary person&quot;, he found it somewhat annoying being a television celebrity and being recognised by members of the public.

Aston had a son, James, and a stepdaughter, Kathryn, both children of his former partner Carinne Allinson, from whom he separated in 1998. He later entered into a relationship with landscape historian Teresa Hall, who survived him on his death. He lived in what he called &quot;a rather grotty &#x27;60s bungalow&quot; in Somerset. When reporter Steve Eggington visited Aston&#x27;s home in 2008, he noted that it was filled with &quot;a labyrinth of books and maps, seemingly with different projects at different stages in each room.&quot;

Aston commented that throughout his life he suffered from poor health; he was afflicted with aspergillosis from the early 1980s, and was also asthmatic. He suffered a brain haemorrhage in March 2003, and was hospitalised for two weeks. The experience sent him into depression for eighteen months, during which time he read the autobiography of actress Jane Lapotaire, who had gone through the same experience, something which he believed aided his recovery more than anything else.

==Legacy==
Aston did not believe that he would leave a significant legacy. He commented that this was the case because Britain&#x27;s archaeological community had failed to develop the work that he had done with &quot;Time Team&quot; and with extramural teaching, and that all the public outreach he had accomplished would die with him. He felt that there was no &quot;celebrity archaeologist&quot; to replace him, and ultimately felt that the situation in British archaeology made him &quot;angry and sad.&quot;

In &quot;British Archaeology&quot; magazine, Aston was described as &quot;the Mortimer Wheeler of our times&quot; because, despite strong differences between their personalities, both had done much to bring archaeology to the British public. It went on to note that Aston reminded archaeologists that &quot;their job is to do archaeology, and if that was an archaeology that meant nothing to ordinary people, there was no point in it—and government would be among the first to notice.&quot; Two of Aston&#x27;s colleagues from Bristol University, Stuart Prior and Mark Horton, commented that &quot;Mick brought archaeology into the living rooms of half the nation, and left a legacy that will shape the discipline for decades to come.&quot; Writing for the website of &quot;Antiquity&quot;, Christopher Gerrard described him as &quot;perhaps the best-known face in British archaeology&quot;, adding that &quot;in so many different areas of medieval archaeology his legacy will live on.&quot; Emma McFarnon described Aston as &quot;Somerset&#x27;s premier archaeologist&quot; in her obituary on the This is Somerset website.

Following Aston&#x27;s death, former colleague Francis Pryor noted that Aston was a &quot;remarkable archaeologist who could really dig&quot;, being a &quot;warm, loving, nice man.&quot; Another colleague, Phil Harding, commented on Aston&#x27;s &quot;incredible knowledge&quot; and &quot;effortless way of making archaeology accessible to people.&quot; Tony Robinson wrote of him: &quot;Mick was a real child of the &#x27;60s and a bit of a rebel, but he was also a series of contradictions. He was one of the best academic archaeologists in the country, yet his real love was teaching ordinary people. He was the grumpiest old Black Country curmudgeon you could imagine, but he had a heart of absolute gold.&quot; He also noted that &quot;archaeology is now a subject that tens of thousands of people enjoy and value, and this is almost solely down to him.&quot; Ralph Lee, head of Channel 4&#x27;s factual programming, described Aston as a &quot;brilliant communicator&quot; who helped make archaeology &quot;so popular&quot; in the UK.

===Sculpture at Bristol University===
A bronze bust of Mick Aston was unveiled at the University of Bristol on 26 March 2018. The bust, created by sculptor Alex Peter, has been installed at the Department of Anthropology and Archaeology in a ceremony that his former partner Teresa Hall and colleagues attended. Aston worked at the University for more than 25 years and was a familiar face on &quot;Time Team&quot; for 19 years. Sculptor Alex Peter said: &quot;To acknowledge Aston for his academic contributions is a beautiful and a very meaningful thing.&quot; Fellow archaeologist Mark Horton stated: &quot;Mick was such an amazing archaeologist in so many different ways.&quot;

<doc id="209918" wikidata="Q272322" url="?curid=209918" title="Ælfweard of Wessex">
<text>Ælfweard (; c. 902 – 2 August 924) was the second son of Edward the Elder, the eldest born to his second wife Ælfflæd.

==Kingship and death==
The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; simply states that Ælfweard died soon after his father&#x27;s death on 17 July 924 and that they were buried together at Winchester. Manuscript D of the &quot;Chronicle&quot; specifies that he outlived his father by only 16 days. No reign is explicitly attributed to him here. However, a list of West-Saxon kings in the 12th-century &quot;Textus Roffensis&quot; mentions him as his father&#x27;s successor, with a reign of four weeks. He is also described as king in the New Minster &quot;Liber Vitae&quot;, an 11th-century source based in part on earlier material. On the other hand, William of Malmesbury, summarising a text dating to the lifetime of Ælfweard&#x27;s elder brother Æthelstan, states that Æthelstan succeeded under the terms of his father&#x27;s will. 

This conflicting documentation has led to alternative interpretations, some modern historians concluding that he had succeeded his father in preference to his older half-brother Æthelstan, while others maintain that Æthelstan was the only heir to his father. Alternatively, a divided rule has been suggested, since the so-called Mercian register of the &quot;Chronicle&quot; reports that Æthelstan became king of the Mercians, and William of Malmesbury, though denying a reign for Ælfweard, reports that Æthelstan was educated at the Mercian court of his aunt Æthelflæd. In the view of Simon Keynes, Ælfweard was recognised as king in Wessex and Æthelstan in Mercia, and although it is possible that Edward intended a division of the kingdom after his death, it is more likely that the leaders of Wessex chose Ælfweard, and Mercia set up Æthelstan in opposition.

Ælfweard died only 16 days after his father, on 2 August 924 at Oxford, and was buried at the New Minster, Winchester. Æthelstan still had difficulty in securing acceptance in Wessex, and he was not crowned King of the Anglo-Saxons until 4 September 925.

<doc id="209919" wikidata="Q1544924" url="?curid=209919" title="Musical analysis">
<text>Musical analysis is the study of musical structure in either compositions or performances. According to music theorist Ian Bent, music analysis &quot;is the means of answering directly the question &#x27;How does it work?&#x27;&quot;. The method employed to answer this question, and indeed exactly what is meant by the question, differs from analyst to analyst, and according to the purpose of the analysis. According to Bent, &quot;its emergence as an approach and method can be traced back to the 1750s. However it existed as a scholarly tool, albeit an auxiliary one, from the Middle Ages onwards.&quot;

The principle of analysis has been variously criticized, especially by composers, such as Edgard Varèse&#x27;s claim that, &quot;to explain by means of [analysis] is to decompose, to mutilate the spirit of a work&quot;.

==Analyses==
Some analysts, such as Donald Tovey (whose &quot;Essays in Musical Analysis&quot; are among the most accessible musical analyses) have presented their analyses in prose. Others, such as Hans Keller (who devised a technique he called &quot;Functional Analysis&quot;) used no prose commentary at all in some of their work.

There have been many notable analysts other than Tovey and Keller. One of the best known and most influential was Heinrich Schenker, who developed Schenkerian analysis, a method that seeks to describe all tonal classical works as elaborations (&quot;prolongations&quot;) of a simple contrapuntal sequence. Ernst Kurth coined the term of &quot;developmental motif&quot; . Rudolph Réti is notable for tracing the development of small melodic motifs through a work, while Nicolas Ruwet&#x27;s analysis amounts to a kind of musical semiology.

Musicologists associated with the new musicology often use musical analysis (traditional or not) along with or to support their examinations of the performance practice and social situations in which music is produced and that produce music, and vice versa. Insights from the social considerations may then yield insight into analysis methods.

Edward T. Cone argues that musical analysis lies in between description and prescription. Description consists of simple non-analytical activities such as labeling chords with Roman numerals or tone-rows with integers or row-form, while the other extreme, prescription, consists of &quot;the insistence upon the validity of relationships not supported by the text.&quot; Analysis must, rather, provide insight into listening without forcing a description of a piece that cannot be heard.

==Techniques==
Many techniques are used to analyze music. Metaphor and figurative description may be a part of analysis, and a metaphor used to describe pieces, &quot;reifies their features and relations in a particularly pungent and insightful way: it makes sense of them in ways not formerly possible.&quot; Even absolute music may be viewed as a &quot;metaphor for the universe&quot; or nature as &quot;perfect form&quot;.

===Discretization===
The process of analysis often involves breaking the piece down into relatively simpler and smaller parts. Often, the way these parts fit together and interact with each other is then examined. This process of discretization or segmentation is often considered, as by Jean-Jacques Nattiez, necessary for music to become accessible to analysis. Fred Lerdahl argues that discretization is necessary even for perception by learned listeners, thus making it a basis of his analyses, and finds pieces such as &quot;Artikulation&quot; by György Ligeti inaccessible, while Rainer Wehinger created a &quot;Hörpartitur&quot; or &quot;score for listening&quot; for the piece, representing different sonorous effects with specific graphic symbols much like a transcription.

===Composition===
Analysis often displays a compositional impulse while compositions often &quot;display an &quot;analytical&quot; impulse&quot; but &quot;though intertextual analyses often succeed through simple verbal description there are good reasons to literally compose the proposed connections. We actually &quot;hear&quot; how these songs [different musical settings of Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Nur wer die Sehnsucht kennt&quot;] resonate with one another, comment upon and affect one another ... in a way, the music speaks for itself&quot;. This analytic bent is obvious in recent trends in popular music including the mash-ups of various songs.

== Analytical situations ==

Analysis is an activity most often engaged in by musicologists and most often applied to western classical music, although music of non-western cultures and of unnotated oral traditions is also often analysed. An analysis can be conducted on a single piece of music, on a portion or element of a piece or on a collection of pieces. A musicologist&#x27;s stance is his or her analytical situation. This includes the physical dimension or corpus being studied, the level of stylistic relevance studied, and whether the description provided by the analysis is of its immanent structure, compositional (or poietic) processes, perceptual (or esthesic) processes, all three, or a mixture.

Stylistic levels may be hierarchized as an inverted triangle:
*universals of music
**system (style) of reference
***style of a genre or an epoch
****style of composer X
*****style of a period in the life of a composer
******work

Nattiez outlines six analytical situations, preferring the sixth::
Examples:
# &quot;...tackles only the immanent configuration of the work.&quot; Allen Forte&#x27;s musical set theory
# &quot;...proceed[s] from an analysis of the neutral level to drawing conclusions about the poietic&quot; – Reti analysis of Debussy&#x27;s &quot;La cathédrale engloutie&quot;
# The reverse of the previous, taking &quot;a poietic document—letters, plans, sketches— ... and analyzes the work in the light of this information.&quot; Paul Mie, &quot;stylistic analysis of Beethoven in terms of the sketches&quot;
# The most common, grounded in &quot;perceptive introspection, or in a certain number of general ideas concerning musical perception ... a musicologist ... describes what they think is the listener&#x27;s perception of the passage&quot;, analysis of measures 9–11 of Bach&#x27;s C minor fugue in Book I of the &quot;Well-Tempered Clavier&quot;
# &quot;Begins with information collected from listeners to attempt to understand how the work has been perceived ... obviously how experimental psychologists would work&quot;
# &quot;The case in which an immanent analysis is equally relevant to the poietic as to the esthesic.&quot; Schenkerian analysis, which, based on the sketches of Beethoven (external poietics) eventually show through analysis how the works must be played and perceived (inductive esthesics)

===Compositional analysis===
Jacques Chailley views analysis entirely from a compositional viewpoint, arguing that, &quot;since analysis consists of &#x27;putting oneself in the composer&#x27;s shoes,&#x27; and explaining what he was experiencing as he was writing, it is obvious that we should not think of studying a work in terms of criteria foreign to the author&#x27;s own preoccupations, no more in tonal analysis than in harmonic analysis.&quot;

===Perceptual analysis===
On the other hand, Fay argues that, &quot;analytic discussions of music are often concerned with processes that are not immediately perceivable. It may be that the analyst is concerned merely with applying a collection of rules concerning practice, or with the description of the compositional process. But whatever he [or she] aims, he often fails—most notably in twentieth-century music—to illuminate our immediate musical experience,&quot; and thus views analysis entirely from a perceptual viewpoint, as does Edward T. Cone, &quot;true analysis works through and for the ear. The greatest analysts are those with the keenest ears; their insights reveal how a piece of music should be heard, which in turn implies how it should be played. An analysis is a direction for performance,&quot; and Thomson: &quot;It seems only reasonable to believe that a healthy analytical point of view is that which is so nearly isomorphic with the perceptual act.&quot;

===Analyses of the immanent level===
Analyses of the immanent level include analyses by Alder, Heinrich Schenker, and the &quot;&quot;ontological&quot; structuralism&quot; of the analyses of Pierre Boulez, who says in his analysis of &quot;The Rite of Spring&quot;, &quot;must I repeat here that I have not pretended to discover a creative process, but concern myself with the result, whose only tangibles are mathematical relationships? If I have been able to find all these structural characteristics, it is because they are there, and I don&#x27;t care whether they were put there consciously or unconsciously, or with what degree of acuteness they informed [the composer&#x27;s] understanding of his conception; I care very little for all such interaction between the work and &#x27;genius&#x27;.&quot;

Again, Nattiez argues that the above three approaches, by themselves, are necessarily incomplete and that an analysis of all three levels is required. Jean Molino shows that musical analysis shifted from an emphasis upon the poietic vantage point to an esthesic one at the beginning of the eighteenth century.

===Nonformalized analyses===
Nattiez distinguishes between nonformalized and formalized analyses. Nonformalized analyses, apart from musical and analytical terms, do not use resources or techniques other than language. He further distinguishes nonformalized analyses between impressionistic, paraphrases, or hermeneutic readings of the text (&quot;explications de texte&quot;). Impressionistic analyses are in &quot;a more or less high-literary style, proceeding from an initial selection of elements deemed characteristic,&quot; such as the following description of the opening of Claude Debussy&#x27;s &quot;Prelude to the Afternoon of a Faun&quot;: &quot;The alternation of binary and ternary divisions of the eighth notes, the sly feints made by the three pauses, soften the phrase so much, render it so fluid, that it escapes all arithmetical rigors. It floats between heaven and earth like a Gregorian chant; it glides over signposts marking traditional divisions; it slips so furtively between various keys that it frees itself effortlessly from their grasp, and one must await the first appearance of a harmonic underpinning before the melody takes graceful leave of this causal atonality&quot;.

Paraphrases are a &quot;respeaking&quot; in plain words of the events of the text with little interpretation or addition, such as the following description of the &quot;Bourée&quot; of Bach&#x27;s &quot;Third Suite&quot;: &quot;An anacrusis, an initial phrase in D major. The figure marked (a) is immediately repeated, descending through a third, and it is employed throughout the piece. This phrase is immediately elided into its consequent, which modulates from D to A major. This figure (a) is used again two times, higher each time; this section is repeated.&quot;

&quot;Hermeneutic reading of a musical text is based on a description, a &#x27;naming&#x27; of the melody&#x27;s elements, but adds to it a hermeneutic and phenomenological depth that, in the hands of a talented writer, can result in genuine interpretive masterworks... All the illustrations in Abraham&#x27;s and Dahlhaus&#x27;s &quot;Melodielehre&quot; (1972) are historical in character; Rosen&#x27;s essays in &quot;The Classical Style&quot; (1971) seek to grasp the essence of an epoch&#x27;s style; Meyer&#x27;s analysis of Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Farewell&quot; Sonata penetrates melody from the vantage point of perceived structures.&quot; He gives as a last example the following description of Franz Schubert&#x27;s &quot;Unfinished Symphony&quot;: &quot;The transition from first to second subject is always a difficult piece of musical draughtsmanship; and in the rare cases where Schubert accomplishes it with smoothness, the effort otherwise exhausts him to the verge of dullness (as in the slow movement of the otherwise great A minor Quartet). Hence, in his most inspired works the transition is accomplished by an abrupt &quot;&quot;; and of all such &quot;coups&quot;, no doubt the crudest is that in the Unfinished Symphony. Very well then; here is a new thing in the history of the symphony, not more new, not more simple than the new things which turned up in each of Beethoven&#x27;s nine. Never mind its historic origin, take it on its merits. Is it not a most impressive moment?&quot;.

===Formalized analyses===
Formalized analyses propose models for melodic functions or simulate music. Meyer distinguishes between global models, which &quot;provide an image of the whole corpus being studied, by listing characteristics, classifying phenomena, or both; they furnish statistical evaluation,&quot; and linear models which &quot;do not try to reconstitute the whole melody &quot;in order of&quot; real time succession of melodic events. Linear models ... describe a corpus by means of a system of rules encompassing not only the hierarchical organization of the melody, but also the &quot;distribution&quot;, environment, and context of events, examples including the explanation of &#x27;succession of pitches in New Guinean chants in terms of distributional constraints governing each melodic interval&#x27; by Chenoweth the transformational analysis by Herndon, and the &#x27;grammar for the soprano part in Bach&#x27;s chorales [which,] when tested by computer ... allows us to generate melodies in Bach&#x27;s style&#x27; by Baroni and Jacoboni.

Global models are further distinguished as analysis by traits, which &quot;identify the presence or absence of a particular variable, and makes a collective image of the song, genre, or style being considered by means of a table, or classificatory analysis, which sorts phenomena into classes,&quot; one example being &quot;trait listing&quot; by Helen Roberts, and classificatory analysis, which &quot;sorts phenomena into classes,&quot; examples being the universal system for classifying melodic contours by Kolinski. Classificatory analyses often call themselves taxonomical. &quot;Making the basis for the analysis explicit is a fundamental criterion in this approach, so &quot;delimiting&quot; units is always accompanied by carefully &quot;defining&quot; units in terms of their constituent variables.&quot;

===Intermediary analyses===
Nattiez lastly proposes intermediary models &quot;between reductive formal precision, and impressionist laxity.&quot; These include Schenker, Meyer (classification of melodic structure), Narmour, and Lerdahl-Jackendoff&#x27;s &quot;use of graphics without appealing to a system of formalized rules,&quot; complementing and not replacing the verbal analyses. These are in contrast to the formalized models of Milton Babbitt and Boretz. According to Nattiez, Boretz &quot;seems to be confusing his own formal, logical model with an immanent essence he then &quot;ascribes&quot; to music,&quot; and Babbitt &quot;defines a musical theory as a hypothetical-deductive system ... but if we look closely at what he says, we quickly realize that the theory &quot;also&quot; seeks to legitimize a music yet to come; that is, that it is also normative ... transforming the &quot;value&quot; of the theory into an aesthetic &quot;norm&quot; ... from an anthropological standpoint, that is a risk that is difficult to countenance.&quot; Similarly, &quot;Boretz enthusiastically embraces logical formalism, while evading the question of knowing how the data—whose formalization he proposes—have been obtained&quot;.

==Divergent analyses==

Typically a given work is analyzed by more than one person and different or divergent analyses are created. For instance, the first two bars of the prelude to Claude Debussy&#x27;s &quot;Pelléas et Mélisande&quot;:

are analyzed differently by Leibowitz Laloy, van Appledorn, and Christ. Leibowitz analyses this succession harmonically as D minor:I–VII–V, ignoring melodic motion, Laloy analyses the succession as D:I–V, seeing the G in the second measure as an ornament, and both van Appledorn and Christ analyses the succession as D:I–VII.

Nattiez argues that this divergence is due to the analysts&#x27; respective analytic situations, and to what he calls transcendent principles (1997b: 853, what George Holton might call &quot;themata&quot;), the &quot;philosophical project[s]&quot;, &quot;underlying principles&quot;, or a prioris of analyses, one example being Nattiez&#x27;s use of the tripartitional definition of &quot;sign&quot;, and what, after epistemological historian Paul Veyne, he calls &quot;plots&quot;.

Van Appledorn sees the succession as D:I–VII so as to allow the interpretation of the first chord in measure five, which Laloy sees as a dominant seventh on D (V/IV) with a diminished fifth (despite that the IV doesn&#x27;t arrive till measure twelve), while van Appledorn sees it as a French sixth on D, D–F–A–[C] in the usual second inversion. This means that D is the second degree and the required reference to the first degree, C, being established by the D:VII or C major chord. &quot;The &quot;need to explain&quot; the chord in measure five establishes that C–E–G is &#x27;equally important&#x27; as the D–(F)–A of measure one.&quot; Leibowitz gives only the bass for chord, E indicating the progression I–II an &quot;unreal&quot; progression in keeping with his &quot;dialectic between the real and the unreal&quot; used in the analysis, while Christ explains the chord as an augmented eleventh with a bass of B, interpreting it as a traditional tertian extended chord.

Not only does an analyst select particular traits, they arrange them according to a plot [intrigue]... Our sense of the component parts of a musical work, like our sense of historical &#x27;facts,&#x27; is mediated by lived experience.&quot; (176)

While John Blacking, among others, holds that &quot;there is ultimately only one explanation and ... this could be discovered by a context-sensitive analysis of the music in culture,&quot; according to Nattiez and others, &quot;there is never &quot;only one valid&quot; musical analysis for any given work.&quot; Blacking gives as example: &quot;everyone disagrees hotly and stakes his [or her] academic reputation on what Mozart really meant in this or that bar of his symphonies, concertos, or quartets. If we knew exactly what went on inside Mozart&#x27;s mind when he wrote them, there could be only one explanation&quot;. (93) However, Nattiez points out that even if we could determine &quot;what Mozart was thinking&quot; we would still be lacking an analysis of the neutral and esthesic levels.

Roger Scruton, in a review of Nattiez&#x27;s &quot;Fondements&quot;, says one may, &quot;describe it as you like so long as you hear it correctly ... certain descriptions suggest wrong ways of hearing it ... what is obvious to hear [in Pélleas et Mélisande] is the contrast in mood and atmosphere between the &#x27;modal&#x27; passage and the bars which follow it.&quot; Nattiez counters that if compositional intent were identical to perception, &quot;historians of musical language could take a permanent nap... Scruton sets himself up as a universal, absolute conscience for the &#x27;right&#x27; perception of the &quot;Pélleas et Mélisande&quot;. But hearing is an active symbolic process (which must be explained): &quot;nothing in perception is self-evident&quot;.&quot;

Thus Nattiez suggests that analyses, especially those intending &quot;a semiological orientation, should ... at least include a comparative critique of already-written analyses, when they exist, so as to explain why the work has taken on this or that &quot;image&quot; constructed by this or that writer: all analysis is a representation; [and] an explanation of the analytical criteria used in the new analysis, so that any critique of this new analysis could be situated in relation to that analysis&#x27;s own &quot;objectives&quot; and &quot;methods&quot;. As Jean-Claude Gardin so rightly remarks, &#x27;no physicist, no biologist is surprised when asked to indicate, in the context of a new theory, the physical data and the mental operations that led to its formulation&#x27;. Making one&#x27;s procedures explicit would help to create a &quot;cumulative progress in knowledge&quot;.&quot; (177)

<text>Liero is a video game for MS-DOS, first released by Finnish programmer Joosa Riekkinen in 1998. The game has been described as a real-time version of &quot;Worms&quot; (a turn-based artillery game). is Finnish for &#x27;earthworm&#x27;. Inspired itself by the earlier game &quot;MoleZ&quot;, &quot;Liero&quot; provided inspiration for the later games &quot;Soldat&quot; and &quot;Noita&quot;.

==Gameplay==
In &quot;Liero&quot;, two worms fight each other to death for score (or frags) using a choice of five weapons from a total of 40 in a two-dimensional map. Most of the terrain, except for indestructible rocks, may be dug or destroyed by explosions. In addition to the weaponry, each player has a ninja rope which can be used to move faster through the map. This grappling hook-like device substitutes for jetpacks and can even latch onto the enemy worm to drag them closer to their foe.

While playing, there are health power-ups to heal the player&#x27;s worm. It is also possible to replace one of the five weapons by picking up bonuses. Before playing, certain weapons can be selected to be available only in bonuses, in the entire game, or completely disabled.

Unlike most side-scrolling deathmatch games, the weapons in &quot;Liero&quot; have infinite ammo. Key factors of weapons include their reload rate and how fast they shoot, whereas in most other games of this type, key factors of weapons include how much ammo they sport and how frequently more ammo for that weapon can be found. &quot;Liero&quot; depends all on timing and swift maneuverability.

The gameplay mode can be deathmatch, Game of Tag or Capture the Flag. It can be played by two human players simultaneously in split screen or in a single player mode against the game&#x27;s artificial intelligence, although the game&#x27;s popularity is derived mostly from the fast-paced player-vs.-player action it provides.

==Development history==

=== Original &quot;Liero&quot; by Joosa Riekkinen ===
Joosa Riekkinen developed &quot;Liero&quot; as DOS game with the first version released in 1998. &quot;Liero&quot; was inspired by the previous freeware game MoleZ, and took many weapons and sounds from its precursor. The original &quot;Liero&quot;″s latest version was 1.33, which was released in 1999. However, the author lost the Pascal source code in a hard disk crash, and due to the lack of backup, no new &quot;classic&quot; versions have been released since.

===Community developments ===
Despite this, and with the author&#x27;s approval, the &quot;Liero&quot; community has distributed several altered (or hacked) versions of the game through the LieroCDC, and others.

=== Merge ===
In 2009, &quot;classic&quot; &quot;Liero&quot; was officially merged with the OpenLiero project upon the release of &quot;Liero&quot; 1.34 (not to be confused with the total conversion by that name). The new versions are released by Gliptic, although Joosa Riekkinen endorses them as official. The original &quot;Liero&quot; data and binary files by Riekkinen were released available under the WTFPL license.

&quot;Liero&quot;″s last release was version 1.36, release September 3, 2013. This version is compatible with almost any OS but lacks network gaming (unlike some of the remakes).

==Clones, remakes and derivatives==

===&quot;Liero Xtreme&quot;===
Liero Xtreme (often called LieroX, Liero Extreme or just LX) is a 2D shooter game. It is an unofficial sequel to &quot;Liero&quot;, and is the most popular of all the &quot;Liero&quot; clones. It features online play, fully customizable weapons, levels and characters. &quot;Liero Xtreme&quot; was created in C++ by Jason &#x27;JasonB&#x27; Boettcher, an Australian programmer. With its source release on April 10, 2006, a new project has become available on October 24, 2006, known as OpenLieroX, while the development of the original &quot;LieroX&quot; project has stopped. At the time of writing (May 6, 2009), &quot;OpenLieroX&quot; has tripled in code size and has many new features.

The game is based on a deathmatch setting, where multiple players face off in a closed level. Each player is equipped with five weapons selected out of all the weapons allowed, and with a &quot;ninja rope&quot; that allows the player to move in any direction. Players begin with a set amount of lives, and whilst the game records the number of kills, the last man standing is usually considered the winner. &quot;Liero Xtreme&quot; also allows team deathmatches, which has made it common for players to form clans. &quot;OpenLieroX&quot; runs on Windows, on MacOSX, on Linux and on FreeBSD.

The first release announcement of &quot;Liero Extreme&quot; was made on October 14, 2002. &quot;LieroX&quot; has become very famous over the time. On February 14, 2006, &quot;Jason Boettcher&quot; stopped the &quot;LieroX&quot; development for good. The last version he released was 0.62b, which had many new features, but suffered from crashes and various errors, and did not catch on within the community which continues to play the 0.56b version. Before leaving the community, he released the source code of the even older version 0.55b under the zlib license. Development of &quot;LieroXtreme&quot; is now in hands of Karel Petranek and Albert Zeyer, used the source code to create &quot;OpenLieroX&quot;, which is compatible with the popular 0.56b version, but has multiple new features and bugfixes. Michał Futer took care of the new frontend. Currently the majority of players play &quot;OpenLieroX&quot;.

As a customizable game, it allows players and developers to script their own mods. Different mods have different sets of unique weapons, and may also differ in player gravity and movement. The default mod is &quot;Liero 1.0&quot;, also called &quot;Classic&quot;, which is roughly equal to the basic setting in original &quot;Liero&quot;. On top of this, several player-created mods are included in the standard game packs, some of which are more popular than the default setting. Similarly to &quot;Liero&quot;, the default level is &quot;Dirt Level&quot;, consisting of diggable terrain with some indestructible rock. The default level is comparatively rarely played compared to more complex player-created levels.

The game interface allow players to modify factors of the game such as which weapons in a mod are allowed, and how fast they reload and many other parameters which have huge impact on the game play.

===&quot;NiL&quot;===

NiL (recursive acronym for &quot;NiL Isn&#x27;t Liero&quot;) is a clone of &quot;Liero&quot;, which runs on Linux and Windows and is released under the terms of the GNU General Public License. &quot;NiL&quot; is not limited to two players, like the original &quot;Liero&quot; is. It doesn&#x27;t limit the number of players over a TCP network. It was met with considerable enthusiasm in the Linux gaming community.

The project was initiated by Flemming Frandsen in winter 1999 after he had stumbled across &quot;Liero&quot;, which he liked so much that he decided to reimplement it under Linux. He abandoned the project five months later, due to being too busy for it. &quot;NiL&quot; was dead until the beginning of 2004 when Christoph Brill, found out about the project and took over as maintainer. Thereafter Daniel Schneidereit joined the project as well, but soon left. Other contributors included Nils Thuerey, Harri Liusvaara, David Hewitt and Phil Howlett.

Development proceeded slowly as the project&#x27;s source code became almost unmaintainable and &quot;NiL&quot; was lacking developers. By mid-2005 Alexander Kahl joined development, convinced Christoph to start over and re-think the whole concept of &quot;NiL&quot;, as the other &quot;Liero&quot; clone &quot;Gusanos&quot; already existed at that time. Development seems to have stopped around mid-2006.

===&quot;OpenLieroX&quot;===

&quot;OpenLieroX&quot; is a remake of classic &quot;Liero&quot;, built from scratch in a new engine. It adds many features to the game, such as modding support, custom sprites, maps, and weapons, and online and lan play. The game also supports more than two players at once.

=== &quot;WebLiero&quot; ===

==Modification==
&quot;Liero&quot; is a versatile game in terms of modification. All of its 40 weapons can be completely replaced with new ones that can be given different images and sound effects from the original set. The images of the worms themselves can be transformed into completely different characters, although their movement animations are less flexible regarding modification. The maps can be given permanent terrain other than rocks alone. Destroyable terrain can also be colored more than simply plain dirt. The AI can be modified to be harder or easier. Nearly the whole game can be converted into something entirely different, except for the main aspect having to do with slaughtering another player/AI.

==Reception and usage==

In 2006 &quot;Liero&quot; received a TopDog award from Home of the Underdogs.
&quot;OpenLieroX&quot; has been positively reviewed by multiple gaming news sites. In 2013 Derek Yu&#x27;s webpage TIGSource reviewed &quot;Liero&quot; v1.36 favorably.

The &quot;Liero&quot; variants &quot;NiL&quot;, &quot;Gusanos&quot;, and &quot;OpenLieroX&quot; were downloaded multiple hundred thousand times from SourceForge alone between 2001 and 2016.

Calling &quot;Liero&quot; a &quot;masterpiece&quot;, &quot;Liero&quot; was selected for a collection of 100 classic Finnish games, which were presented on the opening of the Finnish Museum of Games in Tampere in 2017.

<doc id="209926" wikidata="Q12406482" url="?curid=209926" title="Humorist">
<text>A humorist is an intellectual who uses humor, or wit, in writing or public speaking. A raconteur is one who tells anecdotes in a skillful and amusing way. 

Henri Bergson writes that a humorist&#x27;s work grows from viewing the morals of society.

The term comedian is generally applied to one who is performing to an audience for laughter.

==Distinction from a comedian==
Humor is the quality which makes experiences provoke laughter or amusement, while comedy is a performing art. The nineteenth-century German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer lamented the misuse of &quot;humor&quot; (a German loanword from English) to mean any type of comedy. A humorist is adept at seeing the humor in a situation or aspect of life and relating it, usually through a story; the comedian generally concentrates on jokes designed to invoke instantaneous laughter. The humorist is primarily a writer of books, newspaper or magazine articles or columns, stage or screen plays, and may occasionally appear before an audience to deliver a lecture or narrate a written work. The comedian always performs for an audience, either in live performance, audio recording, radio, television, or film.

Phil Austin, of the comedy group the Firesign Theatre, expressed his thoughts about the difference in 1993 liner notes to the &quot;Fighting Clowns&quot; album:

==Notable humorists==
==Comedians who become humorists==
Sometimes a comedian will adopt a writing career and gain notability as a humorist. Some examples are:

Will Rogers (1879–1935) was a vaudeville comedian who started doing humorous political and social commentary, and became a famous newspaper columnist and radio personality during the Great Depression. He is an exception to the education rule, as he only completed a tenth grade education.

Cal Stewart (1856–1919) was a vaudeville comedian who created the character Uncle Josh Weathersby and toured circuses and medicine shows. He befriended Twain and Rogers, and in 1898 became the first comedian to make sound recordings, on Edison Records.

Garry Moore (1915–1993), known as a television comedian who hosted several variety and game shows, after his 1977 retirement became a regular humor columnist for the newspaper &quot;The Island Packet&quot; of Northeast Harbor, Maine, with a column titled &quot;Mumble, Mumble&quot;. He later released a book of his columns under the same name in the early 1980s.

Victor Borge (1909–2000) was a Danish-American comedian known for bringing humor to classical music. He wrote three books, &quot;My Favorite Intermissions&quot; and &quot;My Favorite Comedies in Music&quot; (both with Robert Sherman), and the autobiography &quot;Smilet er den korteste afstand&quot; (&quot;The Smile is the Shortest Distance&quot;) with Niels-Jørgen Kaiser.

Peter Ustinov (1921–2004) was an English comic actor who wrote several humorous plays and film scripts.

Woody Allen (born 1935), known as a comedian and filmmaker, early in his career worked as a staff writer for humorist Herb Shriner. He also wrote short stories and cartoon captions for magazines such as &quot;The New Yorker&quot;.

Steve Martin (born 1945), comedian and actor, wrote &quot;Cruel Shoes&quot;, a book of humorous essays and short stories, in 1977 (published 1979). He wrote his first humorous play &quot;Picasso at the Lapin Agile&quot; in 1993, and wrote various pieces in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; magazine in the 1990s. He later wrote more humorous plays and two novellas.

Hugh Laurie (born 1959) is an English comic actor who worked for many years in partnership with Stephen Fry. He is a fan of the English humorist P. G. Wodehouse, and has written a Wodehouse-style novel.

==Twain as the iconic American humorist==

Mark Twain (pen name of Samuel Langhorn Clemens, 1835–1910) was widely considered the &quot;greatest humorist&quot; the U.S. ever produced, as noted in his &quot;New York Times&quot; obituary. It&#x27;s a distinction that garnered wide agreement, as William Faulkner called him &quot;the father of American literature&quot;.
The United States national cultural center, the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, has chosen to award a Mark Twain Prize for American Humor annually since 1998 to individuals who have &quot;had an impact on American society in ways similar to the distinguished 19th century novelist and essayist best known as Mark Twain&quot;.

<text>The University of Birmingham (informally Birmingham University) is a public research university in Birmingham, England. It received its royal charter in 1900 as a successor to Queen&#x27;s College, Birmingham (founded in 1825 as the Birmingham School of Medicine and Surgery), and Mason Science College (established in 1875 by Sir Josiah Mason), making it the first English civic or &#x27;red brick&#x27; university to receive its own royal charter, and the first English unitary university. It is a founding member of both the Russell Group of British research universities and the international network of research universities, Universitas 21.

The student population includes undergraduate and postgraduate students (), which is the largest in the UK (out of ). The annual income of the university for 2023–24 was £926 million of which £205.2 million was from research grants and contracts, with an expenditure of £726.5 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;Birmingham Financial Statement 23/24&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2021 Research Excellence Framework, the University of Birmingham ranked equal 13th out of 129 institutions on grade point average, up from equal 31st in the previous REF in 2014.

The university is home to the Barber Institute of Fine Arts, housing works by Van Gogh, Picasso and Monet; the Shakespeare Institute; the Cadbury Research Library, the Mingana Collection of Middle Eastern manuscripts; the Lapworth Museum of Geology; and the 100-metre Joseph Chamberlain Memorial Clock Tower, which is a prominent landmark visible from many parts of the city. Academics and alumni of the university include former British Prime Ministers Neville Chamberlain and Stanley Baldwin, the British composer Sir Edward Elgar and eleven Nobel laureates.

==History==

===Queen&#x27;s College===

The earliest beginnings of the university were originally traced back to the Queen&#x27;s College, which is linked to William Sands Cox in his aim of creating a medical school along strictly Christian lines, unlike the contemporary London medical schools. Further research revealed the roots of the Birmingham Medical School in the medical education seminars of John Tomlinson, the first surgeon to the Birmingham Workhouse Infirmary, and later to the Birmingham General Hospital. These classes, held in the winter of 1767–68, were the first such lectures ever held in England or Wales. The first clinical teaching was undertaken by medical apprentices at the General Hospital, founded in 1779. The medical school which grew out of the Birmingham Workhouse Infirmary was founded in 1828, but Cox began teaching in December 1825. Queen Victoria granted her patronage to the Clinical Hospital in Birmingham and allowed it to be styled &quot;The Queen&#x27;s Hospital&quot;. It was the first provincial teaching hospital in England. In 1843, the medical college became known as Queen&#x27;s College.

=== Mason Science College ===

In 1870, Sir Josiah Mason, the Birmingham industrialist and philanthropist, who made his fortune in making key rings, pens, pen nibs and electroplating, drew up the Foundation Deed for Mason Science College. The college was founded in 1875. It was this institution that would eventually form the nucleus of the University of Birmingham. In 1882, the Departments of Chemistry, Botany and Physiology were transferred to Mason Science College, soon followed by the Departments of Physics and Comparative Anatomy. The transfer of the Medical School to Mason Science College gave considerable impetus to the growing importance of that college and in 1896 a move to incorporate it as a university college was made. As the result of the Mason University College Act 1897 (60 &amp; 61 Vict. c. xx) it became incorporated as Mason University College on 1 January 1898, with Joseph Chamberlain becoming the President of its Court of Governors.

===Royal charter===
It was largely due to Chamberlain&#x27;s enthusiasm that the university was granted a royal charter by Queen Victoria on 24 March 1900. The Calthorpe family offered twenty-five acres (10 hectares) of land on the Bournbrook side of their estate in July. The Court of Governors received the Birmingham University Act 1900 (63 &amp; 64 Vict. c. xix), which put the royal charter into effect on 31 May.

The transfer of Mason University College to the new University of Birmingham, with Chamberlain as its first chancellor and Sir Oliver Lodge as the first principal, was complete. A remnant of Josiah Mason&#x27;s legacy is the Mermaid from his coat-of-arms, which appears in the sinister chief of the university shield and of his college, the double-headed lion in the dexter.

The commerce faculty was founded by Sir William Ashley in 1901, who from 1902 until 1923 served as first Professor of Commerce and Dean of the Faculty. From 1905 to 1908, Edward Elgar held the position of Peyton Professor of Music at the university. He was succeeded by his friend Granville Bantock.

The university&#x27;s own heritage archives are accessible for research through the university&#x27;s Cadbury Research Library which is open to all interested researchers.

During the First World War, the Great Hall in the Aston Webb Building was requisitioned by the War Office to create the 1st Southern General Hospital, a facility for the Royal Army Medical Corps to treat military casualties; it was equipped with 520 beds and treated 125,000 injured servicemen.

In June 1921, the university appointed Linetta de Castelvecchio as Serena Professor of Italian: she was the first woman to hold a chair at the university and one of the first women professors in Great Britain.

===Expansion===
In 1939, the Barber Institute of Fine Arts, designed by Robert Atkinson, was opened. In 1956, the first MSc programme in Geotechnical Engineering commenced under the title of &quot;Foundation Engineering&quot;, and has been run annually at the university since.

Sir Raymond Priestley, vice-chancellor in 1938, helped establish the first undergraduate courses in Physical Education in 1946, developed their sports facilities – starting with the gymnasium in 1939, and made participation in recreational sport compulsory for all new undergraduates from 1940 to 1968. Birmingham became the first UK university to offer a sports degree.

The UK&#x27;s longest-running MSc programme in Physics and Technology of Nuclear Reactors also started at the university in 1956, the same year that the world&#x27;s first commercial nuclear power station was opened at Calder Hall in Cumbria.

In 1957, Sir Hugh Casson and Neville Conder were asked by the university to prepare a masterplan on the site of the original 1900 buildings which were incomplete. The university drafted in other architects to amend the masterplan produced by the group. During the 1960s, the university constructed numerous large buildings, expanding the campus. In 1963, the university helped in the establishment of the faculty of medicine at the University of Rhodesia, now the University of Zimbabwe (UZ). UZ is now independent but both institutions maintain relations through student exchange programmes.

Birmingham also supported the creation of Keele University (formerly University College of North Staffordshire) and the University of Warwick under the Vice-Chancellorship of Sir Robert Aitken who acted as &#x27;godfather&#x27; to the University of Warwick. The initial plan was to establish a satellite university college in Coventry but Aitken advised an independent initiative to the University Grants Committee.

Malcolm X, the Afro-American human rights activist, addressed the University Debating Society in 1965.

===Scientific discoveries and inventions===
The university has been involved in many scientific breakthroughs and inventions. From 1925 until 1948, Sir Norman Haworth was Professor and Director of the Department of Chemistry. He was appointed Dean of the Faculty of Science and acted as Vice-Principal from 1947 until 1948. His research focused predominantly on carbohydrate chemistry in which he confirmed a number of structures of optically active sugars. By 1928, he had deduced and confirmed the structures of maltose, cellobiose, lactose, gentiobiose, melibiose, gentianose, raffinose, as well as the glucoside ring tautomeric structure of aldose sugars. His research helped to define the basic features of the starch, cellulose, glycogen, inulin and xylan molecules. He also contributed towards solving the problems with bacterial polysaccharides. He was a recipient of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1937.

The cavity magnetron was developed in the Department of Physics by Sir John Randall, Harry Boot and James Sayers. This was vital to the Allied victory in World War II. In 1940, the Frisch–Peierls memorandum, a document which demonstrated that the atomic bomb was more than simply theoretically possible, was written in the Physics Department by Sir Rudolf Peierls and Otto Frisch. The university also hosted early work on gaseous diffusion in the Chemistry department when it was located in the Hills building.
Physicist Sir Mark Oliphant made a proposal for the construction of a proton-synchrotron in 1943; however, he made no assertion that the machine would work. In 1945, phase stability was discovered; consequently, the proposal was revived, and construction of a machine that could surpass proton energies of 1 GeV began at the university. However, because of lack of funds, the machine did not start until 1953. The Brookhaven National Laboratory managed to beat them; they started their Cosmotron in 1952, and had it entirely working in 1953, before the University of Birmingham.

In 1947, Sir Peter Medawar was appointed Mason Professor of Zoology at the university. His work involved investigating the phenomenon of tolerance and transplantation immunity. He collaborated with Rupert E. Billingham and they did research on problems of pigmentation and skin grafting in cattle. They used skin grafting to differentiate between monozygotic and dizygotic twins in cattle. Taking the earlier research of R. D. Owen into consideration, they concluded that actively acquired tolerance of homografts could be artificially reproduced. For this research, Medawar was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. He left Birmingham in 1951 and joined the faculty at University College London, where he continued his research on transplantation immunity. He was a recipient of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1960.

===Recent history===

In 1999 talks commenced on the possibility of Aston University integrating itself into the University of Birmingham as the University of Birmingham, Aston Campus. This would have resulted in the University of Birmingham expanding to become one of the largest universities in the UK, with a student body of 30,000. Talks were halted in 2001 after Aston University determined the timing to be inopportune. While Aston University management was in favour of the integration, and reception among staff was generally positive, the Aston student union voted two-to-one against the integration. Despite this set back, the Vice Chancellor of the University of Birmingham said the door remained open to recommence talks when Aston University is ready.

The final round of the first ever televised leaders&#x27; debates, hosted by the BBC, was held at the university during the 2010 British general election campaign on 29 April 2010.

On 9 August 2010 the university announced that for the first time it would not enter the UCAS clearing process for 2010 admission, which matches under-subscribed courses to students who did not meet their firm or insurance choices, due to all places being taken. Largely a result of the Great Recession, Birmingham joined fellow Russell Group universities including Oxford, Cambridge, Edinburgh and Bristol in not offering any clearing places.

The university acted as a training camp for the Jamaican athletics team prior to the 2012 London Olympics.

A new library was opened for the 2016/17 academic year, and a new sports centre opened in May 2017. The previous Main Library and the old Munrow Sports Centre, including the athletics track, have both since been demolished, with the demolition of the old library being completed in November 2017.

Birmingham was selected as the host for the 2022 Commonwealth Games and was the venue for hockey and squash, due to the ability of existing facilities to host the games. The university was the largest athletes village during the games, hosting 3,500 athletes in Tennis Courts and the Vale, and was the official training venue for both swimming and athletics.

===Controversies===
The discipline of cultural studies was founded at the university and between 1964 and 2002 the campus was home to the Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies, a research centre whose members&#x27; work came to be known as the Birmingham School of Cultural Studies. Despite being established by one of the key figures in the field, Richard Hoggart, and being later directed by the theorist Stuart Hall, the department was controversially closed down.

Analysis showed that the university was fourth in a list of British universities that faced the most employment tribunal claims between 2008 and 2011. They were the second most likely to settle these before the hearing date.

In 2011 a parliamentary early day motion was proposed, arguing against the Guild suspending the elected Sabbatical Vice President (Education), who was arrested while taking part in protest activity.

In December 2011 it was announced that the university had obtained a 12-month-long injunction against a group of around 25 students, who occupied a residential building on campus from 23 to 26 November 2011, preventing them from engaging in further &quot;occupational protest action&quot; on the university&#x27;s grounds without prior permission. It was misreported in the press that this injunction applied to all students; however, the court order defines the defendants as: 
Persons unknown (including students of the University of Birmingham) entering or remaining upon the buildings known as No. 2 Lodge Pritchatts Road, Birmingham at the University of Birmingham for the purpose of protest action (without the consent of the University of Birmingham).
 The university and the Guild of Students also clarified the scope of the injunction in an e-mail sent to all students on 11 January 2012, stating: &quot;The injunction applies only to those individuals who occupied the lodge&quot;. The university said that it sought this injunction as a safety precaution based on a previous occupation. Three separate human rights groups, including Amnesty International, condemned the move as restrictive on human rights.

In 2019, several women said the university refused to investigate allegations of campus rape. One student who complained of rape in university accommodation was told by employees of the university that there were no specific procedures for handling rape complaints. In other cases students were told they would have to prove the alleged rapes occurred on university property. The university has been criticized by legal professionals for not adequately assessing the risk to students by refusing to investigate complaints of criminal conduct.

In June 2022 the University published a report into, and apologised for, its involvement in developing, promoting and administering electric-shock conversion therapy to gay men, during the period 1966-1983.

==Campuses==

===Edgbaston campus===

====Original buildings====

The main campus of the university occupies a site some south-west of Birmingham city centre, in Edgbaston. It is arranged around Joseph Chamberlain Memorial Clock Tower (affectionately known as &#x27;Old Joe&#x27; or &#x27;Big Joe&#x27;), a grand campanile which commemorates the university&#x27;s first chancellor, Joseph Chamberlain. Chamberlain may be considered the founder of Birmingham University, and was largely responsible for the university gaining its Royal Charter in 1900 and for the development of the Edgbaston campus. The university&#x27;s Great Hall is located in the domed Aston Webb Building, which is named after one of the architects – the other was Ingress Bell. The initial site was given to the university in 1900 by Lord Calthorpe. The grand buildings were an outcome of the £50,000 given by steel magnate and philanthropist Andrew Carnegie to establish a &quot;first class modern scientific college&quot; on the model of Cornell University in the United States. Funding was also provided by Sir Charles Holcroft.

The original domed buildings, built in Accrington red brick, semicircle to form Chancellor&#x27;s Court. This sits on a drop, so the architects placed their buildings on two tiers with a drop between them. The clock tower stands in the centre of the Court.
The campanile itself draws its inspiration from the Torre del Mangia, a medieval clock tower that forms part of the Town Hall in Siena, Italy. When it was built, it was described as &#x27;the intellectual beacon of the Midlands&#x27; by the &quot;Birmingham Post&quot;. The clock tower was Birmingham&#x27;s tallest building from the date of its construction in 1908 until 1969; it is now the third highest in the city. It is one of the top 50 tallest buildings in the UK, and the tallest free-standing clock tower in the world, although there is some confusion about its actual height, with the university listing it both as and tall in different sources.

The campus has a wide diversity in architectural types and architects. &quot;What makes Birmingham so exceptional among the Red Brick universities is the deployment of so many other major Modernist practices: only Oxford and Cambridge boast greater selections&quot;. The Guild of Students original section was designed by Birmingham inter-war architect Holland Hobbiss who also designed the King Edward&#x27;s School opposite. It was described as &quot;Redbrick Tudorish&quot; by Nikolaus Pevsner.

The statue on horseback fronting the entrance to the university and Barber Institute of Fine Arts is a 1722 statue of George I rescued from Dublin in 1937. This was saved by Bodkin, a director of the National Gallery of Ireland and first director of the Barber Institute. The statue was commissioned by the Dublin Corporation from the Flemish sculptor John van Nost.

Final negotiations for part of what is now the Vale were only completed in March 1947. By then, properties which would have their names used for halls of residences such as Wyddrington and Maple Bank were under discussion and more land was obtained from the Calthorpe estate in 1948 and 1949 providing the setting for the Vale. Landscape architect Mary Mitchell designed the layout of the campus and she included mature trees that were retained from the former gardens. Construction on the Vale started in 1962 with the creation of a artificial lake and the building of Ridge, High, Wyddrington and Lake Halls. The first, Ridge Hall, opened for 139 women in January 1964, with its counterpart High Hall admitting its first male residents the following October.

====1960s and modern expansion====

The university underwent a major expansion in the 1960s due to the production of a masterplan by Casson, Conder and Partners. The first of the major buildings to be constructed to a design by the firm was the Refectory and Staff House which was built in 1961 and 1962. The two buildings are connected by a bridge. The next major buildings to be constructed were the Wyddrington and Lake Halls and the Faculty of Commerce and Social Science, all completed in 1965. The Wyddrington and Lake Halls, on Edgbaston Park Road, were designed by H. T. Cadbury-Brown and contained three floors of student dwellings above a single floor of communal facilities.

The Faculty of Commerce and Social Science, now known as the Ashley Building, was designed by Howell, Killick, Partridge and Amis and is a long, curving two-storey block linked to a five-storey whorl. The two-storey block follows the curve of the road, and has load-bearing brick cross walls. It is faced in specially-made concrete blocks. The spiral is faced with faceted pre-cast concrete cladding panels. It was statutorily listed in 1993 and a refurbishment by Berman Guedes Stretton was completed in 2006.

Chamberlain, Powell and Bon were commissioned to design the Physical Education Centre which was built in 1966. The main characteristic of the building is the roof of the changing rooms and small gymnasium which has hyperbolic paraboloid roof light shells and is completely paved in quarry tiles. The roof of the sports hall consists of eight conoidal 2½-inch thick sprayed concrete shells springing from long pre-stressed valley beams. On the south elevation, the roof is supported on raking pre-cast columns and reversed shells form a cantilevered canopy.

Also completed in 1966 was the Mining and Minerals Engineering and Physical Metallurgy Departments, which was designed by Philip Dowson of Arup Associates. This complex consisted of four similar three-storey blocks linked at the corners. The frame is of pre-cast reinforced concrete with columns in groups of four and the whole is planned as a tartan grid, allowing services to be carried vertically and horizontally so that at no point in a room are services more than ten feet away. The building received the 1966 RIBA Architecture Award for the West Midlands. It was statutorily listed in 1993. Taking the full five years from 1962 to 1967, Birmingham erected twelve buildings which each cost in excess of a quarter of a million pounds.
In 1967, Lucas House, a new hall of residence designed by The John Madin Design Group, was completed, providing 150 study bedrooms. It was constructed in the garden of a large house. The Medical School was extended in 1967 to a design by Leonard J. Multon and Partners. The two-storey building was part of a complex which covers the southside of Metchley Fort, a Roman fort. In 1968, the Institute for Education in the Department for Education was opened. This was another Casson, Conder and Partners-designed building. The complex consisted of a group of buildings centred around an eight-storey block, containing study offices, laboratories and teaching rooms. The building has a reinforced concrete frame which is exposed internally and the external walls are of silver-grey rustic bricks. The roofs of the lecture halls, penthouse and Child Study wing are covered in copper.
Arup Associates returned in the 1960s to design the Arts and Commerce Building, better known as Muirhead Tower and houses the Institute of Local Government Studies. This was completed in 1969. A£42 million refurbishment of the 16-storey tower was completed in 2009 and it now houses the Colleges of Social Sciences and the Cadbury Research Library, the new home for the university&#x27;s Special Collections. The podium was remodeled around the existing Allardyce Nicol studio theatre, providing additional rehearsal spaces and changing and technical facilities. The ground floor lobby now incorporates a Starbucks coffee shop. The name, Muirhead Tower, came from that of the first philosophy professor of the university John Henry Muirhead.

Completed in 2012, the Bramall Music Building is a 450-seat concert hall, which completes the redbrick semicircle of the Aston Webb building, designed by Glenn Howells Architects with venue design by Acoustic Dimensions. This auditorium, with its associated research, teaching and rehearsal facilities, houses the Department of Music. In August 2011 the university announced that architects Lifschutz Davidson Sandilands and S&amp;P were appointed to develop a new Indoor Sports Centre as part of a £175 million investment in the campus.

====Railway station====

In 1978, University station, on the Cross-City Line, was opened to serve the university and its hospital. It is the only university campus in mainland Britain with its own railway station. In 2021, construction began on a redeveloped facility adjacent to the existing structure as part of the West Midlands Rail Programme (WMRP). The rebuilt station was completed and opened to the public in January 2024. Nearby, the Steampipe Bridge, which was constructed in 2011, transports steam across the Cross-City Railway Line and Worcester &amp; Birmingham Canal from the energy generation plant to the medical school as part of the university&#x27;s sustainable energy strategy. Its laser-cut exterior is also a public art feature.

====Other features====
Located within the Edgbaston site of the university is the Winterbourne Botanic Garden, a 24,000 square metre (258,000 square foot) Edwardian Arts and Crafts style garden. The large statue in the foreground was a gift to the university by its sculptor Sir Edward Paolozzi – the sculpture is named &#x27;Faraday&#x27;, and has an excerpt from the poem &#x27;The Dry Salvages&#x27; by T. S. Eliot around its base.

The University of Birmingham operates the Lapworth Museum of Geology in the Aston Webb Building in Edgbaston. It is named after Charles Lapworth, a geologist who worked at Mason Science College.

Since November 2007, the university has been holding a farmers&#x27; market on the campus. Birmingham is the first university in the country to have an accredited farmers&#x27; market.

The considerable extent of the estate meant that by the end of the 1990s it was valued at £536 million.

University of Birmingham marked its grand ending of Green Heart Project at the start of 2019.

In 2021, the University opened a central-city meeting and conference site called &quot;The Exchange&quot; in the former Birmingham Municipal Bank in Centenary Square.

===Selly Oak campus===
The university&#x27;s Selly Oak campus is a short distance to the south of the main campus. It was the home of a federation of nine colleges, known as Selly Oak Colleges, mainly focused on theology, social work, and teacher training. The Federation was for many years associated with the University of Birmingham. A new library, the Orchard Learning Resource Centre, was opened in 2001, shortly before the Federation ceased to exist. The OLRC is now one of Birmingham University&#x27;s site libraries. Among the Selly Oak Colleges was Westhill College, (later the University of Birmingham, Westhill), which merged with the university&#x27;s School of Education in 2001. In the following years most of the remaining colleges closed, leaving two colleges which continue today, Woodbrooke College, a study and conference centre for the Society of Friends, and Fircroft College, a small adult education college with residential provision. Woodbrooke College&#x27;s Centre for Postgraduate Quaker Studies, established in 1998, works with the University of Birmingham to deliver research supervision for the degrees of MA by research and PhD.

The Selly Oak campus is now home to the Department of Drama and Theatre Arts in the newly refurbished Selly Oak Colleges Old Library and George Cadbury Hall 200-seat theatre. The UK daytime television show &quot;Doctors&quot; is filmed on this campus. The University of Birmingham School occupies a brand new, purpose-built building located on the university&#x27;s Selly Oak campus. The University of Birmingham School is sponsored by the University of Birmingham and managed by an Academy Trust. The University of Birmingham School opened in September 2015.

===Mason College and Queen&#x27;s College campus===
The Victorian neo-gothic Mason College Building in Birmingham city centre housed Birmingham University&#x27;s Faculties of Arts and Law for over 50 years after the founding of the university in 1900. The Faculty of Arts building on the Edgbaston campus was not constructed until 1959–61. The Faculties of Arts and Law then moved to the Edgbaston campus. The original Mason College Building was demolished in 1962 as part of the redevelopment within the inner ring road.

The 1843 Gothic Revival building constructed opposite the Town Hall between Paradise Street (the main entrance) and Swallow Street served as Queen&#x27;s College, one of the founder colleges of the university. In 1904 the building was given a new buff-coloured terracotta and brick front. The medical and scientific departments merged with Mason College in 1900 to form the University of Birmingham and sought new premises in Edgbaston. The theological department of Queen&#x27;s College did not merge with Mason College, but later moved in 1923 to Somerset Road in Edgbaston, next to the University of Birmingham as the Queen&#x27;s Foundation, maintaining a relationship with the University of Birmingham until a 2010 review. In the mid 1970s, the original Queen&#x27;s College building was demolished, with the exception of the grade II listed façade.

===Dubai Campus===
The university also has an affiliated Dubai campus established in 2017 at Dubai International Academic City (DIAC). They have since moved from the DIAC headquarters with the construction of a new campus in 2022 in the same area, inaugurated by the Dubai crown prince Hamdan Bin Mohammed Al Maktoum. The campus boasts of having all faculty flown in or permanently staffed from the UK campus.

==Organisation and administration==

===Academic departments===

Birmingham has departments covering a wide range of subjects. On 1 August 2008, the university&#x27;s system was restructured into five &#x27;colleges&#x27;, which are composed of numerous &#x27;schools&#x27;:

*Arts and Law (English, Drama and Creative Studies; History and Cultures; Languages, Cultures, Art History and Music; Liberal Arts, Birmingham Law School; Philosophy, Theology and Religion)
*Engineering and Physical Sciences (Chemistry; Chemical Engineering; Computer Science; Engineering (comprising the Departments of civil, Mechanical and Electrical, Electronic &amp; Systems Engineering); Mathematics; Metallurgy and Materials; Physics and Astronomy)
*Life and Environmental Sciences (Biosciences; Geography, Earth and Environmental Sciences; Psychology; Sport and Exercise Sciences)
*Medical and Dental Sciences (Institute of Cancer and Genomic Sciences; Institute of Clinical Sciences; Institute of Inflammation and Ageing; Institute of Applied Health Research; Institute of Cardiovascular Science; Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy; Institute of Metabolism and Systems Research; Institute of Microbiology and Infection).
*Social Sciences (Birmingham Business School; Education; Government and Society; Social Policy)

The university is home to a number of research centres and schools, including the Birmingham Business School, the oldest business school in England, the University of Birmingham Medical School, the International Development Department, the Institute of Local Government Studies, the Centre of West African Studies, the Centre for Russian and East European Studies, the Centre of Excellence for Research in Computational Intelligence and Applications and the Shakespeare Institute. The Third Sector Research Centre was established in 2008, and the Institute for Research into Superdiversity was established in 2013. Apart from traditional research and PhDs, under the department of Engineering and Physical Sciences, the university offers split-site PhD in Computer Science. The university is also home to the Birmingham Solar Oscillations Network (BiSON) which consists of a network of six remote solar observatories monitoring low-degree solar oscillation modes. It is operated by the High Resolution Optical Spectroscopy group of the School of Physics and Astronomy, funded by the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC).

====International Development Department====
The International Development Department (IDD) is a multi-disciplinary academic department focused on poverty reduction through developing effective governance systems. The department is one of the leading UK centres for the postgraduate study of international development. The department has been described as being a &quot;highly regarded, long-established specialist unit&quot; with a &quot;global reputation&quot; by &quot;The Independent&quot;.

===Off-campus establishments===

A number of the university&#x27;s centres, schools and institutes are located away from its two campuses in Edgbaston and Selly Oak:

* The Shakespeare Institute, in Stratford-upon-Avon, which is a centre for postgraduate study dedicated to the study of William Shakespeare and the literature of the English Renaissance.

====University of Birmingham Observatory====

In the early 1980s, the University of Birmingham constructed an observatory next to the university playing fields, approximately south of the Edgbaston campus. The site was chosen because the night sky was ~100 times darker than the skies above campus. First light was on 8 December 1982, and the Observatory was officially opened by the Astronomer Royal, Francis Graham-Smith, on 13 June 1984. The observatory was upgraded in 2013.

The Observatory is used primarily for undergraduate teaching. It has two main instruments, a 16&quot; Cassegrain (working at f/19) and a 14&quot; Meade LX200R (working at f/6.35). A third telescope is also present and is used exclusively for visual observations.

Members of the public are given chance to visit the Observatory at regular &quot;Astronomy in the City&quot; events during the winter months. These events include a talk on the night sky from a member of the university&#x27;s student Astronomical Society; a talk on current astrophysics research, such as exoplanets, galaxy clusters or gravitational-wave astronomy, a question-and-answer session, and the chance to observing using telescopes both on campus and at the Observatory.

===Finances===

In the financial year ending 31 July 2024, Birmingham had a total income of £926 million (2022/23 – £909.1 million) and total expenditure of £726.5 million (2022/23 – £884.7 million). Key sources of income included £456.3 million from tuition fees and education contracts (2022/23 – £445.1 million), £109.5 million from funding body grants (2022/23 – £112.9 million), £205.2 million from research grants and contracts (2022/23 – £196.7 million), £13.4 million from investment income (2022/23 – £9.8 million) and £9.3 million from donations and endowments (2022/23 – £9.6 million).

At year end, Birmingham had endowments of £155.8 million (2022/23 – £142.5 million) and total net assets of £1.310 billion (2022/23 – £1.106 billion). It holds the eleventh-largest endowment of any university in the UK.

===Branding===
The original coat of arms was designed in 1900. It features a double headed lion (on the left) and a mermaid holding a mirror and comb (to the right). These symbols owe to the coat of arms of the institution&#x27;s predecessor, Mason College.

In 2005 the university began rebranding itself. A simplified edition of the shield which had been introduced in the 1980s reverted to a detailed version based on how it appears on the university&#x27;s original Royal Charter.

===Libraries and collections===
Library Services operates six libraries. They are the Barber Fine Art Library, Barnes Library, Main Library, Orchard Learning Resource Centre, Dental Library, and the Shakespeare Institute Library. Library Services also operates the Cadbury Research Library.

The Shakespeare Institute&#x27;s library is a major United Kingdom resource for the study of English Renaissance literature.

The Cadbury Research Library is home to the University of Birmingham&#x27;s historic collections of rare books, manuscripts, archives, photographs and associated artefacts. The collections, which have been built up over a period of 120 years consist of over 200,000 rare printed books including significant incunabula, as well as over 4 million unique archive and manuscript collections. The Cadbury Research Library is responsible for directly supporting the university&#x27;s research, learning and teaching agenda, along with supporting the national and international research community.

The Cadbury Research Library contains the Chamberlain collection of papers from Neville Chamberlain, Joseph Chamberlain and Austen Chamberlain, the Avon Papers belonging to Anthony Eden with material on the Suez Crisis, the Cadbury Papers relating to the Cadbury firm from 1900 to 1960, the Mingana Collection of Middle Eastern Manuscripts of Alphonse Mingana, the Noël Coward Collection, the papers of Edward Elgar, Oswald Mosley, and David Lodge, and the records of the English YMCA and of the Church Missionary Society. The Cadbury Research Library has recently taken in the complete archive of UK Save the Children. The Library holds important first editions such as De Humani Corporis (1543) by Versalius, the Complete Works (1616) of Ben Jonson, two copies of The Temple of Flora (1799-1807) by Robert Thornton and comprehensive collections of the works of Joseph Priestley and D H Lawrence as well as many other significant works.

In 2015, a Quranic manuscript in the Mingana Collection was identified as one of the oldest to have survived, having been written between 568 and 645.

At the beginning of the 2016/17 academic year, a new main library opened on the Edgbaston campus and the old library has now been demolished as part of the plans to create a &#x27;Green Heart&#x27; as per the original plans for the university whereby the clock tower would be visible from the North Gate. The Harding Law Library was closed and renovated to become the university&#x27;s Translation and Interpreting Suite.

===Birmingham Fellows===
The Birmingham Fellowship scheme was launched in 2011. The scheme encourages high potential early career researchers to establish themselves as rounded academics and continue pursuing their research interests. This scheme was the first of its kind, and has since been emulated in several other Russell Group universities across the UK. Since 2014, the scheme has been divided into Birmingham Research Fellowships and Birmingham Teaching Fellowships. 
Birmingham Fellows are appointed to permanent academic posts (with two or three year probation periods), with five years protected time to develop their research.

Birmingham Fellows are usually recruited at a lecturer or senior lecturer level. In the first period of the fellowship, emphasis is placed on the research aspect, publishing high quality academic outputs, developing a trajectory for their work and gaining external funding. However, development of teaching skills is encouraged. Teaching and supervisory responsibilities, as well as administrative duties, then steadily increase to a normal lecturer&#x27;s load in the Fellow&#x27;s respective discipline by the fifth year of the fellowship. Birmingham Fellows are not expected to carry out academic administration during their term as Fellows, but will do once their posts turn into lectureships (&#x27;three-legged contract&#x27;). When accepted into the Birmingham Research Fellowship, Fellows receive a start-up package to develop or continue their research projects, an academic mentor and support for both research and teaching. All fellows are said to become part of the Birmingham Fellows Cohort, which provides them a university-wide network and an additional source of support and mentoring.

===International cooperation===
In Germany the University of Birmingham cooperates with the Goethe University Frankfurt. Both cities are linked by a long-lasting partnership agreement.

==Student life==

===Guild of Students===
The University of Birmingham Guild of Students is the university&#x27;s student union. Originally the Guild of Undergraduates, the institution had its first foundations in the Mason Science College in the centre of Birmingham around 1876. The University of Birmingham itself formally received its Royal Charter in 1900 with the Guild of Students being provided for as a Student Representative Council. It is not known for certain why the name &#x27;Guild of Students&#x27; was chosen as opposed to &#x27;Union of Students&#x27;; however, the Guild shares its name with Liverpool Guild of Students, another &#x27;redbrick university&#x27;; both organisations subsequently founded the National Union of Students. The Union Building, the Guild&#x27;s bricks and mortar presence, was designed by the architect Holland W. Hobbiss.

The Guild&#x27;s official purposes are to represent its members and provide a means of socialising, though societies and general amenities. The university provides the Guild with the Union Building effectively rent free as well as a block grant to support student services. The Guild also runs several bars, eateries, social spaces and social events.

The Guild supports a variety of student societies and volunteering projects, roughly around 220 at any one time. The Guild complements these societies and volunteering projects with professional staffed services, including its walk-in Advice and Representation Centre (ARC), Student Activities, Jobs/Skills/Volunteering, Student Mentors in halls, and Community Wardens around Bournbrook. The Guild of Students was where the student volunteering charity InterVol was conceived and developed as a student-led volunteering project in the early 2000s; the project links students will local volunteering opportunities as well as placements with charitable partners overseas. Another two of the Guild&#x27;s long-standing societies are Student Advice and Nightline (previously Niteline), which both provide peer-to-peer welfare support. The Guild was one of the first universities in the United Kingdom to publish a campus newspaper, &quot;Redbrick&quot;, supported financially by the Guild of Students and advertising revenue.

The Guild undertakes its representative function through its officer group, seven of whom are full-time, on sabbatical from their studies, and ten of whom are part-time and hold their positions whilst still studying. Elections are held yearly, conventionally February, for the following academic year. These officers have regular contact with the university&#x27;s officer-holders and managers. In theory, the Guild&#x27;s officers are directed and kept to account over their year in office by Guild Council, an 80-seat decision-making body. The Guild also supports the university &quot;student reps&quot; scheme, which aims to provide an effective channel of feedback from students on more of a departmental level.

===Sport===

University of Birmingham Sport provides a range of sport clubs, including rowing, basketball, cricket, football, rugby union, netball, field hockey, ice hockey, American football, and triathlon. In May 2017, the university opened the Sport and Fitness Centre providing facilities including a gym, squash courts, 50m swimming pool, and climbing wall. The university has two international standard hockey pitches, 3G pitches which can be used for 5-a-side and 11-a-side football, netball and tennis courts, and a 400m athletics track at Edgbaston Park Road. The university opened the Raymond Priestley Centre in 1981 on the shores of Coniston Water in the Lake District, offering outdoor activities and learning in the area. University of Birmingham Sport also offers around 30 scholarships and bursaries to national and international students of exceptional athletic ability.

As of the 2019 league, the university is ranked seventh in the British Universities and Colleges Sport league table.

In 2004, six graduates and one student competed in the 2004 Athens Summer Olympics, and four alumni competed at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, including cyclist Paul Manning who won an Olympic Gold. In the 2018 Commonwealth Games, six students and eighteen alumni attended representing England, Scotland, Wales, and Guernsey, and competing in sports including hockey, 1500m, badminton, and cycling.

===Housing===
The university provides housing for most first-year students, running a guarantee scheme for all those UK applicants who choose Birmingham as their firm UCAS choice. 90 per cent of university-provided housing is inhabited by first-year students.

The university maintained gender-segregated halls until the beginning of the 1998-99 academic year when Lake and Wyddrington &quot;halls&quot; (treated as two different halls, despite being physically one building) were renamed as Shackleton Hall. Chamberlain Hall (Eden Tower), a seventeen-storey tower block, was originally known as High Hall, for male students, and the connected Ridge Hall (later renamed to the Hampton Wing), for female students. University House was decommissioned as accommodation to house the expanding Business School, while Mason Hall has been demolished and rebuilt, opening in 2008. In the summer of 2006, the university sold three of its most distant halls (Hunter Court, the Beeches and Queens Hospital Close) to private operators, while later in the year and during term, the university was forced urgently to decommission both the old Chamberlain Tower (High Hall) and also Manor House over fire safety inspection failures. The university has rebranded its halls offerings into three villages.

====Vale Village====
The Vale Village includes Chamberlain Hall, Shackleton, Maple Bank, Tennis Court, Elgar Court and Aitken residences. A sixth hall of residence, Mason Hall, re-opened in September 2008 following a complete rebuild. Approximately 2,700 students live in the village.

Shackleton Hall (originally Lake Hall, for male students, and Wyddrington Hall, for female students) underwent an £11 million refurbishment and was re-opened in Autumn 2004. There are 72 flats housing a total of 350 students. The majority of the units consist of six to eight bedrooms, together with a small number of one, two, three or five bedroom studio/apartments. The redevelopment was designed by Birmingham-based architect Patrick Nicholls while employed at Aedas, now a director of Glancy Nicholls Architects.

Maple Bank was refurbished and opened in summer 2005. It consists of 87 five bedroom flats, housing 435 undergraduates.

The Elgar Court residence consists of 40 six bedroom flats, housing a total of 236 students. It opened in September 2003.

Tennis Court consists of 138 three, four, five and six bedroom flats and houses 697 students.

The Aitken wing is a small complex consisting of 23 six and eight bedroom flats. It houses 147 students.

Construction of the new Mason Hall commenced in June 2006 following complete demolition of the original 1960s structures. It was designed by Aedas Architects. The entire project is thought to have cost £36.75 million. It has since been completed, with the first year of students moving in September 2008.

The new Chamberlain Tower and neighbouring low rise blocks opened in September 2015. Chamberlain is home to more than 700 first year students. It replaced the old 1964-built 18-storey (above ground level) High Hall (later renamed Eden Tower), for male students and low rise Ridge Hall (later renamed Hampton Wing) for female students, which closed in 2006. The 50-year-old Eden Tower was removed at the start of 2014. Previously known as High Hall, the tower and its associated low rise blocks were demolished after studies revealed it would be uneconomical to refurbish them and would not provide the quality of accommodation which the University of Birmingham desires for students.

The largest student-run event, the Vale Festival or &#x27;ValeFest&#x27;, is held annually on the Vale. The Festival celebrated its 10th event in 2014, raising £25,000 for charity. The 2019 event was headlined by The Hunna and Saint Raymond.

====Pritchatts Park Village====
The Pritchatts Park Village houses over 700 undergraduate and postgraduate students. Halls include &#x27;Ashcroft&#x27;, &#x27;The Spinney&#x27; and &#x27;Oakley Court&#x27;, as well as &#x27;Pritchatts House&#x27; and the &#x27;Pritchatts Road Houses&#x27;.

The Spinney is a small complex of six houses and twelve smaller flats, housing 104 students in total. 
Ashcroft consists of four purpose built blocks of flats and houses 198 students. The four-storey Pritchatts House consists of 24 duplex units and houses 159 students. Oakley Court consists of 21 individual purpose-built flats, ranging in size from five to thirteen bedrooms. Also included are 36 duplex units. A total of 213 students are housed in Oakley Court, made up of undergraduates. Oakley Court was completed in 1993 at a cost of £2.9 million. It was designed by Birmingham-based Associated Architects. 
Pritchatts Road is a group of four private houses that were converted into student residences. There is a maximum of 16 bedrooms per house.

====Selly Oak Village====

Selly Oak Village consists of three residences in the Selly Oak and Bournbrook areas: Jarratt Hall, which is owned by the university, Douper Hall, and The Metalworks. As of 2008, the village had 637 bed spaces for students.

Jarratt Hall is a large complex designed around a central courtyard and three landscaped areas. It housed 587 undergraduate students as of 2012. Jarratt Hall did not accommodate postgraduate students until September 2013, due to ongoing refurbishment of kitchens and the heating system.

====The Manor House, Northfield====
The University of Birmingham also own the Northfield Manor House, having acquired the property from the Cadbury family in 1953. The property was used as The Manor House student accommodation until 2007, when the halls were found to be in need of restoration and refurbishment. In 2014, however, arsonists set a fire that gutted much of the property. The University of Birmingham has rebuilt and restored the property since then, and has converted much of the site into flats.

====Student Housing Co-operative accommodation====
Birmingham Student Housing Co-operative was opened in 2014 by students of the university to provide affordable self managed housing for its members. The co-operative manages a property on Pershore Road in Selly Oak.

<doc id="209936" wikidata="Q18939550" url="?curid=209936" title="List of fictional diaries">
<text>This is a list of fictional diaries categorized by type, including fictional works in diary form, diaries appearing in fictional works, and hoax diaries.

The first category, fictional works in diary form, lists fictional works where the story, or a major part of the story, is told in the form of a character&#x27;s diary. Diary form is frequently used in fiction for young adults and tweens as well as adults. It has been used for multiple books in a series following the diarist&#x27;s life over many years, such as the &quot;Adrian Mole&quot; series, the &quot;Diary of a Wimpy Kid&quot; series, and the &quot;Dork Diaries&quot; series, all of which chronicle the lives of characters who start a diary as children or adolescents and continue their diary as they mature over time. Fictionalised diaries set during distinct historical periods or events have been used since at least the 1970s to bring history to life for young people. &quot;Dear America&quot;, &quot;My Australian Story&quot; and related series are recent examples of this genre. The form is also frequently used for fiction about adult women&#x27;s lives, some notable examples being &quot;Bridget Jones&#x27;s Diary&quot;, &quot;The Color Purple&quot;, and &quot;Pamela&quot;.

The second category lists fictional works that are not written in diary form, but in which a character keeps a diary, or a diary is otherwise featured as part of the story. Some common uses for diaries in fiction are to reveal to the reader material that is concealed from other characters, to divulge information about past events, or as a device to provide real or false evidence to investigators in mystery or crime fiction. Examples of diaries being used in one of these ways include Amy Dunne&#x27;s false diary in &quot;Gone Girl&quot; and Laura Palmer&#x27;s secret diary in &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;.

The third category lists hoax diaries, that were presented as being true diaries of real people when first published, but were later discovered to be fiction. &quot;Go Ask Alice&quot;, the first of a number of books by Beatrice Sparks purported to be based on diaries of real teenagers, was originally presented by Sparks as the non-fictional diary of an anonymous teenage girl, but was later classified by publishers as fiction.

<text>Anthony Dymoke Powell ( ; 21 December 1905 – 28 March 2000) was an English novelist best known for his 12-volume work &quot;A Dance to the Music of Time&quot;, published between 1951 and 1975. It is on the list of longest novels in English.

Powell&#x27;s major work has remained in print continuously and has been the subject of television and radio dramatisations. In 2008, &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper named Powell among their list of &quot;the 50 greatest British writers since 1945.&quot;

==Life==

Powell was born in Westminster, the son of Lieutenant-Colonel Philip Lionel William Powell (1882–1959), of the Welch Regiment, and Maud Mary (died 1954), daughter of Edmund Lionel Wells-Dymoke, of The Grange, East Molesey, Surrey. Wells-Dymoke was a descendant of a land-owning family in Lincolnshire, hereditary Champions to monarchs since the reign of Richard II of England. They had married into the family of the Barons Marmion, who first held the position. The Powell family descended from ancient Welsh kings and chieftains. Anthony Powell had a strong interest in genealogy; he conducted extensive research into the Powell family over many years, establishing a paternal descent from Gwriad ap Elidyr — himself a descendant of Coel Hen according to the Genealogies from Jesus College MS 20 and other sources — via Rhys ap Gruffydd to the satisfaction of the heralds of the College of Arms, who in 1964 granted him use of the ancient Powell arms. This pedigree was included in &quot;Burke&#x27;s Landed Gentry&quot;.

Because of his father&#x27;s career and the First World War, the family moved several times, and mother and son sometimes lived apart from Powell&#x27;s father. Powell attended Gibbs&#x27;s pre-preparatory day-school for a brief time. He was then sent to New Beacon School near Sevenoaks, which was popular with military families. Early in 1919, Powell passed the Common Entrance Examination for Eton, where he started that autumn. There, he befriended fellow pupil Henry Yorke, later to become known as novelist Henry Green. At Eton, Powell spent much of his spare time at the Studio, where a sympathetic art master encouraged him to develop his talent as a draughtsman and his interest in the visual arts. In 1922, he became a founding member of the Eton Society of Arts. The society&#x27;s members produced an occasional magazine called &quot;The Eton Candle&quot;.

In the autumn of 1923, Powell went up to Balliol College, Oxford. Soon after his arrival, he was introduced to the Hypocrites&#x27; Club. Outside that club, he came to know Maurice Bowra, then a young don at Wadham College. During his third year, Powell lived out of college, sharing rooms with Henry Yorke. Powell travelled on the Continent during his holidays. He was awarded a third-class degree at the end of his academic years.

Upon his arrival in London after Oxford, part of Powell&#x27;s social life centered around attendance at formal debutante dances at houses in Mayfair and Belgravia. He renewed acquaintance with Evelyn Waugh, whom he had known at Oxford, and was a frequent guest for Sunday supper at Waugh&#x27;s parents&#x27; house. Waugh introduced him to the Gargoyle Club, which gave him experience in London&#x27;s Bohemia. He got to know painters Nina Hamnett and Adrian Daintrey, who were neighbours in Fitzrovia, and composer Constant Lambert, who remained a good friend until Lambert&#x27;s death in 1951.

In 1934, he married Lady Violet Pakenham. In 1952, they moved to The Chantry, a country home in Whatley, west of Frome, Somerset.

Powell was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1956 Birthday Honours, and in 1973, he declined an offer of knighthood. He was appointed Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour (CH) in the 1988 New Year Honours. He served as a trustee of the National Portrait Gallery from 1962 to 1976. With Lady Violet, he travelled to the United States, India, Guatemala, Italy, and Greece.

The individuals to whom Powell dedicated his books and memoirs provide the context of his range of friends and literary connections including John Bayley, Robert Conquest, Henry d&#x27;Avigdor-Goldsmid, Antonia Fraser, Roy Jenkins, Hugh Massingberd, Arthur Mizener, and Edith Sitwell.

Powell&#x27;s health declined in his later years after multiple strokes. On 28 March 2000, he died at The Chantry at the age of 94.

==Work==

Powell came to work in London during the autumn of 1926 and lived at various London addresses for the next 25 years. He worked in a form of apprenticeship at the publishers Gerald Duckworth and Company in Covent Garden, where he brought out &quot;A Tower of Skulls: a Journey through Persia and Turkish Armenia&quot; by Gerald Reitlinger.

Powell left Duckworth employ in 1936 after protracted negotiations about title, salary, and working hours. He next took a job as a screenwriter at the Warner Bros. studio in Teddington, where he remained for six months. He made an abortive attempt to find employment in Hollywood as a screenwriter in 1937. He next found work reviewing novels for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; and memoirs and autobiographies for &quot;The Spectator&quot;.

Upon the outbreak of the Second World War, Powell, at age 34, joined the British Army as a second lieutenant, making him more than 10 years older than most of his fellow subalterns, not at all well prepared for military life, and lacking in experience. Powell joined the Welch Regiment and was stationed in Northern Ireland at the time of air raids in Belfast. His superiors found uses for his talents, resulting in a series of transfers that brought him to special training courses designed to produce a nucleus of officers to deal with the problems of military government after the Allies had defeated the Axis powers. He eventually secured an assignment with the Intelligence Corps and additional training. His military career continued with a posting to the War Office in Whitehall, where he was attached to the section known as Military Intelligence (Liaison) overseeing relations with, and the basic material needs of, foreign troops in exile, specifically the Czechs, later with the Belgians and Luxembourgers, and later still the French. Later for a short time he was posted to the Cabinet Office, to serve on the Secretariat of the Joint Intelligence Committee, securing promotions along the way. 

For his service in the Army, he received two General Service medals as well as the 1944 France and Germany Star for escorting a group of Allied military attaches from Normandy to Montgomery&#x27;s 21st Army Group Tactical HQ in November 1944 three miles from Roermond, Holland then held by the Germans. For representing the interests of foreign armies in exile as a liaison officer he received the following decorations: the Order of the White Lion (Czechoslovakia), Oaken Crown (Luxembourg), Order of Leopold II (Belgium), and Luxembourg War Cross (Croix de Guerre
-Luxembourg).

After his demobilisation at the end of the war, writing became his sole career.

Despite a holiday trip to the Soviet Union in 1936, he remained unsympathetic to the popular-front, leftist politics of many of his literary and critical contemporaries. A confirmed Tory, Powell nonetheless maintained a certain skepticism towards the right as well, often associating with George Orwell and Malcolm Muggeridge. He was wary of right-wing groups and suspicious of inflated rhetoric. He organized George Orwell&#x27;s funeral along with Muggeridge.

==Family==
Powell married Lady Violet Pakenham (1912–2002), sister of Lord Longford, on 1 December 1934 at All Saints, Ennismore Gardens, Knightsbridge. Powell and his wife relocated to 1 Chester Gate in Regent&#x27;s Park, London, where they remained for 17 years. Their first son, Tristram, was born in April 1940, but Powell and his wife spent most of the war years apart, while he served in the Welch Regiment and later in the Intelligence Corps. A second son, John, was born in January 1946.

On 30 April 2018, Powell&#x27;s granddaughter Georgia Powell married Henry Somerset, 12th Duke of Beaufort.

==Writing==

Powell&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Afternoon Men&quot;, was published by Duckworth in 1931, with Powell supervising its production himself. The same firm published his next three novels, &quot;Venusberg&quot; (1932), &quot;From a View to a Death&quot; (1933) and &quot;Agents and Patients&quot; (1936) two of them after Powell had left the firm. The cover design of these three were by Misha Black.

During his time in California, Powell contributed several articles to the magazine &quot;Night and Day&quot;, edited by Graham Greene. Powell wrote a few more occasional pieces for the magazine until it ceased publication in March 1938. Powell completed his fifth novel, &quot;What&#x27;s Become of Waring&quot;, in late 1938 or early 1939. After being turned down by Duckworth, it was published by Cassell in March of that year. The book sold fewer than a thousand copies.

Anticipating the difficulties of creative writing during wartime, Powell began to assemble material for a biography of 17th-century writer John Aubrey. His army career, though, forced him to postpone even that biographical work. When the war ended, Powell resumed work on Aubrey, completing the manuscript of &quot;John Aubrey and His Friends&quot; in May 1946, though it only appeared in 1948 after difficult negotiations and arguments with publishers. He then edited a selection of Aubrey&#x27;s writings that appeared the following year.

Powell returned to novel writing, and began to ponder a long novel sequence. Over the next 30 years, he produced his major work: &quot;A Dance to the Music of Time&quot;. The title of the multivolume series is taken from the painting of the same name by Poussin, which hangs in the Wallace Collection. The cycle of novels, narrated by a protagonist with experiences and perspectives similar to Powell&#x27;s own, follows the trajectory of the author&#x27;s own life, offering a vivid portrayal of the intersection of bohemian life with high society between 1921 and 1971. Its characters, many modelled loosely on real people, surface, vanish, and reappear throughout the sequence but Powell claimed that it was not a &quot;roman à clef&quot;. The characters are drawn from the upper classes, their marriages and affairs, and their bohemian acquaintances. Powell was awarded the 1957 James Tait Black Memorial Prize for the fourth volume, &quot;At Lady Molly&#x27;s&quot;. The eleventh volume, &quot;Temporary Kings&quot;, received the W. H. Smith Prize in 1974. 

In parallel with his creative writing, Powell served as the primary fiction reviewer for the &quot;Times Literary Supplement&quot;. He served as literary editor of &quot;Punch&quot; from 1953 to 1959. From 1958 to 1990, he was a regular reviewer for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, resigning after a vitriolic personal attack on him by Auberon Waugh appeared in that newspaper. He also reviewed occasionally for &quot;The Spectator&quot;. Many of Powell&#x27;s book reviews were republished in two volumes of critical essays, &quot;Miscellaneous Verdicts&quot; (1990) and &quot;Under Review&quot; (1992).

Between 1976 and 1982, Powell published four volumes of memoirs with the overall title of &quot;To Keep the Ball Rolling,&quot; followed by two more novels: &quot;O, How the Wheel Becomes It!&quot; (1983) and &quot;The Fisher King &quot;(1986).

Several volumes of Powell&#x27;s &quot;Journals&quot;, covering 1982 to 1992, appeared between 1995 and 1997. His &quot;Writer&#x27;s Notebook&quot; was published posthumously in 2001, and a third volume of critical essays, &quot;Some Poets, Artists, and a Reference for Mellors&quot;, appeared in 2005. 

Alan Furst, an author of spy novels, has noted of him, &quot;Powell does everything a novelist can do, from flights of aesthetic passion to romance to comedy high and low. His dialogue is extraordinary; often terse, pedestrian and perfect, each character using three or four words. Anthony Powell taught me to write; he has such brilliant control of the mechanics of the novel.&quot;

==Collage==

Powell created collages during his writing life. His greatest achievement, the collage in the Chantry, has been characterized as &quot;a monstrous collage of a size and surrealistic disturbance.&quot;

The collage took decades to create. It has been digitized and partially reproduced in &quot;Anthony Powell: Dancing to the Music of Time&quot; as endpapers. A 360-degree panorama is viewable at the website: Powell&#x27;s &quot;Boiler Room&quot; Collage at The Chantry.

In 2019, the Collage was photographed by Tim Beddow and featured on the cover of &quot;The World of Interiors&quot;, a Condé Nast magazine.

==Recognition==

&quot;Dance&quot; was adapted by Hugh Whitemore for a television miniseries during the autumn of 1997, and broadcast in the UK on Channel 4. The novel sequence was earlier adapted by Graham Gauld and Frederick Bradnum for a BBC Radio 4 26-part series broadcast between 1978 and 1981. In the radio version, the part of Jenkins as narrator was played by Noel Johnson. A second radio dramatisation by Michael Butt was broadcast during April and May 2008.

In 1995, Powell was awarded an honorary degree (Doctor of Letters) from the University of Bath. 

In 2000 scholars founded The Anthony Powell Society to advance for the public benefit, education and interest in his life and works. The Society publishes quarterly &quot;The Anthony Powell Newsletter&quot; and the journal, &quot;Secret Harmonies.&quot;

A centenary exhibition in commemoration of Powell&#x27;s life and work was held at the Wallace Collection, London, from November 2005 to February 2006. Smaller exhibitions were held in 2005 and 2006 at Eton College, Cambridge University, the Grolier Club in New York City, and Georgetown University in Washington, DC.

Hilary Spurling, a newspaper colleague, had written at Powell&#x27;s request in 1977 &quot;Invitation to the Dance: A Guide to Anthony Powell&#x27;s Dance to the Music of Time&quot;, and in 2017 published his biography, &quot;Anthony Powell: Dancing to the Music of Time&quot;.

A Blue plaque was mounted on 16 September 2023 at 1 Chester Gate London NW1 where Powell began writing &quot;A Dance to the Music of Time&quot;. The Anthony Powell Society organized the ceremony.

He is the founder and only remaining original member of the Steve Miller Band, which he founded in 1966, and is the principal songwriter, lead singer, harmonicist, keyboardist, and one of the guitarists. He began his career in blues and blues rock and evolved to a more pop-oriented arena rock genre during the mid-1970s through the early 1980s, releasing popular singles and albums. Miller was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2016.

==Early years==
Born in Milwaukee, Miller received his first exposure to music from his mother Bertha, whom he described as a remarkable jazz-influenced singer, and his father George, a physician known as &quot;Sonny&quot; who, in addition to his profession as a pathologist, was a jazz enthusiast and an accomplished amateur recording engineer. Guitar virtuoso Les Paul and his musical partner Mary Ford were regular visitors at the Miller house. The Millers were the best man and the matron of honor at the December 1949 Paul/Ford wedding. Paul became Steve&#x27;s godfather. Les Paul heard Steve, who was six, on a wire recording made by his father, &quot;banging away&quot; on a guitar given to him by his uncle, K. Dale Atterbury. Paul encouraged Miller to continue with his interest in the guitar... and &quot;perhaps he will be something one day.&quot;

In 1950, the family relocated to Dallas. Many distinguished musicians came to their house to record and Steve absorbed much from &quot;greats&quot; such as T-Bone Walker, Charles Mingus, and Tal Farlow. Walker taught Steve how to play his guitar behind his back and also with his teeth in 1952. In 1955, Steven began attending St. Mark&#x27;s School in Dallas, a non-denominational preparatory day school for boys where he formed his first band, The Marksmen.

He taught his older brother Buddy to play the bass guitar and also instructed his classmate, Boz Scaggs, on guitar chords so that he could join the band. After leaving St. Mark&#x27;s—&quot;I got kicked out&quot;, he recalled with a laugh in a 2004 interview—he then attended a school in the Lakewood area of Dallas, Woodrow Wilson High School, from which he graduated in 1961. He was inducted into Woodrow&#x27;s Hall of Fame in 2009. Another member is Dusty Hill of ZZ Top.

In 1962, Miller returned to Wisconsin, and entered the University of Wisconsin–Madison, where he formed The Ardells. Scaggs joined the Ardells the next year, and Ben Sidran became the band&#x27;s keyboardist in the following year. After attending the University of Copenhagen in Denmark for a semester in his senior year to study comparative literature, Miller dropped out six credit hours shy of a literature degree, opting to pursue a music career with his mother&#x27;s encouragement and his father&#x27;s misgivings:
[Interviewer:] &quot;When you look back over the span of your career, what are the lasting moments, the sweetest highs?&quot;
[Miller:] I would have to say my father&#x27;s relationship with Les Paul and T-Bone Walker when I was young. Growing up in Dallas, being part of that phenomenal music scene. I found a way to do what I really wanted to do, which is so important for a kid. Near the end of college, my parents said, &#x27;Steve, what are you going to do?&#x27; I said, &#x27;I want to go to Chicago and play the blues.&#x27; My father looked at me like I was insane. But my mom said, &#x27;You should do it now.&#x27; So I went to Chicago. And that was a special time. I played with Muddy Waters and Howlin&#x27; Wolf. I got to work with adults and realized music was what I wanted to do, what I loved.

Upon his return to the United States, Miller moved to Chicago where he immersed himself in the city&#x27;s blues scene. During his time there, he worked with harmonica player Paul Butterfield and jammed with blues greats Muddy Waters, Howlin&#x27; Wolf, and Buddy Guy, all of whom encouraged the young guitarist to pursue music. In 1965, Miller and keyboardist Barry Goldberg formed the Goldberg-Miller Blues Band and began playing on the Chicago club scene. They signed with Epic Records and released a single, &quot;The Mother Song&quot;. They began a residency at a New York City blues club.

When Miller returned from New York, he was disappointed by the Chicago blues scene, so he moved to Texas in hopes of finishing his education at the University of Texas at Austin. He was disenchanted with academic politics at the university and took a Volkswagen Bus his father had given him and headed to San Francisco. After arriving he used his last $5 to see the Butterfield Blues Band and Jefferson Airplane at the Fillmore Auditorium. He fell in love with the vibrant San Francisco music scene and decided to stay.

==Steve Miller Band==

In 1966, he formed the Steve Miller Band (at first called &quot;The Steve Miller Blues Band&quot;), with Miller doing the vocals. They backed Chuck Berry on his &quot;Live at Fillmore Auditorium&quot; album released that year. In 1968, they released an album, &quot;Children of the Future&quot;, the first in a series of discs rooted solidly in the psychedelic blues style that then dominated the San Francisco scene. Writing in &quot;Crawdaddy!&quot;, Peter Knobler called the album &quot;a triple moment of experience, knowledge, inspiration&quot;. Boz Scaggs rejoined Miller for this album and the next one, before starting his solo career.

The group followed the release of their second album, &quot;Sailor&quot;, with &quot;Brave New World&quot;, &quot;Your Saving Grace&quot;, and &quot;Number 5&quot;. These albums performed respectably on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart but failed to yield a major hit single. The highest single was &quot;Livin&#x27; in the USA&quot; from &quot;Sailor&quot;. Songs from this period are featured in a portion of the double album compilation &quot;Anthology&quot;, which includes a guest appearance on bass guitar, drums, and backing vocals by Paul McCartney (as Paul Ramon) on &quot;Celebration Song&quot; and &quot;My Dark Hour&quot;.

Miller established his persona of the &quot;Gangster of Love&quot; (from &quot;Sailor&quot;) and the &quot;Space Cowboy&quot; (from &quot;Brave New World&quot;), which were reused in later works. In 1972, Miller recorded the album &quot;Recall the Beginning...A Journey from Eden&quot;, in which a third persona, &quot;Maurice&quot;, was introduced in the tune &quot;Enter Maurice&quot;.
In 1973, &quot;The Joker&quot; marked the start of the second phase of Miller&#x27;s career: this work was less blues oriented and simpler in composition. The album received significant radio airplay, which helped the title track reach number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. The single hit No 1 on the UK Singles Chart in September 1990 after it was used for a television commercial.

Miller followed up with &quot;Fly Like an Eagle&quot; in 1976, and &quot;Book of Dreams&quot; in 1977. (The songs for both had been recorded at the same time, and released over two single albums rather than one double-album.) This pair of albums represented the peak of Miller&#x27;s commercial career, both reaching the top echelons of the album charts and spawning a lengthy series of hit singles, including &quot;Fly Like an Eagle&quot;, &quot;Rock&#x27;n Me&quot;, &quot;Take the Money and Run&quot;, &quot;Jet Airliner&quot;, and &quot;Jungle Love&quot;. The Steve Miller Band co-headlined a major stadium tour with the Eagles in 1978.

The Steve Miller Band&#x27;s ongoing popularity has been notable. In 1978, &quot;Greatest Hits 1974–78&quot; was released, featuring the big hits from his two most popular albums, &quot;Fly Like an Eagle&quot; and &quot;Book of Dreams&quot; along with the title track from &quot;The Joker&quot;. This popularity also fueled successful concert tours throughout the 1980s and 1990s, often with large numbers of younger people being present at the concerts, many of whom were fans of the big hits and inevitably purchased the greatest hits album. Miller would often headline shows with other classic rock acts, and played a variety of his music, including a selection of his blues work dating from the late 1960s.

==1980s and later==
Miller developed a high degree of music business acumen. He knew that songs earn individual publishing royalties no matter what their length and separated the 57-second electronic introduction from the song &quot;Sacrifice&quot; on &quot;Book of Dreams&quot;, named it &quot;Electro Lux Imbroglio&quot;, and published it separately earning thousands of extra dollars as a result. On the heels of this massive success, Miller took a long hiatus from recording and touring, emerging in 1981 with &quot;Circle of Love&quot;. Sales were disappointing, however, and in 1982 he returned to the pop formula with another hit album, &quot;Abracadabra&quot;. This was Miller&#x27;s last great commercial success; a series of collections, live albums and attempts to find a new style appeared in 1984 (&quot;Italian X-Rays&quot;), 1986 (&quot;Living in the 20th Century&quot;), and 1988 (&quot;Born 2B Blue&quot;). He released &quot;Wide River&quot; in 1993, which was his only studio release of new material between 1988 and 2010.

Miller released &quot;Bingo!&quot; on June 15, 2010. The album of blues covers, issued through his own Space Cowboy label in partnership with Roadrunner Records/ Loud &amp; Proud Records, was his first studio album release since 1993. &quot;Let Your Hair Down&quot;, a companion release to &quot;Bingo!&quot;, was released 10 months later (on April 18, 2011).

For the 2010–11 academic year, Miller was an Artist in Residence at the USC Thornton School of Music, where he taught students in the Popular Music and Music Industry programs.

At a guitar auction in 2011, Miller said that he owned 450 guitars.

In 2016, Miller was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The ceremony caused controversy because of Miller&#x27;s disparaging remarks about the experience being &quot;unpleasant&quot; saying that the Hall of Fame was misogynistic, and ignoring the &quot;need to respect the artists they say they&#x27;re honoring, which they don&#x27;t.&quot; His speech that night only hinted at his anger, congenially thanking the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame &quot;for all of your hard work on behalf of all musicians,&quot; but adding, &quot;and I encourage you to keep expanding your vision, to be more inclusive of women and to be more transparent in your dealings with the public, and most importantly, to do much more to provide music in our schools.&quot; Miller himself said part of his angry behavior that evening was because the Hall vetoed his proposal to be inducted by Elton John, as he &quot;knows me and probably knows my music better than most people&quot;, and its controlling aspects such as the licensing contracts. The Black Keys, who were asked to induct Miller and accepted, having been long-time fans, later stated that they regretted the experience. Dan Auerbach said that for him and Patrick Carney, the unpleasant experience was being around Miller, as he had no idea who the band was and did not care. Auerbach and Carney left the ceremony as soon as they finished their speech, instead of staying for the entire event.

==Legacy and influence==

In May 2024, Eminem released the single &quot;Houdini&quot;, which prominently samples Steve Miller Band&#x27;s 1982 hit &quot;Abracadabra&quot;. Steve Miller praised Eminem for the sample, expressing honor and appreciation for the respectful use of his music.

==Personal life==
Miller has been married four times and his current wife is Janice Ginsberg Miller. From 1976 to 1986, Miller owned the Lippincott-Wagner House and a ranch in the hamlet of Williams, Oregon. In 2015, it was placed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Miller is a member of the Bohemian Club.

<doc id="209948" wikidata="Q327657" url="?curid=209948" title="Rheumatology">
<text>Rheumatology () is a branch of medicine devoted to the diagnosis and management of disorders whose common feature is inflammation in the bones, muscles, joints, and internal organs. Rheumatology covers more than 100 different complex diseases, collectively known as rheumatic diseases, which includes many forms of arthritis as well as lupus and Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome. Doctors who have undergone formal training in rheumatology are called rheumatologists.

Many of these diseases are now known to be disorders of the immune system, and rheumatology has significant overlap with immunology, the branch of medicine that studies the immune system.

== Rheumatologist ==
A rheumatologist is a physician who specializes in the field of medical sub-specialty called rheumatology. A rheumatologist holds a board certification after specialized training. In the United States, training in this field requires four years of undergraduate school, four years of medical school, and then three years of residency, followed by two or three years of additional Fellowship training. The requirements may vary in other countries. Rheumatologists are internists who are qualified by additional postgraduate training and experience in the diagnosis and treatment of arthritis and other diseases of the joints, muscles, and bones. Many rheumatologists also conduct research to determine the cause and better treatments for these disabling and sometimes fatal diseases. Treatment modalities are based on scientific research, currently, the practice of rheumatology is largely evidence-based.

Rheumatologists treat arthritis, autoimmune diseases, pain disorders affecting joints, and osteoporosis. There are more than 200 types of these diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, gout, lupus, back pain, osteoporosis, and tendinitis. Some of these are very serious diseases that can be difficult to diagnose and treat. They treat soft tissue problems related to the musculoskeletal system and sports-related soft tissue disorders.

Pediatric rheumatologist:
A pediatric rheumatologist is a pediatrician who specializes in the treatment of children with rheumatic disease. Both specialties are important to address a child&#x27;s milestone development and disease treatment throughout childhood. However, recognition of this sub-specialty has been slow, which has resulted in a global shortage of pediatric rheumatologists, and as a consequence, the demand for healthcare support far exceeds current service capacities. Raising awareness of this is important to attract more upcoming pediatricians into this rewarding area of healthcare.

===Soft tissue rheumatism===
Local diseases and lesions affecting the joints and structures around the joints including tendons, ligaments capsules, bursae, stress fractures, muscles, nerve entrapment, vascular lesions, and ganglia. For example:
*Low back pain
*Tennis elbow
*Golfer&#x27;s elbow
*Olecranon bursitis

== Diagnosis ==

===Physical examination===
Following are examples of methods of diagnosis able to be performed in a normal physical examination.
* Schober&#x27;s test tests the flexion of the lower back.
* Multiple joint inspection
* Musculoskeletal Examination
** Screening Musculoskeletal Exam (SMSE) - a rapid assessment of structure and function
** General Musculoskeletal Exam (GMSE) - a comprehensive assessment of joint inflammation
** Regional Musculoskeletal Exam (RMSE) - focused assessments of structure, function and inflammation combined with special testing

===Specialized===
* Laboratory tests (e.g. Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate, Rheumatoid Factor, Anti-CCP (Anti-citrullinated protein antibody), ANA (Anti-Nuclear Antibody) )
* X-rays, Ultrasounds, and other imaging methods of affected joints
* Cytopathology and chemical pathology of fluid aspirated from affected joints (e.g. to differentiate between septic arthritis and gout)

== Treatment ==

Most rheumatic diseases are treated with analgesics, NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug), steroids (in serious cases), DMARDs (disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs), monoclonal antibodies, such as infliximab and adalimumab, the TNF inhibitor etanercept, and methotrexate for moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis. The biologic agent rituximab (anti-B cell therapy) is now licensed for use in refractory rheumatoid arthritis.
Physiotherapy is vital in the treatment of many rheumatological disorders. Occupational therapy can help patients find alternative ways for common movements that would otherwise be restricted by their disease. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis often need a long term, coordinated and a multidisciplinary team approach towards management of individual patients. Treatment is often tailored according to the individual needs of each patient which is also dependent on the response and the tolerability of medications.

Beginning in the 2000s, the incorporation of biopharmaceuticals (which include inhibitors of TNF-alpha, certain interleukins, and the JAK-STAT signaling pathway) into standards of care is one of the paramount developments in modern rheumatology.

===Rheumasurgery===
&quot;Rheumasurgery&quot; (or rheumatoid surgery) is a subfield of orthopedics occupied with the surgical treatment of patients with rheumatic diseases. The purpose of the interventions is to limit disease activity, soothe pain and improve function.

Rheumasurgical interventions can be divided in two groups. The one is early synovectomies, that is the removal of the inflamed synovia in order to prevent spreading and stop destruction. The other group is the so-called corrective intervention, i.e. an intervention done after destruction has taken place. Among the corrective interventions are joint replacements, removal of loose bone or cartilage fragments, and a variety of interventions aimed at repositioning and/or stabilizing joints, such as arthrodesis.

== Research directions ==
Recently, a large body of scientific research deals with the background of autoimmune disease, the cause of many rheumatic disorders. Also, the field of osteoimmunology has emerged to further examine the interactions between the immune system, joints, and bones. Epidemiological studies and medication trials are also being conducted. The Rheumatology Research Foundation is the largest private funding source of rheumatology research and training in the United States.

==History==

Rheum surgery emerged in the cooperation of rheumatologists and orthopedic surgeons in Heinola, Finland, during the 1950s.

In 1970 a Norwegian investigation estimated that at least 50% of patients with rheumatic symptoms needed rheumasurgery as an integrated part of their treatment.

The European Rheumatoid Arthritis Surgical Society (ERASS) was founded in 1979.

Around the turn of the 21st century, focus for treatment of patients with rheumatic disease shifted, and pharmacological treatment became dominant, while surgical interventions became rarer.
