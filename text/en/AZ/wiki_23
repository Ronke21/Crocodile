<text>The Royal Danish Navy (, ) is the sea-based branch of the Danish Armed Forces force. The RDN is mainly responsible for maritime defence and maintaining the sovereignty of Danish territorial waters (incl. Faroe Islands and Greenland). Other tasks include surveillance, search and rescue, icebreaking, oil spill recovery and prevention as well as contributions to international tasks and forces.

During the period 1509–1814, when Denmark was in a union with Norway, the Danish Navy was part of the Dano-Norwegian Navy. Until the copenhagenization of the navy in 1801, and again in 1807, the navy was a major strategic influence in the European geographical area, but since then its size and influence has drastically declined with a change in government policy. Despite this, the navy is now equipped with a number of large state-of-the-art vessels commissioned since the end of the Cold War. This can be explained by its strategic location as the NATO member controlling access to the Baltic.

Danish Navy ships carry the ship prefix KDM (&quot;Kongelige Danske Marine&quot;) in Danish, but this is translated to HDMS (&quot;Her / His Danish Majesty&#x27;s Ship&quot;) in English. Denmark is one of the many NATO member states whose navies do not deploy submarines. However, historically Denmark has operated them, the submarines were retired in 2004 as part of cooperative defence agreement and restructuring. The Royal Danish Navy has operated a wide variety of vessels over the years, including different types of submarines, patrol boats, minesweepers, missile boats, and frigates. It has also operated a variety of aircraft, and the use of helicopters for search and rescue missions and transport, for example, has been a part of its mission.

==History==

The geographic layout of Denmark proper (not including Greenland and the Faroe Islands) has a coastline to land area ratio of 1:5.9. For comparison, the figure for the Netherlands is 1:92.1 and for the United States, 1:493.2. Denmark therefore naturally has long-standing maritime traditions, dating back to the 9th century when the Vikings had small but well-organised fleets. They were often based in a small number of villages, usually with a common defence agreement; Viking ships, usually of the &quot;Knarr&quot; type, were light, and therefore easy to transport from village to village over land. With time, the defence pacts gave rise to larger, more offensive fleets which the Vikings used for plundering coastal areas. In the period after the Vikings, and up to the 15th century, the fleet consisted mainly of merchant vessels. Indeed, it is said that king Valdemar Sejr had more than 1,000 ships during the conquest of Estonia in 1219. Together they carried more than 30,000 soldiers with horses and supplies.

Records exist of a unified Danish navy from the late 14th century. Queen Margaret I, who had just founded the Kalmar Union (consisting of Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Iceland, Greenland, Faroe Islands, Shetland, Orkney, parts of Finland and parts of Germany) ordered the building of a navy – mainly to defend the union against the Hanseatic League. Earlier the national fleet had consisted of vessels owned and operated by the nobility, but the country as such did not have a navy. The earlier monarchs therefore had to rely on conscription from the nobility, which was not always easy as the monarchy itself often had enemies within the nobility. Queen Margaret I gave instructions for a navy to be constituted and maintained under the control of the monarchy. The nobility still had to provide crews (which consisted mainly of &quot;volunteered&quot; farmers) for these ships, though the core crew-members (i.e. masters, master-at-arms and master carpenters) could be employed by the monarch. There were also education officers, mainly levied from the nobility.

In the 15th century, especially during the reign of King Hans, Danish trade expanded appreciably, increasing the need for the delivery of merchandise. As shipping was the ideal means of transport at the time, Danish maritime interests had to be further protected. King Hans is credited with establishing a joint Dano-Norwegian fleet in 1509, substantially increasing the number of professional crewmembers. They were mainly petty criminals, who had to choose between working in the king&#x27;s navy or imprisonment. They received basic training in seamanship and carpentry, enabling them to sail the ships. Responsibility for weaponry and combat was still in the hands of conscripted farmers. For these, the country was divided into a number of counties – known in Danish as &quot;skipæn&quot; (the term &quot;skip&quot; being related to the Danish word for ship, &quot;skib&quot;), which would later serve as the Danish dioceses. It was also during this period that dedicated naval bases and shipyards were founded. They would build, maintain and fit out the king&#x27;s navy. The first record of a dedicated naval base is &quot;Bremerholmd&quot; (later &quot;Gammelholm&quot;) in the year 1500.

===Founding of the Royal Danish Navy===

The founding of the Royal Danish Navy is often viewed in Denmark as taking place on 10 August 1510, when King Hans appointed his vassal Henrik Krummedige to become &quot;chief captain and head of all our captains, men and servants whom we now have appointed and ordered to be at sea.&quot;

When King Frederick II was crowned in 1559, he immediately began expanding the navy. The number of bases, yards and vessels rose rapidly and substantial resources were used for new ship designs, weaponry, training and battle tactics. Sweden, which had become an independent country, dominated a large part of the Baltic Sea and threatened Danish merchant interests. In retaliation, Denmark closed the Øresund in 1568, laying the first seeds for the Scanian War (1675–1679), only eight years after the end of the second Nordic War (1657–1660), during which Denmark lost the now Swedish provinces of &quot;Skåne&quot;, &quot;Halland&quot; and &quot;Blekinge&quot;. During this period, further resources were allocated to the navy. Niels Juel led the Royal Danish Navy to a victory in the Battle of Køge Bay in 1677.

King Christian IV (crowned in 1588) continued in his father&#x27;s footsteps. In the beginning of the 17th century, he considerably expanded the naval workships. In Copenhagen, where the navy resided, he built a large number of homes for crewmembers and workshop craftsmen – the most famous being Nyboder (completed in 1631) which still stands in central Copenhagen.

General admiral lieutenant Ulrik Christian Gyldenløve was appointed supreme commander of the navy in 1701. He raised the status of the naval profession and established &quot;Søkadetakademie&quot;, the predecessor of the Royal Danish Naval Academy. In 1709, Peter Jansen Wessel joined the navy. He was later given the rank of admiral as a reward for his many victories – most famously at &quot;Marstrand&quot; and &quot;Dynekilden&quot;. He was later known as &quot;Tordenskjold&quot;.

In 1712, Tordenskjold succeeded in burning 80 Swedish naval cruisers, which played a large part in the outcome of the Great Nordic War (1709–1720). Since Scandinavia now was at peace, the navy focused its resources on other parts of the world, partaking in the colonisation of Africa and the Caribbean. A permanent naval presence of shifting strength was maintained in the Mediterranean Sea – protecting Danish-Norwegian interests in the region – mainly commerces against piracy. The Danish Mediterranean Squadron had numerous minor engagements with The Barbary States during the 1700s and 1800s. On several occasions these hostilities escalated to substantial actions. Some of the more notable can be said to be: the Mediterranean Squadron&#x27;s bombardment of Algiers in 1770 under the command of rear admiral Frederik Christian Kaas; the then captain, and future Privy Councillor, Steen Andersen Bille&#x27;s action at Tripoli in 1797; and commander Hans Georg Garde in a joint Scandinavian expedition in 1844 – which effectively ended the Barbary states&#x27; attacks on Scandinavian merchants in the region. A pact of neutrality was made between Denmark (including Norway) and Sweden, providing a solid basis for commercial expansion.

===Copenhagenization and rebuilding===

The British, under pressure from the French in the Napoleonic Wars, became increasingly reluctant to allow Denmark to trade overseas as they believed First French Consul &amp; General Bonaparte could benefit economically from Danish commerce. In 1801, they decided send a fleet to attack a Danish fleet, in the Battle of Copenhagen, under the command of Admiral Hyde Parker. The defence line, under the command of Olfert Fischer, put up a fierce fight, but was defeated, with the loss of 3 ships sunk and 12 captured. After the battle, the Crown Prince agreed to sign a truce with the British. In the following six years, Denmark managed to stay clear of the Napoleonic Wars, until the events leading to a second confrontation in 1807. Britain was afraid that the Danish fleet might fall under the control of Napoleon, perhaps tipping the balance in his favour. King Christian VII refused to hand over his navy to the British for safekeeping until the end of the war, and the British decided to capture the fleet by force. Copenhagen was bombarded and the king forced to surrender the fleet.

In 1814, Denmark and Norway were separated relatively peacefully, after more than 300 years together. At the same time, the Common Fleet was split into the Royal Danish Navy and the Royal Norwegian Navy.

The navy was slowly rebuilt, but it was nowhere near its former size. Faith was nevertheless placed in the navy, interests in Africa and the Caribbean still receiving considerable attention. In 1845, a two-year research expedition was launched on the corvette &quot;Galathea&quot;. In the Second Schleswig War (1864), the navy was still relatively small and old-fashioned, even though the Prussian Navy was even smaller. Only a few steam vessels were at hand and these had a large impact on the war, in the end Prussians were not very successful at sea. As a result, it was considered necessary for the navy to be modernised. By the outbreak of World War I (1914), the Danish navy was a very modern fleet, mainly equipped with armoured steam ships and only a very few sailing ships.

===Interwar period and World War II===

In the period between the two World Wars, the Royal Danish Navy (as well as the rest of the Danish military forces) had low priority for the politicians, especially between 1929 and 1942 under Thorvald Stauning. During the first year of the German occupation (1940–1945), the navy assisted the occupying German forces with minesweeping, because of the political demand of keeping the infrastructure (ferry-lines) up and running. The tensions between the German soldiers and the Danish armed forces rose slowly and, on 29 August 1943, they managed to scuttle 32 of its larger ships, while Germany succeeded in seizing 14 of the larger and 50 of the smaller vessels. This was due to a secret order, given directly to the captains by word of mouth by commander of the navy, Vice Admiral A. H. Vedel &quot;to try to flee to the nearest neutral or Nazi-opposed port. If that was not possible, the ship should be scuttled at as deep a location as possible.&quot; The Germans later succeeded in raising and refitting 15 of the sunken ships. A number of vessels had been ordered to attempt to escape to Swedish waters, and 13 succeeded. The fleet flagship, &quot;Niels Juel&quot;, attempted to break out in the Battle of Isefjord but the crew was forced to beach and partly scuttle her. The score for the larger vessels was therefore: 32 vessels were sunk, 2 were in Greenland, 4 reached Sweden, 14 were captured by the Germans. As for the smaller vessels: 9 &quot;patruljekuttere&quot; reached Sweden, 50 others were captured by the Germans. By the autumn of 1944, these ships officially formed a Danish naval flotilla in exile. In September 1943, A. H. Vedel was fired by order of the prime minister Vilhelm Buhl because of his hostile actions towards the Germans.



In the post-war years, Denmark joined NATO in 1949. As a result, Denmark received large amounts of material and financing through the Marshall Plan. Furthermore, several ships were purchased from the British and a number of vessels were transferred from the disarmed &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot;.

===Cold War===
During the Cold War, the Danish navy was rebuilt and modernised, with the main assignment being to repel an invasion from the Warsaw Pact. Typical operations requiring training were minelaying (the now disbanded minelayers of the &quot;Falster&quot; class (, ), were the world&#x27;s largest minelayers at their time – each had a complement of 280 900 kg mines) and sting attacks with small but fast combat craft (such as the &quot;Søløven&quot;-class fast torpedo boats (, ) and missile torpedo boats (, ) and a self-sustaining mobile missile battery (MOBA) equipped with targeting and guidance, capable of firing Harpoon missiles. The Danish intelligence capabilities were also expanded and the Danish submarines trained for &quot;very shallow water operations&quot;, while a special naval force – the Danish Frogman Corps was created. The naval bases in Frederikshavn and Korsør plus the fortresses at Langeland and Stevns were created through NATO funds in the 1950s. In case of war all Danish combat vessels were assigned to NATO&#x27;s Allied Forces Baltic Approaches&#x27;s naval command NAVBALTAP.

===Post-Cold War===

Since the end of the Cold War, the navy has been in a transitional phase, from local defence to global operations, with fewer but larger vessels able to operate for long periods at sea. It has also been more self-sustaining. Under the defence agreement (1995–1999) that initiated the process, several of the old &quot;Cold War&quot; frigates and minesweepers were decommissioned. The squadron structure prior to this defence agreement was as follows:

* 1st Squadron = The North Atlantic Squadron (Danish: &#x27;InspektionsSkibsEskadren&#x27; (ISE)) with 5 ocean patrol vessels (1 &quot;Beskytteren&quot; class, 4 &quot;Thetis&quot; class), 3 ocean patrol cutters (&quot;Agdlek&quot; class) and 4 icebreakers
* 2nd Squadron = The Frigate Squadron (Danish: &#x27;FreGatEskadren&#x27; (FGE)) with 2 frigates (&quot;Peder Skram&quot; class), 3 corvettes (&quot;Niels Juel&quot; class), 14 StanFlex-vessels () and 6 seaward defence craft (&quot;Daphne&quot; class, decommissioned in 1991)
* 3rd Squadron = The Mine Squadron (Danish: &#x27;MineSkibsEskadren&#x27; (MSE)) with 4 minelayers (&quot;Falster&quot; class), 2 cable-minelayers (&quot;Lindormen&quot; class) and 7 minesweepers (&quot;Sund&quot; class, decommissioned in 1999)
* 4th Squadron = The Torpedo Boat Squadron (Danish: &#x27;TorpedoBådsEskadren&#x27; (TBE)) with 13 torpedo-/missile boats (8 &quot;Willemoes&quot; class, 5 &quot;Søløven&quot; class), 2 oilers (&quot;Faxe&quot; class) and a truck-detachment with missiles and radars called &quot;MOBA&quot;
* 5th Squadron = The Submarine Squadron (Danish: &#x27;UndervandsBådsEskadren&#x27; (UBE)) with 6 submarines (3 &quot;Tumleren&quot; class, 3 &quot;Springeren&quot; class) and the Frogmans Corps

In the defence agreement of 2000–2004, further restructuring of the navy was ordered, as well as the decommissioning of several units. Furthermore, the only unit of &quot;Beskytteren&quot; class was donated to the Estonian Navy as . With the decommissioning of the torpedo boats, the 4th squadron was disbanded and the remnants were transferred to the 2nd squadron. Other units were also decommissioned. The squadron structure now looked like this:
* 1st Squadron with 4 ocean patrol vessels (&quot;Thetis&quot; class), 3 ocean patrol cutters (&quot;Agdlek&quot; class) and 3 icebreakers
* 2nd Squadron with 3 corvettes (&quot;Niels Juel&quot; class), 14 StanFlex-vessels (&quot;Flyvefisken&quot; class), 2 oilers (&quot;Faxe&quot; class) and a truck-detachment with missiles and radars called &quot;MOBA&quot; and a new truck-unit &quot;MLOG&quot; with shops, spare parts, mechanics, etc.
* 3rd Squadron = The Mine Squadron (Danish: &#x27;MineSkibsEskadren&#x27; (MSE)) with 4 minelayers (&quot;Falster&quot; class) and 2 cable-minelayers (&quot;Lindormen&quot; class)
* 5th Squadron = The Submarine Squadron (Danish: &#x27;UndervandsBådsEskadren&#x27; (UBE)) with 4 submarines (3 &quot;Tumleren&quot; class, 1 &quot;Kronbrog&quot; class – leased Swedish &quot;&quot;) and the Frogman Corps

On 1 January 2006, a major reorganisation was carried out as a part of the defence agreement of 2005–2009 (which also put an end to the 95-year-old submarine service, with no intention of developing future submarine capability), when the former four squadrons were divided into two squadrons:

* 1st Squadron – domestic affairs squadron
* 2nd Squadron – foreign affairs squadron

On 18 August 2022, the Defence Ministry announced the start of a major naval shipbuilding project, with a commitment of in funding to build new warships, in part as a response to the recent Russian invasion of Ukraine. The funding is expected to be committed to programs that will roll out to ship commissioning over a 20 to 25 year period, and is a part of the government of Denmark&#x27;s recent publicly stated plan to increase defence spending to two percent of the country&#x27;s gross domestic product (GDP).

==Structure of the Royal Danish Navy==

=== Structure circa 2018 ===


The Naval Staff (in Danish &quot;Marinestaben&quot;), led by a Rear Admiral, the Admiral Danish Fleet, is directly responsible to the Danish Defence Command. Since 2014, it has been placed at Karup Air Base.

The Danish Task Group is a headquarters tasked with commanding, educating and training maritime forces in peace, crisis and war. It is a mobile unit that is experienced in orchestrating exercises, organising insertions (search and rescue, non-combatant evacuation operations, disaster relief operations, etc.) and commanding naval, aerial and land-based units. Danish Task Group was created to expand Denmark&#x27;s level of competency and quality of material, by participating in international maritime operations. The Danish Task Group has commanded combined maritime forces in both exercises (such as BALTOPS and Joint Warrior) and operations (Combined Task Force 150 (2008) and Combined Task Force 151 (2012)) a number of times.

Today the fleet is divided into three squadrons:

* , administratively based at &quot;Naval Base Frederikshavn&quot;, handles all tasks regarding Arctic Ocean affairs, such as maritime defence and sovereignty of Greenlandic and Faroese territorial waters, surveillance, search and rescue and oil spill recovery and prevention. It has provided units for international tasks, such as the environmental recovery vessel &quot;Gunnar Seidenfaden&quot; for the cleanup after the Prestige oil spill and the ocean patrol vessel for the protection force programme of WFP chartered ships at the Horn of Africa.
* , administratively based at &quot;Naval Base Korsør&quot;, is specialized in foreign affairs. It conducts exercises for participation in various international tasks, such as providing protection force, disaster relief operations and non-combatant evacuation operations. It permanently provides units for international standing maritime groups as well as supporting various maritime operations. 
* , administratively based at &quot;Naval Base Frederikshavn&quot;, handles all tasks regarding domestic affairs such as maritime defence and sovereignty of Denmark, territorial waters, surveillance, search and rescue, icebreaking and oil spill recovery and prevention.

===Naval Operational Logistic Sites===

The Naval Operational Logistic Support Structure (OPLOG), includes the naval bases in Frederikshavn and Korsør as well as several naval stations. The naval bases&#x27; task is to provide logistic support for the ships and vessels, through the OPLOGs. This includes configuration, maintaining and repairing the units. Furthermore, similar support is provided to civilian agencies (i.e. the Danish police) and allied units like the United Nations

The support is mainly provided within the geographical areas of the naval bases. For Naval Base Korsør that is Zealand, Funen, Bornholm as well as the surrounding waters. For Naval Base Frederikshavn it is Jutland, Greenland and the Faroe Islands. Moreover, general support is provided for units participating in international operations in peacetime, as well as all units in crisis and wartime.

The navy maintains a number of naval stations. These are smaller stations with limited support functions. The best known is the publicly accessible Naval Station Holmen in Copenhagen. There are also naval stations located in Kongsøre

===Naval schools===

Runs three main schools, with five special schools:
* Naval NCO and Basic Training School (Danish: Søværnets Sergent – og Grundskole (SSG)) near Frederikshavn
* Danish naval academy (Danish: Søværnets Officersskole) at Holmen, Copenhagen
* Naval specialist schools (Danish: Søværnets specialskoler):
** Naval Warfare School (Danish: Center For Taktikkursus (TAK)) at Naval Base Frederikshavn and Holmen, Copenhagen
** Naval Weapons School (Danish: Center For Våben (VBK)) at Sjællands Odde
** Naval Technical School (Danish: Center For Teknik (CT)) at Holmen, Copenhagen
** Naval Damage Control School (Danish: Center For Skibssikkerhed (SHK)) near Frederikshavn
** Naval Diving School (Danish: Center For Dykning (CD)) at Holmen, Copenhagen
** Naval Centre for Sergeant and Maritime Education (Danish: Center For Sergent og Maritim Uddannelse)

=== Royal Danish Navy in the late 1980s ===



The navy headquarters was located in Aarhus, tasked to train, maintain and prepare the navy for war. Operational command in peacetime rested with the Navy Operational Command. In war the commander of the Royal Danish Navy would have assumed his appointment as &quot;Flag Officer Denmark (FOD)&quot; under the command of Allied Naval Forces Baltic Approaches (NAVBALTAP), which was commanded alternatingly by a Danish or German vice admiral. However Danish ships and units based in Greenland and the Faroe Islands would have come under command of NATO&#x27;s Command Eastern Atlantic Area (EASTLANT), who would also have taken command of Island Command Greenland and Island Command Faroes.

Together with the German Fleet under the Flag Officer Germany (FOG), the RDN would have tried to keep the Warsaw Pact&#x27;s United Baltic Sea Fleets, consisting of the Soviet Baltic Fleet, Polish Navy and East German Volksmarine bottled up in the Baltic Sea by blocking the Danish straits and thus ensuring NATOs unchallenged control of the North Sea. Additionally NAVBALTAP was to prevent amphibious landings on the Danish coast. To fulfill its mission the navy fielded a large number of minelayers and fast attack crafts. The first would have been used to mine all sealanes and potential landings beaches, while the latter would have harassed the enemy fleet with continuous hit and run attacks.

At the beginning of 1989 the Royal Danish Navy consisted of the following ships:

* Royal Danish Navy, in Aarhus, commanded by a vice admiral

==International operations==

The contemporary Royal Danish Navy has participated in the following international operations:
==Vessels==

The Danish navy currently operates:
* 12 larger vessels (displacement &gt; 1,500 t(m))
* 4 medium-size vessels (1,500 t(m) &gt; displacement &gt; 500 t(m)), and
* 38 small vessels (500 t(m) &gt; displacement &gt; 15 t(m)),

as well as a number of rigid-hulled inflatable boats, boats etc.

The navy ship programs are generally of the &quot;newer but fewer&quot; type. Many of the vessels are of more recent dates (&quot;Absalon&quot; class from 2004 to 2005, &quot;Thetis&quot; class from 1991 to 1994 and &quot;Flyvefisken&quot; class from 1986 to 1995) or under replacement, i.e. the corvettes of the &quot;Niels Juel&quot; class (1978–1980) have been replaced with three new for 2nd Squadron and the &quot;Barsø&quot; class (1969–1973) has been replaced with 6 &quot;Diana&quot;-class small patrol crafts. Finally all three &quot;Agdlek&quot; class vessels (1973–1979) have been replaced with the new vessels.

In addition, the Royal Danish Navy and the German Navy are in cooperation in the &quot;Ark Project&quot;. This agreement made the Ark Project responsible for the strategic sealift of Danish and German armed forces where the full-time charter of three roll-on-roll-off cargo and troop ships are ready for deployments. Furthermore, these ships are also kept available for the use of the other European NATO countries.

==Air service==

===Early years===

The Royal Danish Navy has operated aircraft since 1912 either as a functional part of the navy or as flights conducted by the Royal Danish Air Force. Aviation pioneer Robert Svendsen purchased the first aircraft, a Henry Farman, and gave it to the navy who subsequently named it &quot;Glenten&quot; (kite). Later the same year, a private funding effort made it possible to purchase two Donnet-Leveque flying boats named &quot;Maagen&quot; (gull) and &quot;Ternen&quot; (tern).

At the outbreak of World War One the navy had two operational flying boats and five trained pilots making it possible to make daily reconnaissance flights over the Sound, monitoring German mine-laying activities.

From 1914 to 1917, &quot;Orlogsværftet&quot; (Danish naval yard) produced eight OV-flying boats and in 1915 and 1916 two naval flying stations were established in Copenhagen and Nyborg, mainly focusing on the two international seaways Øresund and Storebælt.

After the war the Danish production of aircraft was stopped due to several crashes and an international surplus of warplanes. Following British advice, five Avro 504s were purchased for training purposes, and based in Ringsted between the two important straits.

===Fighter aircraft===

In 1925, three land-based fighter aircraft were purchased to be based in Ringsted. A modified version of the Hawker Woodcock, the Hawker Danecock, was initially delivered from the UK while a following series of 12 aircraft were license-built by the Orlogsværft.

In 1928 the naval air service procured six Heinkel HE 8 floatplanes, with another 16 to be license-built by the Orlogsværft. As Germany were not allowed to produce military aircraft, the planes were labelled as mail planes, but they could easily be refitted with dual machine guns, radio equipment and a capacity for eight bombs.

The Heinkel had an unexpected Arctic employment in the early 1930s when a dispute over East Greenland caused the first deployment of aircraft, along with three naval ships, in Greenland. Following settlement of the dispute between Denmark and Norway the Heinkels were used in the efforts to map the frontiers of the island.

In 1933, two Hawker Nimrods were acquired to keep pace with the rapidly evolving technology of naval aircraft . A further ten aircraft were to be produced under licence at the Orlogsværft. The new aircraft made the air base in Ringsted inadequate and the naval air service was moved to the Avnø peninsula at southern Zealand.

===Attack aircraft===

In 1932, the navy purchased its first offensive capacity, two Hawker Horsley torpedo bombers with an option to produce a following series on the Orlogsværft. After four years of testing and practice, the naval air service had agreed to expand the offensive capacities with the Horsley, but at this time funding from the Danish government had been cut and no further torpedo bombers were acquired.

In the late 1930s, the government changed plans and increased the budget for military purchases following the German expansions in central Europe. In 1938, 12 Fairey P.4/34s were to be produced at Orlogsværftet, along with 12 Italian Macchi C.200 fighters. None of these were produced before the German invasion of Denmark on April 9, 1940.

===Helicopters===

Helicopters are deployed to Danish naval ships from Eskadrille 723 of the Royal Danish Air Force. When initiated in 1962, the naval helicopters consisted of a flight of Alouette III helicopters of RDAF squadron 722.

Primarily for use on the in operations in Greenland and the Faeroe Islands, but also on in international operations and off Greenland as well as participating in exercises. The independent unit was established in 1977 as &quot;Søværnets Flyvetjeneste&quot; operating (Aérospatiale Alouette III (1977–1982) and Westland Lynx (1980–2018) helicopters. In 1989, the Navy had one 
Lynx 23, six Lynx 80, and two Lynx 90.

On 6 December 2012, the Royal Danish Air Force officially ordered nine MH-60R Seahawk helicopters, with all delivered in 2018, following a competition on the procurement involving the NH90, AgustaWestlands AW159 Wildcat and the AW101 along with Sikorsky&#x27;s other bid H-92 Superhawk.

<text>Christopher Francis Patten, Baron Patten of Barnes (; born 12 May 1944), is a British politician who was the Chairman of the Conservative Party from 1990 to 1992, and the 28th and last Governor of Hong Kong from 1992 to 1997. He was made a life peer in 2005 and served as Chancellor of the University of Oxford from 2003 to 2024. He is one of two living former governors of Hong Kong, alongside David Wilson. 

Patten was born in Thornton-Cleveleys in Lancashire and subsequently raised in west London. He studied history at Balliol College, Oxford, and, after graduating in 1965, he began working for the Conservative Party.

Patten was elected Member of Parliament for Bath in 1979. He was appointed Secretary of State for the Environment by Margaret Thatcher in 1989 as part of her third ministry, becoming responsible for implementation of the unpopular poll tax. On John Major&#x27;s succession as Prime Minister in 1990, Patten became Chairman of the Conservative Party and Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. As party chairman, he successfully orchestrated a surprise Conservative electoral victory in 1992, but lost his own seat.

Patten was then appointed the last governor of Hong Kong, to oversee the final years of British administration in the colony and prepare for its transfer to China in 1997. During his tenure, his government significantly expanded the territory&#x27;s social welfare programmes and introduced democratic reforms to the electoral system.

Following his governorship, Patten led the Independent Commission on Policing for Northern Ireland, a major implementation step of the Northern Ireland peace process pursuant to the Good Friday Agreement from 1998 to 1999. He was European Commissioner for External Relations from 1999 to 2004 and Chairman of the BBC Trust from 2011 to 2014.

== Early life and education ==
Patten was born in Thornton-Cleveleys in Lancashire, where his mother had fled to from Exeter, which had recently been significantly damaged by the Baedeker raids. Patten grew up in an Irish Catholic family in west London, the son of an unsuccessful music publisher whose ancestors had come to England from County Roscommon, Ireland. Patten&#x27;s father, Frank, dropped out of university to become a jazz-drummer, later, a popular-music publisher. Frank and his mother Joan sent him to a Catholic primary school, Our Lady of the Visitation, in Greenford, and later awarded a scholarship&lt;ref name=&quot;themilsource/who-patten&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; to the independent St Benedict&#x27;s School in Ealing, west London, where he won an exhibition&lt;ref name=&quot;sylviavetta/patten-interview&quot;&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; to read Modern History at Balliol College, Oxford.

After graduating with a second-class honours degree in 1965 and winning a William Coolidge Pathfinder Award&lt;ref name=&quot;balliol.ox.ac.uk/pathfinders-awards&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;europarl/dg3/com/patten&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; travelling scholarship to the US,&lt;ref name=&quot;bsg.ox.ac.uk/Patten-lecture&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;encyclopedia/patten-chris-1944&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cherwell/2012/03/01/travel-grant&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Patten worked for the campaign of then-Republican New York Mayor John Lindsay, where he reported on the television performance of rival William F. Buckley Jr. He worked for the Conservative Party from 1966, first as desk officer and then director (from 1974 to 1979) of the Conservative Research Department.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc/news/hk/patten&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Member of Parliament: 1979–1992 ==
Patten was the Conservative Party candidate for Lambeth Central at the February 1974 general election, but lost to the Labour Party candidate, Marcus Lipton. He was elected as the Member of Parliament for Bath in 1979, and served until he was unseated in 1992.

=== In government ===
Patten was appointed Parliamentary Under-Secretary for the Northern Ireland Office in June 1983. He was promoted to be a Minister of State in the Department of Education and Science in September 1985, and was named Minister for Overseas Development at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in September 1986.

In 1989, he was promoted to the Cabinet as Secretary of State for the Environment and became responsible for the unpopular Community Charge (or so-called &quot;Poll Tax&quot;). Though he robustly defended the policy at the time, in his 2006 book &quot;Not Quite the Diplomat&quot; (published in the United States as &quot;Cousins and Strangers: America, Britain and Europe in the New Century&quot;) he claims to have thought it was a mistake on Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s part. He also introduced, and steered through Parliament, the major legislation that became the Environmental Protection Act 1990.

In 1990, John Major made Patten Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and Chairman of the Conservative Party, with responsibility for organising the Conservative Party&#x27;s re-election campaign for the upcoming general election. As party chairman, he was widely considered to be the main architect of the somewhat unexpected Conservative victory at the 1992 general election. However, he lost his marginal seat of Bath to the Liberal Democrat candidate Don Foster at that election. Patten&#x27;s defeat was attributed to factors such as the Poll Tax.

== Governor of Hong Kong: 1992–1997 ==
If Patten had been re-elected in 1992, sections of the media thought he would have been rewarded by appointment as Foreign Secretary, although in his autobiography John Major said that he would have made Patten Chancellor of the Exchequer.

Patten turned down offers of a new post and instead, in July 1992, he became the 28th and the last governor of Hong Kong until its transfer of sovereignty to China on 30 June 1997. He was given an official Chinese name, Pang Ding-hong (), a name with an etymology based on the words &quot;stability&quot; and &quot;calm; joyous; healthy&quot;. Unlike most previous Hong Kong governors, he was not a career diplomat from the UK Foreign Office although he was not the first former MP to become a governor of Hong Kong.

Patten&#x27;s tenure faced several different challenges, as many in Hong Kong were still reeling from the Tiananmen Square massacre a few years earlier. However the general public regarded him positively. He took steps to get in touch with the people of the colony, and was known for his penchant for taking public strolls around Hong Kong as well as in the media limelight. Hongkongers nicknamed him Fat Pang (), making him the only governor to have a widely recognised Chinese nickname.

In contrast to his predecessors, Patten decided not to wear the official Court uniform on formal occasions. Patten&#x27;s approval rating in Hong Kong in April 1992 was 53% and ended his tenure with an approval rating of 59.7%.

Patten&#x27;s most controversial actions in Hong Kong are related to the 1994 electoral reform. LegCo members returned in 1995 were originally to serve beyond the Handover, thereby providing institutional continuity across the transition of Hong Kong to the PRC. Beijing had expected that the use of functional constituencies with limited electorates would be used to elect this council, however Patten extended the definition of functional constituencies and thus virtually every Hong Konger was able to vote for the so-called indirectly elected members (see Politics of Hong Kong) of the Legislative Council.

The Legislative Council became a fully elected legislature for the first time in 1995 and extensively expanded its functions and organisations throughout the last years of colonial rule.

Patten&#x27;s actions were strongly criticised by the pro-Beijing political parties of Hong Kong. Patten was also denounced by some Chinese media and politicians as the &quot;whore of the East&quot; and a &quot;serpent&quot;, and was most famously called a &quot;sinner who would be condemned for a thousand generations&quot; () by Lu Ping, the head of China&#x27;s Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office. The legislative council which was elected under Patten&#x27;s governorship was dissolved upon the handover of Hong Kong to the PRC and replaced by a Provisional Legislative Council which did not have any democratic functions until elections were held under the previous rules in 1998.

At midnight Hong Kong Time 1 July 1997 (16:00 GMT, 30 June 1997), he sent the telegram: &quot;I have relinquished the administration of this government. God Save The Queen. Patten.&quot; This marked the end of British rule in Hong Kong. After the handover ceremony he left the city, together with Prince Charles, on board the British royal yacht, HMY &quot;Britannia&quot;. Patten was noted to be in tears throughout the day, notably after his speech at Tamar. He has since commented that his governorship of Hong Kong was a happy time for him personally as he shared this experience with his wife and children.

== Post-governorship ==

From 1998 to 1999, he chaired the Independent Commission on Policing for Northern Ireland, better known as the &quot;Patten Commission&quot;, which had been established in 1998 as part of the Belfast Agreement. On 9 September 1999, the Commission produced its report, entitled &quot;A New Beginning: Policing in Northern Ireland&quot; and popularly known as the &quot;Patten Report&quot;, which contained 175 symbolic and practical recommendations. This report led to the disbanding of the Royal Ulster Constabulary and establishment of the Police Service of Northern Ireland. He is the co-chair of International Crisis Group, overseeing many international operations. He is also a member of the Global Leadership Foundation, an organisation which works to promote good governance around the world. On 23 May 2005 he was appointed by Cadbury as a non-executive director.

=== European Commissioner: 1999–2004 ===

In 1999, he was appointed as one of the United Kingdom&#x27;s two members to the European Commission as Commissioner for External Relations where he was responsible for the Union&#x27;s development and co-operation programmes, as well as liaison with Javier Solana, the High Representative of the Common Foreign and Security Policy. He held this position within the Prodi Commission from 23 January 2000 until 22 November 2004. Patten oversaw many crises in the area of European foreign policy, most notably the failure of the European Union to come up with a common unified policy before the Iraq War in 2003. Although nominated for the post of President in the next Commission in 2004, he was unable to gain support from France and Germany.

According to information from WikiLeaks, Patten was in Moscow in April 2004 and had concluded EU–Russia ministerial consultations in Brussels. He considered that the EU had become overly dependent on Russian energy supplies, and should become more engaged with the countries of the Caucasus and Central Asia in order to diversify supplies.

Patten was the biggest proponent in the commission for Turkey&#x27;s accession to the European Union.

According to information from the US Embassy in Brussels (published by WikiLeaks in November 2010): Patten said in April 2004 that Russian President Vladimir Putin has done a good job for Russia mainly due to high world energy prices, but he had serious doubts about the man&#x27;s character. Cautioning that &quot;I&#x27;m not saying that genes are determinant,&quot; Patten then reviewed the Putin family history – grandfather part of Lenin&#x27;s special protection team; father a communist party apparatchik, and Putin himself decided at a young age to pursue a career in the KGB. &quot;He seems a completely reasonable man when discussing the Middle East or energy policy, but when the conversation shifts to Chechnya or Islamic extremism, Putin&#x27;s eyes turn to those of a killer.&quot;

=== University roles and elevation to the peerage ===

Patten was Chancellor of Newcastle University from 1999 to 2009. In 2003, he was elected Chancellor of the University of Oxford.

In 2016, in the wake of a student movement to remove the statue of Cecil Rhodes from a college in Oxford, as had happened in South Africa, Patten said that Oxford students who were not &quot;prepared to show the generosity of spirit which Nelson Mandela showed towards Rhodes and towards history... should think about being educated elsewhere&quot;.

Patten retired as chancellor of the University of Oxford on 31 July 2024, ahead of his 80th birthday and after 21 years in post. The election of his successor (The Lord Hague of Richmond), to a ten-year term, was scheduled to take place in late October and early November.

On 11 January 2005 Patten was created a life peer as &quot;Baron Patten of Barnes, of Barnes in the London Borough of Richmond&quot;.

=== Chairman of the BBC Trust: 2011–2014 ===
On the advice of the Conservative–Liberal Democrat coalition government led by Prime Minister David Cameron, Patten was appointed by the Queen-in-Council as Chairman of the BBC Trust, and he took office on 1 May 2011, in the place of Sir Michael Lyons whose contract was not renewed. During this time, Patten sat as a crossbencher.

==== BBC royal river pageant outside broadcast ====
As Chairman of the BBC Trust, Patten joined the Prince of Wales and other members of the royal family in the royal box for the Queen&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee Concert. It came, however, immediately in the wake of widespread criticism of the BBC&#x27;s live outside-broadcast coverage of the Queen&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee River Pageant on 3 June 2012, which was castigated in the press and was the subject of 1,830 formal complaints by viewers. Patten said afterwards the Royal Pageant had not been the BBC&#x27;s &quot;finest hour&quot; and admitted that &quot;The tone was wrong.&quot;

==== Resignation ====

Patten submitted his letter of resignation as BBC Trust Chairman to the Secretary of State on 6 May 2014; citing health reasons following his heart bypass surgery on 28 April. BBC Trust Vice Chairman Diane Coyle took over as Acting Chairman until the appointment of a new chairman. He returned to sit with the Conservative party in the House of Lords in September of that year.

In May 2016, Patten said that the BBC has &quot;lost some of its ambition&quot; in its coverage of science, philosophy and history, and should &quot;stretch&quot; audiences more. Patten bemoaned the fact that much of the corporation&#x27;s high-brow programming had been moved to BBC Four, the digital channel, and given low budgets that meant shows were &quot;sometimes made with glue and string&quot;. In a speech on the future of the BBC, which he said was &quot;one of this country&#x27;s greatest institutions&quot;, Patten called on ministers to respect the &quot;besieged&quot; broadcaster&#x27;s independence, and set in place measures to stop it becoming &quot;the plaything of the government of the day&quot;.

=== On China ===
In September 2020, he wrote that &quot;Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping&#x27;s dictatorship is certainly thuggish. Consider its policies in Xinjiang. Many international lawyers argue that the incarceration of over one million Muslim Uyghurs, forced sterilisation and abortion, and slave labour meet the UN definition of genocide.&quot; Patten said that Chinese company Huawei &quot;is an agent of an unpleasant Chinese state.&quot;

In May 2020, Patten said that there was a case for a multilateral mission to travel to Wuhan to investigate the origins of the COVID-19 outbreak. He argued the Chinese government had breached its obligations as a member of the World Health Organization and the 2005 International Health Regulations treaty. He also added that Britain and other countries were not against the Chinese nation or people, praising China&#x27;s medical workers who first responded to the virus, but stated &quot;It is our relationship with the dangerous and immoral Communist Party. In Wuhan the Communist party used the police to try and shut the doctors up. Totalitarian regimes always rely on secrecy and mendacity.&quot;

=== On Hong Kong ===
In the initial years after his tenure as Governor of Hong Kong ended Patten, by his own admission, chose not to directly comment on Hong Kong&#x27;s affairs but in recent years has increasingly shared his views on Hong Kong in public talks and press interviews since the handover.

During an interview with The &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; in 2013, he expressed the belief the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region would inevitably give citizens a greater say in public policy. He argued &quot;You can&#x27;t just give citizens the right to decide on economic and social policies, but on the other hand, you can&#x27;t allow them to decide who will clean up the garbage, how their children will be educated, and how the health care policy will be implemented&quot; and &quot;anyone who tries to block the development of democracy will only be spitting in the wind.&quot; He reiterated that the Sino-British Joint Declaration stipulated that Hong Kong and the United Kingdom need to maintain economic and cultural ties, emphasizing that &quot;the United Kingdom has this interest and responsibility, and we must never forget it.&quot;

On March 20, 2014, Patten gave a talk at the Hong Kong Maritime Museum co-organized by Oxford University where he expressed his views on Hong Kong Basic Law and the &quot;one country, two systems&quot; principle. He opined that the situation in Hong Kong was good but not perfect but believed that the British people could have done more for political reform before leaving Hong Kong. He emphasized that political and economic freedoms are closely linked, and that when one freedom is eroded, the other will be affected.

In July 2014, Patten criticised &quot;The Practice of the &#x27;One Country, Two Systems&#x27; Policy in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region&quot; white paper issued by the People&#x27;s Republic of China for interfering with Hong Kong&#x27;s judicial independence. In an interview with the &quot;Financial Times&quot;, he stated &quot;In a system of rule of law, judges are independent and should not be questioned for instructions or forced to abandon their views on procedural fairness and what is legal due to certain political considerations.&quot; Patten also added that the Sino-British Joint Declaration signed that year was an international agreement between China and the United Kingdom, which guaranteed that Hong Kong would remain unchanged for 50 years, including the freedoms and civil liberties enjoyed by Hong Kong people. He said that if Hong Kongers believe that the Sino-British Joint Declaration has been undermined, it is completely reasonable to express concerns to China and Britain and lodge a peaceful protest.

In a 2014 article for the &quot;Financial Times&quot;, Patten argued the British government should not stay silent on China interfering with Hong Kong&#x27;s judiciary and politics, arguing that the UK had a moral and political responsibility to speak out on the issue of universal suffrage in Hong Kong and ensure that China fulfilled its promises in the Sino-British Joint Declaration, reiterating that the agreement was international. The Chinese government had criticized Britain in harsh terms for interfering in China&#x27;s internal affairs and Hong Kong&#x27;s political reform, but Patten stressed that the UK should not fear economic consequences for speaking out against China as Britain was also obligated to ensure the Joint Declaration was respected and that China itself would suffer economic repercussions if it cut ties with the West.

While commenting on the Umbrella Revolution protests in 2014, Patten called on the SAR government to conduct real consultation on political reform issues and engage in dialogue with the protestors. He also criticized the Beijing government for reneging on its promise to allow Hong Kong autonomy. Despite condemning actions undertaken by the Chinese authorities and Hong Kong police, he expressed the view that a Chinese invasion of Hong Kong and a Tiananmen Square-style crackdown would not happen because the Chinese government is concerned about its relations with other countries and its international image.

In November 2014, Patten gave evidence to a hearing of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee on the implementation of the &quot;Sino-British Joint Declaration&quot; in Hong Kong. Patten said that the Hong Kong Police Force is one of the top police forces in the world, but they had become a basis for politics. Patten argued that Hong Kong&#x27;s problem is a serious lack of leadership and the chief executive and the SAR government have the ability to pressure and convince demonstrators to negotiate, temporarily end protest, and return to school or work. Citing words by Joshua Wong, Patten believed that young Hong Kong people are afraid of having their future stolen.

In June 2015, Chris Patten was interviewed by Hong Kong newspaper Apple Daily. He expressed the belief that even if a political reform plan is rejected, Hong Kong&#x27;s democracy will not reach a dead end and was confident that Hong Kong will one day have democracy.

In 2016, Patten expressed opposition to hypothetical Hong Kong independence, arguing such a move &quot;dilutes support for democracy&quot; and that moves towards universal suffrage in Hong Kong should not be conflated with independence.

Patten undertook a tour of Hong Kong in November 2016 where gave a public lecture at the Foreign Correspondents&#x27; Club and later spoke at a student forum organised by the University of Hong Kong. He emphasized that the cornerstone of Hong Kong&#x27;s success lies in the rule of law, which is guaranteed by the Sino-British Joint Declaration. He also addressed the Causeway Bay Books disappearances, saying he was saddened such an incident had happened in Hong Kong and asked why the international community paid so little attention. He did not directly comment on the performance of Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying, but argued Hong Kong&#x27;s Chief Executive should face Beijing on behalf of Hong Kong people, not Hong Kong people on behalf of Beijing.

In a 2017 interview with BBC&#x27;s &quot;Newsnight&quot; Patten expressed regret that many Hong Kong people do not feel that Britain has ever truly stood up for its commitments and responsibilities but also criticised the idea that Britain was &quot;kowtowing to China&quot; politically for the sake of trade. He argued that during the last ten to fifteen years of British rule in Hong Kong, more democracy should have been promoted and that if Hong Kong had more years of democratic experience, it would be more difficult for the Chinese government to reverse Hong Kong&#x27;s democratic process and all Hong Kongers would have openly noticed any democratic backsliding.

In 2020, he criticised the new Hong Kong national security law as an &quot;outrageous act&quot; and accused the Chinese Communist Party of seeking to &quot;destroy&quot; Hong Kong. He also said the British government should not see trade as a reason to avoid condemning the law and demand that China respect its end of the Joint Declaration, stating &quot;we keep on kidding ourselves that unless we do everything that China wants we will somehow miss out on great trading opportunities. It&#x27;s drivel.&quot;

In a July 2020 interview with CNBC, he referred to Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam as a &quot;lamentable and quisling figure in Hong Kong history&quot; for her handling of the political crisis in Hong Kong which led to the national security law, which Patten argued undermined Hong Kong&#x27;s independence judiciary and political freedoms.

In a 2022 interview with London-based Hong Kong YouTube channel &quot;Green Bean Media&quot; Patten expressed that he was angry and sad about the current situation in Hong Kong. He said &quot;Hong Kong should have been an extraordinary place, but we saw it destroyed by a brutal ideology and a group of traitors&quot; and described the situation as &quot;very frustrating.&quot; He also praised Hong Kong citizens who immigrated to the UK for their contributions to British life.

In March 2023, Patten was one of 47 British lawmakers to sign an open letter urging the Hong Kong authorities to release Claudia Mo on humanitarian grounds to visit her critically ill husband in hospital.

== Personal life ==
Patten married Lavender Thornton, a barrister, on 11 September 1971. They have three daughters, including the actress Alice Patten.

On 29 September 2005, he published his memoirs, &quot;Not Quite the Diplomat: Home Truths About World Affairs&quot;. In October 2009, Patten was Chief Guest at The Doon School, a boarding school in Dehradun, India, which is a member of the United Kingdom&#x27;s Headmasters&#x27; and Headmistresses&#x27; Conference.

Patten is a Catholic and oversaw Pope Benedict XVI&#x27;s visit to the United Kingdom in September 2010. In 2010, &quot;The Tablet&quot; named him as one of Britain&#x27;s most influential Catholics.

In February 2010, Patten was appointed President of Medical Aid for Palestinians, but he stepped down in June 2011.

In 2014 Pope Francis appointed Patten to head a body to advise the Vatican on media strategy and on how to handle the press, which he remained on until 2016.

== In the media ==
Patten was interviewed about the rise of Thatcherism for the 2006 BBC TV documentary series &quot;Tory! Tory! Tory!&quot;

Patten and his time in Hong Kong was the subject of the 5-part documentary series &quot;The Last Governor&quot;, which was filmed throughout his time in Hong Kong, including his arrival, key moments of his government such as the 1995 elections and his final day in office, ending as he departs Government House for the last time.

The 1996 Hong Kong parody film &quot;Bodyguards of the Last Governor&quot;, presents &#x27;Christ Pattern&#x27; as the Governor of Hong Kong. In addition to the name, Pattern appears to be based heavily on Patten, matching his appearance, political affiliation (Conservative) and family (a wife and two daughters with him in Hong Kong). His role however is minor as the film depicts him being replaced with one month to go before the handover. He is portrayed by Noel Lester Rands.

Patten is portrayed the video game &quot;Hong Kong 97&quot; as ordering Chin, an unspecified relative of Bruce Lee, to massacre the entire population of mainland China.

== Honours ==
In the 1998 New Year Honours, Patten was appointed a member of the Order of the Companions of Honour (CH). Patten was appointed Knight Companion of the Order of the Garter (KG) in April 2023 by King Charles III.

In November 2016 Patten was made a Commander of the Legion of Honour, and was presented with the insignia by Sylvie Bermann, the French ambassador to the United Kingdom, at Kensington Palace Gardens.

==Awards==
In 2003 Patten was awarded an honorary LL.D. degree from the University of Bath. In September 2005 he was elected a Distinguished Honorary Fellow of Massey College in the University of Toronto (the only person so elected except for the Chancellor of the University of Cambridge, the University of Edinburgh, and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh) as well as receiving an honorary D.S.Litt. degree from the University of Trinity College, Toronto and an honorary D.Litt. degree from the University of Ulster. In March 2009, Patten received the title Doctor honoris causa by South East European University.

<text>Jens Jeremies (born 5 March 1974) is a German former professional footballer who played as a defensive midfielder.

Best known for his tackling abilities, he played for three clubs during his professional career, most notably Bayern Munich where he won six Bundesliga titles, four DFB-Pokal trophies, and one Champions League title. He retired at the age of 32 following persistent injury problems.

Jeremies won 55 caps for Germany, representing the nation in two World Cups and two European Championships. He started in the 2002 World Cup final, which Germany lost to Brazil.

==Club career==
===Beginnings; 1860 Munich===
Born in Görlitz, East Germany, Jeremies joined the youth system of one of the most important clubs in the country, Dynamo Dresden, at the age of 12. As a professional, he appeared rarely over the course of two seasons, all the matches being played in 1994–95, his debut coming on 1 April 1995 in a 1–3 away loss against TSV 1860 München, as the team ended a four-year stay in the Bundesliga.

In 1995, Jeremies signed for 1860 Munich, helping the &quot;Lions&quot; qualify for the UEFA Cup in his second year and receiving totals of 30 yellow cards and two red during his three-year spell.

===Bayern Munich===
Jeremies moved to TSV&#x27;s city neighbours FC Bayern Munich in the summer of 1998, the club for which he would play the remainder of his career. With the Bavarians he won all of his trophies, including six leagues and three domestic cups, adding the 2000–01 edition of the UEFA Champions League to which he contributed with 12 games and three goals, including one in the 2–1 semifinal win against Real Madrid (3–1 on aggregate) – he missed the final through suspension.

After only 20 matches combined in his last two years, mainly due to constant knee problems, Jeremies retired from football at the age of 32. He appeared in 251 German top division matches during 12 seasons, scoring nine times.

==International career==
Whilst at TSV Munich, Jeremies made his debut for the Germany national team on 15 November 1997 in a friendly against South Africa, playing the full 90 minutes in a 3–0 win in Düsseldorf. He was then picked for the squad at the 1998 FIFA World Cup, appearing in three games in an eventual last-eight exit; during the competition, German entertainer Harald Schmidt reverentially called him &quot;Jens Jerenaldo&quot;.

On 31 March 1999, Jeremies scored his first and only international goal, helping to a 2–0 home win against Finland for the UEFA Euro 2000 qualifiers, which was later chosen as Goal of the Month in Germany. However, he was dropped from the national team during the buildup to the finals, after calling the Erich Ribbeck-led side &quot;pitiful&quot;.

Jeremies was reinstated for the 2002 World Cup, even captaining the team once in a friendly after the competition, but retired from international football after Germany&#x27;s group stage exit in Euro 2004 in Portugal, saying he wanted to focus on his club duties with Bayern.

<text>The Escape Club are an English pop rock band that was formed in London in 1983. They are best known for their 1988 No. 1 US hit &quot;Wild, Wild West&quot; and for their top-ten 1991 hit &quot;I&#x27;ll Be There&quot;.

==History==
The band formed in 1983, comprising Mad Shadows members lead singer/rhythm guitarist Trevor Steel and guitarist John Holliday, along with former Expressos members bassist Johnnie Christo (a.k.a. John Christoforou) and drummer Milan Zekavica. The seeds for the formation of The Escape Club were sown when Zekavica joined Steel and Holliday in Mad Shadows, who subsequently performed on an album by the obscure early 1980s Stephen Milford-fronted new wave outfit Planning by Numbers. Before long, Christo had also joined the lineup, and The Escape Club was born. The fledgling band quickly released the single &quot;Breathing&quot;.

In 1985 The Escape Club signed with EMI and recorded the album &quot;White Fields&quot;, which was released the following year. In 1987, the group moved to Atlantic Records and began recording their next album, &quot;Wild Wild West&quot;. The album was released in the summer of 1988 and spawned the single &quot;Wild, Wild West&quot;, which climbed to No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart while the song&#x27;s video received major rotation on MTV. However, it was banned from British Television for unclear reasons, reports and band members speculate it was due to the use of disembodied limbs and lingerie in a way that came off as offensive or sexist. One reviewer said of the ban and disembodied limbs, &quot;British censors would’ve been acting in the public interest. [...] It’s [a] pretty easy psychedelic trick-shot, and it’s also pure nightmare fuel. I hate looking at it.&quot;

In 1989, they released two more singles from &quot;Wild Wild West&quot;: &quot;Shake for the Sheik&quot;, which climbed to No. 28, and &quot;Walking Through Walls&quot;, which peaked at No. 81. The Escape Club&#x27;s cover single of The Doors&#x27; &quot;20th Century Fox&quot; appeared on &quot;The Wonder Years: Music From the Emmy Award-Winning Show &amp; Its Era&quot;, which also received airplay on MTV. The song was produced by Doors band member Ray Manzarek.

In 1990 the band returned to the studio to record their final album, &quot;Dollars and Sex&quot;, which saw a March 1991 release. The first single, &quot;Call It Poison&quot;, failed to crack the US Top 40. Atlantic Records then released the song &quot;I&#x27;ll Be There&quot;, which the group said was heavily influenced by the death of a friend&#x27;s wife. &quot;I&#x27;ll Be There&quot; reached No. 8 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and achieved gold status in the US. The group disbanded in 1992. The Escape Club is the only British band to have a No. 1 hit in the U.S. while not charting at all in their native UK.

The band self-released a fourth album &quot;Cloud 10&quot; in 2005.

Trevor Steel and John Holliday reunited, with new band member Red Broad, in 2009 and self-released a fifth studio album, &quot;Celebrity&quot;, in February 2012.

In 2019, Johnnie Christo returned to the line-up and the Escape Club played as a full band for the first time in 25 years during the U.S. tour Lost 80s Live.

On 16 January 2024, drummer Red Broad died, and was buried in the Netherlands. On 9 July 2024, bassist Johnnie Christo died after battling cancer for six years.

<text>Miroslav Josef &quot;Miro&quot; Klose (, ; born Mirosław Marian Klose; 9 June 1978) is a German professional football manager and former player who currently serves as head coach of 1. FC Nürnberg. A striker, Klose is the all-time top scorer for Germany and holds the record for the most goals scored in the FIFA World Cup with 16 goals scored over 4 editions of the tournament between 2002 and 2014. Klose is best known for his performances with the German national team.

Starting his career at FC 08 Homburg, Klose played in the Bundesliga for Kaiserslautern before becoming one of the most prolific scorers in the league with Werder Bremen, where he was awarded the German Footballer of the Year in 2006 and also named to the &quot;kicker&quot; Bundesliga Team of the Season in 2004–05 and 2005–06. His performances saw him move to giants Bayern Munich in 2007. During his time at Bayern, Klose won the 2007–08 and 2009–10 league titles. In 2011, Klose moved to Serie A club Lazio, where he won the 2012–13 Coppa Italia and eventually finished his playing career in 2016 after five years at the club.

He was part of the squad that won the 2014 World Cup, having previously finished second (2002) and third (2006, 2010) in the competition; he finished as runner-up with Germany at UEFA Euro 2008 and joint-third place at UEFA Euro 2012. He holds the record for the most goals scored in FIFA World Cup tournaments, having scored five goals in his debut World Cup in 2002 and having won the Golden Boot at the 2006 World Cup in Germany by again scoring five times. He also scored four times in the 2010 World Cup and twice at the 2014 World Cup, in the latter tournament overtaking Brazil&#x27;s Ronaldo&#x27;s then-record of 15 goals to top the all-time list. He retired from the national team in August 2014, shortly after Germany&#x27;s victory at the 2014 World Cup.

==Early life==
Klose was born in the Silesian city of Opole, Poland. Both of his parents were professional athletes. His father, Josef Klose, was also a professional footballer who played for Odra Opole before leaving Poland in 1978 to play for French club Auxerre. His mother, Barbara Jeż, was a member of the Poland women&#x27;s national handball team. Josef Klose belonged to a German minority in Poland, an &quot;Aussiedler&quot; whose family had remained behind when Silesia was ceded to Poland after World War II. In 1986, then eight-year-old Miroslav joined his father in Kusel, West Germany, knowing only two words of German. Klose developed his footballing skill and passion with local club SG Blaubach-Diedelkopf, which at the time was in the West-German seventh division. He was also an apprentice carpenter.

==Club career==
===Kaiserslautern===
In 1998, Klose&#x27;s professional career began at age 20 with a switch to the reserves at former Bundesliga outfit FC Homburg. Twelve months later, he moved to 1. FC Kaiserslautern. He played for the second team and made his first appearance in the Bundesliga in April 2000. He scored 16 goals in the 2001–02 season and was shy of only two goals to become the top scorer.

===Werder Bremen===
In March 2004, Klose signed a four-year contract with Werder Bremen for a €5 million ($6.2 million) transfer fee. He made his league debut on 6 August 2004 as a substitute for Paraguayan striker Nelson Valdez in a 1–0 home win against Schalke 04. On 29 August 2004, Klose scored his first goal, an equaliser, but the Bremen team lost 2–1 at home against VfL Wolfsburg.

On 7 June 2007, Klose confirmed that he would leave Werder Bremen for Bayern Munich either before the 2007–08 season or upon the expiration of his contract with the Bremen team at the end of the 2007–08 season.

===Bayern Munich===

On 26 June 2007, Bayern Munich club president Karl-Heinz Rummenigge confirmed his team had reached an agreement with Werder Bremen regarding the transfer of Klose. Klose completed his medical with Bayern on 28 June 2007 before signing a four-year contract.

Klose won the first major honours of his club career at the end of his first season with Bayern, as they won the Bundesliga and the DFB-Pokal in 2007–08. In 2010, he won the 2010 DFL-Supercup, scoring a goal in the 81st minute.

On 7 June 2011, with his contract about to expire, Klose did not reach an agreement with Bayern, thus leaving the club at the end of the 2010–11 season. He had scored one Bundesliga goal in 20 matches in his final season.

===Lazio===
====2011–12 season====

Klose signed a three-year contract with Italian Serie A club Lazio on 9 June 2011. He scored his first goal for Lazio in the 2011–12 UEFA Europa League play-offs and also assisted four other goals. Lazio won that match 6–0 and won the play-off 9–1 on aggregate against Rabotnički. On 9 September 2011, he made his Serie A debut in a 2–2 draw against Milan and scored a goal in the 12th minute, which was the first Serie A goal of the season. Despite having been at the club for only a few months, Lazio coach Edoardo Reja underlined his importance to the team. On 16 October 2011, Klose scored in the 93rd minute to win the Rome derby against Roma for Lazio, 2–1. However, the occasion was tainted by a small section of radical Lazio fans holding a sign adapted from a motto used by the Nazis. The sign read &quot;Klose mit uns&quot;, which means &quot;Klose with us&quot;. It was intended by those fans as praise for Klose; however, the Nazis used the motto &quot;God with us&quot; and the Lazio fans&#x27; sign featured the S&#x27;s in the same font as the logo of Adolf Hitler&#x27;s &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; (SS). Klose had explicitly condemned the sign, saying, &quot;[P]olitics should stay out of the stadium.&quot;

On 10 December 2011, Klose scored twice and assisted one for Lazio in an away game against Lecce, including an 87-minute goal that gave Lazio a 3–2 victory.

====2012–13 season====
On 2 September 2012, Klose scored his first Serie A goal of the season, scoring a brace in Lazio&#x27;s 3–0 home win against Palermo. On 26 September, Klose accidentally scored a goal with his hand against Napoli for Lazio, unseen by the referee. However, Klose informed the referee and asked that the goal be discounted. The referee then reversed the decision and the goal was discounted.

On 2 December, Klose scored his ninth goal of the season, securing a 2–1 victory over Parma, lifting Lazio into fourth place in Serie A. Two weeks later, on 15 December, he scored a late goal to send his side to a 1–0 victory over second-placed Internazionale, reducing the gap between the two sides in the league table to one point. On 5 May 2013, he scored five goals against Bologna before being substituted for Louis Saha in the 68th minute. It was the first time since the 1984–85 season that a player scored five goals in the same game in Serie A.

On 26 May, Klose won the Coppa Italia, beating Lazio&#x27;s city rivals Roma 1–0. It was the sixth time in Lazio&#x27;s history and the first time in the history of the tournament there was a Lazio–Roma derby in the final.

====2013–14 season====

Klose started the season by playing in the 2013 Supercoppa Italiana against Juventus, which ended in a 4–0 loss at the Stadio Olimpico. Klose started the league season by playing 83 minutes in the team&#x27;s opening league match of the season, a 2–1 home win against Udinese. He scored his first goal of the season on 31 August in a 4–1 away defeat to Juventus. He scored his second league goal of the season on 28 October during the 2–0 home victory against Cagliari.

====2014–15 season====
Klose played his first match of the Serie A season against Milan, in which Lazio was defeated 3–1. He scored three goals and set up two other goals in the first half of the season in 16 appearances in Serie A. He also scored one goal and set up another for Lazio against Bassano in the only 2014–15 Coppa Italia match he played before the winter break. They went on to win the match 7–0. In the second half of the season, he scored 10 goals and set up 5 in 18 appearances, ending the season with 13 goals and 7 assists in Serie A, along with 3 goals and 2 assists in the Coppa Italia in 6 appearances.

====2015–16 season====
On 15 May, Klose scored his final goal for Lazio from a penalty on his final appearance for the club, the final matchday of the 2015–16 Serie A season. The game ended in a 4–2 home loss to Fiorentina. With his 64th goal for Lazio, he equalled Goran Pandev as the club&#x27;s highest non-Italian goalscorer of all time, and ended his Lazio career as the club&#x27;s seventh-highest all-time goalscorer.

==International career==
Klose&#x27;s consistency as a goal-scorer in his first Bundesliga season at 1. FC Kaiserslautern earned him attention. In January 2001, then-head coach of the Poland national team, Jerzy Engel, travelled to Germany to persuade Klose to choose to represent Poland. This request was declined by Klose, who said, &quot;I have a German passport, and if things are still running this way, I have a chance to play for Rudi Völler.&quot; Klose&#x27;s hopes were justified, as he would soon score for Germany.

In an interview given to &quot;Przegląd Sportowy&quot; on 9 June 2008, Klose stated the decision to play for Germany instead of Poland was not an easy one, and if Polish officials had been faster, he would be playing for Poland. Further, he added he does not regret the choice, as with Germany he has won medals in the World Cup tournaments.

===2002 World Cup===
Klose&#x27;s international debut came on 24 March 2001 in a 2002 FIFA World Cup qualifier against Albania; in the 73rd minute, Germany head coach Rudi Völler put him in as a substitute. Two minutes from time, he headed home the winner in a 2–1 victory for Germany, and celebrated with a front-flip. Four days later, in his second match, Klose helped Germany temporarily lead their qualification group, as he came on in the 67th minute and scored in the 3–2 win against Greece in the 82nd minute, making it two crucial goals in only 33 minutes on the pitch. Two hat-tricks against Israel and Austria in friendlies prior to the upcoming World Cup were enough to establish him in Germany&#x27;s starting line-up for the tournament.

Klose came to international prominence at the 2002 World Cup in Korea–Japan with five headed goals for Germany, finishing as the joint second-highest goalscorer alongside Rivaldo. Klose also became the first player to score five headers in a FIFA World Cup, and he celebrated two of his goals with his trademark front-flip, earning him the nickname &quot;&quot;Salto&quot;-Klose&quot; (German: &quot;Salto&quot; = somersault). His goal tally included a hat-trick in Germany&#x27;s 8–0 hammering of Saudi Arabia, as well as one goal each against the Republic of Ireland and Cameroon.

===Euro 2004===

Klose participated in UEFA Euro 2004 and came on as a substitute in two matches, against Latvia and the Czech Republic, but was not completely fit, since he had just recovered from a knee injury. He was not able to score and Germany was eliminated after the first round.

===2006 World Cup===
In the opening match of the 2006 World Cup in Germany, Klose scored two close-range goals in a 4–2 win over Costa Rica, and added a similar brace in the final group game to defeat Ecuador 3–0 and make Germany the group winners.

Klose scored an 80th-minute headed equaliser against Argentina in the quarter-finals, and Germany won the resulting penalty shootout. With five goals, he finished as the top scorer of the tournament, taking home the FIFA World Cup Golden Boot.

===Euro 2008===
At Euro 2008, Klose started the opening group stage match against Poland and assisted Lukas Podolski&#x27;s two goals in a 2–0 victory. He played the remaining two group games against Croatia and Austria with no goals of his own. He finally broke his duck during the knockout stages, scoring for Germany in the quarter-final and the semi-final against Portugal and Turkey respectively. In both matches, he scored Germany&#x27;s second goal, and both games were won 3–2. However, Klose was unable to score during the final against Spain, which Germany lost 1–0.

===2010 World Cup===
Klose was selected in Germany&#x27;s final 23-man squad for the third successive World Cup campaign. On 13 June, Klose scored the second goal against Australia in their opening group match, which ended in a 4–0 victory. This goal put him level in World Cup goals with his former national team coach, Jürgen Klinsmann. However, Klose was sent off in the 37th minute of Germany&#x27;s match against Serbia for amassing his second yellow-card foul of the match, and did not play the match against Ghana because of his expulsion.

Klose opened the scoring in the round of 16 match against England on 27 June 2010 with his 12th World Cup goal, equalling Pelé for fourth on the all-time list, and also notching up his 50th international goal in his 99th international game, as Germany won the match 4–1.

Klose made his 100th international appearance in the quarter-final match against Argentina, becoming only the sixth German player to reach the landmark. He then scored the second and fourth goals against Argentina (Germany winning 4–0), pulling him level with Gerd Müller&#x27;s all-time German World Cup goalscoring record.

===Euro 2012===

During the Euro 2012 qualifiers, Klose scored at least one goal in every single game he played, striking against all of Germany&#x27;s opponents: Belgium, Azerbaijan, Turkey, Kazakhstan and Austria. Gaining only six caps during the qualification campaign, he scored nine goals and provided two assists, making him Europe&#x27;s second-most-successful striker for this period behind Klaas-Jan Huntelaar, who scored 12 times in 8 matches. At the end of the qualifying campaign, Klose had achieved 21 assists and 63 goals while playing for Germany, trailing Gerd Müller&#x27;s German goalscoring record by five (albeit playing almost twice as many internationals compared to Müller).

At the tournament, Klose came off the bench in all three of Germany&#x27;s Group B games, but failed to score a goal. In the quarter-final game against Greece, Klose started the match and scored Germany&#x27;s third goal in a 4–2 win. Klose again had to come off the bench in the semi-final against Italy, but failed to add to his goal tally as Germany were eliminated with a 2–1 loss.
===2014 World Cup and retirement===

Prior to the tournament, Klose said the 2014 World Cup would be his final one for Germany, stating he wanted one more shot at trying to win the World Cup and having done that, he was content. On 6 June 2014, in Germany&#x27;s final friendly before the World Cup against Armenia, Klose scored his 69th international goal, thus breaking Gerd Müller&#x27;s record of 68 goals and becoming Germany&#x27;s record goalscorer.

Klose scored his record-equalling 15th World Cup goal to help Germany to a 2–2 draw against Ghana on 21 June 2014, after entering the game as a 69th-minute substitute for Mario Götze (who had scored Germany&#x27;s first goal) with his team trailing 2–1. This tied him with the Brazilian player Ronaldo. With this goal, Klose became the third player in history to score in four different World Cups. On 8 July, Klose scored a record 16th World Cup goal in the 23rd minute against hosts Brazil in the semi-finals, his second goal of the 2014 World Cup. That goal gave Germany a 2–0 lead &quot;en route&quot; to a 7–1 win over Brazil, and Klose surpassed Ronaldo&#x27;s previous record of 15 World Cup goals. Klose set another record by becoming the first player to appear in four consecutive World Cup semi-finals. Klose started in the World Cup final against Argentina and played until the 88th minute, when he was substituted for Mario Götze. Götze would score the 113th-minute goal which gave Germany a 1–0 victory over Argentina, earning Germany&#x27;s fourth World Cup title overall and first as a reunited country. Klose announced his retirement from international football one month after the final.

==Managerial career==
===Youth and assistant manager===
On 1 November 2016, Klose was hired to become part of the coaching staff of the German national team. Klose said, &quot;I celebrated my greatest successes with the national team and it was a wonderful and unforgettable time. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m delighted to return to the DFB. In the past few months, I have thought a lot about continuing my playing career, but also about pursuing other avenues, namely becoming a coach.&quot;

On 11 May 2018, Bayern Munich named Klose as their coach for the U-17 team. Klose signed a two-year contract until the end of June 2020.

On 7 May 2020, Klose signed a one-year contract to become the first-team assistant manager under Hansi Flick. He left Bayern Munich in May 2021.

===Rheindorf Altach===
On 17 June 2022, it was announced that Klose would take over as head coach of Austrian Bundesliga club Rheindorf Altach. His debut on 16 July was a 3–1 win at third-tier TWL Elektra in the first round of the Austrian Cup, followed eight days later by a 2–1 loss away to TSV Hartberg on the first day of the league season. In March 2023, Altach parted ways with Klose.

===1. FC Nürnberg===
On 11 June 2024, 2. Bundesliga club 1. FC Nürnberg announced Klose as their new head coach.

==Player profile==
===Style of play===
A prolific goalscorer, Klose was a large and powerful striker who was known in particular for his ability in the air as a centre-forward, due to his strength, timing, elevation and heading accuracy, as well as his finishing ability. In his prime, he was also a quick player who was known for his turn of pace, movement, and positional sense in the penalty area, which enabled him to lose his markers and get on the end of crosses. In addition to his physical attributes, he possessed good technique and hold-up play with his back to goal, and was capable of creating space for other players, or setting-up goals for teammates in addition to scoring them himself, due to his tactical intelligence and ability to interpret the game. He was also known for his dedication and good behaviour on the pitch.

===Goal celebrations===
Earlier in his career, Klose was known for his acrobatic goalscoring celebrations, which included mid-air somersaults.

===Fair play===

Throughout his career, Klose often stood out for his fair play and honesty in addition to his skill and goalscoring as a footballer. On 30 April 2005, while playing for Werder Bremen, Klose refused to accept a penalty given against Arminia Bielefeld as he felt the decision was incorrect. He was later given a fair play award for his actions, although he had mixed feelings about the award, stating, &quot;It&#x27;s a big honour for me to receive this award, but I am also a bit irritated. For me, it was something you should always do. I would do it again – always.&quot;

At the end of September 2012, Klose scored a goal using his hand for Lazio against Napoli. He admitted this to the referee, who took back his decision to award the goal, spared Klose from a yellow card and shook his hand. Later that year, he was once again given a fair play award for his actions by the German Football Association, later commenting, &quot;The referee asked me if I had touched the ball with my hand and it was not a problem for me to answer &#x27;yes&#x27;. There are many youngsters who watch football on TV and we are role models for them.&quot; In 2016, he was given the Sport Ethics Award for his honesty at the University of Rome Tor Vergata, and subsequently added regarding the incident, &quot;Napoli? For me it was easy, it&#x27;s my character. We need to set an example, ... If I can even help out the referees, I will do so willingly.&quot;

==Personal life==
Klose and his wife Sylwia have twin sons, Luan and Noah. In a 2007 interview with &quot;Der Spiegel&quot;, he stated that at home, he and his wife speak Polish to their children, who learn German in school. In a 2003 interview, Klose said he has dual nationality. In a 2011 interview, he said he initially had a Polish passport, then accepted German citizenship at the age of 18.

Klose is a devout Roman Catholic.

<text>WNEW-FM (102.7 FM, &quot;NEW 102.7&quot;) is a hot adult contemporary-formatted radio station, licensed to New York, New York and owned by Audacy, Inc. The station&#x27;s studios are located at the Audacy facility in the Hudson Square neighborhood of Manhattan, and its transmitter is located at the Empire State Building.

WNEW-FM is best remembered for one of its previous incarnations, a progressive rock radio format that began in 1967 and lasted into the 1990s. That station became influential in the development of rock music during the 1970s and 1980s.

Between 1958 and 1986, the station shared the WNEW call sign with former sister AM station WNEW (1130 kHz) and television station WNEW-TV (channel 5), with all being owned by Metromedia. After WNEW-TV was sold to News Corporation in 1986 and the AM station was sold to Bloomberg L.P. in 1992, 102.7 FM retained the WNEW-FM call sign until it was changed in 2007; the call letters returned to 102.7 on March 15, 2016.

WNEW-FM broadcasts in the HD Radio format.

==History==
===Abortive efforts===
The 102.7 FM frequency was first assigned in the mid-1940s as WNJR-FM from Newark, New Jersey. Intended to be a simulcasting sister to WNJR (1430 AM), the FM station never made it to the air despite being granted several extensions of its construction permit. WNJR gave up and turned in the FM license to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in 1953.

In 1955 the FCC awarded a new permit for 102.7 FM to a group called Fidelity Radio Corporation, based in West Paterson, New Jersey. The station was later granted the call sign WHFI, and a year later the community of license was moved back to Newark from West Paterson. Once again, the owners failed to put the station on the air.

===WNEW-FM===
In November 1957, the WHFI construction permit was purchased by the DuMont Broadcasting Corporation, which already owned television station WABD (channel 5) and earlier in the year purchased WNEW radio. In January 1958, WHFI was renamed WNEW-FM, and DuMont completed its build-out, moving the license to New York City. The station finally came on the air on August 25, 1958, mostly simulcasting WNEW (AM) with a popular music format. DuMont Broadcasting, meanwhile, would change its corporate name twice within the next three years before settling on Metromedia in 1961.

====All-female DJ staff====
WNEW-FM&#x27;s early programming also included an automated middle-of-the-road format, followed quickly by a period (July 4, 1966, to September 1967) playing pop music with an unusual twist in its day...an all-female air staff. The lineup of disc jockeys during this stunt included actress and TV personality Peggy Cass, Alison Steele (who stayed on to become the &quot;Night Bird&quot; on the progressive rock format), Rita Sands (later with WCBS Newsradio 880), Margaret Draper, Ann Clements, Arlene Kieta, Pam McKissick, and Nell Bassett. The music was similar to that of WNEW (AM)&#x27;s MOR format. But only Bassett, Cass, Draper, Sands and Steele had broadcast experience, and not as disc jockeys. Meanwhile, the male DJs on WNEW (AM) were still very popular, so it was hard for WNEW-FM to find an audience. The all-female disc jockey lineup endured for a little more than a year, switching in September 1967 to a mixed-gender staff, before a major change the following month.

===&quot;Where Rock Lives&quot;===
====Origins and disc jockeys====

On October 30, 1967, WNEW-FM adopted a progressive rock radio format. It was not the first in New York to do so – WOR-FM preceded it – but it was the one that prospered and became famous for the format and that in turn influenced the rock listenership as well as the rock industry. The original disc jockeys were Bill &quot;Rosko&quot; Mercer, who started on October 30, 1967; Jonathan Schwartz, who made his debut on November 16, 1967; and &quot;the Professor&quot; Scott Muni, who first appeared on November 18, 1967. Alison Steele would stay on from the female staff and eventually take over the overnight shift on January 1, 1968.

The station&#x27;s disc jockeys would broadcast in ways that bore out their personalities:
* morning host Dave Herman was not afraid to mix Erik Satie or Donna Summer into the playlist;
* noontime host Pete Fornatale promoted the Beach Boys when it was not fashionable and later started his eclectic weekend &quot;Mixed Bag&quot; program;
* afternoon host Muni would use his gravelly voice to introduce largely unknown British artists on his &quot;Things from England&quot; segments;
* nighttime host Schwartz was a raconteur who would sneak in the Sinatra pop standards that he not-so-secretly liked better than rock;
* overnight host Steele would play new-age music and space rock groups in between readings of her equally spacey poetry;
* weekend host Vin Scelsa started his idiosyncratic &quot;Idiots&#x27; Delight&quot; program, which soon gained a devoted following.

Other well-known disc jockeys who worked at the station included Dennis Elsas, Carol Miller, Pete Larkin, brothers Dan Neer and Richard Neer, Dan Carlisle, Jim Monaghan, Pam Merly, Thom Morrera, Meg Griffin and John Zacherle.

====Height of influence====
WNEW-FM was among the first stations to give Bruce Springsteen significant airplay, and conducted live broadcasts of key Springsteen concerts in 1975 and 1978; Springsteen would sometimes call up the DJs during records. Later, Dave Herman featured a &quot;Bruce Juice&quot; segment each morning. John Lennon once stopped by to guest-DJ along with Dennis Elsas and appeared on-air several other times during his friend Scott Muni&#x27;s afternoon slot. Members of the Grateful Dead and other groups would hang out in the studio; Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer&#x27;s visit to Muni&#x27;s show is often credited for popularizing the group in America. In addition to music, youth-oriented comedy recordings such as from Monty Python would also be aired.

The station sponsored a benefit concert at Madison Square Garden each holiday season that drew reasonably big-name acts.

The station thrived during the late 1970s when it helped boost the transition of the punk rock/new wave movement into the mainstream. During this era, the station hosted many live broadcasts from the legendary Greenwich Village night club, The Bottom Line. Among the bands featured live from the club were The Police, Joe Jackson, Squeeze, The Records, Rachel Sweet, David Johansen, Rockpile, Mink DeVille and the Tom Robinson Band. Many of these bands were being spotlighted during their debut New York City performance.

At the same time, the station began to feel the threat of disco. They hired Gianettino and Meredith Advertising to come up with a way to communicate with the New York area. The pitch by creative director George Meredith to station manager Mel Karmazin: &quot;You can&#x27;t tell them what you want to say, which is &#x27;Disco Sucks,&#x27; but you can tell them that &#x27;Rock Lives.&#x27;&quot; That became their battle cry, and it could fairly be said that WNEW-FM earned the slogan &quot;Where Rock Lives&quot;. The station&#x27;s television commercials during these years featured the song &quot;Layla&quot; by Derek and the Dominos and was considered one of the station&#x27;s anthems.

Beginning in the mid-1970s and extending into the 1980s, WNEW fielded a successful softball team, the WNEW All-Stars, playing in and around the New York metropolitan area and competing in the New York Sports and Entertainment League. Among the All-Stars were DJs Thom Morrera, Jim Monaghan, Richard Neer, Dan Neer and Pat Dawson, along with &quot;Crawdaddy&quot; editor Peter Knobler at shortstop, music business regulars Bobby Diebold, Jack Hopke, Ed Vitale, Matt Birkbeck, Ralph Cuccurullo and John &quot;Boots&quot; Boulos in the outfield, and Michael &quot;Chopper&quot; Boulos at second base. The team consistently won deep into the playoffs, playing against teams led by Meat Loaf, among others.

On the evening of December 8, 1980, Vin Scelsa broke the news of the murder of John Lennon to the WNEW-FM audience. The station became a kind of therapy center for the rock community, playing Lennon&#x27;s music for 24 hours straight and opening up its lines for calls from grieving listeners.

In the 1980s, the station gradually adopted a more conventional album-oriented rock format, and sometimes seemed stodgy compared to college radio stations playing alternative rock. When long-time competitor WPLJ switched away from rock in 1983, WNEW-FM picked up some of its most popular DJs, such as Carol Miller, and years later, Pat St. John, who would take over the morning show and programming duties.

In 1986, following the sale of WNEW-TV and Metromedia&#x27;s other television outlets to News Corporation, the company&#x27;s radio station group was spun off from Metromedia into a new company, Metropolitan Broadcasting. Two years later, WNEW-FM was sold to Westinghouse Broadcasting, bringing it into common ownership with all-news outlet WINS. WNEW-FM and WINS became CBS-owned stations in 1996, when Westinghouse Broadcasting&#x27;s corporate parent purchased the network.

====Declining relevance and changes====
By the 1990s, the station was further losing relevance in the face of the popularity of grunge rock and so became more of a classic rock station. It spent its remaining music days flip flopping between a variety of classic, adult album and alternative rock.

On September 1, 1990, WWHB on Long Island began simulcasting WNEW-FM. The simulcast would be dropped on December 7, 1996, when WWHB flipped to country and joined a simulcast with a network of suburban stations as &quot;Y-107&quot;.

On July 7, 1995, WNEW-FM adopted an adult album alternative format. The station, which now had the slogan of &quot;New York&#x27;s Rock Alternative&quot;, evolved to an eclectic mix of adult rock by the end of 1995. Longtime listeners were alienated when Jerry Garcia&#x27;s death on August 9, 1995, was virtually ignored by the station.

In January 1996, the station declined to switch to classic rock when WXRK, also known as &quot;K-Rock&quot;, which had a classic rock format for several years, decided to adopt an alternative rock format. In July 1996, WAXQ adopted a classic rock format. In January 1997, the station reverted to a classic rock format, becoming the second choice for the format when earlier they could have been first. At this point, many long-time fans felt WNEW-FM had completely lost its focus.

Throughout the 1990s, many of WNEW-FM&#x27;s DJs defected to classic rock competitors WXRK and later WAXQ, or to smaller but more freeform WFUV. Ratings remained dismal. In 1996, Westinghouse merged with CBS. Infinity Broadcasting would then merge with CBS in 1997, and CBS retained the Infinity name for its radio division; thus, ownership of this station would go from one network owner to another.

In December 1997, sister station WFAN (then flagship station of the MetroStars) announced that WNEW-FM would be their FM flagship station after Infinity Broadcasting (now Entercom) reached a six-year extension deal (starting in the 1998 MLS season) with the MSG Network and the MetroStars to simulcast their games until the 2004 season. However, in the fall of 2004, the MetroStars and the MSG Network reached a deal with Disney-owned radio station WEPN and then-sister FM station WPLJ to broadcast their games, ending their relationship with Infinity/CBS Radio.

In 1998, WNEW-FM moved to a harder-edged active rock format and continued to slump in the ratings. The remaining older DJs left on the station departed one by one during 1998. In June of that year, ex-Boston shock jocks Opie and Anthony arrived from WAAF to do afternoons on WNEW. They played several songs an hour, but for the most part, the show was a typical shock-jock talk show. Opie and Anthony immediately got attention from the station by interrupting their annual &quot;Evolution of Rock and Roll&quot; event by refusing to play the music, or destroying the CDs. They were confronted by WNEW peer Carol Miller a few times on the air, until they were forbidden by management to make eye contact.

With Opie and Anthony&#x27;s ratings soaring, Infinity announced in June 1999 that the station would drop its 32-year rock format for a &quot;hot talk&quot; format in September. On September 12, 1999, sole remaining long-time jock Richard Neer signed off his Sunday morning show by playing Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s dirge-like &quot;Racing in the Street&quot;, and identifying the station one last time, changing the slogan to &quot;Where Rock Lived&quot;. The day after, on September 13, in the run-up to 3 pm, the rock format ended with an all-request midday show by Ralph Tortora (which featured a phone call from Billy Joel, who talked about the impact WNEW had on his life), which concluded with &quot;Thank You&quot; by Led Zeppelin, &quot;Better Things&quot; by The Kinks and &quot;The End&quot; by The Beatles, followed by the famous final chord of their song &quot;A Day in the Life&quot;.

===&quot;Hot talk&quot; era===

After a commercial break, the new hot talk format officially began as &quot;FM Talk @ 102.7, Talk You Can&#x27;t Ignore&quot;. Opie and Anthony signed on the talk format by saying that WNEW did not die that day or that week, but that &quot;it died years ago&quot;, saying that WNEW&#x27;s death had been &quot;the longest funeral ever&quot;, and inaugurated &quot;FM Talk&quot; by holding an on-air funeral for the old rock format, complete with a coffin, hearse, and a fat lady singing &quot;Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye&quot;.

The new format consisted of shock jocks, including Opie and Anthony, Don and Mike, The Radio Chick, Ron and Fez and Tom Leykis. Mornings featured &quot;guy talk&quot; from &quot;Mason &amp; Kalinsky&quot;, who would be replaced by morning programming that revolved around sports, such as &quot;The Sports Guys&quot; and &quot;Ferrall in the Morning&quot; hosted by Scott Ferrall, while overnight programming featured syndicated programs such as &quot;Loveline&quot; and repeats of weekday programming. On weekends, the station retained a hard rock music format with live announcers, including Tony Pigg and Tom Rich, both of whom were held over from prior to the introduction of the hot talk format. In 2000, Viacom acquired CBS/Infinity Broadcasting, keeping the radio division under the &quot;Infinity&quot; banner. By 2002, WNEW added brokered programming on weekends and stopped playing music altogether, with the exception of Eddie Trunk&#x27;s Friday and Saturday night hard rock-oriented shows, as well as Vin Scelsa&#x27;s &quot;Idiot&#x27;s Delight&quot;.

On September 11, 2001, Opie and Anthony did their show live from the WLIR studios because of the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center, which caused city officials to block all roads going into Manhattan. &quot;The Don and Mike Show&quot; started a little earlier than usual, and stayed on for most of the morning and mid-afternoon. &quot;Ron and Fez&quot; did their show at WNEW at the regular time. All three shows opened the airways and let the listeners speak their minds and let other listeners who were looking for loved ones search for them by descriptions.

During this time, the station&#x27;s ratings were abysmal apart from Opie and Anthony. A harbinger for the &quot;hot talk&quot; format&#x27;s end came in August 2002, when Opie and Anthony were fired for encouraging a stunt involving two people allegedly engaging in sexual intercourse in a vestibule within St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral. The FCC eventually fined Infinity $357,000—the maximum fine allowed by law, and the third largest indecency fine in American radio history at the time. FCC Commissioner Michael Copps dissented, claiming the FCC should have taken steps to revoke WNEW&#x27;s license. A few months earlier, the FCC had fined Infinity $21,000 for three &quot;patently offensive&quot; Opie and Anthony broadcasts, including one referring to incest.

The station&#x27;s ratings plummeted even further—in the fall of 2002, it only netted a 0.7 rating, an unprecedented level for a major-market FM station, and lower than ratings for noncommercial stations. With the cancellation of the only show that generated any ratings for the station, management decided that the station needed to take a new direction.

===&quot;Blink 102.7&quot;===

On January 27, 2003, at 1am, WNEW officially dropped the talk format. For the next three months, the station stunted with CHR music, using a limited playlist of approximately 50 songs from artists like Pink, Eminem, Bowling for Soup, and Avril Lavigne, as well as nightly simulcasts of CBS&#x27;s &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;.

Sounders during that period teased listeners about how &quot;a new station&quot; would soon be coming to the 102.7 frequency, and it arrived at 8 p.m. on April 10, when WNEW became &quot;Blink 102.7&quot; and adopted an unusual &quot;Entertainment AC&quot; format, launching with &quot;Rock Your Body&quot; by Justin Timberlake. The station mixed old and contemporary pop hits with talk shows and entertainment news from sources such as E!; on-air personalities during this period included the morning team of Chris Booker and Lynda Lopez (who were also dating during this time), game show host Todd Newton and afternoons with Tim Virgin and Alison Stewart. Other personalities included Rick Stacy, Michael Maze and reporters Matt Wolfe and Lisa Chase, providing hourly entertainment updates. The station also used AOL Instant Messenger to take requests, and &quot;24&quot; star Kiefer Sutherland was the station&#x27;s voice.
However, the station&#x27;s ratings sank further. The station&#x27;s pink logo led to the derisive nickname &quot;Barbie Radio&quot;, and Booker &amp; Lopez did little more on the air than talk about Jennifer Lopez, Lynda&#x27;s older sister. On September 12, the station fired most of the staff, rebranded as &quot;102.7 Blink FM: Music Women Love&quot;, and adopted a more mainstream adult contemporary format, with ratings going up slightly. That November, the station (like many AC stations) adopted the increasingly popular &quot;all Christmas music, all the time&quot; format, and dropped the &quot;Blink&quot; format after less than 7 months for the name &quot;New York&#x27;s New 102.7 FM&quot;.

===&quot;Mix 102.7&quot;===

On December 26, 2003, at 10:27 am, the station became &quot;Mix 102.7&quot;, making the switch to a more rhythmic-leaning adult contemporary format, playing a range of upbeat, danceable hits from the 1970s to the 2000s, with the slogan &quot;The Station That Picks You Up and Makes You Feel Good&quot;. The first song on &quot;Mix&quot; was &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Stoppin&#x27; Us Now&quot; by McFadden &amp; Whitehead. The original program director was Smokey Rivers, and the music director was Rick Martini. WNEW initially was a mainstream AC, but began to focus on dance hits, mainly from the 1970s and 1980s, by the end of January. In the succeeding months, the &quot;mix&quot; tended to skew towards 1990s and current dance hits (during this time, program director Frankie Blue was fired for drunken on-air behavior, not only saying &quot;fuck&quot; on-air, but also misidentifying the station as rival &quot;103.5 KTU&quot;), with this all culminating in a change with Rick Martini as the new program director and an official &quot;classic dance&quot; or rhythmic AC format in early 2005 under the slogan &quot;Move to the Mix&quot;, and in the later months, adopted the &quot;New York&#x27;s Classic Dance Mix&quot; slogan. However, the &quot;Mix 102.7&quot; moniker and the WNEW call letters remained. Ratings continued to be among the lowest of any major station in New York City.

On December 31, 2005, the station underwent another ownership change after Viacom and CBS Corporation organized a split that saw the Infinity Broadcasting division go under CBS ownership, which resulted in a corporate name change to CBS Radio.

In December 2006, the station began increasing the amount of Christmas music, and at the same time, Michelle Visage was let go and Joe Causi was relegated to his Sunday night Studio 54 classic Disco program. As of December 22, 2006, Paco Lopez, Efren Sifuentes, Carol Ford and Yvonne Velázquez had also been released in anticipation of an expected format change.

In 2006, WNEW launched WNEW-HD2, an HD Radio channel, broadcasting 1010 WINS.

===&quot;Fresh 102.7&quot;===

On January 2, 2007, at 5am, after playing Kool and the Gang&#x27;s &quot;Fresh&quot;, WNEW flipped to an adult contemporary format known as &quot;Fresh 102.7&quot;, with &quot;How to Save a Life&quot; by The Fray being the first song played. Program director Rick Martini remained in charge of programming the new format, targeted to a younger (age 25–44) female audience, with claims of a playlist &quot;without the kid stuff or tired, old and boring music like the lite station&quot; (though the former is no longer mentioned), an obvious shot at competitor WLTW (in response, the station briefly dropped its &quot;Lite FM&quot; moniker and was referred to on-air as simply &quot;106.7&quot; during that time). The station would also compete against WPLJ. Around 2009, the station began to add more 1980s hits (most of which could not be played on its classic hits sister station WCBS-FM).

The WWFS calls were approved on January 9, 2007, by the Federal Communications Commission, resulting in the WNEW calls disappearing from the New York radio/television spectrum after being used continuously in the market since 1934. The WNEW call letters were transferred to a CBS-owned station in West Palm Beach, Florida during the second week of January 2007, reportedly to keep another New York station from claiming the historic call. In December 2011, CBS again transferred the WNEW call letters to 99.1 FM in Washington, D.C. as it began an all-news format.

Until the launch of WWFS, WLTW had gone unchallenged as the only adult contemporary station in New York City (along with rimshots New Brunswick, New Jersey&#x27;s WMGQ, and Hempstead, New York&#x27;s WKJY), and was the most listened to station in the city for years. WWFS&#x27;s ratings improved after switching to the adult contemporary format, with increases in both the Winter 2007 and Spring 2007 ratings periods. After a peak 3.1 rating in the Spring 2007 period, WWFS settled down to a 2.5 rating in the Summer 2007 period. Some speculate that WWFS has drawn listeners from WLTW, causing that station&#x27;s ratings to decline.

As a result of the station&#x27;s success, CBS Radio cloned the format and branding in Chicago on WCFS-FM, Washington, D.C.&#x27;s WIAD, and KEZK in St. Louis, although the Washington station was hot AC.

On October 12, 2011, the station dropped the &quot;Today&#x27;s Fresh Music&quot; slogan and shifted to hot AC while also adopting the &quot;Fresh Music...Better Variety&quot; slogan. (However, CBS Radio still reported the station as an AC.) WWFS did not switch to all-Christmas music on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day, 2011, as main rival WPLJ aired Christmas music during those days.
After the flip to hot AC, ratings improved for a time, surpassing WPLJ by having a 3.9 share over WPLJ&#x27;s 2.7 in December 2011. By June 2015, with ratings down again, they started adding more adult-targeting alternative music to their playlist and saw an increase in the ratings from 2.4 in June 2015 to 3.5 in July 2015.

On March 15, 2016, the station reverted to the WNEW-FM callsign, as the previous station to hold the calls changed theirs to WDCH-FM at the same time.

On February 2, 2017, CBS Radio announced it would merge with Entercom. The merger was approved on November 9, 2017, and was consummated on the 17th.

===The All &quot;NEW&quot; 102.7===
On the afternoon of July 13, 2018, WNEW began running jockless and airing liners between songs taking swipes at WLTW and promoting something &quot;NEW&quot; to come the following Monday, July 16; at 6 a.m. that day, WNEW-FM relaunched as &quot;The All NEW 102.7&quot;, with &quot;Send My Love (To Your New Lover)&quot; by Adele as the first song played under the &quot;NEW&quot; brand, with the intention of taking direct aim at WLTW. WNEW had ranked 16th in the New York market in the June 2018 Nielsen Audio ratings with a 2.4 share, while WLTW led the market with a 7.3 share. Despite the rebranding, the station remained a hot AC station, with a playlist featuring current and recurrent hits from artists like Ed Sheeran, Taylor Swift, Fifth Harmony and Imagine Dragons, mixed with songs from as far back as the 1990s from artists like Jennifer Lopez and Aerosmith.

WNEW-FM became the only hot AC station in New York City in May 2019, when WPLJ signed off and became the east coast flagship station for the K-Love Contemporary Christian music network, after Cumulus Media sold the station to Educational Media Foundation in February 2019. Since then, WNEW-FM&#x27;s ratings have been rising; a 3.3 share in the June 2019 ratings for ages 6+, 3.8 in September 2019, and then a 4.1 in December 2019 (ahead of WKTU, who had a 3.4 in December 2019).

==HD radio operations==

In April 2003, WNEW-FM launched the &quot;Blink&quot; format, describing itself as &quot;The first FM station in New York to broadcast in high definition radio.&quot;

WNEW-HD2 was launched in 2006 as a simulcast of all-news sister station 1010 WINS. On April 12, 2008, WNEW-HD2 (as WWFS-HD2) flipped to a rock format, under the branding of &quot;102.7 WNEW&quot; and the slogan &quot;Where Rock Lives&quot;. In early October 2008, the WINS simulcast returned to 102.7 on WWFS-HD3. After WINS began simulcasting full-time on 92.3 FM (formerly WNYL) on October 27, 2022, the WINS simulcast would be dropped from the HD3 channel, which was removed entirely.

In 2009, the rock format on WWFS-HD2 switched to an alternative format from internet radio website last.fm known as &quot;Last FM Discover&quot;, which aired on several CBS Radio owned HD subchannels.

In November 2012, WWFS-HD2 flipped to an all-Christmas format. The Christmas format continued into January and early February. On February 7, 2013, the all-Christmas format changed to a mainstream smooth jazz format under the name &quot;Smooth Jazz 102.7&quot;. The smooth jazz format was discontinued in February 2023, resulting in only an HD1 frequency available.

In 2016, WNEW-HD4 (as WWFS-HD4) signed on with a Russian language format as &quot;Russkaya Reklama&quot;. In late 2017, this moved to WPLJ&#x27;s HD2 sub-channel, where it remained until that station became a K-Love affiliate on May 31, 2019.

In 2024, WNEW-HD2 returned to the air with Channel Q, which moved from WINS-FM&#x27;s HD3 channel. in 2024 WNEW-FM HD3 returned on the air as talklinenetwork.com

<text>A mortise and tenon (occasionally mortice and tenon) joint connects two pieces of wood or other material. Woodworkers around the world have used it for thousands of years to join pieces of wood, mainly when the adjoining pieces connect at right angles.

Mortise and tenon joints are strong and stable joints that can be used in many projects. They connect by either gluing or friction-fitting into place. The mortise and tenon joint also gives an attractive look. One drawback to this joint is the difficulty in making it because of the precise measuring and tight cutting required. In its most basic form, a mortise and tenon joint is both simple and strong. There are many variations of this type of joint, and the basic mortise and tenon has two components: 
#the mortise hole, and
#the tenon tongue.

The tenon, formed on the end of a member generally referred to as a rail, fits into a square or rectangular hole cut into the other, corresponding member. The tenon is cut to fit the mortise hole exactly. It usually has shoulders that seat when the joint fully enters the mortise hole. The joint may be glued, pinned, or wedged to lock it in place.

This joint is also used with other materials. For example, it is traditionally used by both stonemasons and blacksmiths.

==Etymology==
The noun &quot;mortise&quot;, &quot;a hole or groove in which something is fitted to form a joint&quot;, comes from from Old French (13th century), possibly from Arabic , &quot;fastened&quot;, past participle of , &quot;cut a mortise in&quot;. The word &quot;tenon&quot;, a noun in English since the late 14th century, developed its sense of &quot;a projection inserted to make a joint&quot; from the Old French &quot;to hold&quot;.

== History and ancient examples ==

The mortise and tenon joint is an ancient joint. One of the earliest mortise-tenon structure examples dates back 7,000 years to the Hemudu culture in China&#x27;s Zhejiang Province. Tusked joints were found in a well near Leipzig, created by early Neolithic Linear Pottery culture, and used in construction of the wooden lining of the wells. Mortise and tenon joints have also been found joining the wooden planks of the &quot;Khufu ship&quot;, a long vessel sealed into a pit in the Giza pyramid complex of the Fourth Dynasty around 2500 BC. They were also found in the Uluburun shipwreck (14th century BC). 

Mortise and tenon joints have also been found in ancient furniture from archaeological sites in the Middle East, Europe and Asia. Many instances are found, for example, in ruins of houses in the Silk Road kingdom of Cadota, dating from the first to the 4th century BC. In traditional Chinese architecture, wood components such as beams, brackets, roof frames, and struts were made to interlock with perfect fit, without using fasteners or glues, enabling the wood to expand and contract according to humidity. Archaeological evidence from Chinese sites shows that, by the end of the Neolithic, mortise and tenon joinery was employed in Chinese construction.

The thirty sarsen stones of Stonehenge were dressed and fashioned with mortise and tenon joints before they were erected between 2600 and 2400 BC.

A variation of the mortise and tenon technique, called Phoenician joints (from the Latin ) was extensively used in ancient shipbuilding to assemble hull planks and other watercraft components together. It is a locked (pegged) mortise and tenon technique that consists of cutting two mortises into the edges of two planks; a separate rectangular tenon is then inserted in the two mortises. The assembly is then locked in place by driving a dowel through one or more holes drilled through mortise side wall and tenon.

== Description ==
Generally, the size of the mortise and tenon is related to the thickness of the timbers. It is good practice to proportion the tenon as one third the thickness of the rail, or as close to this as is practical. The haunch, the cut-away part of a sash corner joint that prevents the tenon coming loose, is one third the length of the tenon and one-sixth of the width of the tenon in its depth. The remaining two-thirds of the rail, the tenon shoulders, help to counteract lateral forces that might tweak the tenon from the mortise, contributing to its strength. These also serve to hide imperfections in the opening of the mortise.

=== Types ===
==== Mortises ====
A mortise is a hole cut into a timber to receive a tenon. There are several kinds of mortise:

* Open mortise: a mortise that has only three sides. (See bridle joint).
* Stub mortise: a shallow mortise, the depth of which depends on the size of the timber; also a mortise that does not go through the workpiece (as opposed to a &quot;through mortise&quot;).
* Through mortise: a mortise that passes entirely through a piece.
* Wedged half-dovetail: a mortise in which the back is wider, or taller, than the front, or opening. The space for the wedge initially leaves room to insert the tenon. The wedge, after the tenon is engaged, prevents its withdrawal. 
* Through-wedged half-dovetail: a wedged half-dovetail mortise that passes entirely through the piece.

==== Tenons ====

A tenon is a projection on the end of a timber for insertion into a mortise. Usually, the tenon is taller than it is wide. There are several kinds of tenons:

* Stub tenon: a short tenon, the depth of which depends on the size of the timber; also a tenon that is shorter than the width of the mortised piece so the tenon does not show (as opposed to a &quot;through tenon&quot;).
* Through tenon: a tenon that passes entirely through the piece of wood it is inserted into, being clearly visible on the rear side.
* Loose tenon: a tenon that is a separate part of the joint, as opposed to a fixed tenon that is an integral part of one of the pieces to be joined.
* Biscuit tenon: a thin oval piece of wood, shaped like a biscuit
* Pegged (or pinned) tenon: the joint is strengthened by driving a peg or dowel pin (treenail) through one or more holes drilled through the mortise side wall and tenon; this is common in timber framing joints.
* Tusk tenon: a kind of mortise and tenon joint that uses a wedge-shaped key to hold the joint together.
* Teasel (or teazle) tenon: a term used for the tenon on top of a jowled or gunstock post, which is typically received by the mortise in the underside of a tie beam. A common element of the English tying joint.
* Top tenon: the tenon that occurs on top of a post.
* Hammer-headed tenon: a method of forming a tenon joint when the shoulders cannot be tightened with a clamp.
* Half shoulder tenon: an asymmetric tenon with a shoulder on one side only. A common use is in framed, ledged, and braced doors.

<doc id="201853" wikidata="Q466511" url="?curid=201853" title="Engine displacement">
<text>Engine displacement is the measure of the cylinder volume swept by all of the pistons of a piston engine, excluding the combustion chambers. It is commonly used as an expression of an engine&#x27;s size, and by extension as an indicator of the power (through mean effective pressure and rotational speed) an engine might be capable of producing and the amount of fuel it should be expected to consume. For this reason displacement is one of the measures often used in advertising, as well as regulating, motor vehicles.

It is usually expressed using the metric units of cubic centimetres (cc or cm3, equivalent to millilitres) or litres (l or L), orparticularly in the United States cubic inches (CID, cu in, or in3).

==Definition==
The overall displacement for a typical reciprocating piston engine is calculated by multiplying together three values; the distance travelled by the piston (the stroke length), the circular area of the cylinder, and the number of cylinders in the whole engine.

The formula is:

:formula_1

Using this formula for non-typical types of engine, such as the Wankel design and the oval-piston type used in Honda NR motorcycles, can sometimes yield misleading results when attempting to compare engines. Manufacturers and regulators may develop and use specialised formulae to determine a comparative nominal displacement for variant engine types.

==Governmental regulations==

In several countries fees and taxes levied on road vehicles by transport authorities are scaled in proportion to engine displacement. In countries where this is practised, vehicle manufacturers often seek to increase power output through higher-revving engines or turbocharging, instead of increasing the displacement.

Examples of countries where the road taxes are based upon engine displacement:
* In some European countries, and which predates the EU, there is one charge for engines over 1.0 litre, and another at the level of about 1.6 litres.
* In the United Kingdom, cars registered after 1 March 2001 are taxed based on the exhaust emissions. However, cars registered before this date are taxed based on engine displacement. Cars under 1549 cm3 qualify for a lower tax rate.
* In Japan, the engine displacement is one of the factors (along with overall vehicle size and power output) used to determine the vehicle size class and therefore the cost of road tax for the vehicle.
* In France and some other EU countries, mopeds with a displacement of less than can be driven with minimum qualifications. This led to all light motorbikes having a displacement of about 49.9 cm3.
* In many areas of the United States, Canada (except Quebec), Australia and New Zealand, the road taxes are not based on engine displacement. However, the engine displacement is often used in low-powered scooters or mopeds to determine whether a licence is required to operate the vehicle. A common threshold is .

Wankel engines are able to produce higher power levels for a given displacement. Therefore, they are generally taxed as 1.5 times their stated physical displacement (1.3 litres becomes effectively 2.0, 2.0 becomes effectively 3.0), although actual power outputs can be higher than suggested by this conversion factor. The nominal displacement of a Wankel engine is 3 times smaller than the physical displacement, but this is compensated by the fact that the shaft has 3 times the rotational speed of the rotor. The nominal displacement is the swept volume of a single chamber.

== Automotive model names ==
Historically, many car model names have included their engine displacement. Examples include the 1923–1930 Cadillac Series 353 (powered by a 353 Cubic inch/5.8-litre engine), and the 1963–1968 BMW 1800 (a 1.8-litre engine) and Lexus LS 400 with a 3,968 cc engine. This was especially common in US muscle cars, like the Ford Mustang Boss 302 and 429, and later GT 5.0L, The Plymouth Roadrunner 383, and the Chevrolet Chevelle SS 396 and 454.

However, trends towards downsizing and hybrid/electric drivetrains since 2010 have resulted in far fewer model names being based on the engine displacement.

<doc id="201856" wikidata="Q181878" url="?curid=201856" title="Rani of Jhansi">
<text>The Rani of Jhansi, also known as Rani Lakshmibai (; born Manikarnika Tambe; 19 November 1828 — 18 June 1858) was the Maharani consort of the princely state of Jhansi in the Maratha Empire from 1843 to 1853 by marriage to Maharaja Gangadhar Rao Newalkar. She was one of the leading figures in the Indian Rebellion of 1857, who became a national hero and symbol of resistance to the British rule in India for Indian nationalists.

Born into a Marathi Karhade Brahmin family in Banares, Lakshmibai married the Maharaja of Jhansi, Gangadhar Rao, in 1842. When the Maharaja died in 1853, the British East India Company under Governor-General Lord Dalhousie refused to recognize the claim of his adopted heir and annexed Jhansi under the Doctrine of Lapse. The Rani was unwilling to cede control and joined the rebellion against the British in 1857. She led the successful defense of Jhansi against Company allies, but in early 1858 Jhansi fell to British forces under the command of Hugh Rose. The Rani managed to escape on horseback and joined the rebels in capturing Gwalior, where they proclaimed Nana Saheb as Peshwa of the revived Maratha Empire. She died in June 1858 after being mortally wounded during the British counterattack at Gwalior.

==Biography==

Little is known for certain about the Rani&#x27;s life before 1857, because there was then no need to record details about an as-yet ordinary young girl. As a result, every biography of her life relies on a mixture of factual evidence and legendary tales, especially when concerning her childhood and adolescence.

===Early life and marriage===
Moropant Tambe was a Maharashtrian Karhada Brahmin who served the Maratha noble Chimaji, whose brother Baji Rao II had been deposed as Maratha peshwa in 1817. In the city of Varanasi, he and his wife Bhagirathi had a daughter, who they named Manakarnika, an epithet of the River Ganges; in childhood she was known by the diminutive Manu. Her birth year is disputed: British sources tended towards the year 1827, whereas Indian sources generally preferred the year 1835. According to legend, the astrologers attending her birth foretold that she would combine the qualities of the three principle Hindu goddesses: Lakshmi, deity of wealth; Durga, deity of strength; and Saraswati, deity of knowledge.

Both Manakarnika&#x27;s mother Bhagirathi and her father&#x27;s employer Chimaji died when she was a young child. Moropant moved to the court of Baji Rao at Bithur, who gave him a job and who became fond of Manakarnika, whom he nicknamed &quot;Chhabili&quot;. According to uncorroborated popular legend, her childhood playmates in Bithur included Nana Sahib and Tatya Tope, who would similarly become prominent in 1857. These stories relate that Manakarnika, deprived of a feminine influence by her mother&#x27;s death, was allowed to play and learn with her male playmates: she was literate, skilled in horseriding, and—extremely unusually for a girl, if true—was given lessons in fencing, swordplay, and even firearms.

It is presumed that Baji Rao brought Manakarnika to the attention of Gangadhar Rao, the old raja of Jhansi who had no children and greatly desired an heir. The ambitious Moropant accepted the unexpectedly prestigious marriage offer, and the couple wed, according to Indian sources, in May 1842. If the traditional chronology is correct, Manakarnika would have been seven years old, and the marriage would not have been consummated until she was fourteen. Accorded the name Lakshmi, after the goddess, she was thereafter known as the Rani Lakshmibhai. Both Indian and British sources portray Gangadhar Rao as an apolitical figure uninterested in rulership—thus increasing the scope for depicting the Rani&#x27;s leadership abilities—but while British sources characterise him as debauched and imbecilic, Indian sources interpret these traits as evidence of his cultured nature. According to popular legend, he turned blind eye to Rani Lakshmibhai&#x27;s equipping and training of an armed all-female regiment, but if it existed, it was likely formed after Gangadhar Rao&#x27;s death.
In 1851, Lakshmibhai gave birth to a son amid much rejoicing, but he died at a few months old to the great grief of his parents. Gangadhar Rao&#x27;s health deteriorated and he died two years later on 21 November 1853. As was customary, he adopted a young boy on his deathbed—in this case, a five-year-old relative named Anand Rao, who was renamed Damodar Rao. Two days before his death, Gangadhar Rao wrote a letter to East India Company officials, pleading them to recognise Damodar Rao as the new ruler and the Rani Lakshmibhai as his regent.

===Widowhood and annexation===
The East India Company administration, led by Governor-General Lord Dalhousie, had for several years enforced a &quot;doctrine of lapse&quot;, wherein Indian states whose Hindu rulers died without a natural heir were annexed by Britain. This policy was quickly enforced on Jhansi after Gangadhar Rao&#x27;s death, to the Rani&#x27;s dismay. She wrote a letter to the Company protesting the annexation on 16 February 1854. Dalhousie issued a lengthy minute in response eleven days later. He argued that since the British had conquered the Marathas, Jhansi&#x27;s former overlords, the Company was now the &quot;paramount power&quot; with the authority to decide the succession. Dalhousie characterised Gangadhar Rao&#x27;s rule as one of decline and mismanagement, and asserted that Jhansi and its people would benefit from direct British rule.

Lakshmibhai fought the decision through diplomatic channels. She initiated coversations with Major Ellis, a sympathetic local Company official, and engaged John Lang, an Australian lawyer, to represent her. She wrote multiple appeals to Dalhousie, outlining previous British treaties with Jhansi in 1803, 1817, and 1842 which recognised the rajas of Jhansi as legitimate rulers. She also cited specific terminology and Hindu &quot;shastra&quot; tradition to argue that Damodar Rao should be entitled to the throne. Dalhousie bluntly rejected these appeals without refuting the arguments contained within, but still the Rani peristed: her final appeals concluded that the annexation constituted a &quot;gross violation ... of treaties&quot; and that Jhansi was reduced to &quot;subjection, dishonour, and poverty&quot;.

None of these appeals came to fruition, and Jhansi lapsed to the Company in May 1854. Granted a lifetime pension of five thousand rupees per month (or six thousand pounds yearly) by the new Company superintendent of Jhansi, Captain Alexander Skene, Lakshmibhai was required to vacate the fort but allowed to keep the two-storey palace. She disagreed with the Company in the following years over various matters: on taxation and debts, the 1854 lifting of the ban on cattle slaughter in Jhansi, the British occupation of a temple outside the town, and of course the continued foreign rule. 

Later songs and poems retell Lakshmibhai&#x27;s defiant mantra, &quot;I will never give up my Jhansi!&quot;, which she is traditionally said to have cried during this period. She continued to train her all-female regiment, and paraded them on horseback through the town.

===1857 Indian Rebellion===

On 10 May 1857, native sepoy troops stationed in Meerut mutinied against their British officers, sparking the Indian Rebellion. The nascent rebellion swiftly grew as towns and troops across northern India, including Delhi, joined in. Nana Sahib organised massacres of the British at Kanpur, while similar events occurred in Lucknow; news of these killings had not reached Jhansi by the end of May. The garrison, commanded by Skene, consisted of native troops of the 12th Native Infantry and the 14th Irregular Cavalry, and oversaw a strategic position at the junction of four major roads: northwest to Agra and Delhi, northeast to Kanpur and Lucknow, east to Allahabad, and south across the Deccan Plateau.

Skene was not initially alarmed, and allowed the Rani to raise a bodyguard for her own protection. However, on 5 June, a company of infantry took control of the ammunition store, and shot their British commanding officer when he attempted to reassert control the next day. The remaining sixty British men, women, and children took refuge in the main fort, where they were besieged. According to a servant of a British captain, the Rani sent a letter claiming that the sepoys, accusing her of protecting the British, had surrounded her palace and demanded she provide assistance. On 8 June, the British surrendered and asked for safe passage; after an unknown someone acquiesced, they were led to the Jokhan Bagh garden, where nearly all of them were killed.

The Rani&#x27;s involvement in this massacre is a subject of debate. S. Thornton, a tax collector in Samthar State, wrote that the Rani had instigated the revolt, while two somewhat questionable eyewitness accounts reported that she executed three British messengers and gave the rest false promise of safe passage. Other contemporary reports claimed the Rani was innocent, while the official report by F.W. Pinkney came to no clear conclusion. Lakshmibai herself claimed, in two mid-June letters to Major Erskine, commissioner of the Saugor division, that she had been at the mercy of the mutineers and could not help the besieged British. She wished damnation upon the mutineers, asserted that she was governing only while Company rule was absent, and asked for government assistance to combat prevalent disorder. Erskine believed her account, but his superiors in Fort William were less trusting. Even if the Rani was not involved with the mutiny, its outcome had spectacularly coincided with her prior aims.
After the rebels left, Erskine authorised the Rani to rule until the British returned. In this capacity, she collected taxes, repaired the fort, and distributed donations to the poor. One of her generals named Jawahar Singh defeated Sadasheo Rao, a cousin of Gangadhar Rao, who tried to claim Jhansi for himself. This skirmish led the Rani to focus on re-establishing military authority, and so she ordered the recruitment of troops and the manufacturing of cannon and other weapons. With this larger force of approximately 15,000 troops, Jhansi saw off an attack by nearby Orchha, who had remained loyal to the Company and whose leaders judged that the British would turn a blind eye to the war. Orchha invaded on 10 August and besieged Jhansi from early September to late October, when they were driven off by the raja of Banpur&#x27;s troops.

===Conflict with the British===
In September 1857, with Jhansi under Orchha siege, the Rani requested that Major Erskine send forces to help, as he had earlier promised when authorizing her rule. On 19 October, he replied in the negative, and further added that the conduct of all at Jhansi would be investigated. Even though she feared the British regarded her as an enemy, the Rani was not yet ready to take the rebels&#x27; side, although she was dismayed by the British failures to reply. Unable to persuade the Rani to commit to the rebellion, the raja of Banpur left Jhansi in January 1858. Some of her advisors advocated for peace with the Britis; others, including her father, for war. Remaining rebel leaders had begun to gather at Jhansi, including the raja of Banpur, who returned with 3,500 men on 15 March. This encouraged the Rani, who was still of two minds: she continued to send unanswered conciliations to the British, while at the same time militantly preparing arms and ammunition. Her position may have eventually been decided by her troops, who demanded to fight.

Because of her conflict with the Company-loyal state of Orchha and her rescue by the rebel raja of Banpur, the British had likely decided that the Rani was an enemy. Kanpur had been retaken on 16 July, followed by Lucknow and, on 22 September Delhi. Their attention now fell on the remaining pockets of resistance in Central India: Jhansi, a pivotal strategic location and the home of a ruler now seen as a &quot;Jezebel&quot;, was a prime target. Command of the Central India Field Force of 4,300 men was given to the capable Hugh Rose, who set out from Indore on 6 January 1858. He relieved Sagar on 3 February, defeated the army of Shahgarh and sacked Banpur in early March, and then marched on Jhansi.
Rose&#x27;s army, by now numbering around 3,000 men, approached Jhansi from several directions. Reconnaissance found that not only were the defences in excellent condition, with loopholed granite walls topped by large guns and batteries able to enfilade each other, but the surrounding countryside had been removed of all cover and foliage. The inhabitants of the town, including 11,500 soldiers, had stockpiled hundreds of tons of supplies in preparation for the upcoming siege. It began on 22 March with consistent artillery fire against Jhansi&#x27;s ramparts. Although the Rani&#x27;s forces returned fire capably, her best gunners were soon killed, and the defender&#x27;s situation became increasingly dire. A breach was made on 29 March, although it was quickly stockaded. Rose was making preparations for an assault when news reached him that the Rani&#x27;s childhood friend Tatya Tope was marching to rescue Jhansi with more than 20,000 men.

Rose, unable to confront the new enemy with his whole force for fear that the defenders of Jhansi would sortie into his rear, detached just 1,200 men to confront Tatya Tope. Despite the numerical advantages of the rebel force, the vast majority of them was untrained, and they used old, slow guns. In the Battle of Betwa on 1 April, accurate British artillery fire repelled the first rebel line, and organisational mistakes meant the second line was unable to assist. In a comprehensive victory, the British lost less than one hundred men, and inflicted over 1,500 casualties on Tatya Tope&#x27;s army. At 3am on 3 April, two columns assaulted the south wall—one through the breach and one using ladders in an escalade—and both penetrated the defences. The Rani personally led a counter-attack with 1,500 Afghan troops, but steady British reinforcement drove them back.

Determined resistance was encountered in every street and every room of the palace. Street fighting continued into the following day and no quarter was given, even to women and children. &quot;No maudlin clemency was to mark the fall of the city,&quot; wrote Thomas Lowe. The Rani withdrew from the palace to the fort and after taking counsel decided that since resistance in the city was useless she must leave and join either Tatya Tope or Rao Sahib (Nana Sahib&#x27;s nephew).
According to tradition, with Damodar Rao on her back she jumped on her horse Baadal from the fort; they survived but the horse died. The Rani escaped in the night with her son, surrounded by guards. The escort included the warriors Khuda Bakhsh Basharat Ali (commandant), Ghulam Gaus Khan, Dost Khan, Lala Bhau Bakshi, Moti Bai, Sunder-Mundar, Kashi Bai, Deewan Raghunath Singh and Deewan Jawahar Singh. She decamped to Kalpi with a few guards, where she joined additional rebel forces, including Tatya Tope. They occupied the town of Kalpi and prepared to defend it. On 22 May British forces attacked Kalpi; the forces were commanded by the Rani herself and were again defeated.

===Flight to Gwalior and death===
The leaders (the Rani of Jhansi, Tatiya Tope, the Nawab of Banda, and Rao Sahib) fled once more. They came to Gwalior and joined the Indian forces who now held the city (Maharaja Scindia having fled to Agra from the battlefield at Morar). They moved on to Gwalior intending to occupy the strategic Gwalior Fort and the rebel forces occupied the city without opposition. The rebels proclaimed Nana Sahib as Peshwa of a revived Maratha dominion with Rao Sahib as his governor (ਸੂਬੇਦਾਰ) in Gwalior. The Rani was unsuccessful in trying to persuade the other rebel leaders to prepare to defend Gwalior against a British attack which she expected would come soon. General Rose&#x27;s forces took Morar on 16 June and then made a successful attack on the city.

On 17 June in Kotah-ki-Serai near the Phool Bagh of Gwalior, a squadron of the 8th (King&#x27;s Royal Irish) Hussars, under Captain Heneage, fought the large Indian force commanded by Rani Lakshmibai, who was trying to leave the area. The 8th Hussars charged into the Indian force, slaughtering 5,000 Indian soldiers, including any Indian &quot;over the age of 16&quot;. They took two guns and continued the charge right through the Phool Bagh encampment. In this engagement, according to an eyewitness account, Rani Lakshmibai put on a sowar&#x27;s uniform and attacked one of the hussars; she was unhorsed and also wounded, probably by his sabre. Shortly afterwards, as she sat bleeding by the roadside, she recognized the soldier and fired at him with a pistol, whereupon he &quot;dispatched the young lady with his carbine&quot;. According to another tradition Rani Lakshmibai, the Queen of Jhansi, dressed as a cavalry leader, was badly wounded; not wishing the British to capture her body, she told a hermit to burn it. After her death, a few local people cremated her body.

The British captured the city of Gwalior after three days. In the British report of this battle, Hugh Rose commented that Rani Lakshmibai is &quot;personable, clever and beautiful&quot; and she is &quot;the most dangerous of all Indian leaders&quot;.

==Cultural depictions and statues==
Statues of Lakshmibai are seen in many places in India, which show her and her son tied to her back. Lakshmibai National University of Physical Education in Gwalior, Laksmibai National College of Physical Education
in Thiruvananthapuram, Maharani Laxmi Bai Medical College in Jhansi are named after her. Rani Lakshmi Bai Central Agricultural University in Jhansi was founded in 2013. The Rani Jhansi Marine National Park is located in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in the Bay of Bengal.

===Rani of Jhansi Regiment===
The Rani of Jhansi Regiment was a unit of the Indian National Army, which was formed in 1942 by Indian nationalists in Southeast Asia during World War II. The regiment was named in honor of Rani Lakshmibai, the warrior queen of Jhansi who fought against British colonial rule in India in 1857. The Rani of Jhansi Regiment was the first all-women regiment in the history of the Indian Army. It was composed of Indian women who were recruited from Southeast Asia, mostly from the Indian diaspora in Singapore and Malaya. The women were trained in military tactics, physical fitness, and marksmanship, and were deployed in Burma and other parts of Southeast Asia to fight against the British.

The Indian Coast Guard ship ICGS Lakshmi Bai has been named after her.

In 1957 two postage stamps were issued to commemorate the centenary of the rebellion. Indian representations in novels, poetry, and film tend towards an uncomplicated valorization of Rani Lakshmibai as an individual solely devoted to the cause of Indian independence.

===Songs and poems===
Several patriotic songs have been written about the Rani. The most famous composition about Rani Lakshmi Bai is the Hindi poem &quot;Jhansi ki Rani&quot; written by Subhadra Kumari Chauhan. An emotionally charged description of the life of Rani Lakshmibai, it is often taught in schools in India. A popular stanza from it reads:

Translation: &quot;From the Bundele Harbolas&#x27; mouths we heard stories / She fought like a man, she was the Rani of Jhansi.&quot;

For Marathi people, there is an equally well-known ballad about the brave queen penned at the spot near Gwalior where she died in battle, by B. R. Tambe, who was a poet laureate of Maharashtra and of her clan. A couple of stanzas run like this:

Translation: &quot;You, a denizen of this land, pause here and shed a tear or two / For this is where the flame of the valorous lady of Jhansi was extinguished / … / Astride a stalwart stallion / With a naked sword in hand / She burst open the British siege / And came to rest here, the brave lady of Jhansi!&quot;

<doc id="201862" wikidata="Q643780" url="?curid=201862" title="Monongahela River">
<text>The Monongahela River ( , ), sometimes referred to locally as the Mon (), is a river on the Allegheny Plateau in north-central West Virginia and Southwestern Pennsylvania. The river flows from the confluence of its west and east forks in north-central West Virginia northeasterly into southwestern Pennsylvania, then northerly to Pittsburgh and its confluence with the Allegheny River to form the Ohio River. The river includes a series of locks and dams that makes it navigable.

==Etymology==
The Unami word &quot;Monongahela&quot; means &quot;falling banks&quot;, in reference to the geological instability of the river&#x27;s banks. Moravian missionary David Zeisberger (1721–1808) gave this account of the naming: &quot;In the Indian tongue the name of this river was &quot;Mechmenawungihilla&quot; (alternatively spelled &quot;Menawngihella&quot;), which signifies a high bank, which is ever washed out and therefore collapses.&quot;

The Lenape Language Project renders the word as &quot;Mënaonkihëla&quot; (pronounced ), translated &quot;where banks cave in or erode&quot;, from the verbs &quot;mënaonkihële&quot; &quot;the dirt caves off&quot; (such as the bank of a river or creek, or in a landslide) and &quot;mënaonke&quot; (pronounced ), &quot;it has a loose bank&quot; (where one might fall in).

Monongalia County and the town of Monongah, both in West Virginia, are named for the river, as is the city of Monongahela in Pennsylvania. (The name &quot;Monongalia&quot; is either a Latinized adaptation of &quot;Monongahela&quot; or simply a variant spelling.)

===Variant names===
The USGS name for the river is the Monongahela River; there have been numerous alternative names, alternative spellings and misspellings in historical texts.

==Geography==
The Monongahela is formed by the confluence of the West Fork River and its &quot;east fork&quot;—the Tygart Valley River—at Fairmont in north central West Virginia. From there it flows northeasterly to cross the Pennsylvania border just west of north Cheat Lake on its Cheat River tributary. Then it flows northerly across southwestern Pennsylvania, taking a bit of a detour northeast 10 miles south of Pittsburgh to approach Pittsburgh from the southeast and its confluence with the Allegheny River to form the Forks of the Ohio at &quot;The Point&quot; of Point State Park in Downtown Pittsburgh.

==Geology==
Prior to early Pleistocene regional glaciation, more than 780,000 years ago, the ancestral Monongahela River (a.k.a. the Pittsburgh River) flowed northward from present-day north-central West Virginia, across western Pennsylvania and northwestern Ohio, and into the Saint Lawrence River watershed. One (or more) extensive ice sheet advance dammed the old north-flowing drainage and created a vast lake—known as Lake Monongahela—stretching from an unknown point north of present-day Beaver, Pennsylvania for ~ south to Weston, West Virginia. A river-lake with many narrow bays, its maximum water surface rose to above sea level. Over deep in places, its southwestward overflow gradually incised old drainage divides and contributed to the geological development of the present-day upper Ohio River Valley.

==Hydrography==
Via the Ohio River, the river is part of the Mississippi watershed which drains to the Gulf of Mexico on the Atlantic Ocean.

The river&#x27;s length is 130 miles, its drainage basin is 7,340 sq.mi. and the average 30-year discharge at Elizabeth, Pennsylvania, is 9,109 cfs. It falls 3,831 ft. in elevation from its highest source to its mouth on the Ohio River. It falls 280 feet from its forks to its mouth, a stretch made navigable by locks. The mean depth is about 20 ft.

In southwestern Pennsylvania, the Monongahela is met by two major tributaries: the Cheat River, which joins at Point Marion, and the Youghiogheny River, which joins at McKeesport.

Major tributaries include: Becks Run, Big Sandy Creek, Buffalo Creek, Cheat River, Crooked Run, Deckers Creek, Dunkard Creek, Lick Run, Middle Fork River, Paw Paw Creek, Peters Creek, Streets Run, Turtle Creek, Tygart Valley River, West Fork River, Youghiogheny River.

===Locks and dams===

The river is navigable its entire length with a series of locks and dams that maintain a minimum depth of to accommodate coal-laden barges. All dams are operated by the Pittsburgh District Army Corps of Engineers. In 2006, the navigation system, operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, had nine dam-locks along of waterway. The locks overcame a change in elevation of about .
*Braddock Locks &amp; Dam 
*Locks &amp; Dam 3
*Locks &amp; Dam 4 
*Maxwell Lock &amp; Dam 
*Grays Landing Lock &amp; Dam 
*Point Marion Lock and Dam 
*Morgantown Lock and Dam 
*Hildebrand Lock and Dam 
*Opekiska Lock and Dam

===Dam removal===
The locks and dam at Elizabeth will be removed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Work will commence in 2024. Afterwards 30 miles of the river between Charleroi and Braddock will be free flowing.

==Ecology==
According to the EPA&#x27;s Toxics Release Inventory for 2010, the Monongahela ranked as the 17th most polluted river in the nation. The primary polluters were Pennsylvania iron and steel mills.

==Recreation==
The upper drainage area of the river basin is renowned for its water sports/hobbies of whitewater kayaking (and in some cases whitewater rafting) opportunities. The land here is of a very rugged plateau type which allows streams to gather sufficient water volume before they fall off the plateau and create challenging rapids. Some of the best known specific stream locations for this include:
*Youghiogheny River at Ohiopyle, Pennsylvania
*Youghiogheny River at Friendsville, Maryland
*Cheat River at Albright, West Virginia
*Tygart River at Belington, West Virginia

==History==
===18th and 19th centuries===
The Monongahela River valley was the site of a famous battle that was one of the first in the French and Indian War—the Braddock Expedition (May–July 1755). It resulted in a sharp defeat for two thousand British and Colonial forces against those of the French and their Native American allies.

In 1817, the Pennsylvania legislature authorized the Monongahela Navigation Company to build 16 dams with bypass locks to create a river transportation system between Pittsburgh and the area that would later become West Virginia. Originally planned to run as far south as the Cheat River, the system was extended to Fairmont, and bituminous coal from West Virginia was the chief product transported downstream. After a canal tunnel through Grant&#x27;s Hill in Pittsburgh was completed in 1832, boats could travel between the Monongahela River and the Western Division Canal of Pennsylvania&#x27;s principal east–west canal and railroad system, the Main Line of Public Works. In 1897, the federal government took possession of the Monongahela Navigation through condemnation proceedings. Later, the dam-lock combinations were increased in size and reduced in number.

Briefly linked to the Monongahela Navigation was the Youghiogheny Navigation, a slack water system of between McKeesport and West Newton. It had two dam-locks overcoming a change in elevation of about . Opening in 1850, it was destroyed by a flood in 1865.

During the 19th century and well into the twentieth, the Monongahela was heavily used by industry, and several U.S. Steel plants, including the Homestead Works, site of the Homestead Strike of 1892, were built along its banks. Following the killing of several workers in the course of the strike, anarchist Emma Goldman wrote: &quot;Words had lost their meaning in the face of the innocent blood spilled on the banks of the Monongahela.&quot; Other mills included the Edgar Thomson Works in Braddock, the first steel works in the area, the Duquesne Works and the Jones and Laughlin steel works on the South Side of Pittsburgh. Only the Edgar Thomson works remain producing steel along the river.

Despite the closure of many of the mills in the 1980s and 90s, the Monogahela is still an important waterway for industry. The Mon Valley Works of U.S. Steel operates three plants, including the Edgar Thomson plant for basic steel marking, the Irvin plant for steel finishing, and the Clairton plant for coke production. Coal barges are a common sight on the river, and the railways which line either side are heavily used by freight. Other industries include power generation, chemicals, and recycling.

===20th century===
Three ships in the United States Navy have been named &quot;Monongahela&quot; after the river.
In October 1930, severe drought caused the river flow to drop below , and in some places, it was possible to walk across the river bottom.

The river was the site of a famous airplane crash that has become the subject of urban legends and conspiracy theories. Early on the morning of January 31, 1956, a B-25 bomber en route from Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada to Olmsted Air Force Base in Pennsylvania crashed into the river near the Glenwood Bridge in Homestead, Pennsylvania. The six crewmen survived the initial crash, but two of them succumbed in the cold water and drowned. Despite the relatively shallow water, the aircraft was never recovered and became known as the &quot;ghost bomber&quot;. The &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot; published a graphical representation of the flight path and flight details in 1999. As of 2018, the bomber has not been found.

<doc id="201871" wikidata="Q943379" url="?curid=201871" title="Lord President of the Council">
<text>The Lord President of the Council is the presiding officer of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom and the fourth of the Great Officers of State, ranking below the Lord High Treasurer but above the Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal. The Lord President usually attends and is responsible for chairing the meetings of the Privy Council, presenting business for the approval of the Sovereign.

==The office and its history==
The Privy Council meets once a month, wherever the sovereign may be residing at the time, to give formal approval to Orders in Council. Only a few privy counsellors need attend such meetings, and only when invited to do so at the government&#x27;s request. As the duties of the Lord President are not onerous, the post has often been given to a government minister whose responsibilities are not department-specific. In recent years it has been most typical for the Lord President also to serve as Leader of the House of Commons or Leader of the House of Lords. The Lord President has no role in the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.
In the history of British government, the President of the Council is a relatively recent creation. The first certain appointment to the office being that of the Duke of Suffolk in 1529. Although there is a reference to Edmund Dudley serving as &#x27;president of the council&#x27; in 1497, it was only in 1529 that the role was given the style and precedence of a Great Officer of State by act of Parliament (21 Hen. 8. c. 20). Prior to 1679 there were several periods in which the office was left vacant. During coronations of the monarch, the Lord President carries the Sword of State.

In the 19th century, the Lord President was generally the cabinet member responsible for the education system, amongst his other duties. This role was gradually scaled back in the late 19th and early 20th centuries but remnants of it remain, such as the oversight of the governance of various universities.

During times of National or coalition government the office of Lord President has sometimes been held by the leader of a minority party (e.g. Baldwin 1931–1935, MacDonald 1935–1937, Attlee 1943–1945, Clegg 2010–2015). It has been suggested that the office has been intermittently used for Prime Ministerial deputies in the past.

A particularly vital role was played by the Lord President of the Council during the Second World War. The Lord President served as chairman of the Lord President&#x27;s Committee. This committee acted as a central clearing house which dealt with the country&#x27;s economic problems. This was vital to the smooth running of the British war economy and consequently the entire British war effort.

Winston Churchill, clearly believing that this wartime co-ordinating role was beneficial, introduced a similar but expanded system in the first few years of his post-war premiership. The so-called &#x27;overlord ministers&#x27; included Frederick Leathers as Secretary of State for the Co-ordination of Transport, Fuel and Power and Lord Woolton as Lord President. Woolton&#x27;s job was to co-ordinate the then separate ministries of agriculture and food. The historian Lord Hennessy of Nympsfield quotes a PhD thesis by Michael Kandiah saying that Woolton was &quot;arguably the most successful of the Overlords&quot; partly because his ministries were quite closely related; indeed, they were merged in 1955 as the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.

On several occasions since 1954, non-British Ministers have served briefly as acting Lords President of the Council, solely to preside over a meeting of the Privy Council held in a Commonwealth realm. Examples of this practice are the meetings in New Zealand in 1990 and 1995, when Geoffrey Palmer and James Bolger respectively were acting Lords President.

Andrea Leadsom&#x27;s appointment in June 2017 was the first in some time where the post holder was not a full Cabinet member.

==Role and responsibilities==
===Routine functions===
The routine functions of the lord president are as follows:
#Preside at Privy Council meetings, including any emergency meetings, and attend to both ministerial correspondence and parliamentary questions relating to Privy Council business.
#Consider for approval prerogative and statutory Orders in Council. Prerogative orders deal with the basic functioning of the British state and are thus applicable under a number of circumstances, including but not limited to the prorogation of Parliament, the granting, amendment, and revocation of royal charters, the appointment of high sheriffs, or the governance of British Overseas Territories. On the other hand, statutory orders are a form of delegated legislation conferred on His Majesty&#x27;s Government by Parliament for the purposes of creating detailed regulations through rulemaking. Unlike prerogative orders, statutory Orders in Council are subject to parliamentary scrutiny. As a consequence, most Orders in Council operate on statutory footing as opposed to the common law authorities conferred by the royal prerogative.
#Consider for approval Orders of Council concerning various matters of state, namely appointments to and regulation of professional bodies and institutions of higher education. Unlike Orders in Council which are enacted by the sovereign on the advice of the Privy Council, Orders of Council are enacted by the Privy Council itself pursuant to statutory authority conferred by Parliament.
#As a member of the Privy Council&#x27;s Committee for the Affairs of Jersey and Guernsey, review laws passed by the bailiwicks of Jersey and Guernsey, and make recommendations to the sovereign concerning their approval.

===Visitorial functions===
In addition to his or her routine functions, the lord president also serves as the visitor for several English universities, including:

*University of Birmingham
*University of Bristol
*University of Hull
*Imperial College London
*Keele University
*University of Leeds
*University of Leicester
*University of Liverpool
*University of London (but not King&#x27;s College London or University College London)
*University of Nottingham
*University of Reading
*University of Sheffield (but not Sheffield Hallam University)
*University of Southampton
*University of Sussex
*University of Wales

<text>Winger is an American hard rock band formed in New York City in 1987. Winger gained popularity during the late 1980s and early 1990s with two platinum albums, &quot;Winger&quot; and &quot;In the Heart of the Young&quot;, along with charting singles &quot;Seventeen&quot;, &quot;Headed for a Heartbreak&quot; and &quot;Miles Away&quot;. In 1990, the band was nominated for an American Music Award for &quot;Best New Heavy Metal Band&quot;. As the music scene changed in the early to mid-1990s due to the popularity of grunge, their success faded following their third release, 1993&#x27;s &quot;Pull&quot;. Winger disbanded less than a year later in 1994.

In 2001, the band reunited and have since conducted several successful tours. In 2006, the band&#x27;s 1993 touring lineup (minus Paul Taylor but including John Roth) reunited to record the band&#x27;s first studio album in over 13 years, &quot;IV&quot;, and toured in support of the album into 2008. In 2009, the band released their fifth album, &quot;Karma&quot;, followed by &quot;Better Days Comin&#x27;&quot; in 2014. Their most recent album, &quot;Seven&quot;, came out in 2023.

==History==
===1980: Early use of the name Winger===

The first release under the name Winger was a Denver Rainbow Music Hall live recording of the song &quot;Wizard of the Key&quot; on the &quot;KAZY Thunder on the Mountain&quot; compilation in 1980. The lineup featured brothers Kip, Nate, and Paul Winger and their friend Peter Fletcher (later a member of L.A.&#x27;s Pigmy Love Circus). Members Paul and Kip met while recording and touring for Alice Cooper.

===1987–1994: Main career and breakup===
The band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Winger&quot;, was released on August 10, 1988, on Atlantic Records. The record was a success, achieving platinum status in the United States, and gold status in Japan and Canada. On February 11, 1989, the album peaked at number 21 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and was in various places on the chart for 63 weeks. Radio and MTV hits from the album included &quot;Madalaine&quot;, &quot;Seventeen&quot;, &quot;Headed for a Heartbreak&quot; and &quot;Hungry&quot;. In 1990, the band was nominated for an American Music Award for &quot;Best New Heavy Metal Band&quot;.

Shortly after that tour, Winger released its second album &quot;In the Heart of the Young&quot;, which went 1-and-1/2 platinum in the U.S. and gold in Japan. Hit radio tracks and MTV videos included &quot;Can&#x27;t Get Enuff&quot;, &quot;Miles Away&quot; and &quot;Easy Come Easy Go&quot;.

Winger followed the release of its second album with a 13-month world tour, playing over 230 dates with Kiss, Scorpions, ZZ Top, Extreme and Slaughter. Paul Taylor left the band after the tour, citing exhaustion after years of touring. Their third studio album, &quot;Pull&quot;, produced by Mike Shipley, was recorded in 1992/1993 as a three-piece band. It was originally to be called &quot;Blind Revolution Mad&quot;, after the opening song. Reportedly Kip Winger, anticipating that critics would dismiss the album out of hand, renamed it &quot;Pull&quot; as a tongue-in-cheek reference to the CD being used by critics as a skeet shooting target. The album was not as successful as the previous albums saleswise, but gained solid reviews. On the following tour, John Roth was called in to replace Paul Taylor on rhythm guitar. The album coincided with the rise of grunge, which swept aside the brand of melodic pop-metal that Winger represented.

In the 1990s, Winger was subject to mockery from MTV&#x27;s animated series &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head&quot;. Series creator Mike Judge later revealed that he had been incorrectly informed that Kip Winger had asked the network not to make jokes about the band on the series, which led to further jokes about the band, but later learned from Winger himself that he had never made any such stipulation. Stewart, an early character from the TV show, wore a Winger t-shirt during the show&#x27;s original run on MTV during the 1990s as well both of its revivals in 2011 and 2022. Characterized as a wimp who looked up to Beavis and Butt-head, he wore the t-shirt in an attempt to emulate the duo, whose t-shirts had the logos of AC/DC and Metallica.

After disbanding in 1994, bassist/lead vocalist Kip Winger went on to a solo career, while guitarist Reb Beach went on to touring projects with artists Dokken and Alice Cooper, and has held a permanent guitar spot in Whitesnake since 2002. The band&#x27;s other members pursued or resumed careers as session musicians.

===2000–2019: Reunion===

In 2001, it was announced that all original members of the band would return to the studio to record the song &quot;On the Inside&quot; for &quot;The Very Best of Winger&quot;. In 2002, all five members embarked on a reunion tour of the U.S. and Canada on a bill with Poison. According to Kip Winger, in a 2008 interview with rock and roll comic C.C. Banana, it was important to include all five members because &quot;it was the big, long-awaited reunion so I wanted to include everybody who had ever been in the band.&quot; In 2003, it was confirmed that activity had been halted due to Reb Beach&#x27;s touring commitment with Whitesnake as well as his solo album &quot;Masquerade&quot; and involvement with The Mob.

On July 16, 2005, it was announced that Kip Winger would perform as the lead singer for the Alan Parsons Live Project at the Common Ground Music Festival in Lansing, Michigan. In May 2006, it was confirmed that Winger had reformed without one of its original members Paul Taylor, to record another album and tour Europe. The album, &quot;IV&quot;, was released in Europe in October and the nine-country &quot;Winger IV Tour&quot; ran in the last two weeks of the same month.

On February 25, 2008, the band performed in Providence, Rhode Island, as part of a benefit for survivors of the Station nightclub fire. The concert, along with other artists was debuted on VH1 Classic on March 23, 2008. In late 2009, it was confirmed that Winger would record a fifth album &quot;Karma&quot;, with a tour to support it.

Winger released their sixth studio album titled, &quot;Better Days Comin&#x27;&quot; in April 2014, after teasers were published on Kip Winger&#x27;s website and on the official Winger Facebook page as well.

===2020–present===

As of 2023, Winger continues to tour theaters and clubs across the United States. According to a 2021 interview with guitarist Reb Beach, Winger&#x27;s seventh album was in the recording process. On March 10, 2023, they announced a new album, &quot;Seven&quot;, releasing on May 5, and released a new single from the album, &quot;Proud Desperado&quot;.

==Style and influences==
Kip Winger, in description of the band&#x27;s musical ability and style, said, &quot;Our band was known to musicians, and a lot of musicians showed up to see me play — watching, trying to figure out how I&#x27;m playing. We were like the &#x27;hair band&#x27; [version of] Dream Theater.&quot;

<doc id="201877" wikidata="Q1105142" url="?curid=201877" title="Red Ensign">
<text>The Red Ensign or Red Duster is the civil ensign of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. It is one of the British ensigns, and it is used either plain or defaced with either a badge or a charge, mostly in the right half.

It is the flag flown by British merchant or passenger ships since 1707. Prior to 1707, an English red ensign and a Scottish red ensign were flown by the English Royal Navy and the Royal Scots Navy, respectively. The precise date of the first appearance of these earlier red ensigns is not known, but surviving payment receipts indicate that the English navy was paying to have such flags sewn in the 1620s.

== History ==
=== England (pre-1707) ===
Prior to the reorganisation of the Royal Navy in 1864, the plain red ensign had been the ensign of one of three squadrons of the Royal Navy, the Red Squadron, as early as 1558. By 1620, the plain red ensign started to appear with the Cross of St George in the upper-left canton.

The Colony of Massachusetts used the red ensign from its founding; after a sermon by Roger Williams in 1636, equating crosses with the papacy, Governor Endicott ordered the St George cross removed from the flag. The Great and General Court of the colony found that Endicott had &quot;exceeded the lymits of his calling&quot;, and yet left the flag without its cross for a number of decades afterward.

In 1674, a Royal Proclamation of King Charles II (1630–1685, reigned 1660–1685) confirmed that the Red Ensign was the appropriate flag to be worn by English merchant ships. The wording of the 1674 proclamation indicates that the flag was customarily being used by English merchantmen before that date. At this time, the ensign displayed the Cross of St George in the canton. This changed in 1864, when an order in council provided that the Red Ensign was allocated to merchantmen.

===Scotland (pre-1707)===

It is probable that the cross-saltire was adopted by the Scots as a national ensign at a very early period, but there seems no direct evidence of this before the fourteenth century. The earliest Scottish records were lost at sea in the ship that was sent to return them to that country, whence they had been carried off, with the &quot;Stone of Destiny&quot;, by King Edward I (1239–1307, reigned 1272–1307). Prior to 1707, the Scottish Red Ensign was flown by ships of the Royal Scots Navy, with a saltire in the canton.

The Scottish Ensign has been flown unofficially by many Scottish vessels for a number of years. In 2015, a movement was launched by Lieutenant Commander George MacKenzie RNR to have the Scottish Ensign officially recognised, on the basis that the Merchant Shipping Act of 1995 permits Her Majesty the Queen in Council or a Secretary of State to approve &quot;any colours consisting of the Red Ensign defaced or modified&quot;. Supporters cited the example of the States of Jersey, who in 2010 were permitted to use a &quot;voluntary or informal&quot; red ensign, adorned with a Plantagenet crown. The movement culminated in a petition for the Scottish Government to seek a warrant from the U.K. government to reintroduce the flag as an &quot;informal or voluntary ensign&quot; for Scottish merchant vessels. MacKenzie stressed that the &quot;petition was not meant to replace or supersede the British Red Ensign&quot;. The petition received the support of MSP Michael Russell, and other Merchant sailors and members of sailing trade groups. The petition gained enough support that it was passed onto the Scottish Government who recommended Mr MacKenzie &quot;raise the issue with the Secretary of State directly or through his MP&quot;.

===Great Britain (1707–1800)===
Upon the legislative union of England and Scotland in 1707, the tiny Royal Scots Navy came to an end as a separate force, and the &quot;Union&quot; colours (invented on the union of the two crowns a hundred years before) were inserted in all ensigns, naval and mercantile. An Order in Council of 21 July 1707 established as naval flags of the royal standard the Union flag and &quot;the ensign directed by her Majesty since the said Union of the two Kingdoms&quot;, which from the coloured drafts attached to the order is seen to be the red ensign. The white and blue ensigns are not mentioned in this Order; evidently the red ensign was alone regarded as the legal ensign of Great Britain and the others as merely variations of it for tactical purposes.

In 1707, Acts of Union, ratifying the Treaty of Union, which had been agreed the previous year, were passed by the parliaments of England and Scotland, thereby uniting the Kingdom of Scotland with the Kingdom of England (which included the Principality of Wales) into a new state with the name &quot;Kingdom of Great Britain&quot;. This resulted in a new red ensign which placed the first Union Flag, including a saltire in the first quarter. The new design of the Red Ensign was proclaimed by Queen Anne (1665–1714, reigned 1702–1714), who indicated that it was to be used by both the navy and ships owned by &quot;our loving subjects&quot;.

The flag was flown by ships of the Thirteen Colonies in North America before the American Revolution. Modification of the flag was used to express the discontent of the colonists before and during the outbreak of the revolution. This can be seen in both the Taunton flag and the George Rex flag. It also formed the basis of the Grand Union Flag of 1775, which served as the first American national flag, although it differed slightly from the primary Red Ensign in that it had a squared Union Flag in the canton.

===United Kingdom (1801–present)===

In 1801, with another Act of Union, Ireland joined with Great Britain to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, which resulted in the present Union Flag being added to the canton. The St Patrick&#x27;s Cross was added to the Union Flag and, accordingly, to the first quarters of the British ensigns.

The Merchant Shipping Act 1854 included a specific provision that the Red Ensign was the appropriate flag for a British merchantman. This provision was repeated in successive British shipping legislation (i.e., 1889, 1894 (section 73) and 1995).

Until 1864, the Red Ensign was also the principal ensign of the Royal Navy, and as such it was worn by ships of the Red Squadron of the navy, as well as by those warships that were not assigned to any squadron (i.e., those sailing under independent command). The white ensign and the blue ensign were also used by the Royal Navy.

Many in the Admiralty felt that the Royal Navy&#x27;s use of three separate ensigns (i.e., the red, white, and blue) was outdated and confusing. Many also felt that merchantmen should be clearly distinguishable from warships. In July 1864, an order-in-council provided that the White Ensign was the ensign of the Royal Naval Service. The Blue Ensign was designated as the proper national colours for ships commanded by an officer of the Royal Naval Reserve, and (with an appropriate badge) as national colours for ships in government service. The Red Ensign was assigned to British merchantmen. This basic structure remains today.

A few years later (1867–1869), the Admiralty determined that the blue ensign charged with an appropriate badge in the fly would be used as the ensign by those ships in the armed, or public, service of the many British colonies. Most British colonies needed to use the blue ensign due to the fact that most had government vessels; some colonies, such as South Australia, had warships. As a result, the Blue Ensign was used throughout the Empire and thus became the model for the flags used by a number of colonies and former colonies in the British Empire. At the same time, the red ensign (which was designated in 1864 as the flag for merchant shipping) was used by merchantmen of those colonies or territories which obtained an Admiralty warrant. Warrants were issued, chronologically, to British North Borneo (1882), British East Africa (1890), Canada (1892), New Zealand (1899), British South Africa (1902), Australia (1903), British Somaliland (1904), Union of South Africa (1910), Newfoundland (1918), Indian Native States (1921), Cyprus (1922), Tanganyika (1923), Western Samoa (1925) and Palestine (1927). Those areas, notably including British India, that did not have an Admiralty warrant used the plain Red Ensign, although unofficial local versions of the Red Ensign were used.

, Red Ensigns charged with the local emblem are available to be used by ships registered on several of the component registers of the Red Ensign Group: Bermuda, British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Falkland Islands, Gibraltar, Guernsey, Jersey, and Isle of Man.

==Plain Red Ensign==
The plain red ensign is the civil ensign or merchant ensign of the United Kingdom. The flag has overall ratio of 1:2 with the Union occupying one quarter of the field and placed in the canton.

==Defaced Red Ensign==
Some public bodies or national institutions are authorised to fly red ensigns defaced with a badge or emblem. These include:
The red ensign defaced with a specific club&#x27;s badge or emblem is allowed to be hoisted as the national ensign by members of the following yacht clubs:
== Flags based on the Red Ensign ==
===British Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies===
====Bermuda====

Bermuda, uniquely among British overseas territories, uses the Red Ensign as its land flag as well as at sea. The flag has apparently been flown unofficially since Bermuda&#x27;s arms were granted in 1910. There appears to be no formal adoption of the Bermuda flag for use on land, although a 1969 Foreign and Commonwealth Office circular mentions its use. The white and green shield has a red lion holding a scrolled shield showing the sinking of the ship &quot;Sea Venture&quot; off of Bermuda in 1609. The Red Ensign is likely to have been chosen as Bermuda&#x27;s land flag due to Canadian influence. (For the first half of the 20th century, Canada made use of the Red Ensign defaced with the Canadian shield as an unofficial land flag.) Bermuda&#x27;s 2002 shipping legislation officially recognises the flag as an ensign for Bermudian registered ships. Prior to 2002, the flag was often used unofficially by Bermudian ships as an ensign, as reflected in Admiralty correspondence dating back to the 1950s. Bermuda (civil) Government vessels and maritime services use the defaced blue ensign, which is flown both from vessels and from shore facilities.
====Gibraltar====

Gibraltar features variant flags of the territory which incorporate the Gibraltar coat of arms into a red ensign. This is the only Overseas Territory not to adopt any such ensign as its territorial flag, although the ensigns may still be seen on vessels in the waters of the territory.
====Isle of Man====

The Crown dependency of the Isle of Man was granted a red ensign, with the triskelion of Man in the central fly, for use by ships registered through the island, by Royal Warrant dated 27 August 1971. It is widely used on luxury yachts and large cargo ships around the world, due to the financial benefits the Isle of Man can provide.
===Australia===

The Australian Red Ensign is the Australian civil ensign. From 1901 to 1954 the flag was used as a civil flag, to be flown by private citizens on land, with the use of the Blue Ensign reserved for government use, reflecting British practice. During this period, the Blue Ensign was the Australian national flag. In 1941, Prime Minister Robert Menzies stated that there should be no restrictions on private citizens using the Blue Ensign on land, and in 1947 Prime Minister Ben Chifley reaffirmed this position, but it was not until the passage of the Flags Act 1953 that the restriction on civilians flying the Blue Ensign was officially lifted, after which use of the Red Ensign on land became a rarity. Under the Navigation and Shipping Act 1912 and the Shipping Registration Act 1981, the Red Ensign remains the only flag permitted for use by merchant ships registered in Australia. Pleasure craft may use either the Red Ensign or the national flag, but not both at the same time.
===Canada===


The term &quot;Red Ensign&quot; is often used to refer to the Canadian Red Ensign, the former &quot;de facto&quot; national flag of Canada. It was informally adopted following Canadian Confederation in 1867 and, from 1892, it was the official flag for use on Canadian merchant ships. On land, however, the official national flag was the Union Flag. Despite its unofficial status, the Red Ensign was widely used on land as well. In 1924, the Red Ensign was approved for use on Canadian government buildings outside Canada, and from 1945 for those inside Canada as well.

Canada&#x27;s Red Ensign bore various forms of the shield from the Canadian coat of arms in its fly during the period of its use. Shown here are pictures of the three official forms between 1868 and 1965. Canada also used a blue ensign for ships operated by the Canadian government and for the Royal Canadian Navy.

The Red Ensign served as Canada&#x27;s national flag until 1965 when, after considerable debate, it was replaced by the Maple Leaf flag. The Red Ensign is still popular among traditionalists and monarchists. Although the national Red Ensign is no longer used officially, the provincial flags of Manitoba and Ontario are Red Ensigns bearing their respective coats of arms.

The Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company and the North West Company also used Red Ensigns as their corporate flags.


===Newfoundland===

The Red Ensign with the Newfoundland great seal in the fly was considered the unofficial flag of the Dominion of Newfoundland from 1904 until 1931, at which point it was officially legislated as the Dominion of Newfoundland&#x27;s &quot;National Colours&quot; to be flown as the civil ensign, with the Union Flag being legislated as the national flag at that time as well. The Newfoundland Red Ensign was then used as official commercial shipping identification until the mid-1960s. The badge in the flag consists of Mercury, the god of commerce and merchandise, presenting to Britannia a fisherman who, in a kneeling attitude, is offering the harvest of all the sea. Above the device in a scroll are the words &quot;Terra Nova&quot;, and below the motto &quot;Hæc Tibi Dona Fero&quot; or &quot;These gifts I bring thee.&quot; The seal was redesigned by Adelaine Lane, niece of Governor Sir Cavendish Boyle in 1903.
===Fiji===

The Fijian Red Ensign with the Union Flag in the first quarter, and the shield from the coat of arms of Fiji in the fly became the official flag in Fiji for civilian vessels since 10 October 1970. Previously the ensign was displayed the full coat of arms on a white disc from 1908.
===India===

The flag representing British India was usually the Union Flag with the Star of India. In many international events and international associations the Red Ensign with the Star of India was used to represent India. After the partition of British India, both India and Pakistan have their own civil ensigns following British tradition, which are all variants of the Red Ensign with their own national flag in the canton.

====Princely states====
The princely states, also known as &#x27;native states&#x27;, were over five hundred nominally sovereign territories within the British Raj that were not directly governed by the British, but by a local ruler through a form of indirect rule subject to a subsidiary alliance under the paramountcy of the British Crown.
The great majority of the princely states of British India were landlocked. Some of the few which had a coastline used versions of the red ensign on their merchant vessels. 

===New Zealand===
The New Zealand Red Ensign with the Union Flag in the first quarter, and the Southern Cross, represented by four five-pointed white stars featured in the fly became the official flag in New Zealand for merchant vessels in 1901. Previously a plain red ensign was used.

The red ensign may continue to be flown on land in Māori areas or during Māori events under the Flags, Emblems, and Names Protection Act 1981 in recognition of long held Māori preference for red flags. New Zealand law allows the defacement of the flag in accordance with Māori custom in which white capital letters identifying a particular family or Māori tribe are added. In the case of the flag on the right, TAKITIMU refers to a grouping of Māori iwi descended from the crew of the &quot;Tākitimu&quot; waka (canoe).

Today, private and merchant craft can choose to fly the Flag of New Zealand (which is a blue ensign) or the New Zealand red ensign.
===South Africa===


The Red Ensign, defaced with the shield of the national coat of arms, was authorised as the merchant ensign of the Union of South Africa on 28 December 1910. From 1912, the shield was displayed on a white disc. The ensign was superseded by the national flag with effect from 1 January 1960, in terms of the Merchant Shipping Act 1951.

The Red Ensign with the shield was also used on land as a de facto national flag from 1910 until 1928. There was also a Blue Ensign which was the official ensign of government-owned vessels, and was also flown at South African offices overseas.

The most notable usage of the Red Ensign as a national flag was when General Louis Botha flew the flag over Windhoek in what was then German South-West Africa after the town&#x27;s occupation by South African troops in 1915.

The use of the Red Ensign as a national flag ended with the introduction of a proper national flag in 1928. This was preceded by the South African Flag Controversy of 1925 to 1928.

===United States===
The flag of the city of Taunton in Bristol County, Massachusetts is based on the pre-1801 Red Ensign. This was a local variant of the Flag of New England (see George Rex Flag).

The Grand Union Flag, the first national flag of the United States of America, was easily produced by sewing white stripes onto the British Red Ensigns. The current Flag of Hawaii is most similar to it, of all American flags.
===The Scout Association===

Sea Scout groups within The Scout Association can be Royal Navy Recognised, and are allowed to fly a defaced Red Ensign to signify this.

<text>Charlotte &quot;Chattie&quot; Cooper Sterry (née Charlotte Reinagle Cooper; 22 September 1870 – 10 October 1966) was an English female tennis player who won five singles titles at the Wimbledon Championships and in 1900 became Olympic champion. In winning in Paris on 11 July 1900, she became the first female Olympic tennis champion as well as the first individual female Olympic champion.

==Early life and career==

Charlotte Cooper was born on 22 September 1870 at Waldham Lodge, Ealing, Middlesex, England, the youngest daughter of Henry Cooper, a miller, and his wife Teresa Georgiana Miller. She learned to play tennis at the Ealing Lawn Tennis Club where she was first coached by H. Lawrence and later by Charles Martin and Harold Mahony. She won her first senior singles title in 1893 at Ilkley. Between 1893 and 1917 she participated in 21 Wimbledon tournaments. At her first appearance she reached the semifinals of the singles event in which she lost to Blanche Bingley Hillyard. She won her first singles title in 1895, defeating Helen Jackson in the final of the All-Comers event. In that match she was down 0–5 in both sets but managed to win in straight sets. In 1896, she successfully defended her title in the Challenge Round against Alice Simpson Pickering. Between 1897 and 1901 the titles were divided between Cooper Sterry (1898, 1901) and Bingley Hillyard (1897, 1899, 1900). The 1902 Challenge Round match against Muriel Robb was halted on the first day of play due to rainfall at 6–4, 11–13. The match was replayed in its entirety the next day and Robb won 7–5, 6–1, playing a total of 53 games which was then a record for the longest women&#x27;s singles final. In 1908 as a mother of two she won her last singles title when she defeated Agnes Morton in straight sets in the All-Comers final after a seven-year hiatus and at the age of 37. She is the oldest Wimbledon&#x27;s ladies’ singles champion and her record of eight consecutive singles finals stood until 1990 when Martina Navratilova reached her ninth consecutive singles final.

In addition to her singles titles, Cooper Sterry also won seven All-England mixed doubles titles; five times with Harold Mahony (1894–1898) and once with Laurence Doherty (1900) and Xenophon Casdagli (1908). In 1913 she reached the final of the first Wimbledon women&#x27;s doubles event with Dorothea Douglass, 18 years after winning her first Wimbledon title.

She won the singles title at the Irish Lawn Tennis Championships in 1895 and 1898, a prestigious tournament at the time. At the 1900 Summer Olympics, where women participated for the first time, Cooper Sterry won the tennis singles event. On 11 July 1900 she defeated Hélène Prévost in the final in straight sets and became the first female Olympic tennis champion as well as the first individual female Olympic champion. With Reginald Doherty, she won the mixed doubles title after a straight-sets victory in the final against Hélène Prévost and Harold Mahony. In 1901 she won the singles title at the German Championships, and in 1902 she won the Swiss Championship. Cooper Sterry remained active in competitive tennis and continued to play in championship events well into her 50s.

On 12 January 1901 she married Alfred Sterry, a solicitor, who became president of the Lawn Tennis Association. They had two children: Rex (1903–81) who was the vice-chairman of the All England Club for a period of 15 years during the 1960s and 1970s and Gwen (born 1905), a tennis player who participated at Wimbledon and played on Britain&#x27;s Wightman Cup team.

Cooper Sterry, who had been deaf since the age of 26, died on 10 October 1966 at the age of 96, in Helensburgh, Scotland.

She was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 2013.

==Playing style==
Cooper Sterry had an offensive style of playing, attacking the net when the opportunity arose. She was one of a few female players of her time who served overhead. Her main strengths were her steadiness, temperament and tactical ability. Her excellent volleying skills stood out at a time when this was still a rarity in ladies tennis.

==Grand Slam finals==
===Singles: 11 (5 titles, 6 runners-up)===

===Doubles: 1 (1 runner-up)===

<doc id="201889" wikidata="Q9006186" url="?curid=201889" title="Héctor Camacho Jr.">
<text>Héctor &quot;Machito&quot; Camacho Herrera (born September 20, 1978) is an American-born Puerto Rican and Mexican professional boxer and published writer residing in Phoenix, Arizona, United States. He started boxing professionally at the age of 18. He is the son of the late three-time world champion Héctor &quot;Macho&quot; Camacho and the nephew of Felix &quot;Showtime&quot; Camacho. In 2007, 2010, 2014, and 2016, he won the World Boxing Council (WBC) Caribbean Boxing Federation (CABOFE) Light Middleweight title. His mother was born in Monterrey, Nuevo León, Mexico.

==Early life and education==
Hector Camacho Jr. was born and raised in New York City. His parents were quite young and did not marry; his father was Héctor Camacho, then 16 years old, who lived in Spanish Harlem. The senior Camacho, nicknamed &quot;Macho&quot;, became an amateur boxer and, later a professional.

The boy was nicknamed &quot;Machito&quot;. He grew up admiring his father&#x27;s fighting skills and imitating him, and was more interested in fighting than school. At the age of eight, Camacho Jr. was noted for doing mock sparring with his dad before his father&#x27;s world title defense on June 13, 1986, against Edwin Rosario at Madison Square Garden in New York City. That night, the boy wore a Puerto Rican flag outfit.

==Professional career==
His fight against the former world champion Jesse James Leija resulted in a no contest, after Leija&#x27;s team protested the awarding of the fight on points to Camacho. The fight was stopped in the fifth round due to an unintentional headbutt by Leija that opened a cut over Camacho&#x27;s eye. Camacho indicated he did not want to continue. The referees went to their scorecards to determine the winner, and gave Camacho the decision. Many fans felt he quit in the fight.

Camacho is a member of Team Fight to Walk, which raises money to support spinal cord research. Other boxers, including Boyd Melson, Demetrius Andrade, Shawn Estrada, Steve Cunningham and Deandre Latimore, help support this organization.

In 2002, Camacho lost for the first time, to Omar Weis from Argentina, by a decision in ten rounds.

On July 9, 2005, Camacho Jr. and his father co-starred an undercard in Tucson, Arizona. After riding into the ring on a fake bull, Camacho Jr. proceeded to knock out Francisco Barra in the second round. A riot in the audience followed his father&#x27;s win that night; it is not known if Camacho Jr. had a role in the riot.

Camacho fought against Andrey Tsurkan at the Boardwalk Hall in Atlantic City, New Jersey, on June 10, 2006. Tsurkan won by a TKO in the 8th round.

In July 2007, Camacho lost a decision to Don Juan Futrell. Camacho came in overweight at 161 pounds and was outworked by the 150-pound Futrell. Sports journalists thought Camacho&#x27;s hopes for any future title contention were in doubt based on his condition and performance in that fight.

===Suspended===
In December 2008, Camacho was indefinitely suspended by the Puerto Rico Boxing Commission as a result of his cancelling a bout with Yory Boy Campas in November in Tijuana, Mexico. Camacho had denied signing for that bout.

===Caribbean light middleweight title===
Camacho got back into shape and on August 29, 2009, he defeated Israel Cardona for the vacant WBC Caribbean Boxing Federation (CABOFE) Light Middleweight title. In an interview prior to the match, Camacho said that his passion for boxing had been re-ignited and he wanted to win a world title.

On October 30, 2009, Camacho Jr. fought Luis &quot;Yory Boy&quot; Campas in El Paso, Texas. Camacho won the 10-round bout by a split decision, with the scores of 96–91 and 95–92 for him, and 92–95 for Campas. This was a sort of &quot;revenge&quot;, as Campas had a draw with the fighter&#x27;s father, Héctor Camacho, just a few months before.

Camacho was reported to have challenged the former Champion Fernando Vargas, but no fight resulted.

On October 29, 2010, Camacho was knocked out by David Lemieux, then the undefeated middleweight contender, in the first round at the Bell Centre, in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.

==Personal life==
In 2013, Camacho said in an interview that it was his father&#x27;s death and his conversion to Islam that helped him make his comeback into boxing. On September 1, 2014, a book written by Camacho, Jr. was published. The book, &quot;Macho Dad&quot;, is a comic book that portrays his dad as a Puerto Rican flag-wearing superhero.

<text>Hans Axel von Fersen (; 4 September 175520 June 1810), known as Axel de Fersen in France, was a Swedish count, Marshal of the Realm of Sweden, a General of Horse in the royal Swedish Army, one of the Lords of the Realm, aide-de-camp to Rochambeau in the American Revolutionary War, diplomat and statesman, and a friend of Queen Marie-Antoinette of France. Von Fersen was lynched by a Stockholm mob, following rumors of his involvement in the death of Charles August, Crown Prince of Sweden.

==Life==

===Descent and early life===
Axel von Fersen was born in 1755 to Field Marshal Axel von Fersen the Elder and countess Hedvig Catharina De la Gardie. He was nephew of Eva Ekeblad and grandson of General Hans Reinhold Fersen. Axel was the second of four children; he had two sisters, Hedvig Eleonora and Eva Sophie, and one brother, Fabian Reinhold. Two female cousins, Ulrika von Fersen and Christina Augusta von Fersen, were Swedish ladies-in-waiting and leading socialites of the Gustavian age.

Von Fersen&#x27;s ancestors came from Estonia to Sweden at the time of the Thirty Years&#x27; War, which took place from 1618 to 1648. The family made their name during the reigns of Christina (queen regnant), Charles X Gustav, and Charles XI. In 1735, the von Fersen family purchased Steninge Palace, which overlooks Mälaren, a lake outside Stockholm. Von Fersen&#x27;s father, the de facto parliamentary leader of the Hats party, was the most politically influential man in Sweden at that time and also one of the richest in the realm.

The younger Axel was influenced by French culture, owing in part to his father&#x27;s services to Louis XV of France. Under his childhood tutor, von Fersen learned several languages including French, Latin, English, German and Italian. His later education was primarily military.

===The grand tour (1771–1775)===
On 3 July 1770, von Fersen made his first journey abroad with the intention of seeing the world and finishing his studies at military academies, including Brunswick, Turin, Strasbourg and Lüneburg. In October 1771, he passed through Switzerland and in Ferney, he met the philosopher, Voltaire. 

In November 1772, von Fersen continued on to Turin, Italy, where he paid a visit to King Charles Emmanuel III. In January 1774 his travels took him to France where he paid court to the reigning monarch, Louis XV, and his mistress, Madame du Barry. While at Versailles he attended the ceremony of the Order of the Holy Spirit. A little over a week later, von Fersen met Marie-Antoinette, then Dauphine, for the first time:

Von Fersen allegedly replaced his father in 1774 as the lover of Ewa Löwen.

Von Fersen continued the Grand Tour by travelling to England where he stayed for roughly four months and met King George III and Queen Charlotte. By the beginning of 1775, von Fersen had returned to Sweden, where he remained for approximately three years, serving under his king, Gustavus III.

===Marie-Antoinette===
In the late summer of 1778, von Fersen traveled to Normandy with his friend, the Baron de Stedingk, to see a large army camp that was training under the command of the Duke of Broglie. Besides military matters, they were treated to dinner and dances attended by the officers and their wives. Von Fersen later paid his respects to the French royal family for the first time since his grand tour more than three years earlier:

Marie-Antoinette&#x27;s personal property, the Petit Trianon, was on the grounds of the Palace of Versailles. In contrast to Versailles, the dress and manners at the Petit Trianon were simple and down-to-earth; her guests were personally invited and treated equally, as friends. However, the private festivities often caused jealousy among those who were excluded from them.

===The American Revolutionary War===
In the 1770s, the American Revolutionary War began. France had officially declared war against her &quot;natural enemy&quot; (Great Britain) in February 1778, but it wasn&#x27;t until 1780 that French troops were sent to America.

Von Fersen secured the position of aide-de-camp to General Rochambeau, commander of the expedition. On 4 May 1780, they sailed from Brest. Nearly two months later, the French landed at Narragansett Bay in Newport, Rhode Island, and made camp until June of the next year. In mid-September 1780, von Fersen accompanied Rochambeau to meet the American General George Washington in Hartford, Connecticut. On meeting Washington, von Fersen remarked:

After spending 11 months in Newport in total inaction, Rochambeau began a march on 12 June 1781, to link up with Washington&#x27;s army at Philipsburg on the Hudson. On 15 August, von Fersen was tasked with conveying a letter from Rochambeau to Comte de Barras, who had been waiting for a signal to join Comte de Grasse&#x27;s fleet on Chesapeake Bay. In early September, de Grasse defeated the British fleet in the Chesapeake, and by the end of the month Washington surrounded Cornwallis in Yorktown. On 19 October, the British surrendered, hastening the end of the war.

Von Fersen spent the winter in Williamsburg with the French army. Anticipating the American Civil War nearly 80 years later, von Fersen remarked that he wouldn&#x27;t be surprised to see Virginia separate herself from the rest of the states at some point due to the strain of &quot;aristocracy&quot; prevalent there as opposed to the northern states. In December 1782, the French made sail for the West Indies and Venezuela, but word reached them of the signing of peace and the ships headed back to France. Von Fersen arrived back in France in June 1783.

===Years leading up to the Revolution (1783–1787)===
Following the end of hostilities, the United States and Sweden concluded a Treaty of Amity and Commerce. Von Fersen was awarded the Order of Cincinnatus by Washington, though he was forbidden by his monarch to wear a medallion earned fighting in a republican war.

In 1783, Gustavus III asked von Fersen to join him in Germany as Captain of the Guard. Gustavus was planning on making war on Denmark, and was on a trip through the Continent to secure aid from other countries. Gustavus promoted von Fersen to titulary-colonel in the Swedish army, chevalier of the Order of the Sword, and lieutenant-colonel of the light-horse cavalry of the King. Gustavus also used his influence to persuade Louis to have von Fersen appointed proprietary colonel of the Royal Suédois French Army infantry regiment. Louis also appointed von Fersen second-colonel of the Royal Deux-Ponts regiment and chevalier of the Order of Military Merit.

On 7 June 1784 von Fersen returned to Versailles with Gustavus, who concluded a treaty of alliance with France on the 19th of the month. On 27 June, Gustavus and the rest of his entourage were invited to the Petit Trianon. Von Fersen sat in the royal box beside Marie-Antoinette. A month later von Fersen returned to Sweden, tasking himself with the job of getting a dog for Marie-Antoinette, which she named Odin.

Von Fersen divided his time between Paris, Versailles, and his new regiment in Valenciennes. During this time, the Diamond Necklace Affair took place, and only months later the Cardinal de Rohan was arrested, bringing the affair to public knowledge. Von Fersen wrote to his father in September that everyone believed the Queen (Marie-Antoinette) had fooled the King. In August 1786, Vicomte de Calonne finally apprised Louis XVI of the desperate state of the French finances, and by the very end of the year it was announced that there would be a convening of an Assembly of Notables to discuss future measures.

===The French Revolution===
In late-February 1787, the Assembly of Notables was convened. Von Fersen attended the closing of the last day of that meeting, and described the gathering as &quot;imposing&quot;. Von Fersen was secretly entrusted, by Gustavus III, with the role of special envoy to the King and Queen of France. Some sensitive diplomatic contacts between Sweden and France were conducted, not through the Swedish embassy, but through von Fersen. To be closer to Paris, he moved into a house in Auteuil borrowed from Count Esterhazy.

In spring, 1788, von Fersen joined Gustav for the latter&#x27;s Finnish campaign against Russia as lieutenant-colonel of the Royal Horse Guards, but by December 1788, von Fersen was again with his French regiment in Valenciennes to witness the following:

On 2 May 1789, the Estates-General finally met. Von Fersen and Beaumont sat in one of the boxes of the Salle des Menus Plaisirs on 5 May, as Louis read his opening speech. Before long, however, the Third Estate reconstituted itself as the National Assembly, arguing that the three orders were no more than arbitrary divisions of one body. By the end of June, the monarchy had reinforced its concentration of regiments around the capital, ostensibly to maintain order in and around Paris, although many believed the troops would be turned against the recalcitrant Third Estate. Von Fersen wrote:

On 14 July 1789, the Invalides and the Bastille were both stormed and taken, and on 16 July, von Fersen was at Versailles with the King and Queen to debate how to forestall the incipient revolution in Paris. After much discussion, Louis decided to go to Paris with the guardsmen to show his personal goodwill towards the revolution. The Princess de Lamballe (who in 1792 would lose her life in the September Massacres) related the scene:

Von Fersen followed Louis to the capital and arrived in time to watch Louis take the national cockade from the mayor, Jean Sylvain Bailly, and placed it in his own hat. On 8 August, the August Decrees, which abolished many aspects of monarchy, including tithes and hereditary titles, were enacted. Von Fersen wrote from Valenciennes:

Months later, with the revolution spreading to the rest of the country and the royal army in disintegration, the Flanders Regiment was brought to Versailles to replace the French Guards who had mutinied. The King&#x27;s bodyguard decided to host a fraternal dinner party for the regiment, and von Fersen and Beaumont attended. Despite having reservations at first, the King and Queen made an appearance towards the end. This banquet, however, provided fuel for the Women&#x27;s March on Versailles four days later, when it was rumored that the tricolour (cockade) was trampled upon at the banquet. Von Fersen was in Versailles to witness the march.

On the morning of 6 October 1789, an armed crowd made their way to the royal apartments. Two of the royal bodyguards were killed before the National Guard restored order. In order to calm the protestors, Louis agreed to go to the balcony of the Cour de Marbre and tell the crowd that he would return with them to Paris. Von Fersen recounts the departure in his diaries:

===Flight to Varennes===
The situation of the royal family became considerably more desperate on 18 April 1791, when they were prevented from travelling to Saint-Cloud to attend Mass by a large hostile crowd. Escape plans had been broached earlier between Comte de Mirabeau and von Fersen, but Mirabeau&#x27;s death on 2 April 1791 put an end to that discussion. Following the aborted trip to Saint Cloud, von Fersen revived these plans with vigor. In June, he acquired a Berline and drove it to a courtyard at Eleanore Sullivan&#x27;s residence on the Rue de Clichy in Paris. The escape was arranged to take place on 20 June, coinciding with a particular guard change.

At 11:15 p.m. the royal children were brought out without difficulty. At 11:45, the king&#x27;s sister, Madame Elizabeth, appeared, followed by Louis himself. Half an hour later they were still waiting for Marie-Antoinette. However, she came out at the same time as the torchlit carriage of Marquis de Lafayette, who was responsible for the royal family&#x27;s custody, appeared with some of his men. Marie-Antoinette was able to conceal herself and the royal family slipped away.

Von Fersen drove the carriage, first from the Place du Carrousel to the Porte Saint-Martin, and then on to the Barrier Saint-Martin where they switched to the Berline. Von Fersen continued to drive as far as Bondy, seven miles from Paris, where the Queen&#x27;s maids and a fresh relay of horses awaited them. The royal family took the post road and von Fersen took a different route to Bourget.

The royal family reached Varennes on 22 June around 11 p.m., but here they were discovered and eventually held in custody until troops from the National Convention arrived. They departed Varennes surrounded by 6,000 armed citizens and National Guardsmen. Having left behind him a long declaration which had been read and published in all the newspapers in his absence, Louis himself had made it impossible to sustain the pretence that he had been &quot;abducted&quot;.

===War against France (1791–1793)===
Even before the royal family returned to Paris, it was discovered that von Fersen was one of the people who facilitated their escape, and a warrant was put out for his arrest. Von Fersen left France and in Koblenz he put himself in touch with Comte d&#x27;Artois, the exiled prince, and Charles Alexandre de Calonne, the former Controller-General; together they made plans to convince the other European powers to declare war on France. In Brussels, von Fersen worked out a steganography technique for writing with Marie-Antoinette.

From 2–14 August, von Fersen was in Vienna to discuss the situation with Marie-Antoinette&#x27;s brother Leopold, now Emperor. On 27 August 1791 the Declaration of Pillnitz was issued from Pillnitz Castle near Dresden; it declared the joint support of the Holy Roman Empire and Prussia for King Louis XVI against the Revolution but stipulated that Austria would only go to war if the other European powers followed them into war, which at this point in time was not likely to happen. Von Fersen wrote:

On 16 March 1792, Gustav III was shot at the Royal Opera House in Stockholm, and died almost two weeks later. In Sweden, Gustav&#x27;s younger brother, the Duke Karl, became regent to the underage Gustav IV. On 20 April, France officially declared war on Austria, and invaded the Austrian Netherlands. On 20 June, the Tuileries was stormed by a large crowd and Louis was made to wear a red bonnet of liberty and drink a toast to the health of the people of Paris and the Nation. Three days later Marie-Antoinette was able to get an encrypted letter out to von Fersen: &quot;Your friend is in the greatest danger. His illness is making terrible progress ... Tell his relations about his unfortunate situation&quot;.

On 7 November, following the French victory at Jemappes, von Fersen wrote from Brussels:

On 21 January 1793, Louis XVI was guillotined at the Place de la Révolution. Von Fersen heard the news while in Cologne: &quot;Received last night at 10:30, from the Archbishop of Tours, the sad details of the death of the King of France&quot;. On 1 February, France officially declared war against Great Britain and the Dutch Republic, but the tide quickly turned against the French in the Netherlands. The general in charge of the northern army, Dumouriez, was defeated 18 March at Neerwinden and Louvain. On 18 March, von Fersen was able to meet with him:

On 2 August, Marie-Antoinette was moved to the Conciergerie while awaiting her trial. During this time von Fersen was still attempting to find a way to save her and the remaining royal family. On 11 August he wrote:

On 6 October 1793, von Fersen paid a visit to Jean-Baptiste Drouet at the Saint-Elizabeth prison on the slim hope of hearing news that might be of use. Drouet was the postmaster who recognised Louis on his flight to Varennes and was able to alert the authorities in time to stop them. 

Marie-Antoinette was executed 10 days later. Von Fersen heard the news of this while in Brussels:

===Later years (1793–1810)===

Von Fersen returned to Sweden in 1791. In the following years, he observed the ever-increasing expansion of the French revolutionary empire. In late December 1793, he was suspected of possible complicity in Baron Armfeldt&#x27;s conspiracy to deprive the Duke of Södermanland of the regency. As a result, von Fersen was deprived of his diplomatic appointments and his post as ambassador. In November 1796, Prince Gustav was declared of age and become King Gustav IV Adolf. His accession restored von Fersen and other supporters of Gustav III to favour at court. Von Fersen and his best friend, Baron Taube, became two of the most influential advisers to the young king, inculcating in him a &quot;steadfast opposition to Revolutionary France, close relations with Russia, and hostility to Denmark, with the ultimate objective of acquiring Norway&quot;.

In November 1797, von Fersen attended the Second Congress of Rastatt and met general Napoleon Bonaparte.

While in Germany, von Fersen made a trip to Karlsruhe to secure, for Gustav IV Adolf, the hand of the Princess Friederike of Baden, whom Gustav IV Adolf married in October. In 1799, following von Fersen&#x27;s return to Sweden from Germany, he was appointed as one of the Lords of the Realm.

In the autumn of that year, Gustav IV Adolf became concerned about sympathy for the French Revolution in the city of Uppsala. After students at Uppsala University celebrated Bonaparte&#x27;s return to France from his Italian campaigns, Gustav IV Adolf appointed von Fersen as Chancellor of the university. According to Adlerbeth, this amounted to &quot;a declared French royalist being made the Swedish Jacobins&#x27; schoolmaster&quot;. That winter a wave of rioting occurred in Stockholm, Gothenburg, Norrköping, Linköping, Malmö, and other Swedish towns following the onset of a severe winter and famine. Von Fersen wrote: &quot;Who, given the spirit that now prevails, can guarantee that there will not be a general upheaval?&quot;

In April, an attempt to trick the Uppsala orchestra into performing a composition containing an excerpt from the &quot;Marseillaise&quot; led to the trial and punishment of four known university radicals, one of whom was dismissed. The &quot;Music Trial&quot; proved the deathblow to Uppsala radicalism.

With the government nearly bankrupt, and poor harvests and declining trade undermining his efforts to resolve the issue without recourse to parliament, Gustav IV Adolf reluctantly announced the first assembly of the Riksdag. The Riksdag dissolved in mid-June but not before several prominent aristocrats walked out and renounced their noble status. Though creating a much-talked about sensation, they had virtually left a vacuum in the political field which their rivals filled.

In 1801, von Fersen was appointed Marshal of the Realm. He was now the highest official in the court of Sweden. Around this time, von Fersen&#x27;s sister, Sophie, returned to Sweden from Germany and took over his household in lieu of a wife.

===Swedish politics and death===

Following the overthrow and exile of King Gustavus IV in 1809, a dispute over the royal succession divided the nobility and much of Swedish society. Von Fersen, now Earl Marshal of Sweden, led a political faction (&quot;the Gustavians&quot;) which supported Gustavus&#x27; son against the popular Crown Prince Charles August.

On 28 May 1810, while reviewing troops in Scania, Charles August fell from his horse and died from apoplexy. Rumours were rife throughout the country that he had been poisoned by the partisans of Gustav IV Adolf; von Fersen and his sister Sophie were seen as prime suspects. They were abused in public, and von Fersen received anonymous death threats.

20 June 1810 was the date set for the Crown Prince&#x27;s public funeral. The &quot;Livgardet till Häst&quot; (Horse Guards) formed the advance guard in the procession; von Fersen, as Marshal of the Realm, and other court dignitaries, rode in coaches before the coffin, while the rear of the procession was brought up by a squadron of cavalry which had accompanied the Crown Prince&#x27;s remains from Scania. Foot Guards paraded on the Riddarhustorget. General Silfversparre , commander of the Stockholm garrison, was alerted to the possibility of disturbances but may himself have been a member of the court party that opposed von Fersen. The procession proceeded slowly through the Hornsgatan and Södermalm Square, and was met with threats and insults directed at von Fersen as soon as it entered the city.

Von Fersen, with a violent effort, flung back one of the assailants who grasped him and shook himself free of the others who were pressing round. There was a momentary lull, and the curses shrank from shouts to mutterings. Von Fersen&#x27;s face bled where a stone had cut it, his decorations glittering in the sun. The guards, who were supposed to protect him, gazed at him with a sort of curious expectancy.

It was at this moment when General Silfversparee arrived on the scene and a small detachment of troops. This intervention further enraged the large crowd. Von Fersen, realising that the authorities planned to do nothing, turned and dashed into the first door he could find. The crowd converged on this spot, and a few ran into the house in pursuit of him.

Before long, one man appeared at the window &quot;and with a triumphant shout&quot; hurled down von Fersen&#x27;s cloak and sword, which were seized by the angry crowd. Von Fersen was dragged back out into the square. His gloves were pulled off and thrown in his face, and his coat torn off and trampled upon. Silfversparre, attempting to save von Fersen, offered to arrest him and have him tried in court for the Crown Prince&#x27;s murder. At this moment, the mounted escort turned and rode away. Von Fersen succumbed on the scene.

Von Fersen&#x27;s contemporary, Baron Gustaf Armfelt, stated afterward:

Axel von Fersen died that day in Stockholm as Sweden&#x27;s highest-ranking official next to the king; his death sent shockwaves throughout the country. The cause of death was determined to be &quot;crushing of the ribcage&quot; when the Swedish-Finn Otto Johan Tandefelt jumped with both feet on Fersen&#x27;s chest.

==Aftermath==
A few months after the murder, von Fersen and his family were cleared of any suspicion connected with the death of Carl August of Augustenburg, and he finally received a state burial with all pomp and ceremony. His sister, Sophie Piper, withdrew from Stockholm to her Löfstad manor, near Norrköping. Here she raised a memorial to her brother, with the inscription:

&quot;Åt en oförgätlig broder, mannamodet uti hans sista stunder den 20 juni 1810 vittna om hans dygder och sinnes lugn&quot; and &quot;I dessa neider där han fordom niutit wänskapen och friden skall hans skugga mötas af wälsignelse och tårar.&quot;

==Relationship with Marie-Antoinette==
The young nobleman was a favourite at the French court, owing partly to the recollection of his father&#x27;s devotion to France, but principally because of his own amiable qualities. Queen Marie-Antoinette, who had first met von Fersen when they both were 18, was especially attracted by the grace and wit of &quot;le beau&quot; von Fersen. However, it was nearly four years later, on von Fersen&#x27;s second visit to France in the summer of 1778, when the relationship blossomed. Here he was accepted by Marie-Antoinette into her trusted circle and invited to her private gatherings at the Petit Trianon. It seems that the friendship grew very quickly and caused jealousy among those at court. In Beaumont&#x27;s account, von Fersen left for the war in America in the early part of 1780 to avoid causing a scandal, as it was widely known that the two were close, and it was rumoured that he was the queen&#x27;s lover. Beaumont wrote in his memoirs that von Fersen asked Swedish minister to France Gustaf Philip Creutz to use his influence to get him appointed as &quot;aide-de-camp&quot; to Rochambeau. According to Creutz in a letter to Gustav III:

After his return from America in June 1783, he was again accepted into the Queen&#x27;s private society. There were again rumours that the two were romantically involved. But since most of their correspondence was lost, destroyed, or redacted, there was no conclusive evidence. Starting in 2016, scientists at France&#x27;s Research Centre for the Conservation of Collections (CRCC) uncovered some of the redacted text of the queen&#x27;s letters to Fersen. The revealed texts do not mention a physical relationship, but do confirm a very strong emotional relationship.

==In popular culture==
In the 1938 American feature film &quot;Marie Anoinette&quot;, matinée idol Tyrone Power portrays Fersen.

In the 2006 drama/romance Marie Antoinette, he is portrayed by Jamie Dornan. 

Fersen is mentioned in the Japanese manga series &quot;The Rose of Versailles&quot; by Riyoko Ikeda.

He is also mentioned in &quot;The Bane Chronicles&quot;, a novella series associated with Cassandra Clare&#x27;s &quot;Shadowhunter&quot; franchise.

<text>Count Fredrik Axel von Fersen (5 April 171924 April 1794) was a Swedish statesman and soldier of Baltic German descent. He served as Lord Marshal of the Riksdag of the Estates, and although he worked closely with King Gustav III before and through the Revolution of 1772, he later opposed the king.

==Biography==
A son of Lieutenant-General Hans Reinhold von Fersen and his wife Countess Eleonora Margareta Wachtmeister (1684–1748), he entered the Swedish Life Guards in 1740, and from 1743 to 1748 was in the French service in the Royal-Suedois, where he rose to the rank of brigadier. His brother was Count Carl von Fersen (1716-1786).

In the Seven Years&#x27; War Fersen distinguished himself during the operations round Usedom and Wollin in 1759, when he inflicted serious loss on the Prussians. But it is as a politician that he is best known. A member of the Hat party, at the Riksdag of 1755–1756, he was elected Lord Marshal and served three non-consecutive terms in that post before the Revolution of 1772. In 1756 he defeated the projects of the court for increasing the royal power; but, after the disasters of the Seven Years&#x27; War, returned to court.

On the accession of the Caps to power in 1766, Fersen refused to employ the Guards to keep order in the capital when King Adolf Frederick of Sweden, driven to desperation by the demands of the Caps, abdicated, and a seven days’ interregnum ensued. At the ensuing Riksdag of 1769, when the Hats returned to power, Fersen was again elected marshal of the diet, but he made no attempt to redeem his pre-election pledges to Crown Prince Gustavus (later Gustav III) that he would carry out a very necessary reform of the constitution, and thus involuntarily contributed to the subsequent establishment of absolutism. When Gustav ascended the throne in 1772, and attempted to reconcile the two factions by a composition which aimed at dividing all political power between them, Fersen said he despaired of quickly bringing the people back to the path of virtue and patriotism, after more than half a century of licence and corruption. Nevertheless, he consented to open negotiations with the Caps, and was the principal Hat representative on the abortive composition committee. During the revolution of August 1772, Fersen remained a passive spectator of the overthrow of the constitution, and was one of the first whom Gustavus summoned to his side after his triumph.

He obstructed the measures of Gustav III, whom he is said to have treated with colossal insolence, for several years. There was a slight collision between them as early as the diet of 1778, but at the diet of 1786, Fersen led the opposition against the king&#x27;s financial measures, which were consequently rejected. He and twenty of his friends were arrested in 1789, leading to the collapse of the opposition; however, he was quickly released and thereafter remained aloof from politics.

His book &quot;Historiska Skrifter&quot; is mainly autobiographical, but its historical accounts are often biased.

He was one of the richest men in the realm. He was the lord of four grand houses in Sweden: Löfstad [inherited through his wife], Steninge, Ljung and Mälsåker. He also owned mines, land, forests and iron foundries in Sweden and Finland, and a large share of Sweden&#x27;s East India Company, the country&#x27;s most profitable undertaking ever.

Fersen was the father of Axel von Fersen the Younger and Sophie von Fersen, two of his four children with his wife Hedvig Catharina De la Gardie. His other two children were Fabian Reinhold von Fersen and Hedvig Eleonora von Fersen.

<text>This article lists verifiable spaceflight-related accidents and incidents resulting in human death or serious injury. These include incidents during flight or training for crewed space missions and testing, assembly, preparation, or flight of crewed and robotic spacecraft. Not included are accidents or incidents associated with intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) tests, fatality or injury to test animals, uncrewed space flights, rocket-powered aircraft projects of World War II, or conspiracy theories about alleged unreported Soviet space accidents. 

, there have been 19 astronaut fatalities during spaceflight that either crossed, or was intended to cross, the boundary of space as defined by the United States (50 miles above sea level). Astronauts have also died while training for space missions, such as the Apollo 1 launch pad fire that killed an entire crew of three. There have also been some non-astronaut fatalities during spaceflight-related activities. As of 2025, there have been over 188 fatalities in incidents regarding spaceflight.


==Astronaut fatalities==

===During spaceflight===
, in-flight accidents have killed 15 astronauts and 4 cosmonauts in five separate incidents. Three of the flights had flown above the Kármán line (edge of space), and one was intended to do so. In each of these accidents, the entire crew was killed. , a total of 676 people have flown into space and 19 of them have died. This sets the current statistical fatality rate at 2.8 percent.

NASA astronauts who died on duty are memorialized at the Space Mirror Memorial at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex in Merritt Island, Florida. Cosmonauts who died on duty under the Soviet Union were generally honored by burial at the Kremlin Wall Necropolis in Moscow. No Soviet or Russian cosmonauts have died during spaceflight since 1971.



===During training or testing===
In addition to accidents during spaceflights, 11 astronauts, test pilots, and other personnel have been killed during training or tests.


==Non-fatal incidents during spaceflight==
Apart from actual disasters, 38 missions resulted in some very near misses and also some training accidents that nearly resulted in deaths.

==Non-fatal training accidents==
Spaceflight-related accidents and incidents during assembly, testing, and preparation for flight of crewed and uncrewed spacecraft have occasionally resulted in injuries or the loss of craft since the earliest days of space programs. 35 accidents since 2009.

==Non-astronaut fatalities==

===Fatalities caused by rocket explosions===
This list excludes deaths caused by military operations, either by deliberate detonations, or accidental during production – for example German V-2 rockets reportedly caused on average an estimated 6 deaths per operational rocket just during its production stages. Over 113 fatalities.

===Other non-astronaut fatalities===
47 fatalities.

<text>Lieutenant general (Lt Gen, LTG and similar) is a military rank used in many countries. The rank originates from the Old European System. The rank traces its origins to the Middle Ages, where the title of lieutenant general was held by the second-in-command on the battlefield, who was normally subordinate to a captain general.

In modern armies, lieutenant general normally ranks immediately below general (or colonel general) and above major general; it is equivalent to the navy rank of vice admiral, and in air forces with a separate rank structure, it is equivalent to air marshal. In the United States, a lieutenant general has a three star insignia and commands an army corps, typically made up of three army divisions, and consisting of around 60,000 to 70,000 soldiers.

The seeming incongruity that a lieutenant general outranks a major general (whereas a major outranks a lieutenant) is due to the derivation of major general from sergeant major general, which was a rank subordinate to lieutenant general (as a lieutenant outranks a sergeant major). Several countries (e.g. Balkan states) use the rank of lieutenant colonel general instead of lieutenant general, in an attempt to solve this apparent anomaly.

In contrast, in Russia and a number of other countries of the former Soviet Union, lieutenant general is a rank immediately below colonel general, and above major general – in these systems there is no use of the brigadier general of many Western countries.

In addition, some countries use the lieutenant general as the rank of divisional commander, and some have designated them with 
French revolutionary system. For example, some countries of South America use divisional general as the equivalent of lieutenant general.

<text>Brigadier ( ) is a military rank, the seniority of which depends on the country. In some countries, it is a senior rank above colonel, equivalent to a brigadier general or commodore, typically commanding a brigade of several thousand soldiers. In other countries, it is a non-commissioned rank.

==Origins and history==

The word and rank of &quot;Brigadier&quot; originates from France. In the French Army, the Brigadier des Armées du Roi (Brigadier of the King&#x27;s Armies) was a general officer rank, created in 1657. It was an intermediate between the rank of Mestre de camp and that of Maréchal de camp.

The rank was first created in the cavalry at the instigation of Marshal Turenne on June 8, 1657, then in the infantry on March 17, 1668, and in the dragoons on April 15, 1672. In peacetime, the brigadier commanded his regiment and, in maneuvers or in wartime, he commanded two or three - or even four - regiments combined to form a brigade (including his own, but later the rank was also awarded to lieutenant-colonels, which allowed for the promotion of an officer who did not have his own regiment).

Before the rank of brigadier of the armies was dissolved in 1788, it was materialized by the wearing of a single star. And when it was abolished that year, the number of stars of its immediate superiors was not modified, which explains why today French generals have one more star on their insignia than their foreign counterparts (notably American).

Note that the rank of &quot;Chef de brigade&quot; created during the French Revolution replaced that of Colonel. A brigade commander then commanded... a half-brigade (a name that replaced the regiment).

The rank of Brigadier of the Armies reappeared during the Third Republic. It designates a colonel, experienced as a regimental commander, who has under his command several regiments without having the annexed units that would make this group a brigade. The army brigadier wears the colonel&#x27;s uniform and insignia. The rank was definitively abolished in 1945.

Until 1788, a rank of (&quot;brigadier of the armies&quot;), which could be described as a senior colonel or junior brigade commander, was used in the French Army. The normal brigade command rank was field marshal () (which elsewhere is a more senior rank). During the French Revolution, the ranks of and were replaced by brigade general ().

In common with many countries, France now uses the officer rank of brigade general (Général de brigade) instead of a &quot;brigadier&quot; rank. The held a one-star insignia, while the inherited the two-stars insignia. The disappearance of the rank is the reason that there is no one-star insignia in the French Army.

The rank of is still nonetheless used in some regiments as an equivalent of corporal. By extension, this also applies to the , equivalent in rank to a corporal in the infantry.

== NATO code ==
While the rank is used in a number of NATO countries, it is ranked differently depending on the country.

==Senior officer rank==
===British tradition===

In many countries, especially those formerly part of the British Empire, a brigadier is either the highest field rank or most junior general appointment, nominally commanding a brigade. It ranks above colonel and below major general.

The rank is used by the British Army, the Royal Marines, the Australian Army, the Bangladesh Army, the Indian Army, the Sri Lankan Army, the New Zealand Army, the Pakistan Army and several others. Although it is not always considered a general officer rank, it is always considered equivalent to the brigadier general and brigade general rank of other countries. In NATO forces, brigadier is OF-6 on the rank scale.

&quot;The grade of brigadier-general, also called, almost interchangeably, brigadier, first appeared in the British army during the reign of King James II. A warrant of 1705 placed the grade directly below major-general, but the appointment was always considered temporary and not continuous. The British were ambiguous over whether the holder was considered a general officer or a senior field grade office&quot;.

The title is derived from the equivalent British rank of brigadier-general, used until 1922 and still used in many countries. &quot;Brigadier&quot; was already in use as a generic term for a commander of a brigade irrespective of specific rank. Until the rank was dissolved in 1922, brigadier-generals wore a crossed sword and baton symbol on its own.

From 1922 to 1928, the British rank title used was that of colonel-commandant, with one crown and three &#x27;pips&#x27;, a rank which, although reflecting its modern role in the British Army as a senior colonel rather than a junior general, was not well received and was replaced with brigadier after six years. Colonel-commandant was only ever used for officers commanding brigades, depots or training establishments. Officers holding equivalent rank in administrative appointments were known as &quot;colonels on the staff&quot;, also replaced by brigadier in 1928. Colonel-commandants and colonels on the staff wore the same rank badge later adopted by brigadiers.

Until shortly after World War II, brigadier was an appointment conferred on colonels (as commodore was an appointment conferred on naval captains) rather than a substantive rank.

In Commonwealth countries, and most Arabic-speaking countries (in which the rank is called &quot;amid&quot;), the rank insignia comprises a crown (or some other national symbol) with three stars, (sometimes called &quot;pips&quot;), which are often arranged in a triangle. A brigadier&#x27;s uniform may also have red gorget patches. It is otherwise similar to that of a colonel (colonel&#x27;s rank insignia have a crown/emblem with two stars/&quot;pips&quot;.)

The Canadian Army used the rank of brigadier (following British tradition, with identical insignia) until the unification of the Canadian Forces in 1968. The rank then became brigadier-general with the insignia of St. Edward&#x27;s Crown surmounting a crossed sword and baton over one gold maple leaf.

===Spain===
The rank of a &quot;brigadier&quot; was established by Philip V in 1702 as an intermediate rank between colonel and true generals. In some Iberoamerican republics (see below), the rank survived after independence. In Spain, brigadiers came to be considered full generals in 1871, and in 1889 they were renamed . The historical rank is distinct from the current NCO rank of , although sometimes translators confuse the two. The name has survived as a cadet rank at the Spanish Naval Academy.

===Latin America===
Many countries in South and Central America were formerly Spanish or Portuguese (Brazil) possessions. Brigadier [-general] is used in Latin America, in the normal sense of brigade commander rank (e.g. Colombia, Chile), although most Latin American nations instead use the rank of brigade general. In Mexico, brigadier general is the rank below brigade general, both ranks falling between colonel and divisional general.

However, both the Argentine and Brazilian Air Forces use a curious system of variations on brigadier for all (Argentina) or most (Brazil) general officers. The origin of this system is not entirely clear, but in the case of Argentina may be due to army air units being commanded by brigade generals before the establishment of the Air Force as an independent armed force.

===United Kingdom===
In the UK, brigadier and sub-brigadier were formerly subaltern ranks in the Royal Horse Guards.

==Non-commissioned rank==
Brigadier also exists as a non-commissioned rank. This usage derives from the use of &quot;brigade&quot; to denote a squad or team, similar to the occasional English civilian usage &quot;work brigade&quot;.

===France===
====Military====
In France, and some countries whose forces were structured based on the method used in France, some branches of the army and the gendarmerie use for a rank equivalent to (corporal), and for a rank equivalent to . Brigadier is used by arms of the army that are by tradition considered &quot;mounted&quot; arms, such as logistics or cavalry units. A similar usage exists elsewhere.

In the French gendarmerie, the brigadier ranks are used as in the army, i.e. as junior enlisted ranks (), while the French police use brigadier ranks as their sub-officer () ranks. Since all professional police and gendarmes have sub-officer status in France, the gendarmerie brigadier ranks are rarely used, since they are used only by auxiliaries. On the other hand, the police brigadier ranks, which are used to indicate professional ranks, are common.

In the French gendarmerie and in &quot;mounted&quot; arms of the French army, the brigadier ranks are:
====National police====
In the French National Police, the sub-officer variations are used for non-commissioned officers are: 
* (OR-6, equal to gendarmerie )
* (OR-8, equal to gendarmerie )
* (OR-9, equal to gendarmerie )
* (OR-9, equal to gendarmerie )

===Indonesia===
In the Indonesian National Police force, this rank is referred to as the Constable ranks in the regular police units. It is equivalent to the &quot;sergeant&quot; rank in the armed forces. This rank is the most junior rank in the regular police units of Indonesia but is above the enlisted ranks () of the special police units such as in the Mobile Brigade corps and water police units. This rank is below the &quot;Sub-inspector&quot; () ranks. The police Brigadier ranks are as shown below:

* , abbreviated (Police Chief Brigadier)
* , not abbreviated (Police Brigadier)
* , abbreviated (Police Brigadier 1st class)
* , abbreviated (Police Brigadier 2nd class)

In addition, Police Brigadier General () and Brigadier General () are general officer ranks in the Indonesian Police, Army and Marine Corps respectively.

===Italy===
In the Italian and , the ranks of vice-brigadier (), brigadier (), and chief brigadier () correspond roughly to the army ranks based on sergeant. The rank of brigade general () is used throughout the armed forces as the most junior general rank, and corresponds to the British rank title of brigadier.

===Netherlands===
 is traditionally the most senior non-commissioned rank in the Dutch police, for example the National Police Corps (). Its predecessors also used this rank. The Royal Marechaussee (military police/gendarmerie) does not use this rank.

===Spain===
In Spain, a has a NATO rank code of OR-8 (and is thus a senior NCO). The Spanish rank is distinct from the Spanish-language &quot;brigadier [-general]&quot; used for senior officers in Latin America (and historically in Spain).

<text>Major is a senior military officer rank used in many countries. When used unhyphenated and in conjunction with no other indicators, major is one rank above captain in armies and air forces, and one rank below lieutenant colonel. It is considered the most junior of the senior officer ranks.

==Background==
Etymologically, the word stems from the Latin word meaning &quot;greater&quot;. The rank can be traced back to the rank of sergeant major general, which was shortened to sergeant major, and subsequently shortened to &quot;major&quot;.

When used in hyphenated or combined fashion, the term can also imply seniority at other levels of rank, including major general, denoting a low-level general officer, and sergeant major, denoting the most senior non-commissioned officer (NCO) of a military unit. The term major can also be used with a hyphen to denote the leader of a military band such as in pipe-major or drum-major.

<doc id="201929" wikidata="Q837582" url="?curid=201929" title="Lieutenant commander">
<text>Lieutenant Commander (also hyphenated lieutenant-commander and abbreviated Lt Cdr, LtCdr., LCDR, or LCdr) is a commissioned officer rank in many navies. The rank is superior to a lieutenant and subordinate to a commander. The corresponding rank in most armies and air forces is major, and in the Royal Air Force and other Commonwealth air forces is squadron leader. It is roughly equivalent to the Corvette Captain rank in central European countries and the Captain 3rd rank rank in eastern European/CIS countries.

The NATO rank code is mostly OF-3.

A Lieutenant Commander is a department officer or the executive officer (second-in-command) on many warships and smaller shore installations, or the commanding officer of a smaller ship/installation. They are also department officers in naval aviation squadrons.

==Protocol==
Some navies address Lieutenant Commanders by their full rank or the positions they occupy (&quot;captain&quot; if in command of a vessel).

In the British Royal Navy, United States Navy and Commonwealth Navies however, officers are addressed by their full rank if their full name is being used, or the higher grade of the rank if the officer is being addressed or referred to in shorthand. Therefore Lieutenant Commander John Smith Royal Navy is addressed as &quot;Commander&quot; or &quot;Commander Smith&quot;, and referred to as &quot;Commander Smith&quot;. 

Famous examples of this are:

- Lieutenant Commander Lionel Crabb Royal Navy who in conversation, biopics, Admiralty correspondence and even statements in Parliament by the Prime Minister is almost invariably referred to as “Commander Crabb”.

- Acting Temporary Lieutenant Commander Ewen Montagu RNVR, who is routinely referred to as &quot;Commander Montagu&quot; in historical and contemporary records, and in interviews by his colleagues on Operation Mincemeat. 

==Origins==
Lieutenants were commonly put in command of smaller vessels not warranting a commander or captain. Such a lieutenant was called a &quot;lieutenant commanding&quot; or &quot;lieutenant commandant&quot; in the United States Navy, and a &quot;lieutenant in command&quot;, &quot;lieutenant and commander&quot;, or &quot;senior lieutenant&quot; in the Royal Navy. The USN settled on &quot;lieutenant commander&quot; in 1862 and made it a distinct rank. The RN followed suit in March 1914.

==Canada==

In the Royal Canadian Navy, the rank of lieutenant-commander (LCdr) is the naval rank equal to major in the army or air force and is the first senior officer rank. Lieutenant commanders are senior to lieutenants (N) and to army and air force captains, and are junior to commanders and lieutenant colonels.

==United Kingdom==
===Royal Navy===

The insignia worn by a Royal Navy lieutenant commander is two medium gold braid stripes with one thin gold stripe running in between, placed upon a navy blue/black background. The top stripe has the ubiquitous loop used in all RN officer rank insignia, except for the rank of Midshipman. The RAF follows this pattern with its equivalent rank of squadron leader.

Having fewer officer ranks than the army, the RN previously split some of its ranks by seniority (time in rank) to provide equivalence: hence a lieutenant with fewer than eight years seniority wore two stripes, and ranked with an army captain; a lieutenant of eight years or more wore two stripes with a thinner one in between, and ranked with a major. This distinction was ostensibly abolished when the rank of lieutenant commander was introduced, although promotion to the latter rank for officers on a full career commission (FCC) was automatic following accumulation of eight years&#x27; seniority as a lieutenant. Automatic promotion officially ceased in the early 21st century and promotion is ostensibly now only awarded on merit.

===Royal Observer Corps===
Throughout much of its existence, the British Royal Observer Corps (ROC) maintained a rank of observer lieutenant commander. The ROC wore a Royal Air Force uniform and their rank insignia appeared similar to that of an RAF squadron leader except that the stripes were shown entirely in black. Prior to the renaming, the rank had been known as &quot;observer lieutenant (first class)&quot;.

==United States==

In the United States, the rank of lieutenant commander exists in the United States Navy, United States Coast Guard, United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps, and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Commissioned Officer Corps.

Within the U.S. Navy, lieutenant commanders are listed as junior officers. There are two insignia used by U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard lieutenant commanders. On service khakis and all working uniforms, lieutenant commanders wear a gold oak leaf collar device, similar to the ones worn by majors in the United States Air Force and United States Army, and identical to that worn by majors in the United States Marine Corps. In all dress uniforms, they wear sleeve braid or shoulder boards bearing a single gold quarter-inch stripe between two gold half-inch strips (nominal size). Above or inboard of the stripes, they wear their speciality insignia (i.e., a star for officers of the line, single oak leaf for medical with silver acorn for Medical Corps, crossed oak leaves for Civil Engineer Corps, United States shield for the Coast Guard, etc.) The Uniformed Services of the United States designate the rank as O-4.

<text>Second lieutenant is a junior commissioned officer military rank in many armed forces. The lowest officer rank, it is usually placed below lieutenant or first lieutenant.

==Australia==
The rank of second lieutenant existed in the military forces of the Australian colonies and Australian Army until 1986.

In the colonial forces, which closely followed the practices of the British military, the rank of second lieutenant began to replace ranks such as ensign and cornet from 1871.

New appointments to the rank of second lieutenant ceased in the regular army in 1986. Immediately prior to this change, the rank had been effectively reserved for new graduates from the Officer Cadet School, Portsea which closed in 1985. (Graduates of the Australian Defence Force Academy (ADFA) and the Royal Military College, Duntroon (RMC-D) are commissioned as lieutenants.). The rank of second lieutenant is only appointed to officers in special appointments such as training institutions, university regiments and while under probation during training. Trainees undertaking Special Service Officer (SSO) training are appointed at their officer rank prior to undertaking the training (usually as lieutenants or captains). This is different to General Service Officer (GSO) trainees who start off at the rank of officer cadet (ADFA/Australian Army Reserve officer trainees) or staff cadet (Royal Military College, Duntroon).

Ranks equivalent to second lieutenant are acting sub-lieutenant in the Royal Australian Navy and pilot officer in the Royal Australian Air Force.

==Canada==
The Canadian Forces adopted the rank with insignia of a single gold ring around the service dress uniform cuff for both army and air personnel upon unification in 1968 until the late 2000s. For a time, naval personnel used this rank but reverted to the Royal Canadian Navy rank of acting sub-lieutenant, though the CF green uniform was retained until the mid-1980s. Currently, the Canadian Army insignia for second lieutenant is a &quot;pip&quot; and the Royal Canadian Air Force insignia for lieutenant is one thick braid. The equivalent rank for the Royal Canadian Navy is acting sub-lieutenant. Also known as an Ensign in the Foot Guards units (Canadian Grenadier Guards &amp; Governor General&#x27;s Foot Guards).

==France==
&quot;Sous-lieutenant&quot; is the most junior commissioned rank in the modern French Army, Airforce and &quot;Gendarmerie&quot;. It dates historically from the late XVIth Century in the reign of Henry II of France. In 1674 this designation replaced that of ensign in the French infantry. By 1791 there were two &quot;sous-lieutenants&quot; in each company. After 1781 entry to this rank and beyond required four quartering of nobility - that is for all four grandparents to be recognised members of the aristocracy. The French Revolution substituted election by popular vote and later, under Napoleon, by graduation from officers&#x27; military schools or after four years of service as a &quot;sous-officer&quot; (NCO).

Until World War I &quot;sous-lieutenants&quot; were distinguished by a single gold fringed epaulette worn on the right shoulder (silver for cavalry). Modern rank insignia is reduced to a single braid stripe on each shoulder strap and (when worn) kepi.

==Indonesia==

In Indonesia, &quot;second lieutenant&quot; is known as &quot;letnan dua&quot; (&quot;letda&quot;) which is the most junior ranked officer in the Indonesian Military. Officers in the Indonesian National Armed Forces are commissioned through one of four major commissioning programs. Upon graduation the candidates are promoted to the rank of second lieutenant, thus becoming commissioned officers. The four programs are:
* National Armed Forces Academy (&quot;Akademi TNI&quot;): a four-year undergraduate program that emphasizes instruction in the arts, sciences, and professions, preparing men and women to take on the challenge of being officers in the armed forces (Army: Military Academy, Navy: Naval Academy, Air Force: Air Force Academy);
* Officer Candidate School: a 28-week program that is attended by senior NCOs or warrant officers from all services;
* Career Officer Program for college graduates: a 7–8 month program that is designed to recruit civilian professionals (e.g., doctors, dentists, pharmacists, psychologists) into the armed forces;
* Pilot Short Service School: a 34-month program to train pilots to serve in the armed forces.

==New Zealand==
Like many other Commonwealth countries, the rank structures of the New Zealand Defence Force usually follow British traditions. Hence the New Zealand Army maintains a rank of second lieutenant and the Royal New Zealand Air Force has its exact equivalent, pilot officer.

However, the Royal New Zealand Navy breaks with British tradition and uses the name ensign for its most junior commissioned officer rank (rather than the usual equivalents, such as acting sub-lieutenant or second lieutenant).

== United Kingdom and other Commonwealth countries ==
The rank of second lieutenant (2Lt) was introduced throughout the British Army in 1877 to replace the short-lived rank of sub-lieutenant, although it had long been used in the Royal Artillery, Royal Engineers, Fusilier and Rifle regiments. At first the rank bore no distinct insignia. The rank was abolished in 1881 but reintroduced in 1887. In 1902, a single Bath star was introduced; the ranks of lieutenant and captain had their number of stars increased by one to (respectively) two and three. The rank is also used by the Royal Marines.

New British Army officers are normally commissioned as second lieutenants at the end of their commissioning course at RMA Sandhurst, and continue with specific training with their units. Progression to lieutenant rank usually occurs after about a year. In the British armed forces, &quot;second lieutenant&quot; is a rank which is not used as a form of address. Instead a second lieutenant named, for example, &quot;Smith&quot; is addressed and referred to as &quot;Mr Smith&quot;, with the exception that the alternative titles &quot;ensign&quot; (Foot Guards) and &quot;cornet&quot; (in the Blues and Royals and Queen&#x27;s Royal Hussars) are still used.
In the Royal Air Force, the comparable rank is pilot officer. The equivalent in the Royal Navy is midshipman.

== United States ==

In the United States, second lieutenant is the normal entry-level rank for most commissioned officers in the Army, Marine Corps, Air Force, and Space Force. It is equivalent to the rank of ensign in the Navy, Coast Guard, Public Health Service Commissioned Corps, and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Commissioned Officer Corps.

In the Army and Marine Corps, a second lieutenant typically is a platoon leader who leads a platoon-size element, usually consisting of 16 to 44 soldiers or marines. A rifle platoon is composed of several squads with each squad led by a non-commissioned officer as squad leader. The second lieutenant is usually assisted by a platoon sergeant who advises and supports the platoon&#x27;s commanding officer in leading the unit.

In the Army, until December 1917, the rank bore no insignia other than a brown sleeve braid on blouses and an officer&#x27;s cap device and hat cord. In December 1917, a gold-colored bar similar to the silver-colored bar of a first lieutenant was introduced. In U.S. military slang, the rank is sometimes called &quot;butterbar&quot; or &quot;brown bar&quot; in reference to the insignia.
==Bangladesh==
The rank of second lieutenant has existed in the Bangladesh Army and Bangladesh Navy since the Liberation War. It is a rank below Lieutenant and a rank above Master Warrant Officer. In the army, a second lieutenant serves as the administrative officer or staff officer in a unit. In the Navy, the rank of second lieutenant does not exist. Its equivalent is Sub-lieutenant.

<text>The 2003 invasion of Iraq was the first stage of the Iraq War. The invasion began on 20 March 2003 and lasted just over one month, including 26 days of major combat operations, in which a United States-led combined force of troops from the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia and Poland invaded the Republic of Iraq. Twenty-two days after the first day of the invasion, the capital city of Baghdad was captured by coalition forces on 9 April after the six-day-long Battle of Baghdad. This early stage of the war formally ended on 1 May when U.S. President George W. Bush declared the &quot;end of major combat operations&quot; in his Mission Accomplished speech, after which the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) was established as the first of several successive transitional governments leading up to the first Iraqi parliamentary election in January 2005. U.S. military forces later remained in Iraq until the withdrawal in 2011.

The coalition sent 160,000 troops into Iraq during the initial invasion phase, which lasted from 19 March to 1 May. About 73% or 130,000 soldiers were American, with about 45,000 British soldiers (25%), 2,000 Australian soldiers (1%), and ~200 Polish JW GROM commandos (0.1%). Thirty-six other countries were involved in its aftermath. In preparation for the invasion, 100,000 U.S. troops assembled in Kuwait by 18 February. The coalition forces also received support from the Peshmerga in Iraqi Kurdistan.

According to U.S. President George W. Bush and UK Prime Minister Tony Blair, the coalition aimed &quot;to disarm Iraq of weapons of mass destruction [WMDs], to end Saddam Hussein&#x27;s support for terrorism, and to free the Iraqi people&quot;, even though the UN inspection team led by Hans Blix had declared it had found no evidence of the existence of WMDs just before the start of the invasion. Others place a much greater emphasis on the impact of the September 11 attacks, on the role this played in changing U.S. strategic calculations, and the rise of the freedom agenda. According to Blair, the trigger was Iraq&#x27;s failure to take a &quot;final opportunity&quot; to disarm itself of alleged nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons that U.S. and British officials called an immediate and intolerable threat to world peace.

In a January 2003 CBS poll, 64% of Americans had approved of military action against Iraq; however, 63% wanted Bush to find a diplomatic solution rather than go to war, and 62% believed the threat of terrorism directed against the U.S. would increase due to war. The invasion was strongly opposed by some long-standing U.S. allies, including the governments of France, Germany, and New Zealand. Their leaders argued that there was no evidence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and that invading that country was not justified in the context of UNMOVIC&#x27;s 12 February 2003 report. About 5,000 largely unusable chemical warheads, shells or aviation bombs were discovered during the Iraq War, but these had been built and abandoned earlier in Saddam Hussein&#x27;s rule before the 1991 Gulf War. The discoveries of these chemical weapons did not support the government&#x27;s invasion rationale. In September 2004, Kofi Annan, United Nations Secretary-General at the time, called the invasion illegal under international law and said it was a breach of the UN Charter.

On 15 February 2003, a month before the invasion, there were worldwide protests against the Iraq War, including a rally of three million people in Rome, which the Guinness World Records listed as the largest-ever anti-war rally. According to the French academic Dominique Reynié, between 3 January and 12 April 2003, 36 million people across the globe took part in almost 3,000 protests against the Iraq war.

The invasion was preceded by an airstrike on the Presidential Palace in Baghdad on 20 March 2003. The following day, coalition forces launched an incursion into Basra Governorate from their massing point close to the Iraqi-Kuwaiti border. While special forces launched an amphibious assault from the Persian Gulf to secure Basra and the surrounding petroleum fields, the main invasion army moved into southern Iraq, occupying the region and engaging in the Battle of Nasiriyah on 23 March. Massive air strikes across the country and against Iraqi command and control threw the defending army into chaos and prevented an effective resistance. On 26 March, the 173rd Airborne Brigade was airdropped near the northern city of Kirkuk, where they joined forces with Kurdish rebels and fought several actions against the Iraqi Army, to secure the northern part of the country.

The main body of coalition forces continued their drive into the heart of Iraq and were met with little resistance. Most of the Iraqi military was quickly defeated and the coalition occupied Baghdad on 9 April. Other operations occurred against pockets of the Iraqi Army, including the capture and occupation of Kirkuk on 10 April, and the attack on and capture of Tikrit on 15 April. Iraqi president Saddam Hussein and the central leadership went into hiding as the coalition forces completed the occupation of the country. On 1 May, President George W. Bush declared an end to major combat operations: this ended the invasion period and began the period of military occupation. Saddam Hussein was captured by U.S. forces on 13 December.

==Prelude to the invasion==

=== Pre-9/11 ===
Hostilities of the Gulf War were suspended on 28 February 1991, with a cease-fire negotiated between the UN coalition and Iraq. The U.S. and its allies tried to keep Saddam in check with military actions such as Operation Southern Watch, which was conducted by Joint Task Force Southwest Asia (JTF-SWA) with the mission of monitoring and controlling airspace south of the 32nd Parallel (extended to the 33rd Parallel in 1996) as well as using economic sanctions. It was revealed that a biological weapons (BW) program in Iraq had begun in the early 1980s with help from the U.S. and Europe who were unaware of Iraq&#x27;s intentions, in violation of the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) of 1972. Details of the BW program—along with a chemical weapons program—surfaced after the Gulf War (1990–91) following investigations conducted by the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) which had been charged with the post-war disarmament of Saddam&#x27;s Iraq. The investigation concluded that the program had not continued after the war. The U.S. and its allies then maintained a policy of &quot;containment&quot; towards Iraq. This policy involved numerous economic sanctions by the UN Security Council; the enforcement of Iraqi no-fly zones declared by the U.S. and the UK to protect the Kurds in Iraqi Kurdistan and Shias in the south from aerial attacks by the Iraqi government; and ongoing inspections. Iraqi military helicopters and planes regularly contested the no-fly zones.
In October 1998, removing the Iraqi government became official U.S. foreign policy with enactment of the Iraq Liberation Act. Enacted following the expulsion of UN weapons inspectors the preceding August (after some had been accused of spying for the U.S.), the act provided $97 million for Iraqi &quot;democratic opposition organizations&quot; to &quot;establish a program to support a transition to democracy in Iraq.&quot; This legislation contrasted with the terms set out in United Nations Security Council Resolution 687, which focused on weapons and weapons programs and made no mention of regime change. One month after the passage of the Iraq Liberation Act, the U.S. and UK launched a bombardment campaign of Iraq called Operation Desert Fox. The campaign&#x27;s express rationale was to hamper Saddam Hussein&#x27;s government&#x27;s ability to produce chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons, but U.S. intelligence personnel also hoped it would help weaken Saddam&#x27;s grip on power.
With the election of George W. Bush as president in 2000, the U.S. moved towards a more aggressive policy toward Iraq. The Republican Party&#x27;s campaign platform in the 2000 election called for &quot;full implementation&quot; of the Iraq Liberation Act as &quot;a starting point&quot; in a plan to &quot;remove&quot; Saddam. After leaving the George W. Bush administration, Treasury Secretary Paul O&#x27;Neill said that an attack on Iraq had been planned since Bush&#x27;s inauguration and that the first United States National Security Council meeting involved discussion of an invasion. O&#x27;Neill later backtracked, saying that these discussions were part of a continuation of foreign policy first put into place by the Clinton administration. Despite the Bush administration&#x27;s stated interest in invading Iraq, little formal movement towards an invasion occurred until the 11 September attacks.

=== 9/11 and immediate response ===

On the morning of 11 September 2001, the Islamist militant organization al-Qaeda executed four coordinated attacks against the United States utilizing hijacked jet airliners to crash into major symbols of American economic and military power. Nearly 3000 people would be killed, while more than 6000 were injured. National Security Agency (NSA) intercept data available by midday of the 11th pointed to al-Qaeda&#x27;s culpability in the attacks.

By mid-afternoon however, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld ordered the Pentagon to prepare plans for attacking Iraq. According to aides who were with him in the National Military Command Center on that day, Rumsfeld asked for: &quot;Best info fast. Judge whether good enough hit S.H.&quot; – meaning Saddam Hussein – &quot;at same time. Not only UBL&quot; (Osama bin Laden). 

On the evening of 12 September, President Bush ordered White House counter-terrorism coordinator Richard A. Clarke to investigate possible Iraqi involvement in the 9/11 attacks. Clarke&#x27;s office issued a memo on 18 September that noted wide ideological gaps between Iraq to al-Qaeda, and that only weak anecdotal evidence linked the two. Similarly, a 21 September President&#x27;s Daily Brief (prepared at Bush&#x27;s request) indicated that the U.S. intelligence community had no evidence linking Saddam Hussein to the attacks and there was &quot;scant credible evidence that Iraq had any significant collaborative ties with Al Qaeda.&quot; The PDB wrote off the few contacts that existed between Saddam&#x27;s government and al-Qaeda as attempts to monitor the group, not work with it.

However, Vice President Dick Cheney and Defense Secretary Rumsfeld expressed skepticism toward&#x27;s the CIA&#x27;s intelligence. They questioned whether the CIA were competent enough to produce accurate information as the agency underestimated threats and failed to accurately predict events such as the Iranian Revolution, the Iraqi Invasion of Kuwait, and the collapse of the Soviet Union. They instead preferred outside analysis, of which information was supplied by the Iraqi National Congress. This information alleged that a highly secretive relationship existed between Saddam and al-Qaeda from 1992, specifically through a series of meetings reportedly involving the Iraqi Intelligence Service (IIS). The rationale for invading Iraq as a response to 9/11 has been widely questioned, as there was no cooperation between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda.

On 20 September 2001, Bush addressed a joint session of Congress (telecast live to the world), and announced his new &quot;War on Terror&quot;. This announcement was accompanied by the doctrine of &quot;pre-emptive&quot; military action, later termed the Bush Doctrine. On 21 November, Bush spoke with Rumsfeld and instructed him to conduct a confidential review of OPLAN 1003, the war plan for invading Iraq. Rumsfeld met with General Tommy Franks, the commander of US Central Command, on 27 November to go over the plans. A record of the meeting includes the question &quot;How start?&quot;, listing multiple possible justifications for a US–Iraq War. Some Bush advisers favored an immediate invasion of Iraq, while others advocated building an international coalition and obtaining United Nations authorization. Bush eventually decided to seek UN authorization, while still reserving the option of invading without it.

General David Petraeus recalled in an interview his experience during the time before the invasion, stating that &quot;When we were getting ready for what became the invasion of Iraq, the prevailing wisdom was that we were going to have a long, hard fight to Baghdad, and it was really going to be hard to take Baghdad. The road to deployment, which was a very compressed road for the 101st Airborne Division, started with a seminar on military operations in urban terrain, because that was viewed as the decisive event in the takedown of the regime in Iraq — that and finding and destroying the weapons of mass destruction.&quot;

===Political preparations for war===
While there had been some earlier talk of action against Iraq, the Bush administration waited until September 2002 to call for action, with White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card saying, &quot;From a marketing point of view, you don&#x27;t introduce new products in August.&quot; Bush began formally making his case to the international community for an invasion of Iraq in his 12 September 2002 address to the United Nations General Assembly. Benjamin Netanyahu testified before US Congress on September 12, 2002 with an expert testimony, encouraging America to invade Iraq and stating that there is &quot;no question&quot; that Saddam is working on WMDs.

The United Kingdom agreed with the U.S. actions, while France and Germany were critical of plans to invade Iraq, arguing instead for continued diplomacy and weapons inspections. After considerable debate, the UN Security Council adopted a compromise resolution, UN Security Council Resolution 1441, which authorized the resumption of weapons inspections and promised &quot;serious consequences&quot; for non-compliance. Security Council members France and Russia made clear that they did not consider these consequences to include the use of force to overthrow the Iraqi government. Both the U.S. ambassador to the UN, John Negroponte, and the UK ambassador, Jeremy Greenstock, publicly confirmed this reading of the resolution, assuring that Resolution 1441 provided no &quot;automaticity&quot; or &quot;hidden triggers&quot; for an invasion without further consultation of the Security Council.

Resolution 1441 gave Iraq &quot;a final opportunity to comply with its disarmament obligations&quot; and set up inspections by the United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC) and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Saddam accepted the resolution on 13 November and inspectors returned to Iraq under the direction of UNMOVIC chairman Hans Blix and IAEA Director-General Mohamed ElBaradei. As of February 2003, the IAEA &quot;found no evidence or plausible indication of the revival of a nuclear weapons program in Iraq&quot;; the IAEA concluded that certain items which could have been used in nuclear enrichment centrifuges, such as aluminum tubes, were in fact intended for other uses. UNMOVIC &quot;did not find evidence of the continuation or resumption of programs of weapons of mass destruction&quot; or significant quantities of proscribed items. UNMOVIC did supervise the destruction of a small number of empty chemical rocket warheads, 50 liters of mustard gas that had been declared by Iraq and sealed by UNSCOM in 1998, and laboratory quantities of a mustard gas precursor, along with about 50 Al-Samoud missiles of a design that Iraq stated did not exceed the permitted 150 km range, but which had traveled up to 183 km in tests. Shortly before the invasion, UNMOVIC stated that it would take &quot;months&quot; to verify Iraqi compliance with resolution 1441.

In October 2002, the U.S. Congress passed the Iraq Resolution, which authorized the President to &quot;use any means necessary&quot; against Iraq. Americans polled in January 2003 widely favored further diplomacy over an invasion. Later that year, however, Americans began to agree with Bush&#x27;s plan. The U.S. government engaged in an elaborate domestic public relations campaign to market the war to its citizens. Americans overwhelmingly believed Saddam did have weapons of mass destruction: 85% said so, even though the inspectors had not uncovered those weapons. Of those who thought Iraq had weapons sequestered somewhere, about half responded that said weapons would not be found in combat. By February 2003, 64% of Americans supported taking military action to remove Saddam from power.
In the 2003 State of the Union address, President Bush said &quot;we know that Iraq, in the late 1990s, had several mobile biological weapons labs&quot;. On 5 February 2003, U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell addressed the United Nations General Assembly, continuing U.S. efforts to gain UN authorization for an invasion. His presentation to the UN Security Council contained a computer-generated image of a &quot;mobile biological weapons laboratory&quot;. However, this information was based on claims of Rafid Ahmed Alwan al-Janabi, codenamed &quot;Curveball&quot;, an Iraqi emigrant living in Germany who later admitted that his claims had been false.

Powell also presented false assertions alleging Iraq had ties to al-Qaeda. As a follow-up to Powell&#x27;s presentation, the United States, United Kingdom, Poland, Italy, Australia, Denmark, Japan, and Spain proposed a resolution authorizing the use of force in Iraq, but Canada, France, and Germany, together with Russia, strongly urged continued diplomacy. Facing a losing vote as well as a likely veto from France and Russia, the US, UK, Poland, Spain, Denmark, Italy, Japan, and Australia eventually withdrew their resolution.

Opposition to the invasion coalesced in the worldwide 15 February 2003 anti-war protest that attracted between six and ten million people in more than 800 cities, the largest such protest in human history according to the Guinness Book of World Records.
On 16 March 2003, Spanish Prime Minister José María Aznar, UK Prime Minister Tony Blair, President of the United States George W. Bush, and Prime Minister of Portugal José Manuel Durão Barroso as host met in the Azores to discuss the invasion of Iraq and Spain&#x27;s potential involvement in the war, as well as the beginning of the invasion. This encounter was extremely controversial in Spain, even now remaining a very sensitive point for the Aznar government. Almost a year later, Madrid suffered the worst terrorist attack in Europe since the Lockerbie bombing, motivated by Spain&#x27;s decision to participate in the Iraq war, prompting some Spaniards to accuse the Prime Minister of being responsible.

In March 2003, the United States, United Kingdom, Poland, Australia, Spain, Denmark, and Italy began preparing for the invasion of Iraq, with a host of public relations and military moves. In his 17 March 2003 address to the nation, Bush demanded that Saddam and his two sons, Uday and Qusay, surrender and leave Iraq, giving them a 48-hour deadline.

The UK House of Commons held a debate on going to war on 18 March 2003 where the government motion was approved 412 to 149. The vote was a key moment in the history of the Blair administration, as the number of government MPs who rebelled against the vote was the greatest since the repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846. Three government ministers resigned in protest at the war, John Denham, Lord Hunt of Kings Heath, and the then Leader of the House of Commons Robin Cook. In a passionate speech to the House of Commons after his resignation, he said, &quot;What has come to trouble me is the suspicion that if the &#x27;hanging chads&#x27; of Florida had gone the other way and Al Gore had been elected, we would not now be about to commit British troops to action in Iraq.&quot; During the debate, it was stated that the Attorney General had advised that the war was legal under previous UN Resolutions.

==Attempts to avoid war==

In December 2002, a representative of the head of Iraqi Intelligence, the General Tahir Jalil Habbush al-Tikriti, contacted former Central Intelligence Agency Counterterrorism Department head Vincent Cannistraro stating that Saddam &quot;knew there was a campaign to link him to 11 September and prove he had weapons of mass destruction (WMDs).&quot; Cannistraro further added that &quot;the Iraqis were prepared to satisfy these concerns. I reported the conversation to senior levels of the state department and I was told to stand aside and they would handle it.&quot; Cannistraro stated that the offers made were all &quot;killed&quot; by the George W. Bush administration because they allowed Saddam to remain in power, an outcome viewed as unacceptable. It has been suggested that Saddam Hussein was prepared to go into exile if allowed to keep US$1 billion.

Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak&#x27;s national security advisor, Osama El-Baz, sent a message to the U.S. State Department that the Iraqis wanted to discuss the accusations that the country had weapons of mass destruction and ties with Al-Qaeda. Iraq also attempted to reach the U.S. through the Syrian, French, German, and Russian intelligence services.

In January 2003, Lebanese-American Imad Hage met with Michael Maloof of the U.S. Department of Defense&#x27;s Office of Special Plans. Hage, a resident of Beirut, had been recruited by the department to assist in the war on terror. He reported that Mohammed Nassif, a close aide to Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, had expressed frustrations about the difficulties of Syria contacting the United States, and had attempted to use him as an intermediary. Maloof arranged for Hage to meet with civilian Richard Perle, then head of the Defense Policy Board.

In January 2003, Hage met with the chief of Iraqi intelligence&#x27;s foreign operations, Hassan al-Obeidi. Obeidi told Hage that Baghdad did not understand why they were targeted and that they had no WMDs. He then made the offer for Washington to send in 2000 FBI agents to confirm this. He additionally offered petroleum concessions but stopped short of having Saddam give up power, instead suggesting that elections could be held in two years. Later, Obeidi suggested that Hage travel to Baghdad for talks; he accepted.

Later that month, Hage met with General Habbush and Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz. He was offered top priority to U.S. firms in oil and mining rights, UN-supervised elections, U.S. inspections (with up to 5,000 inspectors), to have al-Qaeda agent Abdul Rahman Yasin (in Iraqi custody since 1994) handed over as a sign of good faith, and to give &quot;full support for any U.S. plan&quot; in the Israeli–Palestinian peace process. They also wished to meet with high-ranking U.S. officials. On 19 February, Hage faxed Maloof his report of the trip. Maloof reports having brought the proposal to Jaymie Duran. The Pentagon denies that either Wolfowitz or Rumsfeld, Duran&#x27;s bosses, were aware of the plan.

On 21 February, Maloof informed Duran in an email that Richard Perle wished to meet with Hage and the Iraqis if the Pentagon would clear it. Duran responded &quot;Mike, working this. Keep this close hold.&quot; On 7 March, Perle met with Hage in Knightsbridge, and stated that he wanted to pursue the matter further with people in Washington (both have acknowledged the meeting). A few days later, he informed Hage that Washington refused to let him meet with Habbush to discuss the offer (Hage stated that Perle&#x27;s response was &quot;that the consensus in Washington was it was a no-go&quot;). Perle told &quot;The Times&quot;, &quot;The message was &#x27;Tell them that we will see them in Baghdad.′&quot;

==Casus belli and rationale==
According to General Tommy Franks, the objectives of the invasion were, &quot;First, end the regime of Saddam Hussein. Second, to identify, isolate and eliminate Iraq&#x27;s weapons of mass destruction. Third, to search for, to capture, and to drive out terrorists from that country. Fourth, to collect such intelligence as we can related to terrorist networks. Fifth, to collect such intelligence as we can related to the global network of illicit weapons of mass destruction. Sixth, to end sanctions and to immediately deliver humanitarian support to the displaced and to many needy Iraqi citizens. Seventh, to secure Iraq&#x27;s oil fields and resources, which belong to the Iraqi people. And last, to help the Iraqi people create conditions for a transition to a representative self-government.&quot;

Throughout 2002, the Bush administration insisted that removing Saddam from power to restore international peace and security was a major goal. The principal stated justifications for this policy of &quot;regime change&quot; were that Iraq&#x27;s continuing production of weapons of mass destruction and known ties to terrorist organizations, as well as Iraq&#x27;s continued violations of UN Security Council resolutions, amounted to a threat to the U.S. and the world community.

George W. Bush, speaking in October 2002, said that &quot;The stated policy of the United States is regime change. ... However, if Saddam were to meet all the conditions of the United Nations, the conditions that I have described very clearly in terms that everybody can understand, that in itself will signal the regime has changed.&quot; Citing reports from certain intelligence sources, Bush stated on 6 March 2003 that he believed that Saddam was not complying with UN Resolution 1441.

===Weapons of mass destruction===

The main allegations were: that Saddam possessed or was attempting to produce weapons of mass destruction, which Saddam Hussein had used in places such as Halabja, possessed, and made efforts to acquire, particularly considering two previous attacks on Baghdad nuclear weapons production facilities by both Iran and Israel which were alleged to have postponed weapons development progress; and, further, that he had ties to terrorists, specifically al-Qaeda.


The Bush administration&#x27;s overall rationale for the invasion of Iraq was presented in detail by U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell to the United Nations Security Council on 5 February 2003. In summary, he stated,
In September 2002, Tony Blair stated, in an answer to a parliamentary question, that &quot;Regime change in Iraq would be a wonderful thing. That is not the purpose of our action; our purpose is to disarm Iraq of weapons of mass destruction...&quot; In November of that year, Blair further stated that, &quot;So far as our objective, it is disarmament, not regime change – that is our objective. Now I happen to believe the regime of Saddam is a very brutal and repressive regime, I think it does enormous damage to the Iraqi people ... so I have got no doubt Saddam is very bad for Iraq, but on the other hand I have got no doubt either that the purpose of our challenge from the United Nations is the disarmament of weapons of mass destruction, it is not regime change.&quot;

At a press conference on 31 January 2003, Bush again reiterated that the single trigger for the invasion would be Iraq&#x27;s failure to disarm, &quot;Saddam Hussein must understand that if he does not disarm, for the sake of peace, we, along with others, will go disarm Saddam Hussein.&quot; As late as 25 February 2003, it was still the official line that the only cause of invasion would be a failure to disarm. As Blair made clear in a statement to the House of Commons, &quot;I detest his regime. But even now he can save it by complying with the UN&#x27;s demand. Even now, we are prepared to go the extra step to achieve disarmament peacefully.&quot;

In September 2002, the Bush administration said attempts by Iraq to acquire thousands of high-strength aluminum tubes pointed to a clandestine program to make enriched uranium for nuclear bombs. Powell, in his address to the UN Security Council just before the war, referred to the aluminum tubes. A report released by the Institute for Science and International Security in 2002, however, reported that it was highly unlikely that the tubes could be used to enrich uranium. Powell later admitted he had presented an inaccurate case to the United Nations on Iraqi weapons, based on sourcing that was wrong and in some cases &quot;deliberately misleading.&quot;

The Bush administration asserted that the Saddam government had sought to purchase yellowcake uranium from Niger. On 7 March 2003, the U.S. submitted intelligence documents as evidence to the International Atomic Energy Agency. These documents were dismissed by the IAEA as forgeries, with the concurrence in that judgment of outside experts. At the time, a US official stated that the evidence was submitted to the IAEA without knowledge of its provenance and characterized any mistakes as &quot;more likely due to incompetence not malice&quot;.

Since the invasion, the U.S. government statements concerning Iraqi weapons programs and links to al-Qaeda have been discredited, though chemical weapons were found in Iraq during the occupation period. While the debate of whether Iraq intended to develop chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons in the future remains open, no WMDs have been found in Iraq since the invasion despite comprehensive inspections lasting more than 18 months. In Cairo, on 24 February 2001, Colin Powell had predicted as much, saying, &quot;[Saddam] has not developed any significant capability with respect to weapons of mass destruction. He is unable to project conventional power against his neighbours.&quot;

===Connection to terrorists===

Another justification included the alleged connection between the regime of Saddam Hussein and that of terrorist organizations such as Al-Qaeda that had attacked the United States during the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.

While it never made an explicit connection between Iraq and the 11 September attacks, the George W. Bush administration repeatedly insinuated a link, thereby creating a false impression for the U.S. public. Grand jury testimony from the 1993 World Trade Center bombing trials cited numerous direct linkages from the bombers to Baghdad and Department 13 of the Iraqi Intelligence Service in that initial attack marking the second anniversary to vindicate the surrender of Iraqi armed forces in Operation Desert Storm. The Iraqi National Congress alleged that Saddam was collaborating with al-Qaeda from 1992 via the Iraqi Intelligence Service (IIS). For example, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; has noted that,

Steven Kull, director of the Program on International Policy Attitudes (PIPA) at the University of Maryland, observed in March 2003 that &quot;[t]he administration has succeeded in creating a sense that there is some connection [between 11 Sept. and Saddam Hussein]&quot;. This was after a &quot;New York Times&quot;/CBS poll showed that 45% of Americans believed Saddam Hussein was &quot;personally involved&quot; in the 11 September atrocities. As &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot; observed at the time, while &quot;[s]ources knowledgeable about U.S. intelligence say there is no evidence that Saddam played a role in the 11 Sept. attacks, nor that he has been or is currently aiding Al Qaeda. ... the White House appears to be encouraging this false impression, as it seeks to maintain American support for a possible war against Iraq and demonstrate seriousness of purpose to Saddam&#x27;s regime.&quot; The CSM went on to report that, while polling data collected &quot;right after 11 Sept. 2001&quot; showed that only 3 percent mentioned Iraq or Saddam Hussein, attitudes &quot;had been transformed&quot; by January 2003, with a Knight Ridder poll showing that 44% of Americans believed &quot;most&quot; or &quot;some&quot; of the 11 September hijackers were Iraqi citizens.

The BBC has also noted that, while President Bush &quot;never directly accused the former Iraqi leader of having a hand in the attacks on New York and Washington&quot;, he &quot;repeatedly associated the two in keynote addresses delivered since 11 September&quot;, adding that &quot;Senior members of his administration have similarly conflated the two.&quot; For instance, the BBC report quotes Colin Powell in February 2003, stating that &quot;We&#x27;ve learned that Iraq has trained al-Qaeda members in bomb-making and poisons and deadly gases. And we know that after September 11, Saddam Hussein&#x27;s regime gleefully celebrated the terrorist attacks on America.&quot; The same BBC report also noted the results of a recent opinion poll, which suggested that &quot;70% of Americans believe the Iraqi leader was personally involved in the attacks.&quot;

Also in September 2003, &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; reported that &quot;Vice President Dick Cheney, anxious to defend the White House foreign policy amid ongoing violence in Iraq, stunned intelligence analysts and even members of his own administration this week by failing to dismiss a widely discredited claim: that Saddam Hussein might have played a role in the 11 Sept. attacks.&quot; A year later, presidential candidate John Kerry alleged that Cheney was continuing &quot;to intentionally mislead the American public by drawing a link between Saddam Hussein and 9/11 in an attempt to make the invasion of Iraq part of the global war on terror.&quot;

Since the invasion, assertions of operational links between the Iraqi regime and al-Qaeda have largely been discredited by the intelligence community, and Secretary Powell himself later admitted he had no proof.

===Iraqi drones===
In October 2002, a few days before the US Senate vote on the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution, about 75 senators were told in closed session that the Iraqi government had the means of delivering biological and chemical weapons of mass destruction by unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) drones that could be launched from ships off the US&#x27; Atlantic coast to attack US eastern seaboard cities. Colin Powell suggested in his presentation to the United Nations that UAVs were transported out of Iraq and could be launched against the United States.

In fact, Iraq had no offensive UAV fleet or any capability of putting UAVs on ships. Iraq&#x27;s UAV fleet consisted of less than a handful of outdated Czech training drones. At the time, there was a vigorous dispute within the intelligence community whether the CIA&#x27;s conclusions about Iraq&#x27;s UAV fleet were accurate. The US Air Force denied outright that Iraq possessed any offensive UAV capability.

===Human rights===

Additional justifications used at various times included Iraqi violation of UN resolutions, the Iraqi government&#x27;s repression of its citizens, and Iraqi violations of the 1991 cease-fire.

As evidence supporting U.S. and British charges about Iraqi Weapons of mass destruction and links to terrorism weakened, some supporters of the invasion have increasingly shifted their justification to the human rights violations of the Saddam government. Leading human rights groups such as Human Rights Watch have argued, however, that they believe human rights concerns were never a central justification for the invasion, nor do they believe that military intervention was justifiable on humanitarian grounds, most significantly because &quot;the killing in Iraq at the time was not of the exceptional nature that would justify such intervention.&quot;

==Legality of invasion==



=== US domestic law ===
The Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002 was passed by Congress with Republicans voting 98% in favor in the Senate, and 97% in favor in the House. Democrats supported the joint resolution 58% and 39% in the Senate and House respectively. The resolution asserts the authorization by the Constitution of the United States and the Congress for the President to fight anti-United States terrorism. Citing the Iraq Liberation Act of 1998, the resolution reiterated that it should be the policy of the United States to remove the Saddam Hussein regime and promote a democratic replacement.

The resolution &quot;supported&quot; and &quot;encouraged&quot; diplomatic efforts by President George W. Bush to &quot;strictly enforce through the U.N. Security Council all relevant Security Council resolutions regarding Iraq&quot; and &quot;obtain prompt and decisive action by the Security Council to ensure that Iraq abandons its strategy of delay, evasion, and noncompliance and promptly and strictly complies with all relevant Security Council resolutions regarding Iraq.&quot; The resolution authorized President Bush to use the Armed Forces of the United States &quot;as he determines to be necessary and appropriate&quot; to &quot;defend the national security of the United States against the continuing threat posed by Iraq; and enforce all relevant United Nations Security Council Resolutions regarding Iraq.&quot;

=== International law ===
The legality of the invasion of Iraq under international law has been challenged since its inception on a number of fronts, and several prominent supporters of the invasion in all the invading states have publicly and privately cast doubt on its legality. It has been argued by US and British governments that the invasion was fully legal because authorization was implied by the United Nations Security Council. International legal experts, including the International Commission of Jurists, a group of 31 leading Canadian law professors, and the U.S.-based Lawyers Committee on Nuclear Policy, have denounced this rationale.

On Thursday 20 November 2003, an article published in &quot;The Guardian&quot; alleged that Richard Perle, a senior member of the administration&#x27;s Defense Policy Board Advisory Committee, conceded that the invasion was illegal but still justified.

The United Nations Security Council has passed nearly 60 resolutions on Iraq and Kuwait since Iraq&#x27;s invasion of Kuwait in 1990. The most relevant to this issue is Resolution 678, passed on 29 November 1990. It authorizes &quot;member states co-operating with the Government of Kuwait ... to use all necessary means&quot; to (1) implement Security Council Resolution 660 and other resolutions calling for the end of Iraq&#x27;s occupation of Kuwait and withdrawal of Iraqi forces from Kuwaiti territory and (2) &quot;restore international peace and security in the area.&quot; Resolution 678 has not been rescinded or nullified by succeeding resolutions and Iraq was not alleged after 1991 to invade Kuwait or to threaten to do so.

Resolution 1441 was most prominent during the run-up to the war and formed the main backdrop for Secretary of State Colin Powell&#x27;s address to the Security Council one month before the invasion. According to an independent commission of inquiry set up by the government of the Netherlands, UN resolution 1441 &quot;cannot reasonably be interpreted (as the Dutch government did) as authorising individual member states to use military force to compel Iraq to comply with the Security Council&#x27;s resolutions.&quot; Accordingly, the Dutch commission concluded that the 2003 invasion violated international law.

At the same time, Bush Administration officials advanced a parallel legal argument using the earlier resolutions, which authorized force in response to Iraq&#x27;s 1990 invasion of Kuwait. Under this reasoning, by failing to disarm and submit to weapons inspections, Iraq was in violation of U.N. Security Council Resolutions 660 and 678, and the U.S. could legally compel Iraq&#x27;s compliance through military means.

Critics and proponents of the legal rationale based on the U.N. resolutions argue that the legal right to determine how to enforce its resolutions lies with the Security Council alone, not with individual nations and therefore the invasion of Iraq was not legal under international law, and in direct violation of Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter.

In February 2006, Luis Moreno Ocampo, the lead prosecutor for the International Criminal Court, reported that he had received 240 separate communications regarding the legality of the war, many of which concerned British participation in the invasion. In a letter addressed to the complainants, Mr. Moreno Ocampo explained that he could only consider issues related to conduct during the war and not to its underlying legality as a possible crime of aggression because no provision had yet been adopted which &quot;defines the crime and sets out the conditions under which the Court may exercise jurisdiction with respect to it.&quot; In a March 2007 interview with &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot;, Moreno Ocampo encouraged Iraq to sign up with the court so that it could bring cases related to alleged war crimes.

United States Ohio Congressman Dennis Kucinich held a press conference on the evening of 24 April 2007, revealing US House Resolution 333 and the three articles of impeachment against Vice President Dick Cheney. He charged Cheney with manipulating the evidence of Iraq&#x27;s weapons program, deceiving the public about Iraq&#x27;s connection to al-Qaeda, and threatening aggression against Iran in violation of the United Nations Charter.

==Military aspects==
===Multilateral support===

In November 2002, President George W. Bush, visiting Europe for a NATO summit, declared that, &quot;should Iraqi President Saddam Hussein choose not to disarm, the United States will lead a coalition of the willing to disarm him.&quot; Thereafter, the Bush administration briefly used the term &quot;coalition of the willing&quot; to refer to the countries who supported, militarily or verbally, the military action in Iraq and subsequent military presence in post-invasion Iraq since 2003. The original list prepared in March 2003 included 49 members. Of those 49, only six besides the U.S. contributed troops to the invasion force (the United Kingdom, Australia, Poland, Spain, Portugal, and Denmark), and 33 provided some number of troops to support the occupation after the invasion was complete. Six members have no military, meaning that they withheld troops completely.

===Invasion force===
A U.S. Central Command, Combined Forces Air Component Commander report, indicated that, as of 30 April 2003, 466,985 U.S. personnel were deployed for the invasion of Iraq. This included;

Ground forces element: 336,797 personnel
* U.S. Army, 233,342
* U.S. Army Reserve, 10,683
* Army National Guard, 8,866
* U.S. Marines, 74,405
* U.S. Marine Reserve, 9,501
Air forces element: 64,246 personnel
* U.S. Air Force, 54,955
* U.S. Air Force Reserve, 2,084
* Air National Guard, 7,207
Naval forces element: 63,352 personnel
* U.S. Navy, 61,296, including 681 members of the U.S. Coast Guard
* U.S. Navy Reserve, 2,056

Approximately 148,000 soldiers from the United States, 50,000 British soldiers, 2,000 Australian soldiers and 194 Polish soldiers from the special forces unit GROM were sent to Kuwait for the invasion. The invasion force was also supported by Iraqi Kurdish Peshmerga fighters, estimated to number upwards of 70,000. In the latter stages of the invasion, 620 troops of the Iraqi National Congress opposition group were deployed to southern Iraq.

Canada discreetly contributed some military resources towards the campaign, such as personnel from the Royal Canadian Air Force who crewed American planes on missions in Iraq to train with the platforms, and eleven Canadian aircrew who manned AWACS aircraft. The Canadian Armed Forces had ships, planes, and 1,200 Royal Canadian Navy personnel at the mouth of the Persian Gulf to help support Operation Enduring Freedom, and a secret U.S. briefing cable noted that despite public promises by Canadian officials that these assets would not be used in support of the war in Iraq, &quot;they will also be available to provide escort services in the Straits and will otherwise be discreetly useful to the military effort.&quot; However, the Department of National Defence issued an order to naval commanders to not do anything in support of the American-led operation, and it is not known whether this order was ever broken. Eugene Lang, chief of staff to then-defence minister John McCallum, stated that it is &quot;quite possible&quot; that Canadian forces indirectly supported the American operation. According to Lang, Canada&#x27;s military strongly advocated to be involved in the Iraqi War instead of the war in Afghanistan, and Canada mainly decided to keep its assets in the Gulf to maintain good relations with America. After the invasion, Brigadier General Walter Natynczyk, of the Canadian Army, served as Deputy Commanding General of the Multi-National Corps – Iraq, which comprised 35,000 American soldiers in ten brigades spread across Iraq.

Plans to open a second front in the north were severely hampered when Turkey refused the use of its territory for such purposes. In response to Turkey&#x27;s decision, the United States dropped several thousand paratroopers from the 173rd Airborne Brigade into northern Iraq, a number significantly less than the 15,000-strong 4th Infantry Division that the U.S. originally planned to deploy to the northern front.

===Defending force===
The number of personnel in the Iraqi military before the war was uncertain, but it was believed to have been poorly equipped. The International Institute for Strategic Studies estimated the Iraqi armed forces to number 389,000 (Iraqi Army 350,000, Iraqi Navy 2,000, Iraqi Air Force 20,000 and air defense 17,000), the paramilitary Fedayeen Saddam 44,000, Republican Guard 80,000 and reserves 650,000.

Another estimate numbers the Army and Republican Guard at between 280,000 and 350,000 and 50,000 to 80,000, respectively, and the paramilitary between 20,000 and 40,000. There were an estimated thirteen infantry divisions, ten mechanized and armored divisions, as well as some special forces units. The Iraqi Air Force and Navy played a negligible role in the conflict.

During the invasion, foreign volunteers traveled to Iraq from Syria and took part in the fighting, usually commanded by the Fedayeen Saddam. It is not known for certain how many foreign fighters fought in Iraq in 2003, however, intelligence officers of the U.S. First Marine Division estimated that 50% of all Iraqi combatants in central Iraq were foreigners.

In addition, the Kurdish Islamist militant group Ansar al-Islam controlled a small section of northern Iraq in an area outside Saddam Hussein&#x27;s control. Ansar al-Islam had been fighting against secular Kurdish forces since 2001. At the time of the invasion they fielded about 600 to 800 fighters. Ansar al-Islam was led by the Jordanian-born militant Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, who would later become an important leader in the Iraqi insurgency. Ansar al-Islam was driven out of Iraq in late March by a joint American-Kurdish force during Operation Viking Hammer.

===Military equipment===
====Depleted uranium====
According to information provided to the Dutch Ministry of Defence by American forces, it is estimated that more than 300,000 depleted uranium rounds were fired during the invasion, many in or near populated areas of Iraq, including Samawah, Nasiriyah, and Basra, the vast majority by US forces. In the information, the US forces provided the Dutch Ministry of Defense with the GPS coordinates of the DU rounds, along with a list of targets and numbers fired. Then, the Dutch Ministry of Defence released the data to Dutch peace group Pax under the Freedom of Information Act.

====Incendiary weapons====
US forces used white phosphorus and Napalm as incendiary weapons during the Battle of Mosul and Second Battle of Fallujah in 2004. On the March 2005, Field artillery, a magazine published by the US Army, published reports of the use of white phosphorus in the battle for Fallujah. the British Ministry of Defence confirmed the use of Mark 77 bomb by US forces during the war.

==== Cluster munitions ====
US-led coalition forces used 61,000 cluster munitions containing 20 million submunitions during the 1991 Gulf War, and 13,000 cluster munitions containing two million submunitions during the 2003 invasion and subsequent insurgency. Thousands of unexploded munitions from the invasion and previous wars, including cluster munitions, mines and other unexploded ordnance, still posed a threat to civilians as of 2022.

===Military preparations===


==== Special operations forces ====
CIA Special Activities Division (SAD) and MI6 (E Squadron) paramilitary teams entered Iraq in July 2002 before the 2003 invasion. Once on the ground they prepared for the subsequent arrival of US and British military forces. SAD teams then combined with U.S. Army Special Forces to organize the Kurdish Peshmerga. This joint team combined to defeat Ansar al-Islam, an ally of Al Qaeda, in a battle in the northeast corner of Iraq. A chemical weapons facility at Sargat was also captured. Sargat was the only facility of its type discovered in the Iraq war. The U.S. side was carried out by Paramilitary Officers from SAD and the Army&#x27;s 10th Special Forces Group.

SAD teams also conducted high-risk special reconnaissance missions behind Iraqi lines to identify senior leadership targets. These missions led to the initial strikes against Saddam Hussein and his key generals. Although the initial strikes against Saddam were unsuccessful in killing the dictator or his generals, they were successful in effectively ending the ability to command and control Iraqi forces. Other strikes against key generals were successful and significantly degraded the command&#x27;s ability to react to and maneuver against the U.S.-led invasion force coming from the south.

SAD operations officers were also successful in convincing key Iraqi army officers to surrender their units once the fighting started or not to oppose the invasion force. NATO member Turkey refused to allow its territory to be used for the invasion. As a result, the SAD/SOG and U.S. Army Special Forces joint teams and the Kurdish Peshmerga constituted the entire northern force against government forces during the invasion. Their efforts kept the 5th Corps of the Iraqi army in place to defend against the Kurds rather than moving to contest the coalition force in the south. Four of these CIA officers were awarded the Intelligence Star for their actions.

MI6 conducted Operation Mass Appeal which was a campaign to plant stories about Iraq&#x27;s WMDs in the media and boost support for the invasion. MI6 also went on to bribe many of Saddam&#x27;s closest allies to turn over information and intelligence.

According to General Tommy Franks, April Fool, an American officer working undercover as a diplomat, was approached by an Iraqi intelligence agent. April Fool then sold the Iraqi false &quot;top secret&quot; invasion plans provided by Franks&#x27; team. This deception misled the Iraqi military into deploying major forces in northern and western Iraq in anticipation of attacks by way of Turkey or Jordan, which never took place. This greatly reduced the defensive capacity in the rest of Iraq and facilitated the actual attacks via Kuwait and the Persian Gulf in the southeast.

==== No-fly zones ====

Since the 1991 Gulf War, the U.S. and UK had been attacked by Iraqi air defenses while enforcing Iraqi no-fly zones. These zones, and the attacks to enforce them, were described as illegal by the former UN Secretary General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, and the French foreign minister Hubert Vedrine. Other countries, notably Russia and China, also condemned the zones as a violation of Iraqi sovereignty. In mid-2002, the U.S. began more carefully selecting targets in the southern part of the country to disrupt the military command structure in Iraq. A change in enforcement tactics was acknowledged at the time, but it was not made public that this was part of a plan known as Operation Southern Focus.

The amount of ordnance dropped on Iraqi positions by coalition aircraft in 2001 and 2002 was less than in 1999 and 2000 which was during the Clinton administration. However, information obtained by the UK Liberal Democrats showed that the UK dropped twice as many bombs on Iraq in the second half of 2002 as they did during the whole of 2001. The tonnage of UK bombs dropped increased from 0 in March 2002 and 0.3 in April 2002 to between 7 and 14 tons per month in May–August, reaching a pre-war peak of 54.6 tons in September – before the U.S. Congress&#x27; 11 October authorization of the invasion.

The 5 September attacks included a 100+ aircraft attack on the main air defense site in western Iraq. According to an editorial in &quot;New Statesman&quot; this was &quot;Located at the furthest extreme of the southern no-fly zone, far away from the areas that needed to be patrolled to prevent attacks on the Shias, it was destroyed not because it was a threat to the patrols, but to allow allied special forces operating from Jordan to enter Iraq undetected.&quot;

Tommy Franks, who commanded the invasion of Iraq, has since admitted that the bombing was designed to &quot;degrade&quot; Iraqi air defences in the same way as the air attacks that began the 1991 Gulf War. These &quot;spikes of activity&quot; were, in the words of then British Defence Secretary, Geoff Hoon, designed to &#x27;put pressure on the Iraqi regime&#x27; or, as &quot;The Times&quot; reported, to &quot;provoke Saddam Hussein into giving the allies an excuse for war&quot;. In this respect, as provocations designed to start a war, leaked British Foreign Office legal advice concluded that such attacks were illegal under international law.

Another attempt at provoking the war was mentioned in a leaked memo from a meeting between George W. Bush and Tony Blair on 31 January 2003 at which Bush allegedly told Blair that &quot;The US was thinking of flying U2 reconnaissance aircraft with fighter cover over Iraq, painted in UN colours. If Saddam fired on them, he would be in breach.&quot; On 17 March 2003, U.S. President George W. Bush gave Saddam Hussein 48 hours to leave the country, along with his sons Uday and Qusay, or face war.

==Invasion==

===Preceding special forces mission in al-Qa&#x27;im===
On the night of 17 March 2003, the majority of B and D squadron British 22nd SAS Regiment, designated as Task Force 14, crossed the border from Jordan to conduct a ground assault on a suspected chemical munitions site at a water-treatment plant in the city of al-Qa&#x27;im. It had been reported that the site might have been a SCUD missile launch site or a depot; an SAS officer was quoted by author Mark Nicol as saying &quot;it was a location where missiles had been fired at Israel in the past, and a site of strategic importance for WMD material.&quot; The 60 members of D squadron, along with their &#x27;Pinkie&#x27; Desert Patrol Vehicles (the last time the vehicles were used before their retirement), were flown into Iraq in 6 MH-47Ds in 3 waves. Following their insertion, D squadron established a patrol laager at a remote location outside al-Qa&#x27;im and awaited the arrival of B squadron, who had driven overland from Jordan. Their approach to the plant was compromised, and a firefight developed which ended in one &#x27;pinkie&#x27; having to be abandoned and destroyed. Repeated attempts to assault the plant were halted, leading the SAS to call in an air strike which silenced the opposition.

===Opening salvo: the Dora Farms strike===
In the early morning of 19 March 2003, U.S. forces abandoned the plan for initial, non-nuclear decapitation strikes against 55 top Iraqi officials, in light of reports that Saddam Hussein was visiting his sons, Uday and Qusay, at Dora Farms, within the al-Dora farming community on the outskirts of Baghdad. At approximately 04:42 Baghdad time, two F-117 Nighthawk stealth fighters from the 8th Expeditionary Fighter Squadron dropped four enhanced, satellite-guided 2,000-pound GBU-27 &#x27;Bunker Busters&#x27; on the compound. Complementing the aerial bombardment were nearly 40 Tomahawk cruise missiles fired from several ships, including the , credited with the first to strike, s and , as well as two submarines in the Red Sea and Persian Gulf.

One bomb missed the compound entirely and the other three missed their target, landing on the other side of the wall of the palace compound. Saddam Hussein was not present, nor were any members of the Iraqi leadership. The attack killed one civilian and injured fourteen others, including four men, nine women and one child. Later sources indicated that Saddam Hussein had not visited the farm since 1995, while others claimed that Saddam &quot;had&quot; been at the compound that morning, but had left before the strike, which Bush had ordered delayed until the 48-hour deadline had expired.

===Opening attack===
On 19 March 2003 at 21:00, the first strike of the operation was carried out by members of the 160th SOAR: a flight of MH-60L DAPs (Direct Action Penetrators) and four &#x27;Black Swarm&#x27; flights – each consisting of a pair of AH-6M Little Birds and a FLIR equipped MH-6M to identify targets for the AH-6s (each Black swarm flight was assigned a pair of A-10As) engaged Iraqi visual observation posts along the southern and western borders of Iraq. Within seven hours, more than 70 sites were destroyed, effectively depriving the Iraqi military of any early warning of the coming invasion. As the sites were eliminated, the first heliborne SOF teams launched from H-5 air base in Jordan, including vehicle-mounted patrols from the British and Australian components transported by the MH-47Ds of the 160th SOAR. Ground elements of Task Force Dagger, Task Force 20, Task Force 14, and Task Force 64 breached the sand berms along the Iraqi border with Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait in the early morning hours and drove into Iraq. Unofficially, the British, Australians, and Task Force 20 had been in Iraq weeks prior.

On 20 March 2003 at approximately 02:30 UTC, at 05:34 local time, explosions were heard in Baghdad. Special operations commandos from the CIA&#x27;s Special Activities Division from the Northern Iraq Liaison Element infiltrated throughout Iraq and called in the early air strikes. At 03:16 UTC, or 10:16 pm EST, George W. Bush announced that he had ordered an attack against &quot;selected targets of military importance&quot; in Iraq. When this word was given, the troops on standby crossed the border into Iraq.

Before the invasion, many observers had expected a longer campaign of aerial bombing before any ground action, taking as examples the 1991 Persian Gulf War or the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan. In practice, U.S. plans envisioned simultaneous air and ground assaults to incapacitate the Iraqi forces quickly which resulted in the shock and awe military campaign attempting to bypass Iraqi military units and cities in most cases. The assumption was that superior mobility and coordination of coalition forces would allow them to attack the heart of the Iraqi command structure and destroy it in a short time, and that this would minimize civilian deaths and damage to infrastructure. It was expected that the elimination of the leadership would lead to the collapse of the Iraqi Forces and the government, and that much of the population would support the invaders once the government had been weakened. Occupation of cities and attacks on peripheral military units were viewed as undesirable distractions.

Following Turkey&#x27;s decision to deny any official use of its territory, the coalition was forced to modify the planned simultaneous attack from north and south. Special Operations forces from the CIA and U.S. Army managed to build and lead the Kurdish Peshmerga into an effective force and assault for the North. The primary bases for the invasion were in Kuwait and other Persian Gulf states. One result of this was that one of the divisions intended for the invasion was forced to relocate and was unable to take part in the invasion until well into the war. Many observers felt that the coalition devoted sufficient numbers of troops to the invasion, but too many were withdrawn after it ended, and that the failure to occupy cities put them at a major disadvantage in achieving security and order throughout the country when local support failed to meet expectations.

The United States launched its invasion of Iraq as an effective operational continuation of the First Gulf War. Their main objectives were to destroy the Iraqi army, cripple their ability to fight, and dismantle the Iraqi government. However, the Iraqis immediately adapted and began using unconventional tactics. Already on March 22, just two days into the war, the Americans encountered their first taste of the insurgency tactics that would later define the war. Sgt. 1st Class Anthony Broadhead, a platoon sergeant in the Crazy Horse troop of the 3rd Infantry Division&#x27;s cavalry unit, was in a tank heading towards a bridge in Samawah on the invasion route. He waved at a group of Iraqis, but instead of waving back, they began attacking the American tanks with AK-47 rifles, rocket-propelled grenades, and mortars. Because these types of paramilitary forces were well-armed, but indistinguishable from civilians, they would come to pose a significant challenge for U.S. forces throughout Iraq War.

The invasion itself was swift, leading to the collapse of the Iraqi government and the military of Iraq in about three weeks. The oil infrastructure of Iraq was rapidly seized and secured with limited damage in that time. Securing the oil infrastructure was considered of great importance. In the first Gulf War, while retreating from Kuwait, the Iraqi army had set many oil wells on fire and had dumped oil into the Gulf waters; this was to disguise troop movements and to distract coalition forces. Before the 2003 invasion, Iraqi forces had mined some 400 oil wells around Basra and the Al-Faw peninsula with explosives.
Coalition troops launched an air and amphibious assault on the Al-Faw peninsula during the closing hours of 19 March to secure the oil fields there; the amphibious assault was supported by warships of the Royal Navy, Polish Navy, and Royal Australian Navy.

In the meantime, Royal Air Force Tornados from 9 and 617 Squadrons attacked the radar defence systems protecting Baghdad, but lost a Tornado on 22 March along with the pilot and navigator (Flight Lieutenant Kevin Main and Flight Lieutenant Dave Williams), shot down by an American Patriot missile as they returned to their air base in Kuwait. On 1 April, an F-14 from USS &quot;Kitty Hawk&quot; crashed in southern Iraq reportedly due to engine failure, and a S-3B Viking plunged off the deck of the USS &quot;Constellation&quot; after a malfunction and an AV-8B Harrier jump jet went into the Gulf while it was trying to land on the USS &quot;Nassau&quot;.

The British 3 Commando Brigade, with the United States Navy&#x27;s Special Boat Team 22, Task Unit Two, as well as the United States Marine Corps&#x27; 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit and the Polish Special Forces unit GROM attached, attacked the port of Umm Qasr. There they met with heavy resistance by Iraqi troops. A total of 14 coalition troops and 30–40 Iraqi troops were killed, and 450 Iraqis taken prisoner. The British Army&#x27;s 16 Air Assault Brigade alongside elements of the Royal Air Force Regiment also secured the oil fields in southern Iraq in places like Rumaila while the Polish commandos captured offshore oil platforms near the port, preventing their destruction. Despite the rapid advance of the invasion forces, some 44 oil wells were destroyed and set ablaze by Iraqi explosives or by incidental fire. However, the wells were quickly capped and the fires put out, preventing the ecological damage and loss of oil production capacity that had occurred at the end of the Gulf War.

In keeping with the rapid advance plan, the U.S. 3rd Infantry Division moved westward and then northward through the western desert toward Baghdad, while the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force moved along Highway 1 through the center of the country, and 1 (UK) Armoured Division moved northward through the eastern marshland.

During the first week of the war, Iraqi forces fired a Scud missile at the American Battlefield Update Assessment center in Camp Doha, Kuwait. The missile was intercepted and shot down by a Patriot missile seconds before hitting the complex. Subsequently, two A-10 Warthogs attacked the missile launcher.

====Battle of Nasiriyah====

Initially, the 1st Marine Division (United States) fought through the Rumaila oil fields, and moved north to Nasiriyah—a moderate-sized, Shi&#x27;ite-dominated city with important strategic significance as a major road junction and its proximity to nearby Tallil Airfield. It was also situated near a number of strategically important bridges over the Euphrates River. The city was defended by a mix of regular Iraqi army units, Ba&#x27;ath loyalists, and Fedayeen from both Iraq and abroad. The United States Army 3rd Infantry Division defeated Iraqi forces entrenched in and around the airfield and bypassed the city to the west.

On 23 March, a convoy from the 3rd Infantry Division, including the female American soldiers Jessica Lynch, Shoshana Johnson, and Lori Piestewa, was ambushed after taking a wrong turn into the city. Eleven U.S. soldiers were killed, and seven, including Lynch and Johnson, were captured. Piestewa died of wounds shortly after capture, while the remaining five prisoners of war were later rescued. Piestewa, who was from Tuba City, Arizona, and an enrolled member of the Hopi Tribe, was believed to have been the first Native American woman killed in combat in a foreign war. On the same day, U.S. Marines from the 2nd Marine Division entered Nasiriyah in force, facing heavy resistance as they moved to secure two major bridges in the city. Several marines were killed during a firefight with Fedayeen in the urban fighting. At the Saddam Canal, another 18 marines were killed in heavy fighting with Iraqi soldiers. An Air Force A-10 was involved in a case of friendly fire that resulted in the death of six Marines when it accidentally attacked an American amphibious vehicle. Two other vehicles were destroyed when a barrage of RPG and small arms fire killed most of the Marines inside. A Marine from Marine Air Control Group 28 was killed by enemy fire, and two Marine engineers drowned in the Saddam Canal. The bridges were secured and the Second Marine division set up a perimeter around the city.

On the evening of 24 March, the 2nd Light Armored Reconnaissance Battalion, which was attached to Regimental Combat Team One (RCT-1), pushed through Nasiriyah and established a perimeter north of the city. Iraqi reinforcements from Kut launched several counterattacks. The Marines managed to repel them using indirect fire and close air support. The last Iraqi attack was beaten off at dawn. The battalion estimated that 200–300 Iraqi soldiers were killed, without a single U.S. casualty. Nasiriyah was declared secure, but attacks by Iraqi Fedayeen continued. These attacks were uncoordinated, and resulted in firefights that killed many Fedayeen. Because of Nasiriyah&#x27;s strategic position as a road junction, significant gridlock occurred as U.S. forces moving north converged on the city&#x27;s surrounding highways.

With the Nasiriyah and Tallil Airfields secured, coalition forces gained an important logistical center in southern Iraq and established FOB/EAF Jalibah, some outside Nasiriyah. Additional troops and supplies were soon brought through this forward operating base. The 101st Airborne Division continued its attack north in support of the 3rd Infantry Division.

By 28 March, a severe sandstorm slowed the coalition advance as the 3rd Infantry Division halted its northward drive halfway between Najaf and Karbala. Air operations by helicopters, poised to bring reinforcements from the 101st Airborne, were blocked for three days. There was particularly heavy fighting in and around the bridge near the town of Kufl.

====Battle of Najaf====

Another fierce battle was at Najaf, where U.S. airborne and armored units with British air support fought an intense battle with Iraqi Regulars, Republican Guard units, and paramilitary forces. It started with U.S. AH-64 Apache helicopter gunships setting out on a mission to attack Republican Guard armored units; while flying low the Apaches came under heavy anti-aircraft, small arms, and RPG fire which heavily damaged many helicopters and shot one down, frustrating the attack. They attacked again successfully on 26 March, this time after a pre-mission artillery barrage and with support from F/A-18 Hornet jets, with no gunships lost.

The 1st Brigade Combat Team&#x27;s air defense battery supported by a COLT (combat observation
lasing team) and the Brigade Recon Troop moved in to secure the bridge at Al Kifl late on 24 March 03. When the ADA company was unable to secure the western bank of the bridge the commander called for reinforcements. Col. Grimsley order LTC Marcone Task Force 3-69 Armor to send a quick reaction force to support the ADA company. LTC Marcone sent B 3-7 Infantry to clear and secure the bridge. Bravo Company was made up of two infantry platoons with M2A2 Bradley Fighting Vehicles and one platoon of M1A2 Abrams tanks. Bravo 3-7 Infantry secured the bridge and fought for 36 hours through a sandstorm. During that time the soldiers fought against Iraqi Military and Fedayeen forces. After 36 hours B co 3-7 Infantry was relieved on 26 March. 

The 101st Airborne Division on 29 March, supported by a battalion from the 1st Armored Division, attacked Iraqi forces in the southern part of the city, near the Imam Ali Mosque and captured Najaf&#x27;s airfield. Four Americans were killed by a suicide bomber. On 31 March the 101st made a reconnaissance-in-force into Najaf. On 1 April elements of the 70th Armored Regiment launched a &quot;Thunder Run&quot;, an armored thrust through Najaf&#x27;s city center, and, with air support, defeated the Iraqi forces after several days of heavy fighting. The city was secured by 4 April.

====Battle of Basra====
The Iraqi port city of Umm Qasr was the first British obstacle. A joint Polish-British-American force ran into unexpectedly stiff resistance, and it took several days to clear the Iraqi forces out. Farther north, the British 7 Armoured Brigade (&quot;The Desert Rats&quot;), fought their way into Iraq&#x27;s second-largest city, Basra, on 6 April, coming under constant attack by regulars and Fedayeen, while 3rd Battalion, The Parachute Regiment cleared the &#x27;old quarter&#x27; of the city that was inaccessible to vehicles. Entering Basra was achieved after two weeks of fierce fighting, including a tank battle when the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards destroyed 14 Iraqi tanks on 27 March. A few members of D Squadron, British SAS, were deployed to southern Iraq to support the coalition advance on Basra. The team conducted forward route reconnaissance and infiltrated the city and brought in strikes on the Ba&#x27;athist loyalist leadership.

Elements of 1 (UK) Armoured Division began to advance north towards U.S. positions around Al Amarah on 9 April. Pre-existing electrical and water shortages continued throughout the conflict and looting began as Iraqi forces collapsed. While coalition forces began working with local Iraqi Police to enforce order, a joint team composed of Royal Engineers and the Royal Logistic Corps of the British Army rapidly set up and repaired dockyard facilities to allow humanitarian aid to begin to arrive from ships arriving in the port city of Umm Qasr.

After a rapid initial advance, the first major pause occurred near Karbala. There, U.S. Army elements met resistance from Iraqi troops defending cities and key bridges along the Euphrates River. These forces threatened to interdict supply routes as American forces moved north. Eventually, troops from the 101st Airborne Division of the U.S. Army secured the cities of Najaf and Karbala to prevent any Iraqi counterattacks on the 3rd Infantry Division&#x27;s lines of communication as the division pressed its advance toward Baghdad.

Eleven British soldiers were killed, while 395–515 Iraqi soldiers, irregulars, and Fedayeen were killed.

The efforts of the British Army facilitated the re-establishment of the rail lines from the port to Baghdad.

===Battle of Karbala===
The Karbala Gap was a 20–25-mile wide strip of land with the Euphrates River to the east and Lake Razazah to the west. This strip of land was recognized by Iraqi commanders as a key approach to Baghdad, and was defended by some of the best units of the Iraqi Republican Guard. The Iraqi high command had originally positioned two Republican Guard divisions blocking the Karbala Gap. Here these forces suffered heavy coalition air attacks. However, the coalition had since the beginning of March been conducting a strategic deception operation to convince the Iraqis that the U.S. 4th Infantry Division would be mounting a major assault into northern Iraq from Turkey.

===Special operations===
====Initial infiltration====
B Squadron, Delta Force (known as &quot;Wolverines&quot;), accompanied by several Air Force Special Tactics teams, a Delta intelligence and Target Acquisition, several military working dog teams and two Iraqi-American interpreters, was the first US SOF unit to enter western Iraq, crossing the border from Arar, Saudi Arabia in 15 customized Pinzgauer 6x6 Special Operations Vehicles and several armed Toyota Hilux pick up trucks. As part of Task Force 20, their formal role was to conduct selected high-priority site exploitation on suspected chemical weapon facilities before heading for the Haditha Dam complex. Along the way, Delta supported the seizure of H-3 Air Base and also conducted numerous deception operations to confuse the Iraqis as to the disposition of coalition forces in the west. From the south, a week before the invasion began, two members of Special Boat Team 22&#x27;s Delta Detachment and the Commanding Officer of the 539th Assault Squadron Royal Marine Commandos, were infiltrated into southern Iraq by Kuwait intelligence operatives to gather critical intelligence for the upcoming assault on the port of Um Qasr.

====Operation Row and Falconer====
On 18 March 2003, B and D Squadrons of the British 22nd SAS Regiment had now infiltrated Iraq in full strength (D Squadron by air and B Squadron by ground) along with 1 Squadron Australian SASR and headed for H-2 and H-3 Air Base. They set up observation posts and called in airstrikes that defeated the Iraqi defenders. The combined British and Australian Squadrons took H-2 virtually unopposed. H-3 was secured on 25 March with the assistance of members of Delta Force and by Green Beret ODAs from Bravo company, 1st Battalion 5th SFG; a company of Rangers and Royal Marines from 45 Commando flew from Jordan to the bases and the base was handed over to them. The SAS teams moved to the next objective – the intersection of the two main highways linking Baghdad with Syria and Jordan, where both squadrons were involved in conducting interdictions of fleeing Iraqi leadership targets heading for Syria.

Previously, 16 (Air) Troop of D squadron conducted mounted reconnaissance of an Iraqi army facility near the Syrian border, followed by a harassing attack on the site, two other troops had conducted mobile ambushes on Iraqi units in the area, although they themselves were being hunted by a large Fedayeen Saddam unit mounted in technicals.

In northern Iraq in early March, a small reconnaissance team from M Squadron of the British Special Boat Service mounted on Honda ATVs inserted into Iraq from Jordan. Its first mission was to conduct reconnaissance of an Iraqi air base at al-Sahara. The team was compromised by an anti-special forces Fedayeen unit and barely escaped thanks to a U.S. F-15E that flew air cover for the team and an RAF Chinook that extracted the team from out under the Fedayeen&#x27;s &quot;noses&quot;. A second larger SBS operation was launched by M Squadron in full strength in a mix of land rovers and ATVs into northern Iraq from H-2 air base, the objective was to locate, make contact and take the surrender of the Iraqi 5th Army Corps somewhere past Tikrit and to survey and mark viable temporary landing zones for follow-on forces. However the Squadron was compromised by a goat herder; the SBS drove for several days while unknown to them anti-special forces Fedayeen units followed them. At an overnight position near Mosul, the Fedayeen ambushed the Squadron with DShK heavy machine guns and RPGs, the SBS returned fire and began taking fire from a T-72, the Squadron scattered and escaped the well-constructed trap. A number of Land Rovers became bogged down in a nearby wadi, so they mined the vehicles and abandoned them – though several did not detonate and were captured and exhibited on Iraqi television. The SBS was now in three distinct groups: one with several operational Land Rovers was being pursued by the Iraqi hunter force, a second mainly equipped with ATVs was hunkered down and trying to arrange extraction, the third with just 2 operators on an ATV raced for the Syrian border. The first group tried to call in coalition strike aircraft but the aircraft could not identify friendly forces because the SBS were not equipped with infra-red strobes – although their vehicles did have Blue Force Tracker units, they eventually made it to an emergency rendezvous point and were extracted by an RAF Chinook. The second group was also extracted by an RAF Chinook and the third group made it to Syria and was held there until their release was negotiated, there were no SBS casualties.

====Operation Viking Hammer====

In the early hours of 21 March 2003, as part of Operation Viking Hammer, 64 Tomahawk cruise missiles struck the Ansar al-Islam camp and the surrounding sites, the terrorist group – numbering around 700 – had inhabited a valley near Halabja Iraqi Kurdistan, along with a small Kurdish splinter faction; they had prepared a number of defensive positions including anti-aircraft machine guns and maintained a facility, that US intelligence suspected, at which chemical and biological agents may have been developed and stored for future terrorist attacks. Viking Hammer was set to begin on 21 March, however, the ground component of the operation was set back several days owing to the issues around infiltrating most of the 3rd Battalion 10th SFG into Iraq. The Islamic Group of Kurdistan surrendered after having suffered 100 men killed in the 21 March strikes.

On 28 March 2003, the ground element of Operation Viking Hammer was finally launched with a six-pronged advance, each prong was composed of several ODAs from 3rd Battalion, 10th SFG and upwards of 1,000 Kurdish Peshmerga fighters. The main advance set off towards Sargat – the location of the suspected chemical and biological weapons site; the force was soon pinned down by DShK heavy machine-gun fire from the surrounding hills. A pair of US Navy F/A-18s responded to an urgent CAS request from the force and dropped two 500lb JDAMs on the Ansar al-Islam machine gun nests and strafed the positions with 20 mm cannon before departing due to being low on fuel. The advance began again only to be halted once more by fire from prepared DShK and PKM machine gun nests, Green Berets from ODA 081 deployed a Mk 19 grenade launcher from the back of a Toyota Tacoma and suppressed the gun positions allowing the Peshmerga to assault and wipe out the terrorists. After capturing the town of Gulp, the force continued onto the village of Sargat; the village was heavily defended by fortified fighting positions mounting DShKs and mortars along with several BM-21 Grad. Unable to call in airstrikes due to the close proximity of the Peshmerga, a Green Beret sergeant used a dismounted M2 HMG to suppress the entrenched terrorists, his actions allowed the Peshmerga to bring forward their own 82 mm Mortars and Grads which forced the Ansar al-Islam fighters to retreat. Task Force Viking advanced to secure the Daramar Gorge – which was surrounded by caves in the rock walls – the Peshmerga were again engaged by small arms fire and RPGs which it and the ODAs returned fire with heavy weapons, however, it became obvious that they could not advance any further without air support. To dislodge the terrorists, the Combat Controllers attached to the ODAs vectored in US Navy F/A-18s which dropped six 500 lb JDAMs that shut down any further resistance. During the night, four AC-130 gunships maintained the pressure on the retreating Ansar al-Islam terrorists as they pulled back toward the Iranian border; the next day, Task Force Viking seized the high ground and pushed down through the valley – surrounding and killing small pockets of remnants from Ansar al-Islam. With their objectives completed, the 3rd Battalion and their Peshmerga returned to the green line to assist the push on Kirkuk and Mosul. A specialist SSE team was brought in to document the find at Sargat, the team recovered traces of several chemicals including Ricin along with stocks of NBC protective suits, atropine injectors and Arabic manuals on chemical weapons and IED construction. Estimates of Ansar al-Islam dead number over 300, many of them foreign fighters, while only 22 Peshmerga fighters were killed.

===Special operations in northern Iraq===

Also in the North, the 10th Special Forces Group (10th SFG) and CIA paramilitary officers from their Special Activities Division had the mission of aiding the Kurdish parties, the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan and the Kurdistan Democratic Party, de facto rulers of Iraqi Kurdistan since 1991, and employing them against the 13 Iraqi Divisions located near Kirkuk and Mosul. Turkey had officially prohibited any coalition troops from using their bases or airspace, so lead elements of the 10th SFG had to make a detour infiltration; their flight was supposed to take four hours but instead took ten. On 22 March 2003, the majority of 2nd and 3rd Battalions 10th SFG, from Task Force Viking flew from their forward staging area in Constanta, Romania to a location near Irbil aboard six MC-130H Combat Talons. Several were engaged by Iraqi air defences on the flight into northern Iraq (one was sufficiently damaged enough that it was forced to make an emergency landing at Incirlik Air Base). The initial lift had deployed 19 Green Beret ODAs and four ODBs into Northern Iraq. Hours after the first of such flights, Turkey did allow the use of its air space and the rest of the 10th SFG infiltrated in. The preliminary mission was to destroy the base of the Kurdish terrorist group Ansar al-Islam, believed to be linked to al-Qaeda. Concurrent and follow-on missions involved attacking and fixing Iraqi forces in the north, thus preventing their deployment to the southern front and the main effort of the invasion. Eventually Task Force Viking would number 51 ODAs and ODBs alongside some 60,000 Kurdish Peshmerga militia of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK).

On 26 March 2003, the 173rd Airborne Brigade augmented the invasion&#x27;s northern front by parachuting into northern Iraq onto Bashur Airfield, controlled at the time by elements of 10th SFG and Kurdish peshmerga. The fall of Kirkuk on 10 April 2003 to the 10th SFG, CIA Paramilitary Teams and Kurdish peshmerga precipitated the 173rd&#x27;s planned assault, preventing the unit&#x27;s involvement in combat against Iraqi forces during the invasion.

Following the Battle of Haditha Dam, Delta Force handed the dam over to the Rangers and headed north to conduct ambushes along the highway above Tikrit, tying up Iraqi forces in the region and attempting to capture fleeing high-value targets trying to escape to Syria.

On 2 April, Delta was engaged by half a dozen armed technicals from the same anti-special forces Fedayeen that had previously fought the SBS. Two Delta operators were wounded (one serious); the squadron requested an urgent aeromedical evacuation and immediate close-air support as a company of truck-borne Iraqi reinforcements arrived. Two MH-60K Blackhawks carrying a para jumper medical team and two MH-60L DAPs of the 160th SOAR responded and engaged the Iraqis, which allowed the Delta operators to move their casualties to an emergency HLZ and they were medevaced to H-1 escorted by a pair of A-10As, however Master Sergeant George Fernandez died. The DAPs stayed on station and continued to engage the Iraqis, destroying a truck carrying a mortar and several infantry squads, while Delta snipers killed Iraqi infantryman firing on the DAPs, another pair of A-10As arrived and dropped airburst 500 lb bombs within 20m of Delta positions and killed a large number of Iraqi infantry gathering in a wadi. The DAPs spotted several Iraqi units and engaged them until they were dangerously low on fuel.

Task Force Viking launched an operation to seize the town of Ain Sifni. The town was strategically important because it straddles the main highway into Mosul. Once the town fell, it would be clear for the coalition to advance on Mosul. ODAs from the 3rd and 10th SFG called in airstrikes on the Iraqi garrisons in and around the town, causing many of the Iraqi conscripts to flee. By 5 April 2003, there appeared to be only two Iraqi platoons left in the town. On 6 April, ODAs 051, 055, and 056 assaulted the town – ODAs 055 and 056 provided fire support along with Peshmerga heavy weapons teams, while ODA 51 made the actual assault on the town. As ODA 51 cautiously advanced on the village, it came under intense fire – the two platoons of Iraqis turned out to be closer to battalion strength and equipped with heavy weapons like 82 mm mortars, anti-aircraft guns, and an artillery piece. After 4 hours of F/A-18 airstrikes and constant heavy weapons fire from ODA 055 and 056, the assault force entered Ain Sifni; soon afterward, Iraqi infantry counterattacked, supported by several mortars, attempting to retake the town, but it was beaten back by ODA 51 and the Kurds.

On 6 April 2003, ODA 391 and ODA 392 from the 3rd SFG and ODA 044 from 10th SFG with about 150 Kurdish fighters were the main force involved in the Battle of Debecka Pass.

On 9 April, nine ODAs from FOB 103 encircled Kirkuk after fierce fighting to capture the ridges overlooking the approaches to the city. The earlier capture of the nearby city of Tuz had largely broken the will of the Iraqi Army and only the Fedayeen remained in Kirkuk. The first ODA units entered the city the next day; a week later the 173rd Airborne took over responsibility for the city. After some minor skirmishes the Fedayeen fled. Staging out of MSS Grizzly, Delta mounted operations to interdict Ba&#x27;ath Party HVTs on Highway 1 (Highway 2 and 4 in western Iraq had been secured by British SAS and Australian SAS teams), on 9 April, the combined team seized an airfield near Tikrit.

The successful occupation of Kirkuk came after approximately two weeks of fighting that included the Battle of the Green Line (the unofficial border of the Kurdish autonomous zone) and the subsequent Battle of Kani Domlan Ridge (the ridgeline running northwest to southeast of Kirkuk), the latter fought exclusively by 3rd Battalion, 10th SFG and Kurdish peshmerga against the Iraqi 1st Corps. The 173rd Brigade would eventually take responsibility for Kirkuk days later, becoming involved in the counterinsurgency fight and remain there until redeploying a year later.

On 11 April an advanced element from FOB 102 numbering no more than 30 Green Berets advanced into Mosul. The advance had followed several days of heavy airstrikes on three Iraqi divisions defending Mosul. On 13 April, 3rd Battalion 3rd SFG and a battalion from the 10th Mountain Division were ordered to Mosul to relieve the 10th SFG and their Peshmerga allies. Further reinforcing operations in Northern Iraq, the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit (Special Operations Capable), serving as Landing Force Sixth Fleet, deployed in April to Erbil and subsequently Mosul via Marine KC-130 flights. The 26 MEU (SOC) maintained security of the Mosul airfield and surrounding area until relief by the 101st Airborne Division.

====Special operations in southern Iraq====
On 21 March, ODA 554 of Bravo Company, 2nd Battalion 5th SFG crossed the border with the United States Marines to support the seizure of the Rumaylah oil fields which was later secured by UK forces; half the team later drove to the outskirts of Basra and successfully picked up four Iraqi oil industry technicians who had been recruited by the CIA to assist in safeguarding the oil fields from destruction. They later rejoined the other half of the team and fought roving bands of Fedayeen. The ODAs next mission was to work with a CIA-recruited Sheikh and assist British forces in identifying targets around Basra. The ODA soon established an informant network, they eventually assisted the British in rounding up some 170 Fedayeen in the city; they were eventually replaced by members of G Squadron 22nd SAS Regiment.

====Battle of Haditha Dam====
The Battle of Haditha Dam occurred on 24 March 2003, Rangers from 3rd Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment, conducted a combat parachute drop onto H-1 Air Base, securing the site as a staging area for operations in the west. Delta Force recce operators drove through Iraqi lines around the Haditha Dam on customised ATVs, marking targets for coalition airstrikes resulting in the eventual destruction of a large number of Iraqi armoured vehicles and anti aircraft systems. Delta&#x27;s reconnaissance of the dam indicated that a larger force would be needed to seize it, so a request was made and approved for a second Delta squadron from Fort Bragg to be dispatched with a further Ranger battalion, along with M1A1 Abrams tanks from C Company, 2nd Battalion 70th Armor. C-17 flew the company from Tallil to H-1 and then to MSS (Mission Support Site) Grizzly – a desert strip established by Delta Force located between Haditha and Tikrit; C Squadron, Delta Force was flown directly to MSS Grizzly.

On 1 April, C squadron, Delta Force and 3/75th Ranger Regiment conducted a night-time ground assault in their Pinzgauers and GMVs against the Haditha Dam complex. Three platoons of Rangers seized the dams&#x27; administrative buildings with little initial opposition, while a pair of AH-6M Six Guns orbited overhead. After daybreak, a Ranger sniper shot and killed 3 Iraqis carrying RPGs on the western side of the dam and Rangers on the eastern side engaged a truck carrying infantry, which led to an hour-long contract. South of the dam, another Ranger platoon was securing the dam&#x27;s power station and electricity transformer against sabotage, another platoon was occupied establishing blocking positions on the main road into the dam complex. The blocking positions came under the sporadic mortar fire, resulting in the AH-6Ms flying multiple gun runs to silence the mortar positions, another mortar team, firing from a small island was engaged and silenced by a Ranger Javelin team. For five days, Iraqi forces continued to harass the Rangers at the dam, principally with episodic artillery and mortar fire along with several infantry counterattacks against the blocking positions; the HIMARS rocket system saw its first combat deployment at the dam – firing counter-battery missions, 3 Rangers were killed on 3 April by a VBIED at the blocking positions, the car was driven by a pregnant Iraqi woman acting distressed and asking for water. Rangers captured an Iraqi forward observer dressed as a civilian after sinking his kayak with .50cal fire, the observer had maps of the Rangers positions.

====Objective Beaver====
Intelligence indicated that chemical and biological weapons stocks may have been located at a complex known as al Qadisiyah Research Centre along the shore of the al Qadisiyah reservoir among government and residential buildings, on the evening of 26 March, a DEVGRU assault element supported by B Company, 2nd Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment assaulted the complex (codenamed Objective Beaver). While the first of four MH-60Ks inserted the Rangers into their blocking positions, it was engaged by small arms fire from a nearby building, an AH-6M spotted the muzzle flashes and fired a 2.75-inch rocket into the location silencing the small arms fire, the second MH-60K was also struck by small arms fire but its door gunner suppressed it. A-10As engaged nearby electricity transformers successfully blacking out the area, but it resulted in a series of explosions and a resulting fire at the stations that dramatically lit the sky – pinpointing the orbiting helicopters for enemy gunmen. Small arms fire increased as the final two MH-60Ks inserted their blocking teams, one Ranger was wounded, the two pairs of AH-6Ms and MH-60L DAPs supporting the mission continued to suppress targets as the four MH-47Es carrying the DEVGRU main assault force inserted under heavy enemy small arms fire while DEVGRU sniper teams aboard a pair of MH-6Ms engaged numerous gunmen and vehicles, one Nightstalker crew was wounded as the MH-47Es lifted off. The SEALs conducted a hasty SSE while the Ranger blocking positions received and returned fire, the AH-6Ms and the aerial snipers continued to engage enemy gunmen while the DAPs pushed further out to ensure no reinforcements approached – engaging and destroying numerous Fedayeen armed technicals. The SSE took longer than expected owing to the size and maze-like structure of the building, the mission completed after 45 minutes, later tests of the material recovered by DEVGRU showed no evidence of chemical or biological weapons at the Objective Beaver.

====Operations in western Iraq====
Bravo and Charlie companies of 1st Battalion 5th SFG crossed the Kuwait border at H-Hour with ODA 531 using breaching demolition charges to clear a path through the sand berms. Charlie company&#x27;s seven ODAs in 35 vehicles took the southeastern operation box of the western desert heading towards the towns of Nukyab, Habbariya and Mudyasis, ODA&#x27;s 534 and 532 split off to head for the area surrounding Nukyab searching for mobile Scud-B TEL launch sites. ODA 532 also inserted a mobile weather station that provided planners with vital real time weather updates of the battle space. Bravo company set out for the central town of Ar Rutba and H-3 Air Base with six ODAs and a support ODB (Operational Detachment Bravo). ODAs 523 and 524 searched a suspected Scud-B storage facility while ODAs 521 and 525 were tasked with clearing several abandoned airfields, with no sign of Scud launchers, ODA 525 deployed a Special Reconnaissance team to conduct pattern of life surveillance on the town of Ar Rutba. A two-man team called in a pair of nearby F-16C Fighting Falcons to destroy an Iraqi Army radio direction-finding facility they had identified. A second reconnaissance team from ODA 525 deployed to cover the two highways leading to Ar Rutbah, however as the team was compromised by roving Bedouins who informed the Iraqi Army garrison at Ar Rutbah of the teams presence and location, armed Iraqi technicals crewed by the Fedayeen drove out to search for them, so the Green Berets mounted their GMVs, left their hide and found a position to ambush the Fedayeen, under the weight of fire the Fedayeen retreated. ODA 525 attempted to link up with the two-man reconnaissance team and extract it to safety but large numbers of Iraqi vehicles began driving out of the town to them, the ODAs called in immediate air support. While waiting, the reconnaissance team and Target Acquisition Marines fired on the Fedayeen leaders with their suppressed MK12 sniper rifle and contacted ODA 521 (who were clearing suspects east of the town) and they reinforced ODA 525. Within minutes, F-16Cs arrived and engaged the Fedayeen vehicles, another Fedayeen convoy attempted to outflank ODA 525 but ran into the guns of ODA 524, after 4 hours of constant and punishing airstrikes on the encircling Fedayeen, eight GMVs of ODA 521 and 525 managed to extract the exposed reconnaissance team under the cover of a B-1B strategic bomber, the vehicles withdrew to ODB 520s staging area south of Ar Rutbah. Over 100 Fedayeen fighters were killed and four armed technicals were destroyed. To the west ODA 523 reinforced ODA 524, but ran into a pair of armed technicals on the highway, both were destroyed by the GMVs, the Green Berets ceased fire when a civilian station wagon full of Iraqi children drove into the middle of the firefight. ODA 522 also identified two Fedayeen armed technicals proceeding down the highway toward ODA 523, they set an ambush for them, destroying the vehicles and killing 15 Fedayeen.

The strategic intent of the US Army Special Forces ODAs had been to shut down the main supply routes and deny access around Ar Rutbah and the strategically important H-3 air base, which was defended by a battalion of Iraqi troops and significant numbers of mobile and static anti aircraft guns. On 24 March 2003, the surrounding ODAs supported by Task Force 7 (British Special Air Service) and Task Force 64 (Australian Special Air Service Regiment) called in constant 24 hours of precision airstrikes on H-3 using SOFLAM target designators, the aerial bombardment forced the Iraqi military vehicles to leave the base and headed towards Baghdad. ODA 521 over watching the highway they were travelling on ambushed the convoy destroying a truck mounted ZU-23, the convoy was thrown into disarray, a sandstorm prevented the ODA calling in airstrikes and the convoy scattered into the desert. Bravo company 5th SFG and the coalition SOF secured the airfield, finding a Roland surface-to-air missile system, around 80 assorted anti aircraft cannon guns including ZSU-23-4 Shilka, SA-7 grail handheld SAMs and an enormous amount of ammunition. H-3 was established as an Advanced Operating Base for Bravo company, with supplies delivered by C-130s and MH-47Es; ODA 581 vehicle checkpoint managed to capture the Iraqi general in command of H-3 as he was trying to escape in civilian attire, he was secured and flown by an unmarked CIA SAD Air Branch Little Bird on 28 March for further interrogation. Additionally, ODA 523 discovered what may have been chemical weapons samples in a laboratory on the grounds of H-3.

Bravo company turned its attention to Ar Rutbah, signals intercepts by SOT-A (Support Operations Team – Alpha) and an informer network among the Bedouins as well as inhabitants of the town indicated that around 800 Fedayeen remained in the town; Fedayeen patrols from the town were engaged by surrounding Green Berets and captured. ODAs guided precision airstrikes on Fedayeen anti aircraft guns on the outskirts of the town and on top of the airstrikes, they also struck large groups of Fedayeen militia with Javelin missiles. On 9 April, nine ODAs secured the main roads into the town and commenced a day of near continuous final airstrikes from fix-wing aircraft and Apache helicopters. Civilians from the town approached the Green Berets asking them to stop the bombing, the Green Berets struck a deal with the civilians and they entered the town the next day. A B-52 and 2 F-16Cs flew show of force flights over the town as the Green Berets entered, the Fedayeen blended in with the population. Within days, the Green Berets helped the town to elect a mayor and set up markets, get sixty percent of the electricity grid working and repair water supplies. ODA 521 and 525 continued to operate in the region, stopping several trucks carrying foreign fighters, they disarmed them, took their details and warned them not to come back before sending them to Syria; in late May, the teams were replaced by the 3rd Armoured Cavalry Regiment.

====Other special operations====

The 2nd Battalion of the U.S. 5th Special Forces Group, United States Army Special Forces (Green Berets) conducted reconnaissance in the cities of Basra, Karbala and various other locations.

After Sargat was taken, Bravo Company, 3rd Battalion, 10th SFG and CIA paramilitary officers along with their Kurdish allies pushed south towards Tikrit and the surrounding towns of Northern Iraq. Previously, during the Battle of the Green Line, Bravo Company, 3/10 with their Kurdish allies pushed back, destroyed, or routed the 13th Iraqi Infantry Division. The same company took Tikrit. Iraq was the largest deployment of the U.S. Special Forces since Vietnam.

ODA 563 worked in support of the US Marines around Al Diwaniyah with local Sheikhs and their militias supported by AV-8Bs and F/A-18s; managing to capture the city of Qwam al Hamza. The following day ODA 563, their local Sheikh and his militia and a small Force Recon team captured the bridge leading to Diwaniyah and the militia attacked Iraqi positions over the bridge, forcing the Iraqi army and Fedayeen to flee toward Baghdad while being harassed by Marine Corps aircraft.

====Jessica Lynch rescue====

Private first class Jessica Lynch of the 507th Maintenance Company was seriously injured and captured after her convoy was ambushed by Iraqi forces during the Battle of Nasiriyah. Initial intelligence that led to her rescue was provided by an informant who approached ODA 553 when it was working in Nasiriyah, the intelligence was passed on and Task Force 20 planned a rescue mission. Launching from the recently captured airfield at Tallil, the rescue force consisted of 290 Rangers from 1st and 2nd battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment, around 60 SEALs from DEVGRU along with Pararescue Jumpers and Combat Controllers from the 24th Special Tactics Squadron conventional Marines from Task Force Tarawa then currently fighting through the city and aviators from the Army, Marines and Air Force. The plan called for Task Force Tarawa to conduct a deception mission by seizing the bridges across the Euphrates to draw attention away from the hospital Lynch was held at, an airstrike by US Marine AV-8 Harriers would be conducted against one of the bridges to confuse the opposition further and US Marine AH-1W Cobras were tasked to fly over the area to conceal the sound of incoming SOF helicopters. Air cover as provided by an AC-130 Spectre and a Marine EA-6 Prowler to jam any enemy SAM systems that might be present. With the deception mission underway, the SEAL and select Ranger elements would be inserted by MH-60K Blackhawks and four MH-6 Little Birds, supported by four AH-6 attack helicopters and two MH-60L DAPs, the other Rangers would be flown in by Marine CH-46s and CH-53 transport helicopters to establish a cordon around the hospital grounds. The main assault force of SEALs would arrive by a ground convoy of AGMS Pandur forearmed vehicles and GMV trucks while the hostage rescue element landed directly on the objective in MH-6 Little Birds.

At 0100 on 1 April 2003, TF Tarawa commenced their deception mission, CIA elements cut the city&#x27;s power as the helicopters approached their objective, the AH-6s led the way, behind them the MH-6s dropped off Task Force 20 sniper teams at strategic locations around and on the hospital. The DAPs and the AH-6s covered the MH-60Ks as they dropped off assault teams on the hospital roof and another by the front door, the ground assault convoy arrived and the assaulters raced inside and onto the second floor where Lynch was located. 13 minutes later, a MH-60K touched down near the hospital entrance with a team of PJs and SOAR medics on board and transported Lynch to Tallil where it rendezvoused with a standby medical flight and then onto Kuwait and finally the United States. The hospital was devoid of any Fedayeen, although evidence suggested they were using it as a base; the Ranger blocking teams experienced some sporadic direct fire, the SEALs and the Rangers eventually recovered the remains of eight members of Lynch&#x27;s unit that had been killed or died of their wounds. Task Force 20 carried out one of the first successful U.S. prisoner of war rescue missions since World War II.

===Fall of Baghdad (April 2003)===

Three weeks into the invasion, the Army&#x27;s 3rd Infantry Division, with the 1st Marine Division also present, moved into Baghdad. Units of the Iraqi Special Republican Guard led the defence of the city. The rest of the defenders were a mixture of Republican Guard units, regular army units, Fedayeen Saddam, and non-Iraqi Arab volunteers. Initial plans were for coalition units to surround the city and gradually move in, forcing Iraqi armor and ground units to cluster into a central pocket in the city, and then attack with air and artillery forces.

This plan soon became unnecessary, as an initial engagement of armored units south of the city saw most of the Republican Guard&#x27;s assets destroyed and routes in the southern outskirts of the city occupied. On 5 April, Task Force 1–64 Armor of the U.S. Army&#x27;s 3rd Infantry Division executed a raid, later called the &quot;Thunder Run&quot;, to test remaining Iraqi defenses, with 29 tanks and 14 Bradley armored fighting vehicles advancing to the Baghdad airport. They met significant resistance, but were successful in reaching the airport, and eventually secured it after heavy fighting.

The next day, another brigade of the 3rd Infantry Division attacked downtown Baghdad and occupied one of the palaces of Saddam Hussein in fierce fighting. U.S. Marines also faced heavy shelling from Iraqi artillery as they attempted to cross a river bridge, but the river crossing was successful. The Iraqis managed to inflict some casualties on the U.S. forces near the airport from defensive positions but suffered severe casualties from air bombardment. Within hours of the palace seizure and with television coverage of this spreading through Iraq, U.S. forces ordered Iraqi forces within Baghdad to surrender, or the city would face a full-scale assault. Iraqi government officials had either disappeared or had conceded defeat, and on 9 April 2003, Baghdad was formally occupied by coalition forces. Much of Baghdad remained unsecured however, and fighting continued within the city and its outskirts well into the period of occupation. Saddam had vanished, and his whereabouts were unknown.

On 10 April, a rumor emerged that Saddam Hussein and his top aides were in a mosque complex in the Al Az&#x27;Amiyah District of Baghdad. Three companies of Marines were sent to capture him and came under heavy fire from rocket-propelled grenades, mortars, and assault rifles. One Marine was killed and 20 were wounded, but neither Saddam or any of his top aides were found. U.S. forces supported by mortars, artillery, and aircraft continued to attack Iraqi forces still loyal to Saddam Hussein and non-Iraqi Arab volunteers. U.S. aircraft flying in support were met with Iraqi anti-aircraft fire. On 12 April, by late afternoon, all fighting had ceased. A total of 34 American soldiers and 2,320 Iraqi fighters were killed.

Many Iraqis celebrated the downfall of Saddam by vandalizing the many portraits and statues of him together with other pieces of his cult of personality. One widely publicized event was the dramatic toppling of a large statue of Saddam in Baghdad&#x27;s Firdos Square. This attracted considerable media coverage at the time. As the British &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; reported, 

As Staff Sergeant Brian Plesich reported in &quot;On Point: The United States Army in Operation Iraqi Freedom&quot;,

The fall of Baghdad saw the outbreak of regional, sectarian violence throughout the country, as Iraqi tribes and cities began to fight each other over old grudges. The Iraqi cities of Al-Kut and Nasiriyah launched attacks on each other immediately following the fall of Baghdad to establish dominance in the new country, and the U.S.-led coalition quickly found themselves embroiled in a potential civil war. U.S.-led coalition forces ordered the cities to cease hostilities immediately, explaining that Baghdad would remain the capital of the new Iraqi government. Nasiriyah responded favorably and quickly backed down; however, Al-Kut placed snipers on the main roadways into town, with orders that invading forces were not to enter the city. After several minor skirmishes, the snipers were removed, but tensions and violence between regional, city, tribal, and familial groups continued.

U.S. General Tommy Franks assumed control of Iraq as the supreme commander of the coalition occupation forces. Shortly after the sudden collapse of the defense of Baghdad, rumors were circulating in Iraq and elsewhere that there had been a deal struck (a &quot;safqua&quot;) wherein the U.S.-led coalition had bribed key members of the Iraqi military elite and/or the Ba&#x27;ath party itself to stand down. In May 2003, General Franks retired, and confirmed in an interview with Defense Week that the U.S.-led coalition had paid Iraqi military leaders to defect. The extent of the defections and their effect on the war are unclear.

U.S.-led coalition troops promptly began searching for the key members of Saddam Hussein&#x27;s government. These individuals were identified by a variety of means, most famously through sets of most-wanted Iraqi playing cards. Later during the military occupation period after the invasion, on 22 July 2003 during a raid by the U.S. 101st Airborne Division and men from Task Force 20, Saddam Hussein&#x27;s sons Uday and Qusay, and one of his grandsons were killed in a massive fire-fight. Saddam Hussein himself was captured on 13 December 2003 by the U.S. Army&#x27;s 4th Infantry Division and members of Task Force 121 during Operation Red Dawn.

===Other areas===

U.S. special forces had also been involved in the extreme south of Iraq, attempting to occupy key roads to Syria and air bases. In one case two armored platoons were used to convince Iraqi leadership that an entire armored battalion was entrenched in the west of Iraq.

On 15 April, U.S. forces took control of Tikrit, the last major outpost in central Iraq, with an attack led by the Marines&#x27; Task Force Tripoli. About a week later the Marines were relieved in place by the Army&#x27;s 4th Infantry Division.

Coalition aircraft flew over 41,000 sorties, of which over 9,000 were tanker sorties.

==Aftermath of the invasion==

After the invasion, several factors contributed to the destabilization of Iraq. On 23 May, L. Paul Bremer issued Coalition Provisional Authority Order Number 2, dissolving the Iraqi Army and other entities of the former Ba&#x27;athist state. Ba&#x27;athists were excluded from the newly formed Iraqi government. The first postwar election was won by the United Iraqi Alliance, an electoral coalition composed of mainly Shi’ite groups, which proceeded to ostracize Sunnis. Shia militia groups pushed Sunnis out of several areas, even emptying entire Sunni neighborhoods in Baghdad during the 2007 troop surge. The US military established prison camps where disgruntled Iraqis, former Ba&#x27;athists and Jihadist met. Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, future leader of the Islamic State, joined Al-Qaeda in Iraq while detained at Camp Bucca in 2004. Future leader of al-Nusra Front in Syria, Abu Mohammad al-Julani, who was a member of Al-Qaeda in Iraq, was also held there and released in 2008. All these factors contributed to Iraq&#x27;s 
sectarian violence and the formation and spread of terrorist organizations.

===Bush declares &quot;End of major combat operations&quot; (May 2003)===

On 1 May 2003, Bush landed on the aircraft carrier , in a Lockheed S-3 Viking, where he gave a speech announcing the end of major combat operations in the Iraq war. Bush&#x27;s landing was criticized by opponents as an unnecessarily theatrical and expensive stunt. Clearly visible in the background was a banner stating &quot;Mission Accomplished.&quot; The banner, made by White House staff and supplied by request of the United States Navy, was criticized as premature. The White House subsequently released a statement that the sign and Bush&#x27;s visit referred to the initial invasion of Iraq and disputing the charge of theatrics. The speech itself noted: &quot;We have difficult work to do in Iraq. We are bringing order to parts of that country that remain dangerous.&quot; Post-invasion Iraq was marked by a long and violent conflict between U.S.-led forces and Iraqi insurgents that entailed a very high number of casualties.
==Coalition and Allied contingent involvement==

Members of the coalition included Australia: 2,000 invasion, Poland: 200 invasion—2,500 peak, Spain: 1,300 invasion, United Kingdom: 46,000 invasion, United States: 150,000 to 250,000 invasion. Other members of the coalition were Afghanistan, Albania, Angola, Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Colombia, Costa Rica, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Eritrea, Estonia, Ethiopia, Georgia, Honduras, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Japan, Kuwait, Latvia, Lithuania, Macedonia, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Mongolia, the Netherlands, Nicaragua, Palau, Panama, the Philippines, Portugal, Romania, Rwanda, Singapore, Slovakia, Solomon Islands, South Korea, Tonga, Turkey, Uganda, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan. BBC News said 15 other countries were &quot;providing assistance, such as over-flight rights, but which do not want to declare support.&quot;

=== Australia ===

Australia contributed approximately 2,000 Australian Defence Force personnel, including a special forces task group, three warships and 14 F/A-18 Hornet aircraft. On 16 April 2003, Australian special operations forces captured the undefended Al Asad air base west of Baghdad. The base would later become the second largest coalition facility post-invasion.

=== Poland ===
The Battle of Umm Qasr was the first military confrontation in the Iraq War, with its objective the capture of the port. Polish GROM troops supported the amphibious assault on Umm Qasr with the British 3 Commando Brigade of the Royal Marines, and the US 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit. After the waterway was de-mined by a Detachment from HM-14 and Naval Special Clearance Team ONE of the U.S. Navy and reopened, Umm Qasr played an important role in the shipment of humanitarian supplies to Iraqi civilians.

=== United Kingdom ===
British troops, in what was codenamed Operation (or Op) TELIC participated in the 2003 Invasion of Iraq. The 1st Armoured Division was deployed to the Persian Gulf and commanded British forces in the area, securing areas in southern Iraq, including the city of Basra during the invasion. A total of 46,000 troops of all the British services were committed to the operation at its start, including some 5,000 Royal Navy and Royal Fleet Auxiliary sailors and 4,000 Royal Marines, 26,000 British Army soldiers, and 8,100 Royal Air Force airmen. The British special forces deployment was codenamed Operation Row and were known as Task Force 7 under Combined Joint Special Operations Task Force-West (Task Force Dagger).

==Summary of the invasion==
The U.S.-led coalition forces toppled the government and captured the key cities of a large nation in only 26 days. The invasion did require a large army build-up like the 1991 Gulf War, but many did not see combat and many were withdrawn after the invasion ended. This proved to be short-sighted, however, due to the requirement for a much larger force to combat the irregular Iraqi forces in the Iraqi insurgency. General Eric Shinseki, U.S. Army Chief of Staff, recommended &quot;several hundred thousand&quot; troops be used to maintain post-war order, but then Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld—and especially his deputy, civilian Paul Wolfowitz—strongly disagreed. General Abizaid later said General Shinseki had been right.

The Iraqi army, armed mainly with older Soviet and Eastern European built equipment, was overall ill-equipped in comparison to the American and British forces. Attacks on U.S. supply routes by Fedayeen militiamen were repulsed. The Iraqis&#x27; artillery proved largely ineffective, and they were unable to mobilize their air force to attempt a defense. The Iraqi T-72 tanks, the most powerful armored vehicles in the Iraqi army, were both outdated and ill-maintained, and when they were mobilized they were rapidly destroyed, thanks in part to the coalition air supremacy. The U.S. Air Force, Marine Corps and Naval Aviation, and British Royal Air Force operated with impunity throughout the country, pinpointing heavily defended resistance targets and destroying them before ground troops arrived. The main battle tanks of the U.S. and UK forces, the U.S. M1 Abrams and British Challenger 2, functioned well in the rapid advance across the country. Despite the many RPG attacks by irregular Iraqi forces, few U.S. and UK tanks were lost, and no tank crew-members were killed by hostile fire, although nearly 40 M1 Abrams were damaged in the attacks. The only tank loss sustained by the British Army was a Challenger 2 of the Queen&#x27;s Royal Lancers that was hit by another Challenger 2, killing two crew members.

The Iraqi army suffered from poor morale, even among the elite Republican Guard. Entire units disbanded into the crowds upon the approach of invading troops, or actually sought out U.S. and UK forces to surrender to. Many Iraqi commanding officers were bribed by the CIA or coerced into surrendering. The leadership of the Iraqi army was incompetent – reports state that Qusay Hussein, charged with the defense of Baghdad, dramatically shifted the positions of the two main divisions protecting Baghdad several times in the days before the arrival of U.S. forces, and as a result the units were confused, and further demoralized when U.S. forces attacked. The invasion force did not see the entire Iraqi military thrown against it; U.S. and UK units had orders to move to and seize objective target points rather than seek to engage Iraqi units. This resulted in most regular Iraqi military units emerging from the war without having been engaged, and fully intact, especially in southern Iraq. It is assumed that most units disintegrated to return to their homes.

According to a declassified Pentagon report, &quot;The largest contributing factor to the complete defeat of Iraq&#x27;s military forces was the continued interference by Saddam.&quot; The report, designed to help U.S. officials understand in hindsight how Saddam and his military commanders prepared for and fought the invasion, paints a picture of an Iraqi government blind to the threat it faced, hampered by Saddam&#x27;s inept military leadership and deceived by its own propaganda and inability to believe an invasion was imminent without further Iraqi provocation. According to the BBC, the report portrays Saddam Hussein as &quot;chronically out of touch with reality – preoccupied with the prevention of domestic unrest and with the threat posed by Iran.&quot;

==Casualties==
===Death toll===
Estimates on the number of casualties during the invasion in Iraq vary widely. Estimates on civilian casualties are more variable than those for military personnel. According to Iraq Body Count, a group that relies on press reports, NGO-based reports and official figures to measure civilian casualties, approximately 7,500 civilians were killed during the invasion phase. The Project on Defense Alternatives study estimated that 3,200–4,300 civilians died during the invasion.

===War crimes and allegations===
Fedayeen Saddam militia, Republican Guard and Iraqi security forces were reported to have executed Iraqi soldiers who tried to surrender on multiple occasions, as well as threatening the families of those who refused to fight. One such incident was directly observed during the Battle of Debecka Pass.

Many incidents of Fedayeen fighters using human shields were reported from various towns in Iraq. Iraqi Republican Guard units were also reported to be using human shields. Some reports indicate that the Fedayeen used ambulances to deliver messages and transport fighters into combat. On 31 March, Fedayeen in a Red Crescent-marked ambulance attacked American soldiers outside Nasiriyah, wounding three. During the Battle of Basra, British forces of the Black Watch (Royal Highland Regiment) reported that on 28 March, Fedayeen forces opened fire on thousands of civilian refugees fleeing the city.

After the ambush of the 507th Maintenance Company during the Battle of Nasiriyah on 23 March, the bodies of several U.S. soldiers who had been killed in the ambush were shown on Iraqi television. Some of these soldiers had visible gunshot wounds to the head, leading to speculation that they had been executed. Except for Sgt. Donald Walters, no evidence has since surfaced to support this scenario and it is generally accepted that the soldiers were killed in action. Five live prisoners of war were also interviewed on the air, a violation of the Third Geneva Convention. Sergeant Walters was initially reported to have been killed in the ambush after killing several Fedayeen before running out of ammunition. However, an eyewitness later reported that he had seen Walters being guarded by several Fedayeen in front of a building. Forensics work later found Walters&#x27; blood in front of the building and blood spatter suggesting he died from two gunshot wounds to the back at close range. This led the Army to conclude that Walters had been executed after being captured, and he was posthumously awarded the Prisoner of War Medal in 2004. It was alleged in the authorized biography of Pfc. Jessica Lynch that she was raped by her captors after her capture, based on medical reports and the pattern of her injuries, though this is not supported by Ms Lynch. Mohammed Odeh al-Rehaief, who later helped American forces rescue Lynch, stated that he saw an Iraqi Colonel slap Lynch while she was in her hospital bed. The staff at the hospital where Lynch was held later denied both stories, saying that Lynch was well cared for. While Lynch suffers from amnesia due to her injuries, Lynch herself has denied any mistreatment while in captivity.

Also on 23 March, a British Army engineering unit made a wrong turn near the town of Az Zubayr, which was still held by Iraqi forces. The unit was ambushed and Sapper Luke Allsopp and Staff Sergeant Simon Cullingworth became separated from the rest. Both were captured and executed by Iraqi irregular forces. In 2006, a video of Allsopp lying on the ground surrounded by Iraqi irregular forces was discovered.

During the Battle of Nasiriyah, Iraqi irregulars feigned surrender to approach an American unit securing a bridge. After getting close to the soldiers, the Iraqis suddenly opened fire, killing 10 soldiers and wounding 40. In response, American forces reinforced security procedures for dealing with prisoners of war.

Marine Sergeant Fernando Padilla-Ramirez was reported missing from his supply unit after an ambush north of Nasiriyah on 28 March. His body was later dragged through the streets of Ash-Shatrah and hung in the town square, and later taken down and buried by sympathetic locals. The corpse was discovered by U.S. forces on 10 April.

On 20 March 2023, on the 20th anniversary of the invasion, Amnesty International released a report calling for accountability and reparations for human rights violations perpetrated by the US-led coalition during the invasion and subsequent occupation between 2003 and 2011. They cited violations of international humanitarian law including secret prisons, torture and other cruel treatment of detainees, indiscriminate attacks that killed and injured civilians, and forced disappearances. The report stated that both President Bush and former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld had publicly confessed to involvement in secret detentions and faced no criminal accountability. The report also noted that despite the conclusions of the International Criminal Court in 2020 that British forces had committed war crimes in Iraq, including deliberate killings, rape and torture, no senior British officials have been held criminally accountable.

==Security, looting and war damage==
Massive looting took place in the days following the 2003 invasion. According to U.S. officials, the &quot;reality of the situation on the ground&quot; was that hospitals, water plants, and ministries with vital intelligence needed security more than other sites. There were only enough U.S. troops on the ground to guard a certain number of the many sites that ideally needed protection, and so, apparently, some &quot;hard choices&quot; were made.

It was reported that The Iraq Museum was among the looted sites. The FBI was soon called into Iraq to track down the stolen items. It was found that the initial allegations of looting of substantial portions of the collection were heavily exaggerated. Initial reports asserted a near-total looting of the museum, estimated at upwards of 170,000 inventory lots, or about 501,000 pieces. The more recent estimate places the number of stolen pieces at around 15,000, and about 10,000 of them probably were taken in an &quot;inside job&quot; before U.S. troops arrived, according to Bogdanos. Over 5,000 looted items have since been recovered. An assertion that U.S. forces did not guard the museum because they were guarding the Ministry of Oil and Ministry of Interior is disputed by investigator Colonel Matthew Bogdanos in his 2005 book &quot;Thieves of Baghdad&quot;. Bogdanos notes that the Ministry of Oil building was bombed, but the museum complex, which took some fire, was not bombed. He also writes that Saddam Hussein&#x27;s troops set up sniper&#x27;s nests inside and on top of the museum, and nevertheless U.S. Marines and soldiers stayed close enough to prevent wholesale looting.

&quot;Two great libraries, with priceless ancient collections&quot;—the Awqaf Library (Library of the Ministry of Religious Endowments) and the National Library of Iraq and National Centre for Archives (the House of Wisdom)—&quot;have been burned,&quot; &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; reported in 2003, adding that the libraries at the University of Mosul and University of Basra had been looted. András Riedlmayer, a specialist in Islamic architecture at Harvard University, said the U.S. State Department had asked him for advice before the invasion, and that &quot;everybody warned them that the greatest danger was not from Tomahawk missiles but from looting.&quot; Noting that Iraq had been unified only in 1922 and that relatively little attention had been paid to this local history, Keith D. Waterpaugh, a specialist in Ottoman history, said, &quot;Imagine if we could not go back and read &quot;The New York Times&quot; from 1922 on. If we are going to help the Iraqi people build a new nation, we don&#x27;t do it by letting their past be destroyed.&quot;

More serious for the post-war state of Iraq was the looting of cached weaponry and ordnance which fueled the subsequent insurgency. As many as 250,000 tons of explosives were unaccounted for by October 2004. Disputes within the US Defense Department led to delays in the post-invasion assessment and protection of Iraqi nuclear facilities. Tuwaitha, the Iraqi site most scrutinized by UN inspectors since 1991, was left unguarded and was looted.

Zainab Bahrani, professor of Ancient Near Eastern Art History and Archaeology at Columbia University, reported that a helicopter landing pad was constructed in the heart of the ancient city of Babylon, and &quot;removed layers of archeological earth from the site. The daily flights of the helicopters rattle the ancient walls and the winds created by their rotors blast sand against the fragile bricks. When my colleague at the site, Maryam Moussa, and I asked military personnel in charge that the helipad be shut down, the response was that it had to remain open for security reasons, for the safety of the troops.&quot; Bahrani also reported that in the summer of 2004, &quot;the wall of the Temple of Nabu and the roof of the Temple of Ninmah, both sixth century BC, collapsed as a result of the movement of helicopters.&quot; Electrical power is scarce in post-war Iraq, Bahrani reported, and some fragile artifacts, including the Ottoman Archive, would not survive the loss of refrigeration.

==Media coverage==
===U.S. media coverage===
The U.S. invasion of Iraq was the most widely and closely reported war in military history. Television network coverage was largely pro-war and viewers were six times more likely to see a pro-war source as one who was anti-war. &quot;The New York Times&quot; ran a number of articles describing Saddam Hussein&#x27;s attempts to build weapons of mass destruction. The 8 September 2002 article titled &quot;U.S. Says Hussein Intensifies Quest for A-Bomb Parts&quot; would be discredited, leading &quot;The New York Times&quot; to issue a public statement admitting it was not as rigorous as it should have been.

At the start of the war in March 2003, as many as 775 reporters and photographers were traveling as embedded journalists. These reporters signed contracts with the military that limited what they were allowed to report on. When asked why the military decided to embed journalists with the troops, Lt. Col. Rick Long of the U.S. Marine Corps replied, &quot;Frankly, our job is to win the war. Part of that is information warfare. So we are going to attempt to dominate the information environment.&quot;

In 2003, a study released by Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting stated the network news disproportionately focused on pro-war sources and left out many anti-war sources. According to the study, 64% of total sources supported the Iraq War while total anti-war sources made up 10% of the media (only 3% of US sources were anti-war). The study looked only at 6 American news networks after 20 March for three weeks. The study stated that &quot;viewers were more than six times as likely to see a pro-war source as one who was anti-war; with U.S. guests alone, the ratio increases to 25 to 1.&quot;

A September 2003 poll revealed that seventy percent of Americans believed Saddam Hussein was involved in the attacks of 9/11. 80% of Fox News viewers were found to hold at least one such belief about the invasion, compared to 23% of PBS viewers. Ted Turner, founder of CNN, charged that Rupert Murdoch was using Fox News to advocate an invasion. Critics have argued that this statistic is indicative of misleading coverage by the U.S. media since viewers in other countries were less likely to have these beliefs. A post-2008 election poll by FactCheck.org found that 48% of Americans believe Saddam played a role in the 9/11 attacks, the group concluded that &quot;voters, once deceived, tend to stay that way despite all evidence.&quot;

===Independent media coverage===
Independent media also played a prominent role in covering the invasion. The Indymedia network, among many other independent networks including many journalists from the invading countries, provided reports on the Iraq war. In the United States Democracy Now, hosted by Amy Goodman has been critical of the reasons for the 2003 invasion and the alleged crimes committed by the U.S. authorities in Iraq.

The Israeli Military Censor have released gag orders to Fresh and Rotter news platforms preventing them releasing any information about events and action related to the invasion.

On the other side, among media not opposing to the invasion, &quot;The Economist&quot; stated in an article on the matter that &quot;the normal diplomatic tools—sanctions, persuasion, pressure, UN resolutions—have all been tried, during 12 deadly but failed years&quot; then giving a mild conditional support to the war stating that &quot;if Mr Hussein refuses to disarm, it would be right to go to war&quot;.

Australian war artist George Gittoes collected independent interviews with soldiers while producing his documentary &quot;Soundtrack To War&quot;. The war in Iraq provided the first time in history that military on the front lines were able to provide direct, uncensored reportage themselves, thanks to blogging software and the reach of the internet. Dozens of such reporting sites, known as soldier blogs or milblogs, were started during the war. These blogs were more often than not largely pro-war and stated various reasons why the soldiers and Marines felt they were doing the right thing.

===International media coverage===
International coverage of the war differed from coverage in the U.S. in a number of ways.
The Arab-language news channel Al Jazeera and the German satellite channel Deutsche Welle featured almost twice as much information on the political background of the war. Al Jazeera also showed scenes of civilian casualties rarely seen in the U.S. media.

==Criticism==

Opponents of the military intervention in Iraq have attacked the decision to invade Iraq along a number of lines, including the human cost of war, calling into question the evidence used to justify the war, arguing for continued diplomacy, challenging the war&#x27;s legality, suggesting that the U.S. had other more pressing security priorities, (i.e., Afghanistan and North Korea) and predicting that the war would destabilize the Middle East region. In 2010, an independent commission of inquiry set up by the government of the Netherlands, maintained that UN resolution 1441 &quot;cannot reasonably be interpreted (as the Dutch government did) as authorising individual member states to use military force to compel Iraq to comply with the Security Council&#x27;s resolutions.&quot; Accordingly, the Dutch commission concluded that the invasion violated international law.

===Rationale based on faulty evidence===
The central U.S. justification for launching the war was that Saddam Hussein&#x27;s alleged development of nuclear and biological weapons and purported ties to al-Qaeda made his regime a &quot;grave and growing&quot; threat to the United States and the world community. During the lead-up to the war and the aftermath of the invasion, critics cast doubt on the evidence supporting this rationale. Concerning Iraq&#x27;s weapons programs, prominent critics included Scott Ritter, a former U.N. weapons inspector who argued in 2002 that inspections had eliminated the nuclear and chemical weapons programs, and that evidence of their reconstitution would &quot;have been eminently detectable by intelligence services ...&quot; Although it is popularly believed that Saddam Hussein had forced the IAEA weapons inspectors to leave Iraq, they were withdrawn at the request of the US before Operation Desert Fox, the 1998 American bombing campaign. After the build-up of U.S. troops in neighboring states, Saddam welcomed them back and promised complete cooperation with their demands. Experienced IAEA inspection teams were already back in Iraq and had made some interim reports on its search for various forms of WMD. American diplomat Joseph C. Wilson investigated the contention that Iraq had sought uranium for nuclear weapons in Niger and reported that the contention had no substance.

Similarly, alleged links between Iraq and al-Qaeda were called into question during the lead-up to the war, and were discredited by a 21 October 2004 report from U.S. Senator Carl Levin, which was later corroborated by an April 2006 report from the Defense Department&#x27;s inspector general. These reports further alleged that Bush Administration officials, particularly former undersecretary of defense Douglas J. Feith, manipulated evidence to support links between al-Qaeda and Iraq.

During his 2003–2004 interrogation, Saddam asserted that the majority of Iraq&#x27;s WMD stockpiles had been destroyed in the 1990s by UN inspectors, and the remainder were destroyed unilaterally by Iraq; the illusion of maintaining a WMD program and WMDs was maintained as a deterrent against possible Iranian invasion. An FBI agent who interrogated Saddam during this time also believes that while Iraq may not have possessed WMDs after the 1990s, Saddam likely intended to restart the WMD program if given the opportunity to do so.

===Lack of a U.N. mandate===
One of the main questions in the lead-up to the war was whether the United Nations Security Council would authorize military intervention in Iraq. It became increasingly clear that U.N. authorization would require significant further weapons inspections. Many criticized their effort as unwise, immoral, and illegal. Robin Cook, then the leader of the United Kingdom House of Commons and a former foreign secretary, resigned from Tony Blair&#x27;s cabinet in protest over the UK&#x27;s decision to invade without the authorization of a U.N. resolution. Cook said at the time that: &quot;In principle I believe it is wrong to embark on military action without broad international support. In practice I believe it is against Britain&#x27;s interests to create a precedent for unilateral military action.&quot;
In addition, senior government legal advisor Elizabeth Wilmshurst resigned, stating her legal opinion that an invasion would be illegal.

United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan said in an interview with the BBC in September 2004, &quot;[F]rom our point of view and from the Charter point of view [the war] was illegal.&quot; This drew immediate criticism from the United States and was immediately played down. His annual report to the General Assembly for 2003 included no more than the statement: &quot;Following the end of major hostilities which resulted in the occupation of Iraq...&quot; A similar report from the Security Council was similarly terse in its reference to the event: &quot;Following the cessation of hostilities in Iraq in April 2003 ...&quot; The United Nations Security Council has passed nearly 60 resolutions on Iraq and Kuwait since Iraq&#x27;s invasion of Kuwait in 1990. The most relevant to this issue is Resolution 678, passed on 29 November 1990. It authorizes &quot;member states co-operating with the Government of Kuwait... to use all necessary means&quot; to (1) implement Security Council Resolution 660 and other resolutions calling for the end of Iraq&#x27;s occupation of Kuwait and withdrawal of Iraqi forces from Kuwaiti territory and (2) &quot;restore international peace and security in the area.&quot;

===Military intervention vs diplomatic solution===

Criticisms about the evidence used to justify the war notwithstanding, many opponents of military intervention objected, saying that a diplomatic solution would be preferable, and that war should be reserved as a truly last resort. This position was exemplified by French Foreign Minister Dominique de Villepin, who responded to U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell&#x27;s 5 February 2003 presentation to the U.N Security Council by saying that: &quot;Given the choice between military intervention and an inspections regime that is inadequate because of a failure to cooperate on Iraq&#x27;s part, we must choose the decisive reinforcement of the means of inspections.&quot; In response to Donald Rumsfeld&#x27;s reference to European countries that did not support the invasion of Iraq as &#x27;Old Europe&#x27;, Dominique de Villepin ended his speech with words that would later come to embody the French-German political, economic, and military alliance throughout the beginning of the 21st century: &quot;This message comes to you today from an old country, France, from a continent like mine, Europe, that has known wars, occupation and barbarity. (...) Faithful to its values, it wishes resolutely to act with all the members of the international community. It believes in our ability to build together a better world.&quot; The direct opposition between diplomatic solution and military intervention involving France and the United States which was personified by Chirac versus Bush and later Powell versus de Villepin, became a milestone in the Franco-American relations. Anti-French propaganda exploiting the classic Francophobic clichés immediately ensued in the United States and the United Kingdom. A call for a boycott on French wine was launched in the United States and the &quot;New York Post&quot; covered on the 1944 &quot;Sacrifice&quot; of the GIs that France had forgotten. It was followed a week later, on 20 February, by the British newspaper &quot;The Sun&quot; publishing a special issue entitled &quot;Chirac is a worm&quot; and including &quot;ad hominem&quot; attacks such as &quot;Jacques Chirac has become the shame of Europe&quot;. Actually both newspapers expressed the opinion of their owner, U.S. billionaire Rupert Murdoch, a military intervention supporter and a George W. Bush partisan as argued by Roy Greenslade in &quot;The Guardian&quot; published on 17 February.

===Distraction from the war on terrorism and other priorities===
Both supporters and opponents of the Iraq War widely viewed it within the context of a post–11 September world, where the U.S. has sought to make terrorism the defining international security paradigm. Bush often described the Iraq War as a &quot;central front in the war on terror&quot;. Some critics of the war, particularly within the U.S. military community, argued pointedly against the conflation of Iraq and the war on terror, and criticized Bush for losing focus on the more important objective of fighting al-Qaeda. As Marine Lieutenant General Greg Newbold, the Pentagon&#x27;s former top operations officer, wrote in a 2006 &quot;Time&quot; article, &quot;I now regret that I did not more openly challenge those who were determined to invade a country whose actions were peripheral to the real threat—al-Qaeda.&quot;

Critics within this vein have further argued that containment would have been an effective strategy for the Saddam government, and that the top U.S. priorities in the Middle East should be encouraging a solution to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, working for the moderation of Iran, and solidifying gains made in Afghanistan and Central Asia. In an October 2002 speech, Retired Marine Gen. Anthony Zinni, former head of Central Command for U.S. forces in the Middle East and State Department&#x27;s envoy to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, called Iraq &quot;maybe six or seven,&quot; in terms of U.S. Middle East priorities, adding that &quot;the affordability line may be drawn around five.&quot; However, while commander of CENTCOM, Zinni held a very different opinion concerning the threat posed by Iraq. In testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee in February 2000, Zinni said: &quot;Iraq remains the most significant near-term threat to U.S. interests in the Persian Gulf region. This is primarily due to its large conventional military force, pursuit of WMD, oppressive treatment of Iraqi citizens, refusal to comply with United Nations Security Council Resolutions (UNSCR), persistent threats to enforcement of the No Fly Zones (NFZ), and continued efforts to violate UN Security Council sanctions through oil smuggling.&quot; However, it is important to note that Zinni specifically referred to &quot;the Persian Gulf region&quot; in his Senate testimony, which is a significantly smaller region of the world than the &quot;Middle East&quot;, which he referred to in 2007.

===Potential to destabilize the region===
Besides arguing that Iraq was not the top strategic priority in the war on terrorism or in the Middle East, critics of the war also suggested that it could potentially destabilize the surrounding region. Prominent among such critics was Brent Scowcroft, who served as National Security Advisor to George H. W. Bush. In a 15 August 2002 &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; editorial entitled &quot;Don&#x27;t attack Saddam&quot;, Scowcroft wrote that, &quot;Possibly the most dire consequences would be the effect in the region ... there would be an explosion of outrage against us ... the results could well destabilize Arab regimes&quot;, and, &quot;could even swell the ranks of the terrorists.&quot; In an October 2015 CNN interview with Fareed Zakaria, former British Prime Minister Tony Blair apologized for his &#x27;mistakes&#x27; over Iraq War and admitted there were &#x27;elements of truth&#x27; to the view that the invasion helped promote the rise of ISIS. In the opinion of Hayder al-Khoei, Iraq was already &quot;destined for chaos&quot; before 2003.

==Public opinion==
In a March 2003 Gallup poll, the day after the invasion, 76 percent of Americans supported the military action against Iraq. In a March 2003 YouGov poll, 54 percent of Britons had approved of military action against Iraq.

By July 2007, opposition to the Iraq war had increased to 62 percent among Americans in a USA Today\Gallup poll. On the tenth anniversary of the invasion, in March 2013, a Gallup poll found that 53 percent of Americans surveyed believed the Iraq War was a mistake.

On the 20th anniversary of the invasion, in March 2023, an Axios/Ipsos poll found that 61 percent of Americans surveyed stated that the U.S did not make the right decision by invading Iraq.

==Related phrases==
This campaign featured a variety of new terminology, much of it initially coined by the U.S. government or military. The military official name for the invasion was Operation Iraqi Freedom. Also notable was the usage &quot;death squads&quot; to refer to Fedayeen paramilitary forces. Members of the Saddam Hussein government were called by disparaging nicknames – e.g., &quot;Chemical Ali&quot; (Ali Hassan al-Majid), &quot;Baghdad Bob&quot; or &quot;Comical Ali&quot; (Muhammed Saeed al-Sahaf), and &quot;Mrs. Anthrax&quot; or &quot;Chemical Sally&quot; (Huda Salih Mahdi Ammash).

Terminology introduced or popularized during the war include:
* &quot;Axis of evil&quot;, originally used by Bush in the 2002 State of the Union speech on 29 January 2002 to refer to the countries of Iran, Iraq, and North Korea.
* &quot;Coalition of the willing&quot;, a term that originated in the Clinton era (e.g. an ABC interview with Clinton dated 8 June 1994), and used by the Bush administration for the countries contributing troops in the invasion, of which the U.S. and UK were the primary members.
* &quot;Decapitating the regime&quot;, a euphemism for killing Saddam Hussein.
* &quot;Embedding&quot;, United States practice of assigning civilian journalists to U.S. military units.
* &quot;Freedom fries&quot;, a euphemism for French fries invented to protest the non-participation of France.
* &quot;Mother of all bombs&quot;, a bomb developed and produced to support Operation Iraqi Freedom. Its name echoed Saddam&#x27;s phrase &quot;Mother of all battles&quot; to describe the first Gulf War.
* &quot;Old Europe&quot;, Rumsfeld&#x27;s term for European governments not supporting the war: &quot;You&#x27;re thinking of Europe as Germany and France. I don&#x27;t. I think that&#x27;s old Europe.&quot;
* &quot;Regime change&quot;, a euphemism for overthrowing a government.
* &quot;Shock and awe&quot;, the strategy of reducing an enemy&#x27;s will to fight through displays of overwhelming force.

Many slogans and terms coined came to be used by Bush&#x27;s political opponents, or those opposed to the war. For example, in April 2003 John Kerry, the Democratic candidate in the presidential election, said at a campaign rally: &quot;What we need now is not just a regime change in Saddam Hussein and Iraq, but we need a regime change in the United States.&quot;

George W. Bush&#x27;s press secretary Ari Fleischer talked about &quot;Operation Iraqi liberation&quot; in a 2003 press briefing, and &quot;Operation Iraqi Liberation (OIL)&quot; was also used by David Rovics, a popular folk protest singer.

<text>Bird migration is a seasonal movement of birds between breeding and wintering grounds that occurs twice a year. It is typically from north to south or from south to north. Migration is inherently risky, due to predation and mortality.

The Arctic tern holds the long-distance migration record for birds, travelling between Arctic breeding grounds and the Antarctic each year. Some species of tubenoses, such as albatrosses, circle the Earth, flying over the southern oceans, while others such as Manx shearwaters migrate between their northern breeding grounds and the southern ocean. Shorter migrations are common, while longer ones are not. The shorter migrations include altitudinal migrations on mountains, including the Andes and Himalayas.

The timing of migration seems to be controlled primarily by changes in day length. Migrating birds navigate using celestial cues from the Sun and stars, the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field, and mental maps.

==Historical views==
Writings of ancient Greeks recognized the seasonal comings and goings of birds. Aristotle wrote that birds transmuted into other birds or species like fish and animals, which explained their disappearance and reappearance. Aristotle thought many birds disappeared during cold weather because they were torpid, undetected in unseen environments like tree hollows or burrowing down in mud found at the bottom of ponds, then reemerging months later. Still, Aristotle recorded that cranes traveled from the steppes of Scythia to marshes at the headwaters of the Nile, an observation repeated by Pliny the Elder in his &quot;Historia Naturalis&quot;.

Two books of the Bible may address avian migration. The Book of Job notes migrations with the inquiry: &quot;Is it by your insight that the hawk hovers, spreads its wings southward?&quot; The Book of Jeremiah comments: &quot;Even the stork in the heavens knows its seasons, and the turtle dove, the swift and the crane keep the time of their arrival.&quot;

In the Pacific, traditional land-finding techniques used by Micronesians and Polynesians suggest that bird migration was observed and interpreted for more than 3,000 years. In Samoan tradition, for example, Tagaloa sent his daughter Sina to Earth in the form of a bird, Tuli, to find dry land, the word tuli referring specifically to land-finding waders, often to the Pacific golden plover.

===Swallow migration versus hibernation===
Aristotle, however, suggested that swallows and other birds hibernated. This belief persisted as late as 1878 when Elliott Coues listed the titles of no fewer than 182 papers dealing with the hibernation of swallows. Even the &quot;highly observant&quot; Gilbert White, in his posthumously published 1789 &quot;The Natural History of Selborne&quot;, quoted a man&#x27;s story about swallows being found in a chalk cliff collapse &quot;while he was a schoolboy at Brighthelmstone&quot;, though the man denied being an eyewitness. However, he writes that &quot;as to swallows being found in a torpid state during the winter in the Isle of Wight or any part of this country, I never heard any such account worth attending to&quot;, and that if early swallows &quot;happen to find frost and snow they immediately withdraw for a time—a circumstance this much more in favour of hiding than migration&quot;, since he doubts they would &quot;return for a week or two to warmer latitudes&quot;.

Only at the end of the eighteenth century was migration accepted as an explanation for the winter disappearance of birds from northern climes. Thomas Bewick&#x27;s &quot;A History of British Birds&quot; (Volume 1, 1797) mentions a report from &quot;a very intelligent master of a vessel&quot; who, &quot;between the islands of Menorca and Majorca, saw great numbers of Swallows flying northward&quot;, and states the situation in Britain as follows:

Bewick then describes an experiment that succeeded in keeping swallows alive in Britain for several years, where they remained warm and dry through the winters. He concludes:

===&quot;Pfeilstörche&quot;===
In 1822, a white stork was found in the German state of Mecklenburg with an arrow made from central African hardwood, which provided some of the earliest evidence of long-distance stork migration. This bird was referred to as a &quot;Pfeilstorch&quot;, German for &quot;Arrow stork&quot;. Since then, around 25 &quot;Pfeilstörche&quot; have been documented.

==General patterns==

Migration is the regular seasonal movement, often north and south, undertaken by many species of birds. Migration is marked by its annual seasonality and movement between breeding and non-breeding areas. Nonmigratory bird movements include those made in response to environmental changes including in food availability, habitat, or weather. Sometimes, journeys are not termed &quot;true migration&quot; because they are irregular (nomadism, invasions, irruptions) or in only one direction (dispersal, movement of young away from natal area). Non-migratory birds are said to be resident or sedentary. Approximately 1,800 of the world&#x27;s 10,000 bird species are long-distance migrants.

Many bird populations migrate long distances along a flyway. The most common pattern involves flying north in the spring to breed in the temperate or Arctic summer and returning in the autumn to wintering grounds in warmer regions to the south. In the southern hemisphere, the directions are reversed, but there is less land area in the far south to support long-distance migration.

The primary motivation for migration appears to be food; for example, some hummingbirds choose not to migrate if fed through the winter. In addition, the longer days of the northern summer provide extended time for breeding birds to feed their young. This helps diurnal birds to produce larger clutches than related non-migratory species that remain in the tropics. As the days shorten in autumn, the birds return to warmer regions where the available food supply varies little with the season.

These advantages offset the high stress, physical exertion costs, and other risks of migration. Predation can be heightened during migration: Eleonora&#x27;s falcon &quot;Falco eleonorae&quot;, which breeds on Mediterranean islands, has a very late breeding season, coordinated with the autumn passage of southbound passerine migrants, which it feeds to its young. A similar strategy is adopted by the greater noctule bat, which preys on nocturnal passerine migrants. The higher concentrations of migrating birds at stopover sites make them prone to parasites and pathogens, which require a heightened immune response.

Within a species not all populations may be migratory; this is known as &quot;partial migration&quot;. Partial migration is very common in the southern continents; in Australia, 44% of non-passerine birds and 32% of passerine species are partially migratory. In some species, the population at higher latitudes tends to be migratory and will often winter at lower latitude. The migrating birds bypass the latitudes where other populations may be sedentary, where suitable wintering habitats may already be occupied. This is an example of &quot;leap-frog migration&quot;. Many fully migratory species show leap-frog migration (birds that nest at higher latitudes spend the winter at lower latitudes), and many show the alternative, chain migration, where populations &#x27;slide&#x27; more evenly north and south without reversing the order.

Within a population, it is common for different ages and/or sexes to have different patterns of timing and distance. Female chaffinches &quot;Fringilla coelebs&quot; in Eastern Fennoscandia migrate earlier in the autumn than males do and the European tits of genera &quot;Parus&quot; and &quot;Cyanistes&quot; only migrate in their first year.

Most migrations begin with the birds starting off in a broad front. Often, this front narrows into one or more preferred routes termed flyways. These routes typically follow mountain ranges or coastlines, sometimes rivers, and may take advantage of updrafts and other wind patterns or avoid geographical barriers such as large stretches of open water. The specific routes may be genetically programmed or learned to varying degrees. The routes taken on forward and return migration are often different. A common pattern in North America is clockwise migration, where birds flying North tend to be further West, and flying South tend to shift Eastwards.

Many, if not most, birds migrate in flocks. For larger birds, flying in flocks reduces the energy cost. Geese in a V formation may conserve 12–20% of the energy they would need to fly alone. Red knots &quot;Calidris canutus&quot; and dunlins &quot;Calidris alpina&quot; were found in radar studies to fly faster in flocks than when they were flying alone.
Birds fly at varying altitudes during migration. An expedition to Mt. Everest found skeletons of northern pintail &quot;Anas acuta&quot; and black-tailed godwit &quot;Limosa limosa&quot; at on the Khumbu Glacier. Bar-headed geese &quot;Anser indicus&quot; have been recorded by GPS flying at up to while crossing the Himalayas, at the same time engaging in the highest rates of climb to altitude for any bird. Anecdotal reports of them flying much higher have yet to be corroborated with any direct evidence. Seabirds fly low over water but gain altitude when crossing land, and the reverse pattern is seen in land birds. However most bird migration is in the range of . Bird strike Aviation records from the United States show most collisions occur below and almost none above .

Bird migration is not limited to birds that can fly. Most species of penguin (Spheniscidae) migrate by swimming. These routes can cover over . Dusky grouse &quot;Dendragapus obscurus&quot; perform altitudinal migration mostly by walking. Emus &quot;Dromaius novaehollandiae&quot; in Australia have been observed to undertake long-distance movements on foot during droughts.

==Nocturnal migratory behaviour ==

During nocturnal migration (&quot;nocmig&quot;), many birds give nocturnal flight calls, which are short, contact-type calls. These likely serve to maintain the composition of a migrating flock, and can sometimes encode the sex of a migrating individual, and to avoid collision in the air. Nocturnal migration can be monitored using weather radar data, allowing ornithologists to estimate the number of birds migrating on a given night, and the direction of the migration. Future research includes the automatic detection and identification of nocturnally calling migrant birds.

Nocturnal migrants land in the morning and may feed for a few days before resuming their migration. These birds are referred to as &quot;passage migrants&quot; in the regions where they occur for a short period between the origin and destination.

Nocturnal migrants minimize depredation, avoid overheating and can feed during the day. One cost of nocturnal migration is the loss of sleep. Migrants may be able to alter their quality of sleep to compensate for the loss.

==Long-distance migration==

The typical image of migration is of northern land birds, such as swallows (Hirundinidae) and birds of prey, making long flights to the tropics. However, many Holarctic wildfowl and finch (Fringillidae) species winters in the North Temperate Zone, in regions with milder winters than their summer breeding grounds. For example, the pink-footed goose migrates from Iceland to Britain and neighbouring countries, whilst the dark-eyed junco migrates from subarctic and arctic climates to the contiguous United States and the American goldfinch from taiga to wintering grounds extending from the American South northwestward to Western Oregon. Some ducks, such as the garganey &quot;Anas querquedula&quot;, move completely or partially into the tropics. The European pied flycatcher &quot;Ficedula hypoleuca&quot; follows this migratory trend, breeding in Asia and Europe and wintering in Africa.

Migration routes and wintering grounds are both genetically and traditionally determined depending on the social system of the species. In long-lived, social species such as white storks &quot;(Ciconia ciconia),&quot; flocks are often led by the oldest members and young storks learn the route on their first journey. In short-lived species that migrate alone, such as the Eurasian blackcap &quot;Sylvia atricapilla&quot; or the yellow-billed cuckoo &quot;Coccyzus americanus&quot;, first-year migrants follow a genetically determined route that is alterable with selective breeding.

Many migration routes of long-distance migratory birds are circuitous due to evolutionary history: the breeding range of Northern wheatears &quot;Oenanthe oenanthe&quot; has expanded to cover the entire Northern Hemisphere, but the species still migrates up to 14,500 km to reach ancestral wintering grounds in sub-Saharan Africa rather than establish new wintering grounds closer to breeding areas.

A migration route often does not follow the most direct line between breeding and wintering grounds. Rather, it could follow a hooked or arched line, with detours around geographical barriers or towards suitable stopover habitat. For most land birds, such barriers could consist of large water bodies or high mountain ranges, a lack of stopover or feeding sites, or a lack of thermal columns (important for broad-winged birds). 
Conversely, in water-birds, large areas of land without wetlands offering suitable feeding sites may present a barrier, and detours avoiding such barriers are observed. For example, brent geese &quot;Branta bernicla bernicla&quot; migrating between the Taymyr Peninsula and the Wadden Sea travel via low-lying coastal feeding-areas on the White Sea and the Baltic Sea rather than directly across the Arctic Ocean and the Scandinavian mainland.
Great snipes make non-stop flights of 4,000–7,000 km, lasting 60–90 h, during which they change their average cruising heights from 2,000 m (above sea level) at night to around 4,000 m during daytime.

===In waders===
A similar situation occurs with waders (called &quot;shorebirds&quot; in North America). Many species, such as dunlin &quot;Calidris alpina&quot; and western sandpiper &quot;Calidris mauri&quot;, undertake long movements from their Arctic breeding grounds to warmer locations in the same hemisphere, but others such as semipalmated sandpiper &quot;C. pusilla&quot; travel longer distances to the tropics in the Southern Hemisphere.

For some species of waders, migration success depends on the availability of certain key food resources at stopover points along the migration route. This gives the migrants an opportunity to refuel for the next leg of the voyage. Some examples of important stopover locations are the Bay of Fundy and Delaware Bay.

Some bar-tailed godwits &quot;Limosa lapponica baueri&quot; have the longest known non-stop flight of any migrant, flying 11,000 km from Alaska to their New Zealand non-breeding areas. Prior to migration, 55 percent of their bodyweight is stored as fat to fuel this uninterrupted journey.

===In seabirds===
Seabird migration is similar in pattern to those of the waders and waterfowl. Some, such as the black guillemot &quot;Cepphus grylle&quot; and some gulls, are quite sedentary; others, such as most terns and auks breeding in the temperate northern hemisphere, move varying distances south in the northern winter. The Arctic tern &quot;Sterna paradisaea&quot; has the longest-distance migration of any bird, and sees more daylight than any other, moving from its Arctic breeding grounds to the Antarctic non-breeding areas. One Arctic tern, ringed (banded) as a chick on the Farne Islands in Northumberland off the British east coast, reached Melbourne, Australia in just three months from fledging, a sea journey of over , while another also from the Farne Islands with a light level geolocator tag &#x27;G82&#x27; covered a staggering in just 10 months from the end of one breeding season to the start of the next, travelling not just the length of the Atlantic Ocean and the width of the Indian Ocean, but also half way across the South Pacific to the boundary between the Ross and Amundsen Seas before returning back west along the Antarctic coast and back up the Atlantic. Many tubenosed birds breed in the southern hemisphere and migrate north in the southern winter.

The most pelagic species, mainly in the &#x27;tubenose&#x27; order Procellariiformes, are great wanderers, and the albatrosses of the southern oceans may circle the globe as they ride the &quot;Roaring Forties&quot; outside the breeding season. The tubenoses spread widely over large areas of open ocean, but congregate when food becomes available. Many are among the longest-distance migrants; sooty shearwaters &quot;Puffinus griseus&quot; nesting on the Falkland Islands migrate between the breeding colony and the North Atlantic Ocean off Norway. Some Manx shearwaters &quot;Puffinus puffinus&quot; do this same journey in reverse. As they are long-lived birds, they may cover enormous distances during their lives; one record-breaking Manx shearwater is calculated to have flown during its over-50-year lifespan.

===Diurnal migration in large birds using thermals===
Some large broad-winged birds rely on thermal columns of rising hot air to enable them to soar. These include many birds of prey such as vultures, eagles, and buzzards, but also storks. These birds migrate in the daytime. Migratory species in these groups have great difficulty crossing large bodies of water, since thermals only form over land, and these birds cannot maintain active flight for long distances. Mediterranean and other seas present a major obstacle to soaring birds, which must cross at the narrowest points. Massive numbers of large raptors and storks pass through areas such as the Strait of Messina, Gibraltar, Falsterbo, and the Bosphorus at migration times. More common species, such as the European honey buzzard &quot;Pernis apivorus&quot;, can be counted in hundreds of thousands in autumn. Other barriers, such as mountain ranges, can cause funnelling, particularly of large diurnal migrants, as in the Central American migratory bottleneck. The Batumi bottleneck in the Caucasus is one of the heaviest migratory funnels on earth, created when hundreds of thousands of soaring birds avoid flying over the Black Sea surface and across high mountains. Birds of prey such as honey buzzards which migrate using thermals lose only 10 to 20% of their weight during migration, which may explain why they forage less during migration than do smaller birds of prey with more active flight such as falcons, hawks and harriers.

From observing the migration of eleven soaring bird species over the Strait of Gibraltar, species which did not advance their autumn migration dates were those with declining breeding populations in Europe.

==Short-distance and altitudinal migration==
Many long-distance migrants appear to be genetically programmed to respond to changing day length. Species that move short distances, however, may not need such a timing mechanism, instead moving in response to local weather conditions. Thus mountain and moorland breeders, such as wallcreeper &quot;Tichodroma muraria&quot; and white-throated dipper &quot;Cinclus cinclus&quot;, may move only altitudinally to escape the cold higher ground. Other species such as merlin &quot;Falco columbarius&quot; and Eurasian skylark &quot;Alauda arvensis&quot; move further, to the coast or towards the south. Species like the chaffinch are much less migratory in Britain than those of continental Europe, mostly not moving more than 5 km in their lives.

Short-distance passerine migrants have two evolutionary origins. Those that have long-distance migrants in the same family, such as the common chiffchaff &quot;Phylloscopus collybita&quot;, are species of southern hemisphere origins that have progressively shortened their return migration to stay in the northern hemisphere.

Species that have no long-distance migratory relatives, such as the waxwings &quot;Bombycilla&quot;, are effectively moving in response to winter weather and the loss of their usual winter food, rather than enhanced breeding opportunities.

In the tropics there is little variation in the length of day throughout the year, and it is always warm enough for a food supply, but altitudinal migration occurs in some tropical birds. There is evidence that this enables the migrants to obtain more of their preferred foods such as fruits.

Altitudinal migration is common on mountains worldwide, such as in the Himalayas and the Andes. Dusky grouse in Colorado migrate less than a kilometer away from their summer grounds to winter sites which may be higher or lower by about 400 m in altitude than the summer sites.

Many bird species in arid regions across southern Australia are nomadic; they follow water and food supply around the country in an irregular pattern, unrelated to season but related to rainfall. Several years may pass between visits to an area by a particular species.

==Irruptions and dispersal==
Sometimes circumstances such as a good breeding season followed by a food source failure the following year lead to irruptions in which large numbers of a species move far beyond the normal range. Bohemian waxwings &quot;Bombycilla garrulus&quot; well show this unpredictable variation in annual numbers, with five major arrivals in Britain during the nineteenth century, but 18 between the years 1937 and 2000. Red crossbills &quot;Loxia curvirostra&quot; too are irruptive, with widespread invasions across England noted in 1251, 1593, 1757, and 1791.

Bird migration is primarily, but not entirely, a Northern Hemisphere phenomenon.
This is because continental landmasses of the northern hemisphere are almost entirely temperate and subject to winter food shortages driving bird populations south (including the Southern Hemisphere) to overwinter; In contrast, among (pelagic) seabirds, species of the Southern Hemisphere are more likely to migrate. This is because there is a large area of ocean in the Southern Hemisphere, and more islands suitable for seabirds to nest.

==Physiology and control==
The control of migration, its timing and response are genetically controlled and appear to be a primitive trait that is present even in non-migratory species of birds. The ability to navigate and orient themselves during migration is a much more complex phenomenon that may include both endogenous programs as well as learning.

===Timing===
The primary physiological cue for migration is the changes in the day length. These changes are related to hormonal changes in the birds. In the period before migration, many birds display higher activity or Zugunruhe (), first described by Johann Friedrich Naumann in 1795, as well as physiological changes such as increased fat deposition. The occurrence of Zugunruhe even in cage-raised birds with no environmental cues (e.g. shortening of day and falling temperature) has pointed to the role of circannual endogenous programs in controlling bird migrations. Caged birds display a preferential flight direction that corresponds with the migratory direction they would take in nature, changing their preferential direction at roughly the same time their wild conspecifics change course.

Satellite tracking of 48 individual Asian houbaras (&quot;Chlamydotis macqueenii&quot;) across multiple migrations showed that this species uses the local temperature to time their spring migration departure. Notably, departure responses to temperature varied between individuals but were individually repeatable (when tracked over multiple years). This suggests that individual use of temperature is a cue that allows for population-level adaptation to climate change. In other words, in a warming world, many migratory birds are predicted to depart earlier in the year for their summer or winter destination.

In polygynous species with considerable sexual dimorphism, males tend to return earlier to the breeding sites than their females. This is termed protandry.

===Orientation and navigation===
Navigation is based on a variety of senses. Many birds have been shown to use a sun compass. Using the Sun for direction involves the need for making compensation based on the time. Navigation has been shown to be based on a combination of other abilities including the ability to detect magnetic fields (magnetoreception), use visual landmarks as well as olfactory cues.

Long-distance migrants are believed to disperse as young birds and form attachments to potential breeding sites and to favourite wintering sites. Once the site attachment is made they show high site-fidelity, visiting the same wintering sites year after year.

The ability of birds to navigate during migrations cannot be fully explained by endogenous programming, even with the help of responses to environmental cues. The ability to successfully perform long-distance migrations can probably only be fully explained with an accounting for the cognitive ability of the birds to recognize habitats and form mental maps. Satellite tracking of day migrating raptors such as ospreys and honey buzzards has shown that older individuals are better at making corrections for wind drift. Birds rely for navigation on a combination of innate biological senses and experience, as with the two electromagnetic tools that they use. A young bird on its first migration flies in the correct direction according to the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field, but does not know how far the journey will be. It does this through a radical pair mechanism whereby chemical reactions in special photo pigments sensitive to short wavelengths are affected by the field. Although this only works during daylight hours, it does not use the position of the Sun in any way. With experience, it learns various landmarks and this &quot;mapping&quot; is done by magnetites in the trigeminal system, which tell the bird how strong the field is. Because birds migrate between northern and southern regions, the magnetic field strengths at different latitudes let it interpret the radical pair mechanism more accurately and let it know when it has reached its destination. There is a neural connection between the eye and &quot;Cluster N&quot;, the part of the forebrain that is active during migrational orientation, suggesting that birds may actually be able to &quot;see&quot; the magnetic field of the Earth.

===Vagrancy===
Migrating birds can lose their way and appear outside their normal ranges. This can be due to flying past their destinations as in the &quot;spring overshoot&quot; in which birds returning to their breeding areas overshoot and end up further north than intended. Certain areas, because of their location, have become famous as watchpoints for such birds. Examples are the Point Pelee National Park in Canada, and Spurn in England.

Reverse migration, where the genetic programming of young birds fails to work properly, can lead to rarities turning up as vagrants thousands of kilometres out of range.

Drift migration of birds blown off course by the wind can result in &quot;falls&quot; of large numbers of migrants at coastal sites.

A related phenomenon called &quot;abmigration&quot; involves birds from one region joining similar birds from a different breeding region in the common winter grounds and then migrating back along with the new population. This is especially common in some waterfowl, which shift from one flyway to another.

===Migration conditioning===

It has been possible to teach a migration route to a flock of birds, for example in re-introduction schemes. After a trial with Canada geese &quot;Branta canadensis&quot;, microlight aircraft were used in the US to teach safe migration routes to reintroduced whooping cranes &quot;Grus americana&quot;.

==Adaptations==

Birds need to alter their metabolism to meet the demands of migration. The storage of energy through the accumulation of fat and the control of sleep in nocturnal migrants require special physiological adaptations. In addition, the feathers of a bird suffer from wear-and-tear and must be moulted. The timing of this moult – usually once a year but sometimes twice – varies with some species moulting prior to moving to their winter grounds and others molting prior to returning to their breeding grounds. Apart from physiological adaptations, migration sometimes requires behavioural changes such as flying in flocks to reduce the energy used in migration or the risk of predation.

==Evolutionary and ecological factors==

Migration in birds is highly labile and is believed to have developed independently in many avian lineages. While it is agreed that the behavioural and physiological adaptations necessary for migration are under genetic control, some authors have argued that no genetic change is necessary for migratory behaviour to develop in a sedentary species because the genetic framework for migratory behaviour exists in nearly all avian lineages. This explains the rapid appearance of migratory behaviour after the most recent glacial maximum.

Theoretical analyses show that detours that increase flight distance by up to 20% will often be adaptive on aerodynamic grounds – a bird that loads itself with food to cross a long barrier flies less efficiently. However some species show circuitous migratory routes that reflect historical range expansions and are far from optimal in ecological terms. An example is the migration of continental populations of Swainson&#x27;s thrush &quot;Catharus ustulatus&quot;, which fly far east across North America before turning south via Florida to reach northern South America; this route is believed to be the consequence of a range expansion that occurred about 10,000 years ago. Detours may also be caused by differential wind conditions, predation risk, or other factors.

===Climate change===
Large scale climatic changes are expected to have an effect on the timing of migration. Studies have shown a variety of effects including timing changes in migration, breeding as well as population declines. 

Bird migration is generally synchronised to take advantage of seasonal resources. For example, there is a strong link between seasonal migration and vegetation greenness in North America. Climate-induced shifts in the phenology of seasonal resource availability can cause mismatches between the timing of increased resource availability and important life-history events such as migration and breeding (aka phenological mismatch or phenological asynchrony). These mismatches between the timing of resource availability and when organisms need additional resources may impact species’ fitness, as described by the match-mismatch hypothesis.

In birds, individuals may use local temperature as a cue for migration. Changing temperature patterns due to climate change can result in population-level shifts in migration phenology. Such shifts in the timing of migration of hundreds of species are already detectable at the continental scale. While phenological mismatches appear to be more pronounced in long-distance migrants, certain species traits such as a generalist diet may help some species avoid more severe consequences of mismatches.

==Ecological effects==
The migration of birds also aids the movement of other species, including those of ectoparasites such as ticks and lice, which in turn may carry micro-organisms including those of concern to human health. Due to the global spread of avian influenza, bird migration has been studied as a possible mechanism of disease transmission, but it has been found not to present a special risk; import of pet and domestic birds is a greater threat. Some viruses that are maintained in birds without lethal effects, such as the West Nile virus may however be spread by migrating birds. Birds may also have a role in the dispersal of propagules of plants and plankton.

Some predators take advantage of the concentration of birds during migration. Greater noctule bats feed on nocturnal migrating passerines. Some birds of prey specialize on migrating waders.

==Study techniques==

Early studies on the timing of migration began in 1749 in Finland, with Johannes Leche of Turku collecting the dates of arrivals of spring migrants.

Bird migration routes have been studied by a variety of techniques including the oldest, marking. Swans have been marked with a nick on the beak since about 1560 in England. Scientific ringing was pioneered by Hans Christian Cornelius Mortensen in 1899. Other techniques include radar and satellite tracking. The rate of bird migration over the Alps (up to a height of 150 m) was found to be highly comparable between fixed-beam radar measurements and visual bird counts, highlighting the potential use of this technique as an objective way of quantifying bird migration.

Stable isotopes of hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, nitrogen, and sulphur can establish avian migratory connectivity between wintering sites and breeding grounds. Stable isotopic methods to establish migratory linkage rely on spatial isotopic differences in bird diet that are incorporated into inert tissues like feathers, or into growing tissues such as claws and muscle or blood.

An approach to identify migration intensity makes use of upward pointing microphones to record the nocturnal contact calls of flocks flying overhead. These are then analyzed in a laboratory to measure time, frequency and species.
An older technique developed by George Lowery and others to quantify migration involves observing the face of the full moon with a telescope and counting the silhouettes of flocks of birds as they fly at night.

Orientation behaviour studies have been traditionally carried out using variants of a setup known as the Emlen funnel, which consists of a circular cage with the top covered by glass or wire-screen so that either the sky is visible or the setup is placed in a planetarium or with other controls on environmental cues. The orientation behaviour of the bird inside the cage is studied quantitatively using the distribution of marks that the bird leaves on the walls of the cage. Other approaches used in pigeon homing studies make use of the direction in which the bird vanishes on the horizon.

==Threats and conservation==

Human activities have threatened many migratory bird species. The distances involved in bird migration mean that they often cross political boundaries of countries and conservation measures require international cooperation. Several international treaties have been signed to protect migratory species including the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 of the US. and the African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbird Agreement

The concentration of birds during migration can put species at risk. Some spectacular migrants have already gone extinct; during the passenger pigeon&#x27;s (&quot;Ectopistes migratorius&quot;) migration the enormous flocks were wide, darkening the sky, and long, taking several days to pass.

Hunting along migration routes threatens some bird species. The populations of Siberian cranes (&quot;Leucogeranus leucogeranus&quot;) that wintered in India declined due to hunting along the route, particularly in Afghanistan and Central Asia. Birds were last seen in their favourite wintering grounds in Keoladeo National Park in 2002. Structures such as power lines, wind farms and offshore oil-rigs have also been known to affect migratory birds. Other migration hazards include pollution, storms, wildfires, and habitat destruction along migration routes, denying migrants food at stopover points. For example, in the East Asian–Australasian Flyway, up to 65% of key intertidal habitat at the Yellow Sea migration bottleneck has been destroyed since the 1950s.

Other significant areas include stop-over sites between the wintering and breeding territories. A capture-recapture study of passerine migrants with high fidelity for breeding and wintering sites did not show similar strict association with stop-over sites. Unfortunately, many historic stopover sites have been destroyed or drastically reduced due to human agricultural development, leading to an increased risk of bird extinction, especially in the face of climate change.

Conversely, so-called &quot;ship-assisted migration&quot; may be a modern benefit to migrating birds by giving them a mid-ocean rest stop on ships.

=== Stopover site conservation efforts ===
California&#x27;s Central Valley was once a massive stopover site for birds traveling along the Pacific Flyway, before being converted into agricultural land. 90% of North America&#x27;s shorebirds utilize this migration path and the destruction of rest stops has had detrimental impacts on bird populations, as they cannot get adequate rest and food and can be unable to complete their migration. As a solution, conservationists and farmers in the United States are now working together to help provide stopover habitats for migrating birds. In the winter, when many of these birds are migrating, farmers are now flooding their fields in order to provide temporary wetlands for birds to rest and feed before continuing their journey. Rice is a major crop produced along this flyway, and flooded rice paddies have shown to be important areas for at least 169 different bird species. For example, in California, legislation changes have made it illegal for farmers to burn excess rice straw, so instead they have begun flooding their fields during the winter. Similar practices are now taking place across the nation, with the Mississippi Alluvial Valley being a primary area of interest due to its agricultural use and its importance for migration.

Plant debris provides food sources for the birds while the newly formed wetland serves as a habitat for bird prey species such as insects and other invertebrates. In turn, bird foraging assists in breaking down plant matter. Droppings then help to fertilize the field, helping the farmers and in turn significantly decreasing their need for artificial fertilizers by at least 13 percent. Recent studies have shown that the implementation of these temporary wetlands has had significant positive impacts on bird populations, such as the White-fronted Goose, as well as various species of wading birds. The artificial nature of these temporary wetlands also greatly reduces the threat of predation from other wild animals. This practice requires extremely low investment on behalf of the farmers, and researchers believe that mutually beneficial approaches such as this are key to wildlife conservation moving forward. Economic incentives are key to getting more farmers to participate in this practice. However, issues can arise if bird populations are too high with their large amounts of droppings decreasing water quality and potentially leading to eutrophication. Increasing participation in this practice would allow migratory birds to spread out and rest on a wider variety of locations, decreasing the negative impacts of having too many birds congregated in a small area. Using this practice in areas with close proximity to natural wetlands could also greatly increase their positive impact.

<text>Rhizochromulina is an unusual genus of marine heterokont algae, with one species, Rhizocromulina marina. They are colored amoeboids with a single flagellum, and produce distinctive spindle-shaped zoospores. These have a cell structure typical of the axodines. Before it was studied in detail, &quot;Rhizochromulina&quot; was included among the superficially similar golden algae in the order Chrysamoebales, but these produce zoospores which are similar to flagellate golden algae in form.

<text>Naval warfare is combat in and on the sea, the ocean, or any other battlespace involving a major body of water such as a large lake or wide river.

The armed forces branch designated for naval warfare is a navy. Naval operations can be broadly divided into riverine/littoral applications (brown-water navy), open-ocean applications (blue-water navy), between riverine/littoral and open-ocean applications (green-water navy), although these distinctions are more about strategic scope than tactical or operational division. The strategic offensive purpose of naval warfare is projection of force by water, and its strategic defensive purpose is to challenge the similar projection of force by enemies.

==History==
Mankind has fought battles on the sea for more than 3,000 years. Even in the interior of large landmasses, transportation before the advent of extensive railways was largely dependent upon rivers, lakes, canals, and other navigable waterways.

The latter were crucial in the development of the modern world in the United Kingdom, America, the Low Countries and northern Germany, because they enabled the bulk movement of goods and raw material, which supported the nascent Industrial Revolution. Prior to 1750, materials largely moved by river barge or sea vessels. Thus armies, with their exorbitant needs for food, ammunition and fodder, were tied to the river valleys throughout the ages.

Pre-recorded history (Homeric Legends, e.g. Troy), and classical works such as The &quot;Odyssey&quot; emphasize the sea. The Persian Empire – united and strong – could not prevail against the might of the Athenian fleet combined with that of lesser city states in several attempts to conquer the Greek city states. Phoenicia&#x27;s and Egypt&#x27;s power, Carthage&#x27;s and even Rome&#x27;s largely depended upon control of the seas.

So too did the Venetian Republic dominate Italy&#x27;s city states, thwart the Ottoman Empire, and dominate commerce on the Silk Road and the Mediterranean in general for centuries. For three centuries, Vikings raided and pillaged far into central Russia and Ukraine, and even to distant Constantinople (both via the Black Sea tributaries, Sicily, and through the Strait of Gibraltar).

Gaining control of the sea has largely depended on a fleet&#x27;s ability to wage sea battles. Throughout most of naval history, naval warfare revolved around two overarching concerns, namely boarding and anti-boarding. It was only in the late 16th century, when gunpowder technology had developed to a considerable extent, that the tactical focus at sea shifted to heavy ordnance.

Many sea battles through history also provide a reliable source of shipwrecks for underwater archaeology. A major example is the exploration of the wrecks of various warships in the Pacific Ocean.

=== Mediterranean Sea ===

The first recorded sea battle was the Battle of the Delta, the Ancient Egyptians defeated the Sea Peoples in a sea battle .
As recorded on the temple walls of the mortuary temple of pharaoh Ramesses III at Medinet Habu, this repulsed a major sea invasion near the shores of the eastern Nile Delta using a naval ambush and archers firing from both ships and shore.

Josephus Flavius (Antiquities IX 283–287) reports a naval battle between Tyre and the king of Assyria who was aided by the other cities in Phoenicia. The battle took place off the shores of Tyre. Although the Tyrian fleet was much smaller, the Tyrians defeated their enemies.








=== Europe, Western Asia, and Northern Africa ===
While the barbarian invasions of the 4th century and later mostly occurred by land, some notable examples of naval conflicts are known. In the late 3rd century, in the reign of Emperor Gallienus, a large raiding party composed by Goths, Gepids and Heruli, launched itself in the Black Sea, raiding the coasts of Anatolia and Thrace, and crossing into the Aegean Sea, plundering mainland Greece (including Athens and Sparta) and going as far as Crete and Rhodes. In the twilight of the Roman Empire in the late 4th century, examples include that of Emperor Majorian, who, with the help of Constantinople, mustered a large fleet in a failed effort to expel the Germanic invaders from their recently conquered African territories, and a defeat of an Ostrogothic fleet at Sena Gallica in the Adriatic Sea.

During the Muslim conquests of the 7th century, Muslim fleets first appeared, raiding Sicily in 652 (see History of Islam in southern Italy and Emirate of Sicily), and defeating the Byzantine Navy in 655. Constantinople was saved from a prolonged Arab siege in 678 by the invention of Greek fire, an early form of flamethrower that was devastating to the ships in the besieging fleet. These were the first of many encounters during the Byzantine-Arab Wars.

The Caliphate became the dominant naval power in the Mediterranean Sea from the 7th to 13th centuries, during what is known as the Islamic Golden Age. One of the most significant inventions in medieval naval warfare was the torpedo, invented in Syria by the Arab inventor Hasan al-Rammah in 1275. His torpedo ran on water with a rocket system filled with explosive gunpowder materials and had three firing points. It was an effective weapon against ships.

In the 8th century the Vikings appeared, although their usual style was to appear quickly, plunder, and disappear, preferably attacking undefended locations. The Vikings raided places along the coastline of England and France, with the greatest threats being in England. They would raid monasteries for their wealth and lack of formidable defenders. They also utilized rivers and other auxiliary waterways to work their way inland in the eventual invasion of Britain. They wreaked havoc in Northumbria and Mercia and the rest of Anglia before being halted by Wessex. King Alfred the Great of England was able to stay the Viking invasions with a pivotal victory at the Battle of Edington. Alfred defeated Guthrum, establishing the boundaries of Danelaw in an 884 treaty. The effectiveness of Alfred&#x27;s &#x27;fleet&#x27; has been debated; Kenneth Harl has pointed out that as few as eleven ships were sent to combat the Vikings, only two of which were not beaten back or captured.

The Vikings also fought several sea battles among themselves. This was normally done by binding the ships on each side together, thus essentially fighting a land battle on the sea. However the fact that the losing side could not easily escape meant that battles tended to be hard and bloody. The Battle of Svolder is perhaps the most famous of these battles.

As Muslim power in the Mediterranean began to wane, the Italian trading towns of Genoa, Pisa, and Venice stepped in to seize the opportunity, setting up commercial networks and building navies to protect them. At first the navies fought with the Arabs (off Bari in 1004, at Messina in 1005), but then they found themselves contending with Normans moving into Sicily, and finally with each other. The Genoese and Venetians fought four naval wars, in 1253–1284, 1293–1299,
1350–1355, and 1378–1381. The last ended with a decisive Venetian victory, giving it almost a century to enjoy Mediterranean trade domination before other European countries began expanding into the south and west.

In the north of Europe, the near-continuous conflict between England and France was characterised by raids on coastal towns and ports along the coastlines and the securing of sea lanes to protect troop–carrying transports. The Battle of Dover in 1217, between a French fleet of 80 ships under Eustace the Monk and an English fleet of 40 under Hubert de Burgh, is notable as the first recorded battle using sailing ship tactics. The battle of Arnemuiden (23 September 1338), which resulted in a French victory, marked the opening of the Hundred Years War and was the first battle involving artillery. However the battle of Sluys, fought two years later, saw the destruction of the French fleet in a decisive action which allowed the English effective control of the sea lanes and the strategic initiative for much of the war.

=== Eastern, Southern, and Southeast Asia ===

The Sui (581–618) and Tang (618–907) dynasties of China were involved in several naval affairs over the triple set of polities ruling medieval Korea (Three Kingdoms of Korea), along with engaging naval bombardments on the peninsula from Asuka period Yamato Kingdom (Japan).

The Tang dynasty aided the Korean kingdom of Silla (see also Unified Silla) and expelled the Korean kingdom of Baekje which were supported by Japanese naval forces from the Korean peninsula (see Battle of Baekgang) and helped Silla overcome its rival Korean kingdoms, Baekje and Goguryeo, by 668. In addition, the Tang had maritime trading, tributary, and diplomatic ties as far as modern Sri Lanka, India, Islamic Iran and Arabia, as well as Somalia in East Africa.

From the Axumite Kingdom in modern-day Ethiopia, the Arab traveller Sa&#x27;d ibn Abi-Waqqas sailed from there to Tang China during the reign of Emperor Gaozong. Two decades later, he returned with a copy of the Quran, establishing the first Islamic mosque in China, the Mosque of Remembrance in Guangzhou. A rising rivalry followed between the Arabs and Chinese for control of trade in the Indian Ocean. In his book &quot;Cultural Flow Between China and the Outside World&quot;, Shen Fuwei notes that maritime Chinese merchants in the 9th century were landing regularly at Sufala in East Africa to cut out Arab middle-men traders.

The Chola dynasty of medieval India was a dominant seapower in the Indian Ocean, an avid maritime trader and diplomatic entity with Song China. Rajaraja Chola I (reigned 985 to 1014) and his son Rajendra Chola I (reigned 1014–42), sent a great naval expedition that occupied parts of Myanmar, Malaya, and Sumatra.
In the Nusantara archipelago, large ocean going ships of more than 50 m in length and 5.2–7.8 meters freeboard are already used at least since the 2nd century AD, contacting India to China. Srivijaya empire since the 7th century AD controlled the sea of the western part of the archipelago. The Kedukan Bukit inscription is the oldest record of Indonesian military history, and noted a 7th-century Srivijayan sacred &quot;siddhayatra&quot; journey led by Dapunta Hyang Sri Jayanasa. He was said to have brought 20,000 troops, including 312 people in boats and 1,312 foot soldiers. The 10th century Arab text &quot;Ajayeb al-Hind&quot; (Marvels of India) gives an account of an invasion in Africa by people called Wakwak or Waqwaq, probably the Malay people of Srivijaya or Javanese people of Mataram kingdom, in 945–946 CE. They arrived at the coast of Tanganyika and Mozambique with 1000 boats and attempted to take the citadel of Qanbaloh, though eventually failed. The reason of the attack is because that place had goods suitable for their country and for China, such as ivory, tortoise shells, panther skins, and ambergris, and also because they wanted black slaves from Bantu people (called &quot;Zeng&quot; or &quot;Zenj&quot; by Arabs, &quot;Jenggi&quot; by Javanese) who were strong and make good slaves. Before the 12th century, Srivijaya is primarily land-based polity rather than maritime power, fleets are available but acted as logistical support to facilitate the projection of land power. Later, the naval strategy degenerated to raiding fleet. Their naval strategy was to coerce merchant ships to dock in their ports, which if ignored, they will send ships to destroy the ship and kill the occupants.

In 1293, the Mongol Yuan dynasty launched an invasion to Java. The Yuan sent 500–1000 ships and 20,000–30,000 soldiers, but was ultimately defeated on land by surprise attack, forcing the army to fall back to the beach. In the coastal waters, Javanese junks had already attacked the Mongol ships. After all of the troops had boarded the ships on the coast, the Yuan army battled the Javanese fleet. After repelling it, they sailed back to Quanzhou. Javanese naval commander Aria Adikara intercepted a further Mongol invasion. Although with only scarce information, travellers passing the region, such as Ibn Battuta and Odoric of Pordenone noted that Java had been attacked by the Mongols several times, always ending in failure. After those failed invasions, Majapahit empire quickly grew and became the dominant naval power in the 14–15th century. The usage of cannons in the Mongol invasion of Java, led to deployment of cetbang cannons by Majapahit fleet in 1300s. The main warship of Majapahit navy was the jong. The jongs were large transport ships which could carry 100–2000 tons of cargo and 50–1000 people, 28.99–88.56 meter in length. The exact number of jong fielded by Majapahit is unknown, but the largest number of jong deployed in an expedition is about 400 jongs, when Majapahit attacked Pasai, in 1350. In this era, even to the 17th century, the Nusantaran naval soldiers fought on a platform on their ships called &quot;balai&quot; and performed boarding actions. Scattershots fired from cetbang are used to counter this type of fighting, fired at personnel.

In the 12th century, China&#x27;s first permanent standing navy was established by the Southern Song dynasty, the headquarters of the Admiralty stationed at Dinghai. This came about after the conquest of northern China by the Jurchen people (see Jin dynasty) in 1127, while the Song imperial court fled south from Kaifeng to Hangzhou. Equipped with the magnetic compass and knowledge of Shen Kuo&#x27;s famous treatise (on the concept of true north), the Chinese became proficient experts of navigation in their day. They raised their naval strength from a mere 11 squadrons of 3,000 marines to 20 squadrons of 52,000 marines in a century&#x27;s time.

Employing paddle wheel crafts and trebuchets throwing gunpowder bombs from the decks of their ships, the Southern Song dynasty became a formidable foe to the Jin dynasty during the 12th–13th centuries during the Jin–Song Wars. There were naval engagements at the Battle of Caishi and Battle of Tangdao. With a powerful navy, China dominated maritime trade throughout South East Asia as well. Until 1279, the Song were able to use their naval power to defend against the Jin to the north, until the Mongols finally conquered all of China. After the Song dynasty, the Mongol-led Yuan dynasty of China was a powerful maritime force in the Indian Ocean.

The Yuan emperor Kublai Khan attempted to invade Japan twice with large fleets (of both Mongols and Chinese), in 1274 and again in 1281, both attempts being unsuccessful (see Mongol invasions of Japan). Building upon the technological achievements of the earlier Song dynasty, the Mongols also employed early cannons upon the decks of their ships.

While Song China built its naval strength, the Japanese also had considerable naval prowess. The strength of Japanese naval forces could be seen in the Genpei War, in the large-scale Battle of Dan-no-ura on 25 April 1185. The forces of Minamoto no Yoshitsune were 850 ships strong, while Taira no Munemori had 500 ships.

In the mid-14th century, the rebel leader Zhu Yuanzhang (1328–1398) seized power in the south amongst many other rebel groups. His early success was due to capable officials such as Liu Bowen and Jiao Yu, and their gunpowder weapons (see &quot;Huolongjing&quot;). Yet the decisive battle that cemented his success and his founding of the Ming dynasty (1368–1644) was the Battle of Lake Poyang, considered one of the largest naval battles in history.

In the 15th century, the Chinese admiral Zheng He was assigned to assemble a massive fleet for several diplomatic missions abroad, sailing throughout the waters of the South East Pacific and the Indian Ocean. During his missions, on several occasions Zheng&#x27;s fleet came into conflict with pirates. Zheng&#x27;s fleet also became involved in a conflict in Sri Lanka, where the King of Ceylon traveled back to Ming China afterwards to make a formal apology to the Yongle Emperor.

The Ming imperial navy defeated a Portuguese navy led by Martim Afonso de Sousa in 1522. The Chinese destroyed one vessel by targeting its gunpowder magazine, and captured another Portuguese ship. A Ming army and navy led by Koxinga defeated a western power, the Dutch East India Company, at the Siege of Fort Zeelandia, the first time China had defeated a western power. The Chinese used cannons and ships to bombard the Dutch into surrendering.

In the Sengoku period of Japan, Oda Nobunaga unified the country by military power. However, he was defeated by the Mōri clan&#x27;s navy. Nobunaga invented the Tekkosen (large Atakebune equipped with iron plates) and defeated 600 ships of the Mōri navy with six armored warships (Battle of Kizugawaguchi). The navy of Nobunaga and his successor Toyotomi Hideyoshi employed clever close-range tactics on land with arquebus rifles, but also relied upon close-range firing of muskets in grapple-and-board style naval engagements. When Nobunaga died in the Honnō-ji incident, Hideyoshi succeeded him and completed the unification of the whole country. In 1592, Hideyoshi ordered the &quot;daimyōs&quot; to dispatch troops to Joseon Korea to conquer Ming China. The Japanese army which landed at Pusan on 12 April 1502 occupied Seoul within a month. The Korean king escaped to the northern region of the Korean peninsula and Japan completed occupation of Pyongyang in June. The Korean navy then led by Admiral Yi Sun-sin defeated the Japanese navy in consecutive naval battles, namely Okpo, Sacheon, Tangpo and Tanghangpo. The Battle of Hansando on 14 August 1592 resulted in a decisive victory for Korea over the Japanese navy. In this battle, 47 Japanese warships were sunk and 12 other ships were captured whilst no Korean warship was lost. The defeats in the sea prevented the Japanese navy from providing their army with appropriate supply.

Yi Sun-sin was later replaced with Admiral Won Gyun, whose fleets faced a defeat. The Japanese army, based near Busan, overwhelmed the Korean navy in the Battle of Chilcheollyang on 28 August 1597 and began advancing toward China. This attempt was stopped when the reappointed Admiral Yi, won the battle of Myeongnyang.

The Wanli Emperor of Ming China sent military forces to the Korean peninsula. Yi Sun-sin and Chen Lin continued to successfully engage the Japanese navy with 500 Chinese warships and the strengthened Korean fleet. In 1598, the planned conquest in China was canceled by the death of Toyotomi Hideyoshi, and the Japanese military retreated from the Korean Peninsula. On their way back to Japan, Yi Sun-sin and Chen Lin attacked the Japanese navy at the Battle of Noryang inflicting heavy damages, but the Chinese top official Deng Zilong and the Korean commander Yi Sun-sin were killed in a Japanese army counterattack. The rest of the Japanese army returned to Japan by the end of December. In 1609, the Tokugawa shogunate ordered the abandonment of warships to the feudal lord. The Japanese navy stagnated until the Meiji period.
==== Ancient and Medieval China ====

In ancient China, the first known naval battles took place during the Warring States period (481–221 BC) when vassal lords battled one another. Chinese naval warfare in this period featured grapple-and-hook, as well as ramming tactics with ships called &quot;stomach strikers&quot; and &quot;colliding swoopers&quot;. It was written in the Han dynasty that the people of the Warring States era had employed &quot;chuan ge&quot; ships (dagger-axe ships, or halberd ships), thought to be a simple description of ships manned by marines carrying dagger-axe halberds as personal weapons.

The 3rd-century writer Zhang Yan asserted that the people of the Warring States period named the boats this way because halberd blades were actually fixed and attached to the hull of the ship in order to rip into the hull of another ship while ramming, to stab enemies in the water that had fallen overboard and were swimming, or simply to clear any possible dangerous marine animals in the path of the ship (since the ancient Chinese did believe in sea monsters; see Xu Fu for more info).

Qin Shi Huang, the first emperor of the Qin dynasty (221–207 BC), owed much of his success in unifying southern China to naval power, although an official navy was not yet established (see Medieval Asia section below). The people of the Zhou dynasty were known to use temporary pontoon bridges for general means of transportation, but it was during the Qin and Han dynasties that large permanent pontoon bridges were assembled and used in warfare (first written account of a pontoon bridge in the West being the oversight of the Greek Mandrocles of Samos in aiding a military campaign of Persian emperor Darius I over the Bosporus).

During the Han dynasty (202 BC–220 AD), the Chinese began using the stern-mounted steering rudder, and they also designed a new ship type, the junk. From the late Han dynasty to the Three Kingdoms period (220–280 AD), large naval battles such as the Battle of Red Cliffs marked the advancement of naval warfare in the East. In the latter engagement, the allied forces of Sun Quan and Liu Bei destroyed a large fleet commanded by Cao Cao in a fire-based naval attack.

In terms of seafaring abroad, arguably one of the first Chinese to sail into the Indian Ocean and to reach Sri Lanka and India by sea was the Buddhist monk Faxian in the early 5th century, although diplomatic ties and land trade to Persia and India were established during the earlier Han dynasty. However, Chinese naval maritime influence would penetrate into the Indian Ocean until the medieval period.

=== Early modern ===
The late Middle Ages saw the development of the cogs, caravels and carracks ships capable of surviving the tough conditions of the open ocean, with enough backup systems and crew expertise to make long voyages routine. In addition, they grew from 100 tons to 300 tons displacement, enough to carry cannon as armament and still have space for cargo. One of the largest ships of the time, the Great Harry, displaced over 1,500 tons.

The voyages of discovery were fundamentally commercial rather than military in nature, although the line was sometimes blurry in that a country&#x27;s ruler was not above funding exploration for personal profit, nor was it a problem to use military power to enhance that profit. Later the lines gradually separated, in that the ruler&#x27;s motivation in using the navy was to protect private enterprise so that they could pay more taxes.

Like the Egyptian Shia-Fatimids and Mamluks, the Sunni-Islamic Ottoman Empire centered in modern-day Turkey dominated the eastern Mediterranean Sea. The Ottomans built a powerful navy, rivaling the Italian city-state of Venice during the Ottoman–Venetian War (1499–1503).

Although they were sorely defeated in the Battle of Lepanto (1571) by the Holy League, the Ottomans soon rebuilt their naval strength, and afterwards successfully defended the island of Cyprus so that it would stay in Ottoman hands. However, with the concurrent Age of Discovery, Europe had far surpassed the Ottoman Empire, and successfully bypassed their reliance on land-trade by discovering maritime routes around Africa and towards the Americas.

The first naval action in defense of the new colonies was just ten years after Vasco da Gama&#x27;s epochal landing in India. In March 1508, a combined Gujarati/Egyptian force surprised a Portuguese squadron at Chaul, and only two Portuguese ships escaped. The following February, the Portuguese viceroy destroyed the allied fleet at Diu, confirming Portuguese domination of the Indian Ocean.

In 1582, the Battle of Ponta Delgada in the Azores, in which a Spanish-Portuguese fleet defeated a combined French and Portuguese force, with some English direct support, thus ending the Portuguese succession crisis, was the first battle fought in mid-Atlantic.

In 1588, Spanish King Philip II sent his Armada to subdue the English fleet of Elizabeth, but Admiral Sir Charles Howard defeated the Armada, marking the rise to prominence of the English Royal Navy. However it was unable to follow up with a decisive blow against the Spanish navy, which remained the most important for another half century. After the war&#x27;s end in 1604 the English fleet went through a time of relative neglect and decline.

In the 16th century, the Barbary states of North Africa rose to power, becoming a dominant naval power in the Mediterranean Sea due to the Barbary pirates. The coastal villages and towns of Italy, Spain and Mediterranean islands were frequently attacked, and long stretches of the Italian and Spanish coasts were almost completely abandoned by their inhabitants; after 1600 Barbary pirates occasionally entered the Atlantic and struck as far north as Iceland.

According to Robert Davis as many as 1.25 million Europeans were captured by Barbary pirates and sold as slaves in North Africa and the Ottoman Empire between the 16th and 19th centuries. These slaves were captured mainly from seaside villages in Italy, Spain and Portugal, and from farther places like France, England, the Netherlands, Ireland and even Iceland and North America. The Barbary pirates were also able to successfully defeat and capture many European ships, largely due to advances in sailing technology by the Barbary states. The earliest naval trawler, xebec and windward ships were employed by the Barbary pirates from the 16th century.

From the middle of the 17th century competition between the expanding English and Dutch commercial fleets came to a head in the Anglo-Dutch Wars, the first wars to be conducted entirely at sea. Most memorable of these battles was the raid on the Medway, in which the Dutch admiral Michiel de Ruyter sailed up the river Thames, and destroyed most of the British fleet. This remains the greatest English naval defeat, and established Dutch supremacy at sea for over half a century. Very few ships were sunk in naval combat during the Anglo-Dutch wars, as it was difficult to hit ships below the water level; the water surface deflected cannonballs, and the few holes produced could be patched quickly. Naval cannonades damaged men and sails more than they sunk ships.

=== Late modern ===
==== 18th century ====

The 18th century developed into a period of seemingly continuous international wars, each larger than the last. At sea, the British and French were bitter rivals; the French aided the fledgling United States in the American Revolutionary War, but their strategic purpose was to capture territory in India and the West Indies – which they did not achieve. In the Baltic Sea, the final attempt to revive the Swedish Empire led to Gustav III&#x27;s Russian War, with its grande finale at the Second Battle of Svensksund. The battle, unrivaled in size until the 20th century, was a decisive Swedish tactical victory, but it resulted in little strategical result, due to poor army performance and previous lack of initiative from the Swedes, and the war ended with no territorial changes.

Even the change of government due to the French Revolution seemed to intensify rather than diminish the rivalry, and the Napoleonic Wars included a series of legendary naval battles, culminating in the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805, by which Admiral Horatio Nelson broke the power of the French and Spanish fleets, but lost his own life in so doing.
==== 19th century ====

Trafalgar ushered in the &quot;Pax Britannica&quot; of the 19th century, marked by general peace in the world&#x27;s oceans, under the ensigns of the Royal Navy. But the period was one of intensive experimentation with new technology; steam power for ships appeared in the 1810s, improved metallurgy and machining technique produced larger and deadlier guns, and the development of explosive shells, capable of demolishing a wooden ship at a single blow, in turn required the addition of iron armour.

Although naval power during the Song, Yuan, and Ming dynasties established China as a major world seapower in the East, the Qing dynasty lacked an official standing navy. They were more interested in pouring funds into military ventures closer to home (China proper), such as Mongolia, Tibet, and Central Asia (modern Xinjiang). However, there were some considerable naval conflicts involving the Qing navy before the First Opium War (such as the Battle of Penghu, and the capture of Formosa from Ming loyalists).

The Qing navy proved woefully undermatched during the First and Second Opium Wars, leaving China open to &quot;de facto&quot; foreign domination; portions of the Chinese coastline were placed under Western and Japanese spheres of influence. The Qing government responded to its defeat in the Opium Wars by attempting to modernize the Chinese navy; placing several contracts in European shipyards for modern warships. The result of these developments was the Beiyang Fleet, which was dealt a severe blow by the Imperial Japanese Navy in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895).

The battle between CSS &quot;Virginia&quot; and in the American Civil War was a duel of ironclads that symbolized the changing times. The first fleet action between ironclad ships was fought in 1866 at the Battle of Lissa between the navies of Austria and Italy. Because the decisive moment of the battle occurred when the Austrian flagship successfully sank the Italian flagship &quot;Re d&#x27;Italia&quot; by ramming, in subsequent decade every navy in the world largely focused on ramming as the main tactic. The last known use of ramming in a naval battle was in 1915, when rammed the (surfaced) German submarine, &quot;U-29&quot;. The last surface ship sunk by ramming happened in 1879 when the Peruvian ship &quot;Huáscar&quot; rammed the Chilean ship &quot;Esmeralda&quot;. The last known warship equipped with a ram was launched in 1908, the German light cruiser .

With the advent of the steamship, it became possible to create massive gun platforms and to provide them with heavy armor resulting in the first modern battleships. The Battles of Santiago de Cuba and Tsushima demonstrated the power of these ships.

==== 20th century ====



In the early 20th century, the modern battleship emerged: a steel-armored ship, entirely dependent on steam propulsion, with a main battery of uniform caliber guns mounted in turrets on the main deck. This type was pioneered in 1906 with which mounted a main battery of ten guns instead of the mixed caliber main battery of previous designs. Along with her main battery, &quot;Dreadnought&quot; and her successors retained a secondary battery for use against smaller ships like destroyers and torpedo boats and, later, aircraft.

Dreadnought style battleships dominated fleets in the early 20th century. They would play major parts in both the Russo-Japanese War and World War I. The Russo-Japanese War saw the rise of the Imperial Japanese Navy after their underdog victory against the waning Imperial Russian Navy at the Battle of Tsushima; while WWI pitted the old Royal Navy against the new Kaiserliche Marine of Imperial Germany, culminating in the 1916 Battle of Jutland. The future was heralded when the seaplane carrier and her Short 184 seaplanes joined the battle. In the Black Sea, Russian seaplanes flying from a fleet of converted carriers interdicted Turkish maritime supply routes, Allied air patrols began to counter German U-boat activity in Britain&#x27;s coastal waters, and a British Short 184 carried out the first successful torpedo attack on a ship.

In 1918 the Royal Navy converted an Italian liner to create the first aircraft carrier, , and shortly after the war the first purpose-built carrier, was launched. Many nations agreed to the Washington Naval Treaty and scrapped many of their battleships and cruisers while still in the shipyards, but the growing tensions of the 1930s restarted the building programs, with even larger ships. The s, the largest ever, displaced 72,000 tons and mounted guns.

The victory of the Royal Navy at the Battle of Taranto was a pivotal point as this was the first true demonstration of naval air power. The importance of naval air power was further reinforced by the Attack on Pearl Harbor, which forced the United States to enter World War II. Nevertheless, in both Taranto and Pearl Harbor, the aircraft mainly attacked stationary battleships. The sinking of the British battleships and , which were in full combat manoeuvring at the time of the attack, finally marked the end of the battleship era. Aircraft and their transportation, the aircraft carrier, came to the fore.

During the Pacific War of World War II, battleships and cruisers spent most of their time escorting aircraft carriers and bombarding shore positions, while the carriers and their airplanes were the stars of the Battle of the Coral Sea, Battle of Midway, Battle of the Eastern Solomons, Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands and Battle of the Philippine Sea. The engagements between battleships and cruisers, such as the Battle of Savo Island and the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal, were limited to night-time actions in order to avoid exposure to air attacks. Nevertheless, battleships played the key role again in the Battle of Leyte Gulf, even though it happened after the major carrier battles, mainly because the Japanese carrier fleet was by then essentially depleted. It was the last naval battle between battleships in history. Air power remained key to navies throughout the 20th century, moving to jets launched from ever-larger carriers, and augmented by cruisers armed with guided missiles and cruise missiles.

Roughly parallel to the development of naval aviation was the development of submarines to attack underneath the surface. At first, the ships were capable of only short dives, but they eventually developed the capability to spend weeks or months underwater powered by nuclear reactors. In both world wars, submarines (U-boats in Germany) primarily exerted their power by using torpedoes to sink merchant ships and other warships. In the 1950s, the Cold War inspired the development of ballistic missile submarines, each loaded with dozens of thermonuclear weapon-armed SLBMs and with orders to launch them from sea if the other nation attacked.

Against the backdrop of those developments, World War II had seen the United States become the world&#x27;s dominant sea power. Throughout the rest of the 20th century, the United States Navy maintained a tonnage greater than that of the next 17 largest navies combined.

The aftermath of World War II saw naval gunnery supplanted by ship to ship missiles as the primary weapon of surface combatants. Two major naval battles have taken place since World War II.

The Indo-Pakistani Naval War of 1971 was the first major naval war post World War II. It saw the dispatch of an Indian aircraft carrier group, heavy utilisation of missile boats in naval operations, total naval blockade of Pakistan by the Indian Navy and the annihilation of almost half of Pakistan&#x27;s Navy. By the end of the war, the damage inflicted by the Indian Navy and Air Forces on Pakistan&#x27;s Navy stood at two destroyers, one submarine, one minesweeper, three patrol vessels, seven gunboats, eighteen cargo, supply and communication vessels, as well as large-scale damage inflicted on the naval base and docks located in the major port city of Karachi. Three merchant navy ships, &quot;Anwar Baksh&quot;, &quot;Pasni&quot;, and &quot;Madhumathi&quot;, and ten smaller vessels were captured. Around 1,900 personnel were lost, while 1,413 servicemen (mostly officers) were captured by Indian forces in Dhaka. The Indian Navy lost 18 officers and 194 sailors and a frigate, while another frigate was badly damaged and a Breguet Alizé naval aircraft was shot down by the Pakistan Air Force.

In the 1982 Falklands War between Argentina and the United Kingdom, a Royal Navy task force of approximately 100 ships was dispatched over from the British mainland to the South Atlantic. The British were outnumbered in theatre airpower with only 36 Harriers from their two aircraft carriers and a few helicopters, compared with at least 200 aircraft of the Fuerza Aérea Argentina, although London dispatched Vulcan bombers in a display of long-distance strategic capacity. Most of the land-based aircraft of the Royal Air Force were not available due to the distance from air bases. This reliance on aircraft at sea showed the importance of the aircraft carrier. The Falklands War showed the vulnerability of modern ships to sea-skimming missiles like the Exocet. One hit from an Exocet sank , a modern anti-air warfare destroyer. Over half of Argentine deaths in the war occurred when the nuclear submarine torpedoed and sank the light cruiser with the loss of 323 lives. Important lessons about ship design, damage control and ship construction materials were learnt from the conflict.

====21st century====

At the present time, large naval wars are seldom-seen affairs, since nations with substantial navies rarely fight each other; most wars are civil wars or some form of asymmetrical warfare, fought on land, sometimes with the involvement of military aircraft. The main function of the modern navy is to exploit its control of the seaways to project power ashore. Power projection has been the primary naval feature of most late-century conflicts including the Korean War, Suez Crisis, Vietnam War, Konfrontasi, Gulf War, Kosovo War, the War on Terrorism in Afghanistan, and the Iraq War. A major exception to that trend was the Sri Lankan Civil War, which saw a large number of surface engagements between the belligerents involving fast attack craft and other littoral warfare units.

The lack of large fleet-on-fleet actions does not, however, mean that naval warfare has ceased to feature in modern conflicts. The bombing of the USS &quot;Cole&quot; on October 12, 2000, claimed the lives of seventeen sailors, wounded an additional thirty-seven, and cost the &quot;Cole&quot; fourteen months of repairs. Though the attack did not eliminate the United States&#x27; control of the local seas, in the short-term, it did prompt the US Navy to reduce its visits to far-flung ports, as military planners struggled to ensure their security. This reduced US Naval presence was ultimately reversed in the wake of the September 11 attacks, as part of the Global War on Terrorism.

Even in the absence of major wars, warships from opposing navies clash periodically at sea, sometimes with fatal results. For example, 46 sailors drowned in the 2010 sinking of the ROKS &quot;Cheonan&quot;, which South Korea and the United States blamed on a North Korean torpedo attack. North Korea, in turn, denied all responsibility, accused South Korea of violating North Korean territorial waters, and offered to send its own team of investigators to &quot;examine the evidence.&quot;

During the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the armed forces of both Russia and Ukraine have openly targeted and destroyed each other&#x27;s ships. Though many of these are supporting vessels, such as landing ships, tugs, and patrol boats, several larger warships have also been destroyed. Notably, the Ukrainian Navy scuttled its flagship, the frigate Hetman Sahaidachny, to prevent its capture, while the patrol ship &quot;Sloviansk&quot; was sunken by Russian air attack. The Russian Navy lost the flagship of its Black Sea Fleet, the &quot;Moskva&quot;, in what the Ukrainian Navy has claimed as a successful Neptune anti-ship missile strike. The Russian Navy, while not admitting to the Ukrainian claims of a missile attack, has confirmed the sinking of the Moskva. As of May 2022, the naval war between Russia and Ukraine is ongoing, as the Russian Navy attempts to dominate Black Sea trade routes, and the Ukrainian Military attempts to erode Russian naval control.

<text>Maria de Lourdes Villiers &quot;Mia&quot; Farrow ( ; born February 9, 1945) is an American actress. She first gained notice for her role as Allison MacKenzie in the television soap opera &quot;Peyton Place&quot; and gained further recognition for her subsequent short-lived marriage to Frank Sinatra. An early film role, as Rosemary in Roman Polanski&#x27;s &quot;Rosemary&#x27;s Baby&quot; (1968), saw her nominated for a BAFTA Award and a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress. She went on to appear in several films throughout the 1970s, such as &quot;Follow Me!&quot; (1972), &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; (1974), and &quot;Death on the Nile&quot; (1978). Her younger sister is Prudence Farrow. 

Farrow was in a relationship with actor-director Woody Allen from 1980 to 1992 and appeared in thirteen of his fourteen films over that period, beginning with &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Sex Comedy&quot; (1982). She received numerous critical accolades for her performances in several Allen films, including Golden Globe Award nominations for &quot;Broadway Danny Rose&quot; (1984), &quot;The Purple Rose of Cairo&quot; (1985), and &quot;Alice&quot; (1990). She also acted in &quot;Hannah and Her Sisters&quot; (1986), &quot;Crimes and Misdemeanors&quot; (1989), and &quot;Husbands and Wives&quot; (1992). In 1992, Farrow publicly accused Allen of sexually abusing their adopted daughter, Dylan Farrow. Allen was never charged with a crime and has vigorously denied the allegation. These claims received significant renewed public attention in 2013 after Dylan recounted the alleged assault in an interview that year.

Since the 2000s, Farrow has made occasional appearances on television, including a recurring role on &quot;Third Watch&quot; (2001–2003). She has also had supporting parts in such films as &quot;The Omen&quot; (2006), &quot;Be Kind Rewind&quot; (2008), and &quot;Dark Horse&quot; (2011) as well as the Netflix series &quot;The Watcher&quot; (2022). Farrow is also known for her extensive work as a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador. She is involved in humanitarian activities in Darfur, Chad, and the Central African Republic. In 2008, &quot;Time&quot; magazine named her one of the most influential people in the world.

== Early life and family ==

Maria de Lourdes Villiers Farrow was born February 9, 1945, in Los Angeles, California, the third child and eldest daughter of Australian film director John Farrow and his second wife, the Irish actress Maureen O&#x27;Sullivan. She is one of seven children, with older brothers Michael Damien, Patrick, younger brother John Charles, and younger sisters Prudence, Stephanie, and Tisa. Her godparents were director George Cukor and columnist Louella Parsons.

Farrow was raised in Beverly Hills, California, in a strict Catholic household. She was described by her family as an eccentric and imaginative child, and would occasionally put on performances with &quot;toy daggers and fake blood&quot; for passing celebrity tour buses. Aged two, she made her film debut in a short documentary, &quot;Unusual Occupations: Film Tot Holiday&quot; (1947). Farrow attended Catholic parochial schools in Los Angeles for her primary education. At nine years old, she contracted polio during an outbreak in Los Angeles County reportedly affecting 500 people. She was placed in an isolation ward for three weeks and later said the experience &quot;marked the end of [her] childhood.&quot;

In 1958, the Farrow family temporarily relocated to Spain, where her father was filming &quot;John Paul Jones&quot; (1959). Farrow, then age 13, made a brief uncredited appearance in the film. In September 1958, Farrow and her sister Prudence were sent to attend a convent-operated boarding school in Surrey, England while her father completed post-production on &quot;John Paul Jones&quot; in London.

On October 28, 1958, Farrow&#x27;s eldest brother Michael died in a plane crash near Pacoima, California while a member of the United States Marine Corps Reserve. After his burial, Farrow returned to boarding school in Surrey. Her family temporarily lived in the London Park Lane Hotel before renting a home in Chelsea. Farrow&#x27;s father began drinking heavily, which strained the marriage. In her memoir, Farrow recalls witnessing violent arguments between her parents while visiting their Chelsea residence.

When Farrow was 16, she returned with her family to the United States and continued her education at an all-girls Catholic school in Los Angeles, Marymount High School. (She was among its most famous alumnae.) Farrow subsequently studied at Bard College.

During this time, her parents were struggling financially, and her mother relocated to New York City to act in Broadway productions. Farrow&#x27;s father remained in California, where he died the following year of a heart attack, when she was 17 years old. 

The family was left with little money after her father&#x27;s death, prompting Farrow to begin working to help support herself and her siblings. She initially found work as a fashion model. She began in theatre as a replacement in a New York stage production of &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot;.

==Career==
===1963–1969: Beginnings and breakthrough===

Farrow screen-tested for the role of Liesl von Trapp in &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; (1965), but did not get the part. The footage has been preserved, and appears on the fortieth Anniversary Edition DVD of &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;. She began her acting career in movies by appearing in supporting roles in several 1960s films, making her first credited appearance in &quot;Guns at Batasi&quot; (1964).
The same year, she achieved stardom on the successful primetime soap opera &quot;Peyton Place&quot;, playing naive, waif-like Allison MacKenzie. Farrow left the series in 1966 at the urging of Frank Sinatra, whom she married on July 19, 1966, when she was 21 and he was 50 years old. She subsequently appeared in her first featured role in the British spy film &quot;A Dandy in Aspic&quot; (1968).

Farrow&#x27;s first leading film role was in the psychological horror film &quot;Rosemary&#x27;s Baby&quot; (1968), which was a critical and commercial success. It is highly regarded as a classic of the horror genre, and named the second-best horror film of all time (after Psycho) by &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2010. She won numerous awards, including the Golden Globe Award for New Star of the Year – Actress, and became established as a leading actress. Film critic and author Stephen Farber described her performance as having an &quot;electrifying impact... one of the rare instances of actor and character achieving a miraculous, almost mythical match&quot;. Film critic Roger Ebert called the film &quot;brilliant&quot;, and noted, &quot;A great deal of the credit for this achievement must go to Mia Farrow, as Rosemary.&quot;
Following &quot;Rosemary&#x27;s Baby&quot;, Farrow was to be cast as Mattie in &quot;True Grit&quot; and was keen on the role. But, prior to filming she made &quot;Secret Ceremony&quot; in England with Elizabeth Taylor and Robert Mitchum. While filming, Mitchum told her that &quot;True Grit&quot; director Henry Hathaway had a reputation for being rude to actresses. Farrow asked producer Hal Wallis to replace Hathaway. Wallis refused; Farrow quit the role, which was then given to Kim Darby.

&quot;Secret Ceremony&quot; divided critics but has developed a devoted following. Farrow&#x27;s other late 1960s films include &quot;John and Mary&quot; (1969) opposite Dustin Hoffman. She earned a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress in a Comedy or Musical.

===1970–1979: Theater work and mainstream success===
Beginning in the early 1970s, Farrow appeared onstage in numerous classical plays in London, beginning with the Royal Shakespeare Company&#x27;s 1971 production of &quot;Jeanne d&#x27;Arc au bûcher&quot;in which she portrayed Joan of Arcat the Royal Albert Hall. Farrow made history as the first American actress to join the Royal Shakespeare Company. The same year, she appeared in the British horror film &quot;See No Evil&quot;, portraying a blind woman whose family is stalked by a killer. Though he gave the film a mixed review, Roger Greenspun of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that Farrow &quot;plays her blind patrician with exactly the right small depth of pathos and vulnerable nobility.&quot; Farrow also starred in the television film &quot;Goodbye, Raggedy Ann&quot; (1971), playing an unstable Hollywood starlet. In 1972, Farrow starred in the French black comedy film &quot;Dr. Popaul&quot;, opposite Jean-Paul Belmondo, as a secretary who marries a womanizer, and in Carol Reed&#x27;s &quot;Follow Me!&quot; as a woman suspected of having an affair by her wealthy husband. Onstage, she starred as the lead in a 1972 stage production of &quot;Mary Rose&quot;, followed by the role of Irina in &quot;The Three Sisters&quot;, and a dual role in &quot;The House of Bernarda Alba&quot; (both 1973).

Farrow was cast as Daisy Buchanan in the 1974 Paramount Pictures film adaptation of &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;, directed by Jack Clayton. The film was a commercial success, grossing over $25 million in the United States, while &quot;Variety&quot; deemed it &quot;the most concerted attempt to probe the peculiar ethos of the Beautiful People of the 1920s.&quot; In 1975, Farrow was cast as the lead in a stage production of &quot;The Marrying of Ann Leete&quot;, followed by &quot;The Zykovs&quot; (1976), both of which were staged at the Aldwych Theatre. She again appeared at the Aldwych in the 1976 production of &quot;Ivanov&quot;, portraying Sasha. She also appeared onscreen, portraying Peter Pan in the television musical film &quot;Peter Pan&quot; (1976), and as a woman haunted by the ghost of a deceased girl in the horror film &quot;Full Circle&quot; (1977).

Farrow had a supporting role in Robert Altman&#x27;s comedy &quot;A Wedding&quot; (1978), playing the mute daughter of a trucking company tycoon. The same year, she starred with Rock Hudson in the disaster film &quot;Avalanche&quot;, followed by the British Agatha Christie adaptation &quot;Death on the Nile&quot;. In 1979, Farrow appeared on Broadway opposite Anthony Perkins in the play &quot;Romantic Comedy&quot; by Bernard Slade, and in the romance film &quot;Hurricane&quot;, opposite Jason Robards.

===1980–1992: Collaborations with Woody Allen===

Beginning in the 1980s, Farrow had a decade-long relationship with director Woody Allen; they collaborated on many of his films. Her first film with Allen was the comedy &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Sex Comedy&quot; (1982), in a role originally intended for Diane Keaton. She next appeared in Allen&#x27;s &quot;Zelig&quot; (1983), portraying a psychiatrist whose patient, Leonard Zelig (Allen), takes on characteristics of those around him in an effort to be liked.

In &quot;Broadway Danny Rose&quot; (1984), Farrow starred as the mistress of a washed-up lounge musician who becomes involved with the mob. Both her character, and the film, were inspired by a woman she and Allen had frequently encountered while dining at Rao&#x27;s, an Italian restaurant in East Harlem. Farrow gained weight for the role and adopted a thick Italian-American accent; Allen biographer John Bailey described her as &quot;unrecognizable&quot; in the role. Farrow gained critical notice for this role, and she was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Comedy or Musical. Allen subsequently reflected that her performance was a &quot;very, very brave thing for her to do,&quot; as the majority of her scenes required her to wear sunglasses that block view of her eyes. Farrow also voiced the title role in the animated film &quot;The Last Unicorn&quot; (1982). After &quot;Broadway Danny Rose&quot;, Farrow had a supporting role in Jeannot Szwarc&#x27;s superhero film &quot;Supergirl&quot; (1984), playing Alura In-Ze, the mother of Supergirl. The film was considered a box office bomb, earning $13 million against its $35 million budget.

Farrow reunited with Allen for his &quot;The Purple Rose of Cairo&quot; (1985), which follows a film character (portrayed by Jeff Daniels) who emerges from the screen and enters the real world. He falls in love with a waitress (Farrow). Farrow earned a BAFTA nomination for Best Actress and a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress in a Comedy or Musical. Allen next cast Farrow as the lead in his drama &quot;Hannah and Her Sisters&quot; (1986), which follows a New York City family over a period of two years between two Thanksgivings. In the film, Farrow starred as the titular Hannah opposite Barbara Hershey and Dianne Wiest (who portray her sisters), and Michael Caine as her husband. Released in February 1986, &quot;Hannah and Her Sisters&quot; was a box-office hit, grossing $35 million in the United States during its original theatrical release. The film was praised by critic Roger Ebert, who felt it was Allen&#x27;s best work to date. Farrow earned her third BAFTA nomination, again in the category of Best Leading Actress.

In 1987, Farrow appeared in two films directed by Allen: the comedy &quot;Radio Days&quot;, in which she had a supporting role as an aspiring radio star; and the drama &quot;September&quot;, in which she played a woman haunted by her killing of her mother&#x27;s abusive lover. Farrow shot the latter film twice, originally with her own mother Maureen O&#x27;Sullivan playing her character&#x27;s mother in the film. Displeased with the final cut, Allen decided to recast several roles and reshoot the film entirely. The second and final version featured Elaine Stritch as Farrow&#x27;s mother in the film. Farrow was subsequently cast opposite Gena Rowlands in Allen&#x27;s drama &quot;Another Woman&quot; (1988), which follows a philosophy professor (Rowlands) who becomes acquainted with a troubled woman undergoing an existential crisis (Farrow). While the film earned praise from critics such as Roger Ebert, its screenplay and dialogue were criticized by Vincent Canby in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. He described it as &quot;full of an earnest teen-age writer&#x27;s superfluous words.&quot; In 1989, Farrow starred in a segment of Allen&#x27;s anthology film &quot;New York Stories&quot;, playing the &quot;shiksa&quot; fiancée of a Jewish man (Allen). She appeared in a supporting role in his film &quot;Crimes and Misdemeanors&quot; (1989), portraying a producer who falls in love with a documentary filmmaker.

She was next cast by Allen in his fantasy film &quot;Alice&quot; (1990), marking the couple&#x27;s 11th collaboration. In &quot;Alice&quot;, Farrow portrays the title character, an upper-class Manhattan woman who becomes enamored with a jazz musician. Her attraction results in feelings of Catholic guilt that manifest as physical ailments which she attempts to treat with herbal medicine. Vincent Canby praised her portrayal as career-defining, writing: &quot;Miss Farrow gives a performance that sums up and then tops all of the performances that have preceded it.&quot; She was nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Comedy or Musical, and won a National Board of Review award for Best Actress. The next year, Farrow appeared as a circus performer in Allen&#x27;s black-and-white comedy &quot;Shadows and Fog&quot;.

Farrow had a lead role in Allen&#x27;s drama &quot;Husbands and Wives&quot; (1992), in which she portrayed the wife of a writer and professor (Allen) having an affair with one of his students. &quot;Husbands and Wives&quot; marked Farrow&#x27;s final collaboration with Allen. It was released shortly after the couple&#x27;s highly publicized separation. Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; noted in his review of the film that much of its audience would watch it &quot;for the titillation of seeing Allen make out with a 21-year-old and go through a wrenching split from Farrow onscreen. Even those who enter in this frame of mind, however, probably will put these thoughts aside for the most part as they become involved in the romantic longings and verbal crossfire of a host of interesting, difficult, intersecting characters.&quot;

===1993–1999: Film and television; return to stage===

Citing the need to devote herself to raising her young children, Farrow worked less frequently during the 1990s. But she appeared in leading roles in several films, including the Irish film &quot;Widows&#x27; Peak&quot; (1994), in which she starred as &quot;Miss O&#x27;Hare&quot;, the mysterious victim of a vengeful, matriarchal figure in a small Irish village. She also appeared in the comedy &quot;Miami Rhapsody&quot; (1995), playing the mother of a single woman in her thirties (played by Sarah Jessica Parker).

That year Farrow also had a lead role in the film adaptation of Craig Lucas&#x27; Off-Broadway play &quot;Reckless&quot; (1995), a dark comedy in which she portrayed a woman whose husband arranges a contract killing against her. Critic Stephen Holden praised her performance, writing: &quot;Ms. Farrow is so perfectly cast as Rachel that the character seems a distillation of nearly every role she has played since she was a teen-ager in &quot;Peyton Place&quot;.&quot; In the spring of 1996, Farrow had an uncredited voice role in the Broadway play &quot;Getting Away with Murder&quot;, appearing in a pre-recorded voice message.

In 1997, Farrow published her autobiography, &quot;What Falls Away&quot;. She had a cameo appearance as herself in Howard Stern&#x27;s biographical comedy, &quot;Private Parts&quot;. She appeared on television in the 1998 &quot;The Wonderful World of Disney&quot; segment &quot;Miracle at Midnight&quot;, a dramatization of the Rescue of the Danish Jews during the Holocaust. Will Joyner of &quot;The New York Times&quot; credited Farrow&#x27;s performance in the segment as &quot;crucial to the production&#x27;s success.&quot; Farrow was next cast as a woman suffering Alzheimer&#x27;s disease in the television film &quot;Forget Me Never&quot;. Critic Steven Linan of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; praised Farrow, writing that she &quot;convincingly conveys the fear and insecurity that accompany such a downward spiral.&quot; Her portrayal earned her her seventh Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress, in the category of Miniseries or Television Film. Also in 1999, Farrow appeared in the comedy &quot;Coming Soon&quot;, playing the hippie mother of a high school student.

In November 1999, Farrow returned to Broadway portraying Honey in a staged reading of &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?&quot;, opposite Matthew Broderick, Jonathan Pryce, and Uta Hagen. Vincent Canby praised the production in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, writing that &quot;as performed by Mr. Broderick and Ms. Farrow, Nick and Honey took on dimensions I have never seen before.&quot; The reading was subsequently staged in Los Angeles in the spring of 2000.

===2000–present: Later film, television, and theater===
During the 2000s, Farrow appeared on television. She began with a recurring role on the series &quot;Third Watch&quot;, in which she guest-starred in five episodes between 2000 and 2003. Farrow also appeared in the 2001 LGBT-themed television film &quot;A Girl Thing&quot;, opposite Kate Capshaw and Stockard Channing, followed by a lead in the Lifetime film &quot;The Secret Life of Zoey&quot; in 2002. She also appeared in a touring stage production of &quot;The Exonerated&quot; the same year, followed by the lead in &quot;Fran&#x27;s Bed&quot;, staged at Connecticut&#x27;s Long Wharf Theatre in the fall of 2003. She subsequently had a supporting part in the children&#x27;s television film &quot;&quot; (2004).
Farrow made her first feature film appearance in several years as Mrs. Baylock, a Satanic nanny, in the remake of &quot;The Omen&quot; (2006). Although the film received a lukewarm critical reception, Farrow&#x27;s performance was widely praised. The Associated Press declared &quot;thank heaven for Mia Farrow&quot; and said her performance was &quot;a rare instance of the new &quot;Omen&quot; improving on the old one.&quot; The &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot; also praised her performance, describing it as &quot;a truly delicious comeback role... Farrow [is] chillingly believable as a sweet-talking nanny from hell.&quot;

Farrow subsequently appeared as the mother of a Manhattan attorney (played by Amanda Peet) in the romantic comedy &quot;The Ex&quot; (2007), also starring opposite Jason Bateman and Zach Braff. The film was poorly received by critics, with several writing that the cast&#x27;s talents were underserved by the material. Farrow next voiced Daisy Suchot in Luc Besson&#x27;s animated fantasy film &quot;Arthur and the Invisibles&quot; (2007).

The following year, Farrow appeared in a supporting role opposite Danny Glover in Michel Gondry&#x27;s comedy &quot;Be Kind Rewind&quot; (2008), playing the friend and patron of a video store operator in suburban New Jersey. She also provided voice narration for the documentary film &quot;As We Forgive&quot; (2008), which recounts the stories of two Rwandan women who confronted the individuals who murdered their families during the Rwandan genocide. In 2009, Farrow reprised her voice role as Daisy Suchot in &quot;Arthur and the Revenge of Maltazard&quot;, and she also reprised it for &quot;Arthur 3: The War of the Two Worlds&quot; (2010). She was subsequently cast in a supporting role in the comedy-drama &quot;Dark Horse&quot;, directed by Todd Solondz, in which she played the mother of a stunted 35-year-old man.

In September 2014, Farrow returned to Broadway in the play &quot;Love Letters&quot;. The play was well received by critics, with Charles Isherwood of &quot;The New York Times&quot; deeming Farrow&#x27;s performance &quot;utterly extraordinary...  as the flighty, unstable and writing-averse Melissa Gardner.&quot; In 2016, Farrow appeared with Faye Dunaway in an episode of the IFC mockumentary series &quot;Documentary Now!&quot;. In 2022 Farrow appeared in Ryan Murphy&#x27;s Netflix series &quot;The Watcher&quot;. It was announced that Farrow would make her return to Broadway in the Jen Silverman play &quot;The Roommate&quot; starring opposite Patti LuPone at the Booth Theatre in August 2024.

==Awards and nominations==
==Humanitarian activities==

Farrow became a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador in 2000 and is a high-profile advocate for human rights in Africa, particularly for children&#x27;s rights. She has worked to raise funds and awareness for children in conflict-affected regions and to draw attention to the fight to eradicate polio. Farrow has received several awards for her humanitarian work including the Leon Sullivan International Service award, the Lyndon Baines Johnson Moral Courage Award and the Marion Anderson Award. In 2006, Farrow and her son Ronan visited Berlin in order to participate in a charity auction of United Buddy Bears, which feature designs by artists representing 142 U.N. member states. In 2008, &quot;Time&quot; magazine named her one of the most influential people in the world.

She has traveled to Darfur several times for humanitarian efforts, first in 2004. Her third trip was in 2007, with a film crew engaged in making the documentary &quot;Darfur: On Our Watch&quot;. The same year, she co-founded the Olympic Dream for Darfur campaign, which drew attention to China&#x27;s support for the government of Sudan. The campaign hoped to change China&#x27;s policy by embarrassing it in the run-up to the 2008 Summer Olympics held in Beijing. In March 2007, China said it would urge Sudan to engage with the international community. The campaign persuaded Steven Spielberg to withdraw as an artistic adviser to the opening ceremony. During the Olympics, Farrow televised via the internet from a Sudanese refugee camp to highlight China&#x27;s involvement in the region.
Later in 2007, Farrow offered to &quot;trade her freedom&quot; for the freedom of a humanitarian worker for the Sudan Liberation Army who was being treated in a UN hospital while under threat of arrest. She wanted to be taken captive in exchange for his being allowed to leave the country. Farrow is also a board member of the Washington, D.C.–based non-profit Darfur Women Action Group (DWAG).

In 2009, Farrow narrated a documentary, &quot;As We Forgive&quot;, relating the struggle of many of the survivors of the Rwandan genocide to forgive those who murdered family and friends. To show &quot;solidarity with the people of Darfur&quot; Farrow began a water-only fast on April 27, 2009. Farrow&#x27;s goal was to fast for three weeks, but she called a halt after twelve days on the advice of her doctor. In August 2010, she testified in the trial against former Liberian President Charles Taylor in the Special Court for Sierra Leone.

Farrow helped build The Darfur Archives, which document the cultural traditions of the tribes of Darfur. She has filmed some 40 hours of songs, dances, children&#x27;s stories, farming methods and accounts of genocide in the region&#x27;s refugee camps that make up the current archives. Since 2011, the Archives have been housed at the Thomas J. Dodd Research Center at the University of Connecticut. In 2013, Farrow criticized President Barack Obama for his lack of address regarding Sudanese genocide during a United Nations General Assembly. In February 2015, Farrow appeared in an episode of &quot;A Path Appears&quot;, a PBS documentary series from the creators of the Half the Sky movement. In the episode Farrow travels to Kibera, Kenya&#x27;s largest slum, to share stories from organizations providing education to at-risk girls.

Farrow has also participated in environmental activism, in 2014 protesting against Chevron, accusing the oil company of environmental damage in the South American rainforest.

==Personal life==
===Religious and political beliefs===
Farrow was raised as a Catholic and in a 2013 interview with Piers Morgan, she stated that she had not &quot;lost her faith in God.&quot; In 1968, when she was 23 years 
old, Farrow spent part of the year living at the ashram of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in Rishikesh, Uttarakhand, India, studying Transcendental Meditation. Her visit received worldwide media attention at the time because of the presence of all four members of the Beatles, Donovan, Mike Love, and her sister, Prudence Farrow. The behavior of her sister Prudence during this trip inspired John Lennon to write the song &quot;Dear Prudence&quot;. The trip also inspired the song &quot;Sexy Sadie&quot;, originally titled &#x27;Maharishi&#x27;, which was written by John Lennon in response to alleged sexual advances made by the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi towards Mia Farrow. Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Cynthia Lennon have later said that they believe the story to have been fabricated. 

Farrow has stated that she has long been a registered Independent, though she has consistently voted for Democratic candidates. In the 2016 Democratic presidential election, Farrow publicly endorsed Democratic Party candidate Bernie Sanders, though she subsequently stated that &quot;as a pragmatist&quot; she planned to vote for Hillary Clinton. Farrow tweeted in support of Joe Biden during the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries, but later added that she would vote for Sanders if he was nominated.

===Marriages and relationships===
==== Frank Sinatra ====
On July 19, 1966, she married singer Frank Sinatra at the Las Vegas home of Jack Entratter. Farrow was 21 years old; Sinatra 50. Sinatra wanted Farrow to give up her acting career, which she initially agreed to do. She accompanied Sinatra while he was shooting several films, but soon grew tired of doing nothing and signed on to star in Roman Polanski&#x27;s horror film &quot;Rosemary&#x27;s Baby&quot;.

Filming of &quot;Rosemary&#x27;s Baby&quot; ran over its initial schedule, which angered Sinatra, who had cast Farrow in a role in his film &quot;The Detective&quot; (1968). After Farrow failed to report for filming, Sinatra cast Jacqueline Bisset in Farrow&#x27;s role.

In November 1967, while Farrow was filming &quot;Rosemary&#x27;s Baby&quot;, Sinatra&#x27;s lawyer served her with divorce papers. Their divorce was finalized in August 1968.

Farrow later blamed the demise of the marriage on their age difference and said she was an &quot;impossibly immature teenager&quot; when she married Sinatra. The two remained friends until Sinatra&#x27;s death.

==== André Previn ====
On September 10, 1970, Farrow married conductor and composer André Previn in London. She was 25, and he was 41.

Farrow had begun a relationship with Previn while he was still married to his second wife, songwriter Dory Previn. When Farrow became pregnant, Previn left Dory and filed for divorce. Farrow, with two stepdaughters Claudia Previn and Alicia Previn, gave birth to twin sons in February 1970, and Previn&#x27;s divorce from Dory became final in July 1970.

Dory Previn later wrote a scathing song, titled &quot;Beware of Young Girls&quot;, about the loss of her husband to Farrow.

Previn and Farrow divorced in 1979.

==== Woody Allen ====
In 1980, Farrow began a relationship with film director Woody Allen.

During their years together, Farrow starred in thirteen of Allen&#x27;s films including, &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Sex Comedy&quot; (1982), &quot;Zelig&quot; (1983), &quot;Broadway Danny Rose&quot; (1984), &quot;The Purple Rose of Cairo&quot; (1985), &quot;Hannah and Her Sisters&quot; (1986), &quot;Radio Days&quot; (1987), &quot;September&quot; (1987), &quot;Another Woman&quot; (1988), &quot;Crimes and Misdemeanors&quot; (1989), &quot;Alice&quot; (1990), &quot;Shadows and Fog&quot; (1991), and her final film with Allen, &quot;Husbands and Wives&quot; (1992).

Several of her relatives made appearances in Allen&#x27;s films, including her mother, Maureen O&#x27;Sullivan, in &quot;Hannah and Her Sisters&quot;.

Their relationship ended in 1992 when Allen&#x27;s intimate relationship with Soon-Yi Previn, Farrow&#x27;s 21-year-old adopted daughter, was publicized.

===Children===
Farrow has fourteen children: four biological and ten adopted. She and former husband André Previn have three biological sons: twins Matthew and Sascha (born February 26, 1970), and Fletcher (born March 14, 1974). Sascha is a graduate of Fordham University, while Fletcher, a graduate of Connecticut College, became the chief information officer of IBM. Farrow and Previn adopted Vietnamese infants Lark Song Previn and Summer &quot;Daisy&quot; Song Previn, in 1973 and 1976, respectively, followed by the adoption of Soon-Yi from Korea in 1977. Soon-Yi&#x27;s precise birth date is not known, but a bone scan estimated her age as from 5 to 7, at the time of her adoption. The Seoul Family Court established a Family Census Register (legal birth document) on her behalf on December 28, 1976, with a presumptive birth date of October 8, 1970.

In 1980, following her divorce from Previn, Farrow adopted Moses Farrow, a two-year-old Korean orphan with cerebral palsy. In 1985, Farrow adopted Dylan Farrow (born July 1985, adopted at two weeks old). Dylan was known as &quot;Eliza&quot; for some time and also as &quot;Malone&quot;. In December 1991, a New York City court allowed Woody Allen to co-adopt Dylan and Moses.

With Allen, Farrow gave birth to her fourth and final biological child, son Satchel Ronan O&#x27;Sullivan Farrow (later known simply as Ronan Farrow), on December 19, 1987. In a 2013 interview with &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, Farrow stated Ronan could &quot;possibly&quot; be the biological child of Frank Sinatra, with whom she claimed to have &quot;never really split up.&quot; In a 2015 &quot;CBS Sunday Morning&quot; interview, Sinatra&#x27;s daughter Nancy dismissed the idea that her father is also the biological father of Ronan Farrow, calling it &quot;nonsense&quot;. She said that her children were affected by the rumor because they were being questioned about it. &quot;I was kind of cranky with Mia for even saying &#x27;possibly,&#x27;&quot; she said. &quot;I was cranky with her for saying that because she knew better, you know, she really did. But she was making a joke! And it was taken very serious and was just silly, stupid.&quot;

Between 1992 and 1995, Farrow adopted five more children: Tam Farrow; Kaeli-Shea Farrow, later known as Quincy Maureen Farrow; Frankie-Minh; Isaiah Justus; and Gabriel Wilk Farrow, later known as Thaddeus Wilk Farrow and named after Elliott Wilk, the judge who oversaw Farrow&#x27;s 1993 legal battle with Allen.

Tam Farrow died in 2000 at the age of 21. Farrow&#x27;s spokeswoman Judy Hofflund stated that she died of cardiac arrest. In May 2018, Moses Farrow made claims on his personal blog that Tam had actually died from a prescription medication overdose following a lifelong battle with depression, and after a fight with her mother. In 2021, Mia Farrow confirmed Moses&#x27; claim that Tam had died after an overdose of a prescription medication. On December 25, 2008, Lark Previn died at the age of 35 from complications of HIV/AIDS. On September 21, 2016, Thaddeus Farrow was found dead in his car in Connecticut at the age of 27. It was ruled that he had committed suicide by shooting himself in the torso while inside his car.

Farrow has six biological granddaughters from her and Previn&#x27;s sons (three by Matthew, one by Sascha, and two by Fletcher). She has nine grandchildren from her adopted children.

==Abuse allegations==

===Abuse allegation against Allen===

According to court testimony, on August 4, 1992, Allen visited Farrow&#x27;s farm in Bridgewater, Connecticut, while she was out shopping. The following day, August 5, a babysitter informed Farrow that she had witnessed Allen behaving strangely with the couple&#x27;s then-seven-year-old adopted daughter, Dylan. When Farrow asked Dylan about the alleged incident, Dylan responded that Allen had touched her &quot;private part&quot; while the two were alone in the attic of the home. One of the women employed to care for Farrow&#x27;s children claimed that for around 20 minutes that afternoon she had not known where Dylan was, while a second said that, at one point, she noticed Dylan had been wearing no underwear beneath her dress. Farrow reported the incident to the family&#x27;s pediatrician, who in turn reported the allegations to authorities. Allen was informed of the accusations on August 6. A week later, on August 13, Allen sued for full custody of his biological son, Satchel, and two of Farrow&#x27;s adopted children, Dylan and Moses, with whom Allen had assumed a parental role.

In March 1993, the lead doctor of Yale New Haven Hospital Child Sexual Abuse Clinic, John Leventhal, gave sworn testimony via a deposition that, in his opinion, Dylan &quot;either invented the story under the stress of living in a volatile and unhealthy home or that it was planted in her mind by her mother&quot; because of the &quot;inconsistent&quot; presentation of the story by Dylan. Leventhal did not meet with Dylan prior to giving his testimony, and instead delivered his findings based on interviews conducted by others. The Yale New Haven Hospital team&#x27;s findings were criticized by the presiding judge, and later by other experts in the field. In particular, the team&#x27;s behavior was considered unusual for making conclusive statements about innocence and guilt instead of reporting on behavior, for refusing to testify in court when asked, and for destroying all of their notes. Justice Elliott Wilk stated that the investigating team&#x27;s behavior had &quot;resulted in a report which was sanitized, and therefore, less credible&quot; and that its recommendations and statements had &quot;exceed[ed] its mandate.&quot; He concluded, &quot;I am less certain, however, than is the Yale-New Haven team, that the evidence proves conclusively that there was no sexual abuse.&quot;

In his final decision, in June 1993, Justice Wilk stated that he found &quot;no credible evidence to support Mr. Allen&#x27;s contention that Ms. Farrow coached Dylan or that Ms. Farrow acted upon a desire for revenge against him for seducing Soon-Yi. Mr. Allen&#x27;s resort to the stereotypical &#x27;woman scorned&#x27; defense is an injudicious attempt to divert attention from his failure to act as a responsible parent and adult.&quot; He rejected Allen&#x27;s bid for full custody and denied him visitation rights with Dylan, stating that even though the full truth of the allegations may never be known, &quot;the credible testimony of Ms. Farrow, Dr. Coates, Dr. Leventhal and Mr. Allen does, however, prove that Mr. Allen&#x27;s behavior toward Dylan was grossly inappropriate and that measures must be taken to protect her.&quot; In September 1993, the state&#x27;s attorney, Frank Maco, announced he would not pursue Allen in court for the molestation allegations, despite having &quot;probable cause&quot;, citing his and Farrow&#x27;s desire not to traumatize Dylan further.

In February 2014, Dylan publicly renewed her claims of sexual abuse against Allen, in an open letter published by Nicholas Kristof, a friend of Farrow, in his &quot;New York Times&quot; blog. Allen repeated his denial of the allegations and also addressed in detail how and why the allegations against him were false in his 2020 memoir entitled “Apropos of Nothing”.

=== Abuse allegations against Farrow ===
Soon Yi Previn and Moses Farrow have defended Allen against the abuse allegations. In 2013, Moses Farrow publicly asserted that Mia had coached her children into believing stories she made up about Allen. 

In 2018, Moses published a lengthy blog post arguing for Allen&#x27;s innocence. Moses also recounted a series of incidents in which he and his siblings were physically abused by Farrow.

====Later relationships====
Farrow states that she would no longer bring dates or significant others into her home in the years following the abuse allegations due to lingering mistrust. She explained, &quot;I didn&#x27;t want to risk anybody falling for one of my beautiful children or grandchildren,&quot; and, &quot;I would never take another risk with anybody else.&quot;

<text>The European honey buzzard (Pernis apivorus), also known as the pern or common pern, is a bird of prey in the family Accipitridae.

==Taxonomy==
The European honey buzzard was formally described in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with the falcons and eagles in the genus &quot;Falco&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Falco apivorus&quot;. Linnaeus cited earlier works including the 1678 description by the English naturalist Francis Willughby and the 1713 description by John Ray. The European honey buzzard is now one of four species placed in the genus &quot;Pernis&quot; that was introduced by Georges Cuvier in 1816. The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised. The binomen is derived from Ancient Greek &quot;pernes&quot; πέρνης, a term used by Aristotle for a bird of prey, and Latin &quot;apivorus&quot; &quot;bee-eating&quot;, from &quot;apis&quot;, &quot;bee&quot; and &quot;-vorus&quot;, &quot;-eating&quot;. In fact, bees are much less important than wasps in the birds&#x27; diet. Note that it is accordingly called (&quot;wasp buzzard&quot;) in German and similarly in some other Germanic languages and also in Hungarian (&quot;darázsölyv&quot;).

Despite its English name, this species is more closely related to kites of the genera &quot;Leptodon&quot; and &quot;Chondrohierax&quot; than to true buzzards in &quot;Buteo&quot;.

==Description==

The -long honey buzzard is larger and longer winged, with a wingspan, when compared to the smaller common buzzard (&quot;Buteo buteo&quot;). It appears longer necked with a small head, and soars on flat wings. It has a longer tail, which has fewer bars than the &quot;Buteo&quot; buzzard, usually with two narrow dark bars and a broad dark subterminal bar. The sexes can be distinguished on plumage, which is unusual for a large bird of prey. The male has a blue-grey head, while the female&#x27;s head is brown. The female is slightly larger and darker than the male.

The soaring jizz is quite diagnostic; the wings are held straight with the wing tips horizontal or sometimes slightly pointed down. The head protrudes forwards with a slight kink downwards and sometimes a very angular chest can be seen, similar to a sparrowhawk, although this may not be diagnostic. The angular chest is most pronounced when seen in direct flight with tail narrowed. The call is a clear &quot;peee-lu&quot;.

==Distribution and habitat==
The European honey buzzard is a summer migrant to a relatively small area in the western Palearctic from most of Europe to as far east as southwestern Siberia. The eastern area boundary is not yet known exactly, it is thought to be in the Tomsk–Novosibirsk–Barnaul area. It is seen in a wide range of habitats, but generally prefers woodland and exotic plantations. It migrates to tropical Africa for European winters.

===Movements===
Being a long-distance migrant, the honey buzzard relies on magnetic orientation to find its way south, as well as a visual memory of remarkable geographical features such as mountain ranges and rivers, along the way. It avoids large expanses of water over which it cannot soar. Accordingly, great numbers of honey buzzards can be seen crossing the Mediterranean Sea over its narrowest stretches, such as the Gibraltar Strait, the Messina Strait, the Bosphorus, Lebanon, or in Israel.

===Status in Britain===
The bird is an uncommon breeder in, and a scarce though increasing migrant to, Britain. Its most well-known summer population is in the New Forest (Hampshire) but it is also found in the Tyne Valley (Northumberland), Wareham Forest (Dorset), Swanton Novers Great Wood (Norfolk), the Neath Valleys (South Wales), the Clumber Park area (Nottinghamshire), near Wykeham Forest (North Yorkshire), Haldon Forest Park (Devon) and elsewhere.

===Mimicry===
The similarity in plumage between juvenile European honey buzzard and common buzzard may have arisen as a partial protection against predation by Eurasian goshawks. Although that formidable predator is capable of killing both species, it is likely to be more cautious about attacking the better protected &quot;Buteo&quot; species, with its stronger bill and talons. Similar Batesian mimicry is shown by the Asian &quot;Pernis&quot; species, which resemble the &quot;Spizaetus&quot; hawk-eagles.

==Behaviour==
It is sometimes seen soaring in thermals. When flying in wooded vegetation, honey buzzards usually fly quite low and perch in midcanopy, holding the body relatively horizontal with its tail drooping. The bird also hops from branch to branch, each time flapping its wings once, and so emitting a loud clap. The bird often appears restless with much ruffling of the wings and shifting around on its perch. The honey buzzard often inspects possible locations of food from its perch, cocking its head this way and that to get a good look at possible food locations. This behaviour is reminiscent of an inquisitive parrot.

===Breeding===

The honey buzzard breeds in woodland, and is inconspicuous except in the spring, when the mating display includes wing-clapping. Breeding males are fiercely territorial. The clutch typically consists of two eggs, less often one or three. Siblicide is rarely observed.

===Feeding===
It is a specialist feeder, living mainly on the larvae and nests of wasps and hornets, although it will take small mammals, reptiles, and birds. It is the only known predator of the invasive Asian hornet. It spends large amounts of time on the forest floor excavating wasp nests. It is equipped with long toes and claws adapted to raking and digging, and scale-like feathering on its head, thought to be a defence against the stings of its prey. Honey buzzards are thought to have a chemical deterrent in their feathers that protects them from wasp attacks.

==In culture==
The honey buzzard was historically considered a winter delicacy in Europe, with 19th century texts stating it was frequently caught in winter and described as &quot;fat and delicious eating&quot;.

<text>Interim Standard 95 (IS-95) was the first digital cellular technology that used code-division multiple access (CDMA). It was developed by Qualcomm and later adopted as a standard by the Telecommunications Industry Association in TIA/EIA/IS-95 release published in 1995. The proprietary name for IS-95 is cdmaOne.

It is a 2G mobile telecommunications standard that uses CDMA, a multiple access scheme for digital radio, to send voice, data and signaling data (such as a dialed telephone number) between mobile telephones and cell sites. CDMA transmits streams of bits (PN codes). CDMA permits several radios to share the same frequencies. Unlike time-division multiple access (TDMA), a competing system used in 2G GSM, all radios can be active all the time, because network capacity does not directly limit the number of active radios. Since larger numbers of phones can be served by smaller numbers of cell-sites, CDMA-based standards have a significant economic advantage over TDMA-based standards, or the oldest cellular standards that used frequency-division multiplexing.

In North America, the technology competed with Digital AMPS (IS-136), a TDMA-based standard, as well as with the TDMA-based GSM. It was supplanted by IS-2000 (CDMA2000), a later CDMA-based standard.

==Protocol revisions==
cdmaOne&#x27;s technical history is reflective of both its birth as a Qualcomm internal project, and the world of then-unproven competing digital cellular standards under which it was developed. The term IS-95 generically applies to the earlier set of protocol revisions, namely P_REV&#x27;s one through five.

P_REV=1 was developed under an ANSI standards process with documentation reference &quot;J-STD-008&quot;. J-STD-008, published in 1995, was only defined for the then-new North American PCS band (Band Class 1, 1900 MHz). The term &quot;IS-95&quot; properly refers to P_REV=1, developed under the Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA) standards process, for the North American cellular band (Band Class 0, 800 MHz) under roughly the same time frame. IS-95 offered interoperation (including handoff) with the analog cellular network. For digital operation, IS-95 and J-STD-008 have most technical details in common. The immature style and structure of both documents are highly reflective of the &quot;standardizing&quot; of Qualcomm&#x27;s internal project.

P_REV=2 is termed &quot;Interim Standard 95A (IS-95A)&quot;. IS-95A was developed for Band Class 0 only, as in incremental improvement over IS-95 in the TIA standards process.

P_REV=3 is termed &quot;Technical Services Bulletin 74 (TSB-74)&quot;. TSB-74 was the next incremental improvement over IS-95A in the TIA standards process.

P_REV=4 is termed &quot;Interim Standard 95B (IS-95B) Phase I&quot;, and P_REV=5 is termed &quot;Interim Standard 95B (IS-95B) Phase II&quot;. The IS-95B standards track provided for a merging of the TIA and ANSI standards tracks under the TIA, and was the first document that provided for interoperation of IS-95 mobile handsets in both band classes (dual-band operation). P_REV=4 was by far the most popular variant of IS-95, with P_REV=5 only seeing minimal uptake in South Korea.

P_REV=6 and beyond fall under the CDMA2000 umbrella. Besides technical improvements, the IS-2000 documents are much more mature in terms of layout and content. They also provide backwards-compatibility to IS-95.

==Protocol details==

The IS-95 standards describe an &quot;air interface&quot;, a set of protocols used between mobile units and the network. IS-95 is widely described as a three-layer stack, where L1 corresponds to the physical (PHY) layer, L2 refers to the Media Access Control (MAC) and Link-Access Control (LAC) sublayers, and L3 to the call-processing state machine.

===Physical layer===
IS-95 defines the transmission of signals in both the &quot;forward&quot; (network-to-mobile) and &quot;reverse&quot; (mobile-to-network) directions.

In the forward direction, radio signals are transmitted by base stations (BTS&#x27;s). Every BTS is synchronized with a GPS receiver so transmissions are tightly controlled in time. All forward transmissions are QPSK with a chip rate of 1,228,800 per second. Each signal is spread with a Walsh code of length 64 and a pseudo-random noise code (PN code) of length 215, yielding a PN roll-over period of formula_1 ms. 

For the reverse direction, radio signals are transmitted by the mobile. Reverse link transmissions are OQPSK in order to operate in the optimal range of the mobile&#x27;s power amplifier. Like the forward link, the chip rate is 1,228,800 per second and signals are spread with Walsh codes and the pseudo-random noise code, which is also known as a Short Code.

====Forward broadcast channels====
Every BTS dedicates a significant amount of output power to a &quot;pilot channel&quot;, which is an unmodulated PN sequence (in other words, spread with Walsh code 0). Each BTS sector in the network is assigned a PN offset in steps of 64 chips. There is no data carried on the forward pilot. With its strong autocorrelation function, the forward pilot allows mobiles to determine system timing and distinguish different BTSs for handoff.

When a mobile is &quot;searching&quot;, it is attempting to find pilot signals on the network by tuning to particular radio frequencies and performing a cross-correlation across all possible PN phases. A strong correlation peak result indicates the proximity of a BTS.

Other forward channels, selected by their Walsh code, carry data from the network to the mobiles. Data consists of network signaling and user traffic. Generally, data to be transmitted is divided into frames of bits. A frame of bits is passed through a convolutional encoder, adding forward error correction redundancy, generating a frame of symbols. These symbols are then spread with the Walsh and PN sequences and transmitted.

BTSs transmit a &quot;sync channel&quot; spread with Walsh code 32. The sync channel frame is formula_1 ms long, and its frame boundary is aligned to the pilot. The sync channel continually transmits a single message, the &quot;Sync Channel Message&quot;, which has a length and content dependent on the P_REV. The message is transmitted 32 bits per frame, encoded to 128 symbols, yielding a rate of 1200 bit/s. The Sync Channel Message contains information about the network, including the PN offset used by the BTS sector.

Once a mobile has found a strong pilot channel, it listens to the sync channel and decodes a Sync Channel Message to develop a highly accurate synchronization to system time. At this point the mobile knows whether it is roaming, and that it is &quot;in service&quot;. 

BTSs transmit at least one, and as many as seven, &quot;paging channel&quot;s starting with Walsh code 1. The paging channel frame time is 20 ms, and is time aligned to the IS-95 system (i.e. GPS) 2-second roll-over. There are two possible rates used on the paging channel: 4800 bit/s or 9600 bit/s. Both rates are encoded to 19200 symbols per second.

The paging channel contains signaling messages transmitted from the network to all idle mobiles. A set of messages communicate detailed network overhead to the mobiles, circulating this information while the paging channel is free. The paging channel also carries higher-priority messages dedicated to setting up calls to and from the mobiles.

When a mobile is idle, it is mostly listening to a paging channel. Once a mobile has parsed all the network overhead information, it &quot;registers&quot; with the network, then optionally enters &quot;slotted-mode&quot;. Both of these processes are described in more detail below.

====Forward traffic channels====
The Walsh space not dedicated to broadcast channels on the BTS sector is available for &quot;traffic channel&quot;s. These channels carry the individual voice and data calls supported by IS-95. Like the paging channel, traffic channels have a frame time of 20ms.

Since voice and user data are intermittent, the traffic channels support variable-rate operation. Every 20 ms frame may be transmitted at a different rate, as determined by the service in use (voice or data). P_REV=1 and P_REV=2 supported &quot;rate set 1&quot;, providing a rate of 1200, 2400, 4800, or 9600 bit/s. P_REV=3 and beyond also provided &quot;rate set 2&quot;, yielding rates of 1800, 3600, 7200, or 14400 bit/s.

For voice calls, the traffic channel carries frames of &quot;vocoder&quot; data. A number of different vocoders are defined under IS-95, the earlier of which were limited to rate set 1, and were responsible for some user complaints of poor voice quality. More sophisticated vocoders, taking advantage of modern DSPs and rate set 2, remedied the voice quality situation and are still in wide use in 2005.

The mobile receiving a variable-rate traffic frame does not know the rate at which the frame was transmitted. Typically, the frame is decoded at each possible rate, and using the quality metrics of the Viterbi decoder, the correct result is chosen.

Traffic channels may also carry circuit-switch data calls in IS-95. The variable-rate traffic frames are generated using the IS-95 &quot;Radio Link Protocol (RLP)&quot;. RLP provides a mechanism to improve the performance of the wireless link for data. Where voice calls might tolerate the dropping of occasional 20 ms frames, a data call would have unacceptable performance without RLP. 

Under IS-95B P_REV=5, it was possible for a user to use up to seven supplemental &quot;code&quot; (traffic) channels simultaneously to increase the throughput of a data call. Very few mobiles or networks ever provided this feature, which could in theory offer 115200 bit/s to a user.

====Block Interleaver====
After convolution coding and repetition, symbols are sent to a 20 ms block interleaver, which is a 24 by 16 array.
====Capacity====
IS-95 and its use of CDMA techniques, like any other communications system, have their throughput limited according to Shannon&#x27;s theorem. Accordingly, capacity improves with SNR and bandwidth. IS-95 has a fixed bandwidth, but fares well in the digital world because it takes active steps to improve SNR.

With CDMA, signals that are not correlated with the channel of interest (such as other PN offsets from adjacent cellular base stations) appear as noise, and signals carried on other Walsh codes (that are properly time aligned) are essentially removed in the de-spreading process. The variable-rate nature of traffic channels provide lower-rate frames to be transmitted at lower power causing less noise for other signals still to be correctly received. These factors provide an inherently lower noise level than other cellular technologies allowing the IS-95 network to squeeze more users into the same radio spectrum.

Active (slow) power control is also used on the forward traffic channels, where during a call, the mobile sends signaling messages to the network indicating the quality of the signal. The network will control the transmitted power of the traffic channel to keep the signal quality just good enough, thereby keeping the noise level seen by all other users to a minimum.

The receiver also uses the techniques of the rake receiver to improve SNR as well as perform soft handoff.

===Layer 2===
Once a call is established, a mobile is restricted to using the traffic channel. A frame format is defined in the MAC for the traffic channel that allows the regular voice (vocoder) or data (RLP) bits to be multiplexed with signaling message fragments. The signaling message fragments are pieced together in the LAC, where complete signaling messages are passed on to Layer 3.

<text>Frequency-division multiple access (FDMA) is a channel access method used in some multiple-access protocols. FDMA allows multiple users to send data through a single communication channel, such as a coaxial cable or microwave beam, by dividing the bandwidth of the channel into separate non-overlapping frequency sub-channels and allocating each sub-channel to a separate user. Users can send data through a subchannel by modulating it on a carrier wave at the subchannel&#x27;s frequency. It is used in satellite communication systems and telephone trunklines.

FDMA splits the total bandwidth into multiple channels. Each ground station on the earth is allocated a particular frequency group (or a range of frequencies). Within each group, the ground station can allocate different frequencies to individual channels, which are used by different stations connected to that ground station. Before the transmission begins, the transmitting ground station looks for an empty channel within the frequency range that is allocated to it and once it finds an empty channel, it allocates it to the particular transmitting station.

==Method==
Alternatives include time-division multiple access (TDMA), code-division multiple access (CDMA), or space-division multiple access (SDMA). These protocols are utilized differently, at different levels of the theoretical OSI model.

Disadvantage: Crosstalk may cause interference among frequencies and disrupt the transmission.
* In FDMA, all users share the satellite transponder or frequency channel simultaneously but each user transmits at single frequency.
* FDMA can be used with both analog and digital signal but it generally used with analog signal.
* FDMA requires high-performing filters in the radio hardware, in contrast to TDMA and CDMA.
* FDMA is not vulnerable to the timing problems that TDMA has. Since a predetermined frequency band is available for the entire period of communication, stream data (a continuous flow of data that may not be packetized) can easily be used with FDMA.
* Due to the frequency filtering, FDMA is not sensitive to near–far problem which is pronounced for CDMA.
* Each user transmits and receives at different frequencies as each user gets a unique frequency slot.

FDMA is distinct from frequency division duplexing (FDD). While FDMA allows multiple users simultaneous access to a transmission system, FDD refers to how the radio channel is shared between the uplink and downlink (for instance, the traffic going back and forth between a mobile-phone and a mobile phone base station). Frequency-division multiplexing (FDM) is also distinct from FDMA. FDM is a physical layer technique that combines and transmits low-bandwidth channels through a high-bandwidth channel, like in a car radio. FDMA, on the other hand, is an access method in the data link layer.

FDMA also supports demand assignment in addition to fixed assignment. &quot;Demand assignment&quot; allows all users apparently continuous access of the radio spectrum by assigning carrier frequencies on a temporary basis using a statistical assignment process. The first FDMA &quot;demand-assignment&quot; system for satellite was developed by COMSAT for use on the &quot;Intelsat&quot; series &quot;IVA&quot; and &quot;V&quot; satellites.

There are two main techniques:
*Multi-channel per-carrier (MCPC)
*Single-channel per-carrier (SCPC)

<text>Sonya Eleonora Smith Jacquet (, born April 23, 1972) is an American and Venezuelan actress best known for her roles in telenovelas.

== Biography ==
Smith was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, of Venezuelan actress Ileana Jacquet and Frederick Smith, who is American. Her maternal great-grandfather was French and her maternal great-grandmother was Finnish. After her parents divorced, her actress mother along with Smith went back to Venezuela; Smith grew up in Venezuela and identifies herself with the Venezuelan culture. She speaks fluent Spanish, English, and German; the last learned from her mother, a German who grew up in Venezuela. She studied psychology at the Universidad Central de Venezuela.

== Career ==
Her breakthrough came in the early 1990s when she played Estrellita Montenegro, the main character in &quot;Cara Sucia&quot;, her most successful telenovela as the lead actress. Smith remains a popular actress not only in Venezuela, also in other countries where her telenovelas have shown. In 2006, she returned to telenovelas with Olvidarte Jamás, her biggest hit as the lead actress since &quot;Cara Sucia&quot;, which was shot in Miami; this is the time where Smith returned to her birth country, but this time in Miami. Later, in 2007, she reappeared in &quot;Acorralada&quot;, in which she was one of the main stars and which has been a huge success. There, she was Fedora Gaviota.

During 2005, Smith made her Hollywood debut, playing Angela La Salle in &quot;Cyxork 7&quot;, where she acted alongside Ray Wise; although Smith currently lives in the United States and appeared in a Hollywood film, she still wants to remain more in the Spanish media of the country because the Spanish media opened opportunities for her to fame. In 2007, she participated in another Hollywood film, &quot;Ladrón que roba a Ladrón&quot;, where she shared credits with actors, Fernando Colunga, Gabriel Soto, Miguel Varoni, and Saúl Lisazo among others.

<doc id="201964" wikidata="Q719668" url="?curid=201964" title="Hasegawa Tōhaku">
<text>was a Japanese painter and founder of the Hasegawa school.

He is considered one of the great painters of the Azuchi–Momoyama period (1573-1603), and he is best known for his folding screens, such as &quot;Pine Trees&quot; and &quot;Pine Tree and Flowering Plants&quot; (both registered National Treasures), or the paintings in walls and sliding doors at Chishaku-in, attributed to him and his son (also National Treasures).

==Biography==
Hasegawa Tōhaku, born in 1539 in Nanao, a town in Noto Province (in the vicinity of present-day Ishikawa Prefecture) to a noted local family of cloth dyers, although evidence shows that Tōhaku&#x27;s original family name was Okumura and that he was adopted into the Hasegawa family.

Tōhaku started his artistic career as a painter of Buddhist paintings in his home province of Noto. His pictures include: Portrait of Takeda Shingen” (Seikei Temple of Mount Kōya), “Picture of Twelve Devas” (Ishikawa Shōkaku Temple) and “Portrait of Nawa Nagatoshi”.

By the age of 20, Tōhaku was a professional painter, and by his thirties had moved to Kyoto to study under the prestigious Kanō school, then headed by Kanō Shōei. The Kanō school was well known at the time for their large bold paintings that decorated the castle walls of many a wealthy warlord patron. These were often ink on white paper or gold-leaf decorative wall panels that served a dual purpose of reflecting light around the dim castle rooms as well as flaunting the castle owner&#x27;s abundant wealth to commission such extravagant pieces. Many of Tōhaku&#x27;s earlier works are in the style of the Kanō school, such as his &quot;Maple, Chishaku-in&quot; painted in 1593.

At the same time, he also studied the older Song, Yuan and Muromachi periods&#x27; styles of ink painting by examining scrolls from Mu Qi and Sesshū Tōyō, which he is believed to have gained access to in his time at the Daitoku-ji temple in Kyoto. After a period of time in Kyoto, Tōhaku developed his own style of which in many ways departed from the bold techniques indicative of the Kanō school, and called back to the minimalism of its predecessors. The works of Sesshū Tōyō in particular influenced Tōhaku&#x27;s redirection of artistic style as Tōhaku also studied under Sesshū&#x27;s successor, Toshun for some time. Tōhaku was in fact so much enamored with the techniques of Sesshū that he attempted to claim rights as his fifth successor, though he lost in a court battle to Unkoku Togan. Still, the influence of Sesshū is evident in many of Tōhaku&#x27;s mid to late works, such as his , which were declared a national treasure of Japan are argued to be the first paintings of their scale to depict only pine trees as subject matter.
The school founded by Hasegawa Tōhaku is known today as the Hasegawa school. This school was small; consisting mostly of Tōhaku and his sons. However, its members conserved Tōhaku&#x27;s quiet and reserved aesthetic, which many attribute to the influence of Sesshū as well as his contemporary and friend, Sen no Rikyū. It is suspected that these simple aesthetics protested the usage of intimidation and wealth rampant in the Kanō school.

Tōhaku&#x27;s most noted contemporary was Kanō Eitoku, who often competed with Tōhaku for the patronage of Toyotomi Hideyoshi. After Eitoku&#x27;s death in 1590, Tōhaku stood alone as the greatest living master of his time. He became the official painter for Hideyoshi, and produced some of his greatest and most elegant paintings under his patronage. He and his atelier produced the wall and screen paintings in Shoun-ji (temple), commissioned by Toyotomi Hideyoshi in 1593. The paintings were moved to Chishaku-in (temple), Kyoto and have survived. At the age of 67, Tōhaku was summoned to Edo and granted the priestly title of by the Tokugawa Ieyasu. There he stayed for the remainder of his life.
