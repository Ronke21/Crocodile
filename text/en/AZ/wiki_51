<text>The United States invaded Panama in mid-December 1989 during the presidency of George H. W. Bush. The purpose of the invasion was to depose the &quot;de facto&quot; ruler of Panama, General Manuel Noriega, who was wanted by U.S. authorities for racketeering and drug trafficking. The operation, codenamed Operation Just Cause, concluded in late January 1990 with the surrender of Noriega. The Panama Defense Forces (PDF) were dissolved, and President-elect Guillermo Endara was sworn into office.

Noriega, who had longstanding ties to United States intelligence agencies, consolidated power to become Panama&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; dictator in the early 1980s. In the mid-1980s, relations between Noriega and the U.S. began to deteriorate due to fallout of the murder of Hugo Spadafora and the removal from office of President Nicolas Ardito Barletta. His criminal activities and association with other spy agencies came to light, and in 1988 he was indicted by federal grand juries on several drug-related charges. Negotiations seeking his resignation, which began under the presidency of Ronald Reagan, were ultimately unsuccessful. In 1989, Noriega annulled the results of the Panamanian general elections, which appeared to have been won by opposition candidate Guillermo Endara; President Bush responded by reinforcing the U.S. garrison in the Canal Zone. After a U.S. Marine officer was shot dead at a PDF roadblock, Bush authorized the execution of the Panama invasion plan.

On December 20, the U.S. invasion of Panama began. Panamanian forces were rapidly overwhelmed, although operations continued for several weeks. Endara was sworn in as president shortly after the start of the invasion. Noriega eluded capture for several days before seeking refuge in the Holy See diplomatic mission in Panama City. He surrendered on January 3, 1990, and was then flown to the U.S., where he was tried, convicted and sentenced to 40 years in prison.

The Pentagon estimated that 516 Panamanians were killed during the invasion, including 314 soldiers and 202 civilians. A total of 23 U.S. soldiers and 3 U.S. civilians were killed. The United Nations General Assembly, the Organization of American States and the European Parliament condemned the invasion as a violation of international law. Meanwhile, the United States government cited a responsibility to protect American citizens residing in Panama, along with a need to enforce democracy and human rights, as rationale for the invasion.

== Background ==

In the late 20th century, the United States had maintained numerous military bases and a substantial garrison throughout the Canal Zone to protect and maintain American control of the strategically important Panama Canal. On September 7, 1977, U.S. President Jimmy Carter and the &quot;de facto&quot; leader of Panama, General Omar Torrijos, signed the Torrijos–Carter Treaties, which set in motion the process of handing over the canal to Panamanian control by 2000. Although the canal was destined for Panamanian administration, the military bases remained, and one condition of the transfer was that the canal would remain open to American shipping. The U.S. had long-standing relations with Torrijos&#x27; successor, General Manuel Noriega, who served as a U.S. intelligence asset because he was a paid informant for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) from 1967, including the period when George H. W. Bush was director of the agency (1976–77).

Noriega had sided with the U.S. rather than the Soviet Union in Central America, notably in sabotaging the forces of the Sandinista government in Nicaragua, and the revolutionaries of the Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front (FMLN) in El Salvador. Noriega received upward of $100,000 per year from the 1960s until the 1980s, when his salary was increased to $200,000 per year. Although he worked with the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to restrict illegal drug shipments, Noriega was known to simultaneously accept significant financial support from drug dealers and facilitate the laundering of drug money. These drug dealers received protection from DEA investigations due to Noriega&#x27;s special relationship with the CIA.

In the mid-1980s, relations between Noriega and the U.S. began to deteriorate. In 1986, U.S. President Ronald Reagan opened negotiations with Noriega, requesting that the Panamanian leader step down after his criminal activities were publicly exposed in &quot;The New York Times&quot; by Seymour Hersh. Reagan pressured Noriega with several drug-related indictments in U.S. courts; however, since extradition laws between Panama and the U.S. were weak, Noriega deemed this threat not credible and did not submit to Reagan&#x27;s demands. In 1988, Elliot Abrams and others in the Pentagon began pushing for a U.S. invasion. Reagan refused due to Bush&#x27;s ties to Noriega through his previous positions in the CIA and their potentially negative impact on Bush&#x27;s presidential campaign. Later negotiations involved dropping the drug-related indictments.

In March 1988, Noriega&#x27;s forces resisted an attempted &quot;coup d&#x27;etat&quot; against his regime. As relations continued to deteriorate, Noriega appeared to shift his Cold War allegiance toward the Soviet bloc, soliciting and receiving military aid from Cuba, Nicaragua, and Libya. U.S. military planners began preparing contingency plans to invade Panama.

In September 1988, Panamanian authorities reported that they had arrested 16 people on suspicion of plotting another coup d&#x27;état. Twelve of the conspirators were alleged to be part of the &quot;National Patriotic Committee&quot;, a U.S.-supported guerrilla group that sought to oust Noriega. Panamanian newspaper &quot;Critica&quot; claimed that the plot had been financed by the United States.

In May 1989, during the Panamanian national elections, an alliance of parties opposed to the Noriega regime counted results from the country&#x27;s election precincts, before they were sent to the district centers. Their tally showed their candidate, Guillermo Endara, defeating Carlos Duque, candidate of a pro-Noriega coalition, by nearly 3–1. Endara was physically assaulted by Noriega supporters the next day in his motorcade. Noriega declared the election null and maintained power by force, making him unpopular among Panamanians. Noriega&#x27;s regime insisted that it had won the presidential election and that irregularities had been on the part of U.S.-backed candidates from opposition parties. President Bush called on Noriega to honor the will of the Panamanian people while the U.S. reinforced its Canal Zone garrison, and increased the tempo of training and other activities intended to put pressure on Noriega.

In October 1989, Noriega foiled another coup attempt by members of the Panama Defense Forces (PDF), led by Major Moisés Giroldi. On December 15, the Panamanian general assembly passed a resolution declaring that a state of war existed between Panama and the United States.

On the night following the war declaration, at approximately 9:00 p.m., four U.S. military personnel were stopped at a roadblock outside PDF headquarters in the El Chorrillo neighborhood of Panama City. Marine Captain Richard E. Hadded, Navy Lieutenant Michael J. Wilson, Army Captain Barry L. Rainwater, and Marine First Lieutenant Robert Paz had left the U.S. base at Fort Clayton and were on their way to have dinner at the Marriott Caesar Park Hotel in downtown Panama City. The Pentagon reported that the servicemen had been unarmed, were in a private vehicle and attempted to flee only after their vehicle was surrounded by an angry crowd of civilians and PDF troops. The PDF asserted later that the Americans were armed and on a reconnaissance mission. The PDF opened fire and Paz was fatally wounded by a round that entered the rear of the vehicle and struck him in the back. Hadded, the driver of the vehicle, was also wounded in the foot. Paz was rushed to Gorgas Army Hospital but died of his wounds; he received the Purple Heart posthumously.

According to U.S. military sources, a U.S. Naval officer, SEAL Lieutenant Adam Curtis, and his wife, Bonnie, witnessed the incident and were detained by PDF troops. While in police custody, Curtis was beaten, and his wife threatened with sexual assault. Curtis spent two weeks in the hospital recovering from the beating. On December 16 Bush ordered the execution of the Panama invasion plan; the military set H-Hour as 0100 on December 20.

==International mediation==
Several neighboring governments secretly tried to negotiate a peaceful outcome and Noriega&#x27;s willing resignation. Presidents Oscar Arias and Daniel Oduber of Costa Rica, Carlos Andrés Pérez of Venezuela, Alfonso López Michelsen of Colombia, and Spanish Prime Minister Felipe González all on different occasions met Noriega in secret attempting to convince him to give up power and self-exile himself in Spain, to no avail.

== U.S. rationale ==
The official U.S. rationale for the invasion was articulated by President Bush on the morning of December 20, 1989, a few hours after the start of the operation. Bush cited Panama&#x27;s declaration of a state of war with the United States and attacks on U.S. troops as justification for the invasion.

Bush further identified four objectives of the invasion:

* Safeguarding the lives of U.S. citizens in Panama. In his statement, Bush stated that Noriega had declared that a state of war existed between the U.S. and Panama and had threatened the lives of the approximately 35,000 U.S. citizens living there. There had been numerous clashes between U.S. and Panamanian forces; one U.S. Marine had been killed a few days earlier.
* Defending democracy and human rights in Panama.
* Combating drug trafficking. Panama had become a center for drug money laundering and a transit point for drug trafficking to the U.S. and Europe.
* Protecting the integrity of the Torrijos–Carter Treaties. Members of Congress and others in the U.S. political establishment claimed that Noriega threatened the neutrality of the Panama Canal, and that the U.S. had the right under the treaties to intervene militarily to protect the canal.

U.S. forces were instructed to begin maneuvers and activities within the restrictions of the Torrijos-Carter Treaties, such as ignoring PDF roadblocks and conducting short-notice &quot;Category Three&quot; military exercises on security-sensitive targets, with the express goal of provoking PDF soldiers. U.S. SOUTHCOM kept a list of abuses against U.S. servicemen and civilians by the PDF while the orders to incite PDF soldiers were in place.

As for the Panamanian legislature&#x27;s war declaration, Noriega insisted in his memoirs that this declaration referred to a state of war directed by the U.S. against Panama, in the form of what he claimed were harsh economic sanctions and provocative military maneuvers (Operations Purple Storm and Sand Flea) that were prohibited by the Torrijos-Carter Treaties.

Bush&#x27;s four reasons for the invasion provided sufficient justification to establish bipartisan Congressional approval and support. However, the secrecy before the invasion&#x27;s initiation, the speed and success of the invasion itself, and U.S. public support for it (80% public approval) did not allow Democratic lawmakers to object to Bush&#x27;s decision to use military force. One contemporary study suggests that Bush decided to invade for domestic political reasons, citing scarce strategic reasoning for the U.S. to invade and immediately withdraw without establishing the structure to enforce the interests that Bush used to justify the invasion.

The U.S. invasion of Panama began on December 20, 1989, at 12:46 a.m. local time. The operation involved 27,684 U.S. troops and over 300 aircraft, including C-130 Hercules tactical transports flown by the 317th Tactical Airlift Wing (which was equipped with the Adverse Weather Aerial Delivery System or AWADS) and 314th Tactical Airlift Wing, AC-130 Spectre gunships, OA-37B Dragonfly observation and attack aircraft, C-141 Starlifter and C-5 Galaxy strategic transports, F-117A Nighthawk stealth ground-attack aircraft flown by the 37th Tactical Fighter Wing, and AH-64 Apache attack helicopters. The invasion was the first combat deployment for the AH-64, the HMMWV, and the F-117A. Panamanian radar units were jammed by two EF-111As electronic warfare aircraft of the 390th ECS, 366th TFW. These aircraft were deployed against the 16,000 members of the PDF.

The operation began with an assault of strategic installations, such as the civilian Punta Paitilla Airport in Panama City and a PDF garrison and airfield at Rio Hato, where Noriega also maintained a residence. Navy SEALs destroyed Noriega&#x27;s private jet and sunk a Panamanian gunboat. A Panamanian ambush killed four SEALs and wounded nine. Other military command centers throughout the country were also attacked. C Company 1st Battalion (Airborne) 508th PIR was assigned the task of securing &quot;La Comandancia&quot;, the central headquarters of the PDF. This attack touched off several fires, one of which destroyed most of the adjoining and heavily populated El Chorrillo neighborhood in Panama City. During the firefight at &quot;La Comandancia&quot;, the PDF downed two special operations helicopters and forced one MH-6 Little Bird helicopter to crash-land in the Panama Canal. The opening round of attacks in Panama City also included a special operations raid on the Carcel Modelo prison (known as Operation Acid Gambit) to free Kurt Muse, a U.S. citizen convicted of espionage by Noriega.

Fort Amador was secured by elements of the 1st Battalion (Airborne), 508th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 5th Infantry Division [Scouts] and 59th Engineer Company (sappers) in a nighttime air assault which secured the fort in the early hours of December 20. Fort Amador was a key position because of its relationship to the large oil farms adjacent to the canal, the Bridge of the Americas over the canal, and the Pacific entrance to the canal. Key command and control elements of the PDF were stationed there. Furthermore, Fort Amador had a large U.S. housing district that needed to be secured to prevent the PDF from taking U.S. citizens as hostages. This position also protected the left flank of the attack on &quot;La Comandancia&quot; and the securing of the El Chorrillos neighborhood, guarded by Noriega&#x27;s Dignity Battalions. Military police units from Fort Bragg, North Carolina, deployed via strategic airlift into Howard Air Force Base the next morning and secured key government buildings in Panama City. MPs seized PDF weapons, vehicles and supplies during house-to-house searches in the following days and conducted urban combat operations against snipers and Dignity Battalion holdouts for the following week.

A few hours after the invasion began, Guillermo Endara, who had been the presumed winner of the scheduled presidential election earlier in 1989, was sworn in at Fort Clayton.

A platoon from the 1138th Military Police Company, Missouri Army National Guard, which was on a routine two-week rotation to Panama, was called upon to set up a detainee camp on Empire Range to handle the mass of civilian and military detainees. This was the first National Guard unit called into active service since the Vietnam War.

=== Capture of Noriega ===

Operation Nifty Package was an operation launched by Navy SEALs to prevent Noriega&#x27;s escape. They sank his boat and destroyed his jet, at a cost of four killed and nine wounded. Military operations continued for several weeks, mainly against PDF units. Noriega remained at large for several days, but realizing he had few options in the face of a massive manhunt and a $1 million reward for his capture, he obtained refuge in the Apostolic Nunciature of the diplomatic mission of the Holy See in Panama City. However, the U.S. military&#x27;s psychological warfare pressure on Noriega was relentless, reportedly with the playing of loud rock-and-roll music day and night in the densely populated area surrounding the Holy See mission. A report of the Office of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff claimed that the music was used principally to prevent parabolic microphones from being used to eavesdrop on negotiations and not as a psychological weapon based around Noriega&#x27;s supposed loathing of rock music. Noriega finally surrendered to U.S. forces on January 3, 1990. He was immediately put on an MC-130E Combat Talon I aircraft and flown to the United States.

=== Casualties ===
According to official Pentagon figures, 516 Panamanians were killed during the invasion, including 314 soldiers and 202 civilians; however, an internal U.S. Army memo estimated the number at 1,000. The United Nations estimated 500 civilian deaths, whereas Americas Watch estimated 300 civilian deaths. President Guillermo Endara said that &quot;less than 600 Panamanians&quot; died during the entire invasion. Former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark estimated 3,000 civilian deaths. The Roman Catholic Church estimated that 673 Panamanians were killed in total. Physicians for Human Rights said it had received &quot;reliable reports of more than 100 civilian deaths&quot; that were not included in the U.S. military estimate but also that there was no evidence of several thousand civilian deaths. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, figures estimating thousands of civilian casualties were widely rejected in Panama.

Human Rights Watch&#x27;s 1991 report stated that even with these uncertainties, the figures on civilian casualties are &quot;still troublesome&quot; because: 
With respect to the United States forces, our report concluded that the tactics and weapons utilized resulted in an inordinate number of civilian victims, in violation of specific obligations under the Geneva Conventions. [...][Panama&#x27;s civilian deaths] reveal that the &quot;surgical operation&quot; by American forces inflicted a toll in civilian lives that was at least four-and-a-half times higher than military casualties in the enemy, and twelve or thirteen times higher than the casualties suffered by U.S. troops. By themselves, these ratios suggest that the rule of proportionality and the duty to minimize harm to civilians, where doing so would not compromise a legitimate military objective, were not faithfully observed by the invading U.S. forces. For us, the controversy over the number of civilian casualties should not obscure the important debate on the manner in which those people died. 

U.S. military casualties in the invasion were 23 killed and 325 wounded. In June 1990, the U.S. military announced that of its casualties, 2 dead and 19 wounded were victims of friendly fire. The number of Panamanian military dead was estimated at 314 by SOUTHCOM.

Civilian fatalities included Kandi Helin and Ray Dragseth, two American schoolteachers working in Panama for the Department of Defense Schools. The adult son of another teacher, Rick Paul, was also killed by friendly fire as he ran towards an American roadblock. Juan Antonio Rodriguez Moreno, a Spanish freelance press photographer on assignment for &quot;El País&quot;, was killed outside of the Marriott Caesar Park Hotel in Panama City early on December 21. In June 1990, his family filed a claim for wrongful death against the U.S. government. When the claim was rejected by the U.S. government in 1992, the Spanish government sent a Note Verbale extending diplomatic protection to Rodriguez and demanding compensation on behalf of his family. The U.S. government again rejected the claim, disputing both its liability for warzone deaths in general and whether Rodriguez had been killed by U.S. rather than Panamanian gunfire.

=== Women&#x27;s roles ===
Operation Just Cause involved the unprecedented use of U.S. military women during an invasion. Approximately 600 of the 26,000 members of the U.S. forces involved in the invasion were women. Women did not serve in direct combat roles or combat arms units, but did serve as military police, truck drivers, helicopter pilots, and in other logistical roles. Captain Linda L. Bray, commander of the 988th Military Police Company of Fort Benning, Georgia, led her troops in a three-hour firefight against PDF troops who refused to surrender a dog kennel which (it was later discovered) they were using to store weapons. Bray was said to be the first woman to lead U.S. troops in battle, and her role in the firefight led to controversy in the media and in Congress over women&#x27;s roles in the U.S. military. Bray requested and received a discharge in 1991.

First Lieutenant Lisa Kutschera and Warrant Officer Debra Mann piloted UH-60 &quot;Blackhawk&quot; helicopters ferrying infantry troops. Their helicopters came under fire during the invasion, and like their male counterparts, both women were awarded Air Medals for their roles during the invasion.

The traditional role of women in wars had also seen a transformation during the invasion. Besides being combat medics and logisticians, many women took on support roles and provided crucial support that facilitated the operational objectives. This included roles in transportation, supply chain management, and intelligence. Outside of the battlefield, female journalists and reporters expansively covered the invasion, providing critical information to the public and bringing international attention to the events unfolding in Panama. These perspectives and the subsequent public discussion eventually led to the shaping of the public perception of the U.S. military action.

=== Origin of the name &quot;Operation Just Cause&quot; ===
Operation plans directed against Panama had evolved from plans designed to defend the Panama Canal. They became more aggressive as the situation between the two nations deteriorated. The &quot;Prayer Book&quot; series of plans included rehearsals for a possible clash (Operation Purple Storm) and missions to secure U.S. sites (Operation Bushmaster). The original operation, in which U.S. troops were deployed to Panama in early 1989, was called Operation Nimrod Dancer.

Eventually these plans became Operation Blue Spoon, renamed Operation Just Cause by the Pentagon to sustain the perceived legitimacy of the invasion. General Colin Powell said that he liked the name because &quot;even our severest critics would have to utter &#x27;Just Cause&#x27; while denouncing us.&quot; Critics, however, renamed it Operation &quot;Just &#x27;Cuz&quot;, arguing that it had been undertaken &quot;just [be]cause Bush felt like it.&quot;

The post-invasion civil-military operation designed to stabilize the situation, support the U.S.-installed government, and restore basic services was originally planned as Operation Blind Logic, but was renamed &quot;Operation Promote Liberty&quot; by the Pentagon on the eve of the invasion.

== Legality ==
The U.S. government invoked self-defense as a legal justification for the invasion. Several scholars and observers have opined that the invasion was illegal under international law, arguing that the government&#x27;s justifications were, according to these sources, factually groundless, and moreover, even if they had been true they would have provided inadequate support for the invasion under international law. Article 2 of the United Nations Charter, a cornerstone of international law, prohibits the use of force by member states to settle disputes except in self-defense or when authorized by the United Nations Security Council. Articles 18 and 20 of the Charter of the Organization of American States, written in part in reaction to the history of U.S. military interventions in Central America, also explicitly prohibit the use of force by member states: &quot;[n]o state or group of states has the right to intervene, directly or indirectly, for any reason whatever, in the internal affairs of any other state&quot;. The OAS charter further states that &quot;the territory of a states is inviolable; it may not be the object, even temporarily, of military occupation or of other measures of force taken by another state, directly or indirectly, on any grounds whatever.&quot; Other international law experts who have examined the legal justification of the invasion have concluded that it was a &quot;gross violation&quot; of international law.

The United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution which determined that the U.S. invasion was a &quot;flagrant violation of international law.&quot; A similar resolution proposed by the United Nations Security Council was supported by the majority of its member nations but vetoed by the U.S., the United Kingdom and France.

Independent experts and observers have also concluded that the invasion also exceeded the authority of the president under the United States Constitution. Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution grants the power to declare war solely to the Congress, not to the president. The Bush administration argued that the military intervention was constitutional because the Panamanian national assembly had declared a state of war with the United States. This argument is supported by the Federal Convention, where James Madison moved to insert &quot;declare&quot; instead of &quot;make&quot; in &quot;make war&quot;, leaving to the executive the power to repel sudden attacks. According to observers, the invasion also violated the War Powers Resolution – a federal law designed to limit presidential action without Congressional authorization – because the president failed to consult with Congress regarding the invasion prior to its execution.

== Local and international reactions ==
The invasion provoked international outrage. Some countries charged that the U.S. had committed an act of aggression by invading Panama and was trying to conceal a new manifestation of its interventionist policy of force in Central America. On December 29, the United Nations General Assembly voted 75–20, with 40 abstentions, to condemn the invasion as a flagrant violation of international law.

On December 22, the Organization of American States (OAS) passed a resolution denouncing the invasion and calling for withdrawal of U.S. troops, as well as a resolution condemning the violation of the diplomatic status of the Nicaraguan embassy in Panama by U.S. Special Forces who had entered the building. At the United Nations Security Council, seven nations initiated a draft resolution demanding the immediate withdrawal of U.S. forces from Panama. It was vetoed on December 23 by the U.S., the United Kingdom and France, which cited its right of self-defense of 35,000 Americans present on the Panama Canal.

Peru recalled its ambassador from the U.S. in protest of the invasion.

In Romania, President Nicolae Ceaușescu, who was being overthrown in a violent revolution, criticized the invasion as &quot;brutal aggression&quot;.

Polls show that the Panamanian people overwhelmingly supported the invasion. According to a CBS News poll, 92% of Panamanian adults supported the invasion, and 76% wished that U.S. forces had invaded in October during the second attempted coup. The poll was conducted in 158 randomly selected areas of the country covering about 75 percent of Panama&#x27;s adult population. CBS News said the margin of sampling error was plus or minus four percentage points. Human Rights Watch described the reaction of the civilian population to the invasion as &quot;generally sympathetic&quot;. According to Robert Pastor, a former U.S. national security advisor, 74% of Americans polled approved of the action.

Eighteen years after the invasion, Panama&#x27;s National Assembly unanimously declared December 20, 2007, to be a day of national mourning. The resolution was vetoed by President Martin Torrijos. On December 19, 2019, the Panamanian government declared December 20 to be a National Day of Mourning (&quot;Dia de duelo nacional&quot;), to be marked by lowering the national flag to half-staff.

&quot;The Washington Post&quot; disclosed several rulings of the Office of Legal Counsel, issued shortly before the invasion, regarding the U.S. forces being charged with making an arrest abroad. One ruling interpreted an executive order which prohibits the assassination of foreign leaders as suggesting that accidental killings would be acceptable foreign policy. Another ruling concluded that the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878, which prohibits the armed forces from making arrests without Congressional authorization, is effective only within the boundaries of the U.S., such that the military could be used as a police force abroad—for example, in Panama, to enforce a federal court warrant against Noriega.

== Aftermath ==
Guillermo Endara, in hiding, was sworn in as president by a judge on the night preceding the invasion. In later years, he staged a hunger strike, calling attention to the poverty and homelessness left in the wake of both the Noriega years and the destruction caused by the U.S. invasion.

On July 19, 1990, a group of sixty companies with operations in Panama filed a lawsuit against the U.S. government in Federal District Court in New York City, alleging that the invasion was &quot;done in a tortuous, careless and negligent manner with disregard for the property of innocent Panamanian residents&quot;. Most of the businesses had insurance, but the insurers either went bankrupt or refused to pay, claiming that acts of war were not covered.

About 20,000 people lost their homes and became refugees as a result of urban warfare. About 2,700 families displaced by the El Chorrillo fire were given $6,500 each by the U.S. to build a new house or apartment in selected areas in or near Panama City. However, numerous problems were reported with the new constructions just two years after the invasion.

Endara&#x27;s government designated the first anniversary of the invasion a &quot;national day of reflection&quot;. Hundreds of Panamanians marked the day with a &quot;black march&quot; through the streets of Panama City to denounce the invasion and Endara&#x27;s economic policies. Protesters echoed claims that 3,000 people were killed as a result of U.S. military action. Since Noriega&#x27;s ousting, Panama has had four presidential elections, with candidates from opposing parties succeeding each other in the Palacio de las Garzas. Panama&#x27;s press, however, is still subject to numerous restrictions. On February 10, 1990, the Endara government abolished the PDF and reformed the security apparatus by creating the Panamanian Public Forces (PPF). In 1994, a constitutional amendment permanently abolished the military of Panama. Concurrent with a severe recession in Central America throughout the 1990s, Panama&#x27;s GDP recovered by 1993, but very high unemployment remained a serious problem.

Noriega was brought to the U.S. to stand trial. He was subsequently convicted on eight counts of drug trafficking, racketeering, and money laundering and sentenced to 40 years in prison. His sentence was later reduced to 30 years. He died in Panama City on May 29, 2017, at the age of 83.

On December 20, 2015, Vice President Isabel De Saint Malo de Alvarado announced Panama&#x27;s intention to form a special independent commission that would publish a report to mark the 26th anniversary of the invasion. The commission&#x27;s goal would be to identify victims so that reparations could be paid to their families, as well as to establish public monuments and school curriculums to honor history and reclaim Panama&#x27;s collective memory. Victims&#x27; families have claimed that past investigations into the invasion had been funded by U.S. authorities and therefore were biased.

<text>Walter Jon Williams (born October 28, 1953) is an American writer, primarily of science fiction. Previously he wrote nautical adventure fiction under the name Jon Williams, in particular, &quot;Privateers and Gentlemen&quot; (1981–1984), a series of historical novels set during the Age of Sail.

==Career==
Writing as Jon Williams, he designed the wargame &quot;Tradition of Victory&quot; and role-playing game &quot;Promotions and Prizes&quot;, which were republished by Fantasy Games Unlimited as &quot;Heart of Oak&quot; (1982) and &quot;Privateers and Gentlemen&quot; (1983). A role-playing game sourcebook for &quot;Cyberpunk&quot; called &quot;&quot; (1989) was licensed by R. Talsorian Games, based on the 1986 novel of the same name by Williams.

Williams was born in Duluth, Minnesota and graduated from the University of New Mexico, where he received his BA degree in 1975. He currently lives in Valencia County, New Mexico, south of Albuquerque about 22 miles.

In 2006, Williams founded the Taos Toolbox, a two-week writer&#x27;s workshop for fantasy and science fiction writers.

In 2017, Williams was the Guest of Honor at the 75th World Science Fiction Convention, held in Helsinki.

<doc id="205558" wikidata="Q189623" url="?curid=205558" title="Zenithal hourly rate">
<text>In astronomy, the zenithal hourly rate (ZHR) of a meteor shower is the number of meteors a single observer would see in an hour of peak activity if the radiant was at the zenith, assuming the seeing conditions are perfect (when and where stars with apparent magnitudes up to 6.5 are visible to the naked eye). The rate that can effectively be seen is nearly always lower and decreases the closer the radiant is to the horizon.

== Calculation ==
The formula to calculate the ZHR is:

formula_1

where

formula_2

represents the hourly rate of the observer. N is the number of meteors observed, and Teff is the effective observation time of the observer.

Example: If the observer detected 12 meteors in 15 minutes, their hourly rate was 48 (12 divided by 0.25 hours).

formula_3

This represents the field of view correction factor, where k is the percentage of the observer&#x27;s field of view which is obstructed (by clouds, for example).

Example: If 20% of the observer&#x27;s field of view were covered by clouds, k would be 0.2 and F would be 1.25. The observer should have seen 25% more meteors, therefore multiply by F = 1.25.

formula_4

This represents the limiting magnitude correction factor (Population index). For every change of 1 magnitude in the limiting magnitude of the observer, the number of meteors observed changes by a factor of r. Therefore, this must be taken into account.

Example: If r is 2, and the observer&#x27;s limiting magnitude is 5.5, the hourly rate is multiplied by 2 (2 to the power 6.5–5.5), to know how many meteors they would have seen if their limiting magnitude was 6.5.

formula_5

This represents the correction factor for the altitude of the radiant above the horizon (hR). The number of meteors seen by an observer changes as the sine of the radiant height. 

Example: If the radiant was at an average altitude of 30° during the observation period, the observer&#x27;s hourly rate will need to be divided by 0.5 (sin 30°) to know how many meteors they would have seen if the radiant was at the zenith.

<text>Robert Persons (24 June 1546 – 15 April 1610), later known as Robert Parsons, was an English Jesuit priest. He was a major figure in establishing the 16th-century &quot;English Mission&quot; of the Society of Jesus.

==Early life==
Robert Persons was born at Nether Stowey, Somerset, to yeoman parents. Through the favour of local parson named John Hayward, a former monk, he was educated in 1562 at St. Mary&#x27;s Hall, Oxford. After completing his degrees with distinction, he became a fellow and tutor at Balliol in 1568.

==College fellow and priest==
As a Fellow of Balliol College, Persons clashed with the Master there, Adam Squire, and also the academic and Roman Catholic priest Christopher Bagshaw. On 13 February 1574, he was subsequently forced to resign. Through discussion and encouraged by pupillage with Father William Good, SJ, he travelled overseas to become a Jesuit priest at St Paul&#x27;s, Rome on 3 July 1575.

==English mission: 1580–1581==
Persons accompanied Edmund Campion on his mission to fellow English Catholics in 1580. The Jesuit General, Everard Mercurian, had been reluctant to involve the Society directly in English ecumenical affairs. He was persuaded by an Italian Jesuit provincial, and later by Superior General Claudio Acquaviva, after William Cardinal Allen had found Mercurian resistant to change in October 1579. Persons fast tracked English recruits to the Jesuits, and planned to set up cooperation with the remaining English secular clergy. He became impatient with Father Good&#x27;s approach to the situation. Campion was much less of an enthusiast than he was.

The mission was immediately compromised as the pope had sent a separate group to the Jesuit mission, to support the Irish rebel, James FitzMaurice FitzGerald. Persons and Campion only learned of this event in Reims while they were en route to England. After the initial invasion force under the mercenary Thomas Stukley had achieved nothing successful in 1578, the intervention under FitzGerald caused the English authorities to monitor the recusants closely, and try to finance the campaign against the papal forces with exactions from them. Campion and Persons crossed separately into England.

In June 1580 Thomas Pounde, then in the Marshalsea Prison, went to speak to Persons. This action then resulted in a petition from Pounde to the Privy Council to allow a disputation where the Jesuits would take on Robert Crowley and Henry Tripp, who used to preach to the Marshalsea inmates. Campion and Persons also prepared their own personal statements, to be kept in reserve. The immediate consequence was that Pounde was then transferred to Bishop&#x27;s Stortford Castle; but the prepared statement by Campion was later circulated soon after his capture.

Much of the time Persons spent in England was taken up with covert printing, and pamphleteering. He made his negative view on church papism clear to the local Catholic clergy, before a synod in Southwark. The secret printing press needed to be relocated, moving it in early 1581 to Stonor Park. Campion was captured in July of that year; and then Stephen Brinkley, who ran the printing press, was taken captive in August. Quite soon after that date Persons left for France. His underlying strategy of trying to embarrass the English government by demanding a forum for his ideals was consistent with the general approach of Allen and Persons, but met with much criticism from the Catholic members. Allen and Parsons persisted with their demand for another two years, but Jesuit opinion was against further confrontation. Campion was forced into disputation in the Tower of London under adverse conditions. When Persons left England, he was never to return.

==To the Armada==
Robert Persons spent the winter of 1581–82 at Rouen, and embarked on writing projects. He was in close contact with Henry I, Duke of Guise, and through the Duke founded a school for English boys at Eu, on the coast to the north-east. Father William Creighton, SJ, was on the way to Scotland. He arrived in January 1582 and was briefed by Persons and the duke. In April Creighton returned with word from Esmé Stewart, 1st Duke of Lennox; and they went to Paris to confer with William Allen, James Beaton and Claude Mathieu, Jesuit provincial in France, on his military plans and the imprisoned Mary, Queen of Scots. The scheme, which Persons supported confidently, advanced further, but was stopped after the raid of Ruthven of August 1582. One consequence was that Allen was made Cardinal, as Persons had recommended.

A new enterprise was projected for September 1583, this time through England. Persons was sent by the Duke of Guise with written instructions to Rome. He returned to Flanders, and stayed for some time at the court of the Duke of Parma. The discovery of the Throckmorton Plot disrupted the plan, and the Duke of Guise became absorbed in French domestic affairs. Philip II of Spain took over the lead, placed the Duke of Parma in charge, and limited involvement to Persons, Allen, and Hew Owen.

It was during this period that Persons was involved in the work later known as &quot;Leicester&#x27;s Commonwealth&quot;. Distributed covertly, it came to light in 1584. Persons is now generally thought not to be the author. The British historian John Bossy of the University of York was inclined to disagree.

There is a scholarly consensus that the intention was to affect French domestic politics, strengthening the Guise faction against Anglophiles. Correspondingly his own standing suffered in some quarters. Claudio Acquaviva by the end of the year was concerned that the Jesuit strategies for France and the English mission would turn out to be inconsistent in the longer term, and consulted Pope Gregory XIII on the matter. Persons as his subordinate had been told to drop plans to assassinate Elizabeth.

In September 1585, Persons and Allen went to Rome after Pope Sixtus V succeeded Pope Gregory XIII. Persons was still there when the Spanish Armada sailed in 1588. At this period Allen and Persons made a close study of the succession to Elizabeth I of England, working with noted genealogist Robert Heighinton. Persons took his vows of final profession in the Jesuits in Rome on 7 May 1587.

==Later life==
Robert Persons was sent to Spain at the close of 1588 to conciliate Philip II of Spain, who was offended with Claudio Acquaviva. Persons was successful, and then made use of the royal favour to found the seminaries of Valladolid, Seville, and Madrid (1589, 1592, 1598) and the residences of San Lucar and of Lisbon (which became a college in 1622). He then succeeded in establishing at St Omer (1594) a larger institution to which the boys from Eu were transferred. It is the institutional ancestor of Stonyhurst College.

In 1596, in Seville, he wrote &quot;Memorial for the Reformation of England&quot;, which gave in some detail a blueprint for the kind of society England was to become after its return to the faith. He had hoped to succeed Allen as Cardinal on the latter&#x27;s death. 

Persons was, in 1605, the year of the Gunpowder Plot, the leading Jesuit priest in England. As religious tensions escalated, and Edward Coke pressed to establish the supremacy of the common law over the ecclesiastical jurisdiction, Robert Persons published his polemical response &quot;An Answere to the Fifth Part of the Reports&quot;, disputing the historical accuracy of Coke&#x27;s claims about the common law in his report on &quot;Caudry&#x27;s Case&quot;, especially the claim that a Tudor era statute asserting the Supremacy of the Crown was based on pre-Conquest common law, pointing to a lack of evidence for authoritative statutes before the reign of Henry III.

He had hoped to succeed Allen as Cardinal on the latter&#x27;s death. Unsuccessful, he was rewarded with the rectorship of the English College in Rome, where he died at the age of 63. John Donne&#x27;s &quot;Pseudo Martyr&quot; (1610) engages critically with Persons&#x27; views.

==Works==
Robert Persons&#x27;s published works were:
* &quot;A brief discovrs contayning certayne reasons why Catholiques refuse to goe to Church . . . dedicated by I. H. to the queenes most excellent Maiestie. Doway, John Lyon&quot; [London], 1580. This work was published through a clandestine printing press in London, printed as a consequence of decisions at a synod at Southwark held not long after Frs. Persons and Campion landed. It was aimed at implementing a 1563 declaration of Pope Pius IV that Catholics should not mix with heretics.
* &quot;A Discouerie of I. Nicols, minister, misreported a Jesuite, latelye recanted in the Tower of London. Doway&quot; [London], 1580. Printed by Persons at Stonor Park, it concerned a renegade Catholic priest. In a poem which begins, &quot;Gwrandewch ddatcan, meddwl maith&quot; (&quot;Hear a song, a great thought,&quot;), St. Richard Gwyn, who was Canonized in 1970 as one of the Forty Martyrs of England and Wales, both summarized Fr. Persons&#x27; work and rendered it into a work of Welsh poetry in strict meter. All of the reasons given by Fr. Persons for Catholics to refuse to attend Anglican services were listed by St. Richard Gwyn in the poem, &quot;but of course only in brief poetic way.&quot;
* &quot;A briefe censure upon two bookes written in answer to M. Edmund Campians offer of disputation. Doway, John Lyon&quot; [really at Mr. Brooke&#x27;s house near London], 1581. Against William Charke and Meredith Hanmer, who had engaged in controversy with Campion.

Afterwards much enlarged, under the title of &quot;A Christian Directorie, guiding men to their saluation, devided into three books, anno 1585&quot;, and often reprinted (40 editions by 1640). This was a major devotional work in English, and was soon adapted by Edmund Bunny to Protestant needs.

<text>A saltire, also called Saint Andrew&#x27;s Cross or the crux decussata, is a heraldic symbol in the form of a diagonal cross. The word comes from the Middle French , Medieval Latin (&quot;stirrup&quot;).

From its use as field sign, the saltire came to be used in a number of flags, in the 16th century for Scotland and Burgundy, in the 18th century also as the ensign of the Russian Navy, and for Ireland. Notable 19th-century usage includes some of the flags of the Confederate States of America. It is also used in the flag of Jamaica and on seals, and as a heraldic charge in coats of arms.

The term saltirewise or in saltire refers to heraldic charges arranged as a diagonal cross. The shield may also be divided per saltire, i.e. diagonally.

A warning sign in the shape of a saltire is also used to indicate the point at which a railway line intersects a road at a level crossing.

== Heraldry and vexillology ==
The saltire is important both in heraldry, being found in many coats of arms, and in vexillology, being found as the dominant feature of multiple flags.

The saltire is one of the so-called ordinaries, geometric charges that span throughout (from edge to edge of) the shield. As suggested by the name &quot;saltire&quot; (&quot;stirrup&quot;; in French: &quot;sautoir&quot;, in German: &quot;Schragen&quot;), the ordinary in its early use was not intended as representing a Christian cross symbol. The association with Saint Andrew is a development of the 15th to 16th centuries. The Cross of Burgundy emblem originates in the 15th century, as a field sign, and as the Saint Andrew&#x27;s Cross of Scotland was used in flags or banners (but not in coats of arms) from the 16th century, and used as naval ensign during the Age of Sail.

When two or more saltires appear, they are usually blazoned as couped (cut off). For example, contrast the single saltire in the arms granted to G. M. W. Anderson—with the three &quot;saltires couped&quot; in the coat of Kemble Greenwood.

Diminutive forms include the &quot;fillet saltire&quot;, usually considered half or less the width of the saltire, and the &quot;saltorel&quot;, a narrow or couped saltire.

A field &quot;(party) per saltire&quot; is divided into four areas by a saltire-shaped &quot;cut&quot;. If two tinctures are specified, the first refers to the areas above (in chief) and below (in base) the crossing, and the second refers to the ones on either side (in the flanks). Otherwise, each of the four divisions may be blazoned separately.

The phrase &quot;in saltire&quot; or &quot;saltirewise&quot; is used in two ways:
# Two long narrow charges &quot;in saltire&quot; are placed to cross each other diagonally. Common forms include the crossed keys found in the arms of many entities associated with Saint Peter and paired arrows.
# When five or more compact charges are &quot;in saltire&quot;, they are arranged with one in the center and the others along the arms of an invisible saltire.

Division of the field &quot;per saltire&quot; was notably used by the Aragonese kings of Sicily beginning in the 14th century (Frederick the Simple), showing the pales of Aragon and the &quot;Hohenstaufen&quot; eagle (argent an eagle sable).

=== Scotland ===

The Flag of Scotland, called &quot;The Saltire&quot; or &quot;Saint Andrew&#x27;s Cross&quot;, is a blue field with a white saltire. According to tradition, it represents Saint Andrew, who is supposed to have been crucified on a cross of that form (called a &quot;crux decussata&quot;) at Patras, Greece.

The Saint Andrew&#x27;s Cross was worn as a badge on hats in Scotland, on the day of the feast of Saint Andrew.

In the politics of Scotland, both the Scottish National Party and Scottish Conservative Party use stylised saltires as their party logos, deriving from the flag of Scotland. Furthermore, the Scottish Government uses the flag as its official symbol on Scottish Government publications, including letters, documents and press releases.

Prior to the Union, the Royal Scots Navy used a red ensign incorporating the St Andrew&#x27;s Cross; this ensign is now sometimes flown as part of an unofficial civil ensign in Scottish waters. With its colours exchanged (and a lighter blue), the same design forms part of the arms and flag of Nova Scotia (whose name means &quot;New Scotland&quot;).

=== Cross of Burgundy ===

The Cross of Burgundy, a form of the Saint Andrew&#x27;s Cross, is used in numerous flags across Europe and the Americas. It was first used in the 15th century as an emblem by the Valois Dukes of Burgundy. The Duchy of Burgundy, forming a large part of eastern France and the Low Countries, was inherited by the House of Habsburg on the extinction of the Valois ducal line. The emblem was therefore assumed by the monarchs of Spain as a consequence of the Habsburgs bringing together, in the early 16th century, their Burgundian inheritance with the other extensive possessions they inherited throughout Europe and the Americas, including the crowns of Castile and Aragon. As a result, the Cross of Burgundy has appeared in a wide variety of flags connected with territories formerly part of the Burgundian or Habsburg inheritance. Examples of such diversity include the Spanish naval ensign (1506-1701), the flag of Carlism (a nineteenth century Spanish conservative movement), the flag of the Dutch municipality of Eijsden, the flag of Chuquisaca in Bolivia and the flags of Florida and Alabama in the United States.

=== Gascony ===

Gascony has not had any institutional unity since the 11th century, hence several flags are currently used in the territory. Legend says that this flag appeared in the time of Pope Clement III to gather the Gascons during the Third Crusade (12th century). That flag, sometimes called &quot;Union Gascona&quot; (Gascon Union), contains the St Andrew&#x27;s cross, the patron saint of Bordeaux and the red color of English kingdom, which reigned over Gascony from 12th to mid-15th century.
In Tome 14 of the Grande Encyclopédie, published in France between 1886 and 1902 by Henri Lamirault, it says 
That saltire is also represented in the pattern of some in many bullrings in Gascony.

=== Maritime flags ===

The naval ensign of the Imperial Russian (1696–1917) and Russian navies (1991–present) is a blue saltire on a white field.

The international maritime signal flag for &quot;M&quot; is a white saltire on a blue background, and indicates a stopped vessel. A red saltire on a white background denotes the letter &quot;V&quot; and the message &quot;I require assistance&quot;.

=== Others ===
The flags of the Colombian archipelago of San Andrés and Providencia and the Spanish island of Tenerife also use a white saltire on a blue field. The Brazilian cities of Rio de Janeiro and Fortaleza also use a blue saltire on a white field, with their coats-of-arms at the hub.

Saltires are also seen in several other flags, including the flags of Grenada, Jamaica, Alabama, Florida, Jersey, Logroño, Vitoria, Amsterdam, Breda, Katwijk, Potchefstroom, The Bierzo and Valdivia, as well as the former Indian princely states of Khairpur, Rajkot and Jaora.

The design is also part of the Confederate Battle Flag and Naval Jack used during the American Civil War (see Flags of the Confederate States of America). Arthur L. Rogers, designer of the final version of the Confederate National flag, claimed that it was based on the saltire of Scotland. The saltire is used on modern-day Southern U.S. state flags to honour the former Confederacy.

== Christian symbol ==
Anne Roes (1937) identifies a design consisting of two crossing diagonal lines in a rectangle, sometimes with four dots or balls in the four quarters, as an emblem or &quot;vexillum&quot; (standard) of Persepolis during the 3rd to 2nd centuries BC. Roes also finds the design in Argive vase painting, and still earlier in button seals of the Iranian Chalcolithic. Roes also notes the occurrence of a very similar if not identical &quot;vexillum&quot; which repeatedly occurs in Gaulish coins of c. the 2nd to 1st century BC, in a recurring design where it is held by a charioteer in front of his human-headed horse. A large number of coins of this type (118 out of 152 items) forms part of the Les Sablons hoard of the 1st century BC, discovered in Le Mans between 1991 and 1997, associated with the Cenomani.
The same design is found on coins of Christian Roman emperors of the 4th to 5th centuries (Constantius II, Valentinian, Jovian, Gratianus, Valens, Arcadius, Constantine III, Jovinus, Theodosius I, Eugenius and Theodosius II). The letter Χ (Chi) was from an early time used as a symbol for Christ (unrelated to the Christian cross symbol, which at the time was given a T-shape). The &quot;vexillum&quot; on imperial coins from the 4th century was sometimes shown as the Labarum, surmounted by or displaying the Chi-Rho monogram rather than just the &quot;crux decussata&quot;. The emblem of the &quot;crux decussata&quot; in a rectangle, sometimes with four dots or balls, re-appears in coins the Byzantine Empire, in the 9th to 10th centuries. Roes suggested that early Christians endorsed its solar symbolism as appropriate to Christ.
The association with Saint Andrew develops in the late medieval period. The tradition according to which this saint was crucified on a decussate cross is not found in early hagiography. Depictions of Saint Andrew being crucified in this manner first appear in the 10th century, but do not become standard before the 17th century. Reference to the saltire as &quot;St Andrew&#x27;s Cross&quot; is made by the Parliament of Scotland (where Andrew had been adopted as patron saint) in 1385, in a decree to the effect that every Scottish and French soldier (fighting against the English under Richard II) &quot;shall have a sign before and behind, namely a white St. Andrew&#x27;s Cross&quot;.

The cross continues to be used in modern times by religious groups. The arms of the Episcopal Church in the United States features a saltire in its canton. The logo of the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) features a red chalice with a Saint Andrew&#x27;s cross, representing the Scottish heritage of the denomination.

== Other ==
The diagonal cross (decussate cross) or X mark is called &quot;saltire&quot; in heraldic and vexillological contexts.

A black diagonal cross was used in an old European Union standard as the hazard symbol for irritants (Xi) or harmful chemicals (Xn). It indicated a hazard less severe than skull and crossbones, used for poisons, or the corrosive sign.

The Maria Theresa thaler has a Roman numeral ten to symbolize the 1750 debasement of the coinage, from 9 to 10 thalers to the Vienna mark (a weight of silver).

A diagonal cross known as &quot;crossbuck&quot; is used as the conventional road sign used to indicate the point at which a railway line intersects a road at a level crossing. A white diagonal cross on a blue background (or black on yellow for temporary signs) is displayed in UK railway signalling as a &quot;cancelling indicator&quot; for the Automatic Warning System (AWS), informing the driver that the received warning can be disregarded.

In Cameroon, a red &quot;X&quot; placed on illegally constructed buildings scheduled for demolition is occasionally referred to as a &quot;St Andrew&#x27;s Cross&quot;. It is usually accompanied by the letters &quot;A.D.&quot; (&quot;à détruire&quot;—French for &quot;to be demolished&quot;) and a date or deadline. During a campaign of urban renewal by the Yaoundé Urban Council in Cameroon, the cross was popularly referred to as &quot;Tsimi&#x27;s Cross&quot; after the Government Delegate to the council, Gilbert Tsimi Evouna.

In traditional timber framing a pair of crossing braces is sometimes called a saltire or a St. Andrew&#x27;s Cross. Half-timbering, particularly in France and Germany, has patterns of framing members forming many different symbols known as ornamental bracing.

The saltire cross, X-cross, X-frame, or Saint Andrew&#x27;s cross is a common piece of equipment in BDSM dungeons. It is erotic furniture that typically provides restraining points for ankles, wrists, and waist. When secured to an X-cross, the subject is restrained in a standing spreadeagle position.

<doc id="205563" wikidata="Q2399305" url="?curid=205563" title="Nether Stowey">
<text>Nether Stowey is a large village in Somerset, South West England. It sits in the foothills of the Quantock Hills (England&#x27;s first Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty), just below Over Stowey. The parish of Nether Stowey covers approximately 4 km2, with a population of 1,482 (2021 census).
==History==
The Iron Age fort of Dowsborough lies about one and a half miles west of the village.

In the Domesday Book of 1086 it was recorded as &quot;Stawei&quot;, the name coming from the Old English &quot;stan&quot; &quot;weg&quot;, or paved road.

The parish of Nether Stowey was part of the Williton and Freemanners Hundred.

Nether Stowey may have been a borough as early as 1157 or 1158 but by 1225 it is officially recorded as such. The economy of the medieval town was based on textiles and pottery, and it had both a weekly market and a yearly fair after 1304.

During the &quot;Bloody Assizes&quot; in the autumn of 1685, in the aftermath of Duke of Monmouth&#x27;s Rebellion, men from Nether Stowey who were caught up in the rebellion are said to have been hanged, drawn and quartered in the village after they were sentenced to death by Judge Jeffries. Their body parts were then displayed around the village to discourage others from rebellion against the King. Many villages throughout the South West were witness to the same bloody retribution.

==Governance==
The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council’s operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council&#x27;s role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council.

For local government purposes, since 1 April 2023, the village comes under the unitary authority of Somerset Council. Prior to this, it was part of the non-metropolitan district of Sedgemoor, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, having previously been part of Bridgwater Rural District. 

The village is part of the &#x27;Quantocks&#x27; electoral ward. The ward stretches from &quot;Nether Stowey&quot; north east to Stockland Bristol and south east to Goathurst. The total ward population at the 2011 census was 4,471.

It is also part of the Bridgwater county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election.

==Notable buildings==
===Castle===

Stowey Castle is a Norman motte-and-bailey castle, built in the 11th century. The blue lias rubble walling is the only visible structural remains of the castle which stand on a conical earthwork with a ditch approximately in circumference. The castle was destroyed in the 15th century, which may have been as a penalty for the local Lord Audley&#x27;s involvement in the Second Cornish Uprising of 1497 led by Perkin Warbeck.

The castle is a scheduled monument and the foundations of the keep are a Grade I listed building.

===Church===
The Church of St Mary the Virgin has a 15th-century tower, with the remainder of the church being rebuilt in 1851 by Richard Carver and Charles Edmund Giles. It has been designated as a Grade II* listed building.

===Stowey Court===

Stowey Court may contain part of Lord Audley&#x27;s original house which was left unfinished after his execution in 1497 until his descendants rebuilt the half-finished dwelling. Most of the current building is 19th and 20th-century. In 2008 the British Museum exhibited a hoard of silverware that was found near Stowey Court. The spoons, a goblet and a bell shaped salt cellars are thought to date from the time of the English Civil War and they were recently discovered in a broken earthenware jar using a metal detector.

Stowey Court is a Grade II listed building.

===Coleridge Cottage===
Coleridge Cottage was, between 1797 and 1799, the home of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, one of the founders of the Romantic Movement in poetry (along with William Wordsworth, who himself lived three miles away). It was here he wrote the poems &quot;The Rime of the Ancient Mariner&quot; and &quot;Kubla Khan&quot;.

The cottage is a Grade II* listed building.

The Coleridge Way starts at the cottage and celebrates his walks in the area.

===Poole House===
Poole House is thought to have been built in the late 17th century although some parts may be even older. Local tanner, politician and philanthropist Thomas Poole lived in the house in the late 18th and early 19th century. Poole provided a cottage, Coleridge Cottage, for the use of the romantic poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge. Coleridge spent much time in Poole House, reading and writing in the barrel room. William Wordsworth and his sister were also frequent visitors.

Poole House is now a grade II listed building and many original features remain including fireplaces and the Georgian interior.
===Clock Tower===
The Clock Tower in St Mary Street was built in 1897. During 2011, the Clock Tower underwent a major refurbishment job which saw the replacement of several components of the bell chiming system. The tower also received a fresh coat of paint.

The Clock Tower is a Grade II* listed building.

==Current facilities==

In the last 50 years, the building nearby of Hinkley Point A and Hinkley Point B nuclear power stations has produced small growth, including the building of a second new (last 20 years) housing development.

Local amenities include two pubs (&quot;The Ancient Mariner&quot;, and &quot;The George Hotel&quot;, a doctor&#x27;s surgery, a Retained / Part Time Fire Station and a primary school. There are also several shops, a post office, and places offering bed and breakfast. There is a tourist information centre in the library, which is housed in the old primary school building. Adjacent to this is a small car park with public toilets.

==Notable residents==
In July 1789, local resident John Walford murdered his wife after a visit to Castle of Comfort Farm (a pub that still exists). He was tried and found guilty. He was executed in the spot where he committed his crime and hung in a gibbet. Walford&#x27;s gibbet is a local landmark. The cage in which he was hung is now held at the Museum of Somerset in Taunton. Walford attained notoriety due to the brutality of the crime in an otherwise quiet and peaceful village. His relatives still live in the village to this day.

Thomas Poole was a local tanner who became wealthy and founded the Nether Stowey Women&#x27;s Friendly Society in 1807. The Society continued (under several different names) until 1975 and is still celebrated annually. Poole was also a patron of Coleridge and Wordsworth.

The village was the birthplace of Jesuit priest Robert Parsons.

The poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge lived in the village between 1797 and 1799, as noted above.

==Twinning==
The village is twinned with Theillay in the Loir-et-Cher department of France, and the Nether Stowey Twinning Association was established in 1996 by Glyn Legge and Steve Darch.
Every year Theillay and Nether Stowey organise an annual trip to each village, taking turns every year.

<doc id="205565" wikidata="Q6602864" url="?curid=205565" title="List of United States political families">
<text>Many families in the United States have produced multiple generations of politicians who have had a significant influence on government and public policy in their communities, states, and nationally. 

== Geographic distribution ==
Many of these families moved to national prominence from a single state or region, for example: the Huntingtons of Connecticut, the Longs of Louisiana, the Harrisons and Lees of Virginia, the Roosevelts of New York, the Daleys and the Stevensons of Illinois, the Muhlenbergs of Pennsylvania, the Tafts of Ohio, the Frelinghuysens of New Jersey, the Lodges of Massachusetts and the DuPonts of Delaware.

The Adams family come prominently from Massachusetts and is one of the main political dynasties in United States history. It includes two presidents (the second and the sixth), a Secretary of the Navy, the ambassador to the United Kingdom during the Civil War and multiple other high profile functions. 

Other families are or have been politically involved in multiple states. The Bush family includes two presidents (one a former Vice President, the other a former governor of Texas), a senator from Connecticut, and a governor of Florida. 

The Kennedy family included a president, an attorney general, and a senator from Massachusetts in one generation. Also a secretary for HHS. Other members have been elected to public office in New York, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Maryland, and California. 

Bill Clinton served as governor of Arkansas before being elected the 42nd president; his wife, Hillary Clinton, was elected as a senator from New York before serving as secretary of State. 

Members of the Rockefeller family have been elected to public office in New York, West Virginia and Arkansas. 

The Udall family first became prominent in Arizona, but three cousins from the most recent generation simultaneously served in the U.S. Senate from Colorado, New Mexico, and Oregon.

== Partisan leanings ==
In 2000, &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine observed that there are as many, if not more, Democratic political families as there were Republican &quot;dynasties&quot;.

<doc id="205566" wikidata="Q1203794" url="?curid=205566" title="Point Roberts, Washington">
<text>Point Roberts is a pene-exclave of Washington on the southernmost tip of the Tsawwassen peninsula, south of Vancouver, British Columbia. The area, which had a population of 1,191 at the 2020 census, is reached from the rest of the United States by traveling through Canada, or by boat or private airplane. It is a census-designated place in Whatcom County, Washington, with a post office, and a ZIP Code of 98281. Direct sea and air connections with the rest of the U.S. are available across Boundary Bay.

Point Roberts was created when the United Kingdom and the United States settled the Pacific Northwest American-Canadian border dispute in the mid-19th century with the Oregon Treaty. The two parties agreed that the 49th parallel would define the boundary between their respective territories, and the small area that incorporates Point Roberts is south of the 49th parallel. Questions about ceding the territory to the United Kingdom and later to Canada have been raised since its creation; however, its status has remained unchanged.

== History ==
The area around the southern Tsawwassen Peninsula was a favored fishing spot for several Coast Salish groups, who named the peninsula &quot;q̓ʷulƛ̕əl̕&quot;. The first Europeans to see Point Roberts were members of the 1791 expedition of Francisco de Eliza. The maps produced from Eliza&#x27;s explorations depicted Point Roberts as &quot;Isla de Cepeda&quot; or &quot;Isla de Zepeda.&quot; In 1792, the British expedition of George Vancouver and the Spanish expedition of Dionisio Alcalá Galiano encountered one another near Point Roberts. In the morning of June 13, 1792, the two ships under Galiano sailed into Boundary Bay and verified Point Roberts was not an island, which was thus renamed &quot;Punta Cepeda&quot;. They then sailed around Point Roberts and immediately encountered HMS &quot;Chatham&quot;, the second ship of Vancouver&#x27;s expedition. The two parties made contact and agreed to share information and work together in mapping the Strait of Georgia.

Point Roberts acquired its present name from George Vancouver, who named it after his friend Henry Roberts, who had originally been given command of the expedition. Point Roberts assumed its present political status in 1846, when the Oregon Treaty extended the 49th parallel as the boundary between U.S. and British territory from the Rocky Mountains to Georgia Strait.

=== Treaty history specific to Point Roberts ===
After years of joint occupation of the disputed area between Mexican California and Russian America (now Alaska) known as the Oregon Country to the Americans, and as the Columbia District to the British, American expansionists like U.S. Senator Edward A. Hannegan of Indiana urged U.S. President James K. Polk to annex the entire Oregon Country up to latitude 54°40′N, as the Democrats had been elected on the slogan &quot;Fifty-Four Forty or Fight&quot;.

While his government asserted that the title of the United States of America to the entire territory was unquestionable even though there was only one U.S. resident (a former Briton) north of the Columbia basin, Polk and Secretary of State James Buchanan made an offer of a boundary at 49 degrees with the line straight across Vancouver Island, with no commercial privilege to be granted to the British south of the line, with the exception of free ports on Vancouver Island. The British rejected the offer and the U.S. soon withdrew it.

On April 18, 1846, notice was forwarded to London that the U.S. Congress had adopted a joint resolution abrogating the Treaty of 1818 which provided for joint occupancy.

The British emissary, Richard Pakenham, had been advised that the last concession he could expect of the United States was to bend the boundary at the 49th parallel around the southern end of Vancouver Island. Fort Victoria was viewed as the future center for settlements on the island. It was deemed necessary around this point in time to give up territory on the Lower Mainland to keep Vancouver Island part of British North America.

Lord Aberdeen, British Foreign Secretary, proposed a treaty making the 49th parallel the boundary to the sea, giving the UK the whole of Vancouver Island. The Treaty of Oregon was concluded on June 15, 1846.

The acceptance of the 49th parallel as the international boundary was concluded without precise knowledge of its effects. Later, as the Boundary Commission surveyed the line, the British government realized the peninsula of Point Roberts would be an isolated part of the United States. The British Foreign Office instructed Captain James Prevost, the British Boundary Commissioner, to inform his U.S. counterpart of the situation and request Point Roberts be left to Britain, because of the great inconvenience it would be to the United States. If the American Boundary Commission was reluctant, Prevost was instructed to offer &quot;some equivalent compensation by a slight alteration of the Line of Boundary on the Mainland&quot;. It is not known how the U.S. commissioner responded, but Point Roberts remained part of the United States.
===Relationship with Canada===
During the 1858 Fraser gold rush, prospectors from Victoria, BC who were attempting to avoid tax collection briefly settled Point Roberts. Their settlement was called Robert&#x27;s Town and consisted of six wooden buildings, including a store and saloon, but lasted less than a year.

In 1949, there was talk about Point Roberts seceding from the U.S. and joining Canada. A regional development plan for the Lower Mainland presented in 1952 suggested turning Point Roberts into an international park or leasing it for 99 or 999 years. In 1973, a drought that caused the wells to run dry created tensions between Point Roberts&#x27;s U.S. and Canadian residents. The Americans threatened to cut off the Canadian residents&#x27; water supply — and hung up signs saying &quot;Canadians Go Home&quot; — unless the Canadian municipality of Delta agreed to provide water. An agreement signed on August 28, 1987, requires the Point Roberts Water District to purchase raw water on an annual basis from the Greater Vancouver Water District. Delta Fire Department also provides assistance to the Point Roberts volunteer fire department when requested. Until 1988, BC Tel (now Telus) provided telephone service; the sole exchange prefix of 945, officially part of area code 206, could also be dialed through area code 604 during the period of BC Tel ownership.

After the September 11 attacks of 2001, security at border crossings—including Point Roberts—was increased, leading to long delays for residents. The Canadian border was closed to non-essential travel in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which had been worsening in both countries but especially in the United States. In 2020, a study found that Point Roberts had lost 80 percent of its business and hundreds of seasonal residents as a result of the pandemic and border shutdown. The area, described as a &quot;ghost town&quot; by the local chamber of commerce director, had no confirmed cases of COVID-19 . A temporary ferry was set up by the Port of Bellingham in August 2020 to connect Point Roberts to the mainland, initially to Blaine and later to Bellingham. The Canadian government waived its mandatory COVID testing requirements for Point Roberts residents in February 2021, following negotiations with Washington state. The border was fully reopened for non-essential travel in August 2021 and the ferry service ceased the same month.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Point Roberts was acclaimed as the &quot;safest place&quot; for avoiding coronavirus due to its isolation from the mainland United States and Canada and very low case numbers. Because of limited access to the rest of Whatcom County and border closures into Canada, the case numbers remained very low. The City of Delta installed a chain-link fence at the end of English Bluff Road in 2025 to deter accidental crossings after an elderly man walked into Point Roberts. The fence was poorly received by local residents and at least one Delta councilmember demanded its removal.

== Geography ==

Point Roberts is a U.S. exclave bordered by Canada and the waters of Boundary Bay. It is south of Downtown Vancouver, British Columbia. Point Roberts is part of the U.S. because it lies south of the 49th parallel, which constitutes the Canada–US border in that area. Other exclaves of this type include parts of Minnesota such as the Northwest Angle and Elm Point, Minnesota. Alburgh, Vermont and nearby Province Point are separated from the rest of the U.S. by Lake Champlain, though Alburgh is reachable by highway bridge from &quot;mainland&quot; Vermont.

Point Roberts borders the municipality of Delta in British Columbia. Boundary Bay lies to the east of Point Roberts and the Strait of Georgia to the south and west. The U.S. portion of the peninsula is about from north to south and about from east to west. It has an area of , all land.

===Geology===
Beneath Point Roberts, the bedrock of the Chuckanut Formation was deposited as an alluvial plain containing layers of sediments consisting of silt, sand, gravel and peat. During the last 60 million years the sediments were compacted and folded by mountain building forces from continental drift to form strata of siltstone, sandstone, conglomerate and coal. During recent geologic history, the Chuckanut formation was overridden by four or more glaciations.

Point Roberts consists of a series of the resulting glacial sediments resting upon the Chuckanut Formation. The lowest glacial sediments (now near sea level) are from Salmon Springs or older glaciations. At the peak of the most recent glaciation, the main ice sheet was in excess of thick as it moved southward between Vancouver Island and the Canadian Coast Range and down the Strait of Georgia. A smaller lobe of the continental glacier in excess of traveled down the Fraser River flood plains merging with the main ice sheet over the greater Vancouver area and Whatcom and Skagit Counties. The coalesced continental ice sheet traveled south terminating in the vicinity of Chehalis, Washington. Relatively impermeable Vashon glacial lodgment till (estimated to be as much as thick at the uppermost layer) was plastered over the advance outwash as the weight of the thick plus Strait of Georgia ice lobe moved southward over approximately 10,000 years. (Armstrong, et al., 1965) Point Roberts, Tsawwassen, and part of British Columbia extending past English Bluff comprised an island at the close of the Vashon Glaciation, approximately 11,000 years ago.

As the ice sheets melted, the thinner Fraser Lobe began to float while the Strait of Georgia lobe acted as a dam forming a lake under the Fraser Lobe. Sediments settling from the melting, floating ice resulted in the accumulation of or more of glacial marine drift over much of western Whatcom County. (Easterbrook, 1976; Geologic Map of Western Whatcom County, Washington, USGS, Map I-854-B) This glacial marine drift is generally soft and was not consolidated by the weight of the glacier. A discontinuous, thin mantle of this glacial marine drift above the glacial lodgement till has been identified sporadically across Point Roberts. The uppermost layer of glacial sediments consists of recessional sand, silt, and gravel deposited as the Strait of Georgia ice lobe receded. Since the recession of the glaciers, the Fraser River has deposited deltaic sediments on the north and easterly side of the Point Roberts-Tsawwassen Island, connecting it to the Greater Vancouver mainland (approximately 2,500 years ago, Murray 2008). At some locations, these sediments have been eroded or removed, exposing the lodgement till.

===Climate===
Despite its proximity to 49 °N latitude, Point Roberts has an Oceanic climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfb&quot;); however, winters may be colder for this climatic subtype, similar to the Vancouver-Seattle-Portland axis. Point Roberts lies within a depression created by Vancouver Island, the north shore mountains surrounding Vancouver, and the North Cascades (including Mount Baker). This micro-climate provides some of the mildest weather in the Pacific Northwest. With annual precipitation of about , Point Roberts enjoys more sunny days and a milder climate than its neighbors. While 49 °N latitude suggests a harsh winter, snow averages and low January temperatures are milder than the American average: in vs and vs , respectively. Although the amount of rainfall is less than the regional average, it is better-distributed through the year , with 146 days of precipitation. The comfort index is high.

==Demographics==
As of the 2010 United States Census, there were 1,314 people, 678 households, and 372 families residing in the Point Roberts ZCTA (ZIP Code Tabulation Area). There were 2,068 housing units, only 678 (33%) of which were occupied. The racial makeup of the ZCTA was 91.9% White, 0.8% African American, 0.8% Native American, 4.5% Asian, 0.3% from other races, and 1.7% from two or more races. Hispanics or Latinos of any race were 2.4% of the population.

The age distribution was 16.2% under 20, 3.0% from 20 to 24, 16.2% from 25 to 44, 40.7% from 45 to 64, and 23.9% who were 65 or older. The median age was 52.7 years.

The median income for a household in the ZCTA was $58,672; the median income for a family was $75,724; and the per capita income was $39,696.

During the summer the population swells to about 4,500, most of the visitors being vacationing Canadians.

Point Roberts&#x27; population includes descendants of Icelandic immigrants, who first settled there in the 1890s.

==Economy==
Many of the area&#x27;s businesses serve weekend and recreational visitors from Greater Vancouver. Canadians visit for cheaper American gasoline, alcohol, and food when the Canadian dollar is strong; Americans from Point Roberts do the same in Canada. Many Canadians visited its bars and nightclubs on Sundays until Sunday drinking was legalized in British Columbia in 1986. The local post office and several private companies rent many post office boxes to individuals and businesses from the Greater Vancouver area, who find it a convenient and fast way to receive mail and parcels from the United States without paying for cross-border shipping costs, or as a delivery point for online purchases when American sellers do not ship outside the U.S. The U.S. Consulate General in Vancouver also used the Point Roberts post office, but it has since changed to using one in Blaine, on the contiguous border.

Because entry to Point Roberts from the rest of the U.S. requires two international border crossings, it has sometimes been described as &quot;the best gated community in the U.S.&quot; Residents enjoy a low crime rate, with a high local security presence. Popular folklore describes the town as a popular resettlement site for the US Federal Witness Protection Program, assisting informants who testify against criminals to relocate under new identities for their protection.

While there is one doctor&#x27;s clinic, there is no hospital, dentist, pharmacist or veterinarian, and because American health insurers will not pay for treatment from Canadian providers, Point Roberts residents usually seek medical care in Bellingham, Washington, although Vancouver is closer.

Point Roberts has a single grocery store, which threatened to close in July 2021 due to the prolonged COVID-19 travel restrictions. An emergency grant of $100,000 from the state government was approved in late June to prevent its closure.

==Education==

Point Roberts Primary School, the only school in the exclave, provides only kindergarten and first, second and third grades and is part of the Blaine School District. It is the smallest school in Whatcom County, with approximately 15 students and one full-time teacher, and is classified as a remote and necessary school by the state government. The three-room schoolhouse opened in 1993 and began offering third grade lessons in 1999. From 4th grade onward, American children must take a 40-minute ride through British Columbia, crossing back into the United States at Blaine, Washington. Canadian children can attend school in Delta, British Columbia.

==Infrastructure==

===Transportation===
The only authorized land access to Canada from Point Roberts is Point Roberts-Boundary Bay Border Crossing, the westernmost in the Lower 48. On the US side, this major thoroughfare northward is named Tyee Drive; on the Canadian side, it is 56th Street. Point Roberts also has a small airport (Point Roberts Airpark) and a large marina (Point Roberts Marina Resort) for air and water access; these two point facilities allow direct access to the rest of Washington state without the need to enter Canada.

A temporary passenger ferry service from Point Roberts to Blaine operated by the Port of Bellingham and the Whatcom Transportation Authority entered service in August 2020 amid the COVID-19 pandemic, which had caused the Canadian border to be closed to non-essential travel for several months. The ferry used two vessels leased from San Juan Cruises and was fare-free. It was initially run once per week, but the frequency was increased to twice a week and the ferry was diverted to serve the Bellingham Cruise Terminal due to high demand. Ferry service ended in August 2021.

Roosevelt Road follows the US side of the border across the peninsula. To the west, it ends at a small park, Monument Park built around &quot;Monument 1&quot;, the westernmost point of the 49th parallel border.

===Telecommunications===
Until 1988, Point Roberts telephone numbers were in British Columbia&#x27;s area code 604 and served by BCTel, the local telephone company for most of British Columbia. It was served by the 945 exchange which was officially in area code 206, the area code for most of western Washington, but protected in 604, resulting in the oddity of calls from British Columbia being local calls while calls from Washington and the rest of the United States were billed as international calls. In 1988, Point Roberts service was severed from BC Tel, and the protection of the 604-945 prefix ended, at the expense of losing the ability to make local calls to any other exchange in either country. Along with the rest of Whatcom County, Point Roberts moved to area code 360 in 1995. The local regular-service telecom provider is Whidbey Telecom.

Although Point Roberts is nominally part of the Seattle television market, the only over-the-air stations available in the town come from the Metro Vancouver region and Bellingham, Washington. Cable television in Point Roberts was provided by Delta Cable, a subsidiary of Canadian cable company EastLink. Delta Cable pulled out of Point Roberts with short notice in August 2019.

Whidbey Telecom is the broadband Internet provider to residents of Point Roberts. In 2019, Whidbey Telecom began construction to provide fiber-optic Internet to Point Roberts.

Mobile telephone service is provided by a variety of companies, both American and Canadian.

<text>Lieutenant General Sir William George Shedden Dobbie, (12 July 1879 – 3 October 1964) was a British Army officer who served in the Second Boer War and the First and Second World Wars.

==Early life==
William was born in Madras to a civil servant father, W. H. Dobbie of the Indian Civil Service – and to a family with a long military lineage. When he was only nine months old, his parents left him in the care of relatives in England, so that he might receive an education in keeping with his family&#x27;s station.
At thirteen, young William won a scholarship to Charterhouse School and became a top-ranking classical scholar and a keen student of ancient military campaigns. Upon graduation, he proved to be qualified for a military career at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, from which, in due course, he went to the Royal School of Military Engineering at Chatham. He was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Royal Engineers on 6 August 1899.

==Second Boer War to First World War==
Dobbie joined the Second Boer War shortly after the funeral of Queen Victoria in February 1901, and was promoted to lieutenant while in South Africa, on 1 April 1902. He was wounded, and returned to the United Kingdom shortly after the end of hostilities, arriving in Southampton in July 1902. He later opined that the Second Boer War was a rather unjust war. Following his return he was stationed at Chatham in late 1902, and was promoted to captain on 6 August 1908. He attended the Staff College, Camberley, from 1911 to 1912.

==First World War==
Dobbie was appointed a Knight of the Legion of Honour in November 1914 and appointed a GSO 3rd Grade on 1 April 1915. and in July a GSO2, taking over from Brevet Lieutenant Colonel G. F. Boyd. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order on 14 January 1916, promoted to major on 1 April 1916, promoted to temporary lieutenant colonel on 19 August 1916 (retroactive from 6 July 1915 on 1 January 1920) and brevetted to lieutenant colonel on 1 January 1917. During the First World War, Dobbie happened to have been the staff officer on duty in November 1918 and his is the only signature on the cease-fire telegram that was sent to all troops. In later years, when asked what he did during the war, Dobbie would reply &quot;I stopped the bloody thing!&quot;. After the war Dobbie was appointed an Officer of the Order of Leopold on 21 August 1919.

==Interwar years==
Dobbie was graded a temporary lieutenant colonel on 18 April 1920 and brevetted to colonel on 1 July 1922. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel on 1 January 1925 and to colonel on 18 January 1926. On 29 June 1928, he was appointed commander of the Cairo Brigade with the rank of brigadier, then considered a temporary rank. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath in the 1930 New Year Honours List. He reverted to his permanent rank of colonel and ceased to be employed from 15 July 1932, being placed on half-pay. On 18 February 1933, he was promoted to major general and appointed Commandant of the School of Military Engineers. He was appointed General Officer Commanding Malaya Command on 8 November 1935, holding the post to 1939.

==Second World War==
Dobbie, then holding the rank of major general, was informed that after Malaya he would be retired, because new War Office regulations deemed him too old for a further position. After war was declared in September, he was frustrated in his attempts to return to active service, until in April 1940 he encountered the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, Edmund Ironside, who offered him the position of Governor of Malta and Commander-in-chief of Malta. As acting Governor, he was granted the acting rank of lieutenant-general on 27 April 1940, and was knighted as a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath on 14 March 1941. Promoted to temporary lieutenant general on 27 April, he was confirmed as Governor of Malta on 19 May. He remained Governor of Malta until May 1942, and retired with the honorary rank of lieutenant-general on 10 November 1942.

When he arrived on Malta, its defensibility was in question because of the presumed ease with which Italy could overrun it. There were only 4 planes on the island and these had probably been overlooked. Few other than Churchill saw any strategic value in maintaining it and the commitment of the Maltese to the British cause was also questioned.

On the day Italy declared war Dobbie issued a statement to the garrison:
:The decision of His Majesty&#x27;s government to fight until our enemies are defeated will be heard with the greatest satisfaction by all ranks of the Garrison of Malta.
:It may be that hard times lie ahead of us, but I know that however hard they may be, the courage and determination of all ranks will not falter, and that with God&#x27;s help we will maintain the security of this fortress.
:I call on all officers and other ranks humbly to seek God&#x27;s help, and then in reliance on Him to do their duty unflinchingly.

Despite being a Protestant on a Catholic island, his faith became an asset. Admiral Cunningham, commander-in-chief of the Mediterranean Fleet, described him as &quot;an Ironside of a man. His profound faith in the justice of our cause made a great impression on the religious Maltese. The complete and calm faith shown in the broadcasts he made nearly every evening contributed immensely towards keeping up the morale of the people&quot;.

Over the next two years, Malta was a crucial element of war in the Mediterranean. Churchill responded to Dobbie&#x27;s requests for planes and reinforcements and the Malta Fortress played a key part in reducing the German supply lines in North Africa, until the Luftwaffe joined in the most intense bombardment of the war in early 1942. In two months there were 500 air raids during which 27 times the tonnage of bombs were dropped as in the Coventry Blitz.

Two attempts to relieve the island failed when supply ships were bombed in the harbour and a succession of Spitfires were picked off on the ground shortly after delivery. There also were problems in the Administrative Council in which a blame culture had emerged. Despite a visit from Dobbie&#x27;s friend Lord Cranbourne, in May 1942 Churchill replaced Dobbie, who was exhausted and unwell, with Viscount Gort. Gort brought with him the George Cross that had been awarded to the island by King George VI. Dobbie himself received the Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George.

==Personal life and later years==
He and his wife Sybil (nee Orde-Browne) had one daughter, also called Sybil, who was married to Percival Johnston. They also had two sons, Arthur William Granville Dobbie who died on the 19th of June 1944 aged 38 and was a member of the Royal Engineers 237th Field Company. Orde Charles Staple Dobbie was their other son.

Dobbie was a member of the Protestant Plymouth Brethren, and when living in The Paragon, Blackheath, attended the large Brethren assembly in Nightingale Vale, Woolwich Common, London SE18. He was a member of the Board of Governors of Monkton Combe School in Somerset from 1942 to 1964.

Dobbie died on 3 October 1964 in Kensington, London, England, at the age of 85 years. He was buried in Charlton Cemetery, near the Chindit memorial of his nephew Major General Orde Wingate (1903–1944). His wife Sybil and other members of his family are also buried there.

==Dobbie&#x27;s hypothesis regarding the capture of Singapore==
In 1936, Dobbie, then General Officer Commanding (Malaya) stationed in Singapore, made an inquiry to find out if more forces were required on mainland Malaya to prevent the Japanese landing and capturing forward bases to attack Singapore. Percival, then his Chief Staff Officer, was assigned the task of drawing up a tactical appreciation on how the Japanese were most likely to attack. Percival&#x27;s report in late 1937 did confirm that north Malaya could serve as a base for the conquest of Singapore and Borneo.
Both Dobbie and Percival made it clear that Singapore could no longer be seen as a self-contained naval base, and that its survival rested on the defence of mainland Malaya. So in May 1938, Dobbie wrote to the Chief of Staff:

Dobbie added that an attack might be possible between the months of November and March, despite high winds and waves produced by the northeast monsoon. The recent landing of &quot;5000 smuggled coolies&quot; at this time dissolved any preconceptions that the monsoon offered protection. On the contrary, this monsoon would provide good cloud cover for the invaders.

<doc id="205576" wikidata="Q3554074" url="?curid=205576" title="Fraser Valley">
<text>The Fraser Valley is a geographical region in southwestern British Columbia, Canada and northwestern Washington State. It starts just west of Hope in a narrow valley encompassing the Fraser River and ends at the Pacific Ocean stretching from the North Shore Mountains, opposite the city of Vancouver BC, to just south of Bellingham, Washington.

In casual usage it typically describes the Fraser River basin downstream of the Fraser Canyon. The term is sometimes used outside British Columbia to refer to the entire Fraser River sections including the Fraser Canyon and up from there to its headwaters, but in general British Columbian usage the term refers to the stretch of Lower Mainland west of the Coquihalla River mouth at the inland town of Hope, and includes all of the Canadian portion of the Fraser Lowland as well as the valleys and upland areas flanking it. It is divided into the Upper Fraser Valley and Lower Fraser Valley by the Vedder River mouth at the eastern foothills of Sumas Mountain, although the Lower Valley section upstream of McMillan Island and the Salmon River mouth (at Fort Langley) used to be called the Central Fraser Valley up until 1995 (see Central Fraser Valley Regional District).

Administratively, the Fraser Valley comprises parts of the regional districts of Metro Vancouver and the Fraser Valley Regional District. The main population centres in the Fraser Valley are Greater Vancouver, Abbotsford and Chilliwack.

==History==

This section of the Fraser River is known by local indigenous peoples as &quot;Sto:lo&quot; in the Halqemeylem language of the area, and this term has been adopted to refer to all of the indigenous peoples of the Fraser Lowland, other than the Squamish and Musqueam. The indigenous peoples of the area have long made use of the river valley for agricultural and commercial exploits and continue to do so today.

The Indigenous people were not consulted in the Treaty of Oregon, which saw the United States and Great Britain define and recognize each other&#x27;s claims to the area. This overstepping of jurisdiction inevitably led to conflict as Great Britain was incapable of exercising the control they claimed over the river valley. As a wave of immigrants flooded into the Fraser River Valley because of the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush, the British were unable to maintain order without the cooperation of the local indigenous peoples, and the Fraser Canyon War broke out. The war was resolved with a series of treaties, none of which remain to this day, but which evidently included the regulation of immigration and the continuation of mining on the river by the indigenous inhabitants and the new immigrants. This war was part of a series of local conflicts surrounding the arrival of settlers ahead of American and British capacity to maintain order and refusal to cooperate with or recognize indigenous land claims and demands. These conflicts were pivotal in many aspects to the settlement of the West Coast in both Canada and the United States.

The interaction of indigenous peoples and settlers led to the growth of Chinook Wawa, a pidgin language that was used throughout the Fraser River Valley until the early 1900s. Industrialization of the river began with the use of the traditional trade waterway by steamboats and eventually, roads and railways were built, fueled by and in turn fuelling further population growth. Today, the most important transportation through the region are the Canadian Pacific Railway and Canadian National Railway transcontinental main lines, the Lougheed Highway (Hwy 7), and the Trans-Canada Highway (Hwy 1).

==Geography==

After descending through the rapids of the Fraser Canyon, the Fraser River emerges almost at sea level at Yale, over 100 km inland. Although the canyon in geographic terms is defined as ending at Yale, Hope is generally to be considered the southern end of the canyon, partly because of the change in the character of the highway from that point, and perhaps also because it is at Hope that the first floodplains typifying the course of the Lower Fraser are found. Downstream from Hope, the river and adjoining floodplains widen considerably in the area of Rosedale, Chilliwack and Agassiz, which is considered the head of the Fraser Delta. From there the river passes through some of the most fertile agricultural land in British Columbia—as well as the heart of the Metro Vancouver region—on its way through the valley to its mouth at Georgia Strait.

During the last ice age, the area that would become the Fraser Valley was covered by a sheet of ice, walled in by the surrounding mountains. As the ice receded, land that had been covered by glaciers became covered by water instead, then slowly rose above the water, forming the basin that exists today. The valley is the largest landform of the Lower Mainland ecoregion, with its delta considered to begin in the area of Agassiz and Chilliwack, although stretches of floodplain flank the mountainsides between there and Hope.

Several of the Fraser&#x27;s lower tributaries have floodplains of their own, shared in common with the Fraser freshet. Of varying size these include the Harrison River, Chilliwack River (Vedder River), Hatzic Creek and Hatzic Lake, the Stave, Alouette, Pitt and Coquitlam Rivers. Also incorporated in the Fraser delta region are the Nicomekl and Serpentine River floodplains and the Sumas River drainage, which flow to saltwater independently of the Fraser but help drain its lowland. The Fraser is tidal as far upstream as the town of Mission and, across the river, the City of Abbotsford, which is at the Fraser&#x27;s closest approach to the international boundary, about 6 miles north of Sumas, Washington. Pitt Lake, one of the Fraser&#x27;s last tributaries and among its largest, is so low in elevation, despite its mountain setting, that it is one of the largest tidal freshwater lakes in the world .

Oxbow lakes and side-sloughs are a common feature of the Lower Fraser&#x27;s geography. The two main oxbows are those of Hatzic Lake and the Stave River on opposite sides of Mission, although that of the Stave has been silted in and part of it drained for a man-made lake. Around Fort Langley is an oxbow formation, mostly swamped in at the time of the fort&#x27;s foundation, which was drained and made part of the fort&#x27;s farm and remains farmland today. The system of sloughs and side-channels of the river is complicated, but important sloughs include those around Nicomen Island, Sea Bird Island and flanking the river from Rosedale to Sumas Mountain, on the western side of Chilliwack.
==Climate==

In winter, the Fraser Valley occasionally plays a significant role in the weather regime along the west coast of North America as far south as California, acting as a natural outlet for the intensely cold Arctic air mass which typically sits over Western Canada during winter. Under certain meteorological conditions strong winds pour out of the Fraser Valley and over the relatively warmer waters of the Strait of Georgia and the Strait of Juan de Fuca. This can cause ocean-effect snow, especially between Port Angeles and Sequim, where the air mass collides with the Olympic Mountains. The cold air from the Fraser Valley can also flow out over the Pacific Ocean. Lanes of convective ocean-effect clouds and showers are produced as heat and moisture modify the very dry, frigid air mass. These then typically organize as a low pressure system which returns the showers to the coast south of Canada, often bringing snow to unusually low elevations.

==Demographics==
=== Fraser Valley Regional District ===
According to the 2011 Census, 76.47% of the Fraser Valley regional district in BC have English as mother tongue; Punjabi is the mother tongue of 10.02% of the population, followed by German (3.49%), Dutch (1.39%), French (1.07%), Korean (0.69%), Spanish (0.66%), Tagalog (0.35%), Chinese, n.o.s. (0.33%), and Vietnamese (0.30%).


== Modern land use ==
Today, the Fraser Valley has a mix of land uses, ranging from the urban and industrial centres of Vancouver, Surrey, and Abbotsford through golf courses and parks to dairy farms and market gardens.

Agricultural land in the valley – much of it protected by the Agricultural Land Reserve – is intensively farmed: the Fraser Valley brings in nearly 40% of British Columbia&#x27;s annual agricultural revenue, although it makes up a small percentage of the province&#x27;s total land area.

The Fraser Valley, specifically in Abbotsford, is the northernmost area of rice cultivation in the world.

== Air quality ==
As the valley population grows and traffic increases, air pollution becomes an increasingly important issue; various controversies have risen over the years (most recently over &quot;Sumas 2&quot;, a defeated proposal for a power plant just south of the Canadian/USA border) as to whether or not air pollution is a problem, and if it is a problem, how this should be addressed.

Air quality monitoring has improved in recent years and it is now possible to compare BC communities on a variety of measures. Comparative data on four measures—fine particulate matter, ground-level ozone, nitrogen dioxide and sulphur dioxide—shows the Fraser Valley to have better air quality than Vancouver on several measures. For example, Fraser Valley communities had less than half the levels of nitrogen dioxide, and were lower in fine particulate matter and sulphur dioxide (on the latter measure, Abbotsford and Chilliwack were among the lowest of all BC sites).

In certain weather conditions during the summer, prevailing westerly winds blow air pollution from vehicles and from ships in Vancouver harbour east up the triangular delta, trapping it between the Coast Mountains on the north and the Cascades on the southeast. Air quality suffers. This usually occurs during a temperature inversion, and lasts for a few days. Ground-level ozone tends to be from local sources in the valley and varies with prevailing winds. With prevailing winds from the northeast during the late fall and winter, air quality is seldom a problem.

Air quality in the Fraser Valley at times exceeds the Canada-Wide Standard (CWS) for ozone (at Hope) and is close to exceeding the CWS for Particulate Matter.

== Modern usage of the name ==
In colloquial usage, &quot;Fraser Valley&quot; usually refers only to that part of the valley beyond the continuously built-up urban area around Vancouver, up to and including Chilliwack and Agassiz, about 80 km east, and abutting the border with Washington&#x27;s Whatcom County; news media typically also include the built-up eastern suburban areas of Vancouver which a few decades ago were mixed farmland and forest, typical of &quot;the Valley&quot;. The Fraser Valley region is also the namesake of the Fraser Valley Regional District, though that consists of only about half of the actual Fraser Valley, and is made up of the municipalities and incorporated areas from Abbotsford and Mission eastwards to Hope. It also includes areas not in the Fraser Valley, particularly the lower Fraser Canyon from Boston Bar to Hope.

The term &quot;Central Fraser Valley&quot; refers to Mission and Abbotsford and is included within the Lower Fraser Valley. The Upper Fraser Valley means from Chilliwack and Agassiz to Hope. The phrases &quot;Fraser Valley towns&quot; and &quot;Fraser River municipalities&quot; include Delta and Richmond, though the colloquial &quot;in the Valley&quot; means from Surrey and Coquitlam eastwards.

The &quot;Tidal Fraser area&quot; is usually defined as the area of the Fraser from the mouth at the Pacific Ocean to the Mission bridge. Everything in between there is influenced greatly by ocean tides, including the largest tidal lake in North America, Pitt Lake.

== Sociology ==

The south shore of the Central and Upper Fraser Valley is also known colloquially as the &quot;Bible Belt&quot; of British Columbia and is home to many of Canada&#x27;s largest churches, notably the Mennonite Brethren and the Dutch Reformed Church, a reflection of the heavy settlement of the Valley by post-war Dutch and German immigrants, as well as the Canadian headquarters of many Christian/Evangelical para-church organisations such as Focus on the Family and Power to Change, the Canadian branch of Cru_(Christian_organization), formerly known as Campus Crusade for Christ. Voters in south shore ridings typically elect right-wing candidates, while in ridings on the river&#x27;s north side elections sway between left-wing and right-wing parties regularly.

<text>A bomb shelter is a structure designed to provide protection against the effects of a bomb.

==Types of shelter==
Different kinds of bomb shelters are configured to protect against different kinds of attack and strengths of hostile explosives.

===Air raid shelter===
An air raid shelter is a structure built to protect against bomber planes dropping bombs over a large area. These were commonly seen during World War II, such as the &quot;Anderson shelters&quot; of the United Kingdom.

===Fallout shelter===
A fallout shelter is a shelter designed specifically for a nuclear war, with thick walls made from materials intended to block the radiation from fallout resulting from a nuclear explosion. Many such shelters were constructed as civil defense measures during the Cold War. A blast shelter protects against more conventional bomb blasts. Its main purpose is to protect from shock waves and overpressure and also from earthquake.

===Bunker===
While these forms of bomb shelters are equally amenable to civilians and military use, a bunker is more commonly associated with military use. A bunker may be hastily assembled as part of an ongoing military advance, or to hold a line. Bunkers have also been popular with the survivalism subculture.

==History==
While military units have long built defensive structures to protect against various kinds of hostile bombardment, the use of the phrase &quot;bomb shelter&quot; can be traced at least as far back as 1833. A dictionary from that year defines a &quot;casement&quot; as &quot;a bomb-proof shelter for soldiers in garrison&quot;. In 1881, the United States War Department issued a report in which it indicated that the defenses of Charleston, South Carolina included construction at Fort Moultrie of:

The shortening of this phrase to the conventional &quot;bomb shelter&quot; appears in print at least as early as 1895.

<text>Transport in Europe provides for the movement needs of over 700 million people and associated freight.

==Overview==
The political geography of Europe divides the continent into over 50 sovereign states and territories. This fragmentation, along with increased movement of people since the Industrial Revolution, has led to a high level of cooperation between European countries in developing and maintaining transport networks. Supranational and intergovernmental organisations such as the European Union (EU), Council of Europe and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe have led to the development of international standards and agreements that allow people and freight to cross the borders of Europe, largely with unique levels of freedom and ease.
Road, rail, air and water transportation are all prevalent and important across Europe. Europe was the location of the world&#x27;s first railways and motorways and is now the location of some of the world&#x27;s busiest ports and airports. The Schengen Area enables border control-free travel between 26 European countries. Freight transportation has a high level of intermodal compatibility and the European Economic Area allows the free movement of goods across 30 states. Of all tonne-kilometres transported in 2016, 51% were by road, 33% by sea, 12% by rail, 4% by inland waterways, and 0.1% by air.

A review of critical success factors for the delivery of transport infrastructure projects in Europe is presented in a 2017 report.

==Rail transport==

Powered rail transport began in England in the early 19th century with the invention of the speed train. The modern European rail network spans almost the entire continent, with the exception of Andorra, Cyprus, Iceland, Malta, and San Marino. It provides movement of passengers and freight. There are significant high-speed rail passenger networks, such as the TGV in France and the LAV in Spain. The Channel Tunnel connects the United Kingdom with France and thus the whole of the European rail system, and it was called one of the seven wonders of the modern world by the American Society of Civil Engineers. The longest railway tunnel in the world, the Gotthard Base Tunnel, crosses the Alps in Switzerland.

Various method of rail electrification are used as well as much unelectrified track. Multi system locomotives and EMUs allow for cross-border services. Standard gauge is widespread in Central and Western Europe, Russian gauge predominates in parts of Eastern Europe, and mainline services on the Iberian Peninsula and the island of Ireland use the rarer Iberian gauge and Irish gauge, respectively. In mountainous areas, narrow-gauge railways are common. The European Rail Traffic Management System is an EU initiative to create a Europe-wide standard for train signalling.

Rail infrastructure, freight transport and passenger services are provided by a combination of local and national governments and private companies. Passenger ticketing varies from country to country and service to service. The Eurail Pass, a rail pass for 18 European countries, is available only for persons who do not live in Europe, Morocco, Algeria or Tunisia. Interrail passes allow multi-journey travel around Europe for people living in Europe and surrounding countries.

Rail transport in Europe has diverse technological standards, operating concepts, and infrastructures. Common features are the widespread use of standard-gauge rail, high operational safety and a high proportion of electrification. Electrified railway networks in Europe operate at many different voltages, both AC and DC, varying from 750 to 25,000 volts, and signaling systems vary from country to country, complicating cross-border traffic.

The European Union (EU) aims to make cross-border operations easier as well as to introduce competition to national rail networks. EU member states were empowered to separate the provision of transport services and the management of the infrastructure by the Single European Railway Directive 2012. Usually, national railway companies were split into separate divisions or independent companies for infrastructure, passenger and freight operations. The passenger operations may be further divided into long-distance and regional services, because regional services often operate under public service obligations (which maintain services which are not economically interesting to private companies but nonetheless produce societal benefit), while long-distance services usually operate without subsidies.
Across the EU, passenger rail transport saw a 50% increase between 2021 and 2022, with the 2022 passenger-kilometers figure being slightly under that of 2019 (i.e. before the COVID-19 pandemic). The trend is expected to continue and rapid investments in European Union railways are under way.

Switzerland is the European leader in kilometres traveled by rail per inhabitant and year, followed by Austria and France among EU countries. Switzerland was also ranked first among national European rail systems in the 2017 European Railway Performance Index, followed by Denmark, Finland and Germany.

Nearly all European countries have operational railway lines, the only exceptions being Iceland, Cyprus and the microstates of Andorra (which never had one) and Malta and San Marino (whose single railway lines were either entirely or mostly dismantled). Russia, Germany and France have the longest railway networks in Europe. Apart from the islands of Great Britain, Ireland and Denmark, operational island railways are also present on Corsica, Isle of Man, Mallorca, Sardinia, Sicily and Wangerooge.

Public transport timetables, including rail, are amended yearly, usually on the second Sunday of December and June, respectively. The European Rail Timetable publishes rail schedules for all European countries.

Eurail and Interrail are both rail passes for international rail travel in Europe for tourists.

=== Rapid transit ===
Many cities across Europe have a rapid transit system, commonly referred to as a metro, which is an electric railway. The world&#x27;s first underground railway, the Metropolitan Railway, was opened in London in 1863. It is now part of London&#x27;s rapid transit system that referred to as the London Underground, the longest such system in Europe. After London, the largest European metro systems by track length are in Moscow, Madrid and Paris.

==Roads==
The International E-road network is a numbering system for roads in Europe developed by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE). The network is numbered from E1 up and its roads cross national borders. It also reaches Central Asian countries like Kyrgyzstan, since they are members of the UNECE.

Main international traffic arteries in Europe are defined by ECE/TRANS/SC.1/2016/3/Rev.1 which consider three types of roads: motorways, limited access roads, and ordinary roads.

In most countries, the roads carry the European route designation alongside national designations. Belgium, Norway and Sweden have roads which only have the European route designations (examples: E18 and E6). The United Kingdom, Albania and the Asian part of Russia only use national road designations and do not show the European designations at all. All route numbers in Andorra are unsigned. Denmark only uses the European designations on signage, but also has formal names for every motorway (or part of such), by which the motorways are referred to, for instance in news and weather forecasts. In Asia, Turkey and Russia show the European designations on signage; this is not the case in many other Asian countries.

Other continents have similar international road networks, e.g., the Pan-American Highway in the Americas, the Trans-African Highway network, and the Asian Highway Network.

UNECE was formed in 1947, and their first major act to improve transport was a joint UN declaration no. 1264, the Declaration on the Construction of Main International Traffic Arteries, signed in Geneva on 16 September 1950, which defined the first E-road network. Originally it was envisaged that the E-road network would be a motorway system comparable to the US Interstate Highway System. The declaration was amended several times until 15 November 1975, when it was replaced by the European Agreement on Main International Traffic Arteries or &quot;AGR&quot;, which set up a route numbering system and improved standards for roads in the list. The AGR last went through a major change in 1992 and in 2001 was extended into Central Asia to include the Caucasus nations. There were several minor revisions since, last in 2008 ().

==Coach transport==
In the early 2010s, many countries in Europe decided to liberalize the market for medium/long distance coach (intercity bus) transportation, obliged to do it by the EC directive 1370/2007 (Public Service Obligations in Transport). This move has already proven to be helping both the economies and the Europeans.

The bus is the cheapest method of transportation and slower than the train in countries that have high-speed rail. However, many companies have made adjustments so that their coach fleets can be as comfortable as trains. Toilets and power have been added to the coaches, and some are equipped with WiFi.

==Air transport==
Despite an extensive road and rail network, 43% of international travel within the EU was by air in 2013. Air travel is particularly important for peripheral nations such as Spain and Greece and island nations such as Malta and Cyprus, where a large majority of border crossings are by air. A large tourism industry also attracts many visitors to Europe, most of whom arrive into one of Europe&#x27;s many large international airports – major hubs include London Heathrow, Istanbul, Paris-Charles De Gaulle, Frankfurt and Amsterdam Schiphol. The advent of low cost carriers in recent years has led to a large increase in air travel within Europe. Air transportation is now often the cheapest way of travelling between cities. This increase in air travel has led to problems of airspace overcrowding and environmental concerns. The Single European Sky is one initiative aimed at solving these problems.

Within the European Union, the complete freedoms of the air and the world&#x27;s most extensive cabotage agreements allow budget airlines to operate freely across the EU. Cheap air travel is spurred on by the trend for regional airports levying low fees to market themselves as serving large cities quite far away. Ryanair is especially noted for this, since it primarily flies out of regional airports up to 150 kilometres away from the cities they are said to serve. A primary example of this is the Weeze-Skavsta flight, where Weeze mainly serves the Nijmegen/Kleve area, while Skavsta serves Nyköping/Oxelösund. Ryanair however, markets this flight as Düsseldorf-Stockholm, which are both 80–90 kilometres away from these airports, resulting in up to four hours of ground transportation just to get to and from the airport.

== Sea and river transport ==

The Port of Rotterdam, Netherlands is the largest port in Europe and one of the busiest ports in the world, handling some 440 million metric tons of cargo in 2013. When the associated Europoort industrial area is included, Rotterdam is by certain measurements the world&#x27;s busiest port. Two thirds of all inland water freight shipping within the EU, and 40% of containers, pass through the Netherlands. Other large ports are the Port of Hamburg in Germany and the Port of Antwerp in Belgium. They are all a part of the so-called &quot;Northern Range&quot;.

The English Channel is one of the world&#x27;s busiest seaways carrying over 400 ships per day between Europe&#x27;s North Sea and Baltic Sea ports and the rest of the world.

As well as its role in freight movement, sea transport is an important part of Europe&#x27;s energy supply. Europe is one of the world&#x27;s major oil tanker discharge destinations. Energy is also supplied to Europe by sea in the form of LNG. The South Hook LNG terminal at Milford Haven, Wales is Europe&#x27;s largest LNG terminal.

The Rhine is an important route for cargo ships, transporting goods from Rotterdam (Netherlands) upstream as far as Basel (Merchant Marine of Switzerland).

<text>The Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX; ) is a stock exchange located in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is the 10th largest exchange in the world and the third largest in North America based on market capitalization. Based in the EY Tower in Toronto&#x27;s Financial District, the TSX is a wholly owned subsidiary of the TMX Group for the trading of senior equities.

==History==
===Beginnings===
The Toronto Stock Exchange likely descended from the Association of Brokers, a group formed by Toronto businessmen on July 26, 1852. No records of the group&#x27;s transactions have survived. It is however known that on October 25, 1861, twenty-four brokers gathered at the Masonic Hall to create and participate in the &quot;Toronto Stock Exchange&quot;. Between 1852 and 1870, two other distinct, commodity-orientated, exchanges were founded : the &quot;Toronto Exchange&quot; in 1854 and the &quot;Toronto Stock and Mining Exchange&quot; in 1868. Initially the TSE had 13 listings but it grew to 18 in 1868 (a majority of bonds and bank&#x27;s issues). Many banks of Upper Canada failed during 1869, which halted any sort of trading in the city as the market was just too small. A bull market in 1870 boosted investor&#x27;s confidence and eight of the original 24 brokers joined again to re-establish the TSE. The exchange was incorporated by an act of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario in 1878.

The TSE grew continuously in size and in shares traded, save for a three-month period in 1914 when the exchange was shut down for fear of financial panic due to World War I. The day of the Wall Street crash of 1929, Toronto&#x27;s exchange was better connected to New York&#x27;s and received the bad news before Montreal&#x27;s (prior to 1931, exchanges communicated via telephone or by brokers&#x27; private wires, as they were not yet interconnected by ticker). By the afternoon, its three most popular stocks were down by at least 8%: International Nickel, Hiram Walker &amp; Sons and Brazilian Light &amp; Power. The following day, a record number of 331,000 shares changed hands on the TSE, with an overall loss of value of 20% (in Montreal, 525,000 shares and 25% loss).

Meanwhile, a British Columbia gold rush in the 1890s stimulated the demand for start-up capital but Montreal and Toronto&#x27;s exchanges deemed the ventures too risky. The boom was handled with the Toronto Stock and Mining Exchange, founded in 1896 and which merged with its rival Standard Stock and Mining Exchange in 1899. The SSME, after years of ups and downs, was amalgamated into the Toronto Stock Exchange in 1934. While a durable surge in mining trading was recorded in Toronto (either securities) or other publicly listed assets, in Montreal the volume of the equity-centric market was going down. Toronto found itself a reputation as a financial centre for mining and from 1934, the total trading volume on the TSE surpassed that of Montreal&#x27;s.

===A major exchange===
The TSE moved on Bay Street in 1913 and in 1937 opened a new trading floor and headquarters in an Art Deco building, still on Bay. By 1936, the Toronto Stock Exchange grew to become the third largest in North America.

In 1977, it launched the TSE 300 index and introduced the CATS (Computer Assisted Trading System), an automated trading system, and began to use it for the quotation of less liquid equities. In 1983, the TSE vacated its Art Deco headquarters on Bay Street and moved into the Exchange Tower. The old TSE building later became the Design Exchange, a museum and education centre. On April 23, 1997, the TSE&#x27;s trading floor closed, making it the second-largest stock exchange in North America to choose a floorless, electronic (or virtual trading) environment.

In 1999, through a major realignment plan, Toronto Stock Exchange became Canada&#x27;s sole exchange for the trading of senior equities. The Bourse de Montréal/Montreal Exchange assumed responsibility for the trading of derivatives and the Vancouver Stock Exchange and Alberta Stock Exchange merged to form the Canadian Venture Exchange (CDNX) handling trading in junior equities. The Canadian Dealing Network, Winnipeg Stock Exchange, and equities portion of the Montreal Exchange later merged with CDNX. In 2000, the Toronto Stock Exchange became a for-profit company. In 2002 its acronym was rebranded to TSX and it became a public company.

===TMX Group era===
In 2001, the Toronto Stock Exchange acquired the Canadian Venture Exchange, which was renamed the TSX Venture Exchange in 2002; this resulted in the creation of a parent to the TSX, the TSX Group. This ended 123 years of the usage of TSE as a Canadian stock exchange. On May 11, 2007, the S&amp;P/TSX Composite, the main index of the Toronto Stock Exchange, traded above the 14,000 point level for the first time ever. On December 17, 2008, for the first time in TSX history, the exchange was closed for an entire trading day due to a technical glitch.

On February 9, 2011, the London Stock Exchange announced that it had agreed to merge with the TMX Group, Toronto Stock Exchange&#x27;s parent, hoping to create a combined entity with a market capitalization of $5.9 trillion (£3.7 trillion). Xavier Rolet, who is CEO of the LSE Group, would have headed the new enlarged company, while TMX Chief Executive Thomas Kloet would become the new firm president. Based on data from December 30, 2010 the new stock exchange would have been the second largest in the world with a market cap 48% greater than the Nasdaq. Eight of the 15 board members of the combined entity were to be appointed by LSE, 7/15 by TMX. The provisional name for the combined group would be LTMX Group plc. About two weeks after Maple Group launched a competing bid the LSEG-TMX deal was terminated after failing to receive the minimum 67% voter approval from shareholders of TMX Group. The rejection came amidst new concerns raised by Bank of Canada governor Mark Carney regarding foreign control of clearing systems and opposition to the deal by Ontario&#x27;s finance minister. On June 13, 2011, a rival and hostile bid from the Canadian-based Maple Group took place. The bid was for up to CAD$3.7 billion in cash and shares, in the hope of preventing a takeover of TMX by the LSEG Group. The group included leading Canadian banks and financial institutions. In March 2015, a competing exchange, Aequitas Neo, opened for trading, listing 45 issues that were only listed on the TSX. The new exchange aimed to focus on fairness, particularly in relation to what it referred to as &quot;predatory high-frequency trading practices&quot;. The exchange planned to list additional TSX-listed securities. On May 27, 2014, TMX Group officially opened financial operations in Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia under the name TSX Financial..

==Operations==
The exchange has a normal trading session from 09:30am to 04:00pm ET and a post-market session from 4:15pm to 5:00pm ET on all days of the week except Saturdays, Sundays and holidays declared by the Exchange in advance.

===Companies listed===


 the Toronto Stock Exchange had 1,811 listed issuers (including ETFs and other structured financial products) with a combined market capitalization of CAD $4.16 trillion. Up from 1,798 listed issuers and a combined market capitalization of CAD $4.0 trillion as of March 2023. By the end of January 2024, the total market capitalization of companies listed on TSX &amp; TSXV reached CAD $4.23 trillion.

The exchange is home to all of Canada&#x27;s Big Five commercial banks—Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC), Bank of Montreal (BMO), Bank of Nova Scotia (Scotiabank), Royal Bank of Canada (RBC), and the Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD)—making the exchange the centre for banking in the country. This was seen as being most evident during the proposed mergers of Royal Bank with Bank of Montreal, and CIBC with the Toronto-Dominion Bank in 1998. Then-Finance Minister Paul Martin blocked the mergers to preserve competition.

The exchange is the primary listing for a number of energy companies including; Enbridge, Suncor, TC Energy, Canadian Natural Resources, Imperial Oil, Pembina and Cenovus all within the S&amp;P/TSX 60 index.

Many of the large companies listed on the TSX, especially those on the S&amp;P/TSX 60 index, have a secondary listing on an American exchange such as the New York Stock Exchange.

<text>Enfuvirtide (INN), sold under the brand name Fuzeon, is an HIV fusion inhibitor, the first of a class of antiretroviral drugs used in combination therapy for the treatment of AIDS/HIV.

== Medical uses ==
Enfuvirtide is indicated for the treatment of HIV-1 infection, in combination therapy with other antiretrovirals, in people where all other treatments have failed.

==Adverse effects==
Common adverse drug reactions (≥1% of patients) associated with enfuvirtide therapy include: injection site reactions (pain, hardening of skin, erythema, nodules, cysts, itch; experienced by nearly all patients, particularly in the first week), peripheral neuropathy, insomnia, depression, cough, dyspnoea, anorexia, arthralgia, infections (including bacterial pneumonia) and/or eosinophilia. Various hypersensitivity reactions occur infrequently (0.1–1% of patients), symptoms of which include rash, fever, nausea, vomiting, chills, rigors, hypotension, elevated hepatic transaminases; and possibly more severe reactions including respiratory distress, glomerulonephritis and/or anaphylaxis – rechallenge is not recommended.

==Pharmacology==

===Mechanism of action===
Enfuvirtide works by disrupting the HIV-1 molecular machinery at the final stage of fusion with the target cell, preventing uninfected cells from becoming infected. A biomimetic peptide, enfuvirtide was designed to mimic components of the HIV-1 fusion machinery and displace them, preventing normal fusion. Drugs that disrupt fusion of virus and target cell are termed entry inhibitors or fusion inhibitors.

HIV binds to the host CD4+ cell receptor via the viral protein gp120; gp41, a viral transmembrane protein, then undergoes a conformational change that assists in the fusion of the viral membrane to the host cell membrane. Enfuvirtide binds to gp41 preventing the creation of an entry pore for the capsid of the virus, keeping it out of the cell.

Enfuvirtide is also an activator of the chemotactic factor receptor, formyl peptide receptor 1, and thereby activates phagocytes and presumably other cells bearing this receptor (see formyl peptide receptors). The physiological significance of this activation is unknown.

===Microbiology===
Enfuvirtide is considered to be active against HIV-1 only. Low activity against HIV-2 isolates has been demonstrated &quot;in vitro&quot;.

Variable susceptibility to enfuvirtide has been observed in clinical isolates, with acquired resistance the result of a mutated 10 amino acid motif in viral gp41. Primary resistance, however, has yet to be observed.

===Structural formula===
Enfuvirtide is a 36-amino acid peptide with the following sequence:

CH3CO-Tyr-Thr-Ser-Leu-Ile-His-Ser-Leu-Ile-Glu-Glu-Ser-Gln-Asn-Gln-Gln-Glu-Lys-Asn-Glu-Gln-Glu-Leu-Leu-Glu-Leu-Asp-Lys-Trp-Ala-Ser-Leu-Trp-Asn-Trp-Phe-NH2 (Ac-YTSLIHSLIEESQNQQEKNEQELLELDKWASLWNWF-NH2)

==History==
Enfuvirtide originated at Duke University, where researchers formed a pharmaceutical company known as Trimeris. Trimeris began development on enfuvirtide in 1996 and initially designated it T-20. In 1999, Trimeris entered into partnership with Hoffmann-La Roche to complete the development of the drug. It was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on 13 March 2003 as the first HIV fusion inhibitor, a new class of antiretroviral drugs. It was approved on the basis of two studies which compared the effect of optimized regimens of antiretroviral medication with and without the addition of enfuvirtide on serum viral load.

<text>TMX Group Limited is a Canadian financial services company that operates equities, fixed income, derivatives, and energy markets exchanges. The company provides services encompassing listings, trading, clearing, settling and depository facilities, information services as well as technology services for the international financial community.

TMX Group is best known for its stock exchanges, Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX), which serves the senior equity markets, and TSX Venture Exchange (TSXV), which serves the public venture equity market. TSXV was formerly known as the Canadian Venture Exchange (CDNX), but it also owns and operates other exchanges in Canada, including Montréal Exchange and TSX Alpha Exchange, as well as the country&#x27;s depository, clearing and settlement business, CDS. TMX Group also owns and operates TMX Equity Transfer Services, Shorcan Brokers Limited, the Canadian Derivatives Clearing Corporation (CDCC), as well as stakes in both CanDeal.ca Inc. and BOX Options Exchange. Other notable subsidiaries of TMX Group include Trayport Limited, the developer of the Joule electronic trading platform for energy markets, and TMX Datalinx, which provides data products and services.

TMX Group is headquartered in Toronto and operates offices across Canada (Montreal, Calgary and Vancouver), in key U.S. markets (New York City, Houston, Boston and Chicago), and overseas (London, Beijing, Singapore and Sydney).

==History==
In 2001, the Toronto Stock Exchange acquired the Canadian Venture Exchange (formed by the merger of the Vancouver Stock Exchange and Alberta Stock Exchange on November 29, 1999), which was renamed the TSX Venture Exchange on July 31, 2001. The acquisition was carried out through a parent company, TSX Group Inc.

The Montreal Exchange was acquired on December 10, 2007, for C$1.31 Billion. The acquisition was completed on May 1, 2008, and the corporation subsequently renamed to TMX Group Inc.

On June 11, 2008, at a meeting of shareholders of TSX Group Inc, a resolution to change the name of the corporation to TMX Group Inc. was put forward. The formal vote for the deal took place in September.

On February 9, 2011, the London Stock Exchange Group announced that they had agreed to merge with the TMX, creating a combined entity with a market capitalization of $5.9 billion (£3.7 billion). Xavier Rolet, CEO of the LSE Group, will head the company, while TMX Chief Executive Thomas Kloet will become president. Based on data from November 30, 2010, the new stock exchange would be the second largest in the world with a market cap 47% greater than the Nasdaq. Announced on June 1, 2011, the provisional name for the combined group would be LTMX Group plc.

On June 13, 2011, a rival bid from the &quot;Maple Group&quot; of Canadian interests, was unveiled: a cash and stock bid of $3.7 billion CAD, in hopes of blocking the LSE Group&#x27;s takeover of TMX. The group is composed of the leading banks and financial institutions of Canada. Luc Bertrand, spokesman for Maple Group and one of the drivers of the bid, is vice chairman of the National Bank of Canada and also TMX Group&#x27;s largest individual shareholder.

On June 22, 2011, the LSE Group and TMX agreed to pay a special dividend to shareholders. The special dividend is meant to sway voters away from Maple Group&#x27;s rival bid. The dividend was valued at $678 million, with TMX shareholders receiving $4 per share and LSE shareholders receiving $1.36 per share. Including the special dividend, the LSE agreement would be valued at $48.90 per share versus the $48 per share of Maple. The exchanges also pledged to maintain the dividend at least as high as the current TMX annual payout, which is C$1.60 a share.

On June 29, LSEG and TMX terminated the merger plans after it appeared that the merger would not be approved by the needed two-thirds majority of TMX shareholders.

On July 11, 2012, Maple Group&#x27;s deal was approved by all federal and provincial regulatory authorities, including the Ontario Securities Commission and the Autorité des marchés financiers.

On July 31, 2012, Maple Group announced that it won control of the TMX Group, as 91% of shares were tendered for its takeover offer. The formal vote for the deal will take place in September.

On January 21, 2013, TMX Group announced that combined, Toronto Stock Exchange and TSX Venture Exchange were first in the world among global exchanges by number of new listings for the fourth consecutive year, according to data from the World Federation of Exchanges (WFE) as of December 31, 2012.

<text>Seattle Pacific University (SPU) is a private Christian university in Seattle, Washington, United States. It was founded in 1891 in conjunction with the Oregon and Washington Conference of the Free Methodist Church as the Seattle Seminary. It became the Seattle Seminary and College in 1913, adopted the name Seattle Pacific College two years later, and received its current name in 1977.

==History==
Seattle Pacific University was founded in 1891 by Free Methodist pioneers to train missionaries for overseas service. Built on land donated by Mr. and Mrs. Nels B. Peterson, the neighborhood was originally known as Ross Station and was annexed to Seattle the same year the college was founded; the school was colloquially referred to as the Ross Seminary during this era. The first permanent building built on campus, designed by notable architect John B. Parkinson, was completed in early 1893 and the seminary held its first classes that Spring.
On June 5, 2014, a shooting occurred in the Otto Miller Hall, during which one student was killed and two other students were injured. The suspect was not a student at the school and had no connection to the university. On November 16, 2016, the gunman was convicted in the shooting and sentenced to 112 years in prison.

In May 2022, the university&#x27;s board of trustees voted to keep rules in place that ban LGBTQ people from becoming employees, prompting student protests. The vote by the board of trustees occurred in wake of faculty voting with an 80% majority no-confidence in the board regarding this issue. Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson announced on July 29 that his office was investigating the university&#x27;s hiring practices, describing them as potentially illegal and discriminatory. In turn, the university filed a lawsuit against the attorney general, saying that the investigation violates its religious freedom.

On January 26, 2023 it was announced that current Roberts Wesleyan University President Deanna Porterfield would conclude her work in June at the institution in Rochester, NY. She assumed the role of President at Seattle Pacific University later on in 2023.

On June 16, 2023, the university&#x27;s interim president, Peter Menjares, announced in an email to faculty that it would cut 40 percent of its budget academic programs via steep faculty layoffs; university leadership blamed post-COVID-19 pandemic national trends in higher education for declining enrollment, while faculty blamed the university&#x27;s anti-LGBTQ+ faculty policy for exacerbating the issue. The cuts are due to take effect upon the expiration of contracts the following June.

=== Previous names ===
As the school developed from a seminary of the Free Methodist Church to its current status as a doctoral degree granting institution, its name has changed over time to befit its changes in status:

*1891 – Seattle Seminary
*1913 – Seattle Seminary and College
*1915 – Seattle Pacific College/Seattle Pacific Christian College
*1977 – Seattle Pacific University

==Academics==


The university&#x27;s academic programs are divided into one college and five schools:
*College of Arts and Sciences
*School of Business, Government, and Economics
*School of Education
*School of Health Sciences
*School of Psychology, Family and Community
*School of Theology

===Honors program===
SPU offers a four-year alternate series of general education classes for honors students called University Scholars, in which every student double-majors, earning a major in &quot;Honors: Liberal Arts&quot; as well as another major of their choice. Their Honors coursework involves classes centering the question &quot;What does it mean to be human?&quot;, on cultural and social systems, ethics and critical reasoning, and history; by their senior year Honors students write senior research thesis. Along with the preliminary core classes, the curriculum includes two Faith &amp; Science classes and a Christianity &amp; Scholarship class. The work load is generally very rigorous.

A student in the program takes his or her sequence of University Scholars courses with the same cohort of 40 students for the entire four years. A student may be admitted to the program regardless of major. There are no University Scholars classes scheduled for the fall of junior year so students have the opportunity to study abroad.

===Graduate school===
In 2005, SPU launched a MFA low-residency program in Creative Writing featuring distance-learning for graduate writers in Poetry, Fiction, Creative Non-Fiction, and Young Adult Fiction. The program features a site-specific residency on Whidbey Island, WA. Core faculty include several notable authors including Scott Cairns, Lauren Winner, Gina Ochsner, Sara Zarr, and Mischa Willett. The program maintains an institutional affiliation with &quot;Image&quot;.

==Campus==

The university sits on a 43-acre campus at the northern end of Queen Anne Hill, near the Fremont neighborhood and approximately four miles north of downtown Seattle. Many of the trees on the campus&#x27; central Tiffany Loop are among the oldest in the city. SPU also owns and operates two satellite campuses: a wilderness field station specializing in biology on Blakely Island in the San Juan Islands and Camp Casey, a former U.S. military fort re-purposed as a conference and retreat facility on Whidbey Island. Notable buildings on the Seattle campus include:

===Alexander and Adelaide Hall===
Named for the first president of Seattle Pacific University, Alexander Beers, this four-story brick building is home to the School of Theology. The founder&#x27;s first name, Alexander, was used, as the board did not want a building on campus called &quot;Beers Hall.&quot; The building also houses the Sociology and History departments within the College of Arts and Sciences. Completed in early 1893, Alexander Hall is the oldest building on campus, and at the time of the university&#x27;s founding was the campus&#x27; only building. It was designed by notable architect John B. Parkinson, who was responsible for the designs of many of Seattle&#x27;s school buildings built during this era. Upon completion of Peterson Hall in 1905, it was used for a time as a boys dormitory. A $6.2-million A seismic retrofitting and renovation of the interior office space and chapel was completed in 2014. Next door to Alexander is the main performing arts space on campus, the McKinley Theater.

===Demaray Hall/Clocktower===
Demaray Hall is the central academic building at Seattle Pacific University, housing numerous classrooms as well as the Office of Undergraduate Admissions, Student Academic Services and Student Financial Services. Administrative offices, including the offices of the president and provost, are also located in Demaray. The building is named for Calvin Dorr Demaray, president of SPU from 1959 to 1968 and pastor of First Free Methodist Church, from 1948 to 1959.

The clocktower in front of Demaray Hall was given to Seattle Pacific University by the class of 1966. It displays a bas-relief sculpture designed by former Professor of Art Ernst Schwidder, titled &quot;Science, Religion and Humanities,&quot; which was brought to fruition by former Professor of Art Larry Metcalf and three of his students. The cast-stone relief panels depict various areas of study: the physical sciences, social sciences and humanities. Its symbols are drawn from American Pima, Arabic, Aztec, Babylonian, Egyptian and Greek cultures.

===Gwinn Commons===

Gwinn Commons is home to three different points of interest. The Crossroads at Gwinn Commons is the main dining hall on campus. Upstairs is the university&#x27;s main, multi-use location. A pair of large rooms, the Queen Anne Room (named after the neighborhood in which SPU is located) and the Cascade Room (named after the mountain range that can be seen from Upper Gwinn Commons) can each hold up to 500 people. Multiple functions are held in Upper Gwinn, ranging from Group (a Wednesday night worship service), admissions events, lectures, board meetings and more. The President&#x27;s Dining room is also located here. In addition, there is the Corner Place Market, or C-Store, which holds Einstein Bros. Bagels and also a market where students can purchase various daily necessities. Wells Gwinn, for whom the dining facility is named, served 32 years on the Seattle Pacific Board of Trustees.

=== Ames Library ===

The Ames Library was completed in 1994. Housing over 250,000 volumes and 1,300 print periodicals, it grows by 6,000 new titles a year. Students, faculty, and alumni have access to the collections of Summit and the Orbis Cascade Alliance, comprising over 30 million items held in Washington and Oregon academic libraries, including the University of Washington. In addition to printed reference materials, the library also has access to myriad electronic databases including JSTOR, ProQuest Direct, EBSCOHost, First Search, and others. Access is available to the university community via login both on and off campus.
===Peterson Hall===

Opened in 1905, Peterson Hall is the second-oldest building on campus and houses the School of Education as well as the Department of Family and Consumer Sciences. Originally built to house administration and additional classrooms, it was designed by Seattle architect William Jewett. In the basement is a food lab, as well as a sewing lab. Each month, SPU&#x27;s food lab plays host to a Community Kitchen - an outreach to the city&#x27;s homeless population wherein these individuals join with members of the university community in cooking and sharing a common meal.

===Student Union Building===
The Student Union Building (commonly known as the &quot;SUB&quot;) was built in the 1960s and still serves as a central point where many students gather. On the first floor is the Pacific Collegium, a hub for commuter students. Dining options provided by the on campus dining services can also be found in the SUB. UNICOM, a student-run information desk assists with ticket sales, bus passes, pool passes, among other general information items. ASSP, the student government of SPU has its offices in the SUB along with STUB, the student event programming organization.

===Philip W. and Sharon K. Eaton Hall===
SPU&#x27;s main hard sciences facility houses biology, chemistry and some psychology labs. Built in 2003, it is the most advanced building on campus, complete with an electron microscope, cold room, fully contained greenhouse and LEED Certification. This building is central to those students in the Pre-Professional Health Sciences programs. SPU&#x27;s pre-med track has become widely known for its annual 90–100% acceptance into medical schools following graduation. On May 23, 2012, the SPU Board of Trustees announced that it named the building in honor of past SPU president Philip W.Eaton and his wife, Sharon.

=== McKenna Hall ===

The School of Business, Government, and Economics (SBGE) is located in McKenna Hall. In addition to undergraduate degrees in management, accounting, economics, political science, and global development studies, SBGE also offers three graduate level degrees: Master of Business Administration, Master of Science in Information Management, and a Master of Arts in management. SBGE is home to the Center for Applied Learning and the Center for Integrity in Business which examines the intersections of theology and contemporary business.

===Residences===
Seattle Pacific University has five residence halls. The university offers other on-campus residence options, such as the Cremona and Wesley apartments, and other small suite- or apartment-style living facilities for continuing students. All residence halls feature single-gender floors. The five residence halls are Ashton Hall, Hill Hall, Moyer Hall, Emerson Hall, and Arnett Hall.

Freshmen are required to live on campus in the residence halls unless they are living with family. Meal plans are required for all students living in the dorms. Students may leave campus housing when they are 20 years old, have junior class status, have petitioned and been approved to live off campus by Campus Housing, or are graduate students.

Arnett Hall welcomed its inaugural residents in Autumn 2014. As SPU&#x27;s second smallest dorm with only four resident floors, it features suite-style single, double, and triple rooms, a main lounge on the first floor, and a green roof and roof deck on the fifth floor. Rooms on the upper floors may also feature views of the Lake Washington Ship Canal. It is located in the northwest corner of campus, just across the street from Demaray Hall and just down the hill from Gwinn Commons, SPU&#x27;s dining hall.

Ashton Hall, opened in 1965, is SPU&#x27;s largest residence hall with more than 400 students on 6 floors. It was named in honor of Philip F. Ashton, PhD, a psychology professor (1929–1971). The hall is located on the highest point of SPU&#x27;s campus. Many rooms have views of the campus and the Lake Washington Ship Canal. Annual Ashton Pop events include the Ashton Cup lip-sync contest, the Ashton Art Show, and a formal ball. In previous years the ball has been held at the Space Needle, on an Argosy Cruise, and at Seattle&#x27;s W Hotel. Ashton Hall is also former home to the Orangemen of 6th West (6w), a notable floor on campus, who display their school spirit by attending men&#x27;s basketball home games and some away games, leading cheers for the Falcons and occasionally against the referees and the other team.
Emerson Hall, opened in 2001, is the campus&#x27;s second newest residence hall, featuring suite-style single, double, and triple rooms, card-access security, a main lounge with gas fireplace and Northwest wood beams, and an exercise center. Emerson also has a &quot;Bridges Program&quot;, which lets students participate in intentional programs and conversations related to global issues and cross-cultural relationships. Emerson events include a quarterly Coffee House, the Emerson Film Festival, and the Spring Banquet. The hall is named for the street on which it resides.

Hill Hall, which opened in 1962, located in the upper middle of the campus just steps from Gwinn Commons and the SPU Library, is known as the &quot;family&quot; hall for its comfortable atmosphere. It features a newly updated main lounge, the REX athletic center, and the Hill Hall &quot;beach&quot;, a grassy area behind the hall popular for outdoor recreation and sunbathing. Hill Hall events include &quot;Decade&quot; Skate (a song-based skit competition), a retreat to Camp Casey, an annual ball, and 6th Hill &quot;Beach Bash.&quot; It is named for the Reuben Hill family who donated property to the school for its expansion.

Moyer Hall, opened in 1953 and remodeled in 1983, is located in the center of the campus on the edge of Tiffany Loop. The smallest of the traditional residence halls, Moyer was named in honor of Jacob Moyer, PhD, professor of chemistry and dean (1925–46). The hall&#x27;s annual events include a fall retreat, an ice-broomball game, a citywide scavenger hunt, and an all-hall banquet. In the past, the ice-broomball game was played between residents of Moyer and Marston Hall (no longer used for housing). This annual &quot;Toilet Bowl&quot; match featured as its trophy a urinal removed from Moyer during the 1983 remodel, which the losing hall was required to display prominently the year following their loss. The 05–06 school year also introduced a new event called The Experience Moyer Project (EMP), which featured musical talent from the hall as well as a variety of other activities.

The university owns multiple additional residences including Bailey, Cremona, 37 West Dravus, Falcon, Wesley and other buildings known by address rather than name are owned and maintained by SPU. These apartments are closer to campus but provide a more independent-living situation. They provide a great aggregate living environment among students. The 35 and 34 West Cremona apartments were remodeled in 2008–09 and 2009–10, respectively, and the Wesley Apartments at Cremona and Dravus, as of the 2011–2012 academic year, are now owned and operated by SPU and include the offices of two of the Residence Life Coordinators. The school sold the Robbins apartments in 2012.

<text>Highway engineering (also known as roadway engineering and street engineering) is a professional engineering discipline branching from the civil engineering subdiscipline of transportation engineering that involves the planning, design, construction, operation, and maintenance of roads, highways, streets, bridges, and tunnels to ensure safe and effective transportation of people and goods. Highway engineering became prominent towards the latter half of the 20th century after World War II. Standards of highway engineering are continuously being improved. Highway engineers must take into account future traffic flows, design of highway intersections/interchanges, geometric alignment and design, highway pavement materials and design, structural design of pavement thickness, and pavement maintenance.

==History==
The beginning of road construction could be dated to the time of the Romans. With the advancement of technology from carriages pulled by two horses to vehicles with power equivalent to 100 horses, road development had to follow suit. The construction of modern highways did not begin until the late 19th to early 20th century.

The first research dedicated to highway engineering was initiated in the United Kingdom with the introduction of the Transport Research Laboratory (TRL), in 1930. In the US, highway engineering became an important discipline with the passing of the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1944, which aimed to connect 90% of cities with a population of 50,000 or more. With constant stress from vehicles which grew larger as time passed, improvements to pavements were needed. With technology out of date, in 1958 the construction of the first motorway in Great Britain (the Preston bypass) played a major role in the development of new pavement technology.

==Planning and development==
Highway planning involves the estimation of current and future traffic volumes on a road network. The Highway planning is also a basic need for the Highway development. Highway engineers strive to predict and analyze all possible civil impacts of highway systems. Some considerations are the adverse effects on the environment, such as noise pollution, air pollution, water pollution, and other ecological impacts.

===Financing===
Developed countries are constantly faced with high maintenance cost of aging transportation highways. The growth of the motor vehicle industry and accompanying economic growth has generated a demand for safer, better performing, less congested highways. The growth of commerce, educational institutions, housing, and defense have largely drawn from government budgets in the past, making the financing of public highways a challenge.

The multipurpose characteristics of highways, economic environment, and the advances in highway pricing technology are constantly changing. Therefore, the approaches to highway financing, management, and maintenance are constantly changing as well.

===Environmental impact assessment===
The economic growth of a community is dependent upon highway development to enhance mobility. However, improperly planned, designed, constructed, and maintained highways can disrupt the social and economic characteristics of any size community. Common adverse impacts to highway development include damage of habitat and bio-diversity, creation of air and water pollution, noise and vibration generation, damage of natural landscape, and the destruction of a community&#x27;s social and cultural structure. Highway infrastructure must be constructed and maintained to high qualities and standards.

There are three key steps for integrating environmental considerations into the planning, scheduling, construction, and maintenance of highways. This process is known as an Environmental Impact Assessment, or EIA, as it systematically deals with the following elements:

* Identification of the full range of possible impacts on the natural and socio-economic environment
* Evaluation and quantification of these impacts
* Formulation of measures to avoid, mitigate, and compensate for the anticipated impacts.

===Highway safety===
Highway systems generate the highest price in human injury and death, as nearly 50 million persons are injured in traffic accidents every year, not including the 1.2 million deaths. Road traffic injury is the single leading cause of unintentional death in the first five decades of human life.
Management of safety is a systematic process that strives to reduce the occurrence and severity of traffic accidents. The man/machine interaction with road traffic systems is unstable and poses a challenge to highway safety management. The key for increasing the safety of highway systems is to design, build, and maintain them to be far more tolerant of the average range of this man/machine interaction with highways. Technological advancements in highway engineering have improved the design, construction, and maintenance methods used over the years. These advancements have allowed for newer highway safety innovations.

By ensuring that all situations and opportunities are identified, considered, and implemented as appropriate, they can be evaluated in every phase of highway planning, design, construction, maintenance, and operation to increase the safety of our highway systems.

==Design==

The most appropriate location, alignment, and shape of a highway are selected during the design stage. Highway design involves the consideration of three major factors (human, vehicular, and roadway) and how these factors interact to provide a safe highway. Human factors include reaction time for braking and steering, visual acuity for traffic signs and signals, and car-following behaviour. Vehicle considerations include vehicle size and dynamics that are essential for determining lane width and maximum slopes, and for the selection of design vehicles. Highway engineers design road geometry to ensure stability of vehicles when negotiating curves and grades and to provide adequate sight distances for undertaking passing maneuvers along curves on two-lane, two-way roads.

===Geometric design===

Highway and transportation engineers must meet many safety, service, and performance standards when designing highways for certain site topography. Highway geometric design primarily refers to the visible elements of the highways. Highway engineers who design the geometry of highways must also consider environmental and social effects of the design on the surrounding infrastructure.

There are certain considerations that must be properly addressed in the design process to successfully fit a highway to a site&#x27;s topography and maintain its safety. Some of these design considerations are:
* Design speed
* Design traffic volume
* Number of lanes
* Level of service (LOS)
* Sight distance
* Alignment, super-elevation, and grades
* Cross section
* Lane width
* Structure gauge, Horizontal and vertical clearance

The operational performance of a highway can be seen through drivers&#x27; reactions to the design considerations and their interaction.

===Materials===
The materials used for roadway construction have progressed with time, dating back to the early days of the Roman Empire. Advancements in methods with which these materials are characterized and applied to pavement structural design has accompanied this advancement in materials.

There are three major types of pavement surfaces - pavement quality concrete (PQC), Portland cement concrete (PCC) and hot-mix asphalt (HMA). Underneath this wearing course are material layers that give structural support for the pavement system. These underlying surfaces may include either the aggregate base and sub base layers, or treated base and sub base layers, and additionally the underlying natural or treated sub grade. These treated layers may be cement-treated, asphalt-treated, or lime-treated for additional support. New Material

===Flexible pavement design===

A flexible, or asphalt, or Tarmac pavement typically consists of three or four layers. For a four layer flexible pavement, there is a surface course, base course, and subbase course constructed over a compacted, natural soil subgrade. When building a three layer flexible pavement, the subbase layer is not used and the base course is placed directly on the natural subgrade.

A flexible pavement&#x27;s surface layer is constructed of hot-mix asphalt (HMA).Unstabilized aggregates are typically used for the base course; however, the base course could also be stabilized with asphalt, Foamed Bitumen,&lt;Roadstone Recycling&gt; Portland cement, or another stabilizing agent. The subbase is generally constructed from local aggregate material, while the top of the subgrade is often stabilized with cement or lime.

With flexible pavement, the highest stress occurs at the surface and the stress decreases as the depth of the pavement increases. Therefore, the highest quality material needs to be used for the surface, while lower quality materials can be used as the depth of the pavement increases. The term &quot;flexible&quot; is used because of the asphalts ability to bend and deform slightly, then return to its original position as each traffic load is applied and removed. It is possible for these small deformations to become permanent, which can lead to rutting in the wheel path over an extended time.

The service life of a flexible pavement is typically designed in the range of 20 to 30 years. Required thicknesses of each layer of a flexible pavement vary widely depending on the materials used, magnitude, number of repetitions of traffic loads, environmental conditions, and the desired service life of the pavement. Factors such as these are taken into consideration during the design process so that the pavement will last for the designed life without excessive distresses.

===Rigid pavement design===
Rigid pavements are generally used in constructing airports and major highways, such as those in the interstate highway system. In addition, they commonly serve as heavy-duty industrial floor slabs, port and harbor yard pavements, and heavy-vehicle park or terminal pavements. Like flexible pavements, rigid highway pavements are designed as all-weather, long-lasting structures to serve modern day high-speed traffic. Offering high quality riding surfaces for safe vehicular travel, they function as structural layers to distribute vehicular wheel loads in such a manner that the induced stresses transmitted to the subgrade soil are of acceptable magnitudes.

Portland cement concrete (PCC) is the most common material used in the construction of rigid pavement slabs. The reason for its popularity is due to its availability and the economy. Rigid pavements must be designed to endure frequently repeated traffic loadings. The typical designed service life of a rigid pavement is between 30 and 40 years, lasting about twice as long as a flexible pavement.

One major design consideration of rigid pavements is reducing fatigue failure due to the repeated stresses of traffic. Fatigue failure is common among major roads because a typical highway will experience millions of wheel passes throughout its service life. In addition to design criteria such as traffic loadings, tensile stresses due to thermal energy must also be taken into consideration. As pavement design has progressed, many highway engineers have noted that thermally induced stresses in rigid pavements can be just as intense as those imposed by wheel loadings. Due to the relatively low tensile strength of concrete, thermal stresses are extremely important to the design considerations of rigid pavements.

Rigid pavements are generally constructed in three layers - a prepared subgrade, base or subbase, and a concrete slab. The concrete slab is constructed according to a designed choice of plan dimensions for the slab panels, directly influencing the intensity of thermal stresses occurring within the pavement. In addition to the slab panels, temperature reinforcements must be designed to control cracking behavior in the slab. Joint spacing is determined by the slab panel dimensions.

Three main types of concrete pavements commonly used are jointed plain concrete pavement (JPCP), jointed reinforced concrete pavement (JRCP), and continuously reinforced concrete pavements (CRCP). JPCPs are constructed with contraction joints which direct the natural cracking of the pavement. These pavements do not use any reinforcing steel. JRCPs are constructed with both contraction joints and reinforcing steel to control the cracking of the pavement. High temperatures and moisture stresses within the pavement creates cracking, which the reinforcing steel holds tightly together. At transverse joints, dowel bars are typically placed to assist with transferring the load of the vehicle across the cracking. CRCPs solely rely on continuous reinforcing steel to hold the pavement&#x27;s natural transverse cracks together. Prestressed concrete pavements have also been used in the construction of highways; however, they are not as common as the other three. Prestressed pavements allow for a thinner slab thickness by partly or wholly neutralizing thermally induced stresses or loadings.

===Flexible pavement overlay design===
Over the service life of a flexible pavement, accumulated traffic loads may cause excessive rutting or cracking, inadequate ride quality, or an inadequate skid resistance. These problems can be avoided by adequately maintaining the pavement, but the solution usually has excessive maintenance costs, or the pavement may have an inadequate structural capacity for the projected traffic loads.

Throughout a highway&#x27;s life, its level of serviceability is closely monitored and maintained. One common method used to maintain a highway&#x27;s level of serviceability is to place an overlay on the pavement&#x27;s surface.

There are three general types of overlay used on flexible pavements: asphalt-concrete overlay, Portland cement concrete overlay, and ultra-thin Portland cement concrete overlay. The concrete layer in a conventional PCC overlay is placed unbonded on top of the flexible surface. The typical thickness of an ultra-thin PCC overlay is 4 inches (10 cm) or less.

There are two main categories of flexible pavement overlay design procedures:
*Component analysis design
*Deflection-based design

===Rigid pavement overlay design===
Near the end of a rigid pavement&#x27;s service life, a decision must be made to either fully reconstruct the worn pavement, or construct an overlay layer. Considering an overlay can be constructed on a rigid pavement that has not reached the end of its service life, it is often more economically attractive to apply overlay layers more frequently. The required overlay thickness for a structurally sound rigid pavement is much smaller than for one that has reached the end of its service life. Rigid and flexible overlays are both used for rehabilitation of rigid pavements such as JPCP, JRCP, and CRCP.

There are three subcategories of rigid pavement overlays that are organized depending on the bonding condition at the pavement overlay and existing slab interface.
*Bonded overlays
*Unbonded overlays
*Partially bonded overlays

===Drainage system design===

Designing for proper drainage of highway systems is crucial to their success. A highway should be graded and built to remain &quot;high and dry&quot;. Regardless of how well other aspects of a road are designed and constructed, adequate drainage is mandatory for a road to survive its entire service life. Excess water in the highway structure can inevitably lead to premature failure, even if the failure is not catastrophic.

Each highway drainage system is site-specific and can be very complex. Depending on the geography of the region, many methods for proper drainage may not be applicable. The highway engineer must determine which situations a particular design process should be applied, usually a combination of several appropriate methods and materials to direct water away from the structure. Pavement subsurface drainage, and underdrains help provide extended life and excellent and reliable pavement performance. Excessive moisture under a concrete pavement can cause pumping, cracking, and joint failure.

Erosion control is a crucial component in the design of highway drainage systems. Surface drainage must be allowed for precipitation to drain away from the structure. Highways must be designed with a slope or crown so that runoff water will be directed to the shoulder of the road, into a ditch, and away from the site. Designing a drainage system requires the prediction of runoff and infiltration, open channel analysis, and culvert design for directing surface water to an appropriate location.

==Construction, maintenance, and management==

===Highway construction===
Highway construction is generally preceded by detailed surveys and subgrade preparation. The methods and technology for constructing highways has evolved over time and become increasingly sophisticated. This advancement in technology has raised the level of skill sets required to manage highway construction projects. This skill varies from project to project, depending on factors such as the project&#x27;s complexity and nature, the contrasts between new construction and reconstruction, and differences between urban region and rural region projects.

There are a number of elements of highway construction which can be broken up into technical and commercial elements of the system. Some examples of each are listed below:
* Technical elements
** Materials
** Material quality
** Installation techniques
** Traffic
* Commercial elements
** Contract understanding
** Environmental aspects
** Political aspects
** Legal aspects
** Public concerns

Typically, construction begins at the lowest elevation of the site, regardless of the project type, and moves upward. By reviewing the geotechnical specifications of the project, information is given about:
* Existing ground conditions
* Required equipment for excavation, grading, and material transportation to and from the site
* Properties of materials to be excavated
* Dewatering requirements necessary for below-grade work
* Shoring requirements for excavation protection
* Water quantities for compaction and dust control

====Subbase course construction====
A subbase course is a layer designed of carefully selected materials that is located between the subgrade and base course of the pavement. The subbase thickness is generally in the range of 4 to 16 inches, and it is designed to withstand the required structural capacity of the pavement section.

Common materials used for a highway subbase include gravel, crushed stone, or subgrade soil that is stabilized with cement, fly ash, or lime. Permeable subbase courses are becoming more prevalent because of their ability to drain infiltrating water from the surface. They also prevent subsurface water from reaching the pavement surface.

When local material costs are excessively expensive or the material requirements to increase the structural bearing of the sub-base are not readily available, highway engineers can increase the bearing capacity of the underlying soil by mixing in Portland cement, foamed asphalt, or use polymer soil stabilization such as cross-linking styrene acrylic polymer that increases the California Bearing Ratio of in-situ materials by a factor 4 – 6.

====Base course construction====
The base course is the region of the pavement section that is located directly under the surface course. If there is a subbase course, the base course is constructed directly about this layer. Otherwise, it is built directly on top of the subgrade. Typical base course thickness ranges from 4 to 6 inches and is governed by underlying layer properties.

Heavy loads are continuously applied to pavement surfaces, and the base layer absorbs the majority of these stresses. Generally, the base course is constructed with an untreated crushed aggregate such as crushed stone, slag, or gravel. The base course material will have stability under the construction traffic and good drainage characteristics.

The base course materials are often treated with cement, bitumen, calcium chloride, sodium chloride, fly ash, or lime. These treatments provide improved support for heavy loads, frost susceptibility, and serves as a moisture barrier between the base and surface layers.

====Surface course construction====

There are two most commonly used types of pavement surfaces used in highway construction: hot-mix asphalt and Portland cement concrete. These pavement surface courses provide a smooth and safe riding surface, while simultaneously transferring the heavy traffic loads through the various base courses and into the underlying subgrade soils.

=====Hot-mix asphalt layers=====
Hot-mix asphalt surface courses are referred to as flexible pavements. The Superpave System was developed in the late 1980s and has offered changes to the design approach, mix design, specifications, and quality testing of materials.

The construction of an effective, long-lasting asphalt pavement requires an experienced construction crew, committed to their work quality and equipment control.

Construction issues:
* Asphalt mix segregation
* Laydown
* Compaction
* Joints

A prime coat is a low viscosity asphalt that is applied to the base course prior to laying the HMA surface course. This coat bonds loose material, creating a cohesive layer between the base course and asphalt surface.

A tack coat is a low viscosity asphalt emulsion that is used to create a bond between an existing pavement surface and new asphalt overlay. Tack coats are typically applied on adjacent pavements (curbs) to assist the bonding of the HMA and concrete.

=====Portland cement concrete (PCC)=====
Portland cement concrete surface courses are referred to as rigid pavements, or concrete pavements. There are three general classifications of concrete pavements - jointed plain, jointed reinforced, and continuously reinforced.

Traffic loadings are transferred between sections when larger aggregates in the PCC mix inter-lock together, or through load transfer devices in the transverse joints of the surface. Dowel bars are used as load-transferring devices to efficiently transfer loads across transverse joints while maintaining the joint&#x27;s horizontal and vertical alignment. Tie-bars are deformed steel bars that are placed along longitudinal joints to hold adjacent pavement sections in place.

===Highway maintenance===

The overall purpose of highway maintenance is to fix defects and preserve the pavement&#x27;s structure and serviceability. Defects must be defined, understood, and recorded in order to create an appropriate maintenance plan. Maintenance planning is solving an optimisation problem and it can be predictive. In predictive maintenance planning empirical, data-driven methods give more accurate results than mechanical models. Defects differ between flexible and rigid pavements.

There are four main objectives of highway maintenance:
* repair of functional pavement defects
* extend the functional and structural service life of the pavement
* maintain road safety and signage
* keep road reserve in acceptable condition

Through routine maintenance practices, highway systems and all of their components can be maintained to their original, as-built condition.

===Project management===
Project management involves the organization and structuring of project activities from inception to completion. Activities could be the construction of infrastructure such as highways and bridges or major and minor maintenance activities related to constructing such infrastructure. The entire project and involved activities must be handled in a professional manner and completed within deadlines and budget. In addition, minimizing social and environmental impacts is essential to successful project management.

<text>Pearl Zane Grey (January 31, 1872 – October 23, 1939) was an American author and dentist. He is known for his popular adventure novels and stories associated with the Western genre in literature and the arts; he idealized the American frontier. &quot;Riders of the Purple Sage&quot; (1912) was his best-selling book.

In addition to the success of his printed works, his books have second lives and continuing influence adapted for films and television. His novels and short stories were adapted into 112 films, two television episodes, and a television series, &quot;Dick Powell&#x27;s Zane Grey Theatre&quot;.

== Biography ==
=== Early life ===
Pearl Zane Grey was born January 31, 1872, in Zanesville, Ohio. His birth name may have originated from newspaper descriptions of Queen Victoria&#x27;s mourning clothes as &quot;pearl grey&quot;. He was the fourth of five children born to Alice &quot;Allie&quot; Josephine Zane, whose English Quaker immigrant ancestor Robert Zane came to the American colonies in 1673, and her husband, Lewis M. Gray, a dentist. His family changed the spelling of their last name to &quot;Grey&quot; after his birth. Grey later dropped &quot;Pearl&quot; and used &quot;Zane&quot; as his first name.

Grey grew up in Zanesville, a city founded by his paternal grandfather Benjamin Zane&#x27;s brother-in-law, John McIntire (husband of Sarah Zane), who had been given the land by Grey&#x27;s maternal great-grandfather, Ebenezer Zane, an American Revolutionary War patriot.

Both Grey and his brother Romer were active and athletic boys who were enthusiastic baseball players and fishermen. From an early age, he was intrigued by history. Soon, he developed an interest in writing. His early interests contributed to his later writing success. For example, his knowledge of history informed his first three novels, which recounted the heroism of ancestors who fought in the American Revolutionary War.

As a child, Grey frequently engaged in violent brawls, probably related to his father&#x27;s punishing him with severe beatings. Though irascible and asocial like his father, Grey was supported by a loving mother and found a father substitute. Muddy Miser was an old man who approved of Grey&#x27;s love of fishing and writing, and who talked about the advantages of an unconventional life. Despite warnings by Grey&#x27;s father to steer clear of Miser, the boy spent much time during five formative years in the company of the old man.

Grey was an avid reader of adventure stories such as &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot; and the &quot;Leatherstocking Tales&quot;, as well as dime novels featuring Buffalo Bill and Deadwood Dick. He was enthralled by and crudely copied the great illustrators Howard Pyle and Frederic Remington. He was particularly impressed with &quot;Our Western Border&quot;, a history of the Ohio frontier that likely inspired his earliest novels. Grey wrote his first story, &quot;Jim of the Cave&quot;, when he was fifteen. His father tore it to shreds and beat him.

Because of the shame he felt as the result of a severe financial setback in 1889 due to a poor investment, Lewis Grey moved his family from Zanesville and started again in Columbus, Ohio. While his father struggled to re-establish his dental practice, Grey made rural house calls and performed basic extractions, which his father had taught him. The younger Grey practiced until the state board intervened. His brother Romer earned money by driving a delivery wagon. Grey also worked as a part-time usher in a theater and played summer baseball for the Columbus Capitols, with aspirations of becoming a major leaguer. Eventually, Grey was spotted by a baseball scout and received offers from many colleges. Romer also attracted scouts&#x27; attention and went on to have a professional baseball career.

=== University of Pennsylvania and baseball ===
Grey chose the University of Pennsylvania on a baseball scholarship; he studied dentistry, joined Sigma Nu fraternity, and graduated in 1896. When he arrived at Penn, he had to prove himself worthy of a scholarship before receiving it. He rose to the occasion by coming in to pitch against the Riverton club, pitching five scoreless innings and producing a double in the tenth, which contributed to the win. The Ivy League was highly competitive and an excellent training ground for future pro baseball players. Grey was a solid hitter and an excellent pitcher who relied on a sharply dropping curveball. When the distance from the pitcher&#x27;s mound to the plate was lengthened by five feet to 60 feet 6 inches, in 1894 (primarily to reduce the dominance of Cy Young&#x27;s pitching), the effectiveness of Grey&#x27;s pitching suffered. He was re-positioned to the outfield. The short, wiry baseball player remained a campus hero on the strength of his timely hitting.

He was an indifferent scholar, barely achieving a minimum average. Outside class, he spent his time on baseball, swimming, and creative writing, especially poetry. His shy nature and his teetotaling set him apart from other students, and he socialized little. Grey struggled with the idea of becoming a writer or baseball player for his career, but unhappily concluded that dentistry was the practical choice.

During a summer break, while playing &quot;summer nines&quot; in Delphos, Ohio, Grey was charged with, and quietly settled, a paternity suit. His father paid the $133.40 cost and Grey resumed playing summer baseball. He concealed the episode when he returned to Penn.

Grey went on to play minor league baseball with several teams, including the Newark, New Jersey Colts in 1898 and also with the Orange Athletic Club for several years. His brother Romer Carl &quot;Reddy&quot; Grey (known as &quot;R.C.&quot; to his family) did better and played professionally in the minor leagues. Zane Grey and Romer Grey played together as teammates for the 1895 Findlay Sluggers of the Interstate League. Romer played a single major league game in 1903 for the Pittsburgh Pirates.

=== Dentistry ===
After graduating, Grey established his practice in New York City under the name of Dr. Zane Grey in 1896. It was a competitive area but he wanted to be close to publishers. He began to write in the evening to offset the tedium of his dental practice. He struggled financially and emotionally. Grey was a natural writer but his early efforts were stiff and grammatically weak. Whenever possible, he played baseball with the Orange Athletic Club in New Jersey, a team of former collegiate players that was one of the best amateur teams in the country.

Grey often went camping with his brother R.C. in Lackawaxen, Pennsylvania, where they fished in the upper Delaware River. When canoeing in 1900, Grey met seventeen-year-old Lina Roth, better known as &quot;Dolly.&quot; Dolly came from a family of physicians and was studying to be a schoolteacher.

=== Marriage and family ===
After a passionate and intense courtship marked by frequent quarrels, Grey and Dolly married five years later in 1905. Grey suffered bouts of depression, anger, and mood swings, which affected him most of his life. As he described it, &quot;A hyena lying in ambush—that is my black spell! I conquered one mood only to fall prey to the next ... I wandered about like a lost soul or a man who was conscious of imminent death.&quot;

During his courtship of Dolly, Grey still saw previous girlfriends and warned her frankly,

But I love to be free. I cannot change my spots. The ordinary man is satisfied with a moderate income, a home, wife, children, and all that. ... But I am a million miles from being that kind of man and no amount of trying will ever do any good ... I shall never lose the spirit of my interest in women.

After they married in 1905, Dolly gave up her teaching career. They moved to a farmhouse at the confluence of the Lackawaxen and Delaware rivers, in Lackawaxen, Pennsylvania, where Grey&#x27;s mother and sister joined them. (This house, now preserved and operated as the Zane Grey Museum, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.) Grey finally ceased his dental practice to work full-time on his nascent literary pursuits. Dolly&#x27;s inheritance provided an initial financial cushion.

=== Early writing career ===
While Dolly managed Grey&#x27;s career and raised their three children, including son Romer Zane Grey, over the next two decades Grey often spent months away from the family. He fished, wrote, and spent time with his many mistresses. While Dolly knew of his behavior, she seemed to view it as his handicap rather than a choice. Throughout their life together, he highly valued her management of his career and their family, and her solid emotional support. In addition to her considerable editorial skills, she had good business sense and handled all his contract negotiations with publishers, agents, and movie studios. All of his income was split fifty-fifty with her; from her &quot;share,&quot; she covered all family expenses. Their considerable correspondence shows evidence of his lasting love for her despite his infidelities and personal emotional turmoil.

The Greys moved to California in 1918. In 1920 they settled in Altadena, California, at a home later known as the &#x27;&quot;Zane Grey Estate&quot;&#x27;. The estate was destroyed in the January, 2025 Altadena Fire. In Altadena Grey also spent time with his mistress Brenda Montenegro. The two met while hiking Eaton Canyon. Of her he wrote,

I saw her flowing raven mane against the rocks of the canyon. I have seen the red skin of the Navajo, and the olive of the Spaniards, but her ... her skin looked as if her Creator had in that instant molded her just for me. I thought it was an apparition. She seemed to be the embodiment of the West I portray in my books, open and wild. Grey summed up his feelings for the city: &quot;In Altadena, I have found those qualities that make life worth living.&quot;

With the help of Dolly&#x27;s proofreading and copy editing, Grey gradually improved his writing. His first magazine article, &quot;A Day on the Delaware,&quot; a human-interest story about a Grey brothers&#x27; fishing expedition, was published in the May 1902 issue of &quot;Recreation&quot; magazine. Elated at selling the article, Grey offered reprints to patients in his waiting room. In writing, Grey found temporary escape from the harshness of his life and his demons. &quot;Realism is death to me. I cannot stand life as it is.&quot; By this time, he had given up baseball.

Grey read Owen Wister&#x27;s great Western novel &quot;The Virginian&quot;. After studying its style and structure in detail, he decided to write a full-length work. Grey had difficulties in writing his first novel, &quot;Betty Zane&quot; (1903). When it was rejected by Harper &amp; Brothers, he lapsed into despair. The novel dramatized the heroism of an ancestor, Betty Zane who had saved Fort Henry. He self-published it, perhaps with funds provided by his wife Dolly or his brother R. C.&#x27;s wealthy girlfriend Reba Smith. From the beginning, vivid description was the strongest aspect of his writing.

After attending a lecture in New York in 1907 at the Camp-Fire Club by Charles Jesse &quot;Buffalo&quot; Jones, western hunter and guide who had co-founded Garden City, Kansas, Grey arranged for a mountain lion-hunting trip to the North Rim of the Grand Canyon. He brought along a camera to document his trips and prove his adventures. He also began the habit of taking copious notes, not only of scenery and activities but of dialogue. His first two trips were arduous, but Grey learned much from his companions on these adventures. He gained the confidence to write convincingly about the American West, its characters, and its landscape. Treacherous river crossings, unpredictable beasts, bone-chilling cold, searing heat, parching thirst, bad water, irascible tempers, and heroic cooperation all became real to him. He wrote, &quot;Surely, of all the gifts that have come to me from contact with the West, this one of sheer love of wildness, beauty, color, grandeur, has been the greatest, the most significant for my work.&quot;

Upon returning home in 1909, Grey wrote a new novel, &quot;The Last of the Plainsmen&quot;, describing the adventures of Buffalo Jones. Harper&#x27;s editor Ripley Hitchcock rejected it, the fourth work in a row. He told Grey, &quot;I do not see anything in this to convince me you can write either narrative or fiction.&quot; Grey wrote dejectedly,

I don&#x27;t know which way to turn. I cannot decide what to write next. That which I desire to write does not seem to be what the editors want ... I am full of stories and zeal and fire ... yet I am inhibited by doubt, by fear that my feeling for life is false.

The book was later published by the American magazine, &quot;Outing&quot;, which provided Grey some satisfaction. Grey next wrote a series of magazine articles and juvenile novels.

With the birth of his first child pending, Grey felt compelled to complete his next novel, &quot;The Heritage of the Desert&quot;. He wrote it in four months in 1910. It quickly became a bestseller. Grey took his next work to Hitchcock again; this time Harper published his work, a historical romance in which Mormon characters were of central importance. Grey continued to write popular novels about Manifest Destiny, the conquest of the Old West, and the behavior of men in elemental conditions.

Two years later Grey produced his best-known book, &quot;Riders of the Purple Sage&quot; (1912), his all-time best-seller, and one of the most successful Western novels in history. Hitchcock rejected it, but Grey took his manuscript directly to the vice president of Harper, who accepted it. The novel had a sequel (&quot;The Rainbow Trail&quot;, in 1915), and was filmed five times (in 1918, 1925, 1931, 1941, and 1996; but in later film versions the villains are corrupt judges or lawyers, not Mormon polygamists).

=== Later career ===


Zane Grey had become a household name; thereafter, Harper eagerly received all his manuscripts. Other publishers caught on to the commercial potential of the Western novel. Max Brand and Ernest Haycox were among the most notable of other writers of Westerns. Grey&#x27;s publishers paired his novels with some of the best illustrators of the time, including N. C. Wyeth, Frank Schoonover, Douglas Duer, W. Herbert Dunton, W. H. D. Koerner, and Charles Russell.

Grey had the time and money to engage in his first and greatest passion: fishing. From 1918 until 1932, he was a regular contributor to &quot;Outdoor Life&quot; magazine. As one of its first celebrity writers, he began to popularize big-game fishing. Several times he went deep-sea fishing in Florida to relax and to write in solitude. Although he commented that &quot;the sea, from which all life springs, has been equally with the desert my teacher and religion&quot;, Grey was unable to write a great sea novel. He felt the sea soothed his moods, reduced his depressions, and gained him the opportunity to harvest deeper thoughts:

Over the years, Grey spent part of his time traveling and the rest of the year writing novels and articles. Unlike writers who could write every day, Grey would have dry spells and then sudden bursts of energy, in which he could write as much as 100,000 words in a month. He encountered fans in most places. He visited the Rogue River in Oregon in 1919 for a fishing expedition, and fell in love with it. He returned in the 1920s, eventually setting up a cabin on the lower Rogue River. Grey captured the river&#x27;s essence in two books: &quot;Tales of Freshwater Fishing&quot; and &quot;Rogue River Feud&quot;. Other excursions took him to Washington state and Wyoming.
From 1923 to 1930, he spent a few weeks a year at his cabin on the Mogollon Rim, in Central Arizona. After years of abandonment and decay, the cabin was restored in 1966 by Bill Goettl, a Phoenix air conditioning magnate. He opened it to the public as a free-of-charge museum. The Dude Fire destroyed the cabin in 1990. It was later reconstructed 25 miles away in the town of Payson.

During the 1930s, Grey continued to write, but the Great Depression hurt the publishing industry. His sales fell off, and he found it more difficult to sell serializations. He had avoided making investments that would have been affected by the stock market crash of 1929, and continued to earn royalty income, so he did better than many financially. Nearly half of the film adaptations of his novels were made in the 1930s.

From 1925 to his death in 1939, Grey traveled more and further from his family. He became interested in exploring unspoiled lands, particularly the islands of the South Pacific, New Zealand and Australia. He thought Arizona was beginning to be overrun by tourists and speculators. Near the end of his life, Grey looked into the future and wrote:
=== Reception by critics ===
The more books Grey sold, the more the established critics, such as Heywood Broun and Burton Rascoe, attacked him. They claimed his depictions of the West were too fanciful, too violent, and not faithful to the moral realities of the frontier. They thought his characters unrealistic and much larger-than-life. Broun stated that &quot;the substance of any two Zane Grey books could be written upon the back of a postage stamp.&quot;

T. K. Whipple praised a typical Grey novel as a modern version of the ancient &quot;Beowulf&quot; saga, &quot;a battle of passions with one another and with the will, a struggle of love and hate, or remorse and revenge, of blood, lust, honor, friendship, anger, grief—all of a grand scale and all incalculable and mysterious.&quot; However, he also criticized Grey&#x27;s writing: &quot;His style, for example, has the stiffness which comes from an imperfect mastery of the medium. It lacks fluency and facility.&quot;

Grey based his work in his own varied first-hand experience, supported by careful note-taking, and considerable research. Despite his great popular success and fortune, Grey read the reviews and sometimes became paralyzed by negative emotions after critical ones.

In 1923, a reviewer said Grey&#x27;s &quot;moral ideas ... [were] decidedly askew.&quot; Grey reacted with a 20-page treatise, &quot;My Answer to the Critics.&quot; He defended his intentions to produce great literature in the setting of the Old West. He suggested that critics should ask his readers what they think of his books, and noted actor and fan John Barrymore as an example. Dolly warned him against publishing the treatise, and he retreated from a public confrontation.

His novel &quot;The Vanishing American&quot; (1925), first serialized in &quot;The Ladies&#x27; Home Journal&quot; in 1922, prompted a heated debate. People recognized its Navajo hero as patterned after Jim Thorpe, a great Native American athlete. Grey portrayed the struggle of the Navajo to preserve their identity and culture against corrupting influences of the white government and of missionaries. This viewpoint enraged religious groups. Grey contended, &quot;I have studied the Navaho Indians for 12 years. I know their wrongs. The missionaries sent out there are almost everyone mean, vicious, weak, immoral, useless men.&quot; To have the book published, Grey agreed to some structural changes. With this book, Grey completed the most productive period of his writing career, having laid out most major themes, character types, and settings.

His &quot;Wanderer of the Wasteland&quot; is a thinly disguised autobiography. One of his books, &quot;Tales of the Angler&#x27;s El Dorado, New Zealand,&quot; helped establish the Bay of Islands in New Zealand as a premier game fishing area. Several of his later writings (e.g., &quot;Rangle River&quot;) were based in Australia.

=== Fishing ===

Grey co-founded the &quot;Porpoise Club&quot; with his friend, Robert H. Davis of &quot;Munsey&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, to popularize the sport of hunting of dolphins and porpoises. They made their first catch off Seabright, New Jersey, on September 21, 1912, where they harpooned and reeled in a bottlenose dolphin.

Grey&#x27;s son Loren claims in the introduction to &quot;Tales of Tahitian Waters&quot; that Zane Grey fished on average 300 days a year through his adult life. Grey and his brother R.C. were frequent visitors to Long Key, Florida, where they helped to establish the Long Key Fishing Club, built by Henry Morrison Flagler. Zane Grey was its president from 1917 to 1920. He pioneered the fishing of Boohoo fish (sailfish). Zane Grey Creek was named for him.

Grey indulged his interest in fishing with visits to Australia and New Zealand. He first visited New Zealand in 1926 and caught several large fish of great variety, including a mako shark, a ferocious fighter that presented a new challenge. Grey established a base at Otehei Bay, Urupukapuka Island in the Bay of Islands, which became a destination for the rich and famous. He wrote many articles in international sporting magazines highlighting the uniqueness of New Zealand fishing, which has produced heavy-tackle world records for the major billfish, striped marlin, black marlin, blue marlin and broadbill. A lodge and camp were established at Otehei Bay in 1927 called the Zane Grey Sporting Club. He held numerous world records during this time and invented the teaser, a hookless bait that is still used today to attract fish. Grey made three additional fishing trips to New Zealand. The second was January to April 1927, the third December 1928 to March 1929, and the last from December 1932 to February 1933.

Grey fished out of Wedgeport, Nova Scotia, for many summers.

Grey also helped establish deep-sea sport fishing in New South Wales, Australia, particularly in Bermagui, which is famous for marlin fishing. Patron of the Bermagui Sport Fishing Association for 1936 and 1937, Grey set a number of world records, and wrote of his experiences in his book &quot;An American Angler in Australia&quot;.

From 1928 on, Grey was a frequent visitor to Tahiti. He fished the surrounding waters several months at a time and maintained a permanent fishing camp at Vairao. He claimed that these were the most difficult waters he had ever fished, but from these waters he also took some of his most important records, such as the first marlin over .

Grey had built a getaway home in Santa Catalina Island, California, which still serves as the Zane Grey Pueblo Hotel. He served as president of Catalina&#x27;s exclusive fishing club, the Tuna Club of Avalon.

=== Death ===
Zane Grey died of heart failure on October 23, 1939, aged 67 at his home in Altadena, California. He was interred at the Lackawaxen and Union Cemetery, Lackawaxen, Pennsylvania.

== Legacy ==

=== Literary works ===
Grey became one of the first millionaire authors.

Zane Grey was a major force in shaping the myths of the Old West; his books and stories were adapted into other media, such as film and TV productions. He was the author of more than 90 books, some published posthumously or based on serials originally published in magazines. His total book sales exceeded 40 million.

Grey wrote not only Westerns, but also two hunting books, six children&#x27;s books, three baseball books, and eight fishing books. Many of them became bestsellers. It has been estimated he wrote more than nine million words in his career. 
From 1917 to 1926, Grey was in the top ten best-seller list nine times, which required sales of more than 100,000 copies each time. 
Even after his death, Harper had a stockpile of his manuscripts and continued to publish a new title yearly until 1963. 
During the 1940s and afterward, as Grey&#x27;s books were reprinted as paperbacks, his sales exploded.

Erle Stanley Gardner, prolific author of mystery novels and the &quot;Perry Mason&quot; series, said of Grey:

Grey was the favorite writer of President Dwight D. Eisenhower.

=== Books published after his death ===
A 1950 newspaper article stated that Romer Zane Grey and his mother had completed work on &quot;Cahuenga Pass&quot;, one of Zane Grey&#x27;s unfinished novels, and that a film treatment would be prepared. In 1953 columnist Hedda Hopper reported that a proposed film project, &quot;Thirty Thousand on the Hoof&quot;, was based on one of the six unfinished Grey novels that had been completed by his wife.

=== Hollywood and other media ===
Grey started his association with Hollywood when William Fox bought the rights to &quot;Riders of the Purple Sage&quot; for $2,500 in 1916. The ascending arc of Grey&#x27;s career matched that of the motion picture industry. It eagerly adapted Western stories to the screen practically from its inception, with Bronco Billy Anderson becoming the first major western star. Legendary director John Ford was then a young stage hand and Tom Mix, who had been a real cowhand, was defining the persona of the film cowboy. The Grey family moved to California to be closer to the film industry and to enable Grey to fish in the Pacific.

After his first two books were adapted to the screen, Grey formed his own motion picture company. This enabled him to control production values and faithfulness to his books. After seven films he sold his company to Jesse Lasky who was a partner of the founder of Paramount Pictures. Paramount made a number of movies based on Grey&#x27;s writings and hired him as advisor. Many of his films were shot at locations described in his books.

In 1936 Grey appeared as himself in a feature film shot in Australia, &quot;White Death&quot; (1936). At the same time he provided a story that was filmed as &quot;Rangle River&quot; (1936).

Grey became disenchanted by the commercial exploitation and copyright infringement of his works. He felt his stories and characters were diluted by being adapted to film. Nearly 50 of his novels were converted into more than 100 Western movies. Shortly after Grey&#x27;s death, the success of Fritz Lang&#x27;s &quot;Western Union&quot; (1941), a film based on one of his books, helped bring about a resurgence in Hollywood westerns. Its costars were Randolph Scott and Robert Young. The period of the 1940s and 1950s included the great works of John Ford, who successfully used the settings of Grey&#x27;s novels in Arizona and Utah.

The success of Grey&#x27;s &quot;The Lone Star Ranger&quot; (the novel was adapted into four movies: 1914, 1919, 1930 and 1942, and a comic book in 1949) and &quot;King of the Royal Mounted&quot; (popular as a series of Big Little Books and comics, later turned into a 1936 film and three film serials) inspired two radio series by George Trendle (WXYZ, Detroit). Later these were adapted again for television, forming the series &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot; and &quot;Challenge of the Yukon&quot; (&quot;Sgt. Preston of the Yukon&quot; on TV). More of Grey&#x27;s work was featured in adapted form on &quot;The Zane Grey Show&quot;, which ran on the Mutual Broadcasting System for five months in the 1940s, and the &quot;Zane Grey Western Theatre,&quot; which had a five-year run of 145 episodes.

Many famous actors got their start in films based on Zane Grey books. They included Gary Cooper, Randolph Scott, William Powell, Wallace Beery, Richard Arlen, Buster Crabbe, Shirley Temple, and Fay Wray. Victor Fleming, later director of &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;, and Henry Hathaway, who later directed &quot;True Grit&quot;, both learned their craft on Grey films.

<text>Stephen Richard &quot;Steve&quot; Bourne (born 7 January 1944) is an English computer scientist based in the United States for most of his career. He is well known as the author of the Bourne shell (codice_1), which is the foundation for the standard command-line interfaces to Unix.

==Biography==
Bourne has a Bachelor of Science (BSc) degree in mathematics from King&#x27;s College London, England. He has a Diploma in Computer Science and a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in mathematics from Trinity College, Cambridge. Subsequently, he worked on an ALGOL 68 compiler at the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory (see ALGOL 68C). He also worked on CAMAL, a system for algebraic manipulation used for lunar theory calculations.

After the University of Cambridge, Bourne spent nine years at Bell Labs with the Seventh Edition Unix team. Besides the Bourne shell, he wrote the codice_2 debugger and &quot;The Unix System&quot;, the second book on the topic, intended for general readers.

After Bell Labs, Bourne worked in senior engineering management positions at Silicon Graphics, Digital Equipment Corporation, Sun Microsystems, and Cisco Systems.

He was involved with developing international standards in programming and informatics, as a member of the International Federation for Information Processing (IFIP) IFIP Working Group 2.1 on Algorithmic Languages and Calculi, which specified, maintains, and supports the programming languages ALGOL 60 and ALGOL 68.

From 2000 to 2002 he was president of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM). For his work on computing, Bourne was awarded the ACM&#x27;s Presidential Award in 2008 and was made a Fellow of the organization in 2005. He is also a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society.

Bourne was chief technology officer at Icon Venture Partners, a venture capital firm based in Menlo Park, California through 2014. He is also chairperson of the editorial advisory board for &quot;ACM Queue&quot;, a magazine he helped found when he was president of the ACM.

<text>Mary Augusta Ward (&quot;née&quot; Arnold; 11 June 1851 – 24 March 1920) was a British novelist who wrote under her married name as Mrs Humphry Ward. She worked to improve education for the poor setting up a Settlement in London and in 1908 she became the founding President of the Women&#x27;s National Anti-Suffrage League.

==Early life==
Mary Augusta Arnold was born in Hobart, Tasmania, Australia, into a prominent intellectual family of writers and educationalists. Mary was the daughter of Tom Arnold, a professor of literature, and Julia Sorell. Her siblings included writer and journalist William Thomas Arnold, suffrage campaigner Ethel Arnold, and Julia Huxley who founded Prior&#x27;s Field School for girls in 1902 and married Leonard Huxley and their sons were Julian and Aldous Huxley. The Arnolds and the Huxleys were an important influence on British intellectual life. An uncle was the poet Matthew Arnold and her grandfather Thomas Arnold, the famous headmaster of Rugby School.
Mary&#x27;s father Tom Arnold was appointed inspector of schools in Van Diemen&#x27;s Land (now Tasmania) and commenced his role on 15 January 1850. Tom Arnold was received into the Roman Catholic Church on 12 January 1856, which made him so unpopular in his job (and with his wife) that he resigned and left for England with his family in July 1856. Mary Arnold had her fifth birthday the month before they left, and had no further connection with Tasmania. On arriving in England Tom Arnold was offered the chair of English literature at the contemplated Catholic university, Dublin, but this was only ratified after some delay.

Mary spent much of her time with her grandmother. She was educated at various boarding schools (from ages 11 to 15, in Shifnal, Shropshire) and at 16 returned to live with her parents at Oxford, where her father had a lecturership in history. Her schooldays formed the basis for one of her later novels, &quot;Marcella&quot; (1894).

On 6 April 1872, not yet 21 years old, Mary married Humphry Ward, a fellow and tutor of Brasenose College, and also a writer and editor. For the next nine years she continued to live at Oxford, at 17 Bradmore Road, where she is commemorated by a blue plaque. She had by now made herself familiar with French, German, Italian, Latin and Greek. She was developing an interest in social and educational service and making tentative efforts at literature. She added Spanish to her languages, and in 1877 undertook the writing of a large number of the lives of early Spanish ecclesiastics for the &quot;Dictionary of Christian Biography&quot; edited by Dr William Smith and Dr. Henry Wace. Her translation of Amiel&#x27;s &quot;Journal&quot; appeared in 1885.

Ward supported the opening of Oxford University to female students. She was a member of the Lectures for Women Committee, which met from 1873 and organised courses of lectures with an optional final examination for women. With other members of the committee she formed the Association for the Education of Women, which supported the opening of halls for women students in Oxford.

Ward became very involved in the negotiations surrounding the foundation of Somerville College in Oxford in 1879. She suggested that the new institution should be named after Mary Somerville. Ward was appointed as the first secretary of the Somerville Council and prepared for the arrival of new students despite being eight months pregnant when Somerville opened in October 1879.

==Career==
Ward began her career writing articles for &quot;Macmillan&#x27;s Magazine&quot; while working on a book for children that was published in 1881 under the title &quot;Milly and Olly&quot;. This was followed in 1884 by a more ambitious, though slight, study of modern life, &quot;Miss Bretherton&quot;, the story of an actress. Ward&#x27;s novels contained strong religious subject matter relevant to Victorian values she herself practised. Her popularity spread beyond Great Britain to the United States. Her book &quot;Lady Rose&#x27;s Daughter&quot; was the best-selling novel in the United States in 1903, as was &quot;The Marriage of William Ashe&quot; in 1905. Ward&#x27;s most popular novel by far was the religious &quot;novel with a purpose&quot; &quot;Robert Elsmere&quot;, which portrayed the emotional conflict between the young pastor Elsmere and his wife, whose over-narrow orthodoxy brings her religious faith and their mutual love to a terrible impasse; but it was the detailed discussion of the &quot;higher criticism&quot; of the day, and its influence on Christian belief, rather than its power as a piece of dramatic fiction, that gave the book its exceptional vogue. It started, as no academic work could have done, a popular discussion on historic and essential Christianity.

Ward helped establish an organisation for working and teaching among the poor. She also worked as an educator in the residential settlement movements she founded. Mary Ward&#x27;s declared aim was &quot;equalisation&quot; in society, and she established educational settlements first at Marchmont Hall and later at what is now called Mary Ward House on Tavistock Place in Bloomsbury. This was originally called the Passmore Edwards Settlement, after its benefactor John Passmore Edwards, but after Ward&#x27;s death it became the Mary Ward Settlement. It is now known as the Mary Ward Centre and continues as an adult education college; affiliated with it is the Mary Ward Legal Centre.

She was also a significant campaigner against women getting the vote. In the summer of 1908 she was approached by George Nathaniel Curzon and William Cremer, who asked her to be the founding president of the Women&#x27;s National Anti-Suffrage League. Ward took on the job, creating and editing the &quot;Anti-Suffrage Review&quot;. She published a large number of articles on the subject, while two of her novels, &quot;The Testing of Diana Mallory&quot; and &quot;Delia Blanchflower&quot;, were used as platforms to criticise the suffragettes. In a 1909 article in &quot;The Times&quot;, Ward wrote that constitutional, legal, financial, military, and international problems were problems only men could solve. However, she came to promote the idea of women having a voice in local government and other rights that the men&#x27;s anti-suffrage movement would not tolerate. Julia Stephen who was Virginia Woolf&#x27;s mother recommended Florence Nightingale, Octavia Hill and Ward as good role models for her daughters.

During World War I, Ward was asked by former United States President Theodore Roosevelt to write a series of articles to explain to Americans what was happening in Britain. Her work involved visiting the trenches on the Western Front, and resulted in three books, &quot;England&#x27;s Effort - Six Letters to an American Friend&quot; (1916), &quot;Towards the Goal&quot; (1917), and &quot;Fields of Victory&quot; (1919).

Ward was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1919 New Year Honours.

==Diarist (anonymous)==
Throughout the 1880s Mary kept a personal diary of social and literary stories of the people she knew and met. She preferred to conduct her observations anonymously, and the diary was never published in her lifetime. Her reminiscences were heavily drawn upon by her friend Lucy B. Walford in a 1912 memoir in which she is referred to simply as &quot;Mary&quot;. Shortly after Mary&#x27;s death in 1921 the diary was published, still anonymously, as &quot;Echoes of the &#x27;Eighties: Leaves from the Diary of a Victorian Lady&quot;. The identification of Mary Ward as the author of the diary was unknown until 2018 when an online article, about the diary&#x27;s description of Oscar Wilde wearing a coat in the shape of a cello, cross-referenced her stories with corresponding information in the Walford memoir.

==Death==
Mary Augusta Ward died on 24 March 1920, at 4 Connaught Square, London, and was interred at Aldbury in Hertfordshire, near her beloved country home Stocks three days later.

<doc id="205615" wikidata="Q1068698" url="?curid=205615" title="Myxobacteria">
<text>The myxobacteria (&quot;slime bacteria&quot;) are a group of bacteria that predominantly live in the soil and feed on insoluble organic substances. The myxobacteria have very large genomes relative to other bacteria, e.g. 9–10 million nucleotides except for &quot;Anaeromyxobacter&quot; and &quot;Vulgatibacter&quot;. One species of myxobacteria, &quot;Minicystis rosea&quot;, has the largest known bacterial genome with over 16 million nucleotides. The second largest is another myxobacteria &quot;Sorangium cellulosum&quot;.

Myxobacteria can move by gliding. They typically travel in &quot;swarms&quot; (also known as &quot;wolf packs&quot;), containing many cells kept together by intercellular molecular signals. Individuals benefit from aggregation as it allows accumulation of the extracellular enzymes that are used to digest food; this in turn increases feeding efficiency. Myxobacteria produce a number of biomedically and industrially useful chemicals, such as antibiotics, and export those chemicals outside the cell.

Myxobacteria are used to study the polysaccharide production in gram-negative bacteria like the model &quot;Myxococcus xanthus&quot; which have four different mechanisms of polysaccharide secretion and where a new Wzx/Wzy mechanism producing a new polysaccharide was identified in 2020.

Myxobacteria are also good models to study the multicellularity in the bacterial world.

==Life cycle==
When nutrients are scarce, myxobacterial cells aggregate into &quot;fruiting bodies&quot; (not to be confused with those in fungi), a process long-thought to be mediated by chemotaxis but now considered to be a function of a form of contact-mediated signaling. These fruiting bodies can take different shapes and colors, depending on the species. Within the fruiting bodies, cells begin as rod-shaped vegetative cells, and develop into rounded myxospores with thick cell walls. These myxospores, analogous to spores in other organisms, are more likely to survive until nutrients are more plentiful. The fruiting process is thought to benefit myxobacteria by ensuring that cell growth is resumed with a group (swarm) of myxobacteria, rather than as isolated cells. Similar life cycles have developed among certain amoebae, called cellular slime molds.

At a molecular level, initiation of fruiting body development in &quot;Myxococcus xanthus&quot; is regulated by Pxr sRNA.

Myxobacteria such as &quot;Myxococcus xanthus&quot; and &quot;Stigmatella aurantiaca&quot; are used as model organisms for the study of development.

It has been suggested that the last common ancestor of myxobacteria was an aerobe and that their anaerobic predecessors lived syntrophically with early eukaryotes.

==Clinical use==
Metabolites secreted by &quot;Sorangium cellulosum&quot; known as epothilones have been noted to have antineoplastic activity. This has led to the development of analogs which mimic its activity. One such analog, known as Ixabepilone is a U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved chemotherapy agent for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer.

Myxobacteria are also known to produce gephyronic acid, an inhibitor of eukaryotic protein synthesis and a potential agent for cancer chemotherapy.

<text>San Anton Palace () is a palace in Attard, Malta, that currently serves as the official residence of the president of Malta. It was originally built in the early 17th century as a country villa for Antoine de Paule, a knight of the Order of St. John. It was expanded into a palace following de Paule&#x27;s election as Grand Master in 1623.

The palace was used as a residence by subsequent Grand Masters, being enlarged a number of times in the process. It was the headquarters of the rebel National Assembly during the uprising of 1798–1800, and it later became a residence for the civil commissioners, governors and governors-general of Malta. It was often used by British sovereigns and other royalty during their stay in Malta. It has been the official residence of the president since the office was created in December 1974.

The palace is surrounded by the extensive San Anton Gardens, parts of which have been open to the public since 1882.

==History==

In around 1600, Antoine de Paule, a knight of the Order of St. John from the Langue of Provence, acquired a piece of land in Attard and built a country villa. De Paule was elected Grand Master in 1623, and the villa was subsequently enlarged into a palace in around 1625. The palace was named San Anton after the Grand Master&#x27;s patron saint, Anthony of Padua.

De Paule planned the villa on generous proportions to provide accommodation for his guests and his large domestic staff which included cooks, food tasters, torch bearers, pantry boys, wig makers, a winder of the clocks, physicians, as well as a baker to make black bread for feeding his hunting dogs.

Following de Paule&#x27;s death in 1636, the palace remained in use as a residence by subsequent Grand Masters of the Order, since it was closer to the capital city Valletta than the Verdala Palace. Over the years, the building was expanded from having a T-shape into a Latin cross.

During the French occupation of Malta and the subsequent Maltese uprising, the palace was the meeting place of the rebel National Assembly, which first met on 11 February 1799. In 1800, the palace became the residence of the first British civil commissioner, Admiral Sir Alexander Ball, who died at the palace in October 1809.

The palace subsequently became the official residence of the governor and, later, governor-general of Malta. Some structural changes were made during British rule, including a reduction of the height of the tower after it was hit by lightning in 1819, and the addition of a balustraded walk around the main courtyard. Parts of the palace&#x27;s gardens were opened to the public in 1882. San Anton has been the official residence of the president of Malta since the island became a republic in December 1974.

Princess Victoria Melita of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha was born at the palace on 25 November 1876, when her father Alfred, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, was stationed in Malta as a Royal Navy officer.

Queen Elizabeth II stayed at the palace during her royal visits to Malta in 1954, 1967 and 2005.

The palace and its gardens were included on the Antiquities List of 1925. It is now a Grade 1 national monument, and it is also listed on the &quot;National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands&quot;.

On 17 October 2018 a stretch of a historic wall forming part of the palace collapsed. There were no injuries. Emergency work was undertaken to conserve the remaining part of the wall, which had been restored a few months before.

==Architecture==

San Anton Palace is a two-storey building, with a high square tower which has panoramic views of the surrounding area.

===Chapels===

San Anton Palace contains two chapels, one dedicated to Our Lady of Pilar and another dedicated to St. Anthony. The Chapel of Our Lady of Pilar was built by Grand Master António Manoel de Vilhena in the 18th century. It consists of a barrel-vaulted nave, with ribs dividing the ceiling into six bays. The vault is decorated with the coats of arms of de Vilhena, and subsequent Grand Masters Manuel Pinto da Fonseca and Emmanuel de Rohan-Polduc. The altar is set within a chancel separated from the nave by pilasters.

The Chapel of St. Anthony, which is also known as the Russian Chapel, was built in the 19th century as a Protestant chapel. It was later converted to a Russian Orthodox chapel to accommodate Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna of Russia, the wife of Alfred, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. It is larger than the Chapel of Our Lady of Pilar. The chapel&#x27;s denomination is now Roman Catholic, and it was restored in 2013.

==Gardens==

San Anton Gardens are laid out in a formal manner, with graceful walkways, sculptures, ornamental ponds with ducks, swans and turtles, and a small aviary. The gardens contain a number of fountains, one decorated with a statue relocated from Argotti Gardens.

The gardens contain a large variety of trees and flowers from around the world, including a variety of palm trees, cypress, jacarandas, araucarias and other exotic plants, some of them over three centuries old. For many years it has been customary for visiting heads of state to plant a tree in memory of their stay in Malta. The gardens also contain an orangery, and it was once the practice of incumbent governors to give baskets of oranges grown in the palace gardens as gifts at Christmas time.

Parts of the gardens were first opened to the public in the early 19th century by Admiral Sir Alexander Ball. They were enriched by General The 1st Marquess of Hastings, the second governor of Malta, in the 1820s. Lord Hastings, an Anglo-Irish aristocrat, had previously served as the governor-general of India. The gardens were reopened to the public in 1882.

==Events==

A number of events are held at San Anton Palace, including the annual Horticultural Spring Show. The Malta Community Chest Fund, a charitable organization headed by the president, also occasionally holds fund-raising events at the palace.

The President&#x27;s Kitchen Garden is located across the street from San Anton Palace, close to Villa Bologna. While not being physically part of the palace, it is part of the property of the palace and under the president of Malta. It offers a privately contracted food retreat, and profits go to the Malta Community Chest Fund.

==Legacy==

San Anton Palace and its gardens probably influenced subsequent Grand Masters to build their own residences and gardens, such as Giovanni Paolo Lascaris, who built Ġnien is-Sultan in Valletta, and António Manoel de Vilhena, who built Casa Leoni in Santa Venera.

<text>Malta is an island in Southern Europe. It is the largest and most populous of the three major islands that constitute the Maltese Archipelago. The island is situated in the Mediterranean Sea directly south of Italy and north of Libya. It lies south-east of the smaller islands of Gozo and Comino.The island is long and wide, with a total area of . The capital is Valletta, while the largest locality is Rabat. The island is made up of many small towns, which together form one larger urban zone with a population of 409,259. The landscape is characterised by low hills with terraced fields.

==History==


Humans have inhabited Malta since about 5200 BC, when Stone Age hunters or farmers arrived from Sicily. Early Neolithic settlements were discovered in open areas and also in caves, such as Għar Dalam. Around 3500 BC, a culture of megalithic temple builders then either supplanted or arose. They built some of the oldest existing, free-standing structures in the world in the form of megalithic temples such as those at Ħaġar Qim and Mnajdra. After 2500 BC, Malta was depopulated but soon became the home of Bronze Age settlers, who settled in sites such as Borġ in-Nadur. They built first fortifications in Malta.

Malta was later ruled by the Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Romans, Byzantines and Arabs before it was occupied by the County of Sicily in 1091. The island then became part of the Kingdom of Sicily until it was given to the Order of Saint John along with Gozo and Tripoli (North Africa) in 1530. In 1192 Tancred, King of Sicily created Margaritus of Brindisi the first Count of Malta. In 1565, the Order and the Maltese withstood a major Ottoman invasion which became known as the Great Siege of Malta. The Order ruled Malta for over 250 years and built many great pieces of architecture, including the capital city Valletta. In 1798, the French under Napoleon occupied Malta and ruled from 1798–1800. Napoleon&#x27;s stay lasted from 12–18 June when he resided at Palazzo Parisio in Valletta. The French remained until the Maltese rebelled against their rule. In 1800, the British took control over Malta and the island initially became a British protectorate, and a colony a couple of years later. The British ruled for about 150 years and Malta became independent in 1964. Ten years later the State of Malta became the Republic of Malta. Malta joined the European Union in 2004 and adopted the Euro four years later.

==Geography==
Malta is the largest island in an archipelago in the central Mediterranean, some south of the Italian island of Sicily across the Malta Channel. Malta is located east of its sister islands of Gozo and Comino. It lies on the Malta plateau, a shallow shelf formed from the high points of a land bridge between Sicily and North Africa that became isolated as sea levels rose after the last ice age. Malta is therefore situated in the zone between the Eurasian and African tectonic plates.

Numerous bays along the indented coastline of the islands provide good harbours. The landscape consists of low hills with terraced fields. The highest point in Malta is Ta&#x27; Dmejrek, at , near Dingli. Although there are some small rivers at times of high rainfall, there are no permanent rivers or lakes on Malta. However, some watercourses have fresh water running all year round, such as those at Ras ir-Raħeb near Baħrija and at l-Imtaħleb.

Phytogeographically, Malta belongs to the Liguro-Tyrrhenian province of the Mediterranean Region within the Boreal Kingdom. According to the WWF, the territory of Malta belongs to the ecoregion of &quot;Mediterranean Forests, Woodlands and Scrub&quot;.

Some minor islands off the main island of Malta include:
*Dellimara Island (Marsaxlokk)
*Filfla (Żurrieq/Siġġiewi)
*Għallis Rock (Naxxar)
*St Paul&#x27;s Islands (Mellieħa)
*Manoel Island (Gżira) - connected to the mainland via a bridge

*Mistra Rocks (San Pawl il-Baħar)
*Qawra Point/Ta&#x27; Fraben Island (San Pawl il-Baħar)
*Sala Rock (Żabbar)
*Xrobb l-Għaġin Rock (Marsaxlokk)
===Climate===

Malta has a Subtropical–Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Csa&quot;), with very mild winters and hot summers. Rain occurs mainly in winter, with summer being generally dry. According to International Living, Malta is the country with the best climate in the world.

The average yearly temperature is around during the day and at night. In the coldest month, January, the typically maximum temperature ranges from during the day and minimum at night. In the warmest month, August, the typically maximum temperature ranges from during the day and minimum at night. Generally, summers/holiday season lasts to 8 months, starting from around mid-April with temperatures during the day and at night, ending in November with temperatures during the day and at night, although also in the remaining 4 months temperatures sometimes reach . Amongst all capitals in the continent of Europe, Valletta, the capital of Malta, has the warmest winters, with average temperatures of around during the day and at night in the period January–February. In March and December average temperature is around during the day and at night. Large fluctuations in temperature are rare. Also, Malta is one of the few places in Europe which are &quot;green&quot; all year round.

Average annual temperature of the sea is (the highest in the continent of Europe), from in February to in August. In the 6 months from June to November, the average sea temperature exceeds .

Sunshine duration hours total around 3,000 per year (one of the highest results in Europe), from an average above five hours of sunshine per day in December to an average above 12 hours in July. This is about double that of cities in the northern half of Europe, for comparison: London – 1,461; however, in winter it has up to several times more sunshine; for comparison: in December, London has 37 hours of sunshine whereas Malta has about 160.

===Urbanization===
According to Eurostat, Malta Island is a single Larger Urban Zone nominally referred to as &quot;Valletta&quot;. According to Demographia, the whole country is identified as urban area. According to European Spatial Planning Observation Network, Malta is identified as Functional Urban Area (FUA). According to United Nations, about 95% of Malta is urban area and the number grows every year. Also, according to the results of ESPON and EU Commission studies, &quot;the whole territory of Malta constitutes a single urban region&quot;.

==Economy==


The main island of Malta contributes significantly to the country&#x27;s overall economy, which itself is classified as an advanced economy according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Until 1800 Malta depended on cotton, tobacco and its shipyards for exports. Once under British control, they came to depend on Malta Dockyard for support of the Royal Navy, especially during the Crimean War of 1854. Malta&#x27;s economy was boosted by the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869, as there was a massive increase of civilian shipping which entered the port. Ships stopping at Malta&#x27;s docks for refuelling helped the Entrepôt trade, which brought additional benefits to the island. Towards the end of the 19th century the economy began declining, and by the 1940s Malta&#x27;s economy was in serious crisis. One factor was the longer range of newer merchant ships that required less frequent refuelling stops. The economy was boosted again after World War II when the island needed to be rebuilt.Currently, Malta&#x27;s major resources are limestone, a favourable geographic location and a productive labour force. Malta produces only about 20% of its food needs, has limited freshwater supplies because of the drought in the summer and has no domestic energy sources, aside from the potential for solar energy from its plentiful sunlight. The economy is dependent on foreign trade (serving as a freight trans-shipment point), manufacturing (especially electronics and textiles) and tourism.

Film production is a growing contributor to the Maltese economy. Despite its size, Malta continues to attract international film productions from around the world and this is the best sign of confidence that a small country can get from foreign producers. The first film shot in Malta was &quot;Sons of the Sea&quot; in 1925. Since then, over 100 other films were partially or fully shot in Malta, including &quot;Malta Story&quot; (1953), &quot;Midnight Express&quot; (1978), &quot;Popeye&quot; (1980), &quot;Gladiator&quot; (2000), &quot;Munich&quot; (2005), &quot;World War Z&quot; (2013) and &quot;Captain Phillips&quot; (2013).

In preparation for Malta&#x27;s membership in the European Union, which it joined on 1 May 2004, it privatised some state-controlled firms and liberalised markets. For example, the government announced on 8 January 2007 that it was selling its 40% stake in MaltaPost, to complete a privatisation process which had been ongoing for the previous five years. By 2010, Malta had privatised telecommunications, postal services, shipyards and shipbuilding.

===Banking and finance===

The two largest commercial banks are Bank of Valletta and HSBC Bank Malta, both of which can trace their origins back to the 19th century.

The Central Bank of Malta (Bank Ċentrali ta&#x27; Malta) has two key areas of responsibility: the formulation and implementation of monetary policy and the promotion of a sound and efficient financial system. It was established by the Central Bank of Malta Act on 17 April 1968. The Maltese government entered ERM II on 4 May 2005, and adopted the euro as the country&#x27;s currency on 1 January 2008.

FinanceMalta is the quasi-governmental organisation tasked with marketing and educating business leaders in coming to Malta and runs seminars and events around the world highlighting the emerging strength of Malta as a jurisdiction for banking and finance and insurance.

===Transport===


Traffic in Malta drives on the left. Car ownership in Malta is exceedingly high, given the very small size of the island.

The main roads of Malta from the southernmost point to the northernmost point are these: Triq Birżebbuġa in Birżebbuġa, Għar Dalam Road and Tal-Barrani Road in Żejtun, Santa Luċija Avenue in Paola, Aldo Moro Street (Trunk Road), 13 December Street and Ħamrun-Marsa Bypass in Marsa, Regional Road in Santa Venera/Msida/Gżira/San Ġwann, St Andrew&#x27;s Road in Swieqi/Pembroke, Malta, Coast Road in Baħar iċ-Ċagħaq, Salina Road, Kennedy Drive, St. Paul&#x27;s Bypass and Xemxija Hill in San Pawl il-Baħar, Mistra Hill, Wettinger Street (Mellieħa Bypass) and Marfa Road in Mellieħa.

Buses (&quot;xarabank&quot; or &quot;karozza tal-linja&quot;) are the primary method of public transport. Established in 1905, the service underwent an extensive reform in July 2011. The management structure changed from having self-employed drivers driving their own vehicles to a service being offered by a single company through a public tender. The public tender was won by Arriva Malta, a member of the Arriva group, but the company ceased operations on 1 January 2014 having been nationalised as &quot;Malta Public Transport&quot; by the Maltese government, with a new bus operator to take over their operations in the near future.

Malta has three large natural harbours:

*The Grand Harbour (or Port il-Kbir), located at the eastern side of the capital city of Valletta, has been a harbour since Roman times. It has several extensive docks and wharves, as well as a cruise liner terminal. A terminal at the Grand Harbour serves ferries that connect Malta to Pozzallo &amp; Catania in Sicily.
*Marsamxett Harbour, located on the western side of Valletta, accommodates a number of yacht marinas.
*Marsaxlokk Harbour (Malta Freeport), at Birżebbuġa on the south-eastern side of Malta, is the islands&#x27; main cargo terminal. Malta Freeport is the 11th busiest container port in continent of Europe and 46th in the World with a trade volume of 2.3 million TEU&#x27;s in 2008.

There is also a man-made harbour at Ċirkewwa. This is connected with Mġarr Harbour on Gozo by the Gozo ferry which makes numerous trips each day.

The only airport on Malta is Malta International Airport. It is built on the land formerly occupied by the RAF Luqa air base. Two further airfields at Ta&#x27; Qali and Ħal Far were operated during World War II and into the 1960s but are now closed. Today, Ta&#x27; Qali houses a national park, stadium, the Crafts Village visitor attraction and the Malta Aviation Museum. This museum preserves several aircraft, including Hurricane and Spitfire fighters that defended the island in World War II. The national airline is Air Malta.

===Tourism===
Malta is a popular tourist destination, with 1.2 million tourists per year. Three times more tourists visit than there are residents. Tourism infrastructure has increased dramatically over the years and a number of good-quality hotels are present on the island, although overdevelopment and the destruction of traditional housing is of growing concern. An increasing number of Maltese now travel abroad on holiday.

In recent years, Malta has advertised itself as a medical tourism destination, and a number of health tourism providers are developing the industry. However, no Maltese hospital has undergone independent international healthcare accreditation. Malta is popular with British medical tourists, pointing Maltese hospitals towards seeking UK-sourced accreditation, such as with the Trent Accreditation Scheme. Dual accreditation with the American-oriented Joint Commission is necessary if hospitals in Malta wish to compete with the Far East and Latin America for medical tourists from the United States.

==Demographics==

Native Maltese people make up the majority of the island. However, there are minorities, the largest of which are British, many of whom have retired to Malta. According to the government&#x27;s estimate of 2013, the population of Malta stood at 409,259 people which is about 91.6% of the country&#x27;s total population. The largest city is Birkirkara with a population of 22,319. The capital Valletta has a relatively small population of 6675 people.

The main language spoken on Malta is the Maltese language, a Semitic language descended from the now defunct Siculo-Arabic dialect of southern Italy. The language has substantial borrowing from Sicilian, Italian, a little French, and more recently and increasingly, English. The hybrid character of Maltese was established by a long period of Maltese-Sicilian urban bilingualism gradually transforming rural speech and which ended in the early 19th century with Maltese emerging as the vernacular of the entire native population. The language includes different dialects that can vary greatly from one town to another or from one island to another.

The Eurobarometer states that 100% of the population speak Maltese. Also, 88% of the population speak English, 66% speak Italian, and 17% speak French. This widespread knowledge of second languages makes Malta one of the most multilingual countries in the European Union. A study collecting public opinion on what language was &quot;preferred&quot; discovered that 86% of the population express a preference for Maltese, 12% for English, and 2% for Italian. Still, Italian television channels from Italy-based broadcasters, such as Mediaset and RAI, reach Malta and remain popular.

===Administrative divisions===


Malta has had a system of local government since 1993, based on the European Charter of Local Self-Government. The main island is divided into four regions, each having its own Regional Committee:
*Central Region
*Northern Region
*South Eastern Region
*Southern Region
Each region is further divided into local councils. Some hamlets have administrative committees, which are part of larger local councils. Currently there are 54 local councils and 13 administrative committees in Malta.

The island is also divided into five districts, but these serve primarily for statistical purposes:
*Northern District
*Northern Harbour District
*South Eastern District
*Southern Harbour District
*Western District

<text>Squid is a caching and forwarding HTTP web proxy. It has a wide variety of uses, including speeding up a web server by caching repeated requests, caching World Wide Web (WWW), Domain Name System (DNS), and other network lookups for a group of people sharing network resources, and aiding security by filtering traffic. Although used for mainly HTTP and File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Squid includes limited support for several other protocols including Internet Gopher, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), Transport Layer Security (TLS), and Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS). Squid does not support the SOCKS protocol, unlike Privoxy, with which Squid can be used in order to provide SOCKS support.

Squid was originally designed to run as a daemon on Unix-like systems. A Windows port was maintained up to version 2.7. New versions available on Windows use the Cygwin environment. Squid is free software released under the GNU General Public License.

==History==
Squid was originally developed as the &quot;Harvest object cache&quot;, part of the Harvest project at the University of Colorado Boulder. Further work on the program was completed at the University of California, San Diego and funded via two grants from the National Science Foundation. Duane Wessels forked the &quot;last pre-commercial version of Harvest&quot; and renamed it to Squid to avoid confusion with the commercial fork called Cached 2.0, which became NetCache. Squid version 1.0.0 was released in July 1996. SquidNT, a port of the Squid proxy server was merged into the main Squid project in September 2006.

Squid is now developed almost exclusively through volunteer efforts.

In October 2023, it was revealed that Squid continued to suffer from 35 security vulnerabilities which had not been fixed for two and a half years after their initial reporting.

==Basic functionality==
After a Squid proxy server is installed, web browsers can be configured to use it as a proxy HTTP server, allowing Squid to retain copies of the documents returned, which, on repeated requests for the same documents, can reduce access time as well as bandwidth consumption. This is often useful for Internet service providers to increase speed to their customers, and LANs that share an Internet connection. Because the caching servers are controlled by the web service operator, caching proxies do not anonymize the user and should not be confused with anonymizing proxies.

A client program (e.g. browser) either has to specify explicitly the proxy server it wants to use (typical for ISP customers), or it could be using a proxy without any extra configuration: &quot;transparent caching&quot;, in which case all outgoing HTTP requests are intercepted by Squid and all responses are cached. The latter is typically a corporate set-up (all clients are on the same LAN) and often introduces the privacy concerns mentioned above.

Squid has some features that can help anonymize connections, such as disabling or changing specific header fields in a client&#x27;s HTTP requests. Whether these are set, and what they are set to do, is up to the person who controls the computer running Squid. People requesting pages through a network which transparently uses Squid may not know whether this information is being logged. Within UK organisations at least, users should be informed if computers or internet connections are being monitored.

==Reverse proxy==
The above setup, caching the contents of an unlimited number of webservers for a limited number of clients, is the classical one. Another setup is &quot;reverse proxy&quot; or &quot;webserver acceleration&quot; (using ). In this mode, the cache serves an unlimited number of clients for a limited number of—or just one—web servers.

As an example, if &quot;slow.example.com&quot; is a &quot;real&quot; web server, and &quot;www.example.com&quot; is the Squid cache server that &quot;accelerates&quot; it, the first time any page is requested from &quot;www.example.com&quot;, the cache server would get the actual page from &quot;slow.example.com&quot;, but later requests would get the stored copy directly from the accelerator (for a configurable period, after which the stored copy would be discarded). The result, without any action by the clients, is less traffic to the source server, meaning less CPU and memory usage, and less need for bandwidth. This does, however, mean that the source server cannot accurately report on its traffic numbers without additional configuration, as all requests would seem to have come from the reverse proxy. A way to adapt the reporting on the source server is to use the X-Forwarded-For HTTP header reported by the reverse proxy, to get the real client&#x27;s IP address.

It is possible for one Squid server to serve simultaneously as a normal and a reverse proxy. For example, a business might host its own website on a web server, with a Squid server acting as a reverse proxy between clients (customers accessing the website from outside the business) and the web server. The same Squid server could act as a classical web cache, caching HTTP requests from clients within the business (i.e., employees accessing the internet from their workstations), so accelerating web access and reducing bandwidth demands.

==Media-range limits==
For example, a feature of the HTTP protocol is to limit a request to the range of data in the resource being referenced. This feature is used extensively by video streaming websites such as YouTube, so that if a user clicks to the middle of the video progress bar, the server can begin to send data from the middle of the file, rather than sending the entire file from the beginning and the user waiting for the preceding data to finish loading.

Partial downloads are also extensively used by Microsoft Windows Update so that extremely large update packages can download in the background and pause halfway through the download, if the user turns off their computer or disconnects from the Internet.

The Metalink download format enables clients to do segmented downloads by issuing partial requests and spreading these over a number of mirrors.

Squid can relay partial requests to the origin web server. In order for a partial request to be satisfied at a fast speed from cache, Squid requires a full copy of the same object to already exist in its storage.

If a proxy video user is watching a video stream and browses to a different page before the video completely downloads, Squid cannot keep the partial download for reuse and simply discards the data. Special configuration is required to force such downloads to continue and be cached.

==Supported operating systems==
Squid supports many operating systems, including:

<doc id="205624" wikidata="Q83185" url="?curid=205624" title="Horizontal gene transfer">
<text>Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) or lateral gene transfer (LGT) is the movement of genetic material between organisms other than by the (&quot;vertical&quot;) transmission of DNA from parent to offspring (reproduction). HGT is an important factor in the evolution of many organisms. HGT is influencing scientific understanding of higher-order evolution while more significantly shifting perspectives on bacterial evolution.

Horizontal gene transfer is the primary mechanism for the spread of antibiotic resistance in bacteria, and plays an important role in the evolution of bacteria that can degrade novel compounds such as human-created pesticides and in the evolution, maintenance, and transmission of virulence. It often involves temperate bacteriophages and plasmids. Genes responsible for antibiotic resistance in one species of bacteria can be transferred to another species of bacteria through various mechanisms of HGT such as transformation, transduction and conjugation, subsequently arming the antibiotic resistant genes&#x27; recipient against antibiotics. The rapid spread of antibiotic resistance genes in this manner is becoming a challenge to manage in the field of medicine. Ecological factors may also play a role in the HGT of antibiotic resistant genes.

Horizontal gene transfer is recognized as a pervasive evolutionary process that distributes genes between divergent prokaryotic lineages and can also involve eukaryotes. HGT events are thought to occur less frequently in eukaryotes than in prokaryotes. However, growing evidence indicates that HGT is relatively common among many eukaryotic species and can have an impact on adaptation to novel environments. Its study, however, is hindered by the complexity of eukaryotic genomes and the abundance of repeat-rich regions, which complicate the accurate identification and characterization of transferred genes.

It is postulated that HGT promotes the maintenance of a universal life biochemistry and, subsequently, the universality of the genetic code.

==History==

Griffith&#x27;s experiment, reported in 1928 by Frederick Griffith, was the first experiment suggesting that bacteria are capable of transferring genetic information through a process known as transformation. Griffith&#x27;s findings were followed by research in the late 1930s and early 1940s that isolated DNA as the material that communicated this genetic information.

Horizontal genetic transfer was then described in Seattle in 1951, in a paper demonstrating that the transfer of a viral gene into &quot;Corynebacterium diphtheriae&quot; created a virulent strain from a non-virulent strain, simultaneously revealing the mechanism of diphtheria (that patients could be infected with the bacteria but not have any symptoms, and then suddenly convert later or never), and giving the first example for the relevance of the lysogenic cycle. Inter-bacterial gene transfer was first described in Japan in a 1959 publication that demonstrated the transfer of antibiotic resistance between different species of bacteria. In the mid-1980s, Syvanen postulated that biologically significant lateral gene transfer has existed since the beginning of life on Earth and has been involved in shaping all of evolutionary history.

As Jian, Rivera and Lake (1999) put it: &quot;Increasingly, studies of genes and genomes are indicating that considerable horizontal transfer has occurred between prokaryotes&quot; (see also Lake and Rivera, 2007). The phenomenon appears to have had some significance for unicellular eukaryotes as well. As Bapteste et al. (2005) observe, &quot;additional evidence suggests that gene transfer might also be an important evolutionary mechanism in protist evolution.&quot;

Grafting of one plant to another can transfer chloroplasts (organelles in plant cells that conduct photosynthesis), mitochondrial DNA, and the entire cell nucleus containing the genome to potentially make a new species. Some Lepidoptera (e.g. monarch butterflies and silkworms) have been genetically modified by horizontal gene transfer from the wasp bracovirus. Bites from insects in the family Reduviidae (assassin bugs) can, via a parasite, infect humans with the trypanosomal Chagas disease, which can insert its DNA into the human genome. It has been suggested that lateral gene transfer to humans from bacteria may play a role in cancer.

Aaron Richardson and Jeffrey D. Palmer state: &quot;Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) has played a major role in bacterial evolution and is fairly common in certain unicellular eukaryotes. However, the prevalence and importance of HGT in the evolution of multicellular eukaryotes remain unclear.&quot;

Due to the increasing amount of evidence suggesting the importance of these phenomena for evolution (see below) molecular biologists such as Peter Gogarten have described horizontal gene transfer as &quot;A New Paradigm for Biology&quot;.

==Mechanisms==
There are several mechanisms for horizontal gene transfer:
*Transformation, the genetic alteration of a cell resulting from the introduction, uptake and expression of foreign genetic material (DNA or RNA). This process is relatively common in bacteria, but less so in eukaryotes. Transformation is often used in laboratories to insert novel genes into bacteria for experiments or for industrial or medical applications. See also molecular biology and biotechnology.
*Transduction, the process in which bacterial DNA is moved from one bacterium to another by a virus (a bacteriophage, or phage).
*Bacterial conjugation, a process that involves the transfer of DNA via a plasmid from a donor cell to a recombinant recipient cell during cell-to-cell contact.
*Gene transfer agents, virus-like elements encoded by the host that are found in the alphaproteobacteria order Rhodobacterales.

===Horizontal transposon transfer===

A transposable element (TE) (also called a transposon or jumping gene) is a mobile segment of DNA that can sometimes pick up a resistance gene and insert it into a plasmid or chromosome, thereby inducing horizontal gene transfer of antibiotic resistance.

Horizontal transposon transfer (HTT) refers to the passage of pieces of DNA that are characterized by their ability to move from one locus to another between genomes by means other than parent-to-offspring inheritance. Horizontal gene transfer has long been thought to be crucial to prokaryotic evolution, but there is a growing amount of data showing that HTT is a common and widespread phenomenon in eukaryote evolution as well. On the transposable element side, spreading between genomes via horizontal transfer may be viewed as a strategy to escape purging due to purifying selection, mutational decay and/or host defense mechanisms.

HTT can occur with any type of transposable elements, but DNA transposons and LTR retroelements are more likely to be capable of HTT because both have a stable, double-stranded DNA intermediate that is thought to be sturdier than the single-stranded RNA intermediate of non-LTR retroelements, which can be highly degradable. Non-autonomous elements may be less likely to transfer horizontally compared to autonomous elements because they do not encode the proteins required for their own mobilization. The structure of these non-autonomous elements generally consists of an intronless gene encoding a transposase protein, and may or may not have a promoter sequence. Those that do not have promoter sequences encoded within the mobile region rely on adjacent host promoters for expression. Horizontal transfer is thought to play an important role in the TE life cycle. In plants, it appears that LTR retrotransposons of the Copia superfamilies, especially those with low copy numbers from the Ale and Ivana lineages, are more likely to undergo horizontal transfer between different plant species.

HTT has been shown to occur between species and across continents in both plants and animals (Ivancevic et al. 2013), though some TEs have been shown to more successfully colonize the genomes of certain species over others. Both spatial and taxonomic proximity of species has been proposed to favor HTTs in plants and animals. It is unknown how the density of a population may affect the rate of HTT events within a population, but close proximity due to parasitism and cross contamination due to crowding have been proposed to favor HTT in both plants and animals. In plants, the interaction between lianas and trees has been shown to facilitate HTT in natural ecosystems. Successful transfer of a transposable element requires delivery of DNA from donor to host cell (and to the germ line for multi-cellular organisms), followed by integration into the recipient host genome. Though the actual mechanism for the transportation of TEs from donor cells to host cells is unknown, it is established that naked DNA and RNA can circulate in bodily fluid. Many proposed vectors include arthropods, viruses, freshwater snails (Ivancevic et al. 2013), endosymbiotic bacteria, and intracellular parasitic bacteria. In some cases, even TEs facilitate transport for other TEs.

The arrival of a new TE in a host genome can have detrimental consequences because TE mobility may induce mutation. However, HTT can also be beneficial by introducing new genetic material into a genome and promoting the shuffling of genes and TE domains among hosts, which can be co-opted by the host genome to perform new functions. Moreover, transposition activity increases the TE copy number and generates chromosomal rearrangement hotspots. HTT detection is a difficult task because it is an ongoing phenomenon that is constantly changing in frequency of occurrence and composition of TEs inside host genomes. Furthermore, few species have been analyzed for HTT, making it difficult to establish patterns of HTT events between species. These issues can lead to the underestimation or overestimation of HTT events between ancestral and current eukaryotic species.

==Methods of detection==

Horizontal gene transfer is typically inferred using bioinformatics methods, either by identifying atypical sequence signatures (&quot;parametric&quot; methods) or by identifying strong discrepancies between the evolutionary history of particular sequences compared to that of their hosts. The transferred gene (xenolog) found in the receiving species is more closely related to the genes of the donor species than would be expected.

==Viruses==
The virus called &quot;Mimivirus&quot; infects amoebae. Another virus, called &quot;Sputnik&quot;, also infects amoebae, but it cannot reproduce unless mimivirus has already infected the same cell. Sputnik&#x27;s genome reveals further insight into its biology. Although 13 of its genes show little similarity to any other known genes, three are closely related to mimivirus and mamavirus genes, perhaps cannibalized by the tiny virus as it packaged up particles sometime in its history. This suggests that the satellite virus could perform horizontal gene transfer between viruses, paralleling the way that bacteriophages ferry genes between bacteria. Horizontal transfer is also seen between geminiviruses and tobacco plants.
==Prokaryotes==
Horizontal gene transfer is common among bacteria, even among very distantly related ones. This process is thought to be a significant cause of increased drug resistance when one bacterial cell acquires resistance, and the resistance genes are transferred to the other species. Transposition and horizontal gene transfer, along with strong natural selective forces have led to multi-drug resistant strains of &quot;S. aureus&quot; and many other pathogenic bacteria. Horizontal gene transfer also plays a role in the spread of virulence factors, such as exotoxins and exoenzymes, amongst bacteria. A prime example concerning the spread of exotoxins is the adaptive evolution of Shiga toxins in &quot;E. coli&quot; through horizontal gene transfer via transduction with &quot;Shigella&quot; species of bacteria. Strategies to combat certain bacterial infections by targeting these specific virulence factors and mobile genetic elements have been proposed. For example, horizontally transferred genetic elements play important roles in the virulence of &quot;E. coli&quot;, &quot;Salmonella&quot;, &quot;Streptococcus&quot; and &quot;Clostridium perfringens&quot;.

In prokaryotes, restriction-modification systems are known to provide immunity against horizontal gene transfer and in stabilizing mobile genetic elements. Genes encoding restriction modification systems have been reported to move between prokaryotic genomes within mobile genetic elements (MGE) such as plasmids, prophages, insertion sequences/transposons, integrative conjugative elements (ICE), and integrons. Still, they are more frequently a chromosomal-encoded barrier to MGE than an MGE-encoded tool for cell infection.

Lateral gene transfer via a mobile genetic element, namely the integrated conjugative element (ICE) &quot;Bs1&quot; has been reported for its role in the global DNA damage SOS response of the gram positive &quot;Bacillus subtilis&quot;. Furthermore, it has been linked with the radiation and desiccation resistance of &quot;Bacillus pumilus&quot; SAFR-032 spores, isolated from spacecraft cleanroom facilities.

Transposon insertion elements have been reported to increase the fitness of gram-negative &quot;E. coli&quot; strains through either major transpositions or genome rearrangements, and increasing mutation rates. In a study on the effects of long-term exposure of simulated microgravity on non-pathogenic &quot;E. coli&quot;, the results showed transposon insertions occur at loci, linked to SOS stress response. When the same &quot;E. coli&quot; strain was exposed to a combination of simulated microgravity and trace (background) levels of (the broad spectrum) antibiotic (chloramphenicol), the results showed transposon-mediated rearrangements (TMRs), disrupting genes involved in bacterial adhesion, and deleting an entire segment of several genes involved with motility and chemotaxis. Both these studies have implications for microbial growth, adaptation to and antibiotic resistance in real time space conditions.

Horizontal gene transfer is particularly active in bacterial genomes around the production of secondary or specialized metabolites. This is clearly exhibited within certain groups of bacteria including &quot;P. aeruginosa&quot; and &quot;actinomycetales&quot;, an order of &quot;Actinomycetota.&quot; Certain areas of genes known as hotspots further increase the likelihood of horizontally transferred secondary metabolite-producing genes. 

===Bacterial transformation===

Natural transformation is a bacterial adaptation for DNA transfer (HGT) that depends on the expression of numerous bacterial genes whose products are responsible for this process. In general, transformation is a complex, energy-requiring developmental process. In order for a bacterium to bind, take up and recombine exogenous DNA into its chromosome, it must become competent, that is, enter a special physiological state. Competence development in &quot;Bacillus subtilis&quot; requires expression of about 40 genes. The DNA integrated into the host chromosome is usually (but with infrequent exceptions) derived from another bacterium of the same species, and is thus homologous to the resident chromosome. The capacity for natural transformation occurs in at least 67 prokaryotic species.
Competence for transformation is typically induced by high cell density and/or nutritional limitation, conditions associated with the stationary phase of bacterial growth. Competence appears to be an adaptation for DNA repair. Transformation in bacteria can be viewed as a primitive sexual process, since it involves interaction of homologous DNA from two individuals to form recombinant DNA that is passed on to succeeding generations. Although transduction is the form of HGT most commonly associated with bacteriophages, certain phages may also be able to promote transformation.

===Bacterial conjugation===
As mentioned before, conjugation is a method of horizontal gene transfer through cell to cell contact. Through the process of conjugation, type IV Secretion Systems (T4SS) are used to passage on DNA from the donor cell to the recipient cell. These T4SS encoded within the plasmid carry other proteins and genes that help supplement the cell in conjugation. Research has shown that there are Single Binding DNA Binding proteins (SSBs) also encoded within the conjugative plasmid may help with conjugation and cell viability. This is thought to be the case because SSBs naturally are expressed to help with stabilizing single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). SSBs will also recruit other proteins like RadD or RecA expressed in events of DNA recombination, repair, and replication. Further showcasing their possible role in conjugation. Although it may help, studies have also shown for proteins like SSB to not be essential in conjugation. For example, the plasmid pCF10 from &quot;Enterococcus faecalis&quot;, a gram-positive bacterium, has a SSB like-protein called PrgE and was classified for not being required for conjugation. More work needs to be done on why proteins that bind to ssDNA are encoded into conjugative plasmids.

Conjugation in the case of microbiomes and symbioses is very important. From this process new genes are acquired that lead to increasing genetic diversity and evolution such as the acquisition of antibiotic resistance genes. &quot;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&quot; is a species that has evolved through methods like conjugation while gaining antibiotic resistance. This evolution or increase in genetic diversity is also seen in many other species. Due to this, there is a huge concern on how impactful conjugation or horizontal gene transfer can be on human health and your microbiome as pathogenic microbes can become more pathogenic. Studies have shown that even our own microbiome has a plethora of antimicrobial genes which if transferred to pathogenic microbes could be detrimental.

Conjugation in &quot;Mycobacterium smegmatis&quot;, like conjugation in &quot;E. coli&quot;, requires stable and extended contact between a donor and a recipient strain, is DNase resistant, and the transferred DNA is incorporated into the recipient chromosome by homologous recombination. However, unlike &quot;E. coli&quot; high frequency of recombination conjugation (Hfr), mycobacterial conjugation is a type of HGT that is chromosome rather than plasmid based. Furthermore, in contrast to &quot;E. coli&quot; (Hfr) conjugation, in &quot;M. smegmatis&quot; all regions of the chromosome are transferred with comparable efficiencies. Substantial blending of the parental genomes was found as a result of conjugation, and this blending was regarded as reminiscent of that seen in the meiotic products of sexual reproduction.

===Archaeal DNA transfer===

Haloarchaea are aerobic halophiles thought to have evolved from anaerobic methanogens. A large amount of their genome, 126 composite gene families, are derived from genetic material from bacterial genomes. This has allowed them to adapt to extremely salty environments.

The archaeon &quot;Sulfolobus solfataricus&quot;, when UV irradiated, strongly induces the formation of type IV pili which then facilitates cellular aggregation. Exposure to chemical agents that cause DNA damage also induces cellular aggregation. Other physical stressors, such as temperature shift or pH, do not induce aggregation, suggesting that DNA damage is a specific inducer of cellular aggregation.

UV-induced cellular aggregation mediates intercellular chromosomal HGT marker exchange with high frequency, and UV-induced cultures display recombination rates that exceed those of uninduced cultures by as much as three orders of magnitude. &quot;S. solfataricus&quot; cells aggregate preferentially with other cells of their own species. Frols et al. and Ajon et al. suggested that UV-inducible DNA transfer is likely an important mechanism for providing increased repair of damaged DNA via homologous recombination. This process can be regarded as a simple form of sexual interaction.

Another thermophilic species, &quot;Sulfolobus acidocaldarius&quot;, is able to undergo HGT. &quot;S. acidocaldarius&quot; can exchange and recombine chromosomal markers at temperatures up to 84 °C. UV exposure induces pili formation and cellular aggregation. Cells with the ability to aggregate have greater survival than mutants lacking pili that are unable to aggregate. The frequency of recombination is increased by DNA damage induced by UV-irradiation and by DNA damaging chemicals.

The &quot;ups&quot; operon, containing five genes, is highly induced by UV irradiation. The proteins encoded by the &quot;ups&quot; operon are employed in UV-induced pili assembly and cellular aggregation leading to intercellular DNA exchange and homologous recombination. Since this system increases the fitness of &quot;S. acidocaldarius&quot; cells after UV exposure, Wolferen et al. considered that transfer of DNA likely takes place in order to repair UV-induced DNA damages by homologous recombination.

==Eukaryotes==
&quot;Sequence comparisons suggest recent horizontal transfer of many genes among diverse species including across the boundaries of phylogenetic &#x27;domains&#x27;. Thus determining the phylogenetic history of a species can not be done conclusively by determining evolutionary trees for single genes.&quot;

=== Organelle to nuclear genome ===
*Analysis of DNA sequences suggests that horizontal gene transfer has occurred within eukaryotes from the chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes to the nuclear genome. As stated in the endosymbiotic theory, chloroplasts and mitochondria probably originated as bacterial endosymbionts of a progenitor to the eukaryotic cell.

=== Organelle to organelle ===
*Mitochondrial genes moved to parasites of the Rafflesiaceae plant family from their hosts and from chloroplasts of a still-unidentified plant to the mitochondria of the bean &quot;Phaseolus&quot;.

=== Bacteria to fungi ===
*Horizontal transfer occurs from bacteria to some fungi, such as the yeast &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot;.

=== Bacteria to plants===
* Agrobacterium, a pathogenic bacterium that causes cells to proliferate as crown galls and proliferating roots is an example of a bacterium that can transfer genes to plants and this plays an important role in plant evolution.
* Land plants and their close relatives, the charophycean green algae, share a set of glycosyl hydrolases. These enzymes were likely transferred from bacteria and fungi to the last common ancestor of these organisms before the origin of land plants.

=== Bacteria to animals ===
*HhMAN1 is a gene in the genome of the coffee berry borer (&quot;Hypothenemus hampei&quot;) that resembles bacterial genes, and is thought to be transferred from bacteria in the beetle&#x27;s gut.
*oskar is an essential gene for the specification of the germline in Holometabola and its origin is through to be due to a HGT event followed by a fusion with a LOTUS domain.
*Bdelloid rotifers currently hold the &#x27;record&#x27; for HGT in animals with ~8% of their genes from bacterial origins. Tardigrades were thought to break the record with 17.5% HGT, but that finding was an artifact of bacterial contamination.
*A study found the genomes of 40 animals (including 10 primates, four &quot;Caenorhabditis&quot; worms, and 12 &quot;Drosophila&quot; insects) contained genes which the researchers concluded had been transferred from bacteria and fungi by horizontal gene transfer. The researchers estimated that for some nematodes and Drosophila insects these genes had been acquired relatively recently.
*A bacteriophage-mediated mechanism transfers genes between prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Nuclear localization signals in bacteriophage terminal proteins (TP) prime DNA replication and become covalently linked to the viral genome. The role of virus and bacteriophages in HGT in bacteria, suggests that TP-containing genomes could be a vehicle of inter-kingdom genetic information transference all throughout evolution.
*The adzuki bean beetle has acquired genetic material from its (non-beneficial) endosymbiont &quot;Wolbachia&quot;. New examples have recently been reported demonstrating that Wolbachia bacteria represent an important potential source of genetic material in arthropods and filarial nematodes.
*The psyllid &quot;Pachypsylla venusta&quot; has acquired genes from its current endosymbiont &quot;Carsonella&quot;, and from many of its historical endosymbionts, too.

=== Plant to plant ===
*&quot;Striga hermonthica&quot;, a parasitic eudicot, has received a gene from sorghum (&quot;Sorghum bicolor&quot;) to its nuclear genome. The gene&#x27;s functionality is unknown.
*A gene that allowed ferns to survive in dark forests came from the hornwort, which grows in mats on streambanks or trees. The neochrome gene arrived about 180 million years ago.
*Transfer of mRNA between host plants and heterotrophs plants in the Orobanchaceae have been directly observed. mRNA transcripts can therefore be a factor involved in the transfer and integration of foreign DNA in heterotrophs.

=== Plants to animals ===
*The eastern emerald sea slug &quot;Elysia chlorotica&quot; has been suggested by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis to contain photosynthesis-supporting genes obtained from an algae (&quot;Vaucheria litorea)&quot; in their diet. LGT in Sacoglossa is now thought to be an artifact and no trace of LGT was found upon sequencing the genome of &quot;Elysia chlorotica&quot;.
*The whitefly &quot;Bemisia tabaci&quot; acquired a plant detoxification gene that neutralizes plant toxins.

=== Plant to fungus ===

* Gene transfer between plants and fungi has been posited for a number of cases, including rice (&quot;Oryza sativa&quot;).
* Evidence of gene transfer from plants was documented in the fungus &quot;Colletotrichum.&quot;
* Plant expansin genes were transferred to fungi further enabling the fungi to infect plants.

=== Plant to bacteria ===
* Plant expansin genes were transferred to bacteria further enabling the bacteria to infect plants.

=== Fungi to insects ===
*Pea aphids (&quot;Acyrthosiphon pisum&quot;) contain multiple genes from fungi. Plants, fungi, and microorganisms can synthesize carotenoids, but torulene made by pea aphids is the only carotenoid known to be synthesized by an organism in the animal kingdom.

=== Fungi to fungi ===

* The toxin α-amanitin is found in numerous, seemingly unrelated genera fungi such as &quot;Amanita&quot;, &quot;Lepiota&quot;, and &quot;Galerina&quot;. Two biosynthetic genes involved in the production of α-amanitin are P450-29 and FMO1. Phylogenetic and genetic analyses of these genes strongly indicate that they were transferred between the genera via horizontal gene transfer.
* The ToxA protein (wheat virulence protein) included in a ~14 kb element, containing both coding and non-coding regions was transferred between different fungal wheat patogens: &quot;Parastagonospora nodorum&quot;, &quot;Pyrenophora tritici-repentis&quot;, and &quot;Bipolaris sorokiniana&quot;.
* A large genomic element named &quot;Wallaby,&quot; approximately 500 kb in length, was recently transferred between two Penicillium species used in cheesemaking: &quot;P. camemberti&quot; and &quot;P. roqueforti&quot;. Wallaby contains around 250 genes, including several that are thought to play a role in microbial competition.

=== Fungi to oomycetes ===

* 4 genes from &quot;Magnaporthe grisea&quot;, the rice blast fungus, were suspected to be horizontally transferred from the genus &quot;Phytophthora&quot;, and hypothesized to play a role in the fungus evolution into a plant pathogen. 

=== Oomycetes to fungi ===

* The oomycete species &quot;Phytophthora ramorum&quot;, &quot;Phytophthora sojae&quot;, &quot;Phytophthora infestans&quot;, and &quot;Hyaloperonospora parasitica&quot; were estimated to have 33 horizontal gene transfers from fungi. The transferred genes were hypothesized to be involved in functions that facilitate plant tissues colonization, such as secreted proteins to evade plant immune response and breaking down plant cell walls. 

=== Animals to animals ===

* Smelt fish received antifreeze protein (AFP) gene from herring through a direct horizontal transfer.

=== Animals to bacteria ===

*The strikingly fish-like copper/zinc superoxide dismutase of &quot;Photobacterium leiognathi&quot; is most easily explained in terms of transfer of a gene from an ancestor of its fish host.

=== Human to protozoan ===
*The malaria pathogen &quot;Plasmodium vivax&quot; acquired genetic material from humans that might help facilitate its long stay in the body.

=== Human genome ===
*One study identified approximately 100 of humans&#x27; approximately 20,000 total genes which likely resulted from horizontal gene transfer, but this number has been challenged by several researchers arguing these candidate genes for HGT are more likely the result of gene loss combined with differences in the rate of evolution.

== Compounds found to promote horizontal gene transfer ==
Through research into the growing issue of antibiotic resistance certain compounds have been observed to promote horizontal gene transfer. Antibiotics given to bacteria at non-lethal levels have been known to be a cause of antibiotic resistance but emerging research is now showing that certain non-antibiotic pharmaceuticals (ibuprofen, naproxen, gemfibrozil, diclofenac, propranolol, etc.) also have a role in promoting antibiotic resistance through their ability to promote horizontal gene transfer (HGT) of genes responsible for antibiotic resistance. The transfer of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) through conjugation is significantly accelerated when donor cells with plasmids and recipient cells are introduced to each other in the presence of one of the pharmaceuticals. Non-antibiotic pharmaceuticals were also found to cause some responses in bacteria similar to those responses to antibiotics, such as increasing expression of the genes lexA, umuC, umuD and soxR involved in the bacteria&#x27;s SOS response as well as other genes also expressed during exposure to antibiotics. These findings are from 2021 and due to the widespread use of non-antibiotic pharmaceuticals, more research needs to be done in order to further understanding on the issue.

Alongside non-antibiotic pharmaceuticals, other compounds relevant to antibiotic resistance have been tested such as malachite green, ethylbenzene, styrene, 2,4-dichloroaniline, trioxymethylene, o-xylene solutions, p-nitrophenol (PNP), p-aminophenol (PAP), and phenol (PhOH). It is a global concern that ARGs have been found in wastewater treatment plants Textile wastewater has been found to contain 3- to 13-fold higher abundance of mobile genetic elements than other samples of wastewater. The cause of this is the organic compounds used for textile dying (&quot;o&quot;-xylene, ethylbenzene, trioxymethylene, styrene, 2,4-dichloroaniline, and malachite green) raising the frequency of conjugative transfer when bacteria and plasmid (with donor) are introduced in the presence of these molecules. When textile wastewater combines with wastewater from domestic sewage, the ARGs present in wastewater are transferred at a higher rate due to the addition of textile dyeing compounds increasing the occurrence of HGT.

Other organic pollutants commonly found in wastewater have been the subject of similar experiments. A 2021 study used similar methods of using plasmid in a donor and mixing that with a receptor in the presence of compound in order to test horizontal gene transfer of antibiotic resistance genes but this time in the presence of phenolic compounds. Phenolic compounds are commonly found in wastewater and have been found to change functions and structures of the microbial communities during the wastewater treatment process. Additionally, HGT increases in frequency in the presence of the compounds p-nitrophenol (PNP), p-aminophenol (PAP), and phenol. These compounds result in a 2- to 9-fold increase in HGT (p-nitrophenol being on the lower side of 2-fold increases and p-aminophenol and phenol having a maximum increase of 9-fold). This increase in HGT is on average less than the compounds ibuprofen, naproxen, gemfibrozil, diclofenac, propranolol, o-xylene, ethylbenzene, trioxymethylene, styrene, 2,4-dichloroaniline, and malachite green but their increases is still significant. The study that came to this conclusion is similar to the study on horizontal gene transfer and non-antibiotic pharmaceuticals in that it was done in 2021 and leaves room for more research, specifically in the focus of the study which is activated sludge.

Heavy metals have also been found to promote conjugative transfer of antibiotic resistance genes. The paper that led to the discovery of this was done in 2017 during the emerging field of horizontal gene transfer assisting compound research. Metals assist in the spread of antibiotic resistance through both co-resistance as well as cross-resistance mechanisms. In quantities relevant to the environment, Cu(II), Ag(I), Cr(VI), and Zn(II) promote HGT from donor and receptor strains of E. coli. The presence of these metals triggered SOS response from bacterial cells and made the cells more permeable. These are the mechanisms that make even low levels of heavy metal pollution in the environment impact HGT and therefore the spread of ARGs.

== Promiscuous DNA ==
Promiscuous DNA is a form of horizontal gene transfer that transmits genetic information across organellar barriers. Promiscuous DNA transfer has substantial evidence in its movement across the genome of numerous organisms, from movements in chloroplast to the nucleus, chloroplast to the mitochondria, and mitochondria to the nucleus.

=== History ===
In 1982, R. John Ellis defined this type of transpositional transfer mutation as &quot;intracellular promiscuity&quot;. Ellis further explored the phenomenon of &quot;intracellular promiscuity&quot; through the experiments of David Stern and David Lonsdale, in which genetic transfer between chloroplasts to mitochondria was discovered, aiding in the definition and discovery of promiscuous DNA.

=== Mechanism ===
While much remains to be understood about how promiscuous DNA undergoes movement and transfer, numerous experiments have pointed to plastid sequences, ptDNA, as a key player. Plasmids, with their mobile nature and crucial role in horizontal gene transfer, are seen as a significant element in DNA that exchanges genetic information. This mobility makes ptDNA a potential donor for promiscuous DNA to traverse organellar barriers.

=== Types ===

==== NUMTs ====
NUMTs (nuclear sequences of mitochondrial) are a type of promiscuous DNA that arises from the natural transfer of mitochondria DNA (mtDNA) to the nuclear genome (nDNA). These NUMTs, with their varying frequencies, sizes, and features, contribute to the genetic diversity across all eukaryotes and, in some cases, to diseases among humans.

==== NUPTs ====
NUPTs (nuclear plastid DNA sequences) are a type of promiscuous DNA that arises from the natural transfer of ptDNA (plastid DNA) into nDNA. These fragments of ptDNA, similar to NUMTs in frequency, size, and features, also exhibit variability across species. 

==Artificial horizontal gene transfer==
Genetic engineering is essentially horizontal gene transfer, albeit with synthetic expression cassettes. The Sleeping Beauty transposon system (SB) was developed as a synthetic gene transfer agent that was based on the known abilities of Tc1/mariner transposons to invade genomes of extremely diverse species. The SB system has been used to introduce genetic sequences into a wide variety of animal genomes.

== In evolution ==

Horizontal gene transfer is a potential confounding factor in inferring phylogenetic trees based on the sequence of one gene. For example, given two distantly related bacteria that have exchanged a gene a phylogenetic tree including those species will show them to be closely related because that gene is the same even though most other genes are dissimilar. For this reason, it is often ideal to use other information to infer robust phylogenies such as the presence or absence of genes or, more commonly, to include as wide a range of genes for phylogenetic analysis as possible.

For example, the most common gene to be used for constructing phylogenetic relationships in prokaryotes is the 16S ribosomal RNA gene since its sequences tend to be conserved among members with close phylogenetic distances, but variable enough that differences can be measured. However, in recent years it has also been argued that 16s rRNA genes can also be horizontally transferred. Although this may be infrequent, the validity of 16s rRNA-constructed phylogenetic trees must be reevaluated.

Biologist Johann Peter Gogarten suggests &quot;the original metaphor of a tree no longer fits the data from recent genome research&quot; therefore &quot;biologists should use the metaphor of a mosaic to describe the different histories combined in individual genomes and use the metaphor of a net to visualize the rich exchange and cooperative effects of HGT among microbes&quot;. There exist several methods to infer such phylogenetic networks.

Using single genes as phylogenetic markers, it is difficult to trace organismal phylogeny in the presence of horizontal gene transfer. Combining the simple coalescence model of cladogenesis with rare HGT horizontal gene transfer events suggest there was no single most recent common ancestor that contained all of the genes ancestral to those shared among the three domains of life. Each contemporary molecule has its own history and traces back to an individual molecule cenancestor. However, these molecular ancestors were likely to be present in different organisms at different times.&quot;

===Challenge to the tree of life===
Horizontal gene transfer poses a possible challenge to the concept of the last universal common ancestor (LUCA) at the root of the tree of life that was first formulated by Carl Woese, which led him to propose the Archaea as a third domain of life. Indeed, it was while examining the new three-domain model of life that horizontal gene transfer arose as a complicating issue: &quot;Archaeoglobus fulgidus&quot; was seen as an anomaly with respect to a phylogenetic tree, based upon the encoding for the enzyme HMGCoA reductase; the organism in question is a definite Archaean, with all the cell lipids and transcription machinery that are expected of an Archaean, but whose HMGCoA genes are of bacterial origin. Scientists are broadly agreed on symbiogenesis, that mitochondria in eukaryotes derived from alpha-proteobacterial cells and that chloroplasts came from ingested cyanobacteria, and other gene transfers may have affected early eukaryotes. (In contrast, multicellular eukaryotes have mechanisms to prevent horizontal gene transfer, including separated germ cells.) If there had been continued and extensive gene transfer, there would be a complex network with many ancestors, instead of a tree of life with sharply delineated lineages leading back to a LUCA. However, a LUCA can be identified, so horizontal transfers must have been relatively limited.

Other early HGTs are thought to have happened. The first common ancestor (FUCA), earliest ancestor of LUCA, had other descendants that had their own lineages. These now-extinct sister lineages of LUCA descending from FUCA are thought to have horizontally transferred some of their genes into the genome of early descendants of LUCA.

=== Phylogenetic information in HGT ===
It has been remarked that, despite the complications, the detection of horizontal gene transfers brings valuable phylogenetic and dating information.

The potential of HGT to be used for dating phylogenies has recently been confirmed.

===The chromosomal organization of horizontal gene transfer===

The acquisition of new genes has the potential to disorganize the other genetic elements and hinder the function of the bacterial cell, thus affecting the competitiveness of bacteria. Consequently, bacterial adaptation lies in a conflict between the advantages of acquiring beneficial genes, and the need to maintain the organization of the rest of its genome. Horizontally transferred genes are typically concentrated in only ~1% of the chromosome (in regions called hotspots). This concentration increases with genome size and with the rate of transfer. Hotspots diversify by rapid gene turnover; their chromosomal distribution depends on local contexts (neighboring core genes), and content in mobile genetic elements. Hotspots concentrate most changes in gene repertoires, reduce the trade-off between genome diversification and organization, and should be treasure troves of strain-specific adaptive genes. Most mobile genetic elements and antibiotic resistance genes are in hotspots, but many hotspots lack recognizable mobile genetic elements and exhibit frequent homologous recombination at flanking core genes. Overrepresentation of hotspots with fewer mobile genetic elements in naturally transformable bacteria suggests that homologous recombination and horizontal gene transfer are tightly linked in genome evolution.

===Genes===
There is evidence for historical horizontal transfer of the following genes:
*Lycopene cyclase for carotenoid biosynthesis, between Chlorobiota and &quot;Cyanobacteria&quot;.
*&quot;TetO&quot; gene conferring resistance to tetracycline, between &quot;Campylobacter jejuni&quot;.
*Neochrome, a gene in some ferns that enhances their ability to survive in dim light. Believed to have been acquired from algae sometime during the Cretaceous.
*Transfer of a cysteine synthase from a bacterium into phytophagous mites and Lepidoptera allowing the detoxification of cyanogenic glucosides produced by host plants.
*The LINE1 sequence has transferred from humans to the gonorrhea bacteria.

<text>Drug resistance is the reduction in effectiveness of a medication such as an antimicrobial or an antineoplastic in treating a disease or condition. The term is used in the context of resistance that pathogens or cancers have &quot;acquired&quot;, that is, resistance has evolved. Antimicrobial resistance and antineoplastic resistance challenge clinical care and drive research. When an organism is resistant to more than one drug, it is said to be multidrug-resistant.

The development of antibiotic resistance in particular stems from the drugs targeting only specific bacterial molecules (almost always proteins). Because the drug is &quot;so&quot; specific, any mutation in these molecules will interfere with or negate its destructive effect, resulting in antibiotic resistance. Furthermore, there is mounting concern over the abuse of antibiotics in the farming of livestock, which in the European Union alone accounts for three times the volume dispensed to humans – leading to development of super-resistant bacteria.

Bacteria are capable of not only altering the enzyme targeted by antibiotics, but also by the use of enzymes to modify the antibiotic itself and thus neutralize it. Examples of target-altering pathogens are &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;, vancomycin-resistant enterococci and macrolide-resistant &quot;Streptococcus&quot;, while examples of antibiotic-modifying microbes are &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot; and aminoglycoside-resistant &quot;Acinetobacter baumannii&quot;.

In short, the lack of concerted effort by governments and the pharmaceutical industry, together with the innate capacity of microbes to develop resistance at a rate that outpaces development of new drugs, suggests that existing strategies for developing viable, long-term anti-microbial therapies are ultimately doomed to failure. Without alternative strategies, the acquisition of drug resistance by pathogenic microorganisms looms as possibly one of the most significant public health threats facing humanity in the 21st century. Some of the best alternative sources to reduce the chance of antibiotic resistance are probiotics, prebiotics, dietary fibers, enzymes, organic acids, phytogenics.

Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, and P aeruginosa were the six main causes (73%) of AMR-associated mortality in 2019, according to the 2022 Global Burden of Disease research.

AMR not only causes death and disability, but it also has high financial expenses. AMR may lead to US$ 1 trillion in higher healthcare expenses by 2050 and US$ 1 trillion to US$ 3.4 trillion in annual GDP losses by 2030, according to World Bank estimations. 

== Types ==
Drug, toxin, or chemical resistance is a consequence of evolution and is a response to pressures imposed on any living organism. Individual organisms vary in their sensitivity to the drug used and some with greater fitness may be capable of surviving drug treatment. Drug-resistant traits are accordingly inherited by subsequent offspring, resulting in a population that is more drug-resistant. Unless the drug used makes sexual reproduction or cell-division or horizontal gene transfer impossible in the entire target population, resistance to the drug will inevitably follow. This can be seen in cancerous tumors where some cells may develop resistance to the drugs used in chemotherapy. Chemotherapy causes fibroblasts near tumors to produce large amounts of the protein WNT16B. This protein stimulates the growth of cancer cells which are drug-resistant. MicroRNAs have also been shown to affect acquired drug resistance in cancer cells and this can be used for therapeutic purposes. Malaria in 2012 has become a resurgent threat in South East Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, and drug-resistant strains of &quot;Plasmodium falciparum&quot; are posing massive problems for health authorities. Leprosy has shown an increasing resistance to dapsone.

A rapid process of sharing resistance exists among single-celled organisms, and is termed horizontal gene transfer in which there is a direct exchange of genes, particularly in the biofilm state. A similar asexual method is used by fungi and is called &quot;parasexuality&quot;. Examples of drug-resistant strains are to be found in microorganisms such as bacteria and viruses, parasites both endo- and ecto-, plants, fungi, arthropods, mammals, birds, reptiles, fish, and amphibians.

In the domestic environment, drug-resistant strains of organism may arise from seemingly safe activities such as the use of bleach, tooth-brushing and mouthwashing, the use of antibiotics, disinfectants and detergents, shampoos, and soaps, particularly antibacterial soaps, hand-washing, surface sprays, application of deodorants, sunblocks and any cosmetic or health-care product, insecticides, and dips. The chemicals contained in these preparations, besides harming beneficial organisms, may intentionally or inadvertently target organisms that have the potential to develop resistance.

==Mechanisms==
The four main mechanisms by which microorganisms exhibit resistance to antimicrobials are:
# Drug inactivation or modification: e.g., enzymatic deactivation of &quot;Penicillin&quot; G in some penicillin-resistant bacteria through the production of β-lactamases.
# Alteration of target site: e.g., alteration of PBP — the binding target site of penicillins — in MRSA and other penicillin-resistant bacteria.
# Alteration of metabolic pathway: e.g., some sulfonamide-resistant bacteria do not require para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), an important precursor for the synthesis of folic acid and nucleic acids in bacteria inhibited by sulfonamides. Instead, like mammalian cells, they turn to utilizing preformed folic acid.
# Reduced drug accumulation: by decreasing drug permeability and/or increasing active efflux (pumping out) of the drugs across the cell surface.

===Mechanisms of Acquired Drug Resistance===


== Metabolic cost ==
Biological cost is a measure of the increased energy metabolism required to achieve a function.

Drug resistance has a high metabolic price in pathogens for which this concept is relevant (bacteria, endoparasites, and tumor cells.) In viruses, an equivalent &quot;cost&quot; is genomic complexity. The high metabolic cost means that, in the absence of antibiotics, a resistant pathogen will have decreased evolutionary fitness as compared to susceptible pathogens. This is one of the reasons drug resistance adaptations are rarely seen in environments where antibiotics are absent. However, in the presence of antibiotics, the survival advantage conferred off-sets the high metabolic cost and allows resistant strains to proliferate.

==Treatment==
In humans, the gene ABCB1 encodes MDR1(p-glycoprotein) which is a key transporter of medications on the cellular level. If MDR1 is overexpressed, drug resistance increases. Therefore, ABCB1 levels can be monitored. In patients with high levels of ABCB1 expression, the use of secondary treatments, like metformin, have been used in conjunction with the primary drug treatment with some success.

For antibiotic resistance, which represents a widespread problem nowadays, drugs designed to block the mechanisms of bacterial antibiotic resistance are used. For example, bacterial resistance against beta-lactam antibiotics (such as penicillin and cephalosporins) can be circumvented by using antibiotics such as nafcillin that are not susceptible to destruction by certain beta-lactamases (the group of enzymes responsible for breaking down beta-lactams). Beta-lactam bacterial resistance can also be dealt with by administering beta-lactam antibiotics with drugs that block beta-lactamases such as clavulanic acid so that the antibiotics can work without getting destroyed by the bacteria first. Researchers have recognized the need for new drugs that inhibit bacterial efflux pumps, which cause resistance to multiple antibiotics such as beta-lactams, quinolones, chloramphenicol, and trimethoprim by sending molecules of those antibiotics out of the bacterial cell. Sometimes a combination of different classes of antibiotics may be used synergistically; that is, they work together to effectively fight bacteria that may be resistant to one of the antibiotics alone.

Destruction of the resistant bacteria can also be achieved by phage therapy, in which a specific bacteriophage (virus that kills bacteria) is used.

<doc id="205633" wikidata="Q35465" url="?curid=205633" title="Dyirbal language">
<text>Dyirbal (also &quot;Djirubal&quot;) is an Australian Aboriginal language spoken in northeast Queensland by the Dyirbal people. In 2016, the Australian Bureau of Statistics reported that there were 8 speakers of the language. It is a member of the small Dyirbalic branch of the Pama–Nyungan family. It possesses many outstanding features that have made it well known among linguists.

In the years since the Dyirbal grammar by Robert Dixon was published in 1972, Dyirbal has steadily moved closer to extinction as younger community members have failed to learn it.

==Dialects==
There are many different groups speaking dialects of Dyirbal language. Researcher Robert Dixon estimates that Dyirbal had, at its peak, 10 dialects.

Dialects include:

* Dyirbal (or Jirrbal) spoken by the Dyirbalŋan
* Mamu, spoken by the Waɽibara, Dulgubara, Bagiɽgabara, Dyiɽibara, and Mandubara (There are also different types of Mamu spoken by individual groups, such as Warribara Mamu, and Dulgubara Mamu)
* Giramay (Or Girramay), spoken by the Giramaygan
* Gulŋay (or Gulngay), spoken by the Malanbara
* Dyiru (or Djirru), spoken by the Dyirubagala
* Ngadyan (or Ngadjan), spoken by the Ngadyiandyi
* Walmalbarra

The speakers of these dialects largely regard their dialects as different languages. They were classified as dialects by researcher Robert Dixon, who classified them as such based on linguistic criteria and their similarities, some dialects sharing as much as 90% of their vocabularies. Since the dialects were viewed by speakers as different languages, the language had no formal name, so Dixon assigned the language the name Dyirbal, naming it after Jirrbal, which was the dialect with the largest number of speakers at the time he was studying it.

== Neighbouring languages ==
Languages neighbouring the many Dyirbal dialects include:

* Ngaygungu
* Mbabaram
* Muluriji
* Yidiny
* Warungu
* Warrgamay
* Nyawaygi

==Phonology==
===Consonants===
Dyirbal has only four places of articulation for the stop and nasals, whereas most other Australian Aboriginal languages have five or six. This is because Dyirbal lacks the dental/alveolar/retroflex split typically found in these languages. Like the majority of Australian languages, it does not make a distinction between voiced consonants (, etc.) and voiceless consonants (the corresponding , etc.), respectively. Like Pinyin, standard Dyirbal orthography uses voiced consonants, which seem to be preferred by speakers of most Australian languages since the sounds (which can often be semi-voiced) are closer to English semi-voiced than aspirated .

===Vowels===
The Dyirbal vowel system is typical of Australia, with three vowels: , and , though is realised as in certain environments and can be realised as , also depending on the environment in which the phoneme appears. Thus the actual inventory of sounds is greater than the inventory of phonemes would suggest. Stress always falls on the first syllable of a word and usually on subsequent odd-numbered syllables except the ultima, which is always unstressed. The result of this is that consecutive stressed syllables do not occur.

==Grammar==
The language is best known for its system of noun classes, numbering four in total. They tend to be divided among the following semantic lines:

* I – most animate objects, men
* II – women, water, fire, violence, and exceptional animals
* III – edible fruit and vegetables
* IV – miscellaneous (includes things not classifiable in the first three)

The class usually labelled &quot;feminine&quot; (II) inspired the title of George Lakoff&#x27;s book &quot;Women, Fire, and Dangerous Things&quot;. Some linguists distinguish between such systems of classification and the gendered division of items into the categories of &quot;feminine&quot;, &quot;masculine&quot; and (sometimes) &quot;neuter&quot; that is found in, for example, many Indo-European languages.

Dyirbal shows a split-ergative system. Sentences with a first or second person pronoun have their verb arguments marked for case in a pattern that mimics nominative–accusative languages. That is, the first or second person pronoun appears in the least marked case when it is the subject (regardless of the transitivity of the verb), and in the most marked case when it is the direct object. Thus Dyirbal is morphologically accusative in the first and second persons, but morphologically ergative elsewhere; and it is still always syntactically ergative.

==Taboo==
There used to be in place a highly complex &quot;taboo&quot; system in Dyirbal culture. A speaker was completely forbidden from speaking with his/her mother-in-law, child-in-law, father&#x27;s sister&#x27;s child or mother&#x27;s brother&#x27;s child, and from approaching or looking directly at these people. Speakers were forbidden from speaking with their cross-cousins of the opposite sex due to the fact that those relatives were of the section from which an individual must marry, but were too close of kin to choose as a spouse so the avoidance might have been on the grounds of indicating anyone sexually unavailable.

Furthermore, because marriage typically took place a generation above or below, the cross-cousin of the opposite sex often is a potential mother-in-law or father-in-law. In addition, when within hearing range of taboo relatives a person was required to use a specialized and complex form of the language with essentially the same phonemes and grammar, but with a lexicon that shared no words with the standard language except for four lexical items referring to grandparents on the mother and father&#x27;s side.

The taboo relationship was reciprocal. Thus, an individual was not allowed to speak with one&#x27;s own mother-in-law and it was equally taboo for the mother-in-law to speak to her son-in-law. This relationship also prevailed among both genders such that a daughter-in-law was forbidden to speak to directly or approach her father-in-law and vice versa. This taboo existed, but less strongly enforced, between members of the same sex such that a male individual ought to have used the respectful style of speech in the presence of his father-in-law, but the father-in-law could decide whether or not to use the everyday style of speech or the respectful style in the presence of his son-in-law.

The specialized and complex form of the language, the Dyalŋuy, was used in the presence of the taboo relatives whereas a form referred to in most dialects as Guwal was used in all other circumstances. The Dyalŋuy had one quarter of the amount of lexical items as the everyday language which reduced the semantic content in actual communication in the presence of a taboo relative. For example, in Dyalŋuy the verb &#x27;to ask&#x27; is . In Guwal, &#x27;to ask&#x27; is , &#x27;to invite someone over&#x27; is , &#x27;to invite someone to accompany one&#x27; is and &#x27;to keep asking after having already been told&#x27; is . There are no correspondences to the other 3 verbs of Guwal in Dyalŋuy.

To get around this limitation, Dyirbal speakers use many syntactic and semantic tricks to make do with a minimal vocabulary which reveals a lot to linguists about the semantic nature of Dyirbal. For example, Guwal makes use of lexical causatives, such as and . This is similar to English &quot;He broke the glass&quot; (transitive) vs. &quot;The glass broke.&quot; (intransitive). Since Dyirbal has fewer lexemes, a morpheme is used as an intransitive derivational suffix. Thus the Dyalŋuy equivalents of the two words above were transitive and intransitive .

The lexical items found in Dyalŋuy were mainly derived from three sources: &quot;borrowings from the everyday register of neighbouring dialects or languages, the creation of new [Dyalŋuy] forms by phonological deformation of lexemes from the language&#x27;s own everyday style, and the borrowing of terms that were already in the [Dyalŋuy] style of a neighboring language or dialect&quot;.

An example of borrowing between dialects is the word for sun in the Yidin and Ngadyan dialects. In Yidin, the Guwal style word for sun is [buŋan], and this same word was also the Dyalŋuy style of the word for sun in the Ngadyan dialect. It is hypothesized that children of Dyirbal tribes were expected to acquire the Dyalŋuy speech style years following their acquisition of the everyday speech style from their cross cousins who would speak in Dyalŋuy in their presence. By the onset of puberty, the child probably spoke Dyalŋuy fluently and was able to use it in the appropriate contexts. This phenomenon, commonly called mother-in-law languages, was common in indigenous Australian languages. It existed until about 1930, when the taboo system fell out of use.

== Young Dyirbal ==
In the 1970s, speakers of Dyirbal and Giramay dialects purchased land in the Murray Upper, with the assistance of the Australian federal government and formed a community. Within this community shift in language began to occur, and with it came the emergence of new form of Dyirbal, dubbed by researcher Annette Schmidt &quot;Young Dyirbal&quot; or &quot;YD&quot;. This language stands in contrast to &quot;Traditional Dyirbal&quot; or &quot;TD&quot;.

Young Dyirbal is grammatically distinct from Traditional Dyirbal, in some cases being more similar to English, such as the gradual loss of ergative inflection, as is found in Traditional Dyirbal, in favour of a style of inflection more similar to the one found in English.

<doc id="205635" wikidata="Q904519" url="?curid=205635" title="Mac OS 9">
<text>Mac OS 9 is the ninth and final major release of Apple&#x27;s classic Mac OS operating system, which was succeeded by Mac OS X 10.0 in 2001, starting the Mac OS X family of operating systems. Introduced on October 23, 1999, it was promoted by Apple as &quot;The Best Internet Operating System Ever&quot;, highlighting Sherlock 2’s Internet search capabilities, integration with Apple&#x27;s free online services known as iTools and improved Open Transport networking. While Mac OS 9 lacks protected memory and full pre-emptive multitasking, lasting improvements include the introduction of an automated Software Update engine and support for multiple users.

Apple discontinued development of Mac OS 9 in late 2001, transitioning all future development to Mac OS X. The final updates to Mac OS 9 addressed compatibility issues with Mac OS X while running in the Classic Environment and compatibility with Carbon applications. At the 2002 Worldwide Developers Conference, Steve Jobs began his keynote address by staging a mock funeral for OS 9.

==Features==
Apple billed Mac OS 9 as including &quot;50 new features&quot; and heavily marketed its Sherlock 2 software, which introduced a &quot;channels&quot; feature for searching different online resources and introduced a QuickTime-like metallic appearance. Mac OS 9 also featured integrated support for Apple&#x27;s suite of Internet services known as iTools (later re-branded as .Mac, then MobileMe, which was replaced by iCloud) and included improved TCP/IP functionality with Open Transport 2.5.

Other features new to Mac OS 9 include:

*Integrated support for multiple user accounts without using At Ease.
*Support for voice login through VoicePrint passwords.
*Keychain, a feature allowing users to save passwords and textual data encrypted in protected keychains.
*A Software Update control panel for automatic download and installation of Apple system software updates.
*A redesigned Sound control panel and support for USB audio.
*Speakable Items 2.0, also known as PlainTalk, featuring improved speech synthesis and recognition along with AppleScript integration.
*Improved font management through FontSync.
*Remote Access Personal Server 3.5, including support for TCP/IP clients over Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP).
*An updated version of AppleScript with support for TCP/IP.
*Personal File Sharing over TCP/IP.
*USB Printer Sharing, a control panel allowing certain USB printers to be shared across a TCP/IP network.
*128-bit file encryption in the Finder.
*Support for files larger than 2 GB.
*Unix volume support.
*CD Burning in the Finder (introduced in Mac OS 9.1).
*Addition of a &quot;Window&quot; menu to the Finder (introduced in Mac OS 9.1)

==Mac OS 9 and the Classic Environment==

PowerPC versions of Mac OS X prior to 10.5 Leopard include a compatibility layer called Classic, enabling users to run applications and hardware requiring Mac OS 9 from within OS X. This is achieved through running Mac OS 9 without access to its Finder inside OS X. This requires Mac OS 9 to be installed on the machine, even though most Macs that can run the Classic environment are not necessarily able to boot into Mac OS 9 natively. Some Mac OS 9 applications do not run well in Classic; they demonstrate screen redraw problems and lagging performance. In addition, some drivers and other software which directly interact with the hardware fail to work properly.

In May 2002, at Apple&#x27;s Worldwide Developers Conference in San Jose, California, Steve Jobs, accompanied by a coffin, held a mock funeral to announce that Apple had stopped the development of Mac OS 9. The final version of Mac OS 9 and the &quot;classic&quot; Mac OS was Mac OS 9.2.2, released in December 2001.

In June 2005, Jobs announced that the Macintosh platform would be transitioning to Intel x86 microprocessors. Developer documentation of the Rosetta PowerPC emulation layer revealed that applications written for Mac OS 8 or 9 would not run on x86-based Macs. The Classic Environment remains in the PowerPC version of 10.4 Tiger; however, x86 versions of OS X and the PowerPC version of 10.5 Leopard do not support the Classic environment.

Mac OS 9 can be emulated by using SheepShaver, a PowerPC emulator available on multiple operating systems. It can be run on any machine with a supported CPU platform, including Intel-based Macs. Initially, it required an actual PowerPC processor present in the machine it was running on similar to a hypervisor, but support for x86 platforms was added at a later date. SheepShaver cannot run Mac OS versions newer than 9.0.4, however, as it does not have support for a memory management unit. The PearPC PowerPC emulator does not support Mac OS 9. QEMU has experimental support for running Mac OS 9 using PowerPC G4 emulation.

==Mac OS 9 and other Mac computers==
As late as 2004, Mac OS 9 continued to be preinstalled on some Macs despite its development being stopped in late 2001, especially for Macs equipped with a PowerPC G4 processor. Most G4 Macs made prior to 2003 had both Mac OS 9 and Mac OS X preinstalled alongside each other in a dual-boot configuration (with Mac OS X being selected as the default), and both operating systems can be accessed by a boot menu accessible upon startup.

The final Macs released that were able to boot into Mac OS 9 natively without resorting to the Classic environment were the 867 MHz—1.25 GHz &quot;Mirrored Drive Doors&quot; Power Mac G4 released in August 2002 (which was re-released in June 2003 due to a perceived demand for Mac OS 9 machines) and the 867 MHz—1 GHz &quot;Antimony&quot; titanium PowerBook G4 (&quot;TiBook&quot;) released in November 2002. The &quot;Mirrored Drive Doors&quot; Power Mac G4 was one of the last Mac models overall to officially boot into Mac OS 9 while the &quot;Antimony&quot; titanium PowerBook G4 was the last PowerBook model able to run Mac OS 9 natively. While these final models of the Macs and PowerBooks have G4 processors with faster clock speeds of up to 1.25 GHz and 1 GHz respectively on some models, they were able to boot into Mac OS 9 natively without any issues.

The majority of G4 Macs released in 2003 onwards that have a 1 GHz or higher processor never had their &quot;Mac OS ROM&quot; boot files updated to allow those Macs to officially boot into Mac OS 9 natively outside of the Classic environment. All G5 Macs are unable to boot into Mac OS 9 directly because support for PowerPC G5 processors is not available at all on Mac OS 9 (Mac OS 9 only supports G3 and G4 processors as of Mac OS 9.2.2) and therefore can only run Mac OS 9 under the Classic environment or other emulation software.

In recent years, unofficial patches for Mac OS 9 and the &quot;Mac OS ROM&quot; have been made to allow unsupported G4 Macs to boot into Mac OS 9 natively; this practice is not officially supported by Apple.

==Other uses==
Aside from Apple-branded hardware that can be maintained and operated, Mac OS 9 can also be operated in other environments such as Windows and Unix. This includes the aforementioned SheepShaver software mentioned above. While it does provide PowerPC processor support, especially on Intel-based Macs, it can only run up to Mac OS 9.0.4 because it does not emulate a memory management unit. QEMU is another piece of software that has PowerPC emulation and is able to run all versions of Mac OS 9 up to Mac OS 9.2.2.

==Version history==
Updates to Mac OS 9 include 9.0.4, 9.1, 9.2.1, and 9.2.2. Mac OS 9.0.4 was a collection of bug fixes primarily relating to USB and FireWire support. Mac OS 9.1 included integrated CD burning support in the Macintosh Finder and added a new Window menu in the Finder for switching between open windows. Mac OS 9.2 increased performance noticeably and improved Classic Environment support.

<text>Cielos del Sur S.A., operating as Austral Líneas Aéreas, was a domestic airline of Argentina, the sister company of Aerolíneas Argentinas. It was the second-largest domestic scheduled airline in the country, after Aerolíneas Argentinas. As a subsidiary of Aerolíneas Argentinas, the company shared its headquarters with that airline, which is located in the Aeroparque Jorge Newbery of Buenos Aires, the main base of operations of the company.

Austral was fully integrated into Aerolíneas Argentinas; however, some differences arose, especially those relying upon the unions the staff of both companies are affiliated to, which led to constant conflicts. In May 2020 it was announced that Austral would merge with Aerolíneas, saving an estimated 100 million US Dollars and eliminating Austral as a brand. Austral ended operations on 30 November 2020.

, the airline operated an all-Embraer 190 fleet.

== History ==
The origins of the carrier trace back to 1957, when &quot;Compañía Austral de Transportes Aéreos SACI (CATASACI)&quot; was founded, starting scheduled services in . CATASACI focused its services on southwestern Argentina, but it also operated international flights to Montevideo, Puerto Montt and Punta Arenas. &quot;Aerotransportes Litoral Argentino (ALA)&quot; was a Rosario–based company that was founded in 1957 to operate flights between this city and Buenos Aires using Aero Commander equipment and operated flights within northern Argentina. In 1965, Pan Am acquired a 22% stake in ALA in return for supplying the company with DC-3s. A year later, CATASACI acquired a 30% holding in ALA and the services of both companies were integrated.
At , the ALA fleet consisted of two C-46s, five DC-3s, two DC-6Bs and five YS-11A-300s that served a domestic network including Buenos Aires, Corrientes, Formosa, Goya, Paraná, Paso de los Libres, Posadas, Resistencia, Rosario, Salta, Santa Fe and Tucumán, plus regional services to Antofagasta and Asunción, whereas CATASACI had a fleet that included seven BAC One-Elevens —four 400s and three 500s—, one C-46, one DC-6 and three YS-11s. &quot;Austral Líneas Aéreas&quot; was formally established in that year from the merger of CATASACI and ALA. In practice, operations of the latter airline were absorbed by CATASACI, which was rebranded as &quot;Austral Líneas Aéreas S.A.&quot; after merging. Austral inherited both companies&#x27; fleet, consisting of turboprops NAMC YS-11 and jetliners BAC One-Eleven.


Austral became a government-owned company in 1980. After poor economic performances, there were two failed attempts to re-privatise Austral in 1981 and 1983. All that time Austral and Aerolíneas Argentinas were competitors on a number of domestic routes. Realizing that such a situation could not persist much longer, the government decided again to privatise Austral. This was much resisted by the Aerolíneas Argentinas&#x27; personnel, and more specifically its pilots, who claimed their salaries were lower than those of Austral&#x27;s counterparts. Aerolíneas Argentinas&#x27; pilots union understood the government effort was not to solve their affiliates salary conflict, but to focus on privatising a loss-making carrier as Austral was instead. The consequence of this discrepance was the announcement that Aerolíneas Argentinas flights were to be indefinitely suspended by way of a strike, effective 1 July 1986. The strike affected both Aerolineas Argentinas&#x27; domestic and international operations. Argentine as well as foreign carriers were benefited from this strike. Ironically, Austral was included among those carriers, gaining the domestic market share Aerolíneas Argentinas lost.

Austral became once again a privately owned firm when it was acquired by the holding company Cielos del Sur S.A. in late 1987. The acquisition generated some controversy on the Argentine aviation sector at that time, as it was raised that the new owner had little or no experience in managing an airline. In April 1988, the carrier became an IATA member. Shortly afterwards, the company faced a major accident during its new private era on 12 June 1988, when a McDonnell Douglas MD-81 hit a tree on a low visibility approach into Posadas and crashed. Apart from the 22 fatalities involved in the accident, it also spread concerns on the aviation sector over the airline&#x27;s poor rate of occupation on some routes, of just 10.32% for this particular flight.

Cielos del Sur S.A. and Iberia formed a consortium to acquire an 85% stake in Aerolíneas Argentinas in 1990, within the framework of that flag carrier privatisation. Soon afterwards, Cielos del Sur S.A. sold Austral to Iberia. The destiny of both Aerolíneas Argentinas and Austral became aligned thereafter. By July 1998, the company was 10% owned by its erstwhile competitor Aerolíneas Argentinas.

On 21 July 2008 the Argentine Government took the airline back into state control after acquiring 99.4% of the share capital for an undisclosed price. The remaining 0.6% continues to be owned by the company&#x27;s employees. In September 2008, Argentina&#x27;s Senate approved the nationalization of Aerolíneas Argentinas and its subsidiary Austral Líneas Aéreas on a 46–21 vote in favor of the takeover.

In Aerolíneas Argentinas launched a new paint scheme to revamp the airline&#x27;s image. The new livery resembles the colour blue of Argentina&#x27;s flag and the colour yellow of the sun. As its subsidiary airline, Austral also adopted the new image. Austral&#x27;s livery actually differs from the Aerolíneas Argentinas&#x27; one by a red cheatline only. In the meantime the airline also announced the incorporation of 20 new Embraer 190 to its fleet, receiving the first two of them in September 2010.

== Destinations ==
The &quot;Federal Corridor&quot; (), was a two-way route linking the cities of Bariloche, Buenos Aires, Córdoba, Iguazú, Mendoza and Salta. Although the corridor is commercially run by Aerolíneas Argentinas, the route is operated using Austral equipment.

== Fleet ==

Austral Líneas Aéreas underwent a major fleet renewal. In 2009, the company signed a contract with Embraer for the purchase of 20 Embraer 190s, in a deal worth  million that was 85% financed by BNDES. Two more E-190s were ordered in ; the first of these two aircraft was incorporated into the fleet in .

The airline&#x27;s fleet consisted of the following aircraft ():

<text>The Cheyenne language (, , informal spelling ) is the Native American language spoken by the Cheyenne people, predominantly in present-day Montana and Oklahoma, in the United States. It is part of the Algonquian language family. Like all other Algonquian languages, it has complex agglutinative polysynthetic morphology. This language is considered endangered, at different levels, in both states.

==Classification==
Cheyenne is one of the Algonquian languages, which is a sub-category of the Algic languages. Specifically, it is a Plains Algonquian language. However, Plains Algonquian, which also includes Arapaho and Blackfoot, is an areal rather than genetic subgrouping.

==Geographic distribution==

Cheyenne is spoken on the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation in Montana and in Oklahoma. On the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation in March 2013 there were approximately 10,050 enrolled tribal members, of which about 4,939 resided on the reservation; slightly more than a quarter of the population five years or older spoke a language other than English.

=== Current status ===
The Cheyenne language is considered &quot;definitely endangered&quot; in Montana and &quot;critically endangered&quot; in Oklahoma by the UNESCO. In Montana the number of speakers were about 1700 in 2012 according to the UNESCO. In 2021 there were approximately 300 elderly speakers. In 2021 in Oklahoma there were fewer than 20 elderly speakers. There is no current information on any other state in the United States regarding the Cheyenne language.

The 2017 film &quot;Hostiles&quot; features extensive dialogue in Northern Cheyenne. The film&#x27;s producers hired experts in the language and culture to ensure authenticity.

== Revitalization efforts and education ==
In 1997, the Cultural Affairs Department of Chief Dull Knife College applied to the Administration for Native Americans for an approximately $50,000 language preservation planning grant. The department wanted to use this money to assess the degree to which Cheyenne was being spoken on the Northern Cheyenne Reservation. Following this, the department wanted to use the compiled data to establish long-term community language goals, and to prepare Chief Dull Knife College to implement a Cheyenne Language Center and curriculum guide. In 2015, the Chief Dull Knife College sponsored the 18th Annual Language Immersion Camp. This event was organized into two weeklong sessions, and its aim was to educate the younger generation on their ancestral language. The first session focused on educating 5–10-year-olds, while the second session focused on 11- to 18-year-olds. Certified Cheyenne language instructors taught daily classes. Ultimately, the camp provided approximately ten temporary jobs for fluent speakers on the impoverished reservation. The state of Montana has passed a law that guarantees support for tribal language preservation for Montana tribes. Classes in the Cheyenne language are available at Chief Dull Knife College in Lame Deer, Montana, at Southwestern Oklahoma State University, and at Watonga High School in Watonga, Oklahoma.
There are also holistic approaches to language revitalization taken upon by the Cheyenne people to try and keep their language vital. This is done by recognizing the integrated nature of the Cheyenne language with games, crafts, and ceremony which are integrated in youth and community programs. The language is very often not being taught in the home so instead of just teaching grammar as a revitalization effort, holistic approaches attract more attention from new speakers and educate the new generation and counter language and culture loss.

==Phonology==

===Vowels===
Cheyenne has three basic vowel qualities . The phoneme called here is usually pronounced as a phonetic , and sometimes varies to . 

These vowel qualities take four tones: high tone as in &#x27; ); low tone as in &#x27; ; mid tone as in &#x27; ; and rising tone as in &#x27; . Tones are often not represented in the orthography. Vowels can also be voiceless (e.g. ). The high and low tones are phonemic, while voiceless vowels&#x27; occurrence is determined by the phonetic context, making them allophones of the voiced vowels.

===Consonants===
* The phoneme is realized as in the environment between and (h &gt; s / e _ t). is realized as between and (h &gt; ʃ / e _ k) i.e. – &#x27;alien&#x27;, – &#x27;your daughter&#x27;, – &#x27;his mother&#x27;.
* The digraph represents assibilated ; a phonological rule of Cheyenne is that underlying becomes affricated before an . Therefore, &quot;ts&quot; is not a separate phoneme, but an allophone of . 
* The sound is not a phoneme, but derives from other phonemes, including (when precedes or follows a non-front vowel, or ), and the past tense morpheme which is pronounced when it precedes a morpheme which starts with .

===Orthography===
The Cheyenne orthography of 14 letters is neither a pure phonemic system nor a phonetic transcription; it is, in the words of linguist Wayne Leman, a &quot;pronunciation orthography&quot;. In other words, it is a practical spelling system designed to facilitate proper pronunciation. Some allophonic variants, such as voiceless vowels, are shown. represents the phoneme symbolized , and represents .

====Vowels====

* a – 
* e – 
* o – 

====Consonants====

* h – 
* k – 
* m – 
* n – 
* p – 
* s – 
* š – 
* t – 
* v – 
* x – 

====Tones====
* á, é, ó – high tone
* ȧ, ė, ȯ or â, ê, ô – voiceless or whispered

Low tone is usually unmarked.

=== Feature system for phonemes ===
The systematic phonemes of Cheyenne are distinguished by seven two-valued features. Scholar Donald G. Frantz defined these features as follows:
* Oral: primary articulation is oral (vs. at the glottis)
* Vocoid (voc): central resonant (oral) continuant
* Syllabic (syl): nuclear to syllable (vs. marginal)
* Closure (clos): stoppage of air flow at point of primary articulation [&#x27;non-continuant&#x27;]
* Nasal (nas): velic is open
* Grave (grv): primary articulation at oral extremity (lips or velum) [&#x27;non-coronal&#x27; for consonants, &#x27;back&#x27; for vowels]
* Diffuse (dif): primary articulation is relatively front [&#x27;anterior&#x27;]

0 indicates the value is indeterminable/irrelevant. A blank indicates the value is specifiable, but context is required (even though any value could be inserted because the post-cyclical rules would change the value to the correct one). Parentheses enclose values that are redundant according to the phonological rules; these values simply represent the results of these rules.

=== Voicing ===

Cheyenne has 14 orthographic letters representing 13 phonemes. is written as orthographically but is not a phoneme. This count excludes the results of allophonic devoicing, which are spelled with a dot over vowels. Devoicing naturally occurs in the last vowel of a word or phrase but can also occur in vowels at the penultimate and prepenultimate positions within a word. Non-high and is also usually devoiced preceding &quot;h&quot; followed by a stop. Phonemic is absorbed by a preceding voiceless vowel. Examples are given below.

==== Penultimate devoicing ====
* &#x27;ax&#x27;; 
* &#x27;the one who is big&#x27;;
* &#x27;knife&#x27;

Devoicing occurs when certain vowels directly precede the consonants , , , , or followed by an . The rule is linked to the rule of &quot;e&quot;-epenthesis, which states simply that [e] appears in the environment of a consonant and a word boundary.

==== Prepenultimate devoicing ====
* &#x27;flute&#x27;;
* &#x27;sheep (pl.)&#x27;;
* &#x27;if you ask him&#x27;

A vowel that does not have a high pitch is devoiced if it is followed by a voiceless fricative and not preceded by .

==== Special and devoicing ====
* &#x27;they are gathering&#x27;; 
* &#x27;I regularly dance&#x27;; 
* &#x27;I punched him in the mouth&#x27;

Non-high and become at least partially devoiced when they are preceded by a voiced vowel and followed by an , a consonant, and two or more syllables.

==== Consonant devoicing ====
 &#x27;He is drinking.&#x27;

Before a voiceless segment, a consonant is devoiced.

==== &quot;h&quot;-absorption ====
* &#x27;kind&#x27; + &#x27;imperative suffix&#x27; &gt; 
* &#x27;conjunct prefix&#x27; + &#x27;old&#x27; + &#x27;3rd pers. suffix&#x27; &gt; &#x27;the one who is old&#x27;
* + &#x27;you&#x27; + &#x27;burn&#x27; + &#x27;suffix for some &#x27;you-me&#x27; transitive animate forms&#x27; &gt; &#x27; you burn me&#x27;

The is absorbed if it is preceded or followed by voiceless vowels.

=== Pitch and tone ===
There are several rules that govern pitch use in Cheyenne. Pitch can be ˊ = high, unmarked = low, ˉ = mid, and ˆ = raised high. According to linguist Wayne Leman, some research shows that Cheyenne may have a stress system independent from that of pitch. If this is the case, the stress system&#x27;s role is very minor in Cheyenne prosody. It would have no grammatical or lexical function, unlike pitch.

====High-raising====
A high pitch becomes a raised high when it is not preceded by another high vowel and precedes an underlying word-final high.
* &#x27;duck&#x27;; 
* &#x27;boat&#x27;

====Low-to-high raising====
A low vowel is raised to the high position when it follows a high and is followed by a word final high.
* &#x27;ticks&#x27;; 
* &#x27;I see him&#x27;; 
* &#x27;cat&#x27;

====Low-to-mid raising====
A low vowel becomes a mid when it is followed by a word-final high but not directly preceded by a high vowel.
* &#x27;sheep (sg.)&#x27;; 
* &#x27;woman&#x27;; 
* &#x27;he is cooking&#x27;

===High pushover===
A high vowel becomes low if it comes after a high and followed by a phonetic low.
* &#x27;we (incl) prayed&#x27;; 
* &#x27;we (incl) love him&#x27;; 
* &#x27;we (excl) love&#x27;

====Word-medial high raising====
According to Leman, &quot;some verbal prefixes and preverbs go through the process of Word-Medial High-Raising. A high is raised if it follows a high (which is not a trigger for the High Push-Over rule) and precedes a phonetic low. One or more voiceless syllables may come between the two highs. (A devoiced vowel in this process must be underlyingly low, not an underlyingly high vowel which has been devoiced by the High-Pitch Devoicing rule.)&quot;
* &#x27;he is eating&#x27;; 
* &#x27;when I sang&#x27;; 
* &#x27;I didn&#x27;t give him to him&#x27;

=== Tone ===
Syllables with high pitch (tone) are relatively high pitched and are marked by an acute accent, , , and . The following pairs of phrases demonstrate pitch contrasts in the Cheyenne language: 
* (&#x27;if I am hungry&#x27;)
* (&#x27;if you are hungry&#x27;)
* (&#x27;dog&#x27;)
* (&#x27;dogs&#x27;)
As noted by Donald G. Frantz, phonological rules dictate some pitch patterns, as indicated by the frequent shift of accent when suffixes are added (e.g. compare &#x27;raccoon&#x27; and  &#x27;raccoons&#x27;). In order for the rules to work, certain vowels are assigned inherent accent. For example, the word for &#x27;badger&#x27; has a permanent accent position: (sg.), (pl.)

=== Nonnasal reflexes of Proto-Algonquian *&quot;k&quot; ===
The research of linguist Paul Proulx provides an explanation for how these reflexes develop in Cheyenne: &quot;First, *&quot;n&quot; and *&quot;h&quot; drop and all other consonants give glottal catch before *&quot;k&quot;. *&quot;k&quot; then drops except in element-final position. Next, there is an increment before any remaining *&quot;k&quot; not preceded by a glottal catch: a secondary &quot;h&quot; (replaced by &quot;š&quot; after &quot;e&quot;) ) in words originating in the Cheyenne Proper dialect, and a vowel in those originating in the Sutaio (So&#x27;taa&#x27;e) dialect. In the latter dialect the *&quot;k&quot; gives glottal catch in a word-final syllable (after the loss of some final syllables) and drops elsewhere, leaving the vowel increment. Sutaio k clusters are all reduced to glottal catch.&quot;

==Grammar==
Cheyenne is a morphologically polysynthetic language with a sophisticated, agglutinating verb system contrasting a relatively simple noun structure. Many Cheyenne verbs can stand alone in sentences, and can be translated by complete English sentences. Aside from its verb structure, Cheyenne has several grammatical features that are typical of Algonquian languages, including an animate/inanimate noun classification paradigm, an obviative third person and distinction of clusivity in the first person plural pronoun.

===Order and mode===
Like all Algonquian languages, Cheyenne shows a highly developed modal paradigm. Algonquianists traditionally describe the inflections of verbs in these languages as being divided into three &quot;orders,&quot; with each order further subdivided into a series of &quot;modes,&quot; each of which communicates some aspect of modality. The charts below provide examples of verb forms of every order in each mode, after Leman (2011) and Mithun (1999).

====Independent order====
This order governs both declarative and interrogative statements. The modes of this order are generally subdivided along lines of evidentiality.

====Conjunct order====
This order governs a variety of dependent clause types. Leman (2011) characterizes this order of verbs as requiring other verbal elements in order to establish complete meaning. Verbs in the conjunct order are marked with a mode-specific prefix and a suffix marking person, number and animacy.

====Imperative order====
The third order governs commands. Cheyenne, in common with several other North American languages, distinguishes two types of imperative mood, one indicating immediate action, and the other indicating delayed action.

===Verb morphology===
The Cheyenne verb system is very complex and verb constructions are central to the morphosyntax of the language, to the point that even adjectives and even some nouns are largely substantive in nature. Verbs change according to a number of factors, such as modality, person and transitivity, as well as the animacy of the referent, each of these categories being indicated by the addition of an affix to the basic verb stem. There are also several instrumental, locative and adverbial affixes that add further information to the larger verb construction. This can result in very long, complex verbs that are able to stand alone as entire sentences in their own right.
All Cheyenne verbs have a rigid templatic structure. The affixes are placed according to the following paradigm:

person – (tense) – (directional) – (preverb) – ROOT – (medial) – final

====Pronominal affixes====
Cheyenne represents the participants of an expression not as separate pronoun words but as affixes on the verb. There are three basic pronominal prefixes in Cheyenne:
*first person
*second person
*third person

These three basic prefixes can be combined with various suffixes to express all of Cheyenne&#x27;s pronominal distinctions. For example, the prefix can be combined on a verb with the suffix -me to express the first person plural exclusive.

====Tense====
Tense in Cheyenne is expressed by the addition of a specific tense morpheme between the pronominal prefix and the verb stem. Verbs do not always contain tense information, and an unmarked present tense verb can be used to express both past and &quot;recent&quot; present tense in conversation. Thus, could mean both &#x27;I see him&#x27; and &#x27;I saw him&#x27; depending on the context.

Far past tense is expressed by the morpheme , which changes to , , or before the -h, -t, -k and a vowel, respectively. Thus:
* 

Similarly, the future tense is expressed by the morpheme , which changes to after the pronominal, after and in the third-person, with the third-person prefix dropped altogether.

====Directional affixes====
These prefixes address whether the action of the verb is moving &quot;toward&quot; or &quot;away from&quot; some entity, usually the speaker.

*toward
*toward (before -h)
*toward (before a vowel)
*toward (before -t)
*away from

====Preverbs====
Following Algonquianist terminology, Leman (2011) describes &quot;preverbs&quot;, morphemes which add adjectival or adverbial information to the verb stem. Multiple preverbs can be combined within one verb complex. The following list represents only a small sample.

*secretly
*previously 
*suddenly
*extremely
*slightly
*regularly
*good, well
*much, a lot
*for the purpose of
*slowly, softly
*mistakenly

====Medial affixes====
This large group of suffixes provide information about something associated with the root, usually communicating that the action is done with or to a body part. Thus: (&#x27;he-wash-mouth&#x27;) = &#x27;he gargled&#x27;. Following is a sample of medial suffixes:

*mouth
*face
*arm
*body 
*hand
*foot

Medial suffixes can also be used with nouns to create compound words or to coin entirely new words from existing morphemes, as in:

 [short-face-dog] = &#x27;bulldog&#x27;

====Final affixes====
Cheyenne verbs take different object agreement endings depending upon the animacy of the subject and the transitivity of the verb itself. Intransitive verbs take endings depending upon the animacy of their subject, whereas transitive verbs take endings that depend upon the animacy of their object. All verbs can therefore be broadly categorized into one of four classes: Animate Intransitive (AI), Inanimate Instransitive (II), Transitive Animate (TA) and Transitive Inanimate (TI). Following are the most common object agreement markers for each verb class.

*Animate Intransitive (AI)
*Inanimate Intransitive (II)
*Transitive Animate (TA)
*Transitive Inanimate (TI)

====Negation====
Verbs are negated by the addition of the infix immediately after the pronominal affix. This morpheme changes to in the absence of a pronominal affix, as occurs in the imperative and in some future tense constructions.

===Nouns===
Nouns are classified according to animacy. They change according to grammatical number (singular and plural) but are not distinguished according to gender or definiteness.

====Obviation====
When two third persons are referred to by the same verb, the object of the sentence becomes obviated, what Algonquianists refer to as a &quot;fourth person.&quot; It is essentially an &quot;out of focus&quot; third person. As with possessive obviation above, the presence of a fourth person triggers morphological changes in both the verb and noun. If the obviated entity is an animate noun, it will be marked with an obviative suffix, typically or . For example:

*                &#x27;I saw a man&#x27;
*  &#x27;The woman saw a man&#x27;

Verbs register the presence of obviated participants whether or not they are present as nouns. These forms could be likened to a kind of passive voice, although Esteban (2012) argues that since Cheyenne is a &quot;reference-dominated language where case marking and word order are governed by the necessity to code pragmatic roles,&quot; a passive-like construction is assumed. This phenomenon is an example of typical Algonquian &quot;person hierarchy,&quot; in which animacy and first personhood take precedence over other forms.

====Number====
Both animate and inanimate nouns are pluralized by the addition of suffixes. These suffixes are irregular and can change slightly according to a complex system of phonological rules.

*, Inanimate plural
*Animate plural

====Possession====
Possession is denoted by a special set of pronominal suffixes. Following is a list of the most common possession prefixes, although rarely some words take different prefixes.
*first person
*second person
*third person

Generally, possessive prefixes take a low pitch on the following vowel.

When a third person animate noun is possessed by another third person, the noun becomes obviated and takes a different form. Much of the time, this obviated form is identical to the noun&#x27;s regular plural form, with only a few exceptions. This introduces ambiguity in that it is not always possible to tell whether an obviated noun is singular or plural.

==Historical development==

Like all the Algonquian languages, Cheyenne developed from a reconstructed ancestor referred to as Proto-Algonquian (often abbreviated &quot;PA&quot;). The sound changes on the road from PA to modern Cheyenne are complex, as exhibited by the development of the PA word &#x27;man&#x27; into Cheyenne :

*First, the PA suffix drops ()
*The geminate vowel sequence simplifies to (semivowels were phonemically vowels in PA; when PA * or * appeared before another vowel, it became non-syllabic) ()
*PA * changes to ()
* is added before word-initial vowels ()
*Due to a vowel chain-shift, the vowels in the word wind up as , and (PA * sometimes corresponds to Cheyenne and sometimes to Cheyenne ; PA * almost always corresponds to Cheyenne , however) ().
PA *&quot;θk&quot; has the Sutaio reflex &#x27; in &#x27;she tells lies&#x27;, but the Cheyenne-Proper reflex &quot;&#x27;k&quot; in &#x27;tree-bark&#x27;. According to linguist Paul Proulx, this gave off the appearance that &quot;speakers of both Cheyenne dialects—perhaps mixed bands—were involved in the Arapaho contact that led to this unusual reflex of PA *k.&quot;.

==Lexicon==
Some Cheyenne words (with the Proto-Algonquian reconstructions where known):
*&quot;&quot; &#x27;grease&#x27; (from PA )
*&quot;&quot; &#x27;his liver&#x27; (from PA &quot;&quot;)
*&quot;&quot; &#x27;woman&#x27; (from PA &quot;&quot;)
*&quot;&quot; &#x27;man&#x27; (from PA )
*&quot;&quot; &#x27;milk&#x27; (from PA &quot;&quot;)

==Translation history==
Early work was done on the Cheyenne language by Rodolphe Charles Petter, a Mennonite missionary based in Lame Deer, Montana, from 1916. Petter published a mammoth dictionary of Cheyenne in 1915.

=== Current translations ===
Currently there are many online resources that allow for the instant translation from any language to the Cheyenne language. There are online vocabulary lists, pronunciation guides, dictionaries, etc. Along with these resources, there are numbers of published books regarding the history of the language that also explain its grammar. These resources can be found online or in libraries that carry these published books.

The latest edition of an online Cheyenne dictionary is accessible from cheyennelanguage.org.

<text>The cakewalk was a dance developed from the &quot;prize walks&quot; (dance contests with a cake awarded as the prize) held in the mid-19th century, generally at get-togethers on black slave plantations before and after emancipation in the Southern United States. Alternative names for the original form of the dance were &quot;chalkline-walk&quot;, and the &quot;walk-around&quot;. It was originally a processional partner dance performed with comical formality, and may have developed as a subtle mockery of the mannered dances of white slaveholders. 

Following an exhibition of the cakewalk at the 1876 Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia, the cakewalk was adopted by performers in minstrel shows, where it was danced exclusively by men until the 1890s. At that point, Broadway shows featuring women began to include cakewalks, and grotesque dances became very popular across the country.

The fluid and graceful steps of the dance may have given rise to the colloquialism that something accomplished with ease is a &quot;cakewalk&quot;.

==As a plantation dance==
===Firsthand accounts===
The cakewalk was influenced by the ring shout, which survived from the 18th into the 20th century. This dance style was often part of African American slaves&#x27; religious ceremonies and involved shuffling the feet counterclockwise in a circle (ring) formation and reciting spirituals in a call-and-response format with others outside of the ring.
There is extensive first-person testimony from emancipated slaves about the culture and dancing they developed among themselves on the plantations, including the dances that developed into the cakewalk. Louise Jones spoke of &quot;Sech dancin&#x27; you never seen before. Slaves would set de flo&#x27; in turns, an&#x27; do de cakewalk mos&#x27; all night.&quot; Georgia Baker said that she sang cakewalk songs as a child, and was amused that as an adult, she &quot;would be cakewalkin&#x27; to de same song.&quot; Estella Jones described nighttime parties with elaborate dress, some of which were attended by the slaveowners, who would judge the dancing and award cakes to the winners.

===Secondhand, oral-tradition accounts===
James Weldon Johnson, born in 1871, recounted a cakewalk at a ball in his 1912 novel &quot;The Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man&quot;.

Some secondhand accounts of the cakewalk describe it as a subtle mockery of the formal, mannered dancing practiced by slaveholding whites. The slaves would dress in handed-down finery and comically exaggerate the poised movements of minuets and waltzes. These accounts describe any slaveowners in attendance as unaware that they were being mocked. One man recalled such a dance that his childhood nanny had described to him: &quot;Sometimes the white folks noticed it, but they seemed to like it; I guess they thought we couldn&#x27;t dance any better.&quot; A 1981 article by Brooke Baldwin concludes that the cakewalk was meant &quot;to satirize the competing culture of supposedly &#x27;superior&#x27; whites. Slaveholders were able to dismiss its threat in their own minds by considering it as a simple performance which existed for their own pleasure&quot;.

Entertainer Tom Fletcher, born in 1873, wrote in 1954 that his grandparents told him about the chalk-line walk/cakewalk as a child, but had no information about its origins. In their version, &quot;there was no prancing, just a straight walk on a path made by turns and so forth, along which the dancers made their way with a pail of water on their heads. The couple that was the most erect and spilled the least water or no water at all was the winner.&quot; He describes it being &quot;revived with fancy steps by Charlie Johnson, a clever eccentric dancer&quot; and becoming known as the &quot;Cake Walk&quot;.

== Alternative explanations ==
It has been suggested that the cakewalk originated in Florida, with the war dances of the Seminole Tribe. Ethel L. Urlin, writing in the book &quot;Dancing, Ancient and Modern&quot; (1912), described these dances as consisting of &quot;wild and hilarious jumping and gyrating, alternating with slow processions in which the dancers walked solemnly in couples,&quot; which he believed grew into the cakewalk style. The &quot;Encyclopedia of Social Dance&quot; echoed this, stating that the dance spread from Florida to Georgia, the Carolinas, Virginia, and eventually New York, with the development of Florida into a winter tourist destination in the 1880s.

The authors of &quot;Jazz Dance: The Story of American Vernacular Dance&quot; reported that an informal experiment with African dancers undertaken in the 1950s turned up &quot;no worthy African counterpart&quot; to the cakewalk. The same book noted eyewitness reports of dances from South Africa, Ghana, and Nigeria that bore a resemblance to the cakewalk, with no elaboration.

In his book &quot;How to Tell a Story and Other Essays&quot; originally published in 1897, Mark Twain briefly mentions the cakewalk: 
Our negroes in America have several ways of entertaining themselves which are not found among the whites anywhere. Among these inventions of theirs is one which is particularly popular with them. It is a competition in elegant deportment. They hire a hall and bank the spectators&#x27; seats in rising tiers along the two sides, leaving all the middle stretch of the floor free. A cake is provided as a prize for the winner in the competition, and a bench of experts in deportment is appointed to award it. Sometimes there are as many as fifty contestants, male and female, and five hundred spectators. One at a time the contestants enter, clothed regardless of expense in what each considers the perfection of style and taste, and walk down the vacant central space and back again with that multitude of critical eyes on them (...) The negroes have a name for this grave deportment-tournament; a name taken from the prize contended for. They call it a Cake-Walk.
== Lack of detail/consistency in explanation of the cakewalk&#x27;s origin ==
It is believed that the satirical nature of the cakewalk led to its being overlooked by archivists. Many of the members of the Federal Writers’ Project of the Works Progress Administration who were tasked with recording information about slave culture assumed that the cakewalk was simply frivolous entertainment. As such, they never asked their interviewees (former slaves) to elaborate on the singing and dancing traditions in which slaves would participate. This runs in opposition to the researchers&#x27; interest in slave spirituals and religious practices, where interviewees were often asked to demonstrate examples from those traditions. As Baldwin argues:The interviewers willingly believed that slaves could express a child-like faith in the white Christian God (whites had not yet guessed at the hidden-revolutionary meanings of spirituals), but they could not conceive of blacks participating in a rich cultural life independent of European forms. Thus they felt no need to press the ex-slaves for further explanations of remarks which hinted that such a culture indeed existed.It is also likely that as the cakewalk was appropriated into white culture, it lost much connection to its history because white people wanted to be fully in charge of it. Even if they had once perceived it as a threat, they were able to dismiss that notion &quot;by considering it as a simple performance which existed merely for their own pleasure. To coopt the cakewalk, physically seize control of it, was within the power of whites who &quot;owned&quot; the blacks with whom they lived.&quot;

Brooke Baldwin&#x27;s 1981 article claims that, failing to successfully turn the cakewalk into a white art form, it instead was heavily degraded by white caricaturists. They spun the narrative of the cakewalk as a mediocre emulation of white culture, further clouding its true origins as satire of slaveowner aristocracy: &quot;Cakewalkers were made to appear ludicrous.&quot; This idea of the cakewalk became so prevalent that for a long time, the &quot;cakewalk clown&quot; was the mainstream view of the dance and black culture as a whole. It is only recently that researchers have begun correcting that perspective to set the record straight.

==Cakewalk in minstrelsy, musicals, and as a popular dance==
Amiri Baraka in &quot;Blues People&quot; explained the strangeness of a slave dance covertly mocking white slaveholders that later was adopted by whites unaware of the mockery: &quot;If the cakewalk is a Negro dance caricaturing certain white customs, what is that dance, when, say, a white theater company attempts to satirize it as a Negro dance? I find the idea of white minstrels in blackface satirizing a dance satirizing themselves a remarkable kind of irony—which, I suppose, is the whole point of minstrel shows.&quot;

An exhibit at the 1876 Philadelphia Centennial featured black people singing folk songs and doing an old dance called the &quot;chalk-line walk&quot; in a plantation-like setting. The dance was &quot;done in the original fashion&quot;, as described by Fletcher.

In 1877, performer-showmen Harrigan and Hart produced &quot;Walking for Dat Cake, An Exquisite Picture of Negro Life and Customs&quot; as a feature sketch at New York&#x27;s Theater Comique on lower Broadway.

Thereafter it was performed in minstrel shows, exclusively by men until the 1890s. In the 1893 production of &quot;The Creole Show&quot;, which ran from 1889 to 1897, Dora Dean and her husband Charles E. Johnson were a hit with their specialty, a cakewalk danced as partners. Their production had an African-American cast, and featured women dancing, which was revolutionary for the time. The inclusion of women &quot;made possible all sorts of improvisations in the Walk, and the original was soon changed into a grotesque dance&quot; which became very popular across the country.

A Grand Cakewalk was held in Madison Square Garden, the largest commercial venue in New York City, on February 17, 1892. The &quot;Illustrated London News&quot; carried an 1897 report of a cakewalk at a barn dance in Ashtabula, Ohio, written by an English woman traveler. This version was more of a procession and less of a dance: &quot;Just before the ball was declared finished a long procession of couples was formed who walked in their very best manner around the room three times before the criticizing eyes of a dozen old people, who selected the best turned-out pair, and gravely presented them with a large plum cake.

In July 1898, the musical comedy &quot;&quot; opened on Broadway in New York. Will Marion Cook wrote ragtime music for the show. Black dancers mingled with white cast members for the first instance of integration on stage in New York. According to Cook, the show was a resounding success: &quot;My chorus sang like Russians, dancing meanwhile like Negroes, and cakewalking like angels, black angels! When the last note was sounded, the audience stood and cheered for at least ten minutes. This was the finale which Witmark had said no one would listen to. It was pandemonium ... But did that audience take offense at my rags and lack of conducting polish? Not so you could notice it!&quot;
&quot;Dusky troopers march &amp; cake walk&quot; was written by Will Hardy and published in 1900.

Scott Joplin mentioned the cake walk in his folk ballet &quot;The Ragtime Dance&quot;, published in 1902.
&lt;poem&gt;
Let me see you do the rag-time dance,
Turn left and do the cakewalk prance,
Turn the other way and do the slow drag –
Now take your lady to the World&#x27;s Fair
And do the rag-time dance.
&lt;/poem&gt;

The French music hall singer and dancer Eugénie Fougère was filmed in 1899 in the rag-time cake-walk &quot;Hello, Ma Baby&quot;, with which she made a sensation at the New York Theatre. She is said to have introduced the dance in Paris (France) in 1900 in the Théâtre Marigny after she returned from a tour in the United States. The ambiguous &quot;cake walk&quot; became very popular quickly and for a few months in 1903, Paris was in the grip of a veritable &#x27;cake-walk craze&#x27; (&quot;folie du cake-walk&quot;). Fougère appeared on the 18 October 1903 cover of &quot;Paris qui Chante&quot; dancing to the song &quot;Oh ! ce cake-walk&quot;. The lyrics interconnected African and American dance, monkeys and epilepsy – reflecting the racist and colonial attitudes that prevailed at the time.

Performances of the &quot;Cake Walk&quot;, including a &quot;Comedy Cake Walk&quot; were filmed by the American Mutoscope and Biograph Company in 1903. Prancing steps were the main steps shown in the &quot;Cake Walk&quot; segment, which featured two couples, and a solo dancer. All dancers were African-American. 1903 was the same year that both the cakewalk and ragtime music arrived in Buenos Aires, Argentina, which may have influenced early styles of tango.

&quot;Cakewalk King&quot; Charles E. Johnson, who, with his wife Dora Jean, achieved fame cakewalking throughout the United States and Europe described his kind of dance as &quot;simple, dignified and well-dressed&quot;.

==Cakewalk as a musical form==

Most cakewalk music is notated in time signature with two alternate heavy beats per bar, giving it an oompah rhythm. The music was adopted into the works of various composers, including Robert Russell Bennett, John Philip Sousa, Claude Debussy and Louis Moreau Gottschalk. Debussy wrote &quot;Golliwogg&#x27;s Cake-walk&quot; as the final movement of his &quot;Children&#x27;s Corner&quot; suite for piano (published 1908), and &quot;The Little Nigar&quot;, subtitled &quot;A Cakewalk&quot;, for a piano method in 1909. The Cake Walk dance originated from the two-step, a dance which was itself spawned by the popularity of Sousa&#x27;s marches. Although it featured more improvisation than the two-step, it was still very formal compared to later African-American dances such as the Charleston, Black Bottom and Lindy Hop.

Cakewalk music incorporated polyrhythm, syncopation, and the habanera rhythm into the regular march rhythm.

The cakewalk style eventually gave way to the creation of coon songs, which used cakewalk music and stereotypical lyrics to create musical caricatures of African American culture. Titles included &quot;Rastus on Parade&quot;, &quot;De Darkey Cavaliers&quot;, and &quot;Kullud Koons&#x27; Kake Walk&quot;. These songs were &quot;infectiously popular&quot;, and they allowed for African American musical virtuosity to be well-received at the same time as the stereotypes portrayed by the music.

==Modern times==

The American English term &quot;cakewalk&quot; was used as early as 1863 to indicate something that is very easy or effortless, although this metaphor may refer to the carnival game of the same name in referring to the fact that the latter&#x27;s winners obtain their prize by doing no more than walking around in a circle. Though the dance itself could be physically demanding, it was generally considered a fun, recreational pastime, covertly mocking slaveholder dance parties. The phrase &quot;takes the cake&quot; also comes from this practice, as could &quot;piece of cake&quot;.

One version of the cakewalk is sometimes taught, performed and included in competitions within the Scottish-inspired Highland dance community, especially in the southern United States. In 2021, the Royal Scottish Official Board of Highland Dancing ruled to remove the dance from competition on the basis that it was derogatory to persons of color.

A version of the cakewalk seen in vintage film clips from the early 1900s is kept alive in the Lindy Hop community through performances by the Hot Shots and through cakewalk classes held in conjunction with Lindy Hop classes and workshops.

Judy Garland and Margaret O&#x27;Brien perform a cakewalk in the 1944 MGM musical &quot;Meet Me in St. Louis&quot;.

==Fairground ride==
The original cakewalk dance inspired a fairground ride. The ride consists of two sides, customers walk along one side, around the end and back down the other. Each side has a central bridge mounted on cranks which give it an up and down motion as well as to and fro. On each end of the bridge section is a gangway and sliding platform. The British rides were often given an American name such as &quot;Old Tyme Brooklyn Cakewalk&quot; or &quot;American Cakewalk&quot; or variations thereon.

The first cakewalk ride is believed to have been built by Plimson and Taylor in 1895. Traditional cakewalks had an organ attached and on some of them if the organ sped up the walk also sped up. Cakewalks, or to be precise the &quot;dancing&quot; customers, were considered to be good spectacles, which drew in more potential customers.

<text>George Henry Borrow (5 July 1803 – 26 July 1881) was an English writer of novels and of travel based on personal experiences in Europe. His travels gave him a close affinity with the Romani people of Europe, who figure strongly in his work. His best-known books are &quot;The Bible in Spain&quot; and the novels &quot;Lavengro&quot; and &quot;The Romany Rye&quot;, set in his time with the English &quot;Romanichal&quot; (Gypsies).

==Early life==
Borrow was born at East Dereham, Norfolk, the son of Thomas Borrow (1758–1824), an army recruiting officer, and Ann Perfrement (1772–1858), a farmer&#x27;s daughter. His father, a lieutenant with the West Norfolk Militia, was quartered at the prisoner-of-war camp at Norman Cross from July 1811 to April 1813, and George spent his ninth and tenth years in the barracks there. He was educated at the Royal High School of Edinburgh and Norwich Grammar School.

Borrow studied law, but languages and literature became his main interests. In 1825, he began his first major European journey, walking in France and Germany. Over the next few years he visited Russia, Portugal, Spain and Morocco, acquainting himself with the people and languages of countries he visited. After his marriage on 23 April 1840, he settled in Lowestoft, Suffolk, but continued to travel inside and outside the United Kingdom.

==Borrow in Ireland==
Having a military father, Borrow grew up at various army posts. In the autumn of 1815, he accompanied the regiment to Clonmel in Ireland, where he attended the Protestant Academy and learned to read Latin and Greek &quot;from a nice old clergyman&quot;. He was also introduced to the Irish language by a fellow student named Murtagh, who tutored him in return for a pack of playing cards. In keeping with the political friction of the time, he learned to sing &quot;the glorious tune &#x27;Croppies Lie Down&#x27;&quot; at the military barracks. He was introduced to horsemanship and learned to ride without a saddle. The regiment moved to Templemore early in 1816, and Borrow began ranging around the country on foot and later on horseback.

After less than a year in Ireland, the regiment returned to Norwich. As the threat of war receded, the strength of the unit was greatly reduced.

==Early career==
Borrow&#x27;s precocious linguistic skills as a youth made him a protégé of the Norwich-born scholar William Taylor, whom he depicted in his autobiographical novel &quot;Lavengro&quot; (1851) as an advocate of German Romantic literature. Recalling his youth in Norwich some 30 years earlier, Borrow depicted an old man (Taylor) and a young man (Borrow) discussing the merits of German literature, including Johann Wolfgang von Goethe&#x27;s &quot;The Sorrows of Young Werther&quot;. Taylor confessed himself to be no admirer of either &quot;The Sorrows of Young Werther&quot; or its author, but he stated, &quot;It is good to be a German [for] the Germans are the most philosophical people in the world.&quot;

With Taylor&#x27;s encouragement, Borrow embarked on his first translation, Friedrich Maximilian Klinger&#x27;s version of the Faust legend, entitled &quot;Faustus, his Life, Death and Descent into Hell&quot;, first published in St Petersburg in 1791. In his translation, Borrow altered the name of one city, so making one passage of the legend read:

They found the people of the place modelled after so unsightly a pattern, with such ugly figures and flat features that the devil owned he had never seen them equalled, except by the inhabitants of an English town, called Norwich, when dressed in their Sunday&#x27;s best.

For this lampooning of Norwich society, the Norwich public subscription library burned his first publication.

==Russian visit==
As a linguist adept at acquiring new languages, Borrow informed the British and Foreign Bible Society, &quot;I possess some acquaintance with the Russian, being able to read without much difficulty any printed Russian book.&quot;

He left Norwich for St Petersburg on 13 August 1833. Borrow was charged by the Bible Society with supervising a translation of the Bible into Manchu. As a traveller, he was overwhelmed by the beauty of St Petersburg: &quot;Notwithstanding I have previously heard and read much of the beauty and magnificence of the Russian capital... There can be no doubt that it is the finest City in Europe, being pre-eminent for the grandeur of its public edifices and the length and regularity of its streets.&quot;

During his two-year stay in Russia, Borrow called upon the writer Alexander Pushkin, who was out on a social visit. He left two copies of his translations of Pushkin&#x27;s literary works and later Pushkin expressed regret at not meeting him.

Borrow described the Russian people as &quot;the best-natured kindest people in the world, and though they do not know as much as the English, they have not the fiendish, spiteful dispositions, and if you go amongst them and speak their language, however badly, they would go through fire and water to do you a kindness.&quot;

Borrow had a lifelong empathy with nomadic people such as the Romany (or Gypsy) people, especially Romany music, dance and customs. He became so familiar with the Romany language as to publish a dictionary of it. In the summer of 1835, he visited Russian Roma camped outside Moscow. His impressions formed part of the opening chapter of his &quot;The Zincali: or an account of the Gypsies of Spain&quot; (1841). With his mission of supervising a Manchu translation of the Bible completed, Borrow returned to Norwich in September 1835. In his report to the Bible Society he wrote:
I quitted that country, and am compelled to acknowledge, with regret. I went thither prejudiced against that country, the government and the people; the first is much more agreeable than is generally supposed; the second is seemingly the best adapted for so vast an empire; and the third, even the lowest classes, are in general kind, hospitable, and benevolent.

==Spanish mission==
Such was Borrow&#x27;s success that on 11 November 1835 he set off for Spain, once more as a Bible Society agent. Borrow said that he stayed in Spain for nearly five years. His reminiscences of Spain were the basis of his travelogue &quot;The Bible in Spain&quot; (1843). He wrote:
[T]he huge population of Madrid, with the exception of a sprinkling of foreigners... is strictly Spanish, though a considerable portion are not natives of the place. Here are no colonies of Germans, as at Saint Petersburg; no English factories, as at Lisbon; no multitudes of insolent Yankees lounging through the streets, as at the Havannah, with an air which seems to say, the land is our own whenever we choose to take it; but a population which, however strange or wild, and composed of various elements, is Spanish, and will remain so as long as the city itself shall exist.

Borrow translated the Gospel of Luke into the Romani and Basque languages. These were published in 1838, but both translations were banned for personal sale, with only public libraries being permitted copies.

==Later life==
In 1840 Borrow&#x27;s career with the British and Foreign Bible Society came to an end, and he married Mary Clarke, a widow with a grown-up daughter called Henrietta, and a small estate at Oulton, Suffolk near Lowestoft. There Borrow began to write his books. &quot;The Zincali&quot; (1841) was moderately successful and &quot;The Bible in Spain&quot; (1843) was a huge success, making Borrow a celebrity overnight, but the eagerly awaited &quot;Lavengro&quot; (1851) and &quot;The Romany Rye&quot; (1857) puzzled many readers, who were not sure how much was fact and how much fiction – a question debated to this day. Borrow made one more overseas journey, across Europe to Istanbul in 1844, but the rest of his travels were in the UK: long walking tours in Scotland, Wales, Ireland, Cornwall and the Isle of Man. Of these, only the Welsh tour yielded a book, &quot;Wild Wales&quot; (1862).

Borrow&#x27;s restlessness, perhaps, led to the family, which had lived in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, in the 1850s, moving to London in the 1860s. Borrow visited the Romanichal encampments in Wandsworth and Battersea, and wrote one more book, &quot;Romano Lavo-Lil, a wordbook of the Anglo-Romany dialect&quot; (1874). Mary Borrow died in 1869, and in 1874 he returned to Lowestoft, where he was later joined by his stepdaughter Henrietta and her husband, who looked after him until his death there on 26 July 1881. He is buried with his wife in Brompton Cemetery, London.

Borrow was said to be a man of striking appearance and deeply original character. Although he failed to find critical acclaim in his lifetime, modern reviewers often praise his eccentric and cheerful style – &quot;one of the most unusual people to have written in English in the last two hundred years&quot; according to one.

==Museum and memorials==
In 1913, the Lord Mayor of Norwich bought Borrow&#x27;s house in Willow Lane. It was renamed Borrow House, presented to the City of Norwich, and for many years open to the public as the Borrow Museum. The museum was closed and the house sold in 1994, but the proceeds went to establish a George Borrow Trust that aims to promote his works.

There are memorial blue plaques marking his residences at 22 Hereford Square, South Kensington, Fjaerland Hotel, Trafalgar Road, Great Yarmouth, and the former museum in Willow Lane, Norwich. In December 2011, a plaque was unveiled on a house, 16, Calle Santiago, Madrid, where he lived from 1836 to 1840. George Borrow Road, a residential crescent in the west of Norwich, is named after him. There is a &quot;George Borrow Hotel&quot; in Ponterwyd near Aberystwyth. A pub in Dereham is named &quot;The Romany Rye&quot; after one of his principal works.

A ketch, the FV &quot;George Borrow&quot; (LT956), was named after him. Built in 1902, the &quot;George Borrow&quot; sailed until 1915, when it was destroyed by a German U-boat (the SM &quot;UB-10&quot;). The skipper of the &quot;George Borrow&quot; was Thomas Crisp, who, in 1917, would go on to be awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross.

<text>Benjamin Lafayette Sisko is a fictional character in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise portrayed by Avery Brooks. He was the main character of the television series &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; (&quot;DS9&quot;), which was originally broadcast between 1993 and 1999. The character has also appeared in various books, comics, and video games within the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise.

==Character history==

Born in 2332 in New Orleans, Louisiana, Benjamin is the son of Joseph Sisko and a human woman named Sarah, who was possessed by a Bajoran Prophet, in order to conceive Benjamin. Sarah disappeared a short time later, when the prophet left her body, and died in an accident several years later. Joseph eventually met and married another woman, who raised Benjamin as her son. Benjamin remained unaware of these events until well into his adulthood. Sisko loves baseball, a sport that has largely disappeared by the 24th century but is kept alive by a small group of aficionados.

Sisko entered Starfleet Academy in 2350. During his sophomore year, he was in a field-study assignment on Starbase 137. He met a woman named Jennifer in Babylon, New York, on Gilgo Beach, shortly after graduating from the Academy. The two eventually wed and had a son named Jake. As a Starfleet officer coming up through the ranks, Sisko was mentored by Curzon Dax, a joined Trill serving as ambassador to the Klingon Empire.

In 2369, Sisko is assigned to the Bajoran sector to command Deep Space Nine and help Bajor&#x27;s recovery from the recently concluded Cardassian occupation, shepherding them toward possible membership in the Federation. Upon Sisko&#x27;s first visit to Bajor, the Kai (Bajor&#x27;s spiritual leader), Opaka Sulan, labels him &quot;the Emissary of the Prophets&quot; and gives him one of the Bajoran Orbs. By studying the orb and nearby stellar phenomenon, Jadzia Dax finds a stable wormhole; the other end of which connects to the Gamma Quadrant. Sisko and Dax encounter the mysterious entities living within it, named &quot;Prophets&quot; by the Bajorans. Although most Bajorans immediately accept Sisko as their highest spiritual leader, this causes conflicts with his standard role as a captain, his personal discomfort with it, and the Bajorans that resent that the emissary is not a Bajoran. 

The Gamma Quadrant is home to the Dominion, an aggressive and expansionist empire, which led to the Dominion War. Klingons, Romulans, and even the Cardassians eventually joined forces with the Federation against it. Sisko fulfills the Prophets&#x27; destiny for him in the series finale, &quot;What You Leave Behind&quot;, by confronting the Kosst Amojan-possessed Gul Dukat. Sisko throws himself and Dukat into the fiery abyss of the Bajoran Fire Caves, and Sisko is pulled into the Prophets&#x27; plane of existence to live with and learn from them. Sisko imparts a farewell to his new—and pregnant— wife, Kasidy Yates, informing her that although he does not know when, he will eventually return to her.

==Cultural references==
* In &quot;Sunshine&quot; by Robin McKinley, the title character mentions a tour company called &quot;Earth Trek&quot; operated by a man named Benjamin Sisko.

==Reception==
In 2009, IGN ranked Sisko as the 8th best character of &quot;Star Trek&quot; overall. In 2012, &quot;Paste Magazine&quot; rated Sisko as the #9 character of all &quot;Star Trek&quot; live-action television shows up to that time. In 2016, ScreenRant rated Benjamin Sisko as the fourth best character in &quot;Star Trek&quot; overall as presented in television and film up to that time. In 2016, Sisko was ranked as the 2nd most important character of Starfleet within the &quot;Star Trek&quot; science fiction universe by &quot;Wired&quot; magazine.

In 2017, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; ranked Sisko as the second best Captain of &quot;Star Trek&quot;, and compared him to the American WW2 General and US President Eisenhower. They note how he tried to raise his son on the wayward space station despite being widowed, while contending with crew of dubious loyalties. In 2017, Space.com ranked Sisko the fifth best captain of &quot;Star Trek&quot;. In 2017, Screen Rant ranked Sisko the 3rd most attractive person in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe, in between Seven of Nine and Nyota Uhura.

In 2019, Cinema Blend ranked Sisko the fourth best Star Trek Starfleet character of all time. Sisko was rated as one of the top seven time travelers of the Star Trek franchise by &quot;Nerdist&quot; in 2019, especially for his time traveling adventures in &quot;Trials and Tribble-ations&quot; and &quot;Past Tense&quot;.

In 2018, CBR ranked Sisko the third best Starfleet character of &quot;Star Trek,&quot; in between Janeway and Picard.

<text>Wolf 359 is a red dwarf star located in the constellation Leo, near the ecliptic. At a distance of from Earth, it has an apparent magnitude of 13.54 and can only be seen with a large telescope. Wolf 359 is one of the nearest stars to the Sun with only the Alpha Centauri system (including Proxima Centauri), Barnard&#x27;s Star, and the brown dwarfs Luhman 16 (WISE 1049-5319) and WISE 0855−0714 known to be closer. Its proximity to Earth has led to its mention in several works of fiction.

Wolf 359 is one of the faintest and least-massive nearby stars known. At the light-emitting layer called the photosphere, it has a temperature of ~2,800 K, low enough for chemical compounds to form and survive. The absorption lines of compounds such as water and titanium(II) oxide have been observed in its spectrum. The star&#x27;s surface has a magnetic field hundreds of times as strong as that of the Sun, generated by its thorough internal convection. As a result of this significant magnetic activity, Wolf 359 is a flare star that can undergo sudden and great increases in luminosity, which can persist for several minutes. These flares emit strong bursts of X-ray and gamma ray radiation that have been observed by space telescopes. It is a relatively young star with an estimated age of less than a billion years. No planetary companions for Wolf 359 have been confirmed so far, though there is one unverified candidate, and as yet no debris disks have been found.

==Observation history and name==
Wolf 359 first came to the attention of astronomers because of its relatively high rate of motion against the background, also known as the proper motion. A high rate of proper motion can indicate that the star is located nearby, as closer stars can achieve the same rate of angular change with a lower relative speed. The proper motion of Wolf 359 was first measured in 1917 by German astronomer Max Wolf, aided by astrophotography. In 1919 he published a catalogue of over one thousand stars with high proper motions, including this one, that are still identified by his name. He listed this star as entry number 359, and the star has since been referred to as Wolf 359, in reference to Max Wolf&#x27;s work.

The first parallax measurement of Wolf 359 was reported in 1928 from the Mount Wilson Observatory, yielding an annual shift in the star&#x27;s position of . From this position change, and the known size of the Earth&#x27;s orbit, the distance to the star could be estimated. It was the faintest and least-massive star known until the discovery of VB 10 in 1944. The infrared magnitude of the star was measured in 1957. In 1969, a brief flare in the luminosity of Wolf 359 was observed, linking it to a class of variable stars known as flare stars.

==Properties==

Wolf 359 has a stellar classification of M6, although various sources list a spectral class of M5.5, M6.5 or M8. Most M-type stars are red dwarfs: they are visually red because the energy emission of such stars reaches a peak in the red and infrared parts of the spectrum. Wolf 359 has a very low luminosity, emitting about 0.1% of the Sun&#x27;s power. If it were moved to the location of the Sun, it would appear ten times as bright as the full Moon.

At an estimated 11% of the Sun&#x27;s mass, Wolf 359 is just above the lower limit at which a star&#x27;s core can undergo hydrogen fusion through the proton–proton chain reaction: ~8% of the solar mass. (Substellar objects below this limit are known as brown dwarfs.) The radius of Wolf 359 is an estimated 14.4% that of the Sun, or about . For comparison, the equatorial radius of the planet Jupiter is , making the star a mere 40% wider than the planet.

The entire star undergoes convection, whereby the energy generated at the core is transported toward the surface by the convective motion of stellar plasma, rather than through electromagnetic radiation. This constant circulation redistributes throughout the star any excess accumulation of helium in the core generated by stellar nucleosynthesis. This process allows Wolf 359 to remain on the main sequence as a hydrogen fusing star for proportionately longer than one such as the Sun, for which helium steadily accumulates in the core and is not diluted. In conjunction with a much lower rate of hydrogen consumption due to its low mass and core temperature, Wolf 359 is expected to remain a main sequence star for about eight trillion years before finally exhausting its hydrogen supply and ending up as a helium white dwarf.

A search of this star by the Hubble Space Telescope revealed no stellar companions. No excess infrared emission has been detected, which may indicate the lack of a debris disk around it.

===Outer atmosphere===
The outer, light-emitting layer of a star is known as the photosphere. Estimates of the photospheric temperature of Wolf 359 range from 2,500 K to 2,900 K, which is sufficiently cool for equilibrium chemistry to occur. The resulting chemical compounds survive long enough to be observed through their spectral lines. Numerous molecular bands appear in the spectrum of Wolf 359, including those of carbon monoxide (CO), iron hydride (FeH), chromium hydride (CrH), water (H2O), magnesium hydride (MgH), vanadium(II) oxide (VO), titanium(II) oxide (TiO), and possibly the molecule CaOH. Since there are no lines of lithium in the spectrum, this element must have already been consumed by fusion in the core. This indicates that the star must be at least 100 million years old.

Beyond the photosphere lies a nebulous, high temperature region known as the stellar corona. In 2001, Wolf 359 became the first star other than the Sun to have the spectrum of its corona observed by a ground-based telescope. The spectrum showed emission lines of Fe XIII, which is heavily ionized iron that has been stripped of twelve of its twenty-six electrons. The strength of this line can vary over a time period of several hours, which may be evidence of heating.
Wolf 359 is classified as a UV Ceti-type flare star, a category of stars that undergo brief, dramatic increases in luminosity due to intense magnetic field activity in their photospheres. Its variable star designation is &quot;CN Leonis&quot;. Wolf 359 has a relatively high flare rate. Observations with the Hubble Space Telescope detected 32 flare events within a two-hour period, with energies of 1027 ergs (1020 joules) and higher. The mean magnetic field strength at the surface of the star is around 2.2 kG (0.22 teslas), but this value varies significantly on time scales as short as six hours. In comparison, the magnetic field of the Sun averages a strength of 1 gauss (100 μT), although it can reach as high as 3 kG (0.3 T) in active sunspot regions. During periods of flare activity, Wolf 359 has been observed to emit X-rays and gamma rays.

===Motion===

The rotation of a star causes a Doppler shift of its spectrum, generally resulting in a broadening of the absorption lines in its spectrum, with the lines increasing in width with higher rotational speeds. However, only the rotational velocity&#x27;s component in the direction of the observer can be measured by this method, and the resulting data imposes only a lower limit on the star&#x27;s rotational speed. This projected rotational velocity of Wolf 359 at its equator is less than 3 km/s, below the threshold of detection with spectral line broadening. This low rate of rotation may have been caused by the loss of angular momentum through its stellar wind, which increases greatly during periods of flare activity. Roughly speaking, the spin-down timescale of a star of spectral class M6 is somewhat long, at ~10 billion years, as fully convective stars lose their rotational speeds more slowly than others. However, evolutionary models suggest that Wolf 359 is a relatively young star with an age of less than a billion years.

Wolf 359&#x27;s proper motion is 4.696 arcseconds per year, and moving away from the Sun at a velocity of ~19 km/s. When translated into the galactic coordinate system, the motion corresponds to a space velocity of = . This space velocity implies that Wolf 359 belongs to the population of old-disk stars. It follows an orbit through the Milky Way that will bring it as close as and as distant as from the Galactic Center. The predicted galactic orbit has an eccentricity of 0.156, and the star can travel as far as away from the galactic plane. The closest stellar neighbor to Wolf 359 is the red dwarf Ross 128, at . Approximately 13,850 years before the present day, Wolf 359 attained its minimal separation of about from the Sun, and has been receding away ever since.

==Search for planets==
Radial velocity measurements of the star in 2011 using the Near Infrared Spectrometer (NIRSPEC) instrument at the Keck II observatory did not reveal any variations that might otherwise indicate the presence of an orbiting companion. This instrumentation is sensitive enough to detect the gravitational perturbations of massive, short period companions with the mass of Neptune or greater.

In June 2019, an international team of astronomers led by Mikko Tuomi from the University of Hertfordshire, UK, submitted a preprint with the results of the first reported detection of two candidate exoplanets orbiting Wolf 359 using the radial velocity method from observations with HARPS in Chile and HIRES in Hawaii. If these planets were confirmed, the setup of the system would be similar to but more extreme than that of the nearby red dwarf Proxima Centauri, with both having a close-in low-mass planet and a farther out higher-mass planet. The theorized and later ruled-out inner planet, Wolf 359 c, would receive per unit area about forty times as much radiative energy as compared to Earth, making it unlikely to be a habitable planet. The as yet unconfimed Wolf 359 b, in contrast, is classified as a cool super-Neptune, receiving roughly a third to a quarter of the energy per unit area as Neptune does from the Sun.

Further observations from the CARMENES survey have found that the radial velocity signal corresponding to the inner planet candidate Wolf 359 c is a false positive, resulting from the rotation of the star rather than a planetary companion. A 2023 follow-up study using MAROON-X, CARMENES, HARPS, and HIRES radial velocity data as well as imaging data was unable to either confirm or refute the presence of Wolf 359 b. The same study ruled out the existence of any brown dwarfs or massive gas giant companions within 10 AU of the star, planets more than half the mass of Jupiter within 1 AU, and planets more massive than Uranus within 0.1 AU.

==In popular culture==
Wolf 359 is notable for being the location and namesake of the Battle of Wolf 359 in the Star Trek universe.

A space station in orbit around the star is the primary setting of Wolf 359 (podcast).

<doc id="205662" wikidata="Q502918" url="?curid=205662" title="Counterfeit">
<text>A counterfeit is a fake or unauthorized replica of a genuine product, such as money, documents, designer items, or other valuable goods. Counterfeiting generally involves creating an imitation of a genuine item that closely resembles the original to deceive others into believing it is authentic. 

Counterfeit products are often made to take advantage of the higher value of the original product, typically using lower-quality materials or production methods. Counterfeit food, drinks, medicines, and personal care products can contain harmful or inactive ingredients, causing anything from mild issues to serious, life-threatening. Counterfeit footwear, clothing, and accessories have been found to contain high levels of lead, arsenic, and phthalates.

==Forgery of money or government bonds==

Counterfeit money is currency that is produced without the legal sanction of the state or government; this is a crime in all jurisdictions of the world. The United States Secret Service, mostly known for its guarding-of-officials task, was initially organized primarily to combat the counterfeiting of U.S. dollars in the wake of the American Civil War. Both sides had printed counterfeit notes in attempts to destabilize the other&#x27;s economy, an example of economic warfare.

Counterfeit government bonds are public debt instruments that are produced without legal sanction, with the intention of &quot;cashing them in&quot; for authentic currency or using them as collateral to secure loans or lines of credit through legitimate channels.

==Counterfeiting of documents==

Forgery is the process of making facsimiles or adapting documents with the intention to deceive. It is a form of fraud, and is often a key technique in the execution of identity theft. Uttering is a term in United States law for the forgery of non-official documents, such as a trucking company&#x27;s time and weight logs.

Questioned document examination is a scientific process for investigating many aspects of various documents, and is often used to examine the provenance and verity of a suspected forgery. Security printing is a printing industry specialty, focused on creating legal documents which are difficult to forge.

==Counterfeit goods==

Counterfeit goods are products that illegally use a registered trademark on items identical or similar to the original, designed to mislead buyers into thinking they are purchasing authentic products. Similarly, pirated goods infringe copyright, typically involving unauthorized reproductions or distributions of copyrighted works, such as movies, music, or software. The exact definitions of both counterfeit and pirated goods can vary by country, depending on local intellectual property laws.

The colloquial terms &quot;dupe&quot;&quot;&quot; (short for &quot;duplicate&quot;) or &quot;knockoff&quot;&quot;&quot; are often used interchangeably with &quot;counterfeit,&quot; though they have different meanings. Dupes and knockoffs generally mimic the physical look of other products without copying the brand name or logo of a trademarked item, unlike counterfeits. Despite this distinction, counterfeits are frequently misleadingly marketed as dupes.

According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the presence of counterfeit goods in global trade has grown substantially. In 2005, counterfeit and illegally copied products accounted for up to $200 billion in international trade. This figure rose to $250 billion by 2007, representing 1.95% of world trade, up from 1.85% in 2000. By 2019, counterfeit and pirated goods made up approximately 2.5% of global trade, valued at an estimated $464 billion. In the EU, imports of counterfeit and pirated products reached as high as €119 billion (approximately $134 billion), accounting for up to 5.8% of total imports that year.The increase in counterfeit goods sales, driven by the rise of globalized supply chains and e-commerce, is enabled through the use of small packages, sometimes referred to as de minimis shipments. Counterfeit goods purchased from e-commerce websites or social media apps are shipped in small packages to bypass customs inspections and exploit de minimis benefits, such as duty-free imports and expedited customs processing, allowing them to reach buyers directly. In 2023, 92% of counterfeit seizures in the U.S. involved small packages.China (including Hong Kong) is a major source of counterfeit goods, responsible for an estimated 80% of the world’s counterfeits, contributing over 1.5% to its GDP, and accounting for 84% of all counterfeit items seized by U.S. Customs and Border Protection in 2023. Other significant sources include India, Thailand, the Philippines, Turkey, Vietnam, Colombia, Mexico, and the United Arab Emirates. 

The most frequently seized counterfeit items are footwear, clothing, leather goods, and electrical machinery and electronic equipment. In 2023, apparel and accessories made up 26.2% of the counterfeit goods seized by U.S. Customs and Border Protection. 
Counterfeit components are also present in the military supply chain. A report from an investigation initiated by the United States Senate Committee on Armed Services in March 2011 revealed over 1,800 cases of suspected counterfeit electronic parts within more than 1 million defense-related products. A follow-up report in 2012 found that counterfeit parts came &quot;overwhelmingly from China.&quot; By 2022, concerns over counterfeit components in the supply chain persisted, notably affecting the F-35 fighter jets. In 2023, Forbes reported that Chinese materials, components, and software were still present in the Department of Defense&#x27;s supply chain.

== Counterfeit culture ==

Counterfeit culture is the thriving markets surrounding fake streetwear. Most commonly, these markets originate out of areas where the inability to buy popular streetwear brands has fueled more sophisticated markets for counterfeit goods. These markets have spawned the emergence of a tribe of widely available brands.

In countries like North Korea and Russia where trade sanctions were imposed in the past to prevent the importation of popular brands, demand was stimulated for available counterfeit alternatives. The economic standing of a country or region also contributed to the demand for these products as the average consumer can&#x27;t afford luxury prices but will gain the same social impact purchasing a knock-off whose quality is almost indistinguishable from the original&#x27;s.

Luxury streetwear is out of reach for many people, not just because of international sanctions and low wages, but because exclusivity is built into its business model. Social and cultural forces are driving the unique fashion scene. In particular, social media has a huge influence on over these markets giving people images of things they can&#x27;t own and further fueling the desire to obtains certain &quot;&quot; items by any means accessible.

Designers have even begun to acknowledge the trend of counterfeit culture by referencing fake or knock-off goods in their designs. This brought counterfeit culture into the realm of popular culture and has essentially shifted global acceptance towards becoming more lenient of these products as an appropriate alternative.

== Anti-counterfeiting technologies ==
Anti-counterfeiting technologies are added to products or their packaging to allow consumers or inspectors to check whether a product is authentic. The EUIPO Observatory on Infringements of Intellectual Property Rights has developed an anti-counterfeiting technology guide, to address the lack of information on technology solutions available on the market and help companies improve their protection against counterfeiting. In this guide, the main anti-counterfeiting technologies currently on the market are described, and classified into five main categories:

* Electronic technologies 
* Marking technologies 
* Chemical and physical technologies
* Mechanical technologies
* Technologies for digital media 
The International Standard Organization has also published standards related to the implementation of anti-counterfeiting solutions, including ISO 12931 and ISO 22381.

Lalande 21185 (also known as BD+36 2147, Gliese 411, and HD 95735) is a star in the south of Ursa Major. It is the apparent brightest red dwarf in the northern hemisphere. Despite this, and being relatively close by, it is very dim (as are all red dwarfs), being only magnitude 7.5 in visible light and thus too faint to be seen with the unaided eye. The star is visible through a small telescope or binoculars.

At away it is one of the stars nearest to the Solar System; only the Alpha Centauri system, Barnard&#x27;s Star, Wolf 359, and the brown dwarfs Luhman 16 and WISE 0855−0714 are known to be closer. Because of its proximity it is a frequent subject for astronomical surveys and other research and thus is known by numerous other designations, most commonly Gliese 411 and HD 95735. In approximately 19,900 years it will be at its closest, about 4.65 ly (1.43 pc) from the Sun, just over half its present distance.

Lalande 21185 has two known exoplanets and one candidate exoplanet, making it the third closest confirmed planetary system to the Solar System.

== History ==
The celestial coordinates of Lalande 21185 were first published in 1801 by French astronomer Jérôme Lalande of the Paris Observatory in the star catalog &quot;Histoire céleste française&quot;. The catalog sequence numbers for majority of the observed stars, including this one, were introduced in its 1847 edition by Francis Baily. Today this star is one of just a few that are still commonly referred to by their Lalande catalog number.

In May 1857, Friedrich Wilhelm Argelander discovered the high proper motion of the star. It was sometimes called &quot;Argelander&#x27;s second star&quot;. (The &quot;first Argelander&#x27;s star&quot; is Groombridge 1830, whose high proper motion was discovered by Argelander earlier—in 1842).

Friedrich August Theodor Winnecke is reported to have made the first measurement of the star&#x27;s parallax of 0.511 arc seconds in 1857–58 and thus first identifying Lalande 21185 as the second-closest-known star to the Sun, after the Alpha Centauri system. Since that time better measurements have placed the star farther away, but it remained the second-closest-known star system until the astrophotographic discovery of two dim red dwarfs, Wolf 359 and Barnard&#x27;s Star, in the early 20th century.

==Properties==
Lalande 21185 is a typical type-M main-sequence star (red dwarf) with about 39% of the mass and radius of the Sun. It is also much cooler than the Sun with a surface temperature of 3,550 K. With just 2.2% of the Sun&#x27;s luminosity, it is intrinsically dim with an absolute magnitude of 10.48, emitting most of its energy in the infrared. The proportion of elements other than hydrogen and helium is estimated based on the ratio of iron to hydrogen in the star when compared to the Sun. The logarithm of this ratio is −0.20, indicating that the proportion of iron is about 10−0.20, or 63% of the Sun. The surface gravity of this relatively compact star is approximately 65 times greater than the gravity at Earth&#x27;s surface (log g = 4.8 cgs), which is more than twice the surface gravity of the Sun.

Lalande 21185 is listed as a BY Draconis type variable star in the General Catalogue of Variable Stars. It is identified by the variable star designation NSV 18593. Several star catalogs, including SIMBAD, also classify it as a flare star. This conclusion is not supported by the primary reference these catalogs all use. The observations made in this reference show that it is rather quiet in comparison to other stars of its variable type.

Lalande 21185 emits X-rays, and X-ray flares have been observed.

==Planetary system==

Data published in 2017 from the HIRES system at the Keck Observatory on Mauna Kea supported the existence of a close-in planet with an orbital period of just 9.8693±0.0016 days, being at least .
Further radial velocity research with the SOPHIE échelle spectrograph and review of the original signal found that the 9.9 day period was undetectable, and instead proposed, using both datasets, an exoplanet orbiting the star with a period of either 12.95 or 1.08 days, much more likely 12.95, insofar as 1-day-period exoplanets seem to be rare in systems. This would give the planet a minimum mass of 2.99 Earth masses. It is too close to the star, and so therefore too hot, to be in the habitable zone, at all points within its eccentric orbit. The proposed planet on 12-day orbit was confirmed by (Calar Alto high-Resolution search for M dwarfs with Exoearths with Near-infrared and optical Echelle Spectrographs) project in 2020.

A second planet with a more distant orbit was initially noticed by SOPHIE, but the baseline was not long enough to confirm the several-year-long signal. The signal was confirmed in 2021 to be a planet with mass at least , a lower-bound estimate later revised to .

A third planet, Gliese 411 d, is suspected to orbit between Gliese 411 b and Gliese 411 c with a period of 215 days.
 
 
The habitable zone for this star, defined as the locations where liquid water could be present on an Earth-like planet, is at a radius of 0.11–0.24 AU, where 1 AU is the average distance from the Earth to the Sun. The planet b has an equilibrium temperature of 370.1 K. Other known planets are outside HZ boundaries too, but undetected low-mass ones may be orbiting in this region of this system as well.

===Past claims of planets===
Dutch astronomer Peter van de Kamp wrote in 1945 that Lalande 21185 possessed an &quot;unseen companion&quot; of (about ). In 1951 van de Kamp and his student Sarah Lippincott claimed the astrometric detection of a planetary system using photographic plates taken with the refractor telescope at Swarthmore College&#x27;s Sproul Observatory. In the summer of 1960, Sarah Lippincott altered the 1951 claim, to a planet of (that is, ), an 8-year orbital period, eccentricity of 0.3, a semi-major axis of . She used the original photographic plates and new plates taken with the same telescope. Photographic plates from this observatory, taken at the same time, were used by Van de Kamp for his erroneous claim of a planetary system for Barnard&#x27;s Star. The plates made with the Sproul 24-inch refractor and used for these and other studies were in 1973 shown to be flawed; as they were the next year with astrometric measurements made by George Gatewood of the Allegheny Observatory.

In 1996 the same Gatewood prominently announced at an AAS meeting and to the popular press the discovery of multiple planets in this system, detected by astrometry. The initial report was based on a very delicate analysis of the star&#x27;s position over the years, which suggested reflex orbital motion due to one or more companions. Gatewood claimed that such companions would usually appear more than 0.8 arcseconds from the red dwarf itself. Though, a paper by Gatewood published only a few years earlier and later searches by others, using coronagraphs and multifilter techniques to reduce the scattered-light problems from the star, did not positively identify any such companions, and so his claim remains unconfirmed and is now in doubt.

Before the 1980s, finding the radial velocity of red dwarfs was neither very accurate nor consistent, and so due to its apparent brightness and because it does not have a companion, this star, along with eleven other similar red dwarf stars, were chosen to have their radial velocity measured, to unprecedented high accuracy, by planet hunter Geoff Marcy. No companion was detected around this star in this nor other contemporary surveys, and such early equipment would have picked up any planet exceeding in an extremely close orbit of 5 days or less; or exceeding at about Jupiter&#x27;s orbital distance.

<text>Lacaille 9352 (Lac 9352) is a red dwarf star in the southern constellation of Piscis Austrinus. With an apparent visual magnitude of 7.34, this star is too faint to be viewed with the naked eye except possibly under excellent seeing conditions. Parallax measurements place it at a distance of about from Earth. It is the eleventh closest star system to the Solar System and is the closest star in the constellation Piscis Austrinus. The ChView simulation shows that its closest neighbour is the EZ Aquarii triple star system at about 4.1 ly away.

==Properties==
This star has the fourth highest known proper motion, (which was first noticed by Benjamin Gould in 1881) moving a total of 6.9 arcseconds per year. However, this is still a very small movement overall, as there are 3,600 arcseconds in a degree of arc. The space velocity components of this star are = . If the radial velocity (&quot;Vr&quot;) equals +9.7 km/s then about 2,700 years ago Lacaille 9352 was at its minimal distance of approximately from the Sun.

The spectrum of Lacaille 9352 places it at a stellar classification of M0.5V, indicating it is a type of main sequence star known as a red dwarf. This was the first red dwarf star to have its angular diameter measured, with the physical diameter being about 47% of the Sun&#x27;s radius. It has around half the mass of the Sun and the outer envelope has an effective temperature of about 3,670 K.

==Planetary system==

In June 2020, two super-Earth planets were reported, as well as a third signal with a period of 50.7 days that may be due to stellar activity—however, if this planet is real it may be located within the habitable zone. They were detected using the radial velocity method from observations with HARPS in Chile and HIRES in Hawaii.

<doc id="205669" wikidata="Q158928" url="?curid=205669" title="Bushehr">
<text>Bushehr (; ) is a port city in the Central District of Bushehr County, Bushehr province, Iran, serving as capital of the province, the county, and the district.

== Etymology ==
The roots of the name &quot;Bushehr&quot; are uncertain. It is unlikely that it is derived from &quot;Abū Šahr&quot; (&quot;father of the city&quot;), a theory which remains popular. It may be an abbreviation of Bokht-Ardashir (&quot;Ardashir has given&quot;), though this is not backed by conclusive evidence. .

== History ==
===Origins===
A number of alleged premodern references to Bushehr, including the first made by an Arab geographer in 1225, have been disputed as perhaps alluding to the modern city of Reishahr, a harbor 10 km to the south, where archaeological evidence points to the presence of a much older settlement. Reishahr is also most likely equivalent to the town of Mesambria, a place the Greeks knew since the campaign of Nearchus (died 300 BC), and which also has been occasionally identified with Bushehr.

=== Rise ===
In 1734, the Iranian military commander Nader made Bushehr (then still a minor fishing village) the headquarters of the Persian Gulf fleet that he sought to create. This marked the start of Bushehr&#x27;s rising importance. In order to build a massive warship, Nader even brought heavy wood from Mazandaran&#x27;s forests, which was 1,000 km away from Bushehr. The shell of this ship drew notice from European travelers for the next 50 years. The naval aspirations of Nader ended when he was murdered in 1747, but Bushehr continued to serve as a prominent port for at least the following 150 years. Between 1737–1753, the Dutch East India Company ran a trading facility there.

Aside from Bushehr&#x27;s strategic significance—being situated 300 km from Shiraz and 600 km from that of Ottoman-ruled Basra—the place offered few benefits and numerous drawbacks. The town and its surrounding area were somewhat shielded by the interior&#x27;s hilly terrain and narrow gorges, but were still vulnerable to pirate intrusion. In the 19th century, European ships had to dock around four kilometers offshore and transfer freight and passengers through small boats due to the shallow path to both the shoreline and the bay. Despite the numerous windcatchers on top of the houses, the water in the wells was salty, and the summer heat and humidity were unbearable.

===The main commercial port of Iran===
Bushehr soon replaced Bandar Abbas as the country&#x27;s most important commercial port. This was because of Iran&#x27;s political and economic centre being moved to Shiraz under the Zand ruler Karim Khan Zand (), who had established his authority in western Iran.
==Demographics==
=== Language ===
Linguistic composition of the city.

===Population===
At the time of the 2006 National Census, the city&#x27;s population was 161,674 people in 25,158 households. The census in 2011 counted 195,222 people in 52,204 households. The 2016 census measured the population of the city as 223,504 people in 63,820 households.

== Climate ==
Bushehr has a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen: &quot;BSh&quot;) with a precipitation pattern resembling a Mediterranean climate, albeit it is both too hot and dry for too long to qualify as such, by a wide margin, due to the threshold for hot climates being much higher in terms of required rainfall.


==Nuclear development==
Bushehr is twelve kilometres from the site of the Bushehr Nuclear Power Plant being built in cooperation with Russia. The work was begun by the Bonn firm A.G., a unit of Siemens AG, which contracted to build two nuclear reactors based on a contract worth $4 to $6 billion, signed in 1975.

Work stopped in January 1979, and Kraftwerk Union fully withdrew from the project in July 1979, with one reactor 50% complete, and the other reactor 85% complete. They said they based their action on Iran&#x27;s non-payment of $450 million in overdue payments. The company had received $2.5 billion of the total contract. Their cancellation came following the 1979 Iranian Revolution. Iran subsequently requested that Siemens finish construction, but Siemens declined. Shortly afterward Iraq invaded Iran and the nuclear programme was stopped until the end of the war. The reactors were damaged by multiple Iraqi airstrikes between March 1984 and 1988.

In 1995, Russia signed a contract to supply a light water reactor for the plant (the contract is believed to be valued between $700 million and $1.2 billion USD). The agreement calls for the spent fuel rods to be sent back to Russia for reprocessing. The plant started adding electricity to the national grid on 3 September 2011, and was officially opened in a ceremony on 12 September 2011.

<text>Ross 154 (V1216 Sgr) is a star in the southern zodiac constellation of Sagittarius. It has an apparent visual magnitude of 10.44, making it much too faint to be seen with the naked eye. At a minimum, viewing Ross 154 requires a telescope with an aperture of
 under ideal conditions. The distance to this star can be estimated from parallax measurements, which places it at away from Earth. It is the nearest star in the southern constellation Sagittarius, and one of the nearest stars to the Sun.

==Description==
This star was first catalogued by American astronomer Frank Elmore Ross in 1925, and formed part of his fourth list of new variable stars. In 1926, he added it to his second list of stars showing a measurable proper motion after comparing its position with photographic plates taken earlier by fellow American astronomer E. E. Barnard. A preliminary parallax value of was determined in 1937 by Walter O&#x27;Connell using photographic plates from the Yale telescope in Johannesburg, South Africa. This placed the star at the sixth position of the then-known nearby stars.
Ross 154 was found to be a UV Ceti-type flare star, with a mean time between major flares of about two days. The first such flare activity was observed from Australia in 1951 when the star increased in magnitude by 0.4. Typically, the star will increase by 3–4 magnitudes during a flare. The strength of the star&#x27;s surface magnetic field is an estimated . Ross 154 is an X-ray source and it has been detected by several X-ray observatories. The quiescent X-ray luminosity is about . X-ray flare emission from this star has been observed by Chandra observatory, with a particularly large flare emitting .

A stellar classification of M3.5V makes this a red dwarf star that is generating energy through the nuclear fusion of hydrogen at its core. It has an estimated 18% of the Sun&#x27;s mass and 20% of the Sun&#x27;s radius, but it is radiating only 0.4% of the luminosity of the Sun. In contrast to the Sun where convection only occurs in the outer layers, a red dwarf with a mass this low will be entirely convective. Based on the relatively high projected rotation, this is probably a young star with an estimated age of less than a billion years. The abundance of elements heavier than helium is about half that in the Sun.

No low-mass companions have been discovered in orbit around Ross 154. Nor does it display the level of excess infrared emission that would suggest the presence of circumstellar dust. Such debris disks are rare among M-type star systems older than about 10 million years, having been primarily cleared away by drag from the stellar wind. The space velocity components of this star in the galactic coordinate system are = [–12.2, –1.0, –7.2]. It has not been identified as a member of a specific stellar moving group and is orbiting through the Milky Way galaxy at a distance from the core that varies from with an orbital eccentricity of 0.052. Based on its low velocity relative to the Sun, this is believed to be a young disk (Population I) star. This star will make its closest approach to the Sun in about 157,000 years, when it comes within

<text>Ross 248, also called HH Andromedae or Gliese 905, is a small star approximately from Earth in the northern constellation of Andromeda. Despite its proximity it is too dim to be seen with the naked eye. It was first catalogued by Frank Elmore Ross in 1926 with his second list of proper-motion stars; on which count it ranks 261st in the SIMBAD database. It was too dim to be included in the Hipparcos survey. In about 40,000 years, Voyager 2 will pass 1.7 light-years (9.7 trillion miles) from the star.

Within the next 80,000 years, Ross 248 is predicted to be the nearest star to the Sun for around 9,000 years, overtaking the current nearest star, the triple system Alpha Centauri.

==Characteristics==
This star has about 14% of the Sun&#x27;s mass and 19% of the Sun&#x27;s radius, but only 0.2% of the Sun&#x27;s luminosity. It has a stellar classification of M6 V, which indicates it is a type of main-sequence star known as a red dwarf. This is a chromospherically-active star. With high probability, there appears to be a long-term cycle of variability with a period of 4.2 years. This variability causes the star to range in visual magnitude from 12.23 to 12.34. In 1950, this became the first star to have a small variation in magnitude attributed to spots on its photosphere as it rotates, a class known as BY Draconis variables.

Examining the proper motion of Ross 248 has found no evidence of a brown dwarf or stellar companion orbiting between 100–1400 AU, and other unsuccessful searches have been attempted using both the Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Planetary Camera and by near-infrared speckle interferometry. Long-term observations by the Sproul Observatory show no astrometric perturbations by any unseen companion.

==Distance from the Sun==

The space velocity components of this star in the galactic coordinate system are = [, , ] km/s. The trajectory of Ross 248 will bring it closer to the Solar System. In 1993, Matthews projected that in about 33,000 years it would enter a period of about 9,000 years as the closest star to the Sun, as close as in 36,000 years. A more precise estimate in 2022 has it approaching to within in 36,500 years.

Any future spacecraft that escaped the Solar System with a velocity of 25.4 km/s would reach this star 37,000 years from now, when the star just passes its nearest approach. By comparison, the &quot;Voyager 1&quot; has an escape velocity of 16.6 km/s.

&quot;Voyager 2&quot; is not headed toward any particular star, although in roughly 42,000 years, it will pass the star Ross 248 at a distance of 1.7 light-years.

The closest stellar neighbors to Ross 248 are the binary systems Groombridge 34, at 1.8 light-years away, and Kruger 60, at 4.5 light-years.

<text>Ross 128 is a red dwarf star in the equatorial zodiac constellation of Virgo, near β Virginis. The apparent magnitude of Ross 128 is 11.13, which is too faint to be seen with the unaided eye. Based upon parallax measurements, the distance of this star from Earth is , making it the twelfth closest stellar system to the Solar System. It was first cataloged in 1926 by American astronomer Frank Elmore Ross.

==Properties==

This low-mass star has a stellar classification of M4 V, which places it among the category of stars known as red dwarfs. It has about 18% of the mass of the Sun and 20% of the Sun&#x27;s radius, but generates energy so slowly that it has only 0.033% of the Sun&#x27;s visible luminosity; however, most of the energy being radiated by the star is in the infrared band, with the bolometric luminosity being equal to 0.37% of solar. This energy is being radiated from the star&#x27;s outer atmosphere at an effective temperature of 3,180 K. This gives it the cool orange-red glow of an M-type star.

Ross 128 is an old disk star, which means it has a low abundance of elements other than hydrogen and helium, what astronomers term the star&#x27;s metallicity, and it orbits near the plane of the Milky Way galaxy. The star lacks a strong excess of infrared radiation. An infrared excess is usually an indicator of a dust ring in orbit around the star.
In 1972, a flare was detected from Ross 128. It was observed to increase in brightness by about half a magnitude in the ultraviolet U band, returning to normal brightness in less than an hour. At optical wavelengths, the brightness changes were almost undetectable. It was classified as a flare star and given the variable star designation FI Virginis. Because of the low rate of flare activity, it is thought to be a magnetically evolved star. That is, there is some evidence that the magnetic braking of the star&#x27;s stellar wind has lowered the frequency of flares, but not the net yield.

Brightness variations thought to be due to rotation of the star and magnetic cycles similar to the sunspot cycle have also been detected. These cause changes of just a few thousandths of a magnitude. The rotation period is found to be 165.1 days, and the magnetic cycle length 4.1 years.

Ross 128 is orbiting through the galaxy with an eccentricity of 0.122, causing its distance from the Galactic Center to range between . This orbit will bring the star closer to the Solar System in the future. The nearest approach will occur in approximately 71,000 years, when it will come within .

==Planetary system==


Ross 128 b was discovered in July 2017 by the HARPS instrument at the La Silla Observatory in Chile, by measuring changes in radial velocity of the host star. Its existence was confirmed on 15 November 2017. It is the second-closest known Earth-size exoplanet, after Proxima b. Ross 128 b has a minimum mass 1.4 times that of Earth; a 2019 study predicts a true mass about 1.8 times Earth and a radius about 1.6 times that of the Earth, with large margins of error. It orbits 20 times closer to its star than Earth orbits the Sun, intercepting only about 1.38 times more solar radiation than Earth, increasing the chance of retaining an atmosphere over a geological timescale. Ross 128 b is a closely orbiting planet, with a year (orbital period) lasting about 9.9 days. At that close distance from its host star, the planet is most likely tidally locked, meaning that one side of the planet would have eternal daylight and the other would be in darkness. Near-infrared high-resolution spectra from APOGEE have demonstrated that Ross 128 has near solar metallicity; Ross 128 b therefore most likely contains rock and iron. Furthermore, recent models generated with these data support the conclusion that Ross 128 b is a &quot;temperate exoplanet in the inner edge of the habitable zone.&quot;

A 2024 study of the radial velocity data found an eccentricity of about 0.21 for Ross 128 b, higher than previous estimates and similar to that of Mercury. Given the planet&#x27;s orbit near the inner edge of the habitable zone, such a high eccentricity would significantly decrease its potential for habitability. This study also searched for additional planets in the system, and did not find any.

==Radio signals==
In the spring of 2017, Arecibo astronomers detected strange radio signals thought to originate from Ross 128 that were unlike any they had seen before. SETI&#x27;s Allen Telescope Array was used for follow-up observations and was unable to detect the signal but did detect man made interference, making it seem clear that the Arecibo detections were due to transmissions from Earth satellites in geosynchronous orbit. Ross 128 has a declination (a coordinate which can be likened to latitude) of close to 0 degrees, which places it in the thick of a phalanx of these satellites. Therefore, it can be concluded that the signal was a result of man-made interference.

<doc id="205686" wikidata="Q365395" url="?curid=205686" title="Michael Manley">
<text>Michael Norman Manley (10 December 1924 – 6 March 1997) was a Jamaican politician who served as the fourth prime minister of Jamaica from 1972 to 1980 and from 1989 to 1992. Manley championed a democratic socialist program, and has been described as a populist. He remains one of Jamaica&#x27;s most popular prime ministers.

==Early life==

Michael Manley was the second son of premier Norman Washington Manley and artist Edna Manley. He studied at Jamaica College between 1935 and 1943. He attended the Antigua State College and then served in the Royal Canadian Air Force during World War II. In 1945, he enrolled at the London School of Economics. At the LSE, he was influenced by Fabian socialism and the writings of Harold Laski. He graduated in 1949, and returned to Jamaica to serve as an editor and columnist for the newspaper &quot;Public Opinion&quot;. At about the same time, he became involved in the trade union movement, becoming a negotiator for the National Workers Union. In August 1953, he became a full-time official of that union.

==Entry into politics==

When his father was elected premier of Jamaica in 1955, Manley resisted entering politics, not wanting to be seen as capitalizing on his family name. However, in 1962, he accepted an appointment to the Senate of the Parliament of Jamaica. He won election to the Jamaican House of Representatives for the Central Kingston constituency in 1967.

After his father&#x27;s retirement in 1969, Manley was elected leader of the People&#x27;s National Party, defeating Vivian Blake. He then served as leader of the Opposition, until his party won in the general elections of 1972.

==First Premiership (1972–1980)==
In the 1972 Jamaican general election, Manley defeated the unpopular incumbent Prime Minister, Hugh Shearer of the Jamaica Labour Party, as his People&#x27;s National Party swept to a landslide victory with 37 of 53 seats.

An anti-capitalist, Manley was an advocate of building a socialist system in Jamaica. This reflected the ideology of his own People&#x27;s National Party, with one study noting that

===Domestic reforms===
Manley instituted a series of socio-economic reforms that produced mixed results. Although he was a Jamaican from an elite family, Manley&#x27;s successful trade union background helped him to maintain a close relationship with the country&#x27;s poor majority, and he was a dynamic, popular leader. Unlike his father, who had a reputation for being formal and businesslike, the younger Manley moved easily among people of all strata and made Parliament accessible to the people by abolishing the requirement for men to wear jackets and ties to its sittings. In this regard he started a fashion revolution, often preferring the Kariba suit, a type of formal bush-jacket suit with trousers and worn without a shirt and tie.

Under Manley, Jamaica established a minimum wage for all workers, including domestic workers.

In 1974, Manley proposed free education from primary school to university. The introduction of universally free secondary education was a major step in removing the institutional barriers to private sector and preferred government jobs that required secondary diplomas. The PNP government in 1974 also formed the Jamaica Movement for the Advancement of Literacy (JAMAL), which administered adult education programs with the goal of involving 100,000 adults a year.

Land reform expanded under his administration. Historically, land tenure in Jamaica has been rather inequitable. Project Land Lease (introduced in 1973), attempted an integrated rural development approach, providing tens of thousands of small farmers with land, technical advice, inputs such as fertilizers, and access to credit.

The minimum voting age was lowered to 18 years, while equal pay for women was introduced. Maternity leave was also introduced, while the government outlawed the stigma of illegitimacy. The Masters and Servants Act was abolished, and a Labour Relations and Industrial Disputes Act provided workers and their trade unions with enhanced rights. The National Housing Trust was established, providing &quot;the means for most employed people to own their own homes,&quot; and greatly stimulated housing construction, with more than 40,000 houses built between 1974 and 1980.

Subsidised meals, transportation and uniforms for schoolchildren from disadvantaged backgrounds were introduced, together with free education at primary, secondary, and tertiary levels. Special employment programmes were also launched, together with programmes designed to combat illiteracy. Increases in pensions and poor relief were carried out, along with a reform of local government taxation, an increase in youth training, an expansion of day care centres, and an upgrading of hospitals.

A worker&#x27;s participation programme was introduced, together with a new mental health law and the family court. Free health care for all Jamaicans was introduced, while health clinics and a paramedical system in rural areas were established. Various clinics were also set up to facilitate access to medical drugs. Spending on education was significantly increased, while the number of doctors and dentists in the country rose. Project Lend Lease, an agricultural programme designed to provide rural labourers and smallholders with more land through tenancy, was introduced, together with a National Youth Service Programme for high school graduates to teach in schools, vocational training, and the literacy programme, comprehensive rent and price controls, protection for workers against unfair dismissal, subsidies (in 1973) on basic food items, and the automatic recognition of unions in the workplace.

Manley was the first Jamaican prime minister to support Jamaican republicanism (the replacement of the constitutional monarchy with a republic). In 1975, his government established a commission into constitutional reform, which recommended that Jamaica become a republic. In July 1977, after a march to commemorate the Morant Bay rebellion, Manley announced that Jamaica would become a republic by 1981. This did not occur, however.

===Diplomacy===

Manley developed close friendships with several communist and socialist leaders, foremost of whom were Julius Nyerere of Tanzania, Olof Palme of Sweden, and Fidel Castro of Cuba. Manley&#x27;s support for Cuba sending troops to Angola during the Angolan Civil War was criticized by Henry Kissinger and others, and led to a worsening of relations between the US and Jamaica.

In December 1977, Manley visited President Jimmy Carter at the White House to remedy the situation, and relations improved somewhat. Details of the meeting, however, were never disclosed.

In a speech given at the 1979 meeting of the Non-Aligned Movement, Manley strongly pressed for the development of an alliance between the Non-Aligned movement and the Soviet Union to battle imperialism: &quot;All anti-imperialists know that the balance of forces in the world shifted irrevocably in 1917 when there was a movement and a man in the October Revolution, and Lenin was the man.&quot; Despite some international opposition — especially from the US and the OAS —, Manley deepened and strengthened Jamaica&#x27;s ties with Cuba, maintaining friendly relations with Fidel Castro, and paying an official visit to the country in 1975.

===Violence===

Manley was Prime Minister when Jamaica experienced a significant escalation of its political culture of violence. Supporters of his opponent Edward Seaga and the Jamaica Labour Party (JLP) and Manley&#x27;s People&#x27;s National Party (PNP) engaged in a bloody struggle which began before the 1976 election and ended when Seaga was installed as Prime Minister in 1980. While the violent political culture was not invented by Seaga or Manley, and had its roots in conflicts between the parties from as early as the beginning of the two-party system in the 1940s, political violence reached unprecedented levels in the 1970s. Indeed, the two elections accompanied by the greatest violence were those (1976 and 1980) in which Seaga was trying to unseat Manley.

In response to a wave of killings in 1974, Manley oversaw the passage of the Gun Court Act and the Suppression of Crime Act, giving the police and the army new powers to seal off and disarm high-violence neighborhoods. The Gun Court imposed a mandatory sentence of indefinite imprisonment with hard labour for all firearms offences, and ordinarily tried cases &quot;in camera&quot;, without a jury. Manley declared that &quot;There is no place in this society for the gun, now or ever.&quot;

Violence flared in January 1976 in anticipation of elections. A state of emergency was declared by Manley&#x27;s party the PNP in June and 500 people, including some prominent members of the JLP, were accused of trying to overthrow the government and were detained, without charges, in the South Camp Prison at the Up-Park Camp military headquarters. During the emergency, according to a report published on 2 November 1977, by investigative reporters Ernest Volkman and John Cummings of the New York newspaper &quot;Newsday&quot;, the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) plotted Manley&#x27;s assassination, with attempts that &quot;were supposed to have taken place&quot; on 14 July 1976 in Jamaica, and during a visit later in the year to Toronto. Manley&#x27;s response to the report was &quot;I can confirm not a shot was fired.&quot;

Elections were held on 15 December in the 1976 Jamaican general election, while the state of emergency was still in effect. The PNP was returned to office, winning 47 seats to the JLP&#x27;s 13. The turnout was a very high 85 percent. The state of emergency continued into the next year. Extraordinary powers granted the police by the Suppression of Crime Act of 1974 continued to the end of the 1990s.

Violence continued to blight political life in the 1970s. Gangs armed by both parties fought for control of urban constituencies. In the election year of 1980 over 800 Jamaicans were killed.

In the 1980 Jamaican general election, Seaga became Prime Minister after JLP won 51 of the 60 seats.

==Leader of the Opposition (1980–1989)==

As Leader of the Opposition, Manley became an outspoken critic of the new conservative administration. He strongly opposed intervention in Grenada after Prime Minister Maurice Bishop was overthrown and executed. Immediately after committing Jamaican troops to Grenada in 1983, Seaga called a snap election – two years early – on the pretext that Dr. Paul Robertson, General Secretary of the PNP, had called for his resignation. Manley, who may have been taken by surprise by the manoeuvre, led his party in a boycott of the elections, and so the Jamaica Labour Party won all seats in parliament against only marginal opposition in six of the sixty electoral constituencies.

In 1980, Manley gave a series of public lectures at Columbia University in New York.

Seaga&#x27;s failure to deliver on his promises to the US and foreign investors, as well as complaints of governmental incompetence in the wake Hurricane Gilbert&#x27;s devastation in 1988, contributed to his defeat in the 1989 elections. The PNP won 45 seats to the JLP&#x27;s 15.

==Second Premiership (1989–1992)==

By 1989, some right-wing critics had begun to assert that Manley had softened his socialist rhetoric, explicitly advocating a role for private enterprise.

Manley&#x27;s second term focused on liberalizing Jamaica&#x27;s economy, with the pursuit of a programme that stood in marked contrast to the more social democratic economic policies pursued by Manley&#x27;s first government. Various measures were, however, undertaken to cushion the negative effects of austerity and structural adjustment. A Social Support Programme was introduced to provide welfare assistance for poor Jamaicans. In addition, the programme focused on creating direct employment, training, and credit for much of the population.

The government also announced a 50% increase in the amount of nutritional assistance for the most vulnerable groups (including pregnant women, nursing mothers, and children). A small number of community councils were also created. In addition, a limited land reform programme was carried out that leased and sold land to small farmers, and land plots were granted to hundreds of farmers. The government had an admirable record in housing provision, while measures were also taken to protect consumers from illegal and unfair business practices.

In 1992, citing health reasons, Manley stepped down as Prime Minister and PNP leader. His former Deputy Prime Minister, P. J. Patterson, assumed both offices.

==Family==

Manley was married five times. In 1946, he married Jacqueline Kamellard, but the marriage was dissolved in 1951. In 1955, he married Thelma Verity, the adopted daughter of Sir Philip Sherlock, OM and his wife Grace Verity; in 1960, this marriage was also dissolved. In 1966, Manley married Barbara Lewars (died in 1968); in 1972, he married Beverley Anderson, but the marriage was dissolved in 1990. Beverley wrote &quot;The Manley Memoirs&quot; in June 2008. Michael Manley&#x27;s final marriage was to Glynne Ewart in 1992.

Manley had five children from his five marriages: Rachel Manley, Joseph Manley, Sarah Manley, Natasha Manley, and David Manley.

==Retirement and death==

Manley wrote seven books, including the award-winning &quot;A History of West Indies Cricket&quot;, in which he discussed the links between cricket and West Indian nationalism. The other books he wrote include &quot;The Politics of Change&quot; (1974), &quot;A Voice in the Workplace&quot; (1975), &quot;The Search for Solutions, The Poverty of Nations, Up the Down Escalator, and Jamaica: Struggle in the Periphery&quot;.

On 6 March 1997, Michael Manley died of prostate cancer, the same day as another Caribbean politician, Cheddi Jagan of Guyana. He was honoured with a state funeral on 16 March with religious services held at the Holy Trinity Cathedral, attended by Cuban President Fidel Castro, Trinidadian Prime Minister Basdeo Panday, and Haitian President René Préval, as well as other various leaders and delegates from the Caribbean. He is interred at the National Heroes Park, where his father Norman Manley is also interred. Photographer Maria LaYacona&#x27;s portrait of Manley appears on the Jamaican $2,000 note alongside a portrait of Edward Seaga.

<doc id="205687" wikidata="Q223537" url="?curid=205687" title="Nunarput, utoqqarsuanngoravit">
<text>&quot;&quot; (; , ; ) is the national anthem of Greenland, an autonomous state of the Kingdom of Denmark. Written by Henning Jakob Henrik Lund in 1912, it was officially adopted in 1916. Music for it was later composed by Jonathan Petersen in 1937.

The reference to Kalaallit as &quot;half-grown children&quot; yearning to join the &quot;advanced nations&quot; of the world has been considered controversial in modern times. Since 1979, &quot;Nuna asiilasooq&quot; (&quot;The Land of Great Length&quot;), an ethnic anthem used by the self-governing Kalaallit, has also been officially recognised by the government.

== History ==
The song was written in 1912 by Greenlandic priest Henning Jakob Henrik Lund, originally set to the melody of the Swedish national anthem, &quot;Du gamla, du fria&quot;. It was one of the first Greenlandic national songs and has been suggested to have been written as a national battle song for politicians pushing for a bill on home rule.

In 1937, organist and piano teacher Jonathan Petersen composed a melody for the anthem. In 1916, it was translated into Danish by Eskimologist William Thalbitzer. It was the only Greenlandic song translated into Danish, and remained so for many years, and as such was given official status as the national anthem of Greenland by Denmark. It was performed in this role at the University of Copenhagen in 1921 for the 200th anniversary of missionary Hans Egede&#x27;s landing in Greenland and in 1937 for King Christian X&#x27;s 25-year jubilee. In 1985, Thalbitzer&#x27;s Danish translation was refined by theologian Mads Lidegaard.

==Lyrics==
The fifth verse is more often sung after the first verse than the second verse in short versions.

<text>Kapteyn&#x27;s Star is a class M1 red subdwarf about 12.83 light-years from Earth in the southern constellation Pictor; it is the closest halo star to the Solar System. With an apparent magnitude of nearly 9, it is visible through binoculars or a telescope.

Its diameter is 30% of the Sun&#x27;s, but its luminosity just 1.2% that of the Sun. It may have once been part of the globular cluster Omega Centauri, itself the likely core of a dwarf galaxy swallowed up by the Milky Way in the distant past. The discovery of two planets—Kapteyn b and Kapteyn c—was announced in 2014, but had a mixed history of rejections and confirmations, until a 2021 study refuted both planets. The &quot;planets&quot; are in fact artifacts of the star&#x27;s rotation and activity.

==History of observations==

Attention was first drawn to what is now known as Kapteyn&#x27;s Star by the Dutch astronomer Jacobus Kapteyn in 1898. Under the name CPD-44 612 it was included in the &quot;Cape photographic Durchmusterung for the equinox 1875 (−38 to −52)&quot; by David Gill and Jacobus Cornelius Kapteyn in 1897. This catalogue was based on Gill&#x27;s observations from the Cape Observatory in 1885–1889 and was created in collaboration with Kapteyn. While he was reviewing star charts and photographic plates, Kapteyn noted that a star, previously catalogued in 1873 by B. A. Gould as C.Z. V 243, seemed to be missing. However, Robert T. A. Innes found an uncatalogued star about 15 arcseconds away from the absent star&#x27;s position. It became clear that the star had a very high proper motion of more than 8 arcseconds per year and had moved significantly. Later, CPD-44 612 came to be referred to as Kapteyn&#x27;s Star although equal credit should be accorded to Robert Innes. At the time of its discovery it had the highest proper motion of any star known, dethroning Groombridge 1830. In 1916, Barnard&#x27;s Star was found to have an even larger proper motion. In 2014, two super-Earth planet candidates in orbit around the star were announced, but later refuted.

==Characteristics==

Based upon parallax measurements, Kapteyn&#x27;s Star is from the Earth. It came within of the Sun about 10,900 years ago and has been moving away since that time. Kapteyn&#x27;s Star is distinctive in a number of regards: it has a high radial velocity, orbits the Milky Way retrograde, and is the nearest-known halo star to the Sun. It is a member of a moving group of stars that share a common trajectory through space, named the Kapteyn moving group. Based upon their element abundances, these stars may once have been members of Omega Centauri, a globular cluster that is thought to be the remnant of a dwarf galaxy that merged with the Milky Way. During this process, the stars in the group, including Kapteyn&#x27;s Star, may have been stripped away as tidal debris.
Kapteyn&#x27;s Star is between one quarter and one third the size and mass of the Sun and has a much cooler effective temperature at about 3500 K, with some disagreement in the exact measurements between different observers. The stellar classification is sdM1, which indicates that it is a subdwarf with a luminosity lower than that of a main-sequence star at the same spectral type of M1. The abundance of elements other than hydrogen and helium, what astronomers term the metallicity, is about 14% of the abundance in the Sun. It is a variable star of the BY Draconis type with the identifier VZ Pictoris. This means that the luminosity of the star changes because of magnetic activity in the chromosphere coupled with rotation moving the resulting star spots into and out of the line of sight with respect to the Earth.

The star has a mass of 0.27 , a radius of 0.29 and has about 1.2% of the Sun&#x27;s luminosity. It has a surface temperature of and is roughly 11 billion years old. In comparison, the Sun is about 4.6 billion years old and has a surface temperature of 5,778 K. Stars like Kapteyn&#x27;s Star have the ability to live up to 100–200 billion years, ten to twenty times longer than the Sun will live.

==Search for planets==

In 2014, Kapteyn&#x27;s Star was announced to host two planets, Kapteyn b and Kapteyn c, based on Doppler spectroscopy observations by the HARPS spectrometer which is housed at the European Southern Observatory&#x27;s La Silla Observatory in Chile, at the Keck Observatory in Hawaii, and at the PFS Observatory, also in Chile. Kapteyn b was described as the oldest-known potentially habitable planet, estimated to be 11 billion years old, while Kapteyn c was described as beyond the host star&#x27;s habitable zone.

Kapteyn b was thought to make a complete orbit around its parent star about every 48.62 days at a distance of 0.17 AU, with an eccentricity of 0.21, meaning its orbit is mildly elliptical. Kapteyn c was thought to orbit with a period of 121.5 days at a distance of 0.31 AU, with an eccentricity of 0.23. Both planets were thought to be super-Earths, with minimum masses of 4.8 and 7.0 , respectively.

The purported planets were thought to be close to a 5:2 period commensurability, but resonances could not be confirmed. Dynamical integration of the orbits suggested that the pair of planets are in a dynamical state called apsidal co-rotation, which usually implies that the system is dynamically stable over long time scales. Guinan et al. (2016) suggested that the present day star could potentially support life on Kapteyn b, but that the planet&#x27;s atmosphere may have been stripped away when the star was young (~0.5 Gyr) and highly active. The announcement of the planetary system was accompanied by a science-fiction short-story, &quot;Sad Kapteyn&quot;, written by writer Alastair Reynolds.

However, subsequent research by Robertson et al. (2015) found that the orbital period of Kapteyn b is an integer fraction (1/3) of their estimated stellar rotation period, and thus the planetary signal is most likely an artifact of stellar activity. The authors did not rule out the existence of Kapteyn c, calling for further observation. This refutation was questioned by the team that published the exoplanet discovery paper. Guinan et al. (2016) (as well as earlier authors) found a lower value for the stellar rotation, which lended support to the original planetary finding.

In 2021, a new analysis found no evidence for either planet, and found that the observed radial velocity signals are in fact artifacts of the star&#x27;s rotation and activity, after the rotational period of the star was refined, with a rotational period very similar to that of candidate c. There is currently no evidence for planets orbiting Kapteyn&#x27;s Star.
