<text>The third USS &quot;Albany&quot; (later PG-36 and CL-23) was a United States Navy protected cruiser of the &quot;New Orleans&quot; class. She saw service in the Philippine–American War and World War I.

==Construction and acquisition==
&quot;Albany&quot; was originally laid down at Newcastle upon Tyne, England, by Armstrong Whitworth on 8 December 1897 for the Brazilian Navy as &quot;Almirante Abreu&quot;, but was purchased while still on the ways by the United States Navy on 16 March 1898 to prevent her from being acquired by the Spanish Navy during the Spanish–American War. She was renamed &quot;Albany&quot; and launched in February 1899, sponsored by Mrs. John C. Colwell, the wife of the American naval attaché in London. She was commissioned in the River Tyne, England, on 29 May 1900. Cost $1,207,644.13 (hull and machinery).

==Service history==

===Philippine Squadron===
On 26 June 1900, &quot;Albany&quot; put to sea bound for service in the Philippines with the Philippine–American War. Steaming via Gibraltar, the Mediterranean Sea, the Suez Canal, and the Indian Ocean, the cruiser arrived at Cavite in the Philippines on 22 November. She served with the Asiatic Fleet in the Philippines for the next seven months. During that tour of duty, the protected cruiser visited Hong Kong, from 28 December 1900 to 17 February 1901, for repairs in drydock. On 3 July 1901, she departed Cavite to return to the European Station. Retracing the path of her maiden voyage, &quot;Albany&quot; transited the Suez Canal early in September and reentered the Mediterranean on 15 September.

===Europe===
For the following nine months, the warship cruised the warm waters of the Mediterranean visiting ports in Greece, France, Italy, Spain and Egypt. She entered the Atlantic on 18 June 1902 and, after stops at Cherbourg, France, and Southampton, England, rendezvoused with USS &quot;Illinois&quot; (Battleship No. 7) and protected cruisers USS &quot;Chicago&quot; and USS &quot;San Francisco&quot; (Cruiser No. 5) off Galloper light vessel on 12 July. She exercised with those ships until 20 July at which time she set a course for the Baltic Sea. During her sojourn in the waters of northern Europe, she visited Stockholm, Sweden; Kronstadt, Russia; and Copenhagen, Denmark. Early in September, she exited the Baltic and, after a visit to Plymouth, reentered the Mediterranean on the 12th. After almost two months of duty in the &quot;middle sea,&quot; &quot;Albany&quot; set a course for the western hemisphere early in November. She arrived in the West Indies in late November and ended the year in fleet tactical maneuvers which she concluded early in January 1903. On the 5th, the ship set a course for Boston. After repairs at Boston and at the New York Navy Yard, &quot;Albany&quot; got underway on 15 February 1903 to return to European waters.
===Asiatic Fleet===
At the end of a brief tour of duty in the Mediterranean, she transited the Suez Canal at the end of May 1903, and set a course for the Far East. She stopped for coal at Hong Kong and then joined the Asiatic Fleet at Yantai in northern China. She spent most of the remainder of 1903 operating with that fleet in the waters of northern China, Korea, and Japan. Upon returning to Kobe and proceeding thence to Yokohama, the protected cruiser embarked upon a voyage to Hawaii on 3 December. She arrived in Honolulu on the 16th and remained there until the 29th at which time she headed back toward the western Pacific.

She made a stop at Guam in the Ladrone (now Marianas) Islands before arriving at Cavite in the Philippines on 20 January 1904. She operated in the Philippines for about a month and headed for the coast of China on 19 February. The warship reached Shanghai four days later and remained in the vicinity for a month before getting underway for the Philippines on 22 March. She laid over at Cavite from 26 March to 18 April. The cruiser made another brief voyage to Shanghai and back to the Philippines between 18 and 30 April. Following a week at Cavite, she put to sea, bound for the United States. She made stops en route at Guam and Honolulu and arrived in port at Bremerton, Washington, on 16 June. Soon thereafter, &quot;Albany&quot; was placed out of commission at the Puget Sound Navy Yard. The protected cruiser remained inactive for almost three years.

===Pacific Fleet===
On 10 June 1907, she was placed in full commission, Comdr. Henry T. Mayo in command. Assigned to the Pacific Fleet, &quot;Albany&quot; spent the next three years cruising the western coasts of North and Central America. Her duty on the west coast of North America consisted primarily of training evolutions but also included surveillance missions along the coast of Central America in protection of United States citizens and their interests in the perennially unsettled republics there. She visited ports in Mexico, Honduras, El Salvador, and Nicaragua.

===Special Service Squadron===
On the evening of 16 April 1908, &quot;Albany&quot;, Commander Henry T. Mayo, commanding, received expedited orders to immediately prepare to depart Mare Island and proceed to San Diego to embark &quot;special peace envoy&quot; William I. Buchanan and then on to Central America for a two-month &quot;peace-keeping&quot; cruise. Albany departed Mare Island on 20 April. For the next fifteen months, she cruised the west coast of North and Central America and conducted surveillance missions to protect U.S. citizens and property in the perennially unsettled republics of Mexico, Honduras, El Salvador and Nicaragua, returning to Mare Island on 18 July 1909. 

By January 1909, &quot;Albany&quot; was transferred from the Pacific Fleet to the Special Service Squadron, signifying her patrol mission and readiness to disembark landing forces to protect American interests in Mexico and Central America.

In April 1909, while rendez-vousing with other Navy ships at Magdalena Bay, Baja California Sur, &quot;Albany&quot; assisted in the rescue of passengers from the stricken mail steamship &quot;Indiana&quot; that had run aground off Isla Santa Margarita.

From 8–10 September 1909, &quot;Albany&quot; and the protected cruiser along with three torpedo boats were anchored at Santa Monica Bay for dedication ceremonies of the Santa Monica Municipal Pier to coincide with California Admission Day. Visitors toured the warships and four companies of bluejackets, two from each cruiser, marched in a parade from the Santa Monica, California city hall to the new pier.

In October 1909, while &quot;Albany&quot; was at Mare Island undergoing repairs and preparing to steam south to Magdalena Bay, she and other U.S. and foreign warships, participated in the Portola Festival at San Francisco, a city-wide fair held on 19–23 October to mark the 140th anniversary of the Portolá expedition, the first recorded Spanish (and European) land entry and exploration of present-day California, and to proclaim to the world that San Francisco was recovered from its devastating 1906 earthquake.

===Duties in Pacific and Mexican waters===
Nicaragua proved to be her primary area of operations during the first part of 1910 when she was attached to Rear Admiral William W. Kimball&#x27;s Nicaraguan expeditionary force. She returned north to the Puget Sound Navy Yard in May to begin preparations to deploy once more to the Asiatic Fleet. On 4 August, she departed the navy yard on her way to Chinese waters. After stops at Honolulu in Hawaii and Yokohama in Japan, &quot;Albany&quot; arrived at Woosung, China, on 15 September. For almost three years, the protected cruiser plied Far Eastern waters visiting ports from the Philippines to China to Japan.

On 20 September 1913, the warship left Yokohama, bound for home. She stopped at Honolulu from 31 October to 5 November and arrived in San Francisco on 12 November. She moved north to Puget Sound at mid-month and was placed in reserve there on 23 December. Following repairs, she was recommissioned on 17 April 1914. That summer and fall, she cruised Mexican waters in the wake of the incident at Tampico and the resultant landing at Veracruz. She concluded that duty late in November and, on 4 December 1914, was placed out of commission at Bremerton, for a general overhaul. At the conclusion of those repairs late in the spring of 1915, &quot;Albany&quot; was assigned training duty with the state naval militias of Washington and Oregon. On 12 May 1916, she was returned to full commission, Lt. Comdr. Orin G. Murfin in command. Upon returning to active service, she once again headed for Mexican waters – this time as part of the United States&#x27; response to the massacre of American citizens in Columbus, New Mexico, perpetrated by Pancho Villa and his band of marauders.

===World War I===
By early 1917, &quot;Albany&quot; was operating with the U.S. Atlantic Fleet off the coast of Virginia. This change in assignment came as a result of worsening relations between the United States and the German Empire over the latter country&#x27;s unrestricted submarine warfare campaign. In February and March relations deteriorated rapidly; and, early in April, the United States entered World War I on the side of the Allied Powers.

On 5 July, &quot;Albany&quot; received orders to report to New York for convoy duty. She was assigned duties as flagship for Squadron 6, Patrol Force, Atlantic Fleet. As such, she carried the flag of Rear Admiral William C. Watts. For the duration of World War I, the cruiser escorted convoys of merchant ships, cargomen, and troop transports back and forth across the Atlantic. Between July 1917 and the end of the war on 11 November 1918, she shepherded 11 such convoys safely between the United States and Europe.

===Later career===
In 1919, &quot;Albany&quot; was once more assigned to the Asiatic Fleet. At that time, the Russian Civil War was being fought between Bolshevik and non-Bolshevik (a diverse group made up of people whose only common ground was opposition to the Bolsheviks) factions. Various Allied powers sent military contingents to several Russian ports. The United States landed troops at Vladivostok in Siberia, possibly to check Japanese pretensions in that area and to secure that port as an exit for the Czech Legion then transiting the Trans-Siberian railway. In 1919 and early 1920, &quot;Albany&quot; did several tours of duty at Vladivostok in support of American troops ashore. She also sent armed landing parties ashore on several occasions in further support of those troops and to evacuate sick and wounded men.

American troops were withdrawn in the spring of 1920, and &quot;Albany&quot; resumed normal peacetime duty with the Asiatic Fleet. That service included the usual summers in Chinese waters alternated with winters in the Philippines. Reclassified as a gunboat as PG-36 on 17 July 1920, &quot;Albany&quot; was again reclassified as a light cruiser as CL-23 on 8 August 1921.

==Decommissioning and disposal==
In July 1922, &quot;Albany&quot; departed Chinese waters for the last time and headed home. She arrived at the Mare Island Navy Yard on 6 August and was placed out of commission on 10 October 1922. She was berthed at Mare Island until 3 November 1929, when her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register. On 11 February 1930, &quot;Albany&quot; was sold for scrapping.

==Armament==

&quot;Albany&quot; was originally armed with six 6&quot;/50 caliber (152 mm) guns and four 4.7&quot;/50 caliber (120 mm) guns. These were British-made export-model guns built by Elswick Ordnance Company, a subsidiary of Armstrong. These guns were unique in the US Navy to &quot;Albany&quot; and her sister , and they were designated as &quot;6&quot;/50 caliber Mark 5 Armstrong guns&quot; and &quot;4.7&quot;/50 caliber Mark 3 Armstrong guns&quot;. To reduce supply difficulties, during refits at the Cavite Navy Yard in the Philippines in 1903, both ships had their 4.7-inch guns replaced with standard /50 caliber Mark 5 guns; the 6-inch guns were replaced with 5-inch guns in 1907. Their torpedo tubes were also removed in the 1903 refits. At least some of the guns from these ships were emplaced in the Grande Island/Subic Bay area 1907-1910 and operated by the United States Marine Corps until the Coast Artillery Corps&#x27; modern defenses centered on Fort Wint were completed. During World War I the 5-inch guns were reduced from ten to eight and a 3&quot;/50 caliber (76 mm) anti-aircraft gun was added. Two 4.7-inch guns (one from each ship of the class) are preserved at the Kane County, Illinois Soldier and Sailor Monument at the former courthouse in Geneva, Illinois. The gun from &quot;Albany&quot; was the No. 5 gun, presented on 1 April 1925.

<text>Tristram Edgar Speaker (April 4, 1888 – December 8, 1958), nicknamed &quot;the Gray Eagle&quot;, was an American professional baseball player and manager. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a center fielder from 1907 to 1928. Considered one of the greatest players in the history of Major League Baseball, he compiled a career batting average of .345 (ninth all-time). His 792 career doubles represent an MLB career record. His 3,514 hits are fifth in the all-time hits list. Defensively, Speaker holds career records for assists, double plays, and unassisted double plays by an outfielder. He held the major league career record for putouts by a center fielder (6,592) until he was surpassed by Willie Mays in 1971. His fielding glove was known as the place &quot;where triples go to die.&quot;

After playing in the minor leagues in Texas and Arkansas, Speaker debuted with the Boston Red Sox in 1907. He became the regular center fielder by 1909 and led the Red Sox to World Series championships in 1912 and 1915. In 1915, Speaker&#x27;s batting average dropped to .322 from .338 the previous season; he was traded to the Cleveland Indians when he refused to take a pay cut. As player-manager for Cleveland, he led the team to its first World Series title. In seven of his eleven seasons with Cleveland, he finished with a batting average greater than .350. Speaker resigned as Cleveland&#x27;s manager in 1926 after he and Ty Cobb faced game-fixing allegations; both men were later cleared. During his managerial stint in Cleveland, Speaker introduced the platoon system in the major leagues.

Speaker played with the Washington Senators in 1927 and the Philadelphia Athletics in 1928, then became a minor league manager and part owner. He later held several roles for the Cleveland Indians. Late in life, Speaker led a short-lived indoor baseball league, ran a wholesale liquor business, worked in sales and chaired Cleveland&#x27;s boxing commission. In 1937, Speaker was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame. He was named 27th in the &quot;Sporting News&quot; 100 Greatest Baseball Players (1999) and was also included in the Major League Baseball All-Century Team.

==Early life==
Speaker was born on April 4, 1888, in Hubbard, Texas, to Archie and Nancy Poer Speaker. As a youth, Speaker broke his arm after he fell from a horse; the injury forced him to become left-handed. In 1905, Speaker played a year of college baseball for Fort Worth Polytechnic Institute. Newspaper reports have held that Speaker suffered a football injury and nearly had his arm amputated around this time; biographer Timothy Gay characterizes this as &quot;a story that the macho Speaker never .&quot; He worked on a ranch before beginning his professional baseball career.

Speaker&#x27;s abilities drew the interest of Doak Roberts, owner of the Cleburne Railroaders of the Texas League, in . After losing several games as a pitcher, Speaker converted to outfielder to replace a Cleburne player who had been struck in the head with a pitch. He batted .318 for the Railroaders. Speaker&#x27;s mother opposed his participation in the major leagues, saying that they reminded her of slavery. Though she relented, for several years Mrs. Speaker questioned why her son had not stayed home and entered the cattle or oil businesses.

He performed well for the Texas League&#x27;s Houston Buffaloes in 1907, but his mother stated that she would never allow him to go to the Boston Americans. Roberts sold the youngster to the Americans for $750 or $800 (equal to $ or $ today). Speaker played in seven games for the Americans in , with three hits in 19 at-bats for a .158 average. In 1908, Boston Americans owner John I. Taylor changed the team&#x27;s name to the Boston Red Sox after the bright socks in the team&#x27;s uniform. That year, the club traded Speaker to the Little Rock Travelers of the Southern League in exchange for use of their facilities for spring training. Speaker batted .350 for the Travelers and his contract was repurchased by the Red Sox. He logged a .224 batting average in 116 at-bats.

==Major league career==

===Early years===

Speaker became the regular starting center fielder for Boston in 1909 and light-hitting Denny Sullivan was sold to the Cleveland Naps. Speaker hit .309 in 143 games as the team finished third in the pennant race. Defensively, Speaker was involved in 12 double plays, leading the league&#x27;s outfielders, and had a .973 fielding percentage, third among outfielders. In the Red Sox signed left fielder Duffy Lewis. Speaker, Lewis and Harry Hooper formed Boston&#x27;s &quot;Million-Dollar Outfield&quot;, one of the finest outfield trios in baseball history. Speaker was the star of the Million-Dollar Outfield. He ran fast enough that he could stand very close to second base, effectively giving the team a fifth infielder, but he still caught the balls hit to center field. In 1910 and 1911, Boston finished fourth in the American League standings.

Speaker&#x27;s best season came in 1912. He played every game and led the American League (AL) in doubles (53) and home runs (10). He set career highs with 222 hits, 136 runs, 580 at-bats, and 52 stolen bases. Speaker&#x27;s stolen base tally was a team record until Tommy Harper stole 54 bases in 1973. He batted .383 and his .567 slugging percentage was the highest of his dead-ball days. Speaker set a major league single-season record with three hitting streaks of 20 or more games (30, 23, and 22). He also became the first major leaguer to hit 50 doubles and steal 50 bases in the same season. In August, Speaker&#x27;s mother unsuccessfully attempted to convince him to quit baseball and come home. In Fenway Park&#x27;s first game, Speaker drove in the winning run in the 11th inning, giving Boston the 7–6 win.

The 1912 Red Sox won the AL pennant, finishing 14 games ahead of the Washington Senators and 15 games ahead of the Philadelphia Athletics. In the 1912 World Series, Speaker led the Red Sox to their second World Series title by defeating John McGraw&#x27;s New York Giants. After the second game was called on account of darkness and ended in a tie, the series went to eight games. The Red Sox won the final game after Fred Snodgrass dropped an easy fly ball and later failed to go after a Speaker pop foul. After the pop foul, Speaker tied the game with a single. The Red Sox won the game in the bottom of the tenth inning. He finished the series with a .300 batting average, nine hits and four runs scored. Speaker was named the AL Most Valuable Player (MVP) for 1912. Though he did not lead the league in any offensive categories in 1913, Speaker finished fourth in AL MVP voting. Speaker batted .338 and tied his career high of 12 double plays as an outfielder in . He hit .322 in . The Red Sox beat the Philadelphia Phillies in the 1915 World Series. The Red Sox were led by pitcher Babe Ruth, who was playing in his first full season. Ruth won 18 games and hit a team-high four home runs. Speaker got five hits, including a triple, in 17 at-bats during the series. He scored twice but did not drive in any runs.

===Traded to the Indians===

After 1915, Red Sox president Joseph Lannin wanted Speaker to take a pay cut from about $15,000 (equal to $ today) to about $9,000 (equal to $ today) because of the drop in his batting average; Speaker refused and offered $12,000 ($ today). On April 8, 1916, Lannin traded Speaker to the Cleveland Indians. In exchange, Boston received Sad Sam Jones, Fred Thomas and $50,000 ($ today). The angry Speaker held out until he received $10,000 (equal to $ today) of the cash that Boston collected.

For many years, this was considered the worst trade in Red Sox history, and was thought to be far more damaging to the Red Sox than the sale of Babe Ruth more than four years later, even though the Red Sox won the World Series in 1916 and 1918. In his book about the Red Sox-Yankees rivalry, &quot;Emperors and Idiots,&quot; Mike Vaccaro recalled that for some time, &quot;Red Sox fans shook their head(s) in fury&quot; when recalling the trade. Vaccaro recalled that no one knew in the winter of 1919-20 that Ruth would blossom into a superstar. In contrast, Speaker had established himself as &quot;indisputably the best player in the American League&quot; by 1916.

With an annual salary of $40,000 (equal to $ today), Speaker was the highest paid player in baseball. Speaker hit over .350 in nine of his eleven years with Cleveland. In , he led the league in hits, doubles, batting average, slugging percentage and on-base percentage. Cobb had won the previous nine consecutive AL batting titles; Speaker outhit him with a .386 batting average compared to Cobb&#x27;s .371. The center field fence at Cleveland&#x27;s Dunn Field was from home plate until it was shortened to in 1920. Even so, Speaker played so shallow in the outfield that he was able to execute six career unassisted double plays at second base, catching low line drives on the run and then beating baserunners to the bag. At least once he was credited as the pivot man in a routine double play. He was often shallow enough to catch pickoff throws at second base. At one point, Speaker&#x27;s signature move was to come in behind second base on a bunt and make a tag play on a baserunner who had passed the bag.

While in Cleveland, Speaker participated in diverse activities off the baseball field. Speaker enrolled in an aviator training program in 1918. Though World War I ended less than two months after he enrolled, Speaker completed his training and served in the naval reserves for several years. He also owned a ranch in Texas and competed in roping events during the baseball offseason.

===Stint as player-manager===
From the day that Speaker arrived in Cleveland, he was effectively assistant manager to Lee Fohl, who rarely made an important move without consulting him. George Uhle recalled an incident from 1919 during his rookie year with the Indians. Speaker often signaled to Fohl when he thought that a pitcher should be brought in from the bullpen. On July 18, Fohl misread Speaker&#x27;s signal and brought in a different pitcher than Speaker had intended. To avoid the appearance of overruling his manager, Speaker let the change stand. Pitcher Fritz Coumbe lost the game, Fohl resigned that night and Speaker became manager. Uhle said that Speaker felt bad for contributing to Fohl&#x27;s departure.

Speaker guided the 1920 Indians to their first World Series win. In a crucial late season game against the second-place White Sox, Speaker caught a hard line drive hit to deep right-center field by Shoeless Joe Jackson, ending the game. On a dead run, Speaker leaped with both feet off the ground, snaring the ball before crashing into a concrete wall. As he lay unconscious from the impact, Speaker still held the baseball. In the 1920 World Series against Brooklyn, Speaker hit an RBI triple in the deciding game, which the Indians won 3–0. Cleveland&#x27;s 1920 season was also significant due to the death of Ray Chapman on August 17. Chapman died after being hit in the head by a pitch from Carl Mays. Chapman had been asked about retirement before the season, and he said that he wanted to help Speaker earn Cleveland&#x27;s first World Series victory before thinking of retirement.

During that championship season, Speaker is credited with introducing the platoon system, which attempted to match right-handed batters against left-handed pitchers and vice versa. Sportswriter John B. Sheridan was among the critics of the system, saying, &quot;The specialist in baseball is no good and won&#x27;t go very far... The whole effect of the system will be to make the players affected half men... It is farewell, a long farewell to all that player&#x27;s chance of greatness... It destroys young ball players by destroying their most precious quality — confidence in their ability to hit any pitcher, left or right, alive, dead, or waiting to be born.&quot; &quot;Baseball Magazine&quot; was supportive, pointing out that Speaker had results that backed up his system.
The 1921 Indians remained in a tight pennant race all year, finishing games behind the Yankees. The Indians did not seriously contend for the pennant from 1922 through 1925. Speaker led the league in doubles eight times, including every year between 1920 and 1923. He led the league&#x27;s outfielders in fielding percentage in 1921 and 1922. On May 17, 1925, Speaker became the fifth member of the 3,000 hit club when he hit a single off pitcher Tom Zachary of the Washington Senators. Only Napoleon Lajoie had previously accomplished the feat as a member of the Indians. AL President Ban Johnson asked Speaker and Detroit manager Cobb to resign their posts after a scandal broke in . Pitcher Dutch Leonard claimed that Speaker and Cobb fixed at least one game between Cleveland and Detroit. In a newspaper column published shortly before the hearings were to begin, Billy Evans characterized the accusations as &quot;purely a matter of personal revenge&quot; for Leonard. The pitcher was said to be upset with Cobb and Speaker after a trade ended with Leonard in the minor leagues. When Leonard refused to appear at the January 5, 1927, hearings to discuss his accusations, Commissioner Landis cleared both Speaker and Cobb of any wrongdoing. Both were reinstated to their original teams, but each team declared its manager free to sign elsewhere. Speaker did not return to big league managing and he finished his MLB managerial career with a 617–520 record.

At the time of his 1926 resignation, news reports described Speaker as permanently retiring from baseball to pursue business ventures. However, Speaker signed to play with the Washington Senators for . Cobb joined the Philadelphia Athletics. Speaker joined Cobb in Philadelphia for the season; he played part time and finished with a .267 average. Prior to that season, Speaker had not hit for a batting average below .300 since 1908. Speaker&#x27;s major league playing career ended after 1928. He retired with 792 doubles, an all-time career record. Defensively, Speaker holds the all-time career records for assists as an outfielder and double plays as an outfielder. He remains the last batter to hit 200 triples in a career.

==Later life==

In Speaker replaced Walter Johnson as the manager of the Newark Bears of the International League. In two seasons with Newark, he also appeared as a player in 59 games. When Speaker resigned during his second season, the Bears were in seventh place after a sixth-place finish in 1929. In January 1933 he became a part owner and manager of the Kansas City Blues. By May, Speaker had been replaced as manager but remained secretary of the club. By 1936, he had sold his share of the team. In 1937, Speaker was voted into the Baseball Hall of Fame during its second year of balloting. He was honored at the hall&#x27;s first induction ceremony in 1939.

After his playing and managing days, Speaker was an entrepreneur and salesman. By 1937, Speaker had opened a wholesale liquor business and worked as a state sales representative for a steel company. He chaired Cleveland&#x27;s boxing commission between 1936 and 1943. Newspaper coverage credited Speaker with several key reforms to boxing in Cleveland, including the recruitment of new officials and protections against fight fixing. Under Speaker, fight payouts went directly to boxers rather than managers. Speaker sorted out a scheduling conflict for a 1940 boxing match in Cleveland involving former middleweight champion Teddy Yarosz. Yarosz defeated Jimmy Reeves in ten rounds and the fight attracted over 8,300 spectators.

In 1937, Speaker sustained a 16-foot fall while working on a flower box near a second-story window at his home. Upon admission to the hospital, he underwent facial surgery. He was described as having &quot;better than an even chance to live&quot; and was suffering from a skull fracture, a broken arm and possible internal injuries. He ultimately recovered.

In 1939, Speaker was president of the National Professional Indoor Baseball League. The league had teams in New York, Brooklyn, Philadelphia, Boston, Cleveland, Chicago, Cincinnati and St. Louis. The league shut down operations due to poor attendance only two months after its formation. Speaker was one of the founders of Cleveland&#x27;s Society for Crippled Children and he helped to promote the society&#x27;s rehabilitation center, Camp Cheerful. Speaker served as vice president of the society, ran fundraising campaigns and received a distinguished service award from the organization. He became seriously ill with pneumonia in 1942. Speaker ultimately recovered, but Gay characterized Speaker&#x27;s condition as &quot;touch-and-go for several days&quot;. In 1947, Speaker returned to baseball as &quot;ambassador of good will&quot; for Bill Veeck and the Cleveland Indians. He remained in advisory, coaching or scouting roles for the Indians until his death in 1958. In an article in the July 1952 issue of &quot;SPORT&quot;, Speaker recounted how Veeck hired him in 1947 to be a coaching consultant to Larry Doby, the first black player in the AL and the second in the major leagues. Before the Indians had signed Doby, he was the star second baseman of the Newark Eagles of the Negro leagues. A &quot;SPORT&quot; photograph that accompanied the article shows Speaker mentoring five members of the Indians: Luke Easter, Jim Hegan, Ray Boone, Al Rosen and Doby. Speaker was inducted into the Texas Sports Hall of Fame in 1951. Texas was the first state to establish a state sports hall of fame and Speaker was in its inaugural induction class.

==Death==
Speaker died of a heart attack on December 8, 1958, at the age of 70, at Lake Whitney, Texas. He collapsed as he and a friend were pulling their boat into the dock after a fishing trip. It was his second heart attack in four years. Speaker was buried at Fairview Cemetery in Hubbard, Texas.

After Speaker&#x27;s death, Cobb said, &quot;Terribly depressed. I never let him know how much I admired him when we were playing against each other... It was only after we finally became teammates and then retired that I could tell Tris Speaker of the underlying respect I had for him.&quot; Lajoie said, &quot;He was one of the greatest fellows I ever knew, both as a baseball player and as a gentleman.&quot; Former Boston teammate Duffy Lewis said, &quot;He was a team player. As great a hitter as he was, he wasn&#x27;t looking out for his own average ... Speaker was the bell cow of our outfield. Harry Hooper and I would watch him and know how to play the hitters.&quot;

==Legacy==

Immediately after Speaker&#x27;s death, the baseball field at the city park in Cleburne, Texas, was renamed in honor of Speaker. In 1961, the Tris Speaker Memorial Award was created by the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America to honor players or officials who make outstanding contributions to baseball. In 1999, he ranked number 27 on the &quot;Sporting News&quot;&#x27; list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players. He was named to the Major League Baseball All-Century Team. Speaker is mentioned in the poem &quot;Line-Up for Yesterday&quot; by Ogden Nash.

In 2008, former baseball players&#x27; union chief Marvin Miller, trying to defend the recently retired catcher Mike Piazza against claims that he should not be elected to the Hall of Fame because of association with the use of steroids, on the basis that the Hall of Fame has various unsavory people in it, opined that Speaker should be removed from the Hall of Fame because of alleged membership in the Ku Klux Klan. Miller said, &quot;Some of the early people inducted in the Hall were members of the Ku Klux Klan: Tris Speaker, Cap Anson, and some people suspect Ty Cobb as well. I think that by and large, the players, and certainly the ones I knew, are good people. But the Hall is full of villains.&quot; Speaker-Cobb-Rogers Hornsby biographer Charles C. Alexander, a Klan expert in his general history writings, told fellow baseball author Marty Appel, apparently referring to the 1920s, “As I’ve suggested in the biographies, it’s possible that they [Speaker, Cobb and Hornsby] were briefly in the Klan, which was very strong in Texas and especially in Fort Worth and Dallas. The Klan went all out to recruit prominent people in all fields, provided they were native born, Protestant and white.”

Baseball historian Bill James does not dispute this claim in apparently referring to Speaker and possibly Cobb, but says that the Klan had toned down its racist overtures during the 1920s and pulled in hundreds of thousands of men, including Hugo Black. James adds that Speaker was a staunch supporter of Doby when he broke the American League color barrier, working long hours with the former second baseman on how to play the outfield.

<text>Anna-Leena Härkönen (born 10 April 1965) is a Finnish writer and actress.

She was born in Liminka and studied acting at the college of drama and the University of Tampere&#x27;s program of drama studies, which she concluded in 1989. She won the J. H. Erkko Award in 1984 for her debut novel &quot;How to Kill a Bull&quot; ().

A few dramatic productions, including one movie, have been adapted from Härkönen&#x27;s works. &quot;Häräntappoase&quot; was made into a six-part television series and stage productions in Turku and Kotka and summer 2010 in Pyynikin kesäteatteri in Tampere. Scriptwriter Tove Idström and director Claes Olsson made a full-length movie based on &quot;Akvaariorakkautta&quot; (&quot;Aquarium Love&quot;) which was released internationally as an art-house movie.

==Career==
=== Writing === 
Härkönen gained significant publicity with her debut novel, &quot;Häräntappoase&quot; (&quot;The Ox-Killer&quot;), which was published in 1984 while she was in her second year at Kempele High School. The book was awarded the J. H. Erko Prize for best debut novel that same year. Härkönen graduated from high school in 1985. &quot;Häräntappoase&quot; has been adapted into two television series, one in 1989 and another in 2021, as well as a theatre adaptation.

Härkönen has long written columns for magazines such as &quot;Anna&quot; and &quot;Image&quot;. Her columns often explore the lives of young urbanites, their relationships, or the differences between men and women. She frequently depicts womanhood with self-irony and exaggeration, incorporating humorous everyday anecdotes. Härkönen has also authored autobiographical works. In 2001, she published &quot;Heikosti positiivinen&quot; (&quot;Weakly Positive&quot;), which focuses on motherhood, and in 2005, &quot;Loppuunkäsitelty&quot; (&quot;Finalized&quot;), which addresses her sister Killi’s suicide.

In 2014, Härkönen released &quot;Takana puhumisen taito&quot; (&quot;The Art of Talking Behind Someone’s Back&quot;), a campaign book published by the Finnish Booksellers Association. It was available only during the international World Book and Copyright Day on 23 April 2014 and the two following days.

=== Acting === 
Härkönen studied acting at the University of the Arts Helsinki&#x27;s Theatre Academy and the University of Tampere&#x27;s Department of Acting Studies. She graduated with a Bachelor of Theatre Arts in 1989. 

Härkönen gained public recognition as an actress through Mikko Niskanen&#x27;s film &quot;Mona ja palavan rakkauden aika&quot; (1983), in which she played a young high school girl who discovers Jesus. In 1988, Härkönen starred in the title role of the television film based on Minna Canth&#x27;s play &quot;Anna Liisa&quot;, directed by Tuija-Maija Niskanen. Härkönen is also known for her role as Liisa Metsola in the television series &quot;Metsolat&quot; (1993–1995). 

In the 2000s, Härkönen appeared in supporting roles in films such as &quot;Kuutamolla&quot; (2002), &quot;Beauty and the Bastard&quot; (2005), and &quot;Shadows of Happiness&quot; (2005).

The NUS was formed on 10 February 1922 at a meeting held at the University of London. At this meeting, the Inter-Varsity Association and the International Students Bureau (which organised student travel and had been lobbying for a national body) agreed to merge.

Founding members included the unions of University of Birmingham, Birkbeck, University of London, London School of Economics, Imperial College (who first left in 1923 and have subsequently rejoined and left three times, the last time being in June 2008), King&#x27;s College London (who supplied the first President, Sir Ivison Macadam) and the University of Bristol.

===Politicisation and Broad Left, 1968–1982===
In the aftermath of the First World War in its founding constitution, the National Union of Students had adopted from the outset a &quot;non political&quot; clause in its charter in an attempt to distance itself from the reasons that the War had broken out. It had thus concerned itself with student interaction and cheap travel, student grants and student interests.

This apolitical consensus was challenged in concert with the international protests of 1968 and as the Cold War intensified. At the 1969 NUS conference, then president Trevor Fisk came up against Jack Straw (then close to Bert Ramelson of the Communist Party of Great Britain, but much later Foreign Secretary under the New Labour government of Tony Blair) over the issue. Straw supported student protests against US military involvement in the Vietnam War, while Fisk advocated neutrality; Straw&#x27;s side won and the &quot;no politics&quot; clause was removed.

A new era began for the NUS, where political agitation and protest became institutionalized. Straw was followed up as president by Digby Jacks, also representing the Radical Student Alliance (formed in 1966 by Fergus Nicholson) and a member of the Communist Party of Great Britain. According to contemporary British government reports, the RSA was connected to the Trotskyist-led Vietnam Solidarity Campaign and had close links with the &quot;Sozialistischer Deutscher Studentenbund&quot; (organising a protest following Rudi Dutschke&#x27;s shooting). The government report stated &quot;If they have an ideological bible it consists of the work of Professor Herbert Marcuse, &quot;One-Dimensional Man&quot;.&quot; In line with the Marcusian viewpoint of championing politicised minority groups, throughout the 1970s, the NUS came to support what it called &quot;liberation campaigns&quot;, including; homosexual rights (the first national group to do so in 1973), radical feminism and black nationalism. At the same time, the NUS adopted a No Platform policy; a concept pioneered by the IMG in 1972; to stifle the campus organisation and speech of nationalistic British groups that it declared to be &quot;racist or fascist&quot;. At the time, this was aimed at the National Front and the Monday Club (a faction in the Federation of Conservative Students).

The union was also involved in affairs in Northern Ireland, where most higher education establishments there were members of both the NUS and the Union of Students in Ireland (USI), though this differed from case to case. Indeed, two presidents of the NUS earlier on in the 1960s were from The Queen&#x27;s University of Belfast (Queen&#x27;s or QUB); T. William Savage and T. Geoff Martin. The 1968–69 unrest in Northern Ireland saw the onset of The Troubles and a sectarian divisiveness come to the fore. After members of the QUBSU organised a protest against the hardline Unionist politician Bill Craig, the then Minister of Home Affairs, some members such as Bernadette Devlin, Eamonn McCann and Michael Farrell decided to found the Trotskyist group People&#x27;s Democracy in 1968, which played a role in the Northern Ireland civil rights movement. Following a meeting in Galway in 1972, to combat divisions, it was agreed that a group called the NUS-USI would be founded with dual-membership to cover Northern Ireland.

One of the NUS&#x27; protest campaigns which was of particular significance during the 1970s and the 1980s was the boycott campaign against National Party governed South Africa as part of the Anti-Apartheid Movement. In 1970, NUS vice president Tony Klug visited South Africa and met with Steve Biko of the SASO among others. Members also attempted to disrupt South African rugby and cricket matches in the United Kingdom during the 1970s. In the 1980s, the NUS played a significant role in getting Barclay&#x27;s Bank to divest from South Africa, attacking it as &quot;Boerclay Bank&quot;.

Throughout this period, the NUS presidency was dominated by the Broad Left, within which the Communist Party of Great Britain (where Eurocommunism was most popular among students rather than the pro-Soviet &quot;Tankie&quot; anti-revisionists) predominated and usually supplied the president, but were backed up by Labour and the Liberals. They did so to work as a voting bloc against both the Conservatives and Militant. The first of these Broad Left presidents was Charles Clarke (later a Home Secretary under Blair) who as a member of the Clause Four Group, won the National Organisation of Labour Students back from Militant influence. Other presidents included Sue Slipman (who began on the Eurocommunist wing on the Communist Party of Great Britain but ended up a founding member of the Social Democratic Party by 1981), Trevor Phillips (a Broad Left independent and the first black NUS president, who later led the race relations group the Runnymede Trust) and David Aaronovitch (who was then a Eurocommunist, but later became a journalist aligned to neoconservatism).

===Labour Students presidency, 1982–2000===
From 1982 with the election of Neil Stewart, until Andrew Pakes stood down in 2000, the presidency of the National Union of Students was controlled by the National Organisation of Labour Students, which shortened its name to Labour Students in 1994. Notable NUS Presidents of this period included Phil Woolas, Maeve Sherlock and Stephen Twigg.

===History in the 21st century===

====Fairtrade====
The campaign has since been extended into Students Organising for Sustainability (SOS-UK), an educational charity responding to the climate emergency and ecological crisis.

The Fairtrade Foundation collaborated with the NUS in awarding The Fairtrade Universities and Colleges Award, which started as a pilot in 2017. As of 2020, twelve universities had achieved Fairtrade status.

====Education finance====

Under the leadership of Wes Streeting the NUS abandoned its long-standing commitment to free education and backed a graduate tax as its preferred outcome of the Browne Review into higher education funding. Before the 2010 General Election, the NUS invited candidates to sign a pledge not to raise tuition fees, receiving over 1000 signatories from prospective parliamentary candidates. This became a very high-profile campaign when many Liberal Democrat MPs, who all signed individual NUS pledges stating they would vote against any rise in tuition fees if elected, had to abstain or do the opposite as part of their coalition agreement.

The NUS, under new leader Aaron Porter, organised a national protest attended by thousands in November 2010, demanding an end to education cuts. The march route passed Whitehall and the Conservative Party headquarters at Millbank Tower. As they marched past the building, some protesters diverted in to the courtyard of Millbank Tower and began an occupation of the building.

With an attendance of over 50,000 people, it was the largest British demonstration since the Iraq War protest. This led to various more demos until the rise in tuition fees was passed.

The day before the vote to allow a rise in tuition fees, the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; reported that they had seen emails that suggested Aaron Porter had supported, rather than increase tuition fees, cuts of up to 80% should be made to student support packages including grants and loans. Porter responded to the claims on NUS Connect that &quot;In all of these meetings and communications we stated our firm and clear opposition to cuts&quot; and that the distortion of the discussions was &quot;political desperation from a coalition government losing the arguments on its own policies&quot;.

On 9 April 2014 the National Union of Students passed policy at its national conference to reverse its position on education funding. The call for a graduate tax was abandoned in favour of calls for free education funded through progressive taxation.

====Governance review====

The 2008 Conference in Blackpool was dominated by the governance review debate and vote. The proposals were for a restructuring of the running of the Union but the vote was lost by 25 votes (a two-thirds majority was required). The review was criticised for what was felt by detractors to be an attack on the organisation&#x27;s democratic accountability. Its supporters however defended the review as providing a more &#x27;innovative&#x27; corporate structure which was hoped to make it more credible in negotiating policy, rather than simply &#x27;reactive&#x27;. This was not well received by many in the executive with President, Gemma Tumelty, vowing to press ahead with reform. The perceived lack of progress on governance reform also prompted Imperial College Union to hold a referendum on disaffiliation.

====ISIS, Malia Bouattia, and disaffiliations====
In October 2014, NUS National Executive Committee rejected a motion to condemn the militant group Islamic State because some executive members &quot;felt that the wording of the motion being presented would unfairly demonise all Muslims rather than solely the group of people it set out to rightfully condemn.&quot; NUS received criticism for this stance given its previous condemnation of the UKIP political party. Despite a statement from NUS confirming that &quot;a new motion will be taken to the next NUS National Executive Committee meeting, which will specifically condemn the politics and methods of ISIS and offer solidarity for the Kurdish people,&quot; media coverage of the vote caused some students&#x27; union members to speculate that the NUS itself has been infiltrated by extremist sympathisers. At the following executive meeting on 3 December 2014, a similar motion, which condemned ISIS, expressed solidarity with the Kurdish people, and called on NUS to challenge &quot;Islamophobia and all forms of racism being whipped up&quot; was resubmitted and easily passed.

At the 2016 NUS conference, Malia Bouattia was elected president with 50.9% of the vote defeating Megan Dunn who had sought re-election. Bouattia was soon subject to several allegations of antisemitism; an October 2016 report by the House of Commons Home Affairs Select Committee described her comments as &quot;outright racism&quot;, and said that she was not taking issues of antisemitism on university campuses seriously enough. Bouattia was condemned by over 300 Jewish student leaders, the Union of Jewish Students and Oxford University Student Union. In response to her election, students at Durham, Loughborough, Hull, Aberystwyth, Oxford, Cambridge, Manchester, Essex, York, King&#x27;s College London, Nottingham, UWE, Leicester, Queen Mary University of London and Reading University began campaigning to disaffiliate from the NUS. Newcastle, Portsmouth, Hull and Loughbrough disaffiliated; the remainder maintained affiliation, although NUS reportedly broke campaigning rules at Oxford, Cambridge, and Christ Church.

In April 2017, Bouattia was defeated in her re-election by Shakira Martin, the union&#x27;s vice-president for further education, who received 56% of the vote.
Martin pledged &quot;unity&quot;, &quot;pragmatism&quot;, and putting &quot;NUS back into the hands of its membership&quot;. Moderate groups such as the Organised Independents and Union of Jewish Students sought to reform the organisation to prevent further disaffiliations, passing major democratic reform motions. The changes, developed from &quot;two [years] of consultation with hundreds of students&#x27; unions, [as well as] legal and expert advice,&quot; were described as &quot;the most comprehensive and wide-ranging structural reforms in NUS history&quot;.

==== Threat of bankruptcy ====
On 2 November 2018, it was reported that the NUS faced bankruptcy. The 2017 reforms had not been delivered, and several years of financial mismanagement had created a significant decline in resources. Martin wrote to members that the union would be &quot;taking urgent action to stabilise&quot;, with reforms being developed for &quot;consideration and refinement with the help of our members&quot;. Martin faced criticism for developing a drastic programme of financial, governance and campaigning reforms for approval by the 2019 National Conference; however after around five hours of debate, 700 delegates voted in favour of the package. Martin welcomed the vote, calling it a &quot;momentous decision to endorse reform and deliver the vision of members&quot;.

==== New NUS ====
In 2020, NUS official split into two organisations: NUS UK and NUS Charity. NUS UK focuses on campaigning with students while NUS Charity focuses on supporting students&#x27; unions.

==== Report into institutional antisemitic behaviour ====

In May 2022, the UK Government announced it would sever all ties with the NUS on the basis claiming that it had failed to tackle “antisemitic rot at the heart&quot;. Also in May 2022, NUS announced that Rebecca Tuck QC would lead an independent investigation into allegations of antisemitism within NUS. Following her inquiry, Shaima Dallali was dismissed as NUS President in November 2022.

The independent investigation found that NUS has failed to sufficiently challenge antisemitism and hostility towards Jews in its own structures. Jewish students have been &quot;subjected to harassment&quot; and NUS policies have been breached. The NUS apologised to Jewish students and said it would implement the report&#x27;s recommendations.

==Democracy==

The NUS holds national conferences once a year. National Conference is the sovereign body of NUS, and is where NUS policy is decided. Regional Conferences are run to enhance the representation of members from Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Prior to the 2019 reforms other conferences such as Women&#x27;s Conference, Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual &amp; Trans Students&#x27; Conference (changed as of 2004), Disabled Students&#x27; Conference, Black Students&#x27; Conference, Mature and Part-Time Students&#x27; Conference and the International Students&#x27; Conference (created in 2004) were run to enhance the representation of the specific members they included. Post-2019 the Women&#x27;s, LGBT, Trans, Disabled, and Black Students&#x27; Conferences have been merged into a single Liberation Conference and the Mature and Part-Time, Postgraduate, and International Students&#x27; Conferences are no longer in operation.

In July 2014, due to the creation of a new NUS London area, the first NUS London conference was held. Most of these conferences, and in particular the elections held at them, are contested by factions including Conservative, Labour Students, the Young Liberals, National Campaign Against Fees and Cuts, the Organised Independents, Young Independence, Socialist Students, Socialist Workers&#x27; Student Society, Student RESPECT and Liberation Left. In addition to these political factions, interest groups such as the Federation of Student Islamic Societies and the Union of Jewish Students are deeply involved in the internal democratic processes of the NUS.

==NUS Services==
The Association for Managers in Students&#x27; Unions voted to merge with NUS and NUS Services in 2010.

===TOTUM===
TOTUM, formerly known as NUS Extra, is a discount card which can be purchased by students. It is produced by NUS Services in conjunction with NUS, and affiliated students&#x27; unions receive a commission on every card sold to their members, however the card is available to all students regardless of whether they are members of an affiliated student union or not. TOTUM users are also eligible to apply for a NUS PASS-approved identification card.

===NUS Charitable Services===

NUS has established a charity to drive improvement in students&#x27; unions. It will focus on students&#x27; union quality, talent management, equality and diversity, strategic development and turnaround, ethical and environmental work, and fundraising.

Ethical and environmental work

To encourage environmental sustainability, the NUS organises behavioural change programmes among staff and students, such as Green Impact, Student Switch Off, and Student Eats.

NUS&#x27;s ethical and environmental department originated in 1995, forming a committee tasked with investigating allegations of environmental bad practice at Bass breweries.

In 2016, the department managed the pilot year of NUS Students&#x27; Green Fund – a £5 million grant from HEFCE, supporting 25 student-led, transformative sustainability projects at students&#x27; unions across England.

In 2019, this department became an independent organisation called Students Organisation for Sustainability UK.

==Criticisms==
The NUS has come in for criticism from those students&#x27; unions who are not affiliated. Sen Ganesh, then president of Imperial College Union, said in 2002 that &quot;NUS&#x27;s claim to be representative of students is not borne out by their work&quot;, especially as &quot;the NUS is dominated by Labour students and this diminishes the ability to address student issues in an impartial fashion&quot;.

Another criticism leveled at NUS is the absence of direct democracy in electing national officers. Officers of NUS are elected at conferences by delegates chosen by affiliated unions of NUS. Critics, from both within and outside the student movement, have argued that consultation by unions with their members over who should represent the students&#x27; union at national conferences is often minimal, and some have argued in favour of changes to the NUS constitution that would result in a one-member-one-vote policy.

The NUS has also been criticised for prioritisation of NUS Extra over campaigning on issues which affect students. 

===Financial crisis===
In the mid-2000s, NUS faced a financial crisis, caused by a coinciding of spiraling expenditure and decreasing income. A series of measures were proposed to address this, of which the most controversial included a series of changes to the constitutional and democratic processes. In 2004, two emergency conferences passed some of the changes proposed, albeit not without fierce dispute between those claiming the proposals were necessary reforms to maintain the existence of the organisation and those arguing that they were aimed at curbing democracy and involvement. The 2006 NUS Conference passed a policy which enabled NUS to launch NUS Extra in September 2006.

=== &quot;Liar Liar&quot; campaign ===
In the run up to the 2015 general election the NUS launched its &quot;Liar Liar&quot; campaign aimed at unseating members of Parliament (MPs) who broke promises regarding the cost of education. At an estimated cost of £40,000 and consisting of a social media campaign alongside billboards, the campaign was well-received by many students, but also came under criticism for being politically motivated specifically against Liberal Democrat MPs as opposed to members of all parties.

Posters promoting the campaign were also removed from several railway stations on the grounds that Network Rail is an &quot;arms length public sector body&quot; and must therefore remain politically neutral. The NUS claimed that the removal of the posters was an attempt to &quot;gag&quot; the union.

NUS president Toni Pearce defended the union&#x27;s actions saying that the breach of a promise regarding tuition fees: &quot;Wasn&#x27;t a minor misdemeanour. It was an outright lie. We have an obligation to hold them to account for this, and we will.&quot;

<doc id="205856" wikidata="Q1354247" url="?curid=205856" title="Oscar Micheaux">
<text>Oscar Devereaux Micheaux (; (January 2, 1884 – March 25, 1951) was an American author, film director and independent producer of more than 44 films. Although the short-lived Lincoln Motion Picture Company was the first movie company owned and controlled by black filmmakers, Micheaux is regarded as the first major African-American feature filmmaker, a prominent producer of race films, and has been described as &quot;the most successful African-American filmmaker of the first half of the 20th century&quot;. He produced both silent films and sound films.

==Early life and education==
Micheaux was born on a farm in Metropolis, Illinois, on January 2, 1884. He was the fifth child born to Calvin S. and Belle Michaux, who had a total of 13 children. In his later years, Micheaux added an &quot;e&quot; to his last name. His father was born into slavery in Kentucky. Because of his surname, his father&#x27;s family appears to have been enslaved by French-descended settlers. French Huguenot refugees had settled in Virginia in 1700; their descendants took slaves west when they migrated into Kentucky after the American Revolutionary War.

In his later years, Micheaux wrote about the social oppression he experienced as a young boy. His parents moved to the city so that the children could receive a better education. Micheaux attended a well-established school for several years before the family eventually ran into money troubles and were forced to return to the farm. The discontented Micheaux became rebellious and his struggles caused problems within his family. His father was not happy with him and sent him away to do marketing in the city. Micheaux found pleasure in this job because he was able to speak to many new people and learned social skills that he would later reflect in his films.

When Micheaux was 17 years old, he moved to Chicago to live with his older brother, then working as a waiter. Micheaux became dissatisfied with what he viewed as his brother&#x27;s way of living &quot;the good life&quot;. He rented his own place and found work in the stockyards, which he found difficult. He moved from the stockyards to the steel mills, holding down many different jobs.

After being &quot;swindled out of two dollars&quot; by an employment agency, Micheaux decided to become his own boss. His first business was a shoeshine stand, which he set up at a wealthy African American barbershop, away from Chicago competition. He learned the basic strategies of business and started to save money. He became a Pullman porter on the major railroads, at that time considered prestigious employment for African Americans because it was relatively stable, well paid, and secure, and it enabled travel and interaction with new people. This job was an informal education for Micheaux. He profited financially, and also gained contacts and knowledge about the world through traveling as well as a greater understanding for business. When he left the position, he had seen much of the United States, had a couple of thousand dollars saved in his bank account, and had made a number of connections with wealthy white people who helped his future endeavors.

Micheaux moved to Gregory County, South Dakota, where he bought land and worked as a homesteader. This experience inspired his first novels and films. His neighbors on the frontier were predominately blue collar whites. &quot;Some recall that [Micheaux] rarely sat at a table with his blue collar white neighbors.&quot; Micheaux&#x27;s years as a homesteader allowed him to learn more about human relations and farming. While farming, Micheaux wrote articles and submitted them to the press. &quot;The Chicago Defender&quot; published one of his earliest articles. His homestead failed and he was forced to sell it in 1911. The next year, he began his publishing career when Woodruff Press of Lincoln, Nebraska published &quot;The Conquest&quot;. He began work on a second book, &quot;The Forged Note&quot;, and from 1914 to 1918 traveled among Lincoln, Gregory County, and Sioux City, Iowa marketing his work. While in Sioux City, he lived in and was influenced by the West 7th Street neighborhood where the town&#x27;s African-American community had a strong presence.

==Writing and film career==

Micheaux decided to concentrate on writing and, eventually, filmmaking, a new industry. He wrote seven novels. 

In 1913, 1,000 copies of his first book, &quot;The Conquest: The Story of a Negro Pioneer&quot;, were printed. He published the book anonymously, for unknown reasons. He based it on his experiences as a homesteader and the failure of his first marriage and it was largely autobiographical. Although character names have been changed, the protagonist is named Oscar Devereaux. His theme was about African Americans realizing their potential and succeeding in areas where they had not felt they could. The book outlines the difference between city lifestyles of Negroes and the life he decided to lead as a lone Negro out on the far West as a pioneer. He discusses the culture of doers who want to accomplish and those who see themselves as victims of injustice and hopelessness and who do not want to try to succeed, but instead like to pretend to be successful while living the city lifestyle in poverty. He had become frustrated with getting some members of his race to populate the frontier and make something of themselves, with real work and property investment. He wrote more than 100 letters to fellow Negroes in the East beckoning them to come West, but only his older brother eventually took his advice. One of Micheaux&#x27;s fundamental beliefs was that hard work and enterprise would make any person rise to respect and prominence no matter his or her race.

In 1918, his novel &quot;The Homesteader&quot;, dedicated to his mother, attracted the attention of George Johnson, the manager of the Lincoln Motion Picture Company in Los Angeles. After Johnson offered to make &quot;The Homesteader&quot; into a new feature film, negotiations and paperwork became inharmonious. Micheaux wanted to be directly involved in the adaptation of his book as a movie, but Johnson resisted and never produced the film.

Instead, Micheaux founded the Micheaux Film &amp; Book Company of Sioux City; its first project was the production of &quot;The Homesteader&quot; as a feature film. Micheaux had a major career as a film producer and director: He produced more than 40 films, which drew audiences throughout the U.S. as well as internationally. Micheaux contacted wealthy academic connections from his earlier career as a porter, and sold stock for his company at $75 to $100 a share. Micheaux hired actors and actresses and decided to have the premiere in Chicago. The film and Micheaux received high praise from film critics. One article credited Micheaux with &quot;a historic breakthrough, a creditable, dignified achievement&quot;. Some members of the Chicago clergy criticized the film as libelous. &quot;The Homesteader&quot; became known as Micheaux&#x27;s breakout film; it helped him become widely known as a writer and a filmmaker.

In addition to writing and directing his own films, Micheaux also adapted the works of different writers for his silent pictures. Many of his films were open, blunt and thought-provoking regarding certain racial issues of that time. He once commented: &quot;It is only by presenting those portions of the race portrayed in my pictures, in the light and background of their true state, that we can raise our people to greater heights.&quot; Financial hardships during the Great Depression eventually made it impossible for Micheaux to keep producing films, and he returned to writing.

==Films==
Micheaux&#x27;s first novel &quot;The Conquest&quot; was adapted to film and re-titled &quot;The Homesteader&quot;. This film, released in 1919, met with critical and commercial success. It revolves around a man named Jean Baptiste, called the Homesteader, who falls in love with many white women but resists marrying one out of his loyalty to his race. Baptiste sacrifices love to be a key symbol for his fellow African Americans. He looks for love among his own people and marries an African-American woman. Relations between the couple deteriorate. Eventually, Baptiste is not allowed to see his wife. She kills her father for keeping them apart and commits suicide. Baptiste is accused of the crime, but is ultimately cleared. An old love helps him through his troubles. After he learns that she is a mulatto and thus part-African, they marry. This film deals extensively with race relationships.

Micheaux&#x27;s second silent film was &quot;Within Our Gates&quot;, produced in 1920. Although sometimes considered his response to the film &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot;, Micheaux said that he created it independently as a response to the widespread social instability following World War I. &quot;Within Our Gates&quot; revolved around the main character, Sylvia Landry, a mixed-race school teacher played by actress Evelyn Preer. In a flashback, Sylvia is shown growing up as the adopted daughter of a sharecropper. When her father confronts their white landlord over money, a fight ensues. The landlord is shot by another white man, but Sylvia&#x27;s adoptive father is accused and lynched with her adoptive mother.

Sylvia is almost raped by the landowner&#x27;s brother but discovers that he is her biological father. Micheaux always depicts African Americans as being serious and reaching for higher education. Before the flashback scene, we see that Sylvia travels to Boston, seeking funding for her school, which serves black children. They are underserved by the segregated society. On her journey, she is hit by the car of a rich white woman. Learning about Landry&#x27;s cause, the woman decides to give her school $50,000.

In the film, Micheaux depicts educated and professional people in black society as light-skinned, representing the elite status of some of the mixed-race people who comprised the majority of African Americans free before the Civil War. Poor people are represented as dark-skinned and with more undiluted African ancestry. Mixed-race people also feature as some of the villains. The film is set within the Jim Crow era. It contrasted the experiences for African Americans who stayed in rural areas and others who had migrated to cities and become urbanized. Micheaux explored the suffering of African Americans in the present day, without explaining how the situation arose in history. Some feared that this film would cause even more unrest within society, and others believed it would open the public&#x27;s eyes to the unjust treatment of blacks by whites. Protests against the film continued until the day it was released. Because of its controversial status, the film was banned from some theaters.

Micheaux adapted two works by Charles W. Chesnutt, which he released under their original titles: &quot;The Conjure Woman&quot; (1926) and &quot;The House Behind the Cedars&quot; (1927). The latter, which dealt with issues of mixed race and passing, created so much controversy when reviewed by the Film Board of Virginia that Micheaux was forced to make cuts to have it shown. He remade this story as a sound film in 1932, releasing it with the title &quot;Veiled Aristocrats&quot;. The silent version of the film is believed to have been lost.

==Themes==
Micheaux&#x27;s films were made during a time of great change in the African-American community. His films featured contemporary black life. He dealt with racial relationships between blacks and whites, and the challenges for blacks when trying to achieve success in the larger society. His films were used to oppose and discuss the racial injustice that African Americans received. Topics such as lynching, job discrimination, rape, mob violence, and economic exploitation were depicted in his films. These films also reflect his ideologies and autobiographical experiences.

Micheaux sought to create films that would counter negative portrayals of African Americans in films by white producers, which trafficked in degrading stereotypes. He created complex characters of different classes. His films questioned the value system of both African-American and Euro-American societies, which stirred controversy with the press and state censors.

==Style==
Critic Barbara Lupack described Micheaux as pursuing moderation with his films and creating a &quot;middle-class cinema&quot;. His works were designed to appeal to both middle- and lower-class audiences.

Micheaux said,

My results ... might have been narrow at times, due perhaps to certain limited situations, which I endeavored to portray, but in those limited situations, the truth was the predominant characteristic. It is only by presenting those portions of the race portrayed in my pictures, in the light and background of their true state, that we can raise our people to greater heights. I am too imbued with the spirit of Booker T. Washington to engraft false virtues upon ourselves, to make ourselves that which we are not.

==Death==
Micheaux died on March 25, 1951, in Charlotte, North Carolina, of heart failure, aged 67. He is buried in Great Bend Cemetery in Great Bend, Kansas, the home of his youth. His gravestone reads: &quot;A man ahead of his time&quot;.

== Personal life ==
In South Dakota, Micheaux married Orlean McCracken. Her family proved to be complex and burdensome for Micheaux. Unhappy with their living arrangements, Orlean felt that Micheaux did not pay enough attention to her. She gave birth while he was away on business, and was reported to have emptied their bank accounts and fled. Orlean&#x27;s father sold Micheaux&#x27;s property and took the money from the sale. After his return, Micheaux tried unsuccessfully to get Orlean and his property back. He married Alice B. Russell in 1926. Oscar and Alice remained married until his death.

===&quot;The Czar of Black Hollywood&quot;===
In 2014, Block Starz Music Television released &quot;The Czar of Black Hollywood&quot;, a documentary film chronicling the early life and career of Oscar Micheaux using Library of Congress archived footage, photos, illustrations and vintage music. The film was announced by American radio host Tom Joyner on his nationally syndicated program, &quot;The Tom Joyner Morning Show&quot;, as part of a &quot;Little Known Black History Fact&quot; on Micheaux. In an interview with &quot;The Washington Times&quot;, filmmaker Bayer Mack said he read the 2007 biography &quot;Oscar Micheaux: The Great and Only&quot; by Patrick McGilligan and was inspired to produce &quot;The Czar of Black Hollywood&quot; because Micheaux&#x27;s life mirrored his own. Mack told &quot;The Huffington Post&quot; he was shocked that, in spite of Micheaux&#x27;s historical significance, there was &quot;virtually nothing out there about [his] life&quot;. The film&#x27;s executive producer, Frances Presley Rice, told the &quot;Sun Sentinel&quot; that Micheaux was the first &quot;indie movie producer&quot;. In 2018, Mack was interviewed by the news site &quot;Mic&quot; for its &quot;Black Monuments Project&quot;, which named Oscar Micheaux as one of its 50 African Americans deserving of a statue. He said Micheaux embodied &quot;the best of what we all are as Americans&quot; and that the filmmaker was &quot;an inspiration&quot;.
A historical marker in Roanoke, Virginia, commemorates his time living and working in the city as a film producer.

<text>Steven Weinberg (; May 3, 1933 – July 23, 2021) was an American theoretical physicist and Nobel laureate in physics for his contributions with Abdus Salam and Sheldon Glashow to the unification of the weak force and electromagnetic interaction between elementary particles.

He held the Josey Regental Chair in Science at the University of Texas at Austin, where he was a member of the Physics and Astronomy Departments. His research on elementary particles and physical cosmology was honored with numerous prizes and awards, including the 1979 Nobel Prize in physics and the 1991 National Medal of Science. In 2004, he received the Benjamin Franklin Medal of the American Philosophical Society, with a citation that said he was &quot;considered by many to be the preeminent theoretical physicist alive in the world today.&quot; He was elected to the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, Britain&#x27;s Royal Society, the American Philosophical Society, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

Weinberg&#x27;s articles on various subjects occasionally appeared in &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot; and other periodicals. He served as a consultant at the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, president of the Philosophical Society of Texas, and member of the Board of Editors of &quot;Daedalus&quot; magazine, the Council of Scholars of the Library of Congress, the JASON group of defense consultants, and many other boards and committees.

==Early life==
Steven Weinberg was born in 1933 in New York City. His parents were Jewish immigrants; his father, Frederick, worked as a court stenographer, while his mother, Eva (Israel), was a housewife. Becoming interested in science at age 16 through a chemistry set handed down by a cousin, he graduated from Bronx High School of Science in 1950. He was in the same graduating class as Sheldon Glashow, whose research, independent of Weinberg&#x27;s, resulted in their (and Abdus Salam&#x27;s) sharing the 1979 Nobel in physics.

In a memoir published after his death in 2021, Weinberg wrote: &quot;Whatever native intelligence and intellectual curiosity I may have, I owe to my parents, in particular, my father.&quot;

Weinberg received his bachelor&#x27;s degree from Cornell University in 1954. There he resided at the Telluride House. He then went to the Niels Bohr Institute in Copenhagen, where he started his graduate studies and research. After one year, Weinberg moved to Princeton University, where he earned his Ph.D. in physics in 1957, completing his dissertation, &quot;The role of strong interactions in decay processes&quot;, under the supervision of Sam Treiman.

==Career and research==
After completing his Ph.D., Weinberg worked as a postdoctoral researcher at Columbia University (1957–59) and University of California, Berkeley (1959) and then was promoted to faculty at Berkeley (1960–66). He did research in a variety of topics of particle physics, such as the high energy behavior of quantum field theory, symmetry breaking, pion scattering, infrared photons and quantum gravity (soft graviton theorem). It was also during this time that he developed the approach to quantum field theory described in the first chapters of his book &quot;The Quantum Theory of Fields&quot; and started to write his textbook &quot;Gravitation and Cosmology&quot;, having taken up an interest in general relativity after the discovery of cosmic microwave background radiation. He was also appointed the senior scientist at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory. &quot;The Quantum Theory of Fields&quot; spanned three volumes and over 1,500 pages, and is often regarded as the leading book in the field.

In 1966, Weinberg left Berkeley and accepted a lecturer position at Harvard. In 1967 he was a visiting professor at MIT. It was in that year at MIT that Weinberg proposed his model of unification of electromagnetism and nuclear weak forces (such as those involved in beta-decay and kaon-decay), with the masses of the force-carriers of the weak part of the interaction being explained by spontaneous symmetry breaking. One of its fundamental aspects was the prediction of the existence of the Higgs boson. Weinberg&#x27;s model, now known as the electroweak unification theory, had the same symmetry structure as that proposed by Glashow in 1961: both included the then-unknown weak interaction mechanism between leptons, known as neutral current and mediated by the Z boson. The 1973 experimental discovery of weak neutral currents (mediated by this Z boson) was one verification of the electroweak unification. The paper by Weinberg in which he presented this theory is one of the most cited works ever in high-energy physics.

After his 1967 seminal work on the unification of weak and electromagnetic interactions, Weinberg continued his work in many aspects of particle physics, quantum field theory, gravity, supersymmetry, superstrings and cosmology. In the years after 1967, the full Standard Model of elementary particle theory was developed through the work of many contributors. In it, the weak and electromagnetic interactions already unified by the work of Weinberg, Salam and Glashow, are made consistent with a theory of the strong interactions between quarks, in one overarching theory. In 1973, Weinberg proposed a modification of the Standard Model that did not contain that model&#x27;s fundamental Higgs boson. Also during the 1970s, he proposed a theory later known as technicolor, in which new strong interactions resolve the hierarchy problem.

Weinberg became Eugene Higgins Professor of Physics at Harvard University in 1973, a post he held until 1983. In 1979 he pioneered the modern view on the renormalization aspect of quantum field theory that considers all quantum field theories effective field theories and changed the viewpoint of previous work (including his own in his 1967 paper) that a sensible quantum field theory must be renormalizable. This approach allowed the development of effective theory of quantum gravity, low energy QCD, heavy quark effective field theory and other developments, and is a topic of considerable interest in current research.

In 1979, some six years after the experimental discovery of the neutral currents—i.e. the discovery of the inferred existence of the Z boson—but after the 1978 experimental discovery of the theory&#x27;s predicted amount of parity violation due to Z bosons&#x27; mixing with electromagnetic interactions, Weinberg was awarded the Nobel Prize in physics with Glashow and Salam, who had independently proposed a theory of electroweak unification based on spontaneous symmetry breaking.

In 1982 Weinberg moved to the University of Texas at Austin as the Jack S. Josey-Welch Foundation Regents Chair in Science, and started a theoretical physics group at the university that now has eight full professors and is one of the leading research groups in the field in the U.S.

Weinberg is frequently listed among the top scientists with the highest research effect indices, such as the h-index and the creativity index. The theoretical physicist Peter Woit called Weinberg &quot;arguably the dominant figure in theoretical particle physics during its period of great success from the late sixties to the early eighties&quot;, calling his contribution to electroweak unification &quot;to this day at the center of the Standard Model, our best understanding of fundamental physics&quot;. Science News named him along with fellow theorists Murray Gell-Mann and Richard Feynman the leading physicists of the era, commenting, &quot;Among his peers, Weinberg was one of the most respected figures in all of physics or perhaps all of science&quot;. Sean Carroll called Weinberg one of the “best physicists we had; one of the best thinkers of any variety” who “exhibited extraordinary verve and clarity of thought through the whole stretch of a long and productive life”, while John Preskill called him &quot;one of the most accomplished scientists of our age, and a particularly eloquent spokesperson for the scientific worldview&quot;. Brian Greene said that Weinberg had an “astounding ability to see into the deep workings of nature” that “profoundly shaped our understanding of the universe&quot;. Upon the awarding of the Breakthrough Prize in 2020, one of the founders of the prizes, Yuri Milner, called Weinberg a “key architect” of “one of the most successful physical theories ever”, while string theorist Juan Maldacena, the chair of the selection committee, said, “Steven Weinberg has developed many of the key theoretical tools that we use for the description of nature at a fundamental level&quot;.
===Other contributions===
Besides his scientific research, Weinberg was a public spokesman for science, testifying before Congress in support of the Superconducting Super Collider, writing articles for &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;, and giving various lectures on the larger meaning of science. His books on science written for the public combine the typical scientific popularization with what is traditionally considered history and philosophy of science and atheism. His first popular science book, &quot;The First Three Minutes: A Modern View of the Origin of the Universe&quot; (1977), described the start of the universe with the Big Bang and enunciated a case for its expansion.

Although still teaching physics, in later years he turned his hand to the history of science, efforts that culminated in &quot;To Explain the World: The Discovery of Modern Science&quot; (2015). A hostile review in the Wall Street Journal by Steven Shapin attracted a number of commentaries, a response by Weinberg, and an exchange of views between Weinberg and Arthur Silverstein in the &quot;NYRB&quot; in February 2016.

In 2016, Weinberg became a default leader for faculty and students opposed to a new law allowing the carrying of concealed guns in UT classrooms. He announced that he would prohibit guns in his classes, and said he would stand by his decision to violate university regulations in this matter even if faced with a lawsuit. Weinberg never retired and taught at UT until his death.

==Personal life and archive ==
In 1954 Weinberg married legal scholar Louise Goldwasser and they had a daughter, Elizabeth.

Weinberg died on July 23, 2021, at age 88 at a hospital in Austin, where he had been undergoing treatment for several weeks.

Weinberg&#x27;s papers were donated to the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas.

==Worldview==
Weinberg identified as a liberal.

===Views on religion===
Weinberg was an atheist. Before he was an advocate of the Big Bang theory, Weinberg said: &quot;The steady-state theory is philosophically the most attractive theory because it least resembles the account given in Genesis.&quot;

===Views on Israel===
Weinberg was known for his support of Israel, which he characterized as &quot;the &#x27;most exposed salient&#x27; in a war between liberal democracies and Muslim theocracies.&quot; He wrote the 1997 essay &quot;Zionism and Its Adversaries&quot; on the issue.

In the 2000s, Weinberg canceled trips to universities in the United Kingdom because of the British boycotts of Israel. At the time, he said: &quot;Given the history of the attacks on Israel and the oppressiveness and aggressiveness of other countries in the Middle East and elsewhere, boycotting Israel indicated a moral blindness for which it is hard to find any explanation other than antisemitism.&quot;

<text>The Accipitriformes (; ) are an order of birds that includes most of the diurnal birds of prey, including hawks, eagles,
vultures, and kites, but not falcons.

For a long time, the majority view was to include them with the falcons in the Falconiformes, but many authorities now recognize a separate order Accipitriformes. A DNA study published in 2008 indicated that falcons are not closely related to the Accipitriformes, being instead more closely related to parrots and passerines. Since then, the split and the placement of the falcons next to the parrots in taxonomic order has been adopted by the American Ornithological Society&#x27;s South American Classification Committee (SACC), its North American Classification Committee (NACC), and the International Ornithological Congress (IOC). The British Ornithologists&#x27; Union already recognized the Accipitriformes, and has adopted the move of Falconiformes. The DNA-based proposal and the NACC and IOC classifications include the New World vultures in the Accipitriformes, while the SACC classifies the New World vultures as a separate order, the Cathartiformes. When Cathartiformes is considered a separate order, sister to Accipitriformes, Accipitriformes sensu lato is called Accipitrimorphae.

== Characteristics ==
The Accipitriformes are known from the Middle Eocene and typically have a sharply hooked beak with a soft cere housing the nostrils. Their wings are long and fairly broad, suitable for soaring flight, with the outer four to six primary feathers emarginated.

They have strong legs and feet with raptorial claws and opposable hind claws. Almost all Accipitriformes are carnivorous, hunting by sight during the day or at twilight. They are exceptionally long-lived, and most have low reproductive rates.

The young have a long, very fast-growing fledgling stage, followed by 3–8 weeks of nest care after first flight, and 1 to 3 years as sexually immature adults. The sexes have conspicuously different sizes and sometimes a female is more than twice as heavy as her mate. This sexual dimorphism is sometimes most extreme in specialized bird-eaters, such as the &quot;Accipiter&quot; hawks. Monogamy is the general rule, although an alternative mate is often selected if one dies.

== Taxonomy ==
Accipitriformes, currently with 262 species and 75 genera in 4 extant families and possibly 1 extinct family, is the largest diurnal raptor order. DNA sequence analyses suggest that divergences within Accipitriformes began around the Eocene/Oligocene boundary about 34 mya, with the split of the group including genera &quot;Elanus&quot; and &quot;Gampsonyx&quot; from the other Accipitriformes genera.

The order includes the following families:
Order Accipitriformes
* Accipitridae (eagles, harriers, hawks, kites, Old World vultures)
* Pandionidae (ospreys) (1 or 2 species)
* Cathartidae (Cathartid vultures and condors)
* Sagittariidae (secretarybird)
And the following extinct genera:
* Teratornithidae
* &quot;Diatropornis&quot;
* &quot;Parasarcoramphus&quot;

For a complete list of species, see list of Accipitriformes species.
* Sometimes considered a separate order

<text>The University of Kent (formerly the University of Kent at Canterbury, abbreviated as UKC) is a semi-collegiate public research university based in Kent, United Kingdom. The university was granted its royal charter on 4 January 1965 and the following year Princess Marina, Duchess of Kent, was formally installed as the first Chancellor. 

The university has its main campus north of Canterbury situated within of parkland, housing over 6,000 students, as well as a campus in Medway in Kent and a postgraduate centre in Paris. The university is international, with students from 158 different nationalities and 41% of its academic and research staff being from outside the United Kingdom. It is a member of the Santander Network of European universities encouraging social and economic development.

== History ==

=== Origins ===
A university in the city of Canterbury was first considered in 1947, when an anticipated growth in student numbers led several residents to seek the creation of a new university, including Kent. However, the plans never came to fruition. A decade later both population growth and greater demand for university places led to a re-consideration. In 1959 the Education Committee of Kent County Council explored the creation of a new university, formally accepting the proposal unanimously on 24 February 1960. Two months later the Education Committee agreed to seek a site at or near Canterbury, given the historical associations of the city, subject to the support of Canterbury City Council.

By 1962 a site was found at Beverley Farm, straddling the then boundary between the City of Canterbury and the administrative county of Kent. The university&#x27;s original name, chosen in 1962, was the &quot;University of Kent at Canterbury&quot;, reflecting its cross boundary campus. The name adopted reflected the support of both the city and county authorities; as well as the existence of the University of Canterbury in New Zealand, which officially opposed the use of a name too similar to its own. The abbreviation &quot;UKC&quot; became a popular abbreviation for the university.

=== 1965 to 2000 ===
The University of Kent at Canterbury was granted its Royal Charter on 4 January 1965 and the first group of 500 students arrived on 11 October 1965. 

On 30 March 1966 Princess Marina, Duchess of Kent was formally installed as the first Chancellor.

The university was envisaged as being a collegiate establishment, with most students living in one of the colleges on campus, and as specialising in inter-disciplinary studies in all fields. Over the years, changes in government policy and other changing demands have largely destroyed this original concept, leading to the present state, which is nearer the norm for a British university. However, the four original colleges – Darwin, Eliot, Keynes and Rutherford – remain, together with the newer Woolf and Turing colleges.

The university grew at a rapid rate throughout the 1960s, with three colleges and many other buildings on campus being completed by the end of the decade. The 1970s saw further construction, but the university also encountered the biggest physical problem in its history. The university had been built above a tunnel on the disused Canterbury and Whitstable Railway. In July 1974 the tunnel collapsed, damaging part of the Cornwallis Building, which sank nearly a metre within about an hour on the evening of 11 July. Fortunately, the university had insurance against subsidence, so it was able to pay for the south-west corner of the building to be demolished and replaced by a new wing at the other end of the building.

Unix computers arrived in 1976 and UKC set up the first Unix to Unix copy (UUCP) test service to Bell Labs in the U.S. in 1979. UKC provided the first UUCO connections to non-academic users in the UK in the early 1980s.

In 1982 the university opened the University Centre at Tonbridge (now the University of Kent at Tonbridge) for its School of Continuing education, helping to enhance the availability of teaching across the county. Building elsewhere included the Park Wood accommodation village and the Darwin houses in 1989.

During the 1990s and 2000s the university expanded beyond its original campus, establishing campuses in Medway, Tonbridge and Brussels, and partnerships with Canterbury College, West Kent College, South Kent College and MidKent College.

=== 2000 to present ===

In the 2000s the university entered a collaboration named Universities at Medway with the University of Greenwich, MidKent College and Canterbury Christ Church University to deliver university provision in the Medway area. This led to the development of the &quot;University of Kent at Medway&quot;, opened from 2001. Initially based at Mid-Kent College, a new joint campus opened in 2004. Small postgraduate centres opened in Paris in 2009, and later in Rome and Athens.

As a consequence of the expansion outside Canterbury the university&#x27;s name was formally changed to the &quot;University of Kent&quot; on 1 April 2003. Part of the original reasoning for the name disappeared when local government reforms in the 1970s resulted in the Canterbury campus falling entirely within the City of Canterbury, which no longer has county borough status, and Kent County Council.

In 2007 the university was rebranded with a new logo and website. The logo was chosen following consultation with existing university students and those in sixth forms across the country.

The University of Kent set its tuition fees for UK and European Union undergraduates at £9,000 for new entrants in 2012, which was approved by the Office for Fair Access (OFFA). The fee was approved by Council on 1 April 2011 and was confirmed by OFFA in July 2011. The proposed changes to UK and EU undergraduate tuition fees did not apply to international student fees.

Following the extension of Keynes College in 2001, two new colleges opened on the Canterbury campus, Woolf College for postgraduates in 2008 and Turing College for undergraduates in 2015. Several other new buildings were also added, including the Jarman School of Arts Building in 2009, the Colyer-Fergusson Music Building, a performing arts space, in 2012, and the Sibson building, housing maths and the business school, in 2017. A major £27m project to extend and refurbish the Templeman Library began in 2013, was completed in 2017 and formally opened in 2018. Additional accommodation was provided for students at the Medway Campus with the completion of Liberty Quays in 2009.

In 2015, the university held a number of events to celebrate its 50th anniversary. Festivals were held in Canterbury and Medway, a summer festival, the funding of twelve Beacon Projects and the temporary erection of a Ferris Wheel on the Canterbury campus. In 2016, a consultation was launched on a masterplan for future development of the Canterbury campus. In March 2017 it was announced that, in partnership with Canterbury Christ Church University, the University of Kent had been given funding to develop Kent and Medway Medical School. In 2023, more than 450 students in the Kent&#x27;s Student Union voted in favour of moving all catering to plant-based. The vote follows similar votes at other universities.

In June 2022, the University of Kent signed a twinning agreement with Kherson State University (KSU) in Ukraine as part of the UK government-backed Universities UK (UUK) initiative. The partnership aims to support KSU during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, providing academic and technical assistance, including online English classes, guest lectures, and research collaboration. This agreement is part of a broader effort by UK universities to support Ukrainian institutions affected by the war.

In 2024, as part of its &quot;Kent 2030&quot; strategy to address financial challenges, the University of Kent announced plans to discontinue six courses: anthropology, art history, health and social care, journalism, music and audio technology, and philosophy. This decision raised concerns among students and staff regarding the potential impact on academic diversity and future career opportunities. In response to the proposed course closures and the planned elimination of 58 jobs, staff at the university voted in favor of strike action. Additionally, a petition to preserve the affected courses garnered over 16,000 signatures.

== Campuses ==

=== Canterbury campus ===
The main Canterbury campus covers and is situated in parkland in an elevated position just over from the city centre, with views over the city and Canterbury Cathedral UNESCO world heritage site. The campus currently has approximately 12,000 full-time and 6,200 part-time students, with accommodation for over 5000, in addition to 600 academic and research staff. Residential and academic buildings are intermingled in the central part of the campus, science building are clustered west of Giles Lens and there is a dedicated student village on the western edge, several minutes’ walk from the main campus. The campus is ecologically diverse and home to a number of protected species, including Great Crested Newts. The North West of the site is heavily forested, including pockets of ancient woodland, while the Southern Slopes contain a mix of wildflower and hay meadows, and there are seven ponds spread across the campus.

==== Facilities ====

The campus has a selection of shops, including a grocery store, bookshop, pharmacy and launderettes. Food and drink is provided by range of cafes and bars run either by the university or the student union. Bars include K-bar, in Keynes College, Mungo&#x27;s, in Eliot College, Origins, in Darwin College, and Woody&#x27;s in the Park Wood Student Village. Cafeteria style food is available in Rutherford College, fine dining at the Beagle Restaurant in Darwin College, and food is served at the bars and other cafes around campus.

The campus nightclub, The Venue, was refurbished and modernised in 2010 and is open Wednesday to Saturday. The upstairs area was originally used a live music venue, known as The Lighthouse and then the Attic, but has since been replaced with the Student Media Centre which hosts Inquire, KTV and CSR. Club nights and live music are also held at various bars on campus.

Sporting facilities are spread across two main sites: the sports centre, which contains several multi-purpose sports halls, a fitness suite, squash courts and climbing wall, and the Sports Pavilion site, with a variety of indoor and outdoor sports pitches and training facilities, including 3G and astroturf.

=====Gulbenkian arts complex=====
The Gulbenkian arts complex includes a theatre and cinema, as well as a small stage which hosts monthly comedy nights as well as occasional shows such as Jazz at Five and The Chortle Student Comedy Awards. The adjacent Colyer-Fergusson Building, which opened in 2013, includes an adaptable format concert/rehearsal hall with retractable seating and variable acoustics and practice rooms. The Gulbenkian Theatre seats 340 and presents student, professional and amateur shows throughout the year. The theatre was opened in 1969 and was named after the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation which helped fund its construction. The Gulbenkian Cinema is an independent cinema in the Gulbenkian complex open to students and the general public. It is Kent&#x27;s regional film theatre showing new mainstream and non-mainstream releases as well as archive and foreign language films. In the daytime the cinema is used as a lecture theatre for University students. The Gulbenkian complex also hosts a cafe/ bar and restaurant facility open to students, staff and the general public.

==== Transport and access ====
The campus is accessed by road from either the West, with two entrances on the A290 Whitstable Road, or the East, via St Stephen&#x27;s Hill. An off-road foot and cycle route connects the central campus to the Northern edge of the city, and a regular bus services (‘UniBus’) is also in operation, although with a more limited service outside of term time. The A2 dual carriageway links the campus and city to London, the port at Dover and the national motorway network. The campus also lies at the southern end of the Crab and Winkle Way, a 7-mile off-road foot and cycle path running through farm and woodland to the coastal fishing town of Whitstable, providing a link for cycle commuters.

The closest railway station to the campus is Canterbury West which is, as of 2009, served by Southeastern services to London St Pancras. These services stop at Ashford International en route, thus providing a direct connection to Eurostar services to France and Belgium. Southeastern services also connect Canterbury West and Canterbury East stations with London Victoria and Charing Cross. Both of the Canterbury stations can be accessed by the UniBus service. The nearest international air services are provided from the London airports, Gatwick and Heathrow, with indirect National Express coach services to both from Canterbury Bus Station with one transfer at London Victoria Coach Station. The campus is also served by two coach services (Route 007) to/from London each day, with further services operating from Canterbury bus station.

=== Medway campus ===
In 2000 the university joined with other educational institutes to form the &quot;Universities for Medway&quot; initiative, aimed at increasing participation in higher education in the Medway Towns. The following year the &quot;University of Kent at Medway&quot; formally opened, initially based at Mid-Kent College. By 2004 a new campus for the university had been established in the old Chatham Dockyard, sharing a campus with Canterbury Christchurch University and University of Greenwich.

The University of Kent and Medway Park Leisure Centre have gone into a partnership to provide leisure facilities for university students and the general public. Medway Park (formerly the Black Lion Leisure Centre) was re-opened in 2011 by Princess Anne for use as a training venue for the 2012 London Olympics, as well as a training venue for the Egyptian and Congo National teams.

The campus accommodation, called Pier Quays, formerly named Liberty Quays until 2019 when Unite Group acquired Liberty Living, was finished in late 2009, and caters for over 600 students. The accommodation building includes a Tesco Express, Subway, and Domino&#x27;s Pizza, and Cargo, a bar showing sports, live music, and entertainment.

=== Tonbridge campus ===
In 1982 the university established the School of continuing education in the centre of Tonbridge, extending its coverage to the entire county of Kent. Many buildings were added in the 1980s and 1990s. The campus is now called the &quot;University of Kent at Tonbridge&quot;. It collaborates with the Kent Business School and Kent Innovation and Enterprise.

== Organisation and administration ==
=== Faculties, departments and schools ===
Until 2020, the university was divided into three faculties, humanities, sciences and social sciences, which are further sub-divided into 20 schools:
The original plan was to have no academic sub-divisions within the three faculties (initially Humanities, Social Sciences and Natural Sciences) and to incorporate an interdisciplinary element to all degrees through common first year courses (&quot;Part I&quot;) in each faculty, followed by specialist study in the second and final years (&quot;Part II&quot;). The lack of Departments encouraged the development of courses that crossed traditional divides, such as Chemical Physics, Chemistry with Control Engineering, Biological Chemistry and Environmental Physical Science.

However, the interdisciplinary approach proved increasingly complex for two reasons. The levels of specialisation at A Levels meant that many students had not studied particular subjects for some years and this made it impossible to devise a course that both covered areas unstudied by some and did not bore others. This proved an especial problem in Natural Sciences, where many Mathematics students had not studied Chemistry at A Level and vice versa.
 Additionally many subjects, particularly those in the Social Sciences, were not taught at A Level and required the first year as a grounding in the subject rather than an introduction to several different new subjects. Problems were especially encountered in the Faculty of Natural Sciences where the differing demands of Mathematics and physical sciences led to two almost completely separate programmes and student bases. In 1970 this led to the creation of the School of Mathematical Studies, standing outside the Faculties. The addition of other subjects led to increased pressure on common Part I programmes and increasingly students took more specialised Part I courses designed to prepare them for Part II study.

Substantial change to this structure did not come until the 1990s, driven more by national government policy than curricular demands, which were, after all, very flexible by nature. In 1989 the Universities Funding Council, which was merged into the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) in 1992, was charged by the UK Government to determine the cost for teaching each subject. To meet these accountancy requirements, Kent required for the first time that each member of staff declare a single discipline they would be affiliated with in future. When departments were formed in the early 1990s this led to a great deal of reorganisation of staff, and destroyed many existing inter-disciplinary relationships. Following the formation of departments, finance was devolved to departments based on how many students were taught. This quickly evolved into undermining the interdisciplinary context further, as departments sought to control finance by increasing the amount of specialist teaching in the first year.

The university now has the Faculties further divided into 18 Departments and Schools, ranging from the School of English to the Department of Biosciences, and from the Kent Law School to the Department of Economics. Also of note is the university&#x27;s Brussels School of International Studies, located in Brussels, Belgium. The school offers master&#x27;s degrees in international relations theory and international conflict analysis, along with an LLM in international law. In 2005 a new department, the Kent School of Architecture, began teaching its first students. In 2008, Wye College came under Kent&#x27;s remit, in joint partnership with Imperial College London.

In 2020, because of financial pressures caused by a combination of the 2000 demographic dip and the 2020/21 COVID-19 pandemic, the university abolished the faculties and reorganised itself into 6 divisions (see below).

=== Colleges ===
The university is divided into eight colleges, six colleges named after distinguished scholars, one college after a town and one named after a student village. Colleges have academic schools, lecture theatres, seminar rooms and halls of residence. Each college has a Master, who is responsible for student welfare within their college. In chronological order of construction they are:

The university also has an associate college named Chaucer College.

There was much discussion about the names adopted for most of the colleges with the following alternative names all in consideration at one point or another: for Eliot: Caxton, after William Caxton; for Keynes: Richborough, a town in Kent; Anselm, a former archbishop of Canterbury; and for Darwin: Anselm (again); Attlee, after Clement Attlee, the post-war Prime Minister; Becket, after Thomas Becket, another former archbishop (this was the recommendation of the college&#x27;s provisional committee but rejected by the Senate); Conrad; Elgar, after Edward Elgar; Maitland; Marlowe, after Christopher Marlowe; Russell, after Bertrand Russell (this was the recommendation of the Senate but rejected by the council); Tyler, after both Wat Tyler and Tyler Hill on which the campus stands. The name for the college proved especially contentious and was eventually decided by a postal ballot of members of the Senate, choosing from: Attlee, Conrad, Darwin, Elgar, Maitland, Marlowe and Tyler.
(Both Becket and Tyler were eventually used as the names for residential buildings on campuses and the building housing both the Architecture and Anthropology departments is named Marlowe.)

Each college has residential rooms, lecture theatres, study rooms, computer rooms and social areas. The intention of the &quot;colleges&quot; was that they should not be just Halls of residence, but complete &quot;academic&quot; communities. Each college (except Woolf) has its own bar, all rebuilt on a larger scale, and originally its own dining hall (only Rutherford still has a functioning dining hall; Darwin&#x27;s is hired out for conferences and events; Keynes&#x27;s was closed in 2000 and converted into academic space, but in 2011 Dolche Vita was expanded and became the dining hall for Keynes students in catered accommodation after Keynes&#x27;s expansion in 2011; and Eliot&#x27;s was closed in 2006). It was expected that each college (more were planned) would have around 600 students as members, with an equivalent proportion of staff, with half the students living within the college itself and the rest coming onto campus to eat and study within their colleges. Many facilities, ranging from accommodation, tutorials and alumni relations, would be handled on a college basis. With no planned academic divisions below the Faculty level, the colleges would be main focus of students&#x27; lives and there would be no units of a similar or smaller size to provide a rival focus of loyalties.

This vision of a collegiate university has increasingly fallen away. The funding for colleges did not keep pace with the growth in student numbers, with the result that only four colleges were built. In later years when there was heavy student demand for scarce accommodation in Canterbury the solution was found in building additional on-campus accommodation but not in the form of further colleges. The hopes that students living off campus would stay around to eat dinner in their colleges were not met, whilst the abolition of college amenities fees removed students&#x27; direct stake in their colleges. With the growth of specialist subject departments as well as of other university wide facilities, more and more of the role of colleges was transferred to the central university. Accommodation and catering were transferred to the centralised &quot;University of Kent at Canterbury Hospitality&quot; (UKCH).

Today the university does not operate as a traditional collegiate university – applications are made to the university as a whole, and many of the colleges rely on each other for day-to-day operation. Academic departments have no formal ties to colleges other than those that are located within particular college buildings due to availability of space, with lectures, seminars and tutorials taking place wherever there is an available room rather than on a college basis. Many students are allocated accommodation in their respective college, but some are housed in developments with no defined collegiate link whilst others are housed in different colleges.

Despite this the six College Student Committees, volunteer groups made up of elected officers and supporting volunteers, have retained a reasonably strong presence on campus. They run fundraising events and welfare campaigns throughout the academic year, and organise student events for their colleges during Welcome Week. Every student in the university retains a college affiliation to either Keynes, Eliot, Rutherford, Darwin or Park Wood even if they do not live in college accommodation. Students are encouraged to stay engaged with their College Committees throughout their time at the university.

=== Finances ===
In the financial year ended 31 July 2013, the University of Kent had a total income (including share of joint ventures) of £201.3 million, grew by 5.8% with an additional £21.4 million of fee income (2011/12 – £190.2 million) and total expenditure of £188.7 million (2011/12 – £175.9 million). Key sources of income included £98.5 million from tuition fees and education contracts (2011/12 – £77.2 million), £48.9 million from Funding Council grants (2011/12 – £62.5 million), £13.4 million from research grants and contracts (2011/12 – £11.4 million) and £1.2 million from endowment and investment income (2011/12 – £1.09 million). During the 2012/13 financial year the University of Kent had a capital expenditure of £28.2 million (2011/12 – £16.1 million).

At year end the University of Kent had endowment assets of £6.3 million (2011/12 – £6.04 million) and total net assets of £175.9 million (2011/12 – £165.1 million).

The annual income of the institution for 2021–22 was £260.4 million of which £17.7 million was from research grants and contracts, with an expenditure of £326.7 million.

=== Coat of arms and logo ===
The University of Kent&#x27;s coat of arms was granted by the College of Arms in September 1967. The white horse of Kent is taken from the arms of the County of Kent (and can also be seen on the Flag of Kent). The three Cornish choughs, originally belonging to the arms of Thomas Becket, were taken from the arms of the City of Canterbury. The Crest depicts the West Gate of Canterbury with a symbolic flow of water, presumably the Great Stour, below it. Two golden Bishops&#x27; Crosiers in the shape of a St. Andrews Cross are shown in front of it. The supporters – lions with the sterns of golden ships – are taken from the arms of the Cinque Ports.

The coat of arms is now formally used only for degree certificates, degree programmes and some merchandise, as a result of the university seeking a consistent identity branding.

== Academic profile ==

=== Research ===
Kent is a research-led university with 24 schools and 40 specialist research centres spanning the sciences, technology, medical studies, the social sciences, arts and humanities. In the 2021 Research Excellence Framework (REF), which assesses the quality of research in UK higher education institutions, Kent is ranked 38th by GPA and 32nd for research power (the grade point average score of a university, multiplied by the full-time equivalent number of researchers submitted). In the 2014 REF, the University of Kent was ranked 40th out of 128 participating institutions in a &#x27;grade point average&#x27; league table in &quot;The Times Higher Education Supplement&quot; (falling from 31st in 2008), 30th in terms of &#x27;Research Power&#x27; (rising from 40th in 2008), and 19th in terms of &#x27;Research Intensity&#x27; (rising from 49th in 2008). The university had a total research income of £17.7 million in the 2021-22 academic year.

=== Rankings ===

For 2020, &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper ranked Kent 65th in the UK, while &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; Good University Guide 2018 put Kent in 25th place, as did &quot;The Independent&#x27;s&quot; Complete University Guide. QS placed Kent 46th in the UK and 366th in the world, while Times Higher Education placed it 44th in the UK and in the 301–350 group worldwide. In &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; 10-year (1998–2007) average ranking of British universities based on consistent league table performance, Kent was ranked 48th overall in the UK. In 2015, Kent ranked ahead of 10 Russell Group universities according to the ranking of The Complete University Guide. In research, both &quot;The Guardian&quot; and &quot;The Times&quot; newspapers ranked Kent 29th, with The Independent rating the university 28th for its overall research activity in 2014.

The National Student Survey in 2017 placed Kent joint 20th in the UK, with an overall satisfaction of 90%.

In the Times Higher Education&#x27;s assessment of the 2021 Research Excellence Framework, the History department at Kent was ranked first in the country.

=== Library ===

The Templeman Library (named after Geoffrey Templeman, the university&#x27;s first Vice-Chancellor) contains over a million items in stock including books, journals, videos, DVDs, and archive materials (for example, a full text of &quot;The Times&quot; from 1785 onwards), yet it is still only half its planned size. It has a materials fund of approximately £1million a year, and adds 12,000 items every year. It is open every day in term time, on a 24/7 basis. It receives 800,000 visits a year, with approximately half a million loans &quot;per annum&quot;.

The library also houses the British Cartoon Archive, (established 1975) a national collection of political and social cartoons, with over 90,000 images catalogued and an extensive collection of related books.

In 2013 work began to extend, refurbish and completely modernise the Templeman Library, including the addition of study space, along with the creation of a new purpose-built lecture theatre. Additionally, the Library facade underwent major renovation. This work was completed in 2017, with additional refurbishment work planned for 2018.

=== Franco-British programme ===
The bilingual Franco-British double-degree programme combines subjects in one degree and is taught in two countries. The first year is spent at the Institut d&#x27;études politiques de Lille (IEP), the second and third years at the University of Kent, the fourth year at the IEP of Lille and the fifth is spent in Canterbury, Brussels or Lille.

The students of the Franco-British double-degree programme receive, at the end of the fourth year, the Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree from the University of Kent, the Diplôme by the IEP of Lille and, at the end of the fifth year, either the Master of Arts (MA) degree in Canterbury or in Brussels or the Master delivered by the IEP of Lille, chosen between &quot;14 parcours de formation&quot; by the IEP of Lille.

== Student life ==
===Admissions and enrolment===
The student population is mixed, with around 15,000 undergraduates and 4,000 postgraduates, with approximately 22% of students coming from overseas. Approximately 128 different nationalities are currently represented, and the female to male ratio is 55 women to every 45 men.

New students entering the university in 2021 had an average of 127 points (the equivalent of BBB-ABB at A Level). According to the 2023 &quot;Times&quot; and &quot;Sunday Times&quot; Good University Guide, approximately 4% of Kent&#x27;s undergraduates come from independent schools.

=== Students&#x27; Union ===
The Students&#x27; Union, officially known as &quot;Kent Union&quot;, is the student representative body for students at the university. It is led by five elected full-time officers (the &#x27;sabbatical team&#x27;), a Board of trustees, part-time student officers and &#x27;lay&#x27; members of the local community and business selected for their specialist expertise.

The university has two Co-Op shops, one in the main campus area, and the other in Park Wood student village. The two all-purpose food and essentials stores were previously known &quot;Essentials&quot; and &quot;Parkwood Essentials&quot;. The Union also operates the Park Wood bar &quot;Woody&#x27;s&quot; and a 1,500 capacity nightclub &quot;The Venue&quot; which, unusually, is located on the central campus. Essentials, the Venue and other shops and Union offices are located in purpose-made buildings completed in 1998. Kent Union also co-ordinates over 200 sports clubs and societies, as well as media outlets, volunteering and charity activities, and provides student welfare services.

The Students&#x27; Union has hosted concerts by bands including Led Zeppelin and The Who.

==== Demonstrations ====

In early March 1970 a General Meeting of the University of Kent at Canterbury Students&#x27; Union voted to occupy the Cornwallis Building as part of a national student movement to open personal records to individual student scrutiny. The occupation lasted about two weeks, with a majority vote ending the occupation on 18 March. Approximately 400 students marched out of the Cornwallis Building to present a set of demands that were handed by Union President David Lawrence to the University Registrar Mr Eric Fox. The demands had been drawn up and debated by groups of up to 300 students at a time in meetings and seminars held throughout the occupation.

In the early to mid-1970s, along with other plate-glass universities, the Union had a reputation for revolutionary politics, leading to demands for law changes from some staff trade unionists. It was active in anti-poll tax, anti-student loans and anti-racism campaigns as well as safety campaigns on campus in the late 1980s.

In 2003, ahead of the &#x27;Top Up Fees&#x27; vote, the Union took 300 students to take part in the NUS UK Student Demonstrations on three double decker buses. The Union covered all the transport costs to the demonstration. In 2010, ahead of a parliamentary vote on issues concerning raising tuition fees, the Union took part in the national demonstrations. The union heavily subsidised the transport for 500 students to get to London.

=== Chaplaincy ===

Whilst the university is secular, there is a chaplaincy consisting of permanent Anglican and Catholic priests and a Pentecostal minister, as well as part-time chaplains from other denominations and faiths. The chaplaincy runs the annual Carol Service that takes place every year in Canterbury Cathedral at the end of Autumn Term.

=== Student housing ===
In addition to the student housing in the colleges, the university also has the following student housing:
* Darwin Houses, a set of 26 student houses next to Darwin College, opened in 1989
* Becket Court, next to Eliot College, opened in 1990
* Tyler Court, three blocks of halls of residence. Block A was opened in 1995 mostly for postgraduates; Blocks B and C were completed in 2004 for undergraduates.
* Parkwood, a mini student village comprising 262 two-storey houses and a recently built apartment complex, about 10 minutes walk from the main campus. The initial houses were opened in 1980. A large addition to the Parkwood area was completed in 2005, comprising a number of en-suite fitted rooms grouped into four, five and six bedroom flats.
* Turing College was officially opened in September 2015; 9 buildings of 3 to 4 floors each.

=== Student media ===

==== CSR 97.4FM ====

University of Kent and Canterbury Christ Church University, as well as their associated Students&#x27; Unions, fund Canterbury&#x27;s only student and community radio station: CSR 97.4FM. The radio station broadcasts from studios at both universities 24 hours a day, with live broadcasting from 7am – 12am. CSR 97.4FM replaced UKC Radio, the original student-run radio station at the university.

==== InQuire ====
The university has a student newspaper named InQuire and an online news website InQuire Media (launched in January 2008). The newspaper is published every month and is made in its entirety by a group of student volunteers. Content is edited by volunteers and is focused on campus issues and news that affects students. Funded by Kent Union, the newspaper is subject to moderation before publication.

==== Kent Television ====

Kent Television (KTV), founded in 2012, is the volunteer-run television studio at the university.

== Notable alumni ==
Alumni of the University of Kent include several academics (particularly at British universities), two recipients of the Nobel Prize in Literature, a recipient of the Victoria Cross and relations of the extended British royal family.

<text>East Grinstead () is a town in West Sussex, England, near the East Sussex, Surrey, and Kent borders, south of London, northeast of Brighton, and northeast of the county town of Chichester. Situated in the northeast of the county, the civil parish has an area of . The population at the 2011 Census was 26,383.

Nearby towns include Crawley and Horley to the west, Tunbridge Wells to the east and Redhill and Reigate to the northwest. The town is contiguous with the village of Felbridge to the northwest. Until 1974 East Grinstead was in East Sussex, before joining with Haywards Heath and Burgess Hill as the Mid-Sussex district of West Sussex.

The town is on the Greenwich Meridian. It has many historic buildings, and the Weald and Ashdown Forest lie to the south-east.

==Places of interest==

The High Street contains one of the longest continuous runs of 14th-century timber-framed buildings in England. Other notable buildings in the town include Sackville College, the sandstone almshouse, built in 1609. In 1853 the warden of Sackville College, John Mason Neale, wrote the Christmas carol &quot;Good King Wenceslas&quot;. The college has sweeping views towards Ashdown Forest. The adjacent St Swithun&#x27;s Church stands on the highest ground in the town and was rebuilt in the eighteenth century (the tower dating from 1789) to a perpendicular design by James Wyatt. The imposing structure dominates the surrounding countryside for many miles around. In the churchyard are commemorated the East Grinstead Martyrs, and in the south-east corner is the grave of John Mason Neale.

The Greenwich Meridian runs through the grounds of the historic 1769 East Court mansion, home of the Town Council, giving the visitor an opportunity to stand with a foot in both the east and west. The mansion stands in a parkland setting. In 1968, the East Grinstead Society was founded as an independent body, both to protect the historically important buildings of East Grinstead (and its environs) and to improve the amenities for future generations.

 east of the town, in Hammerwood, is Hammerwood Park, a country house built by Benjamin Henry Latrobe in 1792, and once owned by the rock band Led Zeppelin. On the outskirts of the town is Standen, a country house belonging to the National Trust, containing one of the best collections of Arts and Crafts movement furnishings and fabrics. Kidbrooke Park (today Michael Hall School), a home of the Hambro family, was restored by the noted Sussex architect and antiquarian, Walter Godfrey, as was Plawhatch Hall. East Grinstead House is the headquarters of the (UK and Ireland) Caravan Club.

During the Second World War, the Queen Victoria Hospital developed a specialist burns unit led by Sir Archibald McIndoe. It became world-famous for pioneering treatment of RAF and allied aircrew who were badly burned or crushed, and required reconstructive plastic surgery. In 1941 patients of McIndoe who had undergone experimental reconstructive plastic surgery formed the Guinea Pig Club, which then became a support network for the aircrew and their family members. The club remained active after the end of the war, and its annual reunion meetings at East Grinstead continued until 2007, when the club was wound down in view of the increasing frailty of its surviving members. As such, the townspeople became very supportive of the patients at the Queen Victoria Hospital. Even though many of the victims were horribly disfigured (often missing limbs, and in the worst cases faces, their faces made up of burn tissue), the townspeople would go out of their way to make the men feel normal. Families invited the men to dinner, and girls asked them to go on dates. Patients of the burn units remember, and cherish, the charity received from the townspeople of East Grinstead.

During the same War, the town became a secondary target for German bombers which failed to make their primary target elsewhere. On the afternoon of Friday 9 July 1943, a Luftwaffe bomber became separated from its squadron, followed the main railway line and circled the town twice, then dropped eight bombs. Two bombs, one with a delayed-action fuse, fell on the Whitehall Theatre, a cinema on the London Road, where 184 people at the matinée show were watching a Hopalong Cassidy film before the main feature. A total of 108 people were killed in the raid, including children in the cinema, many of whom were evacuees; and some twenty Canadian servicemen stationed locally, who were either in the cinema when it was hit, or arrived minutes later to help with rescuing survivors. A further 235 were injured. This was the largest loss of life of any single air raid in Sussex.

In the winter of 2010, Claque Theatre produced the East Grinstead Community Play, which focussed on the bombing of the town in 1943, the work of Archibald McIndoe and his team at the hospital, and the Guinea Pig Club and its members. It was performed by local residents. On 9 June 2014 The Princess Royal unveiled a monument to Sir Archibald McIndoe and the Guinea Pigs. It stands in front of Sackville College at the east end of the High Street. It was funded by a public appeal and sculpted by Martin Jennings, whose own father was a Guinea Pig. It depicts a burned airman looking to the sky, with McIndoe placing reassuring hands on his shoulders. The stone ring around the statue is for visitors to sit and reflect and in doing so become part of the story representing &quot;The town that did not stare&quot;.

In 2006, the East Grinstead Town Museum was moved to new custom-built premises in the historic centre of the town, and successfully re-opened to the public as the East Grinstead Museum. Chequer Mead Theatre includes a modern 320-seat purpose-built auditorium, which stages professional and amateur plays/musicals and music (local rock groups to chamber music orchestras), opera, ballet, folk music, tribute bands, film, event cinema and talks. The venue also has a popular spacious cafe with outdoor seating.

In addition to the nearby Ashdown Forest, East Grinstead is served by the Forest Way and Worth Way linear Country Parks which follow the disused railway line from Three Bridges all the way through to Groombridge and which are part of the Sustrans national cycle network.

==Places of worship==
East Grinstead has an unusually diverse range of religious and spiritual organisations for a town of its size.

A broad range of mainstream Christian denominations have places of worship in the town. Protestant Nonconformism has featured especially prominently for the last two centuries, in common with other parts of northern Sussex. Several other religious groups have connections with the town, from merely owning property to having national headquarters there.

=== Church of England ===
The Church of England has four places of worship in the town. St Swithun&#x27;s Church was founded in the 11th century. Architect James Wyatt rebuilt it in local stone in 1789 after it became derelict and collapsed. Near the entrance to the church, three stones mark the supposed ashes of Anne Tree, Thomas Dunngate and John Forman who were burned as martyrs on 18 July 1556 because they would not renounce the Protestant faith. John Foxe wrote about them in his 1,800-page &quot;Foxe&#x27;s Book of Martyrs&quot;. Two other churches are in St Swithun&#x27;s parish.

St Luke&#x27;s Church, in Holtye Avenue on the Stone Quarry estate, was built in 1954 to serve the northeast of the town. The church was demolished around 2014 and flats have been built at the location. St Barnabas&#x27; Church in Dunnings Road serves the south of the town. The present wooden structure of 1975 replaced an older church built in 1912. The fourth church, in the northwest of the town, is dedicated to St Mary the Virgin. Built by W.T. Lowdell over a 21-year period beginning in 1891, the Decorated Gothic Revival church was consecrated in 1905 and has its own parish. It was established by adherents of the Oxford Movement, and services still follow a more Anglo-Catholic style than East Grinstead&#x27;s other Anglican churches.

=== Non-Conformist ===
East Grinstead&#x27;s first Nonconformist church was the Zion Chapel, built in 1810 for the Countess of Huntingdon&#x27;s Connexion. The small evangelical Calvinistic group owned the church until 1980; it is now used by Baptists and is called West Street Baptist Church. Trinity Methodist Church is the much-expanded successor to older places of Methodist worship in the town; the community dates back to 1868. The United Reformed Church community meets in the Moat Church, a former Congregational chapel built in the Early English Gothic Revival style in 1870.

A 2007 book also noted the New Life Church—a Newfrontiers evangelical charismatic church—the Kingdom Faith Church, another independent charismatic congregation, and the Full Gospel Church.

=== Other places of worship ===
Roman Catholics worship at the Church of Our Lady and St Peter, founded in 1898 by Edward Blount of the Blount baronetcy, a resident of nearby Worth. Opus Dei has a conference centre at Wickenden Manor near the town, and Rosicrucians also have a presence in nearby Greenwood Gate.

Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses worship at a modern Kingdom Hall. The community, established in 1967, previously used a former Salvation Army building.

The meetinghouse of the LDS Church on Ship Street was built in 1985. The London England Temple of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, is just over the Surrey border at Newchapel.

The United Kingdom (and former world) headquarters of the Church of Scientology is at Saint Hill Manor on the southwestern edge of East Grinstead. Scientology&#x27;s founder L. Ron Hubbard bought the Georgian mansion and its of grounds from the Maharaja of Jaipur in 1959 and lived in the town until 1967.

==Proposed redevelopment==

The East Grinstead Town Centre Master Plan was adopted on 10 July 2006 as a Supplementary Planning Document (SPD). The scheme proposed regeneration of the town centre in association with Thornfield Properties PLC. Thornfield Properties had submitted plans to the council for the start of an ambitious development of the Queens Walk and West Street area. It was expected that other redevelopment companies would fulfil targets outlined in the SPD over the next 20 years.

==Transport==
===Air===
Gatwick Airport is from the town, whilst Redhill Aerodrome and Biggin Hill Airport are both within half an hour&#x27;s drive. Hammerwood Park has a helicopter landing site for visiting pilots ( from the town).

===Rail===
East Grinstead station became a railway terminus in 1967, after the line from Three Bridges to Royal Tunbridge Wells was closed under the Beeching cuts, a rationalisation of British Railways&#x27; branch lines based on a report by Dr Richard Beeching, a resident of the town at that time. The line to Lewes, part of the Bluebell Railway, closed in 1958.

In the late 1970s, the town&#x27;s inner relief road was built along a section of one of the closed railway lines and is officially named &quot;Beeching Way&quot;. It has been nicknamed &quot;Beeching Cut&quot; as it runs through a cutting and was once one of the lines that Beeching cut. Much of rest of the trackbed of the disused Three Bridges to Groombridge line now forms the route of the Worth Way and Forest Way, linear Country Parks allowing access to the Wealden countryside.
A part of the Lewes line was re-constructed by the Bluebell Railway, a nearby preserved standard-gauge railway. The extension work was carried out in stages. The first paid-passenger service departed from East Grinstead station at 9:45 on Saturday 23 March 2013, and the first train left Sheffield Park for East Grinstead at 9:30 a.m. with services running each way every 45 minutes thereafter.

===Road===
The town lies on the junction of the A22 and A264 roads. For just over , from just to the north of the Town Centre to Felbridge village in Surrey, the two routes use the same stretch of single carriageway road. This is one of the principal causes of traffic congestion in the town.

The town is within commuting distance of London (about ) and Crawley/Gatwick (about ) by road. According to the 2001 Census, one in eight residents commuted to Crawley and Gatwick Airport for work with over 98% travelling by car.

==Education==
Education in the town is provided through both state and independent schools. West Sussex County Council provides seven primary schools along with two secondary schools. All these schools are co-educational and comprehensive. Private secondary education is provided by several day and boarding schools in the surrounding areas straddling Kent and Sussex.

===State secondary schools===
* Imberhorne School
* Sackville School

===Preparatory schools===
* Brambletye School
* Ashdown House

==Health care==

Queen Victoria Hospital was founded as a cottage hospital in 1863, and was rebuilt on its current site in the 1930s. Queen Victoria Hospital has been known for its burns treatment facilities and expertise.

==Twin towns==

East Grinstead is twinned with:
* Bourg-de-Péage, France
* Sant Feliu de Guíxols, Spain
* Mindelheim, Germany
* Schwaz, Austria
* Verbania, Italy

==Sports and social clubs==

The King&#x27;s Centre leisure centre, currently owned and operated by Mid Sussex District Council is on this land. The centre includes an indoor swimming pool and other facilities such as a gym and sports hall.

==In popular culture==

===Presence of minority religions===

In 1994, a documentary, &quot;Why East Grinstead?&quot;, was produced for Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Witness&quot; strand of documentaries. It sought to examine and explain the convergence of such a wide variety of religious organisations in the East Grinstead area. The documentary, produced by Zed Productions and directed by Ian Sellar, reached no definite conclusion: explanations ranged from the local presence of ley lines to the more prosaic idea that religious leaders had settled there because they liked the views.

In 2016 &quot;The Guardian&quot; called East Grinstead &quot;Britain&#x27;s strangest town&quot;, citing the presence of The Church of Scientology, the Ancient and Mystical Order Rosæ Crucis, the ultra-Catholic order of Opus Dei, Christian Scientists, Ashworth Dowsers and the Pagan Federation.

In 2017 &quot;The Economist&quot; published an article titled &quot;The Joy of Sects&quot; asking why Scientologists, Mormons, Opus Dei and others have settled around East Grinstead. It reported views that included ley lines, proximity to London, and to the experience of the Second World War when &quot;Archibald McIndoe, a plastic surgeon, treated desperately disfigured servicemen at the local Queen Victoria Hospital. East Grinstead was dubbed &#x27;the town that did not stare&#x27;, for its warmth and openness towards the outsiders.&quot;

===In literature===

East Grinstead is the destination of the adulterous lovers Norman and Annie in Alan Ayckbourn&#x27;s trilogy of plays entitled &quot;The Norman Conquests&quot;. It was chosen because Norman, after some effort, couldn&#x27;t get in at Hastings. In the 1977 Thames Television version of the trilogy, Norman and Annie were portrayed by Tom Conti and Penelope Wilton.

East Grinstead also features in Christopher Fowler&#x27;s novel, &quot;Psychoville&quot; (1995), in which the town features as harbouring the fictional Invicta Cross, as well as the eventual New Invicta. The town of New Invicta was later used by Jo Amey in &quot;Heist&quot; as a safehouse.

===In music===

East Grinstead is the home of Harry Witherspoon, one of the lead characters in a musical comedy by Stephen Flaherty and Lynn Ahrens called &quot;Lucky Stiff&quot;.

East Grinstead is the home town of the pop band Right Said Fred.

<text>Methylphenidate, sold under the brand names Ritalin ( ) and Concerta ( ) among others, is a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant indicated in the pharmacotherapy of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and narcolepsy. It may be taken by mouth or applied to the skin, and different formulations have varying durations of effect. For ADHD, the effectiveness of methylphenidate is comparable to atomoxetine but modestly lower than amphetamines, alleviating the executive functioning deficits of sustained attention, inhibition, working memory, reaction time and emotional self-regulation.
Common adverse reactions of methylphenidate include euphoria, dilated pupils, tachycardia, palpitations, headache, insomnia, anxiety, hyperhidrosis, weight loss, decreased appetite, dry mouth, nausea, and abdominal pain. Withdrawal symptoms may include chills, depression, drowsiness, dysphoria, exhaustion, headache, irritability, lethargy, nightmares, restlessness, suicidal thoughts, and weakness.
Methylphenidate is believed to work by blocking the reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine by neurons. It is a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant of the phenethylamine and piperidine classes. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 32nd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 17million prescriptions.

== Uses ==
Methylphenidate is most commonly used to treat ADHD and narcolepsy.

=== Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ===
Methylphenidate is used for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The dosage may vary and is titrated to effect, with some guidelines recommending initial treatment with a low dose. Methylphenidate is available in both immediate-release and modified-release formulations. Methylphenidate is not approved for children under six years of age.

The International Consensus Statement on ADHD shows that the results from systematic reviews, meta-analyses and large scale studies are clear: methylphenidate is safe and among the most efficacious drugs in all of psychiatry; treatment in the long-term substantially reduces accidental injuries, traumatic brain injury, substance abuse, cigarette smoking, educational underachievement, bone fractures, sexually transmitted infections, depression, suicide, criminal activity, teenage pregnancy, vehicle crashes, burn injuries and overall-cause mortality, and eliminates the increased risk for obesity.

One committee from the World Health Organization (WHO) responsible for the World Health Organization Essential Medicines List rejected an application in 2019, and a second application endorsed by 51 professional medical groups in 2021, for methylphenidate&#x27;s inclusion due to uncertainty about its efficacy and safety. However, in November 2023, the WHO Mental Health Gap Action Programme Guidelines for mental, neurological, and substance use disorders recommended that methylphenidate should be considered for children aged 6 years and older who have ADHD, noting specifically that, &quot;methylphenidate treatment shows substantial effects on symptom reduction&quot;, in addition to other WHO publications. In 2024, the European Society for Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (ESCAP) and the American Academy of Paediatrics (AAP) endorsed the inclusion of methylphenidate in the WHO EML.

Safety and efficacy data have been reviewed extensively by medical regulators (e.g., the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency), the developers of evidence-based national guidelines (e.g., the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence and the American Academy of Pediatrics), and government agencies who have endorsed these guidelines (e.g., the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council). These professional groups unanimously conclude, based on the scientific evidence, that methylphenidate is safe and effective and should be considered as a first-line treatment for ADHD.

Since ADHD diagnosis has increased around the world, methylphenidate may be misused as a &quot;study drug&quot; by some populations, which may be harmful. This also applies to people who may be experiencing a different issue and are misdiagnosed with ADHD. People in this category are prone to experience the negative side-effects of the drug, which can worsen their condition.

Long-term meta-analyses and systematic reviews show that the medications used to treat ADHD are not associated with observed deficits in brain structure, but with improved brain development and functioning, most prominently in inferior frontal and striatal regions. The most comprehensive meta-analysis available (19 studies with over 3.9 million participants) found &quot;no statistically significant association between ADHD medications [including methylphenidate] and the risk of cardiovascular event among children and adolescents, young and middle-aged adults, or older adults&quot;; as do other systematic reviews and meta-analyses.

=== Narcolepsy ===
Narcolepsy, a chronic sleep disorder characterized by overwhelming daytime drowsiness and uncontrollable sleep, is treated primarily with stimulants. Methylphenidate is considered effective in increasing wakefulness, vigilance, and performance. Methylphenidate improves measures of somnolence on standardized tests, such as the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT), but performance does not improve to levels comparable to healthy people.

=== Other medical uses ===
Methylphenidate may also be prescribed for off-label use in treatment-resistant cases of bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder. It can also improve depression in several groups, including stroke, cancer, and HIV-positive patients. There is weak evidence in favor of methylphenidate&#x27;s effectiveness for depression, including providing additional benefit in combination with antidepressants. In individuals with terminal cancer, methylphenidate can be used to counteract opioid-induced somnolence, to increase the analgesic effects of opioids, to treat depression, and to improve cognitive function. A 2021 systematic review and meta-analysis found that all studies on geriatric depression reported positive results of methylphenidate use; the review recommended short-term use in combination with citalopram. A 2018 review found low-quality evidence supporting its use to treat apathy as seen in Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, in addition to slight benefits for cognition and cognitive performance.

===Enhancing performance===

Methylphenidate&#x27;s efficacy as an athletic performance enhancer, cognitive enhancer, aphrodisiac, and euphoriant is supported by research. However, the manner in which methylphenidate is used for these purposes (high dosages, alternate routes of administration, during sleep deprivation, etc.) can result in severe unintended side effects.
A 2015 review found that therapeutic doses of amphetamine and methylphenidate result in modest improvements in cognition, including working memory, episodic memory, and inhibitory control, in normal healthy adults;
the cognition-enhancing effects of these drugs are known to occur through the indirect activation of both dopamine receptor D1 and adrenoceptor α2 in the prefrontal cortex. Methylphenidate and other ADHD stimulants also improve task saliency and increase arousal. Stimulants such as amphetamine and methylphenidate can improve performance on difficult and boring tasks, and are used by some students as a study and test-taking aid. Based upon studies of self-reported illicit stimulant use, performance-enhancing use rather than use as a recreational drug, is the primary reason that students use stimulants.

Excessive doses of methylphenidate, above the therapeutic range, can interfere with working memory and cognitive control. Like amphetamine and bupropion, methylphenidate increases stamina and endurance in humans primarily through reuptake inhibition of dopamine in the central nervous system. Similar to the loss of cognitive enhancement when using large amounts, large doses of methylphenidate can induce side effects that impair athletic performance, such as rhabdomyolysis and hyperthermia. While literature suggests it might improve cognition, most authors agree that using the drug as a study aid when an ADHD diagnosis is not present does not actually improve GPA. Moreover, it has been suggested that students who use the drug for studying may be self-medicating for potentially deeper underlying issues.

== Contraindications ==
Methylphenidate is contraindicated for individuals with agitation, tics, glaucoma, heart defects or a hypersensitivity to any ingredients contained in methylphenidate pharmaceuticals.

Pregnant women are advised to only use the medication if the benefits outweigh the potential risks. Not enough human studies have been conducted to conclusively demonstrate an effect of methylphenidate on fetal development. In 2018, a review concluded that it has not been teratogenic in rats and rabbits, and that it &quot;is not a major human teratogen&quot;.

== Adverse effects ==

The most common side effects associated with methylphenidate (in standard and extended-release formulations) are appetite loss, dry mouth, anxiety/nervousness, nausea, and insomnia. Gastrointestinal adverse effects may include abdominal pain and weight loss. Nervous system adverse effects may include akathisia (agitation/restlessness), irritability, dyskinesia (tics), lethargy (drowsiness/fatigue), and dizziness. Cardiac adverse effects may include palpitations, changes in blood pressure, and heart rate (typically mild), and tachycardia (rapid heart rate). Ophthalmologic adverse effects may include blurred vision caused by pupil dilatation and dry eyes, with less frequent reports of diplopia and mydriasis. In some cases, tolerance might be an issue with stimulants like methylphenidate.

Results from a 2024 systematic review showed that methylphenidate significantly improves ADHD symptoms and broadband measures but can cause appetite suppression and other adverse events in children and adolescents. Smokers with ADHD who take methylphenidate may increase their nicotine dependence, and smoke more often than before they began using methylphenidate, with increased nicotine cravings and an average increase of 1.3 cigarettes per day.

There is some evidence of mild reductions in height with prolonged treatment in children. This has been estimated at or less per year during the first three years with a total decrease of over 10 years.

Hypersensitivity (including skin rash, urticaria, and fever) is sometimes reported when using transdermal methylphenidate. The Daytrana patch has a much higher rate of skin reactions than oral methylphenidate.

Methylphenidate can worsen psychosis in people who are psychotic, and in very rare cases it has been associated with the emergence of new psychotic symptoms. It should be used with extreme caution in people with bipolar disorder due to the potential induction of mania or hypomania. There have been very rare reports of suicidal ideation, but some authors claim that evidence does not support a link. Logorrhea is occasionally reported and visual hallucinations are very rarely reported. Priapism is a very rare adverse event that can be potentially serious.

U.S. Food and Drug Administration-commissioned studies in 2011 indicate that in children, young adults, and adults, there is no association between serious adverse cardiovascular events (sudden death, heart attack, and stroke) and the medical use of methylphenidate or other ADHD stimulants.

Because some adverse effects may only emerge during chronic use of methylphenidate, a constant watch for adverse effects is recommended.

A 2018 Cochrane review found that methylphenidate might be associated with serious side effects such as heart problems, psychosis, and death. The certainty of the evidence was stated as very low.

The same review found tentative evidence that it may cause both serious and non-serious adverse effects in children.

=== Overdose ===
The symptoms of a moderate acute overdose of methylphenidate primarily arise from central nervous system overstimulation; these symptoms include: vomiting, nausea, agitation, tremors, hyperreflexia, muscle twitching, euphoria, confusion, hallucinations, delirium, hyperthermia, sweating, flushing, headache, tachycardia, heart palpitations, cardiac arrhythmias, hypertension, mydriasis, and dryness of mucous membranes. A severe overdose may involve symptoms such as hyperpyrexia, sympathomimetic toxidrome, convulsions, paranoia, stereotypy (a repetitive movement disorder), rhabdomyolysis, coma, and circulatory collapse.
A methylphenidate overdose is rarely fatal with appropriate care. Following injection of methylphenidate tablets into an artery, severe toxic reactions involving abscess formation and necrosis have been reported.

Treatment of a methylphenidate overdose typically involves the administration of benzodiazepines, with antipsychotics, α-adrenoceptor agonists and propofol serving as second-line therapies.

===Addiction and dependence===
Methylphenidate is a stimulant with an addiction liability and dependence liability similar to amphetamine. It has moderate liability among addictive drugs; accordingly, addiction and psychological dependence are possible and likely when methylphenidate is used as a recreational drug. When used above the medical dose range, stimulants are associated with the development of stimulant psychosis.

==== Biomolecular mechanisms ====

Methylphenidate has the potential to induce euphoria due to its pharmacodynamic effect (i.e., dopamine reuptake inhibition) in the brain&#x27;s reward system. At therapeutic doses, ADHD stimulants do not sufficiently activate the reward system; consequently, when taken as directed in doses that are commonly prescribed for the treatment of ADHD, methylphenidate use lacks the capacity to cause an addiction.

== Interactions ==
Methylphenidate may inhibit the metabolism of vitamin K anticoagulants, certain anticonvulsants, and some antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors). Concomitant administration may require dose adjustments, possibly assisted by monitoring of plasma drug concentrations. There are several case reports of methylphenidate inducing serotonin syndrome with concomitant administration of antidepressants.

When methylphenidate is coingested with ethanol, a metabolite called ethylphenidate is formed via hepatic transesterification, not unlike the hepatic formation of cocaethylene from cocaine and ethanol. The reduced potency of ethylphenidate and its minor formation means it does not contribute to the pharmacological profile at therapeutic doses, and even in overdose cases, ethylphenidate concentrations remain negligible.

Coingestion of alcohol also increases the blood plasma levels of d-methylphenidate by up to 40%.

Liver toxicity from methylphenidate is extremely rare, but limited evidence suggests that intake of β-adrenergic agonists with methylphenidate may increase the risk of liver toxicity.

== Pharmacology ==

=== Pharmacodynamics ===
Methylphenidate acts primarily as a norepinephrine–dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI). It is a benzylpiperidine and phenethylamine derivative which also shares part of its basic structure with catecholamines.

Methylphenidate is a psychostimulant and increases the activity of the central nervous system through inhibition on reuptake of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and dopamine. As models of ADHD suggest, it is associated with functional impairments in some of the brain&#x27;s neurotransmitter systems, particularly those involving dopamine in the mesocortical and mesolimbic pathways and norepinephrine in the prefrontal cortex and locus coeruleus. Psychostimulants like methylphenidate and amphetamine may be effective in treating ADHD because they increase neurotransmitter activity in these systems. When reuptake of those neurotransmitters is halted, its concentration and effects in the synapse increase and last longer, respectively. Therefore, methylphenidate is called a norepinephrine–dopamine reuptake inhibitor. By increasing the effects of norepinephrine and dopamine, methylphenidate increases the activity of the central nervous system and produces effects such as increased alertness, reduced fatigue, and improved attention.

Methylphenidate is most active at modulating levels of dopamine (DA) and to a lesser extent norepinephrine (NE). Methylphenidate binds to and blocks dopamine transporters (DAT) and norepinephrine transporters (NET). Variability exists between DAT blockade, and extracellular dopamine, leading to the hypothesis that methylphenidate amplifies basal dopamine activity, leading to nonresponse in those with low basal DA activity. In animals and brain tissue, methylphenidate has been shown to dose-dependently increase brain dopamine levels. On average, methylphenidate elicits a 3 to 4 times increase in dopamine and norepinephrine in the striatum and prefrontal cortex. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies suggest that long-term treatment with ADHD stimulants (specifically, amphetamine and methylphenidate) decreases abnormalities in brain structure and function found in subjects with ADHD.

Both amphetamine and methylphenidate are predominantly dopaminergic drugs, yet their mechanisms of action are distinct. Methylphenidate acts as a norepinephrine–dopamine reuptake inhibitor, while amphetamine is both a releasing agent and reuptake inhibitor of dopamine and norepinephrine. Methylphenidate&#x27;s mechanism of action in the release of dopamine and norepinephrine is fundamentally different from most other phenethylamine derivatives, as methylphenidate is thought to increase neuronal firing rate, whereas amphetamine reduces firing rate, but causes monoamine release by reversing the flow of the monoamines through monoamine transporters via a diverse set of mechanisms, including TAAR1 activation and modulation of VMAT2 function, among other mechanisms.

The difference in mechanism of action between methylphenidate and amphetamine results in methylphenidate inhibiting amphetamine&#x27;s effects on monoamine transporters when they are co-administered.

Methylphenidate has both dopamine transporter and norepinephrine transporter binding affinity, with the dextromethylphenidate enantiomers displaying a prominent affinity for the norepinephrine transporter. Both the dextrorotary and levorotary enantiomers displayed receptor affinity for the serotonergic 5HT1A and 5HT2B subtypes, though direct binding to the serotonin transporter was not observed. A later study confirmed the d-threo-methylphenidate (dexmethylphenidate) binding to the 5HT1A receptor, but no significant activity on the 5HT2B receptor was found.

There exist some paradoxical findings that oppose the notion that methylphenidate acts as silent antagonist of the DAT (DAT inhibitor). DAT occupancy of 80% is necessary for methylphenidate&#x27;s euphoriant effect, but re-administration of methylphenidate beyond this level of DAT occupancy has been found to produce similarly potent euphoriant effects (despite DAT occupancy being unchanged with repeated administration). By contrast, other DAT inhibitors such as bupropion have not been observed to exhibit this effect. These observations, among others, have prompted the hypothesis that methylphenidate may actually act as a &quot;DAT inverse agonist&quot; or &quot;negative allosteric modifier of the DAT&quot; by reversing the direction of the dopamine flux by the DAT at higher dosages rather than by acting as a simple competitive transporter blocker.

Methylphenidate may protect neurons from the neurotoxic effects of Parkinson&#x27;s disease and methamphetamine use disorder. The hypothesized mechanism of neuroprotection is through inhibition of methamphetamine–DAT interactions, and through reducing cytosolic dopamine, leading to decreased production of dopamine-related reactive oxygen species.

The dextrorotary enantiomers are significantly more potent than the levorotary enantiomers, and some medications therefore only contain dexmethylphenidate. The studied maximized daily dosage of OROS methylphenidate appears to be 144 mg/day.

=== Pharmacokinetics ===

Methylphenidate taken by mouth has a bioavailability of 11–52% with a duration of action around 2–4 hours for instant-release (i.e. Ritalin), 3–8 hours for sustained-release (i.e. Ritalin SR), and 8–12 hours for extended-release (i.e. Concerta). The half-life of methylphenidate is 2–3 hours, depending on the individual. The peak plasma time is achieved at about 2 hours. Methylphenidate has a low plasma protein binding of 10–33% and a volume of distribution of 2.65 L/kg.

Dextromethylphenidate is much more bioavailable than levomethylphenidate when administered orally, and is primarily responsible for the psychoactivity of racemic methylphenidate.

The oral bioavailability and speed of absorption for immediate-release methylphenidate is increased when administered with a meal. The effects of a high fat meal on the observed Cmax differ between some extended-release formulations, with combined IR/ER and OROS formulations showing reduced Cmax levels while liquid-based extended-release formulations showed increased Cmax levels when administered with a high-fat meal, according to some researchers. A 2003 study, however, showed no difference between a high-fat meal administration and a fasting administration of oral methylphenidate.

Methylphenidate is metabolized into ritalinic acid by CES1A1 enzymes in the liver. Dextromethylphenidate is selectively metabolized at a slower rate than levomethylphenidate. 97% of the metabolised drug is excreted in the urine, and between 1 and 3% is excreted in the faeces. A small amount, less than 1%, of the drug is excreted in the urine in its unchanged form.

== Chemistry ==
Despite the claim made by some urban legends, it is not a cocaine derivative nor analog, however, both compounds contain a methyl piperidinylcarboxylate moiety with 2-carbon distance between nitrogen and methanoate, methylphenidate containing methyl (piperidin-2-yl)-ethanoate and cocaine containing methyl (piperidin-3-yl)-methanoate. Cocaine is a local anesthetic and ligand channel blocker with SNDRI action, while methylphenidate is an NDRI with 2–3 fold selectivity for the dopamine transporter (DAT) over the norepinephrine transporter (NET). Cocaine is also more potent in serotonin transporters (SERTs) than NDRI sites.

Four isomers of methylphenidate are possible, since the molecule has two chiral centers. One pair of threo isomers and one pair of erythro are distinguished, from which primarily d-threo-methylphenidate exhibits the pharmacologically desired effects. The erythro diastereomers are &quot;pressor&quot; amines, a property not shared with the threo diastereomers. When the drug was first introduced it was sold as a 4:1 mixture of erythro:threo diastereomers, but it was later reformulated to contain only the threo diastereomers. &quot;TMP&quot; refers to a threo product that does not contain any erythro diastereomers, i.e. (±)-threo-methylphenidate. Since the threo isomers are energetically favored, it is easy to epimerize out any of the undesired erythro isomers. The drug that contains only dextrorotatory methylphenidate is sometimes called d-TMP, although this name is only rarely used and it is much more commonly referred to as dexmethylphenidate, d-MPH, or d-threo-methylphenidate. A review on the synthesis of enantiomerically pure (2&quot;R&quot;,2&quot;&#x27;R&quot;)-(+)-&quot;threo&quot;-methylphenidate hydrochloride has been published.


=== Detection in biological fluids ===

The concentration of methylphenidate or ritalinic acid, its major metabolite, may be quantified in plasma, serum, or whole blood to monitor compliance in those receiving the drug therapeutically, to confirm the diagnosis of potential poisoning victims or to assist in the forensic investigation in a case of fatal overdosage.

== History ==
Methylphenidate was first synthesized in 1944 and was approved for medical use in the United States in 1955. It was synthesized by chemist Leandro Panizzon and sold by Swiss company CIBA (now Novartis). He named the drug after his wife Marguerite, nicknamed Rita, who used Ritalin to compensate for low blood pressure. Methylphenidate was not reported to be a stimulant until 1954. The drug was introduced for medical use in the United States in 1957. Originally, it was marketed as a mixture of two racemates, 80% (±)-erythro and 20% (±)-threo, under the brand name Centedrin. Subsequent studies of the racemates showed that the central stimulant activity is associated with the threo racemate and were focused on the separation and interconversion of the erythro isomer into the more active threo isomer. The erythro isomer was eliminated, and now modern formulations of methyphenidate contain only the threo isomer in a 50:50 mixture of &quot;d&quot;- and &quot;l&quot;-isomers.

Methylphenidate was first used to allay barbiturate-induced coma, narcolepsy and depression. It was later used to treat memory deficits in the elderly. Beginning in the 1960s, it was used to treat children with ADHD based on earlier work, starting with the studies by American psychiatrist Charles Bradley on the use of psychostimulant drugs, such as Benzedrine, with then called &quot;maladjusted children&quot;. Production and prescription of methylphenidate rose significantly in the 1990s, especially in the United States, as the ADHD diagnosis came to be better understood and more generally accepted within the medical and mental health communities.

In 2000, Alza Corporation received US FDA approval to market Concerta, an modified-release form of methylphenidate that usesOsmotic-controlled release oral delivery system.

It was estimated that the number of doses of methylphenidate used globally in 2013 increased by 66% compared to 2012. In 2022, it was the 32nd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 17million prescriptions. It is available as a generic medication.

==Society and culture==
=== Names ===

Methylphenidate is sold in the majority of countries worldwide. Brand names for methylphenidate include Ritalin (in honor of Rita, the wife of the molecule discoverer Leandro Panizzon), Rilatine (in Belgium to avoid a conflict of commercial name with the RIT pharmaceutical company), Concerta, Medikinet, Adaphen, Addwize, Inspiral, Methmild, Artige, Attenta, Cognil, Konsenidat, Equasym, Foquest, Methylin, Penid, Phenida, Prohiper, and Tradea.

=== Available forms ===
The dextrorotary enantiomer of methylphenidate, known as dexmethylphenidate, is sold as a generic and under the brand names Focalin and Attenade in both an immediate-release and an extended-release form. There is some evidence that dexmethylphenidate has better bioavailability and a longer duration of action than methylphenidate.

==== Immediate-release ====

Methylphenidate was originally available as an immediate-release racemic mixture formulation under the Novartis brand name Ritalin, although a variety of generics are available, some under other brand names. Generic brand names include Ritalina, Rilatine, Attenta, Medikinet, Metadate, Methylin, Penid, Tranquilyn, and Rubifen.

==== Modified-release ====
Modified-release methylphenidate products include:
Concerta tablets are marked with the letters &quot;ALZA&quot; and followed by: &quot;18&quot;, &quot;27&quot;, &quot;36&quot;, or &quot;54&quot;, relating to the dosage strength in milligrams. They use osmotic-controlled release oral delivery system. Approximately 22% of the dose is immediate-release, and the remaining 78% of the dose is released over 10–12 hours post-ingestion, with an initial increase over the first 6–7 hours, and subsequent decline in the released drug.

Ritalin LA capsules are marked with the letters &quot;NVR&quot; (abbrev.: Novartis) and followed by: &quot;R20&quot;, &quot;R30&quot;, or &quot;R40&quot;, depending on the (mg) dosage strength. Ritalin LA provides two standard doses – half the total dose being released immediately and the other half released four hours later. In total, each capsule is effective for about eight hours.

Metadate CD capsules contain two types of beads: 30% are immediate-release, and the other 70% are evenly sustained release.

Medikinet Retard/CR/Adult/Modified Release tablets are an extended-release oral capsule form of methylphenidate. It delivers 50% of the dosage as IR MPH and the remaining 50% in 3–4 hours.

Jornay PM is a delayed release formulation that is taken at bedtime. An outer polymer coating delays the initial release of the drug until 8 hours after administration, after which an inner coating regulates the rate of drug absorption. Peak plasma concentration occurs 14 hours following administration. This formulation was motivated by the need for a pediatric ADHD medication that is active immediately after morning waking, as most long-acting formulations exhibit a delay between administration and absorption that leads to inadequate therapeutic effect in the early morning.

====Skin patch====
A methylphenidate skin patch is sold under the brand name Daytrana in the United States. It was developed and marketed by Noven Pharmaceuticals and approved in the US in 2006. It is also referred to as methylphenidate transdermal system (MTS). It is approved as a once-daily treatment in children with ADHD aged 6–17 years. It is mainly prescribed as a second-line treatment when oral forms are not well tolerated, or if people have difficulty with compliance. Noven&#x27;s original FDA submission indicated that it should be used for 12 hours. When the FDA rejected the submission, they requested evidence that a shorter time period was safe and effective; Noven provided such evidence, and it was approved for a 9-hour period.

Orally administered methylphenidate is subject to first-pass metabolism, by which the levo-isomer is extensively metabolized. By circumventing this first-pass metabolism, the relative concentrations of ℓ-threo-methylphenidate are much higher with transdermal administration (50–60% of those of dexmethylphenidate instead of about 14–27%).

A 39 nanograms/mL peak serum concentration of methylphenidate has been found to occur between 7.5–10.5 hours after administration. However, the onset to peak effect is 2 hours, and the clinical effects remain up to 2 hours after the patch has been removed. The absorption is increased when the transdermal patch is applied onto inflamed skin or skin that has been exposed to heat. The absorption lasts for approximately 9 hours after application (onto normal, unexposed to heat and uninflamed skin). 90% of the medication is excreted in the urine as metabolites and unchanged drug.

====Parenteral formulation====
When it was released in the United States, methylphenidate was available from CIBA in a parenteral form for use by medical professionals. It came in 10mL multiple-dose vials containing 100 mg methylphenidate HCl and 100 mg lactose in lyophilized (freeze-dried) form. It was also available as single-dose ampoules containing 20 mg methylphenidate HCl. Instructions were to reconstitute with 10mL sterile solvent (water). The indication was 10 to 20 mg (1.0mL from MDV&#x27;s, up to one full single-use ampoule) to produce a focused, talkative state that could help certain patients break down the resistance to therapy. Parenteral methylphenidate was discontinued out of a concern for the actual benefit and of inducing a psychic dependence. This is not truth serum in the normal sense, as it does not impair the ability to control the flow of information like a barbiturate agent (Pentothal) or similar might.

===Cost===
Brand-name and generic formulations are available.

===Legal status===
Internationally, methylphenidate is a Schedule II drug under the Convention on Psychotropic Substances.

In December 2024, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency adopted a positive opinion, recommending the granting of a pediatric use marketing authorization for the medicinal product Tuzulby, intended for the treatment of children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The applicant for this medicinal product is Neuraxpharm Pharmaceuticals S.L. Tuzulby is a hybrid medicine of Ritalin, which has been authorized in the EU since January 1997. Tuzulby contains the same active substance as Ritalin, but is available in a different formulation and strength, and is given once daily.

=== Controversy ===

Methylphenidate has been the subject of controversy in relation to its use in the treatment of ADHD. The prescription of psychostimulant medication to children to reduce ADHD symptoms has been a major point of criticism. The contention that methylphenidate acts as a gateway drug has been discredited by multiple sources, according to which abuse is statistically very low and &quot;stimulant therapy in childhood does not increase the risk for subsequent drug and alcohol abuse disorders later in life&quot;. A study found that ADHD medication was not associated with an increased risk of cigarette use, and in fact, stimulant treatments such as Ritalin seemed to lower this risk. People treated with stimulants such as methylphenidate during childhood were less likely to have substance use disorders in adulthood.

Among countries with the highest rates of use of methylphenidate medication is Iceland, where research shows that the drug was the most commonly used substance among people who inject drugs. The study involved 108 people who inject drugs and 88% of them had injected methylphenidate within the last 30 days and for 63% of them, methylphenidate was the most preferred substance.

Treatment of ADHD by way of methylphenidate has led to legal actions, including malpractice suits regarding informed consent, inadequate information on side effects, misdiagnosis, and coercive use of medications by school systems.

== Etymology ==
The word methylphenidate is a portmanteau of the chemical name, Methyl-2-phenyl-2-(piperidin-2-yl) acetate.

The name &quot;Ritalin&quot; derives from Marguerite &quot;Rita&quot; Panizzon, the wife of Leandro Panizzon, who first synthesized the drug in 1944. Rita was the first person to take methylphenidate and described its effects to her husband.

==Research==

===Apathy===
Methylphenidate may be effective as a treatment for apathy in Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and other conditions. It may also be useful in the treatment of more severe disorders of diminished motivation, like abulia and akinetic mutism.

=== Schizophrenia ===
Methylphenidate has been shown to reduce rates of hospitalization in patients with schizophrenia, although repeated, elevated doses can provoke psychosis.

===Addiction===
Methylphenidate has shown some benefits as a replacement therapy for individuals who are addicted to and dependent upon methamphetamine. Methylphenidate and amphetamine have been investigated as a chemical replacement for the treatment of cocaine addiction. Its effectiveness in treatment of cocaine or psychostimulant addiction or psychological dependence has not been proven.

===Social anxiety===
Methylphenidate has been reported to be effective in the treatment of social anxiety disorder in people who are comorbid for both this condition and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in small preliminary clinical studies and case reports.

<text>Jadzia Dax , played by Terry Farrell, is a fictional character from the science-fiction television series &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;.

Jadzia Dax is a joined Trill. Though she appears to be a young woman, Jadzia lives in symbiosis with a long-lived creature, known as a symbiont, named Dax; Jadzia is Dax&#x27;s eighth host. The two share a single, conscious mind, and her personality is a blending of the characteristics of both the host and the symbiont. As such, Jadzia has access to all the skills and memories of the symbiont&#x27;s seven previous hosts. Prior to the symbiotic joining, Jadzia earned academic degrees in exobiology, zoology, astrophysics, and exoarchaeology.

Jadzia Dax is the chief science officer of the space station Deep Space Nine and is close friends with station commander Benjamin Sisko. Later in the series, she becomes involved with the Klingon character Worf, and they marry during the sixth season of the show. In the sixth-season finale Jadzia dies but the Dax symbiote survives, and in the seventh-season premiere returns with a new host Ezri Dax, played by Nicole de Boer.

When selecting the characters for &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot;, the production staff knew that they would have humans, Bajorans, and a changeling; for other characters, they wanted to pick &quot;a species that had already been established&quot; on &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;. They decided on a Trill, as seen in the form of Odan in the &quot;TNG&quot; episode &quot;The Host&quot;.

Although Michael Westmore&#x27;s alterations to make the Odan headpiece more feminine was as good as all of his work, the writers simply did not like it. Apparently, after she had put on the Odan forehead appliance, Rick Berman looked at Terry Farrell and said to Westmore, &quot;What did you do to her head, she used to be beautiful?&quot; Instead of changing species, as they had already come to like the idea of an &quot;old man&quot;, a person with centuries of experience to guide Sisko, Westmore suggested, &quot;just give her spots like we gave Famke [Janssen]&quot;, who played a Kriosian in &quot;TNG&quot;: &quot;The Perfect Mate&quot;. This make-up was used on all Trill afterwards, comprising lines of dark spots that run from the temples and down both sides of the head, neck, and body.

===Characterization===
When the show began, the writers had difficulty defining the character of Dax. Michael Piller explained, &quot;Having a Trill seemed like a really, really good idea at the time, but it was the most difficult character for us to define. Jadzia Dax escaped us. At first we thought she was going to be ethereal, a Grace Kelly/Audrey Hepburn kind of goddess, and ultimately I think Ira Behr really figured it out, probably not until the second season, when he really made her a smart-talking, wise-cracking tough cookie.&quot; In 2014, Farrell admitted she found the character initially frustrating. &quot;The writers didn&#x27;t know what to do with the character they created&quot;, saying she was asked to portray the character as a cross between Grace Kelly and Yoda. She was also annoyed by a scene written where Dax gossiped about who was dating whom on the station, questioning &quot;Why would a 350-year-old person care about who you&#x27;re going out with?&quot; Piller explained, &quot;The more we&#x27;ve written her, the more we&#x27;re finding that she is not what she appears to be. That underneath this placid exterior, there&#x27;s all these various personalities that she&#x27;s gone through that are in turmoil and there&#x27;s a lot of inner conflict. You know all the voices we hear inside ourselves are all made up of different subpersonalities; well she&#x27;s got them all screaming at her in a variety of different ways.&quot;

Ira Behr spoke further on the character, announcing that they had intentionally changed the character early in the series. He said, &quot;We changed Dax in year two. Originally, she was going to be the Spock character, the wise old owl, the wise old man. And then we realized that she could be the one who&#x27;s ready to go out and kick anyone&#x27;s butt, and go out and have an adventure and have fun, and be kind of witty and mercurial. And that turned out to be great. When we found that part of the character, we just ran with it.&quot;

Speaking in 2002, Terry Farrell said of playing Dax, &quot;It was a character who had lived seven lifetimes, been a man and a woman. Before I walked in and actually met everybody, I felt a little bit intimidated about this, I thought &#x27;Oh my God, I need to meet them so they&#x27;re going to tell me what I need to know.&#x27; And when I actually got here and spoke to everyone, they kind of didn&#x27;t really know. And I was 28, and they kind of wanted me to be wiser than my years, just have the physicality of a 28-year-old, but have a 350-year-old wise person inside me. They tried to find what they wanted in adjusting me here and there, and I think really what happened was surrender to that it was all new for this Dax, Jadzia Dax, this experience of the seven lifetimes, and Michael Piller made the decision that she was trying to come to terms with all of these entities, all of these memories that were inside of herself. And I think that helped me a lot as an actress to try to assimilate the job, period, and in a lot of ways, made me feel a little lost and uncomfortable as Terry, which got played out as Jadzia, so it was okay that she slowly felt more comfortable, so did I, and by the time they decided to make me a little bit more roguish in the second or third season, I felt much more comfortable about the dialogue and the other actors, and my lack of stage experience. And when I had to start doing action sequences, and work with Michael Dorn, I felt a lot more comfortable. I had my own voice.&quot;

When asked how she would like Jadzia Dax to be remembered, Terry Farrell said, &quot;wisely mischievous.&quot;

===Rejected ideas===
Following the confirmation of Farrell&#x27;s departure and plans to kill the character off, Michael Piller wanted to add a few lines to &quot;Star Trek: Insurrection&quot; (which was still in development) acknowledging Jadzia&#x27;s death and the impact it had on Worf. Rick Berman eventually overruled this, arguing that this would confuse film audience members who did not follow the show regularly.

Early in the run of &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;, Michael McGreevey pitched a story to the writers that featured Jadzia and Bashir falling in love. McGreevey commented, &quot;It was a love story, a simple concept. I don&#x27;t know why they didn&#x27;t want to do it. The symbiont inside Dax becomes ill, making her ill, and Dr. Bashir must separate them in order to treat the symbiont. We would come to see the personality of Jadzia, which of course is different from Dax. Bashir falls in love with her, and she feels for him, too, but the most important thing in life is to be joined with the symbiont. Bashir realizes that the only way to save the symbiont is to put it back into Jadzia, and thereby lose the girl he loves&quot;.

==Joined nature==

Jadzia Dax is a joined Trill. &quot;Jadzia&quot; is the name of the young Trill woman, while &quot;Dax&quot; refers to a slug-like symbiont that resides in her abdomen; Jadzia&#x27;s actual family name was never revealed on the show. In the novels, her original name is said to be Jadzia Idaris. While Jadzia is 28 years old at the beginning of the series, the creature Dax is roughly 300 years old, having previously been hosted by seven other Trills. As a result, Dax may be considered the oldest crewmate on Deep Space Nine.

Prior to Jadzia, the Dax symbiont had been hosted by Lela, Tobin, Emony, Audrid, Torias, Joran, and Curzon.

The burden of seven lifetimes&#x27; worth of memories is not always a positive one; several episodes of &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; focus on Dax&#x27;s struggle with her dual nature:
* In the first-season episode &quot;Dax&quot;, the previous host Curzon Dax is accused of murder. This leads to an extradition hearing to determine whether Jadzia can be held responsible for crimes committed during another lifetime. While the moral question remains unanswered, the legal issue is resolved when evidence arises of Curzon&#x27;s innocence.
* In the second-season episode &quot;Invasive Procedures&quot;, an unjoined Trill named Verad attempts to steal the Dax symbiont. Verad is upset that his application for a joining has been rejected by the Trill Symbiosis Commission, and he plans to steal the Dax symbiont and escape into the Gamma quadrant. He manages to remove the Dax symbiont from Jadzia and partially join with it before his escape is thwarted.
* Later that season, Dax mentors a Trill initiate in the episode &quot;Playing God&quot;. Dax is responsible for training the young Trill, and for evaluating his suitability for joining. During the episode, Jadzia and Sisko discuss her own training under Curzon Dax, as well as the role that joining plays in Trill society.
* In the third-season episode &quot;Equilibrium&quot;, Dax begins to experience unsettling mental problems. She travels back to Trill to discover the source of the problems. While undergoing treatment, she visits a network of caverns in which unjoined Trill attendants care for symbionts that have not been implanted into hosts. She eventually learns that the Dax symbiont had been previously joined with Joran Belar, a psychologically unstable host candidate who later committed a murder. Her memories of Joran&#x27;s life and crime were suppressed, but her mental problems subside once she regains and confronts them.
* Later that season in the episode &quot;Facets&quot;, Jadzia encounters each of Dax&#x27;s previous hosts in the Trill &quot;rite of closure&quot;, including the insane Joran. This episode reveals much of the backstory for the Dax character, and explores the relationship between Jadzia Dax, Curzon Dax, and Benjamin Sisko.
* In the fourth-season episode &quot;Rejoined&quot;, Jadzia Dax encounters Lenara Kahn, the current host of the symbiont Kahn, who had been previously joined to Nilani Kahn, the wife of Torias Dax. Because Torias died suddenly, Dax&#x27;s relationship with Kahn through its previous host was never resolved, and the two current hosts struggle in the episode with their feelings towards one another. This is complicated by a taboo in Trill culture against romantic relationships with partners of previous hosts.

==Portrayal==
At the beginning of the series, Jadzia has just recently been joined with the symbiont Dax after the natural death of the previous host, Curzon Dax. Curzon had been a friend and mentor to station Commander Benjamin Sisko, and as Jadzia Dax, they continue this friendship despite the change in circumstances. Throughout the series, Sisko refers to Jadzia Dax by the affectionate nickname &quot;Old Man,&quot; and she in turn frequently addresses him by his first name rather than his rank or &quot;sir.&quot; She begins the series at the rank of lieutenant; at the start of the fourth season, she becomes a lieutenant commander and remains one until her death in the sixth-season finale.

During the early seasons, Jadzia Dax is pursued romantically by Dr. Julian Bashir. Dax consistently but politely rebuffs him, though she later admits that she somewhat enjoyed the attention (cf. &quot;Starship Down&quot;). After Jadzia&#x27;s death, Dax&#x27;s new host Ezri begins dating Bashir.

During the first season of the show, Jadzia Dax is often portrayed as somewhat reserved and aloof. In the early second-season episode &quot;The Siege&quot;, she is ill-at-ease in the spider-filled caverns of a Bajoran moon, and is later disoriented by Kira&#x27;s reckless piloting of a Bajoran starfighter. The writers&#x27; portrayal of the character begins to change in the second season, as they emphasize Jadzia Dax&#x27;s gusto for life and extensive knowledge of other cultures:
* The second-season episode &quot;Rules of Acquisition&quot; begins with a scene in which Jadzia Dax plays tongo with a group of Ferengi. She seems surprisingly at home in this setting, calmly ignoring their sexist overtures and showing considerable skill at the game. Later in the episode, she remarks that the Ferengi are among the most interesting races she has encountered.
* Later that season, Jadzia Dax joins a group of Klingons in a revenge quest (&quot;Blood Oath&quot;). In this episode, Curzon Dax is revealed to have been a Federation diplomat to the Klingon Empire, and to have sworn a blood oath against &quot;the Albino&quot; with the Klingons Kang, Koloth, and Kor. Jadzia takes up the blood oath, and against Sisko&#x27;s wishes, she travels to the Albino&#x27;s planet and participates in the revenge killing of the Albino and his minions. 
* Jadzia Dax&#x27;s connection to the Klingon culture became increasingly important as the series progressed, especially after the fourth-season arrival of Worf. In the episode &quot;The Sword of Kahless&quot;, Dax joins Worf and Kor in the search for the titular Klingon artifact. In &quot;Sons of Mogh&quot;, she becomes aware of and subsequently warns Captain Sisko of Worf&#x27;s attempt to kill his brother Kurn, and in &quot;Soldiers of the Empire&quot;, she and Worf go on a tense mission aboard a Klingon ship. Jadzia Dax eventually marries Worf and joins him as a member of the Klingon House of Martok.

==Sexuality==

Writers on &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; had previously hinted at a potential same-sex relationship in the first-season episode &quot;Dax&quot;, when Jadzia Dax says goodbye to Enina Tandro, a former lover of Dax&#x27;s previous male host, Curzon. The first take of the scene resulted in a situation in which whether Dax and Enina were about to kiss was unclear. It was decided at the time to be inappropriate, although the writers had hoped that a time would come when the viewers would accept such a relationship. This theme was eventually realized in &quot;Rejoined&quot;.

The episode &quot;Rejoined&quot;, in which Jadzia is reunited with the wife of a former host of the Dax symbiont, features one of the first televised kisses between two female characters. Terry Farrell was happy with the story line, saying that it made sense for Dax to have this issue because the symbiont had been in both male and female hosts, adding, &quot;Gender wasn&#x27;t the issue. For the worm/symbiont, it was a matter of the being it was embodied in.&quot; She was pleased to be able to &quot;stand up&quot; for the LGBT community.

In August 2019, Terry Farrell said that she regarded Jadzia as pansexual.

==Romantic interests==
Jadzia Dax was initially pursued by Dr. Julian Bashir aboard the station. The Ferengi bar owner, Quark, also has a special affection for the Trill scientist, even after the Dax symbiont was transferred to Ezri. However, her most notable and serious suitors include:
* Deral, played by Brett Cullen, a resident of the planet Meridian (&quot;Meridian&quot;)
* Dr. Lenara Kahn, played by Susanna Thompson, a Trill theoretical quantum physicist and the current host of the symbiont Kahn, who was previously joined to Nilani, the widow of Torias Dax (&quot;Rejoined&quot;).
* Lt. Commander Worf, a Klingon: Dax and Worf connected over their mutual love of Klingon traditions, including Klingon opera and martial arts. Their intimate relationship began in &quot;Looking for par&#x27;Mach in All the Wrong Places&quot;, and in &quot;You Are Cordially Invited...&quot;, they were married and Jadzia Dax formally joined the House of Martok. Their attempts at parenthood (despite the difficulties faced by biological incompatibilities between Klingons and Trills) were cut short when Jadzia Dax was murdered.
* Captain Boday, an unseen former lover of Jadzia&#x27;s, is occasionally referenced. Boday is a Gallamite, and like all Gallamites, has a transparent skull. Worf becomes angry with Jadzia when he learns she had lunch with Boday.

===Relationship with Worf===
In the fourth season, Michael Dorn joined the cast of &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; as the Klingon character Worf. Perhaps because of her past interactions with Klingons, Dax is fairly flirtatious with Worf. He appears at first to be oblivious to this attention, and in the fifth-season episode &quot;Looking for par&#x27;Mach in All the Wrong Places&quot;, he becomes enamored with a female Klingon named Grilka. This is resolved by the end of the episode, with Quark ironically winning the heart of Grilka, and Worf becoming romantically involved with Dax.

In the beginning, their relationship is very sexual, with the strong implication that their encounters are somewhat rough (the above episode ends with Worf and Dax visiting the infirmary with various bruises and other injuries). In the season-five finale &quot;Call to Arms&quot;, the station is overrun by Dominion forces, and Dax and Worf are assigned to different starships for the Dominion War. Near the end of the episode, they agree to get married after the war is over. Worf and Dax&#x27;s marriage is the centerpiece of season-six episode &quot;You Are Cordially Invited...&quot;. During the episode, Dax must obtain permission from the lady Sirella to join the House of Martok. At first, Dax is loath to pay Sirella the required respect, and the lady is unwilling to accede to Dax&#x27;s request. The situation is resolved by the conclusion, with Sirella admitting during the ceremony that nothing can stand between &quot;the beating of two Klingon hearts&quot;.

==Death==
Jadzia is murdered in &quot;Tears of the Prophets&quot;, the finale of the sixth season. Worf and she had decided to attempt to conceive, despite the doubts of Dr. Bashir that such a pregnancy was possible. After Major Kira tells Jadzia she has been praying for a conception, Jadzia receives encouraging test results from Julian, saying that the enzyme modification would allow her to become pregnant with Worf&#x27;s child. While the Federation leads an attack on Cardassia with the &quot;Defiant&quot;, Jadzia remains on the station for some unclear reason. Jadzia goes to the station&#x27;s Bajoran temple to thank the Prophets for the good news of her potential pregnancy. The Cardassian Dukat transports to the temple, possessed by a Pah-wraith, when Jadzia is there and unleashes his power, mortally wounding Jadzia. Dukat opens an Orb, one of the artifacts given by the Prophets to the Bajoran people; the Pah-wraith enters it, the wormhole closes, blocking access to the Prophets. Jadzia dies shortly after in the infirmary. Sisko, devastated by her death along with the severed link to the Prophets, leaves the station in despair and in search of answers.

Though the host Jadzia is dead, the symbiont Dax survives and is removed and sent to Trill to be implanted into a new host. During the journey, Dax is quickly implanted into a Trill named Ezri Tigan. The resulting joined Trill, Ezri Dax, becomes a main character during the seventh and last season of the series. Worf grieves a long time for Jadzia, believing that because she did not die in battle, they will not meet again in Sto-vo-kor. He leads a dangerous mission against The Dominion in her name, to win her entry to the Klingon afterlife.

==Reception==
In 2016, Screen Rant rated Jadzia Dax as the 19th-best character in &quot;Star Trek&quot; overall. In 2018, &quot;TheWrap&quot; placed Jadzia Dax as 26th of 39 in a ranking of main cast characters of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise prior to &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot;.

In 2017, CBR ranked Jadzia Dax the 13th-fiercest female character of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; universe.

In 2018, CBR ranked Jadzia the 18th-best Starfleet character of &quot;Star Trek.

In 2019, Jadzia was ranked the 12th-sexiest &quot;Star Trek&quot; character by Syfy. Writing for Syfy in 2020, Laura Dale called Jadzia “an early sci-fi trans allegory handled with respect”.

<text>Aylesbury ( ) is the county town of Buckinghamshire, England. It is home to the Roald Dahl Children&#x27;s Gallery and the Waterside Theatre. It is located in central Buckinghamshire, midway between High Wycombe and Milton Keynes.

Aylesbury was awarded Garden Town status in 2017. In 2021 it had a population of 63,273. The housing target for the town is set to grow with 16,000 homes set to be built by 2033.

==Etymology==

The town name is of Old English origin. It is first recorded in the form &quot;Æglesburg&quot; in the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, a text which took its present form in the later ninth century. The word &quot;Ægles&quot; is a personal name in the genitive case, meaning &quot;Ægel&#x27;s&quot; and means &quot;fortification&quot;. Thus the name once meant &quot;Fort of Ægel&quot; — though who Ægel was is not recorded. Nineteenth-century speculation that the name contained the Welsh word &quot;eglwys&quot; meaning &quot;a church&quot; (from Latin ) has been discredited.

==History==
Excavations in the town centre in 1985 found an Iron Age hill fort dating from the early 4th century BCE.

The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; portrays Aylesbury as being captured from the Britons by one Cuthwulf following the Battle of Bedcanford; the historicity of this event is doubtful, but the portrayal at least indicates that in the early Middle Ages the settlement was thought to be of some strategic importance. During the early medieval period, Aylesbury became a major market town, the burial place of Saint Osgyth, whose shrine attracted pilgrims. Aylesbury was a royal manor with eight attached hundreds in 1086, and some historians have supposed that it was already a royal manor before the Norman conquest. Some lands here were granted by William the Conqueror to citizens upon the tenure that the owners should provide straw for the monarch&#x27;s bed, sweet herbs for his chamber and two green geese and three eels for his table, whenever he should visit Aylesbury.

The town includes an Early English parish church, St. Mary the Virgin&#x27;s (which has many later additions).

In 1450, a religious institution called the Guild of St Mary was founded in Aylesbury by John Kemp, Archbishop of York. Known popularly as the Guild of Our Lady it became a meeting place for local dignitaries and a hotbed of political intrigue. The guild was influential in the outcome of the Wars of the Roses. Its premises at the Chantry in Church Street, Aylesbury, are still there, though today the site is used mainly for retail.

Aylesbury was declared the new county town of Buckinghamshire in 1529 by King Henry VIII: Aylesbury Manor was among the many properties belonging to Thomas Boleyn, the father of Anne Boleyn, and it is rumoured that the change was made by the King to curry favour with the family. The plague decimated the population in 1603/4.
The town played a large part in the English Civil War when it became a stronghold for the Parliamentarian forces, like many market towns a nursing-ground of Puritan sentiment and in 1642 the Battle of Aylesbury was fought and won by the Parliamentarians. Its proximity to Great Hampden, home of John Hampden has made of Hampden a local hero: his silhouette was used on the emblem of Aylesbury Vale District Council and his statue stands prominently in the town centre. Aylesbury-born composer, Rutland Boughton (1878–1960), possibly inspired by the statue of John Hampden, created a symphony based on Oliver Cromwell.

On 18 March 1664, Robert Bruce, 2nd Earl of Elgin in the Peerage of Scotland was created 1st Earl of Ailesbury.

The grade II* listed Jacobean mansion of Hartwell adjoining the southwest of the town was the residence of Louis XVIII during his exile (1810–1814). Bourbon Street in Aylesbury is named after the king. Louis&#x27;s wife, Marie Josephine of Savoy died at Hartwell in 1810 and is the only French queen to have died on English soil. After her death, her body was carried first to Westminster Abbey, and one year later to Sardinia, where the Savoy King of Sardinia had withdrawn during Napoleonic occupation of Turin and Piedmont; she is buried in the Cathedral of Cagliari.

Aylesbury&#x27;s heraldic crest displays the Aylesbury duck, which has been bred here since the birth of the Industrial Revolution, although only one breeder of true Aylesbury ducks, Richard Waller, remains today.

The town also received international publicity in 1963 when the culprits responsible for the Great Train Robbery (1963) were tried at Aylesbury Rural District Council Offices in Walton Street and sentenced at Aylesbury Crown Court. The robbery took place at Bridego Bridge, a railway bridge at Ledburn, about from the town.
A notable institution is Aylesbury Grammar School which was founded in 1598. The original building is now part of the County Museum buildings in Church Street and has grade II* architecture; other grammar schools now include Sir Henry Floyd Grammar School and Aylesbury High School. Other notable buildings are the King&#x27;s Head Inn, (which, with the Fleece Inn at Bretforton, is one of the few public houses in the country owned by the National Trust and still run as a public house) and the Queens Park Centre.

James Henry Govier, the British painter and etcher, lived at Aylesbury and produced a number of works relating to the town including the church, canal, Walton, Aylesbury Gaol, the King&#x27;s Head Inn and views of the town during the 1940s and 1950s, examples of which can be seen in the Buckinghamshire County Museum in Aylesbury.

The town is the birthplace of the Paralympic Games. During the 1948 Olympics in London, German-British neurologist Sir Ludwig Guttmann, set up a small sporting event for World War II veterans known as the World Wheelchair and Amputee Games (WWAG) at Stoke Mandeville Hospital Rehabilitation Facility in Aylesbury. This eventually led to the growth of the phenomenon of the modern Paralympic Games that has been held immediately after every Summer Olympic Games since 1988, and the WWAG was held most years at Stoke Mandeville until 1997, when it has been held in other countries and cities ever since. During the 2012 Paralympics, the official mascot was called &#x27;Mandeville&#x27; after Stoke Mandeville Hospital.

The Rothschild Family acquired many large country estates and stately homes around and near the town, including Waddesdon Manor in nearby Waddesdon Village, Halton House near Wendover and Tring Park in Tring across the border in Hertfordshire, although today most of these properties belong to the National Trust. They have brought in increased tourism to the town and the surrounding areas.

== The Aylesbury duck ==

In the 18th century selective breeding of white common ducks led to a white domestic duck, generally known as the English White. Since at least the 1690s ducks had been farmed in Aylesbury, and made Aylesbury known throughout England and beyond. They were bred and brought up by poor people, and sent to London by the weekly carriers. They went on to be known as the Aylesbury duck. 

The duck business in Aylesbury went into decline in the 19th century. By the time Beatrix Potter&#x27;s 1908 &quot;The Tale of Jemima Puddle-Duck&quot;—about an Aylesbury duck although set in Cumbria—caused renewed interest in the breed, the Aylesbury duck was in steep decline. The duckers of Buckinghamshire had generally failed to introduce technological improvements such as the incubator, and inbreeding had dangerously weakened the breed. Meanwhile, the cost of duck food had risen fourfold over the 19th century, and from 1873 onwards competition from Pekin and Pekin cross ducks was undercutting Aylesbury ducks at the marketplace. The First World War devastated the remaining duckers of Buckinghamshire. By the end of the war small-scale duck rearing in the Aylesbury Vale had vanished, with duck raising dominated by a few large duck farms. Shortages of duck food in the Second World War caused further disruption to the industry, and almost all duck farming in the Aylesbury Vale ended. A 1950 &quot;Aylesbury Duckling Day&quot; campaign to boost the reputation of the Aylesbury duck had little effect; by the end of the 1950s the last significant farms had closed, other than a single flock in Chesham owned by Mr L. T. Waller, and by 1966 there were no duck breeders remaining in Aylesbury. As of 2021 the Waller family&#x27;s farm in Chesham remains in business, the last surviving flock of pure Aylesbury meat ducks in the country. Although, there are still many hobbyists who keep the breed. 

The Aylesbury duck remains a symbol of the town of Aylesbury. Aylesbury United F.C. are nicknamed &quot;The Ducks&quot; and include an Aylesbury duck on their club badge, and the town&#x27;s coat of arms includes an Aylesbury duck and plaited straw, representing the two historic industries of the town. The Aylesbury Brewery Company, now defunct, featured the Aylesbury duck as its logo, an example of which can still be seen at the Britannia pub. Duck Farm Court is a shopping area of modern Aylesbury located near the historic hamlet of California, close to one of the main breeding grounds for ducks in the town, and there have been two pubs in the town with the name &quot;The Duck&quot; in recent years; one in Bedgrove that has since been demolished and one in Jackson Road that has recently been renamed.

== Demography ==

The town&#x27;s population has grown from 28,000 in the 1960s to almost 72,000 in 2011 due in the main to new housing developments, including many London overspill housing estates, built to ease pressure on the capital. Indeed, Aylesbury, to a greater extent than many English market towns, saw substantial areas of its own heart demolished in the 1950s/1960s as 16th–18th century houses (many in good repair) were demolished to make way for new, particularly retail, development.

Aylesbury&#x27;s population in the ten-year period since 2001 has grown by two thousand primarily related to the development of new housing estates which will eventually cater for eight thousand people on the north side, between the A41 (Akeman Street) and the A413 and the expansion of Fairford Leys estate.

According to the 2011 Census, the religious groupings in Aylesbury were: Christianity (55.7%), no religion (26.9%), Islam (8.3%), Hinduism (1.4%), other (0.4%). 6.7% of respondents did not state their religion.

===Future developments===
Anticipated developments are expected to raise the urban population of Aylesbury from its current approximation of 75,000 to over 100,000 between 2018 and 2023.

===Elevations, soil and geology===
Aylesbury is immediately southeast of the upper River Thame that flows past Thame to Dorchester on Thames and is partly sited on the two northernmost outcrops of Portland stone in England bisected by a small stream, Bear Brook which gives a relatively prominent position in relation to the terrain of all near, lower, fields and suburbs, which have largely slowly permeable Oxford Clay and Kimmeridge Clay soils. Elevations range from 72.5m above mean sea level to 95m AOD in contiguous parts of the town, however nearest villages range from 85m-90m to the north or from 85m to 115m on a narrow ridge to the southwest at Stone and towards the Chilterns to the southeast (Weston Turville, Stoke Mandeville and North Lee).

The town centre&#x27;s higher terrain is accurately described by Samuel Lewis in 1848 as a &quot;gentle eminence&quot;.
The county&#x27;s oldest rocks of Jurassic age cover the whole of the northern half of Buckinghamshire, succeeded continuously by younger rocks to the south of the Chilterns.

==Culture and community==

The town centre is home to many pubs and bars. The Queens Park Centre, which is the UK&#x27;s largest independent arts centre is also based in the town centre.

The local newspaper is the &quot;Bucks Herald&quot;, which started publishing in January 1832.

Local radio stations was named Mix 96, which first broadcast in April 1994, and eventually ceased operations in September 2020, being replaced by Greatest Hits Radio.
One of the more prominent buildings in Aylesbury is the &quot;Blue Leanie&quot; office block, home to Lloyds Bank. When first built it was thought to be a potential hazard to passing motorists, due to the sun reflecting off its large mirrored surface. As a result, a line of mature trees was planted alongside the main road to prevent dazzling.
BBC local radio station that broadcast to the town is BBC Three Counties Radio on 94.7 FM.

Local news and television programmes is provided by BBC South and ITV Meridian. Television signals are received from the Oxford transmitting station.

Aylesbury Waterside Theatre, a new £42 million theatre, with 1,200-seat auditorium, opened in October 2010. In addition to this, the surrounding area has been redeveloped a £100 million project known as the &#x27;Waterside project&#x27;. When this is completed, there will be of new retail floor space and 1,100 new jobs created, although when this will be completed now is unclear. A Waitrose supermarket opened opposite the theatre in August 2013, along with a Travelodge Hotel. Branches of Wagamama and Nando&#x27;s restaurants opened on &#x27;The Exchange&#x27; in February 2014, next to the Odeon cinema on Exchange Street. This included luxury and high-end studio apartments, new restaurants including Zizzi, The Grill Steakhouse and Rococo Lounge, as well as a new public square including metal statues that represent Aylesbury as the home of the Paralympics, as well as poetry covering the ground. Prior to this a Wagamama restaurant and a Nando&#x27;s restaurant have also opened on the site of the new square at the Exchange, known officially as &#x27;Festival Square&#x27;. Also, a new campus of the [Bucks New University] opened on the Waterside site next to the Waterside Theatre.

The Bourg Walk Bridge (also called the Southcourt Bridge or the Roberts Bridge after a local councillor) opened in March 2009 connecting Southcourt to Aylesbury town centre. The focus of the footbridge is a central concrete pillar with four suspension cables supporting the structure. This bridge forms a central part of the Aylesbury Hub project. Bourg Walk was nominated and won the Engineering Excellence Award 2009 awarded by the Institution of Civil Engineers – South East England branch.

==Governance==
There are two tiers of local government covering the town, at parish and unitary authority level: Aylesbury Town Council, based at Aylesbury Town Hall at 5 Church Street, and Buckinghamshire Council, which is also based in Aylesbury, having its headquarters at The Gateway on Gatehouse Road.

Aylesbury Town Council is the parish council for the town. As at May 2021 it comprises 25 councillors, 20 of whom are Liberal Democrats and 5 Conservative. The council represents only the constituents of Aylesbury town itself. Surrounding villages and some recent developments on the outskirts of Aylesbury like Fairford Leys &amp; Watermead have their own parish council. In 2010 the district council decided that the new developments of Berryfields and Weedon Hill, both to the north of Aylesbury, should also join to form a new parish as of May 2011.

The town council also elects the town mayor from the serving town councillors every year. The process culminates in a formal &quot;Mayor Making&quot; ceremony where the new mayor takes over from the preceding mayor. The role of mayor is mainly a ceremonial role representing the town at various events and acting as an ambassador for the town.

===Administrative history===

Aylesbury was made a borough by a charter from Mary I in 1554, which gave the town the right to elect two members of parliament and to establish a council to govern itself. The right to establish a council was opposed by the prominent local landowner Thomas Pakington, and it seems likely that this element of the charter was not put into effect at that time. In 1650, following the English Civil War, the town did establish a degree of self-government under the auspices of the 1554 charter. However, in 1664, in the aftermath of the Restoration, the town&#x27;s short-lived council was abolished and the rights it had held reverted to the Pakington family which had exercised them prior to the civil war. Thereafter the town was governed by its vestry in the same way as most rural areas, although it remained a parliamentary constituency.

In 1849 a local board of health was established to govern the town. This board was replaced by Aylesbury Urban District Council in 1894, which was subsequently given municipal borough status on 1 January 1917, becoming Aylesbury Borough Council. The borough council was awarded a coat of arms in 1964.

In 1974 Aylesbury Borough Council merged with several neighbouring districts to become Aylesbury Vale. No successor parish was initially created for Aylesbury, and it became an unparished area, directly administered by Aylesbury Vale District Council. The civil parish of Aylesbury was re-established in 2001, with its parish council taking the name Aylesbury Town Council. From 2001 to 2020 there were therefore three tiers of local government covering the town, at parish, district, and county level.

Aylesbury Vale District Council was abolished in 2020, merging with Buckinghamshire County Council and other district councils to become a unitary authority called Buckinghamshire Council. Since 1 April 2020, when Buckinghamshire Council came into being, it has been responsible for almost all statutory local government functions across the county.

==Education==
Aylesbury is home to one college of general further education (Aylesbury College on Oxford Road), three grammar schools, two community upper schools, an academy, a university technical college and a host of primary schools.
The secondary schools are:
*Aylesbury Grammar School (boys only)
*Aylesbury High School (girls only)
*The Aylesbury Vale Academy
*Buckinghamshire University Technical College
*The Grange School
*Sir Henry Floyd Grammar School
*Mandeville School

There are also the following special schools:
*The PACE Centre
*Pebble Brook School
*Stocklake Park Community School, formerly Park School

The Aylesbury Vale Secondary Support Centre is a Pupil referral unit (PRU), which caters for permanently excluded pupils.

Aylesbury Music Centre is a large educational establishment, which has its own premises adjoining Aylesbury High School and rivals the Royal College of Music, having produced members of national orchestras.

==Health==
Stoke Mandeville Hospital is a large National Health Service hospital to the south of the town centre. Its National Spinal Injuries Centre is one of the largest specialist spinal units in the world, and the pioneering rehabilitation work carried out there by Sir Ludwig Guttmann led to the development of the Paralympic Games. Stoke Mandeville Stadium was developed alongside the hospital and is the National Centre for Disability Sport in the United Kingdom.

Royal Buckinghamshire Hospital is a private hospital specialising in spinal cord injury.

Aylesbury has provisions for mental health therapy and treatments at the Tindal Centre on Bierton Road. The Tindal Centre closed in early 2014 and Mental Health therapy and treatments along with Adult and Older Adult Mental Health Team&#x27;s moved across the road to the new purpose-built hospital the Whiteleaf Centre. The former site of Tindal Centre has been transformed into a new housing development Bierton Place which has maintained the architecture of the original building and enhanced its beauty

==Trade and industry==

Traditionally the town was a commercial centre with a market dating back to the Saxon period. This is because it was established on the main Akeman Street which became an established trade route linking London to the southwest. In 1180 a gaol was established in the town .

===15th century===
By 1477 flour was being ground in the town for surrounding parishes. By the modern period this had grown into a huge established industry: the last grist mill in Aylesbury was closed in the 1990s (Hills &amp; Partridge on the canal behind Tesco). By 1560 the manufacture of sewing needles had become a large industry in Long Crendon a village close by which was an important production centre.

===17th century – lace making===
In 1672 poor children in Buckinghamshire were taught to make lace as a way to make a living. &quot;Bucks lace&quot; as it became known quickly became very sought after and production boomed as the lace was mainly made by poor women and children. The lace-making industry had died out by Victorian times, however, as new machine-made lace became cheaper.

In 1764 Euclid Neale opened his clockmaking workshop in Aylesbury. In the 18th century, he was one of the best clock makers in the country.

===19th century – canals===
In 1814, the Aylesbury arm of the Grand Union Canal from Marsworth was opened bringing major industry to the town for the first time. At the same time the Wendover arm was built leading to nearby Wendover.

===20th century – motor manufacture===
From 1919 until 1925 the Cubit Engineering Works on Bicester Road was a volume manufacturer of motor vehicles. Approximately 3,000 cars were built, but a somewhat slow and heavy design could not survive the onslaught from cheap American competition. Their robust design and high ground clearance made them popular in less developed parts of the British Empire which lacked paved roads like Australia and South Africa. The works have been demolished for a domestic housing development. The marque is commemorated by Cubitt Street (and Edge Street) which traverses the old works.

By the late 20th century, the printers and bookbinders, Hazell, Watson and Viney and the Nestlé dairy were the two main employers in the town, employing more than half the total population. These factories have long since been demolished and replaced by a Tesco supermarket which opened in 1994, and a housing development, respectively.

===21st century===
Today, the town is still a major commercial centre and the market still meets on the cobbles of the old Market Square four days a week. Nestle and Hazell, Watson and Viney and US automotive parts producer TRW have gone – the last left the town in 2006. However three major industrial and commercial centres make sure the town has one of the lowest unemployment rates in the country.

A £150 million Arla Foods &#x27;megadairy&#x27; opened just off the A41 road in nearby Aston Clinton in November 2013, roughly from the town centre and is a major employer in the area. Traffic improvement measures were paid for by Arla in order to reduce the impact of congestion and pollution.

==Sport and leisure==
Aylesbury has two local semi-professional football teams, Aylesbury Vale Dynamos F.C. which plays at Haywood Way and Aylesbury United F.C. which currently shares a ground with Chesham United. There is a strong cricket club in the town, that was formed in 1837 with success in the 1950s and 1980s and is again emerging as one of the strong clubs in mid- to north Buckinghamshire. Since 2013, Aylesbury has been host to a free 5 km run called the Aylesbury Parkrun.
Aylesbury is represented in Rugby Union by Aylesbury Rugby Football Club, situated at Ostler&#x27;s Field in the nearby village of Weston Turville; &#x27;The Ducks&#x27; play in the 6th tier of English Rugby.

Aylesbury&#x27;s recent sporting success comes in Gymnastics with the Aylesbury Gymnastics Academy, training out of the lynx gym centre, producing two Olympians and both coming away with bronze medals in the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games for Great Britain. 
==Transport==
===Rail===
The town is served by Aylesbury railway station and Aylesbury Vale Parkway railway station; the latter is terminus of passenger services of the London to Aylesbury Line from London Marylebone. Stoke Mandeville railway station also lies in the town&#x27;s urban area.

Railways came to Aylesbury early, in 1839 when the Aylesbury Railway opened from Cheddington on Robert Stephenson&#x27;s London and Birmingham Railway. The Wycombe Railway (later Great Western Railway) arrived via Princes Risborough on 1 October 1863, and on 23 September 1868 the Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway (later Metropolitan Railway) was opened from to almost connect a loop with the Wycombe Railway. The Metropolitan Railway (MetR) from Baker Street arrived via Amersham in 1892. The Great Central Railway (GCR) connected from Nottingham Victoria to London Marylebone via the MetR in 1899. Between 1899 and 1953, Aylesbury had railway links to four London termini: Marylebone, Baker Street, Paddington and Euston. The Aylesbury Railway closed in 1953, the MetR, which later became the Metropolitan line of the London Underground withdrew north of Aylesbury in 1936 and withdrew from the town in 1961. The GCR was dismantled north of Aylesbury in 1966. As a result, there were no regular passenger services north of Aylesbury until the opening of Aylesbury Vale Parkway railway station in December 2008. Now only the GCR south of Aylesbury Vale Parkway to Marylebone is used for regular London services.

A rail scheme to extend passenger services northwestwards to a new station, Aylesbury Vale Parkway, was completed in December 2008. This is sited on the formerly goods-only line towards Quainton at the point where the line crosses the A41 near Berryfields Farm on the north-west outskirts of the town, some north of the main Aylesbury station. This area is to be known as Berryfields, a major development area and will include park and ride facilities for Aylesbury.

A further expansion of rail services to a new Winslow railway station, , Bedford and Oxford via the Claydon LNE Junction (see East West Rail) is due to be opened by 2030. 
Until then connections are available to Oxford and Birmingham by changing at Princes Risborough.

===Roads===
Aylesbury is served by the A41 road from London to Birkenhead, which becomes the M40 motorway at Bicester west (by north) of Aylesbury. The A413 and A418 roads also run through the town. The M40 motorway at junction 9 is away and the M25 motorway is just over &#x27;s drive.

===Buses===
Aylesbury is served by Aylesbury bus station. In 2006, work commenced on the public transport hub, a scheme comprising a one-way loop of bus lanes around the town&#x27;s inner ring road, which includes improvements to the connectivity between bus and rail services. The first two phases of this scheme were completed in 2007, providing new bus lanes on Exchange Street, New Street, Friarage Road and White Hill, and also opened up High Street to buses. The final two phases, including the Bourg Walk Bridge and Station Boulevard were officially opened in April 2009.

The town is served by Buckinghamshire&#x27;s first &#x27;Rainbow Routes&#x27; network of bus services. The colour-coded routes were set up by Buckinghamshire County Council, and bus operators.

===Cycling demonstration town===

In 2005, the town won £1million funding to be one of six Cycling Demonstration towns in England, which was match-funded by Buckinghamshire County Council. This allows Buckinghamshire County Council to promote the use of cycling amongst the general public, as well as provide facilities for cyclists, such as bike lockers, bike stands, and Tiger and Toucan road crossings.

Cycle Aylesbury, the team created to undertake the Cycling Demonstration town work, recently opened the first of their Gemstone Cycleways, which are a network of routes running from Aylesbury town centre to various locations around the town, including Stone, Bierton, Wendover and Watermead. A second brochure/magazine was published to accompany the routes, along with a redesigned website, CycleAylesbury.co.uk.

==Popular culture==
A live music nightclub in Aylesbury was prominent in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s and renamed the Friars&#x27; Club in 1969. The venue hosted many of the top artists of the time, including Jimi Hendrix, the Rolling Stones, Cream, Otis Redding, the Clash, Hawkwind, Queen, Genesis, U2, David Bowie, Talking Heads, Marillion and the Ramones. Friars&#x27; Club celebrated its 40th anniversary in 2009 by holding three special concerts that reflected the various phases of the club&#x27;s musical history. The first concert in June featured the Edgar Broughton Band, the Groundhogs and the Pretty Things.

The rock band Marillion have a close association with Aylesbury. They originally formed there, with the band&#x27;s first single, 1982&#x27;s &quot;Market Square Heroes&quot;, taking its title inspiration from Aylesbury&#x27;s Market Square. The band continue to be based in the area, with their Racket Records studio still close to Aylesbury, and in 2007 the band performed together with their original lead singer, Fish, for the first time in 19 years at Aylesbury.
Aylesbury Methodist Church holds an annual organ recital, which attracts prominent national organists. The Roald Dahl Children&#x27;s Gallery in Church Street, Aylesbury, is a children&#x27;s museum in honour of novelist Roald Dahl that opened on 23 November 1996. Aylesbury hosts the Roald Dahl Festival, a procession of giant puppets based on his characters, on 2 July.

Comedian and actor Ronnie Barker (1929–2005) began his acting career in the town in the late 1940s and in September 2010, almost five years after his death, a bronze statue of him was unveiled by actor David Jason and Barker&#x27;s one time co-star Ronnie Corbett (the other half of the Two Ronnies) on a new public place in Exchange Street.

===Shown in productions===
Scenes from the film &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; were filmed in Friars Square in Aylesbury but did not make it to the final cut. This is the &#x27;Librarian Scene&#x27; where outtakes from the shoot and rehearsal can be seen in Alison Castle&#x27;s &quot;The Stanley Kubrick Archives&quot; published by Taschen. The opening scene, in which the droogs beat up an elderly Irishman, is mistakenly cited as being filmed in the underpass linking Friars Square Shopping Centre with the railway station. However, Christiane Kubrick&#x27;s book &quot;Stanley Kubrick – A Life in Pictures&quot; states that the underpass in the film has a different shape to the one in Aylesbury and these sequences were actually filmed in Wandsworth.

The County Court building and Aylesbury Market Square regularly feature in the BBC Television series &quot;Judge John Deed&quot;.

<text>Calouste Sarkis Gulbenkian (, ; 23 March 1869 – 20 July 1955) was an Ottoman-born British Armenian businessman and philanthropist. He played a major role in making the petroleum reserves of the Middle East available to Western development and is credited with being the first person to exploit Iraqi oil. Following the &quot;Red Line Agreement&quot; (said by some accounts to have been drafted by himself), a fixed 5% of the shares of the Turkish Petroleum Company (later renamed the Iraqi Petroleum Company) were to be consistently owned by him, for which he earned the nickname &quot;Mr. Five Per Cent&quot;. Gulbenkian travelled extensively and lived in a number of cities including his birth city of Constantinople and later London, Paris, and finally Lisbon.

Throughout his life, Gulbenkian was involved with many philanthropic activities including the establishment of schools, hospitals, and churches. The Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation, a private foundation based in Portugal, was created in 1956 by his bequest and continues to promote arts, charity, education, and science throughout the world. It is now among the largest foundations in Europe. By the end of his life he had become one of the world&#x27;s wealthiest people and his art acquisitions one of the greatest private collections.

==Biography==
===Family background===
Gulbenkian&#x27;s family are believed to be descendants of the Rshtunis, a noble Armenian family - &quot;Amira&quot; - centred on the Lake Van region in the 4th century AD. In the 11th century, the Rshtunis settled in Caesarea (now Kayseri), taking the name Vart Badrik, a Byzantine title. With the arrival of the Ottoman Turks, the Turkish equivalent of the name, Gülbenk, was adopted. The family had established themselves in the town of Talas and lived in the region until the mid-1800s, when they ultimately moved to Constantinople (present day Istanbul). Their property in Talas was ultimately confiscated and is currently owned by the Turkish Government.

Gulbenkian&#x27;s family established close relations with the House of Osman. By 1860, his father Sarkis Gulbenkian was an Armenian oil importer and exporter already heavily involved in the oil industry. Sarkis was an owner of several oil fields in the Caucasus, mainly in Baku, and was a representative of Alexander Mantashev&#x27;s oil company. Sarkis Gulbenkian also provided oil to the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire. During Hagop Pasha&#x27;s Directorship, and, subsequently, Ministry of the Privy Treasury under Sultan Abdulhamid II in 1879, Sarkis acquired the lucrative collection of taxes for the Privy Purse of Mesopotamia.
===Early life===
Calouste Sarkis Gulbenkian was born on 23 March 1869 in Scutari (Üsküdar), in the Ottoman capital Constantinople. He received his early education at Aramyan-Uncuyan, a local Armenian school. He then attended the Lycée Saint-Joseph French school and continued his studies at Robert College. These studies were cut short in 1884, when he moved to Marseille at the age of 15 to perfect his French at a high school there.

===Oil business===
Immediately afterwards his father sent him to be educated at King&#x27;s College London, where he studied petroleum engineering. He was a brilliant student and graduated in 1887 at the age of 18 with a first-class degree in engineering and applied sciences. A year later, he went to Baku to examine the Russian oil industry and to further his knowledge of the oil industry.

Gulbenkian later wrote an article entitled &quot;La Transcaucasie et la péninsule d&#x27;Apchéron; souvenirs de voyage&quot; (&quot;Transcaucasia and the Absheron Peninsula – Memoirs of a Journey&quot;) which appeared in the &quot;Revue des deux Mondes&quot;, a French language monthly literary and cultural affairs magazine. The article described his travels to Baku and the state of the oil industry in the region. It was eventually published as a book in 1891 in Paris.

After Hagop Pasha&#x27;s appointment as the Ottoman Minister of Finance in 1887, he had Calouste prepare an oil survey of Mesopotamia. To develop the oil survey, Calouste merely read travel books and interviewed railroad engineers that were surveying and building the Baghdad Railway. Gulbenkian&#x27;s oil survey led Hagop Pasha to believe that vast oil deposits lay in Mesopotamia (modern Syria and Iraq), to acquire tracts of land for the Sultan&#x27;s oil reserves, and to establish the Ottoman oil industry in Mesopotamia.

By 1895, he started his oil operation business. He had to return to the Ottoman Empire, but in 1896, Gulbenkian and his family fled the empire due to the Hamidian massacres of Armenians. They ended up in Egypt, where Gulbenkian met Alexander Mantashev, a prominent Armenian oil magnate and philanthropist. Mantashev introduced Gulbenkian to influential contacts in Cairo. These new acquaintances included Evelyn Baring, 1st Earl of Cromer. Still in his twenties, Gulbenkian moved to London in 1897 where he arranged deals in the oil business. He became a naturalised British citizen in 1902. In 1907, he helped arrange the merger of Royal Dutch Petroleum Company with &quot;Shell&quot; Transport and Trading Company Ltd. Gulbenkian emerged as a major shareholder of the newly formed company, Royal Dutch Shell. His policy of retaining five per cent of the shares of the oil companies he developed earned him the nickname &quot;Mr Five Per Cent&quot;.

After the royalist countercoup of 1909, Gulbenkian became a financial and economic adviser to the Turkish embassies in London and Paris, and later, chief financial adviser to the Turkish government. He was a member of a British technical team to Turkey and, later, a director of the National Bank of Turkey, which was established to support British designs.

In 1912 Gulbenkian was the driving force behind the creation of the Turkish Petroleum Company (TPC)—a consortium of the largest European oil companies aimed at cooperatively procuring oil exploration and development rights in the Ottoman territory of Mesopotamia, while excluding other interests. The German interests would be limited to a 25% share, with a 35% share for the British, and the remaining for Gulbenkian to choose. So, he gave Royal Dutch Shell 25% and kept 15% for himself as &quot;the conceiver, the founder, and the artisan of the Turkish Petroleum combine.&quot; A promise of these rights was made to the TPC, but the onset of World War I interrupted their efforts. At first, the British Foreign Office supported the d&#x27;Arcy group to gain a share and replace Calouste&#x27;s share, but Gulbenkian worked closely with French concerns, arranged for the French to receive the German&#x27;s share as part of the spoils of victory, and, in return, the French protected his interest.

During the dismantling of the Ottoman Empire after the war, most of Ottoman Syria came under the French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon and most of Ottoman Iraq came under British mandate. Heated and prolonged negotiations ensued regarding which companies could invest in the Turkish Petroleum Company. The TPC was granted exclusive oil exploration rights to Mesopotamia in 1925. The discovery of a large oil reserve at Baba Gurgur provided the impetus to conclude negotiations and in July 1928 an agreement, called the &quot;Red Line Agreement&quot;, was signed which determined which oil companies could invest in TPC and reserved 5% of the shares for Gulbenkian. The name of the company was changed to the Iraq Petroleum Company in 1929. The Pasha had actually given Gulbenkian the entire Iraqi oil concession. Gulbenkian, however, saw advantage in divesting the vast majority of his concession so that corporations would be able to develop the whole. Gulbenkian grew wealthy on the remainder. He reputedly said, &quot;Better a small piece of a big pie, than a big piece of a small one.&quot;

In 1938, before the beginning of World War II, Gulbenkian incorporated a Panamanian company to hold his assets in the oil industry. From this &quot;Participations and Explorations Corporation&quot; came the &quot;Partex Oil and Gas (Holdings) Corporation&quot;, a subsidiary of the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation headquartered in Lisbon until 2019.

===Art collection===
Gulbenkian amassed a huge fortune and an art collection which he kept in a private museum at his Paris house. An art expert said in a 1950 issue of &quot;Life&quot; magazine that &quot;Never in modern history has one man owned so much.&quot; His four-story, three-basement house on Avenue d&#x27;Iéna was said to be crammed with art, a situation ameliorated in 1936 when he lent thirty paintings to the National Gallery, London and his Egyptian sculpture to the British Museum.

Throughout his lifetime, Gulbenkian managed to collect over 6,400 pieces of art. From René Lalique alone, Gulbenkian commissioned more than 140 works over nearly 30 years. The collection includes objects from antiquity to the 20th century. Some of the works in the collection were bought during the Soviet sale of Hermitage paintings.

While Gulbenkian&#x27;s art collection may be found in many museums across the world, most of his art is exhibited at the Museu Calouste Gulbenkian in Lisbon, Portugal. The museum was founded according to his will, to accommodate and display his collection, now belonging to the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation. Of the roughly 6,000 items in the museum&#x27;s collections, a selection of around 1000 is on permanent display.

===Philanthropy===
Throughout his life, Gulbenkian donated large sums of money to churches, scholarships, schools, and hospitals. Many of his donations were to Armenian foundations and establishments. He required that proceeds from his 5% share of profits from oil should go to Armenian families. He also demanded that 5% of his workers in his oil production for the Iraq Petroleum Company should be of Armenian descent.

He established and built the St Sarkis Armenian church in Kensington, central London, England, built in 1922–23 as a memorial to his parents, to the design of the architect Arthur Davis. Gulbenkian wanted to provide &quot;spiritual comfort&quot; to the Armenian community and a place of gathering for &quot;dispersed Armenians,&quot; according to a message written by Gulbenkian to the Catholicos of All Armenians.

In 1929, he was the chief benefactor to the establishment of an extensive library at the St. James Cathedral, the principal church of the Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem. The library is called the Gulbenkian Library and contains more than 100,000 books.

Among many of his significant donations was to the Surp Pırgiç Armenian Hospital located in Istanbul. A large property called the &quot;Selamet Han&quot; was donated to the Surp Pırgiç foundation in 1954. The property was confiscated by the state in 1974, but returned to the foundation in 2011. He also helped establish a nurses&#x27; home at the hospital after selling his wife&#x27;s jewellery.

He was president of the Armenian General Benevolent Union (AGBU) from 1930 to 1932, resigning as a result of a smear campaign by &quot;Soviet Armenia&quot;, an Armenian newspaper based in Armenia SSR. He was also a major benefactor of Nubarashen and Nor Kesaria, which were newly founded settlements consisting of refugees from the Armenian genocide.

===Later life and death===

In 1937, Gulbenkian purchased a property near Deauville and called it &quot;Les Enclos&quot;. It was a place of repose for him. Nobel prize-winning writer and friend Saint-John Perse nicknamed him the &quot;Sage of Les Enclos&quot; and remarked in a letter to Gulbenkian that Les Enclos was &quot;the cornerstone of your work, because it is the most alive, the most intimate and sensitive, the best guarded secret for your dreams.&quot;

By the onset of the Second World War, having acquired diplomatic immunity as the economic adviser of the Persian legation in Paris, he followed the French government when it fled to Vichy, where he became the minister for Iran. In consequence, he was, despite his links to the UK, temporarily declared an enemy alien by the British Government, and his UK oil assets sequestered, though returned with compensation at the end of the war. He left France in late 1942 for Lisbon and lived there until his death, in a suite at the luxurious Aviz Hotel, on 20 July 1955, aged 86.

In 1952 he refused being appointed as Knight Commander, and therefore the possibility of being styled as &quot;Sir&quot;, to the Order of the British Empire. In this same year his wife Nevarte died in Paris. They had two children, a son Nubar and a daughter Rita, who would become the wife of Iranian diplomat of Armenian descent Kevork Loris Essayan.

His ashes were buried at St Sarkis Armenian Church in London.

==Legacy and fortune==

At the time of his death, Gulbenkian&#x27;s fortune was estimated at between US$280 million and US$840 million. Undisclosed sums were willed in trust to his descendants; the remainder of his fortune and art collection were willed to the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation (&quot;Fundação Calouste Gulbenkian&quot;), with US$400,000 to be reserved to restore the Etchmiadzin Cathedral, Armenia&#x27;s mother church, when relations with the Soviet Union permitted.

The foundation was to act for charitable, educational, artistic, and scientific purposes, and the named trustees were his long-time friend Baron Radcliffe of Werneth, Lisbon attorney José de Azeredo Perdigão (1896–1993), and Gulbenkian&#x27;s son-in-law, Kevork Loris Essayan (1897–1981). In Lisbon the foundation established its headquarters and the Calouste Gulbenkian Museum (&quot;Museu Calouste Gulbenkian&quot;) to display his art collection.

Funding was provided for an Oakley-class lifeboat for the Royal National Lifeboat Institution. It was christened &quot;Calouste Gulbenkian&quot; by his daughter at Weston-super-Mare Lifeboat Station on 17 March 1962 where it served until 1969. It was withdrawn from New Quay Lifeboat Station in 1991 and sold for preservation.

William Saroyan wrote a short story about Gulbenkian in his 1971 book, &quot;Letters from 74 rue Taitbout or Don&#x27;t Go But If You Must Say Hello To Everybody&quot;.

There are rooms and buildings at the University of Oxford named after Gulbenkian, including the Gulbenkian Reading Room in St Antony&#x27;s College, Oxford&#x27;s old library and the Gulbenkian Lecture Theater in the St Cross Building on Manor Road.

<doc id="205892" wikidata="Q234017" url="?curid=205892" title="Tammy Wynette">
<text>Tammy Wynette (born Virginia Wynette Pugh; May 5, 1942 – April 6, 1998) was an American country music singer and songwriter, considered among the genre&#x27;s most influential and successful artists. Along with Loretta Lynn, Wynette helped bring a woman&#x27;s perspective to the male-dominated country music field that helped other women find representation in the genre. Her characteristic vocal delivery has been acclaimed by critics, journalists and writers for conveying unique emotion. Twenty of her singles topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; country chart during her career. Her signature song &quot;Stand by Your Man&quot; received both acclaim and criticism for its portrayal of women&#x27;s loyalty towards their husbands.

Wynette was born and raised near Tremont, a small town in Itawamba County, Mississippi, by her mother, stepfather, and maternal grandparents. During childhood, Wynette picked cotton on her family&#x27;s farm but also had aspirations of becoming a singer. She performed music through her teen years and married Euple Byrd at age 17. Wynette enrolled in cosmetology school and later appeared on a local country music television program. Wynette then divorced and moved to Nashville, Tennessee, to pursue a country music career in 1965. She soon met her second husband, Don Chapel, and eventually signed with Epic Records. Under the production of Billy Sherrill, her first single, &quot;Apartment No. 9&quot;, was released in 1966. In 1967, she had her first commercial success with the single &quot;Your Good Girl&#x27;s Gonna Go Bad&quot;. In the late sixties, Wynette&#x27;s career rose further with the number one &quot;Billboard&quot; country singles &quot;I Don&#x27;t Wanna Play House&quot;, &quot;D-I-V-O-R-C-E&quot; and the self-penned &quot;Stand by Your Man&quot;.

As her career entered the 1970s, Wynette was among country music&#x27;s most popular artists and regularly topped the charts. During the late 1960s, she had met and in 1969 married her third husband, fellow country artist George Jones. The pair had a recording career together that resulted in several number one country singles and a successful touring act. However, their relationship was tumultuous and they divorced in 1975. Following their separation Wynette returned as a headlining solo performer. She also continued to have singles regularly make the upper reaches of the country charts into the 1980s. During this time, she also acted on several television shows, including &quot;Capitol&quot; (1986). Wynette had several more high-profile relationships before marrying her final husband, George Richey, in 1978. Several intestinal health problems led to hospitalizations and addictions to prescription pain killers, the latter of which was said to have led to her death in 1998.

Wynette has sold an estimated 30 million records worldwide. She has received two Grammy Awards, three Country Music Association awards, and two Academy of Country Music Awards. Wynette was also among country music&#x27;s first female performers to have discs certify gold and platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. Her influence as a country music artist led to several inductions into music associations. This includes inductions into the Country Music Hall of Fame and the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame.

==Early years==
Virginia Wynette Pugh was born in Itawamba County, Mississippi, in 1942. The farm where she was born was near the Alabama state line, between Red Bay, Alabama, and Tremont, Mississippi. She later credited both Alabama and Mississippi as her home states. She was the only child born to Mildred Faye Russell and William Hollis Pugh. Mildred Russell was a school teacher, while William Pugh was an aspiring musician who played guitar and sang in a group. Her father was diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumor and died when Wynette was only nine months old. Weeks before his death, Wynette&#x27;s father brought her to the family piano and insisted she learn to play when she became old enough. Following his death, Wynette&#x27;s mother moved to Memphis, Tennessee, where she worked in a defense plant during World War II. She was left in the care of her grandparents and picked cotton on their Mississippi farm. &quot;I hated every minute I spent picking cotton&quot;, she recalled. Her mother&#x27;s sister, Carolyn Russell, was raised alongside Wynette and they developed a sister-like bond. She also learned to play the musical instruments that her father left behind.

Wynette referred to her grandparents as &quot;Mama&quot; and &quot;Daddy&quot; while Mildred Russell was simply referred to as &quot;Mother&quot;. Most people referred to young Virginia Pugh by her middle name, &quot;Wynette&quot;. In 1946, Mildred Russell married Wynette&#x27;s stepfather, Foy Lee. As a child, Wynette played basketball but was not allowed to wear the shorts provided to the girls&#x27; team. Instead, her grandfather had Wynette wear blue jeans. She later made the all-state basketball team in both 1958 and 1959. She also took piano lessons and learned to play by ear. After several lessons, the instructor told her mother she was &quot;wasting her money&quot; because of her natural ability on the instrument. In upper elementary school, Wynette befriended classmate Linda Cayson. The pair became close friends and later realized they could harmonize with one another. Along with another friend, they would form a trio called Wynette, Linda &amp; Imogene. The trio often sang at gospel functions together. A local Methodist minister had both Linda and Wynette sing on his early-morning Saturday radio show on WERH. They listened to music together, including country artists Ernest Tubb and Hank Williams.

Wynette attended Tremont High School in Tremont, Mississippi. She was considered to be &quot;popular&quot; by high school friends. In 1960, she was voted &quot;Miss Tremont High School&quot; by her classmates. She smoked cigarettes and became fascinated with the opposite sex. &quot;She was into datin&#x27; and boys long before we were&quot;, recalled friend Holly Ford. However, her mother Mildred disapproved of her daughter dating and the pair often argued about it during her teenage years. During this period, Wynette fell in love with Billy Cole, who attended the same church. She insisted on marrying Cole and attempted to keep it from her mother by mail-ordering eight dollar rings to her high school. However, Wynette&#x27;s mother discovered her daughter&#x27;s idea and stopped the courtship. She temporarily moved to Birmingham, Alabama, when she was 17, where her mother and Foy Lee were living at the time. She soon moved back to her grandparents&#x27; farm after her mother found her difficult to control.

At age 17, she married Euple Byrd, which caused friction with Wynette&#x27;s mother. The couple lived temporarily at Euple&#x27;s family home and then in a small apartment in Tupelo, Mississippi. By this point, Wynette had become pregnant with her first child and was given the opportunity to live rent-free at a home owned by her grandfather. Built in 1844, the home had no running water, heat, or electricity. Friend Linda Cayson helped Wynette nail cardboard boxes to the walls to keep the wind out during the winter months.

In 1963, Euple obtained a job in Red Bay, Alabama, that allowed the family to move to a home with more amenities. To help sustain themselves financially, Wynette convinced her mother to help pay for her to attend Mrs. McGuire&#x27;s School of Beauty. In the middle of her schooling, Euple found work in Memphis, Tennessee, and the young family moved there. In Memphis, she obtained a job as a barmaid and sang for customers. Both the bar owner and the building&#x27;s in-house pianist were impressed by Wynette&#x27;s talents and encouraged a move to Nashville, Tennessee. However, the family soon returned to Tupelo where she finished cosmetology school. After becoming famous, she continued renewing her cosmetology license every year for the rest of her life, in case she ever had to go back to a daily job. Wynette ultimately left her first marriage and moved to Birmingham, Alabama.

==Career==
===1964–1966: Early career in Alabama and the move to Nashville===
Wynette moved to Birmingham in 1964 and lived with her paternal grandparents, uncle, and cousins. She discovered that her cosmetology license wouldn&#x27;t transfer to Alabama, so she enrolled at a beauty college. Her paternal family also encouraged Wynette&#x27;s musical talents. Her uncle worked for the WBRC television station in Birmingham and helped his niece secure an audition for the &quot;Country Boy Eddie&quot; country music television show. The show&#x27;s headliner, Eddie Burns, was impressed and agreed to have her on the program. On her first show, she sang a cover of Patsy Cline&#x27;s &quot;Sweet Dreams&quot; while the camera pointed above her waist to avoid showing Wynette&#x27;s pregnant body. Wynette performed on the program from six to eight o&#x27;clock each morning before going to school, then went to work at the Midfield Beauty Salon. She received 45 dollars per week. She befriended the show&#x27;s pianist, David Vest, who helped record demos. The pair often performed together, playing piano bars in the Birmingham area.

Wynette started visiting a local radio station called WYAM and met disc jockey Fred Lehner. She accompanied Lehner on a trip to Nashville, Tennessee, which inspired her to pursue a country music career. Meanwhile, Euple Byrd continued returning to Birmingham. Not officially divorced, the couple agreed to give their marriage one final chance and they lived in a Birmingham housing project near the steel industry. Byrd secured a new job but did not return to their residence, according to Wynette. She decided to make the move to Nashville in January 1966 with her three children and all their belongings in their car.
After she arrived in Nashville, Wynette moved into the Anchor Motel while she attempted to secure a recording contract. She met her future husband, musician Don Chapel, at the motel. They eventually moved into an East Nashville apartment and put together a road show. For several months the pair performed in several states, including Georgia and Pennsylvania. Chapel attempted to help Wynette secure a country recording contract with the Musicor, Hickory, Kapp, and Decca labels, but Wynette was turned down by every company. Nashville producer Kelso Herston helped her arrange a meeting with new Epic Records producer Billy Sherrill. Wynette went into Sherrill&#x27;s office and pitched him several songs. Sherrill was impressed by her voice and signed her to a recording contract with Epic in 1966.

On her first recording session, Wynette cut Bobby Austin&#x27;s &quot;Apartment No. 9&quot;. At that point Sherrill changed her stage name from Wynette Byrd to Tammy Wynette. &quot;You look like a Tammy to Me,&quot; Sherrill told her in reference to the film &quot;Tammy and the Bachelor&quot;. &quot;Apartment No. 9&quot; was released as Wynette&#x27;s debut single and reached number 44 on the American &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Songs chart. Although she had a charting single, Wynette still had little income. Sherrill arranged for booking agent Hubert Long to set up tour dates for her. Most promoters did not want to book Wynette because she was a female performer. &quot;I had begun to realize I was working in a man&#x27;s world, and most of them looked down on women in the business&quot;, she later explained.

===1967–1975: Breakthrough, &quot;Stand by Your Man&quot; and recordings with George Jones===
In 1967, Epic released &quot;Your Good Girl&#x27;s Gonna Go Bad&quot;. It climbed to number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country singles chart and was Wynette&#x27;s first chart success. Her debut album of the same name was also released in 1967 and reached number seven on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Country LPs chart. They were followed by a duet with David Houston called &quot;My Elusive Dreams&quot;, which was her first number one country single. Its follow-up was the solo single &quot;I Don&#x27;t Wanna Play House&quot; which topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; country chart in 1967. It later won Wynette the Grammy Award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance. Her next singles topped the country charts through 1968: &quot;Take Me to Your World&quot; and &quot;D-I-V-O-R-C-E&quot;. The latter was her second to make the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and also her first to top Canada&#x27;s &quot;RPM&quot; country chart. The recordings appeared on Wynette&#x27;s third studio disc, &quot;Take Me to Your World / I Don&#x27;t Wanna Play House&quot;, which reached number three on the Country LPs chart in 1968.
Wynette started touring amidst her newfound success. She was joined by second husband, Don Chapel, and a band called the Countrypolitans. The group featured a drummer, steel guitarist, guitar player, bass player, and background singer. Wynette herself played acoustic guitar on occasion. She toured for the first time internationally in late 1967 to Germany and the United Kingdom. She also did several package dates with Chapel, David Houston, and George Jones. Wynette and Jones began performing &quot;My Elusive Dreams&quot; on the road following an argument with Houston&#x27;s management. Upon realizing their romantic feelings for one another, Wynette divorced Chapel and married Jones in 1969.

During this time, Wynette went into the studio to record the single &quot;Stand by Your Man&quot;. Reportedly written by Wynette and Billy Sherrill in 15 minutes, the song&#x27;s emphasis on women standing by their husbands made her a spokeswoman for the working class housewife. It also received criticism from the feminist movement who found it too conservative. &quot;Stand by Your Man&quot; topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; and &quot;RPM&quot; country charts, reached number 19 on the Hot 100 and later topped the charts in the United Kingdom. A corresponding LP of the same name reached number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country albums chart.

In the wake of &quot;Stand by Your Man&quot;, Wynette received a series of accolades. In 1969, she joined the cast of the Grand Ole Opry and won her second Grammy award. She won the 1969 Top Female Vocalist accolade from the Academy of Country Music and three back-to-back honors for Female Vocalist of the Year from the Country Music Association (1968, 1969 and 1970). Her 1969 compilation, &quot;Tammy&#x27;s Greatest Hits&quot;, was among the first female country albums to certify gold (and later platinum) by the Recording Industry Association of America. Critics had also taken notice of her music. Greg Adams of AllMusic described the &quot;Stand by Your Man&quot; LP as &quot;consistent&quot; and gave it five stars. Writer Kurt Wolff found her material &quot;from the mid-60&#x27;s onward&quot; created &quot;a solid female perspective on country radio that the listening public badly craved.&quot; Meanwhile, rock critic Robert Christgau found Wynette&#x27;s &quot;sultry&quot; delivery to have &quot;archetypal power&quot;.
Wynette was among country music&#x27;s most commercially successful and popular artists. She followed it with ten more singles that topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; country chart: &quot;Singing My Song&quot; (1969), &quot;The Ways to Love a Man&quot; (1969), &quot;He Loves Me All the Way&quot; (1970), &quot;Run Woman Run&quot; (1970), &quot;Good Lovin&#x27; (Makes It Right)&quot; (1971), &quot;Bedtime Story&quot; (1971), &quot;My Man (Understands)&quot; (1972), &quot;&#x27;Til I Get It Right&quot; (1972), &quot;Kids Say the Darndest Things&quot; (1973), and &quot;Another Lonely Song&quot; (1973). Most of these songs followed similar themes about housewives attempting to keep their husbands happy or the effects that troubled marriages have on children. Additionally, Epic Records released a series of studio albums by Wynette during this period. Between 1969 and 1970 alone, Epic released six original albums. This included the 1969 gospel LP, &quot;Inspiration&quot;, and the 1970 holiday LP, &quot;Christmas with Tammy&quot;. Additional album projects featured her number one and top ten singles of the period. Of these LPs, &quot;Tammy&#x27;s Touch&quot; (1970) topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; country albums chart. &quot;The Ways to Love a Man&quot; (1970), &quot;The First Lady&quot; (1971) and &quot;My Man&quot; (1972) reached the &quot;Billboard&quot; country top five.

Jones and Wynette had been wanting to record together since they married. Although they started touring together in 1969, they could not record together until 1971, when Jones was released from his previous contract. Their first single was a remake of Jones&#x27;s solo release, &quot;Take Me&quot;. In 1971, it climbed to number nine on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country chart and number 12 on the &quot;RPM&quot; country chart. Their first studio LP, &quot;We Go Together&quot; (1971), reached the top five of the &quot;Billboard&quot; country albums chart. Their 1972 single, &quot;The Ceremony&quot;, was also a top ten single in the United States and Canada. Altogether, Epic label issued seven studio albums of Jones and Wynette duets. The pair were considered among country music&#x27;s most successful and well-known duet partnerships. Touring as a packaged duo, they were often referred to as the &quot;President and First Lady&quot;. Their tour bus was labeled &quot;Mr. and Mrs. Country Music&quot;.

However, their marriage had several challenges which made their day-to-day life difficult, such as Jones&#x27;s alcoholism. Jones often missed shows after drinking too much, which increased Wynette&#x27;s growing frustration with their relationship. The couple&#x27;s marital problems prompted her to file for divorce in 1973, but the pair reconciled. Shortly afterwards, they recorded the autobiographical single, &quot;We&#x27;re Gonna Hold On&quot;. It became their first song to top the &quot;Billboard&quot; country chart. An album of the same name charted at number three on the Country LPs list. It was followed by the top ten single &quot;We Loved It Away&quot; in 1974. After a fight between the couple, Wynette filed for divorce again. This time however, the pair went through with it and they officially split in 1975. Despite their divorce, they were coaxed back into the studio once more to record the album &quot;Golden Ring&quot;. Its title track became the duo&#x27;s second &quot;Billboard&quot; number one country single, while also reaching number five in Canada in 1976.

===1976–1984: Solo return with &quot;&#x27;Til I Can Make It on My Own&quot; and continued success===
Despite her divorce from George Jones, Wynette had to continue her career. However, she had anxiety about doing so. Fans would shout, &quot;Where&#x27;s George?&quot; during most early performances following their split. &quot;Even though I&#x27;d been on stage for eight years, I didn&#x27;t know how to communicate with the people,&quot; she recalled. Previously a packaged act with Jones, Wynette created her own stage show for the first time. She hired the Gatlin Brothers (Larry Gatlin and his brothers Rudy and Steve) to be her road band. She also hired several women as part of her road crew. Wynette included up-tempo gospel songs to energize the audience along with slow ballads that were &quot;extraordinarily intimate,&quot; according to writers Mary A. Bufwack and Robert K. Oermann.

In 1976, she returned to the top of American and Canadian country songs charts with &quot;&#x27;Til I Can Make It on My Own&quot;. It was her first &quot;Billboard&quot; chart-topper as a solo artist in almost three years. The song was co-written by Wynette and reflected her life following the divorce. According to Wynette, it was her favorite song she recorded in her career. Her album of the same name reached number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country LPs chart. &quot;&#x27;Til I Can Make It on My Own&quot; was nominated for Song of the Year by the Country Music Association, while Wynette herself was nominated for Female Vocalist of the Year. Her next release, &quot;You and Me&quot;, also topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; country chart, while a corresponding studio LP reached the country albums top five. A duet with Jones recorded the year before, &quot;Near You&quot;, also topped the North American country charts in 1976.

Several incidents in Wynette&#x27;s personal life also occurred during this period. These incidents included several short-term relationships, house burglaries, and alleged kidnappings. She also developed health problems that led to a dependence on pain killers. Yet, her commercial success continued. Although none of her solo singles topped the charts, she continued reaching the top ten. Both &quot;(Let&#x27;s Get Together) One Last Time&quot; and &quot;One of a Kind&quot; reached number six on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country chart in 1977. Through 1979, Wynette had three more solo releases reach the &quot;Billboard&quot; and &quot;RPM&quot; top ten: &quot;Womanhood&quot;, &quot;They Call It Making Love&quot; and &quot;No One Else in the World&quot;.

Critics and writers highlighted Wynette&#x27;s music of this period. Bufwack and Oermann observed that her late 1970s singles &quot;took a candid look at modern sexuality&quot;. AllMusic&#x27;s Thom Jurek found 1977&#x27;s &quot;One of a Kind&quot; LP to evoke the performances of a &quot;true diva&quot; and &quot;country music&#x27;s reigning queen&quot;. Critic Eugene Chadbourne found the musical quality of 1978&#x27;s &quot;Womanhood&quot; to be mediocre and gave it two-and-a-half stars.
As the 1980s progressed, Wynette continued having commercial success but with less frequency. In 1980, she reunited with George Jones for the duet single &quot;Two Story House&quot;. It reached number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country chart and number one on the &quot;RPM&quot; country chart. However, it also proved to be her final American top five single. The pair also reunited for several shows including a performance at Wembley Stadium and an HBO special. In 1980, Wynette told Billy Sherrill that she was ready to work with a new record producer. &quot;She needed fresh blood, fresh ideas,&quot; Sherrill commented in 2010. The final Sherrill-produced album was 1980&#x27;s &quot;Only Lonely Sometimes&quot;. Both singles from the LP (&quot;He Was There (When I Needed You)&quot; and &quot;Starting Over&quot;) reached number 17 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country chart.

Several years prior, Wynette married for the fifth (and final) time to George Richey. The pair previously wrote songs together, but after marrying, he became her full-time manager. Besides business affairs, he also produced several of her albums. Following the Chips Moman-produced &quot;You Brought Me Back&quot; (1981), Richey produced Wynette&#x27;s 1982 LP, &quot;Soft Touch&quot;. The album spawned &quot;Another Chance&quot;, which became her first top ten single in several years. Additional early 1980s singles made the country top 20: &quot;Crying in the Rain&quot; (1981), &quot;You Still Get to Me in My Dreams&quot; (1982), and &quot;A Good Night&#x27;s Love&quot; (1983). Wynette&#x27;s record sales began to wane following 1982. Both the albums &quot;Good Love &amp; Heartbreak&quot; (1982) and &quot;Even the Strong Get Lonely&quot; (1983) reached only the &quot;Billboard&quot; country top 60. Wynette&#x27;s singles also reached progressively lower chart positions following 1982. This included &quot;Still in the Ring&quot; and a cover of John Prine&#x27;s &quot;Unwed Fathers&quot;.

===1985–1998: Commercial comeback, collaborations and final years===
Around 1985, Wynette made changes to her declining career. She hired California-based Stan Moress to serve as her manager. Moress had Wynette cut her hair, change her wardrobe, and incorporate choreography into her shows. Steve Buckingham also started producing Wynette&#x27;s next album, which was to feature a duet. Although she wanted to collaborate with Merle Haggard, she was instead paired with Mark Gray. Gray had left Exile before that band&#x27;s shift from pop to country, and was beginning a solo country music career of his own at the time. Their result was a cover of the pop song &quot;Sometimes When We Touch&quot;. Wynette and Gray&#x27;s rendition peaked at number six on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country chart in 1985. It became her first top ten recording in four years. The Buckingham collaboration resulted in Wynette&#x27;s 1985 album of the same name, which charted at number 32 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country LPs survey. Amidst a commercial comeback, Wynette also faced several setbacks. In late 1986, Wynette entered the Betty Ford Center to treat her addiction to prescription drugs. Two years later, Wynette and her husband declared bankruptcy following several failed investments.

Wynette&#x27;s longtime label released her next album titled &quot;Higher Ground&quot; in 1987. The second Buckingham-produced project, he described it as &quot;a more rural, more back-home&quot; album. It featured collaborations with Emmylou Harris, Ricky Skaggs, The O&#x27;Kanes, Gene Watson, and Larry Gatlin. Bufwack and Oermann called it a &quot;landmark LP&quot;, while AllMusic gave it a four-star rating. Despite positive reviews, &quot;Higher Ground&quot; only peaked at number 43 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country chart. Its singles proved more commercially successful. In 1987, &quot;Your Love&quot; reached the American and Canadian country songs top 20, while &quot;Talkin&#x27; to Myself Again&quot; reached number 16 on the former. Following &quot;Higher Ground&quot;, Buckingham told Sony Music executives that it was becoming difficult to think of new album concepts for Wynette. This resulted in a temporary end to their professional partnership. Instead, she was paired with producer Norro Wilson for 1989&#x27;s &quot;Next to You&quot; and Bob Montgomery for 1990&#x27;s &quot;Heart Over Mind&quot;. Singles spawned from both albums reached positions outside the &quot;Billboard&quot; and &quot;RPM&quot; country top 40.

As Wynette&#x27;s career entered the 1990s, several new team members were hired to manage her business affairs. These included Epic vice president Mark Martinovich, who had to convince the Nashville establishment that Wynette was still marketable. Martinovich had her perform in more diverse settings, including The Bottom Line venue in Greenwich Village. Other new ventures included Wynette recording with British group the KLF. In 1991, they collaborated on the song, &quot;Justified and Ancient (Stand by the JAMs)&quot;. KLF member Bill Drummond was a fan of Wynette&#x27;s and personally called to ask her permission to record the track. Wynette accepted and Drummond helped produce it. Although she had difficulty singing in-time to the track, the song was pieced together by studio engineers when Drummond returned to England. The dance-pop song centering around an imaginary setting called &quot;Mu Mu Land&quot; was considered a departure from Wynette&#x27;s previous recordings in terms of song choice and production. It became a chart success. By 1992, the single was being routinely played on MTV and reached number one in 18 countries.

In 1993, Wynette joined with Loretta Lynn and Dolly Parton to record the studio album &quot;Honky Tonk Angels&quot;. Parton herself explained that she wanted to make the project &quot;before one of us goes&quot;. Consisting of classic country recordings performed in three-part harmonies, the album reunited Wynette with Steve Buckingham. Several selections on the project were penned by the trio, including one composed by Wynette herself. &quot;Honky Tonk Angels&quot; reached number six on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country albums chart and number 42 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. It was Wynette&#x27;s first top ten &quot;Billboard&quot; album in 18 years and her first album in 22 years to certify gold in the United States. AllMusic&#x27;s Kelly McCartney called it &quot;a fun listen&quot; while the Songwriters Hall of Fame described it as a &quot;landmark album&quot;.

In 1994, Wynette released a studio album of duets titled &quot;Without Walls&quot;. It featured collaborations with notable artists of the era including Melissa Etheridge, Elton John, and Sting. Its first single was a duet with Wynonna Judd titled &quot;Girl Thang&quot;, which was among Wynette&#x27;s final charting singles. Although it did not chart in North America, &quot;Without Walls&quot; did reach number eight on the ARIA charts in Australia. The project received mixed reviews. BBC called it a &quot;respect-laden series of duets&quot;, while biographer Jimmy McDonough called it &quot;cringe-worthy&quot;. Health problems continued to affect Wynette into the 1990s as her dependence on prescription drugs increased. She often missed concerts because she was too ill to perform. In the mid-1990s, Wynette was hospitalized with a severe bile duct infection that nearly led to her death. Wynette was visited by George Jones during her recovery, who encouraged her to record another album with him. The result was 1995&#x27;s &quot;One&quot;. Released on MCA Records, the album reached number 12 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; country chart. It was followed by a high-profile duet tour featuring Jones and Wynette as headliners.

In 1995, Wynette was dropped by her long-time label, Epic Records. Despite this, she continued to be a popular concert attraction until her death. During this period, she re-made The Beach Boys&#x27; &quot;In My Room&quot; with Brian Wilson. The song proved to be her final recording. Wynette&#x27;s final concerts and television performances were held in March 1998.

==Other works==
Other works by Wynette have also appeared outside of music. In 1979, she published a book about her life with author Joan Dew. Released by Simon &amp; Schuster, it was titled &quot;Stand by Your Man: An Autobiography&quot;. Dew toured with Wynette in the 1970s and wrote down what Wynette told her verbatim.

Wynette&#x27;s career also took shape through film and television. In 1981, CBS aired a television film about her life, also called &quot;Stand by Your Man&quot;. Directed by Jerry Jameson, the film featured Annette O&#x27;Toole as Wynette while George Jones was portrayed by Tim McIntire. Both actors did their own singing for the roles. It was reviewed unfavorably by newspaper critics. &quot;The New York Times&quot; commented, &quot;The rags-to-riches sagas, presumably meant to be inspiring, tend to get trapped under a cloud of dreariness,&quot; wrote John O&#x27;Connor. &quot;Suspicious viewers may legitimately conclude that the whole Tammy Wynette story has yet to be told.&quot; Richard Harrington of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; wrote, &quot;It seems to capitalize on the creative achievement and financial success of the Loretta Lynn film bio, &#x27;Coal Miner&#x27;s Daughter.&#x27; Unfortunately, television will be television, and the results are lackluster and somewhat misleading.&quot;

In 1986, Wynette joined the cast of the CBS soap opera &quot;Capitol&quot;, playing the role of a hair stylist-turned-singer, Darlene Stankowski. It was her first major acting role. In 1987, BBC released a documentary about her life called &quot;Stand by Your Dream&quot;. A film crew followed Wynette while on the road and at home with her husband. The documentary was directed by Rosemary Bowen-Jones, who commented on it years later: &quot;When you&#x27;re someone like that, you&#x27;ve kind of rehearsed your life.&quot; Throughout her life, Wynette enjoyed cooking, and repeatedly cooked pinto beans on a range on her tour bus. This would inspire her to compile her 1990 cookbook &quot;Tammy Wynette&#x27;s Southern Cookbook&quot;, issued by the Pelican Publishing Company. The book featured southern American-inspired recipes used routinely in Wynette&#x27;s family.

In the 1990s, Wynette received more exposure on television. In 1994, she guest-starred on Burt Reynolds&#x27;s CBS television program &quot;Evening Shade&quot;. Fellow country artist K. T. Oslin also appeared on the show. She made a cameo on the sitcom &quot;Married... with Children&quot; in 1996. Wynette later voiced a role for the animated television show &quot;King of the Hill&quot;. She portrayed Hank Hill&#x27;s mother between 1997 and 1998.

Further works about her were released posthumously. Among them were three books that appeared in the years following her death. The first was written by Wynette&#x27;s daughter, Jaclyn Daly, titled &quot;Tammy Wynette: A Daughter Recalls Her Mother&#x27;s Tragic Life and Death&quot;. Daly collaborated on the book with country music biographer Tom Carter. The second was written by Jimmy McDonough and titled &quot;Tammy Wynette: Tragic Country Queen&quot;. The book offered a detailed account of both Wynette&#x27;s life and career told through his own words and interviews he gave of those close to Wynette. A second was published by Wynette&#x27;s fourth child, Georgette Jones, and was titled &quot;The Three of Us&quot;. The book was focused on Georgette&#x27;s own account of being Wynette&#x27;s daughter and living her life with her father, George Jones. It was said Georgette wrote the book in response to the unfavorable portrayal of her mother in Jimmy McDonough&#x27;s book. A limited series that will focus on Wynette and Jones&#x27;s marriage began production in mid-2022. Titled &quot;George and Tammy&quot;, it features Jessica Chastain in the role of Wynette and Michael Shannon as Jones. The series is based on Georgette Jones&#x27;s memoir and aired its first of six weekly episodes on Showtime December 4, 2022.

==Illness and death==
Wynette was plagued by health problems throughout her life. Her health declined even more in the final years of her life and she began to look frailer. Nashville writer Alanna Nash recalled watching one of Wynette&#x27;s final music videos and remembered her physical condition: &quot;Tammy looked ancient, like a plant that had withered up about to die. I thought, &#x27;this woman is dying – why isn&#x27;t somebody doing something?&#x27;&quot; Wynette died on April 6, 1998, while sleeping at her Nashville, Tennessee, home. She was 55 years old. Husband George Richey and Wynette were sleeping all day on adjacent living room couches when he discovered that evening that she was dead. Her death was certified by her doctor, Wallis Marsh, who flew from Pennsylvania to make it official. He stated in his original report that Wynette died from a blood clot in her lung.

In the days following her death, performers and other industry insiders reacted to her death. &quot;She&#x27;ll always be dear to me. She&#x27;ll always be special. She&#x27;ll always live in our memories,&quot; said Dolly Parton. &quot;Tammy Wynette was an American original, and we will miss her,&quot; said Bill and Hillary Clinton. &quot;We once made a record called &quot;One of a Kind&quot;,&quot; commented producer Billy Sherrill. &quot;There are no more words. The words have all been said&quot;, he added.

A public memorial service, attended by about 1,500 people, was held at Nashville&#x27;s Ryman Auditorium on April 9, 1998. The service was televised live by cable networks CNN and The Nashville Network. Parton gave remarks and performed a specially written song, closing her performance with a chorus from &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot;. Country stars Wynonna Judd and Lorrie Morgan also performed while Merle Haggard offered his performance through a prerecorded video. Eulogies were given by other notable country artists, including Naomi Judd. A private, graveside service had been held earlier with a crypt entombment at Nashville&#x27;s Woodlawn Memorial Park.

According to her daughters, a will written by Wynette years prior had provided a trust. The specifics of the trust included money to be given to her four daughters over a period of time. The yellow legal pad which included this information (written by Wynette herself) was missing in the days following her death. Instead, Wynette&#x27;s daughters were denied their inheritance of their mother&#x27;s will by George Richey. Executive decisions were instead given to Richey and his brother, Carl Richardson. Richey received a one million dollar estate policy, along with an additional 1.4 million dollars on his own insurance policy. According to daughter Jackie, Richey was &quot;evasive&quot; when asked about the daughters&#x27; own payouts. Surprised by the will, Wynette&#x27;s daughters began to question their mother&#x27;s death.

Further detective work was conducted by local television reporter Jennifer Kraus. She discovered that a local company called Care Solutions Inc. had been delivering prescription drugs to Wynette&#x27;s home through 1998. In April 1999, Wynette&#x27;s daughters filed a wrongful death lawsuit against her doctor, Wallis Marsh, Care Solutions, and George Richey. The sisters claimed they were responsible for the country star&#x27;s demise. Furthermore, they claimed that Richey refused to take advice from Dr. Marsh. According to Dr. Marsh, he had told Richey to take Wynette to a hospital in the days leading up to her death. In 1999, Wynette&#x27;s body was exhumed and an autopsy was given. The medical examiner who performed the autopsy declared Wynette died from cardiac arrhythmia. The autopsy also revealed that Wynette had several powerful drugs in her system at the time of her death including Versed and Phenergan. Jackie Daly noted that her mother was regularly taking these drugs at the time of her death. Wynette used syringes and was later fitted with a permanent catheter into her side that allowed drugs to directly enter her bloodstream. The catheter was also used for Wynette to inject food because of her intestinal issues.

Richey was later dropped as a defendant from the suit, a court dismissed the claims against Care Solutions, and the remaining parties reached a confidential settlement with the doctor. Wynette&#x27;s remains were re-interred in the Woodlawn Cross Mausoleum at Woodlawn Memorial Park, Nashville, Tennessee.

In March 2012, the name on Wynette&#x27;s tomb was changed from &quot;Tammy Wynette&quot; to &quot;Virginia W. Richardson&quot;, her legal married name at the time of her death. Wynette&#x27;s daughters were angered by the name change. Through Facebook, they launched a petition to urge fans to help change the name of her tomb back to &quot;Tammy Wynette&quot;. More than 3,000 fans voted in support of the petition. In March 2014, the name on the tomb was changed back through a court order.

==Personal life==
===First marriage===
Wynette married Euple Byrd (who was five years her senior) when she was 17, one month before her high-school graduation. She originally intended to marry his brother, D.C., but the relationship ended when he remarried his first wife. Wynette was not yet of legal age so her mother was required to sign the marriage paperwork, but she refused and instead forced her daughter to leave the family home; her grandfather signed the papers that legalized their marriage. Byrd and Wynette fought throughout their relationship. Many of their marital conflicts stemmed from Byrd being unable to hold down a steady job. After becoming pregnant again, Wynette asked Euple to leave but he kept returning. After one argument, Wynette suffered a &quot;nervous breakdown&quot;, according to biographer Jimmy McDonough, and her family took her to a psychiatric hospital. Doctors diagnosed her with depression and gave her 12 rounds of electric shock treatment.

Upon returning from the hospital, she still insisted on filing for divorce. However, her mother disapproved and Wynette secretly moved with her children to Birmingham, Alabama. While in Birmingham, Byrd returned and Wynette agreed to give their marriage one more chance. However, their problems continued and they eventually divorced in 1965. In one of their final encounters, Wynette told Byrd her ambitions of becoming a country performer. He then replied, &quot;Dream on baby, dream on.&quot; A decade later, Byrd appeared at one of her concerts. When he asked for her autograph, she signed it, &quot;Dream on, baby. Love, Tammy&quot;. Wynette and Byrd would later see each other at family functions when he began attempting to re-establish his relationship with their three daughters. In 1996, Byrd was killed in a car crash.

===Second marriage===
Wynette met her second husband, Don Chapel, upon moving to Nashville in 1965. Chapel was a front desk attendant at the Red Anchor Motel in Nashville where Wynette was staying. The pair developed a romantic relationship through their day-to-day interactions at the motel. Chapel was also an aspiring songwriter and musician. He would later write several popular country songs, including one made commercially successful by George Jones titled &quot;When the Grass Grows Over Me&quot;. The couple married in 1967. Her growing affection for George Jones would lead to the couple&#x27;s divorce in 1968. She later claimed in her autobiography that Chapel had taken and traded nude photographs of her to other male colleagues. Chapel denied the allegations and later filed a lawsuit against her for $37 million. The couple had no children and Chapel died in 2015.

===Third marriage===

Wynette first met George Jones while on tour with him in the late sixties. Jones was also friendly with her second husband, Don Chapel, and the three often spent time together. According to Wynette, Jones helped her one evening when one of her children was hospitalized with food poisoning. The following day, Jones stopped by Chapel and Wynette&#x27;s home. Chapel was irritated with Wynette because she would not stop playing Jones&#x27;s music on their record player. Chapel then began directing derogatory words and profanity at her. Angered by Chapel&#x27;s conduct, Jones overturned the couple&#x27;s dining room table. Jones and Wynette then proceeded to confess their love for each other to Chapel. Immediately after the incident, Jones escorted Wynette and her three daughters out of the Chapel home. They never returned.

After leaving Chapel, they flew to Mexico to get a quick divorce. However, her marriage to Chapel was later annulled because she remarried quickly after her first marriage to Euple Byrd. Jones and Wynette officially wed on February 16, 1969, in Ringgold, Georgia. The couple then proceeded to move into a plantation home in Lakeland, Florida. They later built a performance venue on the property, which they titled &quot;Old Plantation Music Park&quot;.

Jones and Wynette&#x27;s marriage was tumultuous. A major factor that affected their relationship was Jones&#x27;s alcoholism. When he drank, he became difficult to control. This led to Wynette becoming angry with Jones&#x27;s behavior. For a short period, Jones stopped drinking but then relapsed. In an effort for Jones to retain sobriety, they moved from Lakeland back to Nashville in 1972. However, Jones relapsed again, which caused further friction in their marriage. She attempted to stop his drinking herself. To stop Jones from driving under the influence, Wynette began hiding his car keys. On one day, Jones could not find where Wynette had hid his keys. As a result, he took the keys to their riding lawnmower and successfully rode it into town and back to purchase alcohol.

In a separate incident, Wynette claimed in her autobiography that Jones had chased her through their home with a loaded rifle. Jones later denied this in his own autobiography. Wynette filed for divorce in 1973, but the couple ultimately reconciled. By this point, they had moved to a larger home, also located in Nashville. However, their problems continued. Jones would often disappear for days at a time. In one attempt to locate him, Wynette drove her children and two friends down to Florida but were unsuccessful in their search. After a recording session between the couple in late 1974, Jones disappeared again. Disappointed and upset, Wynette filed for divorce for a second time. It was finalized on January 8, 1975. After the divorce became public, Wynette told the press, &quot;George is one of those people that can&#x27;t tolerate happiness. If everything is right, there&#x27;s something in him that makes him destroy it.&quot;

Wynette and Jones&#x27;s relationship was dramatized in a miniseries, starring Jessica Chastain and Michael Shannon. The miniseries was created by Abe Sylvia and based on the memoir of the couple&#x27;s daughter, Georgette, and directed by John Hillcoat. It was released on Showtime, CMT and the Paramount Network.

===Short-term relationships and fourth marriage===
Following her divorce from George Jones, Wynette was romantically linked to several people. She was briefly involved with Rudy Gatlin, a brother of Larry Gatlin and then-member of her touring band. According to Joan Dew, Larry did not approve of the relationship. Additionally, the couple received negative publicity after a fire was mysteriously started at Wynette&#x27;s home. Rumors circulated that Rudy had started the fire. Amidst the publicity, their relationship ended. Wynette also dated actor Burt Reynolds during this period. The pair met while performing on a television show hosted by country artist Jerry Reed. Their relationship was temporarily kept secret but was eventually revealed by the press in 1977. The couple spent time in Florida, where Wynette owned a home. During one evening, Reynolds was taking a bath at her home when she found him unconscious. She was able to pull Reynolds out before he drowned. He was later diagnosed with having low blood sugar. Knowing that Reynolds was not ready to commit to a relationship, Wynette chose to end their romance. However, they remained friends until Wynette&#x27;s death in 1998.

Wynette then met real estate developer Michael Tomlin through her friend Nan Crofton. It was a brief courtship, as they married only weeks after meeting. The couple wed on July 18, 1976, at her Nashville home. Tomlin was known for renting private jets, drinking Dom Pérignon, and driving a Mercedes-Benz. It has since been claimed by several of Wynette&#x27;s friends that Tomlin was not truthful about his life. &quot;It was all a facade. The furniture in his office was rented&quot;, said Joan Dew. Following the couple&#x27;s honeymoon in Hawaii, Wynette claimed that Tomlin spent a lot of money and attempted to fire a gun on the beach, which scared her children. The marriage was annulled six weeks following their wedding.

===Final marriage to George Richey===

On July 6, 1978, Wynette married her fifth husband, George Richey. Richey had previously been a songwriter, music publisher, and record producer. Many of the songs Richey wrote had been recorded by George Jones, Merle Haggard, and Wynette herself. The two already had a professional relationship but a series of events in Wynette&#x27;s personal life changed their relationship. This included several instances when Richey visited Wynette while she was recovering from illnesses at the hospital. After a recording session one evening, Richey professed his love for Wynette. The pair then married. Richey then became his wife&#x27;s full-time manager. Among his first moves as manager was to fire several of Wynette&#x27;s female road crew members. &quot;I cannot start a life with and build a relationship with Tammy and her girls when I&#x27;m livin&#x27; in a female dormitory&quot;, he told a female co-worker. He also took control of her finances.

Wynette&#x27;s marriage to Richey caused friction between her loved ones. According to Wynette&#x27;s youngest daughter, Georgette Jones, Richey attempted to keep his wife away from her close friends. Georgette also claimed to have been estranged from her father (George Jones) because Richey did not want her to see him. Older daughter, Jackie Daly, claimed that Richey had helped to &quot;enable&quot; her mother&#x27;s drug addiction. Singer Lorrie Morgan believed that Richey was only interested in his new wife&#x27;s money and earnings. George Jones commented, &quot;I believe a lot of things went on that shouldn&#x27;t have went on. Let me put it that way.&quot; Wynette told the press that she loved Richey, while family and friends claimed that she regretted her decision to marry him. &quot;It was an emotionally abusive relationship,&quot; reported Georgette Jones. Nonetheless, the couple remained together until her death in 1998. Richey married Dallas Cowboys cheerleader Sheila Slaughter in 2001. Richey died in 2010 at the age of 74.

===Children===
Wynette gave birth to four daughters. Three of her children were from her first marriage to Euple Byrd. Their first child, Gwendolyn Lee, was born on April 14, 1961. Their second, Jaclyn Faye, was born on August 21, 1962. Her third, Tina Denise, was born on March 27, 1965, which was three months early and she weighed only . Four months later, she was diagnosed with spinal meningitis and kept in isolation at a hospital for 17 days. Wynette borrowed several thousand dollars from her uncle to afford the hospital bills. Tina eventually made a full recovery. In 1975, Tina would record an album with her mother and stepfather titled &quot;George &amp; Tammy &amp; Tina&quot;.

In October 1970, Wynette had her fourth daughter, Tamala Georgette Jones, her only child from her relationship with George Jones. Georgette would eventually create her own music career as an adult. She has since recorded five albums and toured internationally as a country artist. Since their mother&#x27;s death, Jaclyn and Georgette have worked to keep the legacy of their mother alive. Both daughters wrote memoirs about their mother following her death. The first was penned by Jaclyn Daly in 2000, titled &quot;Tammy Wynette: A Daughter Recalls Her Mother&#x27;s Tragic Life and Death&quot;. Georgette would also publish a memoir of her childhood with Wynette and her father in 2011, titled &quot;The Three of Us: Growing Up with Tammy and George&quot;.

===Controversies===
A series of incidents occurred over the course of Wynette&#x27;s personal life that were considered controversial. Among the most well-known was an incident in which Wynette claimed to have been kidnapped. On October 4, 1978, Wynette went shopping at Green Hills Shopping Center (now The Mall at Green Hills) in Nashville. Upon returning to her unlocked car, Wynette claimed a man was in the back seat with a gun. She was then released 80 miles away in Giles County, Tennessee, and claimed to have been suffering from neck injuries. She sought help from a local resident who brought her a cold wet rag and called Wynette&#x27;s family. Richey appeared at the scene to retrieve her.

After the alleged kidnapping, more incidents occurred that were said to have been linked to the same event. Several days later, Wynette&#x27;s youngest daughter (Georgette) was nearly abducted from school. Wynette then appeared in Columbia, South Carolina, to give a concert. Following the show, Wynette received a crumpled-up note backstage that said, &quot;I&#x27;m still around, I&#x27;ll get you.&quot; An FBI investigation occurred following these incidents that proved inconclusive and no arrests were ever made. Several rumors then began circulating about the alleged kidnapping. One rumor centered around ex-husband George Jones attempting to plot revenge on his ex-wife. Another rumor centered around Wynette using the kidnapping to cover up infidelity to Richey. Both Jackie Daly and Georgette Jones claimed the kidnapping was staged in an attempt to cover up being beaten by Richey.

During the late 1970s, a series of burglaries and break-ins occurred at Wynette&#x27;s Nashville residence. One night while she was sleeping, Wynette woke to a fire. She attempted to call the police, but her phone lines were cut. Three rooms were destroyed from the incident. Police never discovered who had started the fire, despite giving several people lie detector tests. Once again, no arrests were ever made.

In 1992, 24 years after it topped the country chart, Wynette&#x27;s signature song (&quot;Stand by Your Man&quot;) became the subject of political debate. When asked during a &quot;60 Minutes&quot; interview about her marriage to then-presidential candidate Bill Clinton (who had been accused of infidelity), Hillary Clinton said, &quot;I&#x27;m not sitting here as some little woman standing by my man like Tammy Wynette&quot;. The end of this quotation has also appeared as &quot;some little woman, standing by my man and baking cookies, like Tammy Wynette.&quot; However, the reference to cookie-baking more likely comes from an unrelated remark by Hillary Clinton: &quot;I suppose I could have stayed home and baked cookies and had teas, but what I decided to do was to fulfill my profession, which I entered before my husband was in public life.&quot; The remark received widespread media and press attention. Wynette wrote to Clinton, saying, &quot;With all that is in me, I resent your caustic remark. I believe you have offended every true country-music fan and every person who has made it on their own with no one to take them to the White House.&quot; Hillary then remarked to the press that she had no intention of speaking negatively about Wynette and that she enjoyed Wynette&#x27;s music. She then personally called Wynette and apologized to her.

===Health problems and drug addiction===
In 1970, Wynette underwent a hysterectomy following the birth of her fourth daughter. This procedure started a series of health issues that affected Wynette for the rest of her life. Following the hysterectomy, Wynette developed an infection that resulted in a continual build-up of scar tissue (also known as adhesions). The infection and hysterectomy resulted in lifelong problems with her gall bladder. The pain was so severe that Wynette started taking pain killer medication to alleviate her symptoms.

Beginning in the early seventies, she started taking Valium and regularly used it on the road before concerts. However, her adhesions continued and Wynette had a series of operations to stop them from forming. She then was being prescribed more painkillers, which caused a drug addiction starting in the seventies. Along with Valium, Wynette also was prescribed Demerol to alleviate her stomach cramps and in time began taking the drug when she was not in pain. When Demerol pills became ineffective in warding off symptoms of withdrawal, she resorted to taking Demerol by injection. Members of her road crew administered some of these injections after one of Wynette&#x27;s doctors trained them how to do so. Wynette&#x27;s doctors soon realized that she had grown addicted to the medication they had prescribed and ceased giving prescriptions. In turn, Wynette found other physicians in various locations around the United States who would unwittingly give her the same prescriptions. Some nights on the road, Wynette scheduled overnight stops of the tour bus at hospitals, where she could acquire yet more pain killers. During this period, Wynette also underwent surgeries to remove nodules on her vocal cords and a surgery for a kidney problem.

Wynette&#x27;s drug problem became public for the first time in November 1986 when she announced she would enter the Betty Ford Center for treatment. Her public appearances were then canceled until the start of 1987. Three weeks into the six-week treatment program, Wynette began having stomach pain following an afternoon meal. She was then hospitalized for an intestinal blockage. The blockage revealed that previous surgeries had caused a narrowing of the area where food left her stomach. She then had an eight-hour operation where she said 25 percent of her stomach was removed. She was then put back on the same drugs to alleviate the pain, which reinstated her addiction to painkillers.

Wynette continued abusing painkillers into the nineties. During this time, she started taking Dilaudid for pain. Wynette often carried the drug in her purse. In 1993, she entered the hospital after developing a bile duct infection. She was in critical condition because of the infection&#x27;s severity. Her blood pressure dropped and she was in a coma for several days. She later made a full recovery. In the final years of her life, Wynette was often given oxygen and IV treatments to alleviate further medical problems she developed. All the while, she continued to abuse drugs and was routinely being injected with pain medication until the end of her life.

==Artistry==
===Musical styles===
Wynette was marketed as a country artist throughout her career and considered the genre to be the roots of her musical style. While Billy Sherrill served as her producer, he imparted his style of Nashville sound, also called &quot;countrypolitan&quot;, a style of country characterized by heavy use of string sections and backing vocals. Jon Pareles of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called her &quot;the standard-bearer of an elaborately orchestrated Nashville sound.&quot; Marcus K. Dowling of CMT commented that &quot;the birth of the blend of blue-collar roots and countrypolitan flair that defined four decades of female country stars can be associated with Wynette.&quot; She also released music in country&#x27;s sub-genres honky tonk and country pop. 
Wynette&#x27;s signature recording, &quot;Stand by Your Man&quot;, was often considered to be about women remaining faithful to their husbands through difficult times. Mary A. Bufwack and Robert K. Oermann stated that the song &quot;typecast Tammy as the long-suffering housewife, forlornly putting up with abuse for the sake of love.&quot; Jon Pareles wrote in 1998 that it &quot;established Ms. Wynette in the role of a long-suffering but determinedly loyal wife, holding the family together even when her husband strayed.&quot;

The song and its concept drew criticism as well, including from the women&#x27;s liberation movement who were gaining political traction when the single was released in 1968. Many feminists criticized it for influencing housewives to view themselves as subservient to their husbands. Sherrill explained to &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; his reasons for composing it: &quot;I reworked the lyrics so the story came from the perspective of a woman singing to another woman—as if she were giving advice to a friend who was a little unsure about how to hold on to her man.&quot; &quot;All I wanted to say in the song was, &#x27;Be understanding. Be supportive&#x27;&quot;, Wynette herself later commented.

The song helped develop a sound and style that made her commercially successful in the next several years following &quot;Stand by Your Man&quot;. Number one singles such as &quot;Singing My Song&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ll See Him Through&quot;, &quot;The Ways to Love a Man&quot;, and &quot;He Loves Me All the Way&quot; followed similar themes about housewives staying faithful to their husbands. While she was often stereotyped for only recording songs about housewives, her song choices reflected various feminine perspectives. The 1967 single &quot;Your Good Girl&#x27;s Gonna Go Bad&quot; warned a husband that his wife will start behaving like the rowdy women he interacts with at the bar. In the 1982 single &quot;Another Chance&quot;, a woman chooses not to take her partner back after reassessing her life as a single woman. In her 1983 single &quot;Unwed Fathers&quot;, Wynette described the scrutiny and societal backlash faced by teenage mothers.

Wynette was also a songwriter and wrote many of her most popular recordings. She co-wrote &quot;Stand by Your Man&quot;, along with the number one singles &quot;Singing My Song&quot;, &quot;The Ways to Love a Man&quot;, &quot;We Sure Can Love Each Other&quot;, &quot;Another Lonely Song&quot;, and &quot;&#x27;Til I Can Make It on My Own&quot;.

===Voice===
Wynette had a mezzo-soprano vocal range. She was known for delivering singing performances with an emotional vulnerability that has been described as a &quot;teardrop&quot; vocal style. This delivery also helped her become billed as the &quot;Heroine of Heartbreak&quot;. Her original producer was the first to give Wynette the &quot;teardrop&quot; moniker. The Country Music Hall of Fame wrote, &quot;Her gripping, teardrop-in-every-note vocal style seemed to weep with emotion, while she elaborated on the theme that suffering ennobles a woman.&quot; Other publications described Wynette&#x27;s emotional depth in other ways. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote, &quot;Tammy could sustain power and complexity, whether whispering in your ear or shoving you up against a wall of sound.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;When the songs moved toward honky-tonk or old-fashioned weepers, Ms. Wynette did more than navigate the melody dutifully; her voice showed the emotional depth that was smothered elsewhere.&quot; In 2023, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Wynette at number 127 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.

===Influences===
Before marrying George Jones, Wynette idolized him first as a country singer. Her mother owned all of Jones&#x27;s records and Wynette was fascinated by his phrasing. She often sang his songs to pass the time while picking cotton on her family&#x27;s farm during childhood. Wynette also cited female country artists Patsy Cline and Skeeter Davis as early influences on her music. Wynette also listened to early recordings of Billie Jo Spears after discovering her music once moving to Nashville. She learned to harmonize in the recording studio by listening to Davis&#x27;s &quot;The End of the World&quot;. She cited Hank Williams as an early inspiration. She recalled listening to Williams&#x27;s records every night. Outside of country music, Wynette also was influenced by R&amp;B music. She also credited Ray Charles and the Platters as influences on her music.

==Legacy, influence and awards==

Wynette helped bring a female&#x27;s perspective to country music. Her music spoke for rural and working-class women who previously lacked representation in the genre. Wynette&#x27;s music also helped eliminate some of the male bias at country radio by expanding women into the record-buying public. Along with Patsy Cline, Loretta Lynn and Dolly Parton, Wynette elevated the popularity of female country artists. In total, Wynette had 39 singles reach the &quot;Billboard&quot; country chart while 20 topped the same chart. She has been said to have sold roughly 30 million records worldwide. Kurt Wolff of &quot;Country Music: The Rough Guide&quot; called her &quot;the most successful woman country singer of the late 1960s&quot;. &quot;Her vibrant, pleading timbre was up to the task of portraying women who have been wronged by their men, and women who are determined to stay in a relationship at any cost,&quot; he commented. Edward J. Reily of &quot;American Popular Culture Through History&quot; called Wynette &quot;one of the most successful female country vocalists of all time.&quot;

Wynette&#x27;s impact led to her being referred to by critics and fans as &quot;The First Lady of Country Music&quot;. David Don Drehle of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; described the title in 1998: &quot;Wynette&#x27;s voice – raw, broken, sad, knowing – prophesied [...] The First Lady of Country, she came to be known for her string of hurtin&#x27; hits.&quot; Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic stated that Wynette achieved the honorary title because she &quot;dominated the country charts&quot;. He also commented that both her record production and modern storylines that defined her songs also helped give her the title.

Her partnership with George Jones is considered among country music&#x27;s most iconic collaborations. Sara Kettler of &quot;Biography&quot; commented, &quot;Despite many ups and downs – including two divorce filings – the pair still recorded some of the best duets in country music history.&quot; Noah Berlatsky of &quot;The Atlantic&quot; wrote, &quot;The part-schtick, part-sincere corniness that was in different ways so integral to both of their performance styles was multiplied to extravagant levels when they sang together under [Billy] Sherrill&#x27;s auspices.&quot;

Journalist Claudia Levy of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called Wynette &quot;one of country music&#x27;s most influential singers.&quot; Her career helped influence an entire generation of female country performers, according to NPR. Faith Hill stated, &quot;Especially with the next generation developing and creating their music, I think it&#x27;s important they hear Tammy Wynette.&quot; Miranda Lambert found that Wynette&#x27;s &quot;Stand by Your Man&quot; had a double meaning that reflected both the loyalty women have towards spouses and the strength they have as women. Kellie Pickler wanted to bring awareness of her music to a new generation by recording a track titled &quot;Where&#x27;s Tammy Wynette&quot; for her 2012 album &quot;100 Proof&quot;. Reba McEntire credited her as influence and later recorded a song called &quot;Tammy Wynette Kind of Pain&quot; for her 2019 album &quot;Stronger Than the Truth&quot;. In 2021, Swedish pop band ABBA recorded a country influenced song titled “I Can Be That Woman” for their first and final album in 40 years, Voyage (ABBA album). Member Björn Ulvaeus said the song is “A little gesture to the queen of country, as far as I&#x27;m concerned: Tammy Wynette”, the lyrics prominently feature a dog named Tammy as well. Other artists who have cited Wynette as an influence include Garth Brooks, Suzy Bogguss, Rosanne Cash, Brandi Carlile, Terri Clark, Sheryl Crow, Sara Evans, Melissa Etheridge, Emmylou Harris, Elton John, Wynonna Judd, Martina McBride, Lorrie Morgan, Carly Pearce, Orville Peck, Taylor Swift, Pam Tillis, Shania Twain, Tanya Tucker, Carrie Underwood, Lee Ann Womack and Trisha Yearwood.
Wynette received a number of honors during her lifetime and posthumously. In 1991, Music City News gave Wynette the Living Legend Award. In 1996, she received the American Music Awards&#x27; &quot;Award of Merit&quot;, given to artists &quot;who have made truly exceptional contributions to the music industry&quot;. In 1993, she was inducted into the Alabama Music Hall of Fame. She also performed for several American presidents during her lifetime. This included performing for Ronald Reagan at The White House in 1983. In 1991, she performed at the Ford&#x27;s Theatre for then-President George H. W. Bush.

Posthumously, Asylum Records released a tribute album called &quot;Tammy Wynette Remembered&quot; in 1998. The project featured some of Wynette&#x27;s most popular songs re-recorded by contemporary artists from various musical genres. Also in 1998, she was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame. In 1999, &quot;Stand by Your Man&quot; was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. The song was later added to the National Recording Registry. In 1999, Wynette was included on VH1&#x27;s list of the 100 Greatest Women of Rock. In 2003, she was posthumously given the Pioneer Award from the Academy of Country Music. Country Music Television included her on its list of &quot;40 Greatest Women of Country Music&quot; in 2002. In 2009, Wynette&#x27;s contributions as a songwriter allowed for her induction into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame.

In 2010, the state of Mississippi designated a segment of Mississippi Highway 23 the Tammy Wynette Memorial Highway. The stretch of road is in Itawamba County, where Wynette was born. Also that year, the Country Music Hall of Fame opened an extended exhibit showcasing Wynette&#x27;s life and career. Titled &quot;Tammy Wynette: First Lady of Country Music&quot;, the exhibit ran from August 2010 to June 2011. In 2017, she was ranked number 16 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s 100 Greatest Country Artists of All-Time list. In 2021, her recording of &quot;Stand by Your Man&quot; was ranked as No. 473 on Rolling Stone magazine&#x27;s &quot;500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot;. Additionally, her recording of &quot;D-I-V-O-R-C-E&quot; placed at number 69 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;s 2014 list of the &quot;100 Greatest Country Songs of All Time&quot;.

Stand By Your Man plays on the soundtrack of the 1993 romantic movie Sleepless in Seattle. Tammy Wynette is posthumously mentioned by Zuri on the sitcom &quot;Jessie&quot; in the season two episode G.I. Jessie, being called &quot;the late, great country legend Tammy Wynette&quot;.

<text>Joseph Grimond, Baron Grimond, (; 29 July 1913 – 24 October 1993) was a British politician, leader of the Liberal Party for eleven years from 1956 to 1967 and again briefly on an interim basis in 1976.

Grimond was a long-term supporter of Scottish home rule; and, during his leadership, he successfully advocated for the Liberal Party to support the abolition of Britain&#x27;s nuclear arsenal.

==Early life==

Grimond was born in St Andrews, Fife, to jute manufacturer Joseph Bowman Grimond and Helen Lydia, née Richardson. He was educated at Eton College and Balliol College, Oxford. He was at school and university with, among others, cricket commentator Brian Johnston and playwright William Douglas-Home. He received a first-class honours degree in Politics, Philosophy and Economics. He later became a barrister, being admitted to the bar as a member of Middle Temple.

==Member of Parliament==

After serving as a major in World War II, he was selected by the Liberal Party to contest Orkney and Shetland, the most northerly constituency in the United Kingdom. He narrowly missed capturing the seat in 1945 but won it at the 1950 general election. The Liberals and their successors, the Liberal Democrats, have retained the seat continuously to the present day.

Grimond continued to represent the constituency until he retired from politics in 1983, and regularly polled more than 60% of the vote.

===Leader of the Liberal Party===
The party Grimond inherited from former leader Clement Davies had commanded barely 2.5% of the vote at the general election of 1955, but even that figure amounted to a modest revival in Liberal Party fortunes compared with 1951. This progress increased under the leadership of Grimond who proved himself to be a man of considerable personal charm and intelligence, with substantial gifts as public speaker and as an author. Widely respected as well as trusted, he ensured that by the time he left the leadership in 1967, the Liberals had once again become a notable political force.

It was during his tenure that the first post-war Liberal revival took place: under Grimond&#x27;s leadership, the Liberals doubled their seat tally and won historic by-elections at Torrington in 1958 (the first by-election gain by the Liberal Party for 29 years), Orpington in 1962, and Roxburgh, Selkirk and Peebles in 1965.

In 1961-2, the Liberals almost succeeded in capturing Blackpool North, West Derbyshire and Chippenham from the Conservatives and Paisley and Leicester North East from Labour. Grimond&#x27;s dynamic and principled leadership proved attractive to many young aspiring politicians, including John Pardoe and three future party leaders, David Steel, Paddy Ashdown and Sir Menzies Campbell.

In 1967, having led the party through three general elections, he made way for a younger leader, the charismatic Jeremy Thorpe. In 1976, when Thorpe was forced to resign because of a scandal, Grimond stepped in as interim leader until the election of a replacement, David Steel.

Among other posts, Grimond was a barrister and publisher in the 1930s, an army major during World War II, Secretary of the National Trust for Scotland from 1947 to 1949, and held the Rectorships of the University of Edinburgh and the University of Aberdeen and the Chancellorship of the University of Kent at Canterbury (elected in 1970). His many books include &quot;The Liberal Future&quot; (1959, credited with reinvigorating radical liberalism as a coherent modern ideology), &quot;The Liberal Challenge&quot; (1963), and &quot;Memoirs&quot; (1979). 

He was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 1983 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews.

===Retirement and death===
Upon leaving the House of Commons, he was created a life peer as Baron Grimond, of Firth in the County of Orkney on 12 October 1983. He remained devoted to his former parliamentary constituency, and was buried in Finstown on Orkney.

==Marriage and children==
In 1938, Grimond married Liberal politician Laura Bonham Carter (1918–1994). His wife was the granddaughter of the former Liberal Prime Minister H. H. Asquith, and the daughter of the influential Liberal politician and peer Violet Asquith (1887–1969) and her politician and civil servant husband, Maurice Bonham Carter. Laura Grimond was also the sister of another life peer, Mark Bonham Carter (1922–1994), who won the 1958 by-election at Torrington for the Liberal Party.
The couple had four children:
* (Joseph) Andrew Grimond (26 March 1939 – 23 March 1966), a sub-editor of &quot;The Scotsman&quot;, who lived in Edinburgh until his suicide at the age of 26.
* Grizelda &quot;Gelda&quot; (Jane) Grimond (1942–2017), who had a daughter Katherine (born 1973) by the film and stage director Tony Richardson. Her daughter, Katherine, is married to Steven Hess, and had three children as of 2017.
* John (Jasper) Grimond (born October 1946), a former foreign editor of &quot;The Economist&quot; as Johnny Grimond, now writer-at-large for the publication, who in 1973 married Kate Fleming (born 1946), eldest daughter of the writer Peter Fleming and actress Celia Johnson, and the couple have three children together. He is the main author of &quot;The Economist Style Guide&quot;.
* (Thomas) Magnus Grimond (born 13 June 1959), journalist and financial correspondent, married to travel author Laura Grimond (née Raison), and has four children.

<text>USS &quot;Vermont&quot; (BB-20), a , was the second ship of the United States Navy named after the 14th state. She was the third member of the class, which included five other ships. The &quot;Connecticut&quot;-class ships were armed with a main battery of four guns and had a top speed of . &quot;Vermont&quot; was laid down in May 1904 at the Fore River shipyard and launched in August 1905. The ship entered service with the Atlantic Fleet in March 1907.

Shortly after she entered service, &quot;Vermont&quot; joined the Great White Fleet for its circumnavigation of the globe in 1908–1909. She took part in the international Hudson–Fulton Celebration in New York in 1909 and made trips to Europe in 1910 and 1913. Thereafter, the ship became involved in interventions in several Central American countries, including the United States occupation of Veracruz during the Mexican Revolution, where two of her crew earned the Medal of Honor. During the United States&#x27; participation in World War I from April 1917 to November 1918, &quot;Vermont&quot; served as a training ship for engine room personnel. From November 1918 to June 1919, she made a series of trips to return American soldiers from Europe before being decommissioned in June 1920. She was sold for scrap in November 1923 according to the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty.

==Design==
The followed the s, but corrected some of the most significant deficiencies in the earlier design, most notably the superposed arrangement of the main and some of the secondary guns. A heavier tertiary battery of guns replaced the guns that had been used on all previous US designs. Despite the improvements, the ships were rendered obsolescent by the revolutionary British battleship , completed before most of the members of the &quot;Connecticut&quot; class.

&quot;Vermont&quot; was long overall and had a beam of and a draft of . She displaced as designed and up to at full load. The ship was powered by two-shaft triple-expansion steam engines rated at , with steam provided by twelve coal-fired Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers ducted into three funnels. The propulsion system generated a top speed of . As built, she was fitted with heavy military masts, but these were quickly replaced by lattice masts in 1909. She had a crew of 827 officers and men, though this increased to 881 and later to 896.

The ship was armed with a main battery of four 12 inch /45 Mark 5 guns in two twin gun turrets on the centerline, one forward and aft. The secondary battery consisted of eight /45 guns and twelve /45 guns. The 8-inch guns were mounted in four twin turrets amidships and the 7-inch guns were placed in casemates in the hull. For close-range defense against torpedo boats, she carried twenty /50 guns mounted in casemates along the side of the hull and twelve 3-pounder guns. She also carried four 1-pounder guns. As was standard for capital ships of the period, &quot;Vermont&quot; carried four 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes, submerged in her hull on the broadside.

&quot;Vermont&quot;″s main armored belt was thick over the magazines and the propulsion machinery spaces and elsewhere. The main battery gun turrets had thick faces, and the supporting barbettes had of armor plating. The secondary turrets had of frontal armor. The conning tower had thick sides.

==Service history==

===Construction and the Great White Fleet===
The keel for &quot;Vermont&quot; was laid down on 21 May 1904 at the Fore River Shipyard in Quincy, Massachusetts. The completed hull was launched on 31 August 1905, with the christening performed by Jennie Bell, the daughter of Charles J. Bell, the governor of the ship&#x27;s namesake state. On 4 March 1907, &quot;Vermont&quot; was commissioned into the US Navy at the Boston Navy Yard, with Captain William P. Potter as her first commanding officer. The ship then embarked on a shakedown cruise from Boston to Hampton Roads, Virginia. She then joined the 1st Division of the Atlantic Fleet for training exercises. &quot;Vermont&quot; left Hampton Roads on 30 August, bound for Provincetown. She stayed there until 5 September before returning to the Boston Navy Yard two days later for repairs that lasted until November.

On 30 November, the ship left Boston to begin preparations to join the world cruise of the Great White Fleet. The cruise of the Great White Fleet was conceived as a way to demonstrate American military power, particularly to Japan. Tensions had begun to rise between the United States and Japan after the latter&#x27;s victory in the Russo-Japanese War in 1905, particularly over racist opposition to Japanese immigration to the United States. The press in both countries began to call for war, and Roosevelt hoped to use the demonstration of naval might to deter Japanese aggression.

Her first two stops were in Rhode Island; she took on coal in Bradford before moving to Newport, where she loaded stores. She then steamed to Tompkinsville, New York, to receive her full stock of ammunition. The ship arrived in Hampton Roads on 8 December, where she joined the rest of the Great White Fleet, which was commanded by Rear Admiral Robley D. Evans. &quot;Vermont&quot; and fifteen other battleships began their voyage on 16 December. The fleet cruised south to the Caribbean and then to South America, making stops in Port of Spain, Rio de Janeiro, Punta Arenas, and Valparaíso, among other cities. After arriving in Mexico in March 1908, the fleet spent three weeks conducting gunnery practice. The fleet then resumed its voyage up the Pacific coast of the Americas, stopping in San Francisco and Seattle before crossing the Pacific to Australia, stopping in Hawaii on the way. Stops in the South Pacific included Melbourne, Sydney, and Auckland. 

After leaving Australia, the fleet turned north for the Philippines, stopping in Manila, before continuing on to Japan where a welcoming ceremony was held in Yokohama. Three weeks of exercises followed in Subic Bay in the Philippines in November. The ships passed Singapore on 6 December and entered the Indian Ocean; they coaled in Colombo before proceeding to the Suez Canal and coaling again at Port Said, Egypt. The fleet called in several Mediterranean ports before stopping in Gibraltar, where an international fleet of British, Russian, French, and Dutch warships greeted the Americans. The ships then crossed the Atlantic to return to Hampton Roads on 22 February 1909, having traveled . There, they conducted a naval review for President Theodore Roosevelt. During the cruise, Captain Potter was promoted to rear admiral and advanced to the 1st Division commander; his place as &quot;Vermont&quot;″s commander was taken by Captain Frank Friday Fletcher.

===Peacetime service, 1909–1913===
&quot;Vermont&quot; returned to the Boston Navy Yard for repairs after the ceremonies at Hampton Roads concluded; the work lasted from 9 March to 23 June. She then rejoined the fleet off Provincetown; the 1st Division made a trip to Boston for the 4th of July celebration there. Starting on 7 July, the Atlantic Fleet conducted extensive maneuvers until 4 August. &quot;Vermont&quot; then took part in gunnery training off the Virginia Capes. Additional training exercises followed through the end of the year, interrupted only by visits to New York City and to Stamford, Connecticut, for the Hudson–Fulton Celebration and Columbus Day, respectively. In late December, she was back in New York City. &quot;Vermont&quot; then steamed south to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, which she reached on 12 January 1910. Two months of exercises there followed before gunnery training off the Virginia Capes. The ship was back in Boston on 29 April for repairs that lasted until mid-July. After returning to service, she took on a contingent of Naval Militia at Boston for a cruise to Provincetown from 22 to 31 July.

&quot;Vermont&quot; then steamed to Newport before proceeding to Hampton Roads no 22 August where more target practice followed from 25 to 27 September. She and several other ships from the Atlantic Fleet then visited New York before some minor repairs were effected at the Philadelphia Navy Yard. By this time, the ship had been transferred to the 3rd Division. On 1 November, &quot;Vermont&quot; and several other ships of the Atlantic Fleet crossed the Atlantic for a visit of several western European ports, including Gravesend from 16 November to 7 December and Brest. The ships left Brest on 30 December to recross the Atlantic, bound for Cuban waters. From 13 January 1911 to 13 March, &quot;Vermont&quot; and the rest of the ships conducted maneuvers off Cuba. Further exercises followed off the Virginia Capes and in the Chesapeake Bay. A brief stop at Hampton Roads, where she carried target materials, followed on 8 April, though she left later that day for another period in the Philadelphia Navy Yard for repairs.

In mid-1911, &quot;Vermont&quot; cruised south the Gulf of Mexico, stopping first in Pensacola, Florida. She then continued to Galveston, Texas, stopping there from 7 to 12 June, before returning to Pensacola the following day. The ship returned to the Atlantic and steamed north to Bar Harbor, Maine; she was present there for the 4th of July celebrations, after which the typical routine of training with the Atlantic Fleet off Provincetown and in Cape Cod Bay followed. She remained off New England through mid-August. During this period, she visited Salem, Massachusetts, and underwent repairs at the Boston Navy Yard. Later in the year, she moved south to Tangier Sound and the Virginia Capes for gunnery experiments and target practice. From 12 September to 9 October, &quot;Vermont&quot; was in the Norfolk Navy Yard for repairs, after which she steamed to Hampton Roads before proceeding with the fleet to New York City for a Naval Review that lasted from 24 October to 2 November. After the conclusion of the review, she joined the 1st Squadron for maneuvers and then returned to Hampton Roads.

&quot;Vermont&quot; stopped in Tompkinsville on 7–8 December before continuing to the New York Navy Yard later on the 8th for periodic maintenance. On 2 January 1912, she steamed south to the Caribbean for the annual maneuvers off Cuba. She remained in Cuban waters until 9 March, when she returned to the Norfolk Navy Yard. She underwent a major overhaul there that lasted until October. On the 8th, she steamed to New York City, arriving two days later. A Naval Review followed there from 10 to 15 October, followed by maneuvers and gunnery training off the Virginia Capes through December. On 2 November, she joined the search effort for the stranded steamer , and on 13–15 December she assisted the submarine . &quot;Vermont&quot; was back in the Norfolk Navy Yard on 25 December, after which she departed for the normal winter training period in Cuban waters. While on the way, she stopped in Colón, Panama, at the entrance to the Panama Canal, which was nearing completion. She arrived in Guantanamo Bay on 19 January 1913 and remained in the area for nearly a month.

===Interventions in Central America and World War I===
On 12 February, the ship departed for Mexico, as the country was in the midst of the Mexican Revolution; &quot;Vermont&quot; was tasked with protecting American interests in Veracruz. She arrived in the port on 17 February and remained there until 29 April, when she returned to the United States. She rejoined the fleet in Hampton Roads before beginning a training cruise for midshipmen at the US Naval Academy at Annapolis on 6 June. Following the conclusion of the cruise, she operated in Block Island Sound and stopped in Newport. Starting in July, the ship&#x27;s normal overhaul at Norfolk began, with the work lasting until October. She then took part in gunnery training off the Virginia Capes. &quot;Vermont&quot; made a second trip to Europe on 25 October, this time to French Mediterranean waters. She stopped in Marseille from 8 November to 1 December and then recrossed the Atlantic. While on the voyage back, a severe storm damaged one of her propellers, which necessitated a tow back to Norfolk, where she arrived on 20 December. Repairs were effected there, which were followed by a short period of sea trials to test the propulsion system.

After their ship returned to service, &quot;Vermont&quot;″s crew began preparations to perform the normal spring target practice off the Virginia Capes, but the exercises were cancelled when the situation in Mexico worsened. &quot;Vermont&quot; steamed out of Hampton Roads on 15 April, bound for Veracruz. There, she joined her sister , the pre-dreadnought , and the dreadnoughts and . &quot;Vermont&quot; contributed twelve officers and 308 men to a landing force that occupied the city to prevent an arms shipment—aboard the steamship —from reaching the dictator Victoriano Huerta. One man from &quot;Vermont&quot; was killed and two earned the Medal of Honor: Lieutenant Julius C. Townsend, the commander of &quot;Vermont&quot;″s contingent, and Surgeon Cary DeVall Langhorne, the regimental surgeon of the Second Seaman Regiment. The ship remained in Veracruz through October, apart from a visit to Tampico from 21 September to 10 October.
After returning to the east coast of the United States in late 1914, &quot;Vermont&quot; resumed her normal routine of training cruises and exercises. The ship was temporarily placed in reserve from 1 October to 21 November 1916, though after returning to service she supported a Marine expeditionary force sent to Haiti. This duty lasted from 29 November to 5 February 1917, after which she took part in battle training in Cuban waters. &quot;Vermont&quot; arrived back in Norfolk on 29 March before proceeding to Philadelphia for maintenance on 4 April. While she was in dry dock, the United States entered World War I by declaring war on Germany. &quot;Vermont&quot;″s overhaul was completed on 26 August, and she was assigned as a training ship for engine room personnel, based at Hampton Roads. On 28 May 1918, the remains of the Chilean ambassador to the United States were brought aboard the ship. The US ambassador to Chile, Joseph Hooker Shea, came aboard the ship on 3 June, and &quot;Vermont&quot; departed Norfolk that day. She transited the Panama Canal on 10 June, stopped briefly in Tongoy, Chile, on the 24th, and arrived in Valparaiso three days later. Admiral William B. Caperton and Ambassador Shea escorted the Chilean ambassadors remains ashore.

&quot;Vermont&quot; left Valparaiso on 2 July, stopping in Callao, Peru, on the way back to the Panama Canal. After returning to the United States, she resumed her training ship duties, which lasted almost to the end of the war. On 5 November, less than a week before the Armistice with Germany ended the fighting in Europe, &quot;Vermont&quot; was sent to the Philadelphia Navy Yard for conversion into a troop transport. She began her first transport mission on 9 January 1919; she made another three trips to return American soldiers from France, with the last concluding on 20 June 1919. In the course of these voyages, she carried some 5,000 men back to the United States. On 18 July, she steamed out of Norfolk for the last time, bound for the west coast of the United States. She visited San Diego, San Pedro, Monterey, San Francisco, and Long Beach in California, and Astoria, Oregon. Her final destination was the Mare Island Navy Yard at Vallejo, California, where she arrived on 18 September. She was decommissioned there on 30 June 1920 and reclassified as BB-20 on 17 July. She remained there until 10 November 1923, when she was struck from the Naval Vessel Registry. On 30 November, she was sold for scrap and broken up under the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty.

<text>Christopher Hamill (born 19 December 1958), known professionally as Limahl ( , an anagram of Hamill), is an English pop singer. He was the lead singer of the pop group Kajagoogoo beginning in 1982, before embarking on a solo career, garnering the 1984 hit &quot;The NeverEnding Story&quot;, the theme song for the film of the same name.

==Early life==
Christopher Hamill was born on 19 December 1958 at Pemberton, Wigan, Lancashire, in North West England, to Eric and Cynthia Hamill. He has one sister and two brothers. The four children were all born by the time their mother was 22. Hamill attended Mesnes High School, Wigan, Greater Manchester before eventually enrolling at the Westcliff-on-Sea Palace Theatre Repertory Company.

==Career==
With aspirations to be an actor, Chris Hamill toured with the company in a production of &quot;Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat&quot;. In 1980, he was given a small role in an episode of the ITV police series &quot;The Gentle Touch&quot;. In 1981, he also appeared as an extra in the promotional video for Adam and the Ants&#x27; number one UK single &quot;Stand and Deliver&quot;.

He had a keen interest in music, forming a short-lived punk band called Vox Deus. Next he joined and left a band called Crossword. Later he answered an advert in the music press to join a band to be called Brooks with Mike Nolan. Chris Hamill adopted his stage name Limahl (an anagram of his surname) at the time he was recruited by the existing members of Kajagoogoo, who were then performing under the name Art Nouveau.

The four members of Art Nouveau, the band who were yet to become Kajagoogoo, had placed an advertisement in the music magazine &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, asking for a &quot;front man who could sing and look good&quot;. Hamill attended the audition and subsequently joined the band which was then, after some deliberation, renamed Kajagoogoo. Soon after he had joined, Limahl met Nick Rhodes, keyboardist of the group Duran Duran, while Limahl was working as a waiter at the Embassy Club in London. Rhodes agreed to co-produce the band&#x27;s first single, &quot;Too Shy&quot;.

Limahl later said: &quot;I met Nick Rhodes and it changed my life.&quot; Kajagoogoo signed a deal with EMI, due in part to Rhodes&#x27; involvement with the band, and the single &quot;Too Shy&quot; was released in January 1983. It went to number 1 in the UK Singles Chart and made the top 5 on the US Billboard Hot 100.

The group had further hits with &quot;Ooh to Be Ah&quot; (UK No. 7) and &quot;Hang on Now&quot; (UK No. 13), with their debut album &quot;White Feathers&quot; reaching UK No. 5. Their first major UK tour was attended by 60,000 people, and the final show at the Hammersmith Odeon in London was recorded and released on home video/Laserdisc (the 16-track &quot;White Feathers Tour&quot;).

In mid-1983, soon after the end of the &quot;White Feathers&quot; concert tour, the four other members of the band agreed that Limahl should be fired. As recounted years later by Nick Beggs and other Kajagoogoo members on the VH-1 program &quot;Bands Reunited&quot;, the actual firing of Limahl was done by their manager, and the band learned that it had been done over the telephone. Limahl was quoted in the press as saying: &quot;I&#x27;ve been betrayed!&quot;, and &quot;I was sacked for making them a success.&quot;

Limahl later said: &quot;I was in utter disbelief but the overwhelming emotion was anger, mainly towards the manager at first, but later, as I mulled over the &#x27;betrayal&#x27;, I was especially angry at my four professional colleagues, who I had viewed not only as friends but almost as family.&quot; The band stated Limahl had become difficult to work with as they didn&#x27;t share his vision for the band&#x27;s future. Soon after Limahl&#x27;s departure, bassist Nick Beggs commented: &quot;It was a business decision and not one we took lightly. He wanted the band to go in a different direction to the rest of us. Eventually, we realised we were on a different planet to Limahl.&quot; Beggs also stated the band harboured no ill will towards Limahl, and blamed the press for sensationalising the matter. Guitarist Steve Askew commented: &quot;At first ... we did everything possible to make Limahl feel like part of the furniture, but, you know, his lifestyle is so different from ours. We&#x27;re very normal people whereas Limahl likes the bright lights.&quot;

==Solo career==
After leaving the band, Limahl launched a solo career, achieving hits with &quot;Only for Love&quot; (UK No. 16) in 1983, and with &quot;The NeverEnding Story&quot; (UK No. 4) in 1984. The latter was the title theme from the film &quot;The NeverEnding Story&quot;, composed by Giorgio Moroder. The English version featured backing vocals by Beth Andersen. The single reached the Top 5 in several countries and was number one in Spain, Sweden, and Norway.

His debut album, 1984&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Suppose...&quot;, was a commercial failure in the UK, peaking at No. 63. It was better received in continental Europe, where it topped the Norwegian album chart and reached the Top 10 in Austria, Sweden and Switzerland.

Following this, Limahl released two more albums: &quot;Colour All My Days&quot; in 1986 and &quot;Love Is Blind&quot; in 1992, both of which failed to chart in the UK but found moderate success in Italy, Spain, and Germany.

In 1988, he was signed to Arista Records by Clive Davis in New York City. Six songs were recorded at a cost of $250,000, but Davis dropped Limahl from the label soon afterward.

Limahl, with the hairstyle he sported circa 1984, was illustrator Arthur Adams&#x27;s inspiration for the look of the Marvel Comics X-Men character Longshot.

==2003–present==

In late 2003, Limahl briefly reunited with the other members of Kajagoogoo for the VH1 special &quot;Bands Reunited&quot; (which aired in 2004), but this did not lead to a permanent reunion. Also in 2004, Limahl took part in the musical reality show &quot;Comeback&quot; on German TV channel Pro7. A year later, in 2005, he appeared in a similar UK show, &quot;Hit Me Baby One More Time&quot; on ITV. The episode in which Limahl appeared also featured Howard Jones, who had enlisted the services of Kajagoogoo bass player Nick Beggs to support him during his own performance.

Limahl eventually reunited with Kajagoogoo again in 2008. Now reformed in their original five-piece line-up, the band took part in various music festivals in Europe.

In 2011, the band released a new track, &quot;Death-Defying Headlines&quot;, as a digital single. Limahl as a solo artist released a new single in 2012 called &quot;1983&quot;, co-written/produced with Norwegians Tommy Olsen, Rune Maurtvedt, and Stig Antonsen. The track was released worldwide by Dig Music (Norway) on 10 January 2012.

In November 2012, Limahl appeared on ITV&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot; He came in as a late-entrant contestant alongside Rosemary Shrager.

Limahl continued to perform mostly 1980s retro based shows, often performing as part of multi-act tours. In 2016, Limahl appeared as part of the Billboard Tour playing to audiences in Osaka and Tokyo, Japan. He featured as part of the successful Totally 80s Tour of Australia in July 2016, playing to audiences in Melbourne, Sydney, and Adelaide. In July and August 2018, he played his first shows in America as part of the Retro Futura Tour.

In July 2019, the song &quot;The NeverEnding Story&quot; recorded a sudden 2,063% increase in on-demand streams from 88,000 in the week ending 4 July to 1.91 million in the week ending 11 July after actors Gaten Matarazzo and Gabriella Pizzolo performed an a cappella duet of the track in the final episode of season three of Netflix series Stranger Things. In November 2019, Limahl and Kajagoogoo were featured in two episodes of season 9 of American Horror Story. On 5 June 2020, Limahl released the single &quot;Still in Love,&quot; which was his first single released since 2012. This was followed by &quot;One Wish for Christmas&quot; in November. On 28 November 2020, he appeared as a guest on a late-night Channel 5 entertainment show called &quot;Jane McDonald Sings the Movies&quot;.

==Personal life==
Hamill is gay, but remains private about his personal life. He has been with his civil partner, Steve Evans, since 1994.

<doc id="205899" wikidata="Q592940" url="?curid=205899" title="Radula">
<text>The radula (; : radulae or radulas) is an anatomical structure used by mollusks for feeding, sometimes compared to a tongue. It is a minutely toothed, chitinous ribbon, which is typically used for scraping or cutting food before the food enters the esophagus. The radula is unique to the mollusks, and is found in every class of mollusk except the bivalves, which instead use cilia, waving filaments that bring minute organisms to the mouth.

Within the gastropods, the radula is used in feeding by both herbivorous and carnivorous snails and slugs. The arrangement of teeth (denticles) on the radular ribbon varies considerably from one group to another.

In most of the more ancient lineages of gastropods, the radula is used to graze, by scraping diatoms and other microscopic algae off rock surfaces and other substrates.

Predatory marine snails such as the Naticidae use the radula plus an acidic secretion to bore through the shell of other mollusks. Other predatory marine snails, such as the Conidae, use a specialized radular tooth as a poisoned harpoon. Predatory pulmonate land slugs, such as the ghost slug, use elongated razor-sharp teeth on the radula to seize and devour earthworms. Predatory cephalopods, such as squid, use the radula for cutting prey.

The introduction of the term &quot;radula&quot; (Latin, &quot;little scraper&quot;) is usually attributed to Alexander von Middendorff in 1847.

==Components==
A typical radula comprises a number of bilaterally-symmetrical self-similar rows of teeth rooted in a radular membrane in the floor of their mouth cavity. Some species have teeth that bend with the membrane as it moves over the odontophore, whereas in other species, the teeth are firmly rooted in place, and the entire radular structure moves as one entity.

===Radular membrane===
The elastic, delicate radular membrane may be a single tongue, or may split into two (bipartite).

===Hyaline shield===
See Hyaline shield for more details.

===Odontophore===
The odontophore is the eversible, fleshy tongue underlying the radular membrane. It controls the organ&#x27;s protrusion and return. It can be likened to a pulley wheel over which the radular &#x27;string&#x27; is pulled.

===Flexibility===
The radular teeth can generally bend in a sideways direction. In the patellogastropods, though, the teeth lost this ability and became fixed.

===Teeth===
The radula comprises multiple, identical (or near-enough) rows of teeth, fine, flat, or spiney out-growths; often, each tooth in a row (along with its symmetric partner) will have a unique morphology.

Each tooth can be divided into three sections: a base, a shaft, and a cusp. In radulae that just sweep, rather than rasp, the underlying substrate, the shaft and cusp are often continuous and cannot be differentiated.

The teeth often tesselate with their neighbours, and this interlocking serves to make it more difficult to remove them from the radular ribbon.

==Radula formulae==

The number, shape, and specialized arrangement of molluskan teeth in each transverse row is consistent on a radula, and the different patterns can be used as a diagnostic characteristic to identify the species in many cases.

Each row of radular teeth consists of
* One central or median tooth (or rachidian tooth, rachis tooth)
* On each side: one or more lateral teeth
* And then beyond that: one or more marginal teeth.

This arrangement is expressed in a radular tooth formula, with the following abbreviations :
* R : designates the central tooth or the rachis tooth (in case of lack of central tooth : the zero sign 0)
* the lateral teeth on each side are expressed by a specific number or D, in case the outer lateral tooth is dominant.
* the marginal teeth are designated by a specific number or, in case they are in a very large numbers, the infinity symbol ∞

This can be expressed in a typical formula such as:

3 + D + 2 + R + 2 + D + 3

This formula means: Across the radula there are 3 marginal teeth, 1 dominant lateral tooth, 2 lateral teeth, and one central tooth.

Another formula for describing radulae omits the use of letters and simply gives a sequence of numbers in the order marginal-lateral-rachidian-lateral-marginal, thus:

1-1-1-1-1

This particular formula, which is common to the scaphopods, means one marginal tooth, one lateral tooth, one rachidian tooth, one lateral tooth, and one marginal tooth across the ribbon.

==Morphology==
The morphology of the radula is related to diet. However, it is not fixed per species; some mollusks can adapt the form of their radular teeth according to which food sources are abundant.

Pointed teeth are best suited to grazing on algal tissue, whereas blunt teeth are preferable if feeding habits entail scraping epiphytes from surfaces.

==Use==

The radula is used in two main ways: either as a rake, generally to comb up microscopic, filamentous algae from a surface; or as a rasp, to feed directly on a plant.
The rhipidoglossan (see below) and, to a lesser extent, the taenigloissan radular types are suited to less strenuous modes of feeding, brushing up smaller algae or feeding on soft forms; mollusks with such radulae are rarely able to feed on leathery or coralline algae. On the other hand, the docoglossan gastropod radula allows a very similar diet to the polyplacophora, feeding primarily on these resistant algae, although microalgae are also consumed by species with these radular types.

The sacoglossans (sea slugs) form an interesting anomaly in that their radula comprises a single row; they feed by sucking on cell contents, rather than rasping at tissue, and most species feed on a single genus or species of alga. Here, the shape of the radular teeth has a close match with the food substrate on which they are used. Triangular teeth are suited to diets of calcified algae, and are also present in radulae used to graze on &quot;Caulerpa&quot;; in both these cases the cell walls are predominantly composed of xylan. Sabot-shaped teeth – rods with a groove along one side – are associated with diets of crossed-fibrillar cellulose-walled algae, such as the Siphonocladaceae and Cladophorales, whereas blade-shaped teeth are more generalist.

==Early mollusks==
The first &quot;bona fide&quot; radula dates to the Early Cambrian, although trace fossils from the earlier Ediacaran have been suggested to have been made by the radula of the organism &quot;Kimberella&quot;.

A so-called radula from the early Cambrian was discovered in 1974, this one preserved with fragments of the mineral ilmenite suspended in a quartz matrix, and showing similarities to the radula of the modern cephalopod &quot;Sepia&quot;. However, this was since re-interpreted as &quot;Salterella&quot;. [/&quot;Volborthella&quot;?]

Based on the bipartite nature of the radular dentition pattern in solenogasters, larval gastropods and larval polyplacophora, it has been postulated that the ancestral mollusk bore a bipartite radula (although the radular membrane may not have been bipartite).

==In chitons==
Each row of the polyplacophoran radula has two mineralized teeth used to abrade the substrate, and two longer teeth that sweep up any debris. The other 13 teeth on each row do not appear to be involved in feeding.

The teeth of &quot;Chaetopleura apiculata&quot; comprise fibres surrounded by magnetite, sodium and magnesium.

== In gastropods ==

===Anatomy and method of functioning===
The mouth of the gastropods is located below the anterior part of the mollusk. It opens into a pocket-like buccal cavity, containing the radular sac, an evaginated pocket in the posterior wall of this cavity.

The radula apparatus consists of two parts :
* the cartilaginous base (the odontophore), with the odontophore protractor muscle, the radula protractor muscle and the radula retractor muscle.
* the radula itself, with its longitudinal rows of chitinous and recurved teeth, the cuticula.

The odontophore is movable and protractible, and the radula itself is movable over the odontophore. Through this action the radular teeth are being erected. The tip of the odontophore then scrapes the surface, while the teeth cut and scoop up the food and convey the particles through the esophagus to the digestive tract.

In a flexoglossate radula (the primitive condition), the teeth flex outwards to the sides as they round the tip of the odontophore, before flexing back inwards. In the derived stereoglossate condition, the teeth do not flex.

These actions continually wear down the frontal teeth. New teeth are continuously formed at the posterior end of the buccal cavity in the radular sac. They are slowly brought forward to the tip by a slow forward movement of the ribbon, to be replaced in their turn when they are worn out.

Teeth-production is rapid (some species produce up to five rows per day). The radular teeth are produced by odontoblasts, cells in the radular sac.

The number of teeth present depends on the species of mollusk and may number more than 100000. Large numbers of teeth in a row (actually v-shaped on the ribbon in many species) is presumed to be a more primitive condition, but this may not always be true.

The greatest number of teeth per row is found in &quot;Pleurotomaria&quot; (deep water gastropods in an ancient lineage) which has over 200 teeth per row (Hyman, 1967).

The shape and arrangement of the radular teeth is an adaptation to the feeding regimen of the species.

The teeth of the radula are lubricated by the mucus of the salivary gland, just above the radula. Food particles are trapped into this sticky mucus, smoothing the progress of food into the esophagus.

Certain gastropods use their radular teeth to hunt other gastropods and bivalve mollusks, scraping away the soft parts for ingestion. Cone shells have a single radular tooth, that can be thrust like a harpoon into its prey, releasing a neurotoxin.

====Seven basic types====

* The docoglossan or stereoglossan radula: in each row there is one usually small central tooth, flanked by 1–3 laterals (with the outer one dominant) and a few (3 at the most) hooked marginals. The central tooth may even be absent. The teeth are fixed in a stiff position on the radular ribbon. This is the most primitive radular type, and we could assume it represents the plesiomorphic condition i.e., the primitive character state, that is taken from an ancestor without change, such as would be possessed by the earliest mollusks (Eogastropoda, also Polyplacophora; limpet families Patellidae, Lottiidae, Lepetidae). The radula operates like a chain of &#x27;shovels&#x27;, and the rigid structure operates like a rasp, scraping at hardened macroalgae. Accordingly, docoglossan radulae are often hardened by biomineralization. Spaces between the teeth make the radula ill-suited to collecting microalgae.
** Formula: 3 + D + 2 + R + 2 + D + 3
** Or: 3 + D + 2 + 0 + 2 + D + 3
* Rhipidoglossan radula: a large central and symmetrical tooth, flanked on each side by several (usually five) lateral teeth and numerous closely packed flabellate marginals, called &quot;uncini&quot; (typical examples: Vetigastropoda, Neritomorpha). This already marks an improvement over the simple docoglossan state. These radulae generally operate like &#x27;brooms&#x27;, brushing up loose microalgae.
** Formula: ∞ + 5 + R + 5 + ∞
** In case of a dominant lateral tooth: ∞ + D + 4 + R + 4 + D + ∞
* Hystrichoglossan radula: each row with lamellate and hooked lateral teeth and hundreds of uniform marginal teeth that are tufted at their ends (typical example : Pleurotomariidae).
** The radular formula of, for example, &quot;Pleurotomaria&quot; (&quot;Entemnotrochus&quot;) &quot;rumphii&quot; is : ∞. 14. 27. 1. 27. 14. ∞
* Taenioglossan radula: seven teeth in each row: one middle tooth, flanked on each side by one lateral and two marginal teeth (characteristic of the majority of the Caenogastropoda). These operate like &#x27;rakes&#x27;, scraping algae and gathering the resultant detritus.
** Formula : 2 + 1 + R + 1 + 2
* Ptenoglossan radula: rows with no central tooth but a series of several uniform, pointed marginal teeth (typical example : Epitonioidea).
** Formula : n + 0 + n
* Stenoglossan or rachiglossan radula: each row has one central tooth and one lateral tooth on each side (or no lateral teeth in some cases) (most Neogastropoda).
** Formula : 1 + R + 1
** Or : 0 + R + 0
* Toxoglossan radula: The middle teeth are very small or completely absent. Each row has only two teeth of which only one is in use at a time. These grooved teeth are very long and pointed, with venom channels (neurotoxins) and barbs, and are not firmly fixed to the basal plate. The teeth can therefore be individually transferred to the proboscis and ejected like a harpoon into the prey (typical example : Conoidea).
** formula : 1 + 0 + 1

These radular types show the evolution in the gastropods from herbivorous to carnivorous feeding patterns. Scraping algae requires many teeth, as is found in the first three types.

Carnivorous gastropods generally need fewer teeth, especially laterals and marginals. The ptenoglossan radula is situated between the two extremes and is typical for those gastropods which are adapted to a life as parasites on polyps.

===Gastropods with no radula===
The streptaxid &quot;Careoradula perelegans&quot; is the only known terrestrial gastropod which has no radula.

Some marine gastropods lack a radula. For example, all species of sea slugs in the family Tethydidae have no radula, and a clade of dorids (the Porostomata) as well as all species of the genus&quot; Clathromangelia&quot; (family Clathurellidae) likewise lack the organ. The radula has been lost a number of times in the Opisthobrancha.

== In cephalopods ==

Most cephalopods possess a radula as well as a horny chitinous beak, although the radula is reduced in octopuses and absent in &quot;Spirula&quot;.

The cephalopod radula rarely fossilizes: it has been found in around one in five ammonite genera, and is rarer still in non-ammonoid forms. Indeed, it is known from only three non-ammonoid taxa in the Palaeozoic era: &quot;Michelinoceras&quot;, &quot;Paleocadmus&quot;, and an unnamed species from the Soom Shale.
== In solenogasters ==

The solenogaster radula is akin to that of other mollusks, with regularly spaced rows of teeth produced at one end and shed at the other. The teeth within each row are similar in shape, and get larger in size towards the outer extreme. A number of teeth occur on each row; this number is usually constant but prone to small variations from row to row; indeed, it increases over time, with teeth being added to the middle of rows by addition or by the division of existing teeth.
A number of radular formulae are exhibited by this class: 1:0:1 is most common, followed by 0:1:0 and n:0:n.

==In caudofoveates==

The radula of the caudofoveate &quot;Falcidens&quot; is unlike the conchiferan radula. It has a reduced form, comprising just a single row of teeth. On each side of the apparatus, two teeth appear at the front; behind these, the third teeth fuse to form a mineralized axial plate. Bars occur posterior to this, behind which a sheath encircles the apparatus. The rear of the apparatus consists of a large plate, the &#x27;radular cone&#x27;. The unusual form of the radula is accompanied by an unusual purpose: rather than rasping substrates, &quot;Falcidens&quot; uses its teeth as pincers to grasp prey items.

<text>Frederick Stanley McGriff (born October 31, 1963) is an American former first baseman in Major League Baseball (MLB) who played for six teams from 1986 through 2004. Nicknamed &quot;Crime Dog&quot;, a word play on McGruff the Crime Dog, he was one of the most consistently productive power hitters of the 1990s. McGriff posted over 80 runs batted in (RBI) every year from 1988 through 2002, and became the first player since the dead-ball era to lead both leagues in home runs — the American League (AL) in 1989 and the National League (NL) in 1992. A five-time All-Star, he was named the Most Valuable Player of the 1994 contest after his pinch-hit home run in the bottom of the ninth inning tied the score at 7–7, with the NL winning in 10 innings. McGriff finished in the top ten in voting for his league&#x27;s Most Valuable Player Award every year from 1989 through 1994, during which time he led the major leagues in home runs.

After spending the first third of his career with the Toronto Blue Jays and San Diego Padres, McGriff became a major component in the Atlanta Braves&#x27; long run of division champions, posting over 90 RBI for five straight years after joining the club in a midseason 1993 trade, and helped lead the team to the 1995 World Series title over the Cleveland Indians. In 50 career postseason games, McGriff batted .303 with 10 home runs and 37 RBI. He then joined his hometown Tampa Bay Devil Rays when that club was established in 1998, and was the team&#x27;s main power hitter for its first four seasons, establishing various franchise records which lasted several years before being broken. He hit 20 or more home runs fifteen times, becoming the first player to hit 30 home runs with five different teams, drove in 100 runs eight times, and batted .300 four times.

McGriff&#x27;s 493 career home runs were tied for tenth in major league history among left-handed hitters when he retired, and put him only seven away from joining the 500 home run club; his 462 home runs as a first baseman ranked fourth. He also ended his career with 1,550 RBI, and a .509 slugging percentage. One of the most durable first basemen in history, he ranked third in career games at first base (2,239), ninth in assists (1,447) and third in double plays (1,775). McGriff currently works in the Braves&#x27; front office as Special Assistant to Baseball Operations. In , McGriff was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame.

==Early life==
McGriff was born in Tampa, Florida. His mother, Eliza, was a schoolteacher and his father, Earl, was an electronics repairman. As a child, he hung out at Al Lopez Field during Cincinnati Reds spring training and worked as a vendor at Tampa Stadium.

McGriff went out for the baseball team at Jefferson High School as a sophomore but was cut. He made the team the following year after undergoing a growth spurt. He was a high school teammate of Al Pardo. He first attracted the attention of professional ball clubs after hitting a long home run off of Hillsborough High School&#x27;s Dwight Gooden with scouts in attendance to watch Gooden pitch. McGriff accepted a scholarship offer to play college baseball for the Georgia Bulldogs.

==Professional career==
===Draft and minor leagues (1981–1985)===
McGriff signed with the New York Yankees after being selected in the 9th round of the 1981 amateur draft. He received a $20,000 signing bonus. In 1982, the Yankees dealt McGriff, Dave Collins and Mike Morgan to the Toronto Blue Jays for Dale Murray and Tom Dodd. The trade is now considered one of the most one-sided deals in baseball history; in 2006, Rob Neyer wrote that the trade looked particularly lopsided because it was one of the few instances that a player of McGriff&#x27;s stature was traded before getting to the majors.

At the time, the trade appeared to make some sense from the Yankees&#x27; perspective, since McGriff was blocked from first base by Don Mattingly. Nonetheless, the Yankees didn&#x27;t get nearly enough in return. Murray won only three games in three years with the Yankees, and was out of baseball by 1986. Dodd was released at the end of the season, and apart from a month with the Baltimore Orioles in 1986 spent the remainder of his career in the minors. Before McGriff became a regular major leaguer, baseball great Ted Williams took note of his power at a batting practice session during spring training. Williams was drawn to McGriff when he heard the sound of the ball leaving McGriff&#x27;s bat.

To improve his skills, McGriff also played for three seasons in the Baseball Winter League of the Dominican Republic for the teams Azucareros del Este (today Toros del Este), Leones del Escogido and Caimanes del Sur (defunct franchise), between 1984 and 1987. He won a Golden Glove in that league during the 1986-87 season and went to the league&#x27;s postseason in the 1984-85 campaign.

===Toronto Blue Jays (1986–1990)===
McGriff played two innings at first base on May 17, 1986, and the next day started his first career game as the designated hitter. His first at-bat was in the bottom of the second inning against Don Schulze, during which he hit a line drive to left field for his first career hit. McGriff played in only one more MLB game that season.

McGriff reached the majors full-time in 1987, and hit 34 home runs the next year, his first of seven consecutive seasons with over 30 homers. He emerged as the top power hitter in the American League in 1989, leading the league with 36 home runs, including the first home run hit at the SkyDome, helping the Blue Jays win the AL East division title. His power numbers remained steady in 1990, as McGriff batted .300 and established himself as a consistent producer.

===San Diego Padres (1990–1993)===
On December 5, 1990, the Blue Jays traded McGriff and Tony Fernández to the San Diego Padres in exchange for Roberto Alomar and Joe Carter.

McGriff hit .278/.396/.474 for San Diego in 1991. He made his first All-Star appearance the following year and led the NL in home runs in 1992, three years after he had accomplished the same feat in the AL.

===Atlanta Braves (1993–1997)===
On July 18, 1993, the Padres, out of contention and seeking to unload their high-priced veterans, dealt McGriff to the Atlanta Braves for prospect Vince Moore, Donnie Elliott and Melvin Nieves. McGriff hit a home run in his first game with the Braves, who acquired him to replace the struggling Sid Bream at first and to provide an offensive spark, and was a key player in the Braves&#x27; 51–19 finish to overtake the San Francisco Giants and claim first place in the National League West for a third consecutive season. He finished with a career high 37 homers and fourth place in the NL MVP voting.

In the strike-shortened 1994 season, McGriff was batting .318 and had 34 home runs when play ended in August 1994. He won the All-Star Game MVP Award that year after hitting the game-tying home run for the National League, after the NL trailed, 7–5, in the bottom of the ninth inning. McGriff was runner-up to Ken Griffey Jr. in the 1994 Home Run Derby.

McGriff remained with the Braves in 1995 and continued to be a successful cleanup hitter. He hit two home runs in the 1995 World Series en route to his only World Series championship ring.

A free agent after the 1995 season, McGriff signed a four-year contract worth $20 million with the Braves. McGriff hit .295/.365/.494 with a career-best 107 RBIs on his way to another World Series appearance in 1996. McGriff hit 22 home runs in the 1997 season. He was called out on strikes by umpire Eric Gregg on a pitch thrown by Liván Hernández during the 1997 NLCS, which was the last significant event for McGriff as a member of the Braves. The team allowed him to be picked up by the expansion Tampa Bay Devil Rays after the season.

===Tampa Bay Devil Rays (1998–2001)===
The Braves did not protect McGriff in the 1997 expansion draft after the season, and he was not selected. The Braves traded McGriff to the expansion Tampa Bay Devil Rays for a player to be named later after the draft.

McGriff batted .278 with nineteen home runs in his first season with the Devil Rays. His numbers experienced a minor renaissance in 1999 when he hit .310 with 32 home runs the following season.

===Chicago Cubs (2001–2002)===
After another solid season in 2000, McGriff got off to a good start in 2001 and was heavily pursued by the contending Chicago Cubs around the trade deadline. He waived his no-trade clause to allow himself to be dealt to Chicago on July 27, 2001, for Manny Aybar and a player to be named later. He hit .282 with twelve homers in 49 games with the Cubs, but the team did not reach the postseason.

===Los Angeles Dodgers (2003)===
McGriff had thirty home runs during a strong 2002 campaign, which earned him a one-year contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers for the 2003 season. Twenty-two homers shy of 500 for his career, the forty-year-old McGriff only hit thirteen with a .249 batting average and spent a significant amount of time on the disabled list.

===Return to the Devil Rays (2004)===
During spring training in 2004, the Devil Rays re-signed McGriff. He ended up with a .181 average and had hit just two home runs in his sporadic play from the end of May until mid-July. The Devil Rays released McGriff on July 28, 2004, seven home runs shy of 500.

McGriff worked out for the New York Yankees three days after his release from Tampa Bay but the team ultimately didn&#x27;t sign him. McGriff officially declared his retirement during spring training of 2005 when he received no calls from any teams requesting his services.

== Post-playing career ==
In January 2007, McGriff joined the Devil Rays as a special adviser. He stayed with the Rays until 2010. McGriff joined the Braves as a special assistant to the baseball operations department in 2015, working with their minor league players.

== Legacy ==

McGriff ended his career with ten seasons of at least thirty home runs. He and Gary Sheffield are the only players ever to hit at least thirty home runs in one season for five different teams, with McGriff accomplishing the feat with Toronto three times, San Diego twice, and Atlanta, Tampa Bay, and the Chicago Cubs once each. He led MLB in total home runs hit from 1989 to 1994, and hit the third-most home runs in the decade from 1988 to 1997 (after Barry Bonds and Mark McGwire). During the latter period, he was eighth in the majors in the fWAR statistic (Wins Above Replacement as calculated by FanGraphs), behind six Hall of Famers and Bonds.

As of 2019, McGriff stood as one of only 16 players to record a career .280 batting average, .375 on-base percentage, and .500 slugging percentage along with at least 490 home runs.

He became eligible for election to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 2010. In his first year of eligibility, he was named on 21.5% of the ballots cast by 10-year members of the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America (BBWAA); this fell short of the 75% requirement for induction, but surpassed the 5.0% threshold for continued eligibility on future BBWAA ballots. Over the next four elections, McGriff&#x27;s vote percentage ranged from a high of 23.9% (137 votes) in 2012 to a low of 11.7% (67 votes) in 2014. He remained eligible through 2019, when his time on the ballot expired after ten unsuccessful appearances. On his final ballot, McGriff achieved his highest vote total ever of 39.8% (169 votes), still short of the necessary 75%.

On December 4, 2022, it was announced that McGriff was unanimously elected by the Contemporary Era Committee to the Baseball Hall of Fame. McGriff and Scott Rolen were formally inducted into the Hall of Fame on July 23, 2023.

During the press conference for his acceptance into the Baseball Hall Of Fame, McGriff highlighted going to the Dominican Republic to play winter baseball just before and after his Major League debut with the Blue Jays in 1986. “It was the best thing I ever did because I got a chance to get extra at-bats. In that winter ball, they take things very seriously. And you were facing José Rijo, Mario Soto, great pitchers,&quot; he said. He went on to encourage players who are starting their careers to play there.

==Personal life==
McGriff married Veronica in 1988. The couple raised two children. McGriff lived in a custom-built home in Tampa from the mid-1990s to 2019, when it was sold.

McGriff&#x27;s father Earl died of cancer in November 1999. His mother died in 2017.

McGriff appeared in commercials for Tom Emanski&#x27;s Baseball Fundamentals training videos in 1991. The commercials ran for over a decade on ESPN, making them the longest running sports infomercial on television.

<text>Trek Bicycle Corporation is a bicycle, cycling product and electric motorcycle manufacturer and distributor under brand names Trek, Electra Bicycle Company, Bontrager, and Diamant Bikes. The company has previously manufactured bikes under the Gary Fisher, LeMond Racing Cycles, Klein, and Villiger Bikes brand names. With its headquarters in Waterloo, Wisconsin, Trek bicycles are marketed through 1,700 independently owned bicycle shops across North America, subsidiaries in Europe, Asia, South Africa, as well as distributors in 90 countries worldwide. Nearly all Trek bicycles are manufactured outside the United States, in countries including the Netherlands, Germany, Taiwan, and China.

==History==

===1976-1979 — The early years===
In December 1975, Dick Burke and Bevil Hogg established Trek Bicycle as a wholly owned subsidiary of Roth Corporation, a Milwaukee-based appliance distributor. In early 1976, with a payroll of five, Trek started manufacturing steel touring frames in Waterloo, Wisconsin, aiming at the mid to high-end market dominated by Japanese and Italian-made models. Trek built nearly 900 custom hand-brazed framesets that first year, each selling for under $200. Later that same year, Trek Bicycle was incorporated. In 1977, Penn Cycle in Richfield, Minnesota became the first Trek retailer in the world. Within three years, Trek sales approached $2,000,000 in 1979.

===1980–1984 — Trek becomes a business===
Hampered without additional manufacturing capacity, Trek sales plateaued in the late 1970s. In just a few years, Trek had outgrown its original &quot;red barn&quot; manufacturing facility—a former carpet warehouse. Recognizing the need for expansion, in 1980 Trek broke ground on a new corporate headquarters on the outskirts of Waterloo. Company co-founder Dick Burke would later recall that &quot;it wasn’t until we built the new factory that we became a business.&quot; With more factory space available, Trek expanded its manufacturing to include complete bikes. In 1981, Trek entered the steel road racing bike market, introducing the &quot;Pro&quot; line, including the 750 and 950 models, and in 1983, Trek built its first mountain bike, the 850. In 1984, Trek ventured into the aftermarket parts and accessories business, launching its Trek Components Group (TCG) department.

===1985–1991 — Technology frontier===

In 1985, borrowing technology from the aerospace industry, (and bike companies such as Alan and Vitus), Trek introduced its first bonded aluminum bike frame, the 2000. The introduction of bonded aluminum to Trek&#x27;s production line proved very problematic for a company that had built itself on hand-brazed steel frames. Manufacturing ground to a halt as Trek worked to figure out how to build bonded frames in a production environment. A year later, Trek followed up the success of the 2000 with a 3-tube carbon composite model, the 2500. Thus began Trek&#x27;s foray into carbon fiber. That same year, to keep up with rapidly growing sales, Trek added another of manufacturing space to its Waterloo headquarters. In 1988, Trek introduced &quot;Trek Wear,&quot; marking the company&#x27;s entry into the cycling apparel business. A year later, Trek expanded into foreign markets, opening subsidiary offices in the UK and in Germany. That same year, Trek introduced its Jazz brand of bicycles, a collection of entry-level and kids’ bikes designed by Trek but manufactured in Taiwan. Jazz bicycles were discontinued in 1993.

1989 was a pivotal year for Trek, marking the year that the company unveiled its first molded carbon fiber frame, the Trek 5000. The 5000 frameset (monocoque carbon frame plus bonded aluminum fork) had an advertised weight of . Designed by Trek but built by Brent Trimble, an outside manufacturer, the 5000 suffered enough quality problems that it was discontinued after just one year. But the lessons learned from the 5000 would prove to be instrumental in driving Trek to develop its own carbon manufacturing capabilities in the coming years.

In 1990, Trek developed a new category of bicycle that combined the comfort features of a mountain bike with the quick ride of a road bike: MultiTracks, Trek&#x27;s first line of hybrid bikes, were born. That same year, Trek also introduced its first line of kids’ bikes. In 1991, Trek opened its first company-owned retail store in nearby Madison, Wisconsin. In addition to showcasing a full line of Trek products, the Trek Store served as a hands-on sales training center for employees from Trek&#x27;s headquarters who lacked retail experience. The store also provided an outlet for Trek to test merchandising and marketing ideas before expanding them to its network of independent bicycle retailers.

===1992–1996 — OCLV and acquisitions===
In the early 1990s, Trek&#x27;s director of technology, Bob Read, attended an aerospace industry trade show in Salt Lake City, Utah, eventually meeting up with a closed mold tooling company called Radius Engineering. That visit convinced Read that Trek&#x27;s future success depended on building frames from carbon fiber, a material he envisioned could be used to make light, strong frames. Having lived through the troubled introduction of the 5000, Trek invested heavily in in-house carbon fiber manufacturing capabilities. In 1992, Trek unveiled its first home-grown, full-carbon framed bicycles, the 5500 and 5200, featuring OCLV Carbon frames. OCLV stands for &quot;Optimum Compaction, Low Void&quot; and refers to Trek&#x27;s proprietary process for creating carbon structures that exceed aerospace standards. Weighing only , the 5500 frame was the world&#x27;s lightest production road frame. To make room for its new OCLV manufacturing facility, Trek expanded its Waterloo headquarters again to a total of . 1992 marked another first for Trek: its first full suspension mountain bike, the 9000-series, which featured Trek&#x27;s T3C (travel is three times compression) suspension system.

In 1993, Trek introduced its first OCLV Carbon mountain bike frames, the 9800 and the 9900, which at was the world&#x27;s lightest production mountain bike frame.

In 1993, Trek also acquired Gary Fisher Mountain Bikes, named after Gary Fisher, one of the inventors of the mountain bike and one of the most popular names in off-road cycling. Fisher had founded Gary Fisher Mountain Bikes in 1983 and sold his company in 1991 to Taiwan&#x27;s Anlen company, remaining on as President. In 1992, Howie Cohen, who had previously imported Nishiki, Azuki and Kuwahara bicycles, assisted Gary Fisher with his brand — 18 months later brokering the acquisition of Fisher by Trek (in 1993).

In 1994, Trek entered the growing home fitness arena, introducing Trek Fitness Exercycles. In 1996, Trek discontinued the Exercycle line, spinning off its fitness division into an independently-owned company, renamed Vision Fitness.

In 1995, Trek introduced its full suspension Y bike, a departure from traditional bike design. The Y bike sold well, and won an &quot;Outstanding Design and Engineering Award&quot; from &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot; magazine. Also in 1995, Trek made a number of business moves in order to diversify its product offering and gain market share, acquiring Klein Bicycles, a Chehalis, WA, manufacturer of premium aluminum-framed bicycles, as well as Bontrager Cycles, a Santa Cruz, CA-based manufacturer of bicycle components and hand-built steel frames. Trek also signed a long-term licensing agreement with Greg LeMond, the 3-time Tour de France champion and the first American to win the Tour—to design, build, and distribute LeMond Racing Cycles. 1995 was also the year Trek opened a state-of-the-art assembly facility in Whitewater, Wisconsin, leaving the Waterloo location free to focus solely on frame production.

===1997–2005 — The Armstrong years and further expansion===


In 1997, Trek helped sign former world road race champion (1993) Lance Armstrong to the Trek-sponsored United States Postal Service Pro Cycling Team. Armstrong won his first Tour de France in 1999 aboard a Trek 5500, becoming the first American to win the Tour on an American team riding an American made bicycle. Armstrong went on to win a record-setting seven-consecutive Tours de France, all of them aboard Trek bicycles aside from a few early time trial stages that he rode aboard a Litespeed bike, painted and badged as a Trek.

In 1998, Trek established its Advanced Concepts Group (ACG), a collection of designers, engineers &amp; technicians dedicated to technologies development. The leading edge of Trek&#x27;s design and engineering efforts, ACG is perhaps best known for a number of products introduced and used by Lance Armstrong during his historic Tour de France wins, including the original Trek Madone (2003)—named for the Col de la Madone, a 12K climb that starts in the French town of Menton and used by Armstrong to test his fitness—and TTX time trial bike (2005). That same year, Trek opened its first European manufacturing facility, a frame and wheel assembly plant in Carlow, Ireland. The Carlow facility stayed open until late 2004, at which time Trek transferred its European production to a manufacturing facility in Hartmannsdorf, Germany.

Responding to the unique needs of female cyclists, in 2000 Trek introduced Women&#x27;s Specific Design (WSD) bicycle and accessories. WSD products are designed to fit female riders, and feature sizing and proportions appropriate for women. In October 2001, Trek introduced a custom bike program named Project One, which gave customers the opportunity to customize their Trek bike by selecting the bike&#x27;s paint scheme and component mix.

Hoping to expand into a new market segment, Trek introduced Trek Travel in December 2002, a provider of luxury cycling vacations in Europe and North America. Trek Travel operated as a wholly owned subsidiary of Trek Bicycle until January 2007, when Trek spun off its interests in the company. Despite the split, Trek and Trek Travel enjoy a close working relationship.

In 2003, Trek acquired Villiger, a Swiss bicycle company, and Diamant, the oldest bicycle company in Germany. The acquisition gave Trek a foothold in the active-leisure bicycle market, an important segment in Europe. As part of the acquisition, Trek took over ownership of the Villiger-Diamant production facility in Hartmannsdorf, Germany. Trek&#x27;s global expansion continued in 2005, when Trek expanded into the Chinese market by opening two stores in Beijing and signing deals with 20 Chinese distributors.

For the third time in its history, in 2005 Trek again expanded its worldwide headquarters in Waterloo, adding another to house its burgeoning engineering, R&amp;D, and marketing departments. As part of the expansion, Trek included an atrium exhibit to display a number of historically significant bikes from Trek&#x27;s family of brands, including one of the first mountain bikes ever built by Gary Fisher, and seven bikes used by Lance during his historic Tour de France run (one from each year, 1999–2005).

===2006–present===

In 2008, after years of behind-the-scenes support for the League of American Bicyclists and the Bikes Belong Coalition (now PeopleForBikes), Trek announced its &quot;1 World 2 Wheels&quot; bicycle advocacy campaign at its annual Trek World dealer convention in Madison, Wisconsin. Central to 1 World 2 Wheels is its &quot;Go By Bike&quot; initiative, which urges Americans to ride their bikes instead of drive their cars for trips of two miles (3 km) or less. Through 1 World 2 Wheels Trek also pledged $1,000,000 to help fund the League of American Bicyclists’ &quot;Bicycle Friendly Community&quot; program and committed $600,000 to the International Mountain Bicycling Association&#x27;s (IMBA) Trail Solutions Services. On January 6, 2014, Trek announced the acquisition of the Electra Bicycle Company.

In 2009, Trek created the Trek Women Triathlon Series. 2011, Trek sponsored three women&#x27;s triathlon series; the Trek Women Triathlon Series, the Danskin Series and the Iron Girl Series.

As from the 2014 season, Trek became the main sponsor of Pro Tour cycling team Trek Factory Racing, a continuation of its bike sponsorship of Team RadioShack and co-sponsorship of Team Leopard-Trek.

In 2017, Trek paid equal prize money to the male and female winners of the Cyclocross World Cup race hosted at their headquarters in Waterloo, Wisconsin, which was, &quot;the first time in the history of the sport that women would be paid as much as men for racing the same course at the World Cup level.&quot;

In 2021, Trek announced the release of its professional level Madone.

==2014 unified hour record==

In 2014, the UCI unified the two classifications into a single classification in line with regulations for current track pursuit bikes. Following the change in the rules, German Jens Voigt became the first rider to attempt the hour record, on 18 September 2014 at the Velodrome Suisse, Grenchen, Switzerland on a Trek bicycle. He set a new record of 51.110 km, beating the previous record set by Sosenka by 1.410 km.

==In the media==
Trek Y series bikes were used in the hit TV series &quot;Pacific Blue&quot; and outfitted with Spinergy wheels, NiteRider lights and Janned police bags making each bicycle worth $5,000.

== Production ==
In early days Trek manufactured bikes &#x27;in house&#x27; in Wisconsin and in the mid-90&#x27;s acquired the brands: Bontrager, Gary Fisher, LeMond Racing Cycles, Klein, and Villiger Bikes, bringing some of that manufacturing in-house as well. Nearly all Trek bicycles frames are currently produced in Taiwan, Cambodia and China. Some of the high-end frames made in Taiwan are painted and have parts installed in Wisconsin as per the Project One custom bike program, but no &#x27;production&#x27; Trek bikes are made in America at this time. An important supplier is the Chinese company &quot;Quest Composite Technology&quot;, which also produces frames for the German brand &quot;Canyon&quot;.

==Products==

===Eco-friendly products===
For the year 2010, Trek teamed with multiple suppliers to provide eco-friendly products. This includes brand new bikes that are economically priced and are made out of steel, it being an easier material to obtain and recycle. Also, Trek is starting to provide bike shops with funds to start recycling old tubes to be sent to Alchemy Goods in Seattle, Washington, to be made into bags, seat bags, and panniers.

===Bontrager===
Bontrager branded products include helmets, tires, wheels, handlebars, stems, seatposts, saddles, electronics and cycling shoes, water bottles, cycling clothing and other accessories. The Bontrager brand name is being phased out and replaced with Trek branded products, adding the Bontrager name to Klein, Gary Fisher and LeMond as American companies that Trek has acquired and then dissolved.

=== LeMond brand ===
The relationship between Trek and Tour-de-France winner Greg LeMond went back to at least 1995 when LeMond licensed Trek to produce LeMond branded bicycles. According to Trek, &quot;In 1999, the LeMond line was one of the fastest growing road bike brands and one of the top five largest road bike brands in the United States&quot;.

In March 2008, LeMond Cycling Inc prepared a suit against Trek, accusing it of bowing to pressure from &quot;third parties&quot; to &quot;wind down&quot; his brand through lack of distribution and promotion, especially in the European market. The complaint also says that &quot;Since 2001, Trek has systematically sought to silence Mr. LeMond&#x27;s right to make comments that constitute an informed and honest opinion on matters of legitimate public interest – the problems associated with the use of performance enhancing substances&quot;. The complaint includes examples of Trek threatening its ties with LeMond in 2001 and 2004 after he made public statements against doping, Michele Ferrari, and Lance Armstrong

Trek responded in April 2008 by suing to sever business ties with LeMond. Trek&#x27;s press release said that &quot;LeMond&#x27;s suit was characterized by Burke as containing false and irresponsible allegations&quot;. Burke also said &quot;for years, Greg LeMond has done and said things that have damaged the LeMond brand and the Trek brand as a whole&quot;. . . . &quot;His actions are inconsistent with our values—values we believe in and live everyday. And after years of trying to make it work, we are done.&quot; The suit was settled out of court in 2010. As of 2021 LeMond remains the only American Tour de France champion and was eventually awarded a congressional gold medal for his career long commitment to cycling.

<text>William Parker Potter (May 10, 1850 – June 21, 1917) was a rear admiral in the United States Navy. He served as chief of the Bureau of Navigation from July to December 1909. Potter previously commanded battleship USS &quot;Vermont&quot; and then Fourth Division, Atlantic Fleet during the voyage of Great White Fleet.

==Early career==

William P. Potter was born on May 10, 1850, in Whitehall, New York, the son of Joseph and Catharine Potter. He entered the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland, as cadet-midshipman on September 26, 1865, and graduated on June 4, 1869. He was subsequently attached to the frigate USS &quot;Sabine&quot; which conducted midshipman training cruises to European and Mediterranean ports.

Potter was promoted to ensign on July 12, 1870, and transferred to the frigate USS &quot;Franklin&quot;, the Flagship of Rear Admiral Charles S. Boggs, commander of the European Squadron. While aboard Franklin, he was promoted to the rank of master (equivalent to the present rank of lieutenant (junior grade) on July 12, 1871, and was transferred to the steamer USS &quot;Hartford&quot;, which was a part of Asiatic Squadron at the time.

Upon promotion to full lieutenant on August 9, 1874, Potter was transferred to the staff of the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland, and joined the Department of English Studies, History, and Law under Professor James R. Soley, future Assistant Secretary of the Navy as an assistant instructor.

After four years at Annapolis, Potter was ordered to the steam frigate USS &quot;Powhatan&quot; in January 1879, which served as the flagship of Rear Admiral Robert H. Wyman, commander of North Atlantic Station. Admiral Wyman later switched his flag to USS &quot;Tennessee&quot; and Potter served aboard her until September 1881, when he returned to the United States Naval Academy.

Potter then served as an instructor in the Department of Ordnance and Gunnery and remained in this capacity until early 1882, when he joined the USS &quot;Dale&quot;, which served as the training ship for cadet-midshipmen at Annapolis. In July 1882, he was appointed assistant to the commandant of midshipmen, Commander Norman von Heldreich Farquhar and was co-responsible for the cadets at the Naval Academy until June 1884.

He was subsequently ordered to the USS &quot;Lancaster&quot;, which served as the part of South Atlantic Squadron during the protection of American commerce interests in the South Atlantic. Potter returned to the Naval Academy at Annapolis in September 1887 and served again as assistant to the commandant of midshipmen, Henry Glass until June 1891.

Potter was subsequently appointed flag lieutenant to Rear Admiral Bancroft Gherardi, commander of North Atlantic Station, and served aboard his flagship USS &quot;Philadelphia&quot; until January 1895, when he began his fourth tour of duty at the Naval Academy as assistant to the superintendent and secretary of the academic board at the Naval Academy under Captain Philip H. Cooper. He later served as a head of the department of English and was promoted to lieutenant commander on June 12, 1896. He waited over twenty years for this promotion.

In September 1897, Potter was appointed an executive officer to Captain French Chadwick aboard armored cruiser USS &quot;New York&quot;, the flagship of Rear Admiral Montgomery Sicard, commander North Atlantic Station. Following the sinking of battleship USS &quot;Maine&quot; in Havana Harbor in February 1898, he was assigned to the Sampson Board&#x27;s Court of Inquiry, investigating the incident under then-Captain William T. Sampson.

The events in the Caribbean led to the outbreak of the Spanish–American War in April that year and Potter served with the armored cruiser USS &quot;New York&quot; during that conflict and took part in the final phase of the Battle of Santiago de Cuba in July 1898. He was decorated with Sampson Medal for his participation in naval battles in Cuba.

Potter was promoted to commander on September 9, 1899, and ordered to Philadelphia Navy Yard, where he assumed duty as ordnance officer under Captain Charles E. Clark. He was transferred to the command of gunboat USS &quot;Ranger&quot; in November 1901 and commanded this vessel during the protection of American national interests in the Caribbean until June 1903, when he was ordered to Washington, D.C., for special duty in the Office of Assistant Secretary of the Navy under Charles Hial Darling. While in this capacity, Potter was promoted to captain on September 13, 1904.

==Flag assignments==

In March 1905, Potter was appointed assistant chief of staff of Bureau of Navigation under Rear Admiral George A. Converse. He served in this capacity until June 1907, when he was appointed commanding officer of the newly commissioned battleship USS &quot;Vermont&quot;. He commanded the ship during the voyage around the world with the Great White Fleet and cruised south to the Caribbean and then to South America, making stops in Port of Spain, Rio de Janeiro, Punta Arenas, and Valparaíso, among other cities. After arriving in Mexico in March 1908, the fleet spent three weeks conducting gunnery practice. The fleet then resumed its voyage up the Pacific coast of the America, stopping in San Francisco and Seattle before crossing the Pacific to Australia, stopping in Hawaii on the way. Stops in the South Pacific included Melbourne, Sydney, and Auckland.

While with the Great White Fleet in the Philippines, Potter was promoted to the rank of rear admiral on October 30, 1908, and assumed command of Second Division, Atlantic Fleet. He later assumed command of the Fourth Division, Atlantic Fleet, and led it as the part of Great White Fleet and visited Colombo, Ceylon; Suez, Egypt; Gibraltar and returned to Hampton Roads, Virginia, in February 1909.

In July 1909, Potter was ordered to Washington, D.C., and assumed duty as chief of the Bureau of Navigation. While in this assignment, his principal responsibility was personnel management and also held additional duty as a member of the Army and Navy Joint Board.

Potter remained in that capacity until December that year, when he was appointed aide for personnel for Secretary of the Navy George von Lengerke Meyer. Secretary Meyer reorganizaed the Navy Department and Potter, who was considered one of the ablest of the nation&#x27;s naval command era, helped him with that task.

Potter remained in that capacity until the beginning of January 1912, when he was injured by a fall while on his way to the President William H. Taft&#x27;s reception on New Year&#x27;s Day. He was granted leave of absence of four months, which would carry him up to the date of his mandatory age retirement in May that year. Potter retired on May 10, 1912, after 42 years of active service.

Potter died of apoplexy on June 21, 1917, aged 67, at his home in Whitehall, New York. He was buried with full military honors at Arlington National Cemetery, Virginia, together with his wife Sarah W. Carter. They had a daughter.

<doc id="205912" wikidata="Q2995293" url="?curid=205912" title="Mohammad Rabbani">
<text>Mullah Mohammad Rabbani Akhund (1955 – 16 April 2001) was an Afghan politician and one of the main leaders of the Taliban movement who served as Prime Minister of Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001. He was second in power only to the supreme leader, Mullah Mohammed Omar, in the Taliban hierarchy.

Rabbani fought the Soviet Union after it invaded Afghanistan in 1979. When the Soviet Union withdrew from Afghanistan in 1989, he initially stopped fighting. He joined the Taliban in 1994. After years of civil war, he led the Taliban guerrillas in the final assault against the capital, Kabul.

He served as Prime Minister of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. There were also rumors that Mullah Rabbani and the head of the Taliban movement had serious political differences. While Rabbani and the ruling Leadership Council of Afghanistan constituted the public face of the country, the important decisions were made by Mullah Omar, who resided in the southern city of Kandahar.

==Early years==
Rabbani was born in 1955. He was from the Kakar tribe of Pashtuns. He obtained Islamic education at home in Pashmol in Kandahar Province, before participating in an Islamic seminary. The invasion of Afghanistan by the Soviet Union in 1979 put a stop to his education as he volunteered for the jihad.

His role in the civil war ended when the Soviet Army withdrew in 1989, but other members and factions of the Afghan mujahidin fought on, first against the Afghan communist government and then against each other.

It was a time of lawlessness and chaos. The communist government fell in 1992 and Afghanistan was fought over by factions of the mujahedin. Kandahar was particularly a battleground for commanders turned warlords.

Rabbani and about thirty other religious students (Taliban) decided to take the warlords on, first in the border town of Spin Boldak and then in Kandahar itself. During this period, Rabbani argued &quot;Our concern is the establishment of an Islamic system and the elimination of unrest and cruelty from our country.&quot;

==Fall of Kabul and creation of the Islamic Emirate==
When United Nations Special Envoy Mehmoud Mestiri resumed his peace parleys in Afghanistan in March 1996, he had been assured by the political leadership of the Taliban, represented by Mullah Rabbani, who also commanded the forces encircling Kabul, that the Taliban were ready for discussions with the government of President Burhanuddin Rabbani.

Originally a Taliban idea endorsed by Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and accepted on behalf of the United Front (formerly the Northern Alliance) by Burhanuddin Rabbani in early January 1998, the proposal took shape as a proposed commission of ulema, or religious scholars, to settle the Afghan conflict in the light of the shariah. However, no progress was made until, once again, Sharif intervened two months later, in March, by inviting Mullah Rabbani, now head of the Taliban shura in Kabul, to Islamabad and obtained from him an agreement in principle for the convening of a steering committee in preparation for the ulema commission.

On 9 April, the United Nations Special Envoy went to Kabul and discussed with Mullah Rabbani and other Taliban leaders how to proceed with the idea of a steering committee for preparations for an ulema meeting. With this perceived shift in the Taliban&#x27;s strategy, Mestiri had moved to Kabul to tie up other details. This would explain in large measure the Taliban&#x27;s removal of heavy weaponry from areas surrounding Kabul very recently. But no sooner had Mullah Rabbani given this assurance to the visiting UN envoy, the religious leadership based in Kandahar rejected talks with Kabul, scuttling Mestiri&#x27;s efforts and continuing the civil war.

On 26 September 1996 Taliban forces set up an interim government under Mohammed Rabbani, and Afghanistan was declared a complete Islamic emirate under Sharia law. It was Rabbani who gave the dramatic press conference from the presidential palace claiming victory.

Rabbani was the Taliban&#x27;s second most powerful man and the leader of the moderates in the organization. However, there were differences between him and Mullah Omar regarding the influence of the Arabs and the need to establish a proper consultative government mechanism. Rabbani&#x27;s power base was Jalalabad and he was not dependent on the Kandahari group for political support within the Taliban.

==Quotes about Osama Bin Laden==
He declared to the international community that his government did not support terrorism.

:We will not allow anyone to perform any terrorist acts inside or from Afghanistan against anyone. We are a free country where Osama is living as a guest. This is the reality and it is up to the world to accept it.

Mullah Rabbani noted that Osama bin Laden had taken up residence when Afghanistan was under the control of the previous regime. He also maintained that there was not sufficient evidence linking him to terrorist bombings in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam and that, at any rate, bin Laden was no longer able to carry out activities from Afghan territory.

==Decline and death==
Rabbani died in a military hospital in Rawalpindi, Pakistan, of liver cancer on 16 April 2001. According to a press release in Islamabad:

:Mullah Mohammad Rabbani was one of the main founders of the Movement and greatly contributed to peace and security in our country. His service to Islam is unforgettable. His demise is an irreparable loss.

Rabbani&#x27;s body was repatriated to the southern Afghan city of Kandahar by a UN plane, permitted to operate on humanitarian grounds despite the air embargo against the Taliban Movement. He was buried in the Taliban&#x27;s Martyr&#x27;s Cemetery in Kandahar.

Regarding him as somewhat of a moderate, members of the opposition voiced fears that hardliners within the Taliban would strengthen their hold on power following Rabbani&#x27;s death.

<doc id="205917" wikidata="Q119314" url="?curid=205917" title="North Sea Canal">
<text>The North Sea Canal () is a Dutch ship canal from Amsterdam to the North Sea at IJmuiden, constructed between 1865 and 1876 to enable seafaring vessels to reach the port of Amsterdam. This man-made channel terminates at Amsterdam in the closed-off IJ Bay, which in turn connects to the Amsterdam-Rhine Canal.

The drainage of the canal to the North Sea is done through the IJmuiden sea lock, augmented by the largest pumping station in Europe. This system is vital to the groundwater management of the Western Netherlands.

== History ==
To improve the connection between the harbour of Amsterdam and the North Sea, the North Holland Canal was built in 1824. But this long and narrow canal was quickly inadequate to handle the growing boat traffic. A few decades later it was decided to dig a new canal at the narrowest point in Holland and thereby providing the shortest route to the sea.

Digging began on 8 March 1865, at the dunes of Breesaap and lasted until 1876. Since no Dutch company was willing to take on this task, the project was awarded to an English contractor.

The North Sea Canal was built by digging a channel through the old IJ Bay and lining it with dikes, after which the remaining portions of the IJ Bay were reclaimed and turned into polders. From this bay to the sea, a new canal was dug through the dunes at Velsen. To accommodate drainage of and shipping on the tributaries of the IJ, such as the Spaarne, the Zaan, and the Nauerna Canal, nine auxiliary canals needed to be dug as well (Side Canals &quot;A&quot; to &quot;I&quot;).

A small set of locks (&#x27;) were built at the mouth in 1876 where the new town of IJmuiden (Dutch for &quot;IJ Mouth&quot;) formed. In 1896 the Middle Locks (&#x27;) were built, followed by the North Locks (&quot;) in 1929, which were Europe&#x27;s largest locks at that time.
At the eastern end of the canal, east of Amsterdam, the IJ Bay was open to the Zuiderzee until 1872 when the Oranje Locks (&quot;) were built. With the completion of these locks the North Sea Canal and IJ Bay were no longer open to the sea and a specific water level could be maintained.

The canal was dug using manual labour. The workers lived in horrid conditions, being housed in huts built from twigs, driftwood, sod, and straw, where disease, fights, and alcohol abuse were rampant.

On 1 November 1876, the North Sea Canal was officially opened by King William III of the Netherlands. Over the years the canal has been widened and deepened several times.

== Side canals ==
The North Sea Canal and the IJ have 10 side canals (in Dutch: &quot;Zijkanaal&quot;), which connect to rivers and other canals which used to flow into the former IJ Bay before its reclamation.
* &quot;Zijkanaal A&quot; – connects the harbour of Beverwijk to the North Sea Canal, also an inundation canal of the Stelling van Amsterdam.
* &quot;Zijkanaal B&quot; – connected Spaarndam to the North Sea Canal, but was cut off from it by the construction of the A9 motorway in the 1960s. It is now used for canoeing and mooring of houseboats.
* &quot;Zijkanaal C&quot; – connects the Spaarne river at Spaarndam to the North Sea Canal at Buitenhuizen, and also functions as the main drainage canal of the Rijnland water board. The A9 motorway has an operable bridge over this side canal.
* &quot;Zijkanaal D&quot; – connects the Nauerna Canal to the North Sea Canal.
* &quot;Zijkanaal E&quot; – a very short canal connecting the south end of Westzaan to the North Sea Canal.
* &quot;Zijkanaal F&quot; – connected Halfweg to the North Sea Canal, but is now mostly backfilled. A small portion remains and is used as a drainage canal.
* &quot;Zijkanaal G&quot; – connects Zaandam and the Zaan River to the North Sea Canal.
* &quot;Zijkanaal H&quot; – connects the Barndegat to the North Sea Canal.
* &quot;Zijkanaal I&quot; – connects the East Zaan Overtoom to the IJ Bay.
* &quot;Zijkanaal K&quot; – connects the harbour of Nieuwendam to the IJ Bay.

==Approach==

Vessels with a draft of more than 14 metres should use the IJgeul.

To protect access to the channel jetties were built in the sea.

In 1957 the Waterloopkundig Laboratorium began research for the best solution. The result was two jetties with 500 m difference in length between the southern and the northern one. The length of the north pier should be 1500 m to 2500 m and the south jetty of about 3000 m. This is to prevent the silting of the entrance channel and to ensure that vessels entering suffer less from the prevailing south-west and north–south flow along the coast.

==Locks==
There are four locks, of various sizes at the North Sea mouth of the canal: When the north canal lock was opened in 1929 it was the largest canal lock in the world.

==Crossings==
Railway and metro tunnels (with nearest station on the south and north bank):
*between Amsterdam Centraal station and Noorderpark metro station
*between Amsterdam Sloterdijk railway station and Zaandam railway station
*between Driehuis railway station and Beverwijk railway station

Road tunnels, from east to west:
*Zeeburger Tunnel and Zeeburger Bridge (part of the A10 motorway)
*IJ Tunnel
*Coen Tunnel (part of the A10 motorway)
*Wijker Tunnel (part of the A9 motorway)
*Velser Tunnel (part of the A22 motorway)

The most western crossing is the road over the locks. The route depends on which of the locks is closed.

Several ferries. In Amsterdam there are several across the IJ; at least one is frequent, operating 24 hours a day, free of charge.

Bicyclists may only cross the canal at the locks in IJmuiden or at the Schellingwouderbrug, a bridge in the very east of Amsterdam or via ferries. Tunnels for bicyclists still do not exist.

<doc id="205920" wikidata="Q1882443" url="?curid=205920" title="Julian Bashir">
<text>Julian Subatoi Bashir, MD is a fictional character from the television series &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;, portrayed by Alexander Siddig. Bashir is the Chief Medical Officer (CMO) of space station Deep Space Nine and the USS &quot;Defiant&quot;.

==Overview==
In first grade, Julian Bashir showed great difficulty in learning and was of below-average height and weight for his age. Shortly before his seventh birthday, his parents, Richard and Amsha Bashir, had him subjected to genetic engineering. The procedure made him mentally superior to most humans, and greatly enhanced his physical abilities. However, because human genetic engineering had been declared illegal in the United Federation of Planets except in cases of correcting serious birth defects, Bashir and his parents kept his procedure a secret throughout most of his adult life. At the age of 15, he learned of what had been done to him and began using the first name Julian, reasoning that the modifications had erased his original self from existence. To save Bashir from losing his Starfleet commission and medical license, Richard agrees to plead guilty to illegal genetic engineering and serve two years in prison (&quot;DS9&quot; episode: &quot;Doctor Bashir, I Presume?&quot;).

Bashir graduated second in his class at Starfleet Medical Academy, having intentionally missed a question on his final exam (&quot;DS9&quot;: &quot;Distant Voices&quot;). He had his choice of assignments anywhere in the fleet, and so chose &quot;Deep Space Nine&quot; for the opportunity to practice &quot;real-life frontier medicine&quot; (&quot;DS9&quot;: &quot;Emissary&quot;). He holds the rank of Lieutenant (j.g.) at the time of the series pilot, and Lieutenant from the fourth season premiere until the series finale.

Early on, his overly enthusiastic and self-important nature made some members of the crew, such as Miles O&#x27;Brien and Kira Nerys, reluctant to spend time with him. However, he eventually becomes friends with O&#x27;Brien, Jadzia Dax, and Elim Garak. Bashir flirts with Jadzia, who rejects his advances and goes on to marry Worf. After her death, Bashir joins Worf on a dangerous mission to ensure Jadzia&#x27;s soul a place in Sto-Vo-Kor.

Bashir&#x27;s closest friend is O&#x27;Brien, and they are frequently shown playing games (like darts) or visiting the holodeck for the recreation of one of several historical battles such as the Alamo or the Battle of Britain. He is also close friends with Elim Garak, with whom he often shares lunch in the Replimat.

During pre-Dominion war tensions, Bashir is kidnapped (sometime before &quot;Rapture,&quot; when new uniforms are introduced) and sent to a Dominion prison camp and replaced with a Changeling (revealed during &quot;In Purgatory&#x27;s Shadow&quot;). His replacement attempts to destroy the Bajoran sun, with the goal of wiping out Bajor, DS9, and a fleet of Federation, Klingon, and Romulan ships (&quot;By Inferno&#x27;s Light&quot;). The DS9 crew foil the plan, and the real Bashir, along with his fellow captives, shortly thereafter free themselves. The experience (and his outing as a genetically engineered person) began a slow personality change over the course of the series into a much more somber, dark character.

Later, Bashir attempts to integrate several other genetically engineered individuals into Federation culture, with mixed success (&quot;Statistical Probabilities,&quot; &quot;Chrysalis&quot;).

The covert operations group Section 31 also becomes interested in him and tries twice, unsuccessfully, to &quot;recruit&quot; him (&quot;Inquisition,&quot; &quot;Inter Arma Enim Silent Leges&quot;). Twice he was possessed by evil aliens &quot;The Passenger&quot; and &quot;Dramatis Personae&quot; and twice he was trapped and almost killed in Holodeck games: &quot;Move Along Home&quot; and &quot;Our Man Bashir&quot;.

As depicted in the series finale &quot;What You Leave Behind,&quot; Bashir remains aboard &quot;Deep Space Nine,&quot; and begins a romantic relationship with Ezri Dax.

In the Mirror Universe, the alternative Bashir is a freedom fighter in the Terran Rebellion. It is unknown whether he was ever given the genetic enhancements his counterpart was. Unlike the regular Bashir, who is friendly and personable, alternative Bashir is an angry, unkempt former slave who joins the rebellion against the Klingon/Cardassian Alliance.

In &quot;Star Trek: Lower Decks&quot; season 5, an alternate reality version of Bashir serves aboard the Section 31 &quot;Defiant&quot;-class ship &quot;Anaximander&quot; from the prime universe. Unlike the prime Bashir, this Bashir is an emergency medical hologram -- similar to the Doctor -- who is based on Bashir. Like the Doctor, he possesses a mobile emitter. An &quot;interdimensional castaway,&quot; Bashir fell in love with and married an Elim Garak from a different alternate universe that he met on the &quot;Anaximander&quot;. This version of Bashir has a brief cameo appearance in the series finale &quot;The New Next Generation,&quot; standing on the &quot;Anaximander&#x27;s&quot; bridge with Garak when the ship returns to the prime universe.

==Reception==

The character of Julian Bashir initially sparked fan criticism. Alexander Siddig expressed his enthusiasm for the fact that he, with his English accent, unusual screen name at time of casting (Siddig El Fadil), and North African heritage was a main character on a prominent television show despite being not as easily racially identifiable to audiences as many other actors and characters were on TV at the time.
* In 2016, Bashir was ranked as the 25th most important character of Starfleet within the &quot;Star Trek&quot; science fiction universe by Wired magazine.
* In 2016, SyFy ranked Bashir as the fifth best of the seven main-cast space doctors of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise.
* In 2018, CBR ranked Bashir the 16th best Starfleet character of &quot;Star Trek&quot;.
* In 2018, &quot;The Wrap&quot; placed Bashir as 15th out 39 in a ranking of main cast characters of the Star Trek franchise prior to &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot;.

==Guest appearances==
Alexander Siddig also played his role of Dr. Julian Bashir in the &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; season six episode &quot;Birthright, Part I&quot;, a season concurrent to DS9&#x27;s first season.

In 2024, he also reprised his role of Dr. Julian Bashir in Season 5 of Star Trek: Lower Decks in a cameo.

<doc id="205928" wikidata="Q965927" url="?curid=205928" title="George Moore (novelist)">
<text>George Augustus Moore (24 February 1852 – 21 January 1933) was an Irish novelist, short-story writer, poet, art critic, memoirist and dramatist. Moore came from a Roman Catholic landed family who lived at Moore Hall in Carra, County Mayo. He originally wanted to be a painter, and studied art in Paris during the 1870s. There, he befriended many of the leading French artists and writers of the day.

As a naturalistic writer, he was amongst the first English-language authors to absorb the lessons of the French realists, and was particularly influenced by the works of Émile Zola. His writings influenced James Joyce, according to the literary critic and biographer Richard Ellmann, and, although Moore&#x27;s work is sometimes seen as outside the mainstream of both Irish and British literature, he is as often regarded as the first great modern Irish novelist.

== Life ==

=== Family origins ===
George Moore&#x27;s family had lived in Moore Hall, near Lough Carra, County Mayo, for almost a century. The house was built by his paternal great-grandfather—also called George Moore—who had made his fortune as a wine merchant in Alicante. The novelist&#x27;s grandfather—another George—was a friend of Maria Edgeworth, and author of &quot;An Historical Memoir of the French Revolution&quot;. His great-uncle, John Moore, was president of the Province of Connacht in the short-lived Irish Republic of 1798 during the Irish Rebellion of 1798.

George Moore&#x27;s father, George Henry Moore, sold his stable and hunting interests during the Great Irish Famine, and from 1847 to 1857 served as an Independent Member of Parliament (MP) for Mayo in the British House of Commons. George Henry was renowned as a fair landlord, fought to uphold the rights of tenants, and was a founder of the Catholic Defence Association. His estate consisted of 5000 ha (50 km2) in Mayo, with a further 40 ha in County Roscommon.

=== Early life ===

Moore was born in Moore Hall in 1852. As a child, he enjoyed the novels of Walter Scott, which his father read to him. He spent a good deal of time outdoors with his brother, Maurice George Moore, and also became friendly with the young Willie and Oscar Wilde, who spent their summer holidays at nearby Moytura. Oscar was to later quip of Moore: &quot;He conducts his education in public&quot;.

His father had again turned his attention to horse breeding and in 1861 brought his champion horse, &quot;Croagh Patrick&quot;, to England for a successful racing season, together with his wife and nine-year-old son. For a while, George was left at Cliff&#x27;s stables until his father decided to send him to his alma mater facilitated by his winnings. Moore&#x27;s formal education started at St. Mary&#x27;s College, Oscott, a Catholic boarding school near Birmingham, where he was the youngest of 150 boys. He spent all of 1864 at home, having contracted a lung infection brought about by a breakdown in his health. His academic performance was poor while he was hungry and unhappy. In January 1865, he returned to St. Mary&#x27;s College with his brother Maurice, where he refused to study as instructed and spent time reading novels and poems. That December the principal, Spencer Northcote, wrote a report that &quot;he hardly knew what to say about George.&quot; By the summer of 1867, he was expelled for, as he wrote in 1903&#x27;s &quot;The Untilled Field&quot;, &quot;idleness and general worthlessness&quot;, and returned to Mayo. His father said that he feared about George and his brother Maurice, &quot;[that] those two redheaded boys are stupid&quot;, an observation which proved untrue for all four sons.

=== London and Paris ===

In 1868, Moore&#x27;s father was again elected MP for Mayo and the family moved to London the following year. Here, Moore senior tried, unsuccessfully, to have his son follow a career in the military though, prior to this, he attended the School of Art in the South Kensington Museum where his achievements were no better. He was freed from any burden of education when his father died in 1870. Moore, though still a minor, inherited the family estate that generated a yearly income of £3,596. He handed the estate over to his brother Maurice to manage and in 1873, on attaining his majority, moved to Paris to study art. It took him several attempts to find an artist who would accept him as a pupil. Rodolphe Julian, who had previously been a shepherd and circus masked man, took him on for 40 francs a month. At Académie Julian he met Louis Welden Hawkins who became Moore&#x27;s flatmate and whose trait, as a failed artist, shows up in Moore&#x27;s own characters. He met many of the key artists and writers of the time, including Pissarro, Degas, Renoir, Monet, Daudet, Mallarmé, Turgenev and, above all, Zola, who was to prove an influential figure in Moore&#x27;s subsequent development as a writer.

While still in Paris his first book, a collection of lyric poems called &quot;The Flowers of Passion&quot;, was self-published in 1877. The poems were derivative, and were maliciously reviewed by the critics who were offended by some of the depravities in store for moralistic readers. The book was withdrawn by Moore. He was forced to return to Ireland in 1880 to raise £3,000 to pay debts incurred on the family estate, owing to his tenants refusing to pay their rent and the drop in agricultural prices. During his time back in Mayo, he gained a reputation as a fair landlord, continuing the family tradition of not evicting tenants and refusing to carry firearms when travelling round the estate. While in Ireland, he decided to abandon art and move to London to become a professional writer. There he published his second poetry collection, &quot;Pagan Poems&quot;, in 1881. These early poems reflect his interest in French symbolism and are now almost entirely neglected. In 1886 Moore published &quot;Confessions of a Young Man&quot;, a lively memoir about his 20s spent in Paris and London among bohemian artists. It contains a substantial amount of literary criticism for which it has received a fair amount of praise, for instance The Modern Library chose it in 1917 to be included in the series as &quot;one of the most significant documents of the passionate revolt of English literature against the Victorian tradition.&quot;

=== Controversy in England ===
During the 1880s, Moore began work on a series of novels in a realist style. His first novel, &quot;A Modern Lover&quot; (1883) was a three-volume work, as preferred by the circulating libraries, and deals with the art scene of the 1870s and 1880s in which many characters are identifiably real. The circulating libraries in England banned the book because of its explicit portrayal of the amorous pursuits of its hero. At this time the British circulating libraries, such as Mudie&#x27;s Select Library, controlled the market for fiction, and the fee-paying public expected them to guarantee the morality of the novels provided. His next realist novel, &quot;A Mummers Wife&quot; (1885) was also regarded as unsuitable by Mudie&#x27;s, and W H Smith refused to stock it on their news-stalls. Despite this, during its first year of publication the book went through fourteen editions, mainly because of the publicity stirred up by its opponents. The French newspaper &quot;Le Voltaire&quot; published it in serial form as &quot;La Femme du cabotin&quot; in July–October 1886. His next novel, &quot;A Drama in Muslin&quot; was again banned by Mudie&#x27;s and Smith&#x27;s. In response Moore declared war on the circulating libraries by publishing the provocative pamphlet &quot;Literature at Nurse&quot;, &quot;or Circulating Morals,&quot; in which he complained that the libraries profit from salacious popular fiction while refusing to stock serious literary fiction.

Moore&#x27;s publisher Henry Vizetelly began to issue unabridged mass-market translations of French realist novels that endangered the moral and commercial influence of the circulating libraries around this time. In 1888, the circulating libraries fought back by encouraging the House of Commons to implement laws to stop &quot;the rapid spread of demoralising literature in this country&quot;. Vizetelly was brought to court by the National Vigilance Association (NVA) for &quot;obscene libel&quot;. The charge arose from the publication of the English translation of Zola&#x27;s &quot;La Terre&quot;. A second case was brought the following year to force implementation of the original judgement and to remove all of Zola&#x27;s works. This led to the 70-year-old publisher becoming involved in the literary cause. Throughout Moore supported the avant garde publisher, and on 22 September 1888, about a month before the trial, wrote a letter that appeared in the &quot;St. James Gazette&quot;. In it Moore suggested that, rather than a jury of twelve tradesmen&quot;,&quot; Vizatelly should be judged by three novelists. Moore pointed out that such celebrated books as &quot;Madame Bovary&quot; and Gautier&#x27;s &quot;Mademoiselle de Maupin&quot; had morals equivalent to Zola&#x27;s, though their literary merits might differ.

Because of his willingness to tackle such issues as prostitution, extramarital sex, and lesbianism, Moore&#x27;s novels were initially met with scandal, but this subsided as the public&#x27;s taste for realist fiction grew. Moore began to find success as an art critic with the publication of books such as &quot;Impressions and Opinions&quot; (1891) and &quot;Modern Painting&quot; (1893), the first significant attempt to introduce the Impressionists to an English audience. By this time Moore was first able to live from the proceeds of his literary work.

Other realist novels by Moore from this period include &quot;A Drama in Muslin&quot; (1886), a satiric story of the marriage trade in Anglo-Irish society that hints at same-sex relationships among the unmarried daughters of the gentry, and &quot;Esther Waters&quot; (1894), the story of an unmarried housemaid who becomes pregnant and is abandoned by her footman lover. Both of these books have remained almost constantly in print since their first publication. His 1887 novel &quot;A Mere Accident&quot; is an attempt to merge his symbolist and realist influences. He also published a collection of short stories: &quot;Celibates&quot; (1895).

=== Dublin and the Celtic Revival ===
In 1901, Moore returned to Dublin at the suggestion of his cousin and friend, Edward Martyn. Martyn had been involved in Ireland&#x27;s cultural and dramatic movements for some years, and was working with Lady Gregory and William Butler Yeats to establish the Irish Literary Theatre. Moore soon became deeply involved in this project and in the broader Irish Literary Revival. He had already written a play, &quot;The Strike at Arlingford&quot; (1893), which was produced by the Independent Theatre. The play was the result of a challenge between Moore and George Robert Sims over Moore&#x27;s criticism of all contemporary playwrights in &quot;Impressions and Opinions&quot;. Moore won the one hundred pound bet made by Sims for a stall to witness an &quot;unconventional&quot; play by Moore, though Moore insisted the word &quot;unconventional&quot; be excised.
The Irish Literary Theatre staged his satirical comedy &quot;The Bending of the Bough&quot; (1900), adapted from Martyn&#x27;s &quot;The Tale of a Town&quot;, originally rejected by the theatre but unselfishly given to Moore for revision, and Martyn&#x27;s &quot;Maeve&quot;. Staged by the company which would later become the Abbey Theatre, &quot;The Bending of the Bough&quot; was a historically important play and introduced realism into Irish literature. Lady Gregory wrote that it: &quot;hits impartially all round&quot;. The play was a satire on Irish political life, and as it was unexpectedly nationalist, was considered the first to deal with a vital question that had appeared in Irish life. &quot;Diarmuid and Grania&quot;, a poetic play in prose co-written with Yeats in 1901, was also staged by the theatre, with incidental music by Elgar. After this production Moore took up pamphleteering on behalf of the Abbey, and parted company with the dramatic movement.

Moore published two books of prose fiction set in Ireland around this time; a second book of short stories, &quot;The Untilled Field&quot; (1903) and a novel, &quot;The Lake&quot; (1905). &quot;The Untilled Field&quot; deals with clerical interference in the daily lives of the Irish peasantry, and of the issue of emigration. The stories were originally written for translation into Irish, to serve as models for other writers working in the language. Three of the translations were published in the &quot;New Ireland Review&quot;, but publication was then paused because of their perceived anti-clerical sentiment. In 1902 the entire collection was translated by Tadhg Ó Donnchadha and Pádraig Ó Súilleabháin, and published in a parallel-text edition by the Gaelic League as &quot;An-tÚr-Ghort&quot;. Moore later revised the texts for the English edition. These stories were influenced by Turgenev&#x27;s &quot;A Sportsman&#x27;s Sketches&quot;, a book recommended to Moore by W. K. Magee, a sub-librarian of the National Library of Ireland, who had earlier suggested that Moore &quot;was best suited to become Ireland&#x27;s Turgenev&quot;. The tales are recognised by some as representing the birth of the Irish short story as a literary genre.

In 1903, following a disagreement with his brother Maurice over the religious upbringing of his nephews, Moore declared himself to be Protestant. His conversion was announced in a letter to the &quot;Irish Times&quot; newspaper. Moore remained in Dublin until 1911. In 1914, he published &quot;Hail and Farewell&quot;, a gossipy three-volume memoir of his time there, which entertained readers but infuriated former friends. Moore quipped, &quot;Dublin is now divided into two sets; one half is afraid it will be in the book, and the other is afraid that it won&#x27;t&quot;.

In his later years he was increasingly friendless, having quarrelled bitterly with Yeats and Osborn Bergin, among others: Oliver St. John Gogarty said: &quot;It was impossible to be a friend of his, because he was incapable of gratitude&quot;.

===Later life===

Moore returned to London in 1911, where, with the exception of frequent trips to France, he was to spend much of the rest of his life. In 1913, he travelled to Jerusalem to research his next novel, &quot;The Brook Kerith&quot; (1916). Moore once again courted controversy, as the story was based on the supposition that a non-divine Christ did not die on the cross but instead was nursed back to health and repented of his pride in declaring himself Son of God. Other books from this period include a further collection of short-stories called &quot;A Storyteller&#x27;s Holiday&quot; (1918), a collection of essays called &quot;Conversations in Ebury Street&quot; (1924) and a play, &quot;The Making of an Immortal&quot; (1927). Moore also spent considerable time revising and preparing his earlier writings for new editions.

Partly because of his brother Maurice&#x27;s pro-treaty activity, Moore Hall was burnt by anti-treaty partisans in 1923, during the final months of the Irish Civil War. Moore eventually received compensation of £7,000 from the government of the Irish Free State. By this time the brothers had become estranged, mainly because of George&#x27;s unflattering portrait of Maurice in &quot;Hail and Farewell&quot;. Tension also arose from their religious differences: Maurice frequently made donations to the Roman Catholic Church from estate funds. George later sold a large part of the estate to the Irish Land Commission for £25,000.

Moore was friendly with many members of the expatriate artistic communities in London and Paris, and had a long-lasting relationship with Maud, Lady Cunard. Moore took a special interest in the education of Maud&#x27;s daughter, the well-known publisher and art patron, Nancy Cunard. It has been suggested that Moore, rather than Maud&#x27;s husband, Sir Bache Cunard, was Nancy&#x27;s father, but this is not generally credited by historians, and it is not certain that Moore&#x27;s relationship with Nancy&#x27;s mother was ever more than platonic. Moore&#x27;s last novel, &quot;Aphrodite in Aulis&quot;, was published in 1930.

He died at his address of 121 Ebury Street in the London district of Belgravia in early 1933, leaving a fortune of £70,000. He was cremated in London at a service attended by Ramsay MacDonald among others. An urn containing his ashes was interred on Castle Island in Lough Carra in view of the ruins of Moore Hall. A blue plaque commemorates his residency at his London home.

<text>The Amsterdam–Rhine Canal (Dutch: &quot;Amsterdam-Rijnkanaal&quot;) is a canal in the Netherlands that was built to connect the port and capital city of Amsterdam to the main shipping artery of the Rhine. Its course follows a generally southeasterly direction as it goes through the city of Utrecht towards Wijk bij Duurstede where it intersects the Lek branch of the Rhine and then continues on to the river Waal near Tiel, with a branch, the &quot;Lek Canal&quot;, to the Lek near Nieuwegein.
The Amsterdam-Rhine Canal is the world&#x27;s most frequented artificial waterway with an annual average of 100,000 ships.

<text>In electronics, emitter-coupled logic (ECL) is a high-speed integrated circuit bipolar transistor logic family. ECL uses an overdriven bipolar junction transistor (BJT) differential amplifier with single-ended input and limited emitter current to avoid the saturated (fully on) region of operation and the resulting slow turn-off behavior.
As the current is steered between two legs of an emitter-coupled pair, ECL is sometimes called &quot;current-steering logic&quot; (CSL),
&quot;current-mode logic&quot; (CML)
or &quot;current-switch emitter-follower&quot; (CSEF) logic.

In ECL, the transistors are never in saturation, the input and output voltages have a small swing (0.8 V), the input impedance is high and the output impedance is low. As a result, the transistors change states quickly, gate delays are low, and the fanout capability is high. In addition, the essentially constant current draw of the differential amplifiers minimizes delays and glitches due to supply-line inductance and capacitance, and the complementary outputs decrease the propagation time of the whole circuit by reducing inverter count.

ECL&#x27;s major disadvantage is that each gate continuously draws current, which means that it requires (and dissipates) significantly more power than those of other logic families, especially when quiescent.

The equivalent of emitter-coupled logic made from FETs is called source-coupled logic (SCFL).

A variation of ECL in which all signal paths and gate inputs are differential is known as differential current switch (DCS) logic.

== History ==
ECL was invented in August 1956 at IBM by Hannon S. Yourke. Originally called &quot;current-steering logic&quot;, it was used in the Stretch, IBM 7090, and IBM 7094 computers. The logic was also called a current-mode circuit. It was also used to make the IBM Advanced Solid Logic Technology (ASLT) circuits in the IBM 360/91.

Yourke&#x27;s current switch was a differential amplifier whose input logic levels were different from the output logic levels. &quot;In current mode operation, however, the output signal consists of voltage levels which vary about a reference level different from the input reference level.&quot; In Yourke&#x27;s design, the two logic reference levels differed by 3 volts. Consequently, two complementary versions were used: an NPN version and a PNP version. The NPN output could drive PNP inputs, and vice versa. &quot;The disadvantages are that more different power supply voltages are needed, and both pnp and npn transistors are required.&quot;

Instead of alternating NPN and PNP stages, another coupling method employed Zener diodes and resistors to shift the output logic levels to be the same as the input logic levels.

Beginning in the early 1960s, ECL circuits were implemented on monolithic integrated circuits and consisted of a differential-amplifier input stage to perform logic and followed by an emitter-follower stage to drive outputs and shift the output voltages so they will be compatible with the inputs. The emitter-follower output stages could also be used to perform wired-or logic.

Motorola introduced their first digital monolithic integrated circuit line, MECL I, in 1962. Motorola developed several improved series, with MECL II in 1966, MECL III in 1968 with 1-nanosecond gate propagation time and 300 MHz flip-flop toggle rates, and the 10,000 series (with lower power consumption and controlled edge speeds) in 1971.
The MECL 10H family was introduced in 1981.
Fairchild introduced the F100K family in 1975.

The ECLinPS (&quot;ECL in picoseconds&quot;) family was introduced in 1987. ECLinPS has 500 ps single-gate delay and 1.1 GHz flip-flop toggle frequency. The ECLinPS family parts are available from multiple sources, including Arizona Microtek, Micrel, National Semiconductor, and ON Semiconductor.

The high power consumption of ECL meant that it has been used mainly when high speed is a vital requirement. Older high-end mainframe computers, such as the Enterprise System/9000 members of IBM&#x27;s ESA/390 computer family, used ECL, as did the Cray-1; and first-generation Amdahl mainframes. (Current IBM mainframes use CMOS.) Beginning in 1975, Digital Equipment Corporation&#x27;s highest performance processors were all based on multi-chip ECL CPUs—from the ECL KL10 through the ECL VAX 8000 and finally the VAX 9000. By 1991, the CMOS NVAX was launched which offered comparable performance to the VAX 9000 despite costing 25 times less and consuming considerably less power. The MIPS R6000 computers also used ECL. Some of these computer designs used ECL gate arrays.

==Implementation==
ECL is based on an emitter-coupled (long-tailed) pair, shaded red in the figure on the right. The left half of the pair (shaded yellow) consists of two parallel-connected input transistors T1 and T2 (an exemplary two-input gate is considered) implementing NOR logic. The base voltage of the right transistor T3 is held fixed by a reference voltage source, shaded light green: the voltage divider with a diode thermal compensation (R1, R2, D1 and D2) and sometimes a buffering emitter follower (not shown on the picture); thus the emitter voltages are kept relatively steady. As a result, the common emitter resistor RE acts nearly as a current source. The output voltages at the collector load resistors RC1 and RC3 are shifted and buffered to the inverting and non-inverting outputs by the emitter followers T4 and T5 (shaded blue). The output emitter resistors RE4 and RE5 do not exist in all versions of ECL. In some cases 50 Ω line termination resistors connected between the bases of the input transistors and −2 V act as emitter resistors.

== Operation ==

The ECL circuit operation is considered below with assumption that the input voltage is applied to T1 base, while T2 input is unused or a logical &quot;0&quot; is applied.

During the transition, the core of the circuit – the emitter-coupled pair (T1 and T3) – acts as a differential amplifier with single-ended input. The &quot;long-tail&quot; current source (RE) sets the total current flowing through the two legs of the pair. The input voltage controls the current flowing through the transistors by sharing it between the two legs, steering it all to one side when not near the switching point. The gain is higher than at the end states (see below) and the circuit switches quickly.

At low input voltage (logical &quot;0&quot;) or at high input voltage (logical &quot;1&quot;) the differential amplifier is overdriven. The transistor (T1 or T3) is cutoff and the other (T3 or T1) is in active linear region acting as a common-emitter stage with emitter degeneration that takes all the current, starving the other cutoff transistor.&lt;br&gt;The active transistor is loaded with the relatively high emitter resistance &quot;R&quot;E that introduces a significant negative feedback (emitter degeneration). To prevent saturation of the active transistor so that the diffusion time that slows the recovery from saturation will not be involved in the logic delay, the emitter and collector resistances are chosen such that at maximum input voltage some voltage is left across the transistor. The residual gain is low (&quot;K&quot; = &quot;R&quot;C/&quot;R&quot;E &lt; 1). The circuit is insensitive to the input voltage variations and the transistor stays firmly in active linear region. The input resistance is high because of the series negative feedback.&lt;br&gt; The cutoff transistor breaks the connection between its input and output. As a result, its input voltage does not affect the output voltage. The input resistance is high again since the base-emitter junction is cutoff.

== Characteristics ==

Other noteworthy characteristics of the ECL family include the fact that the large current requirement is approximately constant, and does not depend significantly on the state of the circuit. This means that ECL circuits generate relatively little power noise, unlike other logic types which draw more current when switching than quiescent. In cryptographic applications, ECL circuits are also less susceptible to side channel attacks such as differential power analysis.

The propagation time for this arrangement can be less than a nanosecond, including the signal delay getting on and off the IC package. Some type of ECL has always been the fastest logic family.

Radiation hardening: While normal commercial-grade chips can withstand 100 gray (10 krad), many ECL devices are operational after 100,000 gray (10 Mrad).

== Power supplies and logic levels ==

ECL circuits usually operate with negative power supplies (positive end of the supply is connected to ground). Other logic families ground the negative end of the power supply. This is done mainly to minimize the influence of the power supply variations on the logic levels. ECL is more sensitive to noise on the VCC and is relatively immune to noise on VEE. Because ground should be the most stable voltage in a system, ECL is specified with a positive ground. In this connection, when the supply voltage varies, the voltage drops across the collector resistors change slightly (in the case of emitter constant current source, they do not change at all). As the collector resistors are firmly &quot;tied up&quot; to ground, the output voltages &quot;move&quot; slightly (or not at all). If the negative end of the power supply was grounded, the collector resistors would be attached to the positive rail. As the constant voltage drops across the collector resistors change slightly (or not at all), the output voltages follow the supply voltage variations and the two circuit parts act as constant current level shifters. In this case, the voltage divider R1-R2 compensates the voltage variations to some extent. The positive power supply has another disadvantage — the output voltages will vary slightly (±0.4 V) against the background of high constant voltage (+3.9 V). Another reason for using a negative power supply is protection of the output transistors from an accidental short circuit developing between output and ground (but the outputs are not protected from a short circuit with the negative rail).

The value of the supply voltage is chosen so that sufficient current flows through the compensating diodes D1 and D2 and the voltage drop across the common emitter resistor RE is adequate.

ECL circuits available on the open market usually operated with logic levels incompatible with other families. This meant that interoperation between ECL and other logic families, such as the popular TTL family, required additional interface circuits. The fact that the high and low logic levels are relatively close meant that ECL suffers from small noise margins, which can be troublesome.

At least one manufacturer, IBM, made ECL circuits for use in the manufacturer&#x27;s own products. The power supplies were substantially different from those used in the open market.

===PECL===
Positive emitter-coupled logic, also called pseudo-ECL, (PECL) is a further development of ECL using a positive 5 V supply instead of a negative 5.2 V supply. Low-voltage positive emitter-coupled logic (LVPECL) is a power-optimized version of PECL, using a positive 3.3 V instead of 5 V supply. PECL and LVPECL are differential-signaling systems and are mainly used in high-speed and clock-distribution circuits.

A common misconception is that PECL devices are slightly different from ECL devices.
In fact, every ECL device is also a PECL device.

<text>Olof Rudbeck the Younger or Olaus Rudbeckius d.y. (15 March 1660 – 23 March 1740) was a Swedish explorer, scientist, botanist, ornithologist and rector of Uppsala University.

==Biography==
Olof Rudbeck was born in Uppsala, Sweden, the son of Olaus Rudbeck Sr. (1630–1702), a professor of medicine at Uppsala University. He travelled to England, Holland and Germany in 1687 to study botany. Rudbeck took a medical degree at the Utrecht University in 1690. Returning to his home country in 1692, he succeeded his father as professor of medicine at Uppsala University. Serving alongside Lars Roberg (1664–1742), he specialized in anatomy, botany, zoology, and pharmacology, while Roberg gave lectures in medicine, surgery, physiology and chemistry.

He travelled to Lapland in 1695, joining an expedition commissioned by the King Charles XI of Sweden (1655–1697), for which his mission was to study nature, the mountainous region in particular. He returned and published &quot;Lapponia illustrata&quot;, an album of beautifully colored pictures of birds, flowers and scenery, for which he is best remembered. At the beginning of the eighteenth century, Rudbeck turned his attention away from nature studies to speculation about the relationship between Sami languages to Finnish and Hungarian.

To honour his accomplishments (and posthumously, those of his namesake father), he was ennobled in 1719 by Queen Ulrika Eleonora, Queen of Sweden (1688–1741), as a &quot;naturalized nobleman&quot; (noble family of Rudbeck, nr. 1637). His student, the botanist Carl Linnaeus (1707–1778), named a genus of flowers &quot;Rudbeckia&quot; in honor of him and his father. Rudbeck helped his father with his botanical work, &quot;Campi elysii,&quot; including making woodblocks for the life-sized woodcut illustrations of many of the species were included in the two volumes that were published, together with his father Olof, his two sisters, Johanna Christina and Wendela, and other colleagues. It is thought that about 3,200 woodblocks were cut for the series, and those remaining today (about 140 from volume 1) are housed at the Linnean Society of London.

The plant genus &quot;Rudbeckia&quot; was named by Linnaeus in honor of both Rudbeck and his son.

==Personal life==
Rudbeck was married three times. Rudbeck had 24 children with three wives. His sister, Wendela, married Peter Olai Nobelius, and from them descends the Nobel family, including Ludvig Nobel, founder of Branobel and Alfred Nobel, founder of the Nobel Prizes.

<text>Zabriskie Point is a part of the Amargosa Range located east of Death Valley in Death Valley National Park in California, United States, noted for its erosional landscape. It is composed of sediments from Furnace Creek Lake, which dried up 5 million years ago—long before Death Valley came into existence.

==Name==

The location was named after Christian Brevoort Zabriskie, vice-president and general manager of the Pacific Coast Borax Company in the early 20th century. The company&#x27;s twenty-mule teams were used to transport borax from its mining operations in Death Valley.
==History==
Millions of years prior to the actual sinking and widening of Death Valley and the existence of Lake Manly (see Geology of the Death Valley area), another lake covered a large portion of Death Valley including the area around Zabriskie Point. This ancient lake began forming approximately nine million years ago. During several million years of the lake&#x27;s existence, sediments were collecting at the bottom in the form of saline muds, gravels from nearby mountains, and ashfalls from the then-active Black Mountain volcanic field. These sediments combined to form what we today call the Furnace Creek Formation. The climate along Furnace Creek Lake was dry, but not nearly as dry as in the present. &quot;Paracamelus&quot;, mastodons, wild horses, carnivores, and birds left tracks in the lakeshore muds, along with fossilized grass and reeds. Borates, which made up a large portion of Death Valley&#x27;s historical past were concentrated in the lakebeds from hot spring waters and alteration of rhyolite in the nearby volcanic field. Weathering and alteration by thermal waters are also responsible for the variety of colors represented there.
Regional mountain-building to the west influenced the climate to become more and more arid, causing the lake to dry up, and creating a dry lake. Subsequent widening and sinking of Death Valley and the additional uplift of today&#x27;s Black Mountains tilted the area. This provided the necessary relief to accomplish the erosion that produced the badlands we see today. The dark-colored material capping the badland ridges (to the left in the panoramic photograph) is lava from eruptions that occurred three to five million years ago. This hard lava cap has retarded erosion in many places and possibly explains why Manly Beacon, the high outcrop to the right, is much higher than other portion of the badlands. (Manly Beacon was named in honor of William L. Manly, who along with John Rogers, guided members of the ill-fated party of Forty-niners out of Death Valley during the California Gold Rush of 1849.)
The primary source of borate minerals gathered from Death Valley&#x27;s playas is Furnace Creek Formation. The Formation is made up of over 5000 feet (1500 m) of mudstone, siltstone, and conglomerate. The borates were concentrated in these lakebeds from hot spring waters and altered rhyolite from nearby volcanic fields.

==In popular culture==
&quot;Zabriskie Point&quot; is also the title of a 1970 movie by Italian director Michelangelo Antonioni; its soundtrack features music by British bands Pink Floyd and the Rolling Stones, Americans Jerry Garcia and Grateful Dead, among others.

The philosopher Michel Foucault called his 1975 acid trip at Zabriskie Point the greatest experience of his life.

This location is featured prominently on the cover of U2&#x27;s album &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot;.

This location was used to represent the surface of Mars in the 1964 film &quot;Robinson Crusoe on Mars&quot;.

&quot;Zabriskie Point&quot; is the name of Radio Massacre International&#x27;s album released in 2000.

Zabriskie Point is a Soviet code for a location on the surface of the Moon in &quot;Omon Ra&quot;, a dystopian thriller novel by Victor Pelevin.

Zabriskie Point is a significant location in the novels &quot;Fall of Night&quot;, &quot;Dust and Decay&quot;, and &quot;Fire and Ash&quot; by Jonathan Maberry, in each case, as the location of a top secret chemical and biological research station.

Zabriskie Point was used as a film location for the 1960 Universal film &quot;Spartacus&quot;, showing Gladiator school boss Peter Ustinov on muleback trekking to an Egyptian mine to buy slaves to put in training.

Shots taken from Zabriskie Point of Red Cathedral and Manly Beacon were used as the basis for shots that were then digitally altered to form the planet of Arvala-7 in the first season of &quot;The Mandalorian&quot;.

<text>Talk Talk were an English band formed in 1981, led by Mark Hollis (vocals, guitar, piano), Lee Harris (drums), and Paul Webb (bass). Initially a synth-pop group, Talk Talk&#x27;s first two albums, &quot;The Party&#x27;s Over&quot; (1982) and &quot;It&#x27;s My Life&quot; (1984), reached top 40 in the UK and produced the international hit singles &quot;Talk Talk&quot;, &quot;Today&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s My Life&quot;, and &quot;Such a Shame&quot;. They achieved widespread critical success in Europe and the UK with the album &quot;The Colour of Spring&quot; (1986) along with its singles &quot;Life&#x27;s What You Make It&quot; and &quot;Living in Another World&quot;. 1988&#x27;s &quot;Spirit of Eden&quot; moved the group towards a more experimental sound informed by jazz and improvisation, pioneering what became known as post-rock; it was critically acclaimed but commercially unsuccessful.

Friction with the band&#x27;s label, EMI, resulted in legal action and countersuing. Webb departed, and the band switched to Polydor for their final studio album, 1991&#x27;s &quot;Laughing Stock&quot;, but split soon afterwards. Singer Mark Hollis released one solo album in 1998 before retiring from the music industry; he died in 2019. The band&#x27;s founding bass player and drummer, Paul Webb and Lee Harris, played in several bands together, including .O.rang; long-term collaborator Tim Friese-Greene continued in the business as a musician and producer.

== History ==

=== 1981–1983: Formation ===

Talk Talk began as a quartet consisting of Mark Hollis, formerly from The Reaction (vocals/main songwriter), Lee Harris (drums), Paul Webb (bass guitar), and Simon Brenner (keyboards). In their early years they were often compared with Duran Duran. In addition to a band name consisting of a repeated word, the two shared a Roxy Music-inspired musical direction, as well as the same record label (EMI) and producer (Colin Thurston). The band also supported Duran Duran on tour in 1982.

The band released their first single, &quot;Mirror Man&quot;, on EMI in February 1982. The single was not a great success, but was quickly followed by their self-titled single in April 1982 (a rerecording of a track by The Reaction) which reached No. 52 in the UK. The band&#x27;s first album, titled &quot;The Party&#x27;s Over&quot;, was released in July 1982. The band had their first UK Top 40 hits with the singles &quot;Today&quot; (UK No. 14) and a re-release of &quot;Talk Talk&quot; (UK No. 23). These singles also were hits in other countries, including Ireland, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand. The re-release of the &quot;Talk Talk&quot; single reached the U.S. Top 75. The album was produced by Colin Thurston, who was Duran Duran&#x27;s in-house EMI producer at the time, but picked by Hollis because of his involvement with David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Heroes&quot;. It was a moderate success in the UK reaching No. 21, and was later certified Silver by the BPI for sales of 60,000 copies by 1985. It was a Top 10 hit in New Zealand.

Brenner left after the 1983 non-LP hit single &quot;My Foolish Friend&quot;, which was produced by frequent Roxy Music collaborator Rhett Davies. At this point, Talk Talk was a trio, as Brenner was never officially replaced. However, Tim Friese-Greene was recruited to assist with the recording of their second album, &quot;It&#x27;s My Life&quot;, and he became the band&#x27;s producer as well as keyboardist and Hollis&#x27; songwriting partner. Although a major contributor to the band&#x27;s studio output and a de facto fourth member, Friese-Greene never officially joined the band. As such, he did not play with the touring band on live dates, and was absent from the band&#x27;s publicity material.

=== 1984–1986: Commercial success ===

Although major success eluded them in the UK, Talk Talk achieved considerable international success in 1984/85, particularly in continental Europe, North America and New Zealand, with the album &quot;It&#x27;s My Life&quot;. The accompanying single &quot;Such a Shame&quot; (inspired by the book &quot;The Dice Man&quot;) became a Top 10 hit in Austria, Italy, France, Germany, Netherlands and Switzerland during this period. The title track of the album entered the U.S., Canadian, French, German, New Zealand and Netherlands Top 40. A third single, &quot;Dum Dum Girl&quot;, was a success in some European countries and in New Zealand; however, the album and its singles were largely ignored in the UK. Commercial success notwithstanding, the band made deliberate choices that moved them away from the mainstream. The music video for &quot;It&#x27;s My Life&quot;, for instance, featured a grumpy Hollis who mocks lip-synching; after EMI protested, they re-shot the video, turning it into &quot;a total piss-take of lip-synching&quot;, in Alan McGee&#x27;s words.

The artist James Marsh designed the first cover image for &quot;It&#x27;s My Life&quot; based on the band&#x27;s name. He followed the theme for subsequent singles, remaining the band&#x27;s artistic frontman and creating all their covers and posters throughout their career.

Talk Talk abandoned the synth-pop style completely with their third album, 1986&#x27;s &quot;The Colour of Spring&quot;. It became their biggest success in the UK, making the Top 10 (and certified Gold by the BPI for sales over 100,000 copies), in part due to the Top 20 single &quot;Life&#x27;s What You Make It&quot;, which was also successful internationally. Another single, &quot;Living in Another World&quot;, charted in the Top 40 in Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Belgium and Italy (and just outside the Top 40 in the UK and France). By this time, all Talk Talk songs were being written by Hollis and Friese-Greene. The extended line-up for the 1986 tour consisted of Hollis, Webb and Harris, plus John Turnbull (guitars), Rupert Black and Ian Curnow (keyboards), Phil Reis and Leroy Williams (percussion), and Mark Feltham (harmonica). Most notable among these concerts was their appearance at the Montreux Jazz Festival, 11 July 1986, released on DVD in 2008 as &quot;Live at Montreux 1986&quot;.

=== 1987–1991: Experimental period ===

The success of &quot;The Colour of Spring&quot; afforded the band a bigger budget and schedule for the recording of their next album. Over a year in the making, and featuring contributions from many outside musicians, &quot;Spirit of Eden&quot; was released in 1988, on EMI&#x27;s Parlophone label. The album was assembled from many hours of improvised instrumentation that Hollis and Friese-Greene had edited and arranged using digital equipment. The result was a mix of rock, jazz, classical, and ambient music. Critically praised, the album reached the UK Top 20 and was certified Silver by the BPI for sales of over 60,000 copies. The band announced they would not be attempting to recreate the album live (since, according to Hollis, &quot;People would just want to hear the songs as they are on the album and for me that&#x27;s not satisfying enough&quot;). Without touring or music videos or singles as the band intended, there was little marketing left that the record company could do; in the end the band grudgingly agreed to a video for the remixed version of &quot;I Believe in You&quot;, released as first single. Hollis, though, was unhappy with the video, as he made clear in an interview with &quot;Q Magazine&quot;: &quot;I really feel that [the video] was a massive mistake ... I thought just by sitting there and listening and really thinking about what it was about, I could get that in my eyes. But you cannot do it. It just feels stupid. It was depressing and I wish I&#x27;d never done it.&quot;

During the making of &quot;Spirit of Eden&quot;, Talk Talk manager Keith Aspden had attempted to free the band from their record contract with EMI. Relations between the band and label continued to degrade after the album&#x27;s release, eventually culminating in litigation brought by Aspden which extracted the band from their EMI contract. In 2011, Aspden clarified the conditions surrounding the dispute: &quot;in essence our motivation in the court case with EMI was all about money and an opportunity to secure a better deal with another record company. EMI in our view had misinterpreted the meaning of the clause which specified when they should exercise their option. They lost the case on appeal.&quot; EMI then sued the band, claiming that &quot;Spirit of Eden&quot; was not &quot;commercially satisfactory&quot;, but the case was thrown out of court. Webb left the band in late 1988.

With the band now released from EMI, the label released the retrospective compilation &quot;Natural History&quot; in 1990. It peaked at number 3 on the UK album chart and was certified Gold by the BPI for sales of over 100,000 copies. It was also an international success and eventually went on to sell more than 1 million copies worldwide. The 1984 single &quot;It&#x27;s My Life&quot; was also re-released, and this time became the band&#x27;s highest charting single in their native country, reaching number 13 on the UK Singles Chart. A re-release of the single &quot;Life&#x27;s What You Make It&quot; also reached the Top 30. Following up on this renewed popular interest in the band, the label then released &quot;History Revisited&quot; in 1991, a compilation of new remixes, which made the UK Top 40 (it also reached the Top 30 in Germany and the Top 75 in the Netherlands). The band sued EMI for releasing the remixed material without their permission.

By 1990, the band had essentially morphed into a vehicle for the studio recordings of Hollis and long-term collaborator Friese-Greene, along with session musicians (including long-term Talk Talk drummer Harris). The group signed a two-album contract with Polydor Records and released &quot;Laughing Stock&quot; on Polydor&#x27;s Verve Records imprint in 1991. &quot;Laughing Stock&quot; crystallised the experimental sound the band started with &quot;Spirit of Eden&quot; (which has been retroactively categorised as &quot;post-rock&quot; by some critics). Even more minimalist than its predecessor, &quot;Laughing Stock&quot; reached just No. 26 on the UK Albums Chart.

== Post break-up ==

After &quot;Laughing Stock&quot;, Talk Talk disbanded in 1991; Hollis said that he wished to focus on his family. Paul Webb rejoined Lee Harris, and the two went on to form the band .O.rang, while Tim Friese-Greene started recording under the name Heligoland. In 1998, Mark Hollis released his self-titled solo début &quot;Mark Hollis&quot;, which was much in keeping with the minimalist post-rock sound of &quot;Spirit of Eden&quot; and &quot;Laughing Stock&quot;, but he retired from the music industry shortly afterwards.

Webb also collaborated under the name of Rustin Man with Portishead lead singer Beth Gibbons and released &quot;Out of Season&quot; in 2002, &quot;Drift Code&quot; in 2019 and &quot;Clockdust&quot; in 2020. Harris also featured on the Bark Psychosis 2004 album, &quot;&quot;.

Mark Hollis died on 25 February 2019, aged 64.

== Legacy and influence ==
Talk Talk&#x27;s influence upon musicians has exceeded the band&#x27;s visibility among the general public. Along with the band Slint, Talk Talk are credited with inventing &quot;post-rock&quot; in their last two albums, &quot;Spirit of Eden&quot; and &quot;Laughing Stock&quot;. The artists who have praised the band or cited them as an influence include Pearl Jam&#x27;s Jeff Ament, Kate Bush, Tears for Fears, Matthew Good, Radiohead, Doves, Elbow, Shearwater, M83, Bark Psychosis, The Notwist, Cedric Bixler-Zavala of the Mars Volta, Steven Wilson of Porcupine Tree, Storm Corrosion (a joint project between Opeth&#x27;s Mikael Åkerfeldt and Porcupine Tree&#x27;s Steven Wilson), Steve Hogarth of Marillion, Richard Barbieri of Japan and Porcupine Tree, Death Cab for Cutie, and Richard Wright of Pink Floyd. The main influence of the Held By Trees project is Talk Talk and Mark Hollis and it has come to involve many associates of the band. 

The bands Placebo, Weezer, the Divine Comedy and the Gathering covered their song &quot;Life&#x27;s What You Make It&quot; and No Doubt scored a global hit with a cover of &quot;It&#x27;s My Life&quot; in 2003 which reached number 20 on the UK charts. Lights recorded a cover of &quot;Living in Another World&quot; Guy Garvey of the band Elbow said: &quot;Mark Hollis started from punk and by his own admission he had no musical ability. To go from only having the urge, to writing some of the most timeless, intricate and original music ever is as impressive as the moon landings for me.&quot;

A tribute album and anthological book, both titled &quot;Spirit of Talk Talk&quot;, were released in 2012. The book includes all the artwork James Marsh did for the band, and hand-written lyrics (by the band). The album includes covers by various artists, proceeds going to the conservation organisation BirdLife International.

On Tuesday 26 November 2019, &quot;Spirit of Talk Talk&quot; organised A Celebration of Mark Hollis and Talk Talk concert at the Royal Festival Hall, London, UK. Founding band member Simon Brenner, who played keyboards on studio album, &quot;The Party&#x27;s Over&quot; was amongst the long list of guest musicians who performed songs from all five Talk Talk studio albums and Mark Hollis&#x27; solo album. The evening was described as &quot;A Majestic Tribute&quot; by the London-based daily newspaper The Evening Standard.

In March 2020, a documentary about Talk Talk by the Belgian director Gwenaël Breës was screened for the first time at the Copenhagen International Documentary Film Festival. Entitled &quot;In a Silent Way&quot;, filmed before Mark Hollis&#x27; death and without the participation of the main band members, it pays tribute to the musical journey and integrity of Talk Talk. In September 2021, the film won the prize for best music documentary awarded by the jury of the Musical Ecran festival in France.

Hollis and Talk Talk continue to be praised as artists who did not cave in to the pressures of corporate and commercial interests. Says Alan McGee, &quot;I find the whole story of one man against the system in a bid to maintain creative control incredibly heartening.&quot;

<text>Laurence Manning (July 20, 1899 – April 10, 1972) was a Canadian science fiction author.
==Early life==
Manning was born in Saint John, New Brunswick, and attended Kings College in Halifax, Nova Scotia. As did his two older brothers, Manning signed up to participate in WWI, but he was too young - when the War ended, he was still in training, and never saw action overseas. He signed his attestation papers for the RFC on 14 May 1918. Manning lost his two older brothers at very early ages: the oldest Frederick Charles died of wounds suffered fighting for the 85th Battalion, C.E.F in the battle of Vimy Ridge, France, on April 9, 1917; James Harold suffered wounds in the same battle but survived the war. He died working as an engineer for the Standard Oil Company in Maturin, Venezuela, in October, 1924 at age 27. 
==Writing career==
In the 1920s Manning moved to the United States, living initially with his great uncle, Craven Langstroth Betts, the noted Canadian poet. In the US, he lived in Manhattan before moving to Staten Island in 1928, where he began writing short stories for several pulp science fiction magazines. After teaming with SF writer Fletcher Pratt in &quot;City of the Living Dead&quot; in the May, 1930 issue of Science Wonder Stories, he wrote &quot;The Voyage of the &#x27;Asteroid&#x27;&quot;, which appeared in the Summer 1932 issue of &quot;Wonder Stories Quarterly&quot;, and &quot;The Man Who Awoke&quot;, a series of stories that was later published as a novel. He also translated at least one German-language story for Hugo Gernsback&#x27;s magazines (this may have been the translation of his popular story &quot;The Man Who Awoke,&quot; published as &quot;Der Jahrtausendschläfer&quot; (The Millennium Sleeper). However, In the July, August and September, 1932 issues of Wonder Stories appeared &quot;In the Year 8000&quot;, by Otfrid von Hanstein, translated by Manning, teamed with Konrad Schmidt.

It is possible the loss of these brothers and the horrors of war the country had just endured caused Laurence to become interested in the idea of Utopia. In the early 1930s he had over 500 books in his collection on the subject. It was in hopes of obtaining more book titles on Utopia that Manning contacted Wonder Stories magazine. He hoped to talk with Hugo Gernsback, but instead got David Lasser. They formed a strong friendship that lasted until Manning&#x27;s death in 1972. They ate lunch together frequently, and it was at one of them that Manning mentioned having an idea for a story. After some discussion, Lasser suggested that Manning contact Fletcher Pratt, who could help with the story. This resulted in Manning&#x27;s first published science fiction work, co-written by Pratt, entitled City of the Living Dead, which appeared in the May, 1930 Science Wonder Stories.

Manning gave up his successful writing career at the end of 1935 (with the exceptions of &quot;Coal Thief&quot; in the April, 1936 The Planeteer and &quot;Expedition to Pluto&quot; in the winter, 1939 Planet Stories), and devoted his time to Kelsey mail order nursery business he owned and managed. Apart from several short stories in the 1950s (Good-Bye, Ilha!, Mr. Mottle Goes Pouf, Men on Mars), he never wrote any more science fiction. However, he was the author of a successful book on gardening, &quot;The How and Why of Better Gardening&quot; (1951), Van Nostrand &amp; Co, used for more than 40 years as a textbook by the Garden Clubs of America.

==Rocketry==
He was a founding member of the American Interplanetary Society, serving as both president and editor of the Society&#x27;s publication, &quot;Astronautics&quot;. For his involvement in the Society, Manning is recognized by the Smithsonian&#x27;s National Air and Space Museum as an early rocketry pioneer. It was during his tenure as president of the society that the organization&#x27;s name was changed to the American Rocket Society. Manning retired from the Society in the mid-1940s, stating that rocketry had &#x27;grown up&#x27;, and was no longer a place for amateurs. In 1960, Manning was awarded a fellowship in the Society, presumably given at the Society&#x27;s annual meeting.
==Personal life and death==
Manning married Edith Mary Finette Burrows in 1928 and had three children: Helen Louise, Dorothy, and James Edward. His daughter Dorothy has mentioned that Laurence was not only a skilled writer, but a pianist as well. He composed his own pieces, primarily as music director of his church, though only one, Peter Pan, was ever published. He also smoked pipe. He lived in Highlands, New Jersey, from 1951 until his death in 1972.

<text>The Man Who Awoke is a 1933 science fiction novel by Canadian writer Laurence Manning. It was initially serialized in five parts during 1933 in &quot;Wonder Stories&quot; magazine. In 1975 it was published by Ballantine Books as one complete novel.

Norman Winters puts himself into suspended animation for 5,000 years at a time. The stories detail his ensuing adventures as he tries to make sense of the societies he encounters each time he wakes.

Isaac Asimov credited &quot;The Man Who Awoke&quot; for bringing the &quot;energy crisis&quot; to his attention 40 years before it became common knowledge in the 1970s.

==Plot summary==

Part 1 of the series describes Norman Winters’ previous life and his process of suspended animation.

After the disappearance of Norman Winters, his son, Vincent, questions the servants working on his New York estate. After receiving a suspicious answer from the groundskeeper Carstairs, one of his father&#x27;s most loyal workers, Vincent threatens to turn him in to the police. Preserving his freedom, Carstairs presents Vincent with a letter from his father detailing his whereabouts.

In the letter, Norman explains his collaborations with various scientists to determine how to build a chamber which will shield him from cosmic rays and a coma-inducing drug. Norman constructs an underground chamber with six-foot leaden walls impervious to the outside radiation&#x27;s influence on his cells. Once in the chamber, Norman will use the sleep-drug to fall into a coma where he “shall not awake until [he is] again subjected to radiation,” which will be provided by an X-ray lamp (similar to what one finds next to any dentist&#x27;s chair) set to power on after five thousand years. In hopes of awaking to a Utopian future, Norman encourages Vincent to live his life in the absence of his father.

Upon waking up, Norman discovers that he had lain dormant for three thousand years. Realizing the success of his time travelling system, Norman explores the futuristic world briefly, and then returns to suspended animation, planning to wake again after another 5,000 years. He repeats this several times, giving the reader a brief view of various social results.

* 5000 AD. Humanity staggers to save itself amid the world&#x27;s littered, stagnant wreckage after what has become known as the great &quot;Age of Waste&quot;. There is a political rivalry between the younger generation opposing the older generation&#x27;s proposed waste of resources that they (the younger generation) assert that they are entitled to.
* 10,000 AD. The world is dominated by &quot;the Brain&quot; – the immovable in purpose super computer that knows all, sees all, and feels nothing. Thanks to its cradle-to-grave supervision, human life is easy and comfortable, but what will happen when The Brain realizes people are superfluous?
* 15,000 AD. People can now program their choice of dreams and sleep their lives away. Winters awakes to find the sleeping outnumber the living. He cannot stop the implosion of civilization by himself.
* 20,000 AD. After an abused Age of Freedom came an Age of License. Genetic experiment heralded the terrifying &quot;Age of Anarchy&quot;. Each Individual had his own mobile &quot;City&quot; that provided for all his needs, resulting in a society where people had no need for each other and were incapable of cooperating, resulting in nearly all interpersonal encounters being small wars.
* 25,000 AD. Scientists discover the secret sought through the centuries – immortality. But is Mankind ready for it? Immortality is frightfully boring without a purpose. Humanity scatters to the far corners of the cosmos seeking knowledge and experience, leading to a quest toward &quot;the meaning of it all.&quot;

The novel might be easily dismissed as standard pulp fare if it had not presaged concepts popularized decades later: the sexual revolution, green consumerism, strong AI, full-immersion virtual reality as a surgical procedure (like The Matrix), desktop molecular manufacturing, global warming, and stem cell therapies. Many of these have only appeared in most peoples&#x27; worldview in the 21st century.

<text>The American Rocket Society (ARS) began its existence on 4 April 1930, under the name of the American Interplanetary Society. It was founded by science fiction writers G. Edward Pendray, David Lasser, Laurence Manning, Nathan Schachner, and others. Pendray corresponded with Willy Ley of the German rocket society, Verein für Raumschiffahrt, and visited him in 1931. The members originally conducted their own rocket experiments in New York and New Jersey. The society printed its own journal. The AIS did pioneering work in testing the design requirements of liquid-fueled rockets, with a number of successful test launches of ARS rockets occurring in this period and pointing the way to the United States space program. Its name was changed to American Rocket Society on 6 April 1934. In 1936, the American Rocket Society and its member Alfred Africano were awarded the Prix d&#x27;Astronautique by the Société astronomique de France (French Astronomical Society) in recognition of their pioneering tests with liquid fueled rockets.

The &quot;Journal of the American Rocket Society&quot; was published from 194553.

Membership increased rapidly in the 1950s as the government funded &quot;upper air research&quot;, and by the end of the decade it had reached 21,000. In early 1963, the ARS merged with the Institute of the Aerospace Sciences to become the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA).

<text>Cornish College of the Arts (CCA) is a private art college in Seattle, Washington. It was founded in 1914 by music teacher Nellie Cornish. The college&#x27;s main campus is in the Denny Triangle neighborhood near downtown Seattle.

== History ==
Cornish College of the Arts was founded in 1914 as the Cornish School of Music, by Nellie Cornish (1876–1956), a teacher of piano; at that time, she had been teaching music in Seattle for 14 years. In 1915, the school was known as The Cornish School of Music Language and Dancing. Cornish would go on to serve as the school&#x27;s director for its first 25 years, until 1939. The Cornish School of Music began its operations in rented space in the Boothe (or Booth) Building on Broadway and Pine Street. 

As Cornish developed the idea of her school, she initially turned to the Montessori-based pedagogical method of Evelyn Fletcher-Copp, but turned at last to the progressive musical pedagogy of Calvin Brainerd Cady, who had worked as musical director with John Dewey as the latter set up his seminal progressive educational project, what is now the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools. Conceived by Cornish as &quot;an elementary school of the arts—all the arts—with music as its major subject,&quot; the school initially taught only children, but it soon expanded to functioning also as a normal school (a &quot;teachers&#x27; college&quot;) under Cady. Within three years it had enrolled over 600 students, expanded the age range of its students to college age, and was the country&#x27;s largest music school west of Chicago.

Nellie Cornish recruited opportunistically where she saw talent, and the school soon offered classes as diverse as eurhythmics, French language, painting, dance (folk and ballet), and theater. In 1915, the first full academic year, eurhythmics was added and the first studio arts classes taught. Dance, with a ballet focus, became a department in 1916 headed by Chicago-trained Mary Ann Wells. That year, Cornish became one of the first West Coast schools of any type to offer a summer session. After the closing of their influential Chicago Little Theatre, Maurice Browne and Ellen Van Volkenburg were brought in to found the Drama Department in 1918; the department, with its incorporation of scenic design, music, and dance in its productions, became central to Cornish&#x27;s plans to ally the arts. Van Volkenburg also began a marionette department, the first such department in the country. By 1923, opera and modern dance had been added to the curriculum as well.

In 1920, in recognition that music was no longer the school&#x27;s central focus, the school&#x27;s name was simplified to The Cornish School. By this time, too, the school had expanded its age range, and was offering classes and lessons from early childhood to the undergraduate level. The school gathered a board of trustees from among Seattle&#x27;s elite, who funded the school through the hard economic times during and after World War I, and raised money for a purpose-built school building. Finished in 1921, the Cornish School building, now known as Kerry Hall, opened for the 1921–22 academic year.

The Cornish Trio of the 1920s—Peter Meremblum, Berthe Poncy (later Berthe Poncy Jacobson), and Kola Levienne—may have been the first resident chamber music group at an American school. In 1935, Cornish established the first (but ultimately short-lived) college-level school of radio broadcasting in the U.S.

Through the 1920s, the school was often on the edge of financial failure, but was of a caliber that prompted Anna Pavlova to call it &quot;the kind of school other schools should follow.&quot; Although the mortgage was paid off and the building had been donated to the school in 1929, financial difficulties inevitably grew during the Great Depression. Ultimately, convinced that finances would not allow the school to do more than &quot;tread water&quot;, Nellie Cornish resigned her position as head of the school in 1939.

In December 2024, Cornish announced that it intended to merge with Seattle University and become the latter&#x27;s flagship arts program when an agreement is finalized by May 2025. Under the proposal, the two colleges would maintain their separate campuses in the city; Cornish would retain its of space for 500 students—a decline of 38 percent from peak enrollment in 2003.

== Campus ==
Cornish College of the Arts operates a three-part campus in the Capitol Hill, Denny Triangle, and Seattle Center areas of Seattle, Washington.
Cornish&#x27;s historic campus is composed of its original 1921 building on Capitol Hill and its grounds. The building, now known as Kerry Hall, contains the 200-seat PONCHO Concert Hall. Kerry Hall was designed in the Spanish Colonial Revival style by leading Seattle architect Abraham H. Albertson and is on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) as the &quot;Cornish School&quot;.

Cornish opened its new Main Campus in 2003 in the Denny Triangle area of downtown Seattle. The 1928, Art Deco-style Main Campus Center is listed on the NRHP as &quot;William Volker Building&quot;. Other buildings of note are the Raisbeck Performance Hall constructed in 1915, a Seattle City Landmark under the name &quot;Old Norway Hall&quot;, and the 1929 Notion Building. In 2015, the college opened the new 20-story Cornish Commons, which contains a residence hall, studios, and meeting rooms.

Located on the Seattle Center grounds is the Cornish Playhouse at Seattle Center, the college&#x27;s premier performance venue. Built for the Century 21 Exposition of 1962, the Playhouse was leased to Cornish by the City of Seattle in 2013. Along with the 440-seat main stage, the complex includes the 100+ seat Alhadeff Studio Theater and a scene shop.

=== Library ===
The library at Cornish College specializes in art, dance, design, music, performance production, and theatre. it held 4,700 CDs, 40,000 books, has 2,200 videos, and subscribed to 154 periodicals. Its special collections include an image collection and 35 mm slides.

<text>June Allyson (born Eleanor Geisman; October 7, 1917 – July 8, 2006) was an American stage, film, and television actress.

Allyson began her career in 1937 as a dancer in short subject films and on Broadway in 1938. She signed with MGM in 1943, and rose to fame the following year in &quot;Two Girls and a Sailor&quot;. Allyson&#x27;s &quot;girl next door&quot; image was solidified during the mid-1940s when she was paired with actor Van Johnson in six films. In 1951, she won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress for her performance in &quot;Too Young to Kiss&quot;. From 1959 to 1961, she hosted and occasionally starred in her own anthology series, &quot;The DuPont Show with June Allyson&quot;, which aired on CBS from 1959 to 1961.

In the 1970s, she returned to the stage, starring in &quot;Forty Carats&quot; and &quot;No, No, Nanette&quot;. In 1982, Allyson released her autobiography &quot;June Allyson by June Allyson&quot;, and continued her career with guest starring roles on television and occasional film appearances. She later established the June Allyson Foundation for Public Awareness and Medical Research and worked to raise money for research for urological and gynecological diseases affecting senior citizens. During the 1980s, Allyson also became a spokesperson for Depend undergarments, in a successful marketing campaign that has been credited in reducing the social stigma of incontinence. She made her final onscreen appearance in 2001.

Allyson was married four times (to three husbands) and had two children with her first husband, Dick Powell. She died of respiratory failure and bronchitis in July 2006 at the age of 88.

==Early life==
Allyson was born Eleanor Geisman, nicknamed Ella, in The Bronx, New York City. She was the daughter of Clara (née Provost) and Robert Geisman. She had a brother, Henry, who was two years older. She said she had been raised as a Catholic, but a discrepancy exists relating to her early life, and her studio biography was often the source of the confusion. Her paternal grandparents, Harry Geisman and Anna Hafner, were immigrants from Germany although Allyson claimed her last name was originally &quot;Van Geisman&quot;, and was of Dutch origin. Studio biographies listed her as Jan Allyson born to Franco-English parents. Upon her death, her daughter said Allyson was born &quot;Eleanor Geisman to a French mother and Dutch father.&quot; In an interview with Larry King Allyson denied being of German Jewish descent.

In April 1918 (when Allyson was six months old), her alcoholic father, who had worked as a janitor, abandoned the family. Allyson was brought up in near poverty, living with her maternal grandparents. To make ends meet, her mother worked as a telephone operator and restaurant cashier. When she had enough funds, she occasionally reunited with her daughter, but more often Allyson was &quot;farmed&quot; to her grandparents or other relatives.

===Accident===
In 1925 (when Allyson was eight), a tree branch fell on her while she was riding her tricycle with her pet terrier in tow. Allyson sustained a fractured skull and broken back, and her dog was killed. Her doctors said she never would walk again and confined her to a heavy steel brace from neck to hips for four years. She ultimately regained her health, but when Allyson had become famous, she was terrified that people would discover her background from the &quot;tenement side of New York City&quot;, and she readily agreed to studio tales of a &quot;rosy life&quot;, including a concocted story that she underwent months of swimming exercises in rehabilitation to emerge as a star swimmer. In her later memoirs, Allyson describes a summer program of swimming that did help her recovery.

After gradually progressing from a wheelchair to crutches to braces, Allyson&#x27;s true escape from her impoverished life was to go to the cinema, where she was enraptured by Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire movies. As a teen, Allyson memorized the trademark dance routines of Ginger Rogers. She claimed later to have watched &quot;The Gay Divorcee&quot; 17 times. She also tried to emulate the singing styles of movie stars, but never mastered reading music.

When her mother remarried and the family was reunited with a more stable financial standing, Allyson was enrolled in the Ned Wayburn Dancing Academy and began to enter dance competitions with the stage name of Elaine Peters.

==Career==
===Early work===
With the death of her stepfather and a bleak future ahead, she left high school midway through her junior year to seek jobs as a dancer. Her first $60-a-week job was as a tap dancer at the Lido Club in Montreal. Returning to New York City, she found work as an actress in movie short subjects filmed by Educational Pictures at its Astoria, Queens NY studio.

Fiercely ambitious, Allyson tried her hand at modeling, but to her consternation became the &quot;sad-looking before part&quot; in a before-and-after bathing suit magazine ad.

===Musical shorts===
Her first career break came when Educational cast her as an ingenue opposite singer Lee Sullivan, comic dancers Herman Timberg, Jr., and Pat Rooney, Jr., and future comedy star Danny Kaye in a series of shorts. These included &quot;Swing for Sale&quot; (1937), &quot;Pixilated&quot; (1937), &quot;Ups and Downs&quot; (1937), &quot;Dime a Dance&quot; (1938), &quot;Dates and Nuts&quot; (1938) and &quot;Sing for Sweetie&quot; (1938).

When Educational ceased operations, Allyson moved to Vitaphone in Brooklyn and starred or co-starred (with dancer Hal Le Roy) in musical shorts. These included &quot;The Prisoner of Swing&quot; (1938), &quot;The Knight Is Young&quot; (1938), &quot;Rollin&#x27; in Rhythm&quot; (1939) and &quot;All Girl Revue&quot; (1940).

===Broadway===
Interspersing jobs in the chorus line at the Copacabana Club with acting roles at Vitaphone, the diminutive 5&#x27;1&quot;, below-100-pound Allyson landed a chorus job in the Broadway show &quot;Sing Out the News&quot; in 1938.

The “legend” around her stage name is that the choreographer gave her a job and a new name: Allyson, a family name, and June, for the month, although like many aspects of her career resume, the story is highly unlikely as she was already dubbing herself &quot;June Allyson&quot; prior to her Broadway engagement. At one point she attributed the name to a director she worked with even later.

Allyson subsequently appeared in the chorus in the Jerome Kern–Oscar Hammerstein II musical &quot;Very Warm for May&quot; (1939).
When Vitaphone discontinued New York production in 1940, Allyson returned to the stage to take on more chorus roles in Rodgers and Hart&#x27;s &quot;Higher and Higher&quot; (1940) and Cole Porter&#x27;s &quot;Panama Hattie&quot; (1940).

Her dancing and musical talent led to a stint as an understudy for the lead, Betty Hutton, and when Hutton contracted measles, Allyson appeared in five performances of &quot;Panama Hattie&quot;. Broadway director George Abbott caught one of performances and offered Allyson one of the lead roles in his production of &quot;Best Foot Forward&quot; (1941).

===Early films===
After her appearance in the Broadway musical, Allyson was selected for the 1943 film version of &quot;Best Foot Forward&quot;. When she arrived in Hollywood, the production had not started, so MGM &quot;placed her on the payroll&quot; of &quot;Girl Crazy&quot; (1943). Despite playing a &quot;bit part&quot;, Allyson received good reviews as a sidekick to &quot;Best Foot Forward&quot;&#x27;s star, Lucille Ball, but was still relegated to the &quot;drop list.&quot;

MGM&#x27;s musical supervisor Arthur Freed saw her screen test sent up by an agent and insisted that Allyson be put on contract immediately. Another musical, &quot;Thousands Cheer&quot; (1943), was a showcase for her singing, albeit still in a minor role.

As a new , although Allyson had already been a performer on stage and screen for over five years, she was presented as an &quot;overnight sensation&quot;, with Hollywood press agents attempting to portray her as an ingenue, selectively slicing years off her true age. Studio bios listed her variously as being born in 1922 and 1923.

===Rising fame===
Allyson&#x27;s breakthrough was in &quot;Two Girls and a Sailor&quot; (1944) where the studio image of the &quot;girl next door&quot; was fostered by her being cast alongside long-time acting chum Van Johnson, the quintessential &quot;boy next door.&quot; As the &quot;sweetheart team&quot;, Johnson and Allyson were to appear together in four later films.

Allyson supported Lucille Ball again in &quot;Meet the People&quot; (1944), which was a flop. It was on this film she met Dick Powell, whom she later married.

She supported Margaret O&#x27;Brien in &quot;Music for Millions&quot; (1944) and was billed after Robert Walker and Hedy Lamarr in the romantic comedy &quot;Her Highness and the Bellboy&quot; (1945).

===Stardom===

Allyson was top-billed along with Walker in &quot;The Sailor Takes a Wife&quot; (1945). She had a role in &quot;Two Sisters from Boston&quot; (1946) with Kathryn Grayson and Peter Lawford, and was one of several MGM stars in &quot;Till the Clouds Roll By&quot; (1946). She also appeared in her first drama, &quot;The Secret Heart&quot;, in 1946 with Claudette Colbert and Walter Pidgeon.

She was reunited with Johnson in &quot;High Barbaree&quot; (1947) and followed with the musical &quot;Good News&quot;, also in 1947.

Allyson starred with Johnson in the 1948 comedy &quot;The Bride Goes Wild&quot;, then played Constance in the hugely popular 1948 &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; (1948). Her song &quot;Thou Swell&quot; was a high point of the Rodgers and Hart biopic &quot;Words and Music&quot; (1948), as performed in the &quot;A Connecticut Yankee&quot; segment with the Blackburn Twins.

Allyson played the tomboy Jo March in &quot;Little Women&quot; (1949), which was a huge hit. She was adept at crying on cue, and many of her films incorporated a crying scene. Fellow MGM player Margaret O&#x27;Brien recalled that she and Allyson were known as &quot;the town criers&quot;. &quot;I cried once in a picture and they said &#x27;Let&#x27;s do it again&#x27;, and I cried for the rest of my career&quot;, she later said.

The same year, MGM announced Allyson would be in &quot;Forever&quot; by Mildred Crann, but the project was dropped. Instead, she starred in &quot;The Stratton Story&quot; (1949) with James Stewart, which she later said was her favorite film.

She made two films with Dick Powell: &quot;The Reformer and the Redhead&quot; (1950) and &quot;Right Cross&quot; (1950), after which she was reunited with Johnson in &quot;Too Young to Kiss&quot; (1951).

In 1950, Allyson had been signed to appear opposite her childhood idol Fred Astaire in &quot;Royal Wedding&quot;, but had to leave the production due to pregnancy. She was replaced initially by Judy Garland, who in turn was replaced by Jane Powell.

Allyson played a doctor in &quot;The Girl in White&quot; (1952), which lost revenue, and a nurse in &quot;Battle Circus&quot; (1953), a hit. She starred in &quot;Remains to Be Seen&quot; (1953) with Johnson, which was a flop. In May 1953, she and MGM agreed to part ways by mutual consent.

===Post MGM===
In 1954, Allyson was in a huge Universal Pictures hit, &quot;The Glenn Miller Story&quot;, as well as another successful MGM film, &quot;Executive Suite&quot;. She also starred the Fox Film &quot;Woman&#x27;s World&quot;, which was less successful.

Allyson was teamed with Stewart again in &quot;Strategic Air Command&quot; (1955) at Paramount, another success.

She had a change of pace in &quot;The Shrike&quot; (1955) with José Ferrer at Universal; it flopped. More popular was &quot;The McConnell Story&quot; (1955) with Alan Ladd at Warner Bros.

In 1956, Allyson did some musical remakes of classic films, &quot;The Opposite Sex&quot;, a remake of &quot;The Women&quot; at MGM, and &quot;You Can&#x27;t Run Away from It&quot;, a remake of &quot;It Happened One Night&quot; at Columbia, which was directed by Powell.

In 1957, she signed with Universal and did two more remakes: &quot;Interlude&quot;, a drama for Douglas Sirk, and &quot;My Man Godfrey&quot;, a comedy with David Niven. She then made &quot;A Stranger in My Arms&quot; (1958) with Jeff Chandler. The box office failure of these films effectively ended her reign as an A-list movie star.

===Television===
&quot;The DuPont Show with June Allyson&quot; (1959–60) ran for one season on CBS and was an attempt to use a high budget formula. She later called it &quot;the hardest thing I ever did.&quot; Her efforts were dismissed by an entertainment critic in the &quot;LA Examiner&quot; as &quot;reaching down to the level of mag fiction.&quot; However, &quot;TV Guide&quot; and other fan magazines such as &quot;TV Magazine&quot; considered Allyson&#x27;s foray into television as revitalizing her fame and career for a younger audience, and remarked that her typecasting by the movie industry as the &quot;girl next door&quot; was a &quot;waste and neglect of talent on its own doorstep.&quot;

She also appeared on shows like &quot;Zane Grey Theater&quot;, &quot;The Dick Powell Theatre&quot;, &quot;The Judy Garland Show&quot;, and &quot;Burke&#x27;s Law&quot; before retiring for several years after the death of Powell in 1963.

===Return to acting===
Allyson returned to acting with an appearance in &quot;The Name of the Game&quot;. In 1970, she briefly starred in &quot;Forty Carats&quot; on Broadway.

Throughout the 1970s, she appeared regularly on television shows such as &quot;See the Man Run&quot; (1971), &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; (1972), and &quot;Letters from Three Lovers&quot; (1973), as well as a cameo in the film &quot;They Only Kill Their Masters&quot; (1972).

Later appearances include &quot;Curse of the Black Widow&quot; (1977), &quot;Three on a Date&quot; (1978), &quot;Vega$&quot; (1978), &quot;Blackout&quot; (1978), &quot;House Calls&quot;, &quot;The Kid with the Broken Halo&quot; (1982) &quot;Simon &amp; Simon&quot;, &quot;The Love Boat&quot;, &quot;Hart to Hart&quot;, &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;, &quot;Misfits of Science&quot;, &quot;Crazy Like a Fox&quot;, and &quot;Airwolf&quot;. Her last appearance was in &quot;These Old Broads&quot; (2001).

Allyson made a special appearance in 1994 in &quot;That&#x27;s Entertainment III&quot;, as one of the film&#x27;s narrators. She spoke about MGM&#x27;s golden era and introduced vintage film clips.

Until 2003, Allyson remained busy touring the country making personal appearances, headlining celebrity cruises, and speaking on behalf of Kimberly-Clark, a long-time commercial interest.

Allyson became the spokesperson for Depend, a diaper line for adults with incontinence, in 1984. The American Urogynecologic Society established the June Allyson Foundation in 1998, made possible by a grant from Kimberly-Clark. The foundation raises money for incontinence education and research. As the first celebrity to undertake the role of public spokesperson for promoting the use of the Depend undergarment, Allyson did &quot;more than any other public figure to encourage and persuade people with incontinence to lead fuller and more active lives&quot;.

==Personal life==

===Marriages and children===

On her arrival in Hollywood, studio heads attempted to enhance the pairing of Van Johnson and Allyson by sending out the two contracted players on a series of &quot;official dates&quot;, which were highly publicized and led to a public perception that a romance had been kindled. Although dating David Rose, Peter Lawford, and John F. Kennedy, Allyson was actually being courted by Dick Powell, who was 13 years her senior and had been previously married to Mildred Maund and Joan Blondell.

On August 19, 1945, Allyson caused MGM studio chief Louis B. Mayer some consternation by marrying Dick Powell. After defying him twice by refusing to stop seeing Powell, in a &quot;tactical master stroke&quot;, she asked Mayer to give her away at the wedding. He was so disarmed that he agreed but put Allyson on suspension anyway.

The Powells had two children, Pamela Allyson Powell (adopted in 1948 through the Tennessee Children&#x27;s Home Society in an adoption arranged by Georgia Tann) and Richard Powell, Jr., born December 24, 1950.

In the mid 1950s, Allyson reportedly had an affair with actor Alan Ladd.

In 1961, Allyson underwent a kidney operation and later, throat surgery, temporarily affecting her trademark raspy voice. She filed for divorce that year, the reason being Powell&#x27;s devotion to work. In February 1961, Allyson was awarded $2.5 million in settlement, along with custody of their children, in an interlocutory divorce decree. However, before the divorce was final, they reconciled and remained married until his death on January 2, 1963. Later, Allyson reflected on how the loss of Powell affected her:

This loss prompted Allyson to start drinking heavily. In 1963, she was going to elope with Powell&#x27;s barber, Glenn Maxwell, but decided against it. She and Maxwell would later get married and divorced, then married and divorced again between 1963 and 1970.

She also went through a bitter court battle with her mother over the custody of the children. Reports at the time revealed that writer/director Dirk Summers, with whom Allyson was romantically involved from 1963 to 1975, was named legal guardian for Ricky and Pamela as a result of a court petition. Members of the nascent jet-set, Allyson and Summers were frequently seen in Cap d&#x27;Antibes, Madrid, Rome, and London. However, Summers refused to marry her and the relationship did not last.

During this time, Allyson struggled with alcoholism, which she overcame in the mid-1970s.

In 1976, Allyson married David Ashrow, a dentist turned actor. The couple occasionally performed together in regional theater, and in the late 1970s and early 1980s, toured the US in the play &quot;My Daughter, Your Son&quot;. They also appeared on celebrity cruiseship tours on the Royal Viking Sky ocean liner in a program that highlighted Allyson&#x27;s movie career.

===Philanthropy and advertising===
After Dick Powell&#x27;s death, Allyson committed herself to charitable work on his behalf, championing the importance of research in urological and gynecological diseases in seniors.

Allyson represented the Kimberly-Clark Corporation in commercials for adult incontinence products. She was initially reticent to participate, but her mother, who had incontinence, convinced her that it was her duty in light of her successful career. The product proved a success. In 1993, actor-turned-agent Marty Ingels publicly charged Allyson with not paying his large commission on the earlier deal on incontinence product advertising. Allyson denied owing any money, and Ashrow and she filed a lawsuit for slander and emotional distress, charging that Ingels was harassing and threatening them, stating Ingels made 138 phone calls during a single eight-hour period. Earlier that year, Ingels had pleaded no contest to making annoying phone calls.

Following a lifelong interest in health and medical research (Allyson had initially wanted to use her acting career to fund her own training as a doctor), she was instrumental in establishing the June Allyson Foundation for Public Awareness and Medical Research.

Allyson also financially supported her brother, Dr. Arthur Peters, through his medical training, and he went on to specialize in otolaryngology.

===Politics===
Allyson was a staunch Republican and strong supporter of Richard Nixon. Her daughter served as Chairman of the Inaugural Concerts for Nixon&#x27;s second inauguration in 1973. Allyson also supported Barry Goldwater in the 1964 United States presidential election.

===Later years===
Powell&#x27;s wealth made it possible for Allyson effectively to retire from show business after his death, making only occasional appearances on talk and variety shows. Allyson returned to the Broadway stage in 1970 in the play &quot;Forty Carats&quot; and later toured in a production of &quot;No, No, Nanette&quot;.

Her autobiography, &quot;June Allyson by June Allyson&quot; (1982), received generally complimentary reviews due to its insider look at Hollywood in one of its golden ages. A more critical appraisal came from Janet Maslin at the &quot;New York Times&quot; in her review, &quot;Hollywood Leaves Its Imprint on Its Chroniclers&quot;, who noted: &quot;Miss Allyson presents herself as the same sunny, tomboyish figure she played on screen in Hollywood... like someone who has come to inhabit the very myths she helped to create on the screen.&quot; Privately, Allyson admitted that her earlier screen portrayals had left her uneasy about the typecast &quot;good wife&quot; roles she had played.

As a personal friend of Ronald and Nancy Reagan, she was invited to many White House dinners, and in 1988, Reagan appointed her to the Federal Council on Aging. Allyson and her later husband, David Ashrow, actively supported fund-raising efforts for both the James Stewart and Judy Garland museums; both Stewart and Garland had been close friends.

In December 1993, Allyson christened the &quot;Holland America Maasdam&quot;, one of the flagships of the Holland America Line. Although her heritage, like much of her personal story, was subject to different interpretations, Allyson always claimed to be proud of a Dutch ancestry.

In 1996, Allyson became the first recipient of the Harvey Award, presented by the James M. Stewart Museum Foundation, in recognition of her positive contributions to the world of entertainment.

===Death===
Following hip-replacement surgery in 2003, Allyson&#x27;s health began to deteriorate. With her husband at her side, she died July 8, 2006, aged 88 at her home in Ojai, California. Her death was a result of pulmonary respiratory failure and acute bronchitis. On her death, Kimberly-Clark Corporation contributed $25,000 to the June Allyson Foundation to support research advances in the care and treatment of women with urinary incontinence. Along with her husband, she was survived by her daughter, Pamela Powell, her son, Richard, a grandson, and her brother.

<text>USS &quot;Maryland&quot; (BB-46), also known as &quot;Old Mary&quot; or &quot;Fighting Mary&quot; to her crewmates, was a . She was the third ship of the United States Navy to be named in honor of the seventh state. She was commissioned in 1921, and serving as the flagship of the fleet, cruised to Australia, New Zealand, and Brazil.

During World War II, she was on Battleship Row during the Attack on Pearl Harbor, and was lightly damaged by Japanese bombs. Returning to duty in 1942, she saw service in the Pacific War, first supporting the rest of the fleet at the Battle of Midway, and then patrolling the Fiji Islands to guard against Japanese incursion. Next, she went on the offensive, commencing shore bombardments in the Battle of Tarawa and later in the Battle of Kwajalein. During the Battle of Saipan she took torpedo damage to her bow, necessitating repairs and refits. She then participated in the Battle of Leyte Gulf where she was hit by a &quot;kamikaze&quot;. She took another &quot;kamikaze&quot; hit at the Battle of Okinawa, then completed repairs and upgrades at Bremerton, WA. She was sailing back to the Pacific Theater when word was received that the war had ended, so she turned around and returned to the Port of Long Beach, CA.

After service in Operation Magic Carpet, she was decommissioned in 1947, and sold for scrap in 1959. She received seven battle stars for World War II service.

== Design ==
In 1916, design work was completed on the next class of battleships to be built for the United States Navy beginning in 1917. These ships were nearly direct copies of the preceding , with the exception of the main battery, which increased from twelve guns to eight guns. The &quot;Colorado&quot; class proved to be the last class of battleships completed of the standard type.

&quot;Maryland&quot; was long overall and she had a beam of and a draft of . She displaced as designed and up to at full load. The ship was powered by four General Electric turbo-electric drives with steam provided by eight oil-fired Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers. The ship&#x27;s propulsion system was rated at for a top speed of , though on speed trials she reached and a speed of . She had a normal cruising range of at , but additional fuel space could be used in wartime to increase her range to at that speed. Her crew numbered 64 officers and 1,241 enlisted men.

She was armed with a main battery of eight 16 in /45 caliber Mark 1 guns in four twin-gun turrets on the centerline, two forward and two aft in superfiring pairs. The secondary battery consisted of sixteen /51 caliber guns, mounted individually in casemates clustered in the superstructure amidships. She carried an anti-aircraft battery of eight /50 caliber guns in individual high-angle mounts. As was customary for capital ships of the period, she had a torpedo tube mounted in her hull below the waterline on each broadside. &quot;Maryland&quot;″s main armored belt was thick, while the main armored deck was up to thick. The main battery gun turrets had thick faces on barbettes. Her conning tower had thick sides.

== Service history ==

=== Inter-war period ===
&quot;Maryland&quot; was one of four dreadnought battleships of the &quot;Colorado&quot; class to be constructed. Her keel was laid down on 24 April 1917, by Newport News Shipbuilding Company of Newport News, Virginia. She was launched on 20 March 1920, and she was commissioned on 21 July 1921. She was the third ship named for the state of Maryland. The first &quot;Maryland&quot; was a sloop commissioned in 1799 and the second &quot;Maryland&quot; was an armored cruiser commissioned in 1905.

Following her commissioning, &quot;Maryland&quot; undertook an East Coast shakedown cruise. Shortly thereafter, &quot;Maryland&quot; was made flagship of Admiral Hilary P. Jones. &quot;Maryland&quot; found herself in great demand for special occasions. She appeared at Annapolis, Maryland, for the 1922 United States Naval Academy graduation and at Boston, Massachusetts, for the anniversary of the battle of Bunker Hill and the Fourth of July. From 18 August to 25 September, she paid her first visit to a foreign port transporting Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes to Rio de Janeiro for Brazil&#x27;s Centennial Exposition. The next year, after fleet exercises off the Panama Canal Zone, &quot;Maryland&quot; transited the canal in the latter part of June to join the battle fleet stationed on the west coast. She continued to be a flagship until 1923 when the flag was shifted to &quot;Pennsylvania&quot;.

She made another voyage to a foreign port in 1925, this time to Australia and New Zealand. Several years later, in 1928, she transported President-elect Herbert Hoover on the Pacific leg of his tour of Latin America. She was overhauled in 1928–1929, and the eight 3-inch anti-aircraft guns were replaced by eight 5-inch/25 cal guns. Throughout these years and the 1930s, she served as a mainstay of fleet readiness through tireless training operations. She conducted numerous patrols in the 1930s. In 1940, &quot;Maryland&quot; and the other battleships of the battle force changed their bases of operations to Pearl Harbor. She was present at Battleship Row along Ford Island during the Japanese attack on 7 December 1941.

=== Attack on Pearl Harbor ===

On the morning of 7 December, &quot;Maryland&quot; was moored along Ford Island, with to port, connected by lines and a gangway. To her fore was , while and were astern. Further aft were and . The seven battleships, in what is now known as &quot;Battleship Row,&quot; had recently returned from maneuvers. Many of &quot;Maryland&quot;″s crew were preparing for shore leave at 09:00 or eating breakfast when the Japanese attack began. As the first Japanese aircraft appeared and explosions rocked the outboard battleships, &quot;Maryland&quot;″s bugler blew general quarters.

Seaman Leslie Short—addressing Christmas cards near his machine gun—brought the first of his ship&#x27;s guns into play, shooting down one of two torpedo bombers that had just released against &quot;Oklahoma&quot;. Inboard of &quot;Oklahoma&quot;, and thus protected from the initial torpedo attack, &quot;Maryland&quot; managed to bring all her antiaircraft (AA) batteries into action. The devastating initial attack sank &quot;Oklahoma&quot;, and she capsized quickly, with many of her surviving men climbing aboard &quot;Maryland&quot; to assist her with anti-aircraft defenses.

&quot;Maryland&quot; was struck by two armor-piercing bombs which detonated low on her hull. The first struck the forecastle awning and made a hole about by . The second exploded after entering the hull at the water level at Frame 10. The latter hit caused flooding and increased the draft forward by . &quot;Maryland&quot; continued to fire and, after the attack, sent firefighting parties to assist her compatriots, especially attempting to rescue survivors from the capsized &quot;Oklahoma&quot;. The men continued to muster the AA defenses in case the Japanese returned to attack. In all, two officers and two men were killed in the attack.

The Japanese erroneously announced that &quot;Maryland&quot; had been sunk, but on 30 December, the damaged ship entered Puget Sound Navy Yard for repairs just behind &quot;Tennessee&quot;. Two of the original twelve 5-inch/51 cal guns were removed and the 5-inch/25 cal guns were replaced by an equal number of 5-inch/38 cal dual purpose guns. Over the course of the next two months, she was repaired and overhauled, receiving new fighting equipment. Repairs were complete on 26 February 1942. She then underwent a series of shakedown cruises to West Coast ports and Christmas Island. She was sent back into action in June 1942, 
the second battleship damaged at Pearl Harbor to return to duty.

=== Supporting patrols ===

During the important Battle of Midway, &quot;Maryland&quot; played a supporting role. Like the other older battleships, she was not fast enough to accompany the aircraft carriers, so she operated with 
a backup fleet protecting the West Coast. &quot;Maryland&quot; stood by on security, awaiting the call that she was needed, until the end of the battle. At the end of the action around Midway, &quot;Maryland&quot; was sent to San Francisco.

Thereafter, &quot;Maryland&quot; engaged in almost constant training exercises with Battleship Division 2, Battleship Division 3, and Battleship Division 4 until 1 August, when she returned to Pearl Harbor for repairs, her first time in the harbor since the Japanese attack. She departed Pearl Harbor in early November with &quot;Colorado&quot;, bound for the forward area. On 12 November, King Neptune came aboard &quot;Maryland&quot; to initiate her &quot;pollywogs&quot; for the line-crossing ceremony. &quot;Maryland&quot; steamed for the Fiji Islands where she patrolled against Japanese incursion. The two battleships acted as sentinels to guard against Japanese advance to prevent Japanese forces from threatening Australia. During this duty, the two battleships conducted frequent sweeps for Japanese forces.

In early 1943, with the success of the Solomon Islands campaign, Allied forces went on the offensive. In February 1943, &quot;Maryland&quot; and &quot;Colorado&quot; moved to New Hebrides, operating off of Efate. Intense heat there proved difficult and unpleasant for the crew. She then moved to Espiritu Santo to guard against Japanese incursion, but heat and heavy rains plagued this tour of duty. &quot;Maryland&quot; and &quot;Colorado&quot; stood out of Aore Island Harbor in August. During a five-week overhaul at Pearl Harbor&#x27;s shipyard, several  AA guns were installed on the top decks and foremast as protection against anticipated Japanese air raids in future operations.

=== Battle of Tarawa ===
Departing the Hawaiian Islands on 20 October 1943 for the South Pacific, &quot;Maryland&quot; became flagship for Rear Admiral Harry W. Hill&#x27;s V Amphibious Force and Southern Attack Force in the Gilbert Islands Invasion. Also aboard her were Major General Julian C. Smith, commander of 2nd Marine Division, and Colonel Evans Carlson, commander of Carlson&#x27;s Raiders. &quot;Maryland&quot; returned to Efate Island staging area, where she joined a large task force preparing for an assault on Tarawa.

The battle of Tarawa commenced on 20 November. In her first offensive action of the war, &quot;Maryland&quot;&#x27;s guns opened fire at 05:00, destroying a shore battery with five salvos on the southwestern point of Betio Island in the Tarawa Atoll. At 06:00 she commenced a scheduled shore bombardment to soften up Japanese defenses ahead of the landings. &quot;Maryland&quot; moved closer to shore to attract Japanese fire and locate artillery emplacements, in the process raking Japanese gun emplacements, control stations, pillboxes and any Japanese installations she could spot. At 09:00 as Marine landing forces encountered heavy Japanese resistance and began taking casualties to emplaced crossfire, &quot;Maryland&quot; provided covering fire to eliminate several Japanese machine gun nests. Her scouting plane then began to cover the progress of the Marines&#x27; assault, with &quot;Maryland&quot; providing artillery support. The plane was damaged and pilot wounded in this action.

After three days of covering the offensive on Betio Island, she moved to Apamama Island to guard Marine landings there. Marines met with only light resistance from 30 Japanese soldiers there, and two prisoners were brought to &quot;Maryland&quot;. On 7 December, &quot;Maryland&quot; left Apamama Island for Pearl Harbor. After a brief stopover there, &quot;Maryland&quot; left for San Francisco for repairs.

=== Battle of Kwajalein Atoll ===

&quot;Maryland&quot; steamed from San Pedro, California on 13 January 1944, and rendezvoused with Task Force 53 at Lahaina Roads for two days of loading ammunition, refueling, and provisioning ahead of a new operation supporting the Marshall Islands campaign. On 30 January 1944, she moved to support landings on Roi Island, along with &quot;Santa Fe&quot;, &quot;Biloxi&quot;, and &quot;Indianapolis&quot;, which formed the Northern Support Group of TF 35.

In the predawn hours of 31 January, the ships began a bombardment of Kwajalein Atoll, the opening moves of the battle of Kwajalein. &quot;Maryland&quot; destroyed numerous Japanese stationary guns and pillboxes. In the course of the battle, she fired so much that she split the liners in the guns of Turret No. 1, putting it out of action for the rest of the day. On 1 February, she continued her attack on Japanese positions as the U.S. landing forces advanced. She became the flagship for Admiral Connally for the next two weeks, resupplying and refueling many of the smaller ships in the operation until she departed with a task unit of carriers and destroyers on 15 February 1944, steaming for Bremerton Navy Yard, where she underwent another overhaul, with her guns being replaced.

=== Battle of Saipan ===
Two months later, &quot;Maryland&quot; sailed westward on 5 May, joining Task Force 52 headed for Saipan. Vice Admiral Richmond K. Turner allotted TF 52 three days to soften up the island&#x27;s defenses ahead of the assault. Firing commenced at 05:45 on 14 June. TF 52 quickly destroyed two coastal guns, then began bombarding Garapan, destroying ammunition dumps, gun positions, small boats, storage tanks, blockhouses, and buildings. &quot;Maryland&quot; then turned her guns to Tanapag, leveling it in heavy bombardment. The invasion commenced 15 June, and &quot;Maryland&quot; provided fire support for the landing forces.

The Japanese attempted to counter the battleships through the air. On 18 June, the ship&#x27;s guns shot down their first Japanese aircraft, but on 22 June, a Mitsubishi G4M3 &quot;Betty&quot; medium bomber flew low over the still-contested Saipan hills and found &quot;Maryland&quot; and &quot;Pennsylvania&quot;. The Japanese plane dropped a torpedo, which blew a large hole in &quot;Maryland&quot;″s starboard bow. The attack caused light casualties, and in 15 minutes she was underway for Eniwetok, and from there she steamed for the repair yards at Pearl Harbor (in reverse the whole time so as not to do further damage to her bow), escorted by two destroyers. Two men were killed in the attack.

With an around-the-clock effort by the shipyard workers, &quot;Maryland&quot; was repaired in 34 days, departing on 13 August. She then embarked for the Solomon Islands with a large task force, anchoring in Purvis Bay off Florida Island for two weeks before steaming for the Palau Islands on 6 September. She then joined Rear Admiral Jesse B. Oldendorf&#x27;s Western Fire Support Group (Task Group 32.5; TG 32.5). Firing first on 12 September to cover minesweeping operations and underwater demolition teams at the opening of the Battle of Peleliu, &quot;Maryland&quot; again conducted shore bombardment supporting the landing craft as they approached the beaches on 15 September. Four days later, organized resistance collapsed, permitting the fire support ships to retire to the Admiralty Islands at the end of the month.

=== Battle of Leyte Gulf ===
&quot;Maryland&quot; steamed for Seeadler Harbor, Manus where she was assigned to the 7th Fleet under Admiral Kinkaid. The fleet sortied 12 October, and &quot;Maryland&quot; joined Task Group 77.2, which was the gunfire and covering force for the invasion of Leyte. She, along with four other battleships and numerous cruisers and destroyers, steamed into Leyte Gulf on the morning of 18 October. &quot;Maryland&quot; took position between Red and White Beaches and began bombarding them ahead of the invasion, which began at 10:00 20 October. Securing the beaches quickly, &quot;Maryland&quot; then took up a sentinel position in Leyte Gulf to guard the beaches against Japanese counterattack by sea.

For the next several days, Japanese forces launched air raids to counter the incursion. These included the first widespread use of the &quot;kamikaze&quot; suicide attack. Several days later, U.S. submarines in the South China Sea spotted two Japanese forces on approach: five battleships steaming toward San Bernardino Strait, and another force of four Japanese carriers in northern Luzon.

On 24 October, &quot;Maryland&quot;, &quot;West Virginia&quot;, , &quot;Tennessee&quot;, &quot;California&quot;, and &quot;Pennsylvania&quot; sailed to the southern end of Leyte Gulf to protect Surigao Strait with several cruisers, destroyers, and PT Boats. Early on 25 October, during the Battle of Surigao Strait, Japanese battleships and , with their screens, led the Japanese advance into the Strait. At 03:55, the waiting Americans ships launched an ambush of the two Japanese battleships, pounding them with torpedoes and main guns. Torpedoes from the destroyers sank &quot;Fusō&quot;. Continued attacks by the task force also claimed &quot;Yamashiro&quot;. A few of the remaining Japanese ships then fled to the Mindanao Sea, pursued by Allied aircraft.

Following the victory, &quot;Maryland&quot; patrolled the southern approaches to Surigao Strait until 29 October; she then steamed for the Admiralty Isles for brief replenishment and resumed patrol duty around Leyte on 16 November, protecting the landing forces from continued Japanese air attacks. On 29 November, during another Japanese air attack, a &quot;kamikaze&quot; aircraft surprised and struck &quot;Maryland&quot;. The aircraft crashed into &quot;Maryland&quot; between Turrets No. 1 and 2, pierced the forecastle, main, and armored decks, and blew a hole in the 4-inch steel, causing extensive damage and starting fires. In all, 31 men were killed and 30 wounded in the attack, and the medical department was destroyed but still functional.

The battleship continued her patrols until relieved on 2 December, when she sailed with two heavily damaged destroyers for repairs. She reached Pearl Harbor on 18 December, and was extensively repaired and refitted over the next few months.

=== Battle of Okinawa ===
After refresher training, &quot;Maryland&quot; headed for the western Pacific on 4 March 1945, arriving at Ulithi on 16 March. There she joined the 5th Fleet and Rear Admiral Morton Deyo&#x27;s Task Force 54 (TF 54), which was preparing for the invasion of Okinawa. The fleet departed on 21 March, bound for Okinawa.

&quot;Maryland&quot; was assigned targets on the southern coast of Okinawa to support a diversionary landing, which would distract Japanese forces away from the main landing on the west coast. Japanese forces responded with several air raids, with two of &quot;Maryland&quot;&#x27;s radar picket destroyers being struck by &quot;kamikaze&quot; planes, with &quot;Luce&quot; sinking. On 3 April, she was moved to the west coast invasion beaches to assist the cruiser in destroying several shore batteries. Following the land invasion, she remained with the support force off Bolo Point providing artillery support for the invading troops.

&quot;Maryland&quot; continued fire support duty until 7 April, when she steamed north to intercept a Japanese surface force with TF 54. The Japanese ships, including the , came under constant U.S. air attacks that day, and planes of the Fast Carrier Task Force sank six of the 10 ships in the force. At dusk, a &quot;kamikaze&quot; loaded with a bomb crashed the top of Turret No. 3 from starboard. The explosion wiped out the 20 mm mounts and caused a large fire. The 20mm ammunition ignited from the heat, causing further casualties. In all, 10 were killed, 37 injured and 6 missing following this attack. &quot;Maryland&quot; remained on station for the next week and continued her artillery support mission through several more air raids. Turret No. 3, damaged but usable, remained silent for the remainder of this mission.

On 14 April, &quot;Maryland&quot; left the firing line at Okinawa and escorted several retiring transports. They steamed via the Mariana Islands and Guam to Pearl Harbor, and she reached the Puget Sound Navy Yard at Bremerton on 7 May for repairs and an extensive refit. All of her 5 in guns were removed and replaced by sixteen 5 inch/38 cal guns in new twin mounts. The light AA armament was revised to forty Bofors 40 mm in ten quad mounts and thirty-six Oerlikon 20 mm in eighteen dual mounts, though another source gives &quot;Maryland&quot; forty-four 40 mm in eleven quad mounts and forty-four 20 mm in twenty twin and one quad mount in the same timeframe. The armored conning tower was removed and replaced by a similar but lighter STS structure with only armor to compensate for the extra weight gained during this refit. An extra 3in of STS was added over the magazines, with elsewhere over the protective deck, while turret-top armor was raised to . New double-layer anti-torpedo bulges were installed, increasing the armored freeboard to compensate for the increase in weight. SK-2 radar was installed in place of the previous SK, and the main battery received new Mk.13 radars for fire control. Turret No. 3 was repaired and the crew quarters were improved. She completed repairs and upgrades in August, leaving for tests and training runs just as Japan surrendered, ending the war.

=== Post-war ===

&quot;Maryland&quot; now joined the Operation Magic Carpet fleet. During the remaining months of 1945, &quot;Maryland&quot; made five voyages between the west coast and Pearl Harbor, returning more than 8,000 servicemen to the United States. Arriving at Seattle, Washington on 17 December, &quot;Maryland&quot; completed her Operation Magic Carpet duty. She entered Puget Sound Naval Shipyard on 15 April 1946, and was placed in commission in inactive reserve on 16 July. She was decommissioned at Bremerton on 3 April 1947, and remained there as a unit of the Pacific Reserve Fleet. &quot;Maryland&quot; was sold for scrapping to Learner Company of Oakland, California on 8 July 1959.

On 2 June 1961, Governor of Maryland J. Millard Tawes, dedicated a monument to the memory of &quot;Maryland&quot; and her men. Built of granite and bronze and incorporating the ship&#x27;s bell, this monument is located on the grounds of the State House in Annapolis.

<text>ZTT Records is a British record label founded in 1983 by the record producer Trevor Horn, the businesswoman Jill Sinclair and the &quot;NME&quot; journalist Paul Morley. They released music by acts including Frankie Goes to Hollywood, Grace Jones, the Art of Noise and Seal. 

In December 2017, Universal Music Group (UMG) acquired ZTT Records, along with Stiff Records. The ZTT and Stiff back catalogues were licensed to BMG Rights Management under Union Square Music until 2022, when Universal relaunched the label.

==History==
ZTT is an initialism of Filippo Tommaso Marinetti&#x27;s sound poem &quot;Zang Tumb Tumb&quot;, which described &quot;zang tumb tumb&quot; as the sound of a machine gun. It is believed that they likely got the idea for the name via John McGeoch, who produced the Swedish pop-funk band Zzzang Tumb&#x27;s eponymous 1983 album around the same time as the label was founded.

The majority of the creative team at ZTT had first assembled when Horn produced the album &quot;The Lexicon of Love&quot; for the British pop band ABC. A precursor to ZTT was the short-lived Perfect Recordings label, spun off from the newly founded Perfect Songs publishing subsidiary of Trevor Horn and Jill Sinclair&#x27;s company. Perfect Recordings only released the Buggles&#x27; &quot;Adventures in Modern Recording&quot;, along with the singles derived from it.

In 1983, Horn, Sinclair and Paul Morley founded ZTT Records. Sinclair was ZTT&#x27;s managing director, while Morley concentrated on marketing. In the same year, Sinclair and Horn acquired Basing Street Studios from Island Records in exchange for distributing the ZTT label.

ZTT&#x27;s first signing was Frankie Goes to Hollywood, whose hits &quot;Relax&quot; and &quot;Two Tribes&quot; were among the best-selling singles of the decade. &quot;Relax&quot; became the label&#x27;s first number one single in January 1984, and stayed on the UK Singles Chart for a full year. During the 1980s, Grace Jones and Art of Noise were other ZTT acts to chart. ZTT also helped define the structure and formats of the UK pop music scene; as part of their marketing efforts to prolong the life of a single release, ZTT issued multiple 12&quot; remixes which charted at positions in their own right as a separate 12&quot; single. ZTT also licensed or produced T-shirts with graphic messages related to its artists&#x27; singles (eg. Frankie Say Arm the Unemployed), which themselves became 1980s icons.

In 1984, the Horn-Sinclair family businesses were reorganised as SPZ Group, which then consisted of Sarm West Studios, Perfect Songs, and ZTT Records. From the beginning, the majority of ZTT releases were published by Perfect Songs, and recorded at Sarm West Studios. The latter part of the decade was eclipsed by a bitter legal battle between ZTT and Holly Johnson, who fought his way out of the strict, long recording agreement. Similarly, other ZTT artists, such as Art of Noise and Propaganda, were disenchanted and left the label. Propaganda&#x27;s case was settled out of court; Johnson won his outright.

By the late 1980s, ZTT began to focus on the emerging dance music scene. Manchester trance group 808 State would reach the top 10 with &quot;Pacific State&quot;, and three other singles and one album during the early 1990s. Seal was the next major ZTT act to emerge in the 1990s, and the label also achieved hits with MC Tunes and Shades of Rhythm.

ZTT Records have produced forty-five Top 40 hits in the United Kingdom, fifteen of which were Top 10 hits.

In May 2022, UMG released a new album by Propaganda vocalists Claudia Brücken and Susanne Freytag on the reactivated ZTT label. Credited to xPropaganda, &quot;The Heart Is Strange&quot; was recorded with producer Stephen Lipson, and received a generally positive reception.

==Music videos and cover art==

ZTT Records pioneered music video and cover art as forms of high art in their own right. Morley commissioned videos from then-unknown directors, who would go on to become acclaimed in their field, such as Anton Corbijn and Zbigniew Rybczyński. Morley also commissioned early ZTT sleeve design and photography to pioneers of the medium such as Malcolm Garrett, Corbijn, Mark Farrow and Jean-Paul Goude.

The label&#x27;s work in the visual field was profiled by Tony Enoch in Design Week, who positioned ZTT as &quot;from a time when a record label meant something – a happening, a sense of belonging. Labels defined people&#x27;s youth. Think Apple, Virgin, Beggar&#x27;s Banquet, ZTT, and Stiff: small, independent British labels appearing to be able to do anything they wanted, reinventing the rules.&quot;

In 2008, journalist Ian Peel curated a first exhibition of ZTT sleeve art for galleries in London and Tokyo, and in 2013, he curated the visual archives of ZTT and Sarm West Studios before the studios were demolished. In 2009, Peel compiled a DVD of the labels&#x27; most acclaimed videos, entitled &quot;The Television Is Watching You&quot;, which received a British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) 15 Certificate.

==Notable acts on the ZTT label==

† as one-time UK distributor for Tommy Boy Records

==Action Series==
As part of ZTT internal cataloguing of releases, they maintained two series; the Action Series, and the Incidental Series. The Action Series was issued mainly to singles and albums by a majority of the label&#x27;s artists. However, to confuse matters, the series also contains a booklet and a concert.

The Action Series paused in 1988, and was restarted by record label manager Ian Peel in 2012.

<text>President for life is a title assumed by or granted to some presidents to extend their tenure up until their death. The title sometimes confers on the holder the right to nominate or appoint a successor. The usage of the title of &quot;president for life&quot; rather than a traditionally autocratic title implies the subversion of liberal democracy by the titleholder (although republics need not be democratic &quot;per se&quot;). Indeed, sometimes a president for life can proceed to establish a self-proclaimed monarchy, such as Jean-Jacques Dessalines and Henry Christophe in Haiti.

==Autocracy==
A president for life may be regarded as a &quot;de facto&quot; autocrat.

Many leaders who proclaimed themselves president for life have not in fact successfully gone on to serve a life term. Most were deposed before they died, and others achieved a lifetime presidency by being assassinated while in office. However, some have managed to rule until their natural deaths, including José Gaspar Rodríguez de Francia of Paraguay, Alexandre Pétion and François Duvalier of Haiti, Rafael Carrera of Guatemala, Josip Broz Tito of Yugoslavia, and Saparmurat Niyazov of Turkmenistan. Others made unsuccessful attempts to have themselves named president for life, such as Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire in 1972.

Some long-serving autocratic presidents are mistakenly described as presidents for life. They were never officially granted life terms and, in fact, stood periodically for reelection. However, in most cases, these were sham elections which guaranteed them re-election.
